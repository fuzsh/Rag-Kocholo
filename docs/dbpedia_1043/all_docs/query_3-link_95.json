Mr Fraser left a widow and a son, Andrew, to whom we all extend our sincere and heartfelt sympathy. Mr Fraser represented the electorate of the Australian Capital Territory in the House of Representatives for 19 years up to the time of his death. He was elected in the general elections of 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961, 1963, 1966 and again in 1969. In 1954 Mr Fraser was a member of the Select Committee to inquire into and report upon the Hansard of the House of Representatives. He was ViceChairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory from 10th April 1957 and a member of the Privileges Committee from 5th March 1964 until his death.\n\nA former school teacher and journalist, Mr Fraser attained a unique distinction in public life as the member for the Australian Capital Territory. In Canberra he was known to be a man who was all things to all men. He has been described by some people as the Mayor of Canberra, the senator for the Australian Capital Territory and the civic ombudsman, adviser and confidant of people in all walks of life in the Territory. Mr Fraser worked tirelessly for each and every one of his constituents. Perhaps this caused him to ignore the assault on his own strength and physique. He was a man who, putting politics aside, would be the image of the perfect private member. He was dedicated to his electorate and to the task of being the voice of the electorate. Always smiling and affable, he could be seen in attendance at almost every civic or school function or church fete - in fact, at all functions in his electorate. He was a familiar figure to most of the citizens of the large area of the Australian Capital Territory. I think this was adequately shown last Friday by the thousands of mourners who attended his state funeral at St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, lined the route of the funeral to the cemetery and were present at the graveside.\n\nIt has been said that perhaps the Australian Capital Territory electorate was not so much a political seat as one known as a Fraser seat, lt is true, I believe, that no man understood the needs of his constituents better than he did. Anybody who is called upon to follow him as the member for the Australian Capital Territory faces a huge task in equalling his dedication to his constituents. Another unique factor in regard to Mr Fraser’s public life is that he and his brother, Mr Allan Fraser, who represents the electorate of Eden-Monaro, were the first brothers ever to serve in the same House of the Commonwealth Parliament at the same time. The late Mr Fraser served his country in war and in peace. During World War II - in December 1941 - he enlisted in the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. He served as a gunner with the 2/1 Field Regiment in 1942-43 and with the Public Relations Field Unit in 1944-45. He was discharged on 25th March 1946 with the rank of sergeant. I move:\n\nSenator MURPHY:\n\nNew South WalesLeader of the Opposition\n\n– On behalf of all Opposition senators I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government (Senator Anderson). Mr Fraser was a member of the Australian Labor Party and a very good member. He served the electorate of the Australian Capital Territory faithfully and well. It is always difficult in any country to represent an electorate which incorporates the seat of Government. This applies not only in this country but also in the United States of America and in other places. Special problems arise in electorates in which the seat of Government is situated. In Australia extra burdens have been placed upon the representative for the Australian Capital Territory because of the absence of any real local government in the Territory, and because of the absence of the physical facilities necessary to enable the representative to do his job adequately. Despite the burdens imposed on him Jim Fraser did his job to the best of his ability and, in addition, gave of himself enthusiastically. He was well loved by the people of this area. No greater tribute could have been paid to him than that which was paid on the clay of his funeral when great numbers of the people of Canberra turned out - the men, the women and the schoolchildren. The places of entertainment, the hotels, and the clubs were closed. People not only surrounded the church in great masses but also lined the route from the church to the place of his final resting.\n\nMr Fraser continued to carry out his duties in recent times although suffering very greatly from illness. This illness had continued for some time. J refer now not to the final fatal illness, but to the earlier periods of considerable discomfort which he endured over a very long period. Despite this handicap he went on, unhesitating, and I think he stands as a model of a man who did not want to set the world on fire but merely wanted to carry out as well as any man could the task which he had chosen, the task which had been entrusted to him by the people of the A.C.T. That task was to represent them as well as he could in the councils of this nation and in every other sphere in which they lacked the representation which he felt they should have. He showed his feeling for Parliament by acting as a member of the Select Committee to inquire into and report upon the Hansard of the House of Representatives, by acting as a member of the House Committee and by carrying out the task of Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. In these ways he tried to serve not only this area but also the Parliament as resident in the area.\n\nMr President, we are proud to have known this man. He was not only a fine Parliamentarian; he was also a man of great tolerance and very much humour. He was extremely approachable and was in all ways a very civilised and a fine human being. We would like to join the Minister for Supply (Senator Anderson) in extending the heartfelt sympathy of everyone here to his family and in putting on public record our feelings regarding the outstanding service which he performed under very difficult circumstances in this Parliament on behalf of the people of the Territory.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nMinister for Air · Western Australia · CP\n\n– My Country Party colleagues and I would like to join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Anderson) and the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Murphy) in paying a personal tribute to the late Mr Jim Fraser. It was with great sadness and regret that I learned in Western Australia last week of the passing of Mr Fraser. During the 12 years ] have had the honour to be a member of the Parliament I came to have an everincreasing respect for Mr Frasers ability and integrity.\n\nThere would hardly be a person in any political walk of life in Australia who had not heard of Jim Fraser. His untiring efforts for his Party and for his constituents in the Australian Capital Territory stamped him as a most able and dedicated parliamentarian, particularly in the Canberra political sphere. Throughout the whole of Australia he was respected as a politician and as a person. In saying that, I know that I speak for all present and past politicians from my State. The people of the Australian Capital Territory were fortunate in having such a capable man as their representative for so many years. I believe that the Parliament of Australia was enriched by his dedication and political talents. On behalf of my Country Party colleagues, and on my own behalf, T extend deepest sympathy to Mrs Fraser and to her son in their sad bereavement.\n\nSenator McMANUS:\n\nVictoria\n\n– The Australian Democratic Labor Party associates itself with the remarks that have already been made and expresses regret at the passing of the late Jim Fraser. Mr Fraser was a man of great ability and of high principles, yet he was a kindly man whom it was a pleasure to have known. He carried out a very difficult and responsible political task in Canberra where he was not only a member of Parliament but, in a sense, almost a mayor as well. The confidence which his constituents had in him was shown by the increasing majorities with which he won his seat. T understand that they paid a remarkable tribute to him on the day of his funeral. That was an indication of the very high regard in which he was held. My Party joins in expressing to his family its very deep regret at his passing.\n\nSenator WILLESEE:\n\nWestern Australia\n\n– I want to add my very sincere remarks to the eulogy of the late Jim Fraser and to agree with everything that has been said. As has been stated, he entered Parliament in 1951 but I knew him before then. 1 had a fairly close association with him when he was private secretary to Senator McKenna, the then Leader of the Opposition in this place. Naturally at that time he had a lot to do with members of the Australian Labor Party.\n\nI came here as a very young man and was struck by the excitement and turmoil of this place, but standing out like a beacon in all of that was Jim Fraser. Somehow those days seem to remain in my memory just as clearly as do the years that we spent together in the Parliament. He was a man of high principles and quiet efficiency. He brought logic and clear thinking to every problem, no matter what it might be. All of these attributes of this big man were laced with humour. Always 1 thought of him as a dour Scot but that never seemed to come into his humour which would sparkle in all sorts of ways. If ever it was at your expense it was never with anything else but the greatest of fun.\n\nVery few people realised that Jim Fraser had a deep knowledge of New Guinea. He was always my sheet anchor whenever problems relating to New Guinea arose. He had fought there as a soldier. The humour of Army life always showed through in his analysis of the fighting in New Guinea. He had an amazing way of analysing people, and it made no difference that the people of New Guinea with whom he associated at that time were not the same as we are. He had a tremendous understanding of the New Guineans. He had made a real study of their tribal life and their problems. As I said, to me he was a sheet anchor because whenever problems concerning New Guinea were being discussed I found that to discuss them with Jim Fraser was to discuss them with a man who had had the advantage of being there, had made a very close and serious study of the area and liked the people there just as much as he liked his own Australian people.\n\nHe was known as Big Jim. Physically, of course, he was a big man; but it always struck me that his mind was just as big as his body. I never found Jim Fraser thinking along petty lines. He was never loquacious. What had to be said he said clearly and succinctly. He had the ability to place the problem very clearly before people in a few short words, whatever they happened to be discussing. There is an old saying that he who treads softly goes far. In that gentle way which we associate with big men - big in mind and big in body - he certainly went a long way. This was exemplified not only in his funeral, which I understand was the biggest the national capital has ever seen, but also in the tremendous record majority that he obtained at the last election. No matter what electorate in Australia one considers, it was a record or near record majority in view of the fact that all sorts of things have to be taken into consideration in respect of various electorates.\n\nHe did not ever tread softly when he thought there was a wrong to be righted. That is when I found that he could be angry when anger was necessary or when it was warranted. It was on those occasions that his almost natural flair for research was exhibited. I do not mean research in the academic sense; but whenever he produced facts they were salient and unarguable because of his natural flair for research. One found that no matter how far one tried to dig behind his arguments he always had the answers.\n\nIn this Parliament there are certain men - I do not exclude members of other parties but I have in mind several people in my own Party because I have been associated with them more than with members of other parties - whose bigmindedness, bigheartedness, ability and humour inevitably rub off on to others. I believe that Jim Fraser was one of those men. To my mind, he is one of the greats of the Australian Labor Party. These men inevitably leave something with others. I feel the loss to Australia; I feel the loss to this Parliament; I feel the tremendous loss to the Australian Labor Party; and I feel a personal loss in having lost a very good friend and a good mate in every sense of the word.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable senators standing in their places.\n\nMotion (by Senator Anderson) agreed to:\n\nThat as a mark of respect to the memory of the late Mr J. R. Fraser the sitting of the Senate be suspended until 8 p.m.\n\nSitting suspended from 3.19 to 8 p.m.\n\npage 530\n\nQUESTION\n\nREPATRIATION\n\nSenator FITZGERALD:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation whether he has seen a pamphlet from the Returned Services League requesting a better deal for ex-servicemen. The League requests that an independent nonparliamentary committee be set up to make a complete review of repatriation matters, that there should be a general review of war and service pension rates, that repatriation hospital, medical and pharmaceutical benefits should be extended to all returned ex-servicemen of the First World War and the Boer War and that the funeral grant be increased from $50 to $150. Can the Minister say whether these just requests from the League will be granted by this Government?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– I have seen the submission from the Returned Services League. These are matters which will be considered by Cabinet during Budget discussions.\n\npage 530\n\nQUESTION\n\nROYAL VISIT MEDALLIONS\n\nSenator LAWRIE:\n\nQUEENSLAND · CP; NCP from May 1975\n\n-I would like to ask the Minister representing the Treasurer what arrangements have been made between a company called Commemorative International Ltd of 275 George Street, Sydney, and the Royal Australian Mint to have the Mini issue 1,000 gold medallions to commemorate the Royal visit. Were tenders called for this privilege? What is the actual value of the gold content of these medallions which are to be sold to the public for $296 per set?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– My attention has been drawn to this matter. 1 sought some information from the Treasurer.I would like to make it clear to the Senate that this medallion is not being issued by the Government or by the Royal Australian Mint. The issue is a purely private venture and the company involved is solely responsible for the price, design and alloy of the medallions as well as for the details of their distribution. The Mint is concerned only with the manufacture of working dies from the master die supplied by the company and with the striking with these working dies of blanks which have been supplied by the company. The Mint is charging the company a commercial rate for these services.\n\npage 530\n\nQUESTION\n\nVIETNAM\n\nSenator BISHOP:\n\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question to the\n\nLeader of the Government in the Senate concerns what appears to be a conflict between a statement made by the Prime Minister and a statement made by the Minister for Defence in relation to withdrawals from Vietnam. As the Leader of the Government will remember, the Prime Minister said as far back as December last that Australian withdrawals would accompany the next withdrawals by United Stales troops, and that more recently the Minister for Defence was reported from Vietnam as having placed some restrictions on that proposition. Can the Leader of the Government tell the Senate the Government’s policy in relation to withdrawing Australian troops from Vietnam?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– Apparently the honourable senator in his judgment sees some variation or contradiction in the statements made by the Prime Minister, on the one hand, and by the Minister for Defence, on the other hand, in relation to Australia’s participation in future possible withdrawals from Vietnam. In view of the judgment that the honourable senator has madeI think I should take the opportunity to read the statements in question. At the time when the statements were made I did not see any variation in the generality of the issue. For that reason I ask the honourable senator to put the question on notice and I will get a considered reply for him. From any comment thatI have heard or from my own knowledge there is not, to my mind, any inconsistency in the views expressed by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Defence.\n\npage 530\n\nQUESTION\n\nVISIT OF RUSSIAN PROFESSOR\n\nSenator McMANUS:\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration. What are the circumstances behind the visit to Australia of. Mr B. Gafurov of the Soviet Union? Is it correct that Mr Gafurov is not, as is alleged in some circles, a professor and that his only known publication is one book on colonialism? What action does the Government take to ensure that exchanges of academics with the Soviet Union are bona fide?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– I have some information concerning\n\nProfessor Gafurov which may answer some of the points raised. If it does not cover all that the honourable senator requires I shall be pleased to obtain further information for him. Professor Gafurov is an historian and is Director of the Institute of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. He was invited by the Australian National University in May 1969 to consider making a short visit to discuss an exchange of scholars to the mutual benefit of both institutions. Exchange visits of this nature may be approved under long standing government policy subject to satisfactory sponsorship where necessary. Other Western countries also favour exchanges of this nature.\n\nThe Professor applied to the Australian Embassy in Moscow last month for a 14-day visit visa in response to the invitation from the Australian National University. The application was the subject of normal careful examination, including consultation with other interested departments, and with particular regard to security considerations. A visa for a 14-day visit was granted to enable the discussions at the Australian National University on which the University’s invitation was based. I will be pleased to get further information concerning the honourable senators question.\n\nSenator McManus:\n\n– The Government says that he is -a professor?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– I gather so from the note that I have here.\n\npage 531\n\nQUESTION\n\nDROUGHT\n\nSenator MAUNSELL:\n\nQUEENSLAND\n\n– I direct my question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In view of the serious drought position which once again exists in many parts of Queensland, particularly western Queensland, due to the non-arrival of the normal wet season, and in view of the serious financial position faced by most people both in the towns and on the land as a result of years of drought, will the Prime Minister consider as a matter of extreme urgency the latest request from the Premier of Queensland for Commonwealth assistance?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– The Commonwealth Government is well aware v( »he effects of the prolonged drought in Queensland and is already providing substantial assistance to that State. Requests for assistance in such circumstances are always dealt with as quickly as possible, and I can assure the honourable senator that the recent proposals submitted by the Premier of Queensland - as the honourable senator will appreciate, these will require detailed examination and careful consideration - are being treated as most urgent in the circumstances.\n\npage 531\n\nQUESTION\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– My question, which is directed to the Minister for Housing, relates to the War Service Homes Division. Does the Minister recall that in the 1967-68 Budget Papers the then Federal Treasurer, when commenting upon the amount allocated in that financial year for war service homes loans said, amongst other things: ‘We shall seek additional funds if the amount now being provided proves insufficient’? Is that still the present Government’s policy? If so, has the Minister made application to the Treasury for additional funds to meet in this financial year applications for loans which have been frozen or at least put into cold storage until the next financial year? What has been the outcome of any such application?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– Yes, I recall the words quoted by the honourable senator from the 1967-68 Budget Papers, concerning the allocation for war service homes. I remind him that, if my memory serves me correctly - I am sure that it does - no similar statement was made in the last Budget Papers.\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– Has the policy changed?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– May I just continue answering the honourable senator’s question? I remind him that we increased the allocation by $5m in the last Budget. I also inform him and the Senate that even with the increase the allocation has not been sufficient to meet the applications, which have been greater than estimated.\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked whether the matter has received further consideration. I answer him by saying that it has received further consideration,I also inform him, as I did at question time during our last sitting, that there is only one area of loans in which there is a waiting time - that is, loans for the purchase of existing homes - and the deferment is 2 months added on to the normal processing time of 4 months. I want to inform him again, as I did then, that this means a short delay, but we should remember that these are very generous loans, especially when one realises that they are made at3¾% interest and over a period of 45 years.\n\npage 532\n\nQUESTION\n\nMEAT EXPORTS\n\nSenator LAWRIE:\n\nQUEENSLAND · CP; NCP from May 1975\n\n– I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry a question. Is any of the Australian meat exported to Canada and later re-exported to the United States of America taken into account as part of the Australian quota of meat allowed to be exported direct to the United States of America?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– Under United States meat import laws total arrivals of fresh, chilled and frozen meat in 1970 are limited to about 1,061 million lb from all countries. Within that figure the allowance for meat from Australia is something like 527 million lb. All of the Australian allocation will be taken up by meat that is shipped direct from Australia to America.\n\npage 532\n\nQUESTION\n\nOIL DRILLING ON GREAT BARRIER REEF\n\nSenator GEORGES:\n\nQUEENSLAND\n\n-I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer him to the proposed royal commission to inquire into oil drilling on the Great Barrier Reef which was announced in the Governor-General’s Speech. Can he explain the delay in the appointment of the commission? Will he tell the Senate who is responsible for the delay and whether it stems from a disagreement with the Queensland Government over the composition of the commission?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– I am not aware of the circumstances of the delay.I will seek some information on the matter and make it available to the honourable senator and the Senate as and when I obtain it.\n\npage 532\n\nQUESTION\n\nVIP AIRCRAFT\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nTASMANIA\n\n– My questionis directed to the Minister for Air. Is it a fact that the Minister for Labour and National Service took part in a debate in Hobart recently? Did the Minister fly to Hobart in a VIP aircraft? If so, does the Minister regard such an occasion as warranting the use of a VIP aircraft and is it Government policy that VIP aircraft can continue to be used for such purposes?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n-I do not know whether or not the Minister for Labour and National Service took part in a debate in Hobart. I would have to check whether the Minister made application for the use of a VIP aircraft. I suggest that the honourable senator put his question on notice.I will supply an answer later on.\n\npage 532\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL AVIATION\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Does the Minister for Civil Aviation know of any New South Wales country aerodrome previously under joint Department of Civil Aviation and council control that now has reverted to complete local authority control?\n\nSenator COTTON:\n\nMinister for Civil Aviation · NEW SOUTH WALES · LP\n\n– I should be grateful to the honourable senator if he would put that question on the notice paper. I do not know of any such aerodrome. I will try to obtain an answer for the honourable senator. The question, in its present form, seems to me to be rather hard to answer. I think that the honourable senator meant the 50% maintenance basis provided for in the present proposals.\n\npage 532\n\nQUESTION\n\nVIETNAM\n\nSenator CAVANAGH:\n\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– I ask a question of the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Has President Nixon issued an order to American forces in Vietnam that the United States command is to offer no infantry support in the Vietnam conflict but is to supply only air and artillery support? Therefore, do the Australians and the South Vietnamese supply the only infantry support in this war? If the American command has received such orders, will the Australian Government order the Australian troops to be employed similarly?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– I have no idea and I am sure that nobody would have any idea of what would be a tactical decision In the field regarding the deployment of troops. The question, in the form in which it is presented, seems to me to be completely unreal. I suggest that the question be put on notice.\n\npage 533\n\nQUESTION\n\nREPATRIATION\n\nSenator BISHOP:\n\n– My question is direc ted to the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation. Does the Government intend to implement the decision of the Senate in respect of an investigation into repatriation matters, including a recommendation that free hospitalisation should apply to veterans of the Boer War and of the First World War and resolutions which closely follow the current Returned Services League campaign?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– That is a matter of policy. I suggest that the honourable senator place his question on notice. I will obtain an answer from the Minister for Repatriation.\n\npage 533\n\nQUESTION\n\nRADIO STATIONS\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. Is the Minister aware that, because of amendments made to the Federal Copyright Act last year, as from 1st May next recording companies will have the right to demandfrom radio stations cash payments of royalties for the right to spin records on air and that as from 1st May an agreement providing record companies with compensation in the form of publicity for discs played on radio will terminate? Is it a fact that commercial radio stations say that they will not make cash payments and that the President of the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters has said that no agreement now seems possible between the stations and the record companies? Is it a fact that commercial broadcasting stations plan to drop all Australian and English discs from their programmes as from 1st May and to play only American records? Will such a ban have a crippling effect on Australian composers and musicians? Will the Government immediately intervene between the two warring parties to protect the Australian performers and the public in this matter which is of far reaching importance?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– I could not give the honourable senator an answer to his question, but I appreciate the points that he raised. I will take them up with the Postmaster-General and obtain an answer as quickly as I can.\n\npage 533\n\nQUESTION\n\nEDUCATION\n\nSenator McMANUS:\n\n– Has the Minister representing the Minister for Education and Science seen statements, firstly from Dr J. F. Cairns and, secondly, from a person who claims to be organising a moratorium in the Australian Capital Territory in May, calling on schools to participate in a strike to be held at that time? Will the Minister inform me who has authority over the children - their parents and teachers or Dr Cairns and the organisers of the moratorium?\n\nSenator WRIGHT:\n\nMinister for Works · TASMANIA · LP\n\n– I regret to inform the honourable senator that I have not seen the statements to which he has referred. I may claim the excuse that I returned to Canberra only this morning after a short visit overseas. As to the question regarding the incitement of school children to strike, when they are attendant at school they are under the jurisdiction of the schools, and when they are at home they should be under the authority of their parents.\n\npage 533\n\nQUESTION\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSenator WEBSTER:\n\nVICTORIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Reserve Bank of Australia has now advised private trading banks that the announced rise in bank interest rates is not now to be applied to the accounts of rural primary producers? Is it correct that the end of a calendar month occurred between the date of the approval of the rise in interest rates and the date of the direction not to apply the rise to primary producers? Is it not likely that the increased rates were applied to all categories of account as at the end of that calendar month? Will the Treasurer obtain an assurance from the major trading banks that the action of increasing interest rates, which may have applied to primary producers, has now been reversed?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– The answer to the first part of the question asked by the honourable senator is yes, an instruction has been issued through the Reserve Bank concerning differential rates for primary industry. I think that the part of the question concerning the application of the rates and the various refinements of the application to which the honourable senator referred should be placed on the notice paper and I will get a considered reply from the Treasurer.\n\npage 534\n\nQUESTION\n\nDRIED VINE FRUITS\n\nSenator DRURY:\n\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is it a fact that dried vine fruit growers recently rejected the Commonwealth Government’s offer of a stabilisation plan for the industry? Was the referendum proposal defeated because growers had not supported the plan as vital issues concerning the previous plan had not been resolved? Is it a fact that growers were promised a cost of production figure which was to be arrived at from the proceeds of their dried vine fruits, but that when final payments were made to growers, profits from other activities were apparently included in thefinal returns? Is it also a fact that growers have been deprived of the benefits of a stabilisation scheme and. as a result, have lost millions of dollars? Will the Government examine and police all marketing expenses and reexamine the whole situation so that stability can be established in this very vital industry?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– Yes, it is a fact that dried vine fruit growers recently rejected a stabilisation scheme, but I do not think they rejected it on the grounds which the honourable senator has stated. However.I shall ask the Minister for Primary industry to have a look at the honourable senator’s question and to give me an answer whichI shall supply to the honourable senator at a later date.\n\npage 534\n\nQUESTION\n\nF111 AIRCRAFT\n\nSenator WILLESEE:\n\n– Has the attention of the Minister for Air been drawn to the fact that the American Senate permanent sub-committee on investigations, which is now investigating the F111, is examining the question whether in 1962-63 and in the early part of 1964 there were Government reports from engineers to the effect that the performances of this plane were nowhere near what they were claimed to be, that the performances were very much exaggerated? Can the Minister tell me whether this information was known to the government of the day or whether, in the course of its inquiries, this information was concealed from it?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– I have seen the report of the remarks made at the American Senate Committee meeting to which the honourable senator referred. I think it should be recognised that the situation often occurs that an aircraft does not measure up to the specifications it had when it was on the drawing board.I do not agree with the remarks that the honourable senator has made butI suggest that he put his question on notice and I will obtain some information for him.\n\npage 534\n\nQUESTION\n\nBUTTERWORTH AIR FORCE BASE\n\nSenator O’BYRNE:\n\nTASMANIA\n\n– Will the Minister for Air acquaint the Senate of the authenticity of a report that the Australian Government will be required to pay rental to the Government of Malaysia for the use by the Royal Australian Air Force of the Butterworth base and its facilities? If so, has any reciprocal arrangement been made by the Australian Government to charge the Malaysian Government for the services of the manpower and material used at Butterworth?\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN:\n\nCP\n\n– This matter is under negotiation at the present time and no doubt the Minister for Defence will be making a statement on it at a later date.\n\npage 534\n\nQUESTION\n\nBANK INTEREST RATES\n\nSenator KENNELLY:\n\nVICTORIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Government proposes to request the banks not to increase the interest on bank loans for borne buyers, which will be in line with the action taken affecting the interest paid on loans to rural producers?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– I am not aware of any details in that regard.I would need to seek information on this and I would ask the honourable senator to put that question on the notice paper.\n\npage 534\n\nQUESTION\n\nOIL POLLUTION\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nQUEENSLAND\n\n– Can theMinister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport advise the Parliament of the names of. the experts who supported the use of Gamlen oil spill remover in Torres Strait, and can he also inform the Parliament of the methods used in the areas around the pearl culture beds to remove oil that had leaked from the ‘Oceanic Grandeur’?\n\nSenator COTTON:\n\nLP\n\n– It will be necessary for me to direct that question to the appropriate Minister to get an answer for the honourable senator.\n\npage 535\n\nQUESTION\n\nVIETNAM\n\nSenator CAVANAGH:\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs. Have a number of deformed babies been born in Vietnam in areas where Americans have used chemical defoliants? Have such chemical preparations been used by the Australian forces? Has the South Vietnam Health Minister obtained a report on the number of abnormal births in areas where defoliant chemicals were used? If so. will the Minister seek to obtain a copy of such report and make it available to honourable senators?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– I will seek any information possible in answer to the honourable senator’s question.\n\npage 535\n\nQUESTION\n\nF111 AIRCRAFT\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. In view of the distinct possibility of the F111 contract being cancelled will the Minister assure the Senate that before any decision is made to purchase an alternative aircraft a proper investigation of all suitable aircraft types available on the world market will be made?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– As is known, the Minister for Defence is currently in Washington in the United States and amongst other things is having discussions in relation to the F111. It would be completely inappropriate for me to make a comment in advance of his return to Australia when no doubt he will make a full statement in relationto any matter that he has discussed there.\n\npage 535\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL AVIATION\n\nSenator BISHOP:\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister for Civil Aviation. I ask the Minister has he, as the Minister responsible for the policies pronounced by the Government in relation to the reequipping of domestic airlines, ever advocated or supported the principle of offset orders for Australian industry in respect of purchases being made by those airlines?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– I would like to intercede to answer this question because I understand that the honourable senator directed an almost identical question to me several weeks ago. He also directed a similar question to Senator Cotton in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Senator Cotton has written to the honourable senator advising him that the matter has been referred to me for comment, but the honourable senator may not yet have received that letter. I am in the process of having a comment prepared for me by the Department. Some time ago Senator Bishop asked me whether I would make a comprehensive statement about the aircraft industry in Australia. At present I am examining a draft of that statement and I would hope to present it to the Senate, if not tomorrow then on Thursday.\n\nSenator Poyser:\n\n– Is it a ministerial statement?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\n– Yes.\n\npage 535\n\nQUESTION\n\nAGED PERSONS HOMES\n\nSenator CAVANAGH:\n\n– I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services whether inquiries can be made into the standards of accommodation provided as aged persons homes in various localities and the varying amounts of government subsidy as disclosed in the publication of grants approved for February 1970? Can the Minister explain why it costs $5,000to house an aged person at Auburn, New South Wales;$5,400 at Mackay, Queensland; $6,500 at Albury, New South Wales; $7,000 at Kirrawee, New South Wales; $9,000 at Canberra; and $12,900 at Port Augusta, South Australia?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– A great deal of detail will be required to answer the honourable senator’s question. I ask him to place his question on the notice paper and I will get those details for him.\n\npage 535\n\nQUESTION\n\nDRUG EVALUATION\n\nSenator WEBSTER:\n\n– Has the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Health been directed to the fact that American health authorities consider that certain drugs, commonly known in Australia as ‘The Pill’, are considered so likely to damage health that manufacturers of such products must now include with them a 700- word leaflet warning of the risks to health? Why has this action not beentaken by Australian authorities?In what way can the Minister assure the Senate that drugs available to the Australian public are properly evaluated by the Commonwealth Drug Evaluation Committee and are not evaluated by trial on the Australian public?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\n– I have seen the Press report to which the honourable senator has referred. I will take up with the Minister for Health the honourable senator’s questions concerning the evaluation of drugs and get a reply for him.\n\npage 536\n\nQUESTION\n\nQUESTIONS ON NOTICE\n\nSenator KENNELLY:\n\n– Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate give honourable senators any idea when answers will be given to questions that have been placed on the notice paper? Some questions have been on the notice paper since 1st March and even allowing for the answers to questions on notice that are to be provided tonight, advice of which has been circulated, about 103 questions on notice remain to be answered. Is it only wasting time to ask for information in this way, or does the Minister intend at least to remember that he has been away from Parliament for a fortnight, including the Easter holidays? In those circumstances one would have expected more answers to questions on notice than are to be given tonight. I ask the Minister what he intends to do.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– The honourable senator has asked about the response to questions placed on the notice paper. I have in front of me advice as to answers to such questions that are to be furnished tonight. I assume that honourable senators have received this advice, which shows that answers to about 40 questions on notice will be given tonight.\n\nSenator Poke:\n\n– He excluded those questions. There are still 103.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\n– Am I answering the question or are you? If you want to answer it, you may do so.\n\npage 536\n\nQUESTION\n\nSOFTWOODS\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\n– Can the Minister rep resenting the Minister for National Development inform the Senate whether the Commonwealth and State Softwood\n\nForestry Agreement of 1967, which terminates on 30th June 1971, will be extended for a further period? If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, what is the likely period of the extension of the Agreement?\n\nSenator COTTON:\n\nLP\n\n– It would not be proper for me to answer the question without referring it to the Minister for National Development. However, I think it would be a proper assumption on my part to say that I am sure that the time will be extended, but for what period I do not know. I am quite positive that there will be an extension of time, but I shall find out the details for the honourable senator and let him know.\n\npage 536\n\nQUESTION\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSenator O’BYRNE:\n\n– My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Since the farmers’ historic marches in Melbourne and Perth which drew attention to their plight and achieved the result that they are to have concessions in interest rates on their overdrafts and concessions in estate duties, will the Minister consider granting similar concessions to home builders who will be asked to pay the increased interest rates currently being prepared by the banking institutions of this country?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– In a moment when I showed perhaps a lack of restraint I did not complete my answer to Senator Kennelly. I do not want to appear to be discourteous to the honourable senator. In addition to questions on notice being answered today there are others which, although not on the notice paper, are being answered. Every effort will be made to supply many answers this week.\n\nSenator Hendrickson:\n\n– The Minister wanted to be discourteous to me only, is that it?\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\n– When it comes to questions in this place, if one lives by the sword one perishes by the sword. Senator O’Byrne’s question suggested that because of a march by farmers in Victoria the Government has done 2 things: Firstly, it has decided on a differential rate of interest for farmers and, secondly, it has given special concessions in relation to interest on estate duties. It is my recollection that interest on estate duties was mentioned in the policy speech, which was a. fair time ago, and that interest rates have been dealt with in this place. Senator Webster asked a whole series of questions long before the march took place and I gave an assurance that the matter was being considered by the Government.I think that disposes quite conclusively of any suggestion that the problems of the rural industries have been dealt with specially because of a very orderly march by farmers in Melbourne. This is not to suggest that the rural industries in Australia do not have particular problems - they have. No-one would be silly enough to suggest that they do not have problems.\n\nAs Senator McManus said in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, the problems of the rural industries exist not only in Australia but also in every other free country. Coming now to the ultimate part of Senator O’Byrne’s question, he has suggested that because of some spirited action by farmers in Melbourne, those who are involved with interest rates on housing loans should do the same thing and may achieve the same result. I have demonstrated that the result in relation to farmers had nothing to do with the march.\n\npage 537\n\nANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\n\npage 537\n\nSOCIAL SERVICES\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– I shall certainly refer the honourable senator’s question to the Minister for Social Services. The Minister will, of course, decide what comments he will make.\n\npage 537\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\npage 538\n\nJAM\n\npage 538\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– I think I have really answered this question previously in a variety of ways. I just want to say again that there is a slight delay in the existing-\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The honourable senator has had his go: this is mine. There is a slight delay of from 6 to 8 weeks in the processing of applications for loans for existing homes, but those eligible for war service homes assistance are in a much better position than other members of the community to become home owners because the war service homes loan of $8,000, repayable over 45 years at 3¾% is, I believe, the very best loan that any person can get. It is, indeed, a very fitting thing that our exservice people should receive the benefit of that very favourable loan.\n\npage 538\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– I think the honourable senator’s question is entirely offensive both to me and those people who serve their country. I have given the answer to this question on more than one occasion. As I said earlier, I believe it is very right and proper that ex-service people should receive the benefit of the war service homes loan of $8,000 repayable over 45 years at 3¾%. There is no better loan in Australia. Although we bad an added allocation in the last budget, because of the increased number of applications there will be a slight increase of 6 to 8 weeks in the processing of applications for loans for existing dwellings. I have informed the Senate of this.I again sayI believe that the benefit of this loan to ex-service people is of such value to them that it is right and proper that they should benefit from it.\n\npage 539\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n-I have already informed the Senate that the only delay - a slight delay of 6 to 8 weeks - is in respect of applications for the purchase of existing homes.I think I surely made that clear to Senator McClelland. We believe that the present area of delay is the area in which a delay, if any, should occur because it causes least hardship to ex-service personnel requiring homes.\n\npage 539\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– May I say first of all that Senator Cavanagh’s memory must be very short when he speaks of an unprecedented delay of 2 months. When I became Minister for Housing there was a delay in the provision of war service home loans. Since I have been Minister for Housing there has been no such delay.\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– There was a delay. I suggest to newcomers to the Senate that if they look back over the records they will learn that there were lengthy delays which we all regretted and worked hard to eliminate. I certainly cross swords with Senator Cavanagh when he speaks of an unprecedented delay.\n\npage 539\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Dane ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nMinister for Housing · QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n-I have already told Senator McClelland that there is only one area in which there is delay, and that is in relation to a loan for an existing home. There is no delay beyond the normal processing period in the granting of other loans.\n\npage 539\n\nWAR SERVICE HOMES\n\nSenator Sir Magnus Cormack:\n\nVICTORIA\n\n-I rise to order, Mr Deputy President. I refer you to the instructions contained in standing order 99 - rules for questions - relating to the use of ironical expressions. Senator Cavanagh is introducing them constantly into his questions.\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n-I was about to answer the question. I can assure Senator Cavanagh that at all timesI will do my utmost to give to every ex-serviceman returning to this country after service the best possible benefits.\n\npage 540\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n(Question No. 1)\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, upon notice:\n\nWhat are the names of Australian citizens who have either had their passports refused or confiscated since1950 and what were the circumstances of each case.\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nApplications for passports are confidential between the applicants and the Department and it is not considered appropriate that names, or circumstances of refusal, be disclosed.\n\npage 540\n\nCOMMONWEALTH LITERARY FUND\n\n(Question No. 14)\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice:\n\nWhat has been the result of the consideration and discussion by the Commonwealth Literary Fund of a proposed expansion of the Fund’s activities and a proposal by Senator McClelland that grunts be made available to Australian writersto enable them to spend some time in Asia.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:\n\nThe Fund has expanded its activities by increasing the number of Fellowships awarded. This year 16 Fellowships were awarded and the allocation to the Fund increased from $110,000 to $147,000.\n\nThere are no special travelling fellowships. However, if a Fellowship holder decides to travel during the tenure of his Fellowship in search of material for a book, the money from the Fellowship may be used for this purpose. In fact, there have been Fellowships where the major portion of the award has been used for travel for research, i.e. Cyril Pearl, who went to Japan and China for background for ‘Morrison of Peking’; Gavin Souter, who went to Paraguay to interview descendants of the Lane colonists; and Elizabeth Salter, who not only has travelled widely in Australia but also in England and Ireland seeking information for her biography of Daisy Bates. The Fund is always prepared to consider on their merits applications for Fellowships which may involve travel. Recently the Department of External Affairs arranged for a group of Australian writers to visit Asia. Five Australian writers and scholars participated in a seminar on Australian and Indian literature held in New Delhi in January. These included Professor Leonie Kramer, Miss Judith Wright, Professor James McAuley, Professor G. H. Russell and Mr Rodney Hall. After the Seminar the Australian participants separated and visited different parts of India to deliver lectures and take part in discussion on Australian literature in universities in some of the main Indian cities.\n\npage 540\n\nABORIGINAL WELFARE\n\n(Question No. 39)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice:\n\nHow much of the total allocation for Aboriginal welfare for the year 1968-69, remained unspent as at 30th June 1969.\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs has furnished the following reply:\n\n$1,341,479.\n\npage 540\n\nSEARCH AND RESCUE\n\n(Question No. 100)\n\nSenator WILLESEE:\n\nasked the Minister for Air, upon notice:\n\nWhy were RAAF aircraft not used during a recent search, lasting several days, for a man lost in wild country near Derby, in Western Australia.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:\n\nThe Police Department in each State is responsible for organising searches for lost hikers and other persons in similar distress. If the occasion demands, Royal Australian Air Force assistance is sought. There was no request in this case for Royal Australian Air Force assistance.\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister for\n\nAir, upon notice:\n\nHow many major sections of the F111 are fabricated with D6 AC steel.\n\nWill planes fabricated with this type of steel stand up to the stresses caused by Australian flying conditions.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:\n\nMany individual parts in the F111C aircraft are fabricated with D6 AC steel. Those parts are used in a variety of sections. The RAAF considers that there are thirteen sections in the aircraft which would be regarded as major.\n\nAircraft operating in Australian flying conditions are not subjected to stresses that are any greater in an the stresses induced in the same aircraft flying in other parts of the world.\n\npage 540\n\nF111 AIRCRAFT\n\n(Question No. 118)\n\npage 540\n\nLAOS\n\n(Question No. 123)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice:\n\nDoes the Australian Government support United States military policy in Laos.\n\nAre any Australiantroops or military or other service advisers stationed in Laos.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The Minister for External Affairs has provided the following answer:\n\nYes.\n\nNo.\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the\n\nMinister representing the Minister for Immigration, upon notice:\n\nHow many persons have been refused admission to Australia from countries in Asia on the basis that they have children in their care who are minors.\n\nDo a number of these persons have other children who are not only resident in Australia, but, indeed, are naturalised Australians, and does this policy discriminate against certain people, in that those who have no children can be admitted to Australia, but those with children who are minors are refused admission.\n\nWill the Minister review this anomalous situation.\n\npage 541\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n(Question No. 125)\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question: (1), (2) and (3) The Government decided in 1956 that non-European aged parents of residents of Australia should be eligible for admission to Australia for residence if the parents had no dependent children residing with them.\n\nThe intention was to allow reunion of aged parents with their sons or daughters residing in Australia in cases where the parents would otherwise be left alone overseas. It was not intended that the entry to Australia of one member of a family should necessarily entitle that person’s parents, brothers and sisters to settle here.\n\nThe stipulation that there should be no dependent children residing with the parents has however been waived when strong compassionate grounds have justified this, and applications will continue to be considered on their merits.\n\nStatistics of refusals have not been maintained.\n\npage 541\n\nCYCLONE ‘ADA\n\n(Question No. 133)\n\nSenator GEORGES:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Army, upon notice:\n\nDid the great damage caused by Cyclone Ada’ in the Proserpine-SouthHarbour area of Queensland leave many people homeless and exposed to the elements for several days; if so, why was Army relief suddenly withdrawn from the area, in spite of the fact that the people of Cannon Vale and Airlie Beach were still isolated and in great need.\n\nWho gave the order forthe withdrawal of Army relief.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Army has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nArmy assistance to civil authorities in an emergency is given at the request of the appropriate State authority. In the case of ‘Cyclone Ada’ relief assistance, in terms of teroporary shelter, food, labour, transport, medical and emergency services, was made available on request. One soldier lost his life in the crossing of a flooded river during the progress of a relief convoy to the stricken area.\n\nThe relief convoy was. dispatched without delay and on arrival set about providing rescue and relief services. This assistance was provided wherever it was requested and in the quantities and type required. It was some days before the situation was brought under control and the appropriate Stale authorities no longer required Army assistance. Airlie Beach was one area that required some special assistance and troops and equipment remained in that area for some 10 extra days.\n\nThe troops were withdrawn only after their allotted tasks had been completed and the remaining tasks were well within the capability of Slate relief organisations.\n\nWhen Army assistance was no longer required clearance for withdrawal of the Army relief was given by the local State emergency committee representative.\n\nThe Army has always been ready to assist civil authorities in civil emergencies and it has a proven record in such cases. However, it is the appropriate State authority, and not the Army, which has the responsibility for deciding what type of assistance is necessary in the particular circumstances.\n\npage 541\n\nVIETNAM\n\n(Question No. 172)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Army, upon notice:\n\nWhat is the total number of persons wounded in action in Vietnam since Australia became involved in the war.\n\nHow many of such wounded have been accidentally wounded or injured, and how many were national servicemen.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Army has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nAt 20th March 1970 Australian Army non-fatal battle casualties, totalled 1882 of which 808 were national servicemen. One hundred and thirty-six of these non-fatal battle casualties were wounded or injured accidentally.\n\npage 542\n\nFUNERAL EXPENSES\n\n(Question No. 173)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister rep resenting the Treasurer, upon notice:\n\nWill the Treasurer examine the possibility of allowing the full amount of funeral expenses as a tax deduction in the case of any deceased dependant of a taxpayer.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nIt is the practice of the Government to examine the many requests that are made for taxation concessions when it is preparing the annual Budget. The representation made by the honourable Senator has therefore been noted for consideration when the 1970-71 Budget is being prepared.\n\npage 542\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n(Question No. 174)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, upon notice:\n\nWhy has Mr A. J. Vorstman of 8 Pandora Street,Boondall, Queensland, been refused naturalisation.\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nMr Vorstman’s application has been carefully considered on previous occasions but it has been decided that Australian citizenship by naturalisation should not be granted to him.\n\nIt is a longstanding rule to disclose the reason for the deferment or refusal of an application for citizenship only where the applicant is unable to show that he has an adequate knowledge of the English language or of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, or where he is unable to comply with the residential requirements of the Citizenship Act.\n\nAs Mr Vorstman’s case does not come within these categories the grounds on which his application for citizenship has been refused cannot be disclosed.\n\npage 542\n\nVIETNAM\n\n(Question No. 178)\n\nSenator KEEFFE:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Army, upon notice:\n\nHow many Australian servicemen have been killed in Vietnam. In action and accidentally, since Australia became involved in the war.\n\nHow many of those who lost their lives were national servicemen.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Army has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nAt 20th March 1970 Australian Army fatal casualties in Vietnam were:\n\nBattle casualties 356\n\nNon-battle casualties 28.\n\nNational servicemen 165.\n\nNOTE - These figures exclude 3 national servicemen and 7 regular members who died of illness.\n\npage 542\n\nIMMIGRATION\n\n(Question No. 3)\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, upon notice:\n\nHas the Minister read the Press reports of the trial arising from a robbery at Pruniers Restaurant, Double Bay, Sydney.\n\nHas the Minister read the Judge’s comment on Miss Anne Marie Bondy, whom he described as a James Bond character.\n\nCan the Minister inform the Senate if Miss Bondy, who is now in Tel Aviv, is in possession of an Australian or an Israeli passport\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nAn Australian passport was issued on 10th January 1967 to an Anne Marie Bondy who is recorded as having left Australia on 27lh June 1969.\n\npage 542\n\nUNION BALLOT\n\n(Question No. 9)\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice:\n\nIn the recent ballot to elect officers for the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Workers’ Union, conducted under the provisions of Section 170 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, did the New South Wales Electoral Officer refuse to permit a recount in the ballot for the position of New South Wales President.\n\nWas such a decision based on the margin between the two candidates concerned, or does no provision exist for a recount in ballots conducted under Section 170 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.\n\nArising from this ballot, does the New South Wales Electoral Officer feel that procedures should be changed in the light of criticism voiced at the recent Australian Workers’ Union National Convention.\n\nSenator WRIGHT- The Minister for Labour and National Service has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nYes. (2)I am informed the decision was based on the margin between the two candidates concerned.\n\nThe Electoral Officer was not precluded from ordering a recount. Decisions in matters of this nature are for the officer conducting the ballot under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I have every confidence in the manner in which these ballots are conducted.\n\npage 543\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE\n\n(Question No. 15)\n\nSenator Douglas McClelland:\n\nNEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\nasked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice:\n\nDid the Prime Minister state, on 4th March 1969, that he had asked the Commonwealth Public Service Board to consider whether it should notify all officers of the Public Service that its practice is that, even when an officer is under notice of dismissal, the Board would accept the officer’s resignation, should it be tendered.\n\nHas the Public Service Board so notified Commonwealth public servants; if not, why has notification not been given.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The Prime Minister has supplied the following answer:\n\nYes; see House of Representatives Hansard page 318, 4th March 1969.\n\nI am informed by the Public Service Board that it is in consultation with the AttorneyGeneral’s Department with a view to the clarification of the Board’s General Orders which deal with the resignation of officers of the Commonwealth Service. When this work has been completed revised General Orders will be promulgated.\n\npage 543\n\nARMY\n\n(Question No. 84)\n\nSenator POYSER:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Army, upon notice:\n\nHas the Minister seen allegations, published in the December issue of a publication called Resist, which state that:\n\nConscripts at Canungra Training Camp are told categorically that no prisoners are to be taken during action in Vietnam, and that if the enemy arc wounded they should be shot; and\n\nSome conscripts at this camp have deliberately wounded themselves so that they can be discharged as psychologically unfit.\n\nHas the Minister investigated these allegations; if so, what were the findings of the investigations.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Army has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nYes.\n\nThe allegations have been investigated but there is no evidence that students at the Jungle Training Centre have been instructed to shoot prisoners. All instruction on the handling of prisoners is based on the Geneva Conventions and programmed periods are set aside for this very purpose.\n\nThere is no record of any national serviceman deliberately wounding himself for any reason, at the Jungle Training Centre.\n\npage 543\n\nPINE FORESTS\n\n(Question No. 98)\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nasked the Minis ter representing the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice:\n\nWill the Minister provide an early reply to my letter of 27th January 1970, in which I asked if the Wildlife Research Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation can confirm or deny a recent assertion in the Sydney ‘Daily Telegraph’ that, with the vast expansion of pine forest plantation, these areas have been deserted by Australian Capital Territory bird life.\n\nHas the CSIRO also checked the reaction of wombats to pine forests as their habitat.\n\nSenator WRIGHT- The Minister for Education and Science has supplied the following answer:\n\nA letter dated 11th March 1970, has been forwarded to Senator Mulvihill by the Minister for Education and Science.\n\nNo.\n\npage 543\n\nDOGS\n\n(Question No. 108)\n\nSenator MULVIHILL:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice:\n\nHow many dogs were imported from Britain and Ireland in each of the ‘3 years prior to the imposition of the import ban on such dogs?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThe number of dogs imported from Britain and Ireland during each of the three years prior to the ban being imposed was:\n\npage 544\n\nPEST STRIPS\n\n(Question No. 113)\n\nSenator WILKINSON:\n\nWESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice:\n\nHas the Minister’s attention been drawn to a recent warning by Professor Goran Lofroth of Stockholm University, supported by Dr S. V. Boyden, of the Biology Department at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, and the authoritative British Journal ‘New Scientist’, that pest strips similar to some on sale throughout Australia are a serious danger to humans, as they give off a high level of the nerve gas DDVP?\n\nWill the Minister take whatever action is necessary to protect the health of the community?\n\nSenator Dame ANNABELLE RANKIN:\n\nLP\n\n– The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nyes.\n\nAppropriate action has been taken by referring the matter to the National Health and Medical Research Council which is undertaking a review of all toxicological information available on the use of DDVP pest strips.\n\nSenator GREENWOOD:\n\nVICTORIA\n\nasked the\n\nMinister representing the Minister for External Affairs, upon notice:\n\nAre the cease-fire negotiations between South Vietnam and the United States, on the one hand, and the Viet Cong and North Vietnam, on the other, still continuing; if so, is it a fact that the talks have made no progress.\n\nIs the prolongation of the talks, despite United States willingness to withdraw if the North Vietnamese will desist from aggression, due to North Vietnamese unwillingness to do so; if so, is the current tactic of the North Vietnamese and their apologists and supporters directed towards weakening the resolution of the United States, Australia and other allies to maintainthe security of the South Vietnamese Government.\n\nIs it the Australian Government’s view that it would be deserting the South Vietnamese when they are not secured from North Vietnamese and Viet Cong aggression if Australia at the present time were to withdraw from Vietnam.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The Minister for External Affairs has provided the following answer:\n\nThe expanded talks on Vietnam are continuing in Paris between representatives of the Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America on the one side, and representatives of the communist side in the Vietnam conflict on the other. These talks relate to all aspects of a settlement in Vietnam, and are not limited to the possibility of a cease-fire. There have now been fifty-eight plenary sessions of the expanded talks (upto the session on 12th March 1970). No progress has been made so far.\n\nThe lack of progress in the talks is the result of the communists’ refusal to enter into serious negotiations. They have refused to discuss the reasonable and constructive proposals put forward by President Nixon on 14th May1969, and by President Thieu on 11th July 1969, despite the fact that the Allied side has made clear that all aspects of those proposals and any other proposals put forward are negotiable, with the single exception of thefundamental right of the people of South Vietnam to determine their own future. Instead, the communist side has continued to demand that the Allies accept unconditionally their own proposals, the chief elements of which are the unilateral withdrawal of all Allied forces and the replacement of the present Government of the Republic of Vietnam by a so-called provisional coalition government’. There are indications that the Communists, in maintaining their intransigence, hope for a progressive weakening in Allied resolution, which will leave the way open for them to achieve their own maximum objectives.\n\nThe policy of the Australian Government on the withdrawal of Australian forces was set out bythe Prime Minister on 16th December 1969.\n\npage 544\n\nVIETNAM\n\n(Question No. 114)\n\npage 544\n\nSALES TAX\n\n(Question No. 120)\n\nSenator POYSER:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice:\n\nWill the Treasurer give consideration to amending the appropriate legislation to provide for sales tax exemptions for blind persons in gainful employment who, because of their disability, are unable to use public transport and are driven daily to and from their places of employment by a relative or friend.\n\nSenator ANDERSON- The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nIt is the Government’s practice to examine the many requests that have been made for taxation concessions when it is preparing the annual Budget. The request by the honourable senator has accordingly been noted for consideration when the 1970-71 Budget is being prepared.\n\npage 544\n\nSUPERANNUATION\n\n(Question No. 137)\n\nSenator MURPHY:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice:\n\nWill the Government make a statement as soon as possible as to the principles upon which it is intended the portability of superannuation rights will operate.\n\nSenator ANDERSON - The Prime Minister has provided the following answer:\n\nSee my statement of 25th September 1969 on the preservation of superannuation rights (Hansard, pages 1462-1464).\n\npage 545\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 145)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWhat are the educational and physical entry qualifications for an electrical officer by (a) Junior entry, and (b) S.D. entry.\n\nWhy is there a difference relating to the wearing of spectacles.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nEducational Qualifications -\n\nJunior Entry Royal Australian Naval College - Pass a qualifying examination in Maths and English. The standard of the examination will be such so as to give an indication ofthe capability of the candidate to qualify for Matriculation to the University of New South Wales within 2 years of entry to the Naval College.\n\nSenior Entry RANC- Complete Matriculation.\n\nDirect Entry - Engineering Undergraduates or Diplomates.\n\nS.D. Entry- Services General Certificate of Education in four subjects, English and two subjects from Maths 1, Maths II and Physics compulsory (Victorian Leaving standard).\n\nPhysical Qualifications -\n\nJunior and Senior Entry to RANC and Direct Entry - All candidates are to be capable of carrying out duties of naval officers in all climates and geographical situations and under all vicissitudes of the Service. He must have no history of illness or disability which will prevent him from undergoing hard physical exertion, eating a normal balanced diet without choosing his own food and be able to keep up with other healthy men of good physique. Standard 1 hearing is required to take into account deterioration of hearing which may come about due to exposure to noise and other factors.\n\nS.D. Entry - As for junior entry but in the case of an SD Officer’s hearing, due allowance is made for his experience, age and exposure to noise.\n\nThere is no difference between the two entries relating to the wearing of spectacles. Both are permitted to wear spectacles for distance and reading at all times.\n\npage 545\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 147)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWhat are the conditions governing week-end duty in the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nIs it a fact that in the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force time off is granted in lieu of week-end duty.\n\nWhy can this privilege not be extendedto Naval personnel.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nShort Leave is arranged on the principle of giving officers and sailors the maximum amount of leave which can be granted without affecting the efficiency of the ship or establishment.\n\nThe Army give a day’s leave to those employed on duty on Sundays only. The RAAF grant one day’s leave to those members on duty on either Saturday or Sundays.\n\nThe privilege in (2) above cannot be given to Naval personnel because they are required to be available for duty at all times.\n\nHowever, in recognition of this requirement, Naval personnel are given basic leave of 4 weeks per year for shore service and 6 weeks for seagoing service. RAAF and Army personnel have a basic leave entitlement of 3 weeks per year.\n\npage 545\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 151)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWhat temporary married accommodation exists at HMAS ‘Cerberus’ for senior sailors and ratings undergoing courses.\n\nSenator DRAKE BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThere is no temporary married accommodation in HMAS ‘Cerberus’.\n\npage 545\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 156)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWhat facilities exist at Naval depots for the training of ratings in NBCD specifically relating to aircraft.\n\nIs it a fact that a detailed proposal to provide the facility at HMAS ‘Albatross’ was not even acknowledged by senior naval officers.\n\nHow would the Naval Board compare the facilities existing at HMAS ‘Penguin’ for NBCD training with those at overseas depots; and what steps are being taken to up-grade these facilities.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nNo practical facilities exist for the training of sailors in decontamination of aircraft but facilities are providedfor practical firefighting training in aircraft at ‘Albatross’ where old aircraft are provided for the purpose. Current regulations require that the theory of decontamination of aircraft be taught to Fleet Air Arm sailors but this requirement is under review.\n\nNaval Staff Officers at Navy Office are not aware of any detailed proposal to provide facilities for the training of ratings in NBCD specifically relating to aircraft.\n\nThe Naval Board continually evaluates the standards required in NBCD training and the equipments and facilities necessary to meet the training standard. Examination of overseas methods of instruction and facilities is periodically carried out and, after due regard to the assessed requirement of the RAN and its envisaged operating area, alterations to training syllabuses are made if considered necessary.\n\nThe design and erection of new facilities and buildings to meet the training requirements is often a prolonged task requiring the efforts ofa number of Commonwealth Departments and also must take account of all requirements of the establishments inwhich they are to be located.\n\npage 546\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 158)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\n“What steps are being taken to ensure that Naval courses are comparable to those ashore and thus recognised when a rating is paid off from the Service.\n\nIs the computer training course recognised as equivalent to the B.I.E.T. course.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nNaval courses are designed to fit personnel for service in operational units. Where Commonwealth Departments set trade standards e.g. Department of Civil Aviation, it is practicable to compare standards and to adjust Naval syllabuses to equate with civil standards if this can be done without detriment to the Naval requirement. Where it is the prerogative of individual States to define civilian trade standards, the authorities concerned are provided with details of Naval course content and they identify the equivalent civilian acceptance, as appropriate. Sailors so recognised are entitled to appropriate documentation on leaving the Service. Artificers ex HMAS Nirimba (the Naval Apprentices Training Establishment), receive recognition by the State of New South Wales with whom training standards have been the subject of discussion.\n\nNo. The digital computers used by the RAN are for specialised fighting equipment. Their relation to general purpose commercial computers is therefore extremely limited. Additionally, due to basic differences in logic of the various computers fitted in the RAN, successful detailed training can only be accomplished if personnel are limned to the one type of computer.\n\npage 546\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 161)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nIs it a fact that Department of Agriculture officials in Western Australia, in answer to a query by sailors on HMAS Gascoyne, advised that the space allocated for twenty-seven sailors on this vessel was only suitable for accommodating two pigs and then only if the pigs were taken out for exercise.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nI am not aware of any advice given by Department of Agriculture officials in Western Australia to sailors. I am aware of the substandard conditions inHMAS Gascoyne which is being used as an accommodation ship at Williamstown Naval Dockyard and, as indicated ina reply to a previous question, it is planned to build a new barracksin the Williamstown area as soon as possible.\n\npage 546\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 162)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWill the recent decision by Mr Justice Gallagher in relation to a sea-going content for the overall salary paid to officers and rulings in the Australian Merchant Marine be carried throughto the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the fallowing answer to the. honourable senators question:\n\nThe question of the application of the Gallagher award to appropriate RAN categories is currently under consideration.\n\npage 546\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 164)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nHow many married ratings travel interstate from HMAS ‘Cerberus’ to see their wives and families each pay weekend because no arrangements have been made for accommodation.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThere is no record kept of the destination of sailors on short leave, and I therefore regretI am unable to answer the question.\n\npage 547\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 166)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWith a view to increasing morale in the Navy, will the Minister consider giving an incentive to serving ratings by instituting a suggestion box relating to conditions existing in the Service.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The\n\nMinister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThere are well established procedures in the Navy by which representations affecting welfare and conditions of service can be made through normal Service channels. There is also a suggestion scheme by which suggestions which lead to greater efficiency or monetary saving are rewarded wilh cash awards, if adopted.\n\npage 547\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 167)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nHas the Minister given consideration to instituting a scheme similar to the Royal Navy with respect to bonuses for senior ratings who re-engage.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The\n\nMinister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nIn January 1970 the Naval Board gave consideration to the payment of a re-engagement bonus and decided not to proceed with the proposal. The matter will be reviewed again in January 1971.\n\npage 547\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 168)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nWhat are the reasons for not having shortterm engagements in the Services.\n\nOver the past 3 years, how many senior ratings in the Royal Australian Navy joined the Royal Australian Air Force following completion of their initial engagement in the R.A.N.\n\nAs an ex-officer of the R.A.N. can rejoin the Service from R.A.N.V.R. status, what steps are being considered for senior ratings to accept or be considered for 1 or 2 year appointment at specific depots.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The\n\nMinister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nInitial engagement periods in the RAN are for either 9, 10, H or 12 years. Apprentices and Junior Recruits must engage for 12 years. If the current periods of engagement were shortened, it is probable that there would be a marginal increase in the size of adult male intakes but this could be more than nullified by the shorter periods of effective service that we would get from our trained personnel and the resultant increase in costs and in the training load. Engagement periods are kept under constant review and, should it appear advantageous to shorten the engagement periods for some or all categories, the matter would be given careful consideration.\n\nRecently approval was given for recruits to be given the option of discharge after a trial period should they find they are not happy wilh a Naval career.\n\nThe number of senior sailors in the RAN who in the past 3 years have joined the Royal Australian Air Force following completion of their initial engagement is not known as no record is kept of the subsequent employment of ex-sailors after discharge. However, the RAAF state that very few ex RAN sailors are enlisted in the Air Force.\n\nSenior sailors who do not wish to re-engage in the Permanent Naval Forces may apply for full-time service for either one or two years in a PNF billet as a member of the Royal Australian Fleet Reserve. Their wishes as to where they will serve are taken into consideration and met wherever possible, but in order to preserve an equitable sea/shore service roster it is usually necessary for them to take their turn of sea-service when they reach the top of tie sea-roster.\n\npage 547\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 169)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice: ls any choice available to ratings as to whether they wish to serve in a sea-going capacity or shore billet.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The\n\nMinister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nChoice of a shore billet in lieu of a sea billet is limited to a relatively few shore billets in HMAS Tarangau’ when such service in unaccompanied.\n\nChoice of a sea billet in lieu of a shore billet is allowed in some ranks and categories where then are manning shortages.\n\npage 548\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 170)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nIs it a fact that although two year drafts have been given to some senior ratings, they have been drafted again to sea-going duty after only 4 to 6 weeks, and often after incurring considerable expense, due to the critical state of manning in the service.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN - The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nRank structures and billets at sea and ashore are designed, as near as possible, to produce alternate turns of sea and shore service of 2 years. Current and recent manning levels together with the Fleet’s commitments have not allowed this situation to be achieved for all senior sailors.\n\nIn some categories the period of sea service has been extended to 3-3½ years with shore service being reduced to 1 year.\n\nPostings to sea after shore service has commenced are only made after less than 12 months when sailors are volunteers to forego the balance of shore service. However, some sailors serving in certain billets ashore are required for temporary sea service from time to time e.g. members of the R.A.N. Trials and Assessing Units, Fleet Maintenance Parties, Base Staff at H.M.A.S. Waterhen’ and H.M.A.S. ‘Platypus’.\n\npage 548\n\nROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY\n\n(Question No. 171)\n\nSenator WRIEDT:\n\nasked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice:\n\nIs it a fact that the introduction of group pay provisions has resulted in a complete alteration of the situation which existed under the provisions relating to trade tests and I.Q. tests which applied previously in the Navy.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The Minister for the Navy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThe provisions relating to trade tests and I.Q. tests are designed to establish the suitability of sailors or recruits for particular types of training and have no bearing on a sailor’s emoluments. There has been no change in trade test or intellectual standards since the introduction of group pay.\n\npage 548\n\nF111 AIRCRAFT\n\n(Question No. 188)\n\nSenator TURNBULL:\n\nTASMANIA · IND; AP from Aug. 1969; IND from Jan. 1970\n\nasked the Minister for Air, upon notice:\n\nWhat is the cost to date of (a) supplies, and (b) spare parts for the F111 aircraft which the Government has ordered.\n\nSenator DRAKE-BROCKMAN- The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:\n\nThe total of $A194.7m previously advised as being expended on stores and supplies for the F111 and for the purchase of the aircraft is detailed as follows:\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– On 5th March Senator Lillico asked me the following question without notice:\n\nIs it not correct that there is in existence a treaty signed by North Vietnam not only guaranteeing the neutrality of Laos, but also agreeingto withdraw all North Vietnamese troops from that country? Who are the members of the commission, if there is one, that is charged with ensuring that the treaty is observed? What is the attitude of that commission regarding the unprovoked aggression of North Vietnam against Laos?\n\nI said that, as the question related to the precise provisions of a treaty, it would be proper for me to obtain a considered reply from the Minister for External Affairs. The Minister has provided the following answer:\n\nNorth Vietnam is one of thirteen signatories of the Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos, which entered into force on its signature in Geneva on 23rd July 1962. The parties declared that (paragraph 1)- they recognise and will respect and observe in every way the sovereignty, independence, neutrality, unity and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Laos.’\n\nUnder the Protocol to the Declaration, the same signatories agreed, inter alia, that (Article 2) -\n\nAll foreign regular and irregular troops, foreign paramilitary formations and foreign military personnel shall be withdrawn from Laos . . . ‘\n\nThe Protocol also provided that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, which had originally been established by the 1954 Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, should supervise and control the cease-fire (Article 9) and the withdrawal of foreign regular and irregular troops, foreign paramilitary formations and foreign military personnel (Article 10). The Commission is composed of representatives of Canada, India, and Poland, with the representative of India as Chairman. Article 14 of the Protocol requires that decisions relating to violations of the more important Articles of the\n\nProtocol and all recommendations by the Commission bo adopted unanimously. This requirement, and the consistent refusal of the Pathet Lao to grant the Commission access to territory under their control, have made it difficult for the Commission to discharge its mandate.\n\nThe Protocol also gives the Co-Chairman of the 1962 Conference, the Foreign . Ministers of Great Britain and the Soviet Union, the responsibility for circulating to the members of the Conference the reports and any other important information they receive from the Commission. I am not aware that the Commission has submitted any report on the situation arising from the current North Vietnamese aggression in Laos.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– On 5th March 1970 Senator Poyser asked me whether the Prime Minister had received any representations, from the Victorian Government or otherwise, seeking Commonwealth financial assistance for grape growers at Tresco in Victoria whose crops were damaged by a hail storm. The Prime Minister has now provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:\n\nThe hail storm to which the honourable Senator is presumably referring occurred early in January this year. No representations seeking Commonwealth financial assistance in respect of damage caused by this hail storm have been received.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– On 11th March, Senator Kennelly asked me the following question without notice:\n\nI desire to ask a question of the leader of the Government in the Senate. My question follows the one asked of him by Senator Greenwood from Victoria. I ask the Minister whether he has had brought to his notice an article in the ‘Canberra Times’ of 6th March 1970 which refers to a speech purported to be made by Averell Hardman, the former chief United States delegate to the Paris peace talks, in which he said that the President of South Vietnam, President Thieu, had pulled the rug out from negotiations several times. As peace in Vietnam is very important to Australia because our troops are there, I wonder whether the Government has taken the trouble to see if the facts are as stated by this eminent United States peace negotiator.\n\nI said that I would obtain a reply from the Department of External Affairs. The Minister for External Affairs has provided the following answer:\n\nThe Government is aware of the views reportedly expressed by Mr Hardman, in his personal capacity. The Government does not share those views.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n– On ll th March, Senator Murphy asked me the following question without notice:\n\nCan the Minister representing the Minister for External Affairs supply, for the information of the Senate, information as to when Australia was asked to become involved in Vietnam, from whom the request came, in what form the request was made and, if the request was in any written or printed form, whether a copy of it could be tabled in the Senate?\n\nI said that I would attempt to obtain the information for which the honourable senator was asking. The Minister for External Affairs has provided the following answer:\n\nThe circumstances of the Government’s decisions to send to the Republic of Vietnam, at the invitation of the Government of that country, a group of Australian military instructors in 1962 and a combat force of an infantry battalion in 1963 were set out in statements made respectively on 24th May 1962, by the then Minister for Defence, Mr Athol Townley, and on 29th April, 1965, by the then Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies. The latter was made in the House of Representatives; the text of the statement issued by Mr Townley is as follows:\n\nThe Minister for Defence, the Hon. Athol Townley, announced today that at the invitation of the Government of the Republic of Vietnam, Australia was sending a group of military instructors lo that country.\n\nMr Townley said that there is today in Vietnam an urgent problem of communist infiltration and insurgency which is fomented, directed and supported from North Vietnam. Australia has already given some assistance to the Government of South Vietnam in meeting this threat by providing communications equipment, barbed wire and other materials for village defence, and has promised more aid of this nature.\n\nThe need has now emerged for military training assistance, particularly in the field of jungle warfare, in which Australian forces had particularly valuable experience. Up to some 30 Australian Army personnel will be sent to provide instruction in jungle warfare, village defence and other related activities such as engineering and signals. Colonel F. P. Serong, formerly Commandant of the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra, would shortly visit Saigon to ascertain on the spot the most effective way in which the Australian instructors could be fitted into the defensive measures against the communist activities.\n\nMr Townley emphasised that Australia was not providing combat forces, nor had she been asked by the Government of Vietnam to provide such forces. The role of the Australian Army Instructors would be to assist in the training of the people of Vietnam and so help them to defeat the Vietcong communists, whose aim is to take over that country by organised terrorism.\n\nMr Townley stated that if the Communists were to achieve their aims in Vietnam this would gravely affect the security of the whole South East Asian area and ultimately of Australia itself. The Australian Government’s response to the invitation to assist Vietnam, which is a Protocol State under the SEATO Treaty, was in accordance with Australia’s obligations under that Treaty.’\n\nAs to the tabling of the document or documents Involved, there is a well established principle in these matters that communications between Governments are confidential to the Governments concerned. The Government does not believe it is appropriate to depart from that principle in this case.\n\nSenator WRIGHT:\n\nLP\n\n– On 17th March,\n\nSenator DITTMER:\n\nQUEENSLAND · ALP\n\n)- In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the report relating to the following proposed work:\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force Base at Pearce, Western Australia.\n\nSenator ANDERSON:\n\nLP\n\n-(New South Wales Minister for Supply) - by leave - I wish to inform the Senate that the Minister for Defence (Mr Malcolm Fraser) left Australia on 30th March to visit Vietnam and the United States. In Saigon he has had discussions with senior leaders of the South Vietnamese Government and with Vietnamese, United States and Australian officials and Service commanders. On 4th April Mr Fraser arrived in Washington to have discussions with the Secretary of Defence, Mr Laird, on aspects of the F111 projects and contract. Mr Fraser is expected to return to Australia on14th April and during his absence the Postmaster-General (Mr Hulme) is acting as Minister for Defence.\n\nI also wish to inform the Senate that the Treasurer (Mr Bury) left Australia on 5th April for Korea and Japan. He will be attending the third annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank in Seoul and will also have discussions in Tokyo with the Japanese Minister of Fina"
