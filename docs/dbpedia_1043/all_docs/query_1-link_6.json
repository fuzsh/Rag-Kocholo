Fleet Command is headquartered at HMAS Kuttabul in Sydney, and is led by the Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSFLT), also referred to as Fleet Commander Australia (FCAUST), which is a rear admiral (two-star) appointment.\n\nThe position of Commander Australian Fleet was established in 2007. The previous positions since 1913 were:\n\nRear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Fleet (1913–1926),\n\nRear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron (1926–1949),\n\nFlag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet (1949–1988, regularly abbreviated as FOCAF), and\n\nMaritime Commander Australia (1988–2007 – MCAUST).\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to 1913, all naval activities and forces in Australian waters were controlled by the British Royal Navy. In 1859, Australia Station was established as a separate command of the Royal Navy, responsible for all the waters around the Australian continent, in addition to the British and Australian colonial possessions in the South Pacific. It was at this stage that the forerunner of Commander Australian Fleet, Officer Commanding Imperial Squadron Australian Station, was created. Between the Federation of Australia and formation of the Commonwealth Naval Forces in 1901 to the year of 1913, the Royal Navy began a process of transferring all command responsibility in Australian waters over to the Australian Government, as well as replacing equipment and personnel with Australian variants. The Commonwealth Naval Forces were renamed to Royal Australian Navy in 1911. With the transfer complete in 1913, the position of Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Fleet was formed, with control over all naval combat operations and forces; the post was renamed Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron in 1926. Despite this position being a command of the RAN, the majority of occupants were Royal Navy officers attached to, or on loan to, the RAN.[1][2]\n\nIn 1949, Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron was redesignated Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. This was followed by a renaming to Maritime Commander Australia in 1988, and more recently to Commander Australian Fleet in 2007.[1][3] Throughout its existence, the command has administered Australian naval forces as they have been deployed for duty in the First World War, Second World War, Malayan Emergency, Korean War, Indonesian Confrontation, Vietnam War, Operation Navy Help Darwin (1974–75), the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan and Iraq War, in addition to peacekeeping operations. The rank associated with this position today is rear admiral, however some of the earlier appointees held a different rank.[1][2]\n\nDuring the East Timor operations of 1999–2000, the then Maritime Commander Australia held the Task force designator Commander Task Force 627.[4]\n\nCommand and staff\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fleet Command is led by the Commander Australian Fleet who has overall command of the Fleet and supported by the Director-General Maritime Operations and the Commodore Warfare who have delegated responsibilities for operational command and maritime warfare alongside the Chief of Joint Operations. The principal role of the Fleet Command is to \"plan, prepare for, and conduct maritime operations for the protection and promotion of Australia's security and interests\". With this directive, the operations carried out or planned by the Commander Australian Fleet or the delegated command staff fall into three distinct categories: defence of sovereign territory, protection of overseas trade and offshore resources, and contingencies.[5]\n\nCommander Australian Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fleet Commander is the chief maritime and amphibious operations advisor to the Chief of Navy. The Chief of Navy delegates full command of ships, submarines, aircraft squadrons, diving teams and shore establishments of the Royal Australian Navy to the Fleet Commander. The Fleet Commander is also responsible for overseeing the training, readiness, maintenance, capabilities management and force generation of the Fleet.[6]\n\nThe Fleet Commander delegates the management of naval bases and operational command of Fleet units to force commanders. The Fleet Commander delegates operational control of fleet units to the Director General Maritime Operations and tactical command to the Director General Maritime Operations, the Commodore Warfare, tactical warfare commander, or a task group commander. Unless the Chief of the Defence Force directs the Chief of Navy to assign specific forces to the Joint Operations Command for joint or multinational operations, the Fleet Commander retains control of fleet forces.[7]\n\nDirector-General Maritime Operations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Director-General Maritime Operations (DGMAROPS) is the deputy to the Fleet Commander located within the Headquarters Joint Operations Command. The Director-General Maritime Operations is responsible for providing advice on the preparedness and readiness of the Fleet Command and for the operational control and tactical command of delegated fleet force elements and all Royal Australian Navy units at sea and on \"routine activities\". The Director-General Maritime Operations is also the Navy Submarine Operating Authority and in charge of the Navy Activity Schedule.[8]\n\nThe Director-General Maritime Operations also oversees the Maritime Operations Centre within the Headquarters Joint Operations Command. The Maritime Operations Centre is responsible for the coordination of all maritime operations of units of the Fleet Command outside of Joint Task Forces.[8]\n\nCommodore Flotillas\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Fleet Commander's seagoing subordinate is Commodore Flotillas (COMFLOT), a position established by that name, and previously known as Commodore Warfare (between 2011 and 2018). In 2018, the name was reverted to COMFLOT under the direction of Commander Australian Fleet.[9] The Commodore Flotillas oversees the Australian Fleet Battle Staff and the Australian Maritime Warfare Centre and is responsible for maritime warfare capability management and force generation.[8]\n\nAustralian Fleet Battle Staff\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australian Fleet Battle Staff is the naval staff of the Royal Australian Navy responsible for the command of multinational maritime warfare task groups and the tactical maritime expertise advice to the Australian Defence Force. The Staff also provides sea control operational planning with input from Fleet Forces. Members of the Australian Fleet Battle Staff serve afloat or ashore during maritime operations.[10]\n\nAustralian Maritime Warfare Centre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Australian Maritime Warfare Centre develops maritime warfare policy and formulates joint doctrine and tactics for the Royal Australian Navy. The centre also provides operational analysis to the Defence Science and Technology Group and other analytical capabilities for the Commodore Warfare.\n\nFleet Forces\n\n[edit]\n\nThe operational command of the Force Element Groups of the Fleet Command are delegated from the Fleet Commander to the respective force commanders. The force commanders are responsible for the policy development, administrative management, operational capability, and force generation of all units and personnel of their respective fleet force. The Director-General Maritime Operations will have operational control of the fleet forces when required for deployed operations.[6][8]\n\nSurface Force\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Surface Force oversees the capability management of the destroyers, frigates, and support vessels of the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nSubmarine Force\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Submarine Force is charged with the responsibility of the operations of the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service alongside the Navy Strategic Command's Director-General Submarine Capability.\n\nFleet Air Arm\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Fleet Air Arm is in charge of the operational management and airworthiness capabilities of Royal Australian Navy aviation.\n\nMine Warfare, Hydrographic and Patrol Forces\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Mine Warfare, Clearance Diving, Hydrographic, Meteorological and Patrol Forces is responsible for the operational capability and logistical management of the mine warfare forces, patrol forces, Clearance Diving Branch, the Australian Hydrographic Service of the Royal Australian Navy.\n\nShore Force\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Shore Force is responsible for the shore capabilities and naval facilities including the maintenance and upkeep of the infrastructure, properties and ports of the Royal Australian Navy in accordance with seaworthiness requirements. The Shore Force also provides naval policy input to the Defence Estate and Infrastructure Group on matters of preparedness and garrison support.\n\nInformation Warfare Force\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Commander Information Warfare Force is in charge of the information warfare, signals intelligence and imagery intelligence capabilities of the Royal Australian Navy. The Information Warfare Force was established in 2015 through the amalgamation of five Navy Imagery Units, the Navy Tactical Data Link Organisation, the Maritime Data Correlation Centre, the Maritime Intelligence Support Centre, the Directorate of Maritime Command, Control, Communications and Computers and Electronic Warfare, and the Fleet Information and Communications Technology Support Teams.[11]\n\nList of Commanders Australian Fleet\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following list chronologically records those who have held the post of Commander Australian Fleet or its preceding positions. However, the position of Officers Commanding Imperial Squadron Australian Station (1859–1913) is not included in this list as it was administered as a command of the Royal Navy, and existed before the formation of the Royal Australian Navy. The official title of the commander at that period of time is listed immediately before the officers who held that role. The rank and honours are as at the completion of the commander's term.[1][12][13]\n\nRank Name Postnominals Service Term began Term ended Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Fleet Vice Admiral RN 23 June 1913 22 September 1916 Rear Admiral RN 23 September 1916 9 January 1917 Rear Admiral RN 9 January 1917 3 September 1918 Rear Admiral RN 4 September 1918 21 March 1919 Rear Admiral RN 22 March 1919 29 April 1922 Rear Admiral RN 30 April 1922 30 April 1924 Commodore RN 30 April 1924 30 April 1926 Rear Admiral Commanding HM Australian Squadron Rear Admiral RAN 30 April 1926 17 May 1929 Rear Admiral RN 17 May 1929 29 May 1931 Commodore RN 29 May 1931 7 April 1932 Rear Admiral RN 7 April 1932 19 April 1934 Rear Admiral RN 19 April 1934 20 April 1936 Rear Admiral RN 20 April 1936 21 April 1938 Rear Admiral RN 22 April 1938 2 September 1939 Commodore RN 2 September 1939 1 November 1939 Rear Admiral RN 1 November 1939 13 June 1942 Rear Admiral RN 13 June 1942 13 June 1944 Commodore RAN 13 June 1944 27 October 1944 Captain RN 27 October 1944 9 December 1944 Commodore RAN 9 December 1944 22 July 1945 Commodore RAN 22 July 1945 9 November 1946 Rear Admiral RAN 9 November 1946 5 October 1949 Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet (FOCAF) Rear Admiral RN 5 October 1949 10 October 1951 Rear Admiral RN 10 October 1951 17 December 1953 Rear Admiral RAN 17 December 1953 23 February 1955 Rear Admiral RAN 28 February 1955 7 June 1956 Rear Admiral RAN 7 June 1956 7 January 1958 Rear Admiral RAN 7 January 1958 20 January 1959 Rear Admiral & Bar RAN 20 January 1959 22 December 1959 Rear Admiral RAN 22 December 1959 8 January 1962 Rear Admiral RAN 8 January 1962 6 January 1964 Rear Admiral & Bar RAN 6 January 1964 10 January 1965 Rear Admiral RAN 10 January 1965 29 January 1966 Rear Admiral RAN 29 January 1966 20 January 1967 Rear Admiral RAN 20 January 1967 18 March 1968 Rear Admiral RAN 18 March 1968 6 January 1970 Rear Admiral RAN 6 January 1970 14 April 1971 Rear Admiral RAN 14 April 1971 24 January 1972 Rear Admiral RAN 24 January 1972 1 April 1972 Rear Admiral RAN 1 April 1972 23 January 1973 Rear Admiral RAN 23 January 1973 4 February 1974 Rear Admiral RAN 4 February 1974 17 November 1975 Rear Admiral & Bar RAN 17 November 1975 16 April 1977 Rear Admiral RAN 16 April 1977 8 May 1978 Rear Admiral RAN 8 May 1978 12 April 1979 Rear Admiral RAN 12 April 1979 16 May 1980 Rear Admiral RAN 16 May 1980 1 June 1981 Rear Admiral RAN 1 June 1981 16 March 1982 Rear Admiral RAN 15 March 1982 21 October 1983 Rear Admiral RAN 21 October 1983 3 May 1985 Rear Admiral RAN 3 May 1985 6 January 1987 Rear Admiral RAN 6 January 1987 2 September 1988 Maritime Commander Australia (MCAUST) Rear Admiral RAN 2 September 1988 6 January 1989 Rear Admiral RAN 6 January 1989 9 July 1990 Rear Admiral RAN 9 July 1990 7 November 1991 Rear Admiral RAN 7 November 1991 9 December 1993 Rear Admiral RAN 7 December 1993 13 April 1995 Rear Admiral RAN 14 April 1995 11 February 1997 Rear Admiral RAN 11 February 1997 17 May 1999 Rear Admiral RAN 18 May 1999 12 July 2000 Rear Admiral RAN 12 July 2000 20 July 2002 Rear Admiral RAN 20 July 2002 28 June 2004 Rear Admiral RAN 28 June 2004 4 July 2005 Rear Admiral RAN 4 July 2005 1 February 2007 Commander Australian Fleet (COMAUSFLT) Rear Admiral RAN 1 February 2007 July 2007 Rear Admiral RAN July 2007 8 October 2009 Rear Admiral RAN 8 October 2009 21 December 2011 Rear Admiral RAN 22 December 2011 12 June 2014 Rear Admiral RAN 12 June 2014 19 January 2018 Rear Admiral RAN 19 January 2018 17 November 2020 Rear Admiral RAN 17 November 2020 28 June 2022 Rear Admiral RAN 28 June 2022 16 December 2022 Rear Admiral RAN 16 December 2022 Incumbent\n\n^(I) \"HM\" (His/Her Majesty's) is not always included when referring to these titles."
