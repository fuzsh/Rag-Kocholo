        "text": "The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) has assumed charge of the Combined Task Force (CTF) 150, a Bahrain-based multinational coalition.\n\nBritain’s Royal Navy handed over the command of CTF 150 to Australia during a ceremony at the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) Headquarters in Bahrain.\n\nThe UK was supported by personnel from the French Marine Nationale during the 119-day mission.\n\nIn addition to the RAN, the incoming personnel will include forces from the Royal Canadian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by officials from the 33 member nations of the CMF.\n\nThe CTF 150 focusses on counter-terrorism operations in the maritime domain. The task force acts against the movement of terrorist personnel, weapons and narcotics and enables freedom of navigation to commercial ships.\n\nIt is responsible for the region covering the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean.\n\nThe Australian, New Zealand and Canadian team underwent training for six weeks in Sydney to prepare for the deployment.\n\nThe training was followed by mission readiness evaluations at the Naval Synthetic Warfighting Centre at HMAS Watson, the RAN’s maritime warfare training establishment.\n\nThe team will be commanded by RAN commodore Ray Leggatt.\n\nLeggatt said: “We are fortunate that our Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand staff composition will bring valuable diversity in thinking and experience, which will provide us with agility and unity of effort in the prosecution of our singular mission.”"
