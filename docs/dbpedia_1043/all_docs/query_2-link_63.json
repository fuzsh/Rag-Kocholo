        "text": "Commander Tina Brown has become the first female officer to heft the ‘weight of command’ on an Australian destroyer.\n\nCAPTION: Outgoing Commanding Officer Commander Andrew Pepper exchanges the ‘weight of command’ of DDG39 to new Commanding Officer Commander Tina Brown. Photo by Petty Officer Christopher Szumlanski.\n\nCommander Brown took responsibility for HMAS Hobart from outgoing commanding officer Commander Andrew Pepper during a handover ceremony on 16 December last year [reported in Navy News dated 16 February 2023].\n\nAfter a busy year of achievements in 2022, HMAS Hobart returned to Fleet Base East in December, after more than three months away as part of an RPD [regional presence deployment].\n\nRegional Presence Deployment 2022-4 highlights\n\nThe ship was warmly welcomed back to Sydney by its extended community of ‘ghost riders’ – a large crowd of family and friends eager to spend the holiday season with their loved ones.\n\nThe RPD completion capped off a busy and successful 2022, celebrated with Hobart’s recognition in the 2022 Fleet Awards – named the winner of the AIO Shield, the Otranto Shield for seamanship, the Pakistan Shield for sporting performance and Flight 4 the winner of the Collins Trophy.\n\nCoinciding with the return home, a promotion of outgoing CO Commander Andrew Pepper was held, with a subsequent change of command ceremony.\n\nNew CO Commander Brown said she already felt proud and protective of Hobart and her crew, and was especially humbled to share the handover ceremony with so many Hobart family members.\n\n“Thank you for welcoming my family and me to the wider Hobart family,” she said.\n\n“I am looking forward to continuing the great legacy of the ‘green ghost’ with you.”\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n."
