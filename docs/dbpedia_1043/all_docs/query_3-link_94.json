        "text": "29 October\n\nSmall boat crews find a dock at sea\n\nThe waters off the east coast of Malaysia in mid-October were abuzz with small boats from the Royal Australian Navy, the United Kingdom and Malaysia, with HMAS Canberraâs dock central to the training. The small-boat training was conducted during Exercise Bersama Gold 21 (BG21). Canberraâs deputy amphibious operations officer Captain Ashley Busatto said the training was important. âFor us, the integration with foreign forces is always something worth exercising,â Captain Busatto said. âIn particular, the small boats were coming from vessels that donât regularly train with amphibious ships with a well dock, so it was a positive learning experience for them. More..... 29 October\n\nNavy surgeon enjoying time in the sand\n\nA deployment to Iraq is providing Navy neurosurgeon Lieutenant Commander Andrew Davidson with some unique challenges. Lieutenant Commander Davidson is part of a highly specialised team of seven ADF medical professionals who are caring for US Military and Department of State personnel, Australian and coalition forces, and host-nation soldiers in Iraq from 23 outlying stations. Lieutenant Commander Andrew Davidson is working with his triservice colleagues in the role 3 hospital at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Centre (BDSC). He is deployed on Operation Okra in the Middle East for four months. More..... 29 October\n\nSpecial Operations land on Sydney beaches\n\nAustralian Army Special Operations Force trainee commandos quietly dropped in on the Sydney beachside suburbs of Cronulla and Manly. The activities were part of a series of essential training to reinforce Army's Special Operations Force ranks.\n\n29 October\n\nNew era in fleet maintenance\n\nA call for tenders has been issued for a capability life-cycle manager (CLCM) to maintain Navyâs Hobart-class destroyers. The Hobart-class destroyers will be the first major class of ship to be sustained through a CLCM arrangement, which has been timed to support the Hobart-class destroyer upgrade project. This is a significant milestone for Plan Galileo, which is a response to the Australian Governmentâs National Naval Shipbuilding Enterprise that will provide the nation with its greatest naval capability regeneration since World War II. Plan Galileo will ensure the significantly larger and more complex fleet that will result is effectively sustained. More..... 28 October\n\nNew jamming tech proving successful\n\nDefence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is working with South Australian start-up, RFTEQ, to develop jammer technologies capable of defeating radio-controlled improvised explosive devices and other communication threats. The partnership is already yielding promising results, with the development of the Complex Adaptive Threat Jammer Technology (CATJAT). Integrating DSTG-designed and developed countermeasure techniques with RFTEQâs cutting-edge digital signal processing algorithms, CATJAT is able to detect and identify advanced radio waveforms in real time, and then generate precise, targeted jamming responses to neutralise the threats. More..... 28 October\n\nFisheries patrol strengthens relationship\n\nHMAS Ararat recently completed Ausindo Corpat 2021, a five-day coordinated patrol with Indonesian Navy vessels KRI Sura and Kerapu along the shared maritime border. Commanding Officer HMAS Ararat Lieutenant Commander David Martinussen said this, the 11th iteration of Ausindo Corpat, was a welcome opportunity to strengthen bilateral ties with Indonesia, while delivering a strong and coordinated response to illegal fisheries activity. âThe tactical manoeuvring of warships in close quarters is a tried and true means of developing self-confidence in our people,â Lieutenant Commander Martinussen said. More..... 28 October\n\nAgile, innovative and resilient in pandemic\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy Recruit School at HMAS Cerberus, Victoria, is responsible for providing the Navy with trained, confident sailors that can think for themselves and work as a team. Staff and instructors are in charge of training up to 450 recruits at one time, with a new intake of up to 150 recruits arriving from all over Australia every four weeks. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges faced have been wide-ranging. COVID-19 restrictions, lockdowns and border closures have threatened the ability to deliver the high-quality training that the school is well known for.

The crew and naval organisations needed to support and oversee the SSN were considered in my second post. Here, I review some of the training and education structures, before summarising the total personnel requirement for phase 1, the starting point for a transition to SSNs. It is assumed that the RAN will be given the requisite access to the training schools of the navy that supplies our submarines and access to their boats for at-sea training until it has established sufficient capacity in Australia. This is a significant undertaking for the supplier navy. At-sea training billets are always in high demand, so adding the conversion and ab initio training required for the RAN will be a significant imposition even without considering the security and other national issues that could arise. More..... 26 October\n\nOp-ed for AFR Defence special\n\nAustralians are rightly concerned about tensions in the Indo-Pacific. As we confront a more uncertain region than we have known in decades, new energy and determination is flowing through Australiaâs defence ecosystem. Defence is getting on with its core business. That business is about making the right capability decisions and ensuring the Australian Defence Force is properly equipped to defend our nationâs interests and keep Australians safe. That business also involves Australia working with like-minded countries in a network of complementary partnerships. Nations which are equally committed to deterring aggression, preventing military conflict and preserving the peace which has, and continues to benefit all humanity. More..... 26 October\n\nNUSHIP Stalwart to call Geraldton home\n\nThe City of Greater Geraldton can today be confirmed as the ceremonial homeport of a supply ship set to be commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy Fleet next month. Minister for Defence Industry and Member for Durack Melissa Price said NUSHIP Stalwartâs formalised partnership with the City of Greater Geraldton and the local Yamatji People would strengthen Geraldtonâs enduring connection with the Navy. âNavy and Geraldton have a long, shared history,â Minister Price said. âGeraldton is home to a memorial acknowledging that HMAS Sydney II was sunk off the coast in 1941, and two ships have previously been named after the City. More..... 26 October\n\nMaking the shift to nuclear-powered submarines: technical skills and oversight\n\nby Peter Briggs\n\nIn my last post, I explained the need for dual lines of responsibility for nuclear safety, with civilian authorities answerable to a minister other than the minister for defence to provide a degree of independence in discharging the governmentâs nuclear safety obligations. The Royal Australian Navy and Department of Defence are answerable to the defence minister. The submarineâs crew is the obvious starting point. A British Astute-class nuclear-powered attack submarine (SSN) crew of 98 is almost double that of Australiaâs Collins-class conventional submarines. We will need to train about 30 relief crew members to ensure we can sustain each submarine with a complement of at least 130 nuclear-qualified personnel. New skills are required for the nuclear technicians operating the reactor and for steam plant operators. More..... 26 October\n\nTeam an anaesthesia to challenges\n\nNavy medical officer Lieutenant Commander Lin Hu is currently deployed with his triservice colleagues to the only role 3 hospital in the Iraq area of operations. He is embedded with the US Armyâs Task Force Med 9 at the Baghdad Diplomatic Support Centre. Born and raised in Fairfield Western Sydney, Lieutenant Commander Hu, an anaesthetist, is providing specialist surgical and medical support to US, coalition, Iraqi Security Forces, Department of State personnel and 23 outlying stations within the region. âOur team is responsible for neurosurgical, head and neck, orthopaedic and trauma surgical care, as well as the management of critically unwell COVID-19 patients,â Lieutenant Commander Hu said. More..... 25 October\n\nSo close, but so far...\n\nSailing into Manila Bay during Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2021 (IPE21) was a slightly bittersweet moment for two Navy officers who longed to visit the country of their birth. With no port visits during IPE21 because of COVID-19 restrictions, Lieutenant Christian Aca-Ac and Lieutenant Maria Hondrade, along with other members of the crews of HMA Ships Canberra, Sirius and Anzac, could only look at the Philippines. Instead, IPE21 conducted a number of virtual engagements on topics of interest to Australia and regional partners, and commanders participated by video in an official reception welcoming the Australian deployment. More..... 25 October\n\nMaking the shift to nuclear-powered submarines: safety first\n\nby Peter Briggs\n\nThe agreement for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) is the most significant part of the recent AUKUS announcement. The offer of assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States to acquire this capability places us at an excellent starting point for what will be a challenging national journey. Such a combination of support was inconceivable five years ago when I began publicly agitating for SSNs. Today it is the right strategic decision to meet the changing circumstances facing Australia and its Western allies. It will ensure that our submarine crews have safer, more survivable and hugely more effective submarines. More..... 25 October\n\nMine hunters put to the test\n\nThe Port of Fremantle and its Indian Ocean accesses have been blocked by an adversaryâs offensive mining tactics. This is the scenario Exercise Dugong 2021 participants face over the coming weeks. Exercise Dugong 2021 (DG21) has kicked off in Western Australia and will run until November 5. Partnering with the United States Navyâs Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team Five (EODMU5), mine warfare and maritime geospatial specialists from across the Royal Australian Navy have come together to integrate existing and emerging mine warfare systems, technologies and practices. DG21 Exercise Director Captain Pete Bartlett said the importance of Navyâs mine warfare capability should not be underestimated. More..... 25 October\n\nLibrary's new chapter has positive sub-plot\n\nA new shipâs library in HMAS Warramunga is not only providing the crew with a wide range of reading options, it has forged a strong partnership with a bookseller near the ship's home port in Western Australia. Leading Seaman James McPhail, a member of the Anzac-class frigateâs welfare committee, decided to establish a shipâs library after developing a strong reading habit on a deployment last year. More..... 25 October\n\nTinkering drives Navy career\n\nGrowing up on a farm outside the regional NSW town of Trangie, Able Seaman Maddison Hohnberg would spend hours tinkering with farm machinery and trying to understand how things work. That tinkering and curiosity now serves her well in her role as a propulsion maintainer in HMAS Warramunga, specialising in diesel mechanics. The Anzac-class frigate is currently on a regional presence deployment to South-East and north-east Asia with HMA Ships Ballarat and Brisbane. Able Seaman Hohnberg is part of the team responsible for maintaining the shipâs two propulsion diesel engines, four diesel generators and gas turbine. More..... 22 October\n\nOctober Update on HMAS Cerberus Redevelopment\n\nHMAS Cerberus Redevelopment Project Officer, Commander Cameron Eastman OAM RAN provides the latest video update on the progress of works currently underway.\n\n22 October\n\nRoyal Navy tests Martlet Missile System for Defense Against Swarm Attacks\n\nA new missile system meant to protect the UKâs new aircraft carriers from attacks by swarms of small boats has been successfully tested by the Royal Navy. HMS Defenderâs Wildcat helicopter launched the Martlet lightweight missile against an inflatable target in the sea during operations in the Pacific Ocean with the UK Carrier Strike Group. It is the first time this type of missile has been launched on frontline operations by the Royal Navy after rigorous testing at ranges off the UK coast by the Yeovilton-based Wildcat Maritime Force last year. In 0.3 seconds, the missile detached from the Wildcat HMA Mk2 helicopter, accelerating to one and a half times the speed of sound towards its target. More..... 22 October\n\nU.S. and German navies sail at sea together\n\nIndependence-variant littoral combat ships USS Jackson (LCS 6) and USS Tulsa (LCS 16) sailed with Germany Navy frigate FGS Bayern (F 217) in the Philippine Sea, and Tulsa hosted Bayern crew members for ship tours while moored at Naval Base Guam, Oct. 18 and 21, the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet announced. At sea, the ships practiced communications, tactical maneuvers, division tactics, and bilateral flight operations with Jacksonâs embarked MH-60S Seahawk helicopter from Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) Squadron 23 and two German Super Lynx Mk88A helicopter from Bayern. More..... 22 October\n\nGuests back on the upper deck for Trafalgar Day ceremony\n\nSecond Sea Lord Vice Admiral Nick Hine led Trafalgar Day commemorations on board HMS Victory marking todayâs 216th anniversary of the battle. The day started at HM Naval Base Portsmouth, as always, with the daily naval ceremony of Colours at 8am; the White Ensign and the Union Flag hauled up, followed shortly afterwards by the flag sequence indicating Nelsonâs famous battle message to the fleet: âEngland expects that every man will do his dutyâ. The private ceremony followed shortly after on the upper deck.

Itâs not unusual for Army medical staff to work in landing helicopter dock ships such as Canberra as the Royal Australian Navy doesnât employ pharmacists, scientific officers, radiographers or physiotherapists. The Army team â two members of the shipâs company and four IPE21 embarked staff â is on board to ensure the crewâs health is maintained.

More..... 12 October\n\nSaving Taiwan\n\nChinaâs coercive expansionism may be taking its most dangerous turn yet. Recently, record-breaking numbers of Chinese military planes have entered Taiwanâs air defence identification zone, where the islandâs authorities assert the right to demand that aircraft identify themselves. Chinaâs muscle-flexing sends a clear message: it is serious about incorporating the islandâand âreunifyingâ Chinaâpotentially by force. Though the international community has been reluctant to challenge the Chinese claim that Taiwan has âalways beenâ part of China, the claim is dubious, at best, and based on revisionist history. For most of its history, Taiwan was inhabited by non-Chinese peoplesâMalayo-Polynesian tribesâand had no relationship with China. Geographically, Taiwan is closer to the Philippines than to the Chinese mainland.

Here, at a former tourist resort on Chinaâs northern coast, is where the PLAN is developing some of its most secretive, and previously unreported, naval programs, USNI News has learned. The pier near Dalian is where China is testing its large uncrewed surface vessels (USVs), according to satellite photos provided to USNI News by Maxar and an analysis of open-source intelligence. Construction of the new pier started in early 2016 and took about a year, according to satellite photos. Since then it has been used intermittently by the PLAN. When in use, two large work barges are moored alongside to provide basic facilities for crews and support staff. The facility itself has only the most basic semblance of a military base. Taken together this suggests that it is an auxiliary facility, used to support short-term trials and exercises.

The U.S. military is concerned about the Yasen submarine class. Several months ago, the U.S. Navyâs top submarine officer, Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, remarked, âWeâll be facing against really formidable adversaries.â One need look to Russiaâs version of a nuclear-guided missile submarine, the Severodvinsk [first vessel of the Yasen class] (SSGN). âHe was so impressed with this ship that he made a replica using unclassified data to view it every day on his way to work.â Krasnoyarsk is the third Project 885-M ship built by the Russian Navy.

He joined the Navy on the 17th March 1952 and following completion of his initial training at HMAS Cerberus his first posting as a seaman was to HMAS Australia.\n\nIt was late 1954, Jake was 19 years old, married, an Able Seaman employed as a Main Gate Sentry at Naval Headquarters at Potts Point, not making enough money to pay his wifeâs medical bills and short on answers to the situation. He spent every second night working in Playfairs freezers in The Rocks and life did not hold a lot of promise.\n\nThen on the notice board at HMAS Kuttabul there was a message calling for volunteers to form the first Clearance Divers Course, and offering tuppence (two pence) or 1 cent a minute for diving time. This was the answer; tuppence a minute translated into 120 pence an hour or 10 shillings ($1). In short, if accepted, he could give up his job at Playfairs and meet his financial commitments. Naturally he volunteered and was accepted. However, there was just one hurdle and that was a test dive off the wharf at HMAS Rushcutter, using the Salvus Fire Fighting Apparatus rigged for diving, and wearing a suit aptly named âThe Clammy Deathâ. Jake remembers surfacing and complaining that his throat was burning and was promptly persuaded to go down again by a push from the boot of the Supervisor.\n\nContinued in our Hero section 08 October\n\nStatement regarding USS Connecticut (SSN 22)\n\nUSS Connecticut (SSN 22) struck an object while submerged on the afternoon of Oct. 2, while operating in international waters in the Indo-Pacific region. There are no life threatening injuries. The submarine remains in a safe and stable condition. USS Connecticutâs nuclear propulsion plant and spaces were not affected and remain fully operational. The extent of damage to the remainder of the submarine is being assessed. The U.S. Navy has not requested assistance. The incident will be investigated. 08 October\n\nKeeping watch on wellbeing at sea\n\nThe shipâs company of HMAS Anzac has spent a lot of time at sea over the past 12 months, making keeping watch on their health and wellbeing important. The crew has been involved in two regional presence deployments, the rescue and return of 20 Indonesian fishermen stranded off the West Coast of Australia, and Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2021 (IPE21). While one of the key functions of IPE21 is to build relationships with regional partners, Commanding Officer Anzac Commander David McPherson said he first aims to maintain the health and wellbeing of his crew members so they function as an effective unit. More..... 08 October\n\nTuning in to new technology\n\nA junior sailor serving in the submarine HMAS Sheean has developed a more reliable method of delivering radio communications that could bring major benefits to the fleet for years to come. Able Seaman Nathan Mayfield took a fresh look at the current fleet-wide high frequency (HF) radio procedures used by the crews of ships to communicate with each other and realised they were not being used to their full potential. Able Seaman Mayfieldâs ideas revolved around a radio technology called 3G ALE (Third Generation Automatic Link Establishment), which provides more robust HF communications that could potentially be used when regular satellite communication links are down. More..... 07 October\n\nBuilding relationships at sea and virtually\n\nAustralia and Brunei have continued to develop their defence and whole-of-government relationship with a number of activities held at sea and virtually as part of Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2021 (IPE21).
