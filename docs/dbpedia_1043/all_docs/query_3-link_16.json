        "text": "The arrival of the Australian Fleet into Sydney Harbour, for October 1913.\n\nWhy was the arrival of the RAN’s first fleet important?\n\nThe fleet entry of 1913 meant Australia now had a credible ocean-going fleet. The fleet’s arrival signified the final realisation of the recently established RAN. The Minister for Defence, Senator Edward Millen, declared, “Since Captain Cook’s arrival, no more memorable event has happened than the advent of the Australian fleet. As the former marked the birth of Australia, so the latter announces its coming of age.” The fleet entry was indeed a significant achievement, as prior to 1913 Australia had largely relied on Britain’s Royal Navy for its naval defence.\n\nThe protection of Australian waters has formed an essential part of the nation’s approach to strategic defence since colonial times. A strong navy was needed not just to deter potential threats by foreign powers, but also to protect the extensive shipping routes and trade centres upon which Australia’s economy depended from pirates and raiders.\n\nThis naval defence was paid for by Great Britain. However, since the Napoleonic wars of the early nineteenth century, Britain had been downsizing the Royal Navy – a policy felt particularly in outlying colonies like Australia. With the dangers posed by increasing Russian naval power, demonstrated during the Crimean War, many colonists felt that the naval protection of Australia should be given more priority.\n\nIn response to appeals made by Australian colonial ministers in 1859, Britain gave Australia its own permanent Naval Station and Squadron, thereby recognising Australia’s distinct territorial significance and its strategic concerns.\n\nHowever, the British Government wished to discourage the development of colonial navies. It was clear to the British Admiralty that a more effective naval scheme would be for the colonies to contribute money to be put towards maintaining the Royal Navy.\n\nWhile many colonists argued over how much should be contributed, several of the colonies, particularly Victoria, enthusiastically pursued the building of their own naval defence forces. In 1865, the British government passed the Colonial Naval Defence Act, which at last granted the colonies formal approval to assemble, sustain, and operate ships and personnel for self-defence, and to establish a force of volunteers to form part of the Royal Naval Reserve.\n\nHowever, paying for it all proved more difficult. In 1859 the British government had stationed a small force of Royal Navy warships in Sydney Harbour known as the Australian Squadron. And so, in 1887, in the face of the inability of the colonies to adequately fund and man their own navies, this Australian Squadron was augmented by the Auxiliary Squadron to address the need for a well-maintained and well-trained sea-going navy. These additional Royal Navy vessels were managed by the Commander in Chief of the Australia Station, and could not be redeployed elsewhere without the consent of the colonial government. Although costs were shared between Britain and Australia, this was nevertheless a further step towards the creation of a recognisably Australian navy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, many Australian politicians and naval commanders, such as Vice Admiral William Creswell, believed that a homogenous national navy was essential to meet the unique needs of the colonies. As an extensive island continent, wholly reliant upon the sea for communication and trade, Australia was especially vulnerable without a formidable navy. With Federation in 1901, the colonial navies of each Australian state united to become the Commonwealth Naval Forces, and the fledgling Australian navy was born. The Australian government became responsible for protecting its citizens and territory, even if imperial support was still required for blue-water defence.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the naval vessels in the Australian colonies had deteriorated in the late nineteenth century, particularly in the face of the developing naval arms race between Britain and Germany which drove rapid technological advances in ships and equipment. The Commonwealth Naval Forces inherited a fleet that was quickly becoming obsolete – made worse by the removal of the Auxiliary Squadron in 1902­–03 and the replacement of the ships of the Australian Squadron with inferior vessels in 1905.\n\nIn Australia, debate raged over these unpopular measures, but it unfolded against a background of the sense of loyal cooperation and reliance that many felt for the mother country. Affordability, practicality, strategic defence policies, national interests and ownership all came into play. As Australian representatives, including Creswell, recommended changes to Australia’s naval capability, the pressure on the Admiralty to reduce expenditure led Britain to concede that Australia should obtain ships which would ease their reliance on the Royal Navy.\n\nThe British increasingly concentrated their resources on the German threat, so it was hardly surprising that the need for a self-contained Australian Fleet Unit was raised again at the Imperial Conference of 1909. In the midst of increasing Japanese, American and Chinese influence in the region, the Admiralty acknowledged that the best option was for Australia to manage its own Fleet Unit. And so it was agreed that the Australia Station, and the Imperial dockyards and shore establishments, would be transferred to the Commonwealth.\n\nThe final stages of the RAN’s development were in motion. The Australian Naval Defence Act of 1910 provided the legislative authority for the navy, allowing for the establishment of training establishments, a Board of Administration, and provisions for service conditions. The construction of ships was quickly arranged. The first ships, HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Yarra, arrived in Australia in 1910.\n\nOn 4 October 1913, the RAN finally displayed the new fleet to the Australian public in Sydney. Thousands of people came out to view the fleet. As one of the first national institutions of significance since Federation, the fleet was a striking symbol that Australia was now a self-determining, self-reliant nation. The flagship was named HMAS Australia, to avoid preferential treatment of a particular state. It led HMA Ships Melbourne, Sydney, Encounter, Warrego, Parramatta and Yarra into Sydney Harbour. The formation of the RAN and its fleet –funded and managed by Australians, for Australians – was widely recognised as signalling Australia’s maturity as a self-governing nation.\n\nSince that time, the RAN fleet has served the Australian people in numerous military campaigns and by performing numerous peacekeeping and aid missions around the globe. Locally, the RAN endeavours to protect our fisheries, habitats, and other resources, and to provide general border security.\n\nThe International Fleet Review of 2013 will symbolise a century of Australia’s naval fleet in operation. In the words of The Singleton Argus, 4 October 1913, “That our fleet may never be called upon to engage in battle is the wish and prayer of all, but we recognise that even should they never fire a shot, they will have done their duty.”\n\nInternational Fleet Review of 2013\n\nDetails on the International Fleet Review of 2013 can be found on the Royal Australian Navy’s International Fleet Review site:\n\nhttp://www.navy.gov.au/ifr/\n\nSearch the Memorial’s Collections\n\nThe Australian War Memorial holds naval material from the period which may be useful to researchers.\n\nAWM266\n\nThe Official Records series AWM266: Australian Naval Force (ANF) Engagement and Service Records, 1903–1911, contain details of approximately 1,700 Australian and New Zealand sailors during the period after Federation and immediately before the formation of the Royal Australian Navy. It consists of 41 folders of forms for engagement or re-engagement in the Royal Navy and two large bound volumes of personnel service records. The engagement forms for each individual serving in the Australian Naval Force (ANF) between 1903 and 1911 includes the following information:\n\nThe ships they served on\n\nDate and place of birth\n\nA personal description including trade or occupation and scars and tattoos.\n\nA note on any previous service history\n\nThe Memorial plans to digitise the engagement and re-engagement forms, and to make them available on the Memorial’s website in the near future.\n\nPrivate Records\n\nThere are numerous records in the Memorial’s collection which provide details on the daily tasks and duties of early naval personnel and also on the movement of early Australian vessels. Some collection highlights include:\n\nPR03295 – Little, Vivian Agincourt Spence (Chaplain)\n\n1DRL/0669 – Seabrook, John William (Leading Signalman, HMAS Sydney I)\n\nPR02076 – Gedling, Stanley Alfred (Leading Signalman), 1894–1969\n\nNumerous records relating to Captain John Glossop (HMAS Sydney) and Commander Rupert Garsia (HMAS Sydney) and the Sydney–Emden fight of November 1914.\n\nPhotographs and other items can be searched using the Memorial’s collection database:\n\n/search/collections/\n\nSea Power Centre\n\nThe Sea Power Centre is an independent research centre which aims to inspire and nurture development of maritime strategic thought by providing intellectual rigour to the public debate on maritime strategy and other maritime issues. It researches the history of the Royal Australian Navy and displays some of this history on its website:\n\nhttps://www.navy.gov.au/spc-a\n\nSources\n\nTom Frame, No pleasure cruise: the story of the Royal Australian Navy , Allen & Unwin, Crows Nest, NSW, 2004\n\nArthur W.
