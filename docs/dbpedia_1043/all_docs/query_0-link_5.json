Established in 1911, the RAN was formed out of the Commonwealth Naval Forces to become the small navy of Australia after federation, consisting of the former colonial navies of the new Australian states. The Royal Navy of the United Kingdom continued to provide blue-water defence in the Pacific until World War II, when expansion of the RAN saw the acquisition of aircraft carriers, and other large surface vessels.\n\nAfter World War II, the RAN was focussed on forward defence in South East Asia, therefore the RAN was structure to provide a carrier battle group to a NATO, or SEATO command. This was centred around the carrier HMAS Melbourne. After withdrawal from Vietnam, Australia changed its focus to a Two-Ocean Navy which would operate indpendently in home defence.\n\nThis was to be focussed around 2 carrier battle groups (one for the Pacific Ocean, the other for the Indian Ocean) with 4 large destroyers (the term 'cruiser' was avoided for political reasons, however the ships sought had a displacement of over 9000 tons), patrol vessels in the North, and submarines for survellance, interdiction, and special forces support. This led to an expansion and modernisation of the RAN.\n\nIn the event, the 'large destroyers' were not proceeded with until the mid-1990s, by which time they were ordered as Guided Missile Cruisers\n\nThe Daring class destroyers to be replaced and the Perth class guided missile destroyers were to be supplemented by a new guided missile destroyers. The new destroyers, the Ballarat class, were based on the British Type 42 destroyer, but with American weapons, and a different layout.\n\nTwo frigate roles were defined, escort and patrol. The RAN determined that to fulfill both roles, that at least 12 frigates were required. The patrol role was less important, and River class frigates were transferred to this role as Adelaide class frigates became available to replace them as escorts. The admission of New Zealand into the Commonwealth of Australia increased by frigate force by two ships, HMNZS Waikato and HMNZS Canterbury, which were similar to the RAN's existing River class destroyer escorts.\n\nBy 1990, the Royal Australian Navy had a substantial combat force force including:\n\n2 Australia class Aircraft Carriers (R)\n\n4 Ballarat class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG)\n\n3 Perth class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG)\n\n6 Adelaide class Guided Missile Frigates (FFG)\n\n6 River class Destroyer Escorts (DE)\n\n2 Leander class Frigates (F)\n\n6 Oberon class Submarines (SSG)\n\n15 Fremantle class patrol boats (PB)\n\nToday the RAN is one of the largest naval forces in the Pacific region and has a significant presence in the Indian Ocean, and has undertaken operations in support of military campaigns and peacekeeping missions worldwide.\n\nToday's fleet consists of around 60 vessels including cruisers, destroyers, frigates, submarines, patrol boats and auxiliary ships. The RAN today is one of the most modern in the Pacific and is tasked with the ability to defend Australian waters and undertake operations in distant locations.\n\nThe RAN's major ships are derivatives of Western designs. They frequently include Australian improvements, for example, the Adelaide class Frigates are based on the American Oliver Hazard Perry frigates, but include such improvements as an 8-cell Mk 41 VLS for Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles. Unlike American ships, they retained their Mk 13 launchers, the capabilities of which are extended by the integration of SM-2MR, and Harpoon Block II.\n\nAustralia's Hobart class cruisers are Australian made conbatants based on the American Ticonderoga class. They are considered among the most powerful surface combatants in the world.\n\nThe ANZAC class Frigates were originally intended as light patrol frigates by the Labor government of the late 1980's, but have been progressively upgraded. Upgrades include adding an extra 8 Mk 41 VLS cells (bringing the total to 16), adding 8 Harpoon launchers, and a new mine avoidance system. An active phased array radar is slated for installation from 2009.\n\nThe RAN has two primary bases for its fleet;\n\nFleet Base East, which is located at HMAS Kuttabul near Sydney, NSW.\n\nFleet Base West, located at HMAS Stirling near Perth, WA.\n\nIn addition, there are three other ports which are home to the majority of the RAN's minor war vessels (patrol craft, mine warfare craft);\n\nHMAS Coonawarra, at Darwin, NT.\n\nHMAS Cairns, at Cairns, QLD.\n\nHMNZS Philomel, at Devonport, NZ.\n\nVice Admiral Sir Russ Shalders, AK is the current Chief of the Naval Staff and was appointed to this position in 2005.\n\nAll Royal Australian Navy ships and shore stations use the prefix Her Majesty's Australian Ship. Some shore establishments in New Zealand retained the designation Her Majesty's New Zealand Ship, but all warships were redesignated in 1988.\n\nCombat organisation[]\n\nThe surface fleet is organised into two Carrier Battle Groups (CBG East, and CBG West), each based on an Australia class aircraft carrier, and four Surface Action Groups (SAG Alpha, SAG Bravo, SAG Charlie, SAG Delta), each based on a Hobart class cruiser. Each battle group has a Battle class destroyer, and one or two frigates assigned\n\nCurrent Fleet[]\n\n(see Ship profiles page)\n\nMajor Combatants[]\n\n2 Australia class Aircraft Carriers (R) [1]\n\nHMAS Australia\n\nHMAS Vengeance\n\n4 Hobart class Guided Missile Cruisers (CG) [2]\n\nHMAS Hobart\n\nHMAS Brisbane\n\nHMAS Perth\n\nHMAS Achilles\n\nDestroyers[]\n\n3 Battle class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG) [3]\n\nHMAS Gallipoli\n\nHMAS Long Tan\n\nHMAS Coral Sea\n\n4 Ballarat class Guided Missile Destroyers (DDG) [4]\n\nHMAS Ballarat\n\nHMAS Toowoomba\n\nHMAS Lismore\n\nHMAS Goulbourn\n\nFrigates[]\n\n10 ANZAC class Frigates (FFH) [5]\n\nHMAS ANZAC\n\nHMAS Te Kaha\n\nHMAS Arunta\n\nHMAS Te Mana\n\nHMAS Warramunga\n\nHMAS Stuart\n\nHMAS Parramatta\n\nHMAS Blackpool\n\nHMAS Otago\n\nHMAS Waikato\n\n6 Adelaide class Guided Missile Frigates (FFG) [6]\n\nHMAS Adelaide\n\nHMAS Canberra\n\nHMAS Sydney\n\nHMAS Darwin\n\nHMAS Melbourne\n\nHMAS Newcastle\n\nMinor Combatants[]\n\n16 Armidale class Patrol Boats (PB) [7]\n\nHMAS Armidale\n\nHMAS Larrakia\n\nHMAS Bathurst\n\nHMAS Albany\n\nHMAS Pirie\n\nHMAS Maitland\n\nHMAS Ararat\n\nHMAS Broome\n\nHMAS Bundaberg\n\nHMAS Wollongong\n\nHMAS Childers\n\nHMAS Launceston\n\nHMAS Hawea\n\nHMAS Pukaki\n\nHMAS Rotoiti\n\nHMAS Taupo\n\n4 Pacific class Light Patrol Boats (PBL) [8]\n\nHMAS Tarangau\n\nHMAS Dreger\n\nHMAS Seeadler\n\nHMAS Basilisk\n\n6 Huon class minehunters (MHC) [9]\n\nHMAS Huon\n\nHMAS Hawkesbury\n\nHMAS Norman\n\nHMAS Gascoyne\n\nHMAS Diamantina\n\nHMAS Yarra\n\nSubmarines[]\n\n8 Collins class Submarines (SSG) [10]\n\nHMAS Collins\n\nHMAS Farncomb\n\nHMAS Waller\n\nHMAS Dechaineux\n\nHMAS Sheean\n\nHMAS Rankin\n\nHMAS Goldsworthy\n\nHMAS Osborne\n\nAmphibious Warfare Ships[]\n\n2 Wellington class Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) [11]\n\nHMAS Wellington\n\nHMAS Auckland\n\n3 Manoora class Landing Platform Dock (LPD) [12]\n\nHMAS Manoora\n\nHMAS Kanimbla\n\nHMAS Tobruk\n\n8 Balikpapan class Landing Craft, Heavy (LCH) [13]\n\nHMAS Balikpapan\n\nHMAS Brunei\n\nHMAS Labuan\n\nHMAS Tarakan\n\nHMAS Wewak\n\nHMAS Salamaua\n\nHMAS Buna\n\nHMAS Betano\n\nFleet Auxiliaries[]\n\n2 Success class Replenishment Oilers (AOR) [14]\n\nHMAS Success\n\nHMAS Endurance\n\n1 Fleet Oiler (AO) [15]\n\nHMAS Sirius\n\n1 Fleet Oiler (AO) [16]\n\nHMAS Endeavour\n\n1 Sail Training Ship (IX)\n\nSTS Young Endeavour [17]\n\n3 Leeuwin class ocean survey vessels (AGS) [18]\n\nHMAS Leeuwin\n\nHMAS Melville\n\nHMAS Monowai\n\n6 Paluma class coastal survey vessels (SML) [19]\n\nHMAS Paluma\n\nHMAS Mermaid\n\nHMAS Shepparton\n\nHMAS Benalla\n\nHMAS Resolution\n\nHMAS Tui\n\n1 Diving Tender (A) [20]\n\nHMAS Manawanui\n\nFleet Air Arm[]\n\nsee main article: Fleet Air Arm\n\nThe Fleet Air Arm (more formally known as the Australian Navy Aviation Group) is the operational part of the Royal Australian Navy responsible for the operation of aircraft aboard ship.

Blue cotton drill shirts (called Action Working Dress) and trousers can also be worn (generally ashore, grey tends to be worn on ship).\n\nClearance Divers are involved in ground combat, and therefore wear DPCU, or DPDU as their working dress. Other naval personnel are issued DPCU and DPDU as required.\n\nGrey coveralls and AWD are being replaced with a fire retardant variation on DPCU called Disruptive Pattern Naval Uniform (DPNU).
