        "text": "On 20 March 2019, following an invitation from Vice Admiral (and Professor) Peter David Jones, AO, DSC (ret.) of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to take part in interviews about the history of the Coastwatchers – who were founded and headed by RAN Commander Eric Feldt – I flew to Canberra (and back later that same day).\n\nI was met by Peter at the airport gate, and he kindly hosted me for the whole day. Initially, we toured the Australian Defence Force Academy and the adjacent Royal Military College, Duntroon. Amazing! Almost a city in itself!\n\nThe two separate one-hour interviews, focused on the history of the Coastwatchers, were conducted by Commander Alastair Cooper, Deputy Director of the Sea Power Centre – Australia. Those interviewed were Dr Betty Lee (grandniece of Commander Feldt), Vice Admiral Peter Jones (ret.), John Perryman (Director of Strategic and Historical Studies at the Sea Power Centre – Australia), and myself.\n\nWhile I answered many questions during the interview, those of particular note included the following information: When the subject of the Battle of the Coral Sea was addressed, it gave me the opportunity to mention the momentous contribution of the Coastwatchers, as recorded by the US war historian James Duffy, that two Coastwatchers observed and reported to Headquarters that a Japanese armada with 5,000 troops was in passage to invade and occupy Port Moresby in early May 1942. As a direct result, allied warships met the Japanese in the Battle of the Coral Sea and inflicted a defeat that forced a Japanese retreat to Rabaul.\n\nThe ramifications of this first repulse of the Japanese in the southern hemisphere were incalculable. The capture of Port Moresby by the Japanese would have virtually severed US support for Australia, enabling Port Moresby to be used as a bomber base by the Japanese to attack Australia, and the courageous Australian troops would not have been able to launch their Port Moresby offensive to defend against, and ultimately defeat, the land-based thrust of the Japanese on the Kokoda Track.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese and the United States fought a six-month long battle of attrition for control of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, during which the Americans came perilously close to defeat at times. Again, a US defeat at Guadalcanal would have left Australia isolated. However, once more, Australian Coastwatchers played a vital role in the defence of Guadalcanal – by routinely signalling warnings of Japanese aerial attacks on the island so that US forces were in position to defend most effectively against each attack – and thus played a key role in the ultimate American success at Guadalcanal.\n\nSubsequently, as flagged by the interviewer, Commander Alastair Cooper, the official acknowledgement by the five-star US Admiral of the Fleet, William F. ‘Bull’ Halsey, was brief and poignant when he declared ‘The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific.’\n\nHad Port Moresby and Guadalcanal fallen, the outcome would have been dire! The Allied Supreme Commander, General Douglas MacArthur, would have been constrained to recapturing these key southern hemisphere bases, thus precluding him from redeploying his forces to prosecute his successful execution of the island-hopping campaign north of the Equator to reach and reoccupy the Philippines before using Tinian Island as his base to launch the atom bombs to end the war with Japan.\n\nAn interesting side-issue raised during the interview related to the rescue of US Navy Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, whose Patrol Torpedo boat PT109 was carved in two and destroyed by a Japanese warship in the waters of the Solomon Islands one night. After the sinking, the Lieutenant and his crew reached Kolombangara Island by swimming, where they spent days starving, before being located by Coastwatcher Sub-Lieutenant Reg Evans who organized their rescue. Many years later, President Kennedy entertained Evans at the White House!\n\nFollowing the interview we had lunch in the Naval Commanders dining room after which I was presented by Commodore Peter James Leavy CSM, RAN, Commandant of the Australian Defence Force Academy, with a very nice A3 sized framed letter of thanks (see below) from Vice Admiral Michael Joseph Noonan, AO, Chief of Navy who thanked me ‘for your service to your nation’.\n\nAfter lunch I was scheduled to make a presentation about the activities of the Coastwatchers to a group of midshipmen (using a USB with a collection of photos of my experiences). None of them had even heard of the Coastwatchers, so it was rewarding to answer their questions. Using the prompt letters of ‘TLC’ (for ‘thelastcoastwatcher’), I also invited them to look at this website if interested.\n\nFinally, Peter took me to the Australian War Memorial, where I was shown the names of my two brothers (Bob and Tom – my twin), who failed to return home from Rabaul, enshrined on the great Wall of Honour. I was somewhat upset as I remembered them. I was also very moved when a little 7 year old girl left her school group to come over to thank me for my service, and shake my hand!\n\nWe were also fortunate to ‘run into’ The Hon Dr Brendan Nelson AO BMBS FRACP (Hon) FAMA FRSN, Director of the Australian War Memorial, while we were there and Peter organized an introduction. We spent a few minutes chatting and a ‘hand shake’ photo was taken. Brendan’s renowned knowledge of Australia’s special forces history is one of his strong points as Director of the Memorial.\n\nI also briefly met up with Claire Hunter, who is the Australian War Memorial’s Features Writer, who wrote a fine article, which included many photos, about my Coastwatching experience in ‘We just had a job to do, and we did it’.\n\nOn the day, I also took the opportunity to pass a copy of my ‘flyer’ with the link to my website to the captains of the two planes that flew me to and from Canberra, and was then invited into the cockpits to have a chat! (Luckily, I didn’t have a bomb!) It was quite an experience to see all those clocks and dials etc staring at me!\n\nI am particularly appreciative of Vice Admiral Peter Jones for inviting me to be interviewed as I was keen to firmly establish that the Coastwatchers were RAN and not, as is generally believed, Army!\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed the comradeship of Peter, Betty Lee, Peter Leavy and Kus Pandey (Centre Manager, Australian Centre for the Study of Armed Conflict and Society at UNSW Canberra) throughout the day."
