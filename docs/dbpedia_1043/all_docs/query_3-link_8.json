        "text": "The Royal Australian Navy is the navy of the Commonwealth of Australia, formed upon the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901 as the Commonwealth Naval Forces. In 1911 the Permanent Naval Forces were granted the title of Royal Australian Navy, and the Citizen Naval Forces received the title of Royal Australian Naval Reserve.\n\nPrior to 1913, Australian waters fell under the protection of the forces assigned to the Royal Navy's Australian Station.

Eldon Manisty, Finance and Civil Member (and as Naval Secretary)\n\nUnder Statutory Rule No. 32 of 1911, which was backdated to 1 March, the powers and functions of the Naval Board in its relation to the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth were defined as:\n\nThe Naval Board shall, subject to the control of the Minister, be charged with the administration of all matters relating to the Naval Forces.
