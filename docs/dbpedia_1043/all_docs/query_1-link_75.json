        "text": "By Thom Seith, Center for Information Dominance Public Affairs\n\nThe recipient of the 2015 Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Chief of the Navy Fellowship toured the Center for Information Dominance (CID) June 22 as part of his navy's research into best practices for information warfare (IW).\n\nRAN Cmdr. Paul Kirk is conducting research focusing specifically on developing an information warfare strategy to support contemporary maritime operations in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe RAN Chief of Navy Fellowship is a research scholarship promoting development of professional mastery while conducting research on current and emergent naval issues, culminating with a research degree - a master's in philosophy.\n\nDuring his tour, Kirk saw and discussed the training systems and methodologies employed by the CID team. The visit included information warfare officer training, information professional and information systems technician overview, shipboard cryptologic technician technical training including the new version of the shipboard electronic warfare suite, information about the Joint Cyber Analysis Course (JCAC), Ship's Signal Exploitation Equipment (SSEE) system capabilities and fleet concentration area training.\n\n\"I am extremely impressed with the training delivered at CID Pensacola, and in particular the higher-level management of a very complex training regime,\" said Kirk. \"Not only is CID responsible for a very broad remit for courses and training objectives, it is also responsible for the delivery of those courses across a global customer base. The professionalism in which this is managed and achieved is simply outstanding.\"\n\nAccording to Kirk, sharing training methodology helps when the navies work together.\n\n\"As the Royal Australian Navy continues to investigate its own training requirements for information warfare, this visit to CID Pensacola is a critical step in providing the opportunity to see what best practice looks like,\" Kirk added. \"As long-time allied partners, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, the sharing of experiences in training is invaluable to ensuring that our two navies can continue to achieve high-levels of interoperability into the future.\"\n\nCommanding Officer of CID, Capt. Maureen Fox, noted this was an opportunity for Kirk to observe information warfare training systems that replicate what junior enlisted Sailors and officers employ in an operational environment.\n\n\"Today's visit illustrates that realistic training is essential in preparing our Sailors for their Navy mission and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to showcase the processes,\" said Fox. \"This visit allowed for a dynamic exchange of information on warfare training ideas and methodologies between the navies - always a welcome event.\"\n\nKirk concluded his visit by touring the CID command cryptologic display where artifacts and equipment containing the heritage, history and beginnings of the United States Navy's information warfare craft resides.\n\nThe Center for Information Dominance based at Corry Station in Pensacola, Florida, is the Navy's learning center that leads, manages and delivers Navy and joint forces training in information operations, information warfare, information technology, cryptology and intelligence.\n\nWith nearly 1,300 military, civilian and contracted staff members, CID provides training for approximately 24,000 members of the U.S. armed services and allied forces each year. CID oversees the development and administration of 226 courses at four commands, two detachments, and 14 learning sites throughout the United States and Japan."
