        "text": "During times of war and peace, the Navy has always had an important role shaping Australia.\n\nTake a look at some pivotal moments in our naval history.\n\nMarch 1, 1901\n\nLoading...\n\nTwo months after Federation, localised coastal defences comprised of gun batteries and naval forces are brought together to become the Commonwealth Naval Forces.\n\n1908\n\nAmerica's Great White Fleet - 16 battleships and several escort ships - visit Australia as part of its circumnavigation of the globe under the orders of president Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n1911\n\nThe Commonwealth's forces are granted the title of Royal Australian Navy, with its role viewed as no longer of just protecting interests at home but also across the region.\n\nJune 21, 1913\n\nThe battle cruiser HMAS Australia is commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth in England under the command of Captain Stephen H Radcliffe.\n\nOctober 4, 1913\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy Fleet, led by HMAS Australia, the country's first flagship, sails into Sydney Harbour. The Australia was accompanied by HMAS Melbourne, HMAS Sydney, HMAS Encounter, HMAS Warrego, HMAS Parramatta and HMAS Yarra.\n\n1914\n\nUpon the outbreak of World War I, the RAN is deployed to capture the German-occupied territories of New Britain and New Guinea. It effectively drove the German East Asiatic Cruiser Squadron from local waters.\n\nSeptember 14, 1914\n\nIn the RAN's first major tragedy, one of its two submarines, the AE1, goes missing in the seas off New Guinea along with its crew of three officers and 32 sailors. No trace of the AE1 has ever been found.\n\nNovember 9, 1914\n\nLoading...\n\nNear the Cocos Islands, HMAS Sydney engages the German light cruiser Emden, which had been causing havoc for Allied shipping in the region. The bigger, faster Sydney registers the RAN's first significant victory at sea. Later in the war, the Sydney, like many of the RAN's ships, operates alongside Britain's Royal Navy in the Mediterranean and North seas.\n\nApril 23, 1919\n\nWith HMAS Australia anchored in Fremantle after returning from the war, more than 80 crew request further leave time, complaining of monotonous duty and harsh discipline, among their long list of gripes. After the appeals are rejected, stokers on watch leave the boiler rooms in protest meaning the ship could not sail. Charges are pressed against 32 men, with 27 imprisoned in cells on the ship for 90 days. Five others court-martialled for mutiny when the ship arrives in Sydney are jailed for up to two years. The men are released months later after a public outcry.\n\n1922\n\nThe Washington Naval Treaty is created by the Allies in an effort to prevent an arms race. The terms of the agreement call for naval strengths to be reduced. To comply with these terms, it is decided that HMAS Australia and its main armament be scuttled. The general public is dismayed with the decision.\n\nApril 12, 1924\n\nHMAS Australia is towed about 40 kilometres off Inner South Head in Sydney and sunk with full military honours before the prime minister, senior rear admirals and cruisers from the Royal Navy.\n\nSeptember 3, 1939\n\nLoading...\n\nWhen World War II is declared, the RAN has just two heavy cruisers, three modern light cruisers, a light cruiser of 1912 design, five WWI-vintage destroyers and two sloops. Experts say that thanks to the Depression and other global factors, Australia's formidable fleet in 1919 has been reduced to a limited trade protection force 20 years later. But the RAN regains its strength thanks to a rapid wartime expansion and serves in every theatre of operations, from the Pacific to the Russian convoys. At war's end, the RAN is the fifth-largest navy in the world.\n\nApril 28, 1941\n\nDespite opposition from some within government and the naval board, 14 women - 12 telegraphists and two cooks - are accepted for service on a trial basis at the RAN Wireless/Transmitting Station in Canberra. A shortage of manpower changes views of women enlisting, and approval to form a Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) is granted in July 1942.\n\nNovember 19, 1941\n\nThe light cruiser HMAS Sydney (II), named in honour of the ship that destroyed the Emden in World War I, encounters the German raider Komoran off the north-west coast of Western Australia. After an engagement that remains the subject of speculation to this day, HMAS Sydney is lost along with all 645 on board.\n\nMay 31, 1942\n\nHMAS Kuttabul, a former ferry converted into a depot ship, is torpedoed and sunk during an attack by a Japanese midget submarine in Sydney Harbour.\n\n1945\n\nThe RAN loses 2,176 men and women and close to 40 ships during World War II. The peak wartime strength of the Navy, in June 1945, is 39,650 personnel of all ranks, including the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service and the Nursing Services.\n\nDecember 16, 1948\n\nThe war in the Pacific demonstrates that sea battles will increasingly be fought by aircraft, and Australia commissions its first carrier - HMAS Sydney (III). The Sydney later serves in the Korean War and becomes the first dominion carrier sent into action. It also operates as a troop transport during the Vietnam War.\n\nFebruary 10, 1964\n\nThe aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne (II) and the destroyer HMAS Voyager (II) collide while performing manoeuvres at night off Jervis Bay. Voyager breaks in two and sinks, resulting in the loss of 82 crew. A total of 232 people are rescued. Two royal commissions are held into the incident and legal battles involving the sailors and the families of those lost continue for decades.\n\n1971\n\nIn April, the federal government announces Australian forces in Vietnam will be reduced. This leads to the withdrawal of the clearance diving team and the destroyer Brisbane returns to Sydney. While the war is not a markedly naval conflict, 13,500 personnel see active service.\n\nDecember 24, 1974\n\nIn the month after Cyclone Tracy devastates Darwin, the RAN will embark upon its then-largest peacetime disaster relief operation involving 13 ships, 11 aircraft and 3,000 personnel.\n\nSeptember 1990\n\nThree ships - HMAS Adelaide, HMAS Darwin and HMAS Success - are sent to the Persian Gulf as part of the multi-national fleet assembled for operations ahead of what will become the Gulf War. Australian ships play a crucial role in enforcing sanctions placed against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. The RAN's role in the Middle East continues to this day, with ships being deployed to the region more than 35 times since 1990 for sanction enforcement, military support and anti-piracy operations.\n\nMay 20, 1993\n\nHMAS Tobruk and HMAS Jervis Bay sail from Mogadishu, Somalia, on the first homeward leg to Australia following a five-month deployment as part of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The Navy plays a vital role in similar actions in East Timor, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville, Cambodia and Rwanda.\n\nJuly 27, 1996\n\nHMAS Collins, the first of six Australian-built diesel-powered submarines, is commissioned into the RAN, 18 months behind schedule. Since then the fleet has been beset by technical problems and a lack personnel to keep them all in operational service.\n\nOctober 6, 2001\n\nLoading...\n\nHMAS Adelaide intercepts an asylum seeker boat, dubbed SIEV 4, carrying 223 people. The next day, the federal government says passengers on the SIEV 4 had threatened to throw children overboard. The incident comes less than two months after the MV Tampa affair. To this day, the Navy's personnel continue the often hazardous job of intercepting those coming to Australia on unseaworthy vessels.\n\nDecember 31, 2004\n\nHMAS Kanimbla sails for Indonesia as part of Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the Boxing Day Tsunami.\n\nApril 2, 2005\n\nA Sea King helicopter involved in providing aid to people still affected by the Boxing Day earthquake and tsunami crashes on the Indonesia island of Nias, killing nine people on board.\n\nMarch 17, 2008\n\nResearch crews locate the remains of HMAS Sydney (II), the whereabouts of which had remained unknown since it sank in 1941. Days earlier they had found the Kormoran, the ship that had fatally wounded the Sydney in their confrontation off Western Australia's north-west coast.\n\nJuly 18, 2011\n\nA damning report into the repair and management of the Navy's support ships finds longstanding problems and calls for urgent reforms. The government commissioned the report after the Navy was unable to help in the aftermath of Queensland's Cyclone Yasi earlier in the year.\n\nFebruary 9, 2012\n\nLoading..."
