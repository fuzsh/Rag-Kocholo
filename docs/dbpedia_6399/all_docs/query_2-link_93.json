        "text": "Several suspects have faced charges in court on Monday, after a sixth day of disorder which broke out in the wake of a knife attack in Southport last week which left three girls dead.\n\nOne judge described scenes of violence in Belfast as “absolutely disgraceful” as he refused bail to two men accused of taking part in disorder which followed an anti-immigration protest in the city on Saturday.\n\nIn another court, a boy aged 14 admitted violent disorder after he was seen by police officers to be among a group of young people setting fireworks off in the direction of members of the public and a police carrier.\n\nDeputy District Judge Liam McStay told Belfast Magistrates’ Court: “The events at the weekend were absolutely disgraceful: a concerted and deliberate attempt to undermine public order and to then domineer the community and there were racist elements to it.”\n\nHe added: “This court cannot allow the type of behaviour that occurred on Saturday to be repeated and be visited on other people, and the message has to be if you allow yourself to become involved in these matters for whatever reason, then you will face the consequences.”\n\nThe district judge refused bail to Simeon Eric McCullough, 46, of Schomberg Drive in Belfast, who was charged with disorderly behaviour and resisting police.\n\nBail was also refused to Gary Creighton, 38, from Inishowen Drive in Belfast, who was charged with possession of an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, possession of fireworks without a licence, and riotous behaviour. He also faced a charge of disorderly behaviour.\n\nAnd bail was refused to Bernard Lavery, 34, from Farnham Street in Belfast, who was charged with taking part in an unnotified public procession.\n\nA PSNI detective constable told the court that Lavery had been at the front of the protest on Saturday carrying a Irish tricolour flag and said that police believe he played a “significant role” in leading the march.\n\nA defence lawyer said his client denied having any leadership role in the protest and had only attended after a flyer was posted through his door.\n\nLavery was denied bail and was remanded in custody until September 2.\n\nMeanwhile, a 14-year-old boy pleaded guilty at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court, sitting as a youth court, to violent disorder.\n\nJoshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said the boy was seen by police officers among a group of eight to 12 other young people in Clayton Square, Liverpool, at about 10.30pm on August 3 setting fireworks off in the direction of members of the public and a police carrier.\n\nHe said: “They exploded underneath the police carrier.”\n\nThe court heard the boy, who cannot be named because of his age, said “I’m sorry, I wasn’t firing them at you, though”, when he was arrested by police after they gave chase.\n\nHe had five fireworks and a lighter in his possession.\n\nThe boy, whose father and uncle were in court, has no previous convictions, the court heard.\n\nIqbal Singh Kang, defending, said the teenager had been in the city centre to catch a bus home, and added: “He did not head into the city centre with the intention of causing any kind of disturbance or adding to the disorder.\n\n“Without thinking things through, he became involved in something much more serious. It’s completely out of the blue.”\n\nThe boy was released on bail until August 27, when he will be sentenced.\n\nBrothers Adam Wharton, 28, and Ellis Wharton, 22, both of Selwyn Street, Liverpool, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court.\n\nAdam Wharton indicated a guilty plea to burglary other than dwelling with intent to steal and was sent to Liverpool Crown Court to be sentenced on August 29.\n\nJoshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said Adam Wharton was seen outside the Spellow Library on County Road on Sunday, wearing a balaclava and “sweating profusely”.\n\nThe library had previously been burnt out and looted, the court heard.\n\nEllis Wharton pleaded guilty to burglary other than dwelling, with intent to steal, at Spellow Library on County Road in Walton.\n\nWharton, who had a black eye, pleaded not guilty to assault by beating of an emergency worker, Pc Thomas Nielsen.\n\nDerek Drummond, 58, of Pool Street, Southport, indicated guilty pleas to violent disorder and assault by beating of an emergency worker at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court.\n\nJoshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said Pc Thomas Ball was deployed to the mosque on St Luke’s Road, Southport, on July 30, where a group of around 300 people arrived shouting “this is our f****** country” and “scumbag bastards”.\n\nThe court heard officers had to withdraw for fear of being overwhelmed.\n\nPc Ball stood to protect colleagues as they tried to put on riot gear when Drummond became violent, shouting “shithouses”, and moved towards him, punching him in the face, Mr Sanderson-Kirk said.\n\nBricks were later thrown after a garden wall was broken down, the court was told.\n\nTwo women sat at the back of the court for the hearing, one was in tears and the other blew Drummond a kiss as he left.\n\nWilliam Nelson Morgan, 69, pleaded guilty at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court to violent disorder and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.\n\nThe court heard he was identified in a crowd who were throwing bricks towards officers on County Road on Saturday night and had a wooden baton with him.\n\nHe resisted arrest and shouted at an officer to get off him when he was detained, the court was told.\n\nLloyd Killner, 35, of Lincoln, Lincolnshire, appeared at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court and pleaded not guilty to a charge of violent disorder in Liverpool city centre on Saturday.\n\nDeclan Geiran, 29, of Kelso Road, Liverpool, pleaded guilty at the same court to violent disorder and arson.\n\nJoshua Sanderson-Kirk, prosecuting, said on Saturday Geiran was seen on CCTV in Liverpool city centre using an “implement” to set fire to a police Ford Transit van which had been abandoned by officers.\n\nJimmy Bailey, 45, of Station Avenue in Little Sutton, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, pleaded not guilty at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court to violent disorder.\n\nJohn O’Malley, 43, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, pleaded guilty to violent disorder.\n\nGareth Metcalfe, 44, of Cambridge Gardens in Southport, appeared at the same court charged with violent disorder in Southport last Tuesday and gave no indication of plea.\n\nAll adult defendants were remanded in custody until their next court dates of either August 29 or 30.\n\nAt Sheffield Magistrates Court, Curtis Coulson, 30, sobbed as he sat in the dock and denied affray following disorder in South Yorkshire over the weekend.\n\nThe alleged offence relates to an incident outside Sheffield City Hall on Sunday in which he is alleged to have swung a stick at a woman.\n\nCoulson was refused bail and will go on trial at the same court in September.\n\nSix people have appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on Monday and were all remanded in custody until their next court appearances on September 2.\n\nJosh Kellett, 29, of Southcroft, Washington, admitted violent disorder after unrest in Sunderland on Friday.\n\nThe court heard he was seen on footage throwing a stone towards police officers while part of a large group.\n\nHe was wearing a balaclava but was identified by his “distinctive tattoos”, it was said.\n\nAndrew Smith, 41, of High Street East, Sunderland, pleaded guilty to violent disorder following unrest in Sunderland.\n\nShaun Doran, 48, of Villette Road, Sunderland, pleaded not guilty to the same offence when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court.\n\nClinton Morrison, 31, of Saint Barnabas Way, Sunderland, did not indicate a plea when he appeared in court accused of violent disorder over unrest in Sunderland.\n\nLeanne Hodgson pleaded guilty to violent disorder after being seen on footage pushing a large bin towards a police line during unrest in Sunderland.\n\nThe 43-year-old, of Holborn Road, Sunderland, who has a “long-running alcohol problem”, denied being involved in the original march but said she had been out drinking and became involved in the disorder when the pub closed, a court heard.\n\nJohn Garside, prosecuting, said “there was a large crowd cheering and joining in” as Hodgson pushed the bin at officers.\n\nDistrict Judge Zoe Passfield told her: “This was large-scale mob violence which resulted in fear to the public and damage to local businesses.\n\n“There is absolutely no justification for it.”\n\nBrian Gilby admitted taking vapes from a shop in Sunderland that was damaged during the disorder, but denied being part of the protests.\n\nThe 27-year-old, of no fixed address, pleaded not guilty to violent disorder when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court on Monday.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary.\n\nHeather Bolton, defending, said Gilby denied being part of the protests or of any violent disorder, but was out “socialising with friends” in the city centre when he saw a shop “that had already been damaged” and went inside.\n\nCarl Holliday, 30, of Tankerville Street in Hartlepool, pleaded guilty to violent disorder during a protest in Hartlepool when he appeared at Teesside Magistrates’ Court, a courts spokesperson said.\n\nHe was remanded in custody until sentencing at Teesside Crown Court on September 2.\n\nTamsyn Cerr, 21, of Firby Close in Hartlepool, did not enter a plea to the same charge and was remanded in custody until her next appearance at crown court, also on September 2.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the courts are on “standby” to ensure “swift justice”, but two men who have been charged with offences following disorder in Bristol city centre on Saturday are not due to appear in court until September.\n\nAdrian Croft, 45, of Holywell, Flintshire, was charged with a Section 4 public order offence and possession of a class A drug.\n\nDamien Williams, 39, of Stockwood Crescent, Knowle, was charged with a Section 4 public order offence.\n\nBoth men have been bailed and will appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on September 5.\n\nAnd two people charged in connection with disorder in Stoke-on-Trent on Saturday will not appear at North Staffordshire Justice Centre until August 22.\n\nJarrod Hollinshead, 26, of no fixed address, has been charged with using threatening or abusive words and or behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress, and Lee Bodman, 52, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been charged with assault by beating of an emergency worker and breaching a criminal behaviour order."
