        "text": "Just for future reference for those using ASP.NET MVC; \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\" does also include \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js\".\n\nSo if your BundleConfig looks like this;\n\nbundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jquery\").Include( \"~/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js\", \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js\")); bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle(\"~/bundles/jqueryval\").Include( \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\", \"~/Scripts/jquery.validate*\"));\n\nIt will result in submitting an Ajax form twice. Removing either \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\" or \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js\" will fix the problem.\n\nJust posting this because it is easy to overlook \"~/Scripts/jquery.unobtrusive*\" when searching for unobtrusive-ajax.\n\nThis might be helpful for someone having a scenario similar to what I have:\n\nOn my page, the edit form opens a partial view inside a Kendo UI modal pop-up window, which loads the code of the form dynamically, including jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js. With this setting, - which can relate to any pop-up such as that of jQuery UI and not just Kendo UI - the behavior of form submission is as follows:\n\nThe first time the pop-up window is opened, the form submission causes a single call to the controller (server-side) code. So far so good. However, for the second time that the window is opened (without closing the container page), the form submission calls the controller 2 times. Subsequently, each re-opening of the pop-up window, causes an additional loading of the jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js code, which in turn causes an additional unwanted call to the controller at each single submission of the form.\n\nIn order to fix the problem, I moved the inclusion of jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js from the partial view of the pop-up window into the main page. However this made the client-side validation stop working, and to fix that, I used the solution provided in here: client side validation with dynamically added field which links to this blog post: http://xhalent.wordpress.com/2011/01/24/applying-unobtrusive-validation-to-dynamic-content/"
