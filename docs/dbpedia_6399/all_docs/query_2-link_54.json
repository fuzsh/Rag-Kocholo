        "text": "Synopsis\n\nLoki executive producer Kevin Wright addressed the notable absence of Kang the Conqueror in the show's finale. Speculation had surrounded the role of Kang amidst legal troubles faced by actor Jonathan Majors, who portrays the MCU supervillain. Wright dispels rumors and sheds light on the process behind the finale's creation.\n\nKevin Wright recently addressed the absence of Kang the Conqueror in Loki’s finale. Rumors were circulating that there was initially a finale with more Kang scenes, but it was removed after Jonathan Majors faced legal issues. Dispelling all these rumors, Wright called it \"crazy” and explained, \"the story you see on the screen is the one we planned from the beginning.\" He clarified that the on-screen story aligned with their original vision and it was not a last minute decision.\n\nLoki enthusiasts eagerly awaited the show's finale anticipating the arrival of Kang the Conqueror. However, the absence of this long awaited character left fans curious. Executive producer Kevin Wright has however spoken out, providing details into the decision-making process.\n\nRumors had circulated regarding Kang's role in the series, fueled by ongoing legal issues faced by Jonathan Majors, the actor playing the MCU supervillain. Majors is set to face trial for domestic abuse charges on November 29, vehemently denying all accusations.\n\nThe Making of the Finale\n\nWright explained that the VFX in the episode were remarkable, emphasizing that achieving such quality required meticulous planning and locking in those elements months in advance. The final sequence alone took eight months in post-production owing to the meticulous crafting of each detail.\n\nContrary to fan assumptions, Wright asserted that there was never consideration for the larger Marvel universe in the finale. He stated that they had built their own corner of the sandbox and told their own story. The team aimed to bring their 12 hours of storytelling to a close, focusing on the narrative they meticulously crafted.\n\nNo Plans for Post-Credits Scenes\n\nDismissing speculations, Wright clarified that there were never plans for post-credits scenes at the end of Loki season 2. He said that they hadn't written any post-credits scenes, and they certainly hadn't shot any, dispelling expectations of additional scenes hinting at future Marvel developments.\n\nEarlier this year, when Majors faced legal issues, Wright confirmed that no changes were made to Loki season 2 in response. \"It felt hasty to do anything without knowing how all of this plays out,\" he commented.\n\nDespite the absence of Kang the Conqueror in the finale, fans can still enjoy Majors' portrayal in three episodes, including the impactful 'Glorious Purpose.' Furthermore, they can anticipate his appearance in the upcoming 2026 release, \"Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.\"\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ1: Who is the strongest Kang variant?\n\nAnswer: Immortus, being an older Kang, symbolizes the completion of Kang's journey, having achieved most of his life's goals.\n\nQ2: How was Kang finally defeated?\n\nAnswer: Moon Knight, Khonshu's avatar, lured Kang into a battle during his attempt to rewrite time, and effectively restored the timeline, defeating Kang the Conqueror.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
