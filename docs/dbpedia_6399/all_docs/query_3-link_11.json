        "text": "Trevante Rhodes\n\nTrevante Rhodes has the physical and emotional strength to portray Kang perfectly. Rhodes’ performances in Moonlight (2016) and Mike (2022) are distinct juxtapositions. Yet, the roles and emotional conviction inform each other. In Moonlight, the actor played “Black,” a young Black man grappling with his sexuality and identity. His honest portrayal invited viewers into the complex performance and one of the best of that year.\n\nAs for Mike, Rhodes leaned into the aggressive nature of legendary boxer, Mike Tyson. He transformed into the athlete to show the various facets of his person. Part-heroic and villainous, Trevante explored the “why” regarding Tyson’s tumultuous life.\n\nAcross both performances, the Louisiana native shows how close anger and sadness are on the emotional spectrum. A spectrum that all of Kang’s variants exercise to perfection to manipulate his enemies. These distinctive roles show that Trevante has the range to play a character as nuanced as Kang the Conqueror.\n\nDamson Idris\n\nDamson Idris‘ emotional range, depicted brilliantly in Snowfall, is enough reason to throw the role of Kang at him.\n\nIdris plays Franklin Saint in the FX hit show. Audiences are treated to Saint’s life as he goes from an innocent teenager to an unhinged drug lord. With each season, Franklin dives deeper into more money and drugs. Damson’s character undergoes heavy character development leading up to the penultimate season, where Saint loses it all—power, money, and his mind.\n\nThe villainous role relied on deceit, manipulation, determination, and greed to sell the performance. And Idris hit a home run. Franklin was, at times, belligerent, vocally and physically destructive, and cunning. And then, in the next scene, he could be an endearing sweetheart. All for the love of control and power. Kang the Conqueror is no different. Kang’s variants are notorious for relentlessly pursuing power by any means—even if it means manipulating hisself. Someone dedicated to their craft, like Damson, would inject a level of prestige into the character that is needed in Jonathan Major’s absence.\n\nAnd if you’re still not sold, go rewatch season 5, episode 8 of Snowfall. Got it? Imagine Damson Idris as Kang having a similar conversation with himself or an Avenger with more intensity. Chef’s kiss.\n\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II\n\nWe know, we know, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is already cast in Marvel‘s Wonder Man. But, what if Marvel decided to shake things up? With the MCU already in disarray, this is the perfect time to rethink and recalibrate. And Abdul-Mateen cast as Kang could be a part of that.\n\nFirst and foremost, the Louisiana native has already shown that he has the range to handle Kang’s various incarnations. Yahya commanded the dance floor in The Get Down, with his smooth character, Cadillac. Much like Marvel’s Conqueror, Cadillac utilized his wit and charisma throughout the show to execute his scumbag-esque desires. His machinations were hidden behind disco and groove in an attempt to woo Mylene Cruz for his own gain. The most underrated aspect of his character was Abdul-Mateen’s ability to charm with his delivery’s tone. His message directly contrasted his tone’s warmth with a subtle nefariousness. And during some scenes, his body language spoke for him. Go back and rewatch Cadillac’s big dance scene; Yahya’s performance is both enchanting and duplicitous.\n\nAbdul-Mateen’s appearance as Black Manta may be a clearer example of why he deserves to play Kang. Across two movies, Aquaman (2018) and Aquaman: The Lost Kingdom (2023), the 37-year-old actor was the highlight. His depiction of Black Manta’s ruthless demeanor was almost shocking. Taking on the role of the merciless mercenary, Yahya was able to execute a role with unadulterated anger and frustration. He illustrates his character’s hatred for Aquaman through impassioned speeches and highly effective nonverbal acting. Several shots in the James Wan-directed film find Abdul-Mateen letting his body language articulate Black Manta’s detestation for Arthur Curry.\n\nYahya has mastered this technique, which could elevate Kang to more horrifying heights, especially as the Multiverse Saga films grow more dire.\n\nAldis Hodge\n\nAldis Hodge was heavily underused in DC Comics’ Black Adam. The North Carolina actor played Hawkman, but wasn’t able to offer much to the film. That said, Hodge prepared for his role by getting into superhero shape.\n\nIn the scenes he appeared in, Aldis did his thing. But, because the movie was critically panned, it still left more to be desired. So, how dope would it be to see the man in a prominent comic book role as Marvel‘s Kang? The SAG Award winner already has a stacked resumé under his belt. And each film is more diverse than the last.\n\nAldis Hodge starring as iconic NFL player Jim Brown in One Night in Miami may be his most famous role. Or better yet, his most impactful. Hodge delivered a performance that expertly captured Brown’s inner demons as he wrestled with moving away from football. Regina King’s character study allowed Aldis the freedom to submerge himself in the depths of a conflicted man. The actor channels the legend’s soulful tone and presents his dialogue with conviction. The scene between himself and Kingsley Ben-Adir (Malcolm X) invites bitterness, fury, compassion and empathy. It’s a testament to Aldis Hodge’s stellar acting and how he could play up the Conqueror’s humanity—which is often disregarded.\n\nClemency is another resumé highlight for Aldis, emphasizing his skill in emotionally charged performances. He stars as Anthony Woods, a death row inmate who is facing an inevitable execution. During his last days, he ponders life’s frailty and how humans have begun playing God with the death penalty. He challenges his prison warden (Alfre Woodard), forcing her to confront the complexities of the systemic pacification of murder under the guise of justice. Kang, as a metaphorical prisoner and warden, wrestles with a similar dilemma.\n\nHodge’s deep understanding and experience in playing deeply conflicted and nuanced men could prove beneficial to the role of Kang. He’s got our vote.\n\nGugu Mbatha-Raw\n\nAdmittedly, this pick will be a bit different. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is already cast in the Marvel cinematic Universe as Ravonna Renslayer. She first appeared in Loki season 1 as a part of the TVA when the God of Mischief first appeared for trial. Since then, she has become even more unhinged. At one point, she even murdered TVA agents for opposing her views on the agency and time travel. As Loki season 2 ended, though, viewers found Renslayer in an unknown location.\n\nAs she awakes, surrounded by structures from scattered historical points, she’s met by an unknown being. Purple lights reflect on her face as the mysterious figure makes their presence known. While fans are never told who the being is, this moment could be the first meeting between Renslayer and Kang the Conqueror.\n\nFor context, Ravonna is Kang’s wifey in the comic books, with multiple storylines involving the pair. Interesting enough, one storyline in particular finds Ravonna becoming a Kang variant at one point. So, with Majors out, Marvel Studios could make Gugu a Kang variant. Not only would it be comic book accurate, but it would also be a hard left from what audiences expect.\n\nAdditionally, the actress is already under contract with the film studio and is directly involved in the storyline surrounding Kang. How sick would it be if it’s revealed that the unknown being approaching Ravonna in the Void is herself? Draped in purple and green garbs and the iconic Time-Ship behind her? Gugu Mbatha-Raw stole the show in Loki, so that could be a play Marvel is considering. But I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.\n\nColman Domingo\n\nColman Domingo is rumored to be a frontrunner in the Kang the Conqueror sweepstakes. And for good reason. Domingo’s resume is extensive, but some of his most celebrated roles have arrived in the past decade. Colman’s role as the honest and complex Ali in Euphoria scored him an Emmy Award. His performance also catapulted him into a new, changing mainstream landscape, catching the eyes of a new generation.\n\nBut the momentum didn’t stop there. Domingo’s recent leading role as the civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in Netflix’s Rustin has thrown the actor into the forefront of award season. Nominations from the Golden Globes and Critics’ Choice Movie Awards, to be exact. The range needed to bounce from Euphoria and Rustin and even operate in The Walking Dead’s dire world is needed to resurrect Kang the Conqueror.\n\nAdditionally, Colman previously said he wanted a crack at a Marvel or DC villain. During a 2021 interview with Awards Watch, the actor dished on his superhero—or villain—aspirations. “When it comes to Marvel and DC, I’m like, ‘I think I’m ready now.’ I’m worked out, fit, I think I want to play a villain. I just want to be the villain. I don’t want to be the good guy. I actually want to do some really nasty, dirty work.”\n\nYeah, things have just gotten interesting."
