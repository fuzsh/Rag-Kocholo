        "text": "When Tom Hiddleston previously said that the \"whole cast\" of Loki would be back for Season 2, I assumed that meant Jonathan Majors would return as Kang. Then that was also pretty much confirmed in the post credits scene Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania, but in case you were still in doubt, Variety has also confirmed he’ll appear in Season 2 of the series.\n\nJudging from the post-credits scene in Ant-Man and The Wasp Quantumania, the version of Kang that Majors is playing in Season 2 is Victor Timely, a 1920 figure who is showing off his own theories of time to a crowd of people at a circus. Victor Timely is yet another Kang variant from the comics and it looks like a very interesting version of the character that will be fun to see explored.\n\nJonathan Majors has such a huge part to play in the MCU over the course of Phase 5 and Phase 6, and he’s going through some craziness at the moment. The actor was arraigned on charges of harassment and assault, but the attorney representing him says that he is \"completely innocent\" of charges that he assaulted and strangled a woman in New York City. He says they are collecting all the proof they need to clear him of the charges.\n\nMajors is at the top of his career right now and it’s just starting. This is something that could have it all come crashing down, and Marvel would be left in quite an insane predicament if Majors were convicted. I mean, they built the next two phases of the MCU around him! There’s no doubt Marvel and Disney have been sweating this as it unfolds.\n\nFrom what I understand, the woman has already recanted her allegations against Majors, so that’s a good sign that everything will turn out ok for Majors."
