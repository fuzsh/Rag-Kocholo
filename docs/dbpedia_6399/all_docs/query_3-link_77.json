        "text": "Share this:\n\nWelcome to the Kang Identities guide!\n\nKang the Conqueror is a man named Nathaniel Richards from the 31st century. Nathaniel is believed to be a descendant of both Reed Richards and Doctor Doom, and shares their intelligence, as well as their tendencies for heroism and control. Equipped with technology from the future, Nathaniel realizes his unique potential to reshape history across every time period. As he begins traveling through time, he adopts different identities and causes a number of divergent personas.\n\nBefore diving into his role in The Multiverse Saga, it’s important to understand the main Kang identities! Below is a brief introduction to each persona, along with their essential comics. Enjoy reading!\n\nFor the complete list of Kang comics, check out our Kang the Conqueror comics reading guide!\n\nKang the Conqueror (“Kang Prime”)\n\nIn his main identity as Kang the Conqueror, Nathaniel’s future-tech battle armor improves his physical combat and gives him almost supernatural abilities. He also has access to the most advanced equipment from any time period, including holograms, robots, and Damocles Base, which is a gigantic spaceship with a Death Star laser. Ravonna Renslayer is the love of his life.\n\nKang Prime comics:\n\nStrange Tales (1951) #134\n\nAvengers (1963) #8, 23-24, 69-71, 128-135; Giant-Size Avengers #2-4\n\nAvengers (1963) #141-143, 267-269\n\nFantastic Four (1961) #323-325\n\nCitizen Kang (1992), Terminatrix Objective (1993)\n\nAvengers Forever (1998) #1-12\n\nAvengers (1998) #41-55, Annual #2001, Ultron Imperative #1\n\nAvengers (2010) #1-6\n\nChildren’s Crusade: Young Avengers (2011) #1\n\nUncanny Avengers (2012) #5-23\n\nSiege (2015) #1-4\n\nAvengers (2017) #1-6\n\nKang the Conqueror (2021) #1-5\n\nFantastic Four (2018) #35\n\nTimeless (2021) #1\n\nKang & Doom comics:\n\nFantastic Four (1961) Annual #2\n\nSecret Wars (1984) #1-4, 11\n\nInfinity War (1992) #1-5\n\nDoctor Doom (2019) #1-6, 10\n\nCouncil of Kangs\n\nThe Council of Kangs are a group of Kang variants from across time and the multiverse. Given the nature of Kang, these arrangements are often short-lived and filled with brutal betrayals. Like Kang himself, the Council of Kang has gone by many names, including the Council of Cross-Time Kangs, the Kang Collective, and the Kang Korps. There are even some versions with other characters pretending to be Kang!\n\nCouncil of Kangs comics:\n\nAvengers (1963) #267-269, 291-297\n\nAvengers West Coast (1985) #61\n\nFantastic Four (1963) Annual #25; Avengers (1963) Annual #21\n\nAvengers: The Terminatrix Objective (1993) #1-4\n\nAvengers Forever (1998) #9\n\nUniverse X (2000) #9\n\nSpider-Ham (2019) #4-5\n\nKang as Rama-Tut\n\nRama-Tut is a younger version of Kang Prime that went back in time for fun and got trapped in the past. Installing himself as a Pharaoh in Ancient Egypt, he ran into Apocalypse, as well as other time-traveling characters like the Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange, and the West Coast Avengers.\n\nAmong the Kang identities, Rama-Tut is known for an ultra-diode ray gun that can drain superpowers and free will from his victims. Like Kang, Rama-Tut has his own iconic ship, which is disguised as the Sphinx of Egypt.\n\nEventually, Rama-Tut escapes the past but gets lost in the time stream. A chance encounter with Doctor Doom inspires him to briefly create the Scarlet Centurion persona. After further time travel adventures, Nathaniel accidentally ends up trapped in the 41st century instead of the 31st. Using the technology of the far future, he adopts the identity of Kang the Conqueror, becoming Kang Prime.\n\nAfter decades of conquest, a 60-year-old Kang Prime returns to Ancient Egypt, resumes his Rama-Tut identity, and rules his people with compassion. Now with a kind heart, Rama-Tut devises a plan to defeat his younger Kang Prime persona. But after engaging in time travel once more, Rama-Tut is lost in the time stream, eventually becoming Immortus of Limbo at the end of time.\n\nMeanwhile, a Limbo time divergence caused a second Nathaniel Richards to appear in the 40th century. This version resumes his Kang identity and begins conquering time yet again.\n\nRama-Tut comics:\n\nFantastic Four (1961) #19, 273, Annual #2\n\nAvengers (1963) #8, 128-135, 141-143; Giant-Size Avengers #2-4\n\nAvengers (1963) #269\n\nDoctor Strange (1974) #53\n\nWest Coast Avengers (1985) #20-22\n\nWhat If…?

Loosely inspired by Doctor Doom, the Scarlet Centurion is known for his iconic red armor. He has a few battles with the Avengers but soon gives up the persona. Nathaniel’s son Marcus Kang XXIII eventually dons his Scarlet Centurion costume and aids his father’s conquests.\n\nWhile Nathaniel Prime was traveling through time as Scarlet Centurion, he inadvertently created a new Scarlet Centurion variant on Earth-712. After an extensive war with the Squadron Supreme and conquering the universe, this variant died a peaceful death in the 42nd century as the most powerful man in existence.\n\nScarlet Centurion (Nathaniel Richards) comics:\n\nFantastic Four (1961) Annual #2\n\nAvengers (1967) Annual #2\n\nWhat If?

(2015) #12\n\nKang as Immortus\n\nImmortus is the final version of Kang, the master of the timeless realm of Limbo, and the inspiration for He Who Remains in Loki. After Nathaniel travels to Limbo at the end of his long life, he begins studying branching timelines under the tutelage of the Time-Keepers. Like the TVA in Loki, Immortus uses “Space Phantoms” to curate timelines towards a specific endpoint, either through manipulation or pruning them altogether.\n\nAs part of his meddling, Immortus is responsible for masterminding many events in the history of the Marvel multiverse, often fighting past versions of himself. Immortus has long struggled to erase the Scarlet Witch’s children from the timeline but continues to fail.\n\nBecause of the unique nature of Limbo, there is only one Immortus across the multiverse. He lives in a citadel at the end of time and has a Psych-Globe filled with the memories of dead Kang variants.\n\nImmortus comics:\n\nAvengers (1963) #10, 128-135, 141-143, 267-269, Annual #21\n\nGiant-Size Avengers (1974) #2-4\n\nThor (1966) #243-245, 281-282, 371-372\n\nAvengers West Coast (1989) #48-62\n\nWhat If…?

At the age of 16, Nathaniel traveled back in time after learning about his horrific future. Arriving during an era when the main Avengers had disassembled, the young Nathaniel triggers an Avengers failsafe program that assembles a new generation of heroes.\n\nAs the Young Avengers, the new team helps Nathaniel fight his destiny of becoming Kang the Conqueror. Unfortunately, after the death of his girlfriend Cassie Lang, Nathaniel becomes the villainous Kid Immortus. It is implied that this version of Nathaniel is still destined to become Kang Prime.\n\nIron Lad comics:\n\nYoung Avengers (2005) #1-6, Special (2006) #1\n\nWhat If?

He starts a revolutionary robotics company as a human named Victor Timely and builds Kang’s headquarters of Chronopolis.\n\nPosing as Victor Timely and his descendants (Victor Timely, Jr., Victor Timely III, etc.), Kang uses the Timely personas to study the Avengers and manipulate human events across the 20th century.\n\nVictor Timely comics:\n\nAvengers Annual (1967) #21\n\nAvengers: The Terminatrix Objective (1993) #3-4\n\nKang as Mister Gryphon\n\nMr. Gryphon is a time-divergence of Kang that gets trapped in the present day due to a “glitch” in the timestream. He uses his knowledge of future technologies to create Qeng Industries, even reprogramming the Vision to fight Avengers. He also buys Stark Tower, which could be a potential story point in the future of the MCU.\n\nMister Gryphon comics:\n\nAll-New, All-Different Avengers (2016) #0-6\n\nAvengers: Back to Basics (2018) #1-6\n\nAnd those are the main identities of Kang the Conqueror!
