        "text": "In the wake of the announcement that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty was being nuked in favor of a Robert Downey Jr.-led Avengers: Doomsday, with Doctor Doom as the main villain instead, what is not clear is what exactly going to happen with the Kang storyline Marvel has been building since Endgame ended.\n\nThe answer, at least so far, appears to be nothing.\n\nThere were two things working against this. The first was that it just…wasn’t very good and fans weren’t biting. Kang was the star villain of Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which is the worst reviewed MCU movie ever, and even if Majors was good in it, they had his Conqueror variant killed by…giant ants. Not the greatest introduction.\n\nThe other issue, of course, seems to be the nail. Majors was arrested and then convicted on domestic violence charges. After that conviction, Disney immediately fired him, lead villain or not, as they should have.\n\nBut the question then turned to whether Kang would be recast or replaced. Many “insider” rumors pointed to him being recast, but the answer appears to be replaced instead. Replaced with Doctor Doom. I do believe Doom was always planned for this era, as Secret Wars is still happening and it’s kind of hard to have that storyline without him. Same with Fantastic Four. But clearly Kang was not just supposed to evaporate like this.\n\nHow does this work? Well, it sort of does. I can see how you may view the incredible Loki season 2 finale as the end of Kang, with Loki “beating him” with his sacrifice to hold the universe together as the God of Stories.\n\nYes, we saw a million Kang variants in the Quantumania post-credits scene, but that was sort of hand-waved away in Loki as the TVA said they were “monitoring” them.\n\nI don’t really even understand where Kang was supposed to appear in the next few Marvel movies to build this storyline further. We just had Deadpool and Wolverine where spoilers, Kang is not in it at all, and the only passing reference to him is Deadpool making a joke that the MCU is at a low point in the multiverse era. Then we have Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts and Fantastic Four. Blade, maybe, someday. Kang does not seem like it fits into any of those at all, minus perhaps again, something like a post-credit scene. So I would not have been surprised if he didn’t appear again after Quantumania until The Kang Dynasty, a movie that apparently no longer exists.\n\nWhat’s unclear now is if Marvel just lets this lie with Loki season 2 or if they write something into the story, like the recast Kang variants being slaughtered by Doctor Doom or eaten by Galactus. Or they all just died on the way back to their home planet.\n\nI do think it was the right call to lean into Doctor Doom here over Kang, as that is a good villain anchor for an era, and after that, well, it’s X-Men time. As for Majors and Kang, it wasn’t going that great to begin with, and Majors himself was likely the end of that storyline.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram."
