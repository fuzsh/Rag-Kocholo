        "text": "Jonathan Majors appeared before a judge last Tuesday in an attempt not only to save his career after a promising start, but also to avoid going to jail. Majors, of whom there are already celebrities who warned of his problematic character, has been the star of two of the biggest blockbusters so far in 2023, such as Creed III and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, but his future in the MCU as Kang the Conqueror is in question, as is his career as a whole.\n\nWhat are the charges against Majors?\n\nThe actor was arrested last March 25 after police responded to a call he made claiming the girl he was with needed medical attention. However, he was arrested and released on charges of strangulation, assault and harassment of the girl who was with him at the time.\n\nThe hearing was conducted remotely, and in it Majors agreed to abide by the restraining order and generally have no contact with the victim. She is 30 years old and is believed to have been Majors’ partner at the time, she claimed head and neck injuries according to the police report, something that contradicts the prosecutor’s report which exchanges the neck for damage to an arm. Meanwhile, the actor’s lawyer claims to have presented evidence that the victim is lying, at least about where she was at the time of the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, Marvel is still looking for a replacement for Majors to play Kang the Conqueror from now on, which is not trivial at all since he is presented as the big villain of the MCU in the future. It seems that Marvel is not only not optimistic about the resolution of Majors’ case, but they are also aware that their image has been seriously damaged regardless of how everything is resolved."
