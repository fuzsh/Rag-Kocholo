        "text": "A.S. Kang is a world renowned singer whose career spans over four decades. Kang’s name is synonymous with some of the biggest hits in the history of Punjabi music.\n\nKang’s musical career started in the early 1970’s, his first ever recording “Lut Ke lehgai” was a massive hit across the UK and the lead to the start of a new phenomena.\n\nIn 1978 Kang went on to produce the biggest Punjabi song of all time “Giddian di Rani” and become the first UK based Punjabi artist to break into the Indian market.\n\nSigned to HMV (India), he got the opportunity to work with some of the best music directors in India including K.S.Narula (the father of Jaspinder Narula).\n\nIn the 1980’s he teamed up with Charanjit Ahuja India’s No1 music director and went on to conquer the music world with hits like “Ashiq Tera” and “Lambharan Di Nau Nachdi”. He also became the first UK artist to tour the United States and Canada and Europe.\n\nIn 1993 A.S.Kang’s greatest feat was to rescue the British Bhangra Industry from the clutches of the confused fusion artists of the nineties by teaming up with music maestro Sukshinder Shinda Kang produced some of the biggest-selling albums of the decade. He single handily turned the industry, and people’s taste in music, around with his blistering vocals on the colossal hit “Boliyan” on Flashback and “Valeti Boliyan” on Kang-Fu: and sent riples across the worlds dance floors. This gave Kang the title “King of Boliyan” and with it legendary status as one of the pioneers of Bhangra music across the world.\n\nIn 1995 Kang swept the board at the Asian pop awards by winning 5 awards including best male singer, dance track. album, writer, nd best selling artist. The new millennium has seen Kang’s popularity grow stronger than ever with the help of his Super Hit Album “Aish Karo”.\n\nAish Karo is the one of the most requested song at any Asian Party and “Khao Pio, Aish Karo” has now become one of the most popular catchphrases around.\n\nMusic"
