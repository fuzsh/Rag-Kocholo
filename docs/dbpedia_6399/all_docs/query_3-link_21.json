        "text": "Warning: There are major spoilers ahead for \"Loki\" and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.\"\n\nHere's all you need to know about villain Kang and what his presence means for the MCU going forward.\n\n\"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" is now streaming on Disney+.\n\nKang the Conqueror was first introduced in 2021's 'Loki' finale\n\nKang the Conqueror was first introduced in the \"Loki\" season one finale as the person behind the Time Variance Authority (TVA).\n\nAlthough the name Kang was never said aloud, other than a wink to the character saying he's been called \"a conqueror,\" fans likely recognized the character who was referred to cryptically as \"He Who Remains\" (even in the show's credits) as the classic Marvel Comics villain.\n\nIf you've been watching closely, you probably weren't too surprised by the reveal.\n\nFrom the presence of Gugu Mbatha-Raw's Ravonna Renslayer (who Kang loves in the comics) and the temporal beast Alioth (who Kang fights in the comics), as well as Easter egg teases, it makes perfect sense that Kang was the face behind the TVA.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the Marvel character and what he may mean to the future of the MCU.\n\nWho is Kang the Conqueror in the comics?\n\nIn the comics, Kang is a time warlord who is a frequent Avengers foe. He was originally called Nathaniel Richards, a 31st-century scholar and the descendant of Mister Fantastic/Reed Richards' dad Nathaniel, who was a time-traveler.\n\nNathaniel develops an obsession with history and later finds time-traveling tech created by Doctor Doom, another classic Marvel villain. Nathaniel ends up in Ancient Egypt and becomes Pharaoh Rama-Tut, eventually crossing paths with En Sabah Nur (\"X-Men\" villain Apocalypse).\n\nAfter being ousted from this timeline by a time-displaced Fantastic Four, Nathaniel later reappears a thousand years after the 31st century. He conquers Earth and reinvents himself as Kang the Conqueror. He begins to conquer versions of the galaxy in the past, present, and future, creating his own temporal kingdom.\n\nAfter this, Kang meets Renslayer, the princess of one of his kingdoms, but she does not feel the same way as he does about her. Kang has various run-ins with several major characters that have already appeared in the MCU or who will do so shortly, including Thor, Mantis, Spider-Man, Hawkeye, the Hulk, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, and the Black Knight (who Kit Harrington plays in \"Eternals\").\n\nIn the comics, Kang has adventures in the old west, ancient Egypt, World War II, and various eras in the past and future. He also goes by the monikers Scarlet Centurion, Immortus, Iron Lad, and Victor Timely — alternate versions of Kang not unlike the alternate versions of Loki seen in this TV show.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe Kang we meet on 'Loki' isn't the out-right villain we expected\n\nHere's the thing. This Kang wasn't even all bad. We certainly wouldn't classify him as a straight-up villain. He just seemed like a guy who was genuinely trying to keep the peace, from his perspective.\n\nWhen Sylvie and Loki approached him, Kang explained that before the invention of the TVA, a version of himself in the 31st century discovered multiple universes atop his own. Other versions of Kang discovered the same thing around similar times. The variants made contact and, initially, shared technology and knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, Kang said some of his variants weren't great.\n\n\"To some of us, new worlds meant only one thing, new lands to be conquered,\" Kang told a somewhat skeptical Loki and Sylvie. \"The peace between realities erupted into all-out war, each variant fighting to preserve their universe and annihilate the others. This was almost the end, ladies and gentlemen, of everything and everyone.\"\n\nKang claims that he found and weaponized the giant cloud monster Alioth and ended the Multiversal War between Kang variants.\n\nHe then offered the two Lokis to either replace him and run the TVA or kill him and unleash all of his variant selves upon the multiverse, causing another Multiversal War.\n\n\"You kill me and the Sacred Timeline is completely exposed or you take over and return to the TVA as its benevolent rulers,\" Kang said.\n\nSylvie, unfortunately, chose chaos and killed the pretty chill version of Kang. The \"Loki\" finale teased we'll be meeting some of the more dangerous Kang variants in the future.\n\nWho plays Kang the Conqueror?\n\nKang is played by American actor Jonathan Majors. So far, his notable credits include roles in movies \"The Last Black Man in San Franciso\" and \"Da 5 Bloods,\" and in TV shows \"When We Rise\" and \"Lovecraft Country.\"\n\nWe expect to see Majors return in season two and can't wait to see how he'll take on these more dangerous variants of Kang.\n\nKang makes his big screen debut in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'\n\n2023's \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" brings Kang to the big screen, when Scott Lang/Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and his family catch the villain's attention after Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton) builds a satellite that scans the Quantum Realm.\n\nScott and the Ant-family get sucked down into the Quantum Realm to discover that Kang has been trapped down there for decades, and has been ruling the microscopic universe as his own kingdom.\n\nHe was exiled to the realm by the Council of Kangs — a group made up of other versions of the villain from throughout the multiverse. Quantum Kang was banished because he wanted to slaughter the council so that he was the only version to exist.\n\nAlthough Quantum Kang is seemingly killed by the end of the film, when he gets pulled into the Multiverse Engine Core, this is not the last we've seen of the villain.\n\nThe mid-credits scene actually shows fans the Council of Kangs, as Rama-Tut, Immortus, and a variant of Scarlet Centurion meet to discuss Quantum Kang's death.\n\nMore importantly, they realize that the heroes from Earth-616 (where the MCU takes place) are aware of the multiverse, which makes them a threat to the council's plans to rule the multiverse.\n\nWhen will Kang next be seen in the MCU?\n\nThe post-credits scene of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" shows the Victor Timely variant of Kang giving a speech to an audience in the early 1900s about the nature of time and space, while Loki and Agent Mobius watch from the crowd. So Kang will definitely be a key player in \"Loki\" season two.\n\nBut because we got a glimpse of hundreds of different Kangs in the mid-credits scene, it's entirely possible that he could pop up in any of the future projects like \"Secret Invasion,\" or \"The Marvels.\"\n\nWhat does Kang mean for the MCU going forward?\n\nKang is a game-changing character who opens up new avenues and possibilities and who could help introduce various characters to the MCU — including Doctor Doom and the Fantastic Four, who are getting their own MCU movie(s).\n\nBut most importantly, he's going to be the focus of the next big event in the MCU, 2025's \"Avengers: The Kang Dynasty.\" The title is taken from the run of the comics by Kurt Busiek in 2001, which sees the villain conquer the planet, supposedly to save it from numerous alternate dark futures.\n\nBut Marvel chief Kevin Feige is also turning it into a two-part story, and the second chapter will arrive in 2026 — titled \"Avengers: Secret Wars.\" While the 1984 story of the same name pits numerous heroes and villains against each other on a mysterious planet called Battleworld, it seems more likely that the MCU will pull from Jonathan Hickman's 2015 \"Secret Wars\" series.\n\nThe event sees multiple incursions ripple across the multiverse, with trillions dying in the process. Thankfully, Doctor Doom pieces the surviving chunks of these universes together to make a new Battleworld to rule himself.\n\nProjects like \"Loki,\" \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,\" and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" all deal with the multiverse (as well as referring to incursions) so it seems likely that this is what Marvel is building towards but with Kang in charge, instead of Doctor Doom.\n\nIn short, the MCU's scope is broadening. Considerably. The multiverse is now in full effect thanks to Kang and this will send ripples across various MCU properties. Expect things to get weirder and wackier, too, as we traverse some of Marvel Comics' more colorful storylines.\n\nA \"Fantastic Four\" movie set in the wild west? Hulk being sent back to World War II? Doctor Doom in Ancient Egypt? The Avengers fighting alternate versions of themselves? Don't rule it out. Anything seems possible now that Kang is in the picture.\n\n— Additional reporting by Jacob Sarkisian."
