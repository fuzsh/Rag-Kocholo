        "text": "They had come from all over North America for the wedding and as the large extended family of the Sikh bride and groom celebrated, the banging of drums echoed across the dark farmland along Lefeuvre Road, in Abbotsford.\n\nThe screams would come later, and then the wails of ambulances and the thud of helicopters would shatter the quiet rural atmosphere as the flashing lights of police cars illuminated the scene of one of the worst traffic accidents in British Columbia's history.\n\nIn its wake, in a sad and determined affirmation of life yesterday, the wedding went ahead as planned, as the close-knit Indo-Canadian community in Abbotsford struggled to balance the joy of a marriage against the grief of a shocking tragedy.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Friday it was all happiness as about 30 friends and family of the bride, Harsimran Mahil, and the groom, Jarnail Grewal, went walking house to house, beating drums, ringing bells and singing traditional songs in a ceremony, known as a jaggo, that was meant to literally wake people up and get them to join the celebrations.\n\nAt about the same time a 71-year-old Indo-Canadian man from Langley, whose identity has not yet been released by police, stopped at a local gas station to fuel up his white, 1981 Chevy pickup, with two black stripes on the hood. He was on his way home from working late at a plant in Abbotsford and after he pulled away from the pumps he went south on Lefeuvre Road, unaware that up ahead, just over the crest of a small hill, the wedding celebrants had spilled out into the night and onto the pavement.\n\nLefeuvre Road, a secondary truck route through rural Abbotsford with a speed limit of 60 kilometres an hour, is lined by trees, blueberry fields and sheep paddocks. The darkness along it is broken only here and there by pools of yellow light from a scattering of farm houses, most set well back from the two-lane road.\n\nThe wedding celebrants had just left one house and had begun walking south, back to the home of Avtar Mahil, the father of the bride, where party tents were set out in the expansive yard, when the truck came up behind them.\n\nThe group, which did not include the bride and groom, was walking along the right side of the road and although one witness said some were in a sloping ditch that runs parallel to the pavement, others were on the narrow gravel shoulder and some were on the road, in the path of the oncoming truck.\n\nSuddenly headlights pierced the darkness and then the truck, driven by an elderly man with a long, white beard, went smashing into the procession, sending people flying off the hood and dragging several of them with the undercarriage into the ditch, killing six and injuring 17, including two babies.\n\nThree men and three women ranging from 13 to 50 died.\n\nFive of the victims have been identified by Harjinder Thind, the news director for Red 93.1FM, a Punjabi radio station, as Damanpreet Singh Kang, 13, Rubal Kaur, 22, Bhupinder Singh Kaler, 24, Rapduman Singh Dhillan, 25 and Satinder Kaur Mahil, 50. A sixth victim has not yet been identified. Mr. Thind said he talked briefly with the driver of the truck, but \"he was too shook up to say much.\"\n\nThe wedding procession began at Avtar Mahil's house and proceeded to the house of Shamsher Mahil, a friend of Mr. Mahil's who grew up in the same Indian village that he did. After about 30 minutes, the procession left to return to Avtar Mahil's house when the accident occurred.\n\nAbbotsford City Councillor Moe Gill, who arrived at Mr. Mahil's house Saturday morning, said he has known the bride's family for 25 years.\n\nHe said one of the deceased women was the bride's aunt, Satinder Mahil, who had been at his house for a party just two weeks ago.\n\n\"They're in shock. Their mother was just killed last night,\" he said about Ms. Mahil's three grown children. \"It wasn't good when you go in there ... The emotion was out of control.\"\n\nAvtar Dosanjh, who also arrived on Lefeuvre Road Saturday morning to pay his respects, said he also knew Ms. Mahil.\n\n\"She was very, very nice. This whole thing is just really, very sad.\"Police said 14 area ambulances and two Medevac helicopters from Vancouver Airport were called to transport the injured and seven area hospitals were put on a Code Orange alert, clearing ER space to handle the victims.\n\nAccording to Sergeant Amar Kingra, of the Abbotsford Police, nine people remained in hospital yesterday, with two in intensive-care units. A four-month-old was released, but a seven-month-old remains in critical but stable condition.\n\nSeveral of the victims were from the United States and two were from Toronto.\n\nThe 71-year-old truck driver was released from police custody after several hours of questioning. Sgt. Kingra said he has been extremely co-operative. Drugs and alcohol have been ruled out as factors, and Sgt. Kingra said there is currently no indication that speed or weather conditions played any role, either.\n\nConstable Casey Vinet suggested the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel, but that has not been confirmed.\n\n\"At this time, there's no charges being proposed or considered until we get our full, complete investigation done including mechanical inspection on the vehicle to find out what went wrong there,\" he said.\n\nSgt. Kingra said the police will be interviewing the surviving members of the accident after they have had time to grieve.\n\nMost of the people on the road were women and children who are related to the bride.\n\nDarren Franson and his wife Ester, who live in a house just at the crest of the hill, were watching television at 11:15 p.m. when they heard a \"horrendous sound,\" out on the road. They knew it was a vehicle striking something - but they never imagined it had run into a wall of people.\n\nMoments later their 11-year-old daughter, Rachel, bolted into the living room to tell them the truck had hit the wedding procession.\n\n\"She was standing at her bedroom window watching the parade go by when the truck just came up and went plowing right into them ... people just went flying,\" he said.\n\n\"After that it was chaos,\" he said. \"The screaming was unbelievable.\"\n\nMr. Franson said a large crowd of people went running to the scene from the house that the procession had just left, and soon there were more than 100 people on the road.\n\n\"There were a lot of people there helping, doing what they could, but the screaming went on until the ambulances arrived,\" he said. \"It's hard to describe.\"\n\nJaskaran Mahil, who is in Grade 6, told The Canadian Press that he was at the front of the procession with his parents when the truck hit.\n\n\"People started yelling and I ran,\" he said. \"Two seconds, probably later, the truck was [there]and I was unconscious.\"\n\nYesterday a cluster of half a dozen bundles of flowers marked the accident site, but otherwise it looked just like any other stretch of quiet country road, except for a few tattered pieces of emergency-scene tape in the ditch."
