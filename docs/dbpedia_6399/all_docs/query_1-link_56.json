        "text": "KIRK: This Khan is not what I expected of a twentieth century man.\n\nSPOCK: I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.\n\nKIRK: Common courtesy, Mister Spock. He'll spend the rest of his days in our time. It's only decent to help him catch up. Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding?\n\nSPOCK: There is that possibility, Captain. His age would be correct. In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over forty nations.\n\nKIRK: Well, they were hardly supermen. They were aggressive, arrogant. They began to battle among themselves.\n\nSPOCK: Because the scientists overlooked one fact. Superior ability breeds superior ambition.\n\nKIRK: Interesting, if true. They created a group of Alexanders, Napoleons.\n\nSPOCK: I have collected some names and made some counts. By my estimate, there were some eighty or ninety of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated.\n\nKIRK: That fact isn't in the history texts."
