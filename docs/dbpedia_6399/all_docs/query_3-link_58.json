        "text": "Update (12/18, 5:02 PM): That didn’t take long. Just an hour or so after Jonathan Majors was convicted of assault and harassment, Disney has fired the actor. Majors has played MCU villain Kang, who was meant to anchor the entire new multiverse arc. But it appears Disney was waiting for this verdict before making an ultimate decision, and now they have.\n\nIt is not clear whether Kang will be recast with another actor, or if the MCU will move on from Kang entirely, eliminating The Kang Dynasty from its plans, or turning it into something else. The role now seems a bit toxic for other actors, given the context, so it’s possible Marvel will move on, possibly to Doctor Doom, who was set to be another big-time villain in Marvel’s future. But the path, for now, remains unclear.\n\nOriginal article follows:\n\n-\n\nActor Jonathan Majors has been convicted of third degree reckless assault and also found guilty of harassment. A jury reached the verdict after four hours of deliberation in three days. Majors was not found guilty of additional charges of intentional third degree assault and second degree aggravated harassment.\n\nThese charges stem from the March 25, 2023 incident involving his ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari. In recent days, a chaotic video emerged showing Majors appearing to attempt to stuff Jabbari in a car, and her pursuing him on the street, something Majors supporters believed would exonerate him. But photos were also revealed of Jabarri’s neck and hand injures, and text messages were read into the record where Majors, in a previous exchange, told her not to go to the hospital after he’d given her a head injury, saying it would be dangerous for them even if she lied about how she got it.\n\nThe jury agreed on at least two of the charges brought against Majors after all evidence was presented. In New York, the misdemeanor of assault in the third degree carries a maximum sentence of a year in jail. Harassment, meanwhile, is just up to 15 days in jail.\n\nIt remains unclear what Majors’ sentence will actually be, and if he may avoid jail time altogether, but it raises urgent questions about his career, and the most high profile job he’s had for the past few years playing Kang, the current Big Bad of the entire Marvel Cinematic universe.\n\nAfter his arrest, Majors was dropped from other film and TV projects and even his own agency. But Disney has not cut ties with Majors to this point, with him being lynchpin of their entire multiverse saga. Many defenders of Majors said that Disney should wait for the verdict in this case, despite them not being bound to any sort of legal judgement with Majors. But even if they did wait, now, Majors has been found guilty of misdemeanor assault and harassment.\n\nIt does seem somewhat unlikely Majors will end up in jail for a year, and depending on sentencing, could theoretically avoid jail altogether. But Disney really does not need to be weighing whether or not Majors will be in jail which would certianly throw a wrench in filming. Now, the path should be clear. The actor who was just convinced of assault and had domestic abuse text messages read into a court record should not be starring in any of their projects.\n\nSo far, Majors has appeared as a major character in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. His performance in the role has been praised, and the original plan was to have his storyline culminate in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. Now, it seems almost impossible Kang will not be recast, which is, lore-wise, incredibly easy to do in a multiverse saga, or Kang might be cut from future plans entirely, his arc ending with Loki season 2.\n\nObviously the most important thing is that justice is served for Jabbari. And there have been other women that have come forward with allegations against Majors that may play out in the future. But this raises serious questions about his huge role in the MCU and whether Disney should have even waited this long in the first place to do something about it. Nothing has been announced imminently about Majors in the MCU, but I would expect something shortly. There is simply no way he can continue in this role.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram."
