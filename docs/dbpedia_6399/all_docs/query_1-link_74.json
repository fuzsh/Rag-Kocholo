The avatar is the Face of God but is not God in His totality hence Guru Gobind SIngh's curse on those who say he is God. If God were an iceberg the avatar would be the tip of it, what you can perceive of the iceberg, the rest being hidden.\n\nI suggest people try to learn the languages of gurbani first and actually read Guru Granth Sahib instead of coming with statements like: ooo lalleshvari there are no avatars in Sikhi!!! I am sure it makes people feel better about themselves to try to teach me lessons: if that makes you happy go on but back up!!!\n\nBhagat Naam Dev Ji in Raag Bhairao on Pannaa 1165:\n\nPrahlaad answered, \"\"The Lord, the Master of the three worlds, is contained even in this pillar to which I am tied.\"\"||4||\n\nThe Lord who tore Harnaakhash apart with His nails proclaimed Himself the Lord of gods and men.\n\nSays Naam Dayv, I meditate on the Lord, the Man-lion, the Giver of fearless dignity. ||5||3||9||\n\nor Bhai Gurdas panna 10:\n\nAt the same moment Lord God in the form of man-lion came out of pillar. His form was grand and majestic.\n\nThat wicked demon was thrown down and killed and thus it was proved that the Lord is kind to devotees since the time immemorial.\n\nBhattan Savaye:\n\nYou are blessed with the Nectar of the Lord's Name, O Guru Nanak; You have mastered Raja Yoga, and enjoy sovereignty over both worlds. ||6||\n\nIn the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, You were pleased to deceive Baal the king, in the form of a dwarf.\n\nIn the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, You were called Raam of the Raghu dynasty.\n\nIn the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, You were Krishna; You killed Mur the demon and saved Kans.\n\nYou blessed Ugrasain with a kingdom, and You blessed Your humble devotees with fearlessness.\n\nIn the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, You are known and accepted as Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar Das.\n\nThe sovereign rule of the Great Guru is unchanging and permanent, according the Command of the Primal Lord God. ||7||\n\nmore Babbar Sher? because I have more!\n\nHare Krishna Hare Krishna Hare Hare Krishna krishna\n\nBy the way do you know that Guru Nanak is mentioned is mentioned in the biography of Chaitanya mahaprabhu. Apparently they were like brothers when they met!\n\nJay Shri Krishna!!! Hari ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmm!\n\nAfter reading this i think sikhs shouldnt feel insecure when they are described as hindus.\n\nHinduism - Introduction\n\nHinduism is the name given to a family of religions and cultures that began and still flourish in India.\n\nLike other Eastern religions, it doesn't fit comfortably into the same box as Western religions like Christianity.\n\nHindus do not separate religion from other aspects of life. For Hindus in India, Hinduism is an inextricable part of their existence, a complete approach to life that involves social class, earning a living, family, politics, diet, etc., in addition to the things Westerners view as religious.\n\nThe word \"Hindu\" comes from the name of the river Indus, which flows 1800 miles from Tibet through Kashmir and Pakistan to the sea. Originally the name referred to people living in a particular region of the world, regardless of their faith; so in the 18th century someone could quite sensibly be described as a \"Hindu Muslim\".\n\nThere are 750 million Hindus in the world, and most of them live in India. In the UK there are 400,000 Hindus, 160,000 of whom are active in their faith.\n\nHinduism includes a very wide range of beliefs and practices, so there aren't many things that are common to all Hindu groups. However they all have a \"family resemblance\" to each other.\n\nHinduism has no founder, no creed, and no single source of authority.\n\nThe things most often common to Hindus are a belief in a single Divinity or supreme God that is present in everything, belief in other gods who are aspects of that supreme God, belief that the soul repeatedly goes through a cycle of being born into a body, dying, and rebirth, belief in Karma, a force that determines the quality of each life, depending on how well one behaved in a past life.\n\nMost Hindus worship at home and have a shrine there. Hindu temples are the focus of religious life, but there is not a strong tradition of corporate congregational worship.\n\nHinduism has not had a significant tradition of seeking to convert people, although some modern Hindu sects now do seek converts\n\nhttp://www.khalsapride.com/SikhSpottings/tele.htm\n\nthere u go\n\na singh was spotted in the video for hey jude.. awesome song\n\nif any1 can find the video with the sardar in let me know?\n\ncan any1 find it?\n\nanyways for those of u that cant be bothered 2 click the link heres the article in its eternity\n\nNEW! A sardar with turban, Manjit Singh Balbir Singh being the referee of a soccer match in the malaysian league soccer match. This match was telecasted live all over Malaysian National Television. [ spotted by Sachdev Singh, 7.7.02 ]\n\n\"Ludacris and JD's new video Welcome to Atlanta features a sardar throughout the ENTIRE video. He is on the right in the tour bus first, then later picking out boots, with the rappers and trying on clothes, and then finally he is at a club with both Ludacris and JD. Who is this guy!!! (seen on 12/4/01)\"\n\nThere is a Full Sikh Television News Anchor who speaks perfect Malay on one of the Malaysian channels; Tv 3 or Tv 2 Malaysia. He comes on everyday on national television and reads the news, in Malay!\n\nHandsome young turbaned sikh boy spotted on a show called \"Books on Parade\". He and his teamates won the trivia contest. His name was Jagdeep Singh.\n\nSikh on a KFC commercial who was just about ready to enjoy a nice picnic on top of his car.\n\nOn CNN they were previewing a coverage for the NBA finals. Two sardar Laker fans were cheering to the camera and showing their Khalsa Pride. (6/11/01)\n\nOn CNN Perspectives they were doing an in depth series of interviews and travelling around with the Dalai Lama who is currently located in India. For a segment of the show, they focused on the town of Dharamsala a vibrant community. While this show may have been focused on Buddhists- a young Sikh boy with a putka was shown as a citizen of Dharamsala in a still picture that was being mixed with the 'action' videotape. It was nice to see his picture to know that Dharamsala, which was being depicted as a vibrant community-also had some spice with some Sikhs who stood out in the crowd.\n\nOn American's Funniest Home Videos on ABC, March 3rd, They aired a clip of a school play where a Sikh Man's Kid ran up on stage. They zoomed in on the Sardar as he was getting his kid.\n\nSaw the sardars from josh on CNN TWICE! First on a news clipping for the bollywood music awards where they performed. Then saw them on CNN w/ Riz Khan for a half hour show. They were amazing. Their video for \"Tanha\" is on their website www.planetjosh.com\n\nI saw a Sikh man on the channel 11 news today. He was taking part in the effort to rescue a woman who was buried under rubble after the recent earthquake.\n\nOn ABC Channel 7 News there was a report done on the rapidly growing Asian population in New Jersey. Mostly statistics of Asian populations growing 104% in Ocean counties etc. was presented. I wouldn't have even watched the whole story if I hadn't been surfing channels and happened to catch a Sardar being videotaped with a fine looking pugh! It's nice to see that Sikhs can grab attention wherever they are spotted =)!\n\nA sardar was spotted in the \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" music video. He appears in the scene where Puff Daddy makes the winning putt, and then runs around and gives a \"high-five\" to everyone, and then he is spotted jumping up and down hugging a handsome sardar man.\n\nIn the \"Hey Jude\" video from the Beatles, a sardar is spotted sitting next to one of the band members. He was by that band member throughout the entire video therefore was on the video- pratically the whole time.\n\nOn Boy Meets World. Their is a sardar who is a doctor testing Eric's sleeping problems.\n\nOn Dharma & Greg (tv show) a Sikh was spotted in the background on several different occasions.\n\nOn an 'old school' episode of Seventh Heaven the black church is burnt by racists. In a very moving ending scene, all religions and faiths join at the site of the burnt church to raise money and join in favor. You see whites and blacks holding hands, Muslims, and the best- a sardar rocking a sweet dastar twice! I think its great that the show writers put a Sikh in the show in a good context.\n\nI spotted a Sikh on a Dr. Pepper Commercial during the NFC Championship Football game. He was shown in a car (no taxi sign) and was wearing a black dastaar with a uncut beard.\n\n\"There was a GE (General Electric) commercial on TV during a college basketball game recently. THe commercial showed how GE was moving ahead in technology and they were showing many different people working for them, and then they show this cool Singh smiling and walking for about 2 seconds. It was just awesome to see a Singh on national TV.\"\n\n\"There is a Sikh sitting on the bus behind Alanis Morissette in her video 'Thank You.'\"\n\n\"Sikhs have been spotted in the Wu Tang Clan video entitled 'Ice Cream.' the artist name was Raekwon. It showed a boy in a patka behind a register as the members of the Wu rhymed in a convenience shop. Yet again, another positive example of Sikhs in hip hop videos. This video came out in 1996 i believe.\"(Reported by Sartaj Singh)\n\n\"A Sikh was spotted in the Cocca Brovaz video entitled \"Won on Won.\" this video came out in December of 1997. It showed a Sikh dancing with the duo of the group for a significant amount of time. Longer than the puff daddy video. They were rhyming and they said 'you can catch me chillin at akbar's door.' and then they showed them dancing with a sardar. it was a positive role for the Sikh.\""
