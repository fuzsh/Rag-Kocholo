        "text": "Cillian Murphy has already gained widespread acclaim with his wide range of performances. While he is yet to take center stage in a superhero franchise, his road to Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looks quite nigh given the upcoming reports about the franchise pulling out Kang the Conqueror’s era out of the Multiverse saga.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Before Oppenheimer Fame, Cillian Murphy Was the 3rd Choice for an Underrated Apocalypse Movie That Wanted Ryan Gosling\n\nThe reports about Kang’s end in the MCU began to loom after Jonathan Majors’s case recently came up. Since he has been declared guilty in the domestic abuse case, Marvel Studios fired him as the face of the main antagonist of Phases 5 and 6. With this, Kang’s fate remains unclear in the MCU which brings an opportunity for another Marvel villain to kick in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCillian Murphy May Enter into MCU as Doctor Doom!\n\nAlso Read: “Pivot from Kang to Dr. Doom now?”: Jonathan Majors Sacked by Marvel as Fans Suspect Cillian Murphy as New Secret Wars Villain\n\nFollowing the verdict that was passed on Jonathan Majors of being guilty in the domestic abuse case made by his ex-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, Marvel Studios dropped him as the Multiverse’s main villain.\n\nBut this led many to look at the previous theories reported following the actor’s arrest in March this year. Among them was one report about the introduction of a new villain in the franchise. Many pointed out Doctor Doom for being the perfect fit to replace the time-traveling antagonist. Given that the former has already been let go by the franchise, Kang’s character is now on hold. This makes Cillian Murphy‘s name enter into the top contenders list for Dr. Doom’s role, who is also the fan-favorite for the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an appearance on the Happy Sad Confused Podcast, Murphy addressed the possibility of playing Doctor Doom in the franchise.\n\nHe shared,\n\n“Yeah, I mean, I’m always… It’s always about the script. So, I’ll read… If someone sends a script, I’ll read it. And you never know what turns up…”\n\nA recent Twitter post reported about Marvel introducing a new villain for the multiverse saga. Check out the post here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the post did not mention Doom, a Variety report previously revealed that the franchise executives were planning to replace the character with Doctor Doom.\n\nKang the Conqueror Reportedly Won’t Be in the Center for the Multiverse Saga\n\nAlso Read: Robert Downey Jr./ Cillian Murphy As Doctor Doom In Secret Wars Is Highly Likely Following Avengers 5 Update\n\nThe Variety report suggested that Marvel Studios President, Kevin Feige along with other executives planned to replace Kang with another powerful villain, Doom in the Multiverse saga.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs per the report,\n\n“At the gathering in Palm Springs, executives discussed backup plans, including pivoting to another comic book adversary, like Dr. Doom.”\n\nThe comic character’s debut rumors further gained attention when the upcoming fifth Avengers film, The Kang Dynasty is now referred to as Avengers 5. As these doubts continue to hint at Doom’s debut, fans also agree to the same.\n\nCheck out the tweets here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, some fans still believe that Kang’s storyline can be continued if the character is recast. It is undoubtedly a simple solution as Kang’s variants can continue the plot as they don’t need to look like the Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania variant. Nonetheless, Murphy can still make his debut in MCU with Doom if the franchise strategizes things accordingly. There is still time for the fifth Avengers saga which is slated for a 2026 release on May 1st."
