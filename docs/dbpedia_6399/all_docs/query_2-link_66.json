        "text": "India is a land of diverse culture. We celebrate various festivals round the year. It’s 10 days Kang Chingba or Rath Yatra festival for the Hindus in the Eastern part of the country, starting from the 7th of July. As such I have come with Kang special Khechri and Manggan Ushoi Ooti recipes today.\n\nIt was also Eid coincidently, hence my friends who had observed fast during the Holy month of Ramadaan celebrated Eid with much fun. Already have an upcoming invitation from a dear friend and looking forward to visiting and meeting her after a long time.\n\nKnowing and learning about the significance of each occasion or festivals of different communities interests me much as my very own community festivals and occasions.\n\nAs I have mentioned in one of my previous post that the Manipuris being followers of Gaudiya Vaishnavism cult worship Lord Krishna and his avatars and mainly celebrate festivals related to Him along with other deities as well.\n\nKang celebrated back in my home state of Tripura as well as in neighbouring Manipur is a miniature form of the Rath Yatra festival of Puri in the eastern state of Odisha. Yet it’s equally a grand celebration in both the states as much as that of Puri’s Rath Yatra.\n\nCelebrated in the month of Ingen (June-July), the annual kang chingba or rath(chariot) journey of Lord Jagabondhu/Jagannath (avatar of Lord Vishnu) and his elder brother Lord Balarama and sister Subhadra begins as the chariot or kang is pulled by numerous devotees.\n\nIn the state of Manipur the first Kang Chingba festival started during the reign of Maharaja Gambhir Singh in 1832 AD. (Source: e-pao.net)\n\nDevotees offer fruits, flowers and sweets to the deities from where the rath passes and sing sankirtanas (devotional songs accompanied by various musical instruments) during the journey followed by community feasts in the evening.\n\nThe Kang Chingba festival of Manipur takes place at the renowned Shri Govindajee Temple at the Royal Palace, Imphal.\n\nManipuri Ushop or ceremonial meals comprises of no garlic no onion delicacies cooked and served by the Bamon or Brahmin cooks. Traditional Manipuri fine dining and ceremonial meals are “sit down” affairs which are had together by sitting on the floor.\n\nTraditionally, Kangi gi khechri is served in a thambal/lotus leaf in the state of Manipur, it seems the aroma of the khechri and the fragrant lotus leaf makes the khechri more tastier. However back in my hometown we eat these delicacies served on La or plantain/banana leaves due to the unavailability of lotus leaves.\n\nComing back to today’s special post, these recipes are very close to my heart since I have grown up relishing both the delicacies each year during this festival.\n\nKang gi Khechri\n\n1/2 (120 ml) cup aromatic Jeera/Gobindobhog/Kanaki rice or long grain Basmati rice, wash and soak in water for about 30-35 mins\n\n1/3 cup (80 ml) Yellow Lentil/Arhar/Tuvar Dal, washed and pre-soaked in water for an hour or two\n\n1/2 tsp whole Spices (fennel/saunf, nigella/kalonji, fenugreek/methi, cumin/jeera seeds)\n\n1/2 tsp whole Cumin seeds\n\n1/2 Tbsp Ginger, julienne or finely chopped\n\n1 Tbsp Chinese Chive/Maroi Nakuppi leaves, finely chopped into equal length (1/2 inch) (add chives if available else you can skip)\n\n2 Bay leaves\n\n2-3 whole dry Red Chillies/Pepper\n\n1/2 tsp Turmeric powder\n\nSalt for seasoning\n\n2 1/2 Tbsp Mustard or white oil for tempering\n\nWater\n\n1 tsp Clarified butter/Ghee\n\nMethod\n\n1.In a pressure cooker or a heavy-bottomed pot add two cups of water and pressure cook until a single whistle or boil the lentil for 10 mins or until half-cooked.\n\n2.Add the pre-soaked rice, turmeric powder, salt and cook for another 10 mins on low flame until the water reduces and bubbles start forming on the mixture. (you can add 1/2 cup or 100 ml water to the boiling lentil before adding rice and other ingredients)\n\n3.Heat a small wok or pan add the mustard oil let it smoke. Turn off the stove and let the smoking subside. Add the whole spices mixture, cumin seeds, bay leaves, dry red chillies and the chives at the end.\n\n4.Pour the tempered spices, oil and a tsp of clarified butter/ghee onto the lentil and rice mixture.Gently mix it with the cooked khechri using a fork. Cover and let cook for 3-4 mins on low before turning off the flame.\n\nAnother inherited recipe from my Ima (Mother) is that of Ooti. Today have come with her classic and simple Ooti recipe to be paired with the Khechri. There are variations of ooti but for this special occasion the below recipe is the best.\n\nNo further delay in sharing the recipe of Ima’s Manggan Ushoi Ooti, dried yellow peas with bamboo shoots. I have added some jackfruit seeds, this can be skipped.\n\nManggan Ushoi Ooti\n\n1/2 cup dried Yellow peas/Manggan/Safed Matar, washed and soaked overnight\n\n1/4 cup (60 ml) dried or fresh Bamboo shoots, sliced (if using dried bamboo shoots then overnight soaking is highly recommended)\n\n7-8 Jackfruit/Theibong/Phanas/Kathal seeds, peeled and skinned partially(optional)\n\n1/2 tsp whole Spices (fennel/saunf, nigella/kalonji, fenugreek/methi, cumin/jeera seeds)\n\n1 tsp whole Cumin seeds\n\n1 Tbsp Ginger, julienne or finely chopped\n\n1 Tbsp Chinese Chive/Maroi Nakuppi leaves, finely chopped into equal length (1/2 inch) optional as per availability\n\n2 Bay leaves\n\n2-3 whole dry Red Chillies/Pepper\n\n1/2 tsp Cooking or Baking soda\n\nSalt for seasoning\n\n2 1/2 Tbsp Mustard or white oil for tempering\n\nWater\n\nMethod\n\n1.Pressure cook the soaked peas to a single whistle on high flame with enough water to cover the peas. Let the pressure settle.\n\n2.Next uncover the lid and add the soda, bamboo shoots, jackfruit seeds, salt and boil on medium heat until done. (You can add little more water, about 1 cup/200ml)\n\n3.In the mean while, heat a small frying pan with mustard oil until smoking hot. Turn off the flame, let the smoking reduce and add whole spices, cumin seeds, julienne ginger, whole chillies, bay leaves, chopped chives.\n\n4.Pour this tempered spice mixture and the oil onto the boiling ooti mixture and let simmer for 4-5 mins.\n\n5.Once done add a tsp of clarified butter/ghee to the Ooti and turn off the heat. Serve it hot with the Khechri."
