        "text": "Avengers 5 will reportedly no longer be subtitled The Kang Dynasty.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has detailed what it believes are the changes that Marvel Studios is making following a difficult 2023, and one of the biggest changes is that it is apparently stepping away from the villain that recent projects have been setting up.\n\nKang was first teased at the end of Loki season one, while Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania showcases hundreds of variants ready to get revenge for the defeat of the 'main' Kang that happened in the film.\n\nRelated: Every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, ranked from worst to best\n\nKang actor Jonathan Majors was dropped by Marvel after he was found guilty of assault and harassment, and while it is not known whether the character is going to be recast or completely written out, the reported Avengers 5 name change is a sign that the studio is downplaying Kang's importance.\n\nApparently, however, this was something that Marvel had been considering since the box office disappointment of Quantumania.\n\nWhatever happens with Kang, it is not the only retooling going on at Marvel Studios, as returning Disney boss Bob Iger has stated that the MCU spread itself too thinly with multiple yearly movies and streaming shows, and will now tighten its focus to try and keep the quality up and avoid fatigue.\n\nRelated: The Marvels nearly had a different ending with a major death\n\n\"Maybe the cadence was a little too aggressive,\" he said last year.\n\n\"...Because the streaming platforms require so much volume, one has to question whether that's the right direction to go, or if you can be more curated, more... picky about what you're making, and to concentrate on quality and not volume.\"\n\nMarvel's next film, Deadpool & Wolverine, will be released in cinemas on July 26.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
