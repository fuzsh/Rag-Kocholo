        "text": "The name changing within the Avengers franchise started with Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. This was due to the assault and domestic violence charges faced by Jonathan Majors, who was set to play the supervillain Kang the Conqueror. Subsequently, Disney announced that the name was changed to Avengers 5, and Majors was dropped from the project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sixth movie, on the other hand, was titled Avengers: Secret Wars for the time being. Now a Marvel Update page on X has dropped a post that features that the sixth movie will get a new title as well. While still a rumor, it has created a tense situation amongst the fans, who have a lot of words to add on the matter.\n\nIs Avengers: Secret Wars getting a new title or is it just a rumor?\n\nThe official announcement for Avengers 5 and Avengers 6 came during the San Diego Comic-Con 2022 by Kevin Feige. While the public was expecting a fifth movie, the sixth one came as a total surprise. Both, titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, were scheduled to appear in the sixth phase of the MCU. However, while everything was going according to plan, the arrest of Jonathan Majors created a major controversy for Marvel Studios as well as Disney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe aftereffects of which the title of the fifth movie was brought down to a generic Avengers 5. Now, the rumor mill is churning out another piece of gossip. A page with the name Marvel Updates has posted on X that Avengers: Secret Wars is also getting a new title. The rumored news, however, is not sitting well with the fans.\n\nIn response to the news, one fan conveyed his feelings with a definite “no.” It’s interesting to note that none of the major studios have announced anything about the alleged post, and as of right now, Avengers: Secret Wars is still going by its original name.\n\nThis much-awaited film is slated to serve as a crucial conclusion for Phase 6 of the MCU. As implied by Jonathan Hickman’s Secret Wars narrative, this would go further with the multiverse’s dramatic development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans have mixed feelings about this supposed name change rumor\n\nThere has been no confirmation about the recently shared post from Marvel Studios or Disney. But followers have expressed a range of opinions in the comments section, sparking a heated debate. A supporter stated that the public is already aware of the stellar lineup and backed the name change. Further, ‘Secret Wars’ seems misaligned with the title given that this project is going to take over multiple universes, which the public is already aware of.\n\nAnother user, on the other hand, was not that thrilled with the name change. He added that Secret Wars is among Marvel’s most popular and iconic storylines. Further, a different name would suggest that the multi-universes won’t be explored extensively.\n\nAnother commenter brought up the idea that the name change might make sense if the film included battle world sequences where characters like Doom, Kang, and Beyonder controlled both protagonists and antagonists. Additionally, this would aid in accurately portraying the scenario without endangering the iconic plot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother user added that if the studios are bringing in Doctor Doom for the movie, then the name change would work given that the character would require a little more preparation time. Interestingly, Marvel has been hinting for a while now that Victor Von, aka Doctor Doom, is a part of the MCU. The character has been a mainstay of Marvel comics, and fans have long yearned for him to be a part of the MCU (via Screen Rant). However, only time will tell whether he comes out as the ultimate villain or not.\n\nOthers, however, simply did not believe the authenticity of the news. And we are further waiting for either Marvel Studios or Disney to make an official announcement.\n\nAvengers: The Kang Dynasty is scheduled for a theatrical release on May 2, 2025, and Avengers: Secret Wars on May 1, 2026."
