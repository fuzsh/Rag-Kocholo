        "text": "Summary+\n\nA variety of societal barriers still prevalent in the United States today contribute to several challenges faced by people with disabilities. These barriers include limited accessibility, inadequate educational structures, and poverty, and negatively impact the quality of life for people with disabilities. Such factors often lead to undesirable consequences for people with disabilities such as social exclusion, negative stereotypes and perceptions, financial hardship, and challenges in the areas of both physical and mental health. Some of the best practices to help reduce the consequences of these factors focus on creating environments—in areas such as the workplace or on college campuses—that seek to accommodate people with disabilities and anticipate the challenges they may face.\n\nKey Takeaways+\n\nPeople with disabilities in the United States continue to experience challenges of accessibility in many aspects of their lives, including navigating physical facilities, finding employment in the workplace, having access to adequate healthcare equipment, and feeling supported in areas of education.\n\nNegative or limiting stereotypes of people with disabilities, prevalent in general societal attitudes and various forms of popular media, contribute to social isolation and exclusion among people with disabilities.\n\nSignificantly lower rates of employment among people with disabilities contributes to high rates of poverty, financial hardship, and mental health challenges.\n\nKey Terms+\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act—The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in several areas, including employment, transportation, public accommodations, communications, and access to state and local government programs and services.1\n\nAutism spectrum disorder—A developmental disability characterized by persistent impairments in social interaction and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities.2\n\nCerebral palsy—A group of neurological disorders that appear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement, muscle coordination, and balance.3\n\nComprehensive transition program—A postsecondary degree, certificate, or non‐degree program sponsored by a college or career and technical education center that is approved by the US Department of Education and is designed to support students with intellectual disabilities as they continue to receive instruction in academic, career, and independent living to prepare for gainful employment.4\n\nDisability—A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.5\n\nDisability adjusted life years (DALYs)—The sum of the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and the years lived with a disability (YLDs) due to prevalent cases of the disease or health condition in a population. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health.6\n\nFair Housing Amendments Act of 1988—Prohibits discrimination by direct providers of housing . . . whose discriminatory practices make housing unavailable to persons because of race or color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.7\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act—A law that makes available free public education to eligible children with disabilities throughout the nation and ensures special education and related services to those children.8\n\nMultiple sclerosis—Involves an immune-mediated process in which an abnormal response of the body’s immune system is directed against the central nervous system.9\n\nPersons with disabilities (PWDs)—Refers to those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.10\n\nThe Rehabilitation Act of 1973—Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs conducted by federal agencies, in programs receiving federal financial assistance, in federal employment, and in the employment practices of federal contractors.11\n\nSection 504—A national law that protects qualified individuals from discrimination based on disability. The nondiscrimination requirements of the law apply to employers and organizations that receive financial assistance from any federal department or agency, including the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).12\n\nSocial inclusion—A desired goal that requires equality of opportunity and participation in the rudimentary and fundamental functions of society.13\n\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—The largest federal nutrition assistance program. SNAP provides benefits to eligible low-income individuals and families via an electronic benefits transfer card. This card can be used like a debit card to purchase eligible food in authorized retail food stores.14\n\nUnconscious bias—Social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness.15\n\nOne common area of accessibility issues is physical accessibility. In the past, most public transportation, bathrooms, and buildings were not equipped with aids to help PWDs. This issue is a main area that the ADA aimed to address, and the requirements laid out by the act included a requirement for establishments to include wheelchair accessible stalls in their bathrooms.45 The ADA did not completely eradicate physical accessibility challenges, but it did help to reduce them.\n\nOne recurring complaint about bathroom accessibility comes from parents of children with disabilities. One of their primary concerns with “accessible” bathrooms is that the stalls are not spacious enough for children with disabilities who require assistance going to the bathroom.46 Additionally, most bathrooms do not offer large enough (or clean enough) changing stations to accommodate older children with disabilities, and parents are forced to lay their children on the floor and change them there instead. For example, one mother pointed out that Disney World’s restrooms were inaccessible for older children with disabilities, and she had to change her son on the bathroom floor.47 One possible reason for a lack of progress in this area is a lack of awareness. One mother admitted that because most parents of children with disabilities know that the majority of public bathrooms are inaccessible, they prefer to take their children home early from the public places or events to use a bathroom at home. As another mother pointed out, this solution leads to its own problems: “Unfortunately, what we are now forced into more often due to my son's age is to go home before the end of the movie, the soccer game, the concert. And he is missing out on what his peers take for granted . . . Families like ours . . . don't go out!”48 Thus, the absence of public bathrooms that are accessible for children with disabilities exclude the children from exploring public places or fully participating in community events.\n\nOne example of these negative stereotypes is found in the major motion picture, Me Before You, a story about a quadriplegic man who chooses assisted suicide after finding his life devoid of meaning. As one quadriplegic reviewer stated in his review in The Chicago Tribune, “the hazardous risk in movies like [Me Before You] is that it romanticizes and glamorizes an early exit for those who already feel marginalized, who feel they are living on borrowed time . . . the blatant subtext of Me Before You . . . only makes people like me feel we have to justify our preference not to commit suicide. In this right-to-die climate, we’re forced to defend our right to live, albeit as expensive, high-maintenance disabled folks.”71 As the United Nations points out, PWDs are “often negatively stereotyped and not appropriately represented”72 in the media. Movies such as Me Before You treat PWDs as “objects of pity, charity or medical treatment that [must] overcome a tragic and disabling condition or conversely, presented as superheroes who have accomplished great feats, so as to inspire the non-disabled.”73 This type of incorrect or idealized representation presented in the media is not only damaging to the self-perceptions of PWDs but can also contribute to the maintaining of incorrect perceptions about PWDs in the minds of the general population.\n\nAlthough IDEA and other laws helped improve the availability of educational resources, children with disabilities still encounter social and academic barriers in their education. One study found that disabled elementary school students, particularly those enrolled in special education programs, typically had less academic achievements in comparison to their nondisabled classmates, were held to lower expectations by their peers and teachers, and were more likely to drop out of school in their later years.79 These outcomes sometimes happen as a result of social exclusion or due to educators’ inability to meet their disabled students' needs. IDEA requires disabled students to be included and integrated into the same classrooms as their nondisabled peers, except in some extreme cases.\n\nDespite the efforts of IDEA to help students with disabilities in their education, one main problem comes from a lack of proper funding given to the schools to help support the needs of students with disabilities. When IDEA was first introduced, the act aimed to cover up to 40% of the programming expenses for students with Individualized Education programs (IEPs). However, federal funding has never covered the full amount—today, the government covers less than 18% of the total costs for IEPs.80 According to interviews conducted with Department of Education officials, state and local administrators, and parent organizations, most participants agree that additional federal funding would “improve outcomes for students with disabilities.”81 Also, some schools that receive IDEA related funding are not in “compliance” with the guidelines and aims of IDEA, so participants argued that schools who receive the funding should better adhere to the goals outlined by IDEA.82\n\nWhile some PWDs experience poverty due to their low employment levels, some PWDs may also stay impoverished due to payments or debt related to medical expenses. In fact, 26.5% of households that have at least one member with a disability have outstanding medical debt, in comparison to 11.4% of households without any disability. Although scholars have not examined specific connections between disability and households with high medical debt (debt that reached above 20% of the household’s annual income), the US Census Bureau did find that 11.3% of households living below the poverty line had high medical debt, in comparison to 3% of households living above poverty level.85 Thus, if PWDs are more likely to live in impoverished areas, it is also likely that at least some of them have medical debt.\n\nThe Census Bureau also found a relationship between poverty and childhood disability rates. Their report states, “in 2019, children in the lowest income quintile—defined here as falling within the bottom 20% of the household income distribution in the United States in 2019—were more likely to experience disability than children in the highest income quintile.” Several scholars debate whether increased poverty leads to disabilities in children, especially behavioral disorders or intellectual disabilities, or whether caring for a child with disabilities leads to increased poverty. Both explanations are possible; regardless of the explanation for the correlation, poverty and disability are evidently connected to one another.\n\nOne frequently overlooked consequence of having a disability is social exclusion. As one scholar notes, social exclusion among PWDs is a complex issue, because a PWD can be socially accepted in certain settings, such as within their immediate family, but may simultaneously experience social exclusion in other facets of their lives, such as at the workplace or in their local community.86 Additionally, social exclusion can happen to PWDs at any stage of their lives, including at young ages and while in elementary school. One study conducted in Ontario, Canada, interviewed fifteen elementary school students with cerebral palsy. The study found that the children were victims of “implicit” social exclusion, meaning that their peers were simply unaware of their disability or that the students with cerebral palsy required accommodations. Children who experienced implicit social exclusion, then, were excluded simply because they were unable to participate. This inability to participate was often due to a lack of accommodation that, if remedied, would allow the child to be included in activities with other students. Another type of exclusion observed in the study was “explicit” or intentional social exclusion, accomplished through methods such as “verbal and physical bullying.” Although this study was conducted outside of the United States, the negative social experiences reported by these children illustrate the different types of harmful repercussions that children with disabilities may face.87 This study explained that children with disabilities are also more vulnerable to social exclusion because they tend to have fewer friendships, which would likely protect them against bullying.\n\nFor example, in 2020, the parents of a former Aggies Elevated student filed a lawsuit against Utah State University after the college expelled their daughter with down syndrome. Although the university responded to the lawsuit and claimed that it grossly misrepresented the real facts of the Aggies Elevated program, the student’s mother outlined several actions of the program that concerned her. First, one of the professor’s assistants wrote to the mother that they “​​had never had a student with Down syndrome” and didn’t know “what to do with her.” Second, the student was promised that she would receive the several resources outlined in the Aggies Elevated program, including a mentor to help her navigate campus and a tutor to help her with her homework, among other forms of assistance. However, the lawsuit claimed that the program never provided these resources.\n\nAfter removing the student from a school dance for “dancing inappropriately,” school officials in charge of the Aggies Elevated program required the student to sign a restrictive behavior contract, and when she broke that contract, she was expelled. The lawsuit stated that the Aggies Elevated “subjected [the student to a version of college discipline that was wholly unlike that experienced by nondisabled students.”119 Even if some of the facts presented by the lawsuit were, as Utah University claims, exaggerated, the Aggies Elevated program could still benefit from examining the areas of their program that are inadequate to meet the needs of enrolled students with intellectual disabilities."
