This early documentary from Werner Herzog looks at the way people with physical disabilities were treated in West Germany in the late 60's / early 70's. It compares this with the manner things were contrastingly done in the U.S.A. The findings conclude that the Americans were far more progressive than the Germans on this issue.

At the time, special buildings were built for disabled kids to live with their families. On the surface this seems good but these were, in effect, a means of hiding those unfortunate people away as much as an aid to assisting them. Bearing in mind the time period, it was only twenty odd years after the end of the Second World War; a period where Germany was ruled by the Nazi party, who actively pursued the extermination of disabled people whom they considered inferior. It seems like a little of this unpleasant sentiment still resided in the new Germany of the 70's. There are many interviews with the afflicted children. These are mainly pretty sad on account of the fact that they didn't really see any worthwhile future ahead of them, hence the title of the film.

As a documentary it works as a look back at a situation from another time. It's useful for this specific purpose but of course this specific issue has changed considerably over the years and, hence, this film is more of an interesting time capsule than anything essential.
