Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx

(1916-1995)

At home, Lord North Street, London

Wilson served as Labour Prime Minister, 1964–70 and 1974–76. He is pictured in the sitting-room of his small, eighteenth-century house.

‘Sir Harold asked if he might use his pipe’, said Schwartz. ‘I replied that by all means I hoped he would. We entered into a deep discussion concerning manufacturing, and before long he was puffing with vigour. I was somewhat afraid that too much smoke would spoil the portrait. Happily, I did not ask him to stop.’
