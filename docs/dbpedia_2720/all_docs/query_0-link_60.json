Yet Harold Wilson could claim to have been the first ‘meritocratic’ Prime Minister, coming up through a public education system which enabled him to compete with, and outshine, his contemporaries from upper- and middle-class backgrounds. Like his four predecessors — Attlee, Eden, Macmillan and Home — and three of his successors — Heath, Thatcher and Blair — he was an Oxford graduate, but his academic achievements surpassed all of theirs."
