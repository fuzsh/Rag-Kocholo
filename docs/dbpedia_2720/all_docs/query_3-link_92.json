        "text": "PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced that Harold Daleus, Jr., 49, of Bethlehem, PA, was sentenced to 20 years in prison to be followed by a lifetime of supervised release by United States District Judge John M. Gallagher for production of child pornography and related offenses.\n\nFor years, Daleus wired money to the Philippines, in exchange for live access to the sexual abuse of children. Daleus paid Filipino child sex traffickers over $24,000, in order to view the live transmissions of children being sexually abused at his direction.\n\nIn December 2022, Homeland Security Investigations seized Daleus’ electronic devices from his home and identified dozens of videos and images depicting the sexual abuse and exploitation of prepubescent children. The defendant was indicted in August 2023 and subsequently pleaded guilty to production of child pornography, the use of the internet to entice a minor to engage in sexual conduct, receipt of child pornography, and possession of child pornography.\n\nHomeland Security Investigations worked with law enforcement in the Philippines to secure convictions abroad of the involved child sex traffickers.\n\n“Harold Daleus paid for the ongoing sexual abuse of numerous children, providing explicit instructions for the vile acts that he wanted to watch in real time,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “Whether they’re here at home or half a world away, we must protect our vulnerable young kids from exploitation by predators and traffickers. This sentence ensures accountability for Daleus and some measure of justice for those he victimized.”\n\n“HSI’s global reach, cybercrime expertise and dedication to protecting children in the U.S. and abroad has enabled us to bring this dangerous predator to justice,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge of HSI Philadelphia Nathan R. Abel. “Our partnership with the tremendous prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania continues to produce results for the American public and protect innocent children around the world.”\n\nThe case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, Allentown Resident Office, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Priya T. De Souza and Tatum Wilson."
