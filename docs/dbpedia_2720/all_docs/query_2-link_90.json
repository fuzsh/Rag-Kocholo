        "text": "Former Head Boy of Wirral Grammar School served as Premier in the '60s and '70s\n\nWHEN Britain was swinging in the 1960s, we associate Merseyside’s contribution to the era with music more than matters Parliamentary.\n\nBut we must never forget that from 1964 to 1970 (and again from 1974 to 1976), the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom was also the MP for Huyton,\n\n‌\n\nJames Harold Wilson, better known by his middle name, would have been 100 years old today.\n\nAlthough born in Huddersfield, his Merseyside roots took hold after his father, also called James, decided to move to Spital in Wirral to find work and Wilson Junior went on to join the sixth form of Wirral Grammar School for Boys in Bebington. He impressed so much, he was made Head Boy.\n\nFrom there he studied Modern History at Oxford University and it was in the chapel of Mansfield College that he married Mary Baldwin on New Year’s Day 1940. He became MP for Ormskirk in 1945 then a constituency change in 1950 created the new seat of Huyton. He was narrowly elected then - but managed to keep the seat for a further 33 years.\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from ECHO Daily News\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nWilson became renowned as a speaker of wit and when Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell died in 1963 - ahead of a General Election the party was convinced they could win - Wilson was put forward as a left-wing candidate for party leader and beat more-fancied opposition George Brown and James Callaghan to the job. His best-remembered speech, at the 1963 Labour Party conference, referenced the “white heat” of technological change that should shape the future of the country.\n\nHarold Wilson Gallery\n\n‌\n\nThe Profumo affair had already tainted Harold Macmillan’s Tory government in the public’s eyes and helped Wilson - now fighting Macmillan’s successor Alec Douglas-Home - to a narrow 1964 election victory of just a four seat majority.\n\nDuring his time in office, groundbreaking laws were passed regarding abortion, censorship, the death penalty, the voting age and the decriminilisation of homosexuality.\n\n‌\n\nOn top of this, he was also one of the first modern day Prime Ministers to embrace popular culture. He made The Beatles and the stars of Coronation Street just as welcome at the swanky affairs held at Number 10 as he did visiting Presidents, dignitaries and royalty.\n\nA gamble on calling an early election in 1966 boosted his majority to a healthier 96 seats but he then lost in 1970 to new Conservative leader Edward Heath, despite the polls suggesting Wilson could take a third term.\n\nHe returned to office after the second of 1974’s elections (the first resulted in a hung Parliament) where one of his key issues was Britain’s membership of the EEC (or Common Market as it was more popularly known).\n\n‌\n\nHe resigned on March 16, 1976, claiming he had always planned on calling it a day at 60. The Queen came to dinner at Downing Street to mark his departure, an honour she had only previously bestowed on Winston Churchill.\n\nIn retirement, Wilson pursued his love of Gilbert and Sullivan opera and even appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special in 1978, pretending not to recognise Eric Morecambe and continually mispronouncing his name.\n\nHe died on May 24, 1995, aged 79. He is buried on the Isles of Scilly, the place he and his family would regularly holiday.\n\n‌\n\nHe certainly earned his rest."
