THE PDC Unicorn World Youth Championship Last 64 will take place at the Barnsley Metrodome on Friday March 22 2013.

The third staging of the tournament will feature 64 players initially competing down to the final in Barnsley, before the last two players face off for the title at The O2 in London during the McCoy's Premier League Darts Play-Offs on Thursday May 16.

Following the recent changes within Rileys, the PDC will not now be able to stage regional qualifying events for the World Youth Championship and will now take the leading 48 players, plus ties, from the final 2012 PDC Unicorn Youth Tour Order of Merit to qualify by right.

They will be joined in the Last 64 by a series of International Qualifiers, with some events having already taken place and further knockouts to be held in the coming weeks.

Details will be posted on this website of qualifying tournaments and winners once finalised.

The top eight players from the final Youth Tour Order of Merit will be seeded for the World Youth Championship, with the remaining players to be drawn at random.
