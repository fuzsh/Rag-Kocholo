The World Championship takes place at Alexandra Palace in north London, with about two and a half thousand fans attending each session. The players walk on into the arena, escorted by oche girls, to the sound of music, with flashing lights, dancers on stage and the crowd singing along, to add even more buzz to proceedings, and providing different photo opportunities which contribute to the set of images that I will send out for newspapers, magazines and online clients.
