        "text": "Luke Littler cruised into the semi-finals of the PDC World Darts Championship, beating No 28 seed Brendan Dolan 5-1 and banking himself at least £100,000.\n\nThe 16-year-old sensation raced into a 4-0 lead, dazzling the crowd at London’s Alexandra Palace, as he hit several ton-plus finishes.\n\nDolan struck back in the fifth set but “The Nuke” sealed his place in the final four with ease, finishing the match with an average of 101.93 and 47 per cent on checkouts.\n\nThe teenager is the youngest ever player to reach the semi-finals of the World Championship, and has been called a “generational talent”. He is also the reigning world youth champion.\n\nWhen does Luke Littler play next?\n\nLittler next plays Rob Cross on the evening of Tuesday 2 January in the semi-finals.\n\nShould he beat the No 8 seed and former world champion, Littler will proceed to Wednesday’s final where he will have a shot at completing one of the sport’s greatest fairytales.\n\nCross sealed an incredible comeback against Chris Dobey in Monday’s first quarter-final. Cross looked dead and buried when he was 4-0 down after barely 45 minutes as Dobey played one of the matches of his life.\n\nHowever, the off-stage break worked wonders for Cross as the former electrician sparked into life. He reeled off four sets of his own and then took out 130 to seal a famous win.\n\nBut he knows he will have to improve if he is to stop the Littler train.\n\n“Everyone loves an underdog story,” Cross said. “As the public and people looking at the game, everyone loves an underdog story.\n\n“I am not being rude, I am on his side, I love an underdog story. It took a bit of pressure off me winning it first time [in 2018] as well.\n\n“He’s fantastic and he deserves all the luck in the world, he is a nice young boy. Tomorrow we play darts, though, and I have to go down to business.”\n\nLittler will have no fear though. He has already beaten Christian Kist, Andrew Gilding and Matt Campbell in his first World Championship, before toppling five-time champion Raymon van Barneveld and then Dolan.\n\nHe has averaged over 105 in two of his games, an impressive feat for a player of any age, while also hitting a 164 checkout against Campbell.\n\nMost bookies now have him as the 9-4 second favourite behind Luke Humphries to win the prestigious tournament at Alexandra Palace, having started the tournament at 66-1.\n\nFull schedule and fixtures for the 2024 World Darts Championship\n\nMonday 1 January\n\nAfternoon Session (12:30pm)\n\nChris Dobey 4-5 Rob Cross\n\nLuke Littler 5-1 Brendan Dolan\n\nEvening Session (7pm)\n\nMichael van Gerwen 3-5 Scott Williams\n\nLuke Humphries 5-1 Dave Chisnall\n\nTuesday 2 January (7:30pm)\n\nLuke Littler vs Rob Cross\n\nLuke Humphries vs Scott Williams"
