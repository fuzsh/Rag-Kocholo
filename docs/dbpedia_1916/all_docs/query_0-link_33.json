        "text": "Whatever happens from now on, Luke Littler's life has changed forever.\n\nThe 16-year-old has defied the odds to reach the semi-finals of the PDC World Championship - and many fans believe he's destined to win the whole thing. Littler faces ex-champion Rob Cross at the Alexandra Palace on Tuesday for a place in the final.\n\nLittler, who is the reigning PDC World Youth Champion, was in sensational form over Christmas. He knocked out reigning UK Open champion Andrew Gilding and five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld, to name just two of his high-profile scalps.\n\nLittler's latest triumph came on New Year's Day, as he hammered Brendan Dolan 5-1. Dolan was bang in form, having beaten former world champions Gerwyn Price and Gary Anderson on his way to the quarter-finals. But Littler still defeated the veteran with ease.\n\nThe teenager is guaranteed to receive a £100,000 cheque from the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) after reaching the semi-finals. So, what exactly could he spend that money on? Luckily, Littler explained his interests at a recent press conference.\n\nHe said: \"(I) just wake up, play on my Xbox, have some food and have a chuck on the board and go to bed, that's it. I don't engage with anything outside the house. I'm not into anything outside the house, whatever my mates get up to, so I just stay level-headed.\n\nDo you think Luke Littler will win the PDC World Championship? Let us know in the comments below!\n\n\"I think it's because I'm so young, I'm only 16 and I've got nothing to fear, I've got no one to fear because my game can be better than anyone on my day. And I've just show it there, I've just beat one of the best who's graced that stage (Van Barneveld).\"\n\nSo, it's fair to say Littler won't be spending his cash on a Ferrari ready for when he turns 17 later this month. The self-proclaimed level-headed youngster probably doesn't need a new Xbox either, although he can now afford to buy 263 of them if he wishes.\n\nLittler could buy a new home with his winnings. He can afford a two-bedroom terraced house worth £100,000 in his hometown of Runcorn in Cheshire.\n\nLittler can even afford the world's most expensive kebab! The darts sensation often gets a kebab after winning and has been told he can eat for free for the rest of his life at the Kebhouze chain in London if he goes on to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy on Wednesday.\n\nYet he'll be able to afford something a bit more expensive after his stellar run. Back in 2016, Onder Sahan - the head chef at the Hazev restaurant in Canary Wharf - unveiled a kebab worth £925. Known as 'The Royal', it kebab was made of the finest Japanese Wagyu beef, fresh morel mushrooms and 25-year-old Italian vinegar that cost £1.84 per millilitre.\n\nSahan's masterpiece included several other expensive ingredients. \"This kebab is not just the world's most expensive but it's authentic too, loyal to the origins of a dish that has evolved over thousands of years,\" said the proud head chef at the kebab's unveiling.\n\nEven if 'The Royal' is no longer on the menu, perhaps Littler can pay Sahan to re-create his masterpiece. It'll probably cost him a bit more than £925 with inflation, mind you. \"(My go-to order is) just the standard mayonnaise, lettuce, with doner wrap,\" Littler has said.\n\nAlthough the youngster has already pocketed £100,000, more cash will be heading in his direction. Sponsors will be lining up to work with him, while the PDC Order of Merit suggests most darts players earn some decent cash. World No.1 Michael Smith has earned £1,271,250 in prize money alone during the last two years.\n\nLittler's new-found fame could even land him a spot in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! The late Eric Bristow, who won five world titles, appeared on the show in 2012, while 16-time winner Phil Taylor recently declared his desire to sit around the campfire.\n\n\"Spiders I might be a bit dodgy with, I don't like spiders,\" recently laughed Taylor. It could be a long time before Littler puts down the arrows for a stint in the jungle. Contestants were paid between £40,000 and £1,500,000 to appear on I'm A Celeb last year.\n\nIf Littler beats Cross on Tuesday, he will be guaranteed a cheque for £200,000 as a finalist. He'll then take on the winner of the other semi-final between pre-tournament favourite Luke Humphries and Scott Williams, with overall winner banking £500,000.\n\nIt's apt that Littler is facing Cross, who knows exactly what it's like to take darts by storm, in the semi-finals. Back in 2018, the 33-year-old won the PDC World Championship in his debut appearance by beating the great Taylor in the final.\n\nCross' triumph was a fairytale. But if Littler can repeat the feat at the tender age of 16, it'll be nothing short of remarkable. All eyes are on the Alexandra Palace."
