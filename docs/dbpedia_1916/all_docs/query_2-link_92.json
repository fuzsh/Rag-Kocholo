        "text": "Phil Taylor crashed out of the PDC World Darts Championship in one of the biggest upsets seen at Alexandra Palace. The 16-times world champion produced an error-strewn display, struggling for rhythm, as he was beaten by 4-3 by Michael Smith in the second round.\n\nSmith, the 23-year-old world youth champion, finished Taylor off in style, producing 11- and 13-dart legs in the decider before clinching the set 4-2 on the bull.\n\nTaylor was too distraught too speak immediately afterwards but Smith reflected on his achievement in eliminating the defending champion. \"I can't speak, my heart's pounding, I think I will have a heart attack,\" the world No32 said. \"I showed I've got fight and battle and tenacity to keep up with the top players and proved I can play darts on TV.\n\n\"Now I'll have a good Christmas for once after not going out in the first round. This is life-changing.\"\n\nTaylor had sought to stamp his authority from the start and produced a 156 checkout to win the opening leg against the throw, rattling through the first set without missing a double. The second leg was a different story, though, as Taylor's accuracy on the doubles deserted him.\n\nBoth players went down to double one in the second leg, with Smith ending the agony on the way to levelling the match. Taylor started the third set slowly but fought back to edge into a 2-1 lead, only for Smith to punish more inconsistency from the world No1 to make it 2-2.\n\nTaylor lurched into a 3-2 lead after Smith threw away six darts to take the set but the young challenger was throwing the more fluent darts and made it 3-3. An 11-dart leg put Smith within one leg of the biggest win of his career and a 13-dart leg did so again at 3-2. This time he closed out the win, punching the air in celebration.\n\n\"When I broke in the second set I thought: 'I can beat him here,'\" Smith told Sky Sports. \"Neither of us could hold our throw and I thought: 'Just hold your throw once and you could win this,' because Phil was not on his game,\"\n\nEarlier Raymond van Barneveld survived a major scare against Jamie Caven before clinching a 4-3 victory. The five-times world champion fought back from a set down to take a 2-1 lead but Caven responded to go 3-2 ahead. He lacked the killer touch, though, to finish off the Dutchman, who battled back again to take a topsy-turvy contest.\n\n\"What a player,\" Van Barneveld said of Caven. \"He was never ever missing doubles tonight. That's why he kept me under pressure.\"\n\nPeter Wright was also a second-round winner as he saw off Per Laursen 4-2."
