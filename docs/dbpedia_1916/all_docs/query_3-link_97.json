        "text": "Michael van Gerwen was threatening to become a darting enigma.\n\nHe burst onto the scene as a fresh-faced 17-year-old in 2006, when he won the BDO’s World Masters, and several other blistering displays in the months that followed made him seemingly destined for greatness.\n\nHowever, after moving to the superior PDC in 2007, he struggled.\n\nThe sense of inevitability he would soon be dominating world darts wavered and he became seen as an erratic and inconsistent player.\n\nCommentators, experts and fans seemed to forget that, as a teenager, setbacks were obviously going to come his way.\n\nThey started looking for reasons behind his defeats on TV, labelled him a disappointment and questioned whether he would ever fulfil his obvious talent.\n\nWhat they didn’t realise is that all those defeats and heartbreaks – including an agonising defeat to Phil Taylor in the 2008 World Championship first round, when he missed a dart at double 12 to win – were the making of him. They grounded him and ensured he would never take anything for granted.\n\nHowever, the criticism and defeats threatened to break van Gerwen.\n\nThe Dutchman slipped down the rankings and was forced to participate on the youth tour in order to regain his confidence.\n\nThis, seemingly, was the turning point for him.\n\nHe found his love of darts again. He found his love of winning again.\n\nvan Gerwen twice reached the final of the World Youth Championship and, despite losing on both occasions, he had re-found his belief.\n\nThe talent had never gone away and was always waiting to be sparked into life, and over the last 12 months, van Gerwen has delivered.\n\nHe has been much improved on TV and on the floor, and that culminated in last night’s thrilling 6-4 victory over Mervyn King to win the World Grand Prix.\n\nvan Gerwen had been 3-0 and 4-1 down, but dominated the closing stages in front of a delighted Dublin crowd.\n\nHe seems to have been around for a long time, but van Gerwen is still only 23. That must be frightening for the other players.\n\nHe is only going to get better, and with triumphs like this, his confidence is only going to soar further.\n\nvan Gerwen is capable of magic spells in matches to take the game away from his opponent, and that was in full evidence against King.\n\nThe Dutchman was occasionally erratic on his finishing doubles, but his scoring bought him so many darts at the double that his misses almost seemed irrelevant.\n\nHe won the match – and with it the tournament – with a brilliant 145 checkout to finish in the grandest of style.\n\nAs for King, he will have left Dublin wondering what might have been.\n\nAs an experienced professional, he should have closed the game out from a position of 4-1 up, but van Gerwen is capable of such blistering spells that you can never count him out.\n\nKing came across as a bitter loser in his TV interview following the loss and seemed to suggest he would have won if it wasn’t for the crowd’s behaviour (they repeatedly booed when he was on a double) but this is nothing more than a case of sour grapes.\n\nYes, the crowd were out of order in booing him, but King could not have expected anything else.\n\nHe seemed to cope pretty well with it when he went 3-0 and 4-1 up against van Gerwen, while his semi-final win over local hero Brendan Dolan was played in an even more fervent atmosphere.\n\nTo blame the crowd for his defeat will not help King’s fortunes in future, as it is likely supporters will only target him even more after seeing what a sore loser he is.\n\nThis has been in evidence before, most notably in his BDO days, when he was known to blame defeats on anything ranging from air conditioning to the length of the oche.\n\nHe also targeted van Gerwen before the match, criticising the Dutchman’s extravagant celebrations during matches, but he was out of order there, too.\n\nJust as King is entitled to keep his cool on stage after sinking crucial doubles, van Gerwen is entitled to let off steam.\n\nHis delight at success is part of the package of van Gerwen, and this enthusiasm is part of the reason fans get behind him, along with his fast pace and obvious talent.\n\nIt is understandable that King was deeply frustrated after throwing away the match from a dominant position, but his words afterwards will not have done him any favours.\n\nPlaying in the PDC, he has to expect raucous atmospheres and his behaviour in the past is always going to make him a target.\n\nIf he wants better playing conditions, he should go back to the BDO. No successful darts player with ambition would be so stupid, though.\n\nIt seems certain King will forget all about the atmosphere in Dublin the next time he looks in his bank account and sees an extra £40,000 in there – his runner-up prize.\n\nThe best prizes, players, excitement, competitions and prestige are on offer in the PDC, and with that comes certain negatives, like the crowd participation King so despises.\n\nAs for van Gerwen, he pocketed a cool £100,000 for his win and rocketed up to number eight in the world rankings.\n\nHe seems destined to continually improve that ranking as he has finally found his feet.\n\nvan Gerwen will now surely be installed as one of the favourites for the World Championships, which start in December.\n\nThe usual suspects – Taylor, Adrian Lewis (who van Gerwen beat in Dublin), James Wade and co – will take some beating in the most prestigious tournament in darts, but the Dutchman will be in the mix.\n\nThe confidence his triumph in Dublin will give him should carry van Gerwen to even greater heights, and he will be eager to prove himself again at Alexandra Palace.\n\nHe is a pure darting talent and has now provided two of the greatest moments of the year in darts – his nine-darter at the World Matchplay in Blackpool and now his maiden major triumph – with the promise of plenty more to follow.\n\nThe World Grand Prix may have been van Gerwen’s first PDC major title, but it certainly won’t be his last.\n\nUsually, the final comes to define the tournament that preceded it.\n\nHowever, there was so much drama, excitement and incredible action at this year’s PDC World Darts Championship that it was almost impossible for Adrian Lewis and Andy Hamilton to better what had gone before.\n\nThis was the tournament that had it all: wasp stings, gusts of wind, unbelievable comebacks, controversy over girlfriends, broken legs, shocks aplenty and cracking darts.\n\nThe final between Lewis and Hamilton turned out to be a case of after the Lord Mayor’s show, but that seemed almost irrelevant given the entertainment served up in the rounds before it.\n\nDarts is getting bigger and bigger and its popularity is sure to have reached new heights now.\n\nThere was a dramatic story from almost every night of action, starting with the first session where Mark Webster was edged out by Richie Burnett and Lewis had to come from 2-0 down to overcome Nigel Heydon after being stung by a wasp.\n\nLewis beat Hamilton in the final 7-3, but both had clearly reached their peak earlier in the tournament.\n\nLewis averaged just over 93 and Hamilton just over 90, at least five points down on their tournament averages.\n\nPerhaps it was the occasion that got to them, perhaps it was just tiredness after their semi-final dogfights.\n\nThere was the odd flash of brilliance from both players but overall their performances were disappointing, which was a shame after such a dramatic tournament.\n\nMany observers have claimed it was the best darts tournament in history, and it is hard to argue with that.\n\nThere were so many fantastic games and talking points, none more so than early exits for legends Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nTaylor’s second round loss to Dave Chisnall was a further signal players are not scared of the 15-time world champion anymore, although it would be foolish to write him off just yet.\n\nIt is not so long since he was sweeping everyone aside at the Grand Slam of Darts, and it is almost certain he will bounce back at the upcoming World Cup and Premier League.\n\nChisnall failed to capitalise on his triumph and lost 4-0 in the next round to Hamilton, who had himself been fortunate to beat Antonio Alcinas in the opening round.\n\nThe Spaniard played magnificently but so did Hamilton, with the 3-2 victory presumably giving him the belief to go all the way.\n\nAlso in the first round, last year’s losing finalist Gary Anderson should have lost to German Jyhan Artut before eventually winning a last leg shoot-out.\n\nSimon Whitlock played fantastically despite having a broken ankle and got to the semi-finals, where he ran into a determined Hamilton in the form of his life.\n\nThere were too many great games to mention them all, but the quarter-final between James Wade and John Part will go down as one of the best ever played at Alexandra Palace.\n\nPart showed his trademark character and doggedness to force a final set and eventually a deciding leg, but Wade pulled through with an 85 checkout to seal a magnificent win.\n\nThe semi-finals summed up the tournament.\n\nThe first, between Whitlock and Hamilton, was a see-saw battle between two players in great form and deserved to go all the way.\n\nHamilton came from 5-3 down to beat the Australian 6-5 in the latest installment of what is becoming an intriguing rivalry between the two.\n\nIn Blackpool at the World Matchplay last summer, Hamilton came from 15-8 down to beat Whitlock 16-15, and that may have played on the Australian’s mind as Hamilton got close to him at Alexandra Palace.\n\nIn the other semi-final, Lewis produced an even greater comeback to derail James Wade.\n\nWade – widely recognised as the greatest player never to win a world title – was 5-1 up only for the reigning champion to win five straight sets and take the match 6-5, showing that Lewis has such extreme confidence in his ability now that no situation is irretrievable.\n\nThe match also saw controversy, with a 20 minute delay due to a breeze coming across the stage.\n\nThe players were well within their rights to walk off until the problem was solved, and if anything it just added to the drama.\n\nThe tournament had seen almost everything before that, so it was only fitting there was one last surreal moment to cap off the drama.\n\nThis tournament also saw a number of players come of age, and those men will be more difficult to beat as a result of it.\n\nHamilton is the most obvious one, as he played the best darts of his career and reached his first world final.\n\nLewis will obviously be an even greater force now he has retained his world title, and it is hard to argue against his prediction he will win at least 10 World Championships.\n\nHe was barracked throughout the tournament for the arrogance he showed in pre and post-match interviews, but he won the title as he said he would and deserves respect for that.\n\nHis statements were disrespectful and breathtakingly arrogant, but he is likely to be even more bumptious next year.\n\nBelgium’s Kim Huybrechts also looks a real talent, with his unexpected run to the quarter-final again underlining the strength in depth of the PDC.\n\nHis girlfriend caused quite a stir in his match against Paul Nicholson, with the Geordie-Aussie blaming his defeat on the repeated appearances of her on the big screen.\n\nJohn Part now looks back to his best and will be a contender for majors again, while youngsters like Michael van Gerwen and Devon Petersen underlined their potential with impressive displays.\n\nWhat the tournament did prove is that there will be life after Phil Taylor and Raymond van Barneveld for darts.\n\nA few years ago, the sport was reliant on them but there are so many great players and characters now that darts’ popularity will continue regardless.\n\nThe fact Taylor and van Barneveld were barely mentioned after their early exits shows there was never a dull moment in this World Championship, the tournament which just kept delivering.\n\nThere are several matches from this year’s tournament which will go down as some of the best in darts history, and it all whets the appetite for the Premier League.\n\nTaylor, Wade, Anderson and Lewis have already secured their places, while the four wildcards will be announced tonight.\n\nHamilton and Whitlock should be certainties after their World Championships performances, while van Barneveld is likely to win a place due to his legendary status.\n\nThe further place could go to anybody, but arguably Nicholson should get it due to his ‘bad boy’ image and lack of respect for big-name players.\n\nThe World Championships will be some act to follow but the quality of darts is so high it is very hard to see the Premier League not delivering.\n\nLewis will go into it ultra-confident after defending his world title, but Taylor will still be the man to beat as he is still the best player in the world.\n\nDarts is on a high and in truth, anyone could win the Premier League.\n\nThe opening fixtures can’t come soon enough.\n\nWhen Dave Chisnall sunk his winning double six to knock Phil Taylor out of the World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace last night, you could almost hear the cheers of the other players left in the tournament.\n\nEach of them can now sense a real chance of becoming world champion and writing their name in the history books.\n\nTaylor may not have been in vintage form, but would still have had far too much for most players.\n\nHis reputation alone is sometimes enough to see him through, but Chisnall was not overawed and if anything it was he who was doing the bullying.\n\nChisnall’s power scoring is up there with the likes of Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson, but it is his doubles which have let him down in the past.\n\nOn this occasion though, he barely missed a double and that was the difference.\n\nWhenever Taylor gave him a chance, he took it.\n\nThat threw Taylor off his game and he started missing doubles, while his trademark high checkouts never came to fruition.\n\nWhen Taylor is up against a talented opponent like Chisnall, he normally demoralises them with high finishes, in the 130-170 bracket, but his highest checkout against Chisnall was just 70 and that tells you all you need to know.\n\nHe missed two darts at a double in the opening leg and later said that put him off his game, and that is very unlike Taylor.\n\nUsually, he can put disappointments to one side and continue hammering the big scores, but there was clearly something not right with him yesterday.\n\nTaylor didn’t play badly – his average was above 100, after all – but he didn’t take his chances when they materialised and that is so unlike him.\n\nAll the credit must go to Chisnall, though.\n\nEveryone knew he had the talent to beat Taylor but it was unclear whether he had the temperament and audacity to do it on the big stage.\n\nTo beat the 15-times world champion is one thing, but to beat him 4-1, at a stage of the tournament he had never lost before, was stunning.\n\nIt would have been easy for him to suffer from nerves in the closing stages but he was on for a nine-darter in the final leg after two straight 180s, so it is clear his temperament is excellent.\n\nChisnall only joined the PDC in January but he has already made great strides, and this win should give him the confidence to compete at the business end of tournaments consistently.\n\nOther players would rather face him than Taylor though and so the tournament has now opened up and is anyone’s to win.\n\nThis is not the end for Taylor – after all, it is only a matter of weeks since he swept everyone aside at the Grand Slam with averages in excess of 110.\n\nHe will be back and will win more major titles, but will never be as dominant as he once was.\n\nThere are too many other exceptional players out there and so Taylor is inevitably going to take the odd beating now.\n\nHe is not as feared as he once was as opponents have seen he is beatable, so the next few years could be the most challenging of his career.\n\nIf Chisnall can continue this form and keep hitting his doubles, he will be a major contender for the championship.\n\nHe is a former Lakeside runner-up and so has the experience of going deep into big tournaments, so has to be in the running.\n\nHe will face Andy Hamilton in the next round – a match which is sure to be a real battle – but should fancy his chances of a real tilt at the title.\n\nAdrian Lewis will feel more confident of defending his crown now Taylor is out, although he has been unconvincing thus far.\n\nGary Anderson is the new favourite to win the tournament, although he will have to improve to stand a chance.\n\nPaul Nicholson does not lack confidence and is playing some great darts, so he could be the dark horse for the title.\n\nJames Wade has the experience of winning majors and has been consistent in his two matches, John Part has been there and done it in the World Championships, Simon Whitlock is in fantastic form despite having a broken ankle, Kevin Painter has renewed confidence after his first major win, Terry Jenkins looked magnificent in the first two sets against Co Stompe and Michael Van Gerwen has the talent to go all the way.\n\nThis tournament certainly is there for the taking and everyone left in must feel confident of creating history.\n\nChisnall has as much of a chance as anybody after his fantastic win over Taylor, and his lack of nerves on the big stage could make all the difference.\n\nTaylor will not be adding to his 15 world titles this year but don’t write him off just yet.\n\nTitle number 16 could be just a year away.\n\nFor one lucky player though, title number one (except for Lewis and Part) could be just around the corner.\n\nThe sight of Phil Taylor celebrating another trophy win on the big stage is a familiar one.\n\nBut even by his standards, his emphatic 16-4 win against Gary Anderson in the Grand Slam of Darts final was extraordinary.\n\nOnce Taylor was ahead, there was never any chance of the Scot Anderson launching a comeback as the 15-time world champion simply never let him.\n\nThere is not much more Anderson could have done, although his checkout percentage was almost half that of Taylor’s and that was a crucial factor.\n\nBut overall, Taylor simply outplayed Anderson and would have beaten anyone on this form.\n\nWhenever he was given the chance to break Anderson’s heart and hit a crucial checkout, he took it.\n\nThat is Taylor all over. He demoralises his opponents and makes even world-class talents like Anderson look ordinary.\n\nHe was on target to break the world record average for a major final before struggling on his doubles in the final leg, but his end average of 109.04 is almost untouchable. To beat him, someone would have had to have played the match of their life.\n\nThis victory would have been very sweet for Taylor after he was written off earlier in the year.\n\nAfter defeats to Mark Webster in the World Championship quarter-final, Adrian Lewis in the Premier League semi-final and Paul Nicholson in the UK Open, many declared Taylor was finished and would start slipping down the rankings. More fool them.\n\nHe has hit back by winning the World Matchplay, European Championship, World Grand Prix, Championship League Darts and now the Grand Slam, while he will start as the odds-on favourite at next month’s World Championship.\n\nAt 51, he should now be on the decline but he is showing no signs of that and if anything he is getting even better.\n\nThe competition has certainly improved but so has Taylor and there is no end in sight for his dominance.\n\nThe Grand Slam was not all about Taylor, though.\n\nAfter struggling since winning the Premier League in May, Anderson will be delighted to have reached the final in Wolverhampton and should now have the confidence to launch a real challenge for the World Championships at Alexandra Palace, where he finished runner-up last year.\n\nHis 180 scoring alone is enough to worry any player – even Taylor – and if he can get more consistency on his doubles, there’s no reason he can’t challenge Taylor if he is slightly off his best.\n\nThe Grand Slam in general is proving more popular every year and that is in large part down to the BDO players who compete.\n\nThis is the only major tournament the PDC and BDO players can compete against each other, and is therefore unique because of that.\n\nLast year, Scott Waites of the BDO won the tournament and this year the likes of Dean Winstanley, Ted Hankey and Martin Phillips all impressed.\n\nIt is great to see all the world’s best players – excluding Martin Adams – competing in the same tournament but the fact the last remaining four players were from the PDC shows that is the corporation still very much in the ascendancy.\n\nHankey provided much of the highlights of the tournament, with his antics on stage making him the ideal PDC player.\n\nIt would be great to see him move across and test himself against the best week in, week out, and hopefully that is a move which will take place in the near future.\n\nThe fans at Wolverhampton have always given him a tough time but, to the amazement of all, warmed to him this year.\n\nThey recognise he is box office and exactly the type of character the game needs, although it did seem a tad strange when they were singing his name and booing his opponent rather than the other way round.\n\nHis match against Michael van Gerwen in the second round was fantastic.\n\nHankey tried every trick in the book to put the 22-year-old starlet off his game but it seemed as though the Dutchman was going to win at 7-5 up.\n\nHankey tried slowing him down and even almost fell over in the early exchanges, but van Gerwen seemed unperturbed until the final few legs.\n\nTwo-time BDO champion Hankey came back to win a nail-biter 10-9 to a raucous atmosphere which surely must have whetted his appetite for a permanent PDC switch.\n\nAs for van Gerwen, this was a very positive tournament for him after superb group stage wins against Scott Waites and Tony O’Shea, and it appears he is finally beginning to live up to his huge potential.\n\nHankey eventually lost a superb quarter-final against Mark Walsh 16-14 after almost launching an incredible comeback.\n\nHe was 15-9 down in a race to 16 match, and missed three darts at a double to force a dramatic final leg decider.\n\nIt was good to see Walsh in the semi-finals though as his talent deserves more performances like this in major tournaments, and he was unlucky to eventually lose out to Anderson.\n\nPaul Nicholson again had a good tournament although he will have been disappointed by his 16-7 quarter-final loss to arch-rival Taylor.\n\nHe eased through the group stage before edging past Steve Beaton, but was no match for Taylor in this form.\n\nNicholson is improving with every tournament he plays though and if he continues in this vein of form he may well live up to his own billing as a future world champion.\n\nHis image as the ‘bad boy of darts’ is slowly turning around as he is largely letting his darts do the talking after some trash talk against Taylor earlier in the year.\n\nHe infamously said he was sick of Taylor “spitting his dummy out” and vowed to “put him to bed”, and while he has calmed down slightly he remains box office and one of the players fans always want to see in action.\n\nWorld champion Adrian Lewis has slightly stuttered since his stunning World Championship triumph last year but he was back to his best in Wolverhampton.\n\nHe was no match for Taylor, who beat him 16-9 in the semi-final, but produced some fantastic performances throughout the tournament to make him a major contender for the World Championship.\n\nFinally, it was great to see some of darts’ younger players competing on the big stage.\n\n19-year-old James Hubbard – who looks more like a boy band member than a darts player – impressed in his three group stage games and looks like a star of the future.\n\nvan Gerwen and Aaron Monk also did themselves no harm and it appears these three will be fighting it out with Taylor, Lewis, Anderson et al in the near future.\n\nFor now though, the man they all must try to catch is Taylor.\n\nHe will be more determined than ever to pick up an incredible 16th world title next month, and on this form, it is hard to see anyone stopping him.\n\nTaylor is simply a phenomenon and judging by his displays in Wolverhampton, he is nowhere near finished yet."
