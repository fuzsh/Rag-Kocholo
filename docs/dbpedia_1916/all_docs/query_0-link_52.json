        "text": "Leighton Bennett is aiming to become the youngest winner of the BDO World Youth Championship at Lakeside.\n\nThe 13-year-old from Lincoln takes on Scotland’s Nathan Girvan in the final of the annual tournament, which is being held at the famous Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey, on Thursday at 1pm.\n\nBennett rose to fame in the darting world last summer after winning the Cambridgeshire Open, a senior event which boasted a first prize of £1,000.\n\nThe teen beat professional Ricky Evans in the semi finals, before getting past Rhys Hayden in the final, to scoop the top prize and said: “I don’t really know if anyone my age has won a big Open or won that amount of money.\n\n“I didn’t really know what to do after I’d won. I get on so well with Ricky. He’s one of the nicest players I’ve ever met.\n\n“When I beat him, I fell to my knees because I was so shocked.”\n\nThe BDO World Youth Championship, which was first held in 2015, features the best young talents from around the world, with this year’s competition featuring players from no fewer than 19 different countries.\n\nThe tournament was played down from the last 128 to the final back in October, with Bennett cruising through the field to book his place in the showpiece final at Lakeside.\n\nAfter receiving a bye through the first round, Bennett recorded wins over Austria’s Anna Bosch and then the Dutch quartet of Pim Van Bijnen, Lars Plaisier, Lerena Rietbergen and Levy Frauenfelder.\n\nGirvan, who was a runner-up to two-time winner Justin van Tergouw, of the Netherlands, back in 2017, came through six rounds to clinch his spot in the final again.\n\nThe Scot defeated Matthew Fitzpatrick (Republic of Ireland), Travis Baur (Northern Ireland), Donovan Pilon (Canada), Kevin Lasker (Netherlands), Jurjen Van Der Velde (Netherlands) and Connor Arberry (England).\n\nThe final will be played over the best of five sets, with each set the best of five legs."
