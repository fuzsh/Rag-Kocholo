        "text": "The teenage star faces Luke Humphries in the final at Alexandra Palace tonight\n\nMatt Verri3 January 2024\n\nAll eyes turn to Alexandra Palace once again tonight as Luke Littler looks to pull of a truly remarkable victory in the World Darts Championship final.\n\nThe 16-year-old has been the star of the tournament from the moment he won his opening match before Christmas, beating Christian Kist with the highest three-dart average of a World Championship debutant.\n\nFive more victories have followed since then, the latest a sensational performance on Wednesday night as Littler cruised past 2018 champion Rob Cross to move just one win away from lifting the Sid Waddell trophy.\n\nLittler, who watched Tottenham beat Bournemouth on Sunday alongside midfielder James Maddison, will have the support of the majority of those inside Ally Pally tonight, as he looks to become the youngest ever winner of the tournament.\n\nWhatever the outcome, it has been an incredible few weeks for Littler, who has brought record-breaking viewing figures to the sport.\n\nLuke Littler has stormed to the World Darts Championship final\n\nPA\n\nWho is Luke Littler?\n\nLittler was born in Runcorn, Cheshire, and was first introduced to the world of darts when he was just 18-months-old, throwing at a magnetic board. By the age of four he was using a proper board and his first 180 followed just a couple of years later.\n\nTwo years ago, Littler hit a nine-darter during the Junior Darts Corporation Masters Tournament and the teenager grew up regularly playing in leagues above his age group.\n\nWhile his arrival on the world stage has been a dramatic one, Littler's talent has been no secret in the world of darts.\n\nHe earned a PDC Tour Card for 2024-25, and qualification into the World Championship, with his performances on the Winmau Development Tour, winning five titles.\n\nRead More\n\nChelsea vs Inter Milan LIVE!

Two in, one out at Man Utd; Osimhen request; Arsenal, Chelsea latest\n\nNHS tells staff to ask men if they're pregnant before X-rays as part of 'inclusivity' drive\n\nCelebrate Art of London’s collaborations with women artists\n\nLittler arrived at Alexandra Palace full of confidence, having won the World Youth Championship in November, and he has continued to break records in recent weeks, watched on by his family and girlfriend Eloise Milburn, with the 21-year-old a darts player herself in Surrey.\n\nLittler was the youngest player ever to reach the third round of the World Championship and has not slowed down since. Michael van Gerwen, at 24, is the youngest player to lift the Sid Waddell Trophy - that record is there to be smashed.\n\nHow much has Luke Littler earned?\n\nThe teenager, who turns 17 later this month, is already guaranteed £200,000 in prize money after reaching the final.\n\nAsked about his plans for the money, Littler said: “I always treat myself to some Under Armour tracksuits.\n\n“And just get myself a new coat and get myself some FIFA points for my Xbox. That’s pretty much it.”\n\nShould he win tonight, he will take home £500,000.\n\nWhat is Luke Littler's ranking?\n\nLittler began the World Championship ranked 164th, but will move up to ninth should he complete the job tonight.\n\nAn unseeded player has never won the tournament, with Kirk Shepherd in 2008 the only one to have ever reached the final.\n\nLittler has already matched that - should he go one better it will complete the biggest shock in the sport's history.\n\nLuke Littler will move inside the top ten of the rankings if he beats Luke Humphries\n\nGetty Images\n\nWho is Luke Littler playing in the final?\n\nWhile Littler has been hugely impressive in his six wins so far, he faces his toughest test to date in the final.\n\nHe goes up against pre-tournament favourite Luke Humphries, who stormed to a 6-0 win over Scott Williams in the last four.\n\nHumphries had never previously made it beyond the quarter-finals of the World Championship, but was in supreme form heading into the tournament and in the last couple of rounds has found that level again.\n\nWhat next for Luke Littler?\n\nLittler has vaulted himself to the top of the sport and there have been suggestions that he could be invited to the Premier League, an eight-player tournament that runs throughout the year. However, Littler has downplayed those.\n\n\"I've seen what the Premier League does [for your profile],\" he said.\n\n\"You have Monday, Tuesday pro tours, and then Wednesday is the Euro qualifiers and you've got the Premier League. The weekend is the Euro Tour.\n\n\"I think the PDC are going to keep me out of it, because that will just be gruelling like everyone has said.\"\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
