        "text": "Born in 1985 and hailing from Liverpool, Stephen Bunting is a professional darts player and former Lakeside World Champion.\n\nAs a teenager, Bunting won the British Teenage Open and World Youth Masters titles before making his World Championship debut in the BDO aged just 18 years old.\n\nIn 2012, the man known as “The Bullet” lifted his first major honour in the sport when he won the World Masters before successfully retaining it a year later.\n\nHowever, Bunting’s greatest achievement in darts came on the 12th January 2014 when he fulfilled a lifetime dream and became the BDO World Champion.\n\nThat success propelled him to global recognition and shortly after that victory accepted an invitation to join the Professional Darts Corporation.\n\nSince the switch from the BDO, Bunting has reached five major television semi finals, won two pro tour events, competed in the prestigious Premier League and was crowned Masters Champion 2024.\n\nIn a glittering career spanning over two decades to date, Bunting has amassed over thirty regional and national titles in addition to his multiple professional tournament wins.\n\nCurrently ranked at number 15 in the PDC Order of Merit, Bunting now resides in St Helens with his partner Keila and son Tobias."
