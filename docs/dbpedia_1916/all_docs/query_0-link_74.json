        "text": "1. The Original Kyle Anderson – The first and only Aboriginal Professional Darts Player, riding the crest of a new sporting sensation...\n\n2. Professional Darts is the second most watched sport in the UK, behind football* and is becoming increasingly popular in Australia with three major tournaments taking place in Perth, Sydney & Auckland (NZ) – over 600,000 Aussies tuned in to watch the World final involving Simon Whitlock\n\n3. Kyle Anderson has burst on to the PDC Darts scene and has already become one of the most popular players on the circuit, climbing 100 places since starting his career only 18 months ago\n\n4. The Original is already known to many Japanese Darts fans as he took the Japan Open title in 2010, beating Hong Kong favourite, Royden Lam in the final Roll of Honour – Kyle Anderson • Canberra DPA Event Winner • Coolbellup Open Winner 2010 • DPA Australian Matchplay Winner 2013 • WA Open Winner 2011 • Japan Open Winner • Mittagong RSL Open Winner 2013 • Nerang Open Winner 2013 • Oceanic Masters Winner 2012 • Sydney Masters Qualifier Winner 2014 • Victoria Open Winner 2013 • Warilla Bowls Club Open Winner 2013 • Career 9 Darters : 4 • World Championship appearances: 3\n\n5. The Original became only the 7th player in history to hit a perfect 9 dart finish at the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship – even 16 time World Champion Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor is yet to achieve this feat!\n\n6. WORLD RECORD BREAKER!!! Kyle set a WORLD RECORD for a Professional Darts match average just a few weeks ago when he beat top professional Terry Jenkins 6-1 in just 77 darts, averaging an unprecedented 134.8 !\n\n7. Camera-facing branding in live TV Darts is proven to be extremely successful, which is why E-cigarettes company Truvape & the biggest name in Darts, Unicorn, have their badges on The Original – like Kyle Anderson’s progress in Darts, Unicorn &Truvape’s sales have rocketed!\n\n8. With Kyle Anderson already qualified for this year’s World Championship and on the verge of every TV major tournament he is likely to climb in to the World’s top 16 and possibly the elite Premier League in 2016/2017 and we have 2 advertising spaces on The Original’s shirt (one chest – in place of Protege Events) and one on the sleeve\n\n9. Through PDC Darts, male-orientated brands hit the same target audience as football but at a fraction of the cost – just last week, Kyle performed an exhibition at Sandown Park, Melbourne, home of the richest greyhound race in the world; in two weeks time he’ll be in Doncaster at The Urban Bar – we cover significant ground with exhibitions and our ‘pub to professional’ competitions – another great opportunity to showcase brands as part of our shows/competitions\n\n10. Team Protege also manage a plethora of other Darts stars and also facilitate the only ‘pub to professional’ competition in the world with our final taking place at The Alexandra Palace during the PDC World Darts Championship\n\n11. Our Darts Factor and PDC Darts Protege competitions take place in hundreds of venues around the UK / worldwide, providing opportunities for underprivileged people to play a sport they love and potentially become professional and play on the greatest stage of all...\n\n12. We produced the Sky TV series The Darts Factor earlier this year and viewing figures were fantastic, so good, in fact, that the series returns to screens in December in the UK and we are in talks with SBS to take the concept to Australia, possibly on National Indigenous TV, with an angle of Kyle Anderson searching for his Darting Protege. We are seeking partners for both the English series and our Australian debut.\n\n13. The Darts Factor enabled us to discover four of the best young players in Darts. Ted Evetts (age 18, middle below) won the youth league averages for the whole of last year; Jordan Matthews (20, left) was second placed... Taylor Greaves (18, right) won 14 Protege Events in a row (Taylor is the elder brother of Beau – extremely talented siblings – wonderfully marketable) •\n\n14. Not forgetting the youngest player ever to play in a World Championship final, aged just 21, Karate Kid Kirk Shepherd\n\n15. The last of our players – the legends of Darts, former World Champions, John Lowe, Bob Anderson and John ‘Boy’ Walton"
