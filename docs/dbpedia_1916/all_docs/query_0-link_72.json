        "text": "FALLON Sherrock made history when she became the first woman to beat a man in the PDC World Darts Championships.\n\nShe beat Ted Evetts 3-2 at Alexandra Palace in December 2019, going on to reach the third round of the tournament — here we take a look at her career, partner and net worth.\n\nWho is Fallon Sherrock?\n\nFallon Sherrock was born on July 1, 1994 in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nShe started on the road to success at the Girls World Masters in 2012, adding further glories at the women's Jersey Open and women's British Classic.\n\nSherrock competed at every BDO World Championships in the female category from 2014 to 2019 — reaching the final in 2015, ultimately losing to fellow Englishwoman Lisa Ashton.\n\nShe picked up the BDO World Darts Trophy in 2018, along with two further titles on the women's tour in 2019.\n\nIn 2019 Fallon became the first woman to beat a man at the BDO World Darts Championship, defeating Ted Evetts 3-2, going on to beat 11th seed Mensur Suljović in the second round — before losing to 22nd seed Chris Dobey in round three.\n\nSince then she has become a real threat on the men's circuit, reaching the final of the Nordic Darts Masters in September 2021.\n\nFallon made history yet again in August 2023 when she became the first woman to make a televised nine-dart finish against Adam Lipscombe in the Modus Super Series.\n\nAnd she is not the only Sherrock on the darts scene, with twin sister Felicia having competed alongside her at the WDF Europe Cup Youth in 2011.\n\nAway from darts, Sherrock has a son, Rory, who was born in April 2014.\n\nWho is Fallon Sherrock's partner Cameron Menzies?\n\nSherrock is in a relationship with Cameron Menzies.\n\nHe is a 34-year-old darts player, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland.\n\nMenzies also works a plumber and fits his day-job around competing in top-level darts tournaments.\n\nCameron said he's lucky to have a partner he can practice darts with at home... that is until he gets beat.\n\nMenzies told Sky Sports: \"We enjoy our practice together and she is a very class player.\n\n\"She has done well for darts in general and is banging in 90 averages and 100 averages, the same as a lot of women.\n\n\"I'm quite lucky I've got a very good partner who can play darts.\n\n\"It's good in the house unless she beats me and I've got to make the food. I don't like it when she beats me.\n\n\"I will support her left, right and centre. I am her biggest fan.\n\n\"I might be a bit strict, but I know how good she is. I've known her for a very long time and I know she is very, very good.\n\n\"She's taken me places I would never have experienced because of darts, so I'm a very lucky person.\n\n\"I'm her biggest fan and I wish her all the best.\"\n\nDid she have a health scare?\n\nJust months after giving birth to her son Rory, Sherrock developed a serious kidney problem that almost led to organ failure.\n\nSpeaking to SunSport's Rob Maul, she said: \"About six months after I had my little boy in April 2014, I ended up getting a kidney disease.\n\n\"I started to feel unwell. I didn’t know what was going on until I was diagnosed.\n\n\"It was a worrying time. I started taking medication to weaken my immune system because that is what was attacking my kidneys.\n\n\"The problem was when I went on different medication, I suffered side effects.\n\n\"And the side effects caused ‘moon face’, where my face swelled up. It was a reaction.\n\n\"When I played in the BDO worlds on TV, I received a lot of criticism for how I looked.\n\n\"If I saw negative comments I tried to look past them. I’m not going to dwell on what someone has said if it doesn’t affect my life.\n\n\"I think that attitude helps to strengthen my character.\"\n\nWill she play at the PDC World Darts Championship this year?\n\nYeas, Fallon will be competing in the 2023 PDC World Championship, much to the delight of her army of fans.\n\nAnd she is not the only female competitor in the field this year.\n\nShe will be joined by Japan's Mikuru Suzuki, who won this year's Winmau World Youth Championship aged just 16.\n\nWhat is Fallon Sherrock's net worth?\n\nFallon's net worth varies depending on which outlet is reporting it, but not too dramatically.\n\nHer fortune is estimated to be between £1million and £4million.\n\nAs she is only 29 years old, she still has the opportunity to build on her already-impressive career earnings."
