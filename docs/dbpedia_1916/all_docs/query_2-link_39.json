The information contained on the British Darts events, unfortunately, isn’t as complete as I would like it to be. If you are able to provide information that may fill in some gaps then please email it to me for inclusion on this page.\n\nThe Information below is correct to my knowledge at the time of publishing, however, use at your own risk. If you need a more in-depth information please contact the major governing bodies who may be able to help your enquiry better than I am able to.\n\nThe Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) was initially formed and was known as the World Darts Council (WDC). January 1992, after 16 BDO top professional players, along with managers Dick Allix, Tommy Cox and John Markovic, decided to break away from the British Darts Organisation in order to gain better sponsorship and TV coverage of their chosen sport, darts! The PDC now boasts an annual prize fund of Â£10M (2018) a figure that is constantly growing.\n\nIn 2001, the board of directors decided to step down in favour of a specialist promotional team, headed by boxing and snooker promoter, Barry Hearn, who became the chairman of the PDC.\n\nThe new team have taken darts to a new height with major TV contracts and sponsorship. The fan base for the sport has also vastly increased with venues selling out as quickly as the tickets go on sale.\n\nIn June 2018 the German Masters had over 20,000 dart fans attending. The sport has also travelled widely across the Globe with the help of the PDC where fans can see first hand the skill of the Professional PDC dart players.\n\nBelow is a list of winners, champions of the PDC staged events. Over the years the format of some of these events has changed but the prestige hasnât.\n\nQuick Table Links\n\nWorld Champions | World Champions Youth | Premier League | World Matchplay | World Grand Prix | UK Open | European Championship | Grand Slam of Darts | Players Championship Finals | World Cup of Darts | The Masters | Champions League of Darts | World Series of Darts | Home Tour\n\nPDC World Darts Champions\n\nProfessional Darts Corporation World Darts Champions\n\nPDC World Championships Main Sponsors:\n\n1994 - 1995 Skol International, 1995 - 1996 Proton Cars, 1996 - 1997 VerNons, 1998 - 2002 Skol International, 2003 - 2014 Ladbrokes, William Hill 2015 - 2022, Cazoo 2023, Paddy Power 2024 - Current\n\nThe highest average achieved in the televised stages of the PDC World Championship Finals is 114.05 set by Michael van Gerwen in the 2017 semi-finals. Michael beat Raymond van Barneveld who also set the highest losing average at the championships, 109.34\n\nPhil Taylor recorded a three dart average of 110.94 in the 2009 final. The highest ever for any major darts championship final.\n\nThe 2017 final also broke the most 180’s hit in any darts match, a total of 42. Michael van Gerwen hit 20, 180's while Gary Anderson hit 22, 180's\n\nAdrian Lewis hit a nine dart leg in the opening set of the Ladbrokes.com PDC World Darts Final in 2011. The first ever dart player to achieve this feat in a World Darts Final\n\nFor more information on PDC events please visit the PDC website\n\nYear Winner Sets Sets Runner-up 2024 Luke Humphries 7 - 4 Luke Littler 2023 Michael Smith 7 - 4 Michael van Gerwen 2022 Peter Wright 7 - 5 Michael Smith 2021 Gerwyn Price 7 - 3 Gary Anderson 2020 Peter Wright 7 - 3 Michael van Gerwen 2019 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 3 Michael Smith 2018 Rob Cross 7 - 2 Phil Taylor 2017 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 3 Gary Anderson 2016 Gary Anderson 7 - 5 Adrian Lewis 2015 Gary Anderson 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2014 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 5 Peter Wright 2013 Phil Taylor 7 - 4 Michael van Gerwen 2012 Adrian Lewis 7 - 3 Andy Hamilton 2011 Adrian Lewis 7 - 5 Gary Anderson 2010 Phil Taylor 7 - 3 Simon Whitlock 2009 Phil Taylor 7 - 1 Raymond van Barneveld 2008 John Part 7 - 2 Kirk Shepherd 2007 Raymond Van Barneveld 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2006 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 Peter Manley 2005 Phil Taylor 7 - 4 Mark Dudbridge 2004 Phil Taylor 7 - 6 Kevin Painter 2003 John Part 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2002 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 Peter Manley 2001 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 John Part 2000 Phil Taylor 7 - 3 Dennis Priestley 1999 Phil Taylor 6 - 2 Peter Manley 1998 Phil Taylor 6 - 0 Dennis Priestley 1997 Phil Taylor 6 - 3 Dennis Priestley 1996 Phil Taylor 6 - 4 Dennis Priestley 1995 Phil Taylor 6 - 2 Rod Harrington 1994 Dennis Priestley 6 - 1 Phil Taylor\n\nPDC Youth World Champions\n\nAlthough the BDO has been the bedrock for youth darts for many years, it was the PDC who first introduced a World Darts Championship. Until this point, the biggest accolade a youth player could hold was the Winmau Masters title. The masters introduced a joint boys and girls (Youth) Championship in 1986. In 1999 this was split into two separate titles one for boys the other girls.\n\nBDO classify a youth player of 18 years or younger, however, the PDC have revised their youth tournament age minimum 16 years â 23 years. Personally, 23 seems a little old for a youth player especially when Jelle Klassen won the BDO World Championship at the age of 21 and Michael van Gerwen won the Winmau Masters at 17 years old.\n\nYear Winner Sets Sets Runner-up 2023 Luke Littler 6 - 4 Gian van Veen 2022 Josh Rock 6 - 1 Nathan Girvan 2021 Ted Evetts 6 - 4 Nathan Rafferty 2020 Bradley Brookes 6 - 5 Joe Davis 2019 Luke Humphries 6 - 0 Adam Gawlas 2018 Dimitri van den Bergh 6 - 3 Martin Schindler 2017 Dimitri van den Bergh 6 - 3 Josh Payne 2016 Corey Cadby 6 - 2 Berry van Peer 2015 Max Hopp 6 - 5 Nathan Aspinall 2014 Keegan Brown 6 - 4 Rowby-John Rodriguez 2013 Michael Smith 6 - 1 Ricky Evans 2012 James Hubbard 6 - 3 Michael van Gerwen 2011 Arron Monk 6 - 4 Michael van Gerwen\n\nPDC Premier League\n\nThe Premier League started in 2005 and plays in front of sell-out crowds in arena venues across the UK & Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nYear Winner Score Score Runner-up 2024 Luke Littler\n\n11\n\n-\n\n7\n\nLuke Humphries 2023 Michael van Gerwen\n\n11\n\n-\n\n5\n\nGerwen Price 2022 Michael van Gerwen\n\n11\n\n-\n\n10\n\nJoe Cullen 2021 Jonny Clayton\n\n11\n\n-\n\n5\n\nJose de Sousa 2020 Glen Durrant\n\n11\n\n-\n\n8\n\nNathan Aspinall 2019 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 5 Rob Cross 2018 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 4 Michael Smith 2017 Michael van Gerwen\n\n11\n\n-\n\n10\n\nPeter Wright 2016 Michael van Gerwen\n\n11\n\n-\n\n3\n\nPhil Taylor 2015 Gary Anderson\n\n11\n\n-\n\n7\n\nMichael van Gerwen 2014 Raymond van Barneveld\n\n10\n\n-\n\n6\n\nMichael van Gerwen 2013 Michael van Gerwen\n\n10\n\n-\n\n8\n\nPhil Taylor 2012 Phil Taylor\n\n10\n\n-\n\n7\n\nSimon Whitlock 2011 Gary Anderson\n\n10\n\n-\n\n4\n\nAdrian Lewis 2010 Phil Taylor\n\n10\n\n-\n\n8\n\nJames Wade 2009 James Wade\n\n13\n\n-\n\n8\n\nMervyn King 2008 Phil Taylor\n\n16\n\n-\n\n8\n\nJames Wade 2007 Phil Taylor\n\n16\n\n-\n\n6\n\nTerry Jenkins 2006 Phil Taylor\n\n16\n\n-\n\n6\n\nRoland Scholten 2005 Phil Taylor\n\n16\n\n-\n\n4\n\nColin Lloyd\n\nThe Premier League final best of legs has changed over the years:\n\n2005 - 2008 best of 31 legs\n\n2009 - best of 25 legs\n\n2010 - 2014 best of 19 legs\n\n2015 - 2021 best of 21 legs\n\nFormat Changes to the Premier League take place in 2022\n\nPDC World Matchplay\n\nThe World Matchplay started in 1994 and is a firm favourite of the players and the dart fans. It is played over the summer period and currently staged at the Winter Gardens Blackpool. The Winter Gardens iconic surroundings along with a close crowd atmosphere make this one of the top events of the season.\n\nThis is one of the titles all dart players want to win alongside the World Championships. Played in leg format, not sets, can make for some run away winners. However, there have been many last leg deciders in this tournament.\n\nYear\n\nWinner Score Score Runner-Up\n\n2024\n\nLuke Humphries 18 - 15 Michael van Gerwen\n\n2023\n\nNathan Aspinall 18 - 6 Jonny Clayton\n\n2022\n\nMichael van Gerwen 18 - 14 Gerwyn Price\n\n2021\n\nPeter Wright 18 - 9 Dimitri van den Bergh\n\n2020\n\nDimitri van den Bergh 18 - 10 Gary Anderson\n\n2019\n\nRob Cross 18 - 13 Michael Smith\n\n2018\n\nGary Anderson 21 - 19 Mensur Suljović\n\n2017\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 8 Peter Wright\n\n2016\n\nMichael van Gerwen 18 - 10 Phil Taylor\n\n2015\n\nMichael van Gerwen 18 - 12 James Wade\n\n2014\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 9 Michael van Gerwen\n\n2013\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 13 Adrian Lewis\n\n2012\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 15 James Wade\n\n2011\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 8 James Wade\n\n2010\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 12 Raymond van Barneveld\n\n2009\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 4 Terry Jenkins\n\n2008\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 9 James Wade\n\n2007\n\nJames Wade 18 - 7 Terry Jenkins\n\n2006\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 11 James Wade\n\n2005\n\nColin Lloyd 18 - 12 John Part\n\n2004\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 8 Mark Dudbridge\n\n2003\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 12 Wayne Mardle\n\n2002\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 16 John Part\n\n2001\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 10 Richie Burnett\n\n2000\n\nPhil Taylor 18 - 12 Alan Warriner\n\n1999\n\nRod Harrington 19 - 17 Peter Manley\n\n1998\n\nRod Harrington 18 - 17 Ronnie Baxter\n\n1997\n\nPhil Taylor 16 - 11 Alan Warriner\n\n1996\n\nPeter Evison 16 - 14 Dennis Priestley\n\n1995\n\nPhil Taylor 16 - 11 Dennis Priestley\n\n1994\n\nLarry Butler 16 - 12 Dennis Priestley\n\nPDC World Matchplay Womens Event\n\nYear\n\nWinner Score Score Runner-Up\n\n2024\n\nBeau Greaves 6 - 3 Fallon Sherrock\n\n2023\n\nBeau Greaves 6 - 1 Mikuru Suzuki\n\n2022\n\nFallon Sherrock 6 - 3 Aileen de Graaf\n\nPDC World Grand Prix\n\nThe World Grand Prix is unique in its format. The event is a double start double finish and many an upset is caused during this week-long tournament. Failure to start a leg with the first three darts can mean game over. However, even with this tough start, 9 dart finishes have been seen usually with a 160 start, 180, 161 finish. Although 9 darters are possible, many dart players opt for the doubles they normally finish legs, mainly double 16 at this point they immediately opt out trying to hit a perfect leg.\n\nI wonder if we will ever see a Bull, T20, T19 start followed by a T20, T19, Bull and the same again to finish the match? A perfect 9 darter, no other dart hitting another?\n\nYear Winner\n\nScore\n\nScore Runner-Up 2023 Luke Humphries\n\n5\n\n-\n\n2\n\nGerwyn Price 2022 Michael van Gerwen\n\n5\n\n-\n\n3\n\nNathan Aspinall 2021 Jonny Clayton\n\n5\n\n-\n\n1\n\nGerwyn Price 2020 Gerwyn Price\n\n5\n\n-\n\n2\n\nDirk van Duijvenbode 2019 Michael van Gerwen\n\n5\n\n-\n\n2\n\nDave Chisnall 2018 Michael van Gerwen\n\n5\n\n-\n\n2\n\nPeter Wright 2017 Darryl Gurney\n\n5\n\n-\n\n4\n\nSimon Whitlock 2016 Michael van Gerwen\n\n5\n\n-\n\n2\n\nGary Anderson 2015 Robert Thornton\n\n5\n\n-\n\n4\n\nMichael van Gerwen 2014 Michael van Gerwen\n\n5\n\n-\n\n3\n\nJames Wade 2013 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n0\n\nDave Chisnall 2012 Michael van Gerwen\n\n6\n\n-\n\n4\n\nMervyn King 2011 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n3\n\nBrendan Dolan 2010 James Wade\n\n6\n\n-\n\n3\n\nAdrian Lewis 2009 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n3\n\nRaymond van Barneveld 2008 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n2\n\nRaymond van Barneveld 2007 James Wade\n\n6\n\n-\n\n3\n\nTerry Jenkins 2006 Phil Taylor\n\n7\n\n-\n\n4\n\nTerry Jenkins 2005 Phil Taylor\n\n7\n\n-\n\n1\n\nColin Lloyd 2004 Colin Lloyd\n\n7\n\n-\n\n3\n\nAlan Warriner 2003 Phil Taylor\n\n7\n\n-\n\n2\n\nJohn Part 2002 Phil Taylor\n\n7\n\n-\n\n3\n\nJohn Part 2001 Alan Warriner\n\n6\n\n-\n\n2\n\nRoland Scholten 2000 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n1\n\nShayne Burgess 1999 Phil Taylor\n\n6\n\n-\n\n1\n\nShayne Burgess 1998 Phil Taylor\n\n13\n\n-\n\n8\n\nRod Harrington\n\nPDC UK Open\n\nThe UK Open is known as the FA Cup of darts! As the name implies the tournament is open to all comers. I personally played in one of the first winning locally but due to other commitments could not attend the knockout stage to go through to the finals!\n\nThis event gives the unknown player a chance of playing some of the biggest names in darts and although there are seeds that come into the event at the later stages, the draw from then on is blind. After each round, the player's names or numbered balls to be precise, are put into a bag and the drawn live meaning seeds can easily be knocked out and the unknown local hero can proceed further in the tournament.\n\nThis is a great event, well attended as per any PDC tournament and above all fun to watch the drama unfold.\n\nYear Winner Score Score Runner-up 2024 Dimitri van den Bergh 11 - 10 Luke Humphries 2023 Andrew Gilding 11 - 10 Micael van Gerwen 2022 Danny Noppert 11 - 10 Michael Smith 2021 James Wade 11 - 5 Luke Humphries 2020 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 9 Gerwyn Price 2019 Nathan Aspinall 11 - 5 Rob Cross 2018 Gary Anderson 11 - 7 Corey Cadby 2017 Peter Wright 11 - 6 Gerwyn Price 2016 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 4 Peter Wright 2015 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 5 Peter Wright 2014 Adrian Lewis 11 - 1 Terry JenkinsÂ 2013 Phil Taylor 11 - 4 Andy Hamilton 2012 Robert Thornton 11 - 5 Phil Taylor 2011 James Wade 11 - 8 Wes Newton 2010 Phil Taylor 11 - 5 Gary Anderson 2009 Phil Taylor 11 - 6 Colin Osborne 2008 James Wade 11 - 7 Gary Mawson 2007 Raymond van Barneveld 16 - 8 Vincent van der Voort 2006 Raymond van Barneveld 13 - 7 Barrie Bates 2005 Phil Taylor 13 - 7 Mark Walsh 2004 Roland Scholten 11 - 6 John Part 2003 Phil Taylor 18 - 8 Shayne Burgess\n\nPDC European Championships\n\nThe European Championships consists of 32-players that have qualified through the European Tour Order of Merit, which includes prize money won in the 13 European Tour events throughout the year.\n\nYear WinnerÂ Score Score Runner-up 2023 Peter Wright 11 - 6 James Wade 2022 Ross Smith 11 - 8 Michael Smith 2021 Rob Cross 11 - 8 Michael van Gerwen 2020 Peter Wright 11 - 4 James Wade 2019 Rob Cross 11 - 6 Gerwyn Price 2018 James Wade 11 - 8 Simon Whitlock 2017 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 7 Rob Cross 2016 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 1 Mensur SuljoviÄ 2015 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 10 Gary Anderson 2014 Michael van Gerwen 11 - 4 Terry Jenkins 2013 Adrian Lewis 11 - 6 Simon Whitlock 2012 Simon Whitlock 11 - 5 Wes Newton 2011 Phil Taylor 11 - 8 Adrian Lewis 2010 Phil Taylor 11 - 1 Wayne Jones 2009 Phil Taylor 11 - 3 Steve Beaton 2008 Phil Taylor 11 - 5 Adrian Lewis\n\nPDC Grand Slam of Darts\n\nThe Grand Slam of Darts first started in 2007 and is a cross-organisation tournament. It features top players from the PDC and the BDO. The initial rounds consist of players of both organisations competing in a round-robin group phase, with the top two progressing into a straight knockout to decide the eventual winner. In 2021, after the demise of the BDO, the PDC introduced a mini women's Series qualifying event. The event allowed two women to play in the Grand Slam, plus the top also qualified for the PDC World Championships. The top eight players from the Women's Series Order of Merit were also given free entry into the PDC Q-School Qualifiers for 2022. In previous years, the BDO Women's World Champion would have featured in the Grand Slam and no free entry Q-School.\n\nFallon Sherrock and Lisa Aston qualified for the event in 2021. Fallon excelled in the round-robin phase with over 100 average in one match (the first televised for a woman) and qualified for the knockout stage, again a first for women. She again beat Mensur SuljoviÄ in the first round of the knockout stage, who she previously beat in the 2019 PDC World Championships. Fallon but lost the eventual finalist Peter Wright.\n\nBelow are a list of winners and runners-up of this event and you can also see the organisation they were playing under at the time of the event.\n\nFollowing the BDO’s liquidation in 2020, the qualification format has changed and is now solely based on PDC-managed events.\n\nYear Winner Org Score Score Runner-up Org 2023 Luke Humphries - 16 - 8 Robb Cross - 2022 Michael Smith - 16 - 5 Nathan Aspinall - 2021 Gerwyn Price - 16 - 8 Peter Wright - 2020 Jose de Sousa PDC 16 - 12 James Wade PDC 2019 Gerwyn Price PDC 16 - 6 Peter Wright PDC 2018 Gerwyn Price PDC 16 - 13 Gary Anderson PDC 2017 Michael van Gerwen PDC 16 - 12 Peter Wright PDC 2016 Michael van Gerwen PDC 16 - 8 James Wade PDC 2015 Michael van Gerwen PDC 16 - 13 Phil Taylor PDC 2014 Phil Taylor PDC 16 - 13 Dave Chisnall PDC 2013 Phil Taylor PDC 16 - 6 Robert Thornton PDC 2012 Raymond van Barneveld PDC 16 - 14 Michael van Gerwen PDC 2011 Phil Taylor PDC 16 - 4 Gary Anderson PDC 2010 Scott Waites BDO 16 - 12 James Wade PDC 2009 Phil Taylor PDC 16 - 2 Scott Waites BDO 2008 Phil Taylor PDC 18 - 9 Terry Jenkins PDC 2007 Phil Taylor PDC 18 - 11 Andy Hamilton PDC\n\nPDC Players Championship Finals\n\nThe Players Championship Finals sees the top 64 players from the 22 Players Championship events taking part.

The top 8 seeded countries are placed into eight different groups: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. They are joined by three unseeded Countries in each group and a total of four teams per group.\n\nThe first round consists of a round-robin stage where each country in the elected group play each other with the top two teams progressing to the second-round knockout stage.\n\nThe scoring is done on a point system. Each player plays singles against the opposing team; if they win, they score a point if they lose, they score nothing. After the singles, should the score be even then one round of doubles takes place to decide the winner.\n\nFrom 2019 the event changed its format to a straight knockout. The top eight seeded countries remain, however, the round robin stage is removed. The point system remains with the first round consisting of best of nine legs played in doubles. The second round, quarter and semi-final are two best of seven leg singles, if the scores are even at the end of this session a double match determines the match.\n\nThe final requires three points to win the title. Two best of seven legs singles are played followed by a best of seven doubles.
