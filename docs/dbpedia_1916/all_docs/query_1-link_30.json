        "text": "Luke Littler reaches World Darts Championship semi-finals\n\nThe biggest darts title of the year will be on the line less than 72 hours into 2024, and 16-year-old Luke Littler is in with a chance of picking up the top prize. Every match is a nail-biter at this stage of the World Darts Championship, with a spot in the history books and a healthy wedge of cash awarded to the winner.\n\nLittler's barnstorming debut has undoubtedly been the story of the tournament so far. Dropping only four sets in his first five matches, the reigning World Youth Champion has seen off senior professionals Christian Kist and Matt Campbell, seasoned big-hitters Andrew Gilding and Brendan Dolan, and an all-time legend in Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nAnd the Warrington-based prodigy then saw off former world champion Rob Cross in his semi-final on Tuesday evening. Tournament favourite Luke Humphries thrashed Scott Williams 6-0 in the other semi to reach the final and become No 1 in the world.\n\nWith darts' showpiece event at Ally Pally set to reach its crescendo, Express Sport takes you through all you need to know about the final itself...\n\nDon't miss... Wayne Mardle sends no-nonsense message to players upset with his commentary\n\nWhen is the World Darts Championship final?\n\nCoverage of the all-important final between Humphries and Littler will begin at 7.30pm (GMT) on Wednesday 3 January. Viewers can tune into the action on Sky Sports or via the NOW TV app.\n\nThe match itself is due to begin at approximately 8.15pm, with a darting marathon in store for the two competitors. The first to seven sets in a clash scheduled to last around two hours will clinch the title and a serious sum of money.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nPrize money breakdown\n\nA tempting £2.5million prize pot has been attached to this year's World Darts Championship, with the winner taking home an eye-watering £500,000. That would be a life-changing sum of money for Littler who, per the PDC Order of Merit, had banked only £2,500 in the two years prior to the tournament.\n\nSecuring the top prize would guarantee a huge jump up the world rankings for Littler, who can surge from outside the world's top 150 to inside the top 10. Humphries will stay world No 1 even if he loses.\n\nEven the runner-up in Wednesday's final will bank a tidy £200,000, with the two losing semi-finalists earning £100,000 apiece. Before losing to Littler, Cross was the only reigning champion left in this year's draw, having gone all the way in 2018.\n\nHumphries meanwhile arrived at Ally Pally in red-hot form, but he had never previously made it beyond the quarter-final stage. Williams got further than ever before before his defeat. Littler is gunning for glory on his first ever appearance at the tournament."
