        "text": "Something very, very special is unfolding in the darts world right now.\n\nTeenager Luke Littler has stormed into the quarterfinals of the PDC Darts World Championships, defeating a legend of the sport in a stunning upset.\n\nIn a raucous atmosphere in London’s Alexandra Palace, the 16-year-old demolished five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld four sets to one.\n\nStream Over 50 Sports Live & On-Demand with Kayo.

One of the best to ever play the game, he’s been walloped.\n\n“Incredible. This is out of this world by a young man who genuinely believes he can be world champion.”\n\nThree-time world champion John Part said on Sky Sports: “If you put aside the fact that he’s 16, that’s the sort of performance that can win the tournament.\n\n“A great performance. That’s the sort of darts that wins titles and he’s getting awfully close to achieving that. That’s his best performance yet.”\n\nLittler’s fairytale run has made him a cult hero in the UK and the youngster, who sports an impressive beard, was lost for words after his latest win.\n\n“Unbelievable. I don’t know what to say,” he said after the round of 16 match.\n\n“It’s unbelievable. I went 2-0 up, 3-0 up, then I just said to my family, ‘Three legs away, one set away and I’m over the line’. I’ve done it.”\n\nAsked about his embrace with van Barneveld, Littler said: “He said, ‘You can go all the way. I hope you can go all the way’. I said thank you. He’s a true gentleman and I respect Raymond very well.”\n\nThe results means Littler will also pocket 50,000 pounds (AU$93,000) in prize money.\n\nIn the quarterfinals Littler will next face Brendon Nolan, who has defeated Gerwen Price and Gary Anderson.\n\n“I do fancy myself. But let’s just focus on Brendan,” Littler said when asked if he can go all the way.\n\nThree-time world champion Michael van Gerwen is still in the mix, but defending champion Michael Smith is out of contention after he was knocked out by Chris Dobey."
