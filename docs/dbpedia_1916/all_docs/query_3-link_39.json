        "text": "Step up to the oche at the Alexander Palace over the festive season with everything you need to know – plus two players to keep an eye on in the betting – ahead of the PDC Darts World Championship:\n\nWhen is the Darts World Championship 2021/22?\n\nThe tournament runs from December 15, 2021 until January 3, 2022.\n\nWhere is the PDC Darts World Championship Staged?\n\nThe darts world championship will be held at the Alexandra Palace (fondly known by darts fans as the ‘Ally Pally’) in North London – its home since 2008.\n\nWhere can I Watch the PDC Darts World Championship 2021/22?\n\nEvery session will be broadcast live on Sky Sports – either on Sky Sports Main Event and/or on Sky Sports Darts.\n\nWhat is the Prize-money for the PDC Darts World Championship 2021/22?\n\nThe 2022 PDC World Darts Championship prize fund is £2.5million. The winner will claim a cheque for £500,000, while the runner-up will receive £200,000.\n\nWhat is the History of the PDC Darts World Championship?\n\nThe PDC championship began in 1994 under its previous guise of the WDC World Darts Championship. The inaugural edition at the Circus Tavern was won by Denis Priestly, who defeated Phil Taylor 6-1 in the final.\n\nFrom then on, Taylor dominated the darts world championships, winning the title an extraordinary 14 times in 25 appearances – thereby gaining a reputation as being the greatest player of all time.\n\nThere have been eight other winners of the PDC Darts World Championship, with John Part (2003; 2008), Adrian Lewis (2011; 2012) and Gary Anderson (2015; 1016) having twice claimed the trophy.\n\nMichael van Gerwen (2014; 2017; 2019) is a three-time winner of the PDC Darts World Championship, while Welshman Gerwyn Price landed last season’s renewal with a 7-3 defeat of Gary Anderson.\n\nYou can get better insights into darts betting by surfing online betting websites.\n\nWhat are the most popular darts betting markets?\n\nBacking the outright winner of the PDC Darts World Championship is unquestionably one of the most popular darts betting markets of the season.\n\nOutright betting on other events like the World Series, the World Grand Prix and World Masters is also fun, but nothing compares in darts to having a flutter at the Ally Pally.\n\nOutright darts betting is as obvious as it sounds. Simply choose who you think will win the tournament – either before or during the PDC Darts World Championship.\n\nIf they win, you will get paid out at the odds at which you made the bet. If you place a bet before the tournament begins, historically this will give you a greater chance of making a bigger profit.\n\nOnce the draw has been made the market has been formed, you can also enjoy each-way outright betting on the darts. This is again very simple. All that is required is to choose who you think will reach the final – but not necessarily win. This is a good betting market for punters who fancy a player to go deep into the tournament, only to fall at the final hurdle.\n\nWhen the PDC Darts World Championship gets under way, VBET offers a wide range of other exciting betting markets. You can, for instance, bet on the winner of each leg, set or match. You can either place your bets before a game (pre-match betting) or follow the action in-play and bet live.\n\nYou can also bet on the correct score of each game in the PDC Darts World Championship, while backing a player to make the most 180s each match is also a popular darts betting market.\n\nAnother market that often generates much interest is betting on a player to make a nine-dart finish. A nine-dart finish is incredibly difficult to achieve – especially at the PDC Darts World Championship, where the feat has only been achieved nine times – so this market guarantees huge odds.\n\nRead more about PDC Darts World Championship betting to make more informed bets.\n\nWhat are VBET’s outright odds for the PDC Darts World Championship?\n\nGerwyn Price ​10/3\n\nMichael van Gerwen ​9/2\n\nJonny Clayton ​11/2\n\nPeter Wright ​8/1\n\nDimitri van den Bergh ​12/1\n\nJose de Sousa ​18/1\n\nNathan Aspinall ​25/1\n\nRob Cross ​25/1\n\nGary Anderson ​40/1\n\nMichael Smith ​25/1\n\nBar ​50/1\n\n*Odds subject to change and were correct at time of publication (13:00 GMT, November 23, 2021)\n\nWhat are the best bets to consider for the PDC Darts World Championship?\n\nGerwyn ‘The Iceman’ Price is VBET’s 10/3 favourite to win the darts World Championship. Price has had a fine year, having consolidated upon his epic achievements at the Ally Pally 12 months ago.\n\nHis odds nicely reflect his chances, with many darts fans even suggesting that he could even be overpriced to once again raise aloft the Sid Waddell Trophy.\n\nHowever, currently trading at an eyecatching price of 9/2, MICHAEL VAN GERWEN could represent the best value bet of the PDC Darts World Championship.\n\nMVG has of course won the World Championship three times so obviously knows the Ally Pally oche better than most. Critics would argue that he has not been at his brilliant best for a few years now – and they would have a point.\n\nBut his performance at the European Championships, when beaten by Rob Cross in the final, was much more like it and served notice that his game might be coming together at the best possible time.\n\nIf Van Gerwen can get back to playing like the old days when firing home the doubles for fun – this was a huge problem against Cross in the Euros – he will take an awful lot of stopping.\n\nPDC darts fans looking for big each-way prices could also do a lot worse than following the fortunes of ROB CROSS.\n\nCross’ performance against Phil Taylor in the 2018 final was arguably one of the greatest performances ever witnessed at the Ally Pally. Taylor was not playing badly at the time, but Cross simply obliterated the great man with an extraordinary 7-2 triumph\n\nThat was, of course, the high-water mark of his career thus far as things went quiet for Cross over the next two years.\n\nBut the manner in which he charged towards the European Championships final before defeating Michael van Gerwen was much more like it and drew parallels with his World Championship-winning run in 2018.\n\nCross looks to have rediscovered his mojo and can be backed with VBET at big odds of 25/1 to win the PDC Darts World Championship.\n\n*Odds subject to change and were correct at time of publication (13:00 GMT, November 23, 2021)\n\n18+.
