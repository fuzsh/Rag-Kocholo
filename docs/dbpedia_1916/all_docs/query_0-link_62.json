        "text": "After 33 years as a professional Snooker player, the former crucible finalist has announced his retirement from the World Snooker Tour. 8.4.22\n\nAfter losing to Lucas Kleckers 6-1 in the Betfred World Championship qualifying on Thursday it meant that Bond would be relegated off the World Snooker Tour and he’s decided not to enter Q School to retain his pro status.\n\nIt’s an incredible record that has come to end as Nigel Bond was the only player to have turned Professional in the 1980s and kept his place on the tour until now without needing a wild card.\n\nNigel Bond turned pro in 1989 and made the final of the World Grand Prix the following year. At the World Championship in 1994 he staged a huge fightback from 9-2 down to beat Cliff Thorburn 10-9, he then went on to make the quarter finals.\n\nA year later he reached the world championship final beating Stephen Lee, Alan McManus, Gary Wilkinson and Andy Hicks before losing to Stephen Hendry 18-9.\n\n1996 proved to be a huge year for Bond as he won his first and only ranking title at the British Open against John Higgins in a very dramatic deciding final frame. He was 69-0 points down and only 67 points left on the table Nigel got the snooker required, it went down to the final two colours after Higgins missed a chance to win it on the pink, Bond took advantage and cut a very thin black to win his first ever ranking title after 7 years on the tour.\n\nA commentator said “ no one can say that Nigel Bond doesn’t deserve to win, a remarkable final”. Looking back Bond said “ I just thought I had to go for it on that final black. Luckily enough for me it went in”\n\nThat year he also made it to the semi finals in the world championship and was ranked number five in the world. Bond won the Scottish Masters in 1997, the Shoot Out in 2011 and the World Seniors title in 2012.\n\nIn December 2019, Bond proved that he still could still produce his A game as he had a fabulous run to the quarter finals of the UK Championship beating Judd Trump in the last 32 before narrowly losing to Mark Allen in the quarters.\n\n“He said: “Last night was not quite the ending I was hoping for, losing in the World Championship qualifiers. I would like to wish Lukas the best of luck in the next round. Even though I know this time has been coming, today still feels a bit of a shock! At 56, my time as a main tour professional is at an end and I have no intention of playing Q School.\n\n“On a more positive note I’m not putting away my cue any time soon. I will be competing in the World Seniors Championship next month at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. I will continue with my coaching both privately and my involvement with the WPBSA Coaching courses, hoping to impart my knowledge and passion to others who share the love of the game. My role as a WPBSA Players Board director will continue for another three years.”\n\nWorld Snooker thank Nigel for everything he has done for the sport and wish him well.\n\nIt’s been 5 years since we lost one of the greatest lady dart players Stacy Bromberg, after losing her battle to cancer on 12th February 2017.\n\nStacy was born in Los Angeles, California and won the US women’s Darts Championship on 11 occasions.\n\nPlaying darts for many years, 1995 was a great year for the American as she won the North American Open and made the final of the Women’s World Masters, beating Francis Hoenselaar in the semis. In 2002 she qualified for the women’s world championship but lost her first round game 2-0.\n\nStacy then went on to win the 2003 Las Vegas Desert Classic, beating the great Deta Hedman in the final 6-4.\n\n2009 was another great year for Stacy Bromberg as she won the WDF world cup singles championship and the Shanghai women’s singles championship.\n\nIn 2010 the PDC hosted their first ever women’s world championship. The final brought together two great lady dart players, Tricia Wright and Stacy Bromberg, after a hard fought battle Stacy was crowned the winner 5-4.\n\nAs a result of winning that, she qualified for the 2010 PDC Grand Slam, but lost her 3 group games. Nevertheless it was a great opportunity for her.\n\nStacy was a special quest at many PDC events including premier league nights, players championships\n\nShe was a member of the American Darts Organisation and was ranked #1 on the women’s ranking list, after winning many titles on the American circuit.\n\nStacy got her nickname the wish granter from her work in various charities, she worked as a private detective but gave it up after winning the women’s PDC world championship,\n\nAfter numerous battles with cancer, stacy died at her home in Las Vegas, aged 60, she will always be missed by the darts world but is at peace, she was one of the greatest players to ever throw a Dart.\n\nMichael Van Gerwen and Vincent Van Der Voort have sadly had no choice but to withdraw from the PDC World Championship after receiving positive Covid results.\n\nVan Der Voort was set to play James Wade on Monday 27th, but after receiving a positive test it now means James Wade will receive a bye into the last 16. A shocked Van Der Voort stated “I’m incredibly disappointed that I can’t play but otherwise I feel fine”. Vincent currently has no fever or symptoms. Players are required to do a test before going into the venue. He stated ” you are shocked”\n\nMore heartbreaking news as world no.3 Michael Van Gerwen has also tested positive and has had to withdraw. “The biggest nightmare you can imagine” he stated, ” I don’t know where I caught it from” him, Van Der Voort and Dirk Van Duijvenbode had dined together at their manger’s house on Christmas eve, they all tested negative at that time. Van Gerwen and Van Der Voort are now in isolation at a hotel in London. Raymond Van Barneveld also tested positive after his defeat to Rob Cross before Christmas.\n\nAfter Van Gerwen’s exit it means Chris Dobey will receive a bye into the last 16.\n\nIt’s truly awful news and I was gutted to read the headlines. I wish the players a speedy recovery, I was so looking forward to seeing them both in action but health must come first. One thing’s for certain we will be seeing them back on stage in 2022.\n\nNo. 75 in the World, Ted Evetts claimed a huge achievement in his career on Sunday, as he won the 2021 Youth World Championship.\n\nEvetts only got into the tournament as he was 23 at the time of entry, now 24 years of age, it was his last chance to play in youth championship and certainly made it the most memorable one by beating Nathan Rafferty 6-4.\n\nDespite being only 24 years of age, Ted has been a familiar face on the PDC circuit for a long time after first playing on the development tour in 2014 and 2015. He then gained a tour card in 2016 on only the second day.\n\nThe game did not all go in ted’s favour as he had to come from 3-1 down, but eventually found his rhythm to win 6-4. “ I would’ve swapped all my youth titles for this one”. This quote tells us how much winning the title meant to him.\n\nThis is a huge boost for The Man from Warwickshire, Ted will be making his third appearance in the World championship next month, he’s always and will be a lovely man to play and talk to and I can certainly see him climbing up the rankings. I can’t wait to see him play again.\n\nIt is absolutely SENSATIONAL news for the Darts World that two of the greatest darts players, Fallon Sherrock and Lisa Ashton will be returning to the Alexandra Palace to compete in the 2021/22 PDC World Championship.\n\nAfter their success at the PDC women’s series events, both ladies have sealed a spot in the Grand Slam of Darts in November and the World Championship which starts in December.\n\nFallon Sherrock finished in 1st place on the women’s series table and Lisa Ashton followed up second, winning most of the events between them.\n\nFallon Sherrock made history in December 2019 as she became the first woman to beat a man in the PDC World Championship, beating Ted Evetts 3-2. She then repeated her brilliant form by beating Mensur Suljovic 3-1 before losing to Chris Dobey 4-2. She became a social media Star and appeared all over the news and also gained the nickname The Queen Of The Palace.\n\nLisa Ashton made history in 2020 becoming the first woman to win a PDC Tour Card. This year she hit a 100 average at the UK Open becoming the first woman to do this.\n\nFallon Sherrock suffered heartbreak last year after failing to qualify For the world championship and missing out on a tour card. This year she’s turned it around as she made the final of PDC Nordic Masters and has now qualified for the Grand Slam and the Ally Pally.\n\n“I’m really happy with the way that I’m playing at the moment” said Sherrock. “I’m just over the moon”. It will be fallon’s second appearance at the world championship.\n\nLisa Ashton has been a very familiar face on the PDC circuit and has been loving her second year as a tour card holder. “I’m really happy. My game is lifting and I’m happy I’ve got back in the world championship. Lisa will be making her third appearance in the World championship and also the Grand slam.\n\nThese two players are leading figures in world darts and will always be huge inspirations to people to pick up a set of darts. They are capable of doing real damage on the oche.\n\nI am thrilled that they will be competing in the Big TV events again the PDC have made great decisions of allowing the Ladies to show what their made off on the circuit , hopefully we see more and more women coming to Q school, qualifying for the big events and playing on the PDC circuit.\n\nTen Times World Champion and a Six Times World Masters Champion, Trina Gulliver has recently signed a new deal with her long time sponsor, Winmau, as she is making a great comeback to Darts.\n\nDid you know it’s been 20 years since the Golden Girl won her first world title, beating Mandy Solomons 2-1. 2001\n\n20 years on she has successfully added to her CV, 10 World Championship titles, 6 world masters titles and many ranking titles including British open 7 times, British Classic 6 times, Dutch Open 5 times and many more. In 2013 Gulliver was Awarded an MBE due to her fantastic work and service to Darts over the years.\n\nTrina Gulliver has suffered personal problems over the last couple of years which sadly forced her to withdraw from the 2020 BDO World Championship. With the COVID pandemic and the end to the British Darts Organisation, many people may have thought that Trina Gulliver’s darting days were over, But Think Again.\n\nThe legendary darts player has come out on top and has picked up them golden arrows again. A couple of weeks ago she competed in the England Open Weekend and had a great run to the Quarter finals which was a huge step in the right direction.\n\nThis Week really proved gulliver’s travels to darting days again as she signed a new deal with Winmau. “Winmau have been by my side from the very start through the great times and the bad and that shows that they are a people first company and I’m very grateful to carry on with Winmau’s support,” said Gulliver.\n\nI Am THRILLED that Trina is back playing competitive Darts again, she’s been a huge inspiration for many darts players out there and certainly one of my Favourites to watch. I have been waiting to say this and now I finally can, legendary Trina Gulliver, she’s back.\n\nA former window cleaner from Wellington in sommerset named Ryan Searle has picked up his second PDC ranking title of his career.\n\nHeavy Metal won the Players Championship 22 Final to win on day two of the sixth PDC Super Series event. Searle survived a match dart but managed to beat newly crowned Matchplay Champion, Peter Wright 8-7.\n\nRyan sailied past Mark Mcgeeney, Jim McEwan and Raymond Van Barneveld and Rusty Jake Rodriguez to power his way into the Quarter finals. He then dominanted his match against Luke Woodhouse 6-1 with a 100.44.\n\nMartin Lukeman’s hopes of a PDC title were soon crushed as the heavy metal man handed out a whitewash 7-0 with a whopping 116.90 average.\n\nRyan Searle faced Peter Wright in the final averaging 94.96 against Wright’s 102.59. Peter had missed a match dart and Searle took it to a decider and after Wright was unable to find his scoring boots, heavy metal checked out 72 to take the title.\n\nAfter his win Ryan said ” I’ve been playing well for a long time, I believe I should be in the top 32 and that is where I want to be”\n\nHaving previously lost in a players championship final to Jose De Sousa a few weeks ago, Searle soon put that in the bin as his performance today was fantastic throughout the day. He won his first ranking title last February beating Michael Van Gerwen.\n\nAfter his performance today Ryan Searle has earned a place in the World Grand Prix.\n\nRyan is one of my favourite players and one I never get tired of watching. 2021 is proving to be a huge success for the Heavy Metal man. I can’t wait to see him next in action.\n\nThe Darts world was devastated to hear the sad passing of legendary Darts player, Andy Fordham who died on 15th July 2021 aged 59.\n\nAndy Fordham, known as the Viking, first appeared in the BDO World Championship in 1995, reaching the semifinals but lost to Richie Burnett.\n\nGoing into 2004 BDO World Championship, Fordham had suffered semi final heartbreak for 4 years but the year of 2004 is when Andy put the heartbreak defeats in the bin as he won the BDO World Championship beating Mervyn King 6 sets to 3.\n\nAfter a brief spell on the PDC Circuit, Andy returned to the British Darts Organisation. He was awarded a wildcard for the 2014 BDO World Trophy but lost in the first round 4-2 to Alan Norris.\n\nIn October 2015 Fordham qualified for the PDC Grand Slam Of Darts winning one of two BDO Qualifying events. Despite not being able to qualify from the PDC group he was in, Andy did beat Wayne Jones 5-3 with a 106 checkout to win his first televised match in over ten years. The crowd was delighted with his win.\n\nAfter signing a deal with Winmau in April 2016, Andy continued to play Darts on the BDO circuit, receiving a WildCard for the BDO World Trophy but he lost in round one to Glen Durrant 6-2.\n\nAndy Fordham was picked to take part in BBC’SLet’s Play Darts for Comic relief in 2015 and Let’s Play Darts For Sport Relief in 2016.\n\nThere’s no Doubt about it The Viking Andy Fordham was one of the most popular and likeable players in all of the Darts World. Once a legend always a legend. My thoughts are with all his family and friends❤️.\n\nThe 2021 PDC Darts Masters will have changes to the tournament this year.\n\nDue to the Covid 19 restrictions the event will be played behind closed doors which will mean sadly still no fans can attend. The Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes will be the venue, where it has been for many Darts and also Snooker events this year. Milton Keynes in the Marshall Arena has been the home for the Darts Masters since 2015.\n\nStarting in 2013, The Masters has always just featured the top 16 players on the PDC order of merit. However 2021 will be different as the tournament will now feature 24 players which will be the top 24 players on the order of merit. The top 8 players will start their masters campaign in the second round and players seeded 9 to 24 will play in the first round which is best of 11 legs.\n\nThe top 24 players taking part 1. Gerwyn Price- 2018,2020 Masters Quarter Finalist 2. Michael Van Gerwen 2015,2016,2017,2018,2019 Masters Champion 3. Peter Wright-2020 Masters Champion 4. Rob Cross- 2018 Masters Quarter Finalist 5. Nathan Aspinall-2020 Masters Semi Finalist 6. Dave Chisnall-2016 Masters Finalist 7. James Wade-2014 Masters Champion 8. Gary Anderson-2017 Masters Finalist 9. Michael Smith-2020 Masters Finalist 10. Dimitri Van den Bergh 11. Daryl Gurney- 2018,2019,2020 Masters Last 16 12. Ian White- 2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020 Masters Last 16 13. Glen Durrant 14. Krzysztof Ratajski 15. Jose De Sousa 16.

Mervyn King- 2014 Masters Finalist 21. Mensur Suljovic- 2018 Masters Semi Finalist 22. Jeffrey De Swaan 23. Chris Dobey 24. Adrian Lewis- 2013 Finalist\n\nPlayers making their debuts at this tournament are Dimitri Van den Bergh, Glen Durrant, Krzysztof Ratajski, Jose De Sousa, Jeffrey De Swaan and Chris Dobey\n\nWith the Masters increasing to 24 players things will kick off on 29th Friday evening with the 8 first round games, Saturday Afternoon sees Rob Cross, James Wade, Nathan Aspinall and Dave Chisnall facing four of the winners from Friday. It will be the first Saturday Afternoon session since 2016. Saturday night is when we will see Gary Anderson, Peter Wright, Gerwyn Price and Michael Van Gerwen face the other 4 winners of the first round. Sunday Afternoon will be Quarter Finals Afternoon and then the evening will see the semis and the final take place where we will see who is crowned the 2021 Ladbrokes Masters Champion.\n\nIan White has never had a win at the Masters despite playing in it since 2015. Daryl Gurney has also never got out of the first,making his debut in 2018. Both players will be hoping to overcome the Masters Nightmare when they play on Friday Evening.\n\nIt was heartbreak for Michael Smith last year as he missed three darts for the title against Peter Wright. Bully Boy will be certainly wanting to go one step further this year and lift the title that he was so close to last year.\n\nOne player who will certainly be wanting to show dominance is Michael Van Gerwen. Last year MVG was hoping for a sixth Masters title in a row but he crashed out in the first round to Jonny Clayton. The Green Machine will not be wanting a repeat. He will face either Jonny Clayton or Jose De Sousa. Two great players like that means that Van Gerwen may not have an easy task to complete,but he will certainly be giving it everything he has got.\n\nThe defending Masters Champion, Snakebite Peter Wright will face either Krzysztof Ratajski or Simon Whitlock in his first round game. Can anyone stop him from doing the double at the masters and winning again?\n\nThe 2021 Masters will start on Friday 29th January at 7:00pm. Who will be crowned this year’s Masters Champion?? All the Players are certainly capable of pulling out all the stops. It will be a very exciting tournament."
