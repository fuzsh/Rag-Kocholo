        "text": "Back in June, after the success of Golf’s Ryder Cup, the PDC’s big decision makers met at PDC headquarters to discuss the possibility of darts having a similar style tournament. So, is it possible?\n\nCurrently, the only team event on the PDC’s calendar is the annual World Cup of Darts. This tournament was founded in 2010 and is a doubles event, with players teaming up with another player from the same country as them. So far, it’s provided fans with numerous memorable moments. In the first ever world cup, favourites Phil Taylor and James Wade (representing team England), were embarrassingly beaten 6-5 in the first round by the Spanish pair Carlos Rodríguez and Toni Alcinas. Since then, England have won 4 titles with team Netherlands claiming the other four. But is there room for an even bigger international darts tournament?\n\nIn Golf, the Ryder Cup format is, of course, team USA V team Europe. However, as much as everyone loves America’s Larry Butler and Darin Young, this would have to be altered. Team UK & Ireland vs team Rest of the World would certainly be the most even as 11 of the world’s top 32 come from outside the UK & Ireland. If hypothetically, there were 8 players per team and one captain, who would be in this (currently) fictitious tournament? Check out my other posts to see who I would pick.\n\nCheck out my UK & Ireland team right here.\n\nThen, have a look at my Rest of the World team by clicking here.\n\nLet me know who you’d have in your team!\n\nSunday night in Wolverhampton was eventful to say the least. Gerwyn Price took on Gary Anderson in the final of the World Grand Slam of Darts in what was always going to be a grudge match of sorts. However, no one could have predicted what unfolded.\n\nThe Iceman certainly didn’t have the easiest route to his second major final. He came through a group of death by beating Andrew Gilding and Glenn Durrant before losing to Simon Whitlock in what was a dead rubber for him. He then saw off Josh Payne before narrowly beating Simon Whitlock, winning a last leg shootout to claim a 16-15 victory. In the semi-finals, he came from 10-5 down winning 11 of the last 13 legs to beat Mensur Suljović 16-12.\n\nGary Anderson also beat some top players to get to the final. He stormed through the group stages and then dismissed Wesley Harms 10-2 in the last 16. He was then too good for Michael Unterbuchner in the quarter-finals to set up a semi-final show down with world number 1 Michael van Gerwen\n\nGary averaged 102.97, hit 9 180s and had a 48% double success as he saw off his old nemesis to reach the Grand Slam final for the first time in 7 years.\n\nSo, to the final it’s self. Anderson lead 3-2 at the first break and was 6-4 in front going into the second intermission. However, Price won 4 of the 5 legs in the next mini-session to take the lead for the first time. In the twentieth leg, Price checked out 70 on tops with Gary sat on 68; a huge checkout reducing the deficit from potentially 4 legs to two. Then it got interesting. After the fifth commercial break, it got heated on stage. Gerwyn Price, who’s known for big celebrations, was trying to intimidate his opponent even more than usual. Gary even put his hand on Price, against PDC regulations, in an attempt to usher him out of the way.\n\nThis really effected the two time World Champions. Price won 8 of the last 10 legs to lift his first ever major title.\n\nAfter the match, Gerwyn told Sky Sports “He can’t handle playing me. He just moans every time that I’m doing this, doing that. Concentrate on your own game.”I’m throwing my darts. He needs to wait for his turn, hold back. He doesn’t like it with a little bit up him.” He then added “I knew if I put him under pressure he was going to crack, and he did”.\n\nThese two players will certainly meet in next year’s Premier League but could meet before then and this feud feels as though it’s not going to die down anywhere soon.\n\nCaptain: Steve Beaton\n\nSteve Beaton is undoubtedly one of dart’s nice guys. The 1996 BDO World Champion has been playing proffesionally since way back in 1992. Despite his age, he’s the world number 21 after another solid year. However, he’s probably not quite good enough to get into this side as a player. Nevertheless, he’d be the ideal man to motivate a star studded team and guide them to victory.\n\nThe World Champion: Rob Cross\n\nAny team would love to have the reigning World Champion on their side. Rob Cross stunned the world last year by winning the world title just over a year after being an unknown amateur. In May, he made his World Cup debut but was beaten in the quarter-finals by team Belgium. Nevertheless, he’d be a key player in this side.\n\n2 time World Champion: Gary Anderson\n\nOne of the greatest players to ever pick up a dart. Gary Anderson has lifted 9 PDC majors including two World titles, two Premier Leagues and the World Matchplay earlier this year. However, he’s never won the World Cup for Scotland, losing in two finals. Nevertheless, he’d be a key player in this team.\n\nWorld number 2: Peter Wright\n\nOne of the world’s most consistent players. Peter Wright won the U.K. Open in 2017 but the most amazing thing about that is that remains the only major title he’s ever won. He’s lost in the final of the World Championships, the Premier League, the World Matchplay, the World Grand Prix, the Champions League… you name it! This proves his class and he would be a key component of this team.\n\n2017 Grand Prix Champion: Daryl Gurney\n\nIn a very short space of time, Dary Gurney has become a darting superstar. The Northern Irishman reached his first PDC major semi-final in 2015 and has reached five more since. He’s also won the only final he’s ever been in when he beat Simon Whitlock 5 sets to 4 in Dublin. Always a dangerous player.\n\n9 time major winner: James Wade\n\nJames Wade is back! In the last month he won both the European Championships in Dortmund before lifting the World Series of Darts finals title in Vienna just a week later. That ended his 4 year wait for a major trophy after winning the Masters back in November 2014. Wade has won most of dart’s biggest events. He won the World Matchplay in 2007, the Premier League in 2009 and the World Grand Prix on two occasions. His experience would be a valuable asset.\n\nWorld Grand Slam champion: Gerwyn Price\n\nIn the last 12 months, Gerwyn Price has come a very long way in darts. Earlier this year, he took part in the Premier League for the first time but only amassed two points and was eliminated after 9 weeks. However, the former rugby proffesional learned so much from his Premier League experience and, just 7 months later, was lifting the World Grand Slam; his first PDC major. Now up to number 6 in the world, Price is a dangerous player.\n\nFormer World Youth Champion: Michael Smith\n\nThe best player in the world to have never won a really big title? Michael Smith’s talent is without doubt. He burst on the scene in 2013 by winning the World Youth Championships before, 6 months later, beating defending champions Phil Taylor at the World Championships. On his day, Smith really is one of the best.\n\n4 time major finalist: Dave Chisnall\n\nThe current world number 12. Dave has had a somewhat difficult year as his search for that illusive first major goes on. He’s been beaten in the final of the Grand Prix, the Grand Slam, the Players Championship and the Masters but has never quite got over the finish line. His most impressive performance on TV surely is his run in the Premier League back in 2015. He was one dart away from topping the league but finished second to Michael van Gerwen by one point. The following year, he was relegated with just 3 points from 9 games. This more than anything emphasises his inconstancy.\n\nIt’s a good team but would it have enough to beat my team rest of the world?\n\nCaptain: John Part\n\nThe legend that is John Part. He’s a three time World Champion most recently in 2008 when he beat Kirk Shepherd 7-2 at Alexandra Palace. His passion and knowledge of the intrecussies of the game would make him a very valuable captain of this team.\n\nWorld number 1: Michael van Gerwen\n\nThe best player to ever pick up a dart? Two time world champion Michael van Gerwen has swept all before him in recent years and has won every major that the PDC has to offer. Since 2014 when he won his first world title, he’s won 29 out of a possible 45 big majors and would be the main man of any team.\n\n5 time World champion: Raymond van Barneveld\n\nA legend of the game. Raymond van Barneveld lifted the BDO world title 4 times, first in 1998 and for a fourth time in 2005. Then, in his first appearance at the PDC worlds, he took the Circus Tavern by storm and beat Phil Taylor 7-6 in the final. He’s also won the Premier League, two U.K. Opens and 4 World Cups. On his day, despite now being 51-years-old, Barney can beat anybody.\n\n2017 Champions League winner: Mensur Suljović\n\nAfter years on the periphery, Mensur has become one of the world’s best in a very short space of time. That was cemented when he won all 5 of his matches en route to lifting the Champions League in summer 2017. Since, he’s reached 6 major semi-finals, winning two, and won the German darts masters in May this year. Mensur can mix it with the best.\n\n2012 European Champion: Simon Whitlock\n\nBack in 2010, Simon Whitlock burst onto the PDC scene by getting all the way to the World Championships final before losing 7-3 to Phil Taylor. Two years later, he finally won his first major, beating Wesley Newton 11-5 in the final of the European Championships. Between 2015 and 2017 his form dipped dramatically but the Aussie has worked hard and is back up to number 8 in the world. He’d have to be in this team.\n\nWorld Youth Champion: Dimitri Van den Bergh\n\nThe last 12 months have changed ‘dancing’ Dimitri Van den Bergh’s lift. Last year, he beat Josh payne 6-3 to win the PDC World Youth Championship in Minehead. Next weekend, he’ll be looking to defend his title against Martin Schindler. Also this year, he reached the quarter-finals of the World Championships, the Grand Slam and got to the semi-finals of the World Cup as part of team Belgium. He’s a very dangerous player.\n\nWorld Matchplay semi-finalist: Jeffrey de Zwaan\n\nBefore the World Matchplay in July, not many people had even heard of Jeffrey de Zwaan. He only just got into the tournament as he was ranked 31st in the 32 man field. He was then drawn against defending champions Michael van Gerwen in the first round and many predicted his stay in Blackpool wouldn’t last very long. However, he caused one of the sport’s great upset by beating MVG 10-6 in a thriller. In the next round, he faced another two time World Champions Adrian Lewis but dismissed him as well, winning 11-9. Dave Chisnall was his casualty in the quarter-finals before the semi-finals proved to be a step too far as he was beaten 17-12 by eventual winner Gary Anderson. However, this boy has proved he can play so will we see it on a more consistent basis in the near future?\n\n2017 BDO World Master: Krzysztof Ratajski\n\nKrzysztof Ratajski? Who’s that you may be wondering. He only switched from the BDO to the PDC last year but is starting to make an impact. His historic double Players Championship victory just before the Grand Slam caught everyone’s attention. He then eliminated Raymond van Barneveld in the group stages before losing to Jonny Clayton in the round of 16. Nevertheless, he could become a top player.\n\nEuropean semi-finalist: Max Hopp\n\nDarts is the fastest growing sport in Germany and their hero? Max Hopp. He’s helped his country get the back to back World Cup quarter-finals, with the home crowd in Frankfurt behind him. In October in Dortmund, he got all the way to the semi-finals of the European Championships before losing to James Wade; his best performance in a major. He’s a bit of a wildcard pick but is undoubtedly a strong player.\n\nGroup A\n\nMichael van Gerwen, Jonny Clayton, Joe Murnan and Gary Robson\n\nOf course, the favourites to top Group A is Michael Van Gerwen. The World number 1 has won 15 titles this year already including the Premier League, the Grand Prix the World Cup and the Masters.\n\nIt is likely that the battle for second spot will be between Jonny Clayton and Joe Murnan. They meet in the first round of fixtures; a match which will go along way to determining who gets through.\n\nBDO’s Gary Robson will be lucky to get any points on the board.\n\nMy prediction: First: MVG. Second: Clayton.\n\nGroup B\n\nMichel Smith, Raymond van Barneveld, Krzysztof Ratajski and Adam Smith-Neale\n\nThis is very much a group of death. Smith has been in great form this season after reaching the Premier League final and getting to the World Series of Darts Finals earlier this month. He also won the Shànghǎi Darts Masters; his first world series victory.\n\nRaymond van Barneveld is always a dangerous opponent though. He’s had a difficult year though. He did win the World Cup alongside MVG but has not reached the final of any individual tournament.\n\nKrzysztof Ratajski, may not be a big name in the world of darts but is in amazing form. Despite not having a tour card, the Pol won two players championships in the same weekend; only 8 PDC players have ever done that.\n\n2018 BDO World Masters winner Adam Smith-Neale is in for a tough time.\n\nMy prediction: First: Smith. Second: Ratajski.\n\nGroup C\n\nJames Wade, Keegan Brown, Mark Webster, Wesley Harms.\n\nJames Wade’s form lately has been phenomenal. He hadn’t won a major since 2014 but after winning both of the last tournaments he’ll head to Wolverhampton full of confidence.\n\nWade has a pretty favourable draw and he shouldn’t find to many obstacles. Mark Webster and Keegan Brown will fancy their chances of getting through. Webster comes into the tournament in better form but their meeting first off will be key.\n\nDutch BDO player Wesley Harms makes his grand slam debut.\n\nMy prediction: First: Wade. Second: Webster.\n\nGroup D\n\nGary Anderson, Ian White, Steve Hine, Michael Unterbuchner.\n\nGary Anderson is by far the outstanding player in this group. He’s already won the UK Open, the Champions League and the Matchplay this year and will be hoping to win this title for the first time.\n\nIan White will be looking to transfer his form on tour onto the big stage. He’s won two players championships as well as the Dutch Darts championship this year.\n\nSteve Hine has done exceptionally well to qualify for this tournament.\n\nLikewise Michael Unterbuchner. The German BDO player has never won a BDO honour but will be desperate to make an impact.\n\nMy prediction: First: Anderson. Second: White.\n\nGroup E\n\nPeter Wright, Max Hopp, Josh Payne, Jim Williams.\n\nPeter Wright is always a dangerous player. The Scot has reached a major final 9 times in his career but has only ever won one. That was the UK Open in 2017. Will he be lifting the Grand Slam trophy come a week on Sunday?\n\nMax Hopp is one of the brightest young talents in world darts. He got all the way to the European championships semi-finals in his native Germany last month but has never got out of the group stages at this competition. He’ll be confident of doing that this time though.\n\nJosh Payne will be a dangerous opponent though. He’s won two PDC ranking events one of which came earlier this year but faces an uphill task to get out of this group.\n\nBDO’S Jim Williams will do well to get any points on the board.\n\nMy prediction: First: Wright. Second: Hopp.\n\nGroup F\n\nSimon Whitlock, Gerwyn Price, Glen Durrant, Andrew Gilding.\n\nSimon Whitlock is the favourite to come through this group. His year has been constant if not spectacular including semi-final appearances at the World Cup of Darts and the Auckland Darts Masters.\n\nGerwyn Price will be hot on his heals though. The Welshman has reached the quarter-finals of 5 TV tournaments this year and will be confident of getting through this group at least.\n\nGlenn Durrant is the current two time back-to-back BDO World Champion. He got all the way to the last 8 of this competition last year and will fancy another run.\n\n47 year-old Andrew Gilding has done remarkably well to get to this tournament but ‘Gold Finger’ is massively up against it.\n\nMy prediction: First: Whitlock. Second: Durrant.\n\nGroup G\n\nMensur Suljović, Stephen Bunting, Scott Mitchell, Martin Schindler.\n\nThis is very much the group of death.\n\nThere is one outstanding player though.\n\nIn the last 12 months, Mensur has gone from being someone capable of beating good players on his day to someone who wins major titles. Suljović won the 2017 Champions League and, earlier this year, added the German Darts Masters. In June, he lost in the final of the World Matchplay but that run should give him confidence to go along way again.\n\nHe’s been joined in the group by 2015 BDO World Champions Scott Mitchell. This’ll be his fifth appearance at the Grand Slam but he’s never got out the group.\n\nStephen Bunting is another former BDO World Champion. He burst on the scene in his first year in the PDC but has been in poor form since.\n\nMartin Schindler may well fancy his chances of getting through. The German has been in good form on the floor recently but would love to transfer some of that form to this tournament.\n\nMy prediction: First: Whitlock. Second: Durrant.\n\nGroup H\n\nRob Cross, Dimitri Van den Bergh, Mark McGeeney, Ryan Searle.\n\nAs world champion, Rob Cross is the outstanding player in Group H. He has only won one title since lifting the Sid Waddell trophy but is in good form so will fancy his chances of winning this one.\n\nDimitri Van den Bergh will feel he can topple the World Champion. He was knocked out the Worlds by Rob at the quarter-final stage so may want to exact some revenge.\n\nThis is only the fourth major Ryan Searle has qualified for. He’s appeared at two Players’ Championships and one UK open so will look to spring a surprise.\n\nMark McGeeney is the BDO number one and finished runner up in the BDO World Championships last year. It’ll be a big ask for either him or Searle to get through.\n\nMy prediction: First: Cross. Second: DVDB."
