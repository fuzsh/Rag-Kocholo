        "text": "Teenager Luke Littler stormed through to the PDC World Darts Championship semi-finals with a 5-1 victory over Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan.\n\nThe 16-year-old followed up his 4-1 win over Raymond van Barneveld with another dazzling display at Alexandra Palace.\n\nLittler is now favourite for the trophy after Michael van Gerwen was beaten 5-3 by England's Scott Williams.\n\nHe will play fellow Englishman Rob Cross next after the 2018 champion came from 4-0 down to beat Chris Dobey 5-4.\n\nWorld number four Williams will play Luke Humphries in the last four after sweeping past Dave Chisnall to reach his first world semi-final.\n\nLittler, the youngest player to win a match at the World Championship, has dropped only four sets all tournament.\n\n\"Now I am dreaming,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I'm two games away. I'm definitely thinking about lifting the title.\"\n\n\"If I keep it up I've got a good chance.\"\n\nIn another dominant performance, the Warrington-born youngster hit five 180s, had three 100-plus finishes and averaged just under 102 - the third time he has averaged at least 100 in the tournament. He has not dropped more than one set in any of his five matches.\n\nAfter wrapping up the victory Littler, who has now earned Â£100,000 in prize money, knelt down and took selfies with fans who had gathered at the front of the stage.\n\nHe will face Cross on Tuesday from 19:30 GMT.\n\n\"Rob Cross won it on debut as well,\" Littler said. \"I am looking forward to playing him in the semis. It will be nice to chill in the morning and then come back in the evening.\"\n\nLittler, who started playing darts aged 18 months old, has risen from relative obscurity to sporting stardom during his run at the Alexandra Palace.\n\nA Manchester United supporter, he received good-luck messages from defender Jonny Evans and former captain Gary Neville before his meeting with Van Barneveld.\n\nHe was asked for a photograph by Arsenal players Aaron Ramsdale and Declan Rice last week, and watched Tottenham's Premier League match against Bournemouth on New Year's Eve in hospitality.\n\nIn Monday's first game, Cross made history by becoming the first player to fight back from 4-0 to win a World Championship quarter-final in a classic encounter with Dobey.\n\nThe 33-year-old looked to be facing certain defeat after falling 4-0 down in less than an hour, but appeared revitalised after a break before the fifth set.\n\nThe world number eight reeled off four straight sets to level the game, before a 130 checkout made it five in a row to seal a famous victory.\n\nCross also recovered from 8-2 down to beat Dobey 11-9 at the 2022 World Matchplay in Blackpool.\n\n\"I just thought it's all about me and I still believe even when I'm 4-0 down. I had one of the greatest comebacks against Chris at the Matchplay, so I might as well make it at the Worlds,\" Cross said.\n\nOn the prospect of facing Littler, Cross said: \"He's amazing. He's 16. I've got a boy who's four years younger. Whatever he achieves, he's going to have a bright future.\"\n\nVan Gerwen went into his match against Williams as the favourite to lift the trophy for a fourth time after the likes of Michael Smith, Gerwyn Price and Peter Wright had been knocked out earlier in the tournament.\n\nBut the world number two was punished for a below-par display, missing 27 darts at doubles, as Williams reached the last four for the first time in his second appearance at the World Championships.\n\n\"I just knocked the best player in the world out,\" Williams said.\n\n\"He wasn't the Michael van Gerwen we've seen over the last couple of games but that's not my problem.\n\n\"I hit the doubles and probably should have won it a little bit easier. I'm absolutely loving it up there. I love a crowd.\"\n\nHumphries is the highest-ranked player left in the competition after making light work of Chisnall to record his 17th straight win.\n\n\"It's really exciting. We could have a new world champion or a two-time world champion,\" Humphries said.\n\n\"I don't think you can call it now. It is anybody's game regardless of who is favourite.\""
