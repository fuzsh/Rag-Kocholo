        "text": "Recap\n\nAdrian Lewis’ bid for a third World Championship crown got off to a flying start at Alexandra Palace as he swept aside Dennis Smith 3-0.\n\nThe No. 3 seed, who emerged victorious in 2011 and 2012, gave Smith little chance to get on the board as he produced an efficient performance to move through to the second around.\n\nWorld No. 11 Justin Pipe also advanced with minimal fuss. The Englishman dropped just three legs on his way to victory over Arron Monk, who failed to reach his potential on the night.\n\nSpeaking after the win—per pdc.tv—Pipe said, \"We both suffered from first round nerves out there. I could see Arron was really struggling and I just had to get the job done which I did.\n\n\"The main thing was to get the win and I can go home now, have a good Christmas, and prepare for my game against Devon [Petersen] next Friday.”\n\nKeeping with the theme of the night, Michael Smith lived up to his tag as favourite as he dispatched of Morihiro Hashimoto.\n\nThe Japanese player overcame Paul Lim in the Preliminary Round earlier in the night and took a 1-0 lead over Smith but that’s when it started to unravel.\n\nSmith, the 32nd seed, now faces the daunting prospect of Phil Taylor in the Second Round but he will need to up his level if he’s to trouble the World No. 1.\n\nIn the opening bout of the night, Andy Smith bounced back from a stuttering start to see off Steve Brown 3-1.\n\nBrown came close to a coveted nine-darter in the third set, landing eight perfect darts before spluttering on the last.\n\nNext up for Smith, the No. 27 seed, is the winner of James Wade and Darren Webster.\n\nTuesday's Results\n\nFirst Round:\n\nColin Lloyd 2-3 Beau Anderson\n\nZoran Lerchbacher 4-1 Ben Ward (P)\n\nVincent van der Voort 3-1 Matt Clark\n\nMichael van Gerwen 3-0 Zoran Lerchbacher\n\nSimon Whitlock 3-0 Ross Smith\n\nRecap\n\nMichael van Gerwen opened up his World Championship account with a relatively uneventful 3-0 victory over Zoran Lerchbacher.\n\nThe Dutch world No. 2 is hoping to go one better this year after losing out to Phil Taylor in last season’s final, and he did what was required to negotiate his way past the first hurdle.\n\nVan Gerwen’s opponent, Lerchbacher, looked impressive earlier in the evening as he came through his Preliminary Round match-up with Ben Ward, hitting an average of more than 90.\n\nBut the Austrian failed to carry his form into the contest with Van Gerwen, and last year’s beaten finalist was able to cruise through without reaching the dizzying heights he is capable of.\n\n\"I didn’t play great tonight, but the first round is about winning, not producing incredible performances and ton-plus averages,” said Van Gerwen—per pdc.tv—who now faces Kevin McDine in the Second Round.\n\n\"Last year's tournament was incredible for me, it was just disappointing to fall at the final hurdle. Walking out onto stage tonight brought some very special memories for me.\"\n\nSimon Whitlock laid down his intentions with an impressive 3-0 win against debutant Ross Smith in the last bout of the night. The former runner-up posted an average of 97.35, in a high-scoring encounter.\n\nColin “Jaws” Lloyd was sent packing in the opening game of the night. The fan favourite fell 3-2 to Beau Anderson in an entertaining sudden-death bull-off.\n\nElsewhere, Vincent van der Voort beat Matt Clark in a scrappy encounter. Both players failed to fire but Van der Voort lived to fight another day, winning 3-1."
