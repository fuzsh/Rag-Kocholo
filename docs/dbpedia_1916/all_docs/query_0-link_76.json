James went on to win his second major title this weekend at the bwin World Series of Darts Finals at the Multiversum in Vienna.\n\nAs play began on Friday afternoon for James it was a 6-3 win against Ross Smith that saw him safely move through to Saturday’s second round match against Mensur Suljovic and another 6-3 win to make it through to Sunday’s final day.\n\nAs the stage was set for the quarter finals it was James’ 10-5 win against Jamie Lewis that had #TeamWade fans believing that he could be bringing this home again.\n\nAs the semi-finals approached it was Wadey v’s Barney, following Raymond’s success and a 10-8 win against Michael van Gerwen in his quarter final match.\n\nAs they stepped up to the oche, our left-handed champion proved to the world of darts, he truly has new found motivation and a determination to reach the top with an incredible win 11-2 and a ticket to the finals once again.\n\nAs the scene was set it was fellow Englishman Michael Smith who was to be James’ opponent for the final match who, like James, had played some incredible darts over the course of the weekend, making his own way through a who’s who to reach the final stage.\n\nAs the match began, you could hear the cheers as James took an early 3-0 lead. Michael then proved, he too meant business, levelling the playing field to 5-5 at the second break.\n\nAs the legs continued, once again it was neck and neck at 7-7 before James landed a 112 check out to take the lead 8-7. Michael responded and went on to take the lead for the first time in the match 9-8.\n\nAs the final legs of the match began, it was clear that both men were determined not to give up without a fight. James was to lead the charge and turn the final back around breaking Michael’s throw to take a 10-9 lead.\n\nAs the competition was drawing to a close it was an incredible end to the match when James bust 121 and Michael levelled 10-10.\n\nIt was the gripping final leg that then brought fans to their feet and home and abroad – it was just too close to call and then… Wadey did it… double 18 for the win!\n\nDaddy really can play darts Arthur and is bringing you home another trophy #justforarthur\n\nJames ranks sixth in the PDC Order of Merit.

Fans saw Ricky break the first leg, but James was to follow this up with seven straight legs, including four 14-dart finishes, and an overall 10-5 win to secure his place in the quarter finals.\n\nIt was England v’s Wales as James and Gerwyn Price stepped up to the oche on Sunday afternoon. A neck and neck performance was to follow but it was the dramatic decider that clinched the deal for Wadey 10-9.\n\nIt was then onto the semi-final’s where James was to meet Max Hopp. As play began, #TeamWade fans were wondering if the dream may be over as Max took a 9-5 lead. James fought back with style, winning six of the final seven legs and going on to take the overall win of 11-10.\n\nAs the scene was set for the final, Wadey was to meet Simon Whitlock, who had also played some very impressive darts and won some battles over the course of the weekend to win his place on this particular stage.\n\nAs play began, ‘The Wizard’ made a strong start with a 3-1 lead. ‘The Machine’ responded with three successive legs and a 4-3 lead before the leg by leg battle commenced resulting in 8-8.\n\nIt was then #TeamWade fans watching at home and abroad saw the true determination and concentration in James’ eyes to ‘do this for his boy’ by pushing forward with successive 13-dart legs.\n\nWith victory in sight, he did it, hitting the double ten to clinch his eighth major title.\n\nArthur, that one was for you! #forArthur … and your Mum of course.\n\nJames now ranks sixth in the PDC Order of Merit. His success this weekend has also secured his spot at the Grand Slam of Darts, where he reached the final in 2016. The match will take place in Wolverhampton in November and will be broadcast live on Sky Sports.\n\nJames will next be playing this weekend, at the World Series of Darts Finals which takes place between November 2-4 at the Multiversum in Schwechat, Vienna and will be broadcast live on ITV4 and on PDCTV-HD.

I know that we will both just go up there and play darts and may the best man win.”\n\nWade started the strongest, hitting double ten to take the first leg before breaking with a brilliant 116 checkout in the second, which included his first maximum.\n\nvan Gerwen broke straight back before ‘The Machine’ reeled off five consecutive legs in business like fashion, hitting two more maximums along the way.\n\n‘Mighty Mike’ stuck in his first 180 as he pulled it back to 7-3, only for Wade to win the next two legs, holding with a sensational 146 checkout, before another 180 helped him break the Dutchman’s throw once again.\n\nvan Gerwen managed to break back, cutting Wade’s lead to 9-4 but the world number three restored his six leg lead with a seventh succesful shot at double ten.\n\nFormer World Master van Gerwen grabbed the games’ fourth consecutive break of throw, taking out 25, to leave the second session five legs behind.\n\nThe Dutchman, who had hit a nine-darter 48 hours earlier, went off with his fourth 180 in the 16th leg but ‘The Machine’ took out another fabulous shot with 122 on the bull.\n\nvan Gerwen took out 24 and then 65 to reduce Wade’s lead to 11-7, despite the 2007 winner hitting his fifth 180.\n\n‘Mighty Mike’ levelled up the maximum count before hitting double 16 to move within three legs of Wade with a break.\n\nThe 23-year-old won a fourth leg on the spin, hitting double five before Wade made it 12-9 with a 12 dart leg.\n\nvan Gerwen hit double 16 to peg back ‘The Machine’ again, before grabbing a seemingly crucial break of throw with a fantastic 88 outshot on the bull.\n\nWade ensured he kept daylight between them, taking out 72 to break straight back, before a neat 86 finish put him three legs clear at 14-11.\n\nvan Gerwen kept himself in it with a 13 darter, bere Wade’s ninth maximum helped to move him within a leg of victory.\n\nThe Dutchman held to keep the pressure on but Wade clinched his place in the semi-finals with a brilliant 71 checkout, finishing on double ten.\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nSee some of the world’s top darts players in action at The Untouchables,Eastbourne on Friday 19 October.\n\nJames Wade is hoping to make some more memories in the 2012 Betfair World Matchplay, as he goes in pursuit of his eighth PDC major title at Blackpool’s Winter Gardens.\n\nThe world number three has reached the final of the prestigious tournament four times since 2006, winning it once, and aims to build on his success in the seaside town.\n\n“I have some fantastic memories of the place and I love the tournament,” said Wade, the 2007 winner. “I really began to make my mark as a professional darts player in Blackpool. It was the first major I won so it is a special place for me.”\n\n‘The Machine’ has experienced mixed fortunes so far this year. He reached the semi-finals of both the Ladbrokes World Championship and the McCoy’s Premier League before his hopes of defending his Speedy Services UK Open crown were ended in the third round last month.\n\nBut Wade, the PDC’s second most succesful player after Phil Taylor, is confident in his ability and hopes to hit top form when he faces Welshman Richie Burnett on Sunday in the first round.\n\nHe said: “I’m sure that I can do very well in this tournament and there is no reason why I can’t go all the way if I’m at the top of my game, but I have to win the first match first and foremost.\n\n“Richie is a very good player, who has shown a bit of form recently so I am expecting a good battle but I’m used to that and I have shown time and time again that I can win these battles.\n\n“Every game is going to be difficult. You can only take it one game at I time and confidence only comes with wins but I know that when I’m playing well, I can beat anyone.”\n\n“I was disappointed not to go further in the UK Open, but the big tournaments come thick and fast at this time of year, and this is my chance to bounce back, and I have proved on many occasions I can do that.”\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nFor all the latest James Wade news and for details of events and exhibitions involving ‘The Machine’ – follow his Official Fan Page on Facebook by clicking here\n\nImage courtesy of Lawrence Lustig/PDC\n\nJAMES WADE 7 – 7 RAYMOND VAN BARNEVELD\n\nJames Wade booked his place in the semi-finals of the McCoy’s Premier League, after a dramatic last leg shoot-out with Raymond van Barneveld in Newcastle.\n\n‘Barney’, who needed to win to take the final Play-Off spot, led 7-6 against ‘The Machine’, who was in need of a draw to qualify.\n\nWade produced a great leg under pressure to ensure it would be him who made it through, hitting 60, 180, 140 and 81, before hitting double top to set up a semi-final clash with Phil Taylor at London’s O2 next Thursday.\n\n“It was such a hard game, with the crowd against me,” said Wade, who won the tournament in 2009.\n\n“The eight players this year have been brilliant. I have been lucky at times over the last 14 weeks, but you have to be. I’m delighted to be in the semi-finals.”\n\nBarney hit his first 180 in the opening leg, which he won on double 16. ‘The Machine’ responded with a clinical 95 checkout, before van Barneveld hit double ten to go back in front.\n\nThe Dutchman applied the pressure with his second 180, before grabbing a break of throw in a tense fourth leg, in which both players missed doubles.\n\nWade broke back immediately to reduce the deficit but van Barneveld did the same, to take a 4-2 lead into the break.\n\n‘The Machine’ grabbed the fourth consecutive leg against the throw, hitting his first maximum in the process.\n\nThe world number three then hit double eight to hold his throw and level the match at four legs apiece.\n\nWade took the lead for the first time, hitting double twelve for another break of throw, before taking out 80 to go 6-4 ahead and in need of one more leg for a Play-Off place.\n\n‘Barney’ produced a sensational 161 checkout to keep the match alive, and he finished on the bull again to restore parity.\n\nBoth players missed shots at the bull in the 13th leg, before van Barneveld hit double sixteen, but Wade held his nerve and his throw in the final leg, to book his place in the semi-finals.\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nJames Wade and three more of MODUS’ star players have hailed the role of sponsors The Money Shop, after a successful start to 2012.\n\nWade, Simon Whitlock, Raymond van Barneveld and Paul Nicholson are all enjoying the support of UK’s number one instant cash provider, and have all spoken of their gratitude and pride in sporting the company’s logo.\n\nThe players have been repaying their sponsor for putting faith in them by proudly showing off the logo, as well as making personal appearances at various branches around the country.\n\nWhitlock has enjoyed a particularly strong few months, having already qualified for the semi-finals of the McCoy’s Premier League. ‘The Wizard’ highlighted the importance of the partnership.\n\nHe said: “Sponsorship is such a massive thing for darts players. When I hit the top a couple of years ago, I was struggling for sponsorship, so to have such a well known brand like The Money Shop onside is absolutely fantastic.\n\n“I hope my performances are repaying their support and I am pleased that I will be showing them off on my shirt in the Premier League semi-finals.”\n\nWade and van Barneveld are both still in strong contention to reach the Premier League Play-offs and the pair both paid tribute to their sponsors, ahead of their crucial showdown on Thursday.\n\n“The Money Shop has been brilliant,” said van Barneveld, who appeared at the Birmingham Store last week. “I am pleased to give something back when I visit them and meet their staff and also with my performances on TV.”\n\nWade added: “It will be a tough match next Thursday. Both Raymond and I are desperate for a place in the semis, not just for ourselves but everyone who supports us. Our sponsors put a huge amount of faith in us, and we want to do well for them too.”\n\nNicholson reached the final of the World Cup of Darts, when he and Whitlock represented Australia earlier this year. ‘The Asset’ is hoping that was just the start of a good year ahead in major tournaments.\n\n“I really want to win a TV tournament this year,” said Nicholson, who is appearing at the Metrocentre store, Gateshead on Wednesday.\n\n“Simon and I were so close in the World Cup but it wasn’t to be. But I’m getting closer and the brilliant backing from The Money Shop can only help me move forward. They believe in me as much as I believe in myself and I can’t thank them enough.”\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nHe is the second most successful player in PDC history and still just 28 years old. The future is set to be bright for James Wade, who is taking steps away from the oche to ensure that he continues to achieve more on it.\n\n‘The Machine’, who has won seven televised titles, is sure he will add to his impressive collection of major trophies, but is not putting himself under any unnecessary pressure to do so, as he knows that he has time on his side.\n\nPhoto: Lawerence Lustig/PDC\n\n“This is the laid back year for me,” said the world number three. “I am not setting myself any targets at all this year. I’ve got a few other things on my mind, which isn’t an excuse, but I’m not expecting too much. I know that I have got a lot, in terms of ability though, so who knows what might or might not happen.\n\n“Having things sorted at home is massively important for me. At the moment I’m concentrating on doing that. I’ve started off a little car mechanics venture with my father, which is something I enjoy, and I’m having some building work done at home.\n\n“Part of that is for me to have practise room for the first time ever. I know that’s what I need to do to keep improving and I’m happy to be getting things sorted out.”\n\nWade lost his first three matches of the 2012 McCoy’s Premier League season, prompting him to be written off in some quarters, but he bounced back with three consecutive victories to put himself into strong contention for a playoff place.\n\nDespite suffering defeat at the hands of Phil Taylor last Thursday, Wade, who won the competition in 2009, is in no doubt that has the ability to go all the way once again.\n\nHe said: “I know I can win it, it’s whether I will or not that I’m not sure about it. I made it tough for myself again and that’s my own fault, but I’m back in the running now and it’s going to be a case of which James turns up every week.\n\n“Then if I get to the finals, it’s which James turns up in that. But I’m happy to let people talk about their favourite forces. I’ll just do my job and hopefully I can upset a few people with good results.”\n\n‘The Machine’ doesn’t believe that his early season form was caused by a hangover from his World Championship semi-final defeat at the hands of Adrian Lewis, who battled back from four sets down to win amid bizarre circumstances at the Alexandra Palace.\n\nPhoto: Lawerence Lustig/PDC\n\nWade remains confident that he will be crowned world champion at some stage in his career and insists that he is more than happy with his achievements so far.\n\n“To be honest I don’t think that my form in the World Championship was that great,” said Wade, whose last four showdown was blighted by a draught on stage and late finish.\n\n“I have to look back and laugh at the fact that I lost to Adrian in that semi-final. It is annoying that I haven’t been a world champion yet. It’s bugging me but I will win the tournament. It’s a case of when rather than if.\n\n“I would love win it, but in all honesty, I wouldn’t swap a couple of World Championship titles for everything I’ve won. No way. I wouldn’t want to have two, or even three at the expense of the seven titles I’ve got. Of course I want to win it. If I don’t then I don’t, but I know I will.”\n\nDespite that confident statement, the Premier League star admitted that self belief is something that he has found more and more difficult to have as his career has progressed.\n\nHe said: “My two happiest times, in terms of my career, were winning my first two major titles in 2007. I realised that I was good enough to be a successful professional player when I won the World Matchplay.\n\n“Then when I went into the World Grand Prix, which became my second TV title, I knew I was going to win it before the tournament had even started. That was a really nice feeling. Unfortunately I have struggled to replicate that kind of confidence since then.\n\nPhoto: Lawerence Lustig/PDC\n\n“It is my own fault and it’s largely down to commitment towards the game, but I’m getting that commitment back right now and hopefully I can get back to where I want to be.”\n\nWhere Wade wants to be is undoubtedly at the very top of Europe’s fastest growing sport, a sport which he feels should get the press coverage that its audience demands.\n\nHe added: “I’m sure people would happy to see some other sports have a little bit less coverage in newspapers to give darts half a page a week. Unfortunately, the people who make those decisions seem to be scared to try something new for whatever reason.\n\n“It may be that they have an old fashioned attitude towards darts, but that fact that it is SKY’s most second watched sport is a little bit of an indication that there is a market for it in the written press too.\n\n“If they actually went and asked ‘Joe public’ in the street, they would realise that they are missing out on quite a bit of exciting writing that people would love to read.”\n\n‘The Machine’ is back in action on Thursday night when he takes on Simon Whitlock in the McCoy’s Premier League in Cardiff.\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nJAMES WADE 8 – 6 RAYMOND VAN BARNEVELD\n\nJames Wade saw off a potential comeback from Raymond van Barneveld in a high quality all MODUS clash at the Brighton Centre on week five of the McCoy’s Premier League.\n\nPhoto: Lawrence Lustig/PDC\n\n‘The Machine’ hit five 180’s and two ton-plus finishes as he sealed an 8-6 victory over the Dutchman. Wade had led 6-1 but ‘Barney ‘, who fought back from four legs down to win last week, pulled the score back to 6-5 and 7-6 before Wade won a last leg decider to grab his second successive win.\n\nThe 2009 Premier League champion admitted that he is yet to peak in this year’s competition but is pleased to have started to turn his form around, after losing his first three matches.\n\nWade said: “I did a job on Raymond early doors but I seemed to shut off later on. I’m glad to get the win, I’m slowly but surely getting there and I feel like I’m going in the right direction now. I’m still not playing my best though, but if I do play my best darts I know I will be in the top four come the end of the season.”\n\nWade sprung into life from the start, opening with a maximum and winning the first leg in eleven darts. ‘Barney’ replied by hitting his first 180 in leg two, which he claimed in the same number of darts. The Dutchman just missed the bull for a 161 finish before ‘The Machine’ hit double ten to edge back in front. Wade then grabbed the first break of throw by hitting double top. The left-hander increased his lead to 4-1 with a brilliant 110 checkout.\n\nVan Barneveld looked like he might claw a leg back when he hit his second maximum but Wade took out a stunning 154 finish to go four legs up before the break. ‘The Machine’ hit his second 180, followed immediately by his third, on his way to winning the seventh leg. ‘Barney’ levelled the maximum count in the next leg before hitting double 16 to reduce Wade’s lead to 6-2.\n\nThe five-time world champion won the ninth leg against the throw before holding to make it three legs on the spin. Wade relieved the pressure by winning the eleventh leg to ensure he would claim at least a point, hitting his fourth maximum in the process. ‘Barney’ kept his hopes alive by hitting double two to reduce Wade’s lead to two legs. He then grabbed another break of throw to ensure that the match would go all the way, despite Wade hitting his fifth 180.\n\nThe world number three almost won the match in sensational style but just missed the bull for a fabulous 161 finish. He sealed the victory nonetheless, hitting his trademark double ten to add to two more points to his total, having claimed his first with victory over Kevin Painter last week.\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nJames Wade moved a step closer to winning his first Ladbrokes World Championship title after beating John Part in an amazing sudden-death leg at the Alexandra Palace.\n\nThe Machine produced a stunning performance under no end of pressure from the three-time world champion, hitting five checkouts of over a hundred to win the quarter final clash.\n\nWith the players inseparable after eight sets and eight legs, Wade held his nerve to win a tense final leg. He won the bull to take the darts and hit 81 followed by a 140 to move closer to victory. Part kept up the pressure with a 174 to leave 128, but missed his second treble. The Machine kept his cool and hit 85 in two darts to win the battle and book his place in the semi-finals.\n\nWade hit double ten to hold his throw in the opening leg before grabbing an early break of throw by hitting double top. The seven-time major winner then found the double twenty bed again to win a third leg on the spin and take the first set.\n\nPart got a leg on the board before Wade took out 48 to level. Darth Maple held again but the world number three hit back with his first 180 followed by a fine 82 finish to square up the set. Part had to pull out a wonderful 167 checkout to hold his throw, pulling the match level.\n\nWade hit double ten to take the lead in the third set and then produced a tidy 65 finish to break his opponent’s throw. The UK Open winner then wrapped up the set, hitting double ten to regain his advantage.\n\nThe Machine then put on a sensational show to win set four, hitting a brilliant 108 finish against the throw. He followed that up with his second maximum before producing another fabulous checkout, this time 140. He then hit double top again to open up a three one lead.\n\nWade continued to finish clinically when he took out 103 to edge ahead in the fifth set. Part held his throw to level before The Machine took out 84 in two darts to do the same. He then just missed the Bull for a 126 finish before the Canadian won the next two legs to win the set.\n\nPart held his throw in the first leg of the sixth set before taking out 116 to break again and double his lead. Darth Maple then took out 75 to level the match.\n\nWade stopped the rot by hitting double top to hold his throw before his opponent did the same. The Machine hammered home another maximum before taking out 82 under pressure to edge back in front. Darth Maple held again and Wade responded with his fifth 180 but was unable to prevent Part breaking his throw to go ahead in the match for the first time.\n\nWith Part needing to keep hold of is throw in the eighth set to win the match, Wade hit double hit ten to grab a crucial break. He then took out 81 to double his lead with a fantastic twelve dart leg. The Canadian held his throw to pull a leg back but The Machine found double top again to restore parity and force a deciding set.\n\nWade hit double five under extreme pressure to hold his throw in the first leg of the decider before Part levelled. The Machine kept his composure under pressure again, hitting double two to edge back in front. Darth Maple held his throw again, meaning either player needed to win by two clear legs.\n\nWade forced himself in front in the tie breaker by hitting the tournament’s 500th 180, followed by a magnificent 124 checkout on the bull. The Canadian pulled level again by holding his throw before breaking to leave himself throwing for the match. The Machine kept his title dream alive with another big finish, taking out 108 to pull himself level. He then produced back to back 180’s to go back in front with a phenomenal twelve dart leg. Part hit double top to hold his throw and force the sudden death leg, which The Machine won on double top to reach the final four\n\nWade will play either Adrian Lewis or Terry Jenkins on Sunday evening for a place in the final.\n\nBy Chris Murphy\n\nWade earned a deserved victory over Steve Brown, while Webster disposed of top seed Justin Pipe in a dramatic affair.\n\nBoth players are back in action in the quarter finals on Sunday, when one of them could pick up the trophy.\n\nJames Wade 8 – 6 Steve Brown\n\nJames Wade progressed into the last eight of the Players Championship with victory over Steve ‘The Bomber’ Brown.\n\nThe UK Open winner showed only glimpses of his brilliant best, but still had too much for his opponent.\n\nWade was as deadly as ever on double ten to take the first leg, but Brown hit back, taking out 64 to win the second.\n\nThe next leg again went with the throw, as Wade put himself back in front. He then grabbed an early break, hitting double top to open up a two leg lead.\n\nThe Machine hit his first 180 in leg five, and went on to win it with a nice 106 checkout as he threatened to run away with it.\n\nWade almost took out a spectacular 170 in the next leg, just missing the bull, before Brown hit double ten to get his self back into the game.\n\nBrown then managed to break back to reduce Wade’s lead to a single leg, but The Machine pulled off a stunning 142 finish to open the gap once more.\n\nWade’s lead quickly increased to 6-3 with a 60 checkout, before Brown hit double one to pull a leg back.\n\nWade then produced a leg of real quality, as he finished on double 12 in just a dozen darts. Brown earned a stay of execution when he hit double top to take the twelfth leg.\n\nThe Bomber threatened to make it more than just that by breaking the throw in the next leg, but Wade inflicted his punishment by breaking straight back to secure a fairly comfortable win.\n\nWade faces Scott Rand in Sunday afternoon’s quarter final.\n\nMark Webster 8 – 7 Justin Pipe\n\nMark Webster held his nerve to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against number one seed Justin Pipe.\n\nWebster, seemingly undeterred by his opponent’s unusually slow style, won a nail-biting last leg decider and progressed into the quarter finals.\n\nWebster suffered an early setback when Pipe broke his throw in the opening leg, but he took out 80 to break straight back.\n\nWebster successfully returned to double ten to win the third leg before Pipe levelled things up.\n\nThe Welshman edged ahead again, holding his throw to take leg five before Pipe restored parity. It was Pipe who got the break, hitting bull to take a 4-3 lead.\n\nPipe then hit double 18 to open up a two leg lead for the first time, but Webster bounced back by taking out 64 to win the ninth leg.\n\nWebster then inflicted a big blow on his opponent, a former boxer, by hitting eight perfect darts against the throw. He just missed out on a stunning nine dart finish, but cleaned up to level the score.\n\nThe world number six hit double top to win the next leg, but was unlucky to bust his score by hitting the wrong double when going for a break of throw before Pipe took out 101 to square the score at six all.\n\nWebster missed four darts at double six allowing Pipe to break and leave himself throwing for the match.\n\nPipe then missed four darts at doubles and Webster duly punished him, hitting double five with the last dart in his hand.\n\nIn a tense last leg, Pipe missed two more darts for the match and Webster took out 60 to ensure that it was the Spider who claimed eight legs.\n\nWebster will face Dave Chisnall in the quarter finals on Sunday afternoon."
