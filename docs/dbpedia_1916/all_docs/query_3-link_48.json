        "text": "Keegan Brown provided the shock of the tournament so far as he knocked out 2012 champion Raymond van Barneveld at the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton.\n\nPDC world youth champion Brown led 9-3 and almost surrendered his lead in crumbling fashion, but recovered to seal his quarter-final spot at Wolverhampton's Civic Hall with a 10-7 win.\n\nVan Barneveld showed early signs of nerves with three missed darts at double-top, which allowed Brown to ease into a 4-1 lead with three 180s and a 121 finish.\n\nVan Barneveld hit back with a maximum of his own followed by an 86 finish, but Brown restored his lead with a fourth 180 and 87 checkout. The youngster moved five legs clear at 7-2 as \"Barney\" was made to rue more missed doubles, but a 106 finish saw the Dutchman hit back to trail 7-3.\n\nBrown kept his nerve to move within a leg of the match at 9-3, but three match darts passed him by. Van Barneveld uttered a sigh of relief as he broke back on double five to get the score back to 9-5, before Brown missed a fourth match dart to concede another leg.\n\nBrown looked set to go out in style but missed 170 on the bullseye for the match and Van Barneveld coolly took out 125 to move within two legs. But when \"Barney\" missed double four to reduce the deficit to one, Brown stepped up to finish 122 on the bull and clinch a show-stopping finish.\n\nHe will play Dave Chisnall for a place in the semi-finals after the St Helens star impressed with a 10-3 victory against Robbie Green. Chisnall immediately finished 136 to break throw and followed with a 125 checkout as he raced into a 5-0 lead.\n\nGreen hit back with an 83 finish on the bullseye to prevent the whitewash, but Chisnall was able to capitalise on his opponent's poor finishing and secure what will be a first appearance in a Grand Slam quarter-final with a confident performance.\n\nKim Huybrechts booked a quarter-final spot with a 10-5 victory against Alan Norris. Both players broke the throw as the first four games were shared, but Huybrechts rattled off four straight legs with finishes 82, 118 and 72 to lead 6-3.\n\nThe Belgian broke again with double two before checking out 144 on double 12 to move within a leg of the match at 9-4. Norris responded to put a fifth leg on the scoreboard but Huybrechts finished in style, landing a 155 checkout for the win and a last-eight clash with Michael van Gerwen.\n\nPDC world champion Van Gerwen was far from his best as he saw off the challenge of Terry Jenkins with a 10-4 win. The Dutchman led 4-1 but Jenkins rallied to level the clash at 4-4, before Van Gerwen rattled off seven straight legs to advance.\n\nÂ© ESPN Sports Media Ltd"
