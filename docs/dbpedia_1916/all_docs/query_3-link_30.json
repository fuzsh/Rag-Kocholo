        "text": "He’s been trending on social media as his path to the final of the PDC World Darts Championship gets agonisingly closer.\n\nBut just who is Welsh darts sensation Jamie Lewis, the man who beat England's Darren Webster 5-0 on Friday to reach the semi-finals against Phil 'the power' Taylor.\n\nHere's all you need to know...\n\nWHERE WAS HE BORN AND WHERE DOES HE LIVE?\n\nHe was born on November 8, 1991, in Carmarthen and now lives in Cardigan.\n\nWHAT IS HIS NICKNAME?\n\nHis nickname for the stage is Fireball, but off the oche he's known as Rasta.\n\nHe explained: \"I've been called Rasta by my friends for years now, people started calling me it mainly because I love reggae music and I'm very passionate on Bob Marley's music. I also used to have a big afro and braided my hair!\n\nWHAT IS HIS DARTING BACKGROUND?\n\nHis father Mark played darts in the rival BDO set-up from 2001-10 with his best finishes coming with a quarter-final appearance in the 2003 and 2004 England Open.\n\nWHEN DID JAMIE JOIN THE PDC?\n\nIn January 2012, Lewis successfully earned a PDC tour card on day four of the Pro Tour Qualifying School. This enabled him to participate in all this and next year's Players Championships, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events.\n\nIS REACHING THE SEMI-FINALS OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP HIS BEST DISPLAY?\n\nYes though his best effort before this week was to reach the last eight of the 2015 World Grand Prix before losing the Dutch legend Michael van Gerwen 3-0.\n\nWHO HAS HE BEATEN SO FAR AT THE ALEXANDRA PALACE?\n\nHe started off with a 2-1 victory over Belgium's Kenny Neyens and then came a 3-0 triumph over in-form Welshman Jonny Clayton, who last month reached the final of the Players Championship in Minehead before losing to Van Gerwen.\n\nThen came the biggest shock of the tournament so far when on Wednesday he dumped out No.2 seed, Scotland's Peter Wright, before going on to account for England's James Richardson by the same 4-1 scoreline.\n\nHe was in sparkling form against Webster hitting 14 180s for a 101.26 match average while completing 15 of 35 throws at the double produced a 42% average and a comfortable 5-0 whitewash.\n\nHAS HE WON ANY EVENTS?\n\nAs a youth player his first win came in the 2009 World Masters and that year he also won the WDF World Youth Cup.\n\nIn 2010 he landed the Wales Classic and in 2012 came the PDC Youth Tour England and Germany crowns.\n\nHe was the PDC Challenge Tour England champion in 2013 and the PDC Development Tour England title winner in 2015.\n\nWHAT IS HIS WALK-ON MUSIC?\n\nIt's Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars."
