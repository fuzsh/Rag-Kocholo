        "text": "Sixteen-year-old Luke Littler made history at the World Darts Championship - despite falling short in the final.\n\nNicknamed \"The Nuke\", the teenager's sensational performances saw him become the youngest player to reach the final and win plaudits from his idol Phil \"The Power\" Taylor.\n\nHe swept away darts legend Raymond van Barneveld, a five-time world champion, to secure a place in the quarter-finals - before beating Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan to reach the semi-finals.\n\nLittler clinched his shot at glory after cruising to victory over 2018 champion Rob Cross in the last four but was beaten by world number one Luke Humphries in the final.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the sport's new prodigy - from learning to play in nappies as a toddler to his celebratory meals going viral.\n\nPlaying darts at 18 months old\n\nHe may only be a teenager but Littler, from Warrington, Cheshire, has been practising his throwing for some time.\n\nHe told Sky News: \"There's a video on YouTube of me when I was 18 months in a nappy listening to Raymond van Barneveld's music, listening to Phil Taylor's music, doing their celebrations.\n\n\"That's when it started - 18 months and in a nappy on a magnetic board.\n\n\"[Aged] four or five I was on a proper board but it was a bit low and then about seven to eight (years old), that's when I started playing [at] the proper height and the proper length. So it's just been all darts in my life so far.\"\n\nTalent is one thing, but having the right support system to nurture it is just as important.\n\nThe teen clearly thinks a lot of his parents, who he says are \"proud\" of what he's achieved so far.\n\n\"They just can't believe (it), I can't believe it myself,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\"But it's just good to have a set of parents who are supportive and that are always there for me and I've got a good management team around me. So it's just the best group of people that can be around me, to be honest.\"\n\nFor coaches and friends who watched Littler play at St Helens Darts Academy in his early years, his rapid rise in the professional game is no surprise.\n\n\"He was averaging stupid averages that you should be [getting at] like 16 to 20 years old, but he was doing it at 10,\" his former coach Karl Holden told Sky News.\n\n\"He was special then,\" he added.\n\nEleanor Cairns, who has known the 16-year-old for four years and is also a darts player, told Sky News Littler has got a \"natural throw\" and showed natural talent \"from the start\".\n\nBut she believes his success comes down to far more than just being gifted.\n\n\"I know he does a lot of practice for the competitions,\" Ms Cairns said.\n\n\"Luke never really stops playing darts throughout the week either, so he's definitely always throwing. It does take a lot, but I know he's worked hard for it.\"\n\nAdam McMillan, the principal of Littler's former school, Padgate Academy, says the teenager is already creating a \"lasting legacy\".\n\nHe told iNews that his achievements are \"a massive testament to his hard work,\" adding that his main interests were always in maths and PE.\n\nViral celebrations\n\nA photo of Littler celebrating his first-round win at the PDC World Dart Championships with a kebab went viral on social media.\n\nThe 16-year-old's newly formed fan base probably expected a similar photo to come out after his second victory too.\n\nBut a plot twist came the following morning, though, as Littler revealed on Sky News that he opted for a different celebratory meal.\n\n\"Last night was just a standard KFC,\" he said.\n\nHis meal plan has now become a staple of his post-match interviews, and the teenager's certainly not shying away from it.\n\nAsked how he would prepare for the final, he said: \"I'll keep doing what I have been doing. I don't wake up until 12, in the morning go for my ham and cheese omelette, come here and have my pizza, and then go on the practice board.\n\n\"It is what I have been doing every day - if it isn't broken, don't fix it.\"\n\nFans and fame\n\nLittler's matches have seen the famously rowdy crowd at London's Alexandra Palace (or Ally Pally) chanting: \"You've got school in the morning.\"\n\nHis celebrity status is rising with every dart he throws. His Instagram account has gone from 4,000 followers at the start of this tournament to over 450,000.\n\nLittler told Sky News he could feel the nation's support while on the big stage.\n\n\"Everyone's cheering, wanting my autograph and everything,\" he said.\n\n\"Even young kids having my darts shirt onâ€¦ It was good to see when I stepped on the stage.\"\n\nThe teenager admitted his life has drastically changed as a result of his success.\n\n\"I'm doing interviews with Sky Sports. Usually I am up in the morning watching Sky Sports News. Now I am on the news. It's all incredible. I am taking it all in my stride,\" said Littler.\n\n\"[My life has] already changed.\"\n\nLittler, an avid football fan, was spotted at Arsenal's match against West Ham on 28 December, were he said people taking photos with him throughout.\n\nHe told Sky News: \"When I was putting my hood up, people were walking around in front of me asking for a picture and I was like, 'What? I've got my hood up, I'm trying to hide'. But it's all good that people are wanting pictures, I'm glad.\"\n\nTwo days later, he took a photo with a particularly high-profile fan of his at another football match: Tottenham star James Maddison.\n\nHis career so far\n\nLittler won his first match at the PDC World Championship on Wednesday, averaging an astonishing 106.12 in his demolition of former Lakeside champion Christian Kist in the first round.\n\nHe held off a mid-match charge from the experienced Andrew Gilding to knock out the 20th seed with a 3-1 win in the second round.\n\nIn the third round, Littler beat Canadian Matt Campbell four sets to one to make history as the youngest player to ever reach the last 16 of the tournament.\n\nA sensational performance followed against van Barneveld on 30 December, with the teenager winning 4-1 over the man 40 years his senior.\n\nLittler produced another superb display against Dolan in the quarters, storming into a 4-0 lead, before winning the match 5-1.\n\nHis dazzling form continued in the semi-final, as he dismantled 2018 champion Cross 6-2 to reach Wednesday's final against Humphries.\n\nHis form means he is now a household name, but his talent has been evident for some time.\n\nHe won the England Youth Grand Prix in 2019, became England Youth Open champion in 2021 and won his first senior title at the Irish Open later that year.\n\nHe won the Welsh Open in 2022 and this year notched further senior titles at the Isle of Man Classic, Gibraltar Open, British Open and British Classic.\n\nThe 16-year-old is also a back-to-back JDC World Champion and reigning World Youth Champion.\n\nLittler's got big dreams\n\nLittler has admitted he's performed well beyond his own expectations.\n\n\"It's not even sunk in yet,\" he told Sky Sports after reaching the final. \"I threw big averages on the floor the past year and I'm happy to bring it on to the big stage.\n\n\"I've got to stay focused, be Luke Littler and relax. It's beyond believable,\" he added.\n\n\"I only set a goal of winning one game and coming back after Christmas and I'm still standing.\n\n\"I can't imagine lifting the trophy. I have to just beat whoever is in front of me. I've got to stay mature, got to be myself and keep myself to myself.\n\n\"I've got to stay composed and try and get over that line.\n\n\"This World Championship I've got nothing to lose, it's just a free hit and here I am still standing. There's no pressure, I just take everything in my stride.\n\n\"I've got to believe in myself, believe in my ability and so far, so good.\"\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nLittler's heroes, such as 16-time world champion Phil Taylor, have been singing his praises.\n\nThe Power touted the teenager as one to watch going into this tournament, telling Sky Sports News in early December: \"He's very good but he's 16 so time will tell when he's about 18,19 when he's got a few pound in his pocket - that's when you've got to be really dedicated.\"\n\nWhat's more, Sky Sports Darts' Wayne Mardle has said the youngster is \"probably the most naturally gifted player I have ever seen in my life\".\n\nAfter Littler's astounding semi-final win, Mardle said: \"He averages 106.05 in the biggest match of his life. The kid just takes it all in his stride. Absolutely magnificent.\n\n\"If you're sat at home and witnessed that or are here, you've witnessed something utterly mind-boggling.\n\n\"A 16-year-old is in the final of the World Championship.\"\n\nLittler's opponent in the final, world number one Luke Humphries, says he is under no illusions over the threat the teenager poses.\n\nAfter delivering one of the best ever performances at the tournament by beating Scott Williams 6-0 in the semi-final, Humphries said of Littler: \"The way he's played, I've seen it many times.\n\n\"When you come up on this stage it can be a lot tougher but he's just proved he's got a lot of bottle.\n\n\"Nothing is going to faze him. If he plays like he did tonight, tomorrow is not going to faze him at all, so I will probably have to play the game of my life.\"\n\nHe added he will \"probably have to play like that again\" to stand a chance of beating Littler.\n\n\"I know what's in front of me and what the task is,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got to play at my best tomorrow but I'm hoping I make him play his best as well and we give the fans hopefully one of the best World finals we have ever seen.\""
