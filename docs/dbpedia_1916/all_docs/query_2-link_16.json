        "text": "The PDC World Darts Championship is the most prestigious tournament in the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) calendar, featuring the world’s top professional darts players. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the event:\n\nHistory\n\nThe PDC World Darts Championship was first held in 1994, following the split of the World Darts Council (WDC) from the British Darts Organisation (BDO). It has been held annually since then, with the exception of 2020 when the BDO folded and the WDF took over the BDO’s events.\n\nFormat\n\nThe PDC World Championship was established following the split from the British Darts Organisation (BDO) in 1992. The founders of the PDC sought to create a championship that would rival the traditional BDO World Championship, with the aim of attracting more sponsorship, providing higher prize money, and enhancing the global appeal of the sport. The event quickly grew in stature and prestige, becoming the definitive competition in professional darts.\n\nThe tournament is a knockout event, with 96 players participating. The format is as follows:\n\nFirst and second rounds: Best-of-five set\n\nThird and fourth rounds: Best-of-seven sets\n\nQuarter-finals: Best-of-nine sets\n\nSemi-finals: Best-of-11 sets\n\nFinal: Best-of-13 sets\n\nVenue\n\nThe PDC World Darts Championship has been held at Alexandra Palace in London since 2008, previously being held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet from 1994 to 2007.\n\nPrize Money\n\nThe total prize pot for the 2020 tournament was £2.5 million, with the winner receiving £500,000.\n\nBroadcast\n\nThe tournament is broadcast live on Sky Sports, with highlights and classic matches available on the PDC’s official website, livepdc.tv.\n\nSponsors\n\nThe tournament has been sponsored by various bookmakers over the years, including Skol, Proton Cars, Vernon’s Pools, Red Band, Ladbrokes, William Hill, Cazoo, and Paddy Power.\n\nTrophy\n\nThe champion’s trophy is named the Sid Waddell Trophy, in honour of the late darts commentator Sid Waddell, who passed away in 2012.\n\nWinners\n\nThe tournament has had 12 different winners since its inception. Phil Taylor has dominated the competition, winning it 14 times, including a streak of eight consecutive titles from 1995 to 2002. Other multiple winners include John Part, Adrian Lewis, Gary Anderson, Michael van Gerwen, and Peter Wright.\n\nMost Successful Players\n\nPhil Taylor, known as “The Power,” is synonymous with the World Championship, having won an unprecedented 14 titles under the PDC banner. His dominance in the sport helped elevate the profile of the championship during its formative years. Other notable champions include Michael van Gerwen, a three-time winner known for his remarkable scoring and finishing abilities, and Gary Anderson, a two-time champion celebrated for his smooth throwing style and consistency at the oche.\n\nRecent Winners\n\nThe most recent winners are:\n\nYear Winner Runner-Up 1994 Dennis Priestley Phil Taylor 1995 Phil Taylor Rod Harrington 1996 Phil Taylor Dennis Priestley 1997 Phil Taylor Dennis Priestley 1998 Phil Taylor Peter Manley 1999 Phil Taylor Peter Manley 2000 Phil Taylor Dennis Priestley 2001 Phil Taylor John Part 2002 Phil Taylor Peter Manley 2003 John Part Kirk Shepherd 2004 Phil Taylor Kevin Painter 2005 Phil Taylor Mark Dudbridge 2006 Phil Taylor Peter Manley 2007 Raymond van Barneveld Phil Taylor 2008 John Part Kirk Shepherd 2009 Phil Taylor Raymond van Barneveld 2010 Phil Taylor Simon Whitlock 2011 Adrian Lewis Gary Anderson 2012 Adrian Lewis Andy Hamilton 2013 Phil Taylor Michael van Gerwen 2014 Michael van Gerwen Peter Wright 2015 Gary Anderson Phil Taylor 2016 Gary Anderson Adrian Lewis 2017 Michael van Gerwen Gary Anderson 2018 Rob Cross Phil Taylor 2019 Michael van Gerwen Michael Smith 2020 Peter Wright Michael van Gerwen 2021 Gerwyn Price Gary Anderson 2022 Peter Wright Michael Smith 2023 Michael van Gerwen Michael Smith\n\nRecords\n\nThe tournament has seen several records set, including the highest average score in a match, which was achieved by Phil Taylor in 2009 with an average of 114.05.\n\nNoteworthy is the 2007 final, where Raymond van Barneveld triumphed over Phil Taylor in a sudden-death leg, widely regarded as one of the greatest matches ever played. Another significant match was the 2013 final where Michael van Gerwen, then a rising star, was defeated by Phil Taylor in a passing of the torch moment that heralded a new era in darts.\n\nWomen’s Winners\n\nThe tournament also features a women’s event, with the first winner being Trina Gulliver in 1993. The most recent winner is Lisa Ashton.\n\nInternational Qualifiers\n\nThe tournament features international qualifiers from various countries, including the UK, Europe, Australia, and Asia."
