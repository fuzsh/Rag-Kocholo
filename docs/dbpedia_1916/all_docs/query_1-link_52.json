        "text": "Luke Littler, the 17-year-old British phenom, isn’t old enough to buy a beer or drive a car, but he has scored millions of dollars in the world of professional darts—and minted millions of new fans.\n\nBy Matt Craig, Forbes Staff\n\nNothing has been the same for Luke Littler since December, when the story of a mild-mannered 16-year-old British phenom advancing to the finals of the Professional Darts Corporation World Championships turned him into an overnight celebrity in the United Kingdom. Suddenly Littler was appearing on talk shows alongside actress Millie Bobby Brown, fielding DMs from David Beckham and rubbing shoulders with the players of his beloved Manchester United. His Instagram account skyrocketed from 4,000 followers to more than 1.3 million.\n\nYet as the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) comes to New York for its annual U.S. Darts Masters event at The Theater at Madison Square Garden this weekend, the now-17-year-old Littler is somewhat reluctant to embrace his new role as the face of his sport.\n\n“I've got the popularity, which is a good thing,” says Littler, a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe class of 2024. “But I'd love to just have no one know who I am and just get on with my life as a nobody.”\n\nThat seems unlikely now, given that his World Championship final was the most-watched program—excluding soccer—in Sky Sports history, peaking at 3.7 million viewers. And “Luke the Nuke” has spent the last five months proving the success was no fluke. His finals run qualified him for the 16-week Premier League Darts season, where he finished at the top of the standings and won the season-ending playoff last week in front of more than 14,000 fans at London’s O2 Arena.\n\nA TV RATINGS BULLSEYE\n\nLuke Littler may have lost the PDC World Championship final in January 2024, but his appearance more than doubled the previous ratings record with 3.7 million viewers. Here’s how that compares to other events (including soccer, golf, cricket and boxing) on Sky Sports\n\n“For all the doubters, hello!” Littler shouted to the crowd during his post-match interview, in a rare outburst of emotion. “You're not doubting me anymore!”\n\nThe major title netted Littler $350,000, bringing his total prize money to just over $825,000 since January. When combined with endorsements, royalties and appearance fees, Forbes projects Littler will earn more than $1.5 million (before taxes) in 2024. Matt Porter, CEO of the Professional Darts Corporation, predicts Littler will finish among the top three earners in the sport at the end of the year. “I don't really look towards [business],” Littler says of his earning potential. “I'm just playing my darts every week and trying to win.”\n\nGreater riches are less than a year away, after he turns 18 in January. At 17, Littler cannot legally promote the gambling or alcohol brands that are a cornerstone of the sport’s sponsorship portfolio. He doesn’t even have a driver’s license. His only significant partnership to date is with boohooMAN, a youth-focused apparel brand that had never worked with darts players but tells Forbes via email, “Luke was such a success this is something we are keen to explore further in the future.”\n\nGiven his outsized popularity and everyman appeal, Littler is expected to make six figures this year from a royalties agreement with Target Darts on sales of his signature darts collection and shirts. He can also fetch more than $10,000 per night in appearance fees for exhibition events.\n\nThat kind of haul may not land him anywhere near the list of the highest-paid athletes in the world (minimum earnings in 2024: $45.2 million), but it’s substantial money for a teenager, especially Littler, who still lives with his parents in Warrington, an industrial town in northwestern England. He says his most significant purchase to date was a pack of digital trading cards on the FIFA videogame series. He brings an Xbox with him on the road and spends most of his free time playing FIFA or Fortnite online with his friends back home, leaving all business concerns to his manager. “All I do is get on a plane, sleep and play darts, and chill out,” he says.\n\nLittler’s emergence as the sport’s biggest star, someone capable of minting new darts fans—the so-called “Luke Littler effect”—could mean even more for the bottom line of Matchroom Sport, the Brentwood, U.K.-based company that owns the PDC and, by extension, essentially the sport of professional darts. It’s already a lucrative business for Matchroom, producing estimated net profits of more than $28 million in the fiscal year 2023 (ending June 30) on $63 million in revenue. Darts accounts for nearly half of the net profits posted by the entire company, which has an estimated $365 million in total revenue and operates in boxing, snooker and handful of other sports.\n\nMatchroom founder Barry Hearn, former chairman of the PDC, called Littler’s World Championship run a “Tiger Woods moment” for the sport because of its transformational economic potential.\n\nPorter, who took over the PDC from Hearn in 2008, agrees that Littler’s emergence has “changed the outlook of the sport.” While the company has yet to see tangible returns—ticket sales for its signature events were already sold out before Littler broke through and its multiyear sponsorship contracts and television rights deals are not up for renewal—he is expecting “step change growth” in the next two or three years.\n\nThat became obvious to Porter during Littler’s fourth round World Championship match against Raymond Van Barneveld in December, which had 1.5 million viewers on Sky Sports, up from 400,000 viewers on the corresponding date the year prior and nearly matching the sport’s all-time viewership peak of 1.65 million. By the semifinals, Littler’s match had crushed the record with 2.4 million viewers, topped again by 3.7 million watching the final. “Anybody who’s not welcomed the extra attention and profile that Luke's driven is being very small-minded,” says Porter.\n\n“Darts is a sport that’s not that popular,” Littler says. “But I’m glad to say that I’ve made it a bit more popular.”\n\nAs surprising as Littler’s meteoric rise may be to the casual sports fan, Porter says those in the darts community have been tracking his ascension for years. At nine, he began competing at a darts academy near his home, winning so much he was rapidly bumped up in age divisions until he was competing in and winning under-21 events as a 13 year old. He had to wait until he turned 16 to join the PDC World Youth Championship, which he promptly won, earning him a bid into the senior World Championship.\n\nIn tournaments, Littler has developed a reputation as a showman and says he enjoys playing in front of large crowds. During the Premier League playoffs, he became the second player ever at the event to hit a “nine-darter”—ending a game with nine perfect throws, the darts equivalent of bowling a perfect game. The other was Phil Taylor, a 16-time world champion and the holder of many records Littler now chases.\n\nAway from competition, Littler appears unaffected by the spotlight or the burden of great expectations. He can often be found sitting in the practice room playing on his phone, practicing as little as 20-30 minutes per day—“if that” he says—while most other pros throw for three of four hours. When he’s at home he says he won’t pick up darts at all. He has been questioned by his fellow PDC competitors, but Littler brushes off comments about his training methods. After the New York tournament, he is looking forward to a vacation in Orlando, with visits to Universal and Disney planned and perhaps some reflection on how darts has changed his life.\n\n“It's one of them weird sports,” Littler says. “You stand in there throwing some tungsten into a board and you’re winning yourself some money and creating yourself some legacy.”\n\nMORE FROM FORBES\n\nForbesThe World's Highest-Paid Athletes 25 And Under For 2024ForbesA Record $3.9 Billion Haul For The World's 50 Highest-Paid AthletesForbesMagic Johnson Is Now A Billionaire"
