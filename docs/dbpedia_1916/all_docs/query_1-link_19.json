        "text": "In just a few weeks, the Padgate Academy pupil will step onto the biggest stage of his young career – and will do so having been crowned as the world’s best young player.\n\nOn Sunday, the Warringtonian 16-year-old was crowned as the 2023 PDC World Youth Champion after holding off a fightback from Holland’s Gian Van Veen in the final.\n\nIt capped a breakthrough 2023 season on the PDC circuit for “The Nuke,” who has won five Winmau Development Tour titles to secure his place on the PDC Tour for the next two years.\n\nHe edged out Van Veen 6-4 in a high-quality final, racking up an average of 102.16 and scoring seven 180s to take the trophy.\n\nLuke Littler discovers World Darts Championship opponent\n\nNow, he is getting ready to play on the biggest stage the sport has to offer as he prepares for his debut at the PDC World Darts Championships at London’s Alexandra Palace.\n\nHe has been drawn to face Dutchman Christian Kist in the first round, with the winner to face reigning UK Open champion Andrew Gilding.\n\nThe teenager is in the same draw bracket as former world champions Peter Wright, Gerwyn Price, James Wade and Raymond van Barneveld.\n\n“It’s amazing. I can’t put it into words,” Littler said.\n\n“I flew out of the traps but Gian was coming back, and I’m just so glad I got over the line.”\n\n“I’ve got a two-year Tour Card secured and I have the World Championship coming up in a few weeks’ time.\n\n“This will give me a massive boost playing in front of such a big crowd, and I cannot wait to get to Ally Pally now!”\n\nLittler took the early initiative in the final, settling any nerves with a 14-dart opening-leg break on the same stage upon which Luke Humphries would later beat Michael van Gerwen to claim the Players Championship title.\n\nVan Veen, who topped this year’s Development Tour Order of Merit ahead of Littler, delivered an instant reply to level the match, but Littler then slipped into top gear.\n\nIt took him just 12 darts to win the third leg and a blistering barrage followed to put him 5-1 up and on the brink of victory.\n\nHowever, the Dutchman fought back with checkouts of 94, 100 and 120 to take the score to 5-4 but he then missed double five in leg 10 to force a deciding set.\n\nThat left Littler to hit double 20 and cap off an exhilarating victory and claim £10,000 in prize money, with both players also securing a place at next year’s Grand Slam of Darts tournament having reached the final.\n\nLittler’s run to the final saw him beat former UK Open semi-finalist Keane Barry in the last 16 before an average of 101 saw him beat Poland’s Sebastian Bialecki in the last-four.\n\nLittler swept aside former UK Open semi-finalist Keane Barry in the last 16, before averaging 101 in his semi-final success against Poland’s Sebastian Bialecki.\n\nVan Veen, meanwhile, dumped out defending champion Rock in August’s quarter-finals, before edging out compatriot Wessel Nijman with a 103 average in a high-quality semi-final.\n\nThe Dutchman had topped the Development Tour Order of Merit ahead of Littler before the top two progressed to Sunday's Minehead decider, with the teenager this time taking glory."
