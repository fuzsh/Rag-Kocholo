        "text": "Luke Littler has taken the darts world by storm after reaching the finals of the PDC World Darts Championship, knocking out some of the sport's biggest stars in the process - at the age of just 16.\n\nThe rising sports star, nicknamed The Nuke, has breezed through the competition so far in his remarkable debut run, only six months after sitting his GCSEs. After beating former world champions Gerwyn Price and Gary Anderson as well as five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld in previous rounds, Littler is the hot favourite to win the trophy this year.\n\nHe beat Northern Ireland's Brendan Dolan 5-1 in the quarter-finals at London's Alexandra Palace, and secured his place in the final with a 6-2 win over former champion Rob Cross on Tuesday, ahead of Wednesday's final. As the youngest ever player to reach the finals of the sport's biggest event, Littler has already secured £100,000 in prize money from the competition.\n\nREAD MORE: What happens now at Newcastle United as 'growing concerns' threaten to hit season that promised much\n\nGet all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter\n\nBorn in Cheshire in 2007, Littler began playing darts when he was just 18 months old after his parents bought him a magnetic board. After moving on to a big dartboard at the age of five, he has never looked back - going on to win a string of prestigious youth titles including the England Youth Grand Prix and the Isle of Man Masters youth competition in 2019.\n\nLittler is the current PDC World Youth Champion, and broke records as he made his World Darts Championship debut with the highest average for a debutant after whitewashing former world champion Christian Kist in the first round. In another dominant performance, the Warrington-born youngster hit five 180s, had three 100-plus finishes and averaged just under 102 - the third time he has averaged at least 100 in the tournament.\n\nLittler has not dropped more than one set in any of his five matches, and has dropped only four sets all tournament. \"It's going to take a lot to stop me,\" he said.\n\n\"It feels unbelievable. I never thought I would have got to the semis on my debut year.\"\n\nThe World Darts Championship airs on Sky Sports' dedicated Darts channel. On Wednesday, Littler will compete in the final against Luke Humphries."
