Masters this evening.\n\nWorld number four Lewis secured his spot in the European Tour event in Jena by defeating Adrian Gray and Scott Taylor at Arena MK in Milton Keynes.\n\nFive-time world champion van Barneveld overcame Luke Woodhouse and then edged past in-form Darren Johnson 6-5 as he clinched his spot in the £135,000 streamed tournament.\n\nFormer European Tour winner Mervyn King dropped

battled past former European Tour winner Steve Beaton 6-5 in their decider to win through.\n\nFormer BDO world champion Mark Webster qualified at the expense of William O’Connor and Paul Nicholson, Northern Ireland’s Daryl Gurney got the better of Lee Bryant and James Richardson to move into the main event, but his fellow countryman Mickey Mansell was beaten by Australia’s Kyle Anderson in their decider.\n\nWelsh trio Jamie Lewis, Jonny Clayton and Robert Owen joined Webster in qualifying, alongside English throwers Robbie Green, Brian Woods, Andrew Gilding, Joe Murnan, Ricky Evans and Ted Evetts.\n\nThe UK Qualifier kicked-off the PDC Pro Tour weekend at Arena MK in Milton Keynes, with Players Championship 5 and 6 being held at the venue on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nBoth events will be

shaping up to be the closest in a number of years, and that was clear to see from some of the players in Cardiff last night.\n\nAhead of last night’s action at the Motorpoint Arena, the evening’s schedule was cut from five matches to four, as Kim Huybrechts withdrew from his fixture with Peter Wright due to family reasons.\n\nWith Huybrechts set to be eliminated, along with Jelle Klaasen, from the tournament following last night’s fixtures, Wright was awarded a 7-0 win, in accordance with the PDC’s rules.\n\nIt is a rule which certainly irked with a few of the players who did play last night. Could the PDC have waited a few weeks and got Huybrechts to come back to fulfill his final fixture?\n\nThat appears to be what those players may have wanted to happen, but, in truth, this is a situation which has never arisen before. A player, who can no longer avoid elimination, withdrawing from the one fixture he had left to play.\n\nAnother option would have been for all of the results involving Huybrechts in the tournament to be expunged from the record books. Another suggestion on social media was for Wright to play a challenge match against a player not in the competition and the result to go towards his record instead.\n\nWright was a big favourite to beat Huybrechts in their scheduled match at Cardiff last night and many would have expected him to pick up two points if the fixture was played.\n\nWhat the players seem to be annoyed about was the ruling which gave Wright a 7-0 win in the fixture. Given that there has only been half a dozen or so whitewashes in the history of the Premier League, it would have been a big ask for Wright to replicate that one-sided scoreline if the match was played.\n\nThe plus seven legs difference Wright accrued from this outcome could be a deciding factor come the end of the season, as places in the play-offs could come down to legs difference.\n\nBut has Wright really been given a big advantage? We now enter the second league phase of the Premier League next week and each player still has seven fixtures and 14 points to play for.\n\nThe four players who end up finishing in the top four will have all deserved to be there. The Premier League is the longest tournament on the calendar, played over 15 weeks before the finals night at The O2, so players complaining about the PDC’s ruling yesterday should look at the bigger picture.\n\nIf the shoe was on the other foot, and one of the players who complained had been awarded the 7-0 win, would they have had the same reaction last night? It is very doubtful.\n\nFollow @dartsweekly\n\nBy Alex Moss\n\n31 MARCH 2017 • 12:43PM\n\nThe fixtures for the remaining six league nights of this year’s Betway Premier League have been confirmed this afternoon.\n\nFollowing the elimination of Jelle Klaasen and Kim Huybrechts last night, the remaining eight players now set their sights on winning play-off spots.\n\nNext week at the 3Arena in Dublin will see James Wade and Raymond van Barneveld compete twice, as they face each other after earlier taking on Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor respectively.\n\nThe other two fixtures in Dublin will see Dave Chisnall face Peter Wright and Adrian Lewis meet Gary Anderson, the latter in a quick repeat of last night’s clash in Cardiff.\n\nWeek 11 at the Echo Arena in Liverpool will see UK Open champion Wright face off against the world’s top two ranked players, van Gerwen and Anderson.\n\nThe other fixtures on the night will see Anderson meet Chisnall, Lewis play van Barneveld and Taylor and Wade face off.\n\nWeek 12 at The SSE Arena in Belfast sees Chisnall and Taylor clash as they double up, with the former earlier taking on Lewis and the 16-time world champion meeting Anderson.\n\nWright will take on Wade, while the Dutch duo of van Gerwen and van Barneveld will meet in the other Belfast clash, with the reigning Premier League champion aiming to avenge his defeat in Manchester earlier this month.\n\nThe return to Birmingham’s Barclaycard Arena on April 27 sees van Gerwen and Lewis compete twice on the night, facing each other in the final game after earlier taking on Wade and Chisnall respectively.\n\nTaylor takes on Wright and Anderson goes up against van Barneveld in the night’s other two games.\n\nThe final two league nights will each feature four games as the tournament returns to The Sheffield Arena and The GE Oil & Gas Arena in Aberdeen.\n\nThe visit to Sheffield includes the meeting between rivals van Gerwen and Taylor, as well as clashes between Wright and Lewis, van Barneveld and Chisnall and Wade and Anderson.\n\nThe final league night in Aberdeen features the rematch of the recent PDC World Championship final between van Gerwen and Anderson, while Wright faces van Barneveld, Taylor and Lewis clash and Chisnall plays Wade.\n\nFollowing the final league night in Aberdeen, the top four players in the league table will qualify to compete in the play-offs at The O2 in London on May 18.\n\nBetway Premier League\n\nNight Ten – Thursday April 6\n\n3Arena, Dublin\n\nJames Wade v Michael van Gerwen\n\nRaymond van Barneveld v Phil

Wade 7-2 in Cardiff last night, where Michael van Gerwen, Gary Anderson and Phil Taylor also picked up victories.\n\nVan Barneveld, the 2014 Premier League champion, has climbed into the top four with his recent run of form, beating the world’s top two players van Gerwen and Anderson, and he continued that with a ruthless display against Wade.\n\nThe Dutchman limited Wade to just one dart at a double as he won the opening five legs without reply, before the 2009 Premier League champion finished 36 and 70 to take two of the next three.\n\nHowever, van Barneveld, who had claimed his sixth leg with an excellent 12-darter, took the ninth on double seven to secure another two points in his bid to secure a spot in the play-offs.\n\n“That’s four wins on the trot so I’m very happy,” said van Barneveld. “It’s so tight in the league table so I had to focus and you have to play well against everyone.\n\n“James didn’t play as well as he could and I was surprised at that but I’m happy with the win.”\n\nReigning Premier League champion van Gerwen moved back to the top of the table with an impressive 7-1 win over Dave Chisnall, averaging 104.25 and hitting 50 per cent of his darts at a double.\n\nThe world number one had lost his first game of the season last week against van Barneveld, but returned to winning ways as he defied five 180s from Chisnall with a dominant display.\n\n“I had to play well tonight and I’m happy that I did,” said van Gerwen. “The pressure was on me because I want to be back on top of the table where I belong and where I’ve worked hard for.\n\n“When you lose a game, like last week, you’re upset but tonight I enjoyed it again. I’m a happy man and I’m already looking forward to next week.”\n\nTwo-time Premier League winner Anderson fired in finishes of 143 and 170 in a superb 7-3 win over Adrian Lewis, averaging 107 as he came from 2-1 down to clinch his third win in four games.\n\n“I didn’t think the performance was as good as the average, but I’ll take it!” said Anderson. “There was some good scores and some bad scores – the 170 felt like it came from nowhere and I took out the 143 too.\n\n“We all want to get into the play-offs. When the tournament starts you don’t want to be in the bottom two, and once you get past tonight it’s a fight for the top four and everyone’s trying for it.”\n\nSix-time Premier League champion Taylor also had to come from behind before he saw off Jelle Klaasen 7-5 in a deciding leg.\n\nKlaasen – who had been eliminated before his ninth league match – raced into an early 4-1 lead, before Taylor, aided by an 11-darter, turned the match around to claim his second win on the spin.\n\n“It’s another two points for me and they could all prove crucial at the end of the season,” said Taylor. “It could prove the difference for getting into the play-offs – if I’d lost I think I’d have struggled to qualify.\n\n“I think Jelle’s injury affected him, at the beginning he was fairing well but during the game he was struggling and he wasn’t the same player. Fair play to him, it must be very frustrating but he’s battled on.”\n\nThe night had seen just eight players in action, with Kim Huybrechts – who had already been eliminated – absent to remain in Belgium with his terminally ill mother, meaning that Peter Wright was awarded a 7-0 victory in his intended opponent’s absence.\n\n“All our thoughts are with Kim and his family,” said Wright, who made an appearance on stage in front of the sell-out Cardiff crowd before the event and signed autographs for the fans.\n\n“You have a fantastic crowd in Cardiff, the atmosphere is amazing and I’m gutted that I’m not playing. I was looking forward to trying to win tonight but unfortunately I’ve got to get back on the practice board.”\n\nThe Premier League continues with the visit to Dublin’s 3Arena next Thursday, as the second phase of the season begins with five games.\n\nBetway Premier League\n\nNight Nine – Thursday March 30\n\nMotorpoint Arena, Cardiff\n\nPhil Taylor 7-5 Jelle Klaasen\n\nGary Anderson 7-3 Adrian Lewis\n\nRaymond van Barneveld 7-2 James Wade\n\nMichael van Gerwen 7-1 Dave Chisnall\n\nNB: Peter Wright awarded 7-0 win following Kim Huybrechts’ withdrawal.\n\nLeague Table\n\nAs of March 30 2017 P W D L +/- LWAT Pts Michael van Gerwen 9 6 2 1 +19 21 14 Peter Wright 9 6 1 2 +16 16 13 Raymond van Barneveld 9 5 2 2 +8 18 12 Gary Anderson 9 4 3 2 +10 12 11 Phil Taylor 9 4 3 2 +5 20 11 Adrian Lewis 9 4 1 4 0 18 9 James Wade 9 3 2 4 -3 16 8 Dave Chisnall 9 3 0 6 -16 12 6 Jelle Klaasen (E) 9 1 1 7 -16 15 3 Kim Huybrechts (E) 9 0 3 6 -23 11 3\n\nFollow @dartsweekly\n\nBy Alex Moss\n\n30 MARCH 2017 • 1:34PM\n\nMichael van Gerwen is hoping he can get back to winning ways in the Betway Premier League in Cardiff tonight.\n\nThe reigning Premier League champion saw his unbeaten record this season ended by Raymond van Barneveld in Manchester last week.\n\nVan Gerwen takes on Dave Chisnall at the Motorpoint Arena this evening and will need a victory to return to the top of the table.\n\n“It was disappointing to lose to Raymond but that game’s gone now and I have to prepare myself properly for this week,” said the world number one.\n\n“It’s close between everyone (in the table) so you can’t afford any more mistakes.\n\n“Dave’s a brilliant player and he’s one of the biggest scorers in the game, so I know I’ve got to be on form.”\n\nVan Gerwen dropped to second place in the table this morning after it was announced Peter Wright had been awarded a 7-0 win in his scheduled game tonight against Kim Huybrechts, after the Belgian withdrew from the match due to family reasons.\n\nThe revised order of play for tonight’s Betway Premier League will now be as follows:\n\nBetway Premier League\n\nWeek Nine – Thursday March 30\n\nMotorpoint Arena, Cardiff\n\nPhil Taylor v Jelle Klaasen\n\nGary Anderson v Adrian Lewis\n\nRaymond van Barneveld v James Wade\n\nMichael van Gerwen v Dave Chisnall\n\n(all matches are the best of 12 legs)\n\nFollow @dartsweekly"
