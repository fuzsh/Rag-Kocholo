        "text": "Scotland’s Gary Anderson and Robert Thornton survived a huge scare to see off New Zealand, while Australia ended host nation Germany’s challenge in an entertaining first day of the World Cup of Darts in Frankfurt.\n\nAnderson and Thornton rattled off four legs in succession to come back from 3-1 down to see off New Zealand 5-3. A brilliant 125 checkout from the impressive Cody Harris broke the Scottish throw in the first leg but they were quickly pegged back when Thornton pinned Double two. Nonetheless New Zealand broke again on Double 16, and opened up a two leg lead when Harris hit the same target in the next leg.\n\nHowever, Scotland showed their fighting spirit as Thornton sensationally took out 124 on the bull, before Anderson levelled proceedings with a superb 95 checkout. Thornton took out Double 18 to put the Scots in the lead for the first time before Anderson sealed a hard fought win on Double 12 after a brilliant 177 setup shot from The Thorn.\n\nAustralia’s Simon Whitlock and Kyle Anderson silenced the partisan Frankfurt crowd as they beat hosts Germany 5-3. The first four legs of the match went with throw until Jyhan Artut missed big one going to check out nine, and was punished by Whitlock on Double 10 to move the Aussies 3-2 ahead. Another two holds of throw followed before Artut missed one dart to keep Germany alive and Anderson nailed Double 10 to seal the win.\n\nTournament favourites Holland are safely through to the last 16 despite a below par performance. World number one Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld could only muster a 82.52 average but still had enough to see off the Russian pair of Boris Koltsov and Aleksandr Oreshkin, 5-3.\n\n2013 World Cup finalists, Belgium, began their 2016 charge in fine fashion as they dismantled Poland in a 5-1 win. Represented by Kim and Ronny Huybrechts, it was Kim who landed the early blow with an 85 checkout on the bull to break the throw for a 2-0 lead. The Poles never really recovered and the Belgians breezed through to the last 16, with Kim pinning Double 10 to seal the win.\n\nThere was a big shock earlier in the evening as the USA Pair of Larry Butler and Darin Young were dumped out 5-3 by the Philippines. Butler who is a recent World Masters finalist and former World Matchplay Champion, looked out of sorts throughout the match, which was evident in their lowly 10% checkout percentage rate. Meanwhile it was a completely different story for the Danish pair of Per Laursen and Daniel Larsson impressively took out 100% of their doubles in a 5-2 win over rivals Sweden.\n\nElsewhere, Hungary won through a nervy first round encounter against Thailand, with Nandor Bezzeg nailing Double 10 for a 5-3 win, while Norway breezed to a 5-2 win over Gibraltar.\n\nBetway World Cup of Darts\n\nThursday June 2\n\nFirst Round\n\nHungary 5-3 Thailand\n\nUSA 3-5 Philippines\n\nNorway 5-2 Gibraltar\n\nDenmark 5-2 Sweden\n\n(7) Belgium 5-1 Poland\n\n(3) Scotland 5-3 New Zealand\n\n(2) Netherlands 5-3 Russia\n\n(6) Australia 5-3 Germany\n\nBest of nine legs Doubles\n\nFriday June 3 (7pm BST)\n\nFirst Round\n\nCzech Republic v China\n\nGreece v Canada\n\nRepublic of Ireland v Hong Kong\n\nSouth Africa v Singapore\n\n(4) Northern Ireland v Japan\n\n(5) Wales v Finland\n\n(1) England v Spain\n\n(8) Austria v Italy\n\nLast 16 Draw (Bottom Half)\n\n(2) Holland v Philippines\n\n(7) Belgium v Hungary\n\n(3) Scotland v Norway\n\n(6) Australia v Denmark\n\nThe sixth edition of the PDC World Cup of Darts rolls into town on Thursday with a pair of players from 32 nations gunning for a share of the £50,000 first prize. Here, Total Eclipse of the Dart outlines all you need to know ahead of the latest edition of the showpiece pairs event.\n\nWHERE?\n\nThe World Cup returns to Frankfurt for a second successive year as the Eissporthalle plays host to a number of the darting elite. It is the third different venue to house the competition after the Rainton Meadows Arena in County Durham and the Alsterdorfe Sporthalle in Hamburg.\n\nThe venue has been open for 25 years, holding just under 7,000 people and is primarily used as the home of German Ice Hockey outfit Frankfurt Lions, but the ice rink will be replaced by the oche this weekend for 31 games of sheer tungsten drama.\n\nWHEN?\n\nThe competition kicks off on Thursday evening at 7pm British Summer Time and will last for a duration of four days concluding on Sunday evening.\n\nThe 16 first round ties are spread across two sessions on Thursday and Friday evening, before the eight last 16 ties take place on Saturday across an afternoon and evening session.\n\nSunday will see the culmination of the tournament with the quarter-finals taking place in the afternoon session before the semi-finals and final on Sunday evening bring a close to the competition.\n\nTHE DEFENDING CHAMPIONS\n\nEngland\n\nThe English pair of Phil Taylor and Adrian Lewis will look to defend their title, as they set their sights on a fourth World Cup crown. It’ll be their fifth consecutive World Cup as a pair, and they share a strong rapport, with Taylor having played a mentoring role in the formation stages of Lewis’ career.\n\nTheir World Cup record is formidable, reaching at least the final every year they have played together, losing only once to the Dutch pair of Michael van Gerwen and Raymond van Barneveld in the 2014 final.\n\nThe Stoke pair look a safe bet of reaching at least the final again, with a favourable run to the final, and you wouldn’t back against them winning yet another World Cup title.\n\nTHE CONTENDERS\n\nNetherlands\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Holland’s number two player Jelle Klaasen due to ‘personal reasons’ the pair of van Gerwen and van Barneveld return for a fourth successive year.\n\nThe 2014 champions head into the competition as the bookies favourites, and it is mainly down to the form of World Number One Michael van Gerwen. ‘Mighty Mike’ has won he Masters, UK Open and the Premier League already in 2016, and has won ten tournaments in total in the first five months of the season.\n\nBarney on the other hand has been very inactive this year aside from the Premier League, and if the Dutch fail to reach at least the final, this could be a deciding factor. However, if Barney can reach the performance level which saw him beat his partner en route to the semi-finals of the World Championship then it is highly likely that the Netherlands will add a third World Cup title to their collection.\n\nScotland\n\nNumber three seeds Scotland – led by World Champion Gary Anderson – are also considered a major threat in the tournament having narrowly lost out to England in last year’s final.\n\nHowever like the Dutch they were hit with the departure of their number two, as World number five Peter Wright pulled out of the competition due to ‘personal reasons’. His replacement – World Grand Prix Champion Robert Thornton – has had a slow start to 2016 but on his day is capable of beating any player in the world.\n\nThe Scots are undoubtedly hindered by ‘Snakebite’s’ departure, but Anderson and Thornton had partnered each other in the first four editions of the tournament, so know each other’s game well. Marked at a best priced 5/1, they could be a worthwhile outside bet to win the tournament.\n\nTHE DARK HORSES\n\nWales\n\nThe Welsh are one of three nations to welcome a debutant into their pair, with ‘Iceman’ Gerwyn Price joining the ever-present Mark Webster in their pursuit of glory.\n\nPrice is one of the most in-form players on the circuit winning two Players Championship titles in May which saw him rocket to number 27 in the world. In only his third year in the circuit Price is ever improving, and has form on the stage having reached the quarter-finals of last year’s World Matchplay.\n\nWebster himself has enjoyed a resurgence in the last 18 months reaching the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and the quarter-finals of the Grand Slam of Darts last year. ‘Webby’ has reached the final of the World Cup before in 2010 when he and Barrie Bates lost out to the Netherlands, and given the draw they are a strong bet to reach at least the semi-finals\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nThe fourth seeds are projected by the rankings to reach at least the semi-finals, and like Wales boast an in-form new addition in the exciting Daryl Gurney.\n\nGurney ended 2015 with a run to the semi-finals of the Players Championship finals and has kicked off this year impressively by losing out to van Gerwen in the final of the Dutch Darts Masters.\n\nHe joins World number 20, Brendan Dolan, who reached the semi-finals of the World Cup in 2014 alongside Mickey Mansell. His experience mixed in with Gurney’s high-scoring could see the Northern Irish have a run this weekend.\n\nAustralia\n\nAnother nation with a newcomer, as Kyle Anderson joins experienced campaigner Simon Whitlock. ‘The Original’ is a huge scorer, who recorded an unofficial world record average of 134 on the Pro Tour against Terry Jenkins.\n\nHe replaces Paul Nicholson who alongside Whitlock played in arguably the most exciting World Cup final against England in 2012. However he has lost his form in the last couple of years, and the fresh blood of Anderson could bring the best out of Whitlock, and they could surprise the Scots in their projected quarter-final.\n\nBelgium\n\nKim and Ronny Huybrechts return for the Belgian charge, as they look to go one better than their run to the 2013 final.\n\nSemi-finalists last year, form seems to go out of the window when the pair play together and their brotherly bond has often won them games against the odds in previous years.\n\nHowever a projected quarter-final against the Dutch beckons and it would take something special from the pair to advance further than that stage.\n\nAustria\n\nThe eighth seeds boast one of the tour’s most in form players in Mensur Suljovic alongside former World Youth Championship runner-up, Rowby-John Rodriguez.\n\nSuljovic is considered one of the most awkward opponents on the tour, and is capable of producing special averages. Meanwhile Rodriguez has proven he can beat some of the game’s top players on the tour, so they can’t be written off.\n\nHowever, like Belgium, they have a tough run, with a projected quarter-final tie against defending champions England, and it is difficult to see them advancing beyond the last eight.\n\nTHE REST OF THE TEAMS\n\nCanada – John Part & Ken MacNeil\n\nChina – Yuanjun Liu & Wenge Xie\n\nCzech Republic – Michal Kocik & Pavel Drtil\n\nDenmark – Per Laursen & Daniel Jensen\n\nFinland – Kim Viljanen & Marko Kantele\n\nGermany – Max Hopp & Jyhan Artut\n\nGibraltar – Dyson Parody & Manuel Vilerio\n\nGreece – John Michael & Ioannis Selachoglou\n\nHong Kong – Ting Chi Royden Lam & Scott MacKenzie\n\nHungary – Nandor Bezzeg & Patrik Kovacs\n\nItaly – Daniele Petri & Michel Furlanis\n\nJapan – Keita Ono & Haruki Muramatsu\n\nNew Zealand – Warren Parry & Cody Harris\n\nNorway – Robert Wagner & Cor Dekker\n\nPhilippines – Gilbert Ulang & Alex Tagarao\n\nPoland – Krzysztof Ratajski & Mariusz Paul\n\nRepublic of Ireland – William O’Connor & Mick McGowan\n\nRussia – Aleksandr Oreshkin & Boris Koltsov\n\nSingapore – Paul Lim & Harith Lim\n\nSouth Africa – Devon Petersen & Graham Filby\n\nSpain – Cristo Reyes & Antonio Alcinas\n\nSweden – Magnus Caris & Daniel Larsson\n\nThailand – Thanawat Gaweenuntawong & Attapol Eupakaree\n\nUSA – Darin Young & Larry Butler\n\nSCHEDULE\n\nThursday June 2 (7pm BST)\n\nFirst Round x8\n\nHungary v Thailand\n\nUSA v Philippines\n\nNorway v Gibraltar\n\nDenmark v Sweden\n\nBelgium v Poland\n\nScotland v New Zealand\n\nNetherlands v Russia\n\nAustralia v Germany\n\nFriday June 3 (7pm BST)\n\nFirst Round x8\n\nCzech Republic v China\n\nGreece v Canada\n\nRepublic of Ireland v Hong Kong\n\nSouth Africa v Singapore\n\nNorthern Ireland v Japan\n\nWales v Finland\n\nEngland v Spain\n\nAustria v Italy\n\nSaturday June 4\n\nAfternoon Session (1pm BST)\n\nSecond Round x4\n\nBelgium/Poland v Hungary/Thailand\n\nNorthern Ireland/Japan v Republic of Ireland/Hong Kong\n\nWales/Finland v Greece/Canada\n\nAustria/Italy v South Africa/Singapore\n\nEvening Session (7pm BST)\n\nSecond Round x4\n\nScotland/New Zealand v Norway/Gibraltar\n\nAustralia/Germany v Denmark/Sweden\n\nEngland/Spain v Czech Republic/China\n\nNetherlands/Russia v USA/Philippines\n\nSunday June 5\n\nAfternoon Session (1pm BST)\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nOrder of Play TBC\n\nEvening Session (7pm BST)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nFinal\n\nFormat\n\nFirst Round\n\nBest of nine legs Doubles\n\nSecond Round, Quarter-Finals & Semi-Finals\n\nThe Second Round, Quarter-Finals & Semi-Finals will be played as two best of seven leg 501 Singles matches, with both nations nominating the order in which their players play. In the event of both nations winning one Singles match apiece, a best of seven leg 501 Doubles match will be played to decide the tie.\n\nFinal\n\nThe Final will be played as two best of seven leg 501 Singles matches, with both nations nominating the order in which their players play the first two matches, followed by a best of seven leg 501 Doubles match and then Reverse Singles matches. The first team to win three games is declared the winner.\n\nPrize Fund\n\nWinning Team: £25,000 per player\n\nRunners-Up: £13,000 per player\n\nSemi-Finalists: £7,500 per player\n\nQuarter-Finalists: £5,000 per player\n\nRound Two Losers: £3,500 per player\n\nRound One Losers: £1,500 per player\n\nTotal Prize Fund: £250,000\n\n2015 World Youth Championship runner up, Nathan Aspinall insists the disappointment of missing out on the World Championships at the final hurdle will spur him onto success in 2016.\n\nThe Stockport thrower, missed one dart at double 16 to seal a 6-5 win over Max Hopp in November’s youth final in Minehead, which not only would have seen him crowned World Youth Champion, but would have sealed a place in his first ever PDC World Championship.\n\nInstead it was Hopp who walked away with the title as well as the £10,000 prize money and Aspinall admits missing out on the title and a spot in the World Championships hurt, but it has made him even more determined to qualify next year.\n\n“I was gutted,” explained Aspinall.\n\n“I really needed to win the game not only to become (World Youth) champion but to get into the World Championships which would have been a dream come true.\n\n“I felt like I should have made the worlds, but it wasn’t to be. I know I’ve got the game I just now need to put it together on the Pro Tour next year and I will qualify.”\n\n2015 was Aspinall’s first full year on the senior circuit having won a two year Tour Card at the 2015 Q School. The 24-year-old reached the last 16 of the Dutch Darts Masters as well as reaching the last 32 of the UK Open finals where he was beaten by 8-time major champion, James Wade.\n\nWhile he admits he is content with how his first year on the circuit unfold, Aspinall insists there is still plenty of room for improvement.\n\n“Overall it’s been a good first year for me,” added Aspinall.\n\n“I have done very well on the youth tour, winning one event and getting to two finals and a semi-final, before losing in the World Youth final against Max.\n\n“The Pro Tour has been up and down. I have had a couple of good runs, like you said, in the UK Open and also the Dutch Masters but I feel there is much more I can do on the floor events.”\n\nAspinall also did very well on his final year on the Youth Tour circuit, and he was full of praise for the experience and how it prepares players for making the step up into the senior circuit.\n\n“The Youth Tour has been massive for me. I’ve played on it for two years now and the experience you gain is brilliant.\n\n“They are run like no other competition you will play in, as the quality of player is exceptional, so it has helped me a lot in terms of playing on the main tour.\n\n“I would advise any youngster who wants to be a dart player to go to the youth tour as it will help them a lot.”\n\nThe youngster has also gained a lot of important experience within the County set up, having played for both Lancashire and Cheshire. Ran through the BDO, county games are often played on stage in front of reasonable crowds and on a stage, and Aspinall credits his grounding in the county game, with being able to handle the pressure of playing on the TV stage.\n\n“It’s brilliant the county days. I played both youth and seniors for Lancashire before moving over to Cheshire last year.\n\n“Playing on the stage has helped me a lot since joining the PDC as it is so different playing the floor events and I think I definitely would have struggled in my first PDC game on a stage if I’d not done counties first.”\n\nLooking ahead to 2016, Aspinall enters the final year of his current tour card, knowing h needs to break into the top 64 of the World rankings in order to avoid going to Q School.\n\nHis run to the World Youth Championship final should guarantee him entry into the Grand Slam of Darts, provided the current qualifying criteria not change, and he admits, qualifying for TV tournaments and more European Tour events is his main aim in 2016.\n\n“It’s a big year for me. I’m too old for the youth tour now so I can concentrate purely on the pro tour.\n\n“My main target is to get into the top 64 of the World rankings and also to compete in at least half of the European Tour events.\n\n“I think I’m already in the Grand Slam next year which is televised but if I could get into anymore TV events that would be great, and of course I’m getting to the Ally Pally this year – I’m not missing out twice.”"
