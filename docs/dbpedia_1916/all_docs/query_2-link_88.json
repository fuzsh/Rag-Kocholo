        "text": "NINE-DART hero Michael Smith and emerging star Ricky Evans will contest the PDC Unicorn World Youth Championship Final in May after winning through the £40,000 tournament’s early rounds in Barnsley on Friday night.\n\nThe tournament, featuring players who competed on last year’s PDC Unicorn Youth Tour and a series of International Qualifiers, saw Smith joined in hitting a perfect leg by Kurt Parry.\n\nSmith went on to win through to May’s final, which will be played during the McCoy’s Premier League Darts Play-Offs at The O2 in London, by showing some incredible form in winning five matches on Friday night.\n\nThe 22-year-old from St Helens dropped just one leg as he defeated Brandon Walsh, George Killington, Samuel Head and Dean Finn to reach the semi-finals – hitting a nine-darter in the opening leg of his last 16 game with Head.\n\nSmith then defeated County Durham’s Adam Hunt 6-3 to win through to the final with another fine performance – which comes only a week after he had reached the final of a Speedy Services UK Open Qualifier on the senior circuit.\n\n“I’ve been practising so well for the last few months and, since Christmas, I’ve put in an amazing amount of work so it’s great to see it paying off,” said Smith.\n\n“I’m confident that I can keep this form going now and I’m really going to look forward to the final. I was shaking like a leaf in the semi-finals and it was brilliant to win it.”\n\nKettering’s Evans, meanwhile, won through to face Smith at The O2 by defeating 2011 World Youth Champion Arron Monk 6-3 in their semi-final.\n\nEvans defeated Canada’s Shaun Narain in the first round and then saw off Australian youngster Harley Kemp before overcoming Chris Aubrey, Sam Hamilton and Monk.\n\nThe 22-year-old, a winner on the PDC Unicorn Youth Tour in 2011, has only ever competed on television once before, at the 2010 UK Open, but will compete in front of 10,000 fans in May when he competes for the World Youth Championship title.\n\nEvans had turned professional in January when he won a PDC Tour Card at Qualifying School, and admitted: “Ever since Q School I’ve been on a high and this is something I’ve really wanted.\n\n“I’m enjoying my darts so much at the moment. It’s a big step up for me and it will be the biggest crowd I’ve played in front of by miles, but it’s going to be an exciting two months waiting for the day to arrive!”\n\nThe pair will also now qualify for November’s William Hill Grand Slam of Darts, and are assured of a PDC Tour Card for 2014 and 2015, although both are currently Tour Card Holders.\n\nSmith’s achievement in hitting a nine-dart finish came only minutes after 19-year-old Welshman Kurt Parry had hit a perfect leg during his second round win over Josh Jones.\n\nReigning champion James Hubbard was a first round casualty as he went down 6-4 to Matthew Dicken, while fellow seeds Jamie Lewis and Keegan Brown also lost at that stage, to Brandon Monk and Reece Robinson respectively.\n\nAustralian teenagers Harley Kemp and Jackson Wilson-Young both reached the last 32 following their around-the-world trips, and emerging German ace Max Hopp made it through to the last 16 before losing out to Sam Hamilton.\n\nHamilton picked up £1,500 as a quarter-final loser alongside Dutchman Ryan De Vreede, Jake Patchett and Irish qualifier Dean Finn.\n\nPDC Unicorn World Youth Championship\n\nFirst Round\n\nArron Monk (1) 6-2 Curtis Bagley\n\nSergio Garcia 6-4 Curtis Hammond\n\nDirk van Duijvenbode 6-0 Lee Whitworth\n\nMichael Blake 6-3 Dan Lauby II\n\nSam Hill (8) 6-3 Jake Jones\n\nRyan De Vreede 6-2 Jamie Landon\n\nKurt Parry 6-1 Joe Davis\n\nJosh Jones 6-4 Matthew Dennant\n\nChris Aubrey (5) 6-4 Teemu Harju\n\nPaddy Meaney 6-1 Kai Gotthardt\n\nHarley Kemp 6-3 Shaun Griffiths\n\nRicky Evans 6-2 Shaun Narain\n\nBrandonn Monk 6-5 Jamie Lewis (4)\n\nSam Hamilton 6-4 Oisin Daly\n\nBen Songhurst 6-5 Adam Smith-Neale\n\nMax Hopp 6-4 Aden Kirk\n\nMichael Smith (2) 6-0 Brandon Walsh\n\nGeorge Killington 6-4 John Seagrave\n\nSam Head 6-1 James Thompson\n\nDarren Whittingham 6-1 Liam Showell\n\nJosh Payne (7) 6-3 Martin Heneghan\n\nDean Finn 6-3 Jack Hill\n\nSteve Haggerty 6-5 Sam Davidson\n\nLewis Venes 6-5 Harry Miles\n\nReece Robinson 6-1 Keegan Brown (6)\n\nRowby John Rodriguez 6-1 Ryan Harrington\n\nJackson Wilson-Young 6-3 Ricky De Vos\n\nJake Patchett 6-3 John De Kruijf\n\nMatthew Dicken 6-4 James Hubbard (3)\n\nWouter Vaes 6-0 Adam Hart\n\nAdam Hunt 6-4 Oliver Stell\n\nJosh McCarthy 6-3 Shane Friedlander\n\nLosers £100\n\nSecond Round\n\nArron Monk 6-2 Sergio Garcia\n\nDirk Van Duijvenbode 6-5 Michael Blake\n\nRyan De Vreede 6-4 Sam Hill\n\nKurt Parry 6-5 Josh Jones – Kurt Parry hits nine-dart finish\n\nChris Aubrey 6-5 Paddy Meaney\n\nRicky Evans 6-4 Harley Kemp\n\nSam Hamilton 6-4 Brandon Monk\n\nMax Hopp 6-4 Ben Songhurst\n\nMichael Smith 6-0 George Killington\n\nSamuel Head 6-3 Darren Whittingham\n\nDean Finn 6-5 Josh Payne\n\nSteve Haggerty 6-5 Lewis Venes\n\nReece Robinson 6-4 Rowby-John Rodriguez\n\nJake Patchett 6-2 Jackson Wilson-Young\n\nMatthew Dicken 6-4 Wouter Vaes\n\nAdam Hunt 6-1 Josh McCarthy\n\nLosers £250\n\nThird Round\n\nArron Monk 6-2 Dirk Van Duijvenbode\n\nRyan De Vreede 6-0 Kurt Parry\n\nRicky Evans 6-2 Chris Aubrey\n\nSam Hamilton 6-3 Max Hopp\n\nMichael Smith 6-1 Samuel Head – Michael Smith hits nine-dart finish\n\nDean Finn 6-5 Steve Haggerty\n\nJake Patchett 6-3 Reece Robinson\n\nAdam Hunt 6-4 Matthew Dicken\n\nLosers £725\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nArron Monk 6-3 Ryan De Vreede\n\nRicky Evans 6-5 Sam Hamilton\n\nMichael Smith 6-0 Dean Finn\n\nAdam Hunt 6-3 Jake Patchett\n\nLosers £1,500\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nRicky Evans 6-4 Arron Monk\n\nMichael Smith 6-3 Adam Hunt\n\nLosers £3,000\n\nFinal\n\nRicky Evans v Michael Smith\n\nTo be played at The O2 in London on Thursday May 16 during the McCoy’s Premier League Darts Play-Offs\n\nWinner £10,000\n\nRunner-Up £5,000\n\nPlus, finalists also receive invitation to 2013 William Hill Grand Slam of Darts, plus a PDC Tour Card for 2014 and 2015 with 2014 entries paid for."
