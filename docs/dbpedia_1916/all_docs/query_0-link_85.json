        "text": "Reigning champion Michael van Gerwen held his nerve to get through a last-leg decider against José de Sousa to reach the Quarter Finals of the UK Open in Milton Keynes.\n\nMVG was pushed all the way against De Sousa, but progresses to set up a last eight clash against Krzysztof Ratajski, who thrashed the in-form current Masters champion Jonny Clayton - the Welshman had reached three ProTour finals last weekend.\n\nGerwyn Price heads into the final day looking to add to his World Championship success, after beating Chris Dobey, and two-time UK Open winner James Wade is also through after beating Gabriel Clemens.\n\nDave Chisnall saw off Scottish newcomer Alan Soutar, while Simon Whitlock, Devon Petersen, and Luke Humphries make up the Quarter Final line-up.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nMVG looking for back-to-back UK Open titles\n\nVan Gerwen made light work of Austrian Mensur Suljović in the fifth round with a 10-4 victory, which saw him average 103.8, and the former world champion was pushed all the way against the current Grand Slam champion.\n\n‘The Special One’ kept within touching distance of MVG all the way, and forced a deciding leg, however, the current UK Open champion had the darts and powered home with some heavy scoring to edge through 10-9 against De Sousa.\n\nRatajski, who has won seven non-televised PDC events, stands between MVG and a place in the semi-finals on Sunday, after 'The Polish Eagle' produced ton-plus averages in his victories against Madars Razma in the Fifth Round and then Welshman Clayton in the Sixth.\n\nPrice aiming for first UK Open title\n\nWorld number one Price couldn’t have asked for much more from his two matches on Saturday, comfortably beating both Ricky Evans - a 10-3 victory in the afternoon - and then Dobey to reach the Quarter Finals.\n\nPrice headed into the first interval with a stunning 109 checkout, and it set the tone for the match, as the Welshman hit back-to-back 11-dart legs before going on to secure a 10-5 win with a 129 finish - averaging 102 in the game.\n\nNext up for Price will be a tough test against South African ace Petersen, who has reached the last eight of the UK Open for the first time in six years after beating both Scott Waites and Peter Jacques.\n\nPetersen, who won his first ranking event at the German Darts Championship last September, trailed 4-2 in the game, but a fantastic 121 checkout was the turning point as the South African went on to win eight consecutive legs.\n\nChisnall sets up Quarter Final against Humphries\n\nChisnall is another player in the Quarter Finals looking to secure a debut televised title, and heads into the final day having beaten Danny Noppert with a 104.4 average, and then Soutar, who was competing in his first UK Open tournament, 10-8 in the last 16.\n\nWorld number seven Chisnall will bid for a place in his first semi-final since 2012 against former World Youth Champion Luke Humphries, who reached the Quarter Finals of the UK Open for the first time.\n\nHumphries defeated Ryan Searle in the afternoon before going on to beat Dutch thrower Martijn Kleermaker in the last 16, sealing a fantastic victory by pinning a 108 checkout.\n\nTwo-time UK Open champion Wade come through against former world champion Rob Cross before defeating German number one Clemens. 'The Machine' was kept within arms length of Clemens at 6-5, but went on to win the last four legs to progress.\n\nAussie ace Whitlock will meet Wade in the Quarter Finals after coming through last-leg deciders in both of his games on Saturday. A 10-9 victory for the Aussie thrower over Darius Labanauskas was followed up with a nail-biting deciding leg against Brendan Dolan.\n\nUK Open - Quarter Final Draw\n\nSimon Whitlock vs James Wade\n\nGerwyn Price vs Devon Petersen\n\nDave Chisnall vs Luke Humphries\n\nKrzysztof Ratajski vs Michael van Gerwen"
