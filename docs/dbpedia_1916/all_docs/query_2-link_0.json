The 2 finalists will earn a spot in the Grand Slam of Darts, and the winner receives a spot in the next PDC World Championship.[2]\n\nThe inaugural final was won by Arron Monk, who defeated Michael van Gerwen on 3 January 2011.[3]\n\nAge limits[]\n\nThe first editions were open to players aged 14 to 21 on 1 January of the competition's year. In 2014, the minimum age was increased to 16 and in 2015, the maximum age was increased to 23. Thus instead of an Under-21 or Under-23 championship the general term 'youth' is usually used.\n\nFinal results[]\n\nYear Champion Score (legs) Runner-up Prize Fund Champion Runner-up Final Venue 2011 93.03 6–4 87.06 £30,000 £10,000 £5,000 Alexandra Palace 2012 95.18 6–3 92.29 The O2 Arena 2013 89.13 6–1 79.26 £40,000 2014 85.67 6–4 79.80 £50,000 2015 86.97 6–5 88.48 Butlin's Minehead 2016 98.35 6–2 86.92 2017 101.23 6–3 92.11 2018 100.04 6–3 91.60 £60,000 2019 92.97 6–0 78.42 2020 81.63 6–5 78.16 Ricoh Arena 2021 95.44 6–4 93.66 £45,000 Butlin's Minehead 2022 104.13 6–1 89.12 £60,000 2023 102.16 6–4 97.48"
