        "text": "Luke Littler’s sensational run at the PDC World Darts Championship concluded on Wednesday when he lost to new world No.1 Luke Humphries in the final at London’s Alexandra Palace.\n\nThe 16-year-old sensation has captured public imagination in the UK with his record-breaking run to the showpiece.\n\nLittler defeated 2018 champion Rob Cross 6-2 in Tuesday’s semifinal, the second former winner he had taken down after a 4-1 win over five-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld.\n\nThe incredible run started with a 3-0 round-one victory against Christian Kist, where Littler became the youngest player to win a match at the World Championship.\n\nAndrew Gilding and Matt Campbell were similarly dispatched and Littler beat Brendan Dolan 5-1 in the quarterfinals to set up his showdown with Cross.\n\nMORE: World Darts Championship 2023/24 full tournament results, draw, schedule after holder Michael Smith is ousted\n\nAnother sparkling performance yielded an exceptional average of 106.05, the fourth time in the tournament he has averaged more than 100. For context, the in-form Humphries had not averaged above 100 in any match before racking up 108.74 in his 6-0 semifinal demolition of Scott Williams.\n\n\"I've seen the way he's played many, many times. When you come on this stage it can be a lot tougher but he's just proved that he's got a lot of bottle,” Humphries said of Littler ahead of their showdown, which he won 7-4.\n\n\"Nothing is going to faze him. I'm probably going to have to play the game of my life. I've got an uphill task and hopefully we can give the people one of the best world finals ever seen.\"\n\nLuke Littler prize money, world ranking\n\nLittler came into the World Championship ranked joint 164th in the world. His remarkable progress at Ally Pally has catapulted him far higher.\n\nThe teenager went into his semifinal with a provisional ranking of 50 and could rise as high as ninth if he beats Humphries to seal glory.\n\nLittler’s run to the final has earned him £200,000. Success in the final would boost that prize pot to £500,000.\n\nWho is the youngest world champion in darts?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Littler would become the youngest world champion in history if he lifts the trophy and by some distance.\n\nThat distinction belongs to Michael van Gerwen, who was 24 and nine months old when he won the first of his three world titles in 2014.\n\nSo Littler has the best part of a decade to usurp Van Gerwen, even if Humphries succeeds, and he is already the youngest player to reach the final.\n\nPreviously this was Kirk Shepherd, who was 21 years and 88 days when he lost to John Part in 2008.\n\nLuke Littler career record\n\nPrior to his run in London, Littler had only played four senior matches at PDC premier events.\n\nAll of those were at the UK Open, which he qualified for on his 16th birthday in January 2023. He reached the fourth round before losing to 21-year-old Czech player Adam Gawlas.\n\nLittler had already carved out a considerable reputation at age-group level by that point, winning the PDC Worth Youth Championship in 2023.\n\nAged just 14, he hit a nine-darter at the Junior Darts Corporation Masters Tournament. He has also won 12 adult titles away from the elite level.\n\nLittler’s progression into the upper reaches of the world rankings means he is set to earn a one-year professional tour card for 2024.\n\nHe could even step up to compete alongside the creme de la creme in the Premier League Darts. However, even though Littler has left little doubt over his capabilities, the gruelling workload of darts’ top-tier competition might be a bridge too far at his young age.\n\n\"I've seen what the Premier League does [for your profile],\" he said, as quoted by BBC Sport.\n\n\"You have Monday, Tuesday pro tours, and then Wednesday is the Euro qualifiers and you've got the Premier League. The weekend is the Euro Tour.\n\n\"I think the PDC are going to keep me out of it because that will just be gruelling like everyone has said.\"\n\nWhat does Luke Littler eat?\n\nIt’s not just Littler’s prowess at the oche that has endeared him to the wider public. Although the best darts players have seldom followed an Olympian’s diet, Littler's pre-match nutrition routine has certainly enhanced his cult-hero status.\n\n\"I'll be doing what I've been doing,” he told Sky Sports when discussing his preparation for the final. “In the morning I'll go for my ham and cheese omelette and then come here, have a pizza and then prep on the board. That is what I've done every day.\"\n\nThe pressure cooker of competition means Littler still has the appetite for more afterwards. A London kebab house offered him free meals for life after he said he celebrated the win over Gulding with “a kebab and a can of Tango”.\n\nOverall, he is a man of simple pleasures. \"[I] just wake up, play on my Xbox, have some food and have a chuck on the board, go to bed and that's it,\" he said.\n\nThis hasn’t stopped stars including Premier League footballers courting Litter. Tottenham Hotspur and England playmaker James Maddison invited the youngster to his box to watch Spurs’ 3-1 win over Bournemouth on New Year’s Eve.\n\nHe was also photographed with Arsenal pair Declan Rice and Aaron Ramsdale on the day of their 2-0 defeat to West Ham United on December 28.\n\nBut Littler’s loyalties as a fan lie with Manchester United. He has mimicked Marcus Rashford’s famous celebration on stage during the World Championship and has been wished luck on social media by Old Trafford greats Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville.\n\nUnited's official Instagram account also responded to Littler's pre-final post, commenting: \"We're right behind you Luke\"."
