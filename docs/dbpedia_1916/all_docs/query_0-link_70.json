        "text": "He leaves still with the small matter of £200,000 to put towards the driving lessons that will begin later this month and seven years to become the youngest ever darts world champion.\n\n‘Bigger than the Ashes and the Ryder Cup’\n\n“It’s been the best story that has ever come out of this sport,” declared Mark Webster, the 2008 champion in the rival BDO series of darts. Eddie Hearn, chairman of the Matchroom company that owns the PDC, had earlier seized on the release of remarkable Sky Sports viewing figures which had shown that Littler’s semi-final win the previous night against Rob Cross was the most watched match in PDC history and up alongside live Premier League matches. “Bigger than the Ashes, bigger than the Ryder Cup,” declared Hearn.\n\nArguably the most eagerly awaited match in darts history certainly prompted some unlikely sights. Merging in with all the novelty fancy dress were Romeo Beckham, James Maddison, half-and-half Littler v Humphries scarves, and bemused television crews from Germany, China and just about everywhere in between.\n\nThey were also poised in the north west, whether at the St Helens darts academy where Littler learnt his trade, his ‘Bogey Flickers’ darts team-mates in Runcorn where a kebab has been named in his honour, or simply the front room of his grandparents’ nearby home.\n\nPhil and Carol Littler had decided against making the journey down to Ally Pally after discovering that the going rate for nearby hotel rooms had reached £600. Tickets were also changing hands for double that, with Phil and Carol happy simply to tune into Sky Sports and reminisce about the day they called in on an 18-month Littler in a nappy and saw him trying to emulate Phil Taylor on a magnetic board.\n\nTheir boy has approached the entire tournament with pretty much the same fearless gusto and was first out into the arena, grinning and raising his eyebrows when his age – HE’S JUST 16!! – was announced to a raucous ovation.\n\nHumphries followed, taking an age both to greet his large entourage and leave Littler waiting, before sensibly ignoring a slight splattering of boos and geeing up the crowd himself.\n\nSee-saw final begins\n\nIt was Humphries, fresh from the experience of winning a recent hat-trick of big televised finals, who settled fastest. A break of throw in the third leg helped him coast to the opening set, with Littler muttering to himself and uncharacteristically wayward in his pursuit of treble 20.\n\nLittler stayed out on stage during the break, interacting with the crowd while trying to find his range, before he reeled off finishes of 142 and then 120 to draw level with consecutive 12-dart finishes.\n\nIt was a breathless reminder of Littler’s most exciting quality of all: an ability to raise his level in direct proportion to the importance of a particular moment. A message had also been sent that he has the speed of throw and quality of finishing to transform any match in seconds.\n\nLike two young prize-fighters who could not be bothered to use a jab, a toe-to-toe slugfest ensued with only fleeting signs of either player wilting. Humphries, methodical and deliberate, was metronomic while Littler was more erratic, occasionally again faltering before sudden bursts of inspiration. Littler’s superior finishing was sufficient to then surge into a 4-2 lead and the big grin, coupled with a continued preference for staying out on the stage even during the break, suggested that he was now beginning to relish the occasion.\n\nHumphries punished Littler’s mistakes\n\nA sense that Humphries was now struggling - compounded when he somehow knocked out a dart that was already nestled in treble 20 - proved utterly deceiving.\n\nLuke Littler said he rued his missed opportunities but said his progress has “been unbelievable” and he sees no reason why he cannot eventually get his hands on the title. “If I can win five or six games like I’ve done here, there’s no reason why I can’t come back and win seven,” he said.\n\nWhen asked whether other players should be afraid of his future dominance, he said: “If they want to be scared, they can be scared.”\n\n“It’s been a rollercoaster these past few weeks,” Littler added. “No one likes losing but I can’t be angry at myself. To lose on that stage I was only disappointed that I lost a leg on my throw.”\n\nDebutant Littler’s journey to the biggest stage in his sport over the past fortnight had become one of the country’s biggest talking points. Multi-million audiences have tuned in to coverage and a frenzy of interest in tickets for the final saw resale prices soar beyond £1,000.\n\n“Littlermania” in recent weeks has also helped the sport secure bigger TV audiences than Premier League football over Christmas. Sky Sports viewing figures peaked at 2.3million at the semi-final stage – and were expected to be even higher for the final.\n\nIt has been dream timing for the PDC as it aims to secure a bumper new TV deal, with its current agreement with Sky expiring in 2025. A host of MPs had asked Sky to make the final free-to-air in a bid to capitalise on the huge national interest but terrestrial broadcasters failed to make any request due to potential last-minute scheduling chaos.\n\nThe next big event is Premier League Darts, a weekly competition around the country involving only eight elite players that begins on Feb 1 in Cardiff and continues for 17 weeks until the grand finale at London’s O2 arena in May.\n\n“People will say, ‘You’ve got to put him in the Premier League’, I’m thinking, ‘I can’t really put him in the Premier League, traveling around, you’ve got all the rules about minors’,” Barry Hearn, whose Matchroom company runs elite darts, told Telegraph Sport.\n\n“But then you think, ‘If he goes and wins I’m going to have put him there’. It’s made for the World Series where we take darts to far flung countries. Suddenly you can imagine him in New York and Madison Square Gardens throwing darts - the Yanks will go absolutely potty. Everyone loves a story like this.”\n\nAs it happened, below"
