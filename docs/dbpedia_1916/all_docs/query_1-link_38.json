Further with divisions playing different formats results, in many players having a distinct disadvantage over others in the possible games they are able to attend, due to these issues, which England Darts has no input into.\n\nAll the 12 months players criteria are updated on the basis of points achieved, so an in depth analysis of this criteria will have to be addressed for the final selection for 2024.\n\nIn 2024, the Teams will be attending the British Internationals in Scotland, The 6 Nations International Championships in Republic of Ireland, and the Europe Cup in Slovakia along with the Youth attending the Europe Cup Youth Championships in Latvia.\n\nThe 2023 squads had unprecedented successes, winning Men’s Ladies, Girls and Boys in the British Internationals, winning the Youth Europe Cup in Austria, our Ladies won the 6 Nations in Northern Ireland, and the icing on the cake was our squads won more Gold medals at the World Cup in Denmark than the whole of the other 50 countries combined.\n\nPlease be aware the statistics are documented on a monthly basis from players from England Member Counties and players who are currently fully paid up members of the England Darts Organisation only. If players feel they would like to be considered they should become members via the England Online Members within www.englanddarts.co.uk.\n\nIsle of Man Accommodation & Travel Details 2024\n\nPublished: 17 November 2023\n\nThe 2024 Isle of Man International Darts Festival, has just announced the Travel and Accommodation details which can be found on the link below.

The only players who played in 2018 who are selected this time are Deta Hedman and Lorraine Winstanley. The only other player to have previously played in a Europe Cup is James Hurrell, in 2016.\n\nDeta will be playing in the event for the fifth consecutive time and her seventh Europe Cup (she first played in 1994), whilst Lorraine will be making her fourth consecutive appearance at a Europe Cup.\n\nAll the other players will be making their Europe Cup debuts, although Beau Greaves has played in four Europe Youth Cups.\n\nSix Nations Cup 2022\n\nPublished: 17 June 2022\n\nThe Six Nations Cup, taking place in Scotland, can be viewed on YouTube using the links below.\n\nDay 1 - Friday 17th June 2022\n\nDay 2 - Saturday 18th June 2022\n\nDay 3 - Sunday 19th June 2022\n\nBeau Greaves Wins Dutch Open\n\nPublished: 13 June 2022\n\nCongratulations to England’s Beau Greaves winning the World Darts Federations Dutch Open in a thrilling final against Rhian Edwards.\n\nBoth girls head to Scotland this coming weekend for the 6 Nations International Championships to be held at the Normandy Hotel Renfrew, featuring England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Holland.\n\nEngland Men's team is James Hurrell, Scott Williams, Scott Taylor, Justin Hood and Luke Littler, and the ladies featuring Deta Hedman, Lorraine Winstanley and Beau Greaves.\n\nThe International Charity Singles begins on Friday morning, with the main event continuing through until Sunday evening.\n\nTickets are available from Scottish Darts Association.\n\nRIP Shaun Greatbatch\n\nPublished: 07 June 2022\n\nOn behalf of the Directors, Executive and the current England players I am sad to report that former England International Shaun Greatbatch has sadly passed away after a long battle with cancer.\n\nShaun represented England on 13 occasions winning 9 times, he also played in the Europe Cup once for England.\n\nShaun will always be in the darts record books as he was the first ever dart player to record a nine dart leg live on TV, which happened in the final of the Dutch Open which he went on to win.\n\nAs well as his time with England I also shared many years with him in Cambridgeshire, he had a natural talent for the game which meant he could take long breaks from the game, usually in the summer when he could usually by found fishing, but come the start of another darts season it was like seeing someone flick a switch as all his talent on the board returned instantly and he was a match for anyone.\n\nIt has been a terrible time for the family as only a few weeks ago, his Mum Sandra also passed away, so our thoughts are with his wife Barbara, his son Tom, his Dad Barry and his sister Sara and the family at this very sad time.\n\nIt was a pleasure to have known him, RIP Shaun.\n\nPeter Melton, England Darts\n\nEngland Youth Grand Prix Rankings Series 4\n\nPublished: 31 May 2022\n\nAfter 4 events in the England Youth Grand Prix, here are the up to date rankings for the season so far, our sincere thanks to Dave Dudeney and David Ballantine for their continued commitment to Youth Darts.\n\nThe next event will be held at Pontins Brean Sands on Saturday 9th July 2022.

Although an unexpected long day, the event produced some fabulous games with Tavis Dudeney being the eventual champion, although his journey to the final saw him having to survive a last leg decider in no less than three of his games, and a thrilling final against the latest England International recruit Archie Self 5-3 in a very close match.\n\nThe Girls champion saw two of the top girls in our system battling it out once again, with Paige Pauling being successful.\n\nWe would like to thank all the mums and dads along with the venue for getting the Grand Prix off to a successful start for the new season.\n\nSmall changes will be made to the registration process for the events going forward, which will enable us to reduce the preparation time, and obviously the event length, but thanks for bearing with us.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dave and Tommie who organised and ran the event.\n\nMixed Finals Last 32 Joel Pinto 3 Alfie Galloway 0 Joshua Bean 0 Ben Gamble 3 Hannah Meek 0 Jake Rigney 3 Ashley Marson 3 Oliver Allenby 0 Charlie Manby 3 Daniel Stephenson 1 Thomas Banks 2 Tavis Dudeney 3 Bradley Williams 3 Jayden Harper 2 Archie Self 3 Jason Meek 0 Harvey Stringer 3 Rhys Butler 1 Josh Jones 2 Cayden Smith 3 Mason Teese 3 George Prosser 1 Jamie Rooksby 3 Herbie Sowerby 1 Last 16 Oliver Wilson 0 Joel Pinto 3 Ben Gamble 3 Jake Rigney 1 Ashley Mason 3 Charlie Manby 3 Tavis Dudeney 3 Alfie Busby 2 Olly Raywood 3 Bradley Williams 1 Archie Self 3 Harvey Stringer 0 Cayden Smith 3 Mason Teese 1 Jamie Rooksby 3 Harry Earp 1 Quarter Finalists Joel Pinto 2 Ben Gamble 3 Charlie Manby 2 Tavis Dudeney 3 Olly Raywood 0 Archie Self 3 Cayden Smith 3 Jamie Rooksby 0 Semi Finalists Ben Gamble 0 Tavis Dudeney 4 Archie Self 4 Cayden Smith 2 Final Tavis Dudeney 5 Archie Self 3 Girls Championship Quarter Finalists Ella Williams 3 Iyla Leightley 2 Enola Wilson 3 Emma O'Connor 0 Rosie O'Connor 2 Hannah Meek 3 Paige Pauling 3 Kacie O'Connor 0 Semi Finalists Ella Williams 3 Enola Wilson 0 Hannah Meek 0 Paige Pauling 3 Final Ella Williams 0 Paige Pauling 3\n\nEngland Youth Grand Prix Series 2022 Starts\n\nPublished: 06 April 2022\n\nThe 2022 England Youth Grand Prix commences this coming Sunday 10th April, 2022 at the Belgrave Sports & Social Club Wilnecote Lane Tamworth B77 2LF.\n\nThe series of events has approximately 10 events, which includes The England Open, England Classic and British Open opportunities.\n\nThe Grand Prix is open to all players under 18, there are no restrictions at all on players being members of the JDC, and in fact we encourage them to come along to enhance their opportunities. Our Grand Prix events are different from the JDC events, as we run our events on a round robin basis, so each player has multiple games during the day rather than a straight knock-out, we also run a separate event for the girls, which has proved very popular, and gives them further opportunities.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what level of competition you are currently playing, our events are family orientated, and friendships that have been made during the 4 years our events have been held have been long lasting.\n\nThe registration opens at 11.00am with play starting approximately 12.30pm and concludes around 5ish.\n\nGood Luck to all the kids, hope you enjoy the experience, and who knows this could be the start of a fantastic future in our sport.\n\nTo enter the events, goto www.englanddarts.co.uk /online services\n\nEngland Open 2022\n\nPublished: 23 March 2022\n\nThe England Open and England National Singles Open will be held between 8th-10th July at Brean Sands in Somerset, the online entry will be open shortly. Please make sure when you book accommodation you use the \"Code\".\n\nThere are 8 events during the Open, Men's and Ladies Ranking singles, Men's and Ladies Pairs along with Mixed pairs and the England Youth Grand Prix, with around £25,000.00 prize fund.\n\nEngland Youth Grand Prix 2022 Series 2\n\nPublished: 22 March 2022\n\nThe 2022 England Youth Grand Prix series starts at the Belgrave Sports & Social Club in Tamworth on Sunday 10th April, 2022.\n\nThe Grand Prix now in its 4th year has produced some amazing talent over this short period, with some players now going on to be successful at full County level and on the world stage in televised championship events.\n\nThe England Youth International team has just been announced for 2022, but this series gives the Boys & Girls a chance to stake their claim for inclusion into the 2023 National Team.\n\nThe entry for the events is now open at www.englanddarts/online services for the youth who are Gold members of England there are entry discounts, again you can become a member through the England website.\n\nThe Grand Prix is open to all Boys and Girls under 18 on 31st December 2021, it doesn’t matter what standard you currently play at, as this is an opportunity to gain confidence for you all, and develop your abilities, but most of all meet new friends in this amazing sport of ours.\n\nIn addition we made a conscience decision a few years ago to cater for a separate girl’s competition to be included into the normal Grand Prix Round Robin format. So all the kids will play on several occasions during the afternoon, rather than the straight KO one game scenario, where you lose and go home.\n\nAlthough not as important as the above, there is over £300 in prize money at each venue.\n\nEngland Darts is giving you the platform, the rest is up to you.\n\nBest Wishes From England Darts\n\nThe England Youth Executive\n\nEngland Youth British Internationals Teams\n\nPublished: 21 March 2022\n\nEngland Darts after an intense scrutiny of all information available concerning Youth boys and girls performances are pleased to issue an invitation for the forthcoming British Internationals to be held in Merthyr Glamorgan between 20th – 22nd May 2022.\n\nWhilst we congratulate the selected players we are mindful of the terrific effort many of the other youth players have put into the England Darts system over the past 12 months, and we want to assure them that their efforts and support have not been overlooked, we intend to continue to monitor their progress at our events over the next 12 months, when we next revisit selection time for the 2023 British International squads.\n\nBoys\n\nLuke Littler (Cheshire) (Capt.)\n\nThomas Banks (Hertfordshire)\n\nArchie Self (Sussex)\n\nCharlie Manby (Yorkshire)\n\nStandby player Cayden Smith (Worcestershire)\n\nGirls\n\nAmy Evans (Cheshire) (Capt.)\n\nPaige Pauling (Sussex)\n\nStandby player Ella Williams (Berkshire)\n\nOn behalf of England Darts\n\nTommy Thompson\n\nChairman.\n\nIsle of Man Festival of Darts 2022\n\nPublished: 09 March 2022\n\nDrawsheets\n\nTHURSDAY EVENING - Visit Isle of Man Classic\n\nMen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nWomen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nFRIDAY DAYTIME - Darts Corner Isle of Man Masters\n\nMen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nWomen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nFRIDAY EVENING - Isle of Man Event Services Mixed Pairs\n\nMixed Pairs Drawsheet\n\nSATURDAY DAYTIME - one80 Isle of Man Open\n\nMen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nWomen's Singles Drawsheet\n\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON - Isle of Man Open Youth\n\nMixed Youth Drawsheet\n\nGirls Knockout Drawsheet\n\nSUNDAY MORNING - Isle of Man Steam Packet Pairs\n\nMen's Pairs - Doors open at 8:30 am; Register by 9 am; Play commences at 9:30 am.\n\nMens Pairs Drawsheet\n\nWomen's Pairs - Doors open at 9 am; Register by 9:30 am; Play commences immediately after registration closes.\n\nWomen's Pairs Drawsheet\n\nSUNDAY AFTERNOON - Stage Finals\n\nEstimated start time: 3 pm.\n\nThe finals will be streamed on the England Darts YouTube channel from 3 pm.

We hope this initiative will open up opportunities for players in particular from Devon, Cornwall, West of England and Somerset in particular to take part in a World Ranking event in their area, along with the players who always support our events from other areas of the UK and abroad.\n\nEngland Darts has always been open to staging events anywhere in England, previously staging World Ranking and International events in Lancashire (Southport Pontins), Cheshire (Stockport, Sale Leisure) , West Midlands (Ricoh Coventry), Humberside (Hull Arena), North Yorkshire (Bridlington Spa), West Sussex (Selsey Bunn Leisure), Yorkshire (Halifax & Bradford), plans in place to go to Lincolnshire (Skegness), Lancashire (Fleetwood), Lancashire (Blackpool Norbreck).\n\nWe have also staged England Grand Prix Youth events all around England, so it only seem fair finally to be able to offer our members in the South West opportunities that in the past they have had to travel to.\n\nAlthough this is just a basic announcement at this time, the details of prize monies, ranking status, additional events to the England Classic Darts Festival over the weekend, price of apartments (which I might add are top of the range and luxurious), and the facilities available from England and the management of the Holiday Park, we do hope that everyone will come on board with this very exciting opportunity for England Darts and their members.\n\nMember Players Information Face Book Page\n\nPublished: 18 February 2022\n\nIt has become evident to England Darts that information sent to Counties on \"some\" occasions isn’t being filtered down to the players.\n\nThe very important communications we sent over the past 18 months explained the company’s current financial position especially after the debacle of the BDO, followed by two years of a global pandemic, which prevented us from staging events.\n\nIn these previous communications we asked for assistance with ideas and input on how to maintain the historic position within the darts community, England Darts has had for over 45 years, sadly this resulted in no ideas from anyone outside of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe are in a different world, all companies are, and they have to adapt or die, I think we have all seen that in the darts community.\n\nWe tried to make membership of England inclusive as possible, including the players who have supported us for many years, alongside the historic position the county organisations have held.\n\nTo help the counties who have stayed loyal to England, with opportunities of not only funding the annual membership fee, but helping to raise extra funds for the county organisations internal commitments.\n\nIn an attempt to make sure that the maximum amount of players we now hold information for, can be a party to initiatives England have to offer on an ongoing situation, we have set up an England Players Members Page on Facebook.\n\nThis is a “Private Page” which is monitored by England to promote the company and its partners;\n\nSadly and quite unbelievebly we have a very small minority of players, whose only agenda is not in the best interests of our sport or England Darts and our continuing efforts to facilitate events and opportunities for all the players.\n\nIf these people are unhappy within the family England Darts and the events we stage, there are many other opportunities for them to take advantage of, and we wish them well, wherever they choose to go, which obviously by their posts, thankfully won't be at our events.\n\nThere will be zero tolerance to anyone who abuses the companies officials or its partners, we will not allow anyone to turn this new page, into negative, insulting and misrepresentation, of the company’s business, its officials or its partners that we have recently witnessed elsewhere.\n\nHealthy debate and suggestions are always welcomed by the directors. We will in turn help our members in their events, as long as they comply with the companies rules.\n\nEngland Ladies County Rankings Round 2 Feb 22\n\nPublished: 18 February 2022\n\nThese are the updated Rankings after Round 2 of the England County Rankings.

Although we have had to weather the Covid pandemic this year, as originally we would have completed the usual 9 matches, we have nevertheless been able to arrive at a final table for 2021.\n\nThere were a total of 357 Lady players in the table, which includes players who are members of a county who in turn are members of England Darts, along with the individual player’s memberships from associate members to Gold status memberships, who qualified as of the conclusion of matches played on 12th December 2021.\n\nWe all begin from scratch in January, and this year we hope if all things are running normally, that the England County Rankings will revert back to the original situation, where a players best 6 games will count towards the direct International qualifications.\n\nUnfortunately we have had to make the best of the truncated season, where our only option was to use all the possible 5 games, which we do take on board, doesn’t help players who have been unable to attend certain of the 5 scheduled matches through sickness, and government restrictions on a positive test for Covid, or in fact fell foul of another county cancelling a match.\n\nWe cannot stress how important it is that all players contact their associated counties executives from 1st January 2022 to identify whether they are members of The England Darts Organisation, if they find out they are not the players who wish to be identified into the England County Rankings, should make themselves an England playing individual member.\n\nOnly statistics gained at County matches will count when that player becomes a member, they will not have their county matches included into the County Ranking tables, retrospectively.\n\nAlthough we don’t look at any players who don’t meet the above criteria, it has come to light that three players who didn’t fit the criteria because their county chose not to be members of England, would in one instance absolutely qualified for the England International Team next May, with two others having a realistic chance through the selection process to be held in the next couple of weeks.\n\nSadly missed opportunities which could change their careers may not come back again.\n\nEngland County Men's Rankings Round 5 Update\n\nPublished: 22 December 2021\n\nThe Men’s England County Rankings Round 5 has now been completed.

The current fee for renewing or a new membership request is £250.\n\nApplications for membership from counties, who are not members in 2022, will in 2023 have an additional membership application fee to pay, along with the yearly membership fee.\n\nWe fully agree that elected executives of Counties make the decisions they feel is in the best interests of their members, and will not interfere in this right.\n\nWe would however implore all counties who are not renewing their England membership, to make their members aware of their decision, either in their internal communications or on their website, as your decision will have direct implications on all your players being involved in any consideration during the International selection process.\n\nIt became known to us during last year that many Counties who didn’t renew in 2021, didn’t inform their members of that decision, which cannot be in their best interests and unfair, and this lack of clarity from these counties directly prevented them from making alternative arrangements of their own.\n\nWe are aware that at least three players with a realistic chance of gaining International recognition will not feature in the selection process in the next couple of weeks as a direct result of their associated county not being members of England Darts.\n\nAs organisers of darts in England we are all doing our best to give all our players as many options in our sport as possible and natural justice would seem to be that all the players in England are aware of their options going forward from day 1.\n\nFor a County with just 100 members the England membership equates to 5p per week per player, a no brainer really, but again your choice.\n\nWe have this year produced a brand new website, where we keep everyone informed of our activities, along with the membership benefits, it also includes up to date ranking tables for our events and county, we regularly maintain our social media platforms on virtually a daily basis.\n\nwww.englanddarts.co.uk\n\nEngland Darts facebook.\n\n*** For Information.\n\nThe England County Rankings will be updated following the 2022 January scheduled matches, only Counties who are members of England Darts in 2022 will have their players included into our County Ranking table, there will be “no” retrospective inclusions for counties who don’t renew by the deadline of 31st January 2022, their players will not have their records included with any games completed in January.\n\nFor details on payment options please contact:\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.

Although the entries are a little slow currently, surely the W.D.F deserves the support of the Ladies for offering this massive prize fund.\n\nWith many of the Men entering the qualifiers already registered the event will without doubt produce some outstanding performances, in what we anticipate will be a fantastic showcase of advertising the quality of players in our system, and the two fortunate players to make it through will each receive a minimum of £1,000, but with £200,000 on offer in the Men's World Championships, and £50,000 for the eventual winner, any player who has any aspirations to test and progress his darts career, can surely not afford to miss this “Golden” opportunity.\n\nThere will be no admission charge for spectators/family/friends who want to watch the event.\n\nEngland Open Festival of Darts 2022\n\nPublished: 17 November 2021\n\nThe 2022 England Open Festival of Darts will be held in conjunction with Pontins Brean Sands between 8th -
