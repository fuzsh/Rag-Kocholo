        "text": "On stage, Paul Nicholson was one of darts' most colourful characters.\n\nFor years, the Geordie-Australian was a permanent fixture in televised darts competition. Brash, erratic, but also immensely talented. You wouldn't change the channel if 'The Asset' was on stage.\n\nNicholson is remembered for some of the most iconic moments in televised darts. His 'wave' to Phil Taylor after beating the 16-time world champion at the UK Open is still spoken about to this day, while the 2012 World Cup final between Nicholson's Australia and Taylor and Adrian Lewis' England was arguably the greatest in the history of the competition.\n\nThe 40-year-old wasn't averse to winning major silverware either, and entered the illustrious list of PDC major winners in 2010 when he won the Players Championship finals at the Circus Tavern.\n\nNowadays, you are more likely to hear Nicholson behind the mic than throwing darts on the oche, as he is one of the game's most prominent pundits.\n\nSo ahead of the 2020 world darts championships beginning on Friday, Nicholson kindly agreed to chat with Chronicle Live's Sean McCormick to talk all things tungsten.\n\nSo here is all you need to know about this year's tournament, including the contenders, dark horses, and the North East stars vying for glory in the capital, through the eyes of 'The Asset'.\n\nWho are the contenders?\n\nMichael van Gerwen\n\n\"It is hard to look past Michael van Gerwen given some of the things he has done this year. He has been through some adversity as well. People questioned his form in the middle of the summer and he didn't pick up many titles in June and July, including the World Matchplay.\n\n\"People began to question him and experts were saying if he didn't win any of the World Series events then this could be seen as a blip.\n\n\"But then he goes and wins two titles in New Zealand and Australia and after that he was back to normal. He proved that by winning the World Grand Prix, winning the Champions League and winning the Players Championship.\n\n\"He is the favourite but there are some people hot on his heels. He has never defended the world title yet and when people lay down a challenge for Michael it just gives him more motivation to do what he always wants to do - win as many world titles as possible.\n\n\"His aim is to win six, he wants to get past Raymond van Barneveld's five world titles to become the best Dutch player for his legacy.\n\n\"As for defending the title, he will want to do it to purely shut the media up - including myself!\n\n\"If he was to win it this year it would cap off what has been a very challenging season. He hasn't been as dominant as previous seasons but he is still the best player in the world.\"\n\nGerwyn Price\n\n\"Statistically, he is the biggest threat to van Gerwen's title. He has the 180s in the locker, he has got the big checkouts at certain times.\n\n\"He is not afraid of Michael and he has an enormous level of consistency in these longer matches. He is very comfortable and very fit for this challenge.\n\n\"The only question mark over Gerwyn Price is he hasn't had a massive run at Ally Pally yet but let's face facts - he is ready to do so.\n\n\"He is in section four of the draw which is tantalising. There are so many players in that quarter of the draw who can go on a run and win that quarter and that will stand Price in good stead because he knows that if he is going to win that quarter that he is going to have to be pinpoint and so focused.\"\n\nRob Cross\n\n\"There is doubt in many people's minds whether Rob Cross can win this title. His season has been very odd.\n\n\"Picking up the World Matchplay title was a great performance but he didn't play his best stuff to win that title. Was he the best player in the European Championships that he won? Probably, but he didn't have any standout performances like he had when he won the world title by beating Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor. He just made less mistakes than everyone else.\n\n\"He has become that kind of player and we all joke that he only wins major titles now. He doesn't win European Tour events, he doesn't win Players Championship events, he just wins majors.\n\n\"He has turned into a major machine but can he win this title? Yes, but other players are going to have to make mistakes if he is to do that.\"\n\nMichael Smith\n\n\"It will be more difficult for Michael this year because I suppose last year nobody really expected him to make the final. The fact that he did pushed him up the rankings a hell of a lot more.\n\n\"He is number four seed so perspectively, he could face Michael van Gerwen in the semi-finals in a repeat of last year's final.\n\n\"But there are people in his quarter who I think vastly in his way - one being Adrian Lewis.\n\n\"Nobody is talking about Adrian Lewis right now but they should be because his form is decent, he has lots of passion for the sport again and he has got a decent section to come through. He is very dangerous in there.\n\n\"Michael Smith can win his quarter but he has to a) get over minor surgery on his chest - nothing major, but he has to be comfortable and b) he has to be in a positive mindset like he was last year.\n\n\"Does he have that same positive mindset? We don't know so we'll have to wait to find out.\"\n\nAnd the old-timers?\n\nRaymond van Barneveld\n\n\"It's his final year and I think the potential is there for him to have a bit of a run. If you look at the way Raymond has always tried to peak for a world championship, it is no accident that he has won five of them.\n\n\"He played well at Minehead last month and he has always said he is more dangerous when he just has to play one game per day. That is exactly what he will do at this tournament.\n\n\"But there is a huge person in his way - I am not talking about big Darin Young in the first round - what I am talking about is 25th seed Jeffrey de Zwaan.\n\n\"He is Raymond van Barneveld's protege and his potential opponent in the second round. A lot of people think de Zwaan is way too dangerous an opponent for Barney. He has had some first round defeats in the past and it will be almost poetic if he is sent home by his protege.\n\n\"It all depends on whether Raymond believes - he says he does - and does de Zwaan want to send him home? I think he will want to try to impose himself as the next hope of Dutch darts.\n\n\"I want that game to happen and I want to see if Raymond genuinely believes he can beat de Zwaan and go on to challenge in this world championships.\"\n\nGary Anderson\n\n\"I spent a bit of time with Gary last weekend and I can honestly say I have never seen Gary this relaxed for well over a decade.\n\n\"I think Gary has come to terms with how good his career has been up to date and I personally see the end in sight for his career.\n\n\"As long as he is in the top 16 in the world he will remain a professional darts player. I think once he goes out of the top 16, I think he will find his way into retirement.\n\n\"He still has a lot of ability but I don't think darts is as easy for him after his back injury. When you look at his quarter and the players in his way - the likes of Nathan Aspinall, Krzysztof Ratajski, Michael Smith, Adrian Lewis - will he come through that? I'm not sure.\n\n\"He might even struggle in round two as Brendan Dolan is a tough ask. I have got to say other players are more threatening this time around.\"\n\nWhat about the North East lads?\n\nGlen Durrant\n\n\"There has been a lot of talk about Glen because if he wins this tournament he will be the first person to ever hold the BDO world championship and the PDC championship at the same time. He would technically become the undisputed world champion of darts which would have a nice ring to it.\n\n\"I think Glen should be really proud of what he has done in the last 12 months. It was not an easy thing for him to switch in the first place. It was not easy for him to get through Q-School but quality doesn't lie.\n\n\"He will be kicking himself that he didn't make the switch sooner because by making three major semi-finals in his first season with the PDC and doing other bits on tour, it is very possible he could come through that very tricky section four.\n\n\"But right from the off he is going to have a difficult game against Jose De Sousa or Damon Heta - two of the stories of the year.\n\n\"He won't look past that game but it will be really hard to predict what he can do. But wouldn't it be great for the North East if he ends up playing Chris Dobey in round four?\"\n\nChris Dobey\n\n\"There is no limit for Chris in this game. He is in relaxed mood, he will be putting in the hours and after last year's run to the last 16, that would have prepared him for this season.\n\n\"He has reached two major semi-finals and that will have prepared him for this tournament. I think he is coming in here as one of the dark horses for a very big run.\n\n\"But again, he is in section four and it is so stacked at the bottom of the draw. Chris won't be bothered because the way he has been playing, especially in Minehead, I don't think he holds any fear for any darts player on the planet.\n\n\"I think he is ready to test himself again to see how far he can go.\"\n\nRyan Joyce\n\n\"He has got something to live up to after he got to the quarter-finals last year but he hasn't had the best of seasons.\n\n\"He has still got himself back to Ally Pally, though, which is job done. What we have seen in the last few weeks with Ryan, especially in Gibraltar when he missed double 12 for a nine-darter, he has changed something very small on his grip of the darts and he is finally throwing the dart the way he wants to.\n\n\"With that in mind, he is playing Jan Dekker who hasn't played on the tour this year. That is a good draw.\n\n\"His seeded player is Jonny Clayton is a fantastic player but he has been all or nothing this season. That draw could have been worse and he is in a section that could have been a lot more damaging.\n\n\"Michael van Gerwen would likely await in the fourth round but to say Ryan Joyce will make it to the last 16 isn't inconceivable.\"\n\nCallan Rydz\n\n\"Don't even dare underestimate Callan Rydz from Northumberland. He is so dangerous and if he is in the right frame of mind he can beat anybody.\n\n\"He is a fabulous youth player who has shown glimpses of brilliance in the last few season. He has kept plugging away and he hasn't had an easy life.\n\n\"When he looks in the mirror he sometimes sees an enemy. When he looks in the mirror he should see someone who is an exceptionally talented player.\n\n\"Everybody rates Callan Rydz. He has a great name for the sport, he is fast, he has a great action, he is raw and has all the talent.\n\n\"If he can be moulded with a little bit of patience and experience, there is no ceiling to the ability of Callan Rydz.\n\n\"He can average telephone numbers and Steve Lennon will be having nightmares about this game because if Rydz is on song he could blow him away in the first round.\"\n\nWhat about the best of the rest?\n\n\"I would love to see Dave Chisnall have a big run at Ally Pally. He has made the quarters before but his section of the draw is pretty tasty.\n\n\"Peter Wright will be there or thereabouts but no game is going to be easy. Someone is going to come out of the dark here. I think Adrian Lewis is going to have a big run. He is going to go really well in this tournament.\n\n\"I would love to see Gabriel Clemens of Germany have a big run and we all want to see him play Max Hopp in round two. Two Germans with loads of Germans in the crowd and it will finally allow the British public watching at home to be the neutral.\n\nFinally, will Paul target a return to professional darts?\n\n\"I am very fortunate to work with the PDC, the BBC and TalkSPORT. I love what I do, I am really passionate about it and I am passionate about the future of the game.\n\n\"It keeps me awake at night, it gets me up in the morning. I want the future of this game reaching its full potential. Do I think it is there right now? No, I don't.\n\n\"Right now, I am happy working in the media but in January I am going to Q-School. If I am good enough I will play again. If I am not, I will continue my media work and poster the sport in the way it should be postered.\""
