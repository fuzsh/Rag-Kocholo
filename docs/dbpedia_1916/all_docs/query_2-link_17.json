        "text": "The 2012 PDC Pro Tour was a series of non-televised darts tournaments organised by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). They were the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA) Players Championships, the UK Open Qualifiers, and the new European Tour events. This year there were 33 PDC Pro Tour events – 20 Players Championships, 8 UK Open Qualifiers, and 5 European Tour events.\n\nPrize money\n\nPrize money for each Players Championship and UK Open Qualifier is £34,600, unchanged from 2011. Prize money for each European Tour event was £82,100.\n\nStage Winner £15,000 £6,000 £500Runner-up £7,500 £3,000 £300Semi-finalists £5,000 £2,000 £200£3,000 £1,000 £100Last 16 £1,500 £600 £75Last 32 £1,000 £400 £50Last 64 £200 £200 N/ATotal £82,100 £34,600 £3,000\n\nIn addition, the 32 players who failed to qualify for a European Tour event at the final qualifying stage receive £100. A further £400 per Pro Tour event (£800 per European Tour event) was reserved for a nine-dart finish. If this was not won in an event, it was carried over to the next event, and so on until a nine-dart finish was achieved. Once the prize fund was won, it reverted to the starting value for the next event.\n\nPDC Pro Tour Card\n\n128 players were granted Tour Cards, which enabled them to participate in all Players Championships, UK Open Qualifiers and European Tour events.\n\nTour cards\n\nThe 2012 Tour Cards were awarded to:\n\n64 players from the PDC Order of Merit after the 2012 World Championship\n\n20 Tour Card holders from the previous year's Qualifying School not included among the 64 Order of Merit qualifiers\n\nno Tour Card holders from the previous year's 2010 PDC Women's World Championship invitations (Tricia Wright and Stacy Bromberg both resigned their membership)\n\n1 semi-finalist from the 2012 BDO World Championship (Ted Hankey; the other three semi-finalists Christian Kist, Wesley Harms and Tony O'Shea declined invitations)\n\n1 finalist from the 2012 PDC World Youth Championship (James Hubbard; the other finalist Michael van Gerwen was among the 64 qualified players from the Order of Merit)\n\n2 highest-ranking players from the 2011 PDC Youth Tour Order of Merit not already qualified (Paul Barham and Reece Robinson)\n\n40 qualifiers from a four-day Qualifying School in Barnsley (4 semi-finalists from each day, plus the top 24 players from the Q School Order of Merit)\n\nQ School\n\nThe PDC Pro Tour Qualifying School took place at the Metrodome in Barnsley from January 19–22.\n\nA Q School Order of Merit was also created by using the following points system:\n\nStage PointsLast 8 9Last 16 5Last 32 3Last 64 2Last 1281\n\nTo complete the field of 128 Tour Card Holders, places were allocated down the final Qualifying School Order of Merit.
