        "text": "Teenage sensation Luke Littler has been told he can win the World Darts Championship on his first outing after the 16-year-old's stunning performance at Alexandra Palace.\n\nThere has been much anticipation about Littler stepping up to the main stage having been the reigning world youth champion. He saw off Dutchman Christian Kist, the 2012 BDO champion, with a stunning 3-0 victory on Wednesday.\n\nLittler put up some sensational numbers whilst doing so, hitting seven 180s and producing a three-dart average of 106.12. The tournament features an impressive roll of honour with Michael van Gerwen the bookies favourites, but the teenager's performance has some suggesting he can go all the way.\n\nMark Webster, the 2008 BDO champion, said on Sky Sports : \"I'm going to get carried away with it: I think he can win the whole thing! You play like that on your debut, there's no nerves. Look, there's going to be a lot more coming at him, particularly in the next round. Andrew Gilding will make it difficult.\n\n\"Christian played okay but he wasn't allowed to play and if he [Littler] does that to Gilding, that'll send out another message. Then it's the possibility of Matt Campbell next...if you play like that, you can win the title.\"\n\nLittler, from Warrington, admitted he couldn't believe how quickly he settled into his rhythm on Wednesday night. He then dedicated his win to 16-time world champion Phil Taylor, whom he idolised growing up.\n\nQuizzed on how his performance at Ally Pally ranks, he said: \"[Tonight has] got to be at the top. I've been playing since I was 18 months old, obviously looking up to Phil Taylor. I know he's watching - that's for you, Phil! Absolutely over the moon.\"\n\nPundit Wayne Mardle added : \" I can't remember a better [debut] than that. I can't remember someone going up there with such a swagger and just banging in 180s and hitting 11 and 12-darters like they are going out of fashion.\n\n\"I'm a darts fan first and foremost, I was watching it and I had goosebumps watching him. I love people achieving and that was a boy achieving something on the world stage. We may never see the like again. We saw it with Phil Taylor and then we saw it with Michael van Gerwen. This may be the third coming of that. I don't know, but I'm a little bit carried away.\"\n\nElsewhere on Wednesday night Peter Wright saw his tournament end in round two. Jim Williams saw him off 3-0 meaning the two-time champion is out."
