        "text": "By Darts Weekly Staff\n\n27 NOVEMBER 2016 • 11:09PM\n\nCorey Cadby became the first player outside of Europe to win the PDC Unicorn World Youth Championship, beating Berry van Peer 6-2 in Sunday’s final at Minehead.\n\nThe 21-year-old Australian has enjoyed a breakthrough year, beating Phil Taylor in the Perth Darts Masters and qualifying for the William Hill World Darts Championship for the first time.\n\nAnd at the weekend his memorable 2016 continued, as he held his nerve in front of 4,000 fans at Butlin’s Minehead to win the World Youth Championship.\n\n“It hasn’t really sunk in yet but I’m over the moon,” Cadby said.\n\n“It’s massive and I’ll only look forward now, this is just the start for me.\n\n“It didn’t feel like I was throwing my best but it got me the win.\n\n“It’s going to be amazing taking this trophy back home to show it off, it means absolutely everything.\n\n“It’s a great experience and I can’t wait to play against the best in the World Championship and hopefully I’ll beat the best, I’ve got no fear!”\n\nCadby’s final three dart average, 98.35, was the highest recorded in a World Youth Championship final and was yet another indication of how well he can perform on the big stages.\n\nThe young Aussie will now aim to make his mark on the Alexandra Palace stage next month."
