        "text": "Hello readers, welcome to another interview on asiandarts.sport.blog, this time with Rohit Rabadia. Playing for India but being born in England, Rabadia tries to make a positive impact in the world of darts, inspire future players and stimulate darts in India.\n\nMy name is Rohit “Rugrat” Rabadia, and I am 44 years old. I was born and raised in NW London, England. Currently, I have businesses in the UK and Dubai. I specialise in home drafting systems in the UK and in Dubai I am the cofounder of www.wassupdubai.ae. I enjoy sports and travelling, and I’m always excited to learn new things and meet new people.\n\nHis nickname ”Rugrat” was given to him a long time ago by his friends: “My nickname “The Rugrat” actually started as a joke among my friends when I first started playing darts, I had shaved my hair making me bald which reminded them of a character called Tommy in the Rugrats cartoon. One of my friends started calling me “Rugrat” as a playful nod to my look and energy, and the name just stuck. Now, it’s a fun reminder of those early days and how far I’ve come in the sport.”\n\nRabadia started playing darts at the age of 15 when he asked for his first dartboard on his birthday. ”I never missed watching darts on TV as I was a HUGE fan of the Late Eric Bristow. When I lived in London I played in 2 local leagues twice a week and started playing on the BDO circuit on weekends in the UK and Europe. I relocated to the North in 2012 and began my journey on the PDC circuit. I try to get a couple of hours practise in everyday in my darts den, my son now 14 is my practice partner.”\n\nEven though Rabadia was born in England, he decided to play for India for a few reasons. Not only because his family’s roots is in India, but also because of the culture and having a wonderful connection to the country. He also wants to grab this opportunity to contribute to the growth and development of the sport in India, where darts is still gaining popularity. Rabadia: ”Representing India allows me to honor my heritage and make a meaningful impact. The PDC changed the ruling two years ago which opened the doors and allowed me to take this route.”\n\nThis year, Rabadia has taken things a step further and plays all of the PDC Asian Tours. So far, his effort resulted in qualifying for the PDC World Cup Asian Qualifier, where he played with Nitin Kumar. They played in the same group as winners Singapore and Malaysia, but nevertheless it has been a great experience so far for Rabadia: ”Playing on the PDC Asian Tour this year has been an incredible experience. The competition is fierce, and it’s been exciting to test my skills against some of the best players in the region. Qualifying for the World Cup with Nitin Kumar was definitely a highlight and a testament to the hard work we’ve both put in.\n\nHowever, keeping up with all the travelling can be challenging and it requires a lot of careful planning and support from my family to balance my professional commitments with my personal life. I’m grateful for their understanding and encouragement, which makes it all possible. Despite the challenges, the opportunity to represent and compete at such a high level makes all the effort worthwhile as well as the people I have met along the way who now feel like a family as they have been so helpful and welcoming.”\n\nQualifying for the PDC World Cup Qualifiers with Nitin Kumar has been the absolute highlight for Rabadia so far in his darts career. ”It was an incredible achievement, especially considering the level of competition on the PDC Asian Tour. Standing on that stage, representing India, and competing at such a prestigious event was a dream come true. I will cherish that moment as it motivates me to drive forward and achieve more.”\n\nLooking forward to what lies ahead, Rabadia describes his plans and goals as following:\n\n”For the next year, my primary goals are to continue improving my game and to consistently perform well on the PDC Asian Tour. Specifically, I aim to qualify for more major tournaments, including another shot at the World Cup and play in the Asian Championships. I also want to focus on refining my skills and increasing my practice schedule to enhance my consistency under pressure.\n\nLong-term, I aspire to establish myself as one of the top players in the region and eventually compete at the highest levels, such as the PDC World Championship. Additionally, I hope to inspire more people in India to take up darts and contribute to the growth of the sport in the country. My sponsors Cuesoul Darts have made my new custom darts, which has aided my game and I believe I have my perfect darts which will help me achieve my goals. My custom equipment is available on www.cuesoul.com ”\n\nLike most players, Rabadia also has two players who inspired him on his journey in the world of darts: Stephen Bunting and Michael van Gerwen. ”I am inspired firstly by Stephen Buntings remarkable journey and his exemplary character both on and off the stage and Michael van Gerwen’s exceptional dedication and skill in the sport.\n\nStephens perseverance and dedication is also motivating. He has consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic and a commitment to improving his game. His transition from the BDO to the PDC was challenging, yet he managed to excel, showing that adaptability and resilience are key to overcoming obstacles.\n\nMichael started playing darts at a young age and worked tirelessly to improve, which is inspiring as it shows with dedication and hard work, it’s possible to achieve excellence.\n\nStephen and Michaels humility and sportsmanship in respect of their opponents, how they handle both victories and defeats with grace, maintain a positive attitude and show respect to their competitors is admirable.\n\nI am inspired to balance my darts career with my personal life like Stephen has achieved through his dedication to his family and his efforts to inspire and support others in the darts community highlighting his generous spirit and leadership qualities and I am inspired to develop a mindset like Michael’s mental toughness during matches in order to stay calm under pressure.\n\nAs Rabadia hopes to inspire more people to take up darts, he has a final message to the readers:\n\nDream, Believe & Achieve! Never give up and always stay committed. I extend my gratitude for your interest and support. Whether you’re a fellow darts enthusiast, a fan of the sport, or simply curious about my journey, your encouragement means a lot to me and I thank you.\n\nSpecial thanks to my sponsors:\n\nCuesoul darts\n\nSpice & Spirits sports bar\n\nNSCmedia\n\nFor their continued support and belief in me.\n\nRohit Rabadia has his own website as well, which will launch soon. The website will feature updates on his tournaments, a blog about his journey in darts, and a section where you can connect with Rohit. Stay tuned for the official launch date and be sure to check it out!\n\nhttp://www.rohitrabadia.com/\n\nNote to readers: If you’re interested in darts in India, I’d highly recommend to read my article about Mahi Bosmia and Indian darts, as well as watch the interview I did together with Dartfreakz.\n\nPictures by: PDC Asia, Rohit Rabadia\n\nAs the PDC Asian Tour is getting bigger every year, not only more and more people are following the tour closely, but also players from even more nations decide to give one or more of the weekends a shot. This year, we’ve seen players from countries like Kazakhstan, Palestine, Oman and Jordan. During the 8th tournament this year, held in the Philippines, we saw Bruneian talent ‘Abdul Qahar Ukail Hj Shamsul Ariffin or short: Abdul Qahar Ukail’ step up and make it to the semifinals. Brunei, not very well known as a darts country, was put on the map, people actually calling for the Bruneian team to make it to the 2024 PDC World Cup. That didn’t happen, but I’m very happy to have spoken with the young talent from Brunei about his darts journey, his ambitions and goals and his experience during some of the recent tournaments he’s played.\n\nAbdul Qahar Ukail, who is 27 years old and from Bukit Beruang in the Tutong district in Brunei Darussalam is self-employed and spends most of his time training darts at home and joining the local tournament events every week. In a country without a night life and with a small population, Ukail explains how he started out playing darts: ‘’I’ve started playing casually since 2012 with my friends around the neighborhood. At first, I didn’t own any sets of darts and dartboard. Then one day, I joined a tournament in my neighborhood and I won the whole thing by using a house dart that’s provided. As the winner they gave me a set of dart. Since then, I started to play casually by joining local events and small tournaments. I started to love the games eventually.’’\n\nAs said in the introduction, Brunei is not exactly known as a darts country and not everyone might have heard of it after all. Brunei is a very small country near Indonesia and Malaysia. Ukail: ‘’Brunei Darussalam is a very peaceful Muslim country that many people in the world are not aware of. Brunei is a very safe country to live in. Schools and hospitals are almost free here for the Bruneians and we live tax free as a Bruneian. If you love nature, Brunei has the best to offer.’’\n\nHow does playing darts in Brunei go? Ukail explains: ‘’We don’t have the night life here in Brunei such as clubs, pubs or any forms of night entertainment. Since there is no nightlife in Brunei, I grab the opportunity to spend my time perfecting my darts by training daily at night. I usually train by myself at home, sometime looking for somebody to spar either at my place or at their house. There is a weekly event in Brunei, sometimes it’s a single event sometimes it’s a double event. Nowadays there are a lot of strong dart players here in Brunei that need a lot of exposure.’’\n\nTalking about the Asian Tour, Ukail just participated in Asian Tour 7-9 in the Philippines and made it to the semifinals in Tour 8. He experienced the tour as follows:\n\n‘’Asian Tour is a whole experience for me because before that I only joined the big tournaments in the Malaysian darts scene, I also knew most of the strong dart players came from the Philippines, that’s why I want to challenged myself and start my Asian tour in Manila, Philippines. I didn’t expect to reach the semifinal stage on tour 8, for me it was like a stepping stone to reach another stage in my career.\n\nIn the last 32 I was paired with Robbie Wong from Malaysia; it was an intense match where he lead 3-0 but I managed to compose myself and making a comeback with hitting a 148 finish at the deciding leg.\n\nIn the semifinal match I got paired with Tomoya Goto from Japan. He’s a very strong player! I can compete in terms of scoring, but his finishing is very strong. Sadly, I lost to him 5-0. Nevertheless, the whole experience thought me that nothing is impossible if you put your heart and soul into it.’’\n\nAnother recent tournament Ukail has played, is the Winmau Sabah Masters in Malaysia, a steel tip tournament played on FIDO boards, where Ukail claimed the singles and team title and was semi finalist in the doubles event. You can watch the singles final below the interview. After that, Ukail also played the PDC Asian Tour 10-12 in Malaysia, making the T64 in all three tournaments.\n\nAs to the question if Ukail has plans to play more tournaments overseas and as what his aspirations are for the next year, he said: ‘’I would love to enter more of PDC Tournaments either in Asia or EU. My main target currently is either the Asian Stage / Championship or god’s willing to Biggest of all PDC World Championship next year. I would also like to compete for a spot for the PDC World Cup of Darts next year.”\n\nHe describes the highlights in his darts career as following:\n\nThis year alone:\n\nChampion 3some events, in Kuching,Sarawak.\n\nChampion Marzuq international double open 2024 in Miri, Sarawak.\n\nChampion Sabah Open 2024.\n\nSemi Finalist Asian Tour 8.\n\nWinmau Sabah Masters 2024 winning the single open category and team event. And semi Finalist in Double event\n\nHis inspiration in darts is local player Pengiran Mohamed. Darts fans may know him for being the first Bruneian darts player to participate in a World Championship, as he qualified for the 2018 BDO World Championship.\n\n‘’He’s been playing for 20+ years and still playing at his best performances and he is considered as my mentor in darts. Another inspiration is Dutch player Michael Van Gerwen, because of his aggressive playstyle and his dominance in darts world.’’\n\nAs a final message to the readers, Abdul Qahar Ukail says:\n\n‘’I would like to thank my family especially my mom, dad, family and friends for supporting me all the way. I would also like thank asiandarts.sport.blog for giving me this opportunity to tell more about Asian darts scene and especially for Bruneian darts scene.’’\n\nI’d really like to thank Qahar for his time and effort he put into answering my questions for AsianDarts and wish him the best of luck on his darts journey and achieving his goals.\n\nPicture credits: PDC Asia, Abdul Qahar Ukail (FB).\n\nHello everyone! Today I’m happy to announce this interview with one of Japan’s best players currently: Jun Matsuda. Currently in the top 4 of the PDC Asian Tour Order of Merit and on a World Championship spot, Jun was so kind to answer my questions about darts, the PDC, WDF and future plans.\n\nI hope you all enjoy reading this interview.\n\n(The interview below is in both Japanese and English. There might be some spelling errors here and there, because I wrote the questions in Dutch and translated with a combination of my own knowledge of the Japanese language and the help of a translator.)\n\nダーツを始めたきっかけは何で、いつでしたか？\n\nダーツを始めたきっかけは\n\n元々ビリヤードを17歳位からやっておりまして、そこにソフトダーツのマシンが導入された事が始まりです。\n\nビリヤードでは暫く順番が来ない事があるのですが、ダーツは必ず順番が来るのでフェアだと思いましたね(笑)\n\nWhat was the reason you started playing darts, and when was it?\n\nThe reason I started playing darts was because I had been playing billiards since I was around 17 years old, and soft dart machines were introduced there.\n\nIn billiards, there are times when you have to wait a while for your turn, but with darts, the turns always come in order, so I thought it was fair (laughs).\n\n仕事は何をしていて、ダーツ以外の趣味は何ですか？\n\n仕事は元々はリサイクルショップを個人で営んでおりました。\n\nが…今はダーツが専業になってます。\n\n趣味はアウトドアですね。\n\n北海道は冬が非常に寒いのでキャンプに最適です♪\n\nWhat do you do for work, and what are your other hobbies besides darts?\n\nI used to run a recycling shop on my own. But… now darts has become my main occupation.\n\nMy hobby is outdoor activities. Hokkaido is very cold in winter, so it’s perfect for camping♪\n\n2019年にはじめてフェニックスのパーフェクトツアーに参加しましたね。すぐに優勝し、その後すぐにL-StyleとDYNASTYのスポンサーを得ましたね。なぜ参加することにしたのか、そしてその後の経験について教えてください。\n\nPHOENIX DARTSのプロ団体\n\n「PERFECT」に参戦するキッカケになった理由はいくつかあります。\n\n先ずは2019年のスティールリーグ\n\n「light League」での年間ランキングで1位になり、そのご褒美にADA香港に招待して頂きました。\n\nその時の刺激でしょうか♪\n\nアジアでもこんなにも強い人が居る\n\nならプロなら更に面白そうと思い始めたのです(笑)\n\nもう1つは北海道のダーツを盛り上げたいという思いがありました。\n\nその為に北海道からでも戦える事を証明したかったのです。\n\n今の所上手くいってるかと(笑)\n\nスポンサー様である「Lstyle」様\n\n「DYNASTY」様には本当に良くして頂いております。\n\n今年は「PHOENIX DARTS」様にもスポンサードをして頂き感謝しかありません。\n\nIn 2019, you participated in the Phoenix Perfect Tour for the first time. You won immediately and soon after got sponsored by L-Style and DYNASTY. Can you tell me why you decided to participate and about your experiences afterward?\n\nThe reason I decided to join the “PERFECT” pro organization of PHOENIX DARTS had several factors.\n\nFirst, I ranked first in the “light League” of the 2019 Steel League, and as a reward, I was invited to ADA Hong Kong. I think that was the inspiration♪ Seeing such strong players in Asia made me think that if there are players this strong, it would be even more interesting to become a pro (laughs). Another reason was my desire to promote darts in Hokkaido. I wanted to prove that I could compete even from Hokkaido. So far, it seems to be working well (laughs). Sponsors like “Lstyle” and “DYNASTY” have been really good to me. This year, I’m also grateful for the sponsorship from “PHOENIX DARTS.”\n\n2022年にはオランダのWDFウィンマウワールドマスターズとオープンに参加しましたね。その経験はどうでしたか？また、WDFのトーナメントとPDCのトーナメントはあなたの目にはどのように異なりますか？\n\nWDFマスターズは楽しかったですね。\n\n投げ方、リズムが十人十色でレベルが高い！\n\n今後の課題を沢山貰った非常に有意義なトーナメントでした。\n\nPDCのトーナメントは対戦相手が\n\n全員スター選手でやはり世界の最高峰のトーナメントと思っております。\n\nIn 2022, you participated in the WDF Winmau World Masters and Open in the Netherlands. How was that experience? Also, how do WDF and PDC tournaments differ in your eyes?\n\nThe WDF Masters was enjoyable. Different throwing styles, rhythms, and a high level of play! It was a very meaningful tournament where I received many challenges for the future. PDC tournaments feature opponents who are all star players, making them the pinnacle of the world, in my opinion.\n\nまた、2度PDCワールドカップに出場していますね。国を代表する形でプレーすることについてどう感じていますか？PDCワールドカップ・オブ・ダーツで誰と一緒にダーツをしたいですか？\n\nPDCワールドカップも楽しいですねぇ♪\n\n日本を代表する選手として思いきり楽しみ、そして応援して頂いてる皆さんも楽しんで貰える様に……\n\nと思っております♪\n\n対戦したい国は沢山あります。\n\n近年ではウェールズ、スコットランド、オランダ、ベルギーは是非対戦してみたいですね。\n\nYou’ve also represented your country twice in the PDC World Cup. How do you feel about playing as a representative of your country? Who would you like to play darts with in the PDC World Cup of Darts?\n\nThe PDC World Cup is also a lot of fun♪ I want to fully enjoy playing as a representative of Japan and ensure that everyone who supports me also has fun… That’s what I’m thinking♪ There are many countries I’d like to play against. In recent years, I’d love to play against Wales, Scotland, the Netherlands, and Belgium.\n\n数週間後には中国で最後のアジアンツアーがありますね。現在、あなたは4位に位置しています。そのままでいれば、PDCワールドチャンピオンシップに参加できますね。最後のアジアンツアーに向けてどのように準備していますか？特別に緊張していますか？\n\nとうとうアジアツアー最終戦の中国ですね♪\n\nいつもと変わらずに調整して\n\n楽しいダーツをしたいと思っております♪\n\n特別な緊張は今ところありません。\n\n自分のダーツに徹する事のみ考えております。\n\nIn a few weeks, the final Asian Tour event will take place in China. You’re currently in 4th place. If you maintain your position, you’ll qualify for the PDC World Championship. How are you preparing for the last Asian Tour event? Are you extra nervous?\n\nFinally, the last Asian Tour event in China♪ I’m adjusting as usual and aiming to have fun playing darts♪ I’m not feeling any special nervousness at the moment. I’m just focused on giving my best in my darts.\n\n2024年におけるダーツに関する計画は何ですか？\n\nこれは今非常に考えている所です。\n\n更なる挑戦を視野に入れ、\n\n今後の状況を踏まえて決めて行きたいと思っております。\n\nWhat are your plans for darts in 2024?\n\nI’m currently thinking about this a lot. I’m considering further challenges and will decide based on the situation ahead.\n\nいつかPDC Qスクールに参加して、ツアーカードを獲得しようと考えていますか？\n\nもちろんQスクールの事は常に考えております。\n\n戦ってみたいですね😊\n\nAre you thinking about participating in the PDC Q School to earn a tour card?\n\nOf course, I’m always thinking about Q School. I’d like to give it a try 😊\n\nロンドンのWorld Championshipダーツ以外で、どのトーナメントにまた参加したいですか？\n\nこれは難しいですね……\n\nもちろんPDCツアーでしょうか……\n\nPDCシニアツアーも面白そうですね♪\n\nApart from the World Championship Darts in London, which other tournament would you like to participate in?\n\nThis is a tough question… Probably another PDC tour event… The Senior Tour seems interesting too♪\n\nダーツでのあなたのインスピレーションは誰ですか？なぜその人がインスピレーションとなっていますか？\n\nやはりダーツを始めた時に感じたフィル・テイラー氏でしょうか…\n\nプロのダーツプレイヤーの全てがそこにあると思っております😊\n\nWho inspires you in darts? Why are they an inspiration to you?\n\nIt would still be Phil Taylor, whom I felt inspired by when I first started playing darts… I believe all professional dart players have something special😊\n\nに、読者の皆さんへのメッセージはありますか？\n\nご覧頂きありがとうございます。\n\nしがない日本の1プレイヤーですが、世界のダーツプレイヤー、皆様とお会いできる日を楽しみにしております。\n\nスポンサーである\n\n「DYNASTY」\n\n「Lstyle」\n\n「PHOENIXDARTS」\n\nと共に応援よろしくお願い致します🙇‍♂️\n\nDo you have a message for your readers?\n\nThank you for reading. I’m just a player from Japan, but I’m looking forward to the day I can meet all the world’s dart players. Please continue to support me along with my sponsors, “DYNASTY,” “Lstyle,” and “PHOENIX DARTS.” 🙇‍♂️\n\nIt’s been yet another while, but today I’m happy to announce a small interview with South Korean darts player ‘Jaein Oh’, who participates in most of the PDC Asian Tours, the WDF World Masters and Open and soon the PDC World Youth Championship. At those tournaments, he played the likes of Paul Lim, Jelle Klaasen, Xiaochen Zong and Mathew Lee. I’ve known Jaein for a while now, so time to ask him some questions about his career in darts and what drives him to play all of these international tournaments (which obviously cost a lot). Please enjoy!\n\nJaein Oh at the WDF Winmau World Masters in 2022 in Assen, The Netherlands\n\nCan you write an introduction about yourself?\n\nHi I’m Jaein Oh from South Korea. I’m 24 years old. I live in Seongnam city. My name pronunciation is same to Jane, but I am a boy : )\n\nHow and when did you start playing darts?\n\nWhen I was 19. I worked at beer pub. There was a soft tip darts machine, so I first experienced it.\n\nCan you tell something more about the darts scene in South Korea?\n\nThere are two soft tip darts leagues in Korea:\n\n1. Dartslive Korea Stage\n\n2. Phoenixdarts Perfect Korea\n\nUnfortunately, Steel tip darts competitions are very few. Korea can do Soft tip darts, but Steel tip darts is hard to experience. When I practice Soft tip darts, I go to the Bar or Beer pub, The place where I go to practice is Magnum bar or Wero pub. These are located in Moran, Seongnam. When I practice steel tip darts, I usually practice at home using Nakka. Sometime I go to Wero pub because the owner hangs a steel tip darts board on the wall in the store for me.\n\nSteel tip darts is obviously less popular than soft tip darts in South Korea. Why do you think is that?\n\nSoft tip darts game can make money. When play the 501 games, we have to pay 1,000 won (0,61 pounds/0,71 euros) per leg. That’s it. And a lot of owners are concerned about the safety of Steel tip darts. So that’s why many people can’t experience about steel tip darts.\n\nYou play a lot of international tournaments (PDC Asian Tour, WDF Winmau Masters and Open, PDC World Youth Championship). What motivates you to travel all the way to play those tournaments?\n\nMy dream is to participate at the PDC World Championship. So I think I need more experience. It takes a lot of money to participate in international competitions, but I think I am investing for my dream\n\nAnd can you tell something about your best experience at an international darts tournament? What moment or match has been memorable to you?\n\nI remember a lot of matches. I have to choose the 2022 Winmau World Masters. Because I felt the wall from the world class players. That is make me more practice. (Jeain participated in the World Masters and Open where he played Jelle Klaasen).\n\nYou’re still young, how do you balance darts with work or studies?\n\nMy job in Korea is a traditionally rice cake baker. I have to get up very early. On Monday to Thursday, I work from 2am to 8pm. So I don’t have much sleeping time. I try to practice every day. I can sleep for 5 hours, but I use one hour to practice. I practice most of the time even on my day off.\n\nWhich darts player (or players) is or are your inspiration, and why?\n\nHyunchul Park. Because I think he is an all time legend in Korea. I’m a really big fan of him. He went to Japan for play darts, won the Japan Soft tip darts tournaments, and has a very good career in The World Softip darts tournaments and PDC Asian Tour.\n\nWhat are your goals and aspirations for your darting career in the coming years?\n\nMaybe not next month. Maybe not next year. But I promise. I will be World Champion\n\nYou also play the DARTSLIVE soft tip tournaments in South Korea. Can you tell something about those tournaments and your experience?\n\nI only participated in one stage and I need to play more games, but I know there are many good players in Korea playing these tournaments.\n\nDo you have a final message for the readers?\n\nHi I’m Jaein Oh. Thank you for reading the interview and if you want to know more about me follow my Instagram (jaeinohkr). Thank you!\n\nOut of all Asian players, Christian Perez has been the player with the most succes internationally in 2022: He qualified for the PDC Grand Slam as well as the PDC World Championship of Darts. Besides, he won 7 national titles in the Philippines and is now set to play the 2023 UK Q-School to try and secure his PDC Tour Card. Christian agreed with answering a couple of questions for AsianDarts.\n\nChristian, you have qualified and played at the PDC Grand Slam of Darts as well as the World Championship by winning the Asian Championship. How do you look back at the past 6 months of your career?\n\nI was really happy to qualify for these two major events of the PDC, the Grand Slam and World Darts Championship and also happy for being the 1st PDC Asian champion..the last six months were amazing. I spent a lot of my time travelling and away from my family I hope they would understand me being away..\n\nYou’ve also played the 2010, 2012 and 2015 PDC World Championships. How was the 2023 edition different for you and what stayed the same?\n\nIt is totally different. During those time the format we played is not the same as the format we play nowadays. I played the preliminary round before reaching the 1st round and the format was best of seven. The experience is great to be in the World Darts Championship, I am happy to be once again in WDC to play against the worlds best dart players.\n\nIn 2023 you will play PDC Q-School in the UK. How are you going to prepare for it?\n\nI always do my practice routine for the coming Q-School 2023..it is my long time dream to participate in this event and hopefully I can gain my tour card.
