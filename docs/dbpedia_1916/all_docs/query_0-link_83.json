        "text": "Gary Anderson headlines Friday's action as he begins his bid for a third World Championship title, with Jamie Lewis, Paul Nicholson, Danny Noppert and Chris Dobey also in action.\n\nMardle's One to Watch...\n\nHopefully it works out this way, but it's possible on Friday night the last game could be Gary Anderson up against Paul Nicholson.\n\nIf not, it's got to be Danny Noppert up against Royden Lam. I think Lam is playing the best steel tip darts of his life. He beat Gary Anderson at the Shanghai Masters and I think Noppert is a danger. That could be a real, tight game.\n\nMichael Barnard v Jose De Sousa\n\nDe Sousa battled through a bumper field at the South & West Europe Qualifier to secure his Ally Pally return, having previously lost to Devon Petersen in the 2012 preliminary round.\n\nBarnard is also making his second World Championship appearance after a ten-year hiatus, having lost 3-0 to Andy Hamilton in the opening round back in 2009.\n\nThe 42-year-old topped the Challenge Tour rankings but had already sealed his qualification via the Pro Tour Order of Merit, and he could take on Jermaine Wattimena in round two if he overcomes De Sousa.\n\nAlan Tabern v Raymond Smith\n\nFormer World Championship quarter-finalist Alan Tabern is also making his Alexandra Palace return after enjoying an impressive renaissance this year.\n\n'The Saint' made seven consecutive World Championship appearances between 2006 and 2012, and he takes on Australian qualifier Raymond Smith, who secured his World Championship debut via the DPA Australian Pro Tour rankings.\n\nSmith also reached the quarter-finals of August's Brisbane Masters, although the winner of this tie faces the ominous prospect of taking on Michael van Gerwen in round-two.\n\nPaul Nicholson v Kevin Burness\n\nPaul Nicholson makes his first World Championship appearance since 2015 when he plays Northern Ireland's Kevin Burness in round-one.\n\nNicholson qualified for both the UK Open and European Championship this year, while his Ally Pally return has seen him reclaim a spot in the world's top 64.\n\nBurness secured his World Championship debut by defeating Mick McGowan 6-3 to win the 2018 Tom Kirby Memorial Irish Matchplay final, but Nicholson will be highly fancied to set up a second-round showdown against Gary Anderson.\n\nJamie Lewis v Schindler/Harris\n\nJamie Lewis took the darting world by storm last year to reach the World Championship semi-finals, despite only qualifying for the event by virtue of winning the third-place play-off at the PDPA qualifier.\n\nHowever, the Welshman produced his four highest televised averages in successive games to defeat Jonny Clayton, Peter Wright, James Richardson and Darren Webster to reach the last four.\n\nLewis returns to the Alexandra Palace as 28th seed this year, but he's struggled to kick on from his heroics twelve months ago; having reached just one semi-final on tour this year.\n\nEvening Session\n\nDanny Noppert v Royden Lam\n\nFriday's evening session kicks off with a clash between former Lakeside finalist Danny Noppert and Hong Kong's World Cup star Royden Lam.\n\n'Noppie' has enjoyed a fine debut year on the PDC circuit; following up a Pro Tour victory in Dublin by reaching the semi-finals of last month's Players Championship Finals.\n\nHowever, he's been handed a tough opener against Lam, who qualified courtesy of the inaugural PDC Asian Tour. The winner of this tie will take on former World Youth champion Max Hopp for a place in round three.\n\nSimon Stevenson v Ted Evetts\n\nSimon Stevenson and Ted Evetts collide for the right to take on two-time world champion Adrian Lewis in round-two.\n\nStevenson will feature in his second World Championship after losing to Zoran Lerchbacher in the 2017 preliminary-round, but after missing out last year, he confirmed his return via the Pro Tour Order of Merit.\n\nEvetts is set for his second straight World Championship appearance after qualifying via the Development Tour. The 21-year-old also finished as runner-up on the Challenge Tour Order of Merit, and will be bidding to register his first World Championship victory.\n\nChris Dobey v Boris Koltsov\n\nChris Dobey faces Russian qualifier Boris Koltsov in an intriguing opening-round tussle, with the winner set to play Steve Beaton in the second-round.\n\nDobey comes into this event in fine form; having reached his second major PDC quarter-final at the recent Players Championship Finals; beating Dave Chisnall and James Wade en route.\n\nRussia's World Cup captain Koltsov will compete in his third World Championship after he came through the EuroAsian Darts Corporation qualifier, where he whitewashed Aleksey Kadochnikov in nine straight legs.\n\nGary Anderson v Nicholson/Burness\n\nGary Anderson enters the fray on Friday evening at the Palace, as he kicks off his bid for a third World Championship crown.\n\n'The Flying Scotsman' has enjoyed a wonderful 2018; securing maiden titles at the UK Open, World Matchplay and the Champions League of Darts, and his Matchplay triumph saw him complete the much-coveted 'triple crown'.\n\nAnderson was beaten in the quarter-finals by Phil Taylor in 2018 as he struggled with a back injury, but he'll be quietly confident of reaching his fourth World Championship final in five years."
