        "text": "British Darts Organisation, World Darts Federation, Tri-Nations, and United Kingdom Darts Association\n\nEvents formally managed by The British Darts Organisation (BDO) from 1973 - 2020. The World Professional Darts Championship 2020 was the last event to be managed by the BDO before the company's collapse in September 2020.\n\nFrom 2021, two major events, the World Championships and the Masters, are now part of the World Darts Federation (WDF). The 2020 British Championships and British Classic are now part of the newly formed Tri-Nations. The British Inter-County Championships (BICC) has a new name, the National Darts League, and is part of the United Kingdom Darts Association (UKDA) from the 2021 - 2022 season.\n\nBDO History 1973 -2020\n\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was founded on 7 January 1973 by Olly Croft and was also a founder member of the World Darts Federation (WDF) which was formed in 1976. Initially, the BDO managed the England events, the England squad, as well as national events, included the World Masters, and the World Professional Championship. But following the withdrawal tobacco sponsorship in 2007, the BDO withdrew its support for England.\n\nIn 2007 England formed their own organisation' England Darts Organisation' (EDO) and joined the WDF in its own right.\n\nIn 2019 following a WDF ruling stated that the BDO didn't represent a home nation; England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland as they were all members of the WDF in their own right. The BDO membership was reduced associate member.\n\nThe BDO made additional changes in 2019 changing dartboard sponsorship and moved the iconic World Championship from the Lakeside venue to the O2 arena.\n\nThe 2020 World Championship was marred by the lack of sponsorship with the move, usually supported by Bob Potter's Lakeside complex. The result, the BDO vastly reduced the player's prize money. The full extent of the reduction, however, wasn't know until the championships had finished.\n\nMany of the top BDO players including the women dart players flocked to the PDC Q-School with expectations of winning a two year two card. The well structured PDC has a lucrative system with over Â£14M in prize money (2020). Several players were successful, including Lisa Ashton who became the first lady to win a tour card.\n\nThe BDO was instrumental in organising the British Country Championship (BICC). However, a lack of faith in the management lead to more than one challenge to take over the running of the events. In an open vote, the newly establishedÂ United Kingdom Dart Association (UKDA) came out the majority winner to manage the events from 2020 â 2021 season.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the BDO went into liquidation September 2020.\n\nBritish Darts Organisation (BDO) Event History\n\nThe detail below shows the history of events organised by the BDO from 1974 - 2020\n\nIn many cases, pairs, trebles and youth tournaments have been excluded from the tournament details listed on this page.\n\nThe Information below is correct to my knowledge at the time of publishing, however, use at your own risk. If you need a more in-depth information please contact the major governing bodies who may be able to help your enquiry better than I am able to.\n\nThe British Darts Organisation (BDO) was one of the oldest Darts Organisations in the World; however, it certainly wasn't the first. Listed below are some of the significant tournament winners organised by the BDO.\n\nI haven't listed runners-up, pairs or mixed pairs on this page or any another page on this website so although you may find this page informative, there is vast amount information left in the BDO archive.\n\nQuick Table Links\n\nWorld Champions Men | World Champions Women | World Champions Youth | World Masters | World Masters Youth | World Trophy | British Internationals Table Men | British Internationals Table Women | British Open | British Classic | Gold Cup | BICC Champions Cup / UKDA\n\nWorld Darts Champions (Men)\n\nBritish Darts Organisation World Darts Champions (Men) 1978 -2020\n\nBDO / WDO World Championships Main Sponsors:\n\nEmbassy Tobacco 1978 - 2003, Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter) 2003 - 2019, 2020 - ?\n\nThe first nine-dart leg achieved in the BDO World Darts Championship was by Paul Lim (USA) in the second round of the 1990 Championships against Irishman Jack McKenna. Paul won Â£52,000 for his achievement. Since then the BDO World Championships has not seen another nine-dart leg achieved but serval have come close.\n\nWorld Darts Federation - 2022\n\n2020 was the last event organised by the BDO. The WDF took up the reigns for the World Championship and Masters. However, due to COVID-19, major events were cancelled. The first WDF World Championship, February 2022. The men's first prize was reduced from Â£100,000 to Â£50,000. However, the women's tournament is increased from Â£12,00 to Â£25,000. This detail excludes the chaos caused at the last BDO event when the expected prize money could not be met. The Men's Champion only received Â£23,000 and the Ladies Champions Â£10,000\n\nYear Winner sets sets Runner-up 2023 Andy Baetens 6 - 1 Chris Landman 2022 Neil Duff 5 - 4 Thibault Tricole 2021 Event didn't take place - - - COVID-19 2020 Wayne Warren 7 - 4 Jim Williams 2019 Glen Durrant 7 - 3 Scott Waites 2018 Glen Durrant 7 - 6 Mark McGeeney 2017 Glen Durrant 7 - 3 Danny Noppert 2016 Scott Waites 7 - 1 Jeff Smith 2015 Scott Mitchell 7 - 6 Martin Adams 2014 Stephen Bunting 7 - 4 Alan Norris 2013 Scott Waites 7 - 1 Tony O'Shea 2012 Christian Kist 7 - 5 Tony O'Shea 2011 Martin Adams 7 - 5 Dean Winstanley 2010 Martin Adams 7 - 5 Dave Chisnall 2009 Ted Hankey 7 - 6 Tony O'Shea 2008 Mark Webster 7 - 5 Simon Whitlock 2007 Martin Adams 7 - 6 Phil Nixon 2006 Jelle Klaasen 7 - 5 Raymond Van Barneveld 2005 Raymond Van Barnveld 6 - 2 Martin Adams 2004 Andy Fordham 6 - 3 Mervyn King 2003 Raymond Van Barneveld 6 - 3 Richie Davies 2002 Tony David 6 - 4 Mervyn King 2001 John Walton 6 - 2 Ted Hankey 2000 Ted Hankey 6 - 0 Ronnie Baxter 1999 Raymond Van Barneveld 6 - 5 Ronnie Baxter 1998 Raymond Van Barneveld 6 - 5 Richie Burnett 1997 Les Wallace 6 - 3 Marshall James 1996 Steve Beaton 6 - 3 Richie Burnett 1995 Richie Burnett 6 - 3 Raymond Van Barneveld 1994 John Part 6 - 0 Bobby George 1993 John Lowe 6 - 3 Alan Warriner 1992 Phil Taylor 6 - 5 Mike Gregory 1991 Dennis Priestley 6 - 0 Eric Bristow MBE 1990 Phil Taylor 6 - 1 Eric Bristow MBE 1989 Jocky Wilson 6 - 4 Eric Bristow MBE 1988 Bob Anderson 6 - 4 John Lowe 1987 John Lowe 6 - 4 Eric Bristow MBE 1986 Eric Bristow MBE 6 - 0 Dave Whitcombe 1985 Eric Bristow MBE 6 - 2 John Lowe 1984 Eric Bristow MBE 7 - 1 Dave Whitcombe 1983 Keith Deller 6 - 5 Eric Bristow MBE 1982 Jocky Wilson 5 - 3 John Lowe 1981 Eric Bristow MBE 5 - 1 John Lowe 1980 Eric Bristow MBE 5 - 3 Bobby George 1979 John Lowe 5 - 0 Leighton Rees 1978 Leighton Rees 11 - 7 John Lowe\n\nWorld Darts Champions (Women)\n\nBritish Darts Organisation World Darts Champions (Women)\n\nBDO / WDO World Championships Main Sponsors:\n\nEmbassy Tobacco 2001 - 2003, Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter) 2003 - 2019, 2020 - TBC\n\nSince the womenâs World Darts Championship was conceived in 2001 one woman has dominated the ladies darts scene, Trina Gulliver MBE. Trina's achievement of playing in all of the World Championships finals stages is something no other lady player can boast. Trina has won the womenâs World Championship title ten times to date and has been the runner-up on two occasions.\n\nTrina managed to make the BDO World Championship finals on all occasions. However, due to illness, she was unable to attend the 2020 tournament.\n\nThere has always been a debate on the best ladies player ever, I say no more her World Championship Record speaks for itself.\n\nWorld Darts Federation - 2022\n\n2020 was the last event organised by the BDO. The WDF took up the reigns for the World Championship and Masters. However, due to COVID-19, major events were cancelled. The first WDF World Championship, February 2022. The women's tournament first prize money is increased from Â£12,00 to Â£25,000. This detail excludes the chaos caused at the last BDO event when the expected prize money could not be met.

Until this point, the biggest accolade a youth player could hold was the World Masters title. The Masters introduced a joint boys and girls (Youth) Championship in 1986. In 1999 this was split into two separate titles one for boys the other girls.\n\nBDO classify a youth player of 18 years or younger, however, the PDC have revised their youth tournament age minimum 16 years â 23 years. Personally, 23 seems a little old for a youth player especially when Jelle Klassen won the BDO World Championship at the age of 21.\n\nWorld Darts Federation - 2022\n\nThe first WDF Youth World Championship, February 2022, will feature a boys and girls championship for the first time.\n\nTable below Boys / Girls to 2020 / Boys only form 2022\n\nYear Winner sets sets Runner-up 2023 Bradley Van der Velden 3 - 0 Adam Dee 2022 Bradly Roes 3 - 1 Charlie Large 2021 Event didn't take place - - - COVID-19 2020 Keane Barry 3 - 0 Leighton Bennett 2019 Leighton Bennett 3 - 0 Nathan Girvan 2018 Justin van Tergouw 3 - 1 Killian Heffeman 2017 Justin van Tergouw 3 - 0 Nathern Girven 2016 Joshua Richardson 3 - 2 Jordan Boyce 2015 Colin Roelofs 3 - 0 Harry Word\n\nWorld Darts Federation World Darts Champions (Girls)\n\nWDF World Darts Championships Main Sponsor:\n\n2022 Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter)\n\nYear Winner Sets Sets Runner-up 2023 Aurora Fochesato 2 - O Krisztina Turai 2022 Eleanor Caines 2 - O Wibke Rieman\n\nElkadart World Youth Singles\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, 1986-1989, Elkadarts sponsored a World Youth Singles Championship. The event was held alongside the Winmau Masters. At the time, the Winmau Masters were also billed as the World Championships and later World Championships World Masters. As it was known, the Elkadart World Youth Singles was later taken over by Winmau and formed part of the World Masters. Hence, the listed Elkadarts Youth winners were collectively referred to as the first winners of the new sponsored event. Here is a list of the Elkadarts World Youth Singles Champions. For the others that followed, please see the World Masters listing.\n\nYear Winner Score Score Runner-up 1989 Dennis Beisser 3 - 1 Peter van Tilburg 1988 Sean Dowling 3 - 2 Paul Linwood 1987 Sean Bell 3 - 1 Mark Day 1986 Harith Lim 3 - 0 Rowan Barry\n\nWorld Masters\n\nThe Masters is one of the longest-running international darts tournaments and has pre-dated the BDO World Championships by four years.\n\nThe Masters started in 1974 and was sponsored by Phonogram before Winmau took up the reigns from 1975 to 2019. The BDO changed its allegiance from the Winmau to One80. However, this was short-lived. Covid disrupted the event before the BDO went into liquidation in 2020.\n\nThe Masters returned under the WDF. Winmau then sponsored the event again in 2022 with a vastly reduced prize fund.\n\nFor those interested, the early Winmau World Masters programmes illustrate the event was the World Championship, causing some confusion, but the event was the World Masters. Elkadart also sponsored the Youth World Singles 1986-89, as it was called at the time, and the winners received a plaque and medal stating World Champion. The plague was a combined illustration of the Winmau programme and the Elkadart logo. It can be argued these were the first youth world champions. However, since 1990, the stage event has been part of the Winmau Masters Youth Masters.\n\nIn 2015, the BDO introduced a Youth World Champions held at Lakeside alongside the Men's and Women's World Championship. The Boys and Girls received a trophy and prize money.\n\nFormat\n\nThe format of the Masters is set-play. However, the sets are the best of 3 legs per set (first to 2) rather than the best of 5 (first to 3) in the World Darts Championships. Changes to formats are reviewed continuously, and sometimes these can be dictated by television coverage time, so it is also best to check with the governing body any tournament format in case it has changed.\n\nThe notable Men's event winner is Eric Bristow MBE, who has won 5 times. Trina Gulliver MBE has won the ladies event six times to date (2018)\n\nBefore 1999, the BDO Masters Youth Tournament was a combined event for boys and girls. See the above sponsorship and event details for 1986-89.\n\nWorld Darts Federation - 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Masters became a WDF tournament. However, the first event had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, Winmau once again sponsored the event. The 2023 was cancelled, seemingly due to lack of sponsorship.\n\nWorld Masters - Youth\n\nBDO World Trophy\n\nThe men’s tournament format consists of 32 BDO ranked and qualifying. The women’s 16 BDO ranked and qualifying players.\n\nThe match format is a straight knockout played in legs.\n\nBDO World Trophy - Men\n\nYear Winner Legs Legs Runner-up 2019 Jim Williams 8 - 6 Richard Veenstra 2018 Glen Durrant 10 - 7 Michael Unterbuchner 2017 Peter Machin 10 - 8 Martin Phillips 2016 Darryl Fitton 13 - 9 Peter Machin 2015 Geert De Vos 10 - 9 Jeffrey de Graaf 2014 James Wilson 13 - 11 Ross Montgomery\n\nBDO World Trophy - Women\n\nYear Winner Legs Legs Runner-up 2019 Lisa Ashton 6 - 2 Anastasia Dobromyslova 2018 Fallon Sherrock 6 - 3 Lorraine Winstanley 2017 Aileen de Graaf 6 - 2 Anastasia Dobromyslova 2016 Lisa Ashton 7 - 4 Deta Hedman 2015 Lisa Ashton 7 - 5 Anastasia Dobromyslova 2014 Anastasia Dobromyslova 9 - 7 Lisa Ashton\n\nBritish Internationals (Team Event)\n\nThe British Internationals were first in 1979. It is an annual darts event contested by the home countries of England, Scotland and Wales.
