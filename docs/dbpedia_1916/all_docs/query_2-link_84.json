        "text": "The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) Players Championship is one of the most hotly anticipated events in the world of darts. Taking place annually each November, it brings together the top professional dart players to compete for the coveted title in an action-packed tournament. With a grueling format, dramatic finishes, and the best players in the world battling it out, it has become a highlight of the PDC calendar.\n\nWhat is the PDC Players Championship Finals? The PDC Players Championship Finals is the event of the PDC Pro Tour, bringing together the top 64 players from the Players Championship Order of Merit. The 3-day event takes place each November at the Butlin’s Resort in Minehead. The Players Championship Finals has total prize money of £500,000. The champion takes home £100,000 and the runner-up wins £50,000.\n\nThe PDC Players Championship Final is the culmination of multiple non-televised tournaments competed throughout the year during the PDC Pro Tour. As the final tournament of the season, it offers one last chance for competitors to claim glory and ranking points before the PDC World Darts Championship. Keep reading to find out the history of the event, the format, and how players qualify for this tournament.\n\nHistory of the PDC Players Championship Finals\n\nThe PDC Players Championship Finals began in 2009 and was originally called the PDC Pro Tour Finals. The inaugural tournament took place at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, England, and was won by Phil Taylor who defeated Robert Thornton 16-9 in the final.\n\nThe event moved to Butlin’s Resort in Minehead, England in 2012 and was renamed the Players Championship Finals. Since then it has remained one of the highlights of the darting year, giving lower-ranked PDC players the chance to compete for a lucrative major title.\n\nThe tournament originally featured the top 32 players from the Players Championship Order of Merit. In 2016 the tournament pulled the top 64 players from the Players Championship Order of Merit. The Players Championship Order of Merit comprises prize money won in 30 Players Championship events held throughout the year on the PDC Pro Tour.\n\nPDC Players Championship Finals Format and Schedule\n\nThe Players Championship Finals uses a knockout format stretched across three days of intense competition:\n\nDay 1 – All 64 players compete in a series of best-of-11 leg first-round matches. The 32 winners progress to the second round later on Day 1, cutting the field in half.\n\nDay 2 – The remaining 32 players compete in second and third-round best-of-11 matches. By the end of Day 2, only 8 players remain.\n\nDay 3 – The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals take place on Day 3. The quarters and semis are best-of-19 legs.\n\nThe tournament format is straightforward:\n\nFirst round – best of 11 legs\n\nSecond round – best of 11 legs\n\nThird round – best of 19 legs\n\nFourth round – best of 19 legs\n\nQuarter-finals – best of 19 legs\n\nSemi-finals – best of 21 legs\n\nFinal – best of 21 legs\n\nAll matches are played in a straight knockout format with no seeding. This gives every player an equal chance, unlike the tiered seeding system used in TV majors.\n\nThe PDC Players Championship Finals has a prize fund of £500,000. This is distributed as follows:\n\nWinner (1) – £100,000\n\nRunner Up (1) – £50,000\n\nSemi-finalists (2) – £25,000 each\n\nQuarter-finalists (4) – £15,000 each\n\nLast 16 – Third Round (8) – £10,000 each\n\nLast 32 – Second Round (16) – £5,000 each\n\nLast 64 – First Round (32) – £2,500 each\n\nHow Players Qualify for the PDC Players Championship Finals\n\nGiven its status as one of the premier events, simply holding a tour card is not enough to gain entry into the Players Championship Finals. Players must earn qualification based on merit through consistently strong performances on the PDC Pro Tour.\n\nThe Players Championship consists of over 30 non-televised events held throughout the year during the PDC Pro Tour. A player’s results and prize money won at these events in the previous year are tracked by the PDC Players Championship Order of Merit. The top 64 players from the Players Championship Order of Merit are invited to compete at the Players Championship Final.\n\nMemorable Moments from the PDC Players Championship Finals\n\nThere have been some classic matches and dramatic moments at the PDC Players Championship Finals over the years:\n\nMichael van Gerwen has the most wins at the PDC Players Championship Finals with 7 titles.\n\nMervyn King has the most appearances at the PDC Players Championship Finals playing in all 15 tournaments held.\n\nIn 2018, Daryl Gurney defeated Michael van Gerwen 11-9 and ended Gerwen’s 22-match winning streak.\n\nIn 2022, Michael van Gerwen won the tournament by throwing a nine-dart finish in the final round against Rob Cross winning 11-6.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nDo the Players Championships get televised?\n\nNo. The Players Championship events are non-televised PDC floor tournaments.
