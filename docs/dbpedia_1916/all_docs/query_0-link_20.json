        "text": "PDC / WDF / BDO and WDDA World Champions\n\nThere are currently two recognised World Dart Champions the BDO / WDF Word Champion and the PDC World Champion. The first World Champion was Leighton Rees from Wales. Leighton beat John Lowe 11 legs to 7 and won Â£3,000. The final was played in legs not sets as it is today. The first World Championship was held at the 'Heart of the Midlands' nightclub in Nottingham before moving to the Jollees Club Stoke-on-Trent where it remained until 1985. From 1986 â 2019 the World Darts finals were held at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, Surrey. In 2020 the venue changed again to the iconic, O2 Arena, London.\n\n1992 saw a number of players split from the BDO and form their own darts organisation; The World Darts Council later to be renamed as the Professional Darts Corporation PDC (See History). In 1994 the PDC staged their first World Darts Championships to rival The BDO Championship. Many of the best names in darts at the time moved to form the WDC / PDC and it has always been a bitter rivalry of who is the best. Many now believe the PDC holds that title due to the amount of prize money it offers, currently five times that of the BDO.\n\nIn 2001 the BDO introduced the first women’s World Darts Championship. Trina Gulliver from England has won this event every year from 2001-2007. In 2008 Trina reached the final again but this time she was defeated by Russia's Anastasia Dobromyslova 2-0. Trina lost again in 2009 final to Francis Hoenselaar but regained her crown in 2010, 2011 and 2016. Trina qualified for the BDO managed World finals/.\n\nSadly in September 2020, the BDO went in liquidation. The World Darts Federation WDF then took over some of the major events previously managed by the BDO. The World Darts Championships and the World Masters United Kingdon Darts Association will run the former British County Championships which will now be known as the National League.\n\nThe lists below show the World Champions of past and present. Many dart fans can recall the World Champions but not many can name the runners-up or indeed the score final.\n\nFew darts players have dominated the sport, however, there are a couple of exceptions. Phil Taylor won 16 World Titles before retiring at the beginning of 2018. His record of World Titles will stand for many years to come and may never be beaten. On the ladies side of darts, Trina Gulliver MBE dominated the 2000’s a decade in which she won seven straight World Titles. To date Trina has won 10 World Champions Titles and who knows there might be more still to come.\n\nThree players have been awarded the British Empire Medal (MBE) for Services to darts and for their charitable fundraising work: Eric Bristow, Trina Gulliver and John Lowe (2019)\n\nPDC World Darts Champions\n\nProfessional Darts Corporation World Darts Champions\n\nPDC World Championships Main Sponsors:\n\n1994 - 1995 Skol International, 1995 - 1996 Proton Cars, 1996 - 1997 Vernons, 1998 - 2002 Skol International, 2003 - 2014 Ladbrokes, William Hill 2015 - 2022, Cazoo 2023, Paddy Power 2024 - Current\n\nThe highest average achieved in the televised stages of the PDC World Championship Finals is 114.05 set by Michael van Gerwen in the 2017 semi-finals. Michael beat Raymond van Barneveld who also set the highest losing average at the championships, 109.34\n\nPhil Taylor recorded a three dart average of 110.94 in the 2009 final. The highest ever for any major darts championship final.\n\nThe 2017 final also broke the most 180’s hit in any darts match, a total of 42. Michael van Gerwen hit 20, 180's while Gary Anderson hit 22, 180's\n\nAdrian Lewis hit a nine dart leg in the opening set of the Ladbrokes.com PDC World Darts Final in 2011. The first ever dart player to achieve this feat in a World Darts Final\n\nFor more information on PDC events please visit the PDC website\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2024 Luke Humphries 7 - 4 Luke Littler 2023 Michael Smith 7 - 4 Michael van Gerwen 2022 Peter Wright 7 - 5 Michael Smith 2021 Gerwyn Price 7 - 3 Gary Anderson 2020 Peter Wright 7 - 3 Michael van Gerwen 2019 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 3 Michael Smith 2018 Rob Cross 7 - 2 Phil Taylor 2017 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 3 Gary Anderson 2016 Gary Anderson 7 - 5 Adrian Lewis 2015 Gary Anderson 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2014 Michael van Gerwen 7 - 5 Peter Wright 2013 Phil Taylor 7 - 4 Michael van Gerwen 2012 Adrian Lewis 7 - 3 Andy Hamilton 2011 Adrian Lewis 7 - 5 Gary Anderson 2010 Phil Taylor 7 - 3 Simon Whitlock 2009 Phil Taylor 7 - 1 Raymond van Barneveld 2008 John Part 7 - 2 Kirk Shepherd 2007 Raymond Van Barneveld 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2006 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 Peter Manley 2005 Phil Taylor 7 - 4 Mark Dudbridge 2004 Phil Taylor 7 - 6 Kevin Painter 2003 John Part 7 - 6 Phil Taylor 2002 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 Peter Manley 2001 Phil Taylor 7 - 0 John Part 2000 Phil Taylor 7 - 3 Dennis Priestley 1999 Phil Taylor 6 - 2 Peter Manley 1998 Phil Taylor 6 - 0 Dennis Priestley 1997 Phil Taylor 6 - 3 Dennis Priestley 1996 Phil Taylor 6 - 4 Dennis Priestley 1995 Phil Taylor 6 - 2 Rod Harrington 1994 Dennis Priestley 6 - 1 Phil Taylor\n\nWDF World Darts Champions (Men)\n\nThe World Darts Federation (WDF) first World Championship was scheduled to be played in January 2022. However, it was postponed due to covid-19 and the fear of UK Government venue restrictions.\n\nThe WDF took over the World Championships following the demise of the British Darts Organisation (BDO).\n\nThe last BDO managed World Championships was held at the London O2 Arena, moving the tournament from the famous Lakeside venue. Many fans boycotted the event and thus caused additional issues, one being the expected prize fun was drastically reduced. As a further backlash, the management of the British County Darts Championships also changed.\n\nPast event winners can, however, can still be seen below.\n\nWorld Darts Federation World Darts Champions (Men)\n\nWDF World Darts Championships Main Sponsor:\n\n2022 Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter)\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2023 Andy Baetens 6 - 1 Chris Landman 2022 Neil Duff 5 - 4 Thibault Tricole\n\nBDO World Darts Champions (Men)\n\nBritish Darts Organisation World Darts Champions (Men)\n\nBDO / WDO World Championships Main Sponsors:\n\nEmbassy Tobacco 1978 - 2003, Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter) 2003 - 2019, 2020 - (Last BDO World Championship 2020)\n\nThe first nine-dart leg achieved in the BDO World Darts Championship was by Paul Lim (USA) in the second round of the 1990 Championships against Irishman Jack McKenna.

Trina's achievement of playing in all of the World Championships finals stages is something no other lady player can boast. Trina has won the womenâs World Championship title ten times to date and has been the runner-up on two occasions.

Until this point, the biggest accolade a youth player could hold was the Winmau Masters title. The masters introduced a joint boys and girls (Youth) Championship in 1986. In 1999 this was split into two separate titles one for boys the other girls.\n\nBDO classify a youth player of 18 years or younger, however, the PDC have revised their youth tournament age minimum 16 years â 23 years. Personally, 23 seems a little old for a youth player especially when Jelle Klassen won the BDO World Championship at the age of 21.\n\nPDC Youth World Champions\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2023 Luke Littler 6 - 4 Gian van Veen 2022 Josh Rock 6 - 1 Nathan Girvan 2021 Ted Evetts 6 - 4 Nathan Rafferty 2020 Bradley Brookes 6 - 5 Joe Davis 2019 Luke Humphries 6 - 0 Adam Gawlas 2018 Dimitri van den Bergh 6 - 3 Martin Schindler 2017 Dimitri van den Bergh 6 - 3 Josh Payne 2016 Corey Cadby 6 - 2 Berry van Peer 2015 Max Hopp 6 - 5 Nathan Aspinall 2014 Keegan Brown 6 - 4 Rowby-John Rodriguez 2013 Michael Smith 6 - 1 Ricky Evans 2012 James Hubbard 6 - 3 Michael van Gerwen 2011 Arron Monk 6 - 4 Michael van Gerwen\n\nWDF World Darts Champions (Boys)\n\nWorld Darts Federation World Darts Champions (Boys)\n\nWDF World Darts Championships Main Sponsor:\n\n2022 Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter)\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2023 Bradley Van der Velden 3 - 0 Adam Dee 2022 Bradly Roes 3 - 1 Charlie Large\n\nWDF World Darts Champions (Girls)\n\nWorld Darts Federation World Darts Champions (Girls)\n\nWDF World Darts Championships Main Sponsor:\n\n2022 Lakeside Country Club (Bob Potter)\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2023 Aurora Fochesato 2 - 0 Krisztina Turai 2022 Eleanor Cairnes 2 - 0 Wibke Rieman\n\nBDO Youth World Champions\n\n(Last BDO World Championship 2020)\n\nYear\n\nWinner\n\nSets\n\nSets\n\nRunner-up\n\n2020 Keane Barry 3 - 0 Leighton Bennett 2019 Leighton Bennett 3 - 0 Nathan Girvan 2018 Justin van Tergouw 3 - 1 Killian Heffeman 2017 Justin van Tergouw 3 - 0 Nathern Girven 2016 Joshua Richardson 3 - 2 Jordan Boyce 2015 Colin Roelofs 3 - 0 Harry Word\n\nElkadart World Youth Singles\n\nDuring the mid-1980s, 1986-1989, Elkadarts sponsored a World Youth Singles Championship. The event was held alongside the Winmau Masters. At the time, the Winmau Masters were also billed as the World Championships and later World Championships World Masters. As it was known, the Elkadart World Youth Singles was later taken over by Winmau and formed part of the World Masters. Hence, the listed Elkadarts Youth winners were collectively referred to as the first winners of the new sponsored event. Here is a list of the Elkadarts World Youth Singles Champions.

The World Disability Darts Association (WDDA) finally gained approval from the WDF and BDO for the reduce dartboard height for Wheelchair players, 137cm to the centre of the bullseye the rest is now history.\n\nThe Disability final is best of 5 legs played on a dual board set-up designed explicitly, so a wheelchair player and a standing player are competing directly against one another.\n\nThis event has now been replaced with the WDDA World Championships (Sponsored by Winmau). The WDDA Masters formed part of the sponsored Winmau (BDO) Masters. However, in 2019 the BDO gained a new sponsor for the Master and dartboards used across their events and the disability event was not part of the agenda. Winmau in their wisdom, moved the WDDA Master to the Netherlands and renamed the WDDA masters to the WDDA World Championships. I have kept the event history as one event because the qualifying path is the same.\n\nThis event has now been replaced with the WDDA World Championships (Sponsored by Winmau)\n\nWDDA World Masters 2014 -2018 / World Championships 2020 - Past Champions\n\nThe Masters was not played in 2019"
