        "text": "Profession: Darts Player\n\nBiography: Michael van Gerwen is a Dutch professional darts player who has won multiple titles, including three PDC World Championships, and is recognized for his fast-paced playing style and exceptional skill. Additionally, van Gerwen has held the world No. 1 position and is the second most successful PDC player after Phil Taylor.\n\nShifting from football to darts at age 13, van Gerwen was quick to collect youth titles. His talent led him to win events and tournaments both at the youth level and in the open category. His career took a significant turn when he became the youngest player to win the Winmau World Masters in 2006 at age 17.\n\nHis success waned somewhat until he moved to PDC in 2007. There, he defeated established players like Raymond van Barneveld and claimed his first major PDC title at the World Grand Prix in 2012. By 2014, he was the PDC World Championship winner and the world's No. 1 darts player.\n\nDuring the mid-2010s, van Gerwen's dominance was unmatched. He collected numerous titles, broke records, and had the most PDC Pro Tour event wins. His fast-paced approach and impressive performances in matches became his trademarks.\n\nOff the oche, van Gerwen married Daphne Govers in 2014, and the couple has two children. A PSV Eindhoven fan, van Gerwen was also knighted in the Netherlands.\n\nUp to 2024, he remains prominent in darts, reaching the World Championship quarterfinals and finishing as runner-up in the Players Championship Finals. He continues as a competitor in Premier League Darts.\n\nBorn: April 25, 1989\n\nBirthplace: Boxtel, Netherlands\n\nAge: 35 years old"
