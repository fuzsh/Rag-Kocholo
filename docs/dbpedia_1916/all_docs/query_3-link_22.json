        "text": "30. December\n\nPDC World Championship 13 - Quarterfinals, Evening\n\nThe quarterfinals of the evening sessions brought wins for Simon Whitlock and reigning champion Adrian Lewis who progressed to the semi-finals.\n\nWhitlock had no problems with Gary Anderson at all who not only because his well-known double trouble never really was in the match.\n\nLewis had got a clear lead in his match against Terry Jenkins but then suddenly lost focus and dropped off while Jenkins very much improved. Lewis managed to recover and won the match 5:3.\n\nThe World Championship takes a break on New Year's Eeve but will go on on 1. January 2012. Then the semi-finals between James Wade and Adrian Lewis and Andy Hamilton and Simon Whitlock will be played.\n\nPDC World Championship 13 - Quarterfinals, Afternoon\n\nGlobaldarts arrived back home from London just in time to watch the unbelievable thrilling quarterfinal between James Wade and John Part.\n\nJames Wade already had a 3:1 lead when John Part finally got going. The Canadian first draw level and then got into the lead. James Wade levelled again and the match went into a decisive Set which developed in a close head to head race. Finally a Sudden Death leg brought the decision and James Wade first crossed the finishing line while Part already waited on double tops. As Part said after the match: \"It was the greatest game I ever lost\".\n\nIn the first quarterfinal of the afternoon Andy Hamilton defeated with a once again impressive performance young Belgian Kim Huybrechts with 5:2. Hamilton threw 11 180s and had an average from over 100.\n\n29. December\n\nPDC World Championship 12 - Evening\n\nIn the evening the last three third round matches were played.\n\nIn the first match Simon Whitlock defeated Michael van Gerwen 4:3 but had to fear for his win. Whitlock already was 3:0 in the lead when van Gerwen started a comeback and won three sets in a row.\n\nDave Chisnall had no chance at all against Andy Hamilton - it almost looked as if the player who had eliminated Phil Taylor out of the tournament just had no energy left. Hamilton won the match 4:0.\n\nGary Anderson rushed through the last match of the evening against Colin Lloyd and soon led 3:0. Then Lloyd could win a set and celebrated in style. But it was impossible to stop Anderson who with an average of over 100 progressed into the quarterfinals.\n\nPDC World Championship 12 - Afternoon\n\nKim Huybrechts caused in the last afternoon match on day 12 of the PDC World Championship the next upset. The young Belgian who only started to play in the PDC this summer eliminated Paul Nicholson 4:1 from the tournament and progressed into the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the other afternoon matches James Wade whitewashed Steve Farmer 4:0 and three times World Champion John Part defeated Kevin Painter in a gripping match 4:2.\n\nReports - Day 12, Afternoon\n\n28. December\n\nPDC World Championship Day 11 - Evening\n\nThe first match of the evening was the last match of the second round and it once again was hard work for Gary Anderson who defeated in the end Devon Petersen from South Africa 4:2.\n\nThe third round started with the match between reigning World Champion Adrian Lewis and Wayne Jones and Lewis had no problem to win it. In the second last 16 match Terry Jenkins defeated Justin Pipe 4:1. As Jenkins said Justin's slow throw was no problem for him more help as it hindered him to rush his throw which sometimes affects his game.\n\nReports - Day 11, Evening\n\nStairs, stairs and - well, stairs...\n\nThere are a lot of stairs in London.\n\nAnd some are rather special!!!\n\nStairs, stairs and - well, stairs...\n\nPDC World Championship Day 11 - Afternoon\n\nThough all the afternoon matches ended 4:1 none was a really one sided match.\n\nMichael van Gerwen played with a lot of self-confidence while Mervyn King just was not able to use his chances - so now Michael van Gerwen is the only Dutch player still in the contest. He'll meet Simon Whitlock tomorrow evening.\n\nSimon Whitlock defeated Steve Beaton in the same fashion, Beaton was unable too to use the chances.\n\nIn the last match of the afternoon Colin Lloyd showed a strong performance to see off newcomer Scott Rand.\n\nReports - Day 11, Afternoon\n\n27. December\n\nPDC World Championship Day 10 - Evening\n\nIn the evening session Dave Chisnall caused the biggest upset in the history of the World Championship and eliminated the 15-times World Champion Phil Taylor with 4:1 from the tournament. Totally unusual for him Phil Taylor was unsure on the doubles. After the match Taylor admitted he had a problem with the heat on stage what never before had happened to him. Chisnall showed no nerves at all and seemed to totally umimpressed by his opponent.\n\nIn the other two matches of the evening Kim Huybrechts defeated James Richardson with 4:1 and Paul Nicholson lost not a single set against Alan Tabern.\n\nReports - Day 10, Evening\n\nPDC World Championship Day 10 - Afternoon\n\nIn the afternoon-session both Terry Jenkins and John Part convinced by their performances, which left their opponents Co Stompe and Richie Burnett not many chances. Stompe had an hand injury at his right hand as he had been bitten by a dog on Christmas Eve which might have restricted him. As Richie Burnett who missed just too many darts he never really was in the match. Both Jenkins and Part got an early 3:0 lead which was too much for their opponents.\n\nIn the last match of the afternoon-session Andy Hamilton und Vincent van der Voort led a neck and neck race in which in the end the better nerves of Hamilton prevailed.\n\nReports - Day 10, Afternoon\n\nWalk-On Girls\n\nThe Walk-On Girls are at least tonight not the two young Irish girls but Nicola Cowell and Sarah Tunnicliffe, whom we could see last during the Grand Slam.\n\nPDC World Championship\n\nToday the PDC World Champiponship will go on with more matches of the second round.\n\nBoth an afternoon- and an evening session will be played and hopefully we'll see some great matches. Tonigth both James Richardson who eliminated Raymond van Barneveld from the tournament and Phil Taylor will play.\n\n24. December\n\nMerry Christmas!!!\n\nPDC World Championship - Day 9\n\nOn the last evening before the Christmas break Kevin Painter and Mark Walsh played a very close match which in the end Kevin Painter could win 4:3.\n\nA very commanding James Wade met a rather weak playing Jelle Klaasen and defeated him 4:0. Klaasen only won four legs in the contest.\n\nThe last match of the evening brought another win for Steve Farmer who had eliminated Ronnie Baxter first round. This time after some initial difficulties in a not really good match he in the end defeated the young German player Kevin Münch.\n\n23. December\n\nPDC World Championship - Day 8\n\nOn the eigth evening of the World Championship the first three second round matches were played.\n\nThe evening started with the match between Wayne Jones and Roland Scholten which was dominated by Jones. Jones didn't play an outstanding match but Scholten is not really back yet in his old form and just couldn't keep up. He lost 0:4.\n\nIn the second match Adrian Lewis had some problems in winning over Robert Thornton duchzusetzen who again showed a good performance while Lewis was not brilliant but always hit when it really mattered.\n\nThe last match developed due to Justin Pipe into an epic battle. Wes Newton first had a clear lead but then had more and more problems to cope with Pipe's slow throw and looked slightly irritated. Pipe didn't let himself got worked up and won the match 4:3.\n\n22. December\n\nPDC World Championship - Day 7\n\nThe first three matches of day seven of the PDC World Championship were rather onesided. Only surprising was that both Scott Rand and Simon Whitlock - still affected by the broken bone in his ankle - had very clear wins. Both defeated their opponents 3:0 and dominated their matches. The same result had Canadian John Part against John Henderson, he as well dominted his match.\n\nThe last match of the evening between Steve Brown and Devon Petersen - and the last first round match - developed dramatically. Brown in the last set missed a match dart and South African Devon Petersen who started to play the Pro Tour this year used his chance. He'll now meet Gary Anderson in the second round.\n\nMatch Reports - 7.
