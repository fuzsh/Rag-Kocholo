        "text": "In Chinese culture, name plays an important role in Chinese people's life. Parents have a great responsibility to choose a good name for their baby. Chinese parents believe good names will bring good luck and fortune to their child.\n\nContent Preview\n\nChinese Names: Surname + Given Name\n\nChinese names consist of a family name and a given name. The family name comes first followed by a given name. Most family names are just one Chinese character. A few have two characters. Most given names have two characters, some have one, and very occasionally three are used.\n\nTop 10 Most Common Chinese Surnames\n\nChinese \"surnames\" (family name) come first when written, opposite to the Western name order. There are about 2,000 Chinese surnames in use today, but about half of all Han Chinese people share the same 19 surnames!\n\nThe most common surnames are Wang and Li (each with about 7% of China's population, compared to about 0.8% for Smith, the USA's most common surname). The next 8 in the top 10 most common Chinese surnames are: Zhang, Liu, Chen, Yang, Huang, Zhao, Wu, and Zhou.\n\nChanging Your Name After Marriage? In China, women don't change their surnames when they get married. And nowadays, kids' surnames can be the same as their mother's or father's (or they could take both, like a double-barreled surname). Traditionally, Chinese children always take their father's family name.\n\nChinese Given Names\n\nAlmost all Chinese given names are made up of one, two, or three Chinese characters, which are written after the surnames. Two-character given names are by far the most popular for most Chinese.\n\nVery few people have three characters for their given name. Some of these people have their mother's family name as the first character of their given names. For example, Daming whose family name is Li is called Lidaming. Chinese given names have many taboos. One of them is using the name of old relatives or just copying the name of a famous person or celebrity. Sons mustn't have the same names as their fathers.\n\nChinese Generation Names\n\nA Chinese generation name is one of the characters in a standard two-character Chinese given name, which is shared by the same generation, such as cousins or siblings. The character used can be the first or second one.\n\nIn a big traditional Chinese family, you will see many young boys or girls sharing the same generation character in their given names. Sometimes the boys will have one generation name and the girls another.\n\nFor example, æç¥é³ and æç¥ä¸½ share the same character 'ç¥'.\n\nCommon Chinese Names and Their Meanings\n\nGiven names of a certain year often commemorate some important event. Such as Jianguo ('Establish County') was used by many babies born during the year that Modern China was founded (1949). Most Chinese given names have meanings of 'happiness', 'beauty', 'fortune', or 'good wishes.\n\nPopular Chinese Female/Girl Names\n\nMost traditional Chinese female names are related to 'beauty', 'happiness', 'flowers', or 'jade'. Here are some top female names:\n\n1. Ai ç± â Love\n\n2. Fang è³ â Fragrance\n\n3. Jing é â calm/quiet\n\n4. Li ä¸½â pretty\n\n5. Min æâ nimble/clever\n\n6. Yan çâ swallow\n\n7. Xiu ç§âelegant/graceful\n\n8. Ya é â elegant\n\n9. Hua è±âflower\n\n10. Fen è¬âscent\n\n11. Xiang é¦â fragrance\n\n12. Chun æ¥âspring\n\n13.
