        "text": "THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951)\n\n“Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!” Robert Wise’s sci-fi classic represents one of the best films of the 1950s, in any genre. Klaatu, a gentlemanly emissary from another planet (played with great presence by Michael Rennie) lands his flying saucer on the National Mall in Washington, DC, to warn the people of Earth away from the dangers of atomic experimentation — not only for their sake, but for the galaxy’s! Unable to persuade the wary and warmongering nations of Earth, Klaatu is forced to employ more severe measures — including his giant robot, Gort! Tapping into Cold War and Atomic Age anxieties of the time, the film’s powerful antiwar message still resonates.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Edmund H. North, from a story by Harry Bates; PROD Julian Blaustein. US, 1951, b&w, 92 min, DCP. NOT RATED\n\nBLOOD ON THE MOON\n\nDrifter Robert Mitchum goes to work as a hired gun for old friend Robert Preston, the leader of a coalition of homesteaders embroiled in a heated range war against Tom Tully's ranching operation. But Mitchum's loyalty is shaken when he discovers Preston is working an angle to shake down Tully on a crooked land deal. Double-crosses, knockdown barroom fights and a climactic shootout pace director Robert Wise's action-packed Western, notable for its shadowy atmosphere, lensed by noir specialist Nicholas Musuraca.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Lillie Hayward, Harold Shumate, Luke Short, from “Gunman's Chance” by Short; PROD Theron Warth. US, 1948, b&w, 88 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nRUN SILENT, RUN DEEP\n\nSubmarine commander Rich Richardson (Clark Gable) drives the men of the USS Nerka to the point of mutiny in pursuit of his single-minded, Ahab-like quest to find and sink the Japanese destroyer that downed the previous ship in his command. Burt Lancaster is second-in-command Jim Bledsoe, bitter at having been passed over for the top job, and skeptical about Richardson’s tarnished war record. But after a new crisis traps the Nerka deep in enemy waters, Richardson earns the begrudging respect of his crew by rising to the occasion in Robert Wise’s bravura men-at-war actioner.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR John Gay, from the novel by Edward L. Beach, Jr.; PROD Harold Hecht, James Hill. US, 1958, b&w, 93 min, 35mm. RATED PG\n\nBORN TO KILL (1947)\n\nDangerous drifter Lawrence Tierney has a hair-trigger for violence, as those with the misfortune to cross his path discover. But that’s just what socialite Claire Trevor likes about him, a fatal attraction that leads them to carry on a dangerous affair even after she discovers he’s a cold-hearted killer — and even after he marries her foster sister Audrey Long. Walter Slezak delights as an eccentric gumshoe, and Elisha Cook, Jr., is in his accustomed role as a feckless hood in this stylish noir from Robert Wise.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Eve Greene, Richard Macaulay, from the novel “Deadlier Than the Male” by James Gunn; PROD Herman Schlom. US, 1947, b&w, 92 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nTHE SET-UP\n\nBoxer Bill “Stoker” Thompson (Robert Ryan) may be over the hill, but he’s not ready to throw in the towel just yet, despite the protestations of his wife, Julie (Audrey Totter). A poorly favored underdog for his next fight, he’s shocked to learn after the first round that his feckless manager Tiny (George Tobias) has made a deal with gamblers to throw the bout. Now Stoker is battling not only his much younger opponent in the ring, but the underworld lowlifes who have sold him out, and the clock itself, in this gripping, “real-time” drama, which plays out round by round almost precisely in sync with the film’s run time.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Art Cohn, from the poem by Joseph Moncure March; PROD Richard Goldstone. US, 1949, b&w, 73 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nODDS AGAINST TOMORROW\n\nLegendary actor/musician/humanitarian Harry Belafonte starred in and co-produced this incendiary crime classic. He plays jazz musician Johnny Ingram, whose gambling debts lead him to take part in a bank job with surly racist Earle Slater (Robert Ryan, in a performance both ferocious and sad). The film also features a landmark score by jazz greats John Lewis and the Modern Jazz Quartet, bolstering Robert Wise’s tight and tense direction. (Note courtesy of Noir City.)\n\nDIR/PROD Robert Wise; SCR Abraham Polonsky, Nelson Gidding, from the novel by William P. McGivern; PROD Harry Belafonte. US, 1959, b&w, 96 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nTHE BODY SNATCHER (1945)\n\n\"You'll never get rid of me, Toddy.\" Pioneer anatomist Henry Daniell finally tires of cab driver/grave robber Boris Karloff's taunts, but then finds he may have gone a corpse too far. Produced by Val Lewton, RKO's genius of low-budget atmospherics, this was based on Robert Louis Stevenson's story inspired by the infamous Burke and Hare case. Final pairing of horror icons Karloff and Bela Lugosi.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Philip MacDonald, from the story by Robert Louis Stevenson; SCR/PROD Val Lewton. US, 1945, b&w, 77 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nTHE HOUSE ON TELEGRAPH HILL\n\nNear the end of WWII and the liberation of the concentration camps, a Polish internee, Victoria Kopwelska (Valentina Cortese), assumes the identity of her deceased friend, Karin, who had family in America. Leaving behind the wasteland of wartorn Europe, she is given safe passage to the States, where she meets a distant “relation,” Alan Spender (Richard Basehart), now the legal guardian to Karin’s son Christopher. After a whirlwind romance, she marries Spender and is soon ensconced in a San Francisco mansion, along with her longlost “son” and the boy’s devoted governess, Martha (Fay Baker). But just as Victoria is not who she pretends to be, what secrets might her new American family be hiding? A Gothic film noir chiller from Robert Wise; the atmospheric cinematography is by camera great Lucien Ballard.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Elick Moll, Frank Partos, based on the novel by Dana Lyon; PROD Robert Bassler. US, 1951, b&w, 93 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nI WANT TO LIVE!\n\nProstitute, party girl, perjurer, bad-check passer, petty criminal. She's all this and more…but is she a murderer? Robert Wise’s harrowing, hard-hitting chronicle of crime and punishment more than delivers on its breathless DVD description, as California convict Barbara Graham desperately fights to clear her name and escape the gas chamber. Susan Hayward won the Best Actress Oscar® for her gutsy performance in this nerve-shredding docudrama, based on the real-life Barbara Graham case.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Nelson Gidding, Don Mankiewicz; PROD Walter Wanger. US, 1958, b&w, 120 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nTHE ANDROMEDA STRAIN\n\nGovernment agents descend on the desert town of Piedmont, New Mexico, to retrieve the Scoop 7 satellite that has crash-landed there, only to discover that the town’s entire population has mysteriously died, save for a 62-year-old vagrant and a six-month-old infant. Fearing a viral epidemic alien in origin, an elite team of scientists are dispatched to a top-secret underground lab to examine the satellite and diagnose the mysterious germs it may be carrying, in a race against the clock to save the human race, or die trying. Special effects by sci-fi specialist Douglas Trumbull (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, BLADE RUNNER).\n\nDIR/PROD Robert Wise; SCR Nelson Gidding, from the novel by Michael Crichton. US, 1971, color, 131 min, DCP. RATED G\n\nTHE HAUNTING (1963)\n\n\"Scandal, murder, insanity, suicide…the history of Hill House had everything I wanted. It was an evil house from the beginning…a house that was born bad.\" Robert Wise's iconic haunted house film, based on Shirley Jackson's novel \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" still sets the standard for atmospheric fright-making, inducing the viewer to imagine more than what's shown. A team of paranormal activity investigators, including anthropologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson), two psychics — the brassy, lesbian Theodora (Claire Bloom) and shy, retiring Eleanor Lance (Julie Harris), a powerful, but highly suggestible, empath — and the mansion's potential heir, playboy Luke Sanderson (Russ Tamblyn), sets up camp in the house, the first guests the house has had in years. But will they become the house's latest victims?\n\nDIR/PROD Robert Wise; SCR Nelson Gidding, from the novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" by Shirley Jackson. US/UK, 1963, b&w, 112 min, 35mm. NOT RATED\n\nSTAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE\n\n35th Anniversary!\n\nThe Director's Cut\n\nThe human adventure is just beginning. Robert Wise guided the Starship Enterprise’s maiden voyage into feature films, launching what would become a hugely successful movie franchise (five features with the original cast, four with the cast of THE NEXT GENERATION, and now two from the recent reboot), as well as fostering enthusiasm for the series’ eventual return to television, with the first of what would become four successor TV series arriving in 1987. Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner), now the earthbound Chief of Starfleet Operations, returns to helm a newly revamped Enterprise and intercept a mysterious alien presence called V'Ger before it reaches Earth. Oscar®-nominated visual effects by Douglas Trumbull.\n\nDIR Robert Wise; SCR Harold Livingston, Alan Dean Foster, from the Gene Roddenberry-created series; PROD Gene Roddenberry. US, 1979, color, 132 min, DVCam. RATED PG\n\nWEST SIDE STORY\n\nIn 70mm!\n\nSharks! Jets! Ten Oscar® wins, including Best Picture, for the dazzling screen adaptation of Broadway's \"Romeo and Juliet\"-inspired musical smash, a tale of forbidden love starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer. Unforgettable for the brilliant Leonard Bernstein-Stephen Sondheim score (with songs including \"Maria,\" \"Tonight\" and \"America\") and Jerome Robbins' vibrant choreography, featuring the Oscar®-winning footwork of George Chakiris and Rita Moreno.\n\nDIR/PROD Robert Wise; DIR Jerome Robbins; SCR Ernest Lehman, from the musical by Arthur Laurents and Jerome Robbins, music and lyrics by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim. US, 1961, color, 151 min, 70mm. NOT RATED\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSIC\n\n#40 on AFI's 100 Years…100 Movies\n\n#4 on AFI's 100 Years of Musicals\n\n#10, #64, and #88 on AFI's 100 Years…100 Songs\n\nQuite simply one of the most successful and best-loved movies in motion picture history. Ernest Lehman's screenplay made crucial changes to Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway production, including having Julie Andrews' Maria sing \"My Favorite Things\" to the von Trapp kids (instead of the Mother Abbess singing it to Maria), while director Robert Wise and associate producer Saul Chaplin thrillingly transplanted the performance of \"Do-Re-Mi\" from indoors to all over Salzburg. Five wins among 10 Oscar® nominations, including Best Picture and Director for Wise.\n\nDIR/PROD Robert Wise; SCR Ernest Lehman, from the musical by Howard Lindsay, Russel Crouse, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. US, 1965, color, 184 min including 10-min intermission, DCP. RATED G"
