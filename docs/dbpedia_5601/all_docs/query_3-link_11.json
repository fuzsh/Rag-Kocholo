        "text": "WISE in 1901\n\nThere were 84 with this surname in Ireland in 1901. The surname is ranked 4416th in Ireland in the same year, MURPHY is ranked 1st since it is the most common Irish surname.\n\nReligion: Anglican: 40 (47.62%), Catholic: 39 (46.43%), Other / Not Given: 3 (3.57%), Protestant: 2 (2.38%)\n\nWhen producing these maps, I use the exact spelling in the 1901/1911 Irish Census, with the following exceptions: All surnames are converted to their uppercase equivalents. I replace all occurrences of MC and M' with MAC. And I remove all non-alphabetical characters, such as hyphens, spaces, apostrophes and accents. This results, for example, in the names Mac Vey and McVey appearing together on the same map as MACVEY. Likewise, O'Neill, Oneill, ONeill and Ó Néill appear together as ONEILL and D'Arcy and Darcy are combined as DARCY. No other type of grouping is done.\n\nA huge amount of effort has gone into the production of these maps and I have been very careful to ensure that the census data has been processed as accurately as possible. However, I take no responsibility should I have failed in any way in this regard. Nor shall I be held responsible for any errors on the official census website. As stated, the census is available online enabling you to confirm the information presented here for yourself. Enjoy!"
