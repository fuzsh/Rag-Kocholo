        "text": "Everyone makes mistakes. And the fastest way to fix this one is by cancelling the transfer yourself. You can then set up a new transfer using the correct name.\n\nWhether or not you can cancel depends on how far along your transfer is in our system. So before you get started, check the status of your transfer.\n\nLog in to your Wise account\n\nGo to Home to see your activity list\n\nFind the transfer in question — it should be marked as pending\n\nYou can cancel if your transfer’s set up, your money’s on its way to us, or your money’s being processed.\n\nYou should still be able to cancel your transfer at these stages. We’ll send the money back to your bank account, and you can set up another transfer using the correct name.\n\nLearn how to cancel your transfer\n\nContact your recipient if you don’t see the cancel button, or your transfer’s complete.\n\nOur conversion process is fast — and sometimes it’s too late to cancel. Once it’s marked as complete, your transfer is out of Wise’s system and into the banking system. This means we can’t make any changes to it.\n\nSo if you don’t see the option to cancel:\n\nGet in touch with the person you’re paying\n\nTell them that you got their name wrong\n\nAsk them to contact their bank and find out whether the money can still be delivered, or whether their bank will send it back to Wise\n\nTip: If the bank sends your money back to us, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct name, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.\n\nLearn how long a refund takes\n\nIf the recipient’s bank asks for a name amendment letter\n\nIn rare cases, your recipient’s bank will ask Wise for a name amendment letter. Unfortunately, we can’t provide these. If that happens:\n\nGet in touch with the person you’re paying\n\nAsk them to contact their bank and tell them to reject the payment\n\nTheir bank will then send the money back to Wise\n\nOnce we’ve received the money from the bank, we’ll get in touch with you via email. You can then choose to set up your transfer with the correct name, or cancel your transfer and get a refund.\n\nIf you’re paying by Swift and your recipient's bank returns the money to us, you can only get a refund. We’ll send you an email asking to choose between a refund to your Wise balance or external bank account."
