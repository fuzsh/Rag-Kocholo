        "text": "Members of the South Orange-Maplewood community celebrated Robert Wise for his more than 20 years of service to the schools of South Orange and Maplewood as well as the Township of Maplewood, with a party at The Woodland on Friday, October 7.\n\nAlong with his recent part-time work with the Public Works Department in Maplewood, Wise has served as a custodian in three South Orange-Maplewood School District, becoming an integral part of the school community at each building.\n\nRead Lisa Mainardi’s profile of Wise here:\n\nRobert Wise\n\nRobert Wise was born and raised in South Carolina with his three brothers and three sisters.\n\nHe moved to Newark New Jersey in 1978, and then to East Orange and in 1995 he finally landed in Maplewood, New Jersey. And Maplewood is lucky to have him.\n\nRobert Wise is a dedicated and loyal civil servant in our community and has worked and volunteered in our schools, our parks, our political campaigns and our community buildings. Trained by two carpenters, his father and uncle, he was a natural and today he can fix anything and has been doing so in our schools for years.\n\nMr. Wise is a long-time South Orange-Maplewood School District custodian who has always displayed an uncommon concern for the welfare of all of the children in his schools. His employment here began in 1998 at Maplewood Middle School. Early on, he was reassigned to South Orange Middle School reporting to then-Vice Principal Chris Harrison. Harrison recognized Robert’s potential and skills and when he became Principal of Seth Boyden in 2003, he recruited Robert to work there. Soon after, Harrison encouraged and coached Robert in earning his Fireman’s Black Seal License, enabling him to serve as a Head Custodian.\n\nMr. Wise stayed at Seth Boyden for a decade and had a tremendous impact on the school’s environment. He volunteered extensively in Seth Boyden’s Strawberry Fields Teaching Garden, where each classroom maintains a garden, as well as its Habitat Garden for the study of birds, insects and plant species. His contribution was instrumental in supporting the school’s focus on Environment Based Learning, which has attracted many families and students to this demonstration school.\n\nMr. Wise was a key reason why children felt welcome at Seth Boyden. He had a habit of taking parents, students and teachers under his wing. He made every child in the building his own! He knew their names and spoke to them regularly. His heart was in everything he did.\n\nMr. Wise’s influence was evident in the Seth Boyden After School Enrichment Program where he taught Wise Carpentry and Boyden Builders classes — hands-on skills and creative fun. His behind-the-scenes support for the Seth Boyden 5th Grade Play was also invaluable, especially when he figured out how to make a kite fly through the auditorium and down to the stage.\n\nAfter Seth Boyden, Mr. Wise spent a brief time helping out at Columbia High School and finally in 2013 was asked to return back to Maplewood Middle School where he serves to this day. At Maplewood Middle School he is dedicated to maintaining a respectful, clean and rewarding environment for tweens and teens. He controls some of the valuable Cougar Cash, which he dispenses to children for earning good grades and making “Wise” choices. He goes above and beyond helping out where he can, including the MMS All School Musical, the MMS Outdoor Garden, and the Hub.\n\nDuring the Science Wing renovations, he made extra preparations to ensure that everyone stayed safe. He is aware of what needs to be done and what’s going on in his school. He is described by the middle schoolers, who adore him, as “The Man” and “the best janitor ever!”\n\nFor the last four years Bob Wise has been a part-time employee of the Township of Maplewood where he has worked at maintaining the township parks and buildings including DeHart Park and Community Center, the Burgdorff Cultural Center, the Tennis Courts, Orchard Park, Maplecrest Park and Memorial Park. Since the township purchased the Women’s Club in 2013 and renamed it The Woodland, Mr. Wise has worked tirelessly cleaning, fixing up and taking care of this historic landmark as if it were his own home.\n\nMr. Wise is a persistent advocate for the welfare of residents in the Seth Boyden neighborhood east of Springfield Avenue, urging Maplewood municipal officials to provide robust levels of fire, public works and police services. In support of these objectives, he has campaigned door-to-door for Mayor Vic Deluca and Township Committee members India Larrier and Ian Grodman, as well as former Township Committee members Marlon Brownlee, Kathy Leventhal, Ken Pettis and Fred Profeta.\n\nMr. Wise is a strong supporter of causes related to educational equity and Board of Education candidates committed to it. He’s been volunteering in local elections since the late 1990’s and has been active in registering people to vote, canvassing our neighborhoods and campaigning for candidates he believes in, including Mila Jasey when she ran for reelection to the Board of Education for two additional terms, as well as many of the Board candidates who followed.\n\nMr. Wise promises to continue his campaign work for Board of Education and Township Committee candidates who will, in his opinion, best serve the interests of Maplewood and South Orange residents.\n\nRobert Wise has five children: Barbara, Margaret, Michael, Brian and Felicia, and seven grandchildren. He is still going strong and has no plans to retire any time soon.\n\nTestimonials\n\n“During the beginning of my tenure as Principal of Seth Boyden, I noted that Mr. Wise consistently cared for the building and grounds the way one would take care of a child. He was a great support and a friend to me, the staff, the students, and the community.”\n\n– Mr. Mark J. Quiles, Principal of Seth Boyden Elementary School (2006-2016)\n\n“Mr. Robert Wise is an amazing individual who always seeks to make others around him better. He always goes above and beyond for his family, friends, community and school. I am so grateful to call Robert my friend.”\n\n-Marc Gold, MMS Assistant Principal (2014 – 2016) and MMS Special Ed Teacher (2009 – 2014)\n\n“Not only is Mr. Wise a wonderful friend of Seth Boyden families but especially for Strawberry Fields Garden. Summer after summer parents would arrive late in August to weed and prepare for the new year and he would already be there watching over the garden just as he has watched over all of our children even when they moved on to middle school.”\n\n– Maggie Tuohy, Seth Boyden Garden Teacher and Seth Boyden Parent\n\n“Bob Wise could not have been a more committed caretaker of the Seth Boyden school and its children. At Harvest Festival Time, he was there at 6 a.m. to unlock the door and there at 8 p.m. when the last of the clean-up crew left. On school days, he had a smile for every child, and for every adult. And he was always on the spot with advice, help and old-fashioned muscle: a custodian in every sense of the word. How much we all love and appreciate him!”\n\n– Tia Swanson, Former Seth Boyden PTA President\n\n“The children of our community have benefited in so many ways from Bob Wise’s service. He has been unwavering in his advocacy and activism on behalf of the children in the Seth Boyden community. His service every day in our schools – marked by his generosity, reassuring presence and compassion – has touched thousands of students. Our students are so fortunate to have “Mr. Wise” looking out for them. Thank You Bob!”\n\n– Elizabeth Baker, Board of Education President and Maplewood Middle School Parent\n\n“Robert Wise was among the handful of early supporters who saw the Woodland as more than just another Town building. It has become a valued asset for the community in no small part due to his efforts and dedication.”\n\n– Andrew Fishman, Director, Office of Cultural Affairs, Maplewood Township\n\n“Long-time district custodian who has always displayed an uncommon concern for the welfare of all the children in his schools. Strong supporter of causes related to educational equity and Board of Education candidates committed to it. Persistent advocate for the welfare of residents in the Seth Boyden neighborhood east of Springfield Avenue, urging Maplewood municipal officials to provide robust levels of fire, public service and police services.”\n\n– Steve Latz, Former Seth Boyden parent and Board of Education member\n\n“Mr. Wise is the unsung hero of Maplewood. I worked with him for years at Seth Boyden, and there was no greater priority for him than serving the children and teachers of that community. I have no doubt that he worked many more hours than he was paid for and he did so with warmth and devotion. He serves MMS and the town with the same level of commitment. Bob Wise is the hardest working man in Maplewood!”\n\n– Susie Adamson, 2016 BOE Candidate, Former Seth Boyden PTA President\n\n“I’ve known Bob for at least 10-15 years. When Bob worked at Seth Boyden he was an icon. Bob always knew what to do—he was responsible and always hard at work. He kept the school running so smoothly, but even more importantly, he made every child in that building his own! He knew their names and he always spoke to them. He even ran enrichment programs that filled up instantly! He was extremely dedicated and loved by the children. His heart was in everything he did.\n\n“I’ll never forget the time I was putting on a play at Seth Boyden. I needed a kite to fly from the back of the auditorium to the stage. Bob came in the auditorium and saw my struggle. He wasted no time. He went to work and he made my dream of Mary Poppins happen! The children in the production felt as if they were in a real Broadway show.\n\n“But that was Bob Wise! Things were important to him. Community mattered. When he left Seth Boyden his presence was dearly missed. Maplewood Middle School truly lucked out. The South Orange Maplewood School District will find him extremely — actually impossible — to replace.\n\n“He has given himself to our community for years — putting our schools first. He is a man of character!”\n\n– Carol West, Current Seth Boyden Teacher, Former Seth Boyden and MMS Parent.\n\n“Mr. Wise was the most helpful person when I started at Seth Boyden and always put a smile on my face!”\n\n– Susan Brody, Seth Boyden Teacher\n\n“Mr. Wise was the very first person I met when I went to visit Seth Boyden. He calmed my daughter and me down and showed us her classroom. I knew we would be in good hands. Thank you Mr. Wise for all you do for our community. You are a treasure!”\n\n– Sue Rexford, Former Seth Boyden and MMS Parent\n\n“Mr. Wise is one of the warmest, kindest people I know. I consider him to be a true friend to me and my son. When I was directing the after-school enrichment program, he was indispensable in coming to my rescue time and time again. Not only with supplying an extra ten chairs or a table at the very last minute (and helping with an after school program was definitely not in his job description), but even just showing up right when I happened to be overwhelmed with a mob of kids and pitching in or offering a smile and a few words of encouragement. And the kids. The kids would rush up to him, all taking at once like he was their long lost hero! And when it suddenly hit me that he could teach a class I badgered him until he finally agreed. You just can’t help but love this man. He lives up to his ‘B Wise’ name in everything he does.”\n\n– Andrea Correll, Past Director of the Seth Boyden PTA After School Enrichment Program and past Seth Boyden and MMS Parent.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. Wise, for always being a friendly and reassuring face at school over the years. We appreciate all that you have done for our family.”\n\n– Hannah, Sadie, Maeve, Lochlan, Maggy and Marty Touhy, Seth Boyden Family\n\n“Always a caring member of the community….(Shhh!! He even let me into the building after hours to get something I forgot which I needed to complete my homework.”\n\n– Clawson children, Seth Boyden and MMS Graduates\n\n“Can-do man! No problems only solutions no matter what time it is.”\n\n– Rene Clawson, Seth Boyden Parent, Maplewood Middle School Past Parent.\n\n“Happy to celebrate Mr. Wise anytime, for any reason!”\n\n– Rachel Eskin Fisher, Seth Boyden PTA Co-President and Seth Boyden Parent\n\n“Rene and I worked with Jonathan Poor and Jane Conrad as well as other parents with Mr. Wise on the 5th grade project to construct bird houses for the Seth Boyden School property.\n\n“Mr. Wise was fully engaged the full day that we worked with the 5th graders. He guided the students while they constructed their bird houses with manual hand tools. No power tools were permitted. He continued to guide and mentor the students for some weeks following the scheduled work day. The students were extremely proud of their creations.\n\n“How wonderful it was to witness his connection with the students and commitment to the community at large.\n\n“Mr. Wise has demonstrated to all of us that mentoring these students made Maplewood a better place to live, and future generations of Seth Boyden students can appreciate the generosity of Mr. Wise.”\n\n— Marvin Clawson"
