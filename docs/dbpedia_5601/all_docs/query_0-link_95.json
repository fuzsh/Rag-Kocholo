It is of Anglo-Saxon origin in pre 7th century , derived from a name applied to a \"learned person\". This person would have been regarded with fear and respect, and would have been consulted on legal issues and other matters of importance. It was sometimes used for someone who used the occult arts. The word \"wise\" derives from Olde English, pre 7th Century, \"wis\", meaning \"knowing\".\n\nIn the 11th Century the name of Johann se Wisa was recorded. The first recorded spelling as a family name is that of Aedwin Wise, which was dated 1176, in the \"Pipe Rolls of Devonshire\", during the reign of King Henry II.\n\nHenry Plantagenet, \"Henry II, King of England\" is the 27th Great Grandfather of Ken Wise\n\nWise Ancestor Origins\n\nMarion County, South Carolina\n\nUS Southern Colonies, British Carolina\n\nOrigins of Wises of Marion District, South Carolina\n\nThrough DNA testing, I have found that my Wise line comes from Arburthnott , Aberdeenshire, Scotland and was originally spelled Wyse.\n\nMost Distant Known DNA Ancestor\n\nAlexander Wyse/Wise Birthdate: circa 1620 Birthplace: Arbuthnott, Kincardineshire, Scotland, United Kingdom Death: ?

I-M253 originated 3,170 - 5,070 years ago. It is believed that it dispersed from Denmark. In Hungary, remains of nine individuals were uncovered, believed to have lived between 6,500 and 7,500 years ago, one was found to have carried the M253 SNP.\n\nHaplogroup I-M253\n\nHaplogroup I-M253\n\nThe haplogroup reaches its peak frequencies in Sweden (52 percent of males in Västra Götaland County) and western Finland (more than 50 percent in Satakunta province). In terms of national averages, I-M253 is found in 35–38 per cent of Swedish males, 32.8% of Danish males, about 31.5% of Norwegian males, and about 28% of Finnish males.\n\nI-M253 is found at its highest density in Northern Europe and other countries that experienced extensive migration from Northern Europe, either in the Migration Period, the Viking period or modern times. It is found in all places invaded by the ancient Germanic peoples and the Vikings.\n\nHaplogroup I-M253 is a primary branch of haplogroup I* (I-M170), which has been present in Europe since ancient times. The other primary branch of I* is I-M438, also known as I2.\n\nBefore a reclassification in 2008, the group was known as I1a, a name that has since been reassigned to a primary branch, haplogroup I-DF29. The other primary branches of I1 (M253) are I1b (S249/Z131) and I1c (Y18119/Z17925).\n\nOrigins-\n\nAccording to a study published in 2010, I-M253 originated between 3,170 and 5,000 years ago, in Chalcolithic Europe. A new study in 2015 estimated the origin as between 3,470 and 5,070 years ago or between 3,180 and 3,760 years ago, using two different techniques. It is suggested that it initially dispersed from the area that is now Denmark.\n\nA 2014 study in Hungary uncovered remains of nine individuals from the Linear Pottery culture, one of whom was found to have carried the M253 SNP which defines Haplogroup I1. This culture is thought to have been present between 6,500 and 7,500 years ago.\n\nAncestral Origins\n\nSCOTTISH CLANS\n\nCalder Crest: A hart’s head cabossed, Sable, attired Gules Motto: Be Mindful Lands: Cawdor Region: Highlands Historic Seat: Cawdor Castle, Nairn Clan Chief: None, armigerous clan\n\nCampbell of Cawdor Clan tartan (There is no registered tartan for this clan)\n\nCalder History The name comes from Caithness, its original form being ‘Caldell’.\n\nHugh de Cadella was a French Knight created Thane of Calder, now known as Cawdor, in Nairn. Hugh de Kaledouer witnessed a charter by William the Lion at Montrose between 1178 and 1198, and also the gift of a toft in Forfar to Willelmus de Haia.\n\nCalder is seen as a sept of the large and powerful Clan Campbell:\n\nCADDELL, CADELL, CALDER, CATTELL The name is geographical in origin and it appears in various forms in various parts of Scotland; Calder in Caithness, Lanarkshire, Inverness, Ayrshire, and Midlothian; Cadder is in Glasgow; Cawdor is in Nairn.\n\nIt is the last which has the Campbell connection; elsewhere in this volume will be found the story of Muriel, heiress of Cawdor or Calder, whose removal for safekeeping to Argyll as a child enabled her to marry John Campbell, younger son of the 2nd Earl of Argyll and thereby to found the important branch of the Campbells of Cawdor whose head, the Earl Cawdor, still possesses the old family seat of Cawdor Castle today.\n\nMuriel’s family would seem to be probably one of the incoming southerners, most likely Flemish, planted in Moray during the twelfth century to subdue the local tribes who had a constant history of rebellion. Many of them were expelled as a result, but not all and many of the incomers married into the families of the ancient possessors of the land to found new dynasties based upon the old. From an early stage the family held the position of Thane although any connection with Shakespeare’s Macbeth has immediately to be discounted.\n\nFirst on contemporary written record is Donald, Thane of Cawdor in 1295. (16) Thanes of Cawdor, xiii and 3). Then in 1310 King Robert the Bruce granted a charter of the Thanage to William Thane of Cawdor – ‘as had been the custom in the days of the Lord Alexander, King of Scots, of Blessed Memory’. (17) (Thanes of Cawdor, 3.)\n\nWith the arrival of Muriel and her Campbell husband her uncles at first made trouble but in due course all was dealt with and the Calders settled down under the new regime.\n\nLord Cawdor, today, is still referred to, by friends of the family, as ‘The Thane’.\n\nDescended from members of Clan Cambell\n\nDescended from members of Clan Stewart\n\nImage:Clan Tartans-7.png Descended from members of Clan Stewart\n\nImage:Clan Tartans-4.png Descended from members of Clan Stewart\n\nImage:Clan Tartans-51.jpg Descended from members of Clan MacGregor\n\nImage:Clan Tartans-14.gif Descended from members of Clan Duncan\n\nDescended from members of Clan Hay\n\n28th Great Grandfather\n\nImage:Scotland-327.jpg Malcolm Dunkeld aka MacDuff, \"Maol Chaluim mac Dhonnchaidh\" of Scotland; Malcolm III Ceannmore, King of the Scots, King of the Cumbrians\n\n33rd Great Grandfather\n\nImage:Clan Tartans-51.jpg Kenneth I MacAlpin is a member of Clan MacGregor\n\nImage:MacAlpin-41.jpg Gregor (Kenneth I) \"Giric, Cináed mac Ailpín, King of Picts and of Scotland\"\n\n\"Clan MacAlpine/MacAlpin/McAlpin\n\nOr House of Alpin\n\nThe Clan, originating from the House of Alpin has been recognised as an armigerous Clan in Scotland. However, on 17 April 2015, was provided approval, by the Lord Lyon, to conduct a Derbfine or Family Convention with the view to elect a Commander as Leader of Clan MacAlpine.\n\nThe House of Alpin, also known as the Alpínid dynasty, was the kin-group which ruled in Pictland and then the kingdom of Alba from the advent of Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín) in the 840s until the death of Malcolm II (Máel Coluim mac Cináeda) in 1034.\n\nKings traced their descent from Kenneth MacAlpin (and not from his father, Alpín mac Echdach), and Irish genealogies in the Book of Ballymote and the Book of Lecan refer to the kindred as Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín, prioritising descent from Kenneth.\"\n\nSiol Alpin-\n\nSiol Alpin (from Gaelic, Sìol Ailpein: Seed of Alpin) is a family of seven Scottish clans able to trace their descent from Alpin, father of Cináed mac Ailpín, King of the Picts, of whom the Scots tradition considered the first King of Scots. The seven clans that make up Siol Alpin are: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.\n\n40th Great Grandfather .Domnall mac Echdach Buide, King Domnall \"Brecc, Domnaill\", Donald Brecc; \"Donald I, The Speckled, King of Dalraida\" B. circa 600 in Dunolly Castle, Dal Riat, Scotland\n\nSouthern Pioneers\n\nKenneth Wise is Descended from Southern Pioneers\n\nKenneth Wise has Jewish Ancestry\n\nKenneth Wise has German Ancestry\n\nDescended from [Palantine Immigrants]\n\nCategory:Palatine Ancestors\n\nSpace:Settlement of Tulpehocken Pennsylvania by Palatine Germans from Schoharie, New York\n\nCategory:Swiss German and Mennonite Immigrants to Pennsylvania\n\nCategory:Pennsylvania Mennonite Immigrants\n\nCategory:Berks County, Pennsylvania\n\nProject:Baden-Württemberg\n\nAncestors & Relatives\n\nNotable Relatives\n\n14th Cousin twice removed, with 343 common ancestors\n\nReverend William Franklin \"Billy\" Graham Jr., Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire\n\nBorn 7 Nov 1918 in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. Died 21 Feb 2018 in Montreat, North Carolina, U.S.\n\n22 Great Grandfather [3]\n\nKing Charles (Capet), de Sicilia, de Napoli (French- \"le Boiteux\", Italian- \"lo Zoppo\"); Charles II, \"the Lame\" , King of Naples, King of Albania, Prince of Salerno, Prince of Achaea and Count of Anjou\n\nKing Charles II of France\n\nIn the year 1279, Charles II was responsible for the discovery of the Marble sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene.

Their children were taken from the reservations and forced into the white man's hair cuts, clothes and schools, for many years, until they were grown, \"civilized\" and graduated. They had their lives, land, religion and culture taken from them. They were forced to take \"help\" from the white man, so the white man could ease his conscience. He was forced to live in one place, to stop hunting. He learned to be sedintary, somethinghis people had never known. He was made to become dependant on alcohol. After all of this, he was blamed for being drunk, drugged, lazy and mooching of of the Federal Government.

I was born and raised in a Pennsylvania Dutch (German) based five county area. There was one African American family in the whole county, and they moved here in the 1970's, when I was young. I have been very good friends with several of the family members and adored the mother. Many people have given me a hard time over the majority of my adult life; as I had relationships only with African American men, frequented \"All Black clubs\", liked \"Black\" music, food, and affinty for African American Culture in general. 50 years into my life, I find in the lineage of the father that I never knew, a distant African Grandfather! I know many of my Southern Slave owning and racist family and ancestors would just have a FIT. Some of them even tried to hide it, after it was found by a genealogist that was hired. Apparently, he was worried that people (white) would look at him and the family differently, loose his \"good standing\" as a revered prominent Sherrif and have a stigma attached to the family. I'm SO GLAD that I have NONE of THAT in my heart. I hope that he has Peace now, in Heaven. I accept and am proud of ALL of my Ancestors, except for the enslaving of African Americans. There were too many Slave Owners. One is too many. I have found, easily, one hundred. I am MOST proud of my African and Mullato Ancestors. They perserved the hardest and most horrible of circumstance. So much so, that I am here, writing this, some near FOUR HUNDRED YEARS.... after he was first enslaved and sold/traded. He is VERY publicly known. He can be found by simply Googling him! He has his own Wikipedia page. Allow me to introduce you to him. One of my Greatest Heroes. My 9th Great Grandfather, Manuel Driggers.\n\n\" Manuell Driggus was at one time a slave or indentured servant owned by Francis Pott, a not so well-to-do English land owner in Magotha Bay, Northampton County, VA. Some say that Emmanuel Rodriguez was of African descent (whether Sub-Sahara or northern Africa is not known, perhaps he was Arabic). He was probably brought to Barbados or New Netherland where he was somewhat educated and allowed to become accustomed to the new world before he was taken to Virginia and purchased by Mr. Pott. This occurred sometime prior to 1645, when Northampton County records first show him purchasing a cow from Pott. Within a few years, after alternately being referred to as Rodriguez, Rodriges, Rodriggs, and Driggers; the name became Driggers, with some variations cropping up such as Driggus, Drigghouse etc. were spelled as they were pronounced. There has also been speculation that Emmanuel could have been of Portuguese descent, the product of a Portuguese (or Spanish) master and slave mother. Perhaps he was an African or Mid Easterner formerly owned by such a master. Emmanuel was apparently a very hard working, energetic person and eventually gained his freedom. He was to be known as the patriarch of the Driggers family in VA. He eventually traded for and bought land, was able to raise cattle, horses and tobacco and obtain freedom for himself and some of his children. \"\n\nAn End To Ethnicity Speculation - by Ken Wise\n\nAccording to the results of my FamilytreeDNA Test, I am 93% European with most of it being Scandinavian. I have approximately 2% each of Ashkenazi Jew, Native American Indian and Sub-Saharan African and 1% Iberian Peninsula (Portuguese/Spanish). My Mother's Paternal Mother's line is straight from Sweden, her Paternal Father's line is German Jewish straight from Prussia. My Father's Paternal line is Scottish. Welsh, English and Irish with most lines leading back to Scandinavians and Vikings. My Father's Maternal line is a Calder & Driggers line - Scottish and African with Native American Indian, the Driggers line. Having said that, I am 99% certain that the Iberian Peninsula is Portuguese in the Driggers line. I did some research on Angola and found that it was \"claimed\" and \"settled\" by the Portuguese in the mid 1500's. It can be most assuredly said that, as stated above, it is most likely that Emanuel \"Driggers\" Rodriquez was the product of a Portuguese Father and an African Mother. I would not, how ever, go as far as to say that his Father was the Slave Owner of his Mother. I did find research that stated that he came to Jamestowne as a Free Man and became indentured or enslaved there after. It is possible that we may never know the answer to that.\n\nFrom Blogspot Oh Susannah-\n\n\"So far I have a positive DNA matchup with Betsy Driggers Ivey, a descendent from the Iveys and Driggers of Northampton. She married into our Grandfather George Wise's mother's \"Peoples\" line. \" Oh Susannah Blogspot\n\nDescendant of Noble Houses\n\nMy Wise line leads to literally almost every Crowned Head of Europe, Persia, Babylonia, Saudi Arabia, Northern Egypt and Africa. The Trojans, Romans, Caesars, Carolingian, Greeks, England, Scotland, Wales, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Normandy, Germany, France, Spain, The Vikings, The Houses of David back to Noah, Methuselah, And Enoch. The lead to people like Alexander The Great, Abraham, Popes, Nebuchadnezzar and Ebeneezer. These are the men and women that are my Grandfathers and Grandmothers. I AM humbled in their shadow. [1]\n\nWE ARE THE CHOSEN:\n\nWe are the chosen. In each family there is one who seems called to find the ancestors. To put flesh on their bones and make them live again, to tell the family story and to feel that somehow they know and approve. Doing genealogy is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead, breathing life into all who have gone before. We are the storytellers of the tribe. All tribes have one. We have been called, as it were, by our genes. Those who have gone before cry out to us, \"Tell our story!\" So, we do. In finding them, we somehow find ourselves. How many graves have I stood before now and cried? I have lost count. How many times have I told the ancestors, \"You have a wonderful family; you would be proud of us.\" How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow there was love there for me? I cannot say. It goes beyond just documenting facts. It goes to who am I and why do I do the things I do. It goes to seeing a cemetery about to be lost forever to weeds and indifference and saying, \"I can't let this happen.\" The bones here are bones of my bone and flesh of my flesh. It goes to doing something about it. It goes to pride in what our ancestors were able to accomplish, how they contributed to what we are today. It goes to respecting their hardships and losses, their never giving in or giving up, their resoluteness to go on and build a life for their family. It goes to deep pride that the fathers fought and some died to make and keep us a Nation. It goes to a deep and immense understanding that they were doing it for us. It is of equal pride and love that our mothers struggled to give us birth. Without them we could not exist, and so we love each one, as far back as we can reach. That we might be born who we are. That we might remember them. So we do. With love and caring and scribing each fact of their existence, because we are they and they are the sum of who we are. So, as a scribe called, I tell the story of my family. It is up to that one called in the next generation to answer the call and take my place in the long line of family storytellers. That is why I do my family genealogy, and that is what calls those young and old to step up and restore the memory or greet those whom we had never known before.\n\n-Author Unknown\n\n[2] [3] [4] [5] [6]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Sources\n\n↑ Ancestry.com - Search Records of Col.
