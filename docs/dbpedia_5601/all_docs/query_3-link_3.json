        "text": "Wise History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nGermany\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe name Wise is part of the ancient legacy of the Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. Wise was a name used for a wise or learned person 1 2, having derived from the Old English word wis, meaning wise or knowledgeable. 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Wise family\n\nThe surname Wise was first found in Devon where they held a family seat anciently as Lords of the manor of Greston, at the time of the Conquest in 1066. \"The ancient knightly family of Wise of Mount Wise in Stoke Damerel (Devonport) was one of the oldest families in the west of England: one of this family was High Sheriff of Devonshire in 1612.\" 4\n\nAnother source confirms this history but in more detail. Sir Thomas Wise (c. 1576-1630), \"signalized his ownership by building a stately mansion on the craggy headland opposite the domain of the Edgcumbes, and calling it, with that imitation which is the sincerest flattery, ' Mount Wise.' All but the name has long passed into oblivion, and cannon frown and soldiers dwell where the manor-house once stood.\" 5\n\nJohann se Wisa was listed as an 11th century Old English Byname and Ã†dwin Wise was listed in the Pipe Rolls for Devon in 1176. Later Roger le Wis was found in the Pipe Rolls for Sussex in 1203. 6\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included: Elias le Wyse, Oxfordshire; and Henry le Wyse, Huntingdonshire. 3\n\nUp north in Scotland, \"William Wys was a canon of Moray in 1358, Thomas Wyse, canon of Caithness, 1381, and Robertas Wys was canon of the church of Aberdeen in 1386, 1391. Johannes Wyss on inquest in Stravelyn, 1411.\" 7\n\nOver in Ireland, the long-established Wyse family of St John's Manor, settled in Waterford city shortly after the Norman Conquest of Ireland. Later, John Wyse (died after 1499) was an Irish judge who held office as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Wise family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Wise research.

Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents. One person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. The recorded variations of Wise include Wise, Wyse and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Wise family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include\n\nMichael Wise (1648-1687), an English organist and composer, Organist and Choirmaster at Salisbury Cathedral (1668), Gentleman of the Chapel Royal (1676.)\n\nFrancis Wise (1695-1767), was an English archaeologist, born in the parish of All Saints, Oxford, son of Francis Wise, mercer, of Oxford. \"In December 1719 he was appointed under-keeper of the Bodleia...\n\nHenry Wise (1653-1738), was gardener to William III, Anne, and George I.

Although the search for opportunity and freedom from persecution abroad took the lives of many because of the cramped conditions and unsanitary nature of the vessels, the opportunity perceived in the growing colonies of North America beckoned. Many of the settlers who survived the journey went on to make important contributions to the transplanted cultures of their adopted countries.

By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Sapere aude\n\nMotto Translation: Dare to be wise.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Wise +\n\nHistory of the Wise and Wyse Families of South Carolina by Sybil Harmon.\n\nLooking Back: A Family History and Genealogy of and by Hazel Wise Huffman by Hazel Wise Huffman.\n\nThe Wise Family Chronicles by Ronnie W.
