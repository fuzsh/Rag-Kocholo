        "text": "The surname \"Wise\" has English, Scottish, and Jewish origins. 1. English: The English surname \"Wise\" derives from the Old English word \"wis,\" meaning \"wise\" or \"knowledgeable.\" It likely originated as an occupational name for a wise or learned person, such as a scholar, counselor, or scribe. 2. Scottish: In Scotland, \"Wise\" can be an anglicized form of the Gaelic surname \"MacGhillebhuidhe,\" which means \"son of the yellow-haired lad.\" Over time, this name may have been shortened and anglicized to \"Wise.\" 3. Jewish: \"Wise\" is also a Jewish surname, commonly of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. It was often adopted as a translation of the Yiddish surname \"Klugman,\" which means \"clever man\" or \"wise man\" in Yiddish. It is important to note that surnames can have multiple origins, and individual family histories may vary. It is always recommended to research specific family genealogy or consult with a professional genealogist for precise information about one's surname origin and history.\n\nTo learn more and discover fascinating details, unlock the full content.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nQuestion: Can I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?\n\nAnswer: Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.\n\nQuestion: How long do I have access to the content after purchase?\n\nAnswer: You have access to the content for 7 days.\n\nQuestion: Are there any hidden fees?\n\nAnswer: No, there are no hidden fees.
