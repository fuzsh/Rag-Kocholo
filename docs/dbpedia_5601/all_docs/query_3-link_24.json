Ironically, the astronomer was laid to rest in 1543 at Frombork Cathedral in Poland, where he had served as a canon and developed many of his scientific theories.Since Copernicus's death, numerous attempts have been made to locate his unmarked tomb in the Cathedral (even Napoleon ordered a search), but in 2005, scientists discovered a skeleton buried next to an altar known to have been tended by Copernicus. The skeleton was the right age, and a forensic reconstruction of the face resembled paintings of the 16th-century astronomer. Finally, DNA collected from the mystery bones matched the DNA from hair found inside a calendar that belonged to Copernicus. The scientists' efforts revealed that Copernicus's male lineage belongs to haplogroup R-M343.\n\nYour maternal lineage may be linked to Marie Antoinette\n\nBecause it is so dominant in the general European population, haplogroup H also appears quite frequently in the continent's royal houses. Marie Antoinette, an Austrian Hapsburg who married into the French royal family, inherited the haplogroup from her maternal ancestors. So did Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whose recorded genealogy traces his female line to Bavaria. Scientists also discovered that famed 16th century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus traced his maternal lineages to haplogroup H."
