The cast against him would be the high volume of just normal “recommend” films (10 of those).\n\nBest film: West Side Story. I sort of understand the eye-rolling when someone brings up The Sound of Music—but West Side Story is just flat-out beautiful to look at. Wise boldly infuses color, framing and avant-garde camera work like mise-en-scene obstruction and split diopter.\n\ntotal archiveable films: 14\n\ntop 100 films: 0\n\ntop 500 films: 1 (West Side Story)\n\ntop 100 films of the decade: 2 (West Side Story, The Haunting).\n\nmost overrated: Both The Sound of Music (#489 currently on TSPDT) and The Day the Earth Stood Still (#840 currently on TSPDT) are overrated at this point.\n\nmost underrated: The Haunting should be somewhere between 501-1000 on the TSPDT top 1000 and isn’t. I think some horror junkies dislike the A-movie shine big budgetness of The Haunting (this is the film Wise sandwiches between his big budget Oscar-Winning musicals) but it is faultlessly made.\n\ngem I want to spotlight : The Set-Up. The images speak for themselves- nobody ever would’ve guessed that the guy who made The Sound of Music also made one a superb film noir- but sure enough- and Robert Ryan gives one of the best performances in his storied career.\n\nstylistic innovations/traits: Wise was a polished Hollywood director who excelled in almost every genre. He made musicals of course (West Side Story, The Sound of Music), horror (The Haunting), Sci-fi (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Andromeda Strain), noir (Born to Kill, The Set-Up), war movies (Sand Pebbles, Run Silent, Run Deep). As I mentioned above when talking about West Side Story that while some of Wise’s films are stylistically stale (relative to others on this list)—West Side Story is a daring artistic expression of a film. Wise would brilliantly go to the split diopter (long before De Palma) and dutch angles in West Side Story and The Haunting, has a keen sense of framing (West Side Story, Sound of Music) and there’s a perfectly lit, painterly establishing long-shot used in both The Set-Up and West Side Story—two films separated by genre, 12 years, color, and budget.\n\ntop 10\n\nWest Side Story\n\nThe Haunting\n\nThe Sound of Music\n\nI Want to Live!\n\nThe Set-Up\n\nSand Pebbles\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n\nBorn to Kill\n\nThe Andromeda Strain\n\nSomebody Up There Likes Me\n\nBy year and grades\n\n1947- Born to Kill R 1948- Blood on the Moon R 1949- The Set-Up R 1951- The Day The Earth Stood Still R 1954- Executive Suite R 1956- Somebody Up There Likes Me R 1958- I Want to Live!
