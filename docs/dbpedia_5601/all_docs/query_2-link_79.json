I’ll have another post later today – I’m back in the office after a day at Comic-Con to appear on the Inglorious Treksperts panel there – and we have some good news for you therefrom.\n\nFirst up, the panel was great. Mark A. Altman, Daren Dochterman, Ashley Edward Miller, Rob Burnett and I a blast talking about Star Trek: The Motion Picture, a movie near and dear to each of us, which turns 40 this year.\n\nThe panel room at the Con was absolutely packed – a good full house – which was awesome to see. We showed rare clips related to the film, told interesting stories, and made a lot of people (including ourselves) laugh.\n\nYou will all be able to hear the panel for yourselves in the next few weeks, as it will be released as an official Inglorious Treksperts podcast (listen here or wherever your great podcasts are found). [Read on here...]\n\nBut the best news to come out of it is that Director’s Edition producer David C. Fein was on hand and announced during the panel that he and his remastering team are officially in discussions with Paramount about FINALLY bringing the Director’s Edition to Blu-ray and 4K in a proper upgraded remaster. More importantly, he was given permission to say this, which I think we can all take as a good sign. Naturally, the room erupted with excitement.\n\nNow, nothing is 100% so you guys all need to be patient. I will have more to say about this next week for reasons I’ll be able to better explain then.\n\nBut... the best thing all of you can do, if you want Robert Wise’s finished and preferred version of Star Trek: The Motion Picture to be released on Blu-ray and 4K, is to go on your social media feeds and spread the word. Show your excitement! Tag #StarTrek #TMPDE4K @ParamountMovies. Let the world know that you’re thrilled about this, that you want it to happen, and MOST IMPORTANTLY that you’ll buy it! That you’ll pre-order it the MOMENT it gets announced and goes up for sale. None of this, “Great, now I’ll wait until Black Friday to get it for $10!” Nope. Uh-uh, you’ve gotta put your money where your heart is on this one. Because if they put it out, and you guys all buy it, more (and better) Blu-ray and 4K product for the classic TOS and TNG movies could follow.\n\nAll right, there it is. Go forth, Trekkers, and let the world (and most importantly, @ParamountMovies) that you want this to happen!\n\nStay tuned...\n\n-Bill Hunt\n\n(You can follow Bill on social media at these links: Twitter and Facebook)"
