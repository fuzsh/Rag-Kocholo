        "text": "Jewish Last Names\n\nLast names are a relatively new phenomenon. In ancient times, many people were known by their first name only. Jews often added the names of their fathers or their mothers to their names, and still do today in religious situations, being called by their name “ben” (son of) or “bat” (daughter of) their parent’s name. Jews descended from the priestly groups of Cohens and Levis sometimes note this status in their name; indeed, variations of “Cohen” and “Levi” are the most common Jewish last names today.\n\nWithin the Jewish community, widespread adoption of last names was first seen after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, when many Jewish families adopted the names of their family’s hometowns as a surname. Baruch Spinoza evoked the name of Espinosa, a town in Spain from where his ancestors hailed. Many other Jews gained place-based surnames two hundred years later, when the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Joseph II decreed that his subjects adopt last names; the custom was seen at the time as modern.\n\nList of Common Jewish Last Names\n\nHere is a list of some common Jewish last names and their meanings.
