        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nRobert Earl Wise was born in Winchester, Indiana 105 years ago, the youngest son of a meat packer. As a youth Wise's favorite pastime was going to the movies. As a student at High School, he wrote humor and sports columns for the school's newspaper and was a member of the yearbook staff and poetry club. He would later win two Oscars as director for two of the most popular and enduring musicals of the 1960s, West Side Story 1961 and The Sound of Music 1965. Looking at his CV, he made movies in nearly all kind of genre's, and very successfully so, most of the time.\n\nWise initially sought a career in journalism and following graduation from high school attended Franklin College, a small liberal arts college south of Indianapolis, on a scholarship. In 1933, due to the family's poor financial situation during the Great Depression, Wise was unable to return to college for his second year and moved to Hollywood to begin a lifelong career in the film industry.\n\nWise's older brother, David, who had gone to Hollywood several years earlier and worked at RKO Pictures, found his younger brother a job in the shipping department at RKO. Wise worked odd jobs at the studio before moving into editing.\n\nWise began his movie career at RKO as a sound and music editor. In the 1930s, RKO was a small, budget-minded studio with \"a strong work ethic\" and \"willingness to take artistic risks\", which was fortunate for a newcomer to Hollywood such as Wise. At RKO, Wise became an assistant to T.K. Wood, the studio's head sound-effects editor. Wise's first screen credit was a ten-minute short subject called A Trip through Fijiland 1935, which was made from RKO footage salvaged from an abandoned feature film.\n\nAs Wise gained experience, he became more interested in editing film content, rather than sound, and went to work for RKO film editor William \"Billy\" Hamilton. Wise's first film as Hamilton's assistant was Alfred Santell's Winterset 1936. Wise continued to work with Hamilton on other films, including Stage Door 1937 and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle 1939.\n\nIn The Hunchback of Notre Dame 1939 and Fifth Avenue Girl 1939, Hamilton and Wise, as assistant film editor, shared screen credit; it was Wise's first credit on a feature film.\n\nWise's first solo film editing work was on Bachelor Mother 1939 and My Favorite Wife 1939.\n\nAt RKO, Wise worked with Orson Welles on Citizen Kane 1941 and was nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing. Wise was the film's last living crew member.\n\nFor Wise, connecting to the viewer was the \"most important part of making a film.\" Wise also had a reputation for a strong work ethic and budget-minded frugality.\n\nAt RKO, Wise got his first credited directing job in 1944 while working for Hollywood horror film producer Val Lewton. Wise replaced the original director (Gunther von Fritsch) on the horror film The Curse of the Cat People 1944, when it fell behind schedule.\n\nFrom there on Wise continued to direct movies on a regular basis up until 1979, plus another in 1989 and a TV-movie in 2000. Over the years he also became his own producer.\n\nWise suffered a heart attack and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where he died of heart failure in September 2005, four days after his 91st birthday.\n\nHere follows a reminder of some of Rober Wise's movies as director:\n\nThe Curse of the Cat People 1944, horror mystery drama starring Simone Simon, Kent Smith, Jane Randolph, Ann Carterand others.\n\nIts plot follows Amy, a young girl who befriends the ghost of her father's deceased first wife, Irena, a Serbian fashion designer who descended from a race of people who could transform into cats. The film, which marks Wise's first directing credit, is a sequel to Cat People 1942 and has many of the same characters. However, it is only tangentially related to its predecessor.\n\nThe Body Snatcher 1945, horror thriller chiller starring Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Henry Daniell, Edith Atwater\n\nand others.\n\nBased on the short story \"The Body Snatcher\" by Robert Louis Stevenson. The film's producer Val Lewton helped adapt the story for the screen, writing under the pen name of \"Carlos Keith\". The film was marketed with the tagline \"The screen's last word in shock sensation!\" The frequent mentions of Burke, Hare, and Dr. Knox, all refer to the West Port murders in 1828.\n\nIt was the last film to feature both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi.\n\nA Game of Death 1945, adventure thriller starring John Loder, Audrey Long, Edgar Barrier, Russell Wade and others.\n\nIt is a version of Richard Connell's short story, \"The Most Dangerous Game\", about a madman who hunts human prey on his personal island habitat.\n\nBorn to Kill 1947, crime drama noir starring Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Phillip Terry and others.\n\nRecently, critic Robert Weston said, \"This was the first and the nastiest of the noirs directed by Robert Wise ... Wise came to the genre with a background in the Val Lewton horror team and the expressionistic films of Orson Welles, so he was the right tool for the job when it came to film noir ... As the title suggests, Born to Kill is a film about the grimmest corners of the human condition, the wicked place where sex, corruption and violence join hands and rumba round in darkness. Director Robert Wise suggests that we all share a collective dark side, that one way or another we are all 'born to kill,' and in the final throw of the dice, only the incontrovertible laws of chance can set the record straight.\"\n\nBlood on the Moon 1948, a \"psychological\" western starring Robert Mitchum, Barbara Bel Geddes, Robert Preston, Walter Brennan and others.\n\nThe picture is based on the novel \"Gunman's Chance\" by Luke Short.\n\nVariety wrote: Blood on the Moon is a terse, tightly-drawn western drama. There's none of the formula approach to its story telling. Picture captures the crisp style used by Luke Short in writing his western novels...Picture's pace has a false sense of leisureliness that points up several tough moments of action. There is a deadly knock-down and drag-out fist fight between Mitchum and Preston; a long chase across snow-covered mountains and the climax gun battle between Preston's henchmen and Mitchum, Brennan and Bel Geddes that are loaded with suspense wallop\n\nThe Set-Up 1949, sport noir crime drama starring Robert Ryan, Audrey Totter, George Tobias, Alan Baxter and others.\n\nThe Set-Up was the last film Wise made for RKO, and he named it his favorite among the pictures he directed for the studio, as well as one of his top ten during his entire career.\n\nJefferson Hunter, in a summer 2008 essay for The Hudson Review, said: All through The Set-Up, we see confirmed the oldest of truisms about film, that it tells its stories best in images, in what can be shown—a crowd’s blood lust, the boxers’ awareness of what’s coming to them in the end—as opposed to what is spoken or narrated.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still 1951, Science Fiction Drama with a message, starring Michael Rennie, Patricia Neal, Hugh Marlowe, Sam Jaffe and others.\n\nThe storyline for The Day the Earth Stood Still involves a humanoid alien visitor named Klaatu that comes to Earth, accompanied by a powerful eight-foot tall robot, Gort, to deliver an important message that will affect the entire human race.\n\nIn 1995, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\nThe House on Telegraph Hill 1951, crime drama noir starring Richard Basehart, Valentina Cortese, William Lundigan, Fay Baker\n\nand others.\n\nThe hill in the title is San Francisco's Telegraph Hill, where much of the story takes place.\n\nRecently, film critic Dennis Schwartz generally liked the film, writing \"Robert Wise ably directs this Gothic film noir ... The stark black-and-white photography by Lucien Ballard, the good performances (especially by Basehart) and the intriguing plot developments kept me tuned in throughout even though it was slow going. Of personal interest, Basehart and the Italian actress Cortese met for the first time on this film, and fell in love and married\".\n\nThe Captive City 1952, crime drama noir starring John Forsythe, Joan Camden, Harold J. Kennedy, Marjorie Crossland and others.\n\nThe screenplay of The Captive City was inspired by the Kefauver Committee's hearings. The television broadcast of the hearings attracted huge public interest and educated a broad audience about the issues of municipal corruption and organized crime. The tremendous success of the broadcast led to the production of a whole cycle of \"exposé\" crime films dealing with the dismantling of complex criminal organizations by law enforcement. The Captive City had the blessing of senator Kefauver himself: Robert Wise took a print of the film to Washington D. C. to show to senator Kefauver, who not only endorsed it but even appears in the prologue and epilogue, cautioning audiences about the evils of organized crime.\n\nThe Desert Rats 1953, a war movie starring Richard Burton, James Mason, Robert Newton, Robert Douglas\n\nand others.\n\nThe film's storyline concerns the Siege of Tobruk in North Africa during World War II.\n\nExecutive Suite 1954, a drama in the company boardroom, starring William Holden, Barbara Stanwyck, June Allyson, Fredric March, Walter Pidgeon, Shelley Winters, Paul Douglas Louis Calhearn and others.\n\nThe plot depicts the internal struggle for control of a furniture manufacturing company after the unexpected death of the company's CEO.\n\nHelen of Troy 1956, historical adventure starring Stanley Baker, Rossana Podestà, Brigitte Bardot, Jacques Sernas and others.\n\nBased on Homer's \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\".\n\nTribute to a Bad Man 1956, western starring James Cagney (replacing Spencer Tracy), Don Dubbins, Stephen McNally, Irene Papas and others.\n\nAbout a rancher whose harsh enforcement of frontier justice alienates the woman he loves. It was based on the short story \"Hanging's for the Lucky\" by Jack Schaefer, the author of \"Shane\".\n\nSomebody Up There Likes Me 1956, biography sport drama starring Paul Newman, Pier Angeli, Everett Sloane, Eileen Heckart\n\nand others, including Sal Mineo and a movie dubuting Steve McQueen.\n\nBased on the life of middleweight boxing legend Rocky Graziano.\n\nRun Silent, Run Deep 1958, war drama starring Clark Gable, Burt Lancaster, Jack Warden, Brad Dexter and others.\n\nThe film is based on the novel of the same name by Commander (later Captain) Edward L. Beach Jr.. The title refers to \"silent running\", a submarine stealth tactic. The story describes World War II submarine warfare in the Pacific Ocean, and deals with themes of vengeance, endurance, courage, loyalty, and honor and how these can be tested during wartime.\n\nI Want to Live! 1958, biography crime drama starring Susan Hayward, Simon Oakland, Virginia Vincent, Theodore Bikel\n\nand others.\n\nIt tells the true story of a woman, Barbara Graham, an habitual criminal convicted of murder and facing execution.\n\nThe movie was adapted from letters written by Graham and newspaper articles written by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ed Montgomery. It presents a somewhat fictionalized version of the case showing a possibility of innocence concerning Graham. Today, the charge would be known as felony murder.\n\nOdds Against Tomorrow 1959, crima drama with racial tensions, starring Harry Belafonte, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame, Shelley Winters, Ed Begley and others.\n\nWise selected Abraham Polonsky to write the script, which is based on a novel of the same name by William P. McGivern. Blacklisted in those years, Polonsky had to use a front and John O. Killens was credited. Polonsky's screenwriting credit was restored in 1996 in his own name.\n\nOdds Against Tomorrow was the last time that Wise shot black-and-white film in the standard aspect ratio, a technique that gave his films a \"gritty realism\".\n\nWest Side Story 1961, a romantic musical drama starring Natalie Wood, George Chakiris, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and others.\n\nIt's ten Academy Awards make it the musical film with the most Academy wins, including Best Picture.\n\nTwo for the Seesaw 1962, a romantic drama starring Robert Mitchum, Shirley MacLaine, Edmon Ryan, Elisabeth Fraser and others.\n\nIt was adapted from the Broadway play written by William Gibson.\n\nThe Haunting 1963, horror chiller starring Julie Harris, Claire Bloom, Richard Johnson, Russ Tamblyn and others.\n\nAdapted by from the novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\" 1959 by Shirley Jackson.\n\nThe film depicts the experiences of a small group of people invited by a paranormal investigator to investigate a purportedly haunted house.\n\nIn 2010, The Guardian newspaper ranked it as the 13th-best horror film of all time.
