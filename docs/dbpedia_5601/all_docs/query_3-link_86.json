        "text": "There are different ways you can change your details on Wise depending on whether it’s on your personal or business account. Some of the details you might want to change include your address, date of birth, phone number, name, or email.\n\nRead on to see what you can and can't edit, and instructions on how to do it.\n\nWhat can I edit?\n\nHere’s what you can and can’t edit.\n\nName\n\nYou can’t change your name by yourself, but we can update your name for you in certain circumstances. We'll ask you to send us a photo or scan of the legal document showing your name change, like your marriage certificate or deed poll, and your ID if the name hasn’t been verified yet.\n\nPhone number\n\nYou can change your primary phone number, but if you have 2-step verification enabled, you’ll need to confirm your new number by text. You can't change your backup phone number or add a new one, but you can remove it.\n\nAddress\n\nYour address can usually be changed by following the steps below. Once you’ve changed your details there, we’ll be in touch if we need to verify your address again.\n\nIn some cases, you won’t be able to change it yourself — if the address field is greyed out, then get in touch and we’ll help update it.\n\nChanging your address if you live in, are moving to, or moving out of Japan\n\nEmail address\n\nYou can change your email address yourself on both the web and app.\n\nDate of birth\n\nYou can’t change your date of birth after you’ve completed your first transfer because we’ve already verified you. You should be able to change it before your first transfer if you’ve made a mistake.\n\nIf you’ve managed to send a transfer with a mistake in your date of birth, you’ll need to send us your document showing the correct date and we’ll help you update it.\n\nHow do I edit my details?\n\nIt depends on if you have a business or personal account.\n\nPersonal account\n\nIf you only have a personal account, here’s how to access and change your details.\n\nWeb\n\nSelect your name in the top right corner\n\nSelect Your details\n\nSelect Edit details\n\nEnter your password and go on Edit details once more\n\nYou’ll now see what you can edit. Anything greyed out means you can’t change it yourself — you’ll need to get in touch and we’ll help update it.\n\nApp\n\nGo to your initials or picture at the top\n\nSelect Personal details\n\nEdit your details and Save\n\nPersonal and Business account\n\nYou can only edit your personal details from your personal account. So if you’re on your business account, you’ll need to switch over by selecting your business name or icon on the top, then choosing your personal account.\n\nThose changes will be carried over to your business account, too. But if you change your personal address, it won't change your business address, because that’s linked to where your business is registered.\n\nBusiness account\n\nIf you only have a business account but need to edit your personal details:\n\nWeb\n\nSelect your business name in the top right corner\n\nSelect Settings\n\nSelect Personal details\n\nSelect Edit your details\n\nIf you can’t edit your personal details from your business account, it might be because you’ve already got a personal account. Follow the steps above to switch to your personal account first and edit your details from there."
