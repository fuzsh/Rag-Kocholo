        "text": "Weis History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nGermany\n\nThe surname Weis is a Bavarian nickname surname. German nicknames came from eke-names, or added names, and tended to describe a physical characteristic or other attribute of their initial bearer. Weis is a name for a person who had a pale complexion or fair colored hair. The surname Weis was derived from the German word weises, which meant white.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Weis family\n\nThe surname Weis was first found in Bavaria, where the name gained a significant reputation for its contribution to the emerging mediaeval society. It later became more prominent as many branches of the same house acquired distant estates and branches, some in foreign countries, always elevating their social status by their great contributions to society. Chronicles first mention Nicolaus Weiser of Iglau in Bohemia in 1378.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Weis family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Weis research. Another 180 words (13 lines of text) covering the years 1642, 1662, 1696, 1708, 1709, 1746, 1760, 1798, 1810, 1830, 1840, 1841, 1842, 1844, 1852 and 1867 are included under the topic Early Weis History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nWeis Spelling Variations\n\nMany cultural groups lived in the German states in medieval times. Each had its own dialect and traditions, and unique variations of popular names. Low German, which is similar to contemporary Dutch, was spoken in Westphalia. German names are characterized by additions such as regional suffixes and phrases that tell something about the origin or background of its original bearer. Further contributing to the variation in German names was the fact that there were no spelling rules in medieval times: scribes recorded names according to their sound. The recorded spelling variations of Weis include Weise, Weis, Weiser, Wise and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Weis family\n\nProminent among members of the name Weis in this period include\n\nChristian Weise (1642-1708), who was a renowned German author of moral tragedies, poetry, and comedies.

Many Bavarians made the long trip to escape poverty or persecution based on their religious beliefs. The chance for tenant farmers to own their own land was also a major drawing card. They settled all across the United States in Pennsylvania, Texas, New York, Illinois, and California. Many came to Canada also, settling in Ontario and the prairie provinces.
