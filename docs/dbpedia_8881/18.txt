Pyongyang is the capital and the largest city in North Korea. It is situated on the banks of the Taedong river, about 70 miles east of the Yellow Sea shores. It is believed that the city was established in the 10th century BC by the local king dynasty, but during its long history, the settlement was destroyed a few times. The modern Pyongyang was assigned as the capital city in the middle of the last century when the two Koreas split and the North Korean state was established. For many decades North Korea has been a closed country ruled by strictly autocratic regimens. Therefore, the city can not be named a tourist destination. It is a cultural, industrial, economic, educational, and social life center of the country. The architecture and infrastructure are relatively outdated compared with other large modern cities on the continent.
