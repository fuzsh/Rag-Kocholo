The Joseon Dynasty era (1392–1897) saw Pyongyang as a critical provincial city, but it also endured several invasions, including the devastating Japanese invasions in the late 16th century. The city underwent periods of destruction and rebuilding, reflecting the turbulent times.

The Japanese occupation (1910–1945) brought about a new phase of development, introducing industrial infrastructure. However, this period also left a mark on the city’s architecture and cultural heritage, with many traditional Korean structures replaced by Japanese-style buildings.

The Korean War (1950–1953) was a turning point for Pyongyang. The city suffered extensive damage during the conflict, losing its historical sites and structures.
