        "text": "Pyongyang - Capital city of North Korea\n\nMONUMENTS | STYLE | REVOLUTIONARY SITES | MUSEUMS | EXHIBITIONS | CIRCUSES | THEATRES | SCHOOLS | ART | ENTERTAINMENT & HEALTH | SPORT | PARKS | HOSPITALS | TRANSPORT\n\nThe North Korean capital Pyongyang is unlike any other on Earth - it represents an ideological statement forged in concrete, bronze and marble. Foreigners first coming to Pyongyang get amazed by the greatness of the cityscape with its fascinating public buildings and gigantic monuments.\n\nAfter the Korean War Pyongyang was completely destroyed, practically erased from the map. There were lots of discussions to move capital to a new place but finally it was decided to rebuild new Pyongyang on the ashes of the old. The city was rebuilt at an astonishing speed, much faster than Seoul. The Pyongyang's fast recovery was partly explained by the help from USSR and China but mostly by the hard work of Korean people. The city map was completely redrawn with big parks, wide streets and grandiose buildings which you can witness during your trip to the DPR Korea with Korea Konsult.\n\nPyongyang's main monuments\n\nPyongyang Style\n\nWhile Pyongyang's architecture is its most immediately striking feature, the capital is also notable for its people with their own style of shopping, eating and praying. There are many restaurants to entertain tourists in Pyongyang. The quality of the food in the restaurants of Pyongyang is usually good. Tourists are mostly served Korean food but still there is a chance to try western-style food and pizza in newly opened restaurants even though Pyongyang is one of the few world capitals without its own McDonald's.\n\nShopping in Pyongyang is an exciting thing to do if you like stamps, books, ginseng and originally-flavored liqueurs. Pyongyang is littered with souvenir shops - every site has a small booth selling books, postcards and other trinkets.\n\nPyongyang is an unique capital which has temples of all major confessions even though there are a few followers. There are several open Christian churches and Buddhist temples in Pyongyang.\n\nMain Revolutionary Sites\n\nIn Pyongyang there are three major sites associated with the life and work of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. First, President Kim Il Sung's Native Home in Mangyondae (\"mangyondae\" in Korean means \"valley with 10,000 views\") - that is the place where Kim Il Sung was born and spent his childhood. Second, Kim Il Sung Square - the main country's square where people express their respect to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in major political events, mass demonstrations and parades. Third, the Kumsusan Palace of Sun - the mausoleum for leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\nPyongyang Museums\n\nPyongyang is full of revolutionary history which is well preserved in numerous locals museums covering wide range of subjects from revolutionary history to folk customs and technology.\n\nExhibitions\n\nIn Pyongyang there are exhibitions all the year round. Three most popular exhibitions are flower exhibition, three-revolution exhibition and gift exhibition.\n\nPyongyang Circuses\n\nThe Pyongyang Circus is a popular tourist destinations. There are 2 circuses in Pyongyang - Korean People's Army Circus and Pyongyang Circus. Here youâll see a stellar display of acrobatics, some very funny clowns and bears skipping rope while dressed in outlandish costumes.\n\nPyongyang Theatres\n\nIn Pyongyang there are for main theatres: Pyongyang Grand Theatre, the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, the Moranbong Theatre and the Mansudae Art Theatre. The newly completed Peopleâs Theatre stages some of the most prestigious spectacles in the city. Popular performances include plays such as The Flower Girl, A Daughter of the Party, Sea of Blood or an opera honoring Kim Jong-suk, the mother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. Revolutionary operas depict North Korea's struggles in song and dance.\n\nSchooling in Pyongyang\n\nEducation in the DPR Korea is universal and state funded schooling by the government. The national literacy rate for citizens 15 years of age and older is over 99 percent. Children go through one year of kindergarten, four years of primary education, six years of secondary education, and then on to universities.\n\nOutside the formal structure of schools and classrooms is the \"social education.\" This education includes not only extracurricular activities but also family life and the range of human relationships within North Korean society. Attention is paid to the influence of the social environment on the growing child and its role in the development of his or her character.\n\nArt in Pyongyang\n\nNorth Korean society is centered on the act of performing â in both literal and proverbial senses â some people say that the whole country the worldâs biggest and longest performance. North Koreaâs visual art scene is mostly focused on the genre of socialist realism.\n\nEntertainment and Health Facilities in Pyongyang\n\nIt is easy to imagine that Pyongyang is not a city with a buzzing night life where many trendy bars and restaurants can be found. There are a shooting range, ice rink and Gold lane bowling.\n\nSport in Pyongyang\n\nThe countryâs commitment to sports can clearly be seen on Chongchun Sport Street where, in the span of less than a mile, one can enjoy almost a dozen separate stadiums for soccer, handball, table tennis, taekwondo, weight-lifting, volleyball, basketball and swimming. In addition, the government has also built for its people the enormous Kim Il Sung stadium (100,000 seats), a futuristic coneshaped ice rink hall, and the May Day Stadiumâone of the largest in the world with seating for 150,000 people.\n\nNorth Korea's first Summer Olympics appearance on its own was in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, taking home five medals, including one gold. Four years later, in Montreal, the nation took one gold and one silver in boxing, and took five medals in boxing, freestyle wrestling, and weightlifting in Moscow.\n\nPyongyang Parks and Pleasure Grounds\n\nIn Pyongyang there are many parks, resorts and other places where locals rest. The most popular Park is Moranbong park located in the center of the city. It is Pyongyang's largest recreation area. The park contains many significant historic relics, including vestiges of the old Pyongyang Castle walls and various ornamental pavilions.\n\nHealthcare in Pyongyang\n\nPyongyang has well established and well functioning health care system. For example, Pyongyang Maternity Hospital is recognized by the UNESCO as \"baby friendly\" hospital. Recently just in front of Maternity Hospital there was open new Okryo Children Hospital with one of the best medical facilities in the country. All these efforts result in high life expectancy which in 2013 was 69.8 years.\n\nPyongyang Public Transport\n\nNot only is Pyongyangâs metro the deepest underground train system in the world, it is also one of the most resplendent, with mosaics of propaganda murals, glitzy chandeliers and sparkling marble pillars. The subway is one of the best places to see residents go about their daily lives."
