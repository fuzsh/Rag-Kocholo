        "text": "Seo-Hyun Lee was born and raised in central Pyongyang and grew up with the best educational opportunities available in North Korea. In 2008, she enrolled at Kim Il Sung University and continued her study in the Chinese language in the department of Foreign Languages & Literature. After moving to China with her family, she graduated from China Dongbei University of Economics and Finance in 2014 and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance. During a heightened period of brutal purges by the Kim Jong Un regime, her family defected to South Korea and finally resettled in the United States in 2016. Advocating for North Korean human rights, Seo-Hyun works with HRNK and LiNK to inform the international community about the uncensored truth of North Korea. Seo-Hyun also works with several other NGOs, such as Lumen, to disseminate information into North Korea, which she believes is the best way to liberate the North Korean people. On top of that, in order to bring greater awareness of North Korea to the outside world, she and her brother have launched a YouTube channel called “Pyonghattan” to share their diverse experiences of living in Pyongyang’s core society.\n\nHyun-Seung (Arthur) Lee escaped North Korea when he was 29 years old. He engaged in trade and economic relations between China and North Korea through his managerial role in a business entity under the DPRK regime. He graduated from China Dongbei University of Finance and Economics, where he was the chairman of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, Dalian China branch. After completing his military service in 2005 with the rank of Sergeant, he was granted membership in the Korean Workers Party. Despite his prestigious background and elite-level education, a series of brutal purges by Kim Jong Un forced him and his entire family to defect in late 2014, making their way first to South Korea. Subsequently, the entire family emigrated to the United States (2016) where Hyun-Seung has been engaged with several Washington DC think tanks and NGOs in consulting roles.\n\nHannah Song is President and CEO of Liberty in North Korea (LiNK). She joined in 2006 as Deputy Director, managing day-to-day operations and coordinating overseas programs, including underground shelters and refugee resettlement efforts in the United States and in South Korea. At the end of 2008, she became President/CEO, helping to re-found the organization with a new mission focused on building international support for the North Korean people, providing direct assistance to North Korean refugees, and developing long-term, people-focused strategies to accelerate positive change inside the country. Hannah regularly speaks at international fora and to the media on North Korea-related issues."
