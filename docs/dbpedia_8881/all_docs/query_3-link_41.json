        "text": "Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, is one of the country’s main attractions.\n\nThe city offers many opportunities for sightseeing including a visit to the top of the Juche Tower as well as the May Day Stadium. The Juche Tower is located near the banks of the Taedonggang River and the tower shoots up 170 meters, standing as a guiding star for the city center. The May Day Stadium, on the other hand, is the world’s largest football stadium containing 150,000 seats and is located on the outskirts of Pyongyang but can be seen from the top of the Juche Tower.\n\nThe capital of North Korea is home to some of the country’s finest monuments as well as the largest buildings. You will also have the opportunity for a great view of the city as well as a unique experience while staying at a North Korean hotel. The Sosan Hotel is one of the newest hotels to be built as it was built in 1989 for the purpose of accommodating athletes but then was completely renovated in 2016. It is now open to tourists as one of the most beautiful hotels in North Korea. The Yanggakdo International Hotel, however, remains more visited and famous among travelers."
