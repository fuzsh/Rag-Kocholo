        "text": "For decades North Korea has been one of the world's most secretive societies. It is one of the few countries still under nominally communist rule.\n\nNorth Korea's nuclear ambitions have exacerbated its rigidly maintained isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nThe country emerged in 1948 from the chaos following the end of World War Two. Its history is dominated by its Great Leader, Kim Il-sung, who shaped political affairs for almost half a century.\n\nDecades of this rigid state-controlled system have led to stagnation and a leadership dependent on a cult of personality. The totalitarian state also stands accused of systematic human rights abuses.\n\nSome key dates in North Korea's history:\n\n4th Century BC - Gojoseon (Old Joseon) kingdom in existence on the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria.\n\n3rd Century BC - Jin state formed in southern Korea.\n\n57BC-668AD - Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla grow to control the peninsula and Manchuria as the Three Kingdoms of Korea.\n\n668-935 - Korea is unified under the kingdom of Silla, before it breaks apart.\n\n918-1392 - Korea is again unified, under Goryeo. The name \"Korea\" is derived from the name of Goryeo.\n\n1231-1270 - Mongol invasions of Korea bring Goryeo under the influence of the Mongol Empire in Mongolia and the Yuan dynasty of China until the mid-14th Century.\n\n1392-1897 - Joseon dynasty. Established by general Yi Seong-gye after a coup d'Ã©tat overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty in 1388.\n\n1418-1450 - Sejong the Great implements administrative, social, scientific and economic reforms and creates Hangul, the Korean alphabet.\n\n1592-1598 - Japanese invasions of Korea: conflict ends with the withdrawal of Japanese forces after a military stalemate.\n\n1876 - Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876; designed to force open Korea to Japanese trade. The treaty ends Korea's status as a protectorate of China.\n\n1897-1910 - Korean Empire: proclaimed by King Gojong of the Joseon dynasty. He oversees a partial modernization and westernization of Korea's military, economy and education systems.\n\n1905 - Korean Empire becomes a protectorate of Japan.\n\n1910 - Japan annexes Korea, which becomes a Japanese colony.\n\n1945 - After World War Two, Japanese occupation ends with Soviet troops occupying area north of the 38th parallel, and US troops in the south.\n\n1950-1953 - Korean War: Following border clashes and rebellions in South Korea, North Korea invades South Korea. North Korea is supported by China and the USSR while South Korea is supported by the US and allied UN countries.\n\nNorth Korea forces initially drive South Korean and US troops back to a final stand on the Pusan Perimeter, around the port of Busan. US and UN forces launch a surprise landing at Inchon and drive North Korean troops all the way back close to the Yalu river border with China. Chinese forces then intervene and push the US and UN forces back.\n\nAfter a year of mobile warfare the front stabilises along the 38th parallel, close to where fighting had a started and the last two years see a war of attrition on both sides. The fighting ends with an armistice on 27 July 1953 and the creation of a demilitarised zone, separating the two Koreas. Up to three million people are killed in the war."
