        "text": "North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is a country located on the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, split from South Korea by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). North Korea is a highly centralized unitary state and its ruling party is the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). Its capital city is Pyongyang.\n\nHistory[]\n\n20th Century[]\n\nIn the early 1950's, North Korea attempted to unify the Korean Peninsula by invading South Korea, leading to the Korean War. However, the war ended in a stalemate after the U.S and its allies intervened in the war to aid South Korea while China and the Soviet Union backed support for North Korea. The Korean Demilitarized Zone was established after the war to act as the new border between North Korea and South Korea.\n\nIn the late 1980's, North Korea endured a period of economic stagnation, which progressively worsened after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. With the USSR's fall, North Korea lost vital economic support, enduring a major famine from 1994 to 1998, with malnutrition amongst the population continuing into the early 21st century.\n\n21st Century[]\n\nOlympus Has Fallen[]\n\nIn 2013, during the White House Siege, North Korea was on high alert and mobilized its military in response to U.S officials preparing to withdraw their troops from the DMZ and the Seventh Fleet from the Sea of Japan. Their forces were seen parading through the streets of Pyongyang.\n\nCities[]\n\nPyongyang\n\nOrganizations[]"
