        "text": "Pyongyang; the Capital of North Korea\n\nThe Capital of North Korea, Pyongyang, was essentially re-built from scratch after being devastated in the Korean War. Literally meaning \"flat land\", it is the biggest city in North Korea with over 3 million people living there.\n\nLuckily our group sizes tend to be fairly small with an average of less than 10 members per group and we believe that this allows for greater interaction with locals.\n\nLocation\n\nPyongyang is located in a flat area of the DPRK, remember that about 83% of the country is mountainous, about 50 kilometres east from the west coast of Korea.\n\nBrief History\n\nPyongyang is one of the oldest cities on the Korean peninsula. It was capital of the Kojoson and Koguryo dynasties, the first ancient states in Korea.\n\nThe city was made a main industrial hub during Japanese colonisation but severely destroyed during the Korean War. When going to the Korean War Museum in Pyongyang you will be explained that the number of bombs dropped on Pyongyang was equal to the number of the city's inhabitants.\n\nPyongyang was rebuilt at what is known as Chollima Speed.\n\nWhat is it like in Pyongyang?\n\nA visit to the capital of North Korea is described by many as a mind blowing experience as are too trips to other areas of the DPRK.\n\nLadies cheering on people going to work in the morning, Pyongyang\n\nTraffic in Pyongyang, winter 2012\n\nThe city consists of wide avenues, grandiose monuments and soviet styled monolithic buildings now blended with futuristic looking high rise buildings, all of which reflect the unique system of the DPRK.\n\nPyongyang Tram\n\nCommercial billboards and advertisements give way to political slogans and propaganda posters. Trucks packed with KPA soldiers chanting patriotic songs reflect the military nature of the state and parade rehearsals either by soldiers or civilians are a common sight, showing the country's emphasis on the collective over the individual.\n\nBut it does have many other aspects to it that we will explore below!\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe past few years have witnessed a boom in the construction industry in Pyongyang which has literally changed the architectural landscape of the city.\n\nWhen we first started going to Korea in 2008 buildings where gloomy grey. They have now been repainted in beautiful pastel colours; yellow, green, pink, red, blue...\n\nA lot of construction was carried out to mark President Kim Il Sung's 100 Birthday on 15 April 2012, most noticeably in Changjon street by the Taedong river, where a series of high-rise flats where built.\n\nChangjon Street in Autumn\n\nIn 2015 we witnessed the construction of Mirae Street aka Scientists' Future street. A beautiful futuristic looking avenue built mainly to host scientists and university professors.\n\nMirae Future Scientists Street in Summer\n\n2017 saw the completion of Ryomyong street, again a futuristic looking avenue that one would relate more to Dubai or Shanghai.\n\nRyomyong Street\n\nIn the meantime new buildings have been incessantly sprouting throughout Pyongyang and restoration has taken place on a large scale. The most obvious example is the Ryugyong Hotel which changed from being a giant concrete shell to a magnificent structure proudly shining day and night.\n\nThe Ryugyong Hotel shines in the daytime and lights up at night\n\nEntertainment\n\nA visit to the capital of North Korea is not solely about mesmerising monuments, large boulevards and communist styled buildings mixed with modern looking high rise flats; we encourage too visits to places where travellers can see and experience local Pyongyites' daily lives. Joining locals ice skating and visits to local parks and funfairs all allow for engagement with local North Koreans, who in general are always curious at the rare sight of a foreigner.\n\nMunsu Water Park\n\nDefinitely a lot of fun and an option we offer more and more on our tours given the great feedback we have had from our travellers. Spending a few hours here having fun and relaxing with locals is an unforgettable experience. Moreover, it has indoor pools and slides as well as outdoor ones, meaning that we can go all year round!\n\nKaeson Evening Funfair\n\nThere are several funfairs in Pyongyang. This is our favourite one. Not to be confused with Kaesong city, Kaeson means Triumphant Return and it is located near the Arch of Trumph, Kaeson Mun 개선문. Hundreds of people gather here in the evenings on national holidays and weekends. Even if you are not feeling brave enough to muster up the courage to take one of the many rides available, it is always fun to see locals laughing their heads off. Tip: if taking the bumper cars you should know that the aim there is to avoid being hit by others!\n\nDolphinarium\n\nOpened in 2012, the water is pumped directly from the West Sea near Nampo. Performers, much to the amusement of the crowd, ask people from the audience to participate in one of their shows with the dolphins and seals.\n\nPyongyang Gold Lane Bowling Alley\n\nUniversity Students outside the Pyongyang Gold Lane Alley\n\nLocals hang out here hitting their pins, playing 1990s arcade games or having a game of pool. And we can of course join in.\n\nIce rink\n\nJust across from the Pyongyang Gold Lane Bowling Alley, it is opened all year round.\n\nRayco from KTG trying to learn to ice skate in Pyongyang\n\nPyongyang Central Zoo\n\nThis was renovated in 2016. Many of us are not fans of seeing animals locked up or of zoos in general, but we must admit that conditions in this zoo are impressive. Many locals gather here, and walking around the premises will allow you to freely interact with locals.\n\nCity Walks\n\nWalks around the city, whether through its large boulevards or local neighbourhoods, also provide a unique chance to see North Koreans going about their daily lives. We must be with our guides when going for a walk.\n\nBike Rides\n\nAnd, of course, exploring the capital of North Korea on two wheels is a unique way of seeing what Pyongyang is like. Don't believe us? Then please check out our Pyongyang bike tour Youtube video below:\n\nNational Holidays\n\nOn national holidays we arrange for visits to mass dances where KTG travellers have a chance to join them in the dances! And if you go to Pyongyang when there are no national holidays a Sunday visit to one of the local parks will usually allow for a dance with locals!\n\nThese tend to be arranged on important dates such as:\n\n16 February (Chairman Kim Jong Il's birthday)\n\n15 April (President Kim Il Sung's birthday)\n\n27 July (Victory Day)\n\n15 August (Liberation Day)\n\n9 September (National Day)\n\n10 October (Korean Worker's Party Foundation Day)\n\n26 December (birthday of National Heroine Comrade Kim Jong Suk referred to as Mother Kim Jong Suk)\n\nAs for extravagant firework displays, these usually take place on:\n\n16 February (Chairman Kim Jong Il's birthday)\n\n15 April (President Kim Il Sung's birthday)\n\nNew Year's Eve\n\nWe tend to join literally thousands of locals at night to Kim Il Sung Square to see the firework display.\n\nMay Day is another fabulous time to be in Pyongyang. We usually go to Mt. Taeson and partake in a variety of sports and games with locals. Please check our May Day video below for a taster!\n\nMilitary Parades\n\nNowhere as common as people tend to think. How many of us associate Pyongyang / North Korea with tanks, missiles and thousands of soldiers goose-step marching in perfect sync? However, they only tend to be held on major anniversaries of certain national holidays. We have been for example to see soldiers coming back from military parades on the 70th, 75th anniversaries of major national holidays such as National Day, Party Foundation Day or major anniversaries of the birth of the Leaders.\n\nHighlights\n\nHighlights of Pyongyang include the impressively deep Pyongyang Metro, the Juche Tower and the Arch of Triumph (which is taller that the Parisian one!).\n\nThe Pyongyang Metro\n\nNon-tourist places such as the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun or the Mansudae Grand Monuments are truly impressive. We have to remember that they are not tourist sites and have to strictly follow guidelines set regarding how to behave there. You will be fully briefed before the tour.\n\nPlease check our places to visit section to see brief descriptions of sights available in the capital of North Korea.\n\nHotels in Pyongyang\n\nHotels are generally in better conditions in Pyongyang than outside of the capital, but we always recommend a visit to other areas of the country in order to have a wider view of life in North Korea."
