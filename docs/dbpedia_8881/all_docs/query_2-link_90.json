        "text": "North Korea‘s capital Pyongyang is a country cut off from the outside world for nearly 70 years. The interesting city is home to many museums, halls, and skyscrapers that tell the story of a retro sci-fi architecture that is quite easy on the eye.\n\nWhile little is known about the day-to-day life in the secretive city, it is home to almost 3.2 million people with a long history. It was largely rebuilt after the Korean War by the newly founded Communist government and Kim Il-sung, and this video by YouTube channel City Beautiful provides an engaging look into the city’s architecture.\n\nThe video has numerous footage that you might have never seen before, displaying the architectural elements of the city comprehensively while giving you the historical trivia that goes along with them.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning about different country’s architecture with a healthy dose of history, you’ll certainly like this trip to Pyongyang’s interesting houses and transportation systems. Enjoy!"
