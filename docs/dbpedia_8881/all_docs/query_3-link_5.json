        "text": "The capital of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) is both the oldest and the newest settlement in Korea. The basic concepts in its early urban development made it the model for Korean cities of later ages. In the 6th and 7th century AD P’yôngyang was one of the largest cities in Asia, second only to the imperial capital of China, but it later declined. It partly recovered its former position when it became the capital of North Korea after World War II. Its reconstruction since the Korean War has made it one of the most striking examples of socialist city planning."
