        "text": "North Korea is a country that keeps to itself and doesn’t share much. It’s ruled by a family called the Kim’s, who control everything. The leader, Kim Jong-un, is mysterious, and people don’t know much about him. In this article, we will learn about what is the capital of North Korea, its former capitals, and much more.\n\nCapital of North Korea\n\nThe capital city of North Korea is Pyongyang. Pyongyang has famous places like the Juche Tower, which shows the country’s belief in doing things on its own, the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the bodies of past leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are kept, and the Arch of Triumph, which commemorates Korean resistance to Japan.\n\nPyongyang has many important government buildings, like the Workers’ Party of Korea Headquarters and the Supreme People’s Assembly. The city has wide streets, big monuments, and clean public areas. These places often show off how strong and important is the regime’s power and prestige.\n\nWhere is Pyongyang?\n\nPyongyang is situated in the western part of the country. It’s by the Taedong River, which runs through the city from north to south eventually reaching the Korean Bay. Around Pyongyang are mountains, like the Moranbong and Ryongak ranges, making the place look nice. Pyongyang lies on the Korean Peninsula in East Asia. North Korea occupies the northern half of the peninsula and the city is built on a flat plain roughly 50 kilometers east of Korea Bay, an inlet of the Yellow Sea.\n\nInteresting Facts about Pyongyang\n\nThe subway system in Pyongyang is one of the deepest in the world. Some of its stations are more than 100 meters below ground! These stations are famous for their amazing designs, art, and fancy lights hanging from the ceiling.\n\nPyongyang is well-known for its Mass Games, also called the Arirang Festival. This event is super big and involves thousands of performers all moving together in sync.\n\nNorth Korea has its special time zone called Pyongyang Time. It’s 30 minutes behind the time in South Korea and Japan. This might not seem like a big deal, but it’s a way for North Korea to show that it’s different from its neighbors.\n\nPyongyang is the main spot for education and culture in North Korea. It has prestigious institutions like Kim Il-Sung University, a medical school, and a university specifically for training party leaders. The Grand People’s Study House, the country’s largest library, is also located in Pyongyang.\n\nEven though Pyongyang is cut off from much of the world, it’s still changing to be more modernized. They’ve built new tall buildings, fun parks, and places for people to relax and have fun.\n\nFormer Capitals of North Korea\n\nBefore Pyongyang became the capital of North Korea, several other cities served as capitals at different times:\n\nGungnae\n\nThe Korean kingdom had different capital cities over time. One important capital, within what’s now North Korea, was Gungnae City. It was close to the Yalu River.\n\nKaesong\n\nKaesong was the capital during the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392). It was an important city back then.\n\nPyongyang\n\nPyongyang became the capital during the Joseon Dynasty from 1392 to 1897. It stayed a big deal throughout Korean history. Even after Korea split into North and South after World War II, Pyongyang remained the capital of North Korea.\n\nRelated Links"
