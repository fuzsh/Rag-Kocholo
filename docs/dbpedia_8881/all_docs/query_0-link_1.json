        "text": "History\n\nThe ancient capital of the legendary Dangun dynasty (2333 bce) was located on the site where, according to legend, Pyongyang was founded in 1122 bce. The city’s history began in 108 bce with the establishment of a Chinese trading colony near Pyongyang, and the city was subsequently fortified. In 427 ce Pyongyang became the capital of the Goguryeo kingdom, but in 668 it was captured by Chinese invaders. Later the kings of the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) made Pyongyang their secondary capital. The city fell to the Japanese in 1592 and was devastated by the Manchu in the early 17th century.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWorld Capitals Quiz\n\nThe successive invasions left their mark on the Koreans, who became suspicious of all foreigners. When Korea finally opened its doors to foreigners in the 19th century, Pyongyang became the base of an intensive campaign to bring Christianity to Korea. More than 100 churches were built in the city, which in the 1880s was reputed to have more Protestant missionaries than any other city in Asia.\n\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), much of Pyongyang was destroyed. Plague followed war, and in 1895 Pyongyang was left a virtually deserted and ruined city. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910–45), Pyongyang was built up as an industrial center. During the Korean War (1950–53) numerous air raids devastated Pyongyang. It was captured by United Nations forces in 1950 but subsequently was lost when Chinese communist forces entered the war. After 1953 the city was rebuilt with Soviet and Chinese assistance.\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nA huge bronze statue of Chollima, a winged horse of Korean legend, atop a high pedestal dominates the skyline of Pyongyang and symbolizes to the residents the economic progress made after the end of the Korean War. Sections of the inner and northern walls and Hyonmu Gate are still standing, and several temples and pavilions that date from the Goguryeo kingdom have been reconstructed in the original architectural style. Modern landmarks include the Grand Theater; the Okryu Hall, which contains a large banquet hall for official functions and recreation facilities for the workers; and Kim Il-Sung Stadium. Beneath Moran Hill, the city’s main recreational center, is a huge underground theater. The reputed grave of the Chinese sage Kija (1122 bce), legendary founder of the city, is north of the city.\n\nThe industrial infrastructure in and around Pyongyang is the most highly developed in the country. It was the first to emerge in North Korea in terms of modern industry, and its development owes much to bountiful and available natural resources such as coal, iron, and limestone, as well as the convenient ground and waterborne transportation systems. Heavy and light industries in Pyongyang’s manufacturing base have grown in parallel, the core activity being the mechanical industry. The city also produces such heavy manufactures as cement, munitions and weaponry, and industrial ceramics. Light industries developed in the capital region include textiles and, to a lesser extent, footwear, food, and other commodities. The government operates the major commercial and financial institutions.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Also grown are rice, corn (maize), and soybeans, but their quantities are not enough to meet the grain needs for Pyongyang. Efforts are being made throughout the capital region to achieve self-sufficiency in meat production. Chicken, hogs, and other livestock are raised in high-density facilities.\n\nAs North Korea’s center of transportation, Pyongyang commands a dense network of air, rail, and road routes, both as points of departure and arrival. Some airlines reach both domestic and international destinations, including Beijing and Moscow. Also radiating out of Pyongyang are inter-regional highways and expressways that reach to Nampo, Wonsan, and Kaesong. Sunan International Airport is the only port of entry for visitors to North Korea. The city’s subway, bus, and trolley systems are used mainly by commuters as their primary means of urban transportation.\n\nPyongyang is the seat of Kim Il-Sung University (1946), a medical school, and a communist university for training party leaders. Adult education is encouraged through classes taught at the factories. There are numerous venues for opera, theater, dance, and acrobatics, and many well-tended parks dot the city’s landscape. Rungrado 1st of May Stadium, the world’s largest-capacity stadium, was completed in 1989 on an island in the Taedong River in central Pyongyang. The country’s principal museums and libraries are also located in Pyongyang."
