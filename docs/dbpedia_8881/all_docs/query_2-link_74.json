        "text": "North Korea has imposed a five-day lockdown on its capital city as it battles an increase in “recurrent flu and other respiratory diseases” amid a cold spell, according to the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang.\n\nA North Korean government notice that the embassy posted on its Facebook account on Wednesday said Pyongyang had ordered a “special anti-epidemic period” through Sunday. It advised all foreign diplomatic missions to keep their employees indoors, have their temperatures taken four times a day and report the results to a hospital by phone. There was no mention of a specific plan of action for regular citizens.\n\nAny goods the diplomats need can be ordered and delivered to the embassies, the notice said.\n\nThe statement made no mention of the coronavirus, although the North’s state media said on Thursday that its health authorities were taking precautionary measures to “cope with the daily-worsening world health crisis.” It was also unclear whether the lockdown covered areas beyond Pyongyang."
