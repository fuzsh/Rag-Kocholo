        "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.” This inspirational quote was the focus of Emory’s 2022 Martin Luther King Jr. Community Service Awards, which recognized individuals and agencies for their outstanding action to advance social justice through activism and voting. This year’s ceremony also honored the Rollins School of Public Health’s Dean Jim Curran, founding dean of the program and one of its most stalwart and influential supporters.\n\nLaunched more than 20 years ago, the awards program exemplifies Emory’s commitment to building a more fair and just society. Representing our schools of public health, medicine, nursing, and business, the program also reflects our broad institutional commitment to collegiality, constructive culture, and diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nPlease visit the Martin Luther King Jr. Community Service Awards website to learn more about the program, as well as our current and prior honorees.
