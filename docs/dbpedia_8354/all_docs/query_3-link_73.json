The Subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10:00 a.m., in Room 2360 Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Kathy Dahlkemper [chairwoman of the Subcommittee] presiding. Present: Representatives Dahlkemper, Westmoreland, King, Buchanan, and Thompson. Also Present: Representative Graves. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. This hearing of the impact of food recalls on small businesses is now called to order. From the dinner table to the grocery store, most Americans take the safety of their food for granted. But what happens when that food is jeopardized? Recent outbreaks of Salmonella and E. Coli have shown that, as much as we would like to believe otherwise, we cannot always assume the food our families are eating is safe. This past January, a Salmonella outbreak in peanut butter tainted a wide range of products, from crackers to candy bars. The epidemic killed 9 people, sickened hundreds, and kicked off one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history. The men and women on the front lines getting products off the shelves and educating consumers about which foods are safe to eat were small business owners. They did this not because they had to--after all, they weren't the ones who created the problem--but because they felt the responsibility towards their customers. But for all the good that these entrepreneurs did for customers, there is a very real economic side to this stepping in to do the right thing. Now that the Peanut Corporation of America has declared bankruptcy, small businesses are the ones left holding the bag. In today's hearing, we will examine the effects of a food safety crisis on entrepreneurs. More importantly, we will look for solutions moving forward. For small firms, managing a food safety crisis is an enormous financial burden. They not only have the responsibility of tracking down and destroying tainted products, but they often have to dispatch costly damage control campaigns; whereas, large firms can often afford to retain public relations firms. Most entrepreneurs cannot. This can be especially damaging considering the stigma attached to tainted products. Even foods not directly affected have been stigmatized. In the case of the Salmonella outbreak, jarred peanut butter sales plummeted 22 percent. Peanut butter cookies also stayed on the shelves, with purchases own 14.6 percent. These drop-offs have been devastating for the broad range of small businesses that sell peanut butter products, from 7-11 franchises to boutique bakeries. Food safety crises are particularly hard on small businesses. Because many of these firms operate on tight profit margins, generally between 2 and 5 percent, large recalls can mean bankruptcy. This is especially true for small firms that cannot afford recall insurance. Even companies that do have these policies are struggling to recoup their costs. Many insurance providers are now refusing to fill peanut butter-related claims, arguing that they are the PCA's responsibility. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the Salmonella epidemic is the fact that it could have been avoided. To begin, the regulatory process is fragmented with different foodstuffs falling under different agency jurisdictions. These divisions prevent authority from properly responding to outbreaks. On top of that, agencies like the FDA are often understaffed and overwhelmed. In response to the spotty inspection system, many large businesses have taken food safety into their own hands. In fact, some large firms have gone so far as to hire their own private inspectors. Yet, this is not likely the best response to this issue. From the fields to the processing plant to the grocery store to the dinner table, small businesses are an integral part of our food supply chain. But recent recalls have made us question the safety of our food. And they have not only jeopardized the health of our families. They have put an important part of the small business community at risk. I would like to thank all of today's witnesses in advance for their testimony and, with that, yield to the Ranking Member for his opening statement. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for holding this hearing today and for your comments. I would also like to thank all of the witnesses for their participation today in coming up to D.C. to inform us of some of the situations and some of the solutions that our government is looking at. I would also like to thank you for having such a great topic as our first hearing. And so I know that we will have many more that are going to give us an opportunity to work together on some of the problems that small business faces today in our country. We are here today to discuss the impact food recalls have on small businesses, but I want to start off by saying how sorry I am to those who are harmed by the recent string of food contamination. It is a frightening situation. And I can't imagine what it would have been like if it had happened to me or someone, one of my loved ones. Unfortunately, the origin of the contaminated peanuts happened in my home State. Madam Chairwoman, I am here to tell you today that I am very disappointed that one bad actor could have caused such a devastating effect on so many others, but I am also here to tell you that we have some of the greatest, best, most dedicated farmers in the United States, if not the world. And so it was certainly not the intention of any crop that they had grown to get into the situation that we are in today. The Peanut Corporation of America's lack of integrity has punished small businesses in Georgia and nationwide. Georgia's peanut industry has taken a huge blow. And farmers and small businesses have felt the serious economic impact of this recall. Let me remind you farmers do business with other small businesses. And because of this, I believe we have yet to see the worst of the food recall. In these tough economic times, our small businesses cannot afford the domino effect that occurred because of bad players or because of burdensome regulation. I hope we can all learn from this situation and maybe reach some solutions to the problems we face. The safety of our nation's food supply is a pressing issue, but it is important to address how government agencies work to assist those indirectly affected by food recalls. Government's bureaucratic web, combined with the lack of resources, can often contribute to the regulatory burdens working against small businesses. And, as I have experienced in my 5 years in Congress, sometimes this is a knee-jerk reaction group up here, rather than proactive. I do not agree that placing more regulatory Band-Aids on a wound is the right answer. Rather, having a reactive government that should rely on science-based information and utilize the resources that we have for prevention. If Congress decides to authorize more power and money to our agencies, I hope to see the measures that streamline policies and encourage agencies to work closely with the state and local entities when recalls occur. The FDA and the USDA have an obligation to the public to address a food recall situation, reveal the source, and inform the public as quickly and as accurately as possible. I am looking forward to examining the ways that USDA and the FDA can assist small businesses who are adversely affected by these food recalls. Our country has been a worldwide leader in food safety measures imposed by a strict regulatory structure leading to the safest food supply in the world. However, accidents do occur. And our job on this Committee is to examine how these situations affect our nation's small businesses and the public. I hope this hearing provides insight on the serious impact food recalls have on some of these small businesses and especially the farmers that grow the product. This Congress faces a great challenge as it tries to help small businesses survive in this recession. The timing of this recall could have not been worse, but I am hopeful that the work of this Subcommittee will do its part in answering this challenge. I welcome this distinguished panel and thank you all for your willingness to testify. With that, Madam Chair, I yield back. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you, Mr. Westmoreland. We will now move to the testimony from our first panel of witnesses. Witnesses will have 5 minutes to deliver their prepared statements. The timer begins when the green light is illuminated. When one minute of time remains, the light will turn yellow. And the red light will come on when your time is up. Our first witness is Dr. Ken Petersen. Dr. Petersen is the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Field Operations for the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture. FSIS is the public health agency within USDA responsible for ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meet, poultry, and egg products are safe. Thank you, Dr. Petersen. STATEMENT OF KEN PETERSEN Mr. Petersen. Good morning, Madam Chairwoman and members of the Committee. I want to thank you for inviting me to appear before you today to address the Food Safety and Inspection Service's recall procedures and outreach to small businesses. I am Dr. Kenneth Petersen, Assistant Administrator for the Office of Field Operations with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. FSIS is the public health regulatory agency within the USDA. We are responsible for ensuring that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and processed egg products is safe, secure, wholesome, accurately labeled and packaged, whether the products are domestic or imported. Industry is responsible for the production of safe food while FSIS continuously inspects each livestock and poultry carcass at slaughter and visits processing establishments at least once per shift per day. Regarding recalls, the purpose of a recall is to remove meat and poultry from commerce as quickly as possible when FSIS has reason to believe it is adulterated or misbranded. Recalls are voluntary actions taken by industry at the request of the Agency. This is a rapid and efficient way to determine where affected product has been distributed because companies are familiar with who their customers are and can notify them much more quickly than the Federal government could. Should a firm deny FSIS' request for voluntary recall, the Agency has the authority to detain and, if necessary, seize product in commerce. FSIS may become aware of adulterated or misbranded product in commerce in several ways. We may be alerted to a potential recall situation by the company that manufactures or distributes the product, by test results from our own sampling programs, observations or information gathered by our inspectors, consumer complaints, or epidemiological or laboratory data submitted by State or local departments, other USDA or Federal agencies. FSIS is able to convene a recall committee in a matter of hours 24/7. After recall occurs, FSIS conducts effectiveness checks to ensure that the consignees have received notice of the recall and are making appropriate efforts to retrieve and destroy the product or return it to the recalling firm. This past August 18th, 2008, in order to improve the effectiveness of a recall, FSIS began making available to the public a list of retail customers that are likely to have received products subject to a recall. We believe this information helps consumers lower their risk of foodborne illness by providing more information that may assist them in identifying recalled products. FSIS' food safety system is preventative. It is our goal to eliminate the need for recalls altogether. One way we do this is through education and outreach. By educating producers and manufacturers of FSIS-regulated products, we continually seek to protect public health and, accordingly, the need for recalls at all. Some of the most important groups that FSIS works with are the small and very small plants. The businesses that fall into this category have a particular need for current and frequent food safety information because they often lack the resources to monitor food safety developments from the Agency, academia, or trade associations. To address the challenges that these companies face and to further the Agency goals of minimizing the need for recalls, FSIS has initiated several efforts to work with small and very small plants. We have an action plan to deliver outreach assistance to promote food safety and food defense systems for small and very small plants. Last year, as part of that plan, FSIS established a new program office, the Office of Outreach, Employee Education and Training, to provide comprehensive one-stop assistance to owners and operators of small and very small plants. This office provides consolidated access, resources, and technical support for small and very small plants. Over the past two years, FSIS has held a series of regulatory education sessions around the country to deliver various topics of interest to small business. We intend to continue this successful effort. In January 2009, FSIS began holding a series of ``how to'' workshops to provide practical tools and methods for the proper application of and compliance with various regulatory requirements. These workshops are designed so that the small and very small plant operators can walk away from the workshop with a plan that they can immediately implement, such as a recall plan. FSIS has a variety of resources available through the FSIS Web site, including podcasts and access to educational Web seminars. It also includes access to FSIS compliance guidance that helps small and very small plants apply public health regulations in their working environment. In conclusion, FSIS' system for achieving food safety is strong. We continually seek to protect public health. And we take this responsibility very seriously. We focus on preventing recalls at the plant level through inspection and outreach to producers and manufacturers of FSIS-regulated product. FSIS will work to ensure that small and very small businesses continue to meet their food safety requirements. Thank you for this opportunity to appear before you today. I am happy to take any questions at the appropriate time.[The prepared statement of Ken Petersen is included in the appendix at page 40.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you, Dr. Petersen. We would like now to hear from Dr. Steven Solomon from the FDA. Dr. Steven Solomon is the Deputy Associate Commissioner for Compliance Policy at the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA regulates almost 124,000 business establishments that annually produce, warehouse, import, and transport $1 trillion worth of consumer goods. Among other things, the FDA is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety of our nation's food supply. Thank you, Dr. Solomon. STATEMENT OF STEVEN SOLOMON Mr. Solomon. Good morning, Madam Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. I am Dr. Steven Solomon, Assistant Commissioner for Compliance Policy in the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with information about how we manage the recall of FDA-regulated products that can harm consumers, including the ongoing recalls related to peanut products made by the Peanut Corporation of America, or PCA. As you know, these products have been the source of a foodborne illness outbreak caused by Salmonella Typhimurium, which as of March 8th has infected 683 people in 46 states and may have contributed to 9 deaths. One of the key messages that FDA has been emphasizing over the last few years is that all food companies, both large and small, should establish strong food safety programs. It is critically important for these companies to understand the supply chain for the ingredients they use in their products and to have accurate information about the safety and quality of their ingredients. In a complex, global market, this may require close interaction with many critical components throughout the food supply chain, including growers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, food service providers, and importers. When a marketed product presents a public health hazard, promptly recalling that product is the most effective means of protecting the public. For food products, with the exception of infant formula, FDA does not have the authority to order the recall of a food or dietary supplement. In most cases, companies recall their products voluntarily. FDA believes that the prompt removal of volatile products from the marketplace is in the industry's and the public's best interest. As illustrated by the recent events, a recall initiated by one company can sometimes have repercussions for a very large number of businesses that receive those products or ingredients. In most cases, the recalling firm and FDA work collaboratively to develop a recall strategy. Early communication helps to ensure that violative products are removed from the market quickly, which can help to minimize the adverse impact on affected businesses. It also allows FDA to determine the steps needed to address specific circumstances, which may include making certain that all products that need to be recalled are, in fact, recalled; locating the product subject to the recall; identifying the cause of the problem; and checking similar firms or products to determine if the problem is more widespread. Rest assured that FDA is sensitive to the impact on small businesses caught in a recall scenario. FDA is committed to working recalling firms to effectively and promptly remove volatile products from the marketplace. And we have a variety of mechanisms in place to achieve this goal. For example, FDA has field recall coordinators located throughout the country who act as the point of contact for recalling firms and works closely with them throughout the process. Recall coordinators help firms develop an effective recall strategy, review a firm's letter to customers affected by the recall, and coordinate the destruction, reconditioning, and disposition of recalled product. FDA has also developed model press releases that firms can use to inform the public about a recall. These model press releases help ensure that critical information about the recalled product is accurately and appropriately conveyed to the public. For recalls of widely distributed products, FDA recently developed a searchable database for its Web site to help the public and recalling firms identify recalled products. The database can be updated daily with important information, including brand name, recalling firm, UPC code, size, and product description. In the recent peanut outbreak, there have been over 3 million hits to date on the site. In this outbreak, we learned of at least one small business that used the searchable database to identify a recalled peanut ingredient product that the business had used in its finished product. The firm initiated a recall of its own products, even before receiving notification from its supplier. As discussed in more detail in my written testimony, the agency's investigation of the Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak associated with PCA's peanut products resulted in a series of recalls that began on January 20th with products made in the Blakely, Georgia facility. Since then the scope has expanded as we identify companies that use PCA's products as ingredients in their own products. On February 12th, the State of Texas issued an emergency order directing PCA to cease the manufacture and distribution of all food products at the Plainview, Texas facility and issued a mandatory recall order for all products manufactured at that plant. On February 20th, PCA issued a statement that it had filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy and would no longer able to communicate with their customers about recalled product. As a result, FDA is coordinating with Texas officials to notify customers that received product from the Texas facility and follow up with these companies as needed. Many companies that received recalled product from PCA have, in turn, conducted voluntary recalls themselves. These companies use recalled PCA products as ingredients in their own products, exponentially increasing the scope of the recall. FDA continues to work to identify products that may be affected and to track the ingredient supply chain of these products. The facts of this outbreak as well as our experience with other outbreaks highlights the need to enhance FDA's statutory authority to protect consumers from foodborne outbreaks. We are currently reviewing with the Department of Health and Human Services the agency's prior legislative requests to strengthen our ability to protect Americans from foodborne illness. Food safety is a priority for the new administration. One of the areas under discussion is mandatory recall authority, which would be a useful tool in some circumstances to effectuate removal of implicated product from Commerce. We are also discussing the need for new or enhanced authority for FDA to require preventative controls, exercise enhanced access to food records during routine inspections, and require food facilities to renew their registrations more frequently and modify the registration categories. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss FDA's recall process. And I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.[The prepared statement of Steven Solomon is included in the appendix at page 50.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you, Dr. Solomon. I would like to stay on the subject that you just finished discussing, the actual recent contaminated peanut product recall. Let's go back to the beginning because I think we all know that if we can stop a contaminated product from even leaving or even being produced, we're going to save a lot of money and we're going to save a lot of small businesses a lot of financial burden, a lot of headaches. So as we look at this entire scenario of what happened at the Peanut Corporation of America, what regulatory failures led to this incident? Can you give me some specifics about exactly what could have been done to prevent the scenario from happening? Mr. Solomon. Thank you for the question. So this facility at PCA we have now uncovered through the subsequent inspections that they knew about some problems associated with Salmonella in this facility. FDA does not have routine access to those type records. In fact, we had to issue some authorities we have under the Bioterrorism Act that Congress passed previously a request to actually get all of the records from the firm. In order for us to get those type records, we need to be in a situation where there is a significant consequence or adverse health effects, so a very severe outbreak situation in order for FDA to have access to those type records. So that is one of the requests when I just mentioned some of the authorities we are looking at is routine access to such records is one of the aspects that we think would be important. The other issues relate to our request. FDA issued a food protection plan last year and is looking for greater preventative controls. We all recognize that recalls are a reactive piece. And we all want to get into the preventive controls aspect. So right now there are GMPs that apply, but trying to analyze what the hazards are in different type facilities and then how you control those hazards is not one of the controls that are currently done in this type facility. We do do those types of controls in the area of seafood and juice controls. So one of the other areas is greater preventive controls we are looking for. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. So no physical? A lot of the inspection is visual when you go into these plants at this point? Mr. Solomon. It is records. It is a visual examination. And it is a sampling. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Okay. So you do do sampling? Mr. Solomon. We do do sampling. What we have learned from these is that traditionally a product like a peanut butter manufacturer is a plant that has a very dry environment. And dry environments don't allow, really, for the growth of bacteria, like Salmonella, traditionally. We have learned through the previous ConAgra and this recent one that the introduction of moisture into a dry plant allows for the opportunity of these bacteria to grow. So that has changed our inspectional approach. And what we would like firms to be doing is doing a lot of environmental testing because testing finished product does not give you the entire answer because the bacteria only periodically develops into finished products. So extensive controlling of your environment, making sure that it stays in a dry environment in the case of a plant like this, are critical to try and control those hazards. That is part of the kind of preventive controls we are looking for. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Because I am just trying to understand. You know, I have a background. I was a dietician for over 25 years. So I have been in lots of facilities where food has been produced or food has been served. And knowing that visually you have to do physical testing to be able to really see if there is some--you can look at a doorknob and it looks fine, but we all know what could be on a doorknob. So that is what I guess I am getting at. You know, what kind of physical testing is being--there is really no mandatory physical testing at this point or-- Mr. Solomon. There are no controls required on the farms to do that type testing. That would be part of a more elaborate preventive control program. FDA's inspectional approaches do include environmental testing. So when you go into such facility--and we did it during the recent inspection of PCA--taking several hundred environmental samples to try and understand what type of bacteria pathogens may be in such a facility, in addition to looking at testing some of the finished products, but to-- Chairwoman Dahlkemper. And that was after the fact? Mr. Solomon. That was after the fact. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Okay. So prior to that, I am just trying to get down to the basics on any food production company. It is all really up to them in terms of what they do in terms of physical testing. And FDA comes in and does mostly visual testing, looks at records? Mr. Solomon. We have changed our procedures into doing more and more environmental testing when we learn the unique conditions, such as a plant. So we are now going through all other plants similar to PCA and having an inspectional approach to do fairly extensive environmental testing, finished product testing, in addition to records and the observations. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Okay. Thank you. Dr. Petersen, last year we had the contaminated beef recall, which also had a crippling effect, I think, on many small firms. In this particular case, it was the humane society, not FSIS, that alerted the public to the violations, which led to the recall. How did FSIS miss these violations? And what specific steps have you taken to ensure that this does not happen again? Mr. Petersen. Okay. Thank you. Well, the situation that you mentioned is at the Hallmark facility in Chino, California, where we saw a video of just outrageous treatment of cattle at a slaughter plant. It was quite troubling, certainly for me, that that occurred at a federally inspected slaughter plant, certainly was troubling to Congress, and obviously the public. And you asked the right question, how did this happen? I thought you were there every single day. We have done some investigation. The Office of Inspector General actually did a follow-up investigation. And they had a couple of observations. One was that there were deliberate actions by that firm to bypass inspection. And that is still the subject of some investigation. They also found that there was some noncompliance by my inspectors with them executing their required inspection procedures. We thought at the time and we had no reason to believe at the time that that was anything other than an isolated event. And the OIG report from this past November did say and basically quoting, that the events at the Hallmark facility were not evidence of a systematic failure of the inspection procedures. It was a constellation of very, very bad events that occurred in that particular facility. We have implemented several things, actually, quite a few things, some of which from OIG and some of which we initiated in advance of their report. We looked at, how did my supervisory structure allow some of my inspection behaviors to occur? They should have been tracking these employees on a more close basis, particularly my veterinarian in that particular plant. That veterinarian supervisor should have had a better understanding of what they were doing. So we introduced a new layer of--not a new layer but a new level of structure, organization, to how they assess the performance of those veterinarians and inspectors on an ongoing basis, structure where it is documented and other people in the supervisory chain, including myself, can follow up and see what is happening. That is all populated in a management control system. Then we looked at training, training of the workforce. Had we really trained the workforce to identify some of the low- level behaviors at the Chino plant, I think if they had identified some of those behaviors by the plant early on, then they would not have gotten to this egregious activity, you know. And if we introduce the regulatory sanctions earlier, then obviously the point of that is to deter behavior. And so we have reinforced our training, pushed that out, as well as reinforced the accountability for enforcing inhumane activity at slaughter plants. And last year we did quite rigorously enforce inhumane handling at a variety of slaughter plants across the country. That plant I think is not typical of the industry. And we recognize that. But it is typical of a very, very significant problem. The recall was massive, as you suggested. It is the largest recall we have ever had. It was really not a safety-related recall. It was that, as I mentioned, proper inspections were not done because the plant had found a way to bypass those inspections. So the food was recalled because of a regulatory violation. The product has to be inspected. And in that case, on certain days, it was not. That recall went all the way down the food chain, including to a variety of school lunch programs. And many small businesses were affected. It is surprising how product coming out of one plant can touch many, many businesses. But it was important, we felt. And obviously we looked at the scope of the recall and looked at, were there ways to mitigate it. We, at the end of the day, did feel that the scope of that recall, as massive as it was, was the right thing to do for the public, in spite of the consequences. And so we did get a lot of that product back, but it did have a significant impact on a variety of retailers, small firms, school lunch programs. And my goal is, with these new measures we put in place, that we will not see anything nearly as sweeping as that in the future. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Any idea what the cost of that recall was? Mr. Petersen. Well, the cause-- Chairwoman Dahlkemper. No. Cost. Mr. Petersen. Oh, the cost. No. But it is 143 million pounds. That dwarfs any other recall we have ever done. Well over 10,000 businesses and stores were affected. I don't have a cost on it, no. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. I don't think any of us ever will, but I think the issue we are trying to look at here today is how can we prevent these massive recalls from happening. I think we are always going to have some incidence of a recall, but how can we prevent these massive recalls. So what you have in place right now you think will help to prevent this kind of a massive recall? Mr. Petersen. Well, we are not going to stand still. We think what we put in place mitigates and goes a little bit beyond what occurred. And obviously we are transposing that to all of the other facilities that we regulate and then following up in a more timely manner with folks to make sure that they are doing what you and others expect them to be doing. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask you both a little bit about private inspections versus government inspections because there has been kind of a movement towards industry hiring their own inspectors. And, as we look at that, maybe if you could address that and what you see as the role of a private inspector versus a government inspector. Mr. Solomon. During my testimony, I talked about trying to understand the supply chain. That is really critical. And as the globalization of our food is changed, it is important for firms to be able to try and understand that supply chain. I think a response is many of them do hire various private auditors to go help them inspect that. I don't see that as a substitute for government oversight and regulation. I think that needs to happen, too. But I think some companies put in additional requirements. And some of these auditors are looking at those. FDA is conducting a pilot right now of looking at third party inspections and the value of that. We are actually looking at it more for imported products. But it needs to be very closely structured. There need to be very clear standards established for any third parties that we need to be controls for conflict of interest. There needs to be auditing of it. So we are very carefully running a pilot right now to evaluate the value of third parties, particularly in the import environment. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Dr. Petersen? Mr. Petersen. For the laws that USDA implements, here basically the Federal Meat Inspection Act, Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act, inspection shall be done by government employees. And so our role, in fact, our legal obligation, which is a little different than FDA's, is to find the product acceptable before it leaves the plant. And so that is a big resource issue. Now, private businesses have a variety of third party auditors, as Dr. Solomon mentioned, that can assess quality factors, food safety factors. And sometimes, of course, a lot of the times, they assess customer specifications. If those third party audits involve food safety decisions, then we can have access to those records. And we do that. We do assess some of their findings and, if necessary, marry them up with our findings. But for us the Federal role to find a product safe in the meat, poultry, and egg product sector, that is our primary role. And I don't see a role without some legislative change, which we are not pursuing for other inspection people. Now, certainly we partner with our State partners, local partners, who are authorized to do some of these inspections, but a private entity we don't see that on the board. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. Dr. Solomon and Dr. Petersen, the Regulatory Flexibility Act requires Federal agencies to consider the impact of regulations on small firms. In crafting effective policies, it is critical that we do not forget the needs of entrepreneurs. How do your agencies collaborate with small businesses? And can you give me an example of a specific rule that was influenced by the input of entrepreneurs? Mr. Solomon. As you note, on every regulation, there needs to be a regulatory assessment that takes place, economic analysis of what that is. I can't give you off--many of these regulations have had various input from--when we go through the notice and comment rulemaking process, we accept a lot of input from small businesses as well as large businesses. And that influences how those final rules come out. And there are a number of rules--we can come back to you with specifics--where there have been various exceptions, either an implementation of the regulations or some exceptions for small businesses on some of those regulations. Mr. Petersen. Of course, our key interest is food safety, and so if there are food safety lapses in a very small plant, those lapses can obviously make a consumer as sick as any lapse in a large plant. So our starting point is food safety, making sure that they meet the regulatory obligations. But we recognize the impact of regulations can certainly disproportionately impact small and very small firms. And, as I indicated in my testimony, we have a rather aggressive outreach to really communicate with our small and very small plants that we regulate, find ways to get them the information that they need but get it in a way that is useful to them. But at the end of the day, they do have to meet their food safety obligations. We have and, as Dr. Solomon mentioned, any regulation that is proposed and finalized under the Administrative Procedures Act would require us to consider the economic impacts of that rule. The best example I think I could give was about 10 years ago we implemented one of our most significant regulatory changes, what is called HACCP, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points, a preventive approach to food safety. That had a 3-year implementation plan, where the largest plants started first; then small plants, which we consider 10 to 500 employees; and the very small plants, which are less than 10 employees, plant employees, implemented last. And so there was a kind of sequential way so they could get the information, make any adjustments they needed, but then at the end of the day, they did have to implement their responsibilities. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. I will now yield to Mr. Westmoreland, but before that, I would like to recognize that we have been joined by Representative Buchanan and Representative Thompson. Thank you. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to ask Dr. Petersen, have you ever had an inspector in the PCA plant in Blakely? Mr. Petersen. The Department has, but it is important, I think, to kind of distinguish inspectors, which, of course, is what we think of in the Food Safety and Inspection Service, with contracting procurement verification. So I wouldn't say there was so much an inspector from the Department, but there was somebody in the plant yearly. The last time was in September of 2007, really verifying their contractual specifications, a more systems assessment, rather than being on the floor and looking for whatever was going on in that plant. Mr. Westmoreland. Was everything in order while your inspector or compliance officer or whatever you want to call them at the plant, was everything in order then? Mr. Petersen. In the September '07 visit, yes. There were no aberrant findings that we are aware of. Earlier in the 2001, I think, 2002, there were some minor findings. And they were shared with the appropriate regulatory bodies. But in the recent past, there was nothing. This is folks involved with what is called our Farm Services Agency, who is the procurement body, did not find anything as of September 2007, which is the last time they were in there. Mr. Westmoreland. So they don't really get there once a year if that was the last time they were there, of course. So it's not a yearly visit. How often is it? Mr. Petersen. Well, their obligations for their frequencies I am not personally aware of. We can certainly get you that. I do know that going back to 2001, they were in the plant about 10 times and a handful of times, certainly less than half of those times, did they find minor sanctions, such as some insects that had to be controlled and that kind of thing. Mr. Westmoreland. We are trying to get a little comfort here from the Food Safety and Inspection Service about the reliability. I mean, listening to your testimony, we are supposed to think that you are providing us some type of protection. If you are telling me that they were there in '07, nothing was wrong, and now we have had this major recall and you weren't there in over a year, how comfortable are we to fill this number of employees that you have and evidently this small plant program that you were touting, I guess? I mean, is this something that we are working on? I mean, this plant and the plants of PCA, all 3 plants, provide less than 2 and a half percent of the peanut butter or products that are used in this country. So to me, it is a relatively small thing. So how much protection are we getting there? Mr. Petersen. I will say for the commodities that we are directly responsible for regulating through our statutory authorities, meat, poultry, and egg products, you should have and you should expect a very high level of comfort with the mission that we are executing with the resources that we have in those facilities. We do not have jurisdiction. We have no legislative authority--that is an FDA responsibility, and I know they embrace it--for other commodities, such as in this case peanuts. Now, we are looking at--I mentioned the procurement people. Some government person is going in there. Should they have other training or whatnot to-- Mr. Westmoreland. Who would that have been from the government that should have been in that plant? Mr. Petersen. Well, for us, for USDA, as I indicated, it would be our contracting official who was looking at the contract obligations. And through the investigation, of course, they found some of the attestations by that firm were not what they were claimed to be. Mr. Westmoreland. When was the last time a USDA inspector was in there or somebody stationed there? Mr. Petersen. Nobody was stationed there. Again, the last time a contracting person would have been there--but they are obligated to make sure they are following their contract. The last time a USDA person was in there looking at their contract was in September of 2007. Mr. Westmoreland. So do they look at what is going on there through mail that they receive in their office, wherever that might be? Mr. Petersen. The details of how they verify the contract I don't know, but we will certainly get you-- Mr. Westmoreland. I will certainly look into it because it sounds like somebody may have missed something. The other thing I wanted to ask you about, the recall and how it goes about, well, I will ask Dr. Solomon this because you were talking about the recall and I guess you have a Web page and you put something out on the recall. Rite Aid just had a recall, I think, last week of some of these peanut products. Rite Aid is a pharmacy that I do business with in Hogansville, Georgia. Why would they have waited so long to do a recall? And I think that either you or Dr. Petersen mentioned that you know who has bought these products and who is using it and who is using it in their food processing, I guess. Why would it take so long to do the recall? Because as these recalls are stretched out, it makes it more severe to small business, I mean, if it was a one-time operation. Second point is from the FDA, I think you all had issued a statement that it was very unlikely or not likely at all that this was in I guess Jif or Peter Pan or the jarred peanut butter. Now, is that true or not true? And you can answer in any other you want. Mr. Solomon. Thank you for the questions. I will take the second one first. The name brand peanut butters, there has been no contamination. They didn't purchase any of the products from PCA. And so we have made that statement, put that out on the Web. Mr. Westmoreland. Okay. Let me point this out. Madam Chair, I think this is important from a small business standpoint especially. You spend as much time and effort putting that out as you do the other stuff because I think that is important because some people just see that there is peanut butter contaminated and they quit buying peanut butter. I think if you would spend as much time and effort saying, ``Look, these products did not buy any of the stuff. These are okay,'' you know, especially with some of your major brands, that would be something that you might want to look at. But go ahead. I am sorry to interrupt you. Mr. Solomon. Well, we did do many, many media calls and post on our Web information. And we do agree our responsibility is to make sure that contaminated product is taken off, but we also know that peanut butter and other products we regulate are nutritious and valuable commodities. So we also do try and assure people in the safety of products where we know they are safe. Related to--your first question again--I'm sorry--related to? Mr. Westmoreland. Well, I guess when did you have an inspector out there? I mean, does the FDA have any type of inspection into some of this food safety that goes on in the plants? Mr. Solomon. We do. FDA had an inspector in this plant back in 2001. And then we have had contract arrangements with the State of Georgia that does work on our behalf. And they had inspectors in that plant in 2006 and 2007 doing the work for FDA. And then the State of Georgia also conducts inspections in this plant. And I believe they have had an inspector in this plant around 7 times in the last 2 years or so. Mr. Westmoreland. So who you are contracting with is not necessarily an independent or a private contractor but could be a state or a local agency? Mr. Solomon. That is correct. We have contracts with 43 states. We provide training to those states. And they follow the same protocols and procedures that FDA uses. And the State of Georgia did conduct inspections for us in this PCA facility. Mr. Westmoreland. And one last question, Madam Chair, to Dr. Solomon. These testing facilities because, if I understand it correctly, some of this paste was sent to different testing facilities and that some of it had come back with a Salmonella as positive. But the test kept going forward until somebody said, ``No. There's no Salmonella.'' Now, what type of oversight do you all have over these testing facilities? And what type of responsibility do you have or safeguard to make sure that those tests are correct? And what type of authority do you have to punish some of these people that may give some false tests or evidently in this case a bad test? Mr. Solomon. FDA doesn't have authority over private laboratories. These laboratories had a contractual relationship with PCA. They sent them samples. We have no information that any of the tests done by the private laboratories had any problems with it. We have reviewed those tests and their testing assessment, testing protocols seem to be valid that we are using. That information goes back to PCA. And, as I mentioned before, the issue there becomes we are requesting additional access to records so that when we did an inspection, we could actually have access to those records of test results they got back from these laboratories. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you. Madam Chair, that is all I have. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Buchanan for 5 minutes of questioning. Mr. Buchanan. Thank you, Madam Chair. I wanted to switch from peanut butter to tomatoes. I represent a part of Florida, Manatee County, which has 40 percent of the tomatoes grown in that county. Dr. Solomon, let me ask you. Last year the FDA devastated our growers in my district by issuing an alert only to find out later that the problem was associated with peppers, not tomatoes. What guidelines are in place to alert the public regarding legitimate safety concerns without needlessly hurting growers? Mr. Solomon. Thank you for that question. The outbreak that you are talking about, we need to understand how the current safety system works. When people get sick, they generally go to a doctor. That information then, they may get cultured that they have a Salmonella. In this case I think it was Salmonella St. Paul was the outbreak. Mr. Buchanan. Yes. Mr. Solomon. That information goes to a state public health laboratory. That information then goes to the CDC and is put into a database called PulseNet. Then CDC when they see a cluster of these, that there seems to be something unique going on in the nation, works with the state and local public health agencies to try and get a food history, to try and determine what product may have caused this outbreak. The assessment from CDC and the states from the initial part of this outbreak is that the implicated products were tomatoes. And so they alerted FDA to that concern that appears to be a rise in the Salmonella St. Paul, several different states, an outbreak. These are all matching. And the people all report a common source as tomatoes as one of the source. Now, when you think about it, obviously going through that process of several weeks of testing, going to the doctor, having those tests analyzed, getting into a system, and then going back and having CDC or the state try and determine the product is a difficult recollection issue for folks. So they try and add additional case control studies to try and match up and get statistical evidence about what product was implicated. The initial case control studies also showed that tomatoes appeared to be the most likely vehicle. At that point in time, the decision was made to issue alerts from areas that we knew that tomatoes were being harvested at that period in time. Mr. Buchanan. Just in our case, it cost our growers millions of dollars and a lot of jobs in our local economy, which leads me to the next question, Dr. Petersen. Under what circumstance is it appropriate for the Federal government to reimburse growers for losses associated with false alerts? Mr. Petersen. At least on the meat, poultry, and egg side, if we execute a recall, meaning the plant agrees to do a voluntary recall in lieu of me containing and seizing their product, on the meat and poultry side, there is no provision for reimbursing them for executing that recall. Our focus is on at that point there is problematic product in the marketplace. It could be product that can make people sick. And we need to get it back. This did come up in the Hallmark situation. And we looked at any provisions or other reimbursement provisions. And for the packers, for the processors, there are no provisions. For farmers, at least on the livestock side, there could be provisions. And we looked at this several years ago in what was then the melamine issue. Mr. Buchanan. I am looking for tomato growers. Mr. Petersen. Yes. As far as reimbursing tomato growers, I would have to ask Dr. Solomon. That is under his purview. Mr. Buchanan. Okay. Mr. Solomon. FDA does not have any authorities in relation to reimbursement for products. Mr. Buchanan. But it does appear if it's something that egregious there should be some consideration because in our case, I know personally. I have been through these packing facilities and talked to these farmers. And they're talking millions of dollars because of these early alerts basically lost most of their crop an opportunity for that reason, which, you know, many of them live from week to week or month to month. So it was a huge economic impact in our area. And I think there should be some consideration. I don't know if this crosses a line. I think it does but in a case where the federal government makes a mistake or potentially a mistake. Mr. Solomon. We have understood that. And Congress has held previous hearings on that subject before. Mr. Buchanan. Thank you, gentlemen. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. The Chair now recognizes Mr. Thompson for 5 minutes. Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. This maybe was answered at some point, but in terms of the trend line, just from food recall incidents, are we on a level play, decreased, increased level of incidence? Mr. Solomon. For FDA, it has been probably relatively level for what we call a class I recall. We have been running around 350 class I recalls for the past several years. Obviously this recall when we look at '09 statistics will have a tremendous increase. Mr. Petersen. On the meat and poultry side, they have really leveled off the last couple of years. Our high-water mark, which is really a low-water mark, was back in 2002. We were at about 120 recalls. There were some major E. coli- related recalls, Listeria-related recalls that year. Through working with plants, having them understand what happens when we take a test, that they have the opportunity to hold the product when we do that so there is not a recall, the numbers now have been flat for the last couple of years, in the mid 50s, 55 or so, every year. Mr. Thompson. Okay. Dr. Petersen, you mentioned with the meat and meat-processing facilities, the FSIS, have they taken steps to update the requirements for the meat-processing facilities, specific hazards analysis, critical control point plans? Mr. Petersen. They raise, well, several things. As I mentioned in the opening, the plans are required for meeting their regulatory obligations. But for the small and very small plants, we think we are a good vehicle for them to provide them some information, provide them avenues for information. And so we have a lot of outreach activity where we go to them, provide them materials that we think can help them update their plans. Sometimes when there are true changes in the system, such as a spike in E. coli that has happened in the last, really, beginning of 2007, the plants are obligated to reassess what they are doing. Do they still have the right controls? Are they working? And are they tracking them correctly? And they do that, but we work with particularly the small and very small plants because of their resource limitations, give them the information to be successful, but at the end of the day, it is their obligation to be successful. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. Madam Chair, I yield back my time. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. I just have one other question for you before we finish up this panel. And that is regarding looking at all of our federal agencies which administer at least 30 different laws related to food safety, 15 agencies. Often people refer to this as a very fragmented, inconsistent, ineffective, and inefficient way to look at food safety. And I truly believe that this is one role of government: to ensure the safety of the citizens. So would it ultimately be more effective--and you can both answer this--to create a single food safety agency? Mr. Solomon. Obviously the new administration has not had an opportunity to weigh into that discussion. I will say we work very closely with the other agencies. Dr. Petersen and I have worked together for many, many years. We have MOUs with each other. We have notified each other, for example, in this particular incident, about recalls, about peanut products that may have affected USDA-regulated products. We exchange information. When we go into a facility that may have a USDA-regulated product that we have sampled, we notify them. Similarly, they do the same. We conduct some joint operations. We work closely on food defense issues. So I know the administration has got this under consideration. Mr. Petersen. I will echo the information sharing, the collaboration. Now much of that is on a personal level. I know Steve and I have talked over holidays and when there is something that needs to be resolved. And so those discussions do occur. There is a variety of, as you are no doubt aware, some legislative proposals. We are certainly interested in those. Our new Secretary Vilsack has expressed an interest in looking at that very issue. And so we are going to certainly give him the information he needs. But as far as a recommendation, a position, frankly, for us, it would be a little preliminary. But I understand the concern, where the way it is implemented, does it make sense to have all of these different players, particularly to the extent that there are any overlapping authorities in today's climate? That may not make the most sense. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. You two have known each other for a long time. You talk back and forth. But what about when one of you leaves? Mr. Petersen. Yes. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. You know, just a thought there. Mr. Westmoreland. I have just got one last question for both of you. I am assuming both agencies have looked this meat recall, the tomato recall, the peanut recall. Have you all changed any of your policies? And has anybody with either one of your agencies been disciplined or reprimanded over not following some existing policies that you had that could have led to some of this being a little loose, so to speak? Mr. Solomon. We look at every foodborne outbreak. And we try and learn lessons from it. And we do learn lessons. And we consistently improve the process. So I think we have learned lessons from the tomato outbreaks, spinach outbreaks, peanut butter outbreaks. And we incorporate those new pieces. So when I was speaking earlier about basically the new science, about understanding how Salmonella can live in a facility in a dry plant. It is some of that new science that needs to be integrated. And we do integrate that into new inspectional approaches, so the environmental pieces. There has been no disciplinary action related to any of the FDA outbreaks. Mr. Petersen. Well, I mean, you haven't said it here, but every recall for us is a failure. We have put product in the marketplace that we have said was okay, and we have to bring it back. And many recalls look alike, but there are many things we do learn from every single one. And we do our best to communicate those flaws, whether it be a plant flaw or some other activity, so other people know so they don't repeat the same mistake. And that is for recalls. That is for outbreaks. So we try to communicate ``Here is what didn't work,'' ``Here is how they got into trouble.'' Obviously we have to kind of protect their proprietary interests, but there are some lessons learned that we do get out. Some of the outbreaks that we have had as far as interagency from our perspective, we have learned from those certain regulatory approaches, legal authorities that we can work together on. So we have taken those lessons. As far as employee actions, I guess I can tell you in certain outbreaks, the appropriate personnel actions have been taken. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. I want to thank both Dr. Solomon and Dr. Petersen for being with us here today. You are now excused, and I would like to call up the second panel. Thank you very much for joining us, gentlemen. Good morning. I want to thank the second panel here for joining us today. Witnesses again will have 5 minutes to deliver their prepared statements. The timer begins when the green light is illuminated. When one minute of time remains, the light will turn yellow. And the red light will come on when the time is up. Our first witness today is Ms. Diane Austin. Ms. Austin is Vice President of Perry's Ice Cream in Akron, New York. Perry's Ice Cream is a family-owned business that was founded in 1918. Ms. Austin is testifying on behalf of the International Dairy Foods Association. The association's members represent more than 85 percent of the milk cultured products, cheese, and frozen desserts produced and marketed in the United States. Thank you, Ms. Austin. STATEMENT OF DIANE AUSTIN Ms. Austin. My name is Diane Austin. I am the Vice President of Perry's Ice Cream Company in Akron, New York. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the impact of food recalls on small food manufacturers. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. Ms. Austin. I have 3 points to make today. First, remember, American dairy products are among the safest in the world. Second, product recalls of ingredients have had devastating impacts on small food manufacturers. And, third, Congress should consider financial assistance for small businesses that have been impacted by these recalls. Perry's Ice Cream is a small family-run business that has been making great tasting ice cream for 4 generations. We manufacture 550 different ice cream products at our facility in Akron. And we employ nearly 300 team members. We make ice cream for grocery stores, convenience stores, mom and pop ice cream stands, schools, nursing homes, and many food service venues. We recently received the 2008 INNOVATE award in the agribusiness category by the Buffalo Niagara Partnership for growth, innovation, and investment in our regional economy. Our 90-year commitment to product quality and consumer safety is a key reason for our success. I am here today with the International Dairy Foods Association, which represents our nation's dairy manufacturing companies and their suppliers. More than half of IDFA member companies are small businesses. To begin, I would like to remind the Committee that the American dairy products are among the safest in the world. Dairy manufacturing plants must meet stringent federal, state, and local regulations, including those developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as state regulatory agencies. As is typical in our industry, Perry's has a plant-wide HACCP, or Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, plan, which includes good manufacturing practices, preventative maintenance programs, and other food safety and quality programs. Our good manufacturing practices are based on FDA's requirements for food processing plants. In 2008, Perry's delivered over 1,700 hours of training to our team members in the area of food safety and quality alone. Previous to the peanut recall, Perry's had only 2 limited product recalls in the past 10 years. Simply put, it is never in our best interest to cut corners or risk delivering unsafe products to our customers. Until January, Perry's had used PCA ingredients in some of our product lines. Because these ingredients are added after pasteurization, we require documentation that they meet our safety standard. And, in spite of our best efforts, we were significantly impacted by the events at PCA. Perry's issued 3 separate recall notices, impacting 44 different products. We traced distribution to 6,534 individual locations. We have conducted audits at more than 900 locations to ensure that the product had, in fact, been removed for sale. To the best of our knowledge, no consumer illnesses were related to any of our ice cream. We destroyed more than 170 tons of product, spent more than 2,100 employee hours, placed recall notices on our Web site, and responded to nearly 1,000 consumer and customer contacts. These efforts continue as we communicate with our customers and consumers and begin the resupply process. In addition to these mounting expenses, we are financially responsible to make sure that our customers are whole. Perry's is now crediting our customers for recalled product that they purchased, paying our suppliers for ingredients that were used in the recalled products, incurring costs for dumping product, legal fees, and other recall-related expenses, all this while we begin to try to reestablish a pipeline of product that has been dry for nearly 8 weeks. At the same time, we are trying to build inventories for the peak summer demand season, which is absolutely a make or break season for our industry. While we do not yet have a complete accounting of the losses, they are likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more. And we are just one of nearly 300 companies that purchased product from PCA. In spite of the significant investments that we have made over the years, to meet or exceed industry best practices in the areas of quality and food safety, we have incurred a considerable financial loss through no fault of our own. There was little hope that we will recover any of these costs from PCA. And with over 3,000 products now on the FDA recall list, there can be no doubt that other small businesses encounter the same problem. Small businesses are dependent on cash flow for operations. And those affected by the PCA recall must make difficult and immediate choices about which bills will be paid, whether people can be hired, and which products can now be produced. We fear that before this is all over, many small business manufacturers or small food manufacturers will go under. This Committee and Congress should consider providing financial assistance, preferably in the form of grants or loan guarantees, to help small businesses that have suffered significant financial losses as a result of a recall prompted through no fault of their own. As a small business, we would ask Congress to carefully balance business responsibility and government regulation to ensure a safe food supply but to be careful before assuming that more regulation is always the answer. On behalf of Perry's Ice Cream and the 530 members of the IDFA, I would like to thank you for the opportunity for us to voice our views this morning. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Diane Austin is included in the appendix at page 63.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. Our next witness is Mr. Mike Ambrosio. Mr. Ambrosio is Vice President of Quality Assurance at the Wakefern Food Corporation in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The Wakefern Corporation is a retailer-owned cooperative comprised of entrepreneurs that own and operate supermarkets. Mr. Ambrosio is testifying on behalf of the Food Marketing Institute, which develops and promotes policies supporting food retailers and wholesalers. Welcome. Mr. Ambrosio. Thank you. STATEMENT OF MIKE AMBROSIO Mr. Ambrosio. Thank you. Chairwoman Dahlkemper, Ranking Member Westmoreland, and members of the Regulation and Health Subcommittee, I am Mike Ambrosio, Vice President of Quality Assurance for Wakefern Food Corporation. And I have been in charge of food safety programs at Wakefern for 29 years. I am honored to appear before you today to testify on behalf of my company and our members but also FMI, Food Marketing Institute, our trade association, representing over 1,500 retail members. Founded in 1946, Wakefern Food Corporation has grown from a small, struggling cooperative into a strong regional player. Headquartered in Keasbey, New Jersey, Wakefern is comprised of 45 members, who independently own and operate supermarkets under the ShopRite banner in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware. While we are the largest retailer-owned cooperative in the nation, the majority of our members own 1 or 2 stores and understand the challenges that businesses face. Only owners that understand these needs of their customers and community are able to survive and prosper. As a result of our members' dedication to their customers and communities, ShopRite has been named the New Jersey Corporate Philanthropist of the Year by the Community Foundation of New Jersey. And America's Second Harvest Food Bank Network has also recognized ShopRite as a Grocery Distributor of the Year for its ShopRite Partners in Caring Program, a year-round initiative dedicated to fighting hunger. As part of our dedication to the consumer, our most important goal is to ensure that the food resale is safe. our store has many prevention programs in place to protect our customers, such as consumer education campaigns, employee food safety training, extensive sanitation programs, and food safety management systems. But all of these prevention programs at retail level cannot ensure that we deliver safe food to our customers if the food coming into our stores isn't already produced and processed to the highest standards. When we do receive notification that a product is adulterated, we take a variety of vital steps to ensure that the effective product has been removed from our shelves as quickly as possible and also to notify our customers in certain instances. However, this process is often challenging, time- consuming, and expensive due to the loss of man-hours and the loss of sales created not only by not having the product taken off the shelves but also due to a recall impact on consumer confidence. I would like to provide the Committee a snapshot of what steps we take when we are notified that a product has been recalled. The notification process, when we receive notification a product has been recalled through a variety of different means, we use third party services that we subscribe to, direct contact by the vendor through monitoring government Web sites, such as the FDA and USDA, or through a variety of media outlets. With any notification method, it is vital that we receive the necessary information, such as product name, correct UPC codes, product size, and sell-by dates to ensure we know exactly what product is being recalled. The average size grocery store has over 45,000 items on their shelves every day. In the case of the high-profile Peanut Corporation of America recalls, the FDA as of March 9th had over 3,200 listed products on their Web site. The actions we take once we receive the necessary information in the Quality Assurance Department, we notify Consumer Affairs. While comparing the affected UPC codes to our current inventory, all identified products are embargoed and segregated to a designated holding area. In addition, recalled UPC codes are locked out of our point-of-sale system. So product cannot be scanned for sale at our registers or sold through the front end. Our bulletin is sent to our store owners and applicable in- store divisions and management staff. The information is posted on our internal Web site, also an external Web site if you log onto the shoprite.com. Class I recalls triggers automatically phone calls to notify our store owners, management staff directly to reinforce the bulletin. We also have a third party private visit to the stores to ensure that the class I product has been removed from the shelves. At the same time we are removing products at store level, our Consumer Affairs Department is creating signage for display at point of sale and sending releases directly to the media. That's a vital piece of this because consumer education when it comes to recalled product is key. Depending on the type of recall, they also search for data from our loyalty card program. That allows us to notify our customers directly through phone calls and about product they had purchased. It is important that grocers are able to employ a variety of different methods to notify consumers. I am proud of the actions we take as a company to remove adulterated product. As a matter of fact, last fiscal year we had 214 recalls, 27 class I, 43 pharmacy recalls. That accounts for 238 UPC codes that were blocked out at the front end as well as the time dedicated to that. Over 2,140 hours are dedicated to that, 305 working days if you want to break that down. And these don't even include the numbers with PCA. Our trade association, FMI, is working with Wakefern and other members of all sizes dedicated to continually improving food safety. And we also support the FDA and the USDA with regard to mandatory recall authority that they have. We also believe that suppliers should be--[The prepared statement of Mike Ambrosio is included in the appendix at page 71.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you, Mr. Ambrosio. Mr. Ambrosio. Okay. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. We will cover more this in the questions. Thank you. Mr. Conrad is next. Mr. Conrad, Ken Conrad, is President of Libby Hill Seafood Restaurants in Greensboro, North Carolina. Libby Hill Seafood was founded in 1943 by Mr. Conrad's father. It operates restaurants in North Carolina and Virginia. He is testifying on behalf of the National Restaurant Association, which represents more than 380,000 restaurant establishments. Welcome, Mr. Conrad. STATEMENT OF KEN CONRAD Mr. Conrad. Chairwoman Dahlkemper, Ranking Member Westmoreland, and members of the Subcommittee on Regulations and Healthcare, on behalf of the National Restaurant Association, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you today regarding the impact of food product recalls on restaurants. My name is Ken Conrad. I am the Chairman of the Board of Libby Hill Restaurants. For the past 5 years, I have had the privilege of serving as the North Carolina delegate to the National Restaurant Association. I also serve as Chair of the North Carolina Restaurant and Lodging Association. And by operating a chain of seafood restaurants, it has kept me very active in the seafood industry. I currently serve as Vice Chair of the National Fisheries Institute. My family continues to own and operate Libby Hill Restaurants, and I am proud to say that my son today is the third generation to run the business. Three weeks from today, we will begin our 57th year of serving seafood in a family- friendly atmosphere. We currently operate 12 units scattered across western North Carolina and southwest Virginia. The restaurant industry is comprised of 945,000 food service locations, 13 million employees nationwide. We serve 130 million guests every day, and every $1 million of revenue in our industry creates 33 new jobs for the economy. Seven out of 10 restaurants are single-unit operators, with 91 percent of eating-and-drinking places having 50 or fewer employees. We are truly an industry of small businesses. Food safety is of the utmost importance for restaurants. Restaurants have taken the lead in ensuring food safety within our 4 walls with the National Restaurant Association and its members making a multi billion-dollar investment to continuously improve food safety programs and develop state-of- the-art food safety education. We are proud of ServSafe, the food safety education program that sets the standard for the industry. Foodborne illness outbreaks and the recalls that follow have greatly impacted our industry. Lapses in management in the food supply chain can create negative consequences to consumer confidence, as recent outbreaks and recalls have shown. Most recalls are due to mislabeling mistakes, but very large outbreaks and recalls due to adulteration or contamination indicate more could be done in both the supply chain and with improvements in the federal and state regulatory approach. Since 2006, the United States has dealt with the impact of foodborne illness outbreaks and recalls resulting in the contamination of tomatoes, serrano peppers, chicken and turkey pot pies, ground beef, chili sauce, lettuce, spinach, and peanut butter. Currently, the industry continues to cope with peanut butter recalls resulting from a Salmonellosis outbreak involving thousands. It is likely this outbreak will become one of the most infamous outbreaks of foodborne disease. When a foodborne illness outbreak occurs, the first priority is to identify the affected product and immediately remove it from the food supply. Restaurants often use an abundance of caution when learning of an outbreak and may just simply choose to remove that item from the menu until the dust clears and it has gone away. Trace-back investigations to determine the source of outbreaks can require extensive resources and may result in irreparable damage to a food service establishment. Therefore, it is critical that each piece of the investigation be thorough, complete, and accurate. We must remember that trace- back investigation recalls are reactive measures. We should not neglect the importance of preventing contamination to ensure safety to reduce or mitigate the need to recall product. Adequate funding to food safety agencies at both the state and federal levels to ensure appropriate staffing and expertise is mandatory, improved collaboration and communication between government and industry during the investigation of a complex outbreak, communication and education strategies to effectively inform consumers in the event of an outbreak or recall. We need stronger standards and practices for fresh produce and additional tools such as recall authority, traceability, and improved epidemiological investigation. In conclusion, the safety of the food supply must and will continue to be the top priority for the restaurant industry. We stand by and are ready to work with Congress, the administration, and our food chain partners to improve food safety and the needed reforms. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. And I will be happy to answer questions at the appropriate time.[The prepared statement of Ken Conrad is included in the appendix at page 78.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. Mr. Westmoreland will introduce our next witness. Mr. Westmoreland. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. It is my pleasure to introduce a friend of mine and fellow Georgian, Mr. Don Koehler. Mr. Koehler is the Executive Director of the Georgia Peanut Commission. Mr. Koehler and his family reside in Tifton, Georgia, where he has lived for 25 years. He is a native of Alberta, Alabama and received a B. S. in agricultural science from Auburn University in 1979. In 1986, he became the Executive Director of the Georgia Peanut Commission. In that position, he has served in numerous positions of leadership within the peanut industry. He oversees the Commission's programs in the areas of research, education, and promotion, including advocacy for the farmers in Atlanta, Washington, and on international issues. He currently serves on the Agricultural Technical Advisory Committee on trade for cotton, tobacco, peanuts, and planting seeds. He also serves on the management team of the Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, which represents peanut farmers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. I want to thank Don for being here today to share his perspective on behalf of the Georgia Peanut Commission. And I know we all look forward to hearing your testimony, Don. Thank you. Mr. Koehler. Thank you, Congressman. STATEMENT OF DON KOEHLER Mr. Koehler. Good morning, Chairwoman Dahlkemper, Ranking Member Westmoreland, and members of the Committee. I am Don Koehler, the Executive Director of the Georgia Peanut Commission. On February 1st of this year, I celebrated 22 and a half years in that position. The current outbreak and recall attributed to the Peanut Corporation of America is the most devastating issue to ever face our industry in my time there. We currently have 4,535 peanut farmers in Georgia. That number has the potential to decline in 2009. An inscription over the entrance to Washington's Union Station reads, ``the farm, best home of family, source of our national wealth, the natural providence.'' That is true even today. Farmers provide more to the economic health of our economy than at any time in history. On January 10th, the U.S. Food and drug Administration issued a voluntary recall notice on peanut butter processed at a plant owned by the Peanut Corporation of America. The initial recall was expanded to roasted peanuts and later to include all product ever produced at a PCA plant in Texas. PCA was a supplier of peanut butter to the food service industry and a supplier of ingredients to food manufacturers. They had a broad reach for a small processor. The recall has been ongoing for 2 months and has rippled throughout the peanut industry. We are dealing with a situation of historic proportions. The full impact will not fully be known for some time. Rebuilding cannot fully begin until the outbreak is over and the recall complete. The 2008 peanut crop was a record crop, and we were faced with managing a surplus. USDA has been slow to react to the current market conditions in setting the weekly posted price, which has complicated this issue. Peanut sales are nonexistent for farmers who have uncontracted peanuts. Yet, USDA has not sufficiently reduced the posted price. After the recall, sales of peanut products tumbled. General agreement is that peanut butter consumption is off as much as 20 percent. Peanut butter processing accounts for about 70 percent of the Southeastern peanut market. Due to uncertainty, no contracts are being offered to farmers. This is critical because farmers need a contract to get financing and to make planting decisions. In 2 Georgia towns, groups of farmers built modern shelling facilities to add value to their peanuts. Each has fewer than 50 employees, and they will be impacted. Peanut buying points are paid on the volume that they handle. And then there is the impact on our farmers. The market has collapsed. So the best case scenario seems to be $355 per ton, which is the loan rate. Using projections for only variable costs, excluding land rent, farmers would need irrigated yields of 4,700 pounds per acre and non-irrigated yields of 3,500 pounds to achieve a zero cash flow. Typically, the yield in the Southeast would be less than 3,800 pounds irrigated and about 2,800 pounds for non- irrigated. There is little to no likelihood of farmers' cash flowing this year. The National Center for Peanut Competitiveness took a 5- year Olympic average of U.S. peanut production and used USDA's posted price for peanuts and came up with an average price of $408-plus a ton. The difference of that price and the loan rate include factors showing a loss that ranges from about $114 to $121 million. If you take into account a loss of production, these numbers grow. Growers anticipate a reduction of acres of at least a third. The NCPC indicates that that reduction could be 40 to 60 percent based on their representative farm. This is a loss of $225 to $450 million just at the farm gate. If you use a conservative multiplier of 2, which is very conservative, we are looking at potential for a billion-dollar impact in the peanut industry in this country. What can be done to help us? The formula that USDA uses to set the national posted price is a farce. Congress should ask USDA to review this formula and report back in a firm time and come up with something that is realistic. Peanut butter has been a staple for U.S. and international feeding programs. It is good, and it is good for you. And we need USDA to look at this and to really come to the table now. We need them to buy peanuts and peanut butter now more than ever. Peanut butter is 25 percent protein and about $2 a pound. So the only thing that even beats that is whole chickens and chicken legs with the or bone in. Farmers have felt the impact of this recall, but the thing that I will tell you is that the growers in Southeastern United States, peanut farmers, are here to work with Congress to find ways to make sure that this can never happen again.[The prepared statement of Don Koehler is included in the appendix at page 83.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you, Mr. Koehler. Our next witness is Ms. Sheryl Vanco, who is from my district. She is a dairy farmer from Bear Lake, Pennsylvania. In addition to being a Pennsylvania Farm Union member, Ms. Vanco is also active with the Farmers Union Milk Producers Association and serves on the Pennsylvania Animal Health Commission. She is here to testify on behalf of the National Farmers Union. The National Farmers Union represents 250,000 farm and ranch families. Welcome, Ms. Vanco. STATEMENT OF SHERYL VANCO Ms. Vanco. Thank you, Madam Chairman Dahlkemper, Ranking Member Westmoreland, and members of the Subcommittee. We thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Sheryl Vanco. My husband and I have and operate a 95-cow dairy in northwestern Pennsylvania. We hire 2 full- time workers. One of them is an Amish man. My husband and I both work full-time on the farm. It is a lifestyle that we chose and that we love. As a member of the Animal Health Commission, I help to oversee all of the animal health rules and regulations in the State of Pennsylvania. And we have 3 animal health diagnostic labs that we oversee. We are proud of our industry and the dairy industry. We produce a quality product, and we produce quality meat products. We work hard every day to ensure that they are wholesome when they meet the market. Our farm facilities are inspected by state and federal inspections. And annually our milk is tested for Brucellosis. There is mandatory monthly testing for bacteria. Weekly our milk is tested for somatic cell counts, which indicate the health of the cow's udder. Every drop of milk that we ship to market is tested for antibiotic residues. It is very costly if a farmer has a load of antibiotic milk. He loses not only the value of the milk of his on the truck, but he is responsible for paying the value of all of the other milk. Typically there is $10,000 worth of milk on the truck. We routinely vaccinate our cows to prevent diseases and take very good care of them if they need prompt health with any of the medical emergencies that they encounter. Veterinarians are in very short supply for large animals in this country now. So most of the farmers and herdsmen do a lot of the veterinary work themselves. We have nutritionists who advise us on the diet for the cows to keep them healthy. Cows have a very high value. And they are the heart of the dairy business. We work very hard to take very good care of our cows. We appreciate them both for their value and the emotional attachment that we have with them when we work with them every day. When the cow's productive life is over, it joins the beef cattle in the market. The animal is visually inspected before and after slaughter. Unhealthy cattle, whether they are downers or not, do not enter the food chain. Our domestic meat and milk products are highly regulated for quality and safety on the farm level. Dairy is one of the most highly inspected and regulated industries in the food industry. When there is a problem that leads to a dairy or beef recall, the contamination is usually found to have been after it has left the farm. Not only does the product recall of hamburger affect the financial loss of the processing facility, but it leads back to a reduced consumption by consumer, which leads to lower prices for the farmers. This works the same way in milk products. As soon as people back off from purchasing them, it ultimately leads back to us receiving less money for our milk or our meat that we are selling. My own milk coop processes their milk in a cheese plant in Ohio. We sell it to the Ohio plant. If there were to be a product recall for dairy in the country, we are faced with financial loss because of the loss of consumption. But if we had a recall of the product from the plant that we ship our milk to, it would be much more devastating to us. If it was a large enough recall to require the shutdown of the plant or to lead to bankruptcy of the plant, then we would be looking for another market out of the milk marketing generally. And we at this time have way too much milk on that market. So we would have very, very little financial ability to sell that milk. It would lead to devastation to the farms that have this supply on the milk. We are very highly regulated on the farms, but we think that imports pose a greater threat to the health value in the United States than the farm-produced milk in this country. Only a minimal amount of that milk is inspected. And we think that it should all meet the same health requirements that we meet. The recent melamine scare should wake everyone up to the fact that we need to regulate these imports. That melamine came in in powder into this country, could have very easily been in food bags that produced the cheese that we ate. We are very, very lucky that it was just showing up in a couple of candy products. It could have been far more reaching in this country, and we could have been facing the health problems that the Chinese have faced. It comes into this country under the guise of MPCs, which is multiple protein components. It was missed in the last trade rounds. So it is not regulated. It does not really have a standard of identify to inspect it. And it is both economically devastating to this country and poses a health risk to the products that we have worked very hard to produce for you. The impact food recalls would have, especially negative impact, on family farmers' and ranchers' recent contamination events have demonstrated in animal and non-animal foods, the current U.S. laws and their enforcement are not sufficient. We need more inspectors for the imports. And we need to highly regulate and keep on top of these. We think we have in the dairy industry enough regulations in process, but we need more enforcement.[The prepared statement of Sheryl Vanco is included in the appendix at page 85.] Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Thank you. I just want to let you know that we may be called out for a vote. So we will try to get through some questions here quickly. I would just like to ask the panel. And any of you or all of you could address this. Obviously each one of your industries is affected by recalls in different ways, but each one of your industries, which is consisting of small businesses, entrepreneurs, is affected, sometimes in a devastating way, with these recalls. So as we look forward, we certainly don't want to impose undue regulations on struggling small businesses, whether that be the farmers, whether that be restaurants, whether that be the producers. We have got 15 agencies already working on this issue. How can we who are looking at policy work in collaboration with small businesses in whichever industry we are talking about here in terms of the food supply to help you produce what you want to produce? And that is safe food for the people of this nation. I mean, that is kind of the crux of it here. How can we work better collaboratively with you through the agencies that we currently have? I asked the question of the previous panel. Do we need to look at one agency. Do you have some thoughts on that from your perspective on the ground? Ms. Austin. I will start that. I am sure some of my other panel members probably have some thoughts on that as well. One of the things that we would like to see is a generally accepted overview of the Global Food Safety Initiative, GFSI. There are a lot of activities underway regarding third party certification for imports. And some of those same practices could be applied domestically so that as an auditing body or anyone who is looking at a facility has got commonly accepted practices that are applied routinely. So that, for instance, in our facility, New York State Ag Markets is in. We are an organic-certified facility. We have an auditor for that. The military comes in and audits. We have New York State Ag Markets come in routinely for other things as well. We have customers who require third party audits. Everyone has a certain kind of oversight that they would like to see. If there was one standard generally recognized, we could streamline a lot of those activities and the burdens that that places on a small business so that there could be consistent application of practices. It will make it easier for us to train our people and increase the opportunity for small businesses to improve their food safety without taking on additional responsibilities. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Mr. Ambrosio? Mr. Ambrosio. There is a difference between what Diane is speaking about and inspections. Inspections is a snapshot at the time when you go into a facility. And you spoke about that earlier with the government panel. I think what is important to capitalize and what you are saying is GFSI, the Global Food Safety Initiative, it's recognizing food management systems. It is a cultural change, I think. And that is what we need to look at in this country. We need to have a cultural change on how we go about doing business. We have gotten away from actually having management and everybody else buy into the fact that you have to produce food in a safe manner before it leaves the facility. And if we are going to go about just having inspections, inspections, inspections, I could tell you that I have been doing this a long time. You can't inspect quality or food safety into any system. You have to have a culture. And when you embrace an SQF model or an IFSS or a VRC that are all members of GFSI, you have a foundation of a management system that is going to be working in a good way. And I think they alluded on it a little bit about third party inspections. I think that is important. It is a good adjunct to what the government is doing right now. It can't replace government oversight. I think it is a good adjunct to what they have. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Does anyone else want to comment on this? Mr. Koehler. Again I want to go back to the whole issue of culture within a business. And what we were dealing with in the peanut recall is very evident now when you look at 2 factories with the conditions that they had, it is very evident that it was a culture within that business. Certainly the thing that needs to be there is a major amount of accountability for these people in the food business, for the food production business. They have got to be accountable for what they do. And though it has put this business out of business, there needs to be a lot of accountability that even losing the business might not be all that you have. Our organization wants to be sure we work with Congress on everything that is going on. And so we have not talked about issues on mandatory recall, any of those kinds of things right now, though they are there, because we want to look at everything there and find the best result that comes out of the United States Congress for the food-processing industry. We are not terribly negative toward mandatory recalls, but they come with a great deal of responsibility. I want to use a personal example to tell you how that is. I have a farmer friend who grows peanuts, but the other thing he grows is tomatoes. In the just advisory that happened last year, he had beautiful table-stock tomatoes. I ended up going to his farm, and we bought 5-gallon buckets full of these tomatoes that we picked ourselves for $5 for a 5-gallon bucket and canned those tomatoes. These were table-stock tomatoes. And then they find out that it was a problem not on tomatoes but on peppers. So anything we do has to make a good system better. And it has to be based, too, on the science that we can say, ``Hey, there is a reason that we did it.'' Mr. Conrad. There is currently a bill in Congress that I had worked with Senator Burr in North Carolina about and Senator Durbin and Gregg have cosponsored in regard to food safety. It does have some things that restaurants are certainly looking at. And certainly it seems to be a path that we may want to go down. Two things have happened in the last several years that we would like strengthened: the requirements on produce safety and mandatory recall. We think that both of these probably need to happen. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Ms. Vanco, do you have any comment on this? Ms. Vanco. The only comment that I have is when they did the Homeland Security, they moved some of the testing to Homeland Security from USDA. I think it would be a good idea to put it back with USDA, consolidate that back into one entity again. Chairwoman Dahlkemper. Okay. I'm going to yield to Mr. Westmoreland at this poi"
