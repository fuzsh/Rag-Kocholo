        "text": "The Pathfoot Building is probably the most beautiful, the most civilized, the most sensitive and intelligent piece of large scale modern architecture and planning that has been achieved in Scotland.\n\nDavid Baxandall, former Director of the National Galleries of Scotland, speaking in January 1970.\n\nThe Pathfoot Building is an outstanding example of post-war modernist architecture and is widely recognised to be of international significance. During the year’s exhibition theme 'Space & Place', we took the opportunity to celebrate the design of this building, home to the Art Collection and an integral part of the history of the campus.\n\nStirling is one of the so-called ‘plate glass’ universities which were founded during the 1960s. The name reflects the large amounts of glass used in many of the designs. The functional minimalist style used had first emerged during the 1930s and became dominant after the Second World War. In Pathfoot, the design responds elegantly to its sloped hillside setting, with a series of low-rise stepped levels and multiple glazed internal courtyards, merging inside with out.\n\nThe building has evolved over the decades: the width of the J corridor was reduced to accommodate additional office space and the new A corridor at the front was added in 1993. Even though the Pathfoot Building has been altered and extended over the years, the spirit of the original design remains, and is appreciated by those who visit, study and work here.\n\nYou can read more about the building on our Culture on Campus blog.\n\nThe University of Stirling’s 2023 Culture on Campus exhibition celebrated the life and work of one of the most distinctive British filmmakers of the twentieth century. Born in Bangalore, India, in 1923, Lindsay Anderson reflected British life and society through the lens of a series of remarkable films including This Sporting Life (1963), O Lucky Man! (1972) and If…. (1969), a poetic and surreal vision of revolt and rebellion at a public school, and one of the key British films of the 1960s.\n\nAnderson’s contribution to British cultural life extended to his work as a film critic, author and theatre director. He was part of the generation that transformed the post-war cultural and artistic world in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nNever Apologise marked the centenary of Anderson’s birth by opening up the extensive collection of his personal and working papers held in the University of Stirling Archives. It presented an archival journey through Anderson’s filmmaking career tracing the documentary grit, Hollywood glamour and critical struggles of a life lived behind the camera. The exhibition featured fresh new insights into Anderson’s life and work through contributions from actors, artists, academics and curators.\n\nThese personal responses to Anderson and his archive included memories of working with the director, favourite scenes from his films, overlooked aspects of his career and archival discoveries, all illustrated with previously unseen documents and photographs from a unique cinematic collection.\n\nThe exhibition was on display in the Macrobert Art House from 23 January to 30 April 2023 and was accompanied by events and screenings which providing further opportunities to find out more about Anderson’s career and celebrate his work.\n\nCulture on Campus is a collaboration between the Art Collection, University Archives and the Macrobert Arts Centre which aims to develop a creative environment where creative thinking and creative acts are at the heart of our identity as a place of learning.\n\nThe Lindsay Anderson Archive\n\nThe Lindsay Anderson Archive was deposited with the University of Stirling Archives in 2003 and forms part of its extensive holdings relating to filmmaking. The collection provides a comprehensive record of Anderson’s personal and working lives.\n\nIt includes detailed correspondence, production notes, scripts, photographs, promotional material and press cuttings relating to all of his films and forty theatre productions he directed. Personal material includes diaries, memorabilia, photographs and awards, along with his personal library of books and VHS collection.\n\nThe University of Stirling Archives\n\nLocated in the University Library, the University Archives collects, preserves and makes accessible material across a wide range of research areas.\n\n2 May 2023\n\nJoin us for a reading with writers, Nikita Parik and Shreyasi Sharma, amongst the Pathfoot artworks. As part of the Art Collection's theme of Space and Place, Nikita and Shreyasi will read work related to urban localities, habitats and non-human life. They will also be talking to Gemma Robinson about how their previous and new work is engaged in mapping and transforming spaces and bodies in poetry and prose.\n\nNikita Parik\n\nNikita Parik holds an M.A. in Linguistics and another M.A. in English. She is the author of Diacritics of Desire (2019), her debut book of poems, and the translator of Amour and Apocalypse (2020), a Hindi novel based on the reinterpretation of the flood myth. Her third and latest book, My City is a Murder of Crows (2022), was shortlisted for the Rabindranath Tagore Literary Prize. Her books have been reviewed/featured in The Sunday Statesman, Business Standard, The Journal of Commonwealth Literature, Outlook India, The Wire, and Kavya Bharati.\n\nShe is also one of the founder editors of EKL Review. You can read her interview with Kitaab (Singapore), and listen to her poetry podcast with Rattle magazine (USA).\n\nShreyasi Sharma\n\nShreyasi Sharma has an MA in Literary Art from Dr B.R. Ambedkar University, Delhi, and since her graduation has worked in publishing houses, think tanks and schools. Her words have appeared in The Hindu, The Citizen, Feminism in India, Indian Cultural Forum, and Current Conservation, and in 2022 Red River Press published her poems and narrative non-fiction about the city in an anthology titled Of Dry Tongues and Brave Hearts.\n\nCharles Wallace Fellowships\n\nNikita Parik is the 2023 Charles Wallace Fellow in Creative Writing at Stirling and Shreyasi Sharma is the 2023 Charles Wallace Fellow in Creative Writing at the University of Kent.\n\nEach year, Stirling and Kent host an Indian creative writer to work alongside students and staff. Charles Wallace Fellowships are funded by Charles Wallace India Trust (CWIT). The organisation funds fellowships across the UK for Indian academics, translators and creative practitioners.\n\nFor more information about this event and Stirling’s fellowship please contact Gemma Robinson, at gemma.robinson@stir.ac.uk.\n\n14 October 2022\n\nJoin us for an exciting lunchtime screening of new work, OMOS, followed by a Q&A with lead artist Rhys Hollis, chaired by Briana Pegado.\n\nOMOS is a 20-min moving image artwork that pays homage to Scotland’s untold Black history at Stirling Castle, and celebrates Black and Black LGBTQ excellence and performance in Scotland.\n\nThe artwork is filmed in Puck’s Glen and Stirling Castle and created collaboratively by a group of award-winning artists; cabaret performer Rhys Hollis (also known as Rhys’ Pieces), mezzo-soprano Andrea Baker, dancer Divine Tasinda and pole artist Kheanna Walker. The film partly follows the format of queer cabaret and each artist has used their unique skills and perspective to create a solo performance for the film.\n\nOMOS is inspired by connections between Puck’s Glen, Stirling Castle and Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which is also connected to a historical performance given to King James VI of Scotland. At Stirling Castle in 1594, a feared lion was replaced by an unnamed Black man, who pulled a chariot through the castle’s Great Hall. He was one of a number of Black people who appeared in performances at the Scottish court throughout Scottish history. This film is an homage to those people and a celebration of Black performance in Scotland today.\n\nThe name OMOS originally was an acronym for the phrase ‘O monstrous! O strange!’, a quote from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. As the project developed, this phrase has been morphed to stand for ‘Our Movement, Our Stories’. The film has an ambiguous title of solely ‘OMOS’.\n\nIn OMOS the artists occupy space as they both draw on the past and look to the future. The screening will then be followed by a Q&A with lead artist Rhys Hollis, chaired by Briana Pegado.\n\n3 December 2021 - 12 August 2022\n\n‘I am doing this because the world needs hope. With hope we can overcome the onslaught of constant negative messages from traditional and new media which can cause us despair. With hope, we can overcome the paralysis of worry, a habit we can get into which serves no useful purpose and can even make us ill. Hope can help us overcome the challenges of mental illness, something which has become an increasing problem since the global pandemic which started in 2020. Most importantly, hope creates a feeling of expectation and that can create the desire to achieve the very thing we hope for. And it is desire, not ability, that determines our success.’\n\nGeorge Berrie\n\nThis exhibition, which formed part of our 'Art of Wellbeing' series of exhibitions in 2021, explored ‘Hope’, and each image conveys an element of Maslow's theory, beginning with our need for fresh air, clean water, nutritious food, shelter, sex, etc., and eventually through to what Maslow called ‘self-actualisation’. Hope comes from the fact that we can reach higher levels of being and that this hope creates an expectation. In turn, that expectation can lead to a desire to reach that higher level. Desire to reach a goal, rather than raw ability, is what the artist believes is the key element of personal success.\n\nGeorge Berrie was born in Fallin, near Stirling, where he grew up in relative poverty in the 1960s. After leaving school he went to Heriot Watt University to read actuarial mathematics but became disillusioned and joined an insurance company to earn money. At 39 he became the CEO of the largest insurance company in New Zealand, and a few years later he was appointed to the board of Norwich Union, then became a director with Aviva.\n\nThe ‘golden spur’ to escape his childhood poverty, having done its job, caused him to reflect on future goals. It was at this point that he was inspired to do an arts degree at Stirling University, relinquishing his business roles and becoming a full-time student. After graduating in 2015, he went on a sabbatical to Beirut, Lebanon, to discover what he wanted to achieve over the next five years. The desire to become a digital artist, and this resultant collection of images, were two products of that exercise.\n\nThe project reflects his observation of Maslow’s theory in real life during his career, coupled with the knowledge of theory from his studies. His aim is that the images will create an initial curiosity, followed by a sense of familiarity, and then an interaction that involves some emotion. His next portfolio is being planned and is based on dreams. He lives in Perth with his wife Julie.\n\nFriday art blog: Hope\n\n1 September 2021 to 12 August 2022\n\nEveryone deserves a second chance.\n\nTimes are changing in Scotland. A new way of thinking is emerging and a movement for a smarter justice system is beginning.\n\nThrough 18 individual stories, the exhibition explored individual experience of the Community Justice system in Scotland. Sentences served in the community are more effective than sentences served in prison. Yet nearly two thirds of Scots don’t know what community justice is. This exhibition aimed to address this issue by raising awareness of what community justice is and build confidence in it as an effective sentencing option that reduces offending, reduces the number of victims and improves lives.\n\nSecond Chancers explored positivity, hope, aspiration and chaos through the lens of people with experience of the justice system. It gave a voice to people who have been let down and rejected, who have pulled themselves up and fought for better. They have grabbed a second chance. They don’t want your sympathy and they don’t need your pity. They are asking you to listen.\n\nThis exhibition was delivered in conjunction with Community Justice Scotland, Stirling Community Justice Partnership, Stirling Community Planning Partnership and the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University. It was part of our theme of exhibitions during 2021-2022 entitled ‘The Art of Wellbeing’.\n\nMore information about Second Chancers can be found on the project website.\n\n3 and 20 March 2021\n\nIntroductory workshops into the world of Forest Bathing.\n\n\"Nature heals...sitting, sharing space with nature, admiring beauty, or simply playing amongst it...nature is awesome\"\n\nForest Bathing, or Shinrin-yoku is the practise of immersing yourself in nature; ‘bathing’ in the awesome goodness that trees release into the atmosphere; reaping the benefits from magic little things called ‘phytoncides’ and receiving mental calmness from the fractal patterns, vibrant shades of green and calming blues around us.\n\nThis session was led by Cath Wright of Highland Quietlife. Cath said:\n\n'During the session I shall be walking amongst the woods in my local area and you may also choose to go for a walk near trees, grass, gardens etc, or you may sit inside near an open window or you could consider sitting with a few houseplants or even vegetables! As your guide I will lead you through a series of what we call ‘invitations’, each one lasting for around 10 minutes and aimed to engage you with one of the senses, to help ground you and calm the mind. If you are not able to go outside to join the walk, you will still be able to benefit and will hopefully find just as much joy investigating your Spider Plant from your armchair, as you would a swaying tall Silver Birch! Traditionally we end a session with tea and snacks and I would ask you to bring something along to complete your walk with'.\n\nForest Bathing was part of our theme 'The Art of Wellbeing': a series of exhibitions and events exploring health and wellbeing.\n\n17 February 2020 - 31 August 2021\n\nAlan Dimmick was the Art Collection’s Photographer in Residence over the course of the University’s 50th anniversary year in 2017. His remit was to capture a ‘Portrait of the Campus’, exploring the unique natural, built and human environment of the University.\n\nWhilst the University archives and Art Collection hold a collection of fine photographs from the early days of the University in the 1960s and ‘70s, relatively little had been done to document and explore the changing physical and human landscape of the campus in recent decades. Alan’s residency contributed to redressing this balance.\n\nThis exhibition showcased a selection of the photographs taken during Alan’s residency. The full collection has been deposited in the University archive; thus creating a rich artistic, contemporary record of the rhythm of life on campus and bringing up to date the historic photographic material already held in our collections.\n\nAlan Dimmick was born in Glasgow in 1961. He bought his first camera (a Russian Zenith) in 1977, the same year that he converted the toilets in his secondary school annex into a darkroom. He went on to study photography at Glasgow College of Building and Printing from 1979–82 and was a founding member of Glasgow Photography Group, exhibiting at their inaugural exhibition in Hillhead Library in 1988. Since the mid-1990s Dimmick has documented the lively contemporary art and music scene of his home city, Glasgow, capturing many of the events that have shaped a significant period in Scottish culture.\n\n29 January - 31 December 2020\n\nHere we showcased the work of artist, poet and University of Stirling alumnus Alec Finlay who returned to his alma mater in 2013 as the University’s first Artist in Residence, to research the science and culture of beekeeping and create new bee-themed public sculptures for the University Art Collection, while drawing attention to the plight of the honeybee. He said: “Stirling is renowned worldwide for its scientific bee research, particularly its work on the destructive impact of insecticides on wild bee populations, so I was able to draw on this expertise and use it to inform my work”.\n\nAlec Finlay was funded by the Leverhulme Trust and worked collaboratively between Stirling’s Faculties of Natural Sciences and Arts & Humanities. He collaborated in particular with Professor Kathleen Jamie, Chair in Creative Writing and multi-award-winning poet, who shares his creative interests in the natural world.\n\nHis research at Stirling was wide-reaching and explored the symbolism of bees in ancient myth and philosophy, and the recurring motif of the bee in accounts of politics, economics and society. He also looked at contemporary scientific studies of bee communication, cognitive behaviour and honeycomb construction and considered bees’ relevance in a diverse range of subjects including architecture, Systems Theory, informatics and social networks.\n\nHe produced a ‘creative survey’ of the UK’s bee population and translated his research into poetry and sculpture. Together with the Art Collection’s curators he installed these permanent artworks on campus. The project reinforced Stirling’s reputation for multidisciplinary research and cross-cultural innovation, as well as its longstanding commitment to making art an integral part of the everyday campus experience.\n\n26 April - 1 Sep 2019\n\nNovember 1918 marked the centenary of the end of the First World War. Throughout this time ceremonies were held to commemorate those who fought and died during the conflict across the world. The ‘war to end all wars’ claimed the lives of around 8.5 million soldiers and countless more were wounded. At the home front too, civilians were compelled to participate in the War economy by working in factories or by dawning uniforms. The end of the War in Britain ushered in a new democratic age as women and working-class men received the vote for the first time. The end of the War also saw civil discontent and violence spread across Britain and her Empire. This account of the First World War is well known, but it does not tell the full story. It overlooks the many forgotten histories which exist of the conflict. This exhibition discussed one; the exile of the 250,000 Belgian refugees who fled to Britain.\n\nThis exhibition was organised by Kieran Taylor, a second year PhD student at the University of Stirling. His research examines the lives of Belgian refugees in Scotland during the Great War. His research is match funded by the University of Stirling and Glasgow Life.\n\n12 December 2018 - 31 August 2019\n\n'Unpacked: Home from Home' was a collaboration between the University Art Collection, artist Brigid Collins, women who fled Syria who are now settled in Falkirk and Stirling, and students of the Creative Writing MLitt at Stirling. Designed as a platform for storytelling, the inspiration for the installation piece, in this case, was the hope of unpacking individual stories of refugee experience and doing so in community.\n\nTogether, the group created a series of “Postcard Books” contained within one suitcase and which themselves each contain collages and text - pieces of thoughts and memories – which, while fragmentary in nature, proved nonetheless significant for having made one feel lighter by having become expressed. Each of the books holds individual meaning and those displayed here have been developed within a safe space in order to convey a collective story.\n\nThe Syrian participants used the opportunities for conversation and the writing aspects of the project to strengthen their English. Writing prompts and multimedia collage made space for creative reflection in community with other women in Scotland on the experience of being uprooted from home, the trauma of cultural and geographical dislocation, and the challenges and rewards of attempting to make a new home, here in the Forth Valley. Many stories of home-leaving and home-making together raise a city on stilts, a witness to both vulnerability and resilience.\n\n7 December 2018 to 31 March 2019\n\nThis exhibition was curated by third year students at the University of Stirling using the archives of the Musicians’ Union.\n\nIt is a journey through the campaigns and memorabilia of the decade which saw membership of the union reach 40,000. The exhibition illustrated the ways in which the Musicians’ Union sought to improve the lives and employment rights of performers. During this politically charged decade, members tackled anti-union legislation and spending cuts to music education thrown at them by the Conservative Government. They protested the mistreatment of performers during a series of orchestra strikes and raised awareness of racial discrimination in the UK and apartheid in South Africa. Images and archive material about the flagship campaign ‘Keep Music Live’ have been used to highlight the importance of live music when new technology threatened the job security of live bands and singers. Musicians’ Union members also used their talents to raise funds for famine relief by contributing to 1985’s Live Aid concert.\n\nThe Exhibition and Interpretation Design students who curated the exhibition said “Working on this exhibition has been both challenging and fun. As a design team we worked with several different members of the class to incorporate everyone’s aesthetic ideas. Designing this exhibition has been a wonderful opportunity to express our creativity and learn how to work as a team. Our design is inspired by the vibrant ‘80s and it is shown by the colours we have picked. We are excited to present this exhibition to the public and hopefully our hard work will show.”\n\nThe University Archivist, Karl Magee, noted \"we were delighted to open up the fantastic research resource which is the Musicians’ Union Archive to this student project. The exhibition they created brilliantly captures a particularly eventful decade for the Union and shows the huge potential of this collection for research, exhibition and promotion.\"\n\n18 March 2019\n\nAs part of the Experiences of Exile series of exhibitions and events, the Art Collection displayed an artwork Lampedusa created by artist Olivia Lomenech Gill. Lampedusa was created in 2008 and was inspired by the refugee crisis explored in Caroline Moorehead’s book Human Cargo (2006). This lecture discussed the refugee stories traced in the book, the inspiration and production of the artwork, and will consider what has and hasn't changed over the decade since.\n\nCaroline Moorehead is a bestselling author and acclaimed biographer who has also written for the Telegraph, the Times, and the Independent. She travelled for nearly two years and across four continents to research her book Human Cargo, which takes readers on a journey to understand why millions of people are forced to abandon their homes, possessions, and families in order to find a place where they may, quite literally, be allowed to live. The book, which was revised and updated in 2016, changes our understanding of what it means to have and lose a place in the world and reveals how the refugee \"problem\" is on a par with global crises such as terrorism and world hunger.\n\nOlivia Lomenech Gill lives and works in Northumberland. Initially studying Drama at Hull University, she went on to complete an MA Printmaking at Camberwell College of Arts in London. She is a painter, printer and illustrator who has exhibited widely and received many awards. Most recently she was the illustrator on the Illustrated Editions of J.K. Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.\n\n28 August 2019\n\nDay of Access is a collaborative project led by poet and artist Alec Finlay that uses the creative philosophy of place-awareness to offer disabled people access to beautiful landscapes across Scotland. The project creates new partnerships with public and private estates, parks, and heritage bodies (Historic Scotland, John Muir Trust, Paths for All) Promoting the healing effect of access, Alec's events bring together disabled participants, experienced local guides, and writers experienced in place-awareness, to offer innovative outdoor events and workshops for the disabled. In this talk Alec, will outlne the aims of Day of Access to promote the healing benefits of such activities.\n\nWorking with Alec on his pilot Day of Access in June 2019 was local student photographer Sam McDiarmid. Sam accompanied Alec and his group to Shiehallion, where he documented the event and he shared his images and his thoughts on the day during the talk.\n\nFollowing their talk, there was an optional walk in the University campus to explore and photograph Alec's Bee Books installation.\n\nAlec Finlay (Scotland, 1966-) is a poet & artist whose work crosses over a range of media and forms – poetry, visual poems, poem-objects, sculpture, collage, audio-visual, artist blog, and new technology. Much of Finlay's work considers how we as a culture, or cultures, relate to landscape and ecology, with a specific interest in place-awareness, hutopianism, rewilding, and the common right to care for the land. He is also known for his political and social activism. Since 2005 he has also produced a number of books and artworks that engage with renewable energy.\n\nFinlay established morning star publications in 1990. A retrospective of his publishing was held at The Poetry Centre, University of Tucson in 2018 He has published over forty books and won six Scottish Design Awards, including two Grand Prix Awards (2001, 2015). Recent publications include a far-off land (2018), gathering (2018), th' fleety wud (2017) minnmouth (2017), A Variety of Cultures (2016), ebban an’ flowan (2015), and Global Oracle (2014).\n\n1 December 2017 - 30 March 2018\n\nThis exhibition took its name from the long, sandy road linking Bechuanaland (now Botswana) to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), crossing South West Africa (now Namibia) and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) along the way. It was the road along which refugees travelled to escape from the South African oppression in the 1960s, often helped on their desperate journey by humanitarian organisations or mysterious foreign drivers.\n\nExclusively showing material from the Peter Mackay Archive for the first time, this exhibition told the story of Freedom Road – in the larger context of the African struggle for independence – through the words and photographs of one of those unnamed European “heroes”.\n\nPeter Mackay (1926-2013) was a key figure in the independence movements of Southern Africa. Born into a Scottish family with strong links to Stirling, Mackay served in the Scots Guards before emigrating to Rhodesia in 1948 where he devoted himself to the cause of African liberation. He then began to be involved in the African Independence movement in 1952 and was a great chronicler of this period of history until his death in 2013.\n\nThe Archive was donated to the University of Stirling in 2013 and the records within are a fascinating record of Mackay’s involvement in the independence movements of a number of Southern African countries, including Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) and Nyasaland (Malawi). The exhibition showcased photographs and papers from the archive illustrating these with Peter’s own words from his autobiography We Have Tomorrow: Stirrings in Africa 1959 – 1967.\n\nFreedom Road was curated by 3rd year students of the Interpretation and Exhibition Design Module run by the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and taught by the University’s curators and archivists.\n\nDeveloped in two sections, the exhibition continued in the Freedom Press space in the Archive glass cabinet, where a closer look at the man and his activism is explored.\n\n4 September - 15 December 2017\n\nAlly Wallace worked as Artist in Residence at the University of Stirling’s Pathfoot Building 2016-2017 on a self-initiated project funded by Creative Scotland. He made work focused on Pathfoot’s modernist architecture in relation to the art collection housed in it, the surrounding landscape and the people who use the building.\n\nA note from the artist\n\nArchitecture is a common theme in my work and it was through my ongoing interest in modernist buildings that I came to University of Stirling to make artwork that focuses on the Category A listed Pathfoot Building - to take a close look at its design and function in relation to the surrounding landscape and the Art Collection housed here.\n\nWith support from Creative Scotland's Open Project Fund and the University's Art Collection Department, I undertook a 6-month artist's residency at Pathfoot in 2016/17, during which time I spent two days a week here - making artwork that is inspired by the modernist design of the building and its picturesque location. Much of my time was spent sketching and videoing in and around the building, as well as talking to people who work here, to gain an overall understanding of the place - how it functions and how people feel about it as a place to work, study or visit. The artwork that I produced during the residency is exhibited here in the gallery and deals with various elements of Pathfoot - its architecture, people, furniture, landscaping and art.\n\nDesigned by architects RMJM (Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall) and completed in 1967, Pathfoot was the first building to be constructed on the campus of the newly established University of Stirling - one of the new 'Plate Glass' universities built throughout the UK in the modernist style during the 1960's. The building comprises a series of corridors and courtyards, arranged in stepped formation on a hillside location. Light, airy open spaces offer views of the courtyards and surrounding parkland. Temporary exhibitions and artworks from the permanent collection are shown throughout the building, creating a very stimulating teaching and learning environment.\n\nI hope that my work will convey something about how Pathfoot's architecture relates to the surrounding landscape and the Art Collection housed throughout the building and how those elements combine to create a pleasant environment to spend time in.\n\nFind more about the residency at the artist's blog: allywallacedotorg.wordpress.com\n\nand for more on Ally's work see his website: www.allywallace.co.uk\n\nReflections of the East was the umbrella title for exhibitions, a related lecture and other events, focussed around work by artists Kate Downie, Emma Scott-Smith and Fanny Lam Christie, all three of whom live in Scotland and have a creative link with China.\n\nAlso on display was work drawn from the Norman McLaren archive, focussing on his visit to China in 1949, and a picture which has been specially loaned by the Chinese artist Ding Fang.\n\nKate Downie's work has now transferred to Aberdeen (Robert Gordon's). You can still see work by Emma Scott-Smith, Fanny Lam Christie and Ding Fang on display in the Pathfoot Building.\n\nShared Vision: A solo show of ink paintings, prints and drawings by Kate Downie\n\nIt is exactly 5 years since the artist set foot in China for the first time, as recipient of a William Gillies Scholarship award from the Royal Scottish Academy. She has since returned there three times and to mark her continuing relationship with that country she presents her solo exhibition ‘Shared Vision’ which brings together a body of work relating to cultural absolutes in China and examines the role of ink painting in defining or mythologizing that culture in the 21st Century and its influences in the West.\n\nAquacultural Encounters: New work by Fanny Lam Christie\n\nOriginally from Hong Kong, Fanny Lam Christie has lived in Scotland since 1998. This exhibition of new work is the culmination of a year-long artist residency undertaken at the University of Stirling’s Institute of Aquaculture in 2014/2015. She says 'my project aims to offer viewers a new perspective on scientific innovation through a personal creative language. Inspired by scientific experiments, I have ventured into new experimental work, learning and developing unconventional process with materials for sculpture, combining different materials which I do not normally use together. The project has paved a new way of looking and working for me.'\n\nEmma Scott Smith: Everything that is and has been\n\nThis exhibition was developed from three points in time. Firstly, some work for group and solo exhibitions in China, secondly Eastern artist’s reflections of the exhibited work and thirdly, my position and exploration of colour, passion and identity within Eastern and Western Culture as a result of the visits to China. An abundance of colour, passion and representation of the visual image is important to all of us, as a society. The very limited graffiti and the non-disclosing of tattoos highlights different representations of self and expression in China.\n\nNorman McLaren:Travels in China 1949\n\nBorn in Stirling in 1914, Norman McLaren studied set design at the Glasgow School of Art and, after working in London and New York, he moved to Canada in 1941. Here he began working for the National Film Board and also set up an animation studio. McLaren developed a variety of groundbreaking experimental animation techniques including developing a form of ‘camera-less animation’ by directly drawing onto film. His genius was recognised worldwide with a string of awards for his work including an Oscar for his short film Neighbours in 1953. While film was McLaren’s favourite medium he also produced paintings, pastels and screenprints in parallel with his film work. The University of Stirling holds the Norman McLaren archive (and several of his works are on permanent display in Pathfoot J corridor).\n\nIn 1949 McLaren went to China for UNESCO to teach audiovisual methods to Chinese artists and witnessed the revolutionary change to a communist regime. Materials in the form of letters and sketches from his time in China form part of the University archive and some of these will be on display in Gallery 2 of the Pathfoot Building as part of this exhibition which ran until 23rd December 2015.\n\nDing Fang\n\nBorn in 1956, in Wugong, Shanxi Province, Ding Fang is a well-known Chinese painter and curator.
