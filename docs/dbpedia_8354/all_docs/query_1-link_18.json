        "text": "Tall, spade-jawed, hopelessly genial balladeer/actor Jim Nabors was born in James Thurston Nabors on June 12, 1930 in Sylacauga, Alabama and raised there, graduating from the University of Alabama. A typing clerk at the United Nations in his salad days, he eventually moved to Los Angeles, California on account of his asthmatic condition and became a film cutter for NBC.\n\nJim was discovered on stage doing a cabaret act at \"The Horn,\" a now defunct but then highly popular Santa Monica nightclub. Combining his gifts for classical singing and gawky hick characterizations, his highly unique schtick was either ridiculously insane or totally brilliant. Either way this garnered him notice.\n\nComic Bill Dana caught Jim's act and opted for the latter assessment, inviting him to audition for Steve Allen's TV variety show. Jim went on to appear on Allen's show a number of times. TV star Andy Griffith caught his silly singing \"down home\" gimmick as well and offered him the part of dim but lovable gas station attendant Gomer Pyle on his popular 1960s sitcom. Jim's career took off like a skyrocket. His sheepish \"gawwwleee\" and bug-eyed \"shazzayam\" expressions became part of the American vernacular and it wasn't long before the beloved character would spin off into his own sitcom. Gomer Pyle: USMC (1964) was a solid hit as the bungling, painfully naive, gentle do-gooder found himself hilariously at odds with the Marine Corps and a particularly tough Sergeant Vince Carter (played terrifically by the late Frank Sutton). The sitcom ran a respectable five seasons and Jim solidified himself as a household name.\n\nOn the downside of this TV success, Jim found himself inextricably pigeon-holed as a gullible, squeaky-clean hick. As a result, he found work elsewhere, particularly in children-oriented series for Sid and Marty Krofft and Jim Henson. He also decided to refocus on his beautiful baritone voice. Recording a number of romantic, easy listening albums, five of them went gold and one went platinum. He earned a gold record for his rendition of \"The Lord's Prayer.\"\n\nOn TV, Jim became a frequent singing/comedy guest performer on all the top prime-time variety and late night shows, including \"Sonny & Cher,\" \"The Tonight Show,\" \"The Dean Martin Show,\" \"The David Frost Show,\" and \"The Joey Bishop Show.\" He also became the annual \"good luck charm\" opening season guest on close friend Carol Burnett's TV variety series during her twelve-year run. It was enough for CBS to entrust Jim with own TV variety series The Jim Nabors Hour (1968), which ran for two seasons, featured his \"Gomer Pyle\" co-stars Frank Sutton and Ronnie Schell, and earned him a Golden Globe nomination. A decade later, he returned to the format hosting The Jim Nabors Show (1978), which was short-lived but earned him a daytime Emmy nomination.\n\nAnother good friend, Burt Reynolds, was responsible for Jim's theater debut as Harold Hill in \"The Music Man\" at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre with Florence Henderson as his Marian the Librarian. Jim also appeared in comic support in a couple of Reynolds' films -- Das sch√∂nste Freudenhaus in Texas (1982) and Der rasende Gockel (1983).\n\nNabors was seen on a limited basis in the early 1990s and his life took a serious hit in 1994 when, after years of declining health, he was forced to have a liver transplant. He has returned to the limelight very infrequently (talks shows and reunion shows), preferring the quiet, relaxing life he has in Hawaii and running a macadamia nut plantation.\n\nOn January 15, 2013, the 82-year-old Nabors came out as gay news by marrying his life partner of 38 years, Stan Cadwallader, a retired Honolulu firefighter, at a Seattle hotel after Washington became a \"same sex\" marriage state a month earlier. The 87-year-old died of an immune disorder on November 30, 2017.\n\nImogene Coca is best remembered for playing opposite Sid Caesar in the live 90-minute Your Show of Shows (1950), which ran every Saturday night in regular season on NBC from February 1950 to June 1954. Their repertoire of comedy acts included the very memorable, hilarious, timeless and irreconcilable married couple Charlie and Doris Hickenlooper. Coca, however, did not begin her career in comedy. Her father, who was the conductor at a small Philadelphia opera house, and her mother, who performed in vaudeville, certainly instilled in her a desire to perform, but nurtured that desire with piano lessons, vocal training and dance. \"I began as one of those horrible little children who sing with no voice,\" Coca said of her early training. By the time she was 13, she found herself tap dancing, somersaulting (along with various other acrobatics), dancing ballet and otherwise committed full-time as a serious vaudeville trouper. She left Philadelphia at 15 for New York, where she plied her trade as a dancer. She debuted in the chorus of \"When You Smile.\" For the next 30 years music and dance were her staple. She could be found in the troupes of musical revues and doing her own acts in Manhattan clubs, such as the Rainbow Room, the Silver Slipper and Cafe Society Uptown. Her first husband, Robert Burton (who died in 1955), arranged music for many of her performances. Comedy and pantomime filtered into her routines quite by accident. In the production of \"New Faces of 1934\" Leonard Sillman, the choreographer for the show, loaned her his coat to keep her warm in what was a very cold theater. To augment what warmth she was getting from the oversized coat, Coca, along with three male dancers in the chorus began jumping up and down and improvising dance steps. Stillman noticed them and immediately recognized the comedic affect. He encouraged them to repeat the routine in the show, coat and all, which they did. Although coolly received by the audience at first, eventually the bit had the audience in stitches. Even the critics laughed, crediting Coca with great comedic talent. To hone her skills in what would become her forte in show business, Coca did the next four summers in the Poconos working with Danny Kaye, Carol Channing and the like.\n\nIt wasn't until near the end of WWII that she found much work in her new field and it wasn't until January 1949 that she was paired with Caesar in NBC's The Admiral Broadway Revue (1949), a show that aired only until that summer. In the fall of 1950 \"Your Show of Shows\" was launched on NBC. Coca won an Emmy the following year for her contributions to the program. She and Ceasar left the show in 1954 to pursue individual routes. They did not, however, match the success they enjoyed in \"Your Show of Shows.\" Coca attempted a solo with The Imogene Coca Show (1954), but it lasted only one season. In 1958 Caesar and she paired again on Sid Caesar Invites You (1958); still, it was not the same. Only in 1967 did some of that same magic again occur when the original cast from \"Your Show of Shows\" reunited on CBS in _The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special (1967) (TV)_; it won an Emmy for outstanding variety special.\n\nCoca starred in two single-season sitcoms in the 1960s: NBC's 1963-64 Grindl (1963) and CBS' 1966-67 It's About Time (1966). In the 1970s she could be found visiting on Dick Cavett's talk show and making guest appearances on The Carol Burnett Show (1967). Thereafter, she appeared only sporadically on TV and in the movies--her most notable appearance was as Aunt Edna in Die schrillen Vier auf Achse (1983) with Chevy Chase. Coca and Caesar re-visited some of their old sketches and put together the 1991 show \"Together Again\", which they toured throughout the country on stage. In her later years Coca and her second husband, actor King Donovan (who died in 1987), lived in Connecticut and Manhattan, staying close to her roots in vaudeville, theatre and \"Your Show of Shows.\"\n\nDiller put out an autobiography in 2005 in her late 80s, and entitled it \"Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse\", which pretty much says it all when recalling the misfit life and career of the fabulous, one-of-a-kind Phyllis Diller. It may inspire all those bored, discouraged and/or directionless housewives out there to know that the one-time 37-year-old chief bottle washer and diaper disposer of five started out writing comedy routines for her fellow female laundry mates as a sort of reprieve from what she considered her everyday household doldrums. Little did she know she would wind up an entertainment legend who would share the biggest comedy stages with the likes of Bob Hope, George Burns and Jack Benny.\n\nThey said it couldn't be done back then (to be a successful lady comic, that is) but the doyenne of female stand-up did just that -- opened the doors for other odd-duck funny girls who dared to intrude on what was considered a man's profession. Initially, the comedienne whipped up an alter-ego that could have only been created with the aid of hallucinogens. Boldly facing the world as a scrawny, witchy-faced, flyaway haired, outlandishly costumed, cigarette-holding, magpie-cackling version of \"Auntie Mame\", Diller made a virtue out of her weird looks and cashed in on her wifely horror tales and her own idiosyncratic tendencies. Her solid fan base has been thriving now for over five decades.\n\nShe was born Phyllis Ada Driver on July 17, 1917 in Lima, Ohio to Perry Marcus and Frances Ada (Romshe) Driver. A student at Lima's Central High School, she went on to study for three years at the Sherwood Music Conservatory in Chicago, before transferring to Bluffton (Ohio) College where she served as the editor of the school's more humorous newspaper articles. She was a serious student of the piano but was never completely confident enough in her performance level to try and act on it as a possible career.\n\nShe wed Sherwood Anderson Diller at age 22 in November 1939 and had six children (one of whom died in infancy). On the sly, she was an advertising copywriter. During World War II, the family moved to Michigan where her husband had found work at the Willow Run Bomber Plant. A natural laugh-getter, she began writing household-related one-liners and the feedback from the fellow wives greatly encouraged her. When the family moved to California for job-related reasons, Diller became a secretary at a San Francisco television station. By this time, she had built up the courage to put together a nightclub act.\n\nThe local television hosts at the station (Willard Anderson and Don Sherwood) thought her act was hilarious and invited her on their show in 1955. Not long after, at age 38, Diller made her debut at San Francisco's Purple Onion nightclub. What was to be a two-week engagement was stretched out to more than a year and a half. The widespread publicity she received took her straight to the television talk and variety circuits where she was soon trading banter with Jack Paar, Jack Benny and Red Skelton, among others, on their popular television series. She was a contestant on Groucho Marx's popular quiz show You Bet Your Life (1950).\n\nThroughout the 1960s, audiences embraced her bold and brazen quirkiness. Diller formed a tight and lasting relationship with Bob Hope, appearing in scores of his television specials and co-starring in three of his broad 1960s comedy films (V√∂llig falsch verbunden! (1966), Acht gehen t√ºrmen (1967) and Wo bitte gibt's Bier an der Front? (1968). Diller joined Hope in Vietnam in 1966 with his USO troupe.\n\nHer celebrity eventually took its toll on her marriage. She separated from and eventually divorced Sherwood in 1965, who had, by this time, become a favorite topic and target of her act in the form of husband \"Fang\". That same year, she married singer, film actor and television host Warde Donovan who appeared with her in the slapstick movie Did You Hear the One About the Traveling Saleslady? (1968). They divorced in 1975.\n\nBy this time, Diller was everywhere on the small screen. A special guest on hordes of television series and comedy specials and, especially on such riotfests as Laugh-In (1977) and the Dean Martin celebrity series of roasts, she became a celebrity on the game show circuit as well, milking laughs on such established shows as The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965) and The Gong Show (1976). She published best-selling comedy records to her credit and humorous anecdotes to pitch that made it to the bookstore shelves, such as \"Phyllis Diller Tells All About Fang\". However, stand-up remained her first love.\n\nHer forays on television in her own series were, regretfully, unsuccessful. Her first television series, The Pruitts of Southampton (1966), had her pretty much pulling out all the stops as a wacky widow invariably scheming to keep up a wealthy front despite being heavily in debt. She had the reliably droll Reginald Gardiner and cranky Charles Lane as foils and even Gypsy Rose Lee, but to little avail. Revamped as \"The Phyllis Diller Show\", several of comedy's best second bananas (John Astin, Paul Lynde, Richard Deacon, Billy De Wolfe, Marty Ingels) were added to the mix, but the show was canceled after a single season. A second try with The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show (1968), a comedy/variety show that had the zany star backed by none other than Rip Taylor and Norm Crosby, lasted only three months.\n\nSeldom did she manage or receive offers to take her funny face off long enough to appear for dramatic effect. Somewhat more straightforward roles came later on episodes of Boston Legal (2004) and Eine himmlische Familie (1996). Back in 1961, interestingly enough, she made both her stage and film debuts in the dramas of William Inge. Her theatrical debut came with a production of \"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs\" and she appeared first on film in the highly dramatic Fieber im Blut (1961), lightening things up a bit with a cameo appearance as larger-than-life nightclub hostess Texas Guinan. Diller later impressed with her harridan role in the film The Adding Machine (1969) opposite Milo O'Shea.\n\nDiller enjoyed a three-month run on Broadway in \"Hello, Dolly!\", co-starring Richard Deacon and appeared in other shows and musicals over time: \"Wonderful Town\" (she met her second husband Warde Donovan in this production), \"Happy Birthday\", \"Everybody Loves Opal\" and \"Nunsense\". In 1993, Diller was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. Her cackling vocals have enhanced animated features, too, what with Frankensteins Monster-Party (1967) and Das gro√üe Krabbeln (1998). It took a heart attack in 1999 to finally slow down the comedienne and she eventually announced her retirement in 2002.\n\nAside from the baby who died in infancy, Diller was also predeceased by her eldest son, Peter (who died of cancer in 1998) and her daughter, Stephanie Diller (who died of a stroke in 2002). Her surviving children are Sally Diller, Suzanne Sue Diller and Perry Diller. As late as January 2007, she made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992). She was set to return on her 90th birthday in July but a back injury forced her to cancel. She died at age 95 of heart failure on August 20, 2012 in her home in Brentwood, California.\n\nOne of television's premier African-American series stars, elegant actress, singer and recording artist Diahann Carroll was born Carol Diann (or Diahann) Johnson on July 17, 1935, in the Bronx, New York. The first child of John Johnson, a subway conductor, and Mabel Faulk Johnson, a nurse; music was an important part of her life as a child, singing at age six with her Harlem church choir. While taking voice and piano lessons, she contemplated an operatic career after becoming the 10-year-old recipient of a Metropolitan Opera scholarship for studies at New York's High School of Music and Art. As a teenager she sought modeling work but it was her voice, in addition to her beauty, that provided the magic and the allure.\n\nWhen she was 16, she teamed up with a girlfriend from school and auditioned for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts show using the more exotic sounding name of Diahann Carroll. She alone was invited to appear and won the contest. She subsequently performed on the daily radio show for three weeks. In her late teens, she began focusing on a nightclub career and it was here that she began formulating a chic, glamorous image. Another TV talent show appearance earned her a week's engagement at the Latin Quarter.\n\nBroadway roles for black singers were rare but at age nineteen, Diahann was cast in the Harold Arlen/Truman Capote musical \"House of Flowers\". Starring the indomitable Pearl Bailey, Diahann held her own quite nicely in the ing√©nue role. While the show itself was poorly received, the score was heralded and Diahann managed to introduce two song standards, \"A Sleepin' Bee\" and \"I Never Has Seen Snow\", both later recorded by Barbra Streisand.\n\nIn 1954 she and Ms. Bailey supported a riveting Dorothy Dandridge as femme fatale Carmen Jones (1954) in an all-black, updated movie version of the Georges Bizet opera \"Carmen.\" Diahann later supported Ms. Dandridge again in Otto Preminger's cinematic retelling of Porgy und Bess (1959). During this time she also grew into a singing personality on TV while visiting such late-nite hosts as Jack Paar and Steve Allen and performing.\n\nUnable to break through into the top ranks in film (she appeared in a secondary role once again in Paris Blues (1961), a Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward vehicle), Diahann returned to Broadway. She was rewarded with a Tony Award for her exceptional performance as a fashion model in the 1962 musical \"No Strings,\" a bold, interracial love story that co-starred Richard Kiley. Richard Rodgers, whose first musical this was after the death of partner Oscar Hammerstein, wrote the part specifically for Diahann, which included her lovely rendition of the song standard \"The Sweetest Sounds.\" By this time she had already begun to record albums (\"Diahann Carroll Sings Harold Arlen\" (1957), \"Diahann Carroll and Andre Previn\" (1960), \"The Fabulous Diahann Carroll\" (1962). Nightclub entertaining filled up a bulk of her time during the early-to-mid 1960s, along with TV guest appearances on Carol Burnett, Judy Garland, Andy Williams, Dean Martin and Danny Kaye's musical variety shows.\n\nLittle did Diahann know that in the late 1960s she would break a major ethnic barrier on the small screen. Though it was nearly impossible to suppress the natural glamour and sophistication of Diahann, she touchingly portrayed an ordinary nurse and widow struggling to raise a small son in the series Julia (1968). Despite other Black American actresses starring in a TV series (i.e., Hattie McDaniel in \"Beulah\"), Diahann became the first full-fledged African-American female \"star\" -- top billed, in which the show centered around her lead character. The show gradually rose in ratings and Diahann won a Golden Globe award for \"Best Newcomer\" and an Emmy nomination. The show lasted only two seasons, at her request.\n\nA renewed interest in film led Diahann to the dressed-down title role of Claudine (1974), as a Harlem woman raising six children on her own. She was nominated for an Oscar in 1975, but her acting career would become more and more erratic after this period. She did return, however, to the stage with productions of \"Same Time, Next Year\" and \"Agnes of God\". While much ado was made about her return to series work as a fashionplate nemesis to Joan Collins' ultra-vixen character on the glitzy primetime soap Der Denver-Clan (1981), it became much about nothing as the juicy pairing failed to ignite. Diahann's character was also a part of the short-lived \"Dynasty\" spin-off Die Colbys - Das Imperium (1985).\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 90s she toured with her fourth husband, singer Vic Damone, with occasional acting appearances to fill in the gaps. Some of her finest work came with TV-movies, notably her century-old Sadie Delany in Essig und Melasse - Das schwarze Amerika erwacht (1999) and as troubled singer Natalie Cole's mother in Livin' for Love: The Natalie Cole Story (2000). She also portrayed silent screen diva Norma Desmond in the musical version of \"Sunset Blvd.\" and toured America performing classic Broadway standards in the concert show \"Almost Like Being in Love: The Lerner and Loewe Songbook.\" She then had recurring roles on Grey's Anatomy: Die jungen √Ñrzte (2005) and White Collar (2009).\n\nDiahann Carroll died on October 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nA sparkling, entertaining, highly energetic presence ever since her early days (from age 4) as a singing and tap dancing child vaudevillian, Nanette Fabray was once billed as \"Baby Nanette\".\n\nShe was born in Sherbrooke, Qu√©bec, Canada, then moved to the United States, to Louisiana-born parents, Lily Agnes (McGovern) and Raoul Bernard Fabares, a train conductor whose own father was from France. She worked with the top headliners of the era, notably Ben Turpin, in the Los Angeles area. She also sang on radio. It was widely rumored that she appeared in the \"Our Gang\" (\"Little Rascal\") film shorts of the late 1920s; however, this was not true. Later the young hopeful received a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of the Theatre and appeared in the school's productions of \"The Miracle\", \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" and \"A Servant with Two Masters\", all in 1939.\n\nThe musical comedy stage, however, would be Nanette's forte. Appearing in such hit New York productions as \"Meet the People\" (1940), \"Let's Face It\" (1941), \"By Jupiter\" (1943) and \"Bloomer Girl\" (1945), she capped this period of great productivity earning awards for her Broadway work in \"High Button Shoes\" (1947 - Donaldson Award), and \"Love Life\" (1948 - Tony and Donaldson Awards).\n\nStrangely, Nanette never obtained a strong foothold when it came to film. Aside from secondary roles in G√ºnstling einer K√∂nigin (1939) starring Bette Davis and Errol Flynn, and the melodrama A Child Is Born (1939), her one claim to movie fame would be her vital participation in the blockbuster MGM musical Vorhang auf! (1953) in which she memorably performed the songs \"That's Entertainment\" and \"Louisiana Hayride,\" and joined Fred Astaire and Jack Buchanan in the standout \"Triplets\" number.\n\nInto the 1950s, Nanette started checking out what television could do as a possible medium for her. It did a lot. She managed a fine feat by winning two consecutive Emmy awards as Sid Caesar's partner on the now-called Caesar's Hour (1954) following the departure of the seemingly irreplaceable Imogene Coca earlier. This led to Nanette eventually starring in her own sitcom, the short-lived Westinghouse Playhouse (1961) (aka \"Yes, Yes, Nanette\"), in the role of a Broadway star who becomes a makeshift mom after marrying a widower (Wendell Corey) with two children.\n\nBroadway musicals continued to flourish with parts in \"Arms and the Girl\" (1950) and \"Make a Wish\" (1951). Nanette later copped another Tony nomination starring as a fictional \"First Lady\" opposition \"President\" Robert Ryan in the musical \"Mr. President\" (1962). Other tailor-made stage vehicles for her came in the form of \"Plaza Suite\", \"Wonderful Town\", \"Never Too Late\", \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers\" and \"Cactus Flower\", among others.\n\nOn the TV front, Nanette adjusted well into a lively and graceful support player. She served up a number of delightfully daffy moms, wisecracking friends and intrusive relatives in guest appearances -- sometimes alongside her own niece, actress Shelley Fabares, as was in the case of their regular roles on One Day at a Time (1975). Nanette was also a popular game show personality during the '60s and '70s, appearing on The Hollywood Squares (Daytime) (1965), High Rollers (1974), Password (1961) and The Match Game (1962), among others. The singer-comedienne could be counted on for TV musical variety appearances courtesy of headliners Dinah Shore, Andy Williams, Dean Martin and Carol Burnett.\n\nMost importantly, Nanette's humanitarian efforts over the years were long recognized. A positive force as a hearing-impaired performer, she gave much time and effort in achieving equality for all types of handicapped and disabled people, including actors. Nanette was the widow (since 1973) of writer and sometime director/producer Ranald MacDougall, appearing in a few of his credited works, including the film Eine Frau f√ºr Charley (1970), the TV pilot Fame Is the Name of the Game (1966) and the TV-movie Magic Carpet (1972). She and MacDougall have one child. Still as lively as ever, Nanette appeared in a 2007 L.A. musical revue, \"The Damsel Dialogues\".\n\nNanette died on February 22, 2018, in Palos Verdes, California. She was 97.\n\nThe beat goes on ... and on ... and as strong as ever for this superstar entertainer who has well surpassed the half-century mark while improbably transforming herself from an artificial, glossy \"flashionplate\" singer into a serious, Oscar-worthy, dramatic actress ... and back again! With more ups and downs than the 2008 Dow Jones Industrial Average, Cher managed to rise like a phoenix from the ashes each time she was down, somehow re-inventing herself with every decade and finding herself on top all over again. As a singer Cher is the only performer to have earned \"top 10\" hit singles in four consecutive decades; as an actress, she and Barbra Streisand are the only two Best Actress Oscar winners to have a #1 hit song on the Billboard charts. At age 77, Cher has yet to decide to get completely off her fabulous roller coaster ride, although she has threatened to on occasion.\n\nThe daughter of Arkansas-born Georgia Holt (the former Jackie Jean Crouch) and truck driver John Sarkisian, Cher was born in El Centro, California, on May 20, 1946. She has a half-sister, Georganne LaPiere. Cher is of Armenian heritage on her father's side, and of English and German, with more distant Irish, Dutch, and French, heritage on her mother's side. Cher's parents divorced when she was an infant and her mother went on to marry six more times. Her mother, who aspired to be an actress and model, paid for Cher's acting classes. Cher had undiagnosed dyslexia, which acutely affected her studies; frustrated, she quit high school at 16 to pursue her dream. At that time, she had a brief relationship with actor Warren Beatty.\n\nMeeting the quite older (by 11 years) Sonny Bono in November 1962 changed the 16-year-old's life forever. Bono was working for record producer Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood at the time and managed to persuade Spector to hire Cher as a session singer. As such, she went on to record backup on such Spector classics as \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\" and \"Be My Baby\". The couple's relationship eventually shifted from soulmates to lovers and she and Sonny married on October 27, 1964.\n\nAt first Cher sang solo with Sonny behind the scenes writing, arranging and producing her songs. When the records went nowhere, Sonny decided they needed to perform as a team so they put out two songs in 1964 under the recording names of Caesar and Cleo (\"The Letter\" and \"Baby Don't Go\"). Again, no success. The changing of their names, however, made a difference and in 1965, they officially took on the music world as Sonny & Cher and earned instant rewards.\n\nThe now 19-year-old Cher and 30-year-old Sonny became huge hits following the release of their first album, \"Look at Us\" (summer, 1965), which contained the hit single \"I Got You Babe\". With the song catapulting to #1, they decided to re-release their earlier single \"Baby Don't Go\", and it also raced up the charts to #8. An assembly line of mild hits dotted the airwaves over the next year or two, culminating in the huge smash hit \"The Beat Goes On\" (#6, 1967). Between 1965 and 1972 Sonny & Cher charted a total of six \"Top 10\" hits.\n\nThe kooky couple became icons of the mid-'60s \"flower power\" scene, wearing garish garb and outlandish hairdos and makeup. However, they found a way to make it trendy and were embraced around the world. TV musical variety and teen pop showcases relished their contrasting styles -- the short, excitable, mustachioed, nasal-toned simpleton and the taller, exotic, unflappable fashion maven. They found a successful formula with their repartee, which became a central factor in their live concert shows, even more than their singing. With all this going on, Sonny still endeavored to promote Cher as a solo success. Other than such hits with \"All I Really Want to Do\" (#16) and \"Bang, Bang\" (#2), she struggled to find a separate identity. Sonny even arranged film projects for her but Good Times (1967), an offbeat fantasy starring the couple and directed by future powerhouse William Friedkin, and Cher's serious solo effort Chastity (1969) both flickered out and died a quick death.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, Sonny & Cher's career had stumbled as they witnessed the American pop culture experience a drastic evolutionary change. The couple maintained their stage act and all the while Sonny continued to polish it up in a shrewd gamble for TV acceptance. While Sonny on stage played the ineffectual object of Cher's stinging barbs on stage, he was actually the highly motivated mastermind off stage and, amazingly enough, his foresight and chutzpah really paid off. Although the couple had lost favor with the new 70s generation, Sonny encouraged TV talent scouts to catch their live act.\n\nThe network powers-that-be saw potential in the duo as they made a number of guest TV appearances in specials and on variety and talk shows and in what was essentially \"auditioning\" for their own TV vehicle. The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour (1971) was given the green light as a summer replacement series and was an instant sensation when it earned its own time spot that fall season. The show received numerous Emmy Award nominations during its run and the couple became stars all over again. Their lively, off-the-wall comedy sketch routines, her outr√© Bob Mackie fashions and their harmless, edgy banter were the highlights of the hour-long program. Audiences took strongly to the couple who appeared to have a deep-down sturdy relationship. Their daughter Chaz Bono occasionally added to the couple's loving glow on the show. Cher's TV success also generated renewed interest in her as a solo recording artist and she came up with three #1 hits during this time (\"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves,\" \"Half-Breed\" and \"Dark Lady\").\n\nBehind the scenes, though, it was a different story. A now-confident Cher yearned to be free of husband Sonny's Svengali-like control over her life and career. The marriage split at the seams in 1974 and they publicly announced their separation. The show, which had earned Cher a Golden Globe Award, took a fast tumble as the separation and divorce grew more acrimonious. Eventually they both tried to launch their own solo variety shows, but both failed to even come close to their success as a duo. Audiences weren't interested in Cher without Sonny, and vice versa.\n\nIn late June of 1975, only four days after the couple's divorce, Cher married rock musician Gregg Allman of The Allman Brothers Band. That marriage imploded rather quickly amid reports of out-of-control drug use on his part. They were divorced by 1979 with only one bright outcome -- son Elijah Allman.\n\nIn 1976 Sonny and Cher attempted to \"make up\" again, this time to the tune of a second The Sonny and Cher Show (1976). Audiences, however, did not accept the \"friendly\" divorced couple after so much tabloid nastiness. After the initial curiosity factor wore off, the show was canceled amid poor ratings. Moreover, the musical variety show format was on its way out as well. Once again, another decade was looking to end badly for Cher.\n\nCher found a mild success with the \"top 10\" disco hit \"Take Me Home\" in 1979, but not much else. Not one to be counted out, however, the ever resourceful singer decided to lay back and focus on acting instead. At age 36, Cher made her Broadway debut in 1982 in what was essentially her first live acting role with \"Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean\". Centering around a reunion of girlfriends from an old James Dean fan club, her performance was critically lauded. This earned her the right to transfer her stage triumph to film alongside Karen Black and Sandy Dennis. Cher earned critical raves for Komm' zur√ºck, Jimmy Dean (1982), her first film role since 1969.\n\nWith film #2 came a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe win for her portrayal of a lesbian toiling in a nuclear parts factory in Silkwood (1983), starring Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell. This in turn was followed by her star turn in Die Maske (1985) as the blunt, footloose mother of a son afflicted with a rare disease (played beautifully by Eric Stoltz). Once again Cher received high praise and copped a win from the Cannes Film Festival for her poignant performance.\n\nFully accepted by this time as an actress of high-caliber, she integrated well into the Hollywood community. Proving that she could hold up a film outright, she was handed three hit vehicles to star in: Die Hexen von Eastwick (1987), Suspect - Unter Verdacht (1987), and Monds√ºchtig (1987), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Along with all this newfound Hollywood celebrity came interest in her as a singer and recording artist again. \"If I Could Turn Back Time (#3) and the Peter Cetera duet \"After All\" (#6) placed her back on the Billboard charts.\n\nDuring the 1990s Cher continued to veer back and forth among films, TV specials and expensively mounted concerts. In January of 1998, tragedy struck when Cher's ex-husband Sonny Bono, who had forsaken an entertainment career for California politics and became a popular Republican congressman in the process, was killed in a freak skiing accident. That same year the duo received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contribution to television. In the meantime an astounding career adrenaline rush came in the form of a monstrous, disco-flavored hit single (\"Believe\"). The song became a #1 hit and the same-titled album the biggest hit of her career. \"Believe\" reached #1 in 23 different countries.\n\nHaving little to prove anymore to anyone, Cher decided to embark on a \"Farewell Tour\" in the early part of the millennium and, after much stretching, her show finally closed in 2005 in Los Angeles. It didn't take long, however, for Cher to return from this self-imposed exile. In 2008, she finalized a deal with Las Vegas' Caesars Palace for the next three years to play the Colosseum, and has since returned live on numerous \"farewell\" tour extravaganzas. Never say never. Cher returned films with her co-starring role opposite Christina Aguilera in Burlesque (2010), but has since only provided a glitzy cameo in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again! (2018). After keeping a low romantic profile for some time, she nearly out-cougared Madonna by embarking on a romance with four-decades-younger Def Jam executive Alexander \"A.E.\" Edwards, father of rapper Amber Rose's second son. The couple celebrated their one-year anniversary in 2023, right before the release of Cher's first holiday album, simply titled Christmas.\n\nIn other facets of her life, Cher has been involved with many humanitarian groups and charity efforts over the years, particularly her work as National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson of the Children's Craniofacial Association, which was inspired by her work in Die Maske (1985).\n\nRichard Chamberlain became the leading heartthrob of early 1960s television. As the impeccably handsome Dr. James Kildare, the slim, butter-haired hunk with the near-perfect Ivy-League charm and smooth, intelligent demeanor, had the distaff fans fawning unwavering over him through the series' run. While this would appear to be a dream situation for any new star, to Chamberlain it brought about a major, unsettling identity crisis.\n\nBorn George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, he was the second son of Elsa Winnifred (von Benzon) (1902-1993) and Charles Axiom Chamberlain (1902-1984), a salesman. He has English and German ancestry. Richard experienced a profoundly unhappy childhood and did not enjoy school at all, making up for it somewhat by excelling in track and becoming a four-year letter man in high school and college. He also developed a strong interest and enjoyment in acting while attending Pomona College. Losing an initial chance to sign up with Paramount Pictures, the studio later renewed interest. Complications arose when he was drafted into the Unites States Army on December 7, 1956 for 16 months, serving in Korea.\n\nChamberlain headed for Hollywood soon after his discharge and, in just a couple of years, worked up a decent resum√© with a number of visible guest spots on such popular series as Rauchende Colts (1955) and Mr. Lucky (1959). But it was the stardom of the medical series Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961) that garnered overnight female worship and he became a huge sweater-vested pin-up favorite. It also sparked a brief, modest singing career for the actor.\n\nThe attention Richard received was phenomenal. True to his \"Prince Charming\" type, he advanced into typically bland, soap-styled leads on film befitting said image, but crossover stardom proved to be elusive. The vehicles he appeared in, Rufmord (1963) with Joey Heatherton and Joy in the Morning (1965) opposite Yvette Mimieux, did not bring him the screen fame foreseen. The public obviously saw the actor as nothing more than a television commodity.\n\nMore interested in a reputation as a serious actor, Chamberlain took a huge risk and turned his back on Hollywood, devoting himself to the stage. In 1966 alone, he appeared in such legit productions as \"The Philadelphia Story\" and \"Private Lives\", and also showed off his vocal talents playing Tony in \"West Side Story\". In December of that year, a musical version of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" starring Richard and Mary Tyler Moore in the sparkling George Peppard/Audrey Hepburn roles was headed for Broadway. However, it flopped badly in previews and closed after only four performances. Even today, it is still deemed one of Broadway's biggest musical disasters.\n\nAn important dramatic role in director Richard Lester's Petulia (1968) led Richard to England, where he stayed and dared to test his acting prowess on the classical stage. With it, his personal satisfaction over image and career improved. Bravura performances as \"Hamlet\" (1969) and \"Richard II\" (1971), as well as his triumph in \"The Lady's Not for Burning\" (1972), won over the not-so-easy-to-impress British audiences. And on the classier film front, he ably portrayed Octavius Caesar opposite Charlton Heston's Mark Antony and Jason Robards' Brutus in Julius Caesar (1970), composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's grandiose Tschaikowsky - Genie und Wahnsinn (1971) opposite Glenda Jackson, and Lord Byron alongside Sarah Miles in Die gro√üe Liebe der Lady Caroline (1972). While none of these three films were critical favorites, they were instrumental in helping to reshape Chamberlain's career as a serious, sturdy and reliable actor.\n\nWith his new image in place, Richard felt ready to face American audiences again. While he made a triumphant Broadway debut as Reverend Shannon in \"The Night of the Iguana\" (1975), he also enjoyed modest box-office popularity with the action-driven adventure films Die drei Musketiere (1973) as Aramis and a villainous role in Flammendes Inferno (1974), and earned cult status for the Australian film Die letzte Flut (1977). On the television front, he became a television idol all over again (on his own terms this time) as the \"King of 80s Mini-Movies\". The epic storytelling of Der Graf von Monte Christo (1975), Die Dornenv√∂gel (1983) and Shogun (1980), all of which earned him Emmy nominations, placed Richard solidly on the quality star list. He won Golden Globe Awards for his starring roles in the last two miniseries mentioned.\n\nIn later years, the actor devoted a great deal of his time to musical stage tours as Henry Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\", Captain Von Trapp in \"The Sound of Music\" and Ebenezer Scrooge in \"Scrooge: The Musical\". Enormously private and having moved to Hawaii to avoid the Hollywood glare, at age 69 finally \"came out\" with a tell-all biography entitled \"Shattered Love\", in which he quite candidly discussed the anguish of hiding his homosexuality to protect his enduring matin√©e idol image.\n\nMarried now to his longtime partner of over 40 years, writer/producer Martin Rabbett, he has since accepted himself and shown to be quite a good sport in the process, appearing as gay characters in the film Chuck und Larry - Wie Feuer und Flamme (2007), and in television episodes of Will & Grace (1998), Desperate Housewives (2004) and Brothers & Sisters (2006). More recently, he has enjoyed featured roles in the films Strength and Honour (2007), The Perfect Family (2011), We Are the Hartmans (2011), Nightmare Cinema (2018) and Finding Julia (2019).\n\nEntrancing, gorgeous Lesley Ann Warren started gearing towards a life in show business right off the bat as a young ballerina who trained at the School of American Ballet at the age of 14. Little did she know that Hollywood stardom would arrive on her doorstep in the form of a \"Cinderella\" story.\n\nThe New York-born actress (August 16, 1946) is the daughter of a night club singer, Margot Warren (n√©e Verblow), and real estate agent, William Warren. Her mother had earlier given up her own entertainment career for marriage and family. Growing up, Lesley attended the Professional Children's School at the age of 6 and High School of Music & Art as a young teenager. At age 17, she studied under Lee Strasberg at his Actors Studio, the youngest student to ever be accepted at the time.\n\nLooking for on-camera work, the teenager appeared unbilled as Shelley Winters's young daughter in the melodrama Der Chapman-Report (1962) and was given a bit in the daytime TV show \"The Doctors.\" The slender, young hopeful gathered early musical stage experience in such shows as \"Bye Bye Birdie\" (as swooning teen Kim McAfee), then made an auspicious Broadway debut in \"110 in the Shade\", the 1963 musical version of \"The Rainmaker,\" and won Broadway's \"Most Promising Newcomer\" Award. She subsequently received the Theatre World Award for her lead work as a \"cat burglar\" opposite Elliott Gould in the very short-lived (8 performances) musical \"Drat! The Cat!\" in 1965.\n\nThe attention Lesley received from this brief stage venture, however, led to her capturing the beguiling title role in the Richard Rodgers/Oscar Hammerstein II TV musical production of Cinderella (1965) with Stuart Damon as her Prince and a glittering, all-star cast in support. The Walt Disney people immediate signed the exquisite \"Cinderella\" to a fresh-faced ing√©nue contract. Co-starring in the moderately-received musical showcases Der gl√ºcklichste Million√§r (1967) and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968), Lesley became convinced that she needed to quickly nip the saccharine stereotype in the bud if she was to grow and sustain as an adult actress.\n\nRebelling against her studio-imposed image, Lesley left Disney determined to pursue roles with more depth, drama and character. Changing her name temporarily to \"Lesley Warren\" to reinforce her more mature goal, she was hired in 1970 to replace Barbara Bain in the long-running espionage series Kobra, √ºbernehmen Sie (1966) when Bain left over contractual issues. Audiences were quite cool in their reception to the \"new and improved\" Lesley and didn't buy her as a femme-fatale replacement for the cool and aloof Ms. Bain.\n\nAfter only one season, Lesley realized her mission to grow was impossible (in spite of an encouraging Golden Globe nomination) and left the show, seeking greener pastures in the TV mini-movie market. She displayed a wide range of vulnerable neurotics as well as sexier ladies that began to alter her pristine image. Such 1970s material included the plane crash adventure Seven in Darkness (1969) as one of several blind survivors; the love drama Love Hate Love (1971) co-starring Ryan O'Neal; a failed pilot in the title role of Cat Ballou (1971); a mild western as one of The Daughters of Joshua Cabe (1972); the exotic \"silent star\" biopic The Legend of Valentino (1975); the rags-to-riches story Harold Robbins' 79 Park Avenue (1977), for which she won a Golden Globe award; the epic WWII story Pearl Harbor (1978); and the social melodramas Verrat an Julie Roy (1978) and Kampf einer Mutter um ihr Kind (1979). Lesley also impressed with her starring roles in the Civil War miniseries Geliebtes Land (1980) and as a Polish-Jewish immigrant in Evergreen (1985). On stage, she ambitiously attempted to recreate Scarlett O'Hara opposite Pernell Roberts's Rhett Butler in a 1973 Broadway-bound musical version of \"Gone with the Wind: The Musical.\" The show quickly died on the West Coast before ever reaching New York.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Lesley's movie career resurrected itself with a priceless performance as kingpin James Garner's whiny-voiced, peroxide-blonde spitfire Norma Cassidy in the slapstick musical Victor/Victoria (1982). Earning both Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, this delightful, scene-stealing turn was followed by a couple of other quality offbeat films that were directed by Alan Rudolph -- Choose Me - Sag ja (1984) and Der Songschreiber (1984). Warren went on to receive a Golden Globe nomination supporting Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson in the former, and a People's Choice Award for the latter. She continued to attempt to spread her wings as a worldly \"cougar\" type opposite young blond and boyish Christopher Atkins in the critically-panned drama Ein himmlischer L√ºmmel (1983). She also played Miss Scarlet in the movie version of the board game Alle M√∂rder sind schon da (1985).\n\nAward-worthy TV roles for Lesley with a Golden Globe performance as a successful madam in the miniseries Harold Robbins' 79 Park Avenue (1977). She also received Emmy and Golden Globe noms as the conflicted wife of a naval officer turned Russian double agent (Powers Boothe) in Family of Spies (1990), as well as for her Cable Ace nom for her work as a barmaid who aspires to be a country-western singer in Liebe auf texanisch (1988). In 1997, she returned to Broadway with the musical revue \"Dream\" co-starring Margaret Whiting, which focused on classic \"Golden Age\" standards.\n\nEntering her sixth decade of acting, Lesley remains highly active well into the millennium with often high-maintenance roles in such films as the Losing Grace (2001), Secretary - Womit kann ich dienen? (2002), My Tiny Universe (2004), When Do We Eat? (2005), The Shore (2006), Stiffs (2010), I Am Michael (2015), The Sphere and the Labyrinth (2015) and 3 Days with Dad (2019). Among her later TV credits are \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"The Practice,\" \"Less Than Perfect,\" \"American Princess,\" and a recurring role as an overly dependent mom named Jinx in the mystery crime series In Plain Sight - In der Schusslinie (2008). Her dim, riotous Norma Cassady role had TV often pitching her as a scatter-brained comedienne, as in her recurring TV guest parts on Will & Grace (1998) and Desperate Housewives (2004).\n\nLesley has a son, actor/producer Christopher Peters, from her 1967-'73 marriage to makeup artist/hair stylist-cum-film producer Jon Peters. Since 2000, she has been married to advertising exec and sometime actor Ron Taft, a former vice-president at Columbia.\n\nBarbara Eden, born Barbara Jean Morehead in Tucson, Arizona, became one of America's most endearing and enduring actresses. A graduate of Abraham Lincoln High School in San Francisco, California, Eden would go on to study at San Francisco's City College as well as the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and the Elizabeth Holloway School of Theatre. While her aspirations as a singer motivated her during her early years for a career in music, it was her starring role in the NBC TV comedy series, Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) where Barbara Eden immediately gained international acclaim.\n\nAlthough most remembered for her role as \"Jeannie\", Barbara Eden has starred in more than 20 theatrical feature films and made-for-television films for at least four different movie studios: 20th Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia Studios, and Universal Studios, most notably in the film Flammender Stern (1960), when she acted as Elvis Presley's leading lady. Other films in which Barbara Eden had a leading role were Unternehmen Feuerg√ºrtel (1961), Die Wunderwelt der Gebr√ºder Grimm (1962), F√ºnf Wochen im Ballon (1962), Der mysteri√∂se Dr. Lao (1964) and Mein Zimmer wird zum Harem (1964). The Brass Bottle comedy movie led to Sidney Sheldon's creation of Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) comical TV series.\n\nIn television, Eden made her first featured appearance on Country Club Dance (1957), as the series was nearing cancellation (there were just two more episodes). Eden immediately landed a starring role in the television version of Wie angelt man sich einen Million√§r? (1957), where she portrayed the same character role originated by Marilyn Monroe. Another memorable appearance came on The Manicurist (1962), featuring her in the character role, special guest-star, as well as her occupation being titled.\n\nIn 1965, Barbara Eden was cast the leading role in Sidney Sheldon's NBC sitcom, Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965). It televised weekly, for five successful and humorous seasons with 139 episodes. After \"Jeannie,\" Barbara Eden went on to star in many other comical and family productions including Die Rache der blonden Hexe (1978) and Chattanooga Choo Choo (1984) among other numerous highly rated made-for-television movies well into the 1990s. She has also acted in multiple western series and thrillers.\n\nOutside of her film and television works, Barbara Eden headlined major hotel resorts and casinos including Lake Tahoe, Atlantic City and Las Vegas. She also was the star attraction at the MGM Grand, Harrah's, Caesar's Palace and on concert stages and legitimate theaters across the country.\n\nUtilizing her singing ability, Eden released an album titled \"Miss Barbara Eden\" in 1967, for record company, Dot Records. She has also been a musical guest star in a wide range of variety television shows. Eden's appearances included 21 Bob Hope special shows, along with The Carol Burnett Show (1967), The Jonathan Winters Show (1967), The Sonny and Cher Show (1976), The Jerry Lewis Show (1963), Die Tom Jones-Show (1969), Tony Orlando and Dawn (1974), and Donny and Marie (1975).\n\nDuring the Persian Gulf War, she traveled with Bob Hope to the middle-east to perform for the combat troops and then continued on with Hope in a whirlwind eight-day, around-the-world USO tour entertaining servicemen during the Christmas season.\n\nTo celebrate the 2002 Yuletide season, she responded to an invitation from President George Bush; Barbara journeyed to Washington D.C. and sang \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" at the annual White House \"Lighting of the National Christmas Tree\" event where she also hosted the show and pageant with President and Mrs. Bush for an audience of 6,000 cheering fans on the Ellipse near the White House.\n\nA multi-talent, Eden starred in the national touring musicals Meine Lieder, meine Tr√§ume (1965) and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1998). In the latter production, she played Lorelei Lee, the character created on Broadway by Carol Channing and performed by Marilyn Monroe in the 20th Century Fox film version. Eden also toured vastly in various stage productions like Neil Simon's Der Letzte der feurigen Liebhaber (1972), Das sch√∂nste Freudenhaus in Texas (1982), Annie Get Your Gun (1967), Die S√ºdsee (2009) and Nite Club Confidential (1996). In the play \"Love Letters,\" Eden reunited with her Bezaubernde Jeannie (1965) co-star, Larry Hagman. The duo toured metropolitan and major cities, across the United States. Eden starred in Neil Simon's \"The Odd Couple: Female Version\", and \"Social Security\" (1985). She has also been seen in TV series like, All Star Blitz (1985), Entertainment Tonight (1981) and Larry King Live (1985).\n\nIn 2011, Crown Archetype, a division of Random House, published Barbara's memoir, \"Jeannie Out of the Bottle,\" which debuted at number 14 on the New York Times Best Seller List and on Australia's Best Seller List, published there by Harper-Collins, Inc. The autobiography chronicle's Eden's colorful life and remarkable Hollywood career that spans more than 50 years.\n\nOne of Hollywood's busiest actresses, Barbara filmed a starring role in Always and Forever (2009), a movie filmed by and for the Hallmark Channel.
