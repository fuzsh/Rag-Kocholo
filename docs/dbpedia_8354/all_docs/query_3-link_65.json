        "text": "Description:\n\nI have been visiting Glacier and the Flathead since I was a youngin’ and have been in love with this area since. That said, I am so excited and lucky to be raft guiding in one of my favorite places this season! As a recent nursing graduate and a bit of an adrenaline junky, I am always seeking out my next adventure, be it exploring new places or pursuing a career in critical care. Although: if meeting new people and hearing their stories could be a profession in itself, sign me up. I love learning about her life experiences and simply enjoying hardy laughs with anyone who is kind enough to laugh at my terrible jokes\n\nDescription:\n\nJennifer joined us in 2002, and has been guiding us down the river and on the trails ever since. Jen is one of our most vivacious Glacier National Park guides and has a true passion for the park. She has also guided in the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, the Cabinet Mountains, and on the Clark Fork River. Her education is in Forest Resource Management, and boy does she know her plants. When she is not guiding, you can find her rafting on other rivers or rippin’ up the slopes on her snowboard in the winter. She also works at our local gear shop and does she know her gear! Jennifer is also certified as a Leave No Trace Master Educator.\n\nDescription:\n\nHaley fell in love with Glacier the summer of 2021 during her first season working out here! Her first day on the job she was told that, \"Glacier has a way of sinking its teeth into you\" and boy were they right! She's been coming back ever since. In the winter she studies elementary education at the University of Maine. She loves to bike, ski, hike... anything outdoors. Oh, and if you're ever out on a hike or backpacking trip with Haley, she LOVES Taylor Swift, making for plenty of trail sing-a-long options.\n\nDescription:\n\nJudith knows the answer! How, where, who, what, and when – if you need anything involving the office, Judith can help you out. Judith began working as a lead guide on the rivers and trails with her strength in geology. Over the years she decided she preferred the lively pace of the office and now manages the grand scheduling of all the Glacier National Park guides. She still enjoys leading a few day hiking trips a year, especially if the group speaks German. Track her down for the answers, or do your best to catch this hiking, bicycling, and skiing ball of energy.\n\nFavorite Place:\n\nNyack/Coal Creek District: SW Glacier Park. Why? “It’s very secluded – nobody there, beautiful scenery, great spot to watch for mountain goats at the head of Beaver Woman Lake. The Nyack Loop makes for a great 3-4 day backpacking trip.” Maybe if one hikes like Judith you can complete the loop in 4 days, but it’s more likely that once in the Nyack you’re going to want to take your time and enjoy it. We explore the Nyack region from time to time on our 4 day and 6 day backpacking trips.\n\nDescription:\n\nTara first came to Glacier on a road trip in 2020 on a quest to visit all of the National Parks in the US. She fell in love with Glacier's beauty and has fun facts about all of Glacier's famous Glaciers. Ask her about her superlatives while in the backcountry with her!\n\nDescription:\n\nWhile studying Geography and GIS in college, Nicolette took a summer job in Glacier National Park and found it life altering that she could look at more than Minnesota’s small glacial moraines. Her favorite part about guiding is giving people unfamiliar with rafting the opportunity to see Glacier’s beautiful and unique landscapes. Don’t forget to ask Nicolette for a geology talk, or a list of the best restaurants in town, before you leave her boat!\n\nDescription:\n\nTyler is a raft guide here at Glacier Guides and Montana Raft. When he is not rafting he likes to search for Stoneflys. Don't even ask, because he has no desire to go to the moon. He claims that nobody can beat him in a game of Mario Kart Double Dash. It took him a full 18 years to do a backflip on a trampoline, but he continues to do backflips to make sure our guests have the very best raft trip imaginable. In the winter, he loves riding around in powder on two planks of wood. He's got all the fun facts and would love to tell ya about some Grinnell Argillite.\n\nDescription:\n\nDanielle grew up in the beautiful high desert of New Mexico and took the “roundabout” way to a career in guiding. She studied Business Administration at the University of New Mexico, worked as a marketing director and event manager for 3 years and then decided to move into the outdoor rec world - and hasn’t looked back! She spent her first season guiding camping trips and day hikes all over the lower 48 and Canada, as well as 2 seasons as a sea kayaking guide. Some of her favorite places to lead tours are the Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree, Grand Teton, Yosemite, the Apostle Islands, Everglades and of course - Glacier. Although she considers herself a desert dweller, Montana’s gorgeous scenery and moody rain are quickly becoming a favorite. When she’s not a tour guide she loves being a tourist, travel is what she’s most passionate about.\n\nDescription:\n\nBrigid is an incredible fishing guide and all around mountain woman. She studied International Business and Spanish at Central Washington University. After college she landed in Whitefish, intending to spend only a winter as a ski bum. Within months she got a job at the Great Northern Bar and eventually joined the Whitefish Mountain Ski Patrol. Over 20 years later, she has established roots, friends, multiple adventures and careers. She spends her winters doing what she loves – any type of adventuring involving snow. Her summers are spent mountain biking, hiking, paddleboarding, floating rivers, and of course fly-fishing. Brigid is currently enrolled in the Integrated Agricultural Program at Flathead Valley Community College. What better way to spend your summers... growing and sharing produce, and adventuring in the Flathead Valley?\n\nDescription:\n\nMel is one of our fabulous hiking guides. He grew up in Maine, graduating college in 2021 with a degree in Environmental policy from UMaine. Since then, he has spent his summers hiking part of the Continental Divide Trail from Mexico to Montana. Let's just say Mel likes walking. A lot. He is also an enthusiast of sleeping on the ground, sliding on snow, and he likes to play the guitar when he has some free time.\n\nDescription:\n\nDenny knows Glacier! Denny started here as a guide in 1993, and has since become one of our owners. We challenge you to stump one of our best naturalists. In addition to knowing his stuff, you’ll love Denny’s entertaining tales and savvy cooking. When not in Glacier, you might spy this backpacker in South America, Nepal, guiding polar bear viewing trips in Canada, helping his wife Caeli with Climate Ride, or working as a ski patroller at Whitefish Mountain Resort. Denny also works to make sure each backpacking trip runs smoothly.\n\nDescription:\n\nHali is a lover of the outdoors and is probably really excited to talk to you about plants. She feels passionately about educating her guests about the importance of practicing Leave No Trace Principals when visiting Glacier National Park. Before working in Glacier, Hali worked in four other National Parks - Yellowstone, Denali, Grand Canyon and Zion, Glacier is by far her favorite. When hiking with Hali, you're going to learn a little, and laugh a lot. She loves to dazzle her guests with her inventive trail songs, and encourages you to get a little weird too. When Hali is not hiking the trails throughout the beautiful park, she is teaching Yoga/Breathwork, hosting workshops and retreats. She believe that yoga and hiking go hand and hand. Listen to your body, move at a pace that feels good, and focus on your breath. Nothing is more healing than the kind of tired you feel from a little fresh air and a little bit of too much sun.\n\nDescription:\n\nWhat can we say about Bill? He started here in 2004, and has been our Chief Getitstartedkeepitgoing Guy. He is certified in a plethora of things that most of us have never heard of. We just know that he’s great at maintaining vehicles and ski lifts. When he is not working hard in the shop, he spends as much of his time near the river as possible. Bill returned to school after 30 years and completed a degree in English/Creative Writing. Nice job Bill!\n\nDescription:\n\nLucas is a hiking guide here at GGMR. Over the last several years, his focus has been on botany and wildlife in the Intermountain west. He started guiding in New Zealand as an adventure cave guide in 2019. Now back in Montana, he is excited to share his passion for these landscapes with people from around the world.\n\nDescription:\n\nRyan joined us as a hiking and rafting guide in 2013. Super sweet and excited about the park, he loves sharing Glacier with guests — when he is not running, mountain biking, cross-stitching, and SUP’ing across Glacier’s longest lakes. In his off-season he has coordinated climbing expeditions for young people and been a surf instructor in New Zealand. Ryan is the star of our group. When he was young, he was the star of a Purity Dairy milk commercial and a speaking role in a made for TV movie, ” The Brooke Ellison Story.”\n\nDescription:\n\nLilian is the marketing and communications director at Glacier Guides (known as L2 around the office). She is Montana born, raised and never leaving. She got her journalism and film degrees from The University of Montana. Her love for the mountains started when she was very young, skiing and hiking all over the Beartooth Mountains and in her favorite secret place in Montana (she will never tell!). One of her favorite memories is when she traveled to the Indian Himalayas and backpacked for 3 weeks her last year in college. She loves hiking, skiing, days on the river, days on the lake, time spent with her dog, Zero and her fiance Andrew and anything she can do outside. She can be seen around Glacier Guides HQ with a phone in her hand and a constant smile on her face.\n\nDescription:\n\nJennifer is one of our top notch hiking guides. She was raised in Wisconsin and found herself in the mountains of Glacier accidently while traveling across the states post graduating college in Ohio. She's always loved the outdoors and spent an entire summer hiking and backpacking through Glacier National Park when she decided to make the mountains and Flathead Valley her new home! She is also a professional trail runner (MEGA talent over here) and spends many hours a day exploring all the trails that the valley has to offer. She's come to respect and love the area, and love sharing with others all that it has to offer.\n\nDescription:\n\nKim is the sister of Jennifer. She loves to travel and go to as many national parks as possible so when her sister Jennifer told her about working for the guides and having unlimited access in and out of Glacier National Park, She couldn't resist. In her time off from working in the kitchen and the Lodge, she spends her evenings and days off hiking and rafting.\n\nDescription:\n\nCheri started as one of our Glacier National Park guides in 2001 after working at the Glacier Institute. Her knowledge of botany makes her a great gal to have around when hiking through one of the many flower filled meadows. She is also known for her culinary and coffee brewing skills, which come in handy now that she runs our kitchen. When not in Glacier, Cheri might be home visiting her native Adirondacks, teaching herbalist classes at our local community college, or hanging out with her two adorable children.\n\nDescription:\n\nFishing guide Kurt Lewis is an angler to the core and has been guiding these rivers over 20 years. He currently holds the prestigious title of being “The Oldest Guide on the River.” He is patient, knowledgeable, and thinks like a fish. Kurt is always full of humorous stories and local lore that contribute to making your day on the river memorable and fun. When Kurt isn’t guiding, he’s fishing, tying flies, and thinking about fishing. Feel free to request him for your North or Middle Fork of the Flathead River fishing adventure!\n\nDescription:\n\nLike most people, I was born a baby. I was the youngest of four boys in a household consistently headed for the great Montanan outdoors every weekend. Camping, fishing, and hiking with the fam really kindled my fire to be outside, especially when my brother pushed me in the fire pit because I was winning tag. But alas, that’s a story for another time. I worked for MT DNRC for two and a half years straight out of college before trading in the big boy pants for a pair of Chacos and hiking sticks. “I’ve never broken any bones and my first cup of coffee ever consumed was last year on a Glacier Guides and Montana Raft trip.”\n\nDescription:\n\nAs one of our river and hiking Glacier National Park guides since 1996, Keith loves Glacier. When not exploring, Keith is out there teaching our local 5th graders. We need more teachers like him! When asked about how he feels about Glacier: “On the river or on the trail, I Glacier, therefore I am!” is all he says.\n\nFavorite Place:\n\nSummit of Mt. Stimson (Southwestern/Nyack region). Why Stimson? “Glacier’s 2nd highest mountain has been taunting me for 6 years now. I see this gorgeous, elusive, and remote peak on the river every day during our full day and overnight rafting trips, as well any time I’m up in the high country looking its way. Been turned around by bears climbing it once, but someday soon I’ll be sitting on the top with the most amazing view. Half the beauty of experiencing a favorite place is the giddy anticipation of getting there.”\n\nDescription:\n\nOriginally from New Mexico, Dave has guided outdoor recreation across the country and globe. After completing a degree in Adventure Tourism Management from Humboldt State University, he spent years in Vermont and Colorado before settling down in Whitefish. Dave spends his winters in Northern Japan guiding backcountry ski trips and eating as much sushi as possible. On his days off Dave usually finds himself on his mountain bike or drinking a beer on a sunny porch in town.\n\nDescription:\n\nI was born and raised near the beach but now spend my free time at higher elevations camping, fishing, climbing, and hiking. I was first introduced to Glacier National Park on a solo road trip in 2018 – came for the views, stayed for the fish and winter powdah. Fishing and snowboarding fill up my free time. Need that second home rented for the winter? I got you covered!\n\nDescription:\n\nKirsty is a day hiking and backpacking Glacier National Park guide, and a former Sperry Chalet employee. She tells herself that astrology isn’t real, but doesn’t always believe herself. She likes to write bad, facetious horoscopes in her free time. If she won the lottery, she’d pay off her student loans and travel. In the off season, Kirsty often works at McMurdo Station, Antarctica! She’s been there seasonally since 2013. Kirsty realized she has synaesthesia after reading a bio of Vladimir Nabokov a few years ago – she sees letters and numbers as colors.\n\nDescription:\n\nAfter graduating college in San Diego, I traded the saltwater for freshwater and took a job working with the Montana Conservation Corps. I developed a passion for everything wild in Montana and found my way to Glacier Guides leading day hikes. I love sharing my passion and knowledge for the outdoors with others, and showing off all the beauty Glacier has to offer. When I'm not hiking, you can find me looking for mountain goats, chasing pow, and spending time in the sun.\n\nDescription:\n\nMákete first came to Glacier in the summer of 2004 to volunteer on a Grizzly Bear population study. He has since spent many years working in Glacier on research projects involving bears, amphibians, and soils/geology. He has also studied Lynx in NW Montana, Wolves in Yellowstone, and big carnivores in Zambia. One of his other great passions is music, and he spent several years traveling the world playing music on the streets, venues, and festival stages. He also loves dad jokes.\n\nDescription:\n\nRuss was a Backpacking, Fishing, Hiking, and Rafting guide with Glacier Guides and Montana Raft from 1994 to 2002 and has been back as a fishing guide since 2019. Russ is the author of Fishing Glacier National Park, Hiking the Columbia River Gorge, and the co-author of Hiking Montana and Backpacking Tips with his father Bill Schneider who was the co-founder of FalconGuides. When Russ is not fishing, floating, hiking, writing or biking he is probably crunching numbers on an outside consulting project or doing some community thing. Russ is known for his custom Rapid Robert style wooden drift boat and his appreciation for native park fisheries.\n\nDescription:\n\nAdam was born in a small hospital room in Massachusetts with a full head of curly locks. In his youth, he was occasionally seen scrambling around the rock-and-root-infested trails of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Looking for taller peaks and larger skies, Adam moved to Colorado in 2014 to pursue a degree in the sociology of humor. Unfortunately, explaining humor is like dissecting a frog: you understand it better, but the frog dies in the process. After four years of killing the frog, Adam tried telling the same old jokes to a different audience each season. His seventh grade students never laughed. The boat punks didn’t laugh either. The ski lift operators didn’t laugh. Farmers market vendors didn’t even chuckle. Neither did the landscapers, berry pickers, or sushi chefs. So we find him now at Glacier Guides, trying to get at least a smile out of his guests.\n\nDescription:\n\nBehold the River God! Jeff co-manages our river operations and is always ready to pitch in. Whether behind the oars or driving the bus, this savvy veteran gets the job done. When not here in Glacier, you can find Jeff floating the Grand Canyon, exploring Costa Rica, saving injured souls via the Ski Patrol in nearby Whitefish, MT, or chasing one of his two boys around. Butte is a busy guy!\n\nDescription:\n\nJacob grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan and he has always striven to have adventures like Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings. Jacob says that Glacier Guides has been an awesome opportunity to expand his skills and form a deep spiritual connection to the park. On his free time, he likes to bag peaks - the most epic of which thus far has been Rainbow Peak. Currently, he studies economics at Michigan State (the real MSU). A few fun facts: He love the song \"We Didn't Start The Fire\" and is fluent in Korean.\n\nDescription:\n\nBritt is a raft manager at Glacier Guides. He is a Whitewater enthusiast! National Top Ramen cook off champion, so good he doesn't even need the flavor packet. To tall for his paco pad...cold feet forever. Britt started raft guiding in California and worked his way back to his home state. Constant pursuit of high water, Lochsa!! Love it or leave it. Britt has a background as an instructor of Swiftwater and Rope Rescue. Board games over videogames, Settlers of Catan is life. He says he is forever curious and always excited to learn something new. When it's to dark to raft, he likes to read and is very excited to be part of the Glacier Guides team!\n\nDescription:\n\nLife is good, especially when I get to hike and revel in such a perfectly beautiful place as Glacier National Park. I’ve also worked at the Y for 10 years and I love helping people and building community. In addition, I’ve been involved in conservation projects, which I find meaningful. It’s important to try to save the world! And it’s fun to learn more about natural history, especially when I get to enjoy the beauty and bounty of nature. Finally: eating good grub is part of what it’s all about for me.\n\nDescription:\n\nKiandra has been guiding since 2002. A river soul at heart, Glacier National Park has made her a hiking, mountain climbing and backpacking enthusiast since gravitating here in 2004. Her positive, cheerful attitude is enjoyed by all, and everyone looks forward to doing a trip with her. She graduated from the University of Michigan with a focus on Sports Management and Communication, English and History. She has extended her education to learn the history, geology, ecology, and area knowledge that makes NW Montana so unique. She started on the water at a young age, canoeing the Canadian bush with her family regularly. With the community she has here locally now, she's been fortunate enough to explore boating trips from South America to Alaska, including many of the great western rivers. In her off time, she enjoys photography, traveling to new places and the good 'ol hockey game. Kiandra is also our resident hockey fanatic–Go Blue and Go Leafs Go!\n\nDescription:\n\nKenn came to us in 2012 from Michigan. His main goal was to explore the rivers and lakes around Glacier Park and be around his daughter, who is one of our Glacier National Park guides. When Ken’s not driving guests to and from the trailhead or river put in, he is out exploring. Or maybe watching Michigan hockey! Kenn graduated from Eastern Michigan University with majors in earth science and coastal environments. He has been to all 50 states and canoed over 10,000 miles of Canadian rivers.\n\nDescription:\n\nCaiti is technically our Assistant Office Manager, but in our hearts she is the Director of Fun + Frivolity. Our theme parties are famous in large part due to Caiti! Her creativity is legendary – as her profile picture underlines. If Caiti isn’t giving out Glacier advice on the phone or planning a fabulous soiree, you can find her on the river with her sweet dog, Numa.\n\nOur Guides\n\nThe BEST outfit that we’ve ever been out with! The company promotes giving great service and provides their team with the support and necessary tools to give their customers A WOW experience! The food they provide is amazing. Thanks Judith, Katie, Taylor and Jeff for making our 6 day backpacking trip a blast…and the river rafting!\n\n— Jas Dhillon\n\nRead More Reviews\n\nOur Guides\n\nShout out to our guides Jared, Jacob, and Sage!! They were funny, entertaining, energetic, knowledgeable, and kept the vibe high! My family came with a huge party of about 30 people which included adults and children. The Lee and Yang family had a great time and highly recommend this rafting company!\n\n— Chewy Yang\n\nRead More Reviews\n\nOur Guides\n\nMy family and I went on a white water raft with Nicolette and it was one of the best experiences! Nic has such an awesome personality and really made an already awesome experience even better. The views you get to see along this ride are great. I highly recommend taking a trip with this company!\n\n— Kelsey Morgan\n\nRead More Reviews\n\nOur Guides\n\nOur guide Scott did a great job prepping and leading the tour, which consisted of 6 guests (including myself). The description of the tour and FAQ/prep materials list and itinerary that the company sent over beforehand were very accurate and super helpful! Aside from a quick hail storm, we got great weather and an extremely enjoyable three days of hiking in East Glacier crossing the Continental Divide. Scott did an excellent job of explaining to us how the backcountry permitting system works and from that explanation I was amazed at the amount of work that each guide must put into every single tour. They are truly responsible for everything while you’re out, so having an experienced guide with the right temperament and attitude are a must—especially if things go wrong. I’m glad to say everything went as planned! I was able to spot several animals and some breathtaking scenery alongside good conversation within our group of former strangers. Great job, Scott and Glacier Guides!\n\n— Ryan Gabbart\n\nRead More Reviews"
