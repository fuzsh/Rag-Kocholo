The inspiring program featured show-stopping Broadway performances from Shoshana Bean (Hell’s Kitchen), Sky Lakota Lynch and Josh Strobl (The Outsiders), and Deborah Cox (The Wiz); powerful storytelling; and inspiring remarks from President & CEO, Jaymes Black, reminding guests of the progress we can make when we all work together.\n\n“Those who oppose us are organized, relentless, and actively crafting…an America without justice or liberty for all,” said Black in their on-stage remarks. “This is why the work of Family Equality is critical to our community and country. Family Equality is wrapping its arms around more families than ever before, providing them with a loving community, resources, and tools. By telling our stories, mobilizing our communities, and sharing our experiences, we will build a resilient, unstoppable movement. Together, we will show the world what it means to be a family, what it means to stand together, and what it means to love without limits or fear. Family, this is our time. This is our calling. This is our destiny. Welcome to the rebirth of hope!”\n\nThe evening also included:\n\nThe presentation of our Visibility Award to game-changing corporate pioneer and openly gay CEO, Ken Ohashi, who puts a national spotlight on current and future families through his visionary leadership at Brooks Brothers.
