The review of 112 studies reveals that the lack of consensus in echo chamber research is based on different conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. While studies that have conceptualized echo chambers with homophily and utilized data-driven computational social science (CSS) methods have confirmed the echo chamber hypothesis and polarization effects in social media, content exposure studies and surveys that have explored the full spectrum of media exposure have rejected it.\n\nMost of these studies have been conducted in the United States, and the review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how echo chambers work in systems with more than two parties and outside the Global North. To advance our understanding of this phenomenon, future research should prioritize conducting more cross-platform studies, considering algorithmic filtering changes through continuous auditing, and examining the causal direction of the association between polarization, fragmentation, and the establishment of online echo chambers. The review also provides the advantages and disadvantages of different operationalizations and makes recommendations for studies in the European Union (EU), which will become possible with the upcoming Digital Services Act (DSA). Overall, this systematic review contributes to the ongoing scholarly discussion on the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles.\n\nComputational Social Science, Systematic Review, Echo Chamber, Filter Bubble, Measurement Modeling, DSA\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe impact of social media on public discussions and democratic processes has been a hot topic for more than a decade. With the election year 2024, in which elections take place in more than 50 countries, including the United States, India, and the EU - and the EU regulation on very large online platforms (see the Digital Services Act (European Commission, 2022)), this topic remains very current. The emerging shift to the political right, along with declining trust in democratic institutions and science, raises concerns that the advent of social media platforms may have contributed to these phenomena (Bail et al., 2018a; Quattrociocchi, 2017; Lorenz-Spreen et al., 2023).\n\nMany believe that the constructs echo chamber and filter bubble can explain the decline in democratic exchange, as they cause social media users to become polarized (e.g., Bail et al. (2018a); Minh Pham et al. (2020)) and radicalized. Echo chambers – a term first introduced by Sunstein (2001) who repeatedly emphasized the dangers of echo chambers – are frequently defined similarly as “environments in which the opinion, political leaning, or belief of users about a topic gets reinforced due to repeated interactions with peers or sources having similar tendencies and attitudes (Cinelli et al., 2020).” In the context of social media, this involves the interchangeably used but differing concept of filter bubbles. Filter bubbles – coined by Pariser (2011) – are created by personalized recommendation systems that expose users to content similar to their beliefs. These algorithms focus on ranking and content moderation to provide users with a personalized universe of information (Pariser, 2011). As they are often used and conceptualized similarly and as Sunstein included algorithms in the characterization of echo chambers in subsequent publications, we will look at both constructs under the name echo chamber in this work.\n\nBoth theoretical constructs – at least the public discussion around them (Van Aelst et al., 2017; Dubois and Blank, 2018) – underscore the need for exposure to diverse viewpoints, which, according to Habermas (2010) and Dahlgren (2005), is crucial for the public ability to influence politics through a critical exchange of ideas and consensus-building essential for a robust democracy. The fear regarding echo chambers on social media arises from users having a vast range of media environments to choose from on the internet. Thus, users can choose to be exposed to conversations with like-minded users and content that reflects their existing preferences or beliefs (Van Aelst et al., 2017; Dubois and Blank, 2018). According to the echo chamber hypothesis (Terren and Borge, 2021) , echo chambers in social networks lead to the fragmentation of increasingly polarized groups, which can profoundly impact public debate. There is a growing fear that echo chambers have led or could lead to an epistemological crisis and seriously threaten democratic societies (Benkler et al., 2018).\n\nHowever, there is conflicting evidence on the existence and effects of echo chambers. Thus, the motivation for conducting this review is the fact that empirical research – especially regarding computation social science – on echo chambers remains inconclusive. The review will address the following research questions:\n\n(1)\n\nWhat is the evidence for the existence, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers in social networks?\n\n(2)\n\nWhich conceptualizations and operationalizations are used in quantitative and mixed-methods echo chamber research?\n\n(3)\n\nWhat are the reasons for the varying outcomes in echo chamber research?\n\nThe systematic review offers an overview of antecedents, properties (like existence), and effects of echo chambers in social networks based on research published until December 31st, 2023. We reviewed 112 peer-reviewed studies. From an initial set of 1.651 studies, we selected these 112 studies based on criteria explained in Section 2.5 . We identify a taxonomy of conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers and determine antecedents and effects that organize existing work and support future studies. This analysis aims to highlight certain assumptions and choices in the study design of individual research. We find that echo chamber studies differ in (1) outcomes, (2) focus, (3) construct conceptualization and (4) operationalization, and (5) granularity.\n\nStudies differ in outcomes, as some research has found evidence for echo chambers on platforms such as Facebook (e.g., Schmidt et al. (2020)), while other studies have not identified evidence on the same platform (e.g., Beam et al. (2018); Bakshy et al. (2015)). Echo chambers are also repeatedly associated with the spread of misinformation, which poses the risk of poor political decisions or the formation of opinions based on falsehoods (Del Vicario et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2020; Jasny et al., 2015). However, scientific findings have also been contrasting with the echo chamber hypothesis. Some studies indicate that social media networks are similar to real-life interpersonal networks (e.g., Dubois and Blank (2018), Bastos et al. (2018)), thus downplaying the asserted impact of social media or that social networks do not change the political discourse excessively (e.g., Barbera et al. (2015); Bruns (2017); Guess et al. (2018)). Further, some studies claim that echo chambers have no significant impact (e.g., Dubois and Blank (2018)) or do not demonstrate increased exposure to dissimilar opinions through social media. According to some studies, societal polarization is not a phenomenon attributable exclusively to social media, but to other forms of media like radio and TV as well (e.g, Jamieson and Hall (2008)).\n\nFurthermore, the echo chamber construct is controversial, and researchers claim that it was ill-defined from the beginning and that researchers should abandon it (Mahrt, 2019). This is largely because the concept does not represent any observable outcome since “echo chambers” describe a state of absence, namely the absence of an idealized model of a deliberative public sphere such as the Habermasian democratic model (Kitchens et al., 2020; Bruns, 2017). However, there are categories under which different conceptualizations of echo chambers can be classified, and one of the main goals of this review is to categorize these conceptualizations and clarify the confusion.\n\nIn addition, studies on echo chambers in social networks have been carried out by researchers from various fields – such as computer science, sociology, political science, law, media, and communication science – using differing methods and thus different operationalizations of the echo chamber construct. Some studies have conducted a network analysis based on data from social networks (Cinelli et al., 2021a), while others have interviewed Twitter/X users after they were exposed to the contents of a social media bot (Bail et al., 2018a). Data sets differ among studies and different data sets lead to dissimilar findings regarding the existence of echo chambers (Terren and Borge, 2021).\n\nThe difficulties in operationalizing extend to the granularity of echo chamber detection as they can occur on individual users, groups, or entire platforms (Kratzke, 2023) and related to the research decision to analyze specific groups or platforms, data utilized in the empirical research is subject to sampling bias even if there are attempts to counteract these differences (Kitchens et al., 2020; Dubois and Blank, 2018). Previous studies may have analyzed mainly active users and used scarce or incomplete data sets to support their conclusions. This fact may have led to misleading results, as the periphery of networks appears to be essential for the average behavior of social networks (Shore et al., 2018). Studies analyzed online platforms either independently (one specific platform) or in aggregate (all of social media), which may make it difficult to determine the link between social aspects, technological characteristics, and information-limiting contexts (Kitchens et al., 2020). If only one medium (e.g. only one platform or one online newspaper) is analyzed, this may not provide relevant information on how political information moves across offline and online media (Dubois and Blank, 2018). Moreover, demographics differ across platforms (Mellon and Prosser, 2017; Center, 2021).\n\nLike Jacobs and Wallach (2021) in the case of fairness, we propose to use measurement modeling from the quantitative social sciences (Jackman, 2008) to discuss the echo chamber construct and to compare conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers. We argue that employing measurement modeling can help clarify how research defines and measures the concept of an “echo chamber” and how this is linked to the differences we observe in research outcomes.\n\nLastly, echo chamber research differs in focus. Some research studies are primarily concerned with the echo chamber hypothesis, while others focus on the antecedents, properties, and effects of echo chambers. It is crucial to compare demographics and political environments of studies, as Kitchens et al. (2020) claimed that most research that confirms the echo chamber hypothesis has been conducted in the United States.\n\nWe therefore argue that a broader perspective on antecedents, properties, and effects of echo chambers as a concept is essential to understanding sociotechnical structure and mechanisms of social media. We understand social media and recommendation technologies as sociotechnical systems embedded in a complex dynamic political and social system which may have multiple feedback loops. A multi-perspective and multi-granular (individual level, structural level) approach to the topic is crucial to promote the understanding of these structures and their reproduction by such systems. This distinguishes this review from existing reviews on echo chambers, echo chamber detection, filter bubbles, and social media.\n\nIn 2021, Terren and Borge (2021) conducted a systematic review to explore the existence of echo chambers in social networks. Similar to this systematic review, it aimed to provide a better overview of the current research (up to January 2020) and identify differences in research approaches. The authors examined 55 studies related to the existence of echo chambers in social networks. They found that differences in research design impacted whether the studies concluded that echo chambers exist in social networks. In particular, different data sets on which the research was conducted produced different results. Trace data clearly showed the existence of echo chambers, whereas self-reported data from survey studies did not (Terren and Borge, 2021). While Terren and Borge (2021) sorted existing echo chamber literature by data set and foci, referring to foci such as interaction-centric studies and content-centered studies; they only provided a summary of studies that explicitly referred to the echo chamber hypothesis. In contrast, the present study provides a more comprehensive analysis of echo chambers and social media which includes antecedents, properties, and effects of echo chambers.\n\nFurthermore, non-systematic literature reviews on echo chambers, filter bubbles, and thematically related phenomena exist . Arguedas et al. (2022) examined social science evidence of online echo chambers’ existence, antecedents, and effects. They found no evidence for the echo chamber hypothesis and presented a mixed picture of how news and media affect polarization.\n\nLorenz-Spreen et al. (2023) analyzed nearly 500 articles on the impact of digital media on democracy including examining echo chambers. Findings are mixed: while social media platforms are shown to diversify news consumption, they also contribute to the formation and confirmation of ideologically similar social groups. They suggest a link between the increased knowledge through digital media and the rise of homophilic social structures, which may relate to the spread of hate speech and anti-outgroup sentiments. The systematic review of Interian et al. ([n. d.]) examined network polarization measures of 78 studies and identified the most used ones in research on online social data.\n\nThis systematic review departs from previous work to discuss different echo chamber research outcomes. This review aims to fill the gap by providing a broader perspective on echo chambers while focusing on the antecedents, properties, and effects and analyzing the conceptualizations and operationalization.\n\n2. Method\n\nWe follow the PRISMA 2020 (Page et al., 2021) guideline to present a transparent account of how we conducted our systematic review. A systematic review following the PRISMA 2020 guideline involves the following elements (Gough, 2007; Grant and Booth, 2009): (1) a definition of research questions (see below), a strategy regarding the search for relevant literature to answer these questions (Section 2.1), explicit criteria for inclusion and exclusion of research literature (Section 2.4.3), synthesis of evidence that can be derived from the literature (Appendix, Section Appendix), and a summary of the results presented in a structured manner (Section 3).\n\nTo allow for reproducibility, we make all steps of the reviewing process explicit and describe them in detail. Our research questions are conceptual questions and methodology questions, as we are both interested in how echo chambers are conceptualized and what methods have been used to study them, to find how the varying outcomes in the literature emerge (Booth et al., 2012).\n\nWe use standardized methods for search, evaluation, and selection of studies reduce subjective influences (Biondi-Zoccai et al., 2011). The search strategy is discussed in more detail in section 2.1. It includes keywords and scientific databases we identified as relevant to the search, which we lay out in section 2.2. The criteria for inclusion and exclusion of papers are presented in section 2.5. The PRISMA 2020 flow diagram is depicted in Figure 1.\n\n2.1. Search Protocol\n\nThe search protocol for the systematic review was designed to be broad in its inclusion of relevant databases and search words, consistent in its use of the same search word strings across databases, and efficient in reducing the number of irrelevant results. Some searches, such as “echo chamber” as a keyword, produced too many results. Other terms, such as “echo chamber hypothesis” or “existence” were too limiting and returned only few results . Keywords were refined iteratively. Two main groups of keywords that identified broad and relevant research were merged, reducing irrelevant results. The first group included the keywords “echo chamber” and “filter bubble”. The keywords of group one are presented in Figure 2.\n\nTo keep the review focused, terms like “selective exposure”, “content exposure”, “recommendation algorithms” were not included. Using these keywords for searches resulted in more than 10,000 results.\n\nThe second group of keywords, presented in Figure 3, exclusively contained all keywords related to social media platforms. Both main groups included the same keywords in English and German (Two studies in German) . The second group included names of the most used social media platforms as of April 2024 (We Are Social et al., 2024). This inclusion guaranteed that individual studies on specific platforms were taken into account. To avoid a search query that was too restricted, keywords were searched for in both titles and abstracts.\n\n2.2. Databases\n\nAfter reviewing the most-used databases for computer science (Silva and Neiva, 2016) and social science, the following databases were chosen: Web of Science, Scopus, ACM, IEEE, Google Scholar, DBLP.\n\nAlthough Google Scholar doesn’t have a main search system to compile research, it offers extensive coverage and serves as a comprehensive collection of scientific knowledge, including a large amount of grey literature - which refers to literature outside traditional publishing sources, such as dissertations, reports, and pre-prints (Mahood et al., 2014). This can help counteract publication bias (Haddaway et al., 2015). While we only include peer-reviewed literature in our review, adding Google Scholar articles has expanded our sources.\n\nSearch precision for systematic searches in Google Scholar is much lower than one percent(Boeker et al., 2013). For our query, Google Scholar returned 20,000 results. Therefore, Google Scholar was only used as a supplemental database, and its search query results were trimmed to the point at which they were deemed adequate to discover the most precise amount of relevant literature for a systematic review, which is the first 200-300 results, according to Haddaway et al. (2015). Thus, the first 300 results were included.\n\n2.3. Search Results\n\nDatabase searches yielded a total of 1,651 results. Each source’s bibliographic information and abstract were downloaded into a single Citavi library . Citavi was used to remove duplicates during the inclusion and exclusion process and to code papers in the screening phase. 514 duplicates were removed. Furthermore, only peer-reviewed work was included as justified in section 2.4. This selection resulted in 996 unique publications that were then screened for eligibility.\n\n2.4. Identification and Screening scope\n\n2.4.1. Peer-reviewed Work and Publication Bias\n\nThe likelihood of publication bias is one of the possible drawbacks of systematic reviews (Biondi-Zoccai et al., 2011). The tendency of researchers, reviewers, and editors to submit or accept articles for publication based on the direction or intensity of the study findings is known as publication bias. Consequently, journals may only publish data that reveal a substantial finding upsetting the findings balance in favor of positive results (Dickersin, 1990). This can impact systematic reviews that only include peer-reviewed papers to reduce research volume and potential small-study biases. However, retrieving unpublished trial data takes considerable time and work and is not always accurate.\n\nAlthough this method can provide important supplementary information for individuals reviewing published literature, it is not very effective at preventing publication bias Dickersin (1990). Considering publication bias, it is conceivable that scientific papers with negative results concerning the echo chamber hypothesis or echo chamber effects may have more difficulties in becoming published than the other way around. In this respect, this work also significantly emphasizes negative results.\n\n2.4.2. Other Potential Biases in Systematic Reviews\n\nThis part briefly discusses potential biases affecting systematic reviews in general, specifically this systematic review. Location bias refers to the publication of research findings in journals with varying accessibility and levels of indexing in standard databases, which can impact systematic reviews due to authors’ inability to access all published studies. For this systematic review, we excluded studies that were inaccessible through the Berlin University research access, affecting 42 studies.\n\nLanguage bias occurs when research findings are published in a specific language based on the type and direction of the results. In this review, keywords were only provided in English or German, which led to a minimal amount of studies that were outside of English or German. As we also did not include them in our review, a language bias is possible in our review. However, this bias can be limited due to the large corpus size. However, this bias must be taken into account, especially with regard to results relating to certain countries and results relating to research in the global South.\n\nOutcome reporting bias involves selectively reporting some outcomes while omitting others based on the kind and direction of the findings (Drucker et al., 2016). Outcome reporting and citation bias were addressed by collecting the results of all studies in a final table (see Appendix Appendix) to compensate for any omissions in the text. However, given the large corpus size, omissions in the text are unfortunately inevitable, which is why the table displays diverse methodologies, results, and conceptualizations.\n\n2.4.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\nExclusion criteria were applied in the search for evidence; the inclusion criteria were the negations of the exclusion criteria. To display the number of excluded papers per criterion in the PRISMA format, three exclusion criteria (C1-C3) are presented below and in Table 1.\n\nC1, inclusions and exclusions concerning the thematic scope\n\nAs a result of criterion C1, it is evident that publications containing research on the properties, antecedents, and effects was included in the review. Additionally, if synonyms such as selective exposure or content exposure are used, these were also included. Research that mentions echo chambers but has no quantitative or mixed-methods approach focusing on the properties, antecedents, or effects of echo chambers was not included.\n\nC2, inclusions and exclusions with respect to methodologies\n\nBased on the systematic review’s research questions, we focus on studies that provide echo chamber measurements in a quantitative form, whether through the use of a survey, experiment, simulation, assessment or intervention, or secondary data analysis. Thus, research methodologies such as those employing quantitative methods with observational data, surveys, mixed methods, and experiments were included in the review. Qualitative research was excluded due to the difficulty of comparing qualitative and quantitative research, which is beyond the scope of this work.\n\nC3, inclusions and exclusions in relation to the underlying medium of research\n\nThis systematic review focuses on echo chambers on social media, as the scope would be too broad otherwise, and operationalizations would be too difficult to compare. Different media, such as television and newspapers, were excluded. Research that explored characteristics of echo chambers across various types of media, if these include social media, were included.\n\n2.5. Screening of Search Results\n\nThe identification of studies and the screening process in the PRISMA 2020 format can be seen in Figure 1. The eligibility criteria were applied in a hierarchical cascade method, with each source being verified first against criterion C1, then against criterion C2, and so on. The source was included for cases in which the available information was insufficient. A total of 758 studies were screened based on title, excluding 540 studies that did not meet the three criteria. Most papers were excluded based on criterion C1. In the first coding round, we decided if an article was eligible based on its title. This step was conducted through one coder who flagged articles that are to be discussed with the second coder. We only excluded clearly out-of-scope articles, like articles on physical echo chambers (see criteria). In the subsequent coding round, articles were excluded based on abstract; 20 % of articles were coded by a second coder. The Inter-coder reliability (IRR) – an agreement between coders – turned out to be moderate, was discussed after the coding process, and coding was adjusted accordingly (Cohens’ κ=0.583𝜅0.583\\kappa=0.583italic_κ = 0.583 after adjustment ).\n\n2.6. Analysis and Synthesis\n\nThe final full-text coding followed an inductive approach to content analysis, as research on echo chambers is dispersed and inconclusive (Elo and Kyngäs, 2008). Codes were established without a preconceived theoretical framework and then grouped into categories concerning conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers, as well as findings concerning antecedents, properties, and effects (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005). After the codebook was established (see Appendix Appendix), the second coder used the scheme to independently code 12 random studies (roughly 10 % sample). Here, IRR was substantial (Cohen’s κ=0.65𝜅0.65\\kappa=0.65italic_κ = 0.65 ). We used MAXQDA for coding .\n\nTo organize the results of our synthesis, we follow a narrative synthesis approach, which is suitable to show relationships in and between different studies to identify factors that can explain differences (Popay et al., 2006). We discuss these differences by giving an overview of the type of data and datasets used and the context of the studies, such as the country. Due to the large number of studies in our final sample, we only textually describe some studies that demonstrate specific outcomes and responses to research questions. We group studies by conceptualization, methodology, and outcome.\n\n3. Results\n\nInitially, the systematic review begins with an overview and a bibliometric analysis of the corpus, detailed in Section 3.1. Following this, Section 3.2 focuses on the conceptualizations and operationalizations of echo chambers, which were developed inductively through coding and theoretical considerations grounded in measurement modeling. Finally, Section 3.4 presents a comprehensive discussion on the properties, antecedents, and effects of echo chambers.\n\n3.1. Corpus Overview\n\nThe 112 studies included in the systematic review were all published between 2014 and 2024, as Figure 4 illustrates. The year of publication was not restricted in the search query for this review. There are three possible reasons for these results. First, echo chamber as a term and a topic is relatively new, although some theoretical works were written before 2014. Second, the methodological decisions for inclusions and exclusions did not involve theoretical frameworks published before 2014. Third, before 2012, there was little research on social media and the impact of social networks on society (Snelson, 2016).\n\nFigure 6 shows the distribution of countries where the studies were conducted or in which countries the data sets originated. It indicates that the majority of the studies took place in the US (49), Italy (10), and the UK (8). These findings were expected for the US and the UK due to the presence of research institutes and the predominant language of the studies. Italy stands out due to a research group that has conducted numerous studies on echo chambers.\n\n3.2. Conceptualizations\n\nFrom the lens of measurement modeling, “echo chamber” itself is a theoretical construct. An echo chamber relates to a specific phenomenon about communities online and offline that we can observe. However, an echo chamber is not directly measurable. What we can measure are other measurable concepts that argue to be an indirect measure of echo chambers. The conceptualization is the process of defining an echo chamber through other direct measurable concepts. We identified four concepts that are part of echo chamber conceptualizations: (1) homophily, (2) content exposure, (3) user behavior like selective exposure, confirmation bias, or fear, and (4) group behavior like excluding and outsiders and collective unfriending. Another dimension in the definition and then measurement of echo chambers is the granularity of the echo chamber, meaning how granular we define and measure echo chambers. We will explore how these concepts intersect with theoretical frameworks, providing an overview of the predominant conceptualizations within the corpus.\n\n3.2.1. Content Exposure\n\nAlthough both concepts, echo chamber and filter bubble, were established due to concern that social media and other information-gathering platforms could influence people’s decisions about what they consume, what they think, and how they interact, the study field has conceptualized them in different ways. According to Pariser (2011), personalization technology is the underlying mechanism of echo chambers, and he contends that this technology will show them information that confirms their own opinions at the expense of information that challenges them. The isolation of the individual has negative effects, as it leads to epistemic bubbles where personal ideas go unchallenged and untested (Nguyen, 2020). This is why many studies put more focus on the content that an individual sees through their news feed curated by recommendation systems. We call this conceptualization content exposure.\n\n3.2.2. Homophily\n\nBoth in 2001 (Sunstein, 2001) and then again in 2017 (Sunstein, 2017), Sunstein emphasized that technology has the potential to increase fragmentation on a larger scale, with people no longer living separately but rather forming groups where those with similar ideological preferences associate exclusively with one another Studies that focus on groups, interactions, and communication between users relate to the phenomenon of individuals selecting like-minded people as communication partners and information sources (McPherson et al., 2001). This conceptualization of echo chambers that focuses more on the social structures than on media and information diet is captured by the term homophily. Research exploring homophily relies heavily on data-driven CSS methods for practical reasons. Given the logistical challenges in tracking social media interactions through surveys or broad experiments, CSS provides a viable alternative. We will present homophily operationalizations in Section 3.3.1.\n\n3.2.3. User behavior\n\nA term frequently used in the context of echo chambers is selective exposure, which is said to be one of the main antecedents and mechanisms driving echo chambers. This is based on the many choices of media environments on the Internet. Users of social media platforms can choose to be exposed to conversations with like-minded users and content that reflects their thinking, thus reinforcing their existing preferences or beliefs (Van Aelst et al., 2017; Dubois and Blank, 2018). This tendency is accompanied by the avoidance of cognitive dissonance through avoiding challenging information and is also known under the term confirmation bias. Selective exposure and other user-specific behaviors or attributes partially conceptualized by the corpus literature. These user attributes that are linked to echo chambers include – besides selective exposure – personality traits (e.g., Boulianne et al. (2020)) , fear of isolation and anger (e.g, Wollebaek et al. (2019)), openness(e.g., Matz (2021)), and reflectiveness (e.g., Mosleh et al. (2021b)). Since the focus here is on the user, echo chambers were primarily researched using surveys and experiments. The results are mixed but tend to show that echo chambers are related to certain demographics, personality trait, and selective exposure. However, the effect of these concepts is not substantial. We will discuss this in Section 3.5.2.\n\n3.2.4. Group behavior\n\nRecent philosophical debates on social epistemology have built on the work of Jamieson and Hall (2008) and approach the understanding of echo chambers differently, as they strictly separate them from epistemic bubbles. Nguyen (2020) argues that an echo chamber is “a social epistemic structure in which other relevant voices have been actively discredited,” meaning that people who do not share the opinions of that group are discredited as sources of information in general. The overall structure of echo chambers in his account is built on creating a substantial trust imbalance between members and non-members so outsiders are no longer taken seriously (Nguyen, 2020). However, such an echo chamber conceptualization is hardly reflected in the corpus, although there is research that examines particular group behavior and presents it as echo chamber-specific. This conceptualization was found in studies that analyzed collective unfriending which will be shortly presented in Section 3.5.1.\n\n3.2.5. Granularity\n\nGranularity is an essential dimension of an echo chamber operationalization. How granular are echo chambers analyzed, and from what perspective? We differentiate between single-user, group, platform, cross-platform, and holistic. While single-user studies examine whether echo chambers originate from single individuals and how the individual influences echo chambers, group studies examine specific groups on specific platforms. Platform studies generally examine an entire platform to see whether it has an affinity for echo chambers or whether echo chambers occur there. In contrast, cross-platform studies compare platforms regarding their echo chamber behavior. Holistic studies look at the entire media diet of users, i.e., not only certain social media but also newspapers, television, and other media simultaneously.\n\nMost studies examined specific groups or communities on platforms, such as climate change deniers, vaccination opponents and advocates, and Trump supporters. However, few papers looked at the specific group behavior of these groups but mainly examined homophily over time and information flow to the group as opposed to outside the group. Some research conceptualizing specific user behavior also looked at specific users on platforms and how their behavior can create echo chambers. Some papers examined entire platforms and whether they correlate with echo chambers.\n\nOnly five studies compared platforms in cross-platform studies. However, if specific platforms were researched, CSS was usually utilized as surveys mostly observed the whole media diet but not particular on specific platforms. Accordingly, a direct comparison of Cinelli et al. (2021a) of the news consumption and ties between users on Facebook and Reddit reveals that Facebook shows more segregated communities and less cross-cutting content. Significant disparities in homophilic tendencies in network structure and biases in information diffusion toward like-minded people exist across these platforms (Cinelli et al., 2021a).\n\nAt the same time, observation of the platforms studied shows that, generally, too few platforms are studied. This is related to available APIs – which could change with the DSA – but leads to the fact that not the most popular platforms were studied; most studies analyzed Twitter/X or Facebook.\n\nTwo studies on Weibo found that the retweeting mechanism on Weibo generates polarization while commenting fosters consensus and that online users’ information-seeking behavior is associated with incivility (Wang et al., 2020). Additionally, Weibo discussions about genetically modified organisms saw cross-cutting linkages between communities that could reduce the possibility of viewpoint polarization (Wang and Qian, 2021).\n\nStudies that analyzed the whole media diet of users like Dubois et al. (2020) conclude that echo chambers are either not present or are overstated. We go deeper into this research in Section 3.4.1.\n\nIn summary, Facebook, Twitter/X, and Weibo are found to have segregated communities or echo chambers on their platforms. Research on Weibo and Reddit, especially, had intriguing results. However, most of the research is to be found on Twitter/X, as the data is easily accessible. There is no evidence for echo chambers on Reddit and research that analyzes the whole media diet finds no evidence for echo chambers.\n\nThat fits the more general findings in the corpus: Reddit shows less evidence of echo chambers than Facebook. As Cinelli et al. (2021a) argue, this could be related to Reddit’s ability to allow users to customize the recommendation algorithm. Another cross-platform study found that Twitter/X users are more exposed to diverse viewpoints than Facebook users (Masip et al., 2020). The results obtained cannot be generalized to the entire dataset, and it is difficult to establish a clear pattern as there are both positive and negative findings for Twitter/X. However, Facebook was studied less and had fewer negative findings. However, this is also a result of the examined data basis. We will come back to this in Section 3.5.3.\n\n3.3. Operationalizations of Echo Chambers\n\nIn the following, we will look at the operationalizations of echo chambers. In the present corpus, data-driven CSS methods that analyze platforms via API, scraping, plug-ins, or social bots are primarily present. Furthermore, we divide operationalizations into surveys, experiments, and mixed methods. In the following, we will present general procedures for measuring the previous conceptualizations and the investigation’s granularity. The advantages and disadvantages of these operationalizations are Discussed in the discussion section (Section 5)\n\n3.3.1. Social Media Data Analysis\n\nIn the following, the general procedure of echo chamber detection and evaluation via CSS methods, used in 78 studies, will be presented.\n\nThe underlying data sets can be classified into API and scraping data, crowdsourced or donated data, and tracking data. The latter also includes sock puppet studies – bots that impersonate users to analyze platforms or algorithmic systems from the user’s perspective (Sandvig et al., 2014). They also differ in their central research focus and granularity. API and scraping studies are predominantly platform-centered, while data donations and tracking data are mainly user-centered (Jakob Ohme and Robinson, 2023). In the case of this corpus of echo chamber research, most of the data sets were API-gathered data sets (Facebook API, and the Twitter/X API back when it still offered free academic access). Some used scraping or tracking via plugins (e.g. Bing toolbar, YouGov). Most data sets were collected from digital traces of users collected on specific platforms, not donated by users.\n\nWe find another distinction between the underlying observational trace data sets for echo chamber research: purely structural data (interaction-based) and content-considering data sets. The former data sets consist of interactions between users such as ’likes,’ ’posts,’ ’comments,’ ’friendship,’ ’shares,’ etc.; the latter use the content of ’posts’ and ’comments’ to gain insights into the users political leaning, polarization, radicalism or other attributes.\n\nIn general, most CSS studies used a form of social network analysis and followed this procedure:\n\n(1)\n\nGathering social media data through an API or scraping\n\n(2)\n\nBuilding an undirected graph from this data\n\n(3)\n\nTransforming the undirected graph into a bipartite graph\n\n(4)\n\nCalculating network attributes from this bipartite graph\n\n(5)\n\nUsing community detection algorithms to detect clusters of homophilic relationships or use latent space models to find higher order dependencies between users\n\n(6)\n\nUsing a specific metric to determine a threshold t𝑡titalic_t which indicates whether there is an echo chamber/multiple echo chambers\n\nAPI and Scraping Trace data: Interaction and Content Networks\n\nThe size of the data sets varied by platform and by study as Figure 9 and Figure 10 show. Data consisted of posts, comments, likes, and other digital traces. Different amounts of users and data were used for the analysis, with interaction-based methods having the advantage that larger data sets could often be examined, whereas content-considering data sets either had to be labeled, cleaned or had to apply resource-intensive Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make sense of their data. The differences by platform could be related to the platforms’ API access restrictions. Studies that included data donated by users included additional information to the traces, but were smaller in size Data gathering periods differ among studies as well, and most of the studies look at a certain event, such as an election to investigate emerging echo chambers around that event. There were also works that examined longer time spans. An overview of interaction-based data sets and content considering data sets can be seen in Table 3.\n\nGraph construction and User attribute estimation\n\nBased on these two types of data sets, the general procedure was to build a graph for every time-dependent sample as social networks are dynamic networks (Light and Moody, 2021) and use interaction (structural data sets) or semantic networks (content-considering data sets) . In the identified studies, nodes often represent users and edges denote interactions between users and interaction of users with content such as posts or hyperlinks to news pages (e.g. (Aruguete et al., 2023)). Thus, users can be connected in a graph through edges if they are friends (e.g. (Urman, 2019)) or have shared content. At the same time, the user is connected to posts or news pages that they has shared, thus also creating a semantic network. Each user can be characterized by a vector of node attributes , such as demographic information, interests, or activity patterns. The edges can be weighted by the strength of the social tie between users, such as the frequency, intensity of interactions, or a friendship tie.\n\nSome of the content-considering data sets first transformed the network into a weighted, undirected network by computing the pairwise similarities between nodes of the same type (e.g., similarity between users based on their shared interactions with content or friendship ties). They estimated the user attributes like political leaning by calculating ideology scores or political preference based on the users attributes with an ideology score ranging from -1 (conservative) to 1 (liberal) (e.g. (Boutyline and Willer, 2017)), by shared news pages which were sorted by their political affiliation (e.g. (Aruguete et al., 2023), Bakshy et al. (2015)), averaging over user’s produced content scores with the number of posts ranging as well from −11-1- 1 to 1111 (e.g.Cinelli et al. (2021a)) or by their shared content by using sentiment analysis (e.g. (Bessi et al., 2015)).\n\nThese user-attribute estimation techniques are, as their name suggests, used to estimate user attributes, such as political leaning, based on the content they consume, share, or interact with. They enable the analysis of interactions between specific groups of attributes. User leaning was also estimated by activity in specific groups (e.g. (Cinelli et al., 2021b; Rafail and Freitas, 2019; Bessi et al., 2015)), by semantics in the posts (e.g.Cann et al. (2021); Asatani et al. (2021); Colleoni et al. (2014), calculation of political slant of visited websites by the user (Shore et al., 2018), shared news URLs with news outlets leaning score (e.g.(Bakshy et al., 2015; Cinelli et al., 2020; Del Vicario et al., 2017)).\n\nThen, some content-considering studies introduced a second set of nodes representing content items, such as posts, articles, or tweets. From that a new set of edges between users and content items is defined, such that each user is connected to the content items that they have interacted with or consumed. The resulting two-mode graph has two distinct sets of nodes, such that edges only connect nodes of different sets. This can be done by doing a monopartite or unipartite projection like Radicioni et al. (2021b) and Cann et al. (2021), by using multiple bipartite graphs (e.g. (Del Vicario et al., 2017)) or just having users connected if they interact through posts and have stronger weights depending on the strength of interactions through posts, retweets or friendship ties (e.g. (Bakshy et al., 2015)). Others just used polarization or homophily measures with the interaction network and the estimated user attributes.\n\nCommunity Detection\n\nThe next methodological step for most of the social data methods was to use a community detection algorithm, such as the Louvain algorithm , Leiden algorithm (e.g. (Asatani et al., 2021)), random walk modelling (e.g. (Aruguete et al., 2023), (Bessi et al., 2015)), greedy algorithms (e.g. (Cann et al., 2021)), latent space models (e.g. (Choi et al., 2020), Cinelli et al. (2020)), flow stability (e.g. (Bovet and Grindrod, 2022)) or hierarchical clustering algorithms (e.g. (Bastos et al., 2018)) are used in most cases of the included studies to detect communities in the bipartite graph .\n\nIn the context of the bipartite graph B𝐵Bitalic_B, these algorithms are used to detect communities of users who are more likely to interact with content items within their community than with content items outside their community. These communities can be interpreted as echo chambers, where users are exposed to information that reinforces their existing beliefs and opinions, if these communities are communities of like-minded people with similar attributes. To asses the similarity between different users in communities, different metrics are used.\n\nData-driven CSS Echo Chamber Metrics\n\nVarious metrics were used for political leaning estimation of users and correspondingly in the next step for echo chamber detection. Metrics differ based on the underlying data set: interaction-based vs. content-considering and in their granularity. As content-considering methods are used either to measure cross-cutting content exposure of users to detect content-based echo chambers or to estimate user attributes like political leaning for interaction analysis between specific groups of these attributes, metrics for both research directions differ, too. One other distinction can be made between connectionist and positional approaches, where the former concentrate on the network of connections between nodes and how they act as a pathway for diffusion, and the latter concentrate more on how patterns of relations define roles inside networks and less on how the path structure connects nodes throughout a population (Light and Moody, 2021). Thus, the following categories of metrics are obtained: interaction metrics, cross-cutting content metrics, centrality measures for node-level granularity, polarization, and homophily metrics for group and network levels.\n\nInteraction-based methods use centrality metrics. On a node level, different centrality metrics such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality can be used to capture different aspects of a node. These metrics are used to identify influential users within echo chambers (Torregrosa et al., 2020; Borgatti and Everett, 2021). Higher in-degree nodes (used by e.g. (Guarino et al., 2020) and Torregrosa et al. (2020)), for example, have a greater number of edges connecting them to adjacent nodes. In the context of echo chamber detection, this can be observed in networks such as retweet networks, where certain accounts receive a larger number of direct retweets, indicating their higher in-degree centrality (Torregrosa et al., 2020). Nodes with higher eigenvector centrality (used by Torregrosa et al. (2020)) scores are closely connected to other network members who themselves possess high eigenvector centrality scores (used by e.g. (Kratzke, 2023) and Torregrosa et al. (2020)). These nodes can be seen as authorities within the network, exerting influence over other members (Kratzke, 2023). Closeness centrality measures the distance from one node to the rest of the nodes in the network. Nodes with high closeness centrality scores are considered disseminators. They have the ability to reach all other accounts in the network more easily (Torregrosa et al., 2020). Nodes with higher betweenness centrality are crucial for the flow of information within the network. They act as bridges or intermediaries, facilitating the transfer of messages between different nodes. This is particularly interesting for the flow of misinformation and echo chamber mitigation strategies (Torregrosa et al., 2020)\n\nIn summary, centrality measures provide valuable insights into the influential nodes and support a user-based, individual analysis of echo chamber properties. However, larger structures of user interaction behavior is not obtained by centrality measures as user attributes are essential for that. Like centrality measures, modularity as a measure provides a structural perspective by capturing the organization and segregation of communities within the network, offering insights into the potential presence of echo chambers (e.g. (Kratzke, 2023)).\n\nMany content-considering studies used polarization or homophily measures (used interchangeably), whereby the individual political homophily Boutyline and Willer (2017), individual polarity (e.g. (Bakshy et al., 2015) Choi et al. (2020)) or a polarization score (Bessi et al., 2016; Brugnoli et al., 2019; Flaxman et al., 2016) was calculated . This measure was sometimes called polarity score and calculated through the distance between two users by their user attributes (e.g. (Choi et al., 2020)) if group membership could not be used.\n\nHomophily measures capture the tendency of individuals to associate or connect with others who are similar to themselves in terms of attributes, characteristics, or interests (Interian et al., [n. d.]). These measures focus on the similarity of attributes among connected nodes in a network. In our corpus echo chamber research, homophily measures, such as ideological homophily – homophily based on political leaning or ideology (e.g. (Boutyline and Willer, 2017; Asatani et al., 2021; Enjolras and Salway, 2022)) and demographic homophily – homophily based on demographic user attributes like age, gender, nation, and income – (e.g. (Srba et al., 2023)), were used to assess the extent to which individuals within echo chambers share similar ideological or demographic characteristics. Not only node-level homophily is interesting for this, but also group-level and network-level homophily (Light and Moody, 2021). Group-level homophily or group polarization can be calculated by the sum of the homophily of their group members (Interian et al., [n. d.]). Network-level homophily includes the one network (Interian et al., [n. d.]) and was used for determining homophily of a whole network (e.g.Asatani et al. (2021); Enjolras and Salway (2022)). The EI-index is related to that and calculates the difference between out-group ties and in-group ties whereby using a relative homophily measure to other groups (e.g. (Bruns, 2017; Kaiser and Rauchfleisch, 2020)). Homophily generally emphasizes the preference-based similarities between individuals and captures thereby one of the basic characteristics of echo chambers.\n\nWhile the measures can also indirectly represent structural trends in a network, homophily studies the propensity for people to connect with those who share their qualities or traits and does not directly capture the structural organization of these groups. This is why it is often combined with community detection. The strong association of homophily and polarization measures used in the corpus, especially in connection to conceptualizations of echo chambers as homophily demonstrates the importance and advantages of using homophily measures in CSS echo chamber research.\n\n3.3.2. Survey\n\nOut of all the analyzed studies, 20 were surveys. Most of these surveys were longitudinal, meaning they collected data over a period of time, whereas a few were cross-sectional. About half of the surveys were conducted in the USA (a total of 8), and only 5 of these studies addressed the echo chamber hypothesis directly. The rest of the studies examined elective exposure of social media users, news consumption and sharing behavior, extremism, and voting patterns. As Figure 7 demonstrates, most survey studies conceptualized echo chambers with content exposure. These studies mostly researched how much cross-cutting content users self-report via their media usage. User behavior survey studies researched specific user behavior that is associated with echo chambers.\n\nSelf-reported survey data sets\n\nIn both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, some surveys were conducted around election periods. This means that panels were usually surveyed before and after the elections or a three-wave panel was used. In cross-sectional studies, participants were surveyed either shortly before or after an election. The longitudinal studies are all panels that were either built around elections or drawn from existing panels such as household panels (e.g. (Burnett et al., 2022)), panels about migration (e.g. (Zerback and Kobilke, 2022)) or social media and internet panels (e.g. (Nordbrandt, 2019)).\n\nOut of all survey studies, 17 looked at general social media usage or the whole media diet, while only two looked at specific platforms. Masip et al. (2020), e.g., analyzed social media usage on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter/X, focusing on news sharing behavior in Spain. Similarly, Beam et al. (2018) examined news polarization on Facebook before and after the 2016 US elections. Interestingly, both studies found no echo chambers or polarization through social media, contrary to homophily studies.\n\n18 surveys that focused on content exposre have examined the entire media landscape and compared the content exposure of social media with other media outlets. Dubois and Blank (2018), for instance, studied the use of other media and found that social media is only one part of the users’ media diet and argued that echo chamber research has to include a wide variety of media usage.\n\nSome survey studies (n=14𝑛14n=14italic_n = 14) examine the role of user attitudes in shaping online behavior and mitigating the effects of echo chambers. For example, the study by Dubois et al. (2020) examines the effects of fact-checking, political interest, and opinion leadership on individuals’ exposure to different viewpoints and their susceptibility to echo chamber effects. Similarly, studies by Koivula et al. (2019) and Zerback and Kobilke (2022) examine the role of political activity, extreme attitudes, and interpersonal communication in reinforcing or counteracting echo chambers in online communities. Studies by Chan et al. (2019), Boulianne et al. (2020), and Neely (2021) explore how factors like internal political efficacy, personality, and social network structures influence individuals’ interactions with political content and their susceptibility to echo chamber effects. The focus is placed on user behavior and thus also conceptualized and operationalized by investigating how specific user attributes, such as political interest, change content exposure. There is little focus here on the social environment of the users but instead on what content they are exposed to with certain behaviors or specific attributes, such as fear of isolation or personality traits.\n\nMeasures\n\nSurvey research involves a broad set of measures like political engagement, media consumption, and specific topics like climate change, misinformation, COVID-19, vaccines, news dissemination, and other forms of media use such as TV and newspapers. The studies use between 5 and 41 items to gather data from a participant pool of 198 to 11052 individuals. Control variables are mainly demographics and political ideology. To evaluate the broader societal implications of echo chamber behavior, researchers use dependent variables that we group into four categories: (1) political engagement and behavior , (2) media consumption and exposure, (3) homophily and polarization measures, (4) trust in specific information and misinformation sharing. Political engagement and behavior measures include political engagement (e.g., following political news, expressing political views), social media behavior and impact (e.g., reliance on Facebook, unfriending/unfollowing due to political posts) polarization, satisfaction with democracy, political ideology, party affiliation, and affective polarization, news consumption habits (e.g., interest in hard news, news trust). Media consumption and exposure metrics include exposure to various news sources (e.g., news websites, TV news) and engagement with news, social media usage and attitudes, and perception of the public sphere, universal news access, and privacy concerns. Homophily and other echo chamber measures include like-minded discussion, perceived viewpoint diversity exposure, and cognitive attitude extremity . Trust in information and misinformation measures include trust in news sources, traditional media use for COVID-19, and vaccine hesitancy.\n\n3.3.3. Experiments\n\nTen experiments are part of the corpus. Such experiments include observing test subjects while they follow a bot that shares certain types of political content, experiments with their own newsfeeds or self-constructed platforms, or even sock puppet studies, where bots generate online content and collect what content they encounter. Most experiments focus on user behavior (e.g. (Mosleh et al., 2021b)), recommender systems’ influence on echo chamber creation (mostly through sock puppet studies like e.g. (Minh Pham et al., 2020; Whittaker et al., 2021)), on extremism and misinformation (e.g. (Wolfowicz et al., 2023)). Like surveys, these experiments used operationalizations that isolated the effects of echo chambers by controlling for variables like demographics and political ideology.\n\nFigure 11 demonstrates that most experimental studies find echo chambers. These findings point mostly to individual behavior like selective exposure, extremism, and anger. Data sets for experiments vary from 102 to 1652 users. They can be categorized into (1) sock puppet data, (2) user-centric data, and (3) trace data experiments. Sock puppet experiments (Minh Pham et al. (2020); Whittaker et al. (2021); Mosleh et al. (2021b)) used bots that mimic user behavior on Twitter/X, YouTube, and Weibo. In contrast to trace data, bots enable real-world experiments on platforms which comes with the advantage of controlled experiments but is limited to a certain number of bots and has to be ethically evaluated. Sock puppet studies used measures like the directed clustering coefficient, connection density, strong and weak co-partisanship and counter-partisanship , social attentiveness, attitude consistency, algorithmic polarization, and extremist media index. User-centric data sets were used e.g. in an eye-tracking study by Suelflow et al. (2019) which used measures like political affiliation, affective polarization, perceived polarization, contact to immigrants, and political interest. trace data experiments like the experiment by Bail et al. (2018b) measure the change of affiliation after the experiment through a survey.\n\n3.3.4. Mixed Methods\n\nSix of the included studies used a mixed methods approach. The main idea of mixed methods approaches is to have different perspectives and granularities in echo chamber research and platform research. Most mixed methods approaches studied a particular platform; some did a cross-platform analysis (e.g., Kitchens et al. (2020)). Most mixed-method studies focused either on user behavior, recommender systems’ influence on echo chamber creation (mainly through sock puppet studies), or extremism and misinformation. Most link survey data with trace data, and some link experiments or surveys with trace data. As Figure 11 suggests, mixed methods approaches have mixed results. Here again, studies using homophily as a conceptualization tend to have affirming results on the echo chamber hypothesis, and studies using context exposure tend to have negative findings. All but two mixed method studies used trace data and analyzed user groups ranging from 2000 to 42600 users (e.g., Matz (2021)). The other two studies mixed impression data with surveys (e.g., Hilbert et al. (2018)). The survey and trace data linking approaches used categories of accounts: media elite, political elite, and non-elite (Eady et al. (2019)), distinct news sites, slant dispersion, reverse Gini index, audience variety, mean slan, cross-cutting proportion (Kitchens et al. (2020)), Big Five Personality Traits (Matz (2021)), and a combination of cognitive reflection and co-follower network (Mosleh et al. (2021b)). The two studies that combined impression data and surveys used attitude polarization, anger, and emotional. valence (Hilbert et al. (2018)).\n\n3.4. Findings on Echo Chambers Properties\n\nThe following sections will present outcomes about echo chamber properties, which include results on the echo chamber hypothesis and echo chamber properties.\n\n3.4.1. Echo chamber hypothesis\n\nPositive Findings\n\nOverall, the range of outcomes in echo chamber research points to a significant divergence of findings and their evaluations by researchers. Despite this dissent, the prevailing trend in the findings leans towards the affirmation of the echo chamber hypothesis.\n\nIt has been found in multiple studies that social media activity is characterized by attitude-based homophily. These phenomena occur among segregated networks of like-minded individuals in distinct groups such as “scientific” and “conspiracy” communities ((Bessi et al., 2016), (Del Vicario et al., 2016), (Schmidt et al., 2018) (Zollo et al., 2017)), “Democrats” and “Republicans”, or groups centered around specific events like the Polish elections in 2015 (Batorski and Grzywinska, 2018), the impeachment of the Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff (Cota et al., 2019), the French presidential elections in 2017 (Gaumont et al., 2018), or the 2016 U.S. elections (Guo et al., 2020).\n\nThis association aligns with the results depicted in Figure 7 and Figure 12, which suggests a correlation between conceptualization, operationalization and outcomes of studies. Research framing echo chambers through homophily and measuring it by user interactions within specific communities frequently support the hypothesis. However, many studies concentrate on inherently polarized groups or particular events. In contrast, studies conceptualizing echo chambers as epistemic communities where users engage with a narrow spectrum of content that aligns with their beliefs often find less support for the hypothesis, presenting primarily negative results. While these definitions are associated with their respective operationalization, the trend is evident across various studies.\n\nMixed Findings, No effect or Overstated\n\n21 studies had mixed findings. They found segregated communities or tendencies for echo chambers, but only under certain limitations, assumptions, or in partial communities.\n\nThese studies found segregated communities in the Catalan parliamentary relations network on Twitter/X but not in the retweet network (Del Valle and Borge Bravo, 2018), on specific events where users tend to group themselves around authority hubs (Guarino et al., 2020), in the Hungarian Twitter/X follower-followee network but not in the Polish one (Matuszewski, 2019), and in the Subreddit on the Men’s Rights Movement Online (Rafail and Freitas, 2019).\n\nFor example, Flaxman et al. (2016) find that individuals tend to engage with publications that align closely with their ideologies. Interestingly, despite this, there is a somewhat counterintuitive discovery that these echo chambers are linked to increased exposure to opposing viewpoints and mirror offline reading habits. As a result, this research presents evidence supporting both sides of the debate on echo chambers, emphasizing that the observed effects are relatively modest in magnitude.\n\nOthers find that specific platforms tend to show echo chambers. Kitchens et al. (2020) have found that increased Facebook usage is connected with higher information source variety and a move toward more partisan news sites; increased Reddit use is associated with increased diversity and a shift toward more moderate sites. Increased Twitter/X usage is only associated with little to no change in either (Kitchens et al., 2020). Nikolov et al. (2019) found that popularity and homogeneity bias occur in all Internet activities, but they vary greatly depending on the platform used to be exposed to content (Nikolov et al., 2019).\n\nDubois et al. (2020) found that political involvement and media variety reduce the risk of being in an echo chamber. They find that the amount of media a person consumes is anti-proportional to their chance of being trapped in an echo chamber. Users who consume more media are less likely to become members of an echo chamber. However, Dubois et al. (2020) found only minimal indication of echo chambers when examining the complete multi-media environment (Dubois et al., 2020). Justwan et al. (2018) found a small echo chamber effect for Republicans, but none for Democrats in their survey in the aftermath of the 2016 US election (Justwan et al., 2018).\n\nNegative Findings\n\n23 studies found no evidence of echo chambers and rejected the echo chamber hypothesis. Beam et al. (2018) found no evidence of echo chambers on Facebook. Users of Facebook news who were less polarized after the initial wave of data collection were more likely to depolarize further due to less cross-partisan exposure (Beam et al., 2018). Accordingly, Eady et al. (2019) found that ideological distributions of media accounts followed by the most liberal and conservative quintiles showed more significant overlap than separation. Like Barbera et al. (2015) they find that social media could expose users to the content of weak ties and thereby diversify their exposure(Eady et al., 2019). Nordbrandt (2019) found that if a user begins to use social media, their usage does not impact their level of affective polarization, which is dependent on their sympathy for specific parties over time. Interestingly, affective polarization affects social media usage depending on the history of previous usage of social media (Nordbrandt, 2019).\n\nDubois and Blank (2018) found that the amount of media a person chooses to include in their routine is proportional to their risk of getting trapped in an echo chamber. Having varied media allows exposure to various information and viewpoints. Thus, Dubois and Blank (2018) found no evidence of echo chambers when they analyzed politically interested users (Dubois and Blank, 2018). Bail et al. (2018a)’s found that social media consumption increases exposure to non-partisan content.\n\nMost of the studies that reject the echo chamber hypothesis have analyzed cross-cutting content and conceptualized echo chambers as content exposure. Thus, there is little evidence for content exposure on social media; communities where users are only exposed to a few cross-cutting contents, often called filter bubbles, do not emerge as users are exposed to a broad media environment. However, echo chambers seem to be associated with political interest and activity.\n\n3.4.2. User Engagement and Echo Chambers\n\nThe papers that examine echo chambers report various additional effects and properties of echo chambers alongside their findings on the echo chamber hypothesis. In connection with the echo chamber hypothesis, it was found that the more active a user is on social media, the more likely they are to be in like-minded or partisan groups. This observation occurs in a variety of research papers. It suggests that social networks have a compelling feature wherein the loudest and most present voice usually gets heard the most. However, research must be cautious about active users, who are the ones who engage on the platform significantly often. If research studies restrict their studies to active users, it can lead to biases. In the following, we will briefly present research concerning echo chambers on active and core users, who are influential users in the network.\n\nAruguete et al. (2023) showed that ideological congruence and issue salience correlate; users on the left and right of the political spectrum are more politically engaged about topics and more inclined to share news consistent with their ideologies. This may explain why users with extreme ideologies are overrepresented in observational trace data and may lead to biases when observing the polarization of platforms. Fitting with the active users who are more prone to be in echo chambers, core users have been found to have specific characteristics in contrast to peripheral users (Shore et al., 2018). Core users are active users who are densely connected to other users by communication or friendship ties, whereas peripheral users are less densely connected. Guarino et al. (2020) call these nodes hub and authority nodes. They are said to play an essential role in the development of echo chambers, and it has been discovered that core users are more likely to participate in the early stages of the information cascade (Asatani et al., 2021) . This could be a decision in a social network like “liking a post” which influences the virality of that post. Thus, core users are more influential in producing viral posts than peripheral users (Del Vicario et al., 2016). Furthermore, early user involvement with information is a reliable indicator of favored community affiliation and, thus, the creation of echo chambers (Bessi et al., 2016). The relationship between these users and top influencers raises the potential that the latter group’s radical beliefs impact the whole community (Asatani et al., 2021). Furthermore, in several works, the initial connections and initial content of the networks shown by recommendation systems were found to be essential for further graph progression and the further embedding of the user in specific subgroups of the social network ((Radicioni et al., 2021b), (Perra and Rocha, 2019), (Taylor et al., 2018), (Evans and Fu, 2018)). In summary, a few very dense connected users were found to have a significant influence on the emergence of echo chambers, and the initial conditions of a network and the initialization of information cascades are essential for further network change and behavior.\n\n3.5. Antecedents of echo chambers\n\nThe following will present outcomes about echo chamber antecedents, such as certain groups and user behavior, selective exposure, content moderation and recommender systems, as well as polarization and fragmentation.\n\n3.5.1. Group behavior\n\nWe have introduced group behavior as a conceptualization for echo chambers. According to this, certain group behaviors or attributes are responsible for or define the existence of echo chambers. A few studies (n=10𝑛10n=10italic_n = 10) have looked at how certain group behaviors, such as discrediting other people and groups , contribute to the emergence of echo chambers and polarisation. We will take a brief look at some of these studies. They are operationalized through avoidance, unfriending, affective polarisation, discreditation, and silencing .\n\nNeely (2021) provides some insight into how individual political leanings and perceptions of information credibility influence avoidance behaviors on social media platforms. They demonstrate a correlation between reliance on social media for political content and the tendency towards politically motivated unfriending, notably through the discreditation of opposing views. Particularly during the polarized atmosphere of the 2020 U.S. election, such behaviors were observed more frequently among Republicans, potentially due to their heightened engagement with social media for political information. Despite partisan affiliation not being a direct predictor of avoidance, a significant relationship was found between intensity of partisanship and the likelihood of engaging in avoidance behaviors. Accordingly, Powers et al. (2019) notes that college students often view the expression of political opinions online as a potential threat to their civic identity, leading to a reticence in sharing personal political views. This tendency to self-censor is rooted in a desire to avoid conflict within ideologically congruent social networks, indicating a strategic approach to maintaining social harmony.\n\nConversely, Beam et al. (2018) observes an increased exposure to counter-attitudinal news among Facebook users seeking news, suggesting a potential pathway to depolarization on social media. This contrasts the anticipated effect of consonant news exposure, which was expected to amplify affective polarization but did not manifest as such.Burnett et al. (2022) applies the spiral of silence theory to social media, suggesting that the platform dynamics might invert traditional silencing mechanisms, leading to a vocal minority overshadowing the silent majority. This study underscores significant ideological variances in self-censorship practices and fears of isolation, illuminating the complex interplay between political identity and the willingness to engage in public discourse.\n\nIn general, while we see a tendency here that certain groups collectively unfriend each other before elections, and these tend to be more conservative groups, few research papers have used this conceptualization of echo chambers, and few have examined them as antecedents.\n\n3.5.2. User Attributes and behavior\n\nSeveral studies find user behavior an important factor contributing to echo chambers, as illustrated in Figure 12. Researchers have investigated this mechanism and identified selective exposure as a major cause of echo chambers. However, it remains unclear how selective exposure and recommendation systems interact with each other, given that previous studies have focused on one or the other. Interestingly, despite selective exposure, many users still choose various media. This can even amplify the echo chamber effect since exposure to counter-opinions may reinforce one’s own opinion when combined with anger and discreditation. Consequently, some studies analyzed demographics, emotions, and personality traits as antecedents of echo chambers.\n\nFor example,Barbera et al. (2015)’s study finds liberals are more likely to engage in cross-ideological interactions on social media platforms than conservatives. Bodo et al. (2019) introduces the concept of producer-focused news personalization, highlighting a demographic divide where younger, less educated users are less exposed to non-personalized news content and show minimal concern for news diversity. This underscores the role of personalization algorithms in shaping news consumption patterns, potentially contributing to the echo chamber effect. Chan et al. (2019) and Dubois et al. (2020) further discuss the role of political efficacy and interest, noting that media diversity and political interest correlate with a reduced likelihood of being in an echo chamber. These findings suggest that political engagement and exposure to a broad spectrum of media can reduce the risk of falling into echo chambers.\n\nMatz (2021); Boulianne and Koc-Michalska (2022) analyze personality traits as antecedents of echo chambers, finding that openness to experience and extraversion are associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in political discourse and encountering diverse viewpoints. Conversely, those who are older, less educated, introverted, and conscientious may be more prone to participating in like-minded discussions, indicating that personality and demographics predict engagement in political talk across both online and offline settings. This suggests that echo chambers are not solely the product of ideological segregation but are significantly influenced by individual differences in personality and social behaviors.\n\nThus, some studies find that users are responsible for choosing the content that corresponds most with their own opinions, demonstrating selective exposure or confirmation bias. Alternatively, some studies find that personality, demographics, and party-affiliation are correlated with a user being in an echo chamber.\n\n3.5.3. Content Moderation and Recommender Systems\n\nMuch of the theoretical research suggests that content moderation and recommender systems are the main drivers of echo chambers, and particularly as conceptualized as content exposure. Especially, Pariser (2011) claims that recommender systems could be responsible for reduced content exposure and increasing opinion polarization. However, while only 23 studies in the corpus have explored the relationship between recommender systems and echo chambers, research still needs to examine the connection between content moderation and echo chambers. It is worth noting that social media platforms rely heavily on both content moderation and recommender systems to shape the content users interact with online. Given this, it is surprising that the link between content moderation and echo chambers has not been researched. This is, however, related to the lack of research access to content moderation practices Hartmann et al. (2024); Gorwa et al. (2020).\n\nWe will briefly discuss the research on recommender systems.\n\nFirst, as mentioned earlier in the section on granularity, self-adjustable algorithmic recommendation systems have been found to reduce echo chamber effects and polarization in Reddit networks this indicates the influence of recommendation systems and providing a rare opportunity to observe and test the impact of changes in recommendation algorithms live on a social network. For example, during the 2016 elections, Morales et al. (2021) concluded that echo chambers are not present on Reddit because they did not observe homophilic behavior or polarization. They suggest that this may be due to the possibility for users to adjust the recommendation algorithm. Moreover, in a direct comparison of news consumption on Facebook and Reddit by Cinelli et al. (2021a), significant disparities were found across platforms regarding homophilic tendencies in network structure and biases in information diffusion toward like-minded people.\n\nAccordingly, Whittaker et al. (2021) observed that an account mainly engaged with far-right materials was twice as likely to be shown extreme content and 1.3 times more likely to be suggested fringe content on YouTube. When consumers connect with far-right content on YouTube, it is magnified to them in the future. On the other hand, Reddit’s recommendation algorithm does not appear to promote extreme content. Thus, the differences in the recommendation systems of Reddit and YouTube suggest that there is indeed an influence of recommendation systems on the emergence of echo chambers (Whittaker et al., 2021).\n\nOther research has also found that the YouTube algorithm promotes echo chambers.Kaiser and Rauchfleisch (2020) and Whittaker et al. (2021) have found that the algorithm influences echo chamber formation for YouTube. Kaiser and Rauchfleisch (2020) argue that YouTube’s algorithms foster far-right communities in the US and Germany. They clarify that this does not imply that users will unquestioningly accept these recommendations, but instead that there is a risk of users being pushed into problematic isolated communities and show that there is a causal influence of echo chamber emergence on YouTube and the recommendation system (Kaiser and Rauchfleisch, 2020).\n\nFurthermore, some studies suggest that recommendation systems significantly influence a user’s initial creation of the network. This influence is significant because the nature of the initial network is essential for the overall development of the network and the creation of echo chambers as we have discussed before. Hilbert et al. (2018)’s findings imply that algorithmic recommendations are responsive to users’ initial emotions – conveyed to the algorithm in the user’s search and watch choices – and express statistically significant positive and negative effects on users.\n\nThe initial connections and initial content of the networks shown by recommendation systems are generally essential for further graph progression and embedding of the user in specific subgroups of the social network as shown by Radicioni et al. (2021b), Perra and Rocha (2019), and Taylor et al. (2018).\n\nFinally, some studies that found echo chambers to be overstated observed that recommendation systems do not significantly influence the creation of echo chambers. Correspondingly, Donkers and Ziegler (2021) found that randomly selected users and tweets can assist in breaking down echo chamber boundaries. However, they also find that bridging between communities becomes noticeably more difficult when there is pre-emptive skepticism of external sources, as it was described by discreditation.\n\nIn general, it is not easy to assess the degree of responsibility of recommendation algorithms on the emergence of echo chambers. Most studies find that they are responsible; others see echo chambers’ causes as the user’s confirmation bias or the projected fragmentation of society on the social platform. However, direct comparisons between social platforms show differences in echo chamber formation. Reddit, which has a user-modifiable recommendation algorithm, shows no evidence of echo chambers. On the other hand, other platforms that do not have such features show evidence of echo chambers. Thus, there is more evidence that recommendation algorithms cause the emergence of echo chambers.\n\nThe limited access to platform data and the lack of transparency in how recommendation systems work on different platforms make it difficult to understand their effects. We anticipate that upcoming legislation provisions, such as mandatory audits and vetted researcher access, will offer new opportunities to evaluate and scrutinize the impact of recommendation algorithms on the creation of echo chambers. It will also be beneficial to compare platforms and study a variety of them, especially since most platforms have closed their APIs. We suggest that researchers conduct cross-platform studies, compare platforms with similar research methods, and use mixed-methods approaches to understand how recommendation algorithms affect the creation of echo chambers.\n\n3.5.4. Polarization and Fragmentation of the Public Sphere\n\nAlthough the echo chamber hypothesis predicts that echo chambers exist and lead to polarisation and subsequent fragmentation of society, most of the research is correlational and not causal. Thus, the direction of causation is unclear, and it could be that the polarisation and fragmentation of society are reflected on social media. Therefore, we look at research that examines these two as antecedents of echo chambers.\n\nFor example, Bright (2018) found indications that a political party’s status within the political system influences how the parties interact with technology: Bigger parties appeared to contact other organizations less frequently. Remarkably, parties who are more politically successful outside of social media are also more detached online. This is crucial because it demonstrates that online fragmentation is not only the product of individual online decisions; the offline environment also has an influence.\n\nBastos et al. (2018) found echo chambers in the Brexit campaign. Even after adjusting for highly engaged users and seasonal fluctuations, echo chamber communication remained widespread in the Brexit discussion. They identified a spatial reliance on echo-chamber communication by studying the complete network as well as out- and cross-bubble subgraphs. They separated the amount of geographic proximity related to consonant information from exposure to diverse information by separating in-, out-, and cross-bubble communication. They found a correlation between the offline and the online community. According to them, these findings cast doubt on the notion that echo chambers are solely a communication effect brought on by online conversation.\n\nNordbrandt (2019) found no support for the hypothesis that social media use contributes to the level of affective polarization. Instead, Nordbrandt (2019)’s results support the idea that the level of affective polarization affects subsequent use of social media. The results also revealed heterogeneous patterns among individuals, depending on their previous social media usage and across different social media platforms. This study calls into question the predominating assumption of the other research that social media is a significant driver of societal polarization.\n\nSome studies show tendencies that offline communities also influence the network topology of online networks. However, the extent of this influence has been under-researched. These considerations have not been integrated enough and should be given more attention in the future.\n\n3.6. Effects of echo chambers\n\nThe following sections will present outcomes about echo chamber effects, such as polarization, belief and proliferation of misinformation, and extremism.\n\n3.6.1. Polarization and Fragmentation of the public sphere\n\nFigure 12 presents the number of papers that affirm an effect of echo chambers. We see that nearly a third of the included studies find polarization to be associated with echo chambers. We discussed the problem of directions of associations. However, most studies only analyzed the direction of echo chambers, increasing polarization and increased fragmentation – as the echo chamber hypothesis claims. Polarization is a phenomenon where individuals with similar beliefs tend to agree stronger. At the same time, individuals identified with groups with contrary beliefs tend to disagree more deeply (Interian et al., [n. d.]).\n\nMost research operationalized the analysis for the effect by observing specific communities that have opposing views on a political case or agenda with CSS and observing if the polarization increases with increased social media use. Polarization is mainly measured as the distance between mean political leanings in these communities. However, other operationalizations include affective polarization (operationalized through surveys and experiments), bimodality coefficients, and various polarization metrics related to homophily. Fragmentation was measured through the size and density of communities when the whole platform was observed. However, fragmentation—contrary to polarization—is understudied in the corpus. The results of these studies are similar to those discussed in the section on the echo chamber hypothesis. Although various studies suggest that polarization could be caused by other media or factors other than social media, most studies find that polarization and fragmentation of society are effects of echo chambers present on social media. Thus, real-world polarization on topics is, to a certain extent, caused by the emergence of echo chambers online. However, most of the corpus research did not study the association’s causal direction.\n\n3.6.2. Misinformation\n\nA theme often discussed in connection with echo chambers is misinformation. 23 corpus works touch upon the belief or spread of misinformation as an effect of echo chambers, and seven specifically focus on misinformation concerning echo chambers.\n\nOne of the most influential studies regarding the relationship between echo chambers and spread in misinformation is that of Del Vicario et al. (2016). The authors argue that for two groups of Facebook pages, “conspiracy” and “scientific”, users tended to select and distribute content related to a single narrative while ignoring the rest. Although the echo chamber hypothesis was not the primary emphasis of the study, the authors make a significant attempt to demonstrate that homopgily is the primary driver of the spread of content. According to the authors, polarization and echo chambers are these communities’ root causes of misinformation. An intriguing finding is that the cascade for both clusters peaks in the first two hours, indicating that the start of information cascades is critical for developing opinion clusters (Del Vicario et al., 2016).\n\nAs discussed in the section on active users, specific hub nodes are pivotal in disseminating information within networks, influencing the emergence of echo chambers (Asatani et al., 2021). Here, a solid connection between the emergence of echo chambers and the spread of misinformation can be found. Choi et al. (2020) find that a few very well-connected users are responsible for a lot of the misinformation spread and the creation of echo chambers. Ten percent of the hub communities are responsible for 36 % of retweets of misinformation. These results, combined with the finding that the beginning of a misinformation cascade is critical for the development of opinion clusters (Del Vicario et al., 2016), allow an essential insight into the relationship between echo chambers and misinformation. It is necessary to analyze and understand only specific users and communities with similar attributes and strong network connections to comprehend the spread of particular misinformation. This awareness has already been implemented by various organizations concerned with understanding radical right-wing and conspiracy ideological misinformation on the Internet and its dissemination.\n\nIn addition, Schmidt et al. (2020) have shown the connection of anti-vaccination communities to misinformation as a result of user consumption behaviors as well as the fact that users are highly polarized; that is, the majority of users exclusively consume and generate content that is either pro or anti vaccinations (Schmidt et al., 2020). This topic has received general interest since the emergence of COVID-19 and has produced many studies about misinformation and echo chambers.\n\nTo summarize the corpus literature on misinformation, spreading false information is closely related to the formation of echo chambers. The influential and highly connected users mentioned earlier, who are key factors in the emergence of these echo chambers, also have a hand in creating and spreading misinformation. It is, therefore, imperative to give special attention to these densely connected nodes when delving into research on echo chambers and misinformation.\n\n3.6.3. Populism and Extremism\n\nFourteen studies analyzed the relationship between extremism and echo chambers. The results of these studies are examined briefly below. In a study by Wolfowicz et al. (2023), survey data was collected from Facebook users who had never used Twitter/X in 2019. The study also analyzed trace data from ego-centric network of Twitter/X to analyze the effects on the justification for suicide bombings. The results indicate new Twitter/X users are more likely to receive recommendations and ideas from celebrities, organizations, influencers, and political personalities and groups. The Twitter/X algorithms select accounts congruent with a user’s profile and tastes, creating ”weak ties” that could increase the probability of radicalization. However, despite their ideological similarity, these profiles are unlikely to reciprocate with a ”follow” and are classified as external ties at the network level. Accordingly, Torregrosa et al. (2020) find that user relevance in the network is associated with extremist content. These findings align with those on misinformation; as both topics are related, this is not unexpected.\n\nBoutyline and Willer (2017) have found that conservatives in the US tend to be more homophilic than liberals on Twitter/X and, thus, are more prone to radicalization. Their results show that the conservative homophily rates are 3.8 times higher than the liberal ones. They find a correlation between ideologically extreme individuals and homophily, as these individuals tend to be more homophilic than non-extreme users. These results suggest that homophily might provide a structural advantage to mobilizing right-wing or politically extreme groups (Boutyline and Willer, 2017). These findings are noteworthy, as they demonstrate the presence of homophily in social networks and its impact on creating echo chambers. This could potentially lead to radicalization among existing homophilic communities on social media. However, Boulianne et al. (2020) find no evidence that social media is associated with more right-wing populism but reflects the offline communities.\n\nAdditionally, a study conducted by Bright (2018) indicates that while there is considerable communication between groups with differing ideologies, there is a tendency for those who hold radical beliefs to engage in fewer conversations with individuals who hold opposing viewpoints or more moderate versions of their radical position. This might imply that the degree of conviction with which people hold opinions, rather than ideological distinctions between individuals, is the most crucial component for echo chambers (Bright, 2018).\n\nWhittaker et al. (2021) use sock puppet accounts to analyze the recommendation systems of three online platforms in their interaction with far-right content. The findings reveal that YouTube’s algorithm amplifies extreme and fringe content, while Reddit and Gab’s algorithms do not. The study also highlights the lack of policy instruments for dealing with algorithmic amplification and emphasizes the need for more transparency in existing policies. (Whittaker et al., 2021) To sum up the findings, the research corpus has established a correlation between radicalization and the phenomenon of echo chambers. Homophilic communities have been identified as key drivers of radicalization. However, causal evidence for this effect is missing and as the study by Boulianne et al. (2020) suggest the direction of association could be vice versa.\n\n4. Discussion and Limitations\n\n4.1. Discussion\n\nThe results of our systematic review indicated that different conceptualizations and operationalizations yielded varying outcomes. The majority of studies that conceptualized echo chambers as homophily - the tendency of people to engage with like-minded individuals - found that echo chambers do exist and have significant impacts on fragmentation in social media, belief and spread of misinformation, and potential for radicalization. This conceptualization was often based on e.g. friendship or follower/followee networks. Additionally, there was a trend towards more evidence supporting selective exposure as another conceptualization. On the other hand, echo chambers - which are exclusive spaces with the omission of external voices - produced mixed results, and content exposure studies related to surveys predominantly found no evidence for echo chambers.\n\nThe studies included in this review lack evidence of content exposure echo chambers, despite studies that have conceptualized echo chambers as such. These studies have primarily focused on the amount of cross-cutting content users are exposed to and their additional media consumption. However, numerous studies have shown that cross-cutting content is still present outside of social networks and search engines. The results concerning Reddit indicate that a free choice of the functionality of the recommender system points to a reduction of echo chambers.\n\nThe findings are valuable for further research on echo chambers, their causes and effects, and for understanding topics like opinion dynamics, recommendation systems, confirmation bias, and the spread of misinformation on the internet. It’s important to note that content exposure or filter bubbles are not the primary issue, but rather the influence of homophily and specific user behavior like selecitve exposure. This understanding can lead to significant policy decisions and a deeper understanding of associations with radicalization and misinformation. While techniques like nudges or bubble-bursting techniques may not be effective for mitigating echo chambers, future research may uncover more evidence to support their use. Further research, however, is required to delve into the correlation between group behavior and echo chambers. Although Nguyen (2020) theoretical explication of echo chambers is clear and useful, there exists only little quantitative research that has implemented this definition.\n\nMoreover, the various operationlizations of echo chambers have yielded differing outcomes. The majority of CSS studies using trace data affirmed the echo chamber hypothesis, whereas surveys relying on self-reported data tend to reject them as non-existent or exaggerated. These findings are consistent with research by Terren and Borge (2021), which highlight the inherent difficulties of both methods and their connection to the concept of echo chambers. CSS studies tend to focus on homophily, while surveys typically explore content exposure and selective exposure. Experiments put group and user behavior into focus.\n\nThese distinctions also reflect the methodological limitations of each approach. Research methods have their own set of advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered. For example, CSS allows researchers to unobtrusively observe behavioral choices – of potentially non-representative groups – in the natural environment of social media over time without social-desirability bias and measurement error (Barbera et al., 2015) and is easy to access. This is true, in particular, for European researchers with the upcoming Digital Services Act in the EU and was true before API closures.\n\nSurveys have precisely these problems, also about homophily, as Boutyline and Willer (2017) show. Measures derived solely from respondents capture only perceived homophily, which may greatly exaggerate its actual levels. If studies can infer the characteristics (e.g., by content analysis or follower/followee networks) of individuals who engage in such behavior by generating valid estimates of the ideological positions of social media users, that can help researchers identify key individuals or groups that play a central role in shaping the structure of social networks and influencing the flow of information (Barbera et al., 2015) provides a powerful tool for analyzing large-scale social networks and understanding the dynamics of polarization and exposure (Kratzke, 2023) . However, homophily measures and CSS also have problems regarding methods and validity.\n\nFirst, the presence of bots in social media is a concern for trace data (Rusche, 2022), and while Gallwitz and Kreil (2021) argue that the role of social bots is overestimated, other studies (e.g. (Neudert et al., 2017)) suggest that right-wing parties may benefit from them. For example, when Twitter/X deleted millions of bots in 2017, radical right parties’ European MPs lost the most followers (SILVA and PROKSCH, 2021). One solution to this issue is the use of ML estimators for bot detection, as suggest"
