I want every Alabamian who wants a job to have one, and given the fact that we are experiencing our historic lowest unemployment ever, I say we’re doing a pretty good job. The economy is as strong as our workers are, and it is imperative that we continue to develop our workforce to meet the needs of the companies that call Alabama home,” said Governor Ivey.\n\n“The development of the workforce center perfectly aligns itself with my ‘Strong Start, Strong Finish’ education initiative to ensure that Alabamians have the opportunity to obtain skills and credentials necessary to obtain high-wage, in-demand jobs that are available in this region and to increase Alabama’s labor force participation rate. I want to commend Snead State Community College and the Alabama Community College System for today’s announcement. I appreciate the important role that Alabama’s community colleges play in workforce development efforts around the State.\n\n“Congratulations to the leadership of Marshall County for making this happen. This project is a model of what is possible when everyone works together. Snead State, the Marshall County Board of Education, and the Alabama Community College System all came together to make this possible. I look forward to breaking ground on this facility later in the year and to the thousands of future students who will be served once it’s completed.”\n\nSnead State’s Career and Technical Training Center will be an approximately 45,000-square-foot project that is expected to initially house four Career and Technical Education programs – Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration; Welding Technology; Machine Tool Technology; and Industrial Systems Technology with Additive Manufacturing. In addition, the center will have adaptable and flexible space to interchange programs as needed by the local workforce. A conference area, engineering design and 3D fabrication laboratory is also expected.\n\n“Our local business and industry have indicated through meetings that a center dedicated to training for high-demand, high-wage jobs within our community is needed, and Snead State is proud to provide what this center will be in order to accommodate those training needs,” stated Snead State President Dr. Joe Whitmore.\n\n“One of my favorite Bible verses is Proverbs 27:17, and it says, ‘As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.’ That has struck me about what we’re doing here today because it’s the perfect description of the impact this new Career and Technical Training Center is going to have on our community. When we’re talking about how iron sharpens iron, it means being accountable to one another. It’s talking about helping each other get better, helping us to sharpen who we are, so that we can perform better and be better. Because of this announcement, we are going to work together to continue to sharpen our students to have meaningful employment and to be able to contribute to the quality of life we have in our county,” said Dr. Whitmore.\n\nThe Training Center is to be located on the campus of Marshall Technical School in Guntersville, and Snead State has worked with Superintendent Dr. Cindy Wigley and the Marshall County Board of Education to secure the property along U.S. Highway 431 for the construction of the Center.\n\n“We have wanted this day for many years because we are passionate about our students making the full circle and having a direct connection to the workforce. The faculty and staff of Marshall Technical School, the Marshall County Board of Education and I could not be more excited about this project. We value our partnerships with Snead State Community College and postsecondary education. Some of the most important things we do as leaders for our students are to remove barriers, provide resources and services, and set clear pathways for success. This project does exactly that. It makes the full circle for our students,” said Dr. Wigley.\n\nThe Training Center is among various infrastructure projects to receive funding through the Public School and College Authority (PSCA) for capital improvements across Alabama’s community colleges. Governor Ivey earmarked $4 million for the construction of the Center, and Senator Clay Scofield played a critical role in keeping the plans for the Training Center at the forefront of the Governor’s mind and in securing additional funding for the project.\n\n“I’ve always said that the best projects and the most successful projects are all team efforts. This has been the best example of any team effort I’ve ever seen in my 12 years of service,” said Senator Scofield. “I truly believe this is a game changer, not just for Marshall County, but for all of our area.”\n\nThe vision for the Training Center began with Snead State’s work on the Alabama Community College System’s ASPIRE (Achieving Systemwide Potential through Increased Resources and Engagement) Initiative. ASPIRE 2030 was launched by Chancellor Baker in May 2020 to inspire community-focused strategic planning for capital improvement projects that will advance the System’s goals of improving college transfer, increasing student completion, supporting the needs of local business and industry, and achieving equity in student participation and success.\n\n“We are going to move forward in the Community College System. We already are. I’ve had to stop occasionally and remind some of our folks in the college system, that word ‘community’ is in the name of every school. Some folks have forgotten that, and unless we focus on that and carry the communities along with us, we aren’t doing our job. I knew this community was the kind of community that would support doing everything we can to touch everybody and to do what we should be doing to provide opportunities.\n\n“I enjoy talking about Snead. I enjoy telling the story, and as we move forward, we aren’t through. We’re just beginning. We have a lot to do. We are in the business of serving communities where we are located and in doing everything we can to find a way to help every citizen in that community who wants or needs us to help them. That’s our commitment. That’s our mission,” said ACCS Chancellor Jimmy H. Baker.\n\nAll 24 of the state’s community colleges engaged local public officials, community members, workforce partners, faculty, staff, and students during the ASPIRE 2030’s planning process. Completing the ASPIRE 2030 initiative allowed Snead State campus officials to pinpoint specific needs and priority jobs in the local workforce. In addition to the use of PSCA funds, ASPIRE 2030 projects will be funded through a $100 million ACCS bond issue and other ACCS and college funds.\n\nLocal business and industry officials praised the new Training Center’s development.\n\nJohn Pittard, President of AlaTrade Foods, said, “As systems become more technical, we continue to be challenged to find skilled technicians to operate and maintain equipment. We are encouraged by this opportunity and support the effort to advance current and future labor needs.”\n\n“This centralized training center would not only benefit our industry but most industries in Marshall County, in addition to the Marshall County residents,” said Mark Drummer, Vice President of Operations for Atrion Medical Products, Inc.\n\nGoodwyn, Mills and Cawood (GMC) has been selected as the architect on the project.\n\nDue to recent legislative changes to the management of construction and facilities oversight for the ACCS, a time savings of as much as six months is expected, with groundbreaking of this project occurring as early as the fall.\n\n“Give back to people who just need a chance.”\n\nThe words were spoken as a challenge to those attending a day of celebration on Monday, May 16, at Snead State Community College. Though they were inspiration to the friends, family, community supporters, and college employees in attendance, they were also the motive behind the generosity of Snead State alumni Dr. Joe and Susan Nolen Story of Florida.\n\nThe celebration honored a recent contribution by the couple in the amount of $2 million – funds that will be used in many ways, including the development of a Career and Technical Training Center located on the campus of Marshall Technical School in Guntersville.\n\nDr. and Mrs. Story attributed their success to the foundation they received at Snead State. Both came from families who couldn’t afford to pay for their children to go to college, but through Snead, the Storys received what they needed to earn their education and achieve very successful careers.\n\nDr. Story spent two years at Snead State before moving on to the University of Alabama and graduating with a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology and then earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Anesthesia from the University of Alabama in Birmingham. He eventually earned his medical doctorate (M.D.) and served as chief resident in his final year of residency with UAB.\n\nDr. Story is a highly accomplished physician, medical innovator, and serial entrepreneur. He practiced medicine for more than 30 years before he retired in 2003. The current CEO of Story Enterprises, he has participated in the development of over $3 billion in healthcare, biologics, and medical ventures. He designed and developed the internationally recognized Andrews Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine with world-renowned orthopedic surgeon James Andrews and Baptist Health Care System, serving as its founding President of Research and Education as well as Chairman of the Surgery Center. He was a partner in the development of “The Blake” award-winning assisted living and memory care facilities across the Southeast and was a founding board member in MiMedx, the largest public biologics company in the U.S. He also developed Tri-care Rehabilitation Centers, the Portofino Medical Spa (created and led the Executive Physical Program) and the Columbiana Clinical Research Company, which was recognized for national and international drug trials.\n\nMrs. Story spent 15 months at Snead and achieved two years of college credits before transferring to Auburn University and earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Engineering with a minor in Mathematics – something she did in just over two years.\n\nMrs. Story is a highly accomplished and successful leader in business, policy insights and strategy. She served as CEO and CFO of American Water Works, Inc., the largest water utility in the U.S., headquartered in New Jersey, before retiring in 2020. She was one of only 23 female CEOs of S&P 500 companies during her six-year CEO tenure. Prior to American Water, she worked for Southern Company for 31 years, starting as a nuclear power engineer for Alabama Power Company and serving in her last two jobs as President and CEO of Gulf Power Company in Pensacola and then as President and CEO of Southern Company Services in Atlanta. She currently serves on the corporate boards of Fortune 500 companies Raymond James Financial, Dominion Energy, and Newmont Corporation, and is a founding board member and current advisor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Board Advisory Council. She serves on the Moffitt Cancer Center Board of Advisors in Tampa, FL, and remains involved in Auburn University education efforts. She is a member of the Florida Council of 100 CEOs and Pensacola Bay Area Impact 100.\n\nThrough their Story Family Charitable Fund, the Storys are also co-funding partners with the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation and the American Water Foundation on the roll-out of Joyner-Kersee’s “Winning in Life” program to children in five underserved communities throughout the U.S., as well as co-funding their local community’s First Responder Emergency Fund and other charitable efforts.\n\n“Snead gave us a chance to realize our dreams and our hopes and what could be possible. As my wife and I give a little bit, we want to, in turn, give back to people who just need a chance. We also want to make Snead a bigger, greater place.\n\n“I had to work to help my single mother pay the bills. The reason I got to come to college is because (Snead) gave me a scholarship. I ran the biology lab in the (Science) building, so I had some extra spending money. They gave me a chance. I went from here to Alabama and went on to medical school, but I’ll tell you a secret. If Snead College had a medical school, I would have done medical school here. I would have done my residency here. I would have stayed here,” said Dr. Story.\n\nMrs. Story stressed the significance of the role that an education at Snead State has in helping students achieve their American dream.\n\n“We all have them. Everyone of us is where we are because of the people and the experiences that made us who we are. God has a plan for every one of our lives, and He accomplishes that plan, first of all, if we are willing to go along with that plan, but also by putting amazing people, places, and experiences in our lives that help us to get to that plan. This is all part of a plan, and Snead is such a big part of that,” said Mrs. Story.\n\nThe Storys told of the vital role Snead State played in their success, but the couple also shared the influence an education from Snead had on their families. Several members of Dr. Story’s family attended Snead, including his mother. Margaret Story began her college education after earning a GED. Eventually, she earned a Master’s Degree in Library Science and was named Marshall County “Teacher of the Year” on three different occasions.\n\nMrs. Story shared her story of her family growing up in poverty. Her father was in the military, and her mother was a waitress when they met. Her father, Tom Nolen, attended Snead State on the G.I. Bill after receiving his GED. He worked for a little more than minimum wage while taking classes and eventually earned certificates for technical training that prepared him for employment as a skilled craftsman.\n\n“As we look back at those people, events, and institutions that helped make our American dream possible, we both think about Snead and how thankful we are for the opportunities the College gave us,” said Dr. Story.\n\n“I want to thank all of you who are part of this great college. Sometimes we look at what we do every day, and we forget the significance of it. This college was established in 1898, and for 124 years, people’s lives have been changed because of you and the people who came before you. What you do is not just provide an education. You help lift people up. You help make people’s worlds bigger.”\n\nThe Storys’ generosity will make future Snead State students’ worlds bigger. For this, the College’s Administration Building bears the name Dr. Joe and Susan Story Administration Building. To honor the examples set by their parents of how a foundation for success can be built with a community college education, the College named the library in the Administration Building the Margaret Story Library, and when the new Career and Technical Training Center is completed, a training lab will bear the name of Tom Nolen.\n\n“The pride we have to name the Administration Building after the Storys is well-founded. Their stories are two that became one story that we all can be proud of. We appreciate their generosity, but more than anything, we appreciate their example and their humble nature they have in recognizing the impact community colleges can have on lives today,” said Snead State President Dr. Joe Whitmore.\n\nThe College unveiled renderings of the Administration Building that showed the addition of the Storys’ names to the front and back of the building, as well as portraits of the Storys, Margaret Story and Tom Nolen, along with proclamations honoring their achievements and generosity. The College revealed the portrait of the Storys and Margaret Story and the new lettering identifying the Margaret Story Library that will remain in the Administration Building.\n\nThe recognitions did not stop there. Boaz Mayor David Dyar presented Dr. and Mrs. Story with a key to the city and offered his appreciation to the couple for their support of the College.\n\nThe Snead State Alumni Association presented Dr. and Mrs. Story with the Alumnus and Alumna of the Year awards for 2022.\n\n“I hope that, as our students walk across our campus, as they see the Story name on the Administration Building, they will be reminded of the value of their education. As they hear your story and learn of how much you have given back to your community and to those who helped you along the way, I hope they are inspired. I hope your example shows them that the sky’s the limit when it comes to their future,” said Alumni Association President Cherri Barnard, who also serves in Snead State’s Workforce Development Department.\n\nCollege representatives were not the only ones expressing their gratitude to the Storys for their generosity. Guests attending Monday’s celebration offered their own words of appreciation.\n\n“We cannot thank you enough,” said Senate Majority Leader Clay Scofield. “I am particularly grateful and admire the fact that you chose to remember where you came from and your roots and what a special place (Snead State) is.”\n\nAlabama Community College System Board of Trustees Member Dus Rogers said, “I want to thank you, on behalf of Chancellor Jimmy Baker and the Alabama Community College System Board of Trustees. Thank you very much for your extremely generous donation to Snead State Community College. Your gift will serve as a fitting memorial to your family, and it’ll help secure the dreams and education of countless people in our area.”\n\n“Thank you for the way you’ve challenged people, and that is part of what this is really all about,” said Snead State Foundation President Frank McDaniel. “I’ve been involved with Snead for some 30 years now, and I’ve seen some things develop along the way. When we’ve had an issue in the community, I’ve seen how Snead came to the forefront to help people and give them a hand up. Now we’re just moving another step forward with the generosity of what you’ve given.”\n\nThe ACCS Board of Trustees Chairman Blake McAnaly said, “What a great story you have, having come through this institution, being a part of the community, and coming back and giving. The greatest job in the world is to be a vessel that the Lord will fill up, that you can pour out, and He will fill you up again to pour out for His Glory. Thank you both so much for what you do and for what you’ve done for this institution.”\n\nJack Hancock, the Chairman of the Snead State Foundation Investment Committee, said, “Your contribution will greatly affect the students of the present and future.”\n\nStudent achievement was the focus of the 2022 Commencement Ceremony at Snead State Community College on Thursday, May 12, in the Plunkett Wallace Gymnasium.\n\nThe ceremony began with approximately 185 out of 273 graduates walking in a processional into the gym as family, friends, guests, and Snead State faculty, staff and administrators looked on. After music performed by the Snead State Jazz Ensemble and the Commencement Choir and an invocation given by graduate and Student Government Association President Salma Santiago of Albertville, the ceremony’s focus turned to honoring the achievements of the graduates.\n\nDestiny Wiley of Altoona received the Civitan Best All-Around Student Award. The Civitan Award is presented annually to the Best All-Around Student of the graduating class. To be eligible for this award, the student must have attended Snead State Community College for at least three semesters and attained a minimum cumulative academic average of 3.0 on a four-point scale. In addition, the student should have participated in extracurricular and community activities. The student is elected by a vote of the faculty from a list of eligible graduates who are participating in the graduation ceremonies.\n\nWiley was also awarded the James B. Allen Award. The award is presented annually to the Outstanding Student of the graduating class, but this year both students were chosen. This award is a gift of the late James B. Allen, United States Senator from Alabama. To be eligible for this award, the student must have exhibited outstanding qualities of leadership and service, attained a minimum cumulative academic average of 3.5, and attended Snead State Community College for at least three semesters. Recipients are elected by a vote of the faculty from a list of eligible graduates participating in the Spring ceremony. She is the first student to receive both awards.\n\nChase Williams of Sardis City and Stephen Dean of Cleveland were recognized as this year’s members of the All-Alabama Academic Team. The All-Alabama Scholarship program is a complement to the All-USA National Academic Team Program, which is sponsored by USA Today, Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nThe President’s Award is presented annually to the full-time sophomore student in both the Academic and Technical Divisions with the highest-grade point average on the greatest number of credit hours completed at Snead State. For the technical division, the 2022 President’s Award was presented to Christopher Adam Self of Boaz. For the academic division, the 2022 President’s Award is Salma Santiago of Albertville.\n\nSnead State Community College President Dr. Joe Whitmore offered a few remarks, reminding the graduates of the questions they will face in life – from what job would they want, what college they would attend or what are the answers to the exam. The one question Dr. Whitmore spoke to was the one often asked young people – what do you want to be when you grow up?\n\n“I think we’ve been asking the wrong question. Or we have been asking the right question in the wrong way. Instead of asking, ‘what do you want to be when you grow up’, I think the question should be, ‘what do you want to do when you grow up’. Do is an action verb that signifies…a process. It signifies an activity, and it signifies being engaged in what you are doing. It’s not that you want to be a teacher. It’s that you want to teach. You don’t just want to be a nurse. You want to nurse your patients and take care of them. You don’t just want to a coach. You want to have a team so that you can impart your wisdom and your knowledge. When you say ‘what do you want to be’, that’s a consciousness that defines your character. So no matter what you want to do when you grow up, there are certain things we should all strive to be.”\n\nDr. Whitmore continued, “Be humble. Being humble minimizes arrogance and reduces pride. Being humble will enable us to continue to be teachable throughout life. It allows us to acknowledge our sin and our shortcomings in our life and base it on the life that (Jesus) Christ modeled for us. True humility is remaining teachable no matter what you think you already know.\n\n“So what do you think you want to be when you grow up? Be dependable. Being dependable is being constantly reliable and trustworthy. Do what you say you’re going to do and see it through. Continue in your commitments even if it means personal sacrifice. Be grateful. You didn’t get here by yourself. Gratitude is an attitude of being thankful, even when you don’t see all the things you have. It’s an aspect of worship, expressing to God what others have invested in your life. Never hesitate to say you’re thankful. What do you want to be when you grow up? Be honest. Honesty is the fastest way to keep a mistake from turning into a failure. Honesty and integrity are by far the most important traits and assets that you’re going to take into your chosen field. Be kind. Kindness begins in understanding that everyone is suffering at some point, and kindness doesn’t cost anything but means everything. Be happy. Hanging on to negative thoughts and feelings will do nothing but quickly drain what energy you have. You have to focus on the good that’s in your life and not let the pitfalls and failures steal your joy. You’re going to face storms, you’re going to face failures, you’re going to face grief. Find that happiness in your life.\n\n“Find your passion and give it all you’ve got, but focus more on what you want to be when you grow up because it will define who you are,” Dr. Whitmore said.\n\nStudent recognitions continued when Snead State Executive Project Director of Workforce Enhancement Dr. Greg Randall recognized the first student in the Registered Apprenticeship Program to graduate.\n\nThe program was developed the program in 2019 for students pursuing an Industrial Systems Technology pathway to earn experience in a competitive field at a competitive wage while attending college. Kevin Franco of Boaz is the first graduate in the Registered Apprenticeship Program to graduate in the history of Snead State, and he earned an Associate in Applied Science degree in Industrial Systems Technology. He served as an apprentice with AlaTrade Foods, one of the important industry partners that help to make the apprenticeship program possible. AlaTrade was the first industry partner to join the apprenticeship program.\n\nSGA Vice President Erika Duarte of Oneonta gave a benediction before the graduates exited the gym in a recessional, ending this year’s Commencement Ceremony.\n\nMembers of the Lady Parsons Softball Team as well as members of the Parson Baseball Team were presented their diplomas on Tuesday, May 10, at a special Commencement ceremony held at Snead’s ball fields. The baseball and softball graduates were unable to attend the traditional Commencement ceremony because they were traveling to compete in the NJCAA District Tournaments."
