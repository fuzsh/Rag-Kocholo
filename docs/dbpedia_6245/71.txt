Reverse123 President Thomas M. Simpson announced he will be hosting a one hour weekly radio program called “The Reverse Report” on WSBR Radio in Boca Raton, Florida. The program will focus on the latest developments in the area of reverse mortgages and will serve as a platform to educate consumers about the loans said the company.

“We’re thrilled to be joining the WSBR family” Mr. Simpson said, “they have a long tradition as South Florida’s preeminent source of financial information and we’re proud to become a part of the team.” The program’s format will include a discussion of a different reverse mortgage topic each week in an effort to better educate consumers about various aspects of these loans.

In addition, Reverse123 has recently launched a weblog where users can listen to the broadcasts and use as discussion forum for listeners. “We’re going to use our weblog, also called ‘The Reverse Report,’ to get deeper into subjects that interest our listeners. It will be a fantastic resource for anyone seeking to learn the ‘ins and outs’ of reverse mortgages” Mr. Simpson said.

The weekly program will include a guest co-host which could include attorneys, financial advisors, physicians and other professionals that are prominent in the local area.

“We’re going to find a way to tie in all of these disciplines into a discussion of various issues facing retirees” Mr. Simpson explained, “I believe the co-hosts will add a real interesting dimension to the programming. We’ll even take live questions directly from the audience. It will be a truly interactive experience.”
