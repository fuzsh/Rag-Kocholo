        "text": "A radio host who posed as a doctor and treated patients for sexual problems was released from jail Tuesday, Broward County authorities said.\n\nMarc J. Goulet did not have a medical license but treated patients at clinics around the state, Broward County officials said. The 60-year-old would examine patients, inject them with testosterone and prescribe creams to solve sexual problems, sheriff officials said.\n\nAuthorities started to investigate Goulet — the host of \"The Dr. Goulet Show\" on WSBR-AM — after the Florida Department of Health received a tip that he was operating without a license. He was arrested at his Pompano Beach office Monday after a nine-month investigation.\n\nGoulet was charged with unlicensed practice of a health care profession, operation of an unlicensed clinic, practicing medicine without a license and scheming to defraud. He was released from jail on $21,000 bail.\n\nA phone listing for Goulet could not be found. The nature of his radio show was unclear, and a telephone call to the radio station went unanswered. A telephone message left after hours for Beasley Broadcast Group Station, which owns the station, was not immediately returned."
