        "text": "My only fear is suggesting your place too often and not having any vacancies when I need another one.\n\nWe were able to relax and enjoy ourselves in the gulf, pool, and porch\n\nNever once been disappointed! We stay for a week with our friends every year!!\n\nI love the family atmosphere and the friends I've made over the years. I will continue to come for the rest of my life...\n\nI can't wait to bring my future children there!! Life long White Sands Resort vacationers.\n\nWe came for my son's wedding, and fell in love with your place. Our family required four separate rooms, each room was sparkling clean, and just the right size.\n\nThe pool was warm, beach lovely and everything was well maintained. I would never hesitate to stay with you again."
