        "text": "Thank you to our esteemed panelists, Andrew Bunker from Rocket Lab, Steven Rutgers from ARIANESPACE, and Clint Hunt from United Launch Alliance (ULA), as well as our moderator Steven Kaufman, for an interesting panel on the next generation of heavy lift launch vehicles. The discussion was equal parts lively, cordial, and productive. Thank you also to our Event Partner, Hogan Lovells, for once again hosting the event. Stay tuned for more updates regarding our July luncheon, coming soon!\n\nThe countdown begins for the highly anticipated inaugural launch of #Ariane6 from the CSG in French Guiana, ushering in a new era of heavy-lift vehicles. Yesterday, our CCO, Steven Rutgers, was invited to speak at the Washington Space Business Roundtable on a panel discussing new heavy-lift vehicles. He emphasised that Ariane 6 isn’t just a rocket, but a testament to efficiency and versatility. Designed to offer significant cost savings and flexible mission capabilities, Ariane 6 can reach any orbit while maintaining the highest standards of quality, reliability, and schedule assurance. With an impressive order book of 30 launches, its commercial viability is clear and compelling. For over 40 years, Arianespace has been a cornerstone of the U.S. space sector, trusted by nearly every major U.S. satellite operator. The epic launch of the James Webb Telescope—through a partnership between NASA, CSA and ESA—underscores this special relationship. Our commitment to excellence continues to strengthen these long-standing partnerships. Follow us on our journey to this inaugural launch.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 25, please join the Washington Space Business Roundtable for our next expert luncheon, featuring a panel of executives from several leading launch providers working on next generation capabilities. The panel will feature Clint Hunt from United Launch Alliance, Steve Rutgers from Arianespace, and an executive from Rocket Lab to be announced. The event will be held from Noon - 1:30PM at Hogan Lovells, and will be moderated by Drew Svor at Sheppard Mullin.

Thank you to our keynote speaker, Colonel Richard Kniseley, Senior Material Leader of the Space Systems Command’s Commercial Space Office, for his interesting and compelling speech, and thank you to our wonderful sponsors, QinetiQ, Astroscale, and The Aerospace Corporation, for helping make it possible. Please stay tuned for more updates on our upcoming events!\n\nPlease join the Washington Space Business Roundtable (WSBR) on Friday, May 17, from 12:00 pm – 1:30 pm (ET), for an engaging and insightful luncheon discussion with Colonel Richard Kniseley, Senior Material Leader of the Space Systems Command’s Commercial Space Office. The link to register can be found here: https://lnkd.in/eQeS2R82. As the United States’ commercial space sector innovates at breakneck speed, the Department of Defense’s and Space Force’s recently-released commercial space strategies recognize the growing imperative – and many related policy, contractual, and operational questions about – the future of private sector collaboration with the space warfighting community. At the Commercial Space Office, Col. Kniseley and his team are at the “point of the sphere” for interacting with and integrating the growing U.S. commercial space sector into our national security space architecture.\n\nWSBR was thrilled to use our STEM educational fund resources to provide a variety of supplies (glasses, arts and crafts, books) to Miner Elementary School in NE Washington, DC for their solar eclipse party! Over 70 families attended the event, and it resulted in many enthusiastic smiling faces. Big thanks to our educational chair, Shiv Patel, for executing on this great contribution!"
