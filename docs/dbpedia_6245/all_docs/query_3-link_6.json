        "text": "Launching the Next Generation of Lift: Perspectives from Providers\n\nAfter years of bottleneck in availability and capacity, the second-half of this decade may be a renaissance in space launch. Several larger, more capable, cheaper rockets – including ULA’s Vulcan, Arianespace’s Ariane 6, Rocket Lab’s Neutron, as well as several other high-profile vehicles – are now entering service or are soon slated to. With these changing dynamics, opportunities (and questions) abound regarding the impact of the next-generation of launch on the space economy.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 25, join the Washington Space Business Roundtable for our next expert luncheon – featuring a panel of executives from several leading launch providers working on next-gen capabilities: Arianespace, Rocket Lab, & United Launch Alliance. Through open discussion with our speakers, hear their views on the shifting launch market, how they’re competitively positioning their vehicles, and what the future of an evolving launch sector may hold for the broader space community.\n\nPanelists\n\nAndy Bunker\n\nVice President, Government Operations and Business Strategy, Rocket Lab\n\nAs Vice President of Government Operations and Business Strategy, Andrew Bunker is primarily responsible for the development and execution of Rocket Lab’s federal, state, and local government strategy. Mr. Bunker also plays a leading role in strengthening Rocket Lab’s engagement with industry associations. Mr. Bunker brings more than a decade of experience in legislative affairs and space regulation to the Rocket Lab team. Prior to joining Rocket Lab in November 2021, Mr. Bunker held the role of Director of Government Operations at United Launch Alliance (ULA). In this role, he was responsible for representing ULA before Congress on matters of importance to the company, including national security, civil, and commercial space. He also supported ULA’s engagement on regulatory matters before various federal agencies. Prior to working at ULA, Mr. Bunker worked for House Speaker John A. Boehner, where he served in a variety of positions supporting legislative efforts and operations on the House Floor. Mr. Bunker serves on the Boards of the Washington Space Business Roundtable and Commercial Spaceflight Federation, and holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Wake Forest University.\n\nSteven Rutgers\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Arianespace\n\nSteven Rutgers was named Arianespace’s Chief Commercial Officer in January 2023, reporting to Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Israël and joining the company’s Executive Committee.\n\nRutgers began his career in the space industry over two decades ago, working his way progressively through the ranks – initially as the international market and account manager with Inmarsat distributor Xantic in the Netherlands.\n\nHe subsequently worked in Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore with Stratos and Inmarsat, negotiating complex bids and supporting commercial development. His career has spanned the globe, from Europe to the Middle East, Asia and the Americas, where he has conducted business with multiple sectors – including satellite operators and the government, telecommunications, oil and gas, mining, logistics and fisheries industries.\n\nPrior to joining Arianespace, Rutgers was the Vice President of Sales with the IoT (Internet of Things) company Hiber, where he successfully executed deals with large customers served by the satellite industry.\n\nRutgers holds a Bachelor’s degree from the International School of Economics and Management, Rotterdam.\n\nModerated By\n\nSteve Kaufman\n\nPartner, Hogan Lovells\n\nA Corporate & Finance partner and Satellite practice co-head, Steve Kaufman uses industry knowledge and versatility to negotiate and close many types of deals globally.\n\nFor 18 of his 30 years at the firm, Steve served as outside general counsel for satellite clients, leading strategic joint ventures, “bet-the-company” contracts, financings, and M&A.\n\nWhat Steve does best: understanding complex business issues and translating them into legal documents. If a client can describe something, Steve can draft it. Working from complicated to simple, he has many times reduced a lengthy contract into a few pages of bullet points, showing the client what it needs and how to obtain it. He has even written a\n\nbusiness and financing model for parties in the form of an agreement. Many clients comment that the business guidance from Steve is as valuable as the legal advice.\n\nSteve relies on his familiarity with issues common to satellite and communications companies to give him an edge in negotiations. This experience produces extra benefits when Steve deals with specialized satellite contract terms, targeted warranties, creative covenants, use of insurance to close gaps, license and spectrum issues, and even finance and accounting matters. According to Chambers Steve Kaufman is “a real authority and somebody who will always know the answer.”\n\nRegistration closes on Thursday, June 20th at 12pm/Noon ET.\n\nThank You To Our Event Partners!\n\nTICKET POLICY"
