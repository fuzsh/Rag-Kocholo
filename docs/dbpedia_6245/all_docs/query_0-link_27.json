        "text": "D. Spencer Mallard, firm Partner, and construction law expert, was recently the featured guest on award-winning South Florida radio program Legal News and Review with Phillip Bell, which airs on\n\nWSBR 740AM in Boca Raton and directly reaches the West Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami markets.\n\nAs he recounts it, Lydecker Senior Partner Manny Diaz never would have become an attorney or pursued his passion for real estate law if it weren’t for the financial assistance he received during his first year of law school at the University of Miami.\n\n“The reality is that back then neither my family nor I had the means to pay full tuition to cover the costs of my first year as a law student,”\n\n2018 has started on a decidedly positive note for Miami-based law firm Lydecker.\n\nAs the firm achieves new growth, so too does its team of attorneys: Lydecker recently promoted nine of its legal professionals from Associate to Partner. The newly-promoted attorneys work in the firm’s Miami, Orlando and New York offices.\n\nLydecker is a Full-Service AV-rated national law firm with offices throughout New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, California and Georgia.\n\nSince its founding, Lydecker has built a distinguished history of skilled and effective legal service to its clients."
