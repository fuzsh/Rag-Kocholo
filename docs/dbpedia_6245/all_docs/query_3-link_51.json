Governor Bob McDonnell lauds Delphine Enterprise Center acquisition\n\nas “perfect example” of private sector spurring Virginia jobs\n\nWAYNESBORO, Va.—Delphine Enterprise Management, a real estate holding company operated by Allied Logistics, today announced plans that will breathe new life into a key Waynesboro industrial site, bolstering a push to lure more skilled and high-tech manufacturing jobs to Central Virginia.\n\nDelphine Enterprise Management is partnering with Legacy Group Holding Corporation, another local real estate developer, to rehabilitate the 464,000-square-foot office, warehousing and manufacturing facility on South Delphine Avenue with convenient access to I-64 and I-81, railroads and international and regional airports. The facility will be renovated to accommodate users of all sizes.\n\nFor more than 50 years, the 22-acre site, now renamed Delphine Enterprise Center, was home to carpet manufacturers Wayn-Tex LLC and later Mohawk Industries, which closed in 2010. At their height, the companies employed hundreds of area residents.\n\nGovernor Bob McDonnell commented on the deal from Richmond:\n\n“Delphine Enterprise Center is a perfect example of a private company seizing an opportunity that revives industry and holds the potential for more and better work in Waynesboro,” said McDonnell. “My administration will continue to encourage private sector investment in Waynesboro and communities like it throughout Virginia.”\n\nGreg Hitchin, Director of Economic Development for the City of Waynesboro, explained the impact of the purchase on the city:\n\n“Delphine Enterprise Center builds on our historic manufacturing foundation by finding new uses for the property and infrastructure that is already here,” Hitchin said. “It creates value where there was very little and symbolically says, ‘Waynesboro is open for business.’”\n\nAllied Logistics, which operates Delphine Enterprise Center, has a long history of revitalizing industrial sites that once served as the economic backbone for communities. Since purchasing the former General Electric and Genicom facility in Waynesboro nearly a decade ago, Allied Logistics rebranded the 340,000-square-foot building into an office, manufacturing and distribution complex known as Solutions Place. Today, Solutions Place is a thriving commercial hub for nearly fifteen new and established companies.\n\nGov. McDonnell and Virginia Secretary of Commerce Jim Cheng last year welcomed a $1.15 million expansion by PPI/Time-Zero at Solutions Place, bringing 65 new high-tech manufacturing jobs to Waynesboro.\n\n“We want to emulate the success we’ve created at Solutions Place and continue attracting high-tech manufacturing jobs in industries like defense or bioscience,” said Allied Logistics President Rebecca Polan, who manages Solutions Place and now Delphine Enterprise Center. “Right off the bat we will use Delphine Enterprise Center for warehousing, and, after some rehabilitation, we believe it will be an attractive site for a variety of businesses.”\n\nMathers Construction Team will be the property’s first tenant and will oversee the rehabilitation.\n\n“It’s great news for Waynesboro and our company, because I look at Delphine Enterprise Center and see a sleeping giant,” said David Gauldin II, Executive Vice President of Mathers Construction Team. “My father helped build this facility back in Waynesboro’s manufacturing heyday, and now I’ll get to help bring it back to life, which is a unique experience.”\n\nThe purchase will add an additional 500,000 square feet to the existing 2.5 million square feet of commercial, manufacturing and distribution buildings for Allied Logistics, which owns and manages properties in downtown Huntington, Kenova, Nitro and Parkersburg, W.Va.; Paris, Ky.; and Waynesboro and Harrisonburg, Va.\n\nPolan will be available on-site from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. today to answer questions and give media representatives the opportunity to photograph or capture footage of the space. She can be reached at 540-256-1784 or rebecca.polan@alliedlogistics.com.\n\nABOUT ALLIED LOGISTICS\n\nAllied Logistics, operated originally as Allied Warehousing Services, Inc., entered the warehousing business in 1970 when its parent company, Allied Realty Company (founded in 1922), acquired a 100,000-square-foot, multi-floor warehouse. The company has grown to operate more than 2 million square feet of public and contract warehousing with nine facilities in the central and western areas of West Virginia and western Virginia. As the company grew, Allied Logistics was created to consolidate many of the services that had preceded it, including Allied Transportation Services Company, Reo Distribution Services and Allied Processing Services.
