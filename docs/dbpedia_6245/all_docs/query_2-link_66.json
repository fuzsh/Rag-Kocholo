        "text": "Nov. 11, 1947\n\nTwo fined for shooting deer\n\nCharles W. Shields, 44, 2934 A W. Kilbourn Ave., Milwaukee and Edwin Smith, 49, Wascott, pleaded guilty in municipal court Wednesday afternoon to a charge of hunting and killing deer during the closed time and were sentenced by Judge Claude F. Cooper to each pay a fine of $50 and $4 court costs.\n\nShields and Smith were arrested by Wesley Newcomb, conservation warden, and Ed Manthei, special warden, southeast of County Trunk Highway T about two miles from Smith’s home. Newcomb said he followed the men’s tracks until he found a dead 11 point, 180-pound buck and then followed the men’s tracks to make the arrest.\n\nCity records lowest temp\n\nOld Man Winter continued to tighten his grip on northern Wisconsin as the weatherman announced that the coldest weather of the season had arrived in the state.\n\nLowest reported official temperature Tuesday was four above at Superior. The weatherman predicted partly cloudy weather Tuesday through Wednesday with snow flurries Tuesday night in the head of the lakes area.\n\nNov. 11, 1957\n\n10 driven from home here by fire\n\nTen persons in the Fred Schumacher family escaped uninjured when a 4:26 a.m. Monday fire caused an estimated $1,550 damage to their home at 2401 Missouri Ave.\n\nSuperior firemen reported that a defective chimney caused a fire which started on the first floor and spread from a wall to the attic of the two-story frame house.\n\nSix of the Schumachers' 11 children and two grandchildren were at home at the time of the blaze in addition to Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher.\n\nThe house is livable, firemen said.\n\nNov. 12, 1947\n\nVariety is keynote of museum wood carving display\n\nAttracting much attention, two exhibits were done by local woodcarvers. One is an exhibit of quaint paint carved wooden figures carved by Mr. Barstow. Other articles done by him include some primitive wooden idols and figures.\n\nThe other local exhibitor, showing some of his work for the first time at the museum, Albini St. Marie is well known for the extent and perfectness of his work. He has been doing wood carving for the past 18 years. His home is filled with cases of his most prized and unusual pieces, but he has never before shown them outside of his home. Most of his work was too delicate to be moved, but he chose a few pieces to exhibit at the museum. In his selection is a group of farm implements. They include an old grindstone, a wheelbarrow, a small sleigh, a prancing horse and a watchdog.\n\nFrozen iron ore slows loading operations\n\nOre-loading at the Head of the Lakes has been slowed considerably as a result of steaming operations made necessary by the cold weather before ore cars can dump their contests into the holds of waiting ships. Here train-loads of ore jam the Great Northern yards while steampipes thaw out their loads. In addition to the regular steaming plant, a half-dozen locomotives are being utilized to provide steam for thawing out the frozen iron ore so that it can be dropped from the railroad car through the loading chutes of the dock.\n\nNov. 12, 1957\n\nA.T. Bingham dies at 90\n\nAlbert T. Bingham, 90, 1717 Hammond Ave., retired pioneer hardware dealer and resident of Superior 68 years, died at his home Monday night of a lingering illness.\n\nBorn in Friendship, Wis., June 13, 1867, Mr. Bingham came to Superior in 1889 and opened a roofing and cornice business at 522 Ogden Ave. in partnership with his brother, the late J.F. Bingham. In May 1893, the Bingham brothers bought the Solle Hardware at the corner of Fifth and Tower Ave., where they operated until 1899 when they moved to 716 Tower Ave. and added hardware to their stock.
