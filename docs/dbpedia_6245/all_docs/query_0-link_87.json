The main topic of discussion is about CLRI’s subsidiary VoiceInterop, Inc. signing a “Definitive Agreement” for the acquisition of the assets and intellectual property of CanniPlus Global, Inc., a Florida based medical CBD company.\n\nReid states, “At 12 noon, today - Thursday, April 26, 2018, I will be appearing LIVE in studio on 740 AM, 103.9 FM, and 96.9 FM to discuss the CanniPlus Transaction. I will be interviewed by longtime radio show host Mick Bazsuly. His show will be broadcast all around South Florida as well as worldwide on www.wsbrradio.com and filmed on AMP2.TV. Questions may be submitted prior to the show to mickespn@aol.com and will be asked on air. The show will be viewable at www.youtube.com under the Mick Bazsuly Show.”\n\nThe closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement is conditioned on VoiceInterop’s business being spun-off from Cleartronic in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2018. VoiceInterop will file a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC to register the shares being distributed to Cleartronic shareholders and the shares being issued to the shareholders of CanniPlus Global, Inc. VoiceInterop also intends to register its common stock under the Exchange Act.\n\nLarry Reid, President of VoiceInterop stated, “We are extremely excited to enter the medical Cannabidiol (“CBD”) marketplace. Numerous studies and recent news articles show that CBD use is increasing worldwide and the timing of our entry into this market space could not be better.”\n\n“Prior to our acquisition of the assets and IP, CanniPlus launched a new line of CBD products. In addition, CanniPlus signed exclusive consulting and distribution agreements with Florida based Medical Marijuana Consulting Group (”MMCG”) and HL Medical, Inc.” said Reid. “MMCG has five retail locations in South Florida where they assist with the application process for clients seeking a State of Florida Medical Marijuana Card. HL Medical is a network of 20 clinics and 109 certified and experienced medical marijuana physicians in the State of Florida.”\n\nReid continued, “Our exclusive agreements with MMCG and HL Medical will provide consulting services and an immediate vertical distribution channel for our line of CBD tinctures, edibles and topicals. Studies suggest that CBDs may lead to relief of pain, stress, and anxiety. Our HL Medical Doctor network will provide clients with evaluations and recommendations on the use of our CBD products.”\n\nCannabidiol, also known as CBD is found throughout the seeds, stalk, and flowers of cannabis plants including hemp and marijuana. Because of the numerous medical benefits, people are continually seeking CBD products, creating a high growth market in cannabidiol consumption.\n\nAbout Cleartronic, Inc.\n\nCleartronic, Inc., a diversified holding Company, creates and acquires operating subsidiaries with the goal of manufacturing and selling products, services, and integrated systems to government agencies, business enterprises, and the general public.
