The result is the silence of the twin facilities.",

        "text": "PARKLAND, FLA. — A tragic mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine’s Day 2018 put this bucolic upscale to the far northwest of Fort Lauderdale on the map.\n\nNow, Beasley Media Group is bringing renewed attention to Parkland for a much different reason. The city wishes to build a new park, and Beasley is helping out by selling the land where three of its broadcast towers sit.\n\nFor listeners, it results in the disappearance of two AM radio stations."
