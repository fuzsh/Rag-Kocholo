D. Spencer Mallard, firm Partner, and construction law expert, was recently the featured guest on award-winning South Florida radio program Legal News and Review with Phillip Bell, which airs on

WSBR 740AM in Boca Raton and directly reaches the West Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale and Miami markets.

Lydecker is home to one of Florida’s top construction law practices, and Mallard embodies this well-earned reputation: he is one of approximately 150 Board Certified Construction Lawyers in the state of Florida (there are more than 100,000 total lawyers in Florida), allowing him to bring valuable insight and perspective to the program.

During his appearance, Mallard discussed the ins and outs of construction defect law, a practice area he specializes in and one that has taken on added prominence amidst South Florida’s ongoing building boom. There are currently thousands of residential high-rise units under construction in the tri-county area, as well as dozens of traditional residential projects under way. Mallard has earned a strong reputation across South Florida – and statewide – for capably representing the developers, contractors, subcontractors and design professionals behind these projects in a wide range of construction-related matters.
