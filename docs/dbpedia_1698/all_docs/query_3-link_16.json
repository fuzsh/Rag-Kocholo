        "text": "Born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the six individuals comprising LOGICAL NONSENSE have been a band since 1989. They began playing together in their early teens and – with no member changes – they have grown and evolved, creating a singularly unique, brutal style of hardcore. The drummer, Pat, says that being together as a band became a dominant force in their lives. He attributes their learning to play music together at such a young age to their closeness and dedication to each other and the music. Known for their fast, aggressive style, Pat says their music has progressed over the last three full-lengths (’93’s Dead Time LP on Very Small Records, Soul Pollution LP/CD), becoming heavier and lyrically and musically more personal… Back when we started, the music was more influence-driven. Soul Pollution, engineered and mixed by Neurosis’ Noah Landis, is a touch more stripped down and driving than the more recent Expand The Hive. But it’s every bit as brutal. It’s the aural equivalent of drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels, inhaling enough toxic drugs to bring down an elephant and then driving 100 miles an hours round hairpin turns with nothing but a rocky cliff and the ocean to catch you if you fall.\n\nReminiscent of bands like Extreme Noise Terror and early Napalm Death, LOGICAL’s sound has grown more and more ferocious and unrelenting with each recording. Alternative Tentacles head honcho, Jello Biafra, claims they renew my faith in the power of hardcore, and they fill the gap left by Sepultura. The lazy listener may make the incorrect assumption that heavy = metal. But there is so much more to LOGICAL’s sound and to the people who listen to them. Their sound doesn’t easily fit into a genre, a category or a classification. Pat agrees, I don’t want to be classified. I want as many people to listen to our music as possible."
