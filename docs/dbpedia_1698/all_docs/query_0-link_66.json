Track-by-track, it's an almost identical reinterpretation of their 1980 debut Incorrect Thoughts.\n\nBut before you go off all half-cocked, thinking they're pulling something over someone's eyes, understand that after years of potential (and very expensive) litigation with a label that effectively stole Incorrect Thoughts, this was the only option if they wanted to support their own efforts.\n\nThat said, Subhumans have ensured that there are absolutely no diminishing returns on Same Thoughts, Different Day, even some three decades later. With comparatively richer recording, tighter, more refined performances and a general sense of enthusiasm despite the circumstances, the disc is an anthemic, provocative and inspiring update of its predecessor.\n\nYes, there are some moments that forsake youthful vigor for craft, but in the grand context, Subhumans have effectively cleaned up their previous work, added a few treats to increase value and wound up with something entirely of its own merit. As the saying goes, even flowers have to grow from shit and STDD is in full bloom.\n\n-chartattack.com"
