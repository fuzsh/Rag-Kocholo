        "text": "Alternative Tentacles\n\nThe positive result of a dramatic tense and frustrating battle Same Thoughts Different Day finds premier Canadian punk rockers Subhumans revisiting some very familiar turf. To be concise it’s actually a complete re-recording of the band’s 1980 debut Incorrect Thoughts brought on by the gall and corrupt practices of a U.S. label that has staked a claim to that effort’s rights. Without the means (read: cash) to battle the company Subhumans opted to re-create the album in its entirety and release it as a means of bringing deserved attention to some powerful anthemic songs.\n\nIt works beautifully. Same Thoughts Different Day not only drips with the acrimony produced by such a situation but breathes new life into some strong (albeit dusty) tunes. Bold and proactive tracks such as “Firing Squad” “Model of Stupidity” and “War in the Head” are engaging sound more refined and hold just as much relevance as they did when originally penned some three decades ago. Naturally some of the youthful vigour that epitomized Incorrect Thoughts is lost due to the band’s advanced age but that is offset by its ability and wisdom. Given the reason for its existence and that it’s fleshed out with a few bonus tunes for added value one would be hard-pressed to find fault with the enthused detailed reproduction Same Thoughts Different Day provides."
