        "text": "Legal advisory from Live To Crush LLC:\n\nThe entity known as SANDRIDER, comprised of Nat Damm, Jesse Roberts and Jon Weisnewski, hereafter referred to as BAND, is declaring that BAND is releasing a 2 song single with ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES, a label that has continually championed underground music that BAND has been inspired by their whole lives. The single will contain two original songs, AVIARY and BALEEN. AVIARY looks at the online vitriol that has become an unfortunate part of our lives and ponders: “What if instead of raging at strangers on the internet, a person instead quietly drowned themselves in an isolated place?” BALEEN offers an uncontroversial opinion on whales: They are big and weird. After much work and consideration, BAND has declared the two songs sufficient for this release and in sound legal standing. Furthermore, BAND has gone on record saying that previous patrons of BAND’s music should find the content of this release “Good.”\n\nAddendum from Alternative Tentacles Records LLC:\n\nThe entity known as ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES, would like to express its excitement to be working with the Seattle, WA based BAND, and enjoyed the previous relationship of Damm and Weisnewski in their former entity known as AKIMBO. ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES is very much a fan of previous work from the BAND on Satanik Royalty Records and highly recommend new listeners investigate the discography further. The upcoming 2-song single by BAND, hereafter referred to as AVIARY/BALEEN has a limited-edition initial pressing on blue and white splatter vinyl pressing of 300 copies, and successive runs will not be as colorful. Immediate orders are encouraged.\n\nAVIARY/BALEEN was recorded by Matt Bayles (Mastodon, ISIS, The Sword) at Studio Litho & ExEx Audio October 2021. Mixed by Matt Bayles at The Red Room March 2022. Additional recording by Jeff McNulty at The Kill Room November 2021. Mastered by Ed Brooks at Resonant Mastering April 2022. Paintings by Jesse Roberts. Layout by Nat Damm. Photos by Invisible Hour.\n\nALTERNATIVE TENTACLES would like to go on record that new listeners to the work of BAND should find the content of this release “Sick as hell.”\n\n“Aviary & Baleen” is a pre-order for a limited to 300 white and blue splatter vinyl 7″ and will be available for pre-order for 1 month and then ship out in early December. All current SPREAD THE VIRUS 7″ CLUB members will automatically get a copy as part of their series of 7″s.\n\nTo automatically pre-order this 7″, sign up on our Patreon at the TENTACLE or PLAGUE tiers to automatically get each month’s 7″ pre-order.\n\nDescription\n\nJust a handful of months after releasing their meteorically heavy LP Enveletration (Satanik Royalty Records), Seattle loud-rock trio SANDRIDER has teamed up with Alternative Tentacles to release a two-song 7” in January 2024. Engineered by Matt Bayles (SOUNDGARDEN, MASTODON, BOTCH) at Seattle’s Litho Studios during the Enveletration sessions, the two tracks “AVIARY” and “BALEEN” offer a concise snapshot of what Sandrider does best: pulling together lead-heavy riffs and cathartic wails into songs that are somehow fun and infectiously catchy while also being messy and relatable angry. Much like their Seattle grunge/punk-rock predecessors, their sound is paired seamlessly with modern hopelessness as much as it is crushing beers and reading Dune.\n\nThis cheeky duality of Sandrider is also captured perfectly in the subject matter of the EP’s two tracks: The explosive first track, “Aviary,” portrays the modern hellscape of social media as sinister, soulless mama bird, willfully vomiting disinformation into the eager mouths of enthusiastically consenting participants. “PLEASE MOTHER, FEED THEM YOUR BILE. DOUSE THE BABES WITH YOUR WHOLESOME RETCH,” vocalist/guitarist Jon Weisnewski wails over massive, frenetic riffs, rounded out by bassist Jesse Roberts’ warm low end and drummer Nat Damm’s ultra-hard, punch-like beats. The song concludes in a frenzy of danceable beats, with Weisnewski doing his best Painkiller-era Halford screams as he commands you to flood the whole damn thing – drown those who wish to destroy us. As pissed off as the song is, you’ll feel triumphant by the end anyway.\n\nSide B’s “Baleen” on the other hand (while ironically the angrier-sounding song of the two), is about a lighter thought that keeps Weisnewski up at night: Do you ever think about how fucking weird whales are? They’re enormous floating creatures that can’t handle gravity, and they hang out in the deepest oceans. Yet they can’t breathe underwater, so they have to stay near the top and come up for air all the time. Seems inconvenient. And you’d think that the biggest mammal that ever lived would be a brutal carnivore, right? But no. They eat the tiniest creatures, through a bunch of hair in their mouths. What the fuck? Anyway, ponder on that while you bang your head along with Sandrider’s signature primal, hypnotizingly heavy riffs.\n\nWhile the Aviary/Baleen 7” is Sandrider’s debut for Alternative Tentacles, Weisnewski and Damm have a long history with the label, having previously been signed to AT with their former band, AKIMBO. After forming Sandrider in 2007, the band released three full-length albums and a split with KINSKI via the now-defunct Seattle label Good To Die before signing to Satanik Royalty Records for the release of 2023’s Enveletration. The trio are thrilled that they get to release records with their local Seattle friends as well as the punk-rock legends in Alternative Tentacles.\n\nWeisnewski comments:\n\n“I’m so excited to work with Alternative Tentacles again. I have so much appreciation for Jello and the label finding and investing in artists that continually push expectations. They’re often unsafe, in that they champion artists over mainstream commercial appeal, and at the same time that consistency has built a fucking amazing legacy. Sandrider is just so humbled and appreciative that they would extend the offer to us. We’re over the moon about it.”"
