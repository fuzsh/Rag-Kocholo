        "text": "The Mentally Ill were an old punk band from Deerfield during the late 70s and early 80s. They are most well-known for their legendary Gacy's Place 7\" from 1979, considered to this day to be one of the best and most forgotten records of the early Chicago punk era. They releaed the less popular Sex Cells 7\" a few years later and seemed to fade into obscurity. In the late 90s, The Mentally Ill came back and recorded a full length with Steve Albini. In 2004, Jello Biafra released the entire recording sessions of Gacy's Place plus some older demos as a CD on his Alternative Tentacles label. After they ended (or while they were still active), some members of Mentally Ill formed Men.\n\nOn November 24th, 2007 The Mentally Ill played the final set at the You Weren't There afterparty at The Beat Kitchen. It was the first time The Mentally Ill played live, 28 years after the release of Gacy's Place. Reviews of their performance was almost all positive. They opened with Tumor Boy and closed (for a second time) with Gacy's Place. On May 23rd, 2008 Mentally Ill played their 2nd show ever as part of the three day Totally Wired Festival Chicago. Since their reunion show, The Mentally Ill gets together and plays a couple shows a year.\n\nMembers\n\nSado Marquis (Larry) - Vocals\n\nSkitz Phrenic (Sven Herman) - Bass, Saxophone\n\nHans Dolittle - Guitar\n\nKlaus Trofobic (Jon Ledwith) - Guitar\n\nSpecial Ed - Drums\n\nArt MacQuilkin - Vocals on Sex Cells\n\nReggie Mars - Various instruments on Sex Cells\n\nReleases\n\nGacy's Place 7\" (Autistic Records, 1979) - 300 pressed\n\nGacy's Place\n\nPadded Cell\n\nTumor Boy\n\nSex Cells 7\" (Autistic Records & Snat 5 Records, 1982)\n\nKBD blog comment said it's not the original singer (Larry), maybe Art?\n\nAmerican Dream\n\nSoldier 19\n\nStrike the Bottom Red (1999)\n\nRecorded by Steve Albini\n\nNot officially distributed\n\nWrinkled Star\n\nSlash\n\nStrike the Bottom Red\n\nPadded Cell\n\nStalag 13\n\nSplit Crotch Straight Jacket\n\nDom & Nate\n\nBathroom Gays\n\nDoggie Sex\n\nTumor Boy\n\nPablo Picasso\n\nGacy's Place: The Undiscovered Corpses CD (Alternative Tentacles, 2004)\n\n\"Gacy's Place\" (1:28)\n\n\"Tumor Boy\" (1:35)\n\n\"Doggie Sex\" (2:00)\n\n\"Not Quite Dead Yet\" (1:46)\n\n\"Padded Cell\" (1:54)\n\n\"Split Crotch Straight Jacket\" (1:15)\n\n\"All Mixed Up\" (1:44)\n\n\"Stalag 13\" (1:54)\n\n\"Ballad of The Mentally Ill\" (2:25)\n\n\"Dry Heave\" (2:36)\n\n\"Tumor Boy\" (2:46)\n\n\"Bathroom Gaze\" (1:17)\n\n\"Cum Twat\" (2:52)\n\n\"Smelly Boys\" (2:35)\n\n\"Gacy's Place\" (2:09)\n\nI Don't Need (You're Shit)\" (2:57)\n\n\"Aryan Rock\" (1:15)\n\n\"All Mixed Up\" (2:23)\n\n\"Stalag 13\" (2:34)\n\n\"Split Crotch Straight Jacket\" (1:50)"
