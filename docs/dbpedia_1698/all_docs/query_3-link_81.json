        "text": "Of all the hotly sought-after original Killed-By-Death punk singles, few to none are as notorious – or mysterious – as the “Gacy’s Place” EP by The Mentally Ill. The sleeve, the topics, the so-horrible-it’s-amazing production values, that voice. Many in the know crown it the sickest punk record ever made. But there is more – much more. The “Gacy’s Place” sessions yielded eight songs – only three were ever released.\n\nA dig in the ol’ crawlspace turned up even cruder earlier demos with alternate versions of the EP songs, plus over half-a-dozen others, heard only by a handful of people. A true labor of man-boy love, it took Jello Biafra years to pry this loose from the band. They kept insisting each album be housed in a 3-foot wide scale model of Gacy’s house itself!\n\nNow their affliction has subsided enough so that everyone finally has a chance to save their $200 “evil-Bay” bucks and grab a whole album’s worth of mental illness before their condition comes back. “Gacy’s Place: The Undiscovered Corpses” compiles all three recording sessions by The Mentally Ill: The Starbeat Sessions, The Basement Sessions and The Crawlspace Sessions for a total of 20 tracks, nearly all previously unreleased!"
