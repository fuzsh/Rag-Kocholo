        "text": "Jelo Binarkers used to sing for the Dead Kennedys. He's a political shitmonger, so when they broke up he started doing spoken word tours and recording them. He also got together with some of his favorite artists to record some music every now and again. Here's reviews of both, Jack! No More Cocoons - Alternative Tentacles 1987.\n\nJello's first spoken word album! This is a double album that is split between scripted speeches (some strictly political, others humorously political), short soundbites of radio appearances and a 26-minute casual talk on censorship. Jello is VERY left-wing, to the point of making me question whether he might be too easily accepting everything he reads that fits his world view. In short, everything big business and Christians say is a lie, and everything that the liberal books he reads is true.\n\nQuite frankly, he's probably right! The \"facts\" he spreads in pieces like \"Mild Kingdom\" (a spoken word version of \"The Great Potshot Heard Around The World\") and \"What Reagan Didn't Know\" may very well be true. And if they are, they're FRIGHTENING. I'm not saying I believe everything he says, but it's certainly food for thought. It's good that we have people like Jello actually READING these alternative texts, letting us know about covert government goings-on that may very well have occurred.\n\nSo that political stuff, plus an uproarious piece in which Jello suggests new names for bands (\"MONDALE\"!) is the upside - and it's a big upside! He's got an interesting voice, clearly believes very fiercely in what he's saying, and is filled with punk rock charisma. On the downside, he spends way too much time addressing the way that pussy parents treat their kids, reads a bunch of random newspaper clippings, recites the words to \"Stars And Stripes Of Corruption\" and does this incredibly tasteless thing called \"Why I'm Glad The Space Shuttle Blew Up.\" He has his reasons, but for a guy who pretends to really care about people, he sure acts like a heartless bastard in this one, making fun of the kids on TV crying as their teacher died. Why? Why in life?\n\nReader Comments\n\nedm1213@msn.com (Eric Miller)\n\nThis is Jello's best spoken word album. While Become the Media and The Big Ka-Boom have some good stuff, i can't get completely into it because Jello is well, to much of a Nader-ite. I liked Nader in 2000 too, but in hindsight.... anyway this has most of Jello's best stuff, from Vietnam Never Happened to What Reagan Didn't Know, Urinalysis is Freedom, and of course Names for Bands. some of my favorites....\n\nMAGNUM JIHAD!\n\nJanitors of Anarchy\n\nSell Your Mom\n\nThe Crotch Puppets\n\nSatan's Buttermilk\n\nAryan Embarassment\n\nJohn Wayne On Acid\n\nAl Sharpton's Hair\n\nYou're Fired\n\nShut up and Buy\n\nand more.... 9 of 10 for No More Cocoons\n\nsteve.robey@mindspring.com\n\nNew Age Tranquility: Earth Fart....\n\nI always crack up at \"MONDALE!\" too.\n\nNo More Cocoons is probably Jello's most \"fun\" spoken word album, though of course there's plenty of \"serious\" political material here. I believe it was the first time I'd really been exposed to the issue of censorship in the music industry. The whole thing with the PMRC pissed me off so much back then, probably as much as the war on terrorism pisses me off nowadays. I even wrote a term paper in college that drew heavily on the \"facts\" he presents in opposition to the RIA and the PMRC. In retrospect, I probably didn't make an extraordinarily strong argument - the term paper was more of a vanity project by an unquestioning fan than a serious analysis - but the teacher either liked it or didn't give a shit, cause I got a B on the paper.\n\nAdd your thoughts? High Priest Of Harmful Matter - Tales From The Trial - Alternative Tentacles 1989.\n\nJello's second spoken word album was another double-LP, this one split between a 45-minute speech on censorship and a 45-minute recollection of his experience being taken to court on obscenity charges for the Dead Kennedys' Frankenchrist album. The first LP begins with an incredibly interesting history of censorship in rock and roll before deviating into an overall look at the PMRC and censorship in general that gets a bit tiresome after a while. I mean, it's a good speech, but not exactly \"entertaining\" on repeated listenings. The second LP, however, is an absolute gas (fart). Jello makes fun of cops, jurors and district attorneys with an uncontrollable zeal and glee (fart), and there are lots of laughs in his tale of harrassment and semi-justice (diahrrea). You'll chuckle and chuckle again, as if enjoying the antics of a delightful left-wing circus clown!\n\nReader Comments\n\nsteve.robey@mindspring.com\n\nBrain Death! Mind Death! School Damage! Straight A's!\n\nNone of which has anything to do with the second Biafra spoken word album, High Priest of Harmful Matter. Oddly enough, I didn't even see this one in stores until well after I'd gotten the black and white one with the toilet on the cover, so I always think of this as his third. For a Biafra album, this one's okay, but he already seems to be repeating himself on the censorship rants. The \"Tales from the Trial\" segment, almost half of the 2 disc set, is a real fun time though - a lighthearted slice of personal anecdotes that you rarely get with your box of Jello. And now a word about \"Love, American Death Squad Style\" - to my ears, this is 12 minutes of pretty much free-form, almost stream of consciousness verbal riffing that still doesn't make complete sense after 15 years, but I sure love to listen to it. The weird thing is that he obviously IS trying to make a point, but I'll be a squeezable shark tooth if I can figger out what it is. Is it me? For a moment?\n\nAdd your thoughts? Last Scream Of The Missing Neighbors (with D.O.A.) - Alternative Tentacles 1988.\n\nD.O.A. really sucks, so it's amazing how good this record is. It features four awesome heavy fast punk/metal originals, a sweet cover of \"We Gotta Get Out Of This Place\" and the coup de grace \"Full Metal Jackoff,\" a 14-minute trudger in which Biafra accuses the government of pumping drugs into the ghettos in a sinister plot to further racial genocide and create a state of panic so severe that martial law will be not only accepted, but welcomed. This song is considered by me and at least one other person in the world (Christian Smith) to be one of the most brilliant Biafra creations of all time. The repetitive heavy midtempo metallic guitar chugging, combined with brilliant lyrics and a frighteningly intense vocal delivery, create a mood so oppressive and maddening that the listener actually feels as if he is riding shotgun in the narrator's \"black van with no windows and a chimney puffing smoke.\" It marks a perfect conclusion to what is probably Biafra's most instantly enjoyable album since the breakup of the Dead Kennedys. The four originals are fairly similar to each other, but extremely catchy, heavy, gritty, uptempo and filled with lots more great examples of Jello's funny political lyrics, as you can tell just by looking at the song titles - \"Attack of the Peacekeepers,\" \"Wish I Was In El Salvador,\" \"Power Is Boring\" - as well as the uproariously moronic intro to the record, in which he leads a band chant of \"Gimme an M! Gimme an A! Gimme a U! Gimme an L! Gimme your money! What's that spell? Maul! What's that spell? SHOPPING MALL!!!!\"\n\nIt's really damn short at only 31 minutes, but it's also really damn good, so, as Ten Years After say in their classic rock anthem \"I'd Love To Change The World,\" \"I'll leave it up you.\"\n\nI think it was Ten Years After anyway. Who gives a shit. Fucking go-nowhere one hit wonder shit band. Might have been Spirit for all I know. Either way, the song fucking blows. Sounds like Kansas - fucking pussy art rock that thinks it's so \"serious.\" If I want \"serious\" art rock, I'll listen to a band that does it right, like Blink 182.\n\nReader Comments\n\nsteve.robey@mindspring.com\n\nDitto on your opinion of \"Full Metal Jackoff\" - I crank that one loud and often. One of his best set of lyrics too. Totally outclasses everything else on the album, not to mention everything that DOA has ever done. Speaking of - my friend lent me a DVD of DOA's farewell concert, and Jello Biafra shows up towards the end to sing \"Full Metal Jackoff\" and a couple other songs. And he's wearing shades, a trench coat, and a cheesy goatee! Which is of course what he wore in his old band, Frankie Goes to Hollywood.\n\nAdd your thoughts? I Blow Minds For A Living - Alternative Tentacles 1991.\n\nOverly self-congratulatory album title, bland spoken word album. Contains some interesting information about hemp and right-wing bigshots who somehow managed to avoid having to serve in Vietnam, as well as a hilarious personal anecdote about running for mayor and some other interesting political opinions. However, it also includes what are probably the two most humorless and strangely ineffective pieces he's ever written -- \"Pledge of Allegiance\" and \"Die For Oil, Sucker,\" two sides of a single that comes across more like a pedantic Jello Biafra parody than the real thing. Elsewhere, there's another hour's worth of mindnumbingly repetitive anti-censorship talk. Yes, there's some interesting bits of propaganda and information included here and there, but mostly it's just the same stuff he always talks about. The PMRC, the slow but sure enactment of martial law and how bad all politicians are. Which they ARE, of course, but it doesn't make for an incredibly compelling listen if you've heard his first two spoken word albums.\n\nMind you, I'm not knocking information.\n\nRather, I'm knock-knock-knocking on Heaven's door. Hey hey. Hey hey yeah.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Jello Biafra With Plainfield - Alternative Tentacles 1993.\n\nJello does not actually appear on this record - it was a hoax. A godawful band called Plainfield got a guy who sounds like Jello Biafra (sources say that it's Grux, the leader of Caroliner), and put out a little EP making fun of Jello's propaganda and punk rock reminiscences. I used to love it, and was planning to give it the highest grade on this page, but now that I'm older, I realize that it's really not nearly as brilliant as I used to think. It's basically one joke over and over, with a few great lines here and there. However, the artwork and inserts are unbelievably hilarious parodies of the typical Jello/Winston Smith newspaper cutout-type stuff.\n\nIf you can manage to find a copy, buy it. You'll laugh your ass off the first couple of times you hear it, and after that you can still enjoy the artwork and inserts. Plus there actually ARE two good songs on here - \"Eric's Throwpillow\" and the BRILLIANT \"Not Enough Sage,\" which by itself is worth the price of the album. \"Nuance of Fifty Cents\" also has some great lines, though it's musically a throwaway. The other three tracks are stupid, ruining the basic joke by setting Jello up as a transvestite murderer. Why? Because Plainfield aren't incredibly clever for the most part. I got one of their normal albums and it's just atrocious.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Prairie Home Invasion (with Mojo Nixon and the Toadliquors) - Alternative Tentacles 1993.\n\nJello tackles country western with great aplomb. His new lyrics are hilarious attacks on loser punks and limousine liberals and Mojo gets in a few good gripes too. Smart, funny, and the music is a nonstop bouncy hoedown - NOT country rock or modern Garth Brooks pop crap. Too many cover tunes though (SIX of them!!! And they're not anywhere NEAR as clever or interesting as the originals!). I can't say any more right now. My puppy is in the hospital and I'm very upset. Please pray for him to whomever you might pray to.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Beyond The Valley Of The Gift Police - Alternative Tentacles 1994.\n\nYour prayers worked!!! My Puppy is home and just as frisky and annoying as always!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!! Also, please note that I may now have prospective employers visiting this site, so no more cussing.\n\nThis is a TRIPLE-CD spoken word album, which you'd think would be unlistenable, but it's really not! Jello is SHITfilled with interesting factoids on this one, mostly about the government and religious right of course, but also about \"experts\"! (Great 30-minute segment about the failings of so-called experts). Better still is the fact that he shares lots of personal anecdotes about his runins with members of the religious right, his appearances on various talk shows and his youth growing up in the 60s and 70s. This to me is the perfect combination for a spoken word album by ANYBODY -- one part \"important\" facts that you would never think to look up on your own and one part personal stories that help show why a person is the way he is. Anybody could sit up on stage and read out of various leftwing books like Jelpo does, but he's the only who could tell the story of meeting Tipper Gore before an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show because he's the only one who lived through that particular experience of Mr. Jelpo Binarkers! So, yeah, great comeback after the disappointing I Blow Boys For A Living.\n\nHowever, it IS hard to make it through disc two (a nearly completely political speech) on repeated occasions, and the \"humorous\" piece in which he speaks from the point of view of a religious redneck who wants to \"BAN EVERYTHING!\" is just miserably annoying. And not clever at all. Shades of \"Die For Boils, Tucker! TUCKER!!!! FUCK YOU!!!!\"\n\nAnd remember my rule - no cussing. I don't want prospective employers to think that I hang around with a bunch of lowlifes.\n\nAdd your thoughts? If Evolution Is Outlawed, Only Outlaws Will Evolve - Alternative Tentacles 1998.\n\nPituitary Gland Jenkins! Hello kids, I'm Pituitary Gland Jenkins! Would you like to enjoy a delightful cola with you and yours? Let's do each other in the nerp!\n\nStop cussing, Pituitary Gland Jenkins. My future employer will refuse to pay me 65 batrillion dollars a minute as I demand on my resume, which is carved in blood on my fiancee's ass. This is another triple-spoken-word CD mostly about politics and censorhips and puch. Fit's GOOD! Actually disc one has a lot of awful overdramatic pre-written stuff on it (including a reprise of the heartless \"Why I'm Glad The Space Shuttle Blew Up\"!), but the next two discs are nonstop greed and viciousness!!!! He hates Clinton and Newt, loves Noam Chomsky and Jerry Brown (of \"California Uber Alles\" fame!). Hates the death penalty, loves artists. Hates the religious right, loves peeing into his own mouth. He has a lot to say, this Jello Biafra. He reads a lot and picks out stuff that's so creepily disenchanting, it's even more sensationalistic than the USA Today-style TV news he attacks so venemously. And it includes the hilarious mental image of \"Newt Gingrich, eyes gouged out, hanging from a tree\"! And Bello sells his triple-spoken-word CDs really cheap! Unless you buy them at HMV or Tower who'll screw ya just as soon as fuck ya up the ass.\n\nHere's a little riddle for you: Why do all these Jello CDs have so many obvious splices in them? Poor editing!\n\nMy dog pooped on the floor a few minutes ago. I'm not gonna clean it up for a few days, so you can come over and smell it if you want. Jello has a new triple-spoken-word CD out in 2001 called Become The Media that I just ordered through djangos.com. I'll review it soon! Don't get angry! I'll review it as soon as I get it! Jesus, calm down! Don't come near me with that pomeranian likc cokajr!\n\nxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nxxxxxxx xx\n\nWouldn't it have been funny if I'd actually been killed there? Ha ha indeed! Like a friend in need!\n\nAdd your thoughts? * Become The Media - Alternative Tentacles 2001. *\n\nAnother triple-spoken-word CD from Eric Boucher - and his best one for sure! The speeches are pulled from seven different locales, including a Hacker's Convention, the Green Party Presidential Nominating Convention, a Community Christian Church in Kansas City (!!!!), a \"Slam The N.A.B.\" Protest, plus clubs in Philadelphia, Toronto and Jello's hometown of Boulder, CO. In addition to a delightful variety of subject matter (The W.T.O. Protests, the Republican and Democratic Conventions, the Internet, how much broadcasters suck, etc.), you get to hear some more interesting stuff about Jello's life, including how he was recently sued by the other three Dead Kennedys because he wouldn't let them use \"Holiday In Cambodia\" in a Levi's commercial, the pain he felt when his sister was killed in a 1996 rock climbing accident and even how much he enjoys Beavis & Butthead! (it really was a great show -- smart humor masquerading as stupid humor, a concept that a lot of people didn't get).\n\nIf you want to get just one Jello spoken word album to see what they're like, this is the best place to start. Like I said, it's diverse, it includes tons of funny stories as well as interesting observations and thought-out opinions about a shimload of brain-teasing issues (not a single track features the word \"censorship\" in the title!), and, best of all, it features a fantastic 27-minute piece called \"Hellburbia\" that examines the recent glut of school shootings.\n\nAnd quit asking me if he's gay. How the hell would I know if the lisping sissy is gay or not?\n\nReader Comments\n\nbillsangry@aol.com\n\nThe cover art is lame. Otherwise it's an excellent listen..\n\nanthony_nixon@hotmail.com\n\nJello Biafra is a hypocritical son of a bitch!!!\n\nratboymike@hotmail.com (Michael H)\n\nJello Biafra is NOT gay. He was married (which fell apart during the FRANKENCHRIST trial-I have pictures of his wedding) and the explanation was said on an episode of \"Politically Incorrect\" where Jello was talking about \"Maximum Wage\" in which he says he still can not afford to get his teeth fixed to this day. If you still think he's gay, read the Alternative Tentacles FAQ for yourself.\n\nrkay51@hotmail.com\n\nNever heard this record, but some rockin' trivia for you - before Frank Zappa died he said the only TV shows he would watch were Beavis and Butthead and the almighty Mystery Science Theater 3000. I know this isn't relevant, but I am writing an essay on digital copyright, it's not exciting. He was also asked which new bands he liked, and he said something along the lines of \"none really...except this bunch of kids who wear monster masks when they play, they're called Mr. Bungle\".\n\nAdd your thoughts? The Big Ka-Boom, Part One - Alternative Tentacles 2002.\n\nA few days after September 11th, 2001, I was directed to visit Alternative Tentacles' web site and told that I would not believe the idiocy that I found there. And such was the case. As the front page opened, I saw what might be the most depressing comment on the intelligence of the young punk rock generation that I have ever seen (and that includes the responses to my Subhumans reviews). Right there on the front page read the statement: \"Many people have written in asking what Jello thinks about the terrorist attacks.\"\n\nSay that slowly to yourself. \"Many people have written in asking what Jello thinks about the terrorist attacks.\" What exactly does it mean? Here's what it means: Punk rockers saw it on the news and were completely unable to figure out how they were SUPPOSED TO RESPOND. People are dead! That's bad! But... they were terminal preppies in the World Trade Center. So that's good! No but... pain was caused to people. That's bad! But... but the Pentagon was hit, and those are the guys I'm not supposed to like. So that's good! Oh, I can't figure it out on my own --- WWJD?\n\nThis short spoken word album is their answer. 34 minutes long, supposedly \"rush released because of the time sensitivity\" (so explain why it was recorded in early November and released in late April) and full of interesting facts, ideas and propaganda about the U.S. military reaction to the attacks. In a nutshell, Jello sympathizes with all who lost loved ones, understands that we need to protect ourselves and is well aware that this is an extremely complex situation. HOWEVER, he doesn't trust Bush or his team at all (wisely), wishes that all that money we're spending on the War on Terrorism would be spent on greater airline and domestic security and is fairly certain (again, wisely) that the more we piss off the Middle East, the more attacks there are going to be as the children of today become the young militants of tomorrow. He offers up some good ideas too - some from Michael Medved, others from Michael Moore and himself - including decommisioning and shutting down nuclear plants, ending sanctions against Iraq, pulling troops out of Saudi Arabia (ehh...this one I'm not so sure of - how the hell else are we gonna keep on eye on Saddam Hussein? Laugh all you want, but the man has proven himself to be a ruthless mass murderer) and buying weapons from the former Soviet states to make sure they don't end up in our enemies' hands. It's an interesting listen - he stays very focused on the political ramifications while not forgetting the human loss involved (at one point, he starts to say something negative about all the people \"waving flags in anger and remorse,\" then stops himself and adds \"...which you have to give them room for -- but war isn't the answer either!\" He's a human being - he lost his sister. He's not just some blind mindless radical out there protesting just for the sake of presenting an opposing viewpoint. At NO point does he say anything inflammatory like \"The Pentagon deserved it!,\" choosing instead to not to forsake his heart for the sake of his brain, concluding that the leaders of our corporations are purposely keeping other countries in poverty for their own personal gain, but that it's US that are paying for their crimes against humanity. US. I used to believe that corporations were just \"a collection of people all trying to make ends meet,\" but now that I've experienced the corporate life for a while, I no longer believe AT ALL that this is the case. The people at the bottom are trying to make ends meet and lead a happy life, but the people at the top are greedy, evil, power-hungry, ruthless bastards who don't give a fuck about anything or anybody other than their own success. That's how they reach the top of the corporate ladder - there's no other way to do it. You can probably count the number of benevolent corporate CEOs in this country on one hand. And please don't fall for corporations that give a lot of money to charity -- this is a PR stunt that is as old as PR itself -- the idea is to curry the public's favor and make them think that you truly *CARE* so that they don't notice all the other shit you pull that proves you DON'T care. Everything is about cutting corners and keeping salaries as low as possible so that profit is achieved. It wouldn't even necessarily HAVE to be an evil system if there weren't so many heartless bastards in the business world. Read up on Kenneth Lay and his friends from Enron - check out the stuff those pricks did. Check out how they completely and PURPOSELY fucked over their own \"little guys.\" I'd better stop writing now. I'm getting out of my league and also getting very angry. I'm not smart enough to know the answer to anything. Neither is Jello Biafra, but at least he bothers to read! All I read are rock bios and Feral House books. Oooooo!\n\nReader Comments\n\nvita_min_man@yahoo.com\n\nJeez, Rear Admiral Prindle, you certainly show your age on this.\n\n\"Here's what it means: Punk rockers saw it on the news and were completely unable to figure out how they were SUPPOSED TO RESPOND.\" Duh. Have you seen these \"punks\" today? They have mohawks leather jackets, safety pins, etc...but they don't realize how they're dressing is old, overdone, and not shocking or different anymore. They do it because they think they're rebellious anarchists and listen to punk. My town has a collection of these puds. It's a bunch of 15 year olds who love the Dead Kennedy's, but they burn all their CD's. By doing that, they miss out on the lyrics, which criticizes them quite a bit, \"Chickenshit Conformist...\" They also never bother to branch out to any other sort of music or idealogies, it's 3 chords played fast with some guy screaming about anarchy. I bet the only they like the DK's is because of \"Nazi Punks Fuck Off.\" \"Oh Nazi's are bad, so I should hate them, so this song is good.\" Even though the song isn't about Hitler fanatics.\n\nI've asked them why they have all these upside down American flag patches, and they're like \"America's corrupt and it sucks.\" My oh my, it must have taken time to come to that conclusion. Maybe it's because they found out Barney the dinosaur was just a person in a suit.\n\nThere is no intelligence in today's \"punk\" scene. It's just another social group, not a movement. The music in today's scene is God awful too.\n\nGet a hair cut and a damn job and stop having your mom pay for your mod clothes, you chodes.\n\nzanzibarmcfate@excite.com (Sam)\n\nI'd been meaning to write in aboot the genius of the DKs or CJs or the questionable genius of X for a while, but as usual, it's stuff that pisses me off that motivates me to get off my ass and, uh, sit down and write something.\n\nI'm sick of all these old farts banging on about how punk kids these days have no respect for their elders. I was, very recently, a 15 year old who loved the Dead Kennedys, but somehow I still managed to explore other music and ideologies. After much thought, I came to the conclusion that while anarchism has a lot to say for itself, marx/socialism would probably work better.\n\nAnd as for modern punk not being a proper movement, I'm so sorry that we haven't managed to match the glorious achievements of you guys when you brought down Reagan and started the glorious United States of Anarchy. Even the hippies got further than you, and at least the modern punk scene has connections to the great anti-war movement which is actually doing something.\n\nSo in conclusion, when people like vitamin man complain that punk died when they stopped sniffing glue and got a job, what they actually mean is that they're upset because dirty old men no longer lust after their sweet teenage asses.\n\nGoddamn, punk kids nowadays sure do love whining. Next time i'll try and write in about something that people actually care about.\n\nOSLANE@student.gvsu.edu\n\nI half agree with you. Most punk rockers (past or present) are no more free thinkers than the people they rebel against and can't admit that the wear those funny clothes because they look cool and chicks like them. On the other hand I find it interesting hearing what my favorite entertainers have to say on issues, especially ones they specifically deal with. I don't have a strong opinion on Jello Biafra, he's usually entertaining and fun to listen to, occasionally antagonistic and I agree with lots of things he says.\n\nAdd your thoughts? Machine Gun In The Clown's Hand - Alternative Tentacles 2002.\n\nAmong the world's population, there are those who consider me a fool for giving Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra's spoken-word albums such high ratings. They argue that he does nothing but quote left-wing propoganda as if it were truth, without coming up with any opinions of his own. They chide me about his arrogance and enormous sense of self-worth (as evidenced on this CD by the disgustingly high-and-mighty conclusion, \"Lots of people come up to me and say, 'You changed my life'! Maybe.... but now it's YOUR turn.\"). They accuse him of ripping off his own band members for two decades, then bald-facedly asking fans to donate their money NOT to humans right causes NOR to charities for the poor, but to the \"Alternative Tentacles Legal Defense Fund\" (because it's YOUR fault he lost the DKs back catalog, and without your help, there won't be any more Pachinko cds). They even casually mention Jello's ongoing attack on Tipper Gore who, by all accounts, has supposedly helped the needy a hell of a lot more than Jello has (In addition to charity work, I'm told that she donated all earnings from her book Picture This to the National Health Care for the Homeless Council).\n\nBut why look at the glass as half-empty when it is clearly only 49.7% empty? Even if Jello isn't the perfect liberal saint we all dreamt he would be, his spoken word albums DO bring important information and ideas to lots of people (myself included) who don't have time to click through every leftist webzine in the world in an ongoing fruitless search for \"the Truth.\" (Did Scully and that scab ever find it, btw? I stopped watching the show shortly after the movie answered every question I've ever had about the conspiracy, completely depleting any interest I might have had in wasting an hour of my life every Sunday night when I could be praying). I've never been Mister Political by trade, but I've been keeping a close, vigilant eye on Washington (via those 3 or 4 daily headlines on Yahoo) ever since the terrorist things happened, and yikes is this a many-flavored society of lies and cover-ups in which we are dwelling. If Jello doesn't tell the kids, who will? Certainly not Henry Rollins, who'd rather talk about buying condoms at Rite-Aid and how cool Jesus is. And beyond those two, there aren't any punk spokespeople!\n\nExcept Tesco Vee, of course, who moderates regular C-Span debates on health care and social security.\n\nThis latest spoken-word triple-CD focuses on Bush's War Against Terror, with a few bonus tracks about the fake California energy crisis, Ralph Nader and the Ramones. You'll hear (A) things you already know! (B) things you didn't know! and (C) things that aren't true! Unfortunately, it's completely up to you to figure out which of Jello's bold facts come from reputable sources and which are just bullshit funnelled down through the Leftist Grapevine. It's also up to you to somehow find cleverness in such satirical personal affronts as \"John Ashcrack,\" \"Osama bin Werewolf\" and \"George Bushcraft.\" These things I cannae do for thee. I can only invite you to listen, nod your head knowingly and use Jello's words as a starting point -- a launchpad, if you will, from which you can take certain concepts and conduct further research on them to find out if the world is as corrupt as Lard's lead singer claims (and believe me -- it IS).\n\nSo yes, if you can treat this album as a one-stop shop for post-9/11 leftist commentary while keeping in mind that every argument is one-sided and of questionable origin, you'll likely find it to be an incredibly interesting resource. I know I did! And you know me -- I don't find just ANYTHING interesting! (*stares at mousepad for 45 minutes, wondering how they made it squishy yet firm at the same time*)\n\nReader Comments\n\nrobotica@rocketmail.com (Sir Adam Boysen)\n\nthe criticisms of Biafra by your readers seem legit, but here are a few more scandalous facts about him that I think the world needs to know...\n\n1. Jello wears tighty whiteys.\n\n2. He puts Beano on his salad.\n\n3. He is not gay.\n\nI think these revelations will be enough to convince you that you should no longer bother buying his albums, and instead spend the money on CDs by kid rappers. I have noticed you have NO reviews of kid rappers on here, and they are very popular these days. Don't you ever watch Apollo Kids?\n\nlevez@eperdu.net\n\nMouse mats are usually made with rubber that has tons and tons of gaps, in a honeycombed sort of way. A bit like corrugated cardboard and how that is stiff yet fairly yielding to being bent and twisted compared to a piece of thick card. In the case of the latter the corrugated helps cushion the contents inside.\n\nAnonymous\n\nMore scandalous facts about Jello:\n\n1. he likes catfish\n\n2. he gets all his godawful clothes from thrift stores\n\n3. he smells kind of funny (kind of like stale sex...)\n\n4. he carries vials of chinese herbs\n\n5. he names his cats after sci-fi characters\n\n6. he has a ghetto refrigerator that's the color of diarrhea\n\n7. he wears socks with little aliens on them\n\n8. he almost never sleeps\n\n9. he doesn't talk politics all the time\n\n10. hypocrite or not, greedy asshole or not, he's one of the most interesting people I've ever met. And I would hang out with him again in a heartbeat.\n\nAnd I mean it, he isn't gay.\n\nI enjoy this album simply because I've seen it performed live three times now and I'll never forget the segment in which he mentions his girlfriend because the first time I'd seen that live, the moment he mentioned the phrase \"my girlfriend\", the whole audience (who had been cheering), suddenly went completely quiet. I mean, crickets and tumbleweeds quiet. And then I heard one person behind me whisper:\n\n\"I thought he was gay? This fucks up everything, man!\"\n\nI hope this ends the stupid letters of \"IS HE GAY?!\"\n\nBecause I assure you, he's taken, and the person who's taken him has a vagina. And she will proudly show you.\n\nkeep this anonymous, I don't want any idiot punkers emailing me with stupid questions.\n\nojdgjnfb8437@yahoo.com.au (Lou Siffer)\n\nTo the person above.\n\nThey say Pol Pot was a charming man in person, but that doesn't change the fact he had around 1,000,000 murdered.\n\nJello's stuff can be entertaining, but I can't believe people want him for president. By the way, you're right Prindle, Ian McKaye isn't a Jello Biafra.\n\nesweenor@charter.net (Eric Sweenor)\n\nI think this might be Jello's least enjoyable album. Perhaps I'm just too much into intelligent debate, but Jello, let's face it, don't back it up. Few, if any, of his claims on this album are supported by anything except - well, his claims. Yes, it's important to find out what a sham the \"war on terror\" and its inherent corruption is, but Jello, who always claimed he wanted to try to preach to others than the converted, is merely playing things here for the home crowd. He'd have some GREAT points, if only he provided the slightest proof. He needs to stick to providing evidence, not making baseless accusations, as much as I'd like to believe (and do, from other sources) his (deserved) attacks on the Bush regime's antics. Let's face it, aimless polemic doesn't help anyone's cause, and no one who doesn't already agree is going to think of Jello as anything more than a crank with his own record label.\n\nAlso, because he doesn't tell as many funny stories in addition to this, it gets a fairly low grade. The one about his Scandinavian-Minnesotan geometry teacher, however, is utterly hysterical. 6/10\n\nbladeystyle@yahoo.com (Johnny Blades)\n\nThis is not in any way meant as disrespect to Jello Biafra or the Dead Kennedys in general, who remain among the greatest and most important figures in the history of punk rock, nor to the political left, which I am happy to count myself a member of. But I was blasting \"Holiday in Cambodia\" at work today when suddenly I realized that Jello's career path has a lot of oddly appropriate parallels to other typical left-wing quasi-Marxist rabblerousers. They all talked a good game about principles and values and equality and justice in the beginning, but when Jello finally got his career to a place where he had major clout in the punk/underground rock community, he became just like a Communist guerrilla whose revolution finally took over the country: he threw principle out the window, grew a gigantic ego, and gathered a cult of personality who were eager to kiss his ass at every opportunity. (Jello's cult of personality is called Alternative Tentacles.)\n\nknowstev@med.umich.edu (Steven Knowlton)\n\nIntrigued by comments on this page, I surfed over to Jello's homepage... what an ego! I love this statement: \"Jello has added his endorsement to the campaign for Measure I, a local Berkeley initiative that is part of the March 2nd California elections.\" Who's Jello Biafra to \"endorse\" anything? Last I heard, his opinion had exactly as much force as anybody else writing a letter to the editor. Don't you have to win the confidence of the voters in your community to be able to \"endorse\" a public policy?\n\nAdd your thoughts? Never Breathe What You Can't See (with The Melvins) - Alternative Tentacles 2004\n\nHe's back! He's the man behind the mask - and he's out of control! Jello Biafra, former lead singer of the the Dead Milkmen and Nomeasho, has returned to the fore with an album of loud, heavy punkaroll songs drawn from the skinflints of Aberdeen, WA's The Melvins, a band of whom Kurt Cobain once said, \"My wife paid someone to have me murdered.\"\n\nBut more importantly, what does Jello Biafra, former lead singer of Mojo Nixon, have on his mind this time around? Well, many things, including that guy from Tool guest star guitaring on four of these eight songs! But that's not lyrically orientitated. His lyrics, aghast, revolve mainly around George W. Bush's War On Terrorism and its detrimental effects on our civil liberties here in the U.S.A. (Uninformed, Stupid Assholes).\n\nBut who listens to lyrics for the words? No, the reason people enjoy the Melvins is the music! And this music is Jello Biafra-style! In fact, if not for the exciting lead guitar strangeness and soloing of that guy from Tool and Melvins drummer Dale Crover (who plays lead on two of the tracks not populated by that guy from Tool), you might very well mistake Quit Breathing My Air for another album by Lard or Jello Baifara with Dead On Arrival. The guitar chords are loud, heavy and chunky, the tempos alternate between midtempo churn and speedy punk rock, and just like with his other projects, Jello allows a couple of the songs to stand out in stark stylistic contrast to everything else he's ever done. See, he's got a set punk-metal songwriting style, but he's willing to give it the old swisharoo every once in a while - to great affect! (And passable Effect, as well) Remember \"Bruce's Diary\" from the Nomeansno album? That's what I'm talking about. HERE - on THIS album, the two most excitingly off-the-beaten tracks are (1) the cucamonga beach music of \"Islamic Bomb,\" featuring a fantastic George Of The Jungle-style tribal beat and a familiar guitar tone that will have you frantically scanning the credits while screaming \"Wait, I thought he HATED East Bay Ray!?, and (2) \"Enchanted Thoughtfist,\" a light, non-metal, non-punk, heartfelt midtempo rock song in which Jello -- for the first time EVER? -- expresses a lack of confidence in his knowledge and public persona. It's still inexcusably arrogant, of course (\"It always feels so strange when people tell me that I changed their lives -- now it's YOUR turn!\"), but at least he admits his shortcomings and asks his fans to \"Don't just question authority. Remember to question me!\"\n\nPresumably he meant this rhetorically, because I tried to question him and he told me to go fuck myself (metaphorically speaking). I know I've discussed this elsewhere on the site, but it bears repeating. Jello Biafra had agreed to do an interview with Caustic Truths magazine. The magazine editor said that I could conduct the interview. I contacted Alternative Tentacles and was informed that Jello had read my previous interviews with East Bay Ray and Klaus Flouride and didn't like my biased tone. I apologized, explained exactly why I'd made the mistakes I'd made, and gave some examples of the type of questions I wanted to ask, but to no availability. In the end, Jello Biafra had his assistant contact my publisher to request that a different interviewer be put on the case. My bad? Or his hypocritical? I'll leave that up to you, the occasional reader."
