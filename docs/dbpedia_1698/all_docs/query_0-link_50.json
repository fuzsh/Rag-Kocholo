        "meta_description": "In Canada's glorious punk history, few embodied the greatness of the 1978-82 era like THE SUBHUMANS (not to be confused\nwith the UK SUBHUMANS). This titan of Vancouver punk engaged with the burgeoning worldwide movement and shared stages\nwith BLACK FLAG, DEAD KENNEDYS and BAD BRAINS. This album unleashes 14 new songs, the first written by original members\nMike Graham, Brian Goble and Gerry Hannah since 1982! Joined by drummer Jon Card (SNFU/DOA), the songs are every bit as\ndynamic, powerful and poignant as the band's beloved early material. They rock out with seething intelligence and\nsoulfulness. The sound is both classic and unique, and these guys have been around too long to bother imitating anyone\nelse! Rather than rehashing the past, THE SUBHUMANS forge ahead with compelling vitality.",
