        "text": "With their new 7” “Still Standing”, Tsunami Bomb has returned with their unique sound of keyboard driven bombastic punk rock with a dark edge and soaring vocals that gives an incredible fresh spin on some classic tracks.\n\nFollowing up their emphatic return on the 2019 LP “The Spine That Binds”, Tsunami Bomb wanted to revisit two of their classic songs as a gift for their street team, The Bomb Squad. The Irish jig driven “Irish Boys” is a live show favorite, but only previously available on a bedroom made 4 track recording from 1999. Keyboardist and co-vocalist Oobliette Sparks takes lead on this track, firing lines back and forth with vocalist Kate Jacobi, while guitarist Andy Pohl showcases his lead guitar skills as the song screams through it’s bittersweet tale of both shoes and evening plans drunkenly destroyed.\n\nAnother Tsunami Bomb beloved classic gets a revisit with “El Diablo”, a song that was co-written by Oobliette who had sadly left the band by the time it was originally recorded. Now in its intended form, the keyboards return with a vengeance making you wonder how they could have ever not been present. Meanwhile the band’s tight rhythm section, drummer Gabe Lindeman and bassist Dominic Davi, explosively charge through the track at a breakneck pace. However, it’s Jacobi who takes center stage, with her high-flying vocals making the song and its message definitively and unquestionably hers.\n\nThat’s just side A! Side B has two tracks exclusive to the vinyl, from a bootleg recording of the band in New York in 2018! If you have never seen Tsunami Bomb live, the shows are notorious for being packed, sweaty sing-alongs, and that is very much on display here. On two of their most popular songs of all time, “Take The Reins” and “Lemonade” the band is almost drowned out by the East Coast crowd who screams every word back at them.\n\nWhile the “Still Standing” 7” was supposed to be just for their street team, Jello Biafra caught wind of it and insisted it be released on Alternative Tentacles, allowing the world to hear this new classic from Tsunami Bomb. A good thing he did, because this EP proves once again that not only is Tsunami Bomb “Still Standing”, they are better than ever."
