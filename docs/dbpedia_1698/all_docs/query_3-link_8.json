The sleeve, the topics, the so-horrible-it's-amazing production values, that voice. Many in the know crown it the sickest punk record ever made. But there is more -- much more. The Gacy's Place sessions yielded eight songs, only three were ever released. A dig in the ol' crawlspace turned up even cruder earlier demos with alternate versions of the EP songs, plus over half-a-dozen others, heard only by a handful of people. A true labor of man-boy love, it took Jello Biafra years to pry this loose from the band. They kept insisting each album be housed in a three-foot wide scale model of Gacy's house itself! Now their affliction has subsided enough so that everyone finally has a chance to save their $200 'evil-Bay' bucks and grab a whole album's worth of mental illness before their condition comes back.

'Banana Bike' is an unrecorded Shaggs song given new life with Wiggin's signature bashfulness. Upbeat and heavyhearted, 'The Fella with a Happy Heart,' is another classic Shaggs-era tune never heard until now.

Nomeansno formed in a vacuum, in Victoria, British Columbia in 1979 and honing their sounds for years before relocating to Vancouver and releasing eleven albums over an almost forty-year career, including a collaborative album with Jello Biafra, and numerous EPs and singles. Originally formed as a two-piece by brothers John and Rob Wright, and later joined by monster guitarist, Andy Kerr. Mixing hardcore punk, dark lyrics, and sophisticated arrangements boarding on prog, Nomeansno was massively influential and widely regarded as the first band to be referred to as 'math rock.' Originally released on Alternative Tentacles in 1989, Wrong stands on its own and is still considered to be a much-loved classic. Allmusic called the album a masterpiece and a definitive jazz core album. In 2021, the album was voted by the publics' to win the Canadian Polaris Heritage Prize to honor classic Canadian albums released before the creation of the award. In 2015, drummer John Wright described the album as their 'most popular album by a country mile' and to the St. Louis Music Press of Wrong's success to the rise of alternative music and the success of Nirvana: 'That's where all the buzz about us came from. We were touring throughout the States in the mid-'80s, and we'd get a little bit of an audience here and there, but after a couple of years in Europe, we started doing some big shows there, and all of a sudden, people in the States were coming out to our shows. And we went from getting paid $200 to getting paid $1000. It was just like that. You had to have the buzz, and then it all just kind of blew up.'

We've hooked another live one from the swirling depths of the most obscure, desirable, and just plain deranged. Like many early punk pioneers The Eat operated in a near-total vacuum. This time in that infamous cesspool of clueless retirees and moronic sun worshippers known as South Florida. Their classic 7\"s were rare and sought after from the moment they came out, distribution was nil, most were given away at shows and crushed on the spot, some even wound up lining parrot cages. As a result, Communist Radio and God Punishes The Eat are some of the most sought after and obscenely expensive Killed By Death items on eBay. Th e band's angle on the world has a lot to do with this. Political concerns like 'Communist Radio', 'Nut Cops', 'Kneecappin' and 'Nixon's Binoculars.' Environmental awareness like 'Manatee Smacker,' 'M-80 Ant Death' and 'Living Like a Pig', and numerous celebrations of that seedy Florida lifestyle like 'Catholic Love', 'Silly Drug Songs', 'Money for the Police' and 'Psychotic McHale's Navy.' The Eat reappeared sporadically clear through the mid-90s, yet still seemed unaware how wide their cult and notoriety had spread, especially among people who've never actually heard them. So now everyone can! Both early 7\"s are here, the dropouts in the five God Punishes songs fixed up at last, followed by the entire Scattered Wahoo Action cassette album and all the unreleased songs from their aborted Hialeah album that was chopped down to their third and final 7\". Sound is top-floor melodic punk 'n' roll, sort of a sped-up Real Kids with rock-bottom Angry Samoans-style lyrics. Disc one's a whopping 30+ studio tracks, many never before released. But that's not all folks. The CD version comes with a bonus live disc with two dozen more songs and many a crude rude remark from band to audience.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nVIRUS 459LP\n\n2022 repress. \"Aurora's Frantix transfixed the early 1980s Colorado punk scene with their unique sound and chaotic live show, releasing just two 7-inch EPs before evolving into the equally renowned grunge band The Fluid, Sub Pop's first non-Seattle signing who helped lead the label's grunge invasion of the mainstream. The group's complete recorded works -- both EPs plus rare, unreleased and great-sounding demo and live material -- are collected here, most tracks appearing on vinyl for the first time ever. Though many people mistakenly believe that Mudhoney's well-known version of 'My Dad's a Fuckin' Alcoholic' is an original, this is the true KBD classic! The mix of Ricky Kulwicki's unstoppable, lava-flow guitar, Matt Bischoff's droning, carpet-bombing bass, Davey Stewart's train-wreck drums, and Marc Deaton's teenage-zombie vocals is downright legendary. Frantix were never just hardcore, and one can hear it on their very first recordings from 1980: beneath the songs' amphetamine stutter and sonic tachycardia are strands of rock 'n' roll DNA belonging to Johnny Thunders and Keith Richards. 'Dancin' to Punk' and 'FM Ear' are smeared with lipstick traces of the Modern Lovers. The classic My Dad's a Fuckin' Alcoholic, equal parts Black Flag and Flipper with a touch of the New York Dolls, sports a simple but unforgettable bass riff and sing-along chorus and was a local favorite that grew to national underground prominence after its original release. Frantix shared the stage with national acts and punk legends like Black Flag, TSOL, Circle Jerks and Dead Kennedys.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nVIRUS 032LP\n\n\"Re-pressed on vinyl!!!! This is where it all began for these acid casualty reality trippers. Brown Reason To Live is their very first release; it came out in 1983. Here it is on vintage thick wax. 12\"vinyl, 7-song ep -- their first classic slab o' wax, and still as crazed and lysergic as ever! P.S. And the answer to the timeless question, 'what speed is this meant to be played on?' It's meant to be played at 69 rpm, of course! (But if your turntable doesn't have a '69' setting, try it on 45 instead.)\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nVIRUS 039LP"
