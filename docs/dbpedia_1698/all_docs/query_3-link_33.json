Belief in myths allows the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought.” - JFK\n\nUnfortunately the Dead Kennedys’ Facebook page has recently been invaded by a small group of Jello Biafra followers (and fake accounts) posting false information about Klaus Flouride, D. H. Peligro and myself. Needless to say, it feels really awful when people spread lies about you. So to let folks know what actually happened, here again is what our lead singer did to us.\n\nJello Biafra is a very talented person, we collaborated on great music together and he is exceptionally outspoken, but talent and outspokenness do not indicate character. To put it simply, he betrayed Klaus, D. H. and myself, and what Dead Kennedys stand for-- behind our backs he stole song writing credit and skimmed royalties from us, not the other way around.\n\nWhen his selfishness was ultimately proven, Biafra used his position and charisma to spread lies and malicious myths about us to cover up and distract from his own betrayal of us and Dead Kennedys. And we still hear those lies being thoughtlessly spread by people who have no first hand knowledge of the situation. The experience was one of the worst things for Klaus, D. H. and I to have to go through. And it was devastating to learn that the ideals that Biafra spoke of meant nothing to him, they’re just there for his image, he only looks out for himself.\n\nSo now that the band Neurosis finally has the rights back to their record which was on Alternative Tentacles, “Enemy of the Sun,” they can speak out about how Biafra stole from them just like he stole from East Bay Ray, Klaus Flouride and D. H. Peligro.\n\nFortunately, Dead Kennedys music is larger than any one personality and we hope that our music and basic message lives on - don’t be a lemming, think for yourself. Onward.\n\nexcerpt of interview:\n\nScott Kelly of Neurosis: The Hellbound Interview\n\nBy Justin M. Norton\n\nQuestion: For those who haven’t seen the new reissue [of “Enemy of the Sun”], how is the album different from the last remastering done in 1999?\n\nAnswer: It’s not a whole lot different. The tracks are all the same. The packaging is different. It’s’ just the first time Neurosis has been able to claim the album. It’s always been out there. We just wanted to take the initial pressing back from Alternative Tentacles and stop the bleeding. Now we’ve established this label, painstakingly put things together. The label is viable on some level and definitely the place to find our music. As we get back the rights to our records we’ll re-release more.\n\nQuestion: What happened with AT?\n\nAnswer: Alternative Tentacles ripped us off. That’s the simple version. They cooked the books and we called them on it. They accused us of all sorts of things and being greedy. And it was only about $3000!\n\nIt was basically an honor thing. There was no honor there. I don’t know what to say about it except that I was proud to be on the label when they approached us to do us records. We held them in high regard and it couldn’t be further from that now.\n\nQuestion: Label head Jello Biafra (former singer of the Dead Kennedys) also lost a lawsuit filed by his former band mates essentially claiming he’d been withholding royalties on the back catalog.\n\nAnswer: They won in court because they were correct. If he would rip us off for a small amount of money then he’d go after them for huge amount of money. When is the last time he had to punch a clock or worry about rent? He doesn’t. Who lives in a house on the hill? He does. I live in a trailer in the woods. I have a day job and always have. What he did to his fellow band mates is all there in black and white."
