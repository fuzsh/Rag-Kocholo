        "text": "Articles of Faith Wait EP reissue\n\nOne of the best and at the time most inventive USHC 7″s gets the reissue it deserves, had Alternative Tentacles not already compiled all of AOF’s material onto Complete Volumes 1 & 2 in 2002. Is this a necessary move? I’m leaning towards yes. The ferocity of “I’ve Got Mine” and “Buy This War” can’t be understated and probably warrant the reissue in order to teach new-age bootleg shirt kids, egg punks, and chopped and screwed enthusiasts what hardcore is supposed to sound like. The album art comes across simple, almost completely inept until you open the meticulously made insert containing the lyrics to “Wait.” Bondi may have said some of the worst no-no words in the American Hardcore doc but he’s got some of the most brilliant lyrics of the era on show here.\n\nReviewer Paolo Bon Tempo\n\nLabel Alona's Dream / Alternative Tentacles\n\nIssue MRR #442 • March 2020\n\nArticles of Faith What We Want Is Free EP reissue\n\nThe explosion of hardcore in the USA in 1981 occurred at just the right time in a socio-cultural context to recruit to its ranks a legion of incredibly talented and creative people. When we review the canon of the first few years of hardcore in America, we are astonished at how much truly great, empowering, and influential music was created in a short period of time. Like the original explosion of punk in the UK, it was just the right place and right time. Here were a lot of very talented and energetic young people who were just waiting for some creative window to open that they could jump through. ARTICLES OF FAITH were one of many of those first wave of hardcore bands. Their first two 7″s captured them at a perfect point where the raw energy of hardcore was bursting forth, and before their creative talents lead them to more complex compositions and explorations. Their later material draws in a lot of influence from GANG OF FOUR and other post-punk types, but on What We Want is Free, we have that raw enthusiasm of a band’s first release, charging hard out of the gate with no such pretensions. The recording is lo-fi, the layout is cut-and-paste, but the energy and zeal radiate from the record like blazing bonfire. Musically, this is straight-ahead ’82 hardcore, but played with some chop and panache that reveals a greater underlying musicianship, not unlike their then labelmates DIE KREUZEN, or perhaps New Strings For Old Puppets-era REALLY RED. Vic Bondi wrote some great lyrics; he had a way of capturing complex social or economic issues and condensing them into a “less is more” lyrical delivery. That is to say, you can read a lot into what he is trying to say with very few words. “What we Want is Free,” “Bad Attitude,” and “My Father’s Dreams” focus on the yearning to be free from the constraints of a preordained conformist career in the capitalist system. “Everyday” is the same message of the bleak dehumanized reality that awaits those who do conform and get stuck in society’s rat race. The second 7″ Wait was also reissued; that one is a real masterpiece musically and lyrically. Taken together they are a testament to the enduring power of the genre.\n\nReviewer Felix Havoc\n\nLabel Alona's Dream / Alternative Tentacles\n\nIssue MRR #442 • March 2020\n\nDead Kennedys Plastic Surgery Disasters LP\n\nThe DKs are the only group around whose new releases I approach with the same expectation, apprehension, and critical ear that I did for each new STONES record 16 years ago. You just know a lot of thought, work, and possible innovation will be invested in the grooves. Whether a self-appointed or media-chosen representative of “punk,” Biafra must be carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders. As for the record, side one is more like their live selves and more like their earlier recordings. No real let-down, though there are no immediate “classics,” either. Side two contains longer, more dramatic, and varied pieces that, while bravely breaking the norm, can be very trying. I’ll try more later. Meanwhile, the DKs keep subverting middle America. Keep it up.\n\nReviewer Tim Yohannan\n\nLabel Alternative Tentacles / Faulty Products\n\nIssue MRR #4 • January/February 1983\n\nDOA Bloodied but Unbowed LP\n\nThis is probably the last DOA release I’m going to like, so I decided to review it as a gesture of friendship and respect for a band that’s made some great music and raised a lot of people’s consciousnesses throughout the years. Bloodied But Unbowed is a retrospective greatest hits album featuring re-mixed versions of material culled from most of their earlier (now out of print) 7″ records and LPs, so it serves a very valuable purpose. And a lot of classic stuff is on here—from “The Prisoner” to “World War III”—so it would be positively stupid not to pick it up if you never got the originals. If you can find Hardcore 81—their finest hour—grab it; otherwise, this is essential.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Alternative Tentacles\n\nIssue MRR #11 • January/February 1984\n\nThe Fartz World Full of Hate… 12″\n\nNot quite up to the standard set by their debut EP, but still excellent. Some of the thrashers run together indistinguishably, and slower metal songs like “Hero’s” and Black SABBATH’s “Children of the Grave” don’t cut it, but in general, the same qualities that made their 7″ so great—sneering vocals that could strip the paint off walls, raging instrumental power, and perceptive lyrics—are well in evidence on this 12”. If you play it loud enough, you can a) make the Silent Majority wilt with “Battle Hymn of Ronnie Reagan,” b) do agit-prop work on the R.C.P. with “Don’t Want No Gun,” c) put fascists on the run with my fave “Take a Stand (Against the Klan),” d) drive your nosey neighbors crazy with any of these 16 tracks, or e) manage all of the above. This record’s an all-purpose ass-kicker, so use it.\n\nReviewer Jeff Bale\n\nLabel Alternative Tentacles\n\nIssue MRR #4 • January/February 1983"
