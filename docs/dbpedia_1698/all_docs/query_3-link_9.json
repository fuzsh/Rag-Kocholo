        "text": "Patrik Fitzgerald is an English singer-songwriter, known for being one of the originators of the Folk Punk movement. Ranked as one of the most memorable of the so-called “punk poets” he first debuted in 1977 and has become known for his unique combination of punk outrage with a streak of optimism.\n\nOriginally writing the song “Punch” in 1980, shortly after Margaret Thatcher had been elected Prime Minister of Great Britain.\n\nFitzgerald had this to say about the song;\n\n“At the time that the song was written, it seemed like the worst type of person to be in charge of a country would be a right wing monster like Margaret Thatcher or a dangerous ex-actor / reactionary like Ronald Reagan, a bit of a joke figure, but also a gun-toting and gun promoting right wing monster.\n\nNobody might have expected that , by the early 2020s, the world would end up in the hands of actual clowns like Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, people written off by their own public as comedy buffoons, people to laugh at but not take too seriously.”\n\nSide A features a new recording of the song from 2021, while on side B the track covered by the Norwegian rock group, Motopsycho with a bit of help from the legendary Jello Biafra.\n\nOriginally forming 1989, and named after a Russ Meyer sexploitation classic, Motopsycho combines psychedelic influences with high energy punk rock n’ roll. Their output has been vast and varied, averaging a new album per year over the course of their 35 year existence that has led to a diverse and sprawling catalog that has been a delight to many a record collector and music fan.\n\nTheir version of «Punch» was originally recorded for the Crispin Glover Records tribute to Patrik Fitzgerald collection ‘All Sewn Up’, back in 2009. The band went for an all-in hard rock approach for their version, something that Jello’s characteristic vocals only added sparkle and intent to, and it is safe to say that the result stood out, even on an album as densely packed with heavy hitters and great music as that one.\n\nThe “Punch” seven inch will be available on March 15th as a dual release from Alternative Tentacles Records and Crispin Glover Records.\n\nThe colorways are limited as follows for the pre-order:\n\nBlack: 1100 units - $10.00\n\n\"Joke Figure\" Orange: 1200 Units - $10.00"
