(Subhumans and DOA were the two pillars of the Vancouver, BC, Canada punk scene who caught Jello Biafra’s attention and were spotlighted in the landmark Alternative Tentacles compilation Let Them Eat Jellybeans. The Subhumans, first active between 1978 and 1982, were the more elusive of the two, with many out-of-print releases fetching bank on eBay and making it difficult for present-day fans to connect the dots. Now, the Subhumans join the Alternative Tentacles ‘Reissues Of Necessity’ pantheon with ‘Death Was Too Kind’, a collection of material from the early years, lovingly remastered from original source material: the very first single Death to the Sickoids (only 500 were pressed); the ‘Firing Squad’ single; the self-titled EP produced by Bob Rock, who went on to work with Metallica, The Cult, Offspring, etc.; ‘Look At The Dawn’ and ‘Pissed Off. With Good Reason’, two virtually lost songs (only available on the 1996 collection CD released by Essential Noise in Canada), especially remastered for this reissue from the original tapes by Jesse Gander at Hive Studios. ‘Death Was Too Kind’ features the bands best-known lineup with Wimpy Roy, Gerry Useless, Mike Graham, Dimwit, and Jim Imagawa!)
