        "text": "Cyprus and the European Union\n\nHistorical overview\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus, a small island country situated in the Eastern Mediterranean sea, joined the European Union on 1st May 2004. Relationships between Cyprus and the European Union began in 1973 with the Associate Agreement between Cyprus and the European Economic Community (EEC). The purpose of this agreement was to consolidate and expand trade, and the economic relations between Cyprus and the European Community. On 3rd July 1990 Cyprus submitted an application to become a member of the EEC. The application was critically assessed and Cyprus was found to satisfy the criteria of membership and suitable in 1993. This was reaffirmed in 1995. The accession of Cyprus, also, required harmonisation between Cypriot and European law, known as Acquis screening. This process was designed to determine the areas where necessary changes in Cypriot law needed to be made in order to harmonise it with EU legislation. This screening process was concluded in 2000 and implementation of these changes began and were assessed on a regular basis. The first Regular Report to the European Commission was submitted November 1998. Regular Reports and preparation for membership:\n\nRegular report from the Commission on Cyprus' progress towards accession 1998.\n\nCOM (98) 0710 final, 17 December 1998.\n\nRegular report from the Commission on Cyprus' progress towards accession 1999.\n\nCOM (99) 0502 final, 13 October 1999.\n\nRegular report from the Commission on Cyprus' progress towards accession 2000.\n\nCOM (2000) 0702 final, 8 November 2000.\n\nRegular report from the Commission on Cyprus' progress towards accession 2001.\n\nSEC (2001) 1745 final, 13 November 2001.\n\nRegular report from the Commission on Cyprus' progress towards accession 2002.\n\nSEC (2002) 1401 final, 9 October 2002.\n\nComprehensive monitoring report on Cyprus' preparation for membership 2003.\n\nSEC (2003) 1202 final (COM(2003) 675), 5 November 2003.\n\nFor an in-depth overview and details of further negotiations, go to: Embassy of the Republic of Cyprus - A Historical Overview\n\nEU supporting Cypriot economic recovery\n\nCyprus adopted the Euro on 1st January 2008. Since then the Cypriot economy has been erratic. In 2009 the Cypriot economy went into recession, which was mainly due to the large drop in the shipping and tourism sectors. Economic growth between 2010 and 2012 was weak and insufficient to counteract the 2009 recession. Property values had declined and there was an increase in non-performing loans. This combination of economic downfalls lead to the Cypriot financial crisis in 2012. In an attempt to address this problem the EU provided a number of investments to help boost the economy:\n\nCohesion policy and Cyprus (gives summarised details of projects)\n\nEuropean Social Fund (ESF) - The purpose of the ESF is to modernise the skills and qualifications of workers. Also, to help disadvantaged groups get the support and training they need for work. This link also provides information on budget, funding and who participates in ESF.\n\nEuropean Regional Development Fund (ERDF) - the overall objective of the ERDF is to improve the competitiveness of the country's economy within conditions of sustainable development.\n\nEU wide stress testing in Cyprus - Stress testing is a risk management tool. It is a tool used by the European Banking Authority (EBA) to monitor and assess market developments as well as to identify trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities. Thereby, helping the EBA to ensure the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets and the stability of the financial system in the EU.\n\nRelevant Publications\n\nEconomic Bulletin, Central Bank of Cyprus: Eurosystem - focuses primarily on developments in the Cyprus economy and the euro area\n\nThe economic adjustment programme for Cyprus - Fourth review Spring 2014\n\nThe economic adjustment programme for Cyprus - Third review Winter 2013\n\nThe economic adjustment programme for Cyprus - Second review Autumn 2013\n\nThe economic adjustment programme for Cyprus\n\nThe EU budget in my country - Cyprus\n\nThe European Economic and Social Committee during the Cyprus Presidency\n\nStudy on children’s involvement in judicial proceedings - Contextual overview for the criminal justice phase: Cyprus\n\nERAWATCH country reports 2012: Cyprus - The main objective of the ERAWATCH Annual Country Reports is to characterise and assess the performance of national research systems and related policies in a structured manner that is comparable across countries.\n\nFurther information:\n\nAccession of Cyprus to the European Union - description\n\nAccession Partnership with Cyprus 2002 - COM/2001/652/FINAL, BULLETIN/2001/11/1.5.4\n\nThe Treaty of Accession 2003\n\nThe introduction of the euro in Cyprus and Malta.

The idea of integration was raised by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill during his speech at Zurich University, Switzerland (19th September 1946). Who, through the recognition of Europe's political, economic and social weakness after World II, stated that the remedy:\n\n\"...is to recreate the European Family, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom. We must build a kind of United States of Europe....\"\n\nThe first step in building the foundation of the European Community was given by the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman. He, in coorperation with Jean Monnet, drew up the Schuman Plan, which proposed joint control over coal and steel production. Thereby, whoever did not have control over coal and steel production would not be able to fight a war. In 1951 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) treaty was signed in Paris by France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\nAs the European Community is based on the rule of law its policies and enlargements is determined by a number of treaties. January 1st 1973 brought about its first enlargement where the Union was joined by Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. It currently encompasses 28 countries (Member States).\n\nTo maintain harmony between its Member States, a treaty was developed to provide a basis for a six year programme aimed at tackling the problems with the free-flow of trade across EU borders and so creating the ‘Single Market’. In 1986 the Single European Act is signed. In 1993 the Single Market was completed with the four freedoms of movement: goods, services, people and money.\n\nOn November 1st 1993 the European Union (EU) was put in force by the Maastricht Treaty, which was sign on February 7th 1992. The Maastricht treaty was a consolidation of amendments of existing treaties, primarily Treaty of Rome and the Single European Act. In 2009 the Lisbon Treaty came into force, changing the way the EU works.\n\nFurther information:\n\nFounding Fathers of the European Union\n\nEnlargement of the European Union\n\nFounding Treaties\n\nEUR-Lex - access to European law\n\nHow the EU Works\n\nEU Member, Candidate and Potential Countries\n\nThe Historical Archives of the European Union (HAEU)\n\nHistory of the European Parliament (EP)\n\nThe European Parliament was initially known as the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The Assembly first met on September 10th 1952 with 78 representatives from the original six Member States (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg). At that time the Assembly had no legislative powers; it was used as a place for consultation and discussions.\n\nIn 1958, the Assembly expanded to 142 members to include representatives from the ECSC and the two newly established communities (European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom)). The Assembly was also renamed as the ‘European Parliamentary Assembly’. Its name was subsequently, unofficially, changed to European Parliament on 30 March 1962, which was finally sanctioned by the 1987 Single European Act.\n\nIn 1970, the European Parliament was granted some Community Budget powers, and five years later the Parliament was granted powers over the entire budget through the reformed treaty (the Treaty of Luxembourg and the Treaty of Brussels). In 1979, the first directly elected members took the seats of the parliament, with Simone Veil being the first member to be elected as the President of Parliament.\n\nThe evolution of the Parliament is closely linked to a succession of treaties culminating in the current Lisbon Treaty (2007). These treaties define the rules and scope of the Union and have turned the ECSC of old into what is now known as the European Union\n\nFurther information:\n\nEuropean Parliament official website\n\nHistorical Archives - material relating to EP's legislative and political activity from 1952 until the 6th parliamentary term (2004-2009).\n\nTreaties and the European Parliament\n\nEuropean Parliament after the Lisbon Treaty\n\nPowers and Procedures of the European Parliament - Including legistrative, budgetary and supervisory powers\n\nOrganisation of the European Parliament\n\nComposition of the Parliament\n\nNumber of seats per country\n\nThe European Parliament: Historical background\n\nEuropean Parliament on TV\n\nEP Information Offices\n\nHistory of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)\n\nThe Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) represents a major step in the integration of all member states of the European Union economies. It involves the coordination of economic and fiscal policies, a common monetary policy, and a common currency: the euro. Currently all 28 EU Member States take part in the economic union, while only a select number have adopted the euro. The Member States that have adopted the euro are part of the Euro Area.\n\nThe initial idea for the EMU was instigated by Gustav Stresemann (German foreign minister). In 1929, Gustav Stresemann asked for a European currency due to the increased economic division, which developed from a number of new nation states in Europe after World War I.\n\nThere were three political attempts to create the EMU before its success in 1999:\n\nThe first attempt (1969): Den Haag summit and Werner Report (historical documentation)\n\nThe second attempt (1979): The European Monetary System and the ECU (historical documentation)\n\nThe third attempt (1989): The Single European Act and the \"Delors Report\" (historical documentation)\n\nThe start of EMU and the Euro (1999), which was implemented through 3 stages\n\nFurther information:\n\nHow Economic and Monetary Union works?\n\nEU economic governance - includes links to policies, regulations, directives, repair and safeguard measures in the financial sector\n\nEU economic situation\n\nSummaries of EU legislation: Economic and monetary affairs\n\nThe euro\n\nEMU historical documentation (historical documentation)\n\nEurozone Financial Crisis\n\nThere are a number of factors that contributed to Europe's debt crisis. One of the initial factors was the heavy losses incurred by many European banks who had invested heavily in the American mortgage market. The losses were triggered by the downturn of the US economy, which caused numerous homeowners to default on their mortgages.\n\nMany EU governments provided aid in an attempt to save these European banks but the cost proved to be too high. For instance, in Ireland, it had almost bankrupted the government. This, in turn, caused Europe to slip into recession in 2009 and for investors to closely scrutinise the finances of various EU governments. The threat of bank failures meant that the health of government finances became more important than ever.\n\nFurther information:\n\nEU's response to the crisis (includes chronological overview)\n\nPayments and Markets - There are three core components of the financial system: markets; institutions and; market infrastructures, which facilitate the handling of payments and the clearing and settlement of financial instruments.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) legal acts\n\nEU economic governance - includes links to policies, regulations, directives, repair and safeguard measures in the financial sector\n\nEU economic situation (reports can be found on individual countries)\n\nSummaries of EU legislation: Economic and monetary affairs\n\nThe euro\n\nEuropean Union - Legislation\n\nAs the European Union evolved over time, so has the process for creating European legislation. For instance European Parliament has steadily become more embedded in the legislative process. In 1986, the Single European Act (1986) and the Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon Treaties successively extended Parliament's prerogatives.\n\nThe European Union implements legislation using two types of legislative procedures:\n\nOrdinary Legislative procedure - Both The Council of the EU and the European Parliament are legislators\n\nSpecial Legislative procedure - The Council is, in practice, the sole legislator. The European Parliament is required to give its consent to a legislative proposal or be consulted on it\n\nThere are three basic types of EU legislative binding instruments:\n\nA regulation, which is similar to a national law, with the difference that it is applicable in all EU countries\n\nDirectives, which set out general rules to be transferred into national law, by each country as they deem appropriate\n\nA decision, which only deals with a particular issue and specifically mentioned persons or organisations\n\nThese laws (regulations, directives and decisions) take precedence over national law and are binding on national authorities. The EU also issues non-binding instruments, such as recommendations and opinions, as well as rules governing how EU institutions and programmes work, etc.\n\nKey databases:\n\nSearch for legislation (EUR-lex) - Database of EU law, including the Official Journal, treaties, case law and parliamentary questions. It has a guided tour with tutorials on how to use EUR-Lex.\n\nCourt of Justice of the European Union - The Court of Justice interprets EU law to make sure it is applied in the same way in all EU countries. It also settles legal disputes between EU governments and EU institutions. Its database contains case-law, judgements and opinions.\n\nEuropean Court of Human Rights (HUDOC) - The European Court of Human Rights is an international court, set up in 1959. It rules on individual or State applications alleging violations of the civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nSummaries of EU legislation - EU legislation by topic, from agriculture to immigration and transport\n\nNational Law (N-Lex) - Description and links to each Member States national law databases\n\nEuropean Parliament legislative observatory - database for monitoring the EU decision-making process\n\nEuroVoc - a multilingual, multidisciplinary thesaurus covering the activities of the EU, containing terms in 23 EU languages\n\nFurther information:\n\nIntroduction to European Law\n\nEU Treaties in Chronological order\n\nApplication of EU Law\n\nCouncil of the European Union\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nEuropean Ombudsman\n\nEuropean Court of Auditors\n\nTED (Tenders Electronic Daily) is the online version of the 'Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union', dedicated to European public procurement. It also provides free access to business opportunities.\n\nEuropean Union - Statistics\n\nThe European Union offers a wealth of information both quantitative and qualitative. It works on the idea that data should be freely available for use and reuse and, therefore, has an Open Data policy. The data is provided through a number of sources:\n\nEurostat\n\nEurostat is the statistical office of the European Union.
