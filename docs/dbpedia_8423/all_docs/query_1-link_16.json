        "text": "In legend the birthplace of the ancient Greek goddess of love Aphrodite, Cyprus's modern history has, in contrast, been dominated by tension between its Greek and Turkish inhabitants.\n\nCyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the north in response to a military coup on the island which was backed by the Greek government.\n\nThe island was effectively partitioned, with the northern third run by a Turkish Cypriot government and the southern two-thirds by the internationally-recognised government led by Greek Cypriots.\n\nUnited Nations troops patrol the \"Green Line\" dividing the two parts, and reunification talks have made slow progress.\n\nCyprus has successfully diversified its largely agrarian economy into one based on services - including a large tourism sector - and light manufacturing.\n\nMore recently it has also developed into an important financial hub, especially for investors from Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\nNikos Christodoulides is the island's first leader to be born in an independent Cyprus.\n\nBacked by centrist and right-wing parties, Christodoulides was foreign minister until early 2022, He won 52% of the vote over his main rival, leftist-backed Andreas Mavroyiannis in the run-off of the February 2023 presidential election.\n\nHe has said that his prime focus as president is to find a solution to the Cyprus problem, following on from similar earlier statements he made as foreign minister.\n\nTurkish Cypriot leader: Ersin Tatar\n\nErsin Tatar won a narrow victory in the second round of the October 2020 elections, beating the incumbent Mustafa AkÄ±ncÄ±. The vote had been scheduled for April 2020 but was delayed six months because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMustafa AkÄ±ncÄ± had campaigned on a federal solution to the Cyprus dispute, and Ersin Tatar, then the Prime Minister, had campaigned in favour of a two-state solution.\n\nFive days before the first round of voting, Tatar announced a partial reopening of the ghost town of Varosha would partly reopen. Varosha had been sealed off since the 1974 conflict and the flight of its Greek Cypriot population. The announcement led to international criticism and the fall of his cabinet after the junior partner in the coalition withdrew from the government.\n\nIn September 2021, after a meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and then-President Nicos Anastasiades, Tatar said that talks on the future of Cyprus would not start unless they took into consideration \"the sovereign equality and international status of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\".\n\nThe status of Northern Cyprus as a separate political entity is recognised only by Turkey."
