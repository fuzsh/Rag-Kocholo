        "text": "Fighting organized crime in Cyprus\n\nThe Republic of Cyprus is an island in the Northeastern Mediterranean, sitting at a crossroads between Asia, Africa and Europe.\n\nThis strategic location makes the country attractive to criminal groups wishing to carry out drug smuggling operations, or to engage in economic or identity document crime. Historically, the geographical position of Cyprus has made irregular migration an area of concern.\n\nThe international characteristics of these crime areas and possible links with global crime networks make the role of the INTERPOL National Central Bureau for Cyprus in Nicosia fundamental to maintaining national and regional security‚Äù.\n\nINTERPOL in Cyprus\n\nThe NCB for Cyprus is part of the European Union and International Police Cooperation Directorate (EU-IPCD), a Headquarters Unit created to handle domestic police enquiries requiring international outreach.\n\nThe NCB links the Cyprus Police Force to its worldwide counterparts and plays a central role in preventing the country and surrounding region from serving international organized crime.\n\nBy providing globally sourced intelligence about regional crime, the NCB helps police officers across Cyprus detect and investigate the flow of illicit goods, or people, along trafficking routes in and around the country.\n\nINTERPOL Nicosia regularly takes part in INTERPOL-led police operations in the region.\n\nLaw enforcement in Cyprus\n\nThe Cyprus Police Force was created in 1960 and is part of the Ministry of Justice and Public Order. It is in charge of law and order and the prevention of serious organized crime."
