        "text": "Cyprus is a presidential republic. The president is both head of state and government. Despite joining the EU as a de facto divided island, the whole of Cyprus is EU territory. Turkish Cypriots who have, or are eligible for, EU travel documents are EU citizens. EU law is suspended in areas where the Cypriot government (Government of the Republic) does not exercise effective control. Cyprus has two official languages: Greek and Turkish; only Greek is an official EU language.\n\nHow much does Cyprus pay and receive from the EU?\n\nThe EU budget is the tool to ensure that Europe remains a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and competitive force. The EU uses it to finance its priorities and big projects that most individual EU countries could not finance on their own.\n\nThe benefits of EU membership significantly exceed the size of the EU budget contributions and the examples are many. All Member States benefit from being part of the Single Market, a shared approach to the common challenges of migration, terrorism and climate change, and concrete gains like better transport infrastructure, modernised and digitalised public services and cutting-edge medical treatment.\n\nHow much each EU country pays into the EU budget is calculated fairly. The larger your country's economy, the more it pays – and vice versa.\n\nThe EU budget is not about giving and taking – it’s about collectively contributing to making Europe and the world a better place for us all.\n\nEU budget spending and revenue per country and per year\n\nEU-funded projects in Cyprus\n\nMoney from the EU budget helps fund programmes and projects in all EU countries – for example to build roads, subsidise researchers and protect the environment.\n\nFind out more about how Cyprus benefits from EU funding and recovery funds in your country or region."
