        "text": "As part of his surprising U-turn that unblocked Sweden’s bid for NATO membership Monday evening, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey appears to have extracted vague commitments to “re-energize” his country’s complicated relationship with the European Union.\n\nIn a Monday meeting, Mr. Erdogan and Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, agreed to focus on migration and refugees, economic links and the prospect of opening up visa-free travel to the E.U. for Turks, a senior E.U. official said. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters, described the meeting as a change to a more positive tone.\n\nTurkey is officially a candidate for membership in the European Union, a status it has held for two decades. The process was practically frozen in 2018, cementing a kind of frenemy status between the bloc and its neighbor to the east. The two are deeply connected, but the relationship between them has been strained.\n\nMost E.U. countries consider Turkey’s E.U. accession bid to be dead — but they have not pushed to make that official out of concern that that would further alienate Mr. Erdogan and make improvements on key policy areas such as energy cooperation and migration harder. Here is a look at the history of Turkey’s E.U. bid and where it stands now.\n\nWhy has Turkey’s candidacy been frozen?\n\nTurkey applied to become a member of the then-smaller European Union in 1987; it was granted candidate status in 1999 and began negotiations to join in 2005. Talks for E.U. accession are normally lengthy, on average lasting about 10 years. In the case of Turkey they have officially been going on for 18 years, although they have been practically suspended for five of those.\n\nNegotiations are organized in chapters — or policy areas — in which the candidate nation tries to meet E.U. laws and standards, usually through tough overhauls.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
