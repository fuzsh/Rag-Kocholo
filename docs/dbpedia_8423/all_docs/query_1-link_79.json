        "text": "The Cyprus issue in quotations\n\nGreek Cypriot | Turkish | Turkish Cypriot | UN | US | British | Miscellaneous\n\nGreek Cypriot\n\n“Unless Turkey removes it troops out of Cyprus, no solution is possible… a solution that rewards Turkey’s invasion will never work but bring about additional hardship for the little island… Cypriots on the other hand have been quite passive in the manner of the allegory of the frogs; where they exist in a pond ignorant of the fact that the water is gradually being heated to the point they become lethargic and no longer have the will or the strength to escape until boiled to death. Today people find themselves in scorching deep water without the resolve to jump out to save themselves.”\n\nAndreas Chrysafis, in ‘Vanishing Cyprus, A Political Feast’, May 2015\n\n“To become a refugee is like taking a plant out of a pot and throwing it out. When you lose your city, you lose your friends, your way of life, your whole world.”\n\nGeorge Mouktaris, refugee from Varosi, 2011\n\n“…the objective of the Turkish side is the political upgrading of the pseudo-state, the dissolution of the Cyprus Republic, the creation of two separate legal entities and the maintenance and deepening of the division…”\n\nPresident Tassos Papadopoulos, 4 November 2009\n\n“They knowingly moved into other people’s land… they knowingly put themselves into this situation… they could’ve bought property that belonged to Turkish Cypriots… but they went for the risky option.”\n\nConstantis Candounas, lawyer of Greek Cypriot refugee Meletis Apostolides, on the Orams who illegally acquired Mr Apostolides’ land in occupied Cyprus. ‘Mediterranean Nightmares’, Tonight programme, ITV, 5 June 2009\n\n“All were stunned by what they had seen – the atrocious conditions the enclaved lived in, the destruction to our cultural heritage and total lack of respect to thousands of years of Greek European civilisation.”\n\nGreek Cypriot reflects on his visit to his family home in occupied Cyprus, 2008\n\n“Turkey occupied 37 percent of the territory of Cyprus and carried out the greatest national cleansing campaign, in relation to the size of the population, in modern European history.”\n\nGeorge Georgis, Ambassador of Cyprus to Athens, 16 July 2005\n\n“Reading through the detailed 26-page report [to Security Council] there is a total absence of any reference to the basic cause of the Cyprus problem, the Turkish invasion, the 30-year- occupation and its consequences, whose legitimisation through the Annan Plan is the basic reason for its rejection by the Greek Cypriots in the referendum.”\n\nCyprus Weekly on UN Secretary General Annan’s report on Cyprus (S/2004/437), 3 June 2004\n\n“With so many international crises on his plate, he [Kofi Annan] may not be fully informed about the true situation in Cyprus, and is forced to depend too much on the advice of intermediaries like Messrs Hannay and Weston, whose objective is not the upholding of UN principles and respect for human rights and international law, but the defence of their national interests.”\n\nCyprus Weekly, 30 April 2004\n\n“Every time there there was a new version of the plan it was worse than the previous one. Why is the world doing this to us?”\n\nLianna, Greek Cypriot, BBC News online, regarding the proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, 1 April 2004\n\n“After 1 May I will be able to settle anywhere I like in Europe, but I won’t have the right to return to the [proposed] Turkish Cypriot state where I was born. So why should I vote for it?”\n\nOrania, Greek Cypriot refugee, BBC News online, regarding the proposed UN-sponsoredAnnan Plan, 1 April 2004\n\n“This plan rewards the Turkish invasion… we had to leave our homes and land,we lost our parents and grandparents and grandparents and now the Turks get to stay.”\n\nMaria, Greek Cypriot quoted in BBC News online, regarding the proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, 1 April 2004\n\n“Without substantive financial costing, the Annan plan will fail to resolve the issue permanently: Rather, it will complicate it further, especially during the first crucial years of the new state’s operation, with tremendous dangers for social harmony and peace.”\n\nDinos Lordhos in Politis newspaper on the proposed Annan Plan, 30 March 2004\n\n“Even though Turkey gets the lion’s share in the fourth plan of the UN secretary-general it appears displeased. And like a patient suffering from bulimia, it seeks more.”\n\nHaravghi newspaper on the proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, 30 March 2004\n\n“The overwhelming majority of Greek Cypriots yesterday felt they had drawn the short straw in the fourth version of the Annan plan, with the general feeling that they would reject the blueprint come referendum day, whatever the consequences might be.”\n\nPhileleftheros newspaper on the proposedUN-sponsored Annan Plan, 30 March 2004\n\n“Instead of Turkey being democratized so as to join the European Union, Cyprus will be de-democratized. And it shall join the EU in a political system that bears little connection with the acquis communautaire…”\n\nSimerini newspaper on the Annan Plan, 2 February 2004\n\n“… a link between people and resources has been broken, a destructive, aggressive act, the opposite of the creativity which constructed the community for a very long time… There is a record of a village called Argaki in 1825, but in 1630, the Dutch cartographer Blau shows a community called Ariati on roughly the place where Argaki is today. The construction of Argaki took thousands of days; the destruction only one.”\n\nP Loizos in ‘The uprooting of a Cypriot village’ 25 June 1977\n\n“The International Committee of the Red Cross has confirmed the information according to which all the able-bodied men of the village of Bellapais have been arrested by the Turkish army and most of them have already been sent to Turkey. The number of the arrested civilians amounts to about 2,000. All of them, despite the fact that they were arrested in the central square of this village and unarmed, were considered by Turkish authorities as ‘prisoners of war’.”\n\nAmbassador Zenon Rossides of the Republic of Cyprus, letter to UN Secretary-General, 6 December 1974 (UN Document S/11569) on the deportations out of occupied Bellapais\n\n“On 23 August 1974, in the Kyrenia stadium, out of 200 soldiers and civilians in the stadium thirty were taken to the Turkish Cypriot part of Nicosia and were subsequently released. All the others were shot and killed.”\n\nAmbassador Zenon Rossides, of the Republic of Cyprus, letter to UN Secretary-General, 5 September 1974 (Expanded Number S-0903-0006-04-00001, Container S-0903-0006: Peacekeeping – Cyprus 1971-1981, UN Archives)\n\n“On August 31, 1974, the Turkish Forces entered the village of Aheritou, Famagusta district, and took away fifteen Greek Cypriots. On the same day, at 3:30 p.m., the corpse of ******, aged 68, and ******, aged 60, were found at a distance of 500 meters north of the village. Both had their eyes taken out and their corpses filled with bullets.”\n\nAmbassador Zenon Rossides, of the Republic of Cyprus, letter to UN Secretary-General, (Source: Expanded Number S-0903-0006-04-00001, Container S-0903-0006: Peacekeeping – Cyprus 1971-1981, UN Archives.)\n\n“They separated the men from the women and shot the 12 men. Those killed ranged from a 12-year-old boy to an old man in his 90s.”\n\nVassilios Efthimiou, hotel manager who was the only survivor in a party of men seized by invading Turkish forces. ‘Barbarians’, The Sun, 8 August 1974\n\n“My fiance and six men were shot dead. The Turkish soldiers laughed at me and then I was raped.”\n\nGreek Cypriot girl aged 20, ‘Barbarians’, The Sun, 8 August 1974\n\n“The Turkish soldiers cut off my father’s hands and legs. Then they shot him while I watched.”\n\nGreek Cypriot woman aged 32, ‘Barbarians’, The Sun, 8 August 1974\n\n“They shot the men. My friend’s wife said ‘Why should I live without my husband?’ A soldier shot her in the head.”\n\nGreek Cypriot farmer aged 51, ‘Barbarians’, The Sun, 8 August 1974\n\n“A country cannot be independent and at the same time be subject to outside intervention, and be placed under an overhanging threat of invasion from another country on the preposterous claim that military intervention – in violation of the Charter – can be sanctioned as a lawful procedure under any treaty… such logic would make nonsense of the Charter and of the main purpose for which the UN was established: the maintenance of peace and freedom.”\n\nZenon Rossides, Cyprus chief UN delegate, letter published in New York Times, 27 June 1964\n\nTurkish\n\n‘I am calling out to Europeans who are shaking their fingers at us: Turkey is not a country to be hustled around; it is not a country whose honor is to be played with, whose ministers are to be kicked out and whose citizens are to be jostled on the streets … If you keep up with this attitude, tomorrow no European or Western people will be able to walk in the streets with peace and safety in any place in the world … If you open this dangerous path, you will suffer the greatest damage.’\n\nPresident Erdogan, ‘Turkey not a country to be jostled: Erdogan’, Hurriyet, 22 March 2017 (Note: 22 March was the day of the terrorist attack on Westminster Bridge and precincts of the Palace of Westminster)\n\n“As the whole world witnessed, what Turkey did in 1974 and still celebrates is the planned executions, deaths, destruction, massive ethnic cleansing and ongoing cultural and demographic rape that it has committed in Cyprus. What happened was an invasion, and Turkey remains an alien invader in Cyprus. History tells the story: Cyprus has been Hellenic for 3,500 years and Christian for 2,000 years. Never did the Turkish Cypriot minority, during its brief presence on Cyprus, hold on to any contiguous part of the island. From 1,500 BCE into the 20th century, the occupied north, like the entire island, was always Greek, and later, Christian.”\n\nUzay Bulut, in ‘Turkey, Cyprus and Israel’, 28 July 2014\n\n“…the west, understandably obsessed by its own security concerns and strategies, looks the other way at the Turkish government’s abuses… I want the west to stop shielding a government with such little regard for the values of freedom”\n\nSafak Pavey, Turkish opposition MP, The Guardian, 10 June 2013\n\n“Ungrateful dependents.”\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Erdogan referring to Turkish Cypriot activists who demonstrated in occupied Cyprus with signs reading:\n\n“F–k you Turkey… We do not want you, your money, your soldiers or your bureaucrats.”\n\nHurriyet Daily News, 18 July 2011\n\n“You don’t have babies and you also oppose us sending people [from Turkey to the occupied territory]. If you don’t want us to send people, you need to have babies.”\n\nTurkish prime minister Erdogan, responding to complaints by Turkish Cypriots on the issue of Turkey’s continuing colonisation of occupied Cyprus with Turkish nationals, a violation of the Geneva convention, July 2011\n\n“What happened in Cyprus with the Annan plan in reality has nothing to do with the Turkish Cypriots, but the main issue was Turkey’s accession into the European Union and the pseudo-state was used as pawn.”\n\nEser Karakas, Professor at Bahcesehir University, Turkey, as quoted in ‘Haravgi’ (Greek Cypriot) newspaper, 27 October 2004\n\n“The latest version of the Annan plan is a success for Turkish foreign policy and the Turkish government. With the latest form of the plan, the Turkish Cypriots gain many rights which they were unable to get even with the London and Zurich agreements [in 1959-60]. The Turkish side has also had some objections to this [latest version], but the Greek Cypriots are objecting to nearly all of it. The Annan plan in this form should be signed immediately.”\n\nFatih Altayli, Hurriyet newspaper, on proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, March 2004\n\n“The Turkish side believes that most of its demands are satisfied.”\n\nMehmet Ali Birand in Posta newspaper, on proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, March 2004\n\n“It’s clear that the Greek Cypriots are uncomfortable about the result… On the Turkish side, it’s observed that there is a cautious waiting instead of an atmosphere of incredible satisfaction and victory.”\n\nFikret Bila, Milliyet newspaper, on proposed UN-sponsored Annan Plan, March 2004\n\n“Even if there was not one single Muslim Turk over there [in Cyprus], Turkey would have to maintain a Cyprus question. No country could possibly be indifferent to an island like this, placed in the heart of its vital space.”\n\nAhmet Davutoglu, Turkish foreign minister, ‘Strategic Depth’, 2001\n\n“No country could possibly be indifferent to an island like this, positioned at the heart of its Lebensraum [living space]. The same applies to the Dodecanese islands… which continue to retain their importance for Turkey… so Turkey is obliged from a strategic point of view to take an interest in Cyprus, regardless of any human factor.”\n\nAhmet Davutoglu, Turkish Prime Minister, in ‘Strategic Depth’, 2001\n\n“Once you [Turkish Cypriots] quit, you renounce your rights. There is no shortage of replacements. Don’t you worry, we would never leave those lands empty. For every Cypriot Turk leaving the island, we will send a Turk from Turkey.”\n\nFormer Turkish Foreign Minister Soysal addressing Turkish Cypriots in London, 1996\n\n“We will break the hands of anyone who touches our flag… touching our flag is akin to touching one of our women.”\n\nTansu Ciller, Turkish Foreign Minister following the murder of Solomos Solomou by Turkish security forces as he attempted to remove the Turkish flag of occupation in Cyprus, 1996\n\n“…we are being held back by democracy and human rights.”\n\nTurkish Deputy Chief of Staff, General Ahmet Corecki, on Turkey’s attempts to crush Kurdish movement, July 1995\n\n“…the moment I set foot here [occupied area of Cyprus], I felt myself in one of the provinces, towns and villages of Turkey. There is no difference.\n\n“It is possible that there are people who will take advantage of my visit here to make a great fuss. Do not pay any attention to them. They have always been brawlers. We have recognised their ancestors in the Aegean, we have recognised their ancestors in Smyrna, we have recognised their ancestors in Dumluplinar; for this reason we have never attributed any importance to them, there is no importance, let them saw whatever they want; were they able to stop my visit? I am here in front of you.”\n\nOzal, Turkish prime minister, in occupied Nicosia, July 1986\n\n“I believe it was first during the Ottoman period and later under the British rule that the Greeks immigrated to the island.”\n\nOzal, Turkish prime minister, International Herald Tribune, 2 June 1986\n\n“They say we do not covet the territories lying outside our nation’s sovereign territory. This is wrong. All the nations have their great ideology. In that case, what is the Turkish army seeking in Cyprus? Cyprus does not lie within the frontiers of our national territory.”\n\nProfessor Kuran, at the ‘Turkey’s problems’ symposium, referring to the presence of Turkey’s troops on the territory of the Republic of Cyprus, 2 February 1986\n\n“Speaking from a purely strategic point of view we could say that for Turkey’s security, a safe Cyprus is a Cyprus which would be, in its entirety, under Turkish control.”\n\nA Gurkan, Turkish journalist and historian, in Kibris Postasi, 20 December 1983\n\n“The explosion sparked off a night of riots in Nicosia. Turkish Cypriots burned and looted Greek shops and homes. Soon came counter-attacks and the fighting spread around the island. A friend of mine, whose name must still be kept secret, was to confess to me that he had put this little bomb in the doorway in order to create an atmosphere of tension so that people would know that the Turkish Cypriots mattered.”\n\nEmin Dirvana, former Turkish diplomat. ‘End of Empire: Cyprus, Britain’s Grim Legacy’ ITV documentary, 22 July 1984\n\n“One point we should never forget is that the intervention of Turkey in Cyprus was not effected solely for the ‘blue eyes’ of the Turkish Cypriot community… it also intervened moved by consideration of its own strategic interest.”\n\nMehmet Ali Birand, Turkish newspaper Millyet, 13 March 1984\n\n“Cyprus is an island which pierces the middle of Turkey like a dagger. It is extremely vital from the viewpoint of our security. It is extremely vital from the viewpoint of our security. The island should not be in enemy hands. The existence of Turks in northern Cyprus is a guarantee in this direction.”\n\nOzal, Prime Minister of Turkey (referring to the illegal ‘UDI’ of the occupied area of November 1983), Millyet, 1983\n\n“The islands of Limnos and Lesvos… are lands necessary to us not only as part of the heritage of the Ottoman state but for our security as well. We want these islands…”\n\nBurhan Felek, president of Journalists’ Union of Istanbul, Milliyet newspaper, 3 February 1982\n\n“…we are not dealing here with a mere duty but with a mission. Our mission is to make Cyprus our motherland.”\n\nIhsan Sabri Caglayangil, Turkish Foreign Minister, 1980\n\n“Cyprus is valuable as a right arm for a country interested in its own defence of for its own expansionist aims if it harbours such aims. If we don’t keep in mind this strategic importance of Cyprus we cannot understand the peace operation of 20 July or rather it is impossible to understand the whole Cyprus crisis… ”\n\nMany states, to a certain extent because it suits their interests, want to see the Cyprus problem as our desire to protect the Turkish community on the island. Whereas the actual problem is the security of 45 million Turks in the motherland together with the Turks in the island and the maintenance of the balance in the Middle East.”\n\nTuran Gunes, who was Minster of Foreign Affairs of Turkey during the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Hurriyet newspaper, 20 July 1980\n\n“The Turkish Armed Forces have neve been pushed out by pen from the place they have entered with bayonet.”\n\nIhsan Sabri Caglayangil, Turkish Foreign Minister, 1980\n\n“All the Aegean islands off the Turkish mainland, including the Dodecanese islands, must belong to Turkey.”\n\nAlparslan Turkes, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, March 1976\n\n“Cyprus is the first step towards the Aegean.”\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Melih Esenbel, 22 January 1975\n\n“Half the Aegean belongs to us. This is what the world must know. If the honour and interests of the Turkish nation are attacked we shall crush the head of the enemy.”\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Sadi Irmak\n\n“I was informed that on 7 June 1958 a bomb had been planted in the Turkish press office in Nicosia by persons who, as was later established, had nothing to do with the Greek Cypriots. The Turks of Nicosia were then incited to be overwhelmed by holy indignation and perpetrated acts similar to those committed on 6 and 7 September 1955 in Istanbul.”\n\nFormer Turkish diplomat, Emin Dirvana, in Turkish newspaper Milliyet, 15 June 1964\n\n“Cyprus will be divided into two sections, one of which will join Turkey.”\n\nKemal Satir, Vice-president of Turkey, 1964\n\n“The radical solution… would be to cede one part of Cyprus to Greece and other, closest to the Turkish Asiatic coast, to Turkey.”\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Erkin, June 1964\n\n“Denktash has also accused me of not allowing the memory of the Turks who fell in 1958 to be honoured and flags to be hoisted at half-mast. I feel ashamed on his behalf because he distorts the truth to such an extent, I am sorry but I must give an answer. The Turks of Cyprus honour the memory of their dead on 28 January. On that day in 1958, a number of Turkish Cypriots were killed by in a clash with the British. On that day I too attended the ceremony with all the staff of the embassy and the contingent officers. Denktash, however, wanted also the 7 June to be celebrated. Dr Kuchuk was hesitant and came to consult me. I was informed that on 7 June, 1958, a bomb had been planted in the Turkish Press Office in Nicosia by persons, who, as was established later, had nothing to do with the Greek Cypriots. The Turks of Nicosia were then incited ‘to be overwhelmed by their holy indignation’ and perpetrated acts similar to those committed on the 6 and 7 September, 1955, in Istanbul.”\n\nEmin Dirvana, Turkish ambassador to Cyprus, Milliyet newspaper, 15 May 1964\n\n“The importance of Cyprus to Turkey does not arise from a single cause; it is a necessary which emanates from the exigencies of history, geography, economy and military strategy, from the right to existence and security, which is the most sacred of every state, in short, from the very nature of things.”\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Zorlu, 1955\n\n“The turn of Cyprus is yet to come.”\n\nMustapha Kemal ‘Ataturk’ on Turkey’s colonisation and annexation of Alexandretta in Syria, 1939\n\n“The Turk is the only master in his country. Those who are not pure Turks have one right in this country: The right to be servants, the right to be slaves.”\n\nTurkish Minister of Justice, Milliet newspaper, 30 September 1930\n\n“In case of the smallest resistance, every soldier must perform his duty to murder these men in large numbers. The fatherland orders so. You must not neglect to perform your duty: every soldier is obliged to kill four to five Greeks for our country’s grandeur. Every soldier is obliged to carry out the contents of this order.”\n\nThe order of Nourredin, Chief of the Turkish army in Smyrna (now renamed Izmir by Turkey) for the slaughter of the indigenous Greek population, 1922\n\n“We have driven out our Greek subjects and done everything to uproot them, as well as the Armenians. To this end we applied methods similar to those used in the Middle Ages.”\n\nTurkish journalist Edip Hanem, 1918\n\n“The extermination of the Christian [Greek and Armenian] population was an unforgettable crime… It was a crime committed for no reason.”\n\nTurkish Senator Damad Ferid Pasha, 1918\n\nTurkish Cypriot\n\n“The fascist oppression imposed on Turkish citizens criticising the violation of human rights, democracy and freedom is now also being directed towards the EU citizens living in the [Turkish occupied] north of the island… I call upon you to take action on the matter of the oppression of the Turkish Cypriots.”\n\nSener Elcil, head of Turkish Cypriot teachers’ union, in letter to President of European Parliament Tajani, May 2017\n\n“Who showed as an excuse this coup, interfered militarily in Cyprus and occupied half of the island? Guarantor Turkey! Who distributed the property of the Greek Cypriots, whom he sent away, to the population he brought and settled from Turkey? Guarantor Turkey! Who boasts of changing all the international balances without withdrawing a single soldier, without giving a handful of land? Guarantor Turkey! Who does not recognise and ignores the Republic of Cyprus, which is recognised by the entire world? Guarantor Turkey! And finally who remained only a spectator to all these disgraces, to these illegal fait accompli, who said nothing against the island being divided in two, like a watermelon, by Turkey with the use of force of weapons and with costing the lives of thousands of people and [who said nothing] to the establishment of an illegal state dependent on Turkey and therefore who became an accomplice to the war and the crime against humanity that caused bloodshed on the island? Guarantor Britain!”\n\nColumnist Mehmet Levent under the title ‘Guarantorship’ in Turkish Cypriot daily Afrika, responds to a statement by President Erdogan who insists that Turkey will not abandon its position as ‘guarantor’ in Cyprus, 29 May 2015\n\n“From the very first day of our publication, we have been writing that we are under Turkey’s occupation and that we have to seriously struggle against this occupation. However, there are still some people who do not accept this. They treat a puppet government as a real government and a puppet parliament as a real parliament. That is why they ask why officials from Turkey are heading some of our institutions, as if this is something new… These questions should have been asked a long time ago.”\n\nNewspaper article ‘But you still do not accept the occupation, do you?’ in Turkish Cypriot daily Afrika, occupied Cyprus, 4 March 2015\n\n“Occupier Turkey get out of Cyprus! …Ankara get your hands off the Turkish Cypriots!”\n\nTurkish Cypriot slogans at anti- Turkey demonstration in occupied Cyprus, 7 April 2011\n\n“They placed barbed wire between the north and the south. They did that because they considered one side as the enemy… These are our enemies. Those who are afraid of the people…”\n\n“I am here because they consider the Turkish Cypriot community as nonexistent.”\n\n“As Turkish Cypriots we want to recover our will from those who have usurped it so that we will not disappear… We live in a fascist establishment… We seek the creation of a democratic establishment… and as a continuation that we will reunite Cyprus.”\n\n“Turkey… has enslaved us. It first brought its army and then brought its population. It grabbed the properties of the people. It created refugees… the ‘Turkish Republic of Cyprus’ is nothing more than Turkey’s back yard. They interfere with our flag, the flag of the Republic of Cyprus, the most beautiful flag in the world.”\n\n“Let the occupation come to an end… I only hold the flag and identity of my country [Republic of Cyprus]. Let the occupation come to an end… We don’t want Turkey here… We want a free reunited Cyprus… This is my second flag. The first one was grabbed off me by the occupation ‘police’… ”\n\nTurkish Cypriot speakers demonstrating against Turkey and its puppet regime in occupied Cyprus, 7 April 2011\n\n“One night a bulldozer and truck came and the [Greek Cypriot] mass grave was emptied. They used the guise of having a [Turkish] ‘military exercise’ to cover up the emptying of the mass grave… they emptied the grave and loaded the remains on the truck and the truck went away… Then came the excavation team of the Cyprus Missing Persons Committee and dug the mass grave… They would only find some knee caps, small bones, some teeth but not the actual remains… The mass grave had been emptied already…”\n\nRemarks made to investigative reporter Sevgul Uludag by a Turkish Cypriot at Kornokipos village, in occupied Cyprus\n\n“Erdogan is no guest, but the landlord.”\n\nRepresentative of Turkey’s puppet regime on the Turkish Prime Minister’s visit to occupied Cyprus, in Turkish Cypriot daily Halkin Sesi, 19 July 2011\n\n“I only hold the flag and identity of my country [Republic of Cyprus].

There is strong evidence that the British government of the day deliberately encouraged an indifferent Turkey to take a more active interest, as a useful counterweight in the struggle against the Greeks, One of the most violent expressions of this artificially contrived Turkish indignation was on the night of 6th-7th September 1955, when a terrifying Turkish mob destroyed quantities of Greek property in Istanbul. It should be noted that at the Yassiada trials 1960 evidence was given by defence witnesses that the Turkish government had been put up to staging a Cyprus demonstration by the then British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan, but that the demonstration, mismanaged by Menderes, had degenerated into an uncontrollable riot.”\n\nDavid Hotham, ‘The Turks’, 1972\n\n“…The various 1960 agreements …constituted an integral settlement, in effect a package deal.

Moreover, anything which called the 1960 settlement as a whole into question could expose us to pressure on our moral (as distinct from legal right to hang on to the Areas. d) Whether or not we have a direct interest in maintaining the Treaty of Guarantee, we could not openly abandon it without gravely upsetting Turkey.”\n\nSteele (legal advisers, FCO) to Fearn, 10 February 1971, Memorandum, PRO FCO 9/1374/, file WSC3/548/5. See ‘Cyprus: a Modern History’, p.93\n\n“The welfare, and indeed the lives of our people, depends on Cyprus as a protective guard and staging post to take care of those interests, above all oil. This is not imperialism. It should be the plain duty of any government and we intend to discharge it.”\n\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden, 1960, regarding Britain’s invitation of Turkey to a tripartite conference on the future of Cyprus in 1955 to counter Greek Cypriots claims for enosis\n\n“Whether or not the Turkish Government have lately been specifically encouraging this idea of migration, it seems to be a logical outcome of the extremely hard-headed and ruthless tactics, which they have followed in support of an all-out policy of partition, since the announcement in May last of Her Majesty’s Government’s intention to produce a new plan for Cyprus. These tactics have been, as you know, by whipping up the Turkish Cypriot community, to create a situation between them and the Greek Cypriots of which the only possible solution would be partition…”\n\nBritish ambassador in ankara, Colonial Office Document to Foreign Office, 1 September 1958\n\n“The Turks – I am putting their view – regard Cyprus as an extension of the Anatolian Plain, a kind of offshore island with vital significance for their defence and their security. They say – this has been their argument up to now – that the Turkish-Cypriot community must not be ruled by a Greek-Cypriot community and they have advocated the physical separation of the two communities by means of a territorial partition.”\n\nPrime Minister Harold Macmillan MP, parliamentary statement delivered, 26 June 1958\n\n“For some days prior to 12th June, in fact on the 7th June, intercommunal feeling was running very high in the island and there had been many instances of attacks by Turks particuarly in Nicosia, upon members of the Greek community and upon Greek property.\n\nThe attack was of a most savaege nature and the unjuries inflicted indicate an extraordinary blood lust.”\n\nChief Justice of Cyprus (on the murder of eight Greek Cypriots and the serious wounding of five near the village of Geunyeli on 12 June 1958. The Greeks were abandoned in the area by the British military, where they were then attacked by Turkish Cypriot extremists), June 1958\n\n“I could not help reflecting wryly that had we been honest enough to admit the Greek nature of Cyprus in the beginning, it might never have been necessary to abandon the island or fight for it. Now, it was too late!”\n\nLawrence Durrell, Director of Public Relations for the British colonial government in Cyprus, 1957, in his book ‘Bitter Lemons’\n\n“… a claim by 18 per cent of a population to share political power equally with 80 per cent… But can Cyprus be organised as a federation in this way? …I find myself baffled in the attempt to visualise how an effective executive government for Cyprus is to be thrown up by a system in which political power is to remain permanently divided… Either there is stagnation in political life, with the frustration that accompanies it, or some small minority group acquires an artificial weight by being able to hold the balance between the two main parties …it cannot be in the interests of Cyprus as a whole that the constitution should be formed on the basis of equal political representation for the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities …To give an equal political strength in a unitary State to two communities which have such a marked inequality in numbers – an inequality which so far as signs go is as likely to increase as decrease – is to deny to the majority of the population over the whole field of self government the power to have its will reflected in effective action.”\n\nLord Radcliffe, ‘Constitutional Proposals for Cyprus’, 1956\n\n“Was Cyprus ever Greek? To cast doubt on the desire of Cypriots for union with Greece British Tory papers pretend that Cyprus was never part of Greece… the islanders have been predominantly Greek-speaking for over 2,500 years. Cyprus was Greek before England was English.\n\nFor centuries Cyprus was part of the Greek-speaking Alexandrian and Byzantine Empires – that is to say it was under Greek rule.\n\nIt was conquered by the Turks in 1570 but the islanders rose against the Turks in 1764, 1804 and 1821, when many islanders were massacred by the Turkish rulers. Despite all tribulations the islanders have remained Greek in speech and culture.”\n\nThe Educational Commentary on Current Affairs, issued by the Daily Worker in association with the Marx Memorial Library, 25 September 1955\n\n“…it has always been understood and agreed that there are certain territories in the Commonwealth which, owing to their particular circumstances, can never expect to be fully independent… there are some territories which cannot expect to be that. I am not going as far as that this afternoon, but I have said that the question of the abrogation of British sovereignty [in Cyprus] cannot arise — that British sovereignty will remain.”\n\nMinister of State Hopkinson, House of Commons, 28 July 1954\n\n“The lowest estimate of lives lost given by the refugees, places the total at one hundred and twenty thousand.”\n\nLondon Daily Chronicle, regarding the slaughter of the Greek and Armenian inhabitants of Smyrna, 18 September 1922\n\n“…the Ottomanisation of all Turkish citizens, which never succeeded through persuasion, had to be done by the force of arms.”\n\nThe Times, 3 October 1911\n\n“I think it is only natural that the Cypriot people, who are of Greek descent, should regard their incorporation with what may be called their mother-country as an ideal to be earnestly, devoutly, and fervently cherished. Such a feeling is an example of the patriotic devotion which so nobly characterises the Greek nation.”\n\nWinston Churchill, 17 October 1907\n\n“Wherever they [the Turks] went a br"
