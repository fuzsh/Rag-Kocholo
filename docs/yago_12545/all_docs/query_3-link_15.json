        "text": "Saw the UCLA restoration in theaters. An unorthodox Valentine's Day watch.\n\nWhile it's not nearly as good as M, it still stands on its own as a more female-centric version of the story. I think the film has some trouble with its characterization (particularly of the prosecutor) but the acting across the board is extremely impressive. I believe this is the first classic Argentine movie I've seen, and I'll certainly be seeking out more work from everyone involved, though Olga Zubarry and Nathán Pinzón were the standouts (and I'm so curious about his earlier work as a comedian).\n\nI also found it interesting in comparison to M, which is surprisingly much darker than this film. I did enjoy most of the changes they made, it made the story stand on its own without relying too much on the original, though they of course recycle many of the best scenes (and the iconic music motif).\n\nFlicker Alley recently had a delightful sale of its film noir movies. This film, described as \"a reimagining of Fritz Lang's M,\" hooked me immediately. I was so excited to see it that I was waiting for the postal truck, and raced down to my home theater with my package soon after it arrived.\n\nTHE BLACK VAMPIRE truly astonished me. There are a number of significant \"references\" in the show, such as the most obvious one which has the murderer whistling \"In the Hall of the Mountain King.\" However, it is probably impossible for any classic film fan to watch the concluding chase and not think of THE THIRD MAN. Having read books about the \"between War\" years in Germany,…\n\nI am barely a part of your life\n\nMore than you imagine\n\nAn exceptional reimagining of Fritz Lang's M (I've never seen it) with a much more balanced cast, including many women playing leading roles. A child killer is on the loose, and while a detective is trying to put the pieces together, a nightclub singer, who's simply trying to support her young daughter financially, gets mixed up in what the locals have dubbed, The Black Vampire.\n\nExtremely stylish noir with hints of horror, in a similar way that you'd call Night of the Hunter a horror film, The Black Vampire is hard to look away from, as you cringe just waiting for the films next move. The characters are complexed and easy to get lost in. If you're a student of film, you don't get to graduate until you've seen this."
