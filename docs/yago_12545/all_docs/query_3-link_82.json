        "text": "Rafael Viñoly Beceiro (born 1944) is an Uruguayan architect.\n\nLife and career\n\nViñoly was born in Montevideo, Uruguay to Román Viñoly Barreto (a film and theater director) and Maria Beceiro (a mathematics teacher). He grew up and was educated in Argentina. He attended the University of Buenos Aires, receiving a Diploma in Architecture in 1968 and a Master of Architecture from the School of Architecture and Urbanism in 1969.\n\nIn 1964, he formed the “Manteola-Petchersky-Sanchez Gomez-Santos-Solsona-Viñoly” Estudio de Arquitectura (architectural firm) with six associates. This practice would eventually become one of the largest architectural practices in South America, completing many significant commissions in a very short time.\n\nIn 1978 Viñoly and his family relocated to the United States. For a brief period he served as a guest lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, settling permanently in New York City in 1979. He founded the firm Rafael Viñoly Architects PC in 1983. His first major project in New York was the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, which was completed in 1988. In 1989, he won an international competition to design the Tokyo International Forum. Completed in 1996, many people consider this building to be the most important cultural complex in Japan. His firm’s design was one of the finalists in the World Trade Center design competition (see THINK Team).\n\nDuring the course of his forty-plus year career, Viñoly has practiced in the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.\n\nViñoly is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, an International Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and a member of the Japan Institute of Architects as well as the Sociedad Central de Arquitectos.\n\nHonours and awards\n\nDesign Honour, Salvadori Center, 2007\n\nInternational Fellow, The Royal Institute of British Architects, 2006\n\nNational Design Award Finalist, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2004\n\nNeutra Medal for Professional Excellence: In recognition for his contributions to the Environmental Design Profession and in honor of Modernist architect Richard Neutra, 2000.\n\nHonourary Doctorate, University of Maryland, 1997\n\nMedal of Honour, American Institute of Architects, New York City Chapter, 1995\n\nNational Academician, The National Academy, 1994\n\nFellow, American Institute of Architects, 1993\n\nDesign philosophy\n\n“Architecture is a dialogue with the forces of life. As a major form of social intervention, its essential responsibility is to elevate the public realm.” In every project, I seek to maximize the opportunity for civic investment with a goal of forming iconic works that fulfill the needs of the client. For me, this makes architecture the most unique form of artistic endeavor.\n\nMy design philosophy is rooted in the development of architectural ideas that are powerful, distinctive, and relevant to the specifics of both program and context. This assures that each project receives a unique interpretation rather than a premeditated solution based on a specific architectural vocabulary. I also focus on the integration of structural systems that complement the design idea, ensuring the synthesis of engineering with architectural form.\n\nMy longstanding commitment to design excellence, practiced over 45 years, is particularly evident in the success of our firm’s many civic initiatives, which demonstrate our ability to creatively integrate buildings into contextual urban sites and to work within larger master plans. However, our global work spans nearly every architectural typology, each one delivered with equal passion and commitment to purpose.\n\nBuildings\n\nCompleted\n\nLehman College Physical Education Facility, Bronx, New York, 1994\n\nTokyo International Forum, Tokyo, Japan, 1996\n\nBronx Housing Court, Bronx, New York, 1997\n\nPrinceton University Stadium, Princeton, New Jersey, 1998\n\nJongno Tower in Seoul, South Korea, 1999\n\nColumbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Palisades, New York, 2000\n\nThe Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 2001\n\nVan Andel Institute, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 2002\n\nBrown University, Watson Institute for International Studies, Providence, Rhode Island, 2002\n\nPennsylvania State University, Information Sciences and Technology Building, State College, Pennsylvania, 2003\n\nDavid L.

In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara’s south-facing tower could make swimmers in the hotel pool uncomfortably warm, as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the “Vdara death ray”. During an unusually warm 2013 summer in London, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts on a parked car as well as scorching the carpet of a nearby barber shop.\n\n20 Fenchurch Street is a commercial skyscraper in London that takes its name from its address on Fenchurch Street, in the historic City of London financial district. It has been nicknamed The Walkie-Talkie because of its distinctive shape. Construction was completed in spring 2014, and the top-floor ‘sky garden’ was opened in January 2015. The 34-storey building is 160 m (525 ft) tall, making it the fifth-tallest building in the City of London.\n\nDesigned by architect Rafael Viñoly and costing over £200 million, 20 Fenchurch Street features a highly distinctive top-heavy form which appears to burst upward and outward. A large viewing deck, bar and restaurants are included on the top three floors; these are open to the public.\n\nThe tower was originally proposed at nearly 200 m (656 ft) tall but its design was scaled down after concerns about its visual impact on the nearby St Paul’s Cathedral and Tower of London. It was subsequently approved in 2006 with the revised height. Even after the height reduction there were continued concerns from heritage groups about its impact on the surrounding area. The project was consequently the subject of a public inquiry; in 2007 this ruled in the developers’ favour and the building was granted full planning permission.\n\nIn their preliminary results for 2007, joint-developers Land Securities and Canary Wharf Group said 20 Fenchurch Street would be completed in 2011, however in 2009 during the depths of the Great Recession, the estimated completion was changed to 2014.\n\nPrevious building\n\nThe previous building at 20 Fenchurch Street was 91 m (299 ft) tall with 25 storeys and was built in 1968 by Land Securities. The architect was William H. Rogers.\n\nThe building was formerly occupied by Dresdner Kleinwort and was notable for being one of the first tall buildings in the City of London, and for its distinctive roof. It was one of the towers nearest to the River Thames when viewed from the southern end of London Bridge.\n\nIn 2007, one of the upper floors was used in the drama series Party Animals.\n\nDemolition of the previous building was completed in 2008. Despite the top-down method of construction, the old building was not demolished from the bottom-up, as a temporary structure was built, allowing Keltbray, the demolition contractor, to demolish the building from the top down.\n\nDesign\n\nThe new tower at 20 Fenchurch Street was designed by an Uruguayan architect Rafael Viñoly in a postmodern style. The top-heavy design is partly intended to maximise floor space towards the top of the building, where rent is typically higher.\n\nThe building utilises double and triple-glazed panelised aluminium cladding on its exterior.\n\nThe botanical gardens at the top of the building were claimed to be London’s highest public park, but since opening there has been debate about whether the gardens can truly be described as a ‘park’. The City of London’s former chief planner Peter Rees, who approved the structure, said: “I think calling it a sky garden is perhaps misleading. If people [are] expecting to visit it as an alternative to Kew, then they will be disappointed.”\n\nThe gardens span the top three floors, are accessible by two express lifts, and include a viewing area, terrace, bar and two restaurants. Fourteen double-deck lifts (seven low-rise up to the 20th floor, seven high-rise above the 20th floor) serve the main office floors of the building.\n\nThe south side of the structure is ventilated externally to improve efficiency and decrease solar gain, whilst the east and west faces incorporate extensive solar shading. There is a southern entrance in addition to the main northern entrance set back from Fenchurch Street.\n\nConstruction\n\nIn January 2009, Canary Wharf Contractors began piling on the site of 20 Fenchurch Street, signalling the start of construction of The Walkie-Talkie. Piling and ground works were completed in June 2009.\n\nIn January 2011, work at the basement level of the tower began. By the end of October 2011, the building was rising above street-level. December 2011 saw the tower’s core begin to rise. The concrete core was topped out in March 2012 and by July the structural steelwork was under way around the core. Structural steelwork topped out in December 2012.\n\nFire protection contractor Sharpfibre Ltd began applying fire protection to the structural steelwork in December 2012, completing in March 2013. Cementitious spray was applied to the steelwork, which was supplied directly to the entire building using a purpose-built mixing and pumping station located on the ground floor.\n\nThe building completed to shell and floor in April 2014 and the first tenants began moving into the building from May 2014 prior to final completion in August of that year.\n\nSolar glare problem\n\nDuring the building’s construction, it was discovered that for a period of up to two hours each day if the sun shines directly onto the building, it acts as a concave mirror and focuses light onto the streets to the south. Spot temperature readings including up to 91 °C (196 °F) and 117 °C (243 °F) were observed during the summer of 2013, when the reflection of a beam of light up to six times brighter than direct sunlight shining onto the streets beneath damaged vehicles parked on the street nearby, including one on Eastcheap whose owner was paid £946 by the developers for repairs to melted bodywork. The reflection also burned or scorched the doormat of a shop in the affected area. The media responded by dubbing the building the “Walkie Scorchie” and “Fryscraper”.\n\nIn September 2013, the developers issued a statement saying that the City of London Corporation had approved plans to erect temporary screening on the streets to prevent similar incidents, and that they were also “evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future”. In May 2014, it was announced that a permanent awning would be installed on the south side of the higher floors of the tower.\n\nThe building’s architect, Rafael Viñoly, also designed the Vdara hotel in Las Vegas which reportedly has a similar sunlight reflection problem that some employees called the “Vdara death ray”. The glass has since been covered with a non-reflective film.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, Viñoly said that horizontal sun-louvers on the south side that had been intended to prevent this problem were removed at some point during the planning process. While he conceded that there had been “a lot of mistakes” with the building, he agreed with the building’s developers that the sun was too high in the sky on that particular day. “[I] didn’t realise it was going to be so hot,” he said, suggesting that global warming was at fault. “When I first came to London years ago, it wasn’t like this … Now you have all these sunny days.”\n\nTenancy\n\nIn June 2012 the insurer Markel Corporation signed a tenancy agreement with the developers to move into 20 Fenchurch Street upon its completion. Markel, currently based on Leadenhall Street since 2001, was the first confirmed tenant of the new tower and will occupy the 25th, 26th and 27th floors.\n\nAnother insurer, Kiln Group, announced in September 2012 that it had agreed to become the building’s second confirmed tenant and Ascot Underwriting followed in November 2012. Other insurance companies that have taken space in the building include RSA, Tokio Marine, CNA Financial, Allied World, Liberty Mutual‘s European operations and Harry Townsend Corp.\n\nOther lettings have been agreed with Vanquis Bank, Jane Street Capital, and lawyers DWF. Vinson & Elkins has signed a lease to take a floor of the building ahead of a summer 2015 move-in, meaning 90% of the available space is leased.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1487\n\n8481\n\nStuart Shield Garden & Landscape Design\n\n70\n\n19\n\n9949\n\n14.0\n\nNormal\n\n0\n\nfalse\n\nfalse\n\nfalse\n\nEN-GB\n\nJA\n\nX-NONE\n\n/* Style Definitions */\n\ntable.MsoNormalTable\n\n{mso-style-name:”Table Normal”;\n\nmso-tstyle-rowband-size:0;\n\nmso-tstyle-colband-size:0;\n\nmso-style-noshow:yes;\n\nmso-style-priority:99;\n\nmso-style-parent:””;\n\nmso-padding-alt:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt;\n\nmso-para-margin:0cm;\n\nmso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt;\n\nmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\nfont-size:12.0pt;\n\nfont-family:Cambria;\n\nmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria;\n\nmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\nmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;\n\nmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;}"
