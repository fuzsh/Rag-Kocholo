        "text": "It’s Christmas Eve, a time for carols and holiday tunes to fill the ears. If I’m not in the right mood to hear them, I scowl at every alternately sugary and solemn note. So why another batch of movie musical reviews? Because as I made clear in those previous posts about musicals (first, second, third, and fourth), I tend to need to be in the right mood to appreciate them, too. Also, I just happened to have a bunch of them ready to go, so why not?\n\n2021 has been an inordinately fertile year for the genre. By my count, I’ve seen eight such films released in the last 360-ish days (including a couple more I haven’t posted reviews of yet), plus another couple I’ve yet to see, like Cyrano, which won’t be opening in my neck of the woods until next year, more’s the pity. As far as major English-language releases go, that’s about as dense as it’s been since the 60s. I would wonder if this glut of song-and-dance spectacles is indicative of a sea change in the industry…but a lot of the titles have proven to be financial underperformers thus far, so I wouldn’t bet on that (yet).\n\nAnyway, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, and warm up those vocal cords if you plan to sing along. Especially if you don’t know the lyrics by heart.\n\nAnchors Aweigh (1945)\n\nDirected by George Sidney. Starring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, Pamela Britton, José Iturbi, Dean Stockwell, Billy Gilbert, Henry O’Neill, “Rags” Ragland.\n\nOverlong mixed-bag movie musical of two Navy buddies on shore leave in the City of Angels, looking for a good time and (hopefully) a little female companionship. Several of the songs, which include “If You Know Susie,” “I Fall in Love Too Easily,” and the title tune, along with Kelly’s nimble dance sequences, keep things entertaining on balance, but much of the linking material and mundane romantic storylines should have been given the ol’ heave-ho. Kelly’s centerpiece—a trip into a fantasy world where he brings joy to a sad kingdom by dancing with Jerry the Mouse—is a pure delight. Iturbi plays himself and tickles the ivories a few times. Oscar winner for Georgie Stoll’s music score. Stockwell’s film debut.\n\n60/100\n\nAnnette (2021)\n\nDirected by Leos Karax. Starring Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, Simon Helberg, Devyn McDowell. [R]\n\nLeos Carax’s anti-musical rock opera, penned by Ron & Russell Mael of cult pop duo, Sparks, is an ungainly contraption that operates on borderline avant-garde wavelengths in both structural and emotional terms. It’s cluttered with so many highly-questionable ingredients, that it was almost destined to fail for anyone not predisposed to accept everything at surreal, experimental face value: a child performer represented until the finale by an ugly marionette puppet, fantasies of Me Too media accusations and news reporter interludes, Driver doing “edgy” stand-up comedy, a smorgasbord of bluntly underlining lyrics that hold the audience’s hand through every dismal fabrication of the dizzy narrative, and so on. The actors try, but their awkwardness is palpable (even Cotlliard, whose solemnly ethereal opera singer can’t glow bright enough), and the artfully-staged production elements combined with the woozy editing and camerawork produces some memorable imagery, but the thin semi-operatic tragedy is as unwelcoming as it is unrelenting, and plays out over such an arduous length, that its unbalanced extravagance turns wearisome instead of exhilarating. Driver also co-produced.\n\n43/100\n\nDancer in the Dark (2000)\n\nDirected by Lars von Trier. Starring Björk, Peter Stormare, David Morse, Catherine Deneuve, Cara Seymour, Siobhan Fallon, Vladica Kostic, Željko Ivanek, Jean-Marc Barr, Stellan Skarsgård, Joel Grey, Vincent Paterson. [R]\n\nBold, provocative musical melodrama from von Trier won’t be for everyone, but at least it can’t be derided as timid or forgettable. A myopic Czech immigrant (Björk) saves every cent she can to pay for an operation to prevent her son from going blind, but things only get worse for her after the money goes missing and she confronts the policeman (Morse) who owns the land on which she rents her home. She breaks up the misery of her life by taking part in a local production of The Sound of Music and imagining that her own life is a musical, slipping into expressive daydreams of singing and dancing and anxiety release. Filmed in a way that closely (but not strictly) follows the Dogme 95 rules, there’s an opportunity missed here—as a break from the spare, naturally-lit handheld camerawork throughout the dramatic portions of the film that emphasize claustrophobic close-ups, what if the song-and-dance fantasias had been given a snazzy, polished treatment to both stand further apart from bleak reality and mimic the movie musicals that influenced her imagination? Instead, although these portions tend to be a little more fixed and colorful, they still look like the home videos of someone who happens to know how to wield a camcorder. The film is a grueling challenge, to be sure, but also strikingly dissident and original, and even at its most reckless, it’s always anchored by Björk’s tremendous performance, her pain a remedy to the artistry-as-truth mirage. She also co-wrote all of the songs (among them “Cvalda” and Oscar nominee “I’ve Seen It All”), which are certainly an upgrade on typical movie musical fare. Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes.\n\n88/100\n\nJersey Boys (2014)\n\nDirected by Clint Eastwood. Starring John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Erich Bergen, Michael Lomenda, Mike Doyle, Christopher Walken, Kathrine Narducci, Renée Marino, Freya Tingley, Lou Volpe, Rob Marnell. [R]\n\nDud adaptation of the hit Broadway musical that shows how four working-class, wiseguy-adjacent young men from New Jersey hit the big time in the 1960s as pop group The Four Seasons. Long and predictable (even to those who wouldn’t know “Big Girls Don’t Cry” from Vivaldi), with a steady stream of hit songs to perk things up every now and then, but the execution resembles a perfunctory jukebox checklist far more often than a celebration of Bob Gaudio’s punchy songwriting and frontman Frankie Valli’s malleable falsetto. Cycles through not just a plethora of music biopic clichés, but also enough “Joisey”/Italian-American stereotypes that one can be forgiven for expecting every conversation to eventually bring up “gabagool.” Persuasive period detail is hampered by the desaturated artificiality of Tom Stern’s digital photography. Each of the “boys” breaks the fourth wall now and again to address the audience (in the middle of a dramatic scene); this may be more dynamic than a routine voiceover, but its distracting theatricality never works quite right in this medium. Despite a few carryovers from the stage musical cast (including Young, who played Valli in the original Broadway ensemble), the only actor who’s both memorable and effective is Walken, playing mobster “Gyp” DeCarlo, who acts as their consigliere-slash-enthusiast (sadly, he’s absent for more than an hour in the middle). The real-life Valli and Gaudio each co-executive produced. Look for a “cameo” from the director as a much younger man on television.\n\n41/100\n\nKrush Groove (1985)\n\nDirected by Michael Schultz. Starring Blair Underwood, Prince Markie Dee, Kool Rock Ski, Darren “The Human Beat Box” Robinson, Joseph “Run” Simmons, Sheila E., Rick Rubin, Darryl “D.M.C.” McDaniels, Kurtis Blow, Richard Gant, LisaGay Hamilton, Jason “Jam Master Jay” Mizell. [R]\n\nRap musical populated by some of the era’s biggest artists out of New York City. The plot is so threadbare it barely warrants mentioning, but it was liberally inspired by the founding of Def Jam Records by producer Russell Simmons (who cameos); here, the label is called Krush Groove, and the man responsible is named Russell Walker (Underwood). Something of a cultural artifact, and several of the songs by the likes of Run-DMC and Sheila E. are choice, but its superficiality and amateurish acting get old fast when the best artists are offstage. Not favored with the gift of foresight either, as the hip hop crew that gets the most camera time is the Fat Boys (whose biggest production number has them rapping about, well, eating food at a Sbarro), while future superstars Beastie Boys and LL Cool J barely even rate cameos. Unless you’re obsessed with the sound and milieu, just stick with the popular soundtrack album or old school rap reruns on MTV. Photographed by Ernest Dickerson. Be on the lookout for a young Chris Rock as a background bit player, his first film appearance.\n\n44/100\n\nThe Love Parade (1929)\n\nDirected by Ernst Lubitsch. Starring Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Lillian Roth, Lupino Lane, E. H. Calvert, Eugene Pallette, Lionel Belmore, Edgar Norton.\n\nLubitsch’s first full talkie is a souped-up libretto from French stage play Le Prince Consort. Chevalier plays a scandalous playboy of a count who’s to be dressed down by the infuriated queen (MacDonald), but it’s not long before they’re more interested in a different sort of dressing down. Lubitsch pulled out all the stops with opulent sets and costuming, ambitious musical numbers, and a sub-romance between kooky Roth and kookier Lane that threatens to upstage the leads (and does). Not without humor and charm on the fringes, but the affair doesn’t really pick up until after the queen and count are married…before briefly bogging down again with a musty battle-of-the-sexes (boy, that honeymoon was over quick). Aside from the okay “Dream Lover” and the saucy “Let’s Be Common,” the songs are washouts, and it’s apparent that Lubitsch was easily bored by them. Two other firsts: Chevalier’s first English-language hit, and MacDonald’s first film period.\n\n64/100\n\nMusic (2021)\n\nDirected by Sia. Starring Kate Hudson, Leslie Odom Jr., Maddie Ziegler, Héctor Elizondo, Mary Kay Place, Ben Schwartz, Brandon Soo Hoo, Tig Notaro. [PG-13]\n\nStaggeringly misguided musical fantasy melodrama goes so very wrong in so very many ways that mere descriptions don’t fully do it justice (of the condemnatory variety). First and foremost is the insulting depiction of autism in the form of a goggle-eyed grinner named Music, as interpreted by Ziegler with a cluster of rehearsed physical tics and rapturous expressions. Then there’s the matter of what the movie is really up to, which is to use neurodivergence as a prop-slash-obstacle to the growth of the actual protagonist, a not-exactly-recovering-addict played by Hudson (shorn of hair and good sense) who is Music’s older sister and eventual guardian; she’d rather dump Music at the “people pound” than take care of the girl’s special needs, but a good-hearted Ghana-immigrant neighbor (Odom)—as much a contrived, one-dimensional plot device as Music—helps her find her way. Respite from the embarrassing performances and preposterous gadgetry of the tone-deaf script is provided by ten or so cloyingly precious pop songs visualized as fantasia music videos, which are grafted into random spaces, and hardly ever apply to the mushy narrative that precedes or follows the breaks. Directorial debut for popstar Sia; she also gets sole story credit, co-scripted and co-produced, and in case the marks of “vanity project” weren’t blindingly obvious yet, she also cameos as herself, a recording artist “without borders.” Juliette Lewis and Henry Rollins make brief appearances.\n\n8/100\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (2004)\n\nDirected by Joel Schumacher. Starring Emmy Rossum, Gerard Butler, Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, Ciarán Hinds, Victor McGuire, Kevin McNally, Jennifer Ellison, Murray Melvin. [PG-13]\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber’s Broadway hit comes to the silver screen as a gassy musical melodrama, disorganized and histrionic, and, like several other recent movie musical productions (Moulin Rouge! and Chicago, chief among them), shamelessly subscribes to the theory that bigger (and gaudier, and noisier) is better. Which is not to say that those things never are, but you tend to need more experienced lead actors filling out characters made of deeper stuff than cardboard, or an auteur for a ringleader instead of a factotum of self-indulgence. Famous story is pointlessly padded out with black & white framing sequences, and as extravagant as the sets are, there’s never any doubt they are precisely that—sets built on a soundstage (even the exteriors). Scenes and songs drag on and on to excruciating length, and the restless camera can’t obscure several instances of very obvious lip synching; Driver, the one whose lip synching was also dubbed by another singer (Margaret Preece), happens to be one of the only cast members to embrace camp instead of trying to take this soggy, irrational love triangle seriously. Most baffling question: Why was little-known non-singer Butler cast as the Phantom? (Even if producers did so because they thought he was hunky, half of his face is covered/scarred the whole time.) Second most baffling question: After the heroine whines, “No, not like this,” and holds back her namby-pamby lover from finishing off the Phantom…why the heck not? (Did she suddenly forget that he’s a…you know, murderer?) Schumacher and Webber are credited for the screenplay adaptation; the latter also produced.\n\n27/100\n\n1776 (1972)\n\nDirected by Peter H. Hunt. Starring William Daniels, Howard Da Silva, Donald Madden, Ken Howard, David Ford, Virginia Vestoff, John Cullum, Ron Holgate, Blythe Danner, James Noble, Roy Poole, Stephen Nathan, William Hansen, William Duell, Emory Bass, Rex Robbins. [G]\n\nBroadway musical hit dramatizing the events of the title year leading up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence is converted to the big screen, with Peter Stone adapting his own book from the stage production. Mushy, simplistic history and a few too many stagy set-ups spoil some of the feverish fruits of the debate; the dialogue alternates between improvisational candor and carefully-articulated oration—taken in part from the Congressional Record in addition to letters, memoirs, etc. from the legislators—but those speeches and interactions almost always upstage the song numbers, which are a largely forgettable lot that either reduce the discourse to childish rhyme or are so dim and lacking in melodic hooks that the tunes pass by like garbage barges in the night. Overlength is an issue—by the time that names start getting called off one by one to put quill to parchment, one’s backside may be feeling similar to the sapping discomfort of poor Caesar Rodney’s (Hansen) cancer-ridden face—but nothing that a little trimming might have solved (although the lyrical content is grave and meaningful, the rendition of “Momma Look Sharp” is a devastating blow to momentum). The characterizations tend to be one-note, but most of the actors provide the grace, gravitas, and humor needed to bring them to life as more than mere caricature. Photographed by Harry Stradling Jr. Daniels, who plays John Adams, would go on to portray his own “descendant” in the television show “St. Elsewhere.”\n\n65/100\n\nTick, Tick…Boom! (2021)\n\nDirected by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Starring Andrew Garfield, Alexandra Shipp, Robin de Jesús, Jonathan Marc Sherman, Judith Light, Mj Rodriguez, Joshua Henry, Vanessa Hudgens, Bradley Whitford, Laura Benanti. [PG-13]\n\nMiranda makes his feature film directing debut with this adaptation of a stage musical that began as a rock monologue from Jonathan Larson, the playwright/composer best known for his hit production, Rent, which had its first Off-Broadway previews the day after he suddenly died of an aortic aneurysm. The narrative is (necessarily) indulgent and erratic, coming on too strong at a couple of key moments when restraint and reflection were more applicable, but it’s also cleverly-constructed, teeming with oscillating volumes of vivacity and anxiety, and is driven by a passionate performance from Garfield, thrumming with sincere emotion regardless of how much the “hero” has earned it (if for nothing else, Larson was at least willing to own up to his severe character flaws). The fervent attention paid unto Larson is one of its most frustrating qualities, however, since it turns his girlfriend (Shipp) into a character with only two notes to play, one after the other—supportive muse and frustrated obstacle—and sidelines his longtime friend (de Jesús), whose tragic circumstances are more arresting than Larson’s make-it-or-break-it drama. The songs are more intimate and eclectic than one usually gets from movie musical adaptations, but some of the weaker ones (mostly in the second half) should have been tapered, and even the most energetic numbers are unlikely to have viewers tapping their toes on the way out. Cameos include Miranda, Joel Grey, Bebe Neuwirth, Bernadette Peters, and a slew of performers familiar to Broadway fanatics.\n\n69/100\n\nWest Side Story (2021)\n\nDirected by Steven Spielberg. Starring Rachel Zegler, Ansel Elgort, Mike Faist, David Alvarez, Ariana DeBose, Josh Andrés Rivera, Rita Moreno, Corey Stoll, Brian d’Arcy James, Iris Menas. [PG-13]\n\nSpielberg’s reincarnation of the 1957 stage musical and 1961 Oscar-winning film adaptation may appear superfluous at a glance, but its themes remain tragically relevant, and compared to the last wildly uneven attempt to bring the show to cinemas, it’s superior in most ways. A longtime master of making the magical and artificial surge with life, Spielberg doesn’t mess with the set design and art direction—the city block exteriors are always populated by exactly as many people and objects as the scenes require, and could have been erected on any large-scale soundstage—but the fluidity of the camerawork is mirrored by the free flow of the narrative, which unclogs the stagy storytelling from the earlier film that emphasized set pieces. Its most significant upgrade can be found in the lead role casting, as Elgort and (especially) newcomer Zegler greatly out-class Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood as star-crossed Upper West Side lovers Tony and María; in the prior adaptation, the film grinded to a halt anytime either (or both) of them took center stage, but the new actors acquit themselves admirably even among the showy supporters, including rangy Faist as Riff and vivacious DeBose as Anita. The racially-charged atmosphere powers the plot engine with more authority, even during an overcooked moment or two—Stoll’s unabashedly bigoted detective could be a mouthpiece for Fox News—but new opportunities arrive in the clever decision to alter the race and gender of Tony’s boss, and stick Moreno into the role (she even usurps “Somewhere” from the young lovers). Tony Kushner’s script can’t solve all the story issues and fable-like contrivances, and the Leonard Bernstein/Stephen Sondheim songbook is still hit-and-miss, but this version has the steamrolling energy and bright performances to keep everything on the right track to the bitterly doleful end. Moreno also co-executive produced.\n\n77/100\n\nCheck back in a few days for the next update!"
