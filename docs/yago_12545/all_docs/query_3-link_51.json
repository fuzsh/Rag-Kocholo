        "text": "Speaker 1: (00:00)\n\nYou're listening to K PBS midday edition. I'm Jade Henman with Christina Kim 2021 may have seen more cinemas open and more movies released in theaters, but it was still a difficult year for the entertainment industry. K PBS film critic, Beth Amando is here to look back on the year to pick her favorites. Welcome\n\nSpeaker 2: (00:19)\n\nBeth. Hey, thank you.\n\nSpeaker 1: (00:21)\n\nSo has the pandemic made it easier or harder to compile your best of five list?\n\nSpeaker 2: (00:26)\n\nWell, it's easier in terms of studios making a lot more films readily available through screening links, but it's harder with so many virtual releases and so many films streaming. So I feel like on a certain level, I haven't seen enough films to do an accurate 10 best list. And that's one of my agonies is worrying that I might have missed that foreign film or that indie gem that should have been included and I missed it. But another issue is, is that so many films have had their opening dates rearranged and moved around. So I don't always know what year to place a film in. So one of the best films I saw in 2020 was St and that was on my 10 best list for that year, but the studio is pushing it for a film this year. So I just wanted to mention that because that would've been on my list this year, if I hadn't already placed it on last year's.\n\nSpeaker 1: (01:14)\n\nSo how were the films this past year overall? I mean, and did you feel there was a strong pool of titles? I\n\nSpeaker 2: (01:20)\n\nFelt there were a lot of excellent film films, but fewer films than last year that I felt really took chances and just knocked it out of the park. So fewer films like Saint mod or possessor uncut, or I'm thinking of ending things. So in some ways it's actually harder to pick the top five because they're all so different and not a single one really like leap out.\n\nSpeaker 1: (01:41)\n\nWow. Okay. Hey, we're gonna go through your top five. And if people wanna see your full list, they can find it tomorrow on your cinema junkie blog, along with the rest of your cinema junkie awards. But at number five, you have Jane campions the power of the dog. Here's a scene that sets the relationship with Benedict comebacks, uh, rough cowboy and a young boy. He likes to torment.\n\nSpeaker 3: (02:04)\n\nI wonder what little lady made these\n\nSpeaker 4: (02:11)\n\nActually I did, sir. My mother was a Floris, so I made them to look like the ones in our garden.\n\nSpeaker 3: (02:21)\n\nOh, well through pardon me? They're just as real as possible. Uh, now gentlemen, look, see, that's what you do with the cloth.\n\nSpeaker 5: (02:41)\n\nOh, oh.\n\nSpeaker 4: (02:46)\n\nThat's it's really just for wine\n\nSpeaker 3: (02:48)\n\nDrips. Oh, you got that boys only for the drip. Now get us some\n\nSpeaker 6: (02:59)\n\nFood.\n\nSpeaker 1: (03:00)\n\nAll right. So Beth, what stood out about this film?\n\nSpeaker 2: (03:03)\n\nI love Jane Campion's confidence in creating a film that's made up mostly of like silences and minimal action. So this is a revenge story and one with quite a bit of brutality in a certain way, but it's so quiet and that you might actually miss some of the key action if you're not paying attention. And the actor who plays the young boy, Cody Smith MCee is fabulous. And he and Benedict Cumba just have an amazing on screen chemistry working off of each other. So\n\nSpeaker 1: (03:36)\n\nTell me about your number four pick, which is an animated document called flee.\n\nSpeaker 2: (03:40)\n\nYes. You don't see a lot of animated documentaries. So this is an animated documentary about the true story of a mean, who arrived as an unaccompanied minor in Denmark from Afghanistan. So it starts in the present with a mean now in his thirties, recounting a secret, he's been hiding for two decades. So through an interview, he should ears with his friend. We go back in time and in order to visualize what he went through, the film employs animation, as well as archive news footage. And it's just a stunning mix of animation and this voiceover narration. And it's a way to get into this man's story in a really away in\n\nSpeaker 1: (04:21)\n\nYour number three slot. You have Joel Cohen's adaptation of Shakespeare's McBeth. Uh, here's a brief clip from that trailer\n\nSpeaker 7: (04:29)\n\nBy the pricking of my thumbs. Something wicked this way comes\n\nSpeaker 1: (04:49)\n\nSo intense. I love it already. You've said, Macbeth is your favorite Shakespeare place. So what did Cohen get right here?\n\nSpeaker 2: (04:55)\n\nThe visuals, this is such a cinematic film. So it's breathtaking in black and white it's cinematic yet. It looks like it's shot on theatrical sets. So everything feels very kind of confined and limited. And that's perfect for the story of the ambitious McBeth. And it's interesting for me because on a certain level, I didn't quite agree with Cohen's kind of emotional of the characters, but the film is just so intoxicatingly visual that it completely sucked me in and won me over.\n\nSpeaker 1: (05:30)\n\nAnd in the number two spot, it's a film that you just recently found streaming on Amazon called nine days. It is described as being about a man interviewing human souls for a chance be born. Uh, here's an early scene.\n\nSpeaker 6: (05:45)\n\nAs you know, you are being considered for the amazing opportunity of life. If after this process, you are selected, you'll have the chance to be born in a fruitful environment where you can grow, develop and accomplish. Would you like to be considered for this position? I would, before we get started, may I call you Mike? Yes. Maria Alexander Kane. yeah. Do you have any questions? Am I dead? I wouldn't say you're alive or dead. Are you the boss? I would say coele that sounds into how long is this process hard to pinpoint exactly. But if you make it until the end nine days, so I have nine days, yes. Or less after that, if you're selected, there is an extension as a newborn. If not, I would say it's the end.\n\nSpeaker 1: (06:56)\n\nVery interesting. I mean, what did you like about this film?\n\nSpeaker 2: (06:59)\n\nI love the wonderfully inventive premise that it uses. And Winston duke is amazing as this man who's interviewing these human souls and it's a film that sometimes approaches the kind of visual poetry of a Terrence Malik film. And it captures memories on VHS videotapes that it laying in the background frequently. And there's just these wonderfully poetic moments that create this swell of emotion for you. That capture what it means to be alive and what it means to have your own identity and how to carry that over. And it was just a film that was surprising on so many levels and just emotionally rewarding. And it was such a surprise cuz I actually found it last night on Amazon. When I was searching around for some last minute, 2021 releases to check out\n\nSpeaker 1: (07:46)\n\nAlways a pleasant surprise to just stumble upon a good film in your number one spot. You have a Japanese film that screened at the San Diego Asian film festival called drive my car. The film looks to a Japanese man who is directing a stage version of uncle Vaya in which actors speak in different languages. Here's a scene from a rehearsal. What do\n\nSpeaker 8: (08:09)\n\nYou think?\n\nSpeaker 9: (08:15)\n\nI think the director should be the one to judge\n\nSpeaker 8: (08:20)\n\nTerrible. Hi.\n\nSpeaker 9: (08:25)\n\nI agree with you. I feel like we both did better during the auditions. Hmm.\n\nSpeaker 8: (08:32)\n\nDo you know why?\n\nSpeaker 9: (08:33)\n\nUm, because I've learned a little bit of the dialogue. So I use my partner like my acting cues, but if I don't learn the dialogue, I can't act. Okay. And I thought that this way I could, um, pay more attention to other people's emotions. If I learned the dialogue perfectly, including theirs, I can react better.\n\nSpeaker 8: (08:56)\n\nI see why don't we read the book again\n\nSpeaker 1: (09:02)\n\nAnd what made this your number one film?\n\nSpeaker 2: (09:05)\n\nAs soon as I saw this film, I knew it was gonna be on my top 10. It's a film like power of the dog has this confidence and assurance and its ability to tell a through kind of misdirection where it's quiet. A lot of it is through dialogue and you have to pay attention to it, to kind of start piecing together the story of this man who is overcoming loss. And I love films that leave a lot up to the viewer to piece a everything together. They don't lead you by the nose and tell you how you're supposed to feel and tell you what's happening. You kind of have to pay attention. And this film is just beautifully executed and so confident in the story it's telling and you have to be patient, but by the end, the payoff and the emotional rewards are spectacular.\n\nSpeaker 1: (09:57)\n\nAll right, well Beth, thanks for sharing your picks for the best films of 2021. You can find the full list of her favorites on her cinema junkie blog@kpbs.org. Thanks again, Beth. Thank you."
