        "meta_description": "Cheli, a successful Israeli television personality, receives news that her father has died and she must immediately return to her childhood home for the funeral. She prepares for the journey and brings her young daughter Ruth, who is autistic. Along the way, Cheli is forced to pick up her older sister Pnina from the institution, where she has resided since young adulthood. As the three women make their way back to the town of Cheli’s youth, she is overcome with memories of her 1970s childhood. At 13, Cheli, then Rachel, was an ambitious young girl chafing at the role assigned to her in her Moroccan immigrant family. The family is dysfunctional and each sibling experiences trouble living up to its expectations. Her mother and older sister Pnina, who is both developmentally disabled and an extremely potent medium, attempt to remedy these problems with sh’chur (traditional magic rituals). Rachel’s brother, Avram, is put on leave from his kibbutz, which has threatened to send him to a psychologist for peeing his bed nightly. When her older brother Shlomo spots sister Zohara cavorting with a boyfriend, the family comes to the decision that it is time for her to be married.",
