        "text": "Kicking off a busy last week of 2021 for Cinecaps Digest is this latest batch of foreign film reviews. The usual wide variety of subjects, genres, countries/languages, and calibers. Hope you like subtitles; I sure do—I even turn them on when I’m watching a movie in my native language. But, as I said, it’s going…\n\nGrading the Franchise is a recurring feature at Cinecaps Digest where I review an entire film series. Today, it’s the spaghetti Western “Dollars trilogy.” Anyone who frequents these reviews may already be aware of this: I find a good number of the classic American Westerns to be somewhat less than their reputations would suggest. High Noon, The…\n\nTen more foreign film capsule reviews today, following the group of ten from December of last year, and that first ten-piece in September. Today, they hail from Italy, Japan, Senegal, France, China, and more, and cover a wide variety of genres, too (black comedy, war, drama, epic action, thriller, etc.). Bon appétit! All About My…\n\nIt seemed fitting to have the first themed batch on Cinecaps Digest “Version 2.0” that exploited the promise of bigger and beefier content be capsule reviews of the biggest and beefiest collection of movies yet. True, there have been longer posts before, but never one that had this sort of square footage. Or, to put…\n\nToday’s batch of random reviews includes the movie that netted Marlene Dietrich the only Oscar nod of her career, the first 2021 release yet to be reviewed on Cinecaps, Jean-Luc Godard coming back from his extended stint in the avant-garde abstract, and a Sergio Leone spaghetti Western (no, not that one…or that one…or that—you know…\n\nTime for another batch of gangster movie reviews (following this first one and this second one, and preceding this fourth), a sub-genre that’s sometimes so entertaining it oughta be illegal. This time, we have one from Robert De Niro, two with Warren Beatty, a couple co-starring Stephen Graham, one featuring Humphrey Bogart, a pair from…\n\nToday’s batch of random reviews includes a low-key comedy of Depression-era moviemaking, a choice Bogie noir, a horror prequel to a horror remake (that sometimes resembles a horror remake of a horror remake), and a based-on-a-true-story medical tearjerker from Penny Marshall. Awakenings (1990) Directed by Penny Marshall. Starring Robin Williams, Robert De Niro, John Heard,…\n\nDeath, death everywhere. Death in here, death in there. Death on a ladder, death on a chair. I wouldn’t want death in a box, I wouldn’t want death with a fox. But there’s still so much death. Especially in movie titles. In my selection of movies to include in a batch where all of them…\n\nToday’s batch of random reviews includes an H. P. Lovecraft-inspired horror film, a feature film focused on one of Sacha Baron Cohen’s satirical characters, an evocative mood piece from Terence Malick, some low-grade action trash starring Steve McQueen…’s son, and John Wayne’s curtain call. Ali G Indahouse (2002) Directed by Mark Mylod. Starring Sacha Baron…\n\nI recently ran two different “Seeing Double”-themed batch groups, which put the spotlight on pairs of movies that share the same title but have nothing to do with one another. Those were special cases, of course, since it’s not at all uncommon for multiple movies to carry the same names. And the main reason why…"
