This woman faces her family and the different versions of each others while she decides if shewill be or not a part of the programme and while she starts knowing more about who her daughter was.\n\nSteevens (21) is a young Haitian with a simple and stable life in Chile: work, home, friends and fun. Junior (19), a childhood friend, arrives in Chile. Steevens gets him a job, but Junior is messy and provokes a fight in which Steevens hits his Boss (50). This event gets viral and his community, his friends and everybody else reject Steevens. He loses his papers and his home. Steevens walks around the city searching for a chance to restart his life, finding it only beyond the margins of society."
