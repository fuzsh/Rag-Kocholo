        "text": "“This Man Must Die” is the murder where the formerly genre-fluid director Claude Chabrol turned serial with a commitment to crime thrillers.\n\n“Must Die,” appropriately, possesses a knife sharp edge of competency. The film stars Michel Duchaussoy as a writer who obsesses over finding the driver of a hit and run accident that killed his young son.\n\nOn concept alone, the work seems a sort of standard revenge-mystery plot that could be played out these days by anyone from Ryan Gosling to Liam Neeson. Chabrol and Duchaussoy though, commit to a remarkable show of mundanity as they go about the business of equaling out justice.\n\nDuchaussoy’s performance seems to deliberately lack so much as an iota of charisma. When his…\n\nChabrol's study of retribution as movie motif, one of his more ideally structured movies. Very chilling and unwilling to allow easy identification. Innocence is shattered in the opening scene and from there on it is a gam of chairs of destructive feelings. The mai character is a writer and a diary plays a key role, and one must say forms of storytelling are very central to the movie appeal. Midway through it, Jean Yanne pops up as the titular beast in a remarkable odious performance and in typical Chabrolian dark humor the movie stops to ponder how much worse this obviously horrible man is than all the other dark impulses the movie is charting. The ending is perfect, one of…\n\n9th Claude Chabrol (after Le Boucher, La Cérémonie, Blood Relatives, Landru, Web of Passion, Just Before Nightfall, Violette Noizère and Death Rite)\n\nRevenge is perhaps worst when it's thwarted, when your desire for karmic justice is rendered impotent by the situations around you. You crave the restorative assurance that you have power to take back what you lost, but to lose that? Well, you're even less than you once were. And poor Charles. All that hard work, all those weeks of tracking the car that killed his son, all that subtle manipulation to find the person who caused his misery. And for what? A whimper of a retribution against a man who everyone hates, bar his detestable mother, due to…\n\nSteve's Priority Watchlist Project\n\nI've been slower on the uptake in watching more Claude Chabrol films than I should be considering where it appears his career ultimately took him.\n\nHe seems to be labelled, especially in the second half of his career, a director of thrillers. That's probably a simplification of what he did - he seemed to almost strangle the life out of the traditional thriller clichés in search of a more grounded and 'realistic' approach.\n\nSo here he takes what is a simple tale of revenge and instead of allowing it become a tale of grisly violence or even one of moral ponderings, he makes it a story of an imploding family and the grieving father who gets…"
