The truth behind this famine, and the sinister faceless despot (David Thewlis) who has the town under his thumb, serve as the basis for a mystery that in turn is merely a framework for a succession of knockabout setpieces, egged on by Tom Howe’s appropriately hyperactive score.\"\n\nGuy Lodge, Variety\n\nTHE DEER KING - Harumi Fuuki\n\n\"It makes sense that 'The Deer King,' in theaters today after a successful international run in Japan and parts of Europe, is reminiscent of some of the best work of Studio Ghibli. After all, one of the directors, Masashi Ando, worked in the animation department there on classics like 'Princess Mononoke,' and 'When Marnie Was There,' while the other director was credited as assistant director on 'Spirited Away.' They learned a thing or two about gorgeous visuals that meld fantasy storytelling with images of the natural world. Well, they should have. Because they forgot the magic. Where they fail in 'The Deer King' is in the storytelling, almost as if they’re copying a playbook they made at Ghibli, without the same heart behind the undeniably strong technique. 'The Deer King' looks great (and has a lovely score) but it’s repetitive, predictable, and downright dull -- three things that can almost never be said about the animation house that so clearly inspired it.\"\n\nBrian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"Yet emotionally, what cuts through the gritty fable’s oft-overwrought mythology is the hero’s paternal bond with young Yuna, a chance for him to experience tenderness once again amid the onslaught from multiple fronts. The score by Harumi Fuuki also infuses the grand narrative canvas with a rousing dramatism that matches the stakes.\"\n\nCarlos Aguilar, Los Angeles Times\n\nHELLO, GOODBYE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN - Mike Tuccillo\n\n\"Lewen, editor Joe Landauer and cinematographer Bryce Fortner find a well-paced rhythm and tonally appealing aesthetic, evoking a sense of buoyancy and grounded realism at the same time. Music supervisors Lindsay Wolfington and Laura Webb’s soundtrack selections also help float emotions without being intrusive, while complementing Mike Tuccillo’s score.\"\n\nCourtney Howard, Variety\n\nA LOT OF NOTHING - David Sardy\n\n\"McRae's film is nothing if not audacious. To make a debut with such sensitivity at its center certainly requires a confident hand, and the film's stylistic aspects complement this to a tee, even when the film's content does not. Creative cinematography and a thumping jazzy score accentuate the no-holds-barred approach of the film and its characters. McRae's direction is bold, with the more actiony sequences lending themselves to comedy, reminiscent of the soapy early aughts detectives on television.\"\n\nPeyton Robinson, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"It’s only the first of several reversals contained in this richly theatrical prologue, that is set to riffling, restless improv jazz of David Sardy’s score. Even more thornily, a gun that might as well have Chekhov’s name engraved on it is introduced and a weird role-play ensues during which James’ alpha-male posturing explicitly turns Vanessa on. When the scene finally cuts to the next day and they both prepare for work -- in a crisply edited montage of closeups that feels like it’s slapping the hangover of the long-take away -- it seems like the whole previous night might be the “lot of nothing” to which the title refers. Maybe they are just this shallow: another couple of complacent keyboard warriors whose activism is all talk, who are only truly dangerous in fantasy and whose moneyed lifestyle insulates them from the messier manifestations of social injustice.\"\n\nJessica Kiang, Variety\n\nLUCK - John Debney\n\n\"Tony nominee Noblezada is terrific as the voice of Sam. She brings just the right mix of levity, curiosity and gravitas to the role. Twice she gets to sing Madonna’s 'Lucky Star' and it’s so fun you will almost wonder if Luck should have been a musical. The soaring, uplifting score by composer John Debney is one of the movie’s biggest assets.\"\n\nAmy Amatangelo, Paste Magazine\n\n\"Sam remains optimistic despite the first-day flubs, which are accompanied by John Debney’s upbeat score. In fact, she doesn’t wish for luck until she goes back to see Hazel, whose weekend visit with a potential family was cancelled. Hazel’s despondent mood upsets Sam, and she promises Hazel (a collector of charms) to find her a lucky penny so the next couple scheduled to see her might adopt her.\"\n\nLovia Gyarkye, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nNAVALNY - Marius de Vries, Matt Robertson\n\n\"Working with editors Langdon Page and Maya Daisy Hawke and assisted by the propulsive score by Marius de Vries and Matt Robertson, Roher contracts several exceptional set-pieces that could just as easily have involved Jack Ryan or George Smiley in supporting roles. A scene with Navalny calling his suspected poisoners and attempting to improv his way into getting a confession plays out with jaw-dropping suspense. His flight back to Russia, with the prospect of immediate arrest -- Roher ignores the trumped-up charges Navalny knew he was facing -- is a breath-holding slow burn. Even stuff that Roher wasn’t there to film first-hand, like airplane cell phone footage of a near-death Navalny moaning in agony, gets a tightly constructed presentation.\"\n\nDaniel Fienberg, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nNOT OKAY - Pierre-Philippe Côté\n\n\"Shephard jabs well-placed elbows at modern day media celebrity, where the public’s attention veers in an instant from tutting about death to applauding as Danni does goat yoga. The film’s portrait of a serious journalist -- a queer androgyne named Harper (Nadia Alexander) -- hungers to take Danni down to reassert her own primacy as the outlet’s foremost churner of Ruth Bader Ginsburg hagiography. Meanwhile, as the tension ratchets, Pierre-Philippe Côté’s score leans on disquieting choral music that sounds like a hymnal for the damned.\"\n\nAmy Nicholson, Variety\n\nPERSUASION - Stuart Earl\n\n\"Other modern touches, including color-conscious casting (see: Henry Golding as her foppish cousin, Nikki Amuka-Bird as her smart godmother, and Ben Bailey Smith as her stalwart brother-in-law) are still more exciting. And while 'Persuasion' is one of Austen’s more serious novels, comedic performances from Lydia Rose Pewley (as the dimly scheming Lady Penelope) and Mia McKenna-Bruce (as Anne’s outrageously immature sister) add spice to the feature. (The film’s lush settings and Stuart Earl’s sweeping score are all classic Austen adaptation, and just lovely.)\"\n\nKate Erbland, IndieWire\n\n\"Tackling her first feature, seasoned London stage director Cracknell draws solid work from the ensemble, showing a firm handle on the tricky Regency/contemporary balancing act and a pleasing grasp of pacing, enhanced by Stuart Earl’s delicate score.\"\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nPREY - Sarah Schachner\n\n\"The excellent lead performances, grand cinematography and sharp screenplay are matched by a particularly memorable and thrilling score from Sarah Shachner ('The Lazarus Effect'), whose work skillfully adapts, depending on the scene. It’s a classical frontier orchestration, it’s a creepy monster riff, it’s a tender dramatic piece, it’s everything in between.\"\n\nWilliam Bibbiani, The Wrap\n\n\"Endless drone shots, perspective switches and too many CGI animals undercut any grit or claustrophobia that Trachtenberg -- director of the brilliant '10 Cloverfield Lane' -- might otherwise have crafted. Meanwhile, the interminable score refuses to quiet down and let the images or emotions speak for themselves. While it is certainly more coherent and enjoyable than Black’s 2018 'The Predator,' 'Prey' is a middling, lightweight effort. Nevertheless, the critical and audience reception have to date been overwhelmingly positive, so no doubt this won’t be the last time we’ll be seeing cinema’s ugliest m**********r.\"\n\nChristopher Machell, CineVue\n\n\"So, it’s a testament to Trachtenberg’s suspense artistry that 'Prey' is as engaging and entertaining as it is, regardless. Featuring a great score by Sarah Schachner (especially the bookended, more elegiac music), terrific cinematography by Jeff Cutter, and tight editing by Claudia Castello and Angela M. Catanzaro, 'Prey' is very well constructed on a cinematic level.\"\n\nRodrigo Perez, The Playlist\n\n\"'Prey' is worth spending the money to see on the biggest screen possible. The wide open spaces of Alberta look fantastic, there’s plenty of monster mayhem and action, and the striking score by Sarah Schachner deserves to be blasted from the largest speakers available. So, why is Disney dumping an entry in the popular 'Predator' series on Hulu in the middle of the summer? The original 'Predator' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger turns 35 this year; what better way to celebrate than with a prequel that’s better than any of its sequels? The marketing team could have had a field day promoting this connection. So why is this film, like Disney+'s 'Turning Red' before it, going straight to streaming with no simultaneous theatrical presence?\"\n\nOdie Henderson, RogerEbert.com\n\nSHE WILL - Clint Mansell\n\n\"It would be interesting to crack out the stopwatch to see just how much of 'She Will''s running time consists of dialogue-free, non-narrative montages, fades, and superimpositions of extreme skin close-ups, ripped earth, worms, snails, eyeballs, oily liquid, galaxies, and more eyeballs. Clint Mansell’s original score matches the heady visuals (echoing, at times, some of Philip Glass’ operas with “ahh ahh” choruses) and cinematographer Jamie D. Ramsay bathes the picture in a rich blue sheen.\"\n\nJordan Hoffman, The Onion AV Club\n\n\"'She Will,' produced by horror master Dario Argento, is a very striking film, and won the best First Feature award at the Locarno International Film Festival. 'She Will' isn't exactly a horror movie. It has its creepy moments, particularly in the visual collages and Clint Mansell's unnerving score, but it's more thought-provoking than scary. It's not too difficult to believe that the past sins against women -- i.e. witch burning -- would make it to future generations as a distant echo, creating solidarity with those who came before.\"\n\nSheila O'Malley, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"Colbert doesn’t over-explain what the ghosts -- and, by extension, Veronica -- can and can’t do. Most of the story’s pertinent information is suggested silently, via the dreamy images (made luminous and slightly abstract by cinematographer Jamie D. Ramsay), just as much of the hypnotic mood is carried by Clint Mansell’s richly textured score. The movie’s action, meanwhile, is driven by the news that a legendary director (played by Malcolm McDowell) is making a new version of the film that launched Veronica’s career, back when she was a teenager. As she reflects on that time, she remembers the abuse more than the triumph; and she starts wondering whether she can use her new powers to get some closure.\"\n\nNoel Murray, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"Jamie D. Ramsay’s photography is glowering, damp and sinister, with rich crimson accents, and if there’s a slight overuse of drone shots that drift eerily over the darkened landscapes (an element that feels on the verge of becoming an 'elevated horror' cliché), really these pauses give a moment for Clint Mansell’s appropriately deranged score to take the lead. The music, in turn, blends seamlessly into an uncannily precise soundscape in which tiny noises, like the beating of birds’ wings or the oily slicking of mascara onto eyelashes or a night breeze full of whispers, are amplified. And the whole is assembled into a heady but economical 95 minutes by editor Yorgos Mavropsaridis, who as frequent collaborator of Yorgos Lanthimos knows a thing or two about cutting along an atmospheric, dissociative bias rather than one of traditional storytelling logic.\"\n\nJessica Kiang, Variety\n\nTHE NEXT TEN DAYS IN L.A.\n\nScreenings of older films in Los Angeles-area theaters.\n\nMarch 3\n\nHISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1 (John Morris) [Alamo Drafthouse]\n\nHISTORY OF THE WORLD PART 1 (John Morris) [El Capitan]\n\nIN BRUGES (Carter Burwell) [Nuart]\n\nJEANNE DIELMAN, 23, QUAI DU COMMERCE, 1080 BRUXELLES [Academy Musueum]\n\nKILL BILL.
