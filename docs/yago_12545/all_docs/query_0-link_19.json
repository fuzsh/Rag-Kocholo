        "text": "Very happy to catch up with LA BESTIA DEBE MORIR — (THE BEAST MUST DIE) — from the novel by Nicholas Blake. Now I’ve seen all the adaptations. Claude Chabrol’s French version quite sensibly removes the gentleman detective hero, Nigel Strangeways, and makes the murderer the protagonist, which he essentially is in the book. The recent Ridley Scott-produced miniseries retains Strangeways but makes him a boring policeman with boring PTSD, and you wish the focus was on the killer, who is now a woman (Cush Jumbo, magnificent) which works just as well.\n\n(There’s no werewolf break in any of these, though. In my view, every movie deserves a werewolf break — a moment of silent contemplation when we consider which of the characters would be the werewolf, if only this were a werewolf movie.)\n\nThis Argentinian version comes from Román Viñoly Barreto, director of EL VAMPIRO NEGRO, a quasi-remake of Fritz Lang’s M which is quite impressive. This one might be even better, except for the unconvincing false beard you have to look at for most of the movie. But there are bravura moments, and the film retains the novel’s unconventional structure — there’s a looong flashback which breaks the movie kind of into thirds.\n\nThe revelation is that this works — Blake’s structure was sound, if you play it pretty much the way he intended. Surprisingly, the titular beast, the worst man in the world, George Rattery (Guillermo Battaglia), gets somewhat de-emphasized. Also surprisingly, he dies in the first scene, then re-appears in the flashbacks and is so awful you can’t wait for him to die again. One of our friends watching along with us remotely would have been quite happy for the guy to die twice, in the best Karloffian tradition.\n\nThe other weird thing is that the filmmakers retain the English setting and character names, though everyone speaks Spanish and many of the actors are very obviously South American. It’s possible that making the story happen in a far-off land diverted the censors from inferring any social critique.\n\nCameraman Alberto Etchebehere has developed the X-Files approach to night shoots, blasting a big light through the treetops to simulate moonlight, only there seem to be moons everywhere you turn. Whatever, it’s dramatic and beautiful. He gets the same effect with some strange streetlights, which certainly don’t look British, although the fog is authentic.\n\nAlso, lovely Hollywood-style hallucinatory dream-flashback montage.\n\nI got hooked on Margery Allingham’s Campion books last year. I think she rates a couple of posts at least.\n\nAllingham created her fictional detective Albert Campion in her second published novel, The Crime at Black Dudley (1929), and kept writing about him the rest of her life, with a little time off for side-projects. On the face of it, Campion is a somewhat derivative character — he has a lot in common with Dorothy L. Sayer’s Lord Peter Wimsey and a little in common with Raffles, Boston Blackie, the Lone Wolf and the Falcon. He’s a very posh gent who hides behind a veneer of Bertie Woosterish silly-ass buffoonery and large horn-rimmed spectacles. But he’s also acquired the agility of a cat-burglar, the ability to pick locks, and the friendship and occasional assistance of many in the criminal underworld. He has an ex-con, Lugg, as manservant: a large, lugubrious man, he serves the same role as Blackie’s “the Runt,” while being his physical opposite.\n\nThe familiarity of these tropes adds to the books’ golden-age aura of cosiness, but in fact they’re quite unconventional as well. Allingham could write tight, fair-play mysteries when she chose to, but wasn’t satisfied limiting herself to that form. The Crime at Black Dudley plays like DIE HARD in a country house, with an unexplained murder happening during a hostage crisis. Campion himself is a supporting character and something of a deux ex machina. The only weakness is that the solution to the mystery depends entirely on information learned in the last chapter. I think if Allingham had constructed a real whodunnit and staged it against the backdrop of a group jeopardy thriller, she’d have had a really nice twist on the format. This would still be a good idea if somebody did it.\n\nThere was a TV show… I may have to check it out.\n\nA couple of subsequent novels (Black Dudley and Mystery Mile) pit Campion against a Mabusean criminal outfit, “the Simister Gang” (Allingham’s character names tend towards the Dickensian). Police at the Funeral employs a really great twist, on a par with Christie’s genre-bending “the detective did it” and “the narrator did it” and “everybody did it” revelations. But by the time of Death of a Ghost in 1934, she’s experimenting with the structure: the killer is known halfway through the book, and the tension comes from the question of “How can we get any evidence to convict?” This kind of radical non-whodunnit approach recurs semi-regularly in MA’s books.\n\nThere’s also a bold streak of John Buchanesque adventuring, with international intrigues (Sweet Danger) and large-scale domestic espionage (Traitor’s Purse). The last-named is one of two wartime novels that hint that Campion has joined British Intelligence – these books also show the influence of American pulp fiction and noir. TP combines its wartime forgery plot (the Germans, it turned out later, really DID plot to destabilise the UK economy with forged banknotes) with a homegrown fascist villain suggestive of Cecil Day-Lewis/Nicholas Blake’s The Smiler with the Knife *and* an amnesia ploy suggestive of… well, everything. SOMEWHERE IN THE NIGHT and TWO O’CLOCK COURAGE and SPELLBOUND hadn’t been made yet, though, so it may well be a literary influence rather than a movie one. What were the hot amnesia stories in 1942? The second wartime book, Coroner’s Pidgin, uses the gimmick of the hero always being frustrated in his desire to sleep, eat or drink, and adds to this his desire to get away to his country retreat, for reasons not revealed until the rather moving final chapter.\n\nOh yes, Campion gets romantic interest, unlike a lot of his fellow sleuths (Agatha Christie turned down a lucrative MGM deal because they wouldn’t guarantee Poirot’s celibacy). Allingham works her way up to this gently, and it’s part of the gradual evolution that sees her hero becoming less eccentric and caricatured, and more real.\n\nThe best-known of the books is Tiger in the Smoke, which sidelines Campion so much that the film version was able to leave him out entirely. I’ve written about the movie before but want to revisit it. Seeing it in the light of the book makes its weaknesses more obvious but it’s still an interesting thing, with its own mystery about it. Again, a comparison with Nicholas Blake’s work is possible: when Claude Chabrol adapted Blake’s The Beast Must Die, he also found it convenient to delete the sleuth, Nigel Strangeways (originally inspired by the personality of W.H. Auden). The recent Ridley Scott-produced TV version reinstated Strangeways and made everything worse.\n\nSeveral fans remark on Allingham’s work lacking the snobbery and racism of other golden age writers, but this is not entirely correct. There’s some throwaway antisemitism and hackneyed post-WWI evil Huns in the early books, the working-class characters tend very much to the caricatured (though Lugg is lovable), and Campion himself is discernibly High Tory, like his creator. But it’s true that the moments of discomfort are rare enough that the books are still very enjoyable, and Allingham writes a hell of a lot better than Sax Rohmer:\n\nThe fog had crept into the taxi where it crouched panting in a traffic jam. It oozed in ungenially, to smear sooty fingers over the two elegant young people who sat inside. They were keeping apart self-consciously, each stealing occasional glances in the same kind of fear at their clasped hands resting between them on the shabby leather seat.\n\nI still have a ton of these to read. Maybe we’ll eventually get THREE blog posts out of them?\n\nFollowed up my Nicholas Blake reading by actually watching The Beast Must Die, the recent TV adaptation. A really,really strong performance by Cush Jumbo as the avenging mother (a father in the book) — she gets a long-held close-up in episode one which was the main thing that kept me watching. A typically good performance by Jared Harris as the titular beast — he seemed to be using more of his famous dad’s energy than usual. And, as in the book, the detective hero, Nigel Strangeways, played by Billy Howle, is a bit of a dud. Absent from all the really key scenes, robbed of the task of solving a mystery for us, he seems like an unnecessary remnant, a vestigial toe of the cosy crime story in the novel, and all the efforts of screenwriter Gaby Chiappe to make him interesting — chiefly by giving him a case of PTSD — come to nothing. It’s not the actor’s fault. I think when you define a task — as I think those involved have done here — as “make something interesting” — you’re already on course to lose, because you’re taking something you see as boring and trying to hang tinsel on it.\n\nI see that Chiappe also wrote THEIR FINEST, which I previously detested. Sorry. I will avoid future writings from this author because it just feels mean. I didn’t set out to hate-watch it. Although, this is an improvement. In the plus camp, the show MOSTLY avoids the leaden exposition that plagues British TV writing (I don’t think the boom in US quality TV has inspired anything comparable over here), the real protagonist’s story is compelling — meanwhile Strangeways spends three episodes trying to solve a broken window — director Dome Karukoski keeps things expansive and propulsive whenever possible — the reliance on drone shots doesn’t feel too hackneyed — already the drone feels as tiresomely ubiquitous as the ’70s helicopter, but it can still work — the modernisation of Blake’s yarn is skillfully done. And yet — the series doesn’t have what Blake’s novel had, that genuinely heartbreaking quality of a bereaved parent. It’s curious how that is absent entirely, given the leads’ sure-handedness."
