        "text": "This little known but extremely powerful version of Nicholas Blake’s novel was intended as a vehicle for Spanish actor Narciso Ibáñez Menta, who also co-wrote, co-produced and supervised the film. The original timeline of the plot was modified so that director Viñoly Barreto (who also made EL VAMPIRO NEGRO) could start the film with a violent family fight that escalates until one of its members drops dead. The victim turns out to be the “beast” of the title and from then on the film plays out as a mystery in flashback, with all the classic elements – love, hate, murder and revenge – appropriately displayed. In a very consistent cast, clearly chosen for the graphic value of their faces, Guillermo Battaglia stands out as the unredeemed villain of the piece.\n\nCurated by Fernando Peña and Roger Koza."
