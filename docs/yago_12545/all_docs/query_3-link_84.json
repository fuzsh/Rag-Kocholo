        "text": "2022 Movie Odyssey Awards\n\nAnd now to (finally) cap off the 2022 Movie Odyssey, here is the annual awards ceremony. To remind you all, the films eligible for the Movie Odyssey are only those that I saw for the first time in their entirety over the last calendar year. Rewatches do not count. Other eligibility rules (such as whether or not a “TV movie” versus a “streaming movie” can count can be found here).\n\nAll of these films that were nominated or won (except for Worst Picture) are worth your time and are worth seeking. Even though some of them might be deeply flawed, there are redeeming elements to them that make them wonderful watches. And some, like our ten Best Picture winners - I never distinguish one above the other nine because it’s just too damn hard - are my highest recommendations of the year.\n\nBest Pictures\n\nLa bestia debe morir (The Beast Must Die) (1952, Argentina)\n\nThe Doll (1919, Germany)\n\nDrive My Car (2021, Japan)\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once (2022)\n\nThe Ladykillers (1955)\n\nNightmare Alley (1947)\n\nA Patch of Blue (1965)\n\nPetite Maman (2021, France)\n\nSidewalk Stories (1989)\n\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth (2021)\n\nWith the fewest movies I’ve seen on record in a calendar year since the blog began, this probably would mean that Best Picture would skew newer, as it does here. For the first time ever, Best Picture has more than three films from the current decade. Drive My Car seems to herald a return to form for Japanese cinema (whose live-action industry has lacked much appeal for international audiences until recently). EEAAO is an Internet favorite, and its fearless filmmaking has proven emotionally resonant while ridiculously entertaining. Little-seen Petite Maman is a low fantasy movie that looks at grief through the eyes of a child - and it is one of the finest films about children I have seen in years. The Tragedy of Macbeth was a stunner for its loaded cast and its deeply atmospheric black-and-white 4:3 aesthetics.\n\nOutside of the current decade, Argentinian noir strikes again with the deliciously deranged La bestia debe morir, saved from oblivion thanks to collaboration of Fernando Martín Peña, the Film Noir Foundation, the UCLA Film & Television Archive, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Doll represents Ernst Lubitsch at his early silent film best. It is an uproarious time complete with Lubitsch’s sly visuals, but I’m not sure if I could recommend to it folks who haven’t seen a silent film. The Ladykillers drips with British wit as hideous violence threatens to burst through its comedic facade, all thanks to a stupendous ensemble performance. Edmund Goulding’s Nightmare Alley is superior to the Guillermo del Toro remake in almost all the ways that matter. Tyrone Power’s perhaps career-best performance powers a moody noir that always feels a little off-kilter. A Patch of Blue is understated, but intelligent filmmaking by Guy Green. Compassionate performances from Sidney Poitier and Elizabeth Hartman will steal hearts. And lastly, Sidewalk Stories is a neo-silent film from African-American filmmaker Charles Lane as a tribute to Chaplin’s The Kid (1921). But it works beyond as a tribute to Chaplin.\n\nWhat a slate of ten this was.\n\nBest Comedy\n\nFather Goose (1964)\n\nGlass Onion (2022)\n\nThe Ladykillers\n\nA Mighty Wind (2003)\n\nMonsieur Hulot’s Holiday (1953, France)\n\n9 to 5 (1980)\n\nThe Oyster Princess (1919, Germany)\n\nPillow Talk (1959)\n\nSee How They Run (2022)\n\nStart Cheering (1938)\n\nAs I say every year, this category is not so much looking for the “best” movie as it is awarding the movie that made me laugh the most. The Oyster Princess is the lesser of the two early Ernst Lubitsch movies I saw this year, but it was the more outrageous watch. This farce comedy sees an American heiress’ father attempt to purchase a husband for his daughter, but it does not according to plan. The Oyster Princess contained the best title card I saw in any silent film this year: “A foxtrot epidemic suddenly breaks out during the wedding.” Trust me, you have to see the film to get it. Just behind are Pillow Talk, The Ladykillers, and holiday phenomenon Glass Onion.\n\nBest Musical\n\nBabes in Arms (1939)\n\nThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)\n\nBig Fella (1937)\n\nThe Gang’s All Here (1943)\n\nLadies of the Chorus (1948)\n\nLe Million (1931, France)\n\nLove Me or Leave Me (1955)\n\nMeet Danny Wilson (1952)\n\nOliver & Company (1988)\n\nThe Wiz (1978)\n\nThis category advantages original musicals, not musical adaptations. If it’s a musical adaptation, it better be superbly filmed/adapted or else I’m gonna have a hard time making a case for it. The Gang’s All Here is a 20th Century Fox musical that combines both original songs and songs from other films from Fox’s back catalog (which, before and after the studio’s acquisition from Disney, was always difficult to access). A musical riot, big splashy fun, somewhat thanks to Busby Berkeley’s direction and signature choreography (see: the reprise of “A Journey to a Star”). I also considered Babes in Arms and The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (an adaptation) for this award.\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nAll Dogs Go to Heaven (1989)\n\nBelle (2021, Japan)\n\nFlee (2021, Denmark)\n\nFortune Favors Lady Nikuko (2021, Japan)\n\nHilda and the Mountain King (2021)\n\nLightyear (2022)\n\nOliver & Company\n\nThe Rescuers (1977)\n\nThe Rescuers Down Under (1990)\n\nTurning Red (2022)\n\nNo contest here. Nominated at last year’s Oscars for Animated Feature, Documentary Feature, and International Feature Film (the first time any movie had been nominated for that combination of categories), Flee is about a man who shares, for the first time in his life, his experiences about fleeing Taliban-controlled Afghanistan shortly after the Soviet withdrawal from the country. A pseudonym is used to protect his identity. Some might have quibbles with the film’s artistic style, but I’m of the opinion that the way the story is told far outstrips any concerns I have about the animation itself.\n\nNone of the other nominees came close to matching Flee. But I would consider The Rescuers (the 1977 original) to be the runner-up here. In a stronger year, no way would the scattershot Belle, emotionally unengaging Lightyear, and narratively lacking Oliver & Company stayed in this category.\n\nBest Documentary\n\nAmerican Revolution 2 (1969)\n\nAntonio Gaudí (1984, Japan)\n\nChildren of the Mist (2021, Vietnam)\n\nA Crack in the Mountain (2022)\n\nThe Donut King (2020)\n\nFlee\n\nThe Murder of Fred Hampton (1971)\n\nSpellbound (2002)\n\nThree Songs for Benazir (2021 short, Afghanistan)\n\nWinter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom (2015, Ukraine)\n\nFlee does the double. The competition here, however, is much closer than in Animated Feature. To me, the very close runner-up is the Grand Jury Trống Đồng Award for Best Feature winner from Viet Film Fest 2022 (yours truly is the Artistic Director), Children of the Mist. Hà Lệ Diễm’s feature debut follows the life of a 12, later 13-year-old Hmong girl living in far northern Vietnam. At 13 years of age, she might be subject to the tradition of bride-kidnapping in Hmong culture. The director is mostly an observer to what happens in the film. One wonders what would have happened to the film’s subject if the cameras were not there.\n\nNext up after Children of the Mist would have been The Murder of Fred Hampton and the experimental Antonio Gaudí.\n\nBest Non-English Language Film\n\nAla Kachuu – Take and Run (2020 short), Switzerland/Kyrgyzstan\n\nLa bestia debe morir (The Beast Must Die), Argentina\n\nBuffalo Boy (2004), Vietnam\n\nDrive My Car, Japan\n\nFlee, Denmark\n\nGanashatru (An Enemy of the People) (1989), India\n\nLoves of a Blonde (1965), Czechoslovakia\n\nMemoria (2021), Colombia\n\nMonsieur Hulot’s Holiday, France\n\nWinter on Fire: Ukraine’s Fight for Freedom, Ukraine\n\nLet’s spotlight a few others here I haven’t mentioned yet. Nguyễn-Võ Minh’s Buffalo Boy is a coming-of-age tale in far southern rural Vietnam that goes about its drama methodically, capturing a place and time so unlike anything you will find in the movies. Like an American Western, Buffalo Boy asks questions of morality and masculinity in an unforgiving landscape. Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot or Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday is Jacques Tati’s introduction of his iconic character - the silent, pipe-smoking, behatted, clumsy M. Hulot. The best Hulot movie would come later, but so began the legend of one of the most important silent comic protagonists in filmmaking.\n\nBest Silent Film\n\nThe Doll\n\nThe Oyster Princess\n\nSidewalk Stories\n\nThree Women (1924)\n\nI wasn’t too much a fan of Three Women, but I wasn’t able to get to many silent films in 2022. Hopefully that changes for the next year.\n\nPersonal Favorite Film\n\nThe Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970)\n\nDrive My Car\n\nGlass Onion\n\nGo for Broke! (1951)\n\nHilda and the Mountain King\n\nThe Ladykillers\n\nThe Masque of Red Death (1964)\n\nMisterios de ultratumba (Black Pit of Dr. M) (1959, Mexico)\n\nA Patch of Blue\n\nTime After Time (1979)\n\nI’ll always point out that the films I considered to be the best of what I’ve seen in a calendar year aren’t necessarily my favorites. Too many film critics conflate the quality of the films they see with their personal preferences. There’s a strict separation for me. This year, Roger Corman’s The Masque of Red Death - starring Vincent Price and distributed by American International Pictures (AIP) - takes the cake as my personal favorite. AIP made eight Edgar Allan Poe adaptations from 1960-1964; each one directed by Corman and starring Price, each one not strictly keeping to Poe’s text. I’m a fan of Poe, and don’t expect a strict adaptation from the AIP/Corman/Price movies. The garish Technicolor? The complete commitment to character from Price though he’s surrounded by other actors who can’t act half as good as him? The sumptuous costuming and production design for this gothic horror movie? Couldn’t get enough of it.\n\nClose behind were Glass Onion and the delightful sci-fi Time After Time, which imagines what would’ve happened if H.G. Wells actually built a time machine and transported himself to late ‘70s San Francisco. Now only if they can get a home media release of Misterios de ultratumba with English subtitles, because what a treat that movie was.\n\nBest Director\n\nRomán Viñoly Barreto, La bestia debe morir\n\nJane Campion, The Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nThe Daniels, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nEdmund Goulding, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nRyûsuke Hamaguchi, Drive My Car\n\nErnst Lubitsch, The Doll\n\nAlexander Mackendrick, The Ladykillers\n\nCéline Sciamma, Petite Maman\n\nSteven Spielberg, The Fabelmans (2022)\n\nJacques Tati, Monsieur Hulot’s Holiday\n\nThis category usually aligns pretty closely with Best Picture. Never nominated in this category and having never won before, it’s Ernst Lubitsch who takes Best Director this year for his saucy and vivacious silent romantic comedy. Lubitsch was a foundational director when it came to comedies in cinema, and I don’t a lot of contemporary filmmakers know enough about him or appreciate him enough. What an achievement too, to have made The Doll only a year after the conclusion of the Great War and the economic turmoil Germany was facing then.\n\nRunner-up would have been Hamaguchi, and perhaps Mackendrick after that.\n\nBest Acting Ensemble\n\nThe Ballad of Cable Hogue\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin (2022)\n\nDrive My Car\n\nEverything Everywhere All At Once\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nGlass Onion\n\nThe Ladykillers\n\nA Mighty Wind\n\nNightmare Alley (1947)\n\n9 to 5\n\nHats off to the gangsters played by Alec Guinness, Cecil Parker, Herbert Lom, Danny Green, and Peter Sellers. And a huge ovation for Katie Johnson, who plays the old lady who gives their “string quintet” lodging. She is incredible and terrifically funny in this. Perfectly cast, incredibly acted, dripping with comedic sensibilities threatening to explode into violence (at least from the men’s side of things), they take Best Acting Ensemble.\n\nThis was a close call though, as several others had a shout to win here.\n\nBest Actor\n\nAustin Butler, Elvis (2022)\n\nSoumitra Chatterjee, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People)\n\nCary Grant, Penny Serenade (1941)\n\nAlec Guinness, The Ladykillers\n\nNarciso Ibáñez Menta, La bestia debe morir\n\nHidetoshi Nishijima, Drive My Car\n\nSidney Poitier, A Patch of Blue\n\nTyrone Power, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nJason Robards, The Ballad of Cable Hogue\n\nDenzel Washington, The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nArguably Tyrone Power’s finest few hours in any movie. As the scheming con man who stumbles his way into a carnival, this film is extremely removed from Power’s roles as crowd-pleasing, romantic, dark-and-handsome, swashbuckling heroes at his home studio 20th Century Fox. Power said later in life that Nightmare Alley was his favorite of all the films he made, and it is easy to see why.\n\nI was also strongly considering Chatterjee, Menta, Nishijima, and Washington as well here.\n\nBest Actress\n\nJoan Crawford, Johnny Guitar (1954)\n\nDoris Day, Pillow Talk\n\nIrene Dunne, Penny Serenade\n\nElizabeth Hartman, A Patch of Blue\n\nKatie Johnson, The Ladykillers\n\nFrances McDormand, The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nTôko Miura, Drive My Car\n\nBarbara Stanwyck, No Man of Her Own (1950)\n\nMichelle Williams, The Fabelmans\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nSo often the talk around Doris Day is to liken her to that “prudish innocent blonde that your mother/grandmother wanted to be”. That is reductive, and ignores her incredible dramatic (I almost double-nominated her here for Love Me or Leave Me, which was a dramatic role) and comedic talents. And she is something else here in Pillow Talk - a raunchy (for the time) romcom that helped contribute to the demise of Hollywood’s self-censoring Hays Code. Comedic timing? Perfect. Facial and bodily acting? Exactly what the part calls for and then some. Pillow Talk was the first of three groundbreaking romcoms she made with leading star Rock Hudson and supporting Actor Tony Randall (1961′s Lover Come Back and 1964′s Send Me No Flowers).\n\nSo many choices here, with almost every actress nominated here having a case to win it. This was a difficult decision.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nGuillermo Battaglia, La bestia debe morir\n\nLyle Bettger, No Man of Her Own\n\nBobby Darin, Pressure Point (1962)\n\nTroy Kotsur, CODA (2021)\n\nMasaki Okada, Drive My Car\n\nNathán Pinzón, El vampiro negro (1953, Argentina)\n\nKe Huy Quan, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nTony Randall, Pillow Talk\n\nKodi Smit-McPhee, The Power of the Dog\n\nDavid Warner, The Ballad of Cable Hogue\n\nAs I joke every year, this is the category that favors villains. The winner this year is no different. If you have seen Fritz Lang’s M (1931, Germany), then I don’t have to say much other than that Nathán Pinzón plays the Peter Lorre character in this adaptation of M. Pinzón was a longtime character actor well-known to Argentinian audiences, but virtually nowhere else. In Latin American cinema at this time, “melodrama” is not a pejorative term when it comes to the acting style. The default in this era is to be histrionic. So how startling it is to see Pinzón play his role - a serial killer - quietly, with sadness and pathos to spare.\n\nHis countryman, Guillermo Battaglia, also has a loathsome part to play in another Argentinian noir, and was close to notching this win. So too were Quan and Warner.\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nGloria Castilla, El vampiro negro\n\nKerry Condon, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nAunjanue Ellis, King Richard\n\nKathryn Hunter, The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nJulie London, The Red House (1947)\n\nMercedes McCambridge, Johnny Guitar\n\nNina Meurisse, Petite Maman\n\nEdna May Oliver, Drums Along the Mohawk (1939)\n\nPark Yoo-rim, Drive My Car\n\nShelley Winters, A Patch of Blue\n\nFiery, antagonistic, scene-stealing. That’s Mercedes McCambridge in Johnny Guitar for you. In the battle of feminine Western intelligence and will, McCambridge’s character may be the loser in the end, but the performance is an absolute winner. Colored by repressed sexuality (which has lent many queer interpretations between her character’s relationship to Crawford’s) and a stiffness that works in the context of the film, this was a memorable performance from McCambridge. Condon, Ellis, Hunter, and London were my next choices.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nNguyễn-Võ Minh, Buffalo Boy\n\nHanns Kräly and Ernst Lubitsch, The Doll\n\nRyûsuke Hamaguchi and Takamasa Oe, Drive My Car\n\nSatyajit Ray, Ganashatru (An Enemy of the People)\n\nMiloš Forman, Jaroslav Papoušek, Ivan Passer, and Václav Šašek, Loves of a Blonde\n\nJules Furthman, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nGuy Green, A Patch of Blue\n\nJane Campion and Thomas Savage, The Power of the Dog\n\nNicholas Meyer, Time After Time\n\nAlberto Etchebehere and Román Viñoly Barreto, El vampiro negro\n\nA touching, meditative from Hamaguchi and Oe gets the Adapted Screenplay crown, over very stiff competition. Closest competitors, to me, were Loves of a Blonde and Nightmare Alley.\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nMartin McDonagh, The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nRon Shelton, Bull Durham (1988)\n\nThe Daniels, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nSteven Spielberg and Tony Kushner, The Fabelmans\n\nWilliam Rose and Jimmy O’Connor,The Ladykillers\n\nColin Higgins and Patricia Resnick, 9 to 5\n\nJordan Peele, Nope (2022)\n\nCéline Sciamma, Petite Maman\n\nStanley Shapiro and Maurice Richlin, Pillow Talk\n\nCharles Lane, Sidewalk Stories\n\nSteven Spielberg has become so legendary, he’s come full circle: audiences and critics and historians now take him for granted. The Fabelmans remains in theaters as of the writing of this sentence, and it’s going to make very little money (blame COVID, a moviegoing culture that only goes to theaters when it’s mainstream American animation or superheroes, etc.). But it’s a beautiful screenplay from him and Kushner, exploring how filmmaking was a means that allowed him to understand his friends and family, and all the childhood trauma that emanated from both.\n\nAfter that, I might have given this to The Ladykillers or Petite Maman on another day.\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nAlberto Etchebehere, La bestia debe morir\n\nYves Cape, Buffalo Boy\n\nHidetoshi Shinomiya, Drive My Car\n\nBert Glennon and Ray Rennahan, Drums Along the Mohawk\n\nHarry Stradling, Sr., Johnny Guitar\n\nSayombhu Mukdeeprom, Memoria\n\nVictor Herrera, Misterios de ultratumba (Black Pit of Dr. M)\n\nLee Garmes, Nightmare Alley (1947)\n\nAri Wegner, The Power of the Dog\n\nGabriel Figueroa, The Scapular (1968, Mexico)\n\nIn his first appearance in this category, arguably Mexico’s greatest cinematographer ever takes the prize. Figueroa started out as a still photographer when, in the 1930s, he was introduced to filmmaking by his friends. He took some time in the late 1930s to earn a scholarship and study under Gregg Toland (1940′s The Grapes of Wrath, 1941′s Citizen Kane) for one year. He came home to Mexico and became a black-and-white cinematography specialist. And in The Scapular comes some of the most evocative, terrifying, and awe-inspiring images I’ve seen in a black-and-white film. All this after that format was already losing momentum in Hollywood itself. Fantastic work.\n\nAfter Figueroa, I was thinking perhaps Mukdeeprom, Garmes, or Cape.\n\nBest Film Editing\n\nDavid Brenner, James Cameron, John Refoua, and Stephen E. Rivkin, Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)\n\nPaul Rogers, Everything Everywhere All At Once\n\nSarah Broshar and Michael Kahn, The Fabelmans\n\nRay Curtiss, The Gang’s All Here\n\nBob Ducsay, Glass Onion\n\nJosé Serra, La bestia debe morir\n\nPamela Martin, King Richard\n\nMiroslav Hájek, Loves of a Blonde\n\nNicholas Monsour, Nope\n\nJoel Coen and Lucian Johnston, The Tragedy of Macbeth\n\nBest to watch it yourself and see what I mean. EEAAO would be an absolute mess without its terrific editing. Avatar, The Gang’s All Here, and The Tragedy of Macbeth were next considered.\n\nBest Adaptation or Musical Score\n\nGeorge Burns, Babes in Toyland (1961)\n\nCarol Hall, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas\n\nCharles Henderson and Alfred Newman, The Gang’s All Here\n\nGeorge Duning, Ladies of the Chorus\n\nGeorge Stoll and Robert Van Eps, Love Me or Leave Me\n\nEugen Illin, Loves of a Blonde\n\nTom Halm, A Mighty Wind\n\nErnest Irving, The Proud Valley (1940)\n\nGeorge Parrish, Start Cheering\n\nCharlie Smalls, The Wiz\n\nIn a category that advantages original musicals over adaptations and combination scores or original and adapted musical, it’s an original musical mockumentary that wins here. If I learned anything about my followers over MOABOS, it’s that many of them don’t like American folk music. Alas, for the amount of songs composed for this film, and for the instrumental fidelity to the American folk tradition, A Mighty Wind blows the competition away.\n\nWell, mostly. The Gang’s All Here and Love Me or Leave Me had a decent chance, too.\n\nBest Original Score\n\nTerence Blanchard, The Woman King (2022)\n\nElmer Bernstein, The Black Cauldron (1985)\n\nBruce Broughton, The Rescuers Down Under\n\nSimon Franglen, Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nMichael Giacchino, The Batman (2022)\n\nJerry Goldsmith, A Patch of Blue\n\nMarc Marder, Sidewalk Stories\n\nMiklós Rózsa, The Red House\n\nMiklós Rózsa, Time After Time\n\nVictor Young, Johnny Guitar\n\nOkay, some of my friends, family, and followers didn’t like “Johnny Guitar”. But Victor Young’s score to that movie incorporated the central tune gorgeously across the film’s runtime. A rumbling, dramatic dynamo of a score fits the action and dialogue scenes beautifully, and wins for the second time in this category in as many attempts (in 2013, Young won for his score to another Western, 1953′s Shane).\n\nRózsa for Time After Time, Blanchard, and Franglen were also under consideration as the winners here.\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“I’ll Never Stop Loving You”, music by Nicholas Brodszky, lyrics by Sammy Cahn, Love Me or Leave Me\n\n“Island in the Sun”, music and lyrics by Harry Belafonte and Irving Burgie, Island in the Sun (1957)\n\n“Johnny Guitar”, music by Victor Young, lyrics by Peggy Lee, Johnny Guitar\n\n“A Journey to a Star”, music by Harry Warren, lyrics by Leo Robin, The Gang’s All Here\n\n“A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow”, music and lyrics by Michael McKean and Annette O’Toole, A Mighty Wind\n\n“Love Survives”, music and lyrics by Al Kasha, Joel Hirschhorn, Mike Curb, and Michael Lloyd, All Dogs Go to Heaven\n\n“9 to 5”, music and lyrics by Dolly Parton, 9 to 5\n\n“Someone’s Waiting for You”, music by Sammy Fain, lyrics by Carol Connors and Ayn Robbins, The Rescuers\n\n“Tomorrow is the Song I Sing”, music by Jerry Goldsmith, lyrics by Richard Gillis, The Ballad of Cable Hogue\n\n“Why Should I Worry?”, music and lyrics by Dan Hartman and Charlie Midnight, Oliver & Company\n\nMy thanks again to those of you who participated in the Movie Odyssey Award for Best Original Song’s (MOABOS) tenth edition.
