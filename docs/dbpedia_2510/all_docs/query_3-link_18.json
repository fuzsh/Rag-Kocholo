        "text": "Introduction\n\nThere is a growing consensus that civil forfeiture is a problem. Critics from across the ideological spectrum—including, it seems, on the current Supreme Court —argue that the government’s tremendous authority to seize and condemn private property in response to alleged lawbreaking violates fundamental principles of American justice. Yet thanks to history, constitutional doctrine has proven largely intractable. In rejecting claims that the Constitution meaningfully constrains civil forfeiture, the Court has long relied on a perceived historical tradition of unfettered government ability to forfeit property without criminal process. Though the Court has acknowledged the apparent injustice of core aspects of the modern forfeiture regime, it has consistently asserted that civil forfeiture’s historical pedigree makes it too late to turn back now.\n\nThis Article demonstrates that the Court’s understanding of civil forfeiture’s early history is mistaken. Forfeiture at the Founding was highly circumscribed, but in ways courts and commentators have wholly failed to recognize. To be sure, early forfeiture was, on the surface, as harsh and unforgiving as modern Supreme Court opinions describe. The government regularly seized high-value property in response to minor and technical violations. It frequently used the forfeiture power to punish lawbreaking in situations where personal penalties against indi­viduals would have been available. In fact, the early government seem­ingly used forfeiture precisely in the ways that modern critics find so objectionable: as a means of imposing punishment free of the restraints that ordinary criminal process would impose.\n\nAt the same time, however, this Article shows that, in practice, early forfeiture was far more constrained than previously recognized. Based on original research into more than 500 unpublished cases filed in federal district court from 1789 to 1807, this Article reveals a Founding Era consensus that forfeiture’s punitive potential necessitated meaningful limits on its use. The mechanism was administrative “remission” of penal­ties, a critical aspect of early federal law enforcement practice that has gone unnoticed by legal scholars and historians. Proposed and put into motion by Alexander Hamilton, the remission power gave the Treasury Secretary broad—and effectively unreviewable—authority to return seized property to those who unintentionally violated the law. What is more, the early court records demonstrate that Hamilton and his successors understood themselves to be obligated to exercise that author­ity to its fullest extent, granting relief in over ninety percent of cases presented to them, despite concerns among contemporaries over the negative consequences of permissive remission practice. The result was an early forfeiture regime constrained by a deep belief in the impro­priety of taking property from those who lacked real culpability.\n\nUnderstanding early forfeiture’s true nature has significant implica­tions for debate about its proper limits today. As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, civil forfeiture’s historical bona fides are critical to its constitutional legitimacy. This Article’s revelation of the constraints that remission imposed on early forfeiture calls into question key historical propositions underlying Court decisions insulating civil forfeiture from constitutional challenge. First, in rejecting claims that the Due Process Clause requires a defense to forfeiture for “innocent owners”—those who did not participate in the criminal conduct in which their property was involved—the Court has consistently taken the view that forfeiture was historically permissible even in response to unintentional violations of the law. Second, the Court’s belief that in rem civil forfeitures—actions against property, not people—were traditionally not understood to be “punishment” has left uncertain whether civil forfeitures are sub­ject to the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause and its requirement that a penalty be proportional to the offense.\n\nYet as this Article shows, innocence and proportionality were core concerns in the Founding Era, raising significant doubts about the historical justifications for the Court’s pro-government jurisprudence. What is more, it appears that the limits the early Congress and the Executive imposed on forfeiture were the product of broad agreement that such constraints were a necessary corollary to government exercise of the forfeiture power, and perhaps even a constitutional one. Accord­ingly, this Article’s account of early forfeiture suggests that history may offer an affirmative basis for greater constitutional limits on forfeiture’s exercise today. At minimum, the evidence of a Founding Era consensus that core principles of justice demanded meaningful limits on forfei­ture’s exercise suggests that renewed scrutiny of the Court’s modern doctrinal conclusions is warranted.\n\nThis is the right time to engage in such a reexamination, given the growing skepticism about civil forfeiture’s propriety among the Court’s current members. Though the Court recently declined to address directly whether civil forfeiture is subject to the limitations in the Excessive Fines Clause, that question is likely to reoccur. And even if a wholesale reconsideration of civil forfeiture’s constitutionality may not be imminent, the Court’s apparent receptiveness to questions about forfei­ture’s historical justifications makes a critical reassessment of the past all the more important now.\n\nThis Article proceeds as follows: Part I outlines civil forfeiture’s current constitutional status, paying special attention to the historical justifications the Supreme Court has advanced for refusing to apply to civil forfeiture several constitutional protections that apply in criminal proceedings.\n\nPart II describes an early forfeiture regime that was, in theory and in practice, substantively broad and procedurally favorable to the govern­ment. This history poses a challenge for forfeiture’s modern critics, and they have sought to counter its relevance by arguing that early forfeiture served limited purposes. As the Part demonstrates, those efforts fail. Rather than using forfeiture simply to remove dangerous items from commercial circulation or reach lawbreakers who were otherwise beyond the courts’ jurisdiction, early federal officials exercised their power as a means of imposing severe penalties outside the criminal process.\n\nAs Part III demonstrates, however, there were meaningful limits on early forfeiture, but they came from a different source than current debate imagines. Prompted by concerns that the government’s broad power to take private property might work significant injustices, Congress gave the Treasury Secretary the ability to remit forfeitures incurred by those who unintentionally broke the law. Turning to actual practice, this Part shows that the early Secretaries remitted lawfully incurred forfei­tures when presented with any credible explanation for why the violation was not motivated by fraudulent intent. As the Part further explains, this generosity pushed the boundaries of the congressional scheme, transforming a discretionary authority to provide relief in deserving cases into a mandate to mitigate the harsh results that flowed from the government’s maximal use of the forfeiture power as a tool of law enforcement.\n\nPart IV considers what the history of the federal government’s forfeiture and remission practices might tell us about constitutional limits on the forfeiture power today. The early government’s remission practices raise significant doubts about the historical underpinnings of the Supreme Court’s forfeiture jurisprudence regarding the “innocent owner” defense and the proportionality requirement. And although the evidence is circumstantial, there is reason to think that the early regime’s permissiveness was driven by a belief in the constitutional necessity of protecting forfeiture’s victims from unjust results. The Part closes by discussing whether a revised understanding of forfeiture’s history necessi­tates the recognition of judicially enforceable limits on that power today.\n\nI. The Problem of Forfeiture\n\nCivil forfeiture is controversial, to say the least. Though many of the most contentious debates around forfeiture took place in the 1990s, there has been a resurgence of criticism in recent years. Despite legisla­tive reforms in the past two decades that have placed some limits on state and federal civil forfeiture, federal law enforcement alone continues to seize billions of dollars’ worth of property each year. And there is little reason to think that the trend will reverse anytime soon. While the federal government under President Obama took steps to reduce its use of civil forfeiture, the Trump Administration has indicated its firm be­lief that forfeiture is a valuable and legitimate law enforcement tool going forward.\n\nWhile advocates argue that government power to seize and condemn private property outside the criminal process is a necessary tool of law enforcement, critics contend that modern civil forfeiture is out of control. Noting the astounding sums of money governments recoup through civil forfeiture, critics charge that law enforcement authorities use this power to seize valuable assets from vulnerable victims who are often never convicted of a crime (or even arrested). And because law enforcement often keeps the proceeds of forfeited property, civil forfei­ture is rife with abuse.\n\nWhat most outrages many of civil forfeiture’s critics is the lack of legal protections for the owners of property seized by the government. Though recent state and federal legislative reforms have granted prop­erty owners increased protections from forfeiture, many critics contend that they do not do enough to level the playing field. The deeper problem is constitutional: According to longstanding Supreme Court doctrine, most of the rights that criminal defendants enjoy under the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments do not apply in civil forfeiture proceedings. As a result, critics charge that the government often uses civil forfeiture as a means of imposing penalties for alleged lawbreaking free of the constraints of the criminal process. Given the potentially enormous costs forfeiture can impose on its victims, critics argue that heightened protections are not simply warranted as a policy matter but also as a constitutional one.\n\nArguments in favor of stronger constitutional protections against civil forfeiture have largely fallen on deaf ears at the Court. While the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in the civil forfeiture context, the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause does not. Nor does the claimant to the property the government seeks to forfeit have a right to counsel. The govern­ment’s high burden of proof in criminal cases does not apply in civil forfeiture proceedings, and critics argue that the statutory “preponder­ance of the evidence” standard that applies in most civil forfeiture cases unfairly offers prosecutors a means of bypassing the more stringent requirements of criminal prosecutions. Critics also point to the high rate of uncontested forfeitures in the present day as evidence that mod­ern statutory and constitutional notice requirements—which call for “efforts to provide actual notice to all interested parties” —are insuffi­ciently protective of potential claimants’ interests in seized property. Critics similarly rue that jury trials are not required for most civil forfeiture, and decry the fact that, in many cases, the government can forfeit property without going to court at all.\n\nIn two particular areas, the Supreme Court’s refusal to extend con­stitutional protections to civil forfeiture proceedings has been based in significant part on the Court’s reading of forfeiture’s history. First, the Court has declined to recognize an “innocent owner” exception to for­feiture under the Due Process Clause, much to critics’ consternation. Even when a property owner did not participate in—or even know about—lawbreaking conduct, the Court has consistently held that property involved in the offense is nonetheless subject to civil for­feiture. Whether it is a boat used to transport a small amount of marijuana, or a car used in solicitation of prostitution or to carry moonshine, such property is forfeit to the government “even though the owner did not know that it was to be put to such use.”\n\nThe Court has recognized the harshness of this rule. The assertion that it is simply unfair for the government to take property from people with no involvement in or knowledge of the underlying unlawful conduct “has considerable appeal,” the Court admits. It would be “unduly op­pressive” and “[il]legitimate” to allow forfeiture in cases where not only was the owner unaware of and uninvolved in the violation, but where they had not been negligent in entrusting their property to the wrong­doer. Indeed, the Court has acknowledged that forfeiting property belonging to persons uninvolved in the underlying offense “seems to violate that justice which should be the foundation of the due process of law required by the Constitution.”\n\nYet despite these reservations, the Court has consistently rejected assertions of an “innocent owner” defense, on the strength of a per­ceived historical tradition of ignoring claims to innocence in civil forfeiture. Citing “a long and unbroken line of cases” allowing forfeiture of property belonging to those with no involvement in the offense, in 1996 the Court declared that it was too late to reverse course. Such cases were “too firmly fixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced.”\n\nThis perceived historical tradition is not simply window dressing: It is crucial to the Court’s jurisprudence. As the Court explained a century ago, were a case raising an innocent-owner defense “the first of its kind,” the Court would be compelled to take that argument very seriously. But the “historical background of forfeiture statutes in this country” and prior decisions “sustaining their constitutionality” necessarily lead the Court to conclude that the Due Process Clause offers no protection to innocent owners. The question, as the Court put it, has “long been settled.” Critics counter that the Court has overlooked historical prece­dents supporting more robust constitutional protection for innocent owners in the context of in personam and criminal forfeitures, and that the Court has ignored important subtleties in the precedents upon which it relies. Yet even the critics have been obliged to concede that, as a general historical proposition, “the innocence of owners is formally irrelevant to in rem forfeiture.”\n\nSecond is a question—less settled but no less consequential—that reappeared on the Court’s docket just last term: whether civil forfeiture is “punishment” for purposes of the Eighth Amendment’s Excessive Fines Clause. Under the Court’s jurisprudence, the Clause applies to penalties imposed by the government “as punishment for some of­fense.” If a government-imposed penalty is punishment, then it must satisfy the Clause’s requirement that the penalty be “proportional” to the underlying offense—as the Court has held with respect to criminal forfeitures. But if a penalty (like civil forfeiture) is not punishment, then the Clause’s limitations are irrelevant, and the Constitution cannot curtail the massive forfeitures that modern critics decry.\n\nHere, too, the Court’s understanding of history has profoundly influenced its jurisprudence, though with uncertain results. In Austin v. United States, the Court’s view seemed clear enough: Statutory forfeiture of property via in rem proceedings was “historically” understood as punishment, and therefore modern analogues are subject to the Clause’s proportionality requirement. The Court based this conclusion on its reading of English and early American history—particularly on statutes passed by the First Congress—as well as on its own precedents. In par­ticular, the Austin Court noted that it was permissible for the government to use forfeiture to penalize those who negligently entrusted their property to wrongdoers—a theory that only makes sense if forfeiture is understood to be “punishment” for such negligence.\n\nYet only five years later, in United States v. Bajakajian, the Court ap­peared to reverse course. It declared that because “[t]raditional in rem forfeitures” were historically not considered punishment, they “occupy a place outside the domain of the Excessive Fines Clause.” Relying on many of the same cases cited in Austin, the Bajakajian Court focused on the “guilty property” fiction running through its precedents—the idea that in rem forfeiture is punishment directed against the property itself. The Court reasoned that such forfeitures were traditionally not consid­ered to be punishment “against [an] individual for an offense,” and are therefore outside the Clause’s ambit.\n\nIt is difficult to square these decisions, and because the forfeiture actually at issue in Bajakajian was a criminal forfeiture, there is reason to doubt whether the Bajakajian Court’s description of civil forfeiture’s historically nonpunitive nature is controlling as to the applicability of the Excessive Fines Clause. That said, in between Austin and Bajakajian, the Court deemed civil forfeiture not to be punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. In United States v. Ursery, the Court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause generally did not bar parallel criminal and civil forfeiture proceedings, given the “traditional understanding” held “[s]ince the earliest years of this Nation” that “civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment.” Though the Ursery Court sought to distinguish Austin by disclaiming any necessary “parallel” between the Excessive Fines and Dou­ble Jeopardy Clauses, Ursery’s conclusion that civil forfeiture was histori­cally considered nonpunitive—subsequently reaffirmed in Bajakajian—seems to be the Court’s considered view of the question.\n\nIrrespective of any confusion on the Court regarding civil forfei­ture’s punitive nature, what is certain is that a definitive answer to the question whether the Eighth Amendment applies to civil forfeiture will likely turn on the Court’s understanding of forfeiture’s history. That much is evident from Timbs v. Indiana, a recently decided case in which the Court concluded that the Excessive Fines Clause is incorporated against the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. Recognizing that it was almost certain to lose on this question, the State of Indiana focused on persuading the Court to rule that, irrespective of incorporation, civil forfeitures are not subject to the Clause. The state’s argument for ex­empting civil forfeiture from constitutional scrutiny was almost entirely historical; in particular, the state asserted that forfeitures have always been considered nonpunitive.\n\nThe Timbs Court did not take the state’s bait. Because the courts below had not addressed the question of whether the Clause applies to civil forfeitures, the Court limited itself to answering the incorporation question. But it is doubtful that the question of the Clause’s applicability to civil forfeiture will escape review for long. There is confu­sion among the lower courts on this issue, and the current Justices’ apparent willingness to entertain questions regarding civil forfeiture’s constitutionality ensures that aggrieved litigants will not be shy about seeking the Court’s review going forward.\n\nII. Forfeiture at the Founding\n\nGiven the centrality of history in Supreme Court decisions assessing forfeiture’s constitutionality, a nuanced understanding of how the early federal government used civil forfeiture as a tool of law enforcement is crucial. To develop such an understanding, this Part reviews both the statutory regime governing civil forfeiture in the post–Founding Era and the government’s enforcement practices, to see how early forfeiture actually worked. The findings present a challenge for forfeiture’s modern critics. As section II.A describes, the enforcement scheme Congress devised enabled the government to impose substantial penalties for even trivial and unintentional violations of the law, with little process required to effectuate a seizure and forfeiture. And because federal officers re­ceived a share of the proceeds from every forfeiture in which they were involved, they had a strong financial incentive to exercise this power to its fullest extent. Viewed in isolation, the expansiveness of the early regime suggests that the Court is correct in concluding constitutional protections for forfeiture’s victims are historically unjustified.\n\nFaced with a challenging historical record, modern-day advocates for more stringent limits on civil forfeiture have sought to confine this history’s relevance. They argue that forfeiture, while potentially expan­sive in scope, was traditionally limited in its purposes and should be similarly confined today. As section II.B explains, however, Founding Era practices undermine this argument. While it is true that forfeiture served the limited purposes the critics identify, this Article’s investigation into early court records and government correspondence reveals that the federal officers also used the power more broadly. Indeed, the historical record suggests that the government used forfeiture precisely in the ways in which modern critics find so objectionable: as an easier path to impos­ing penalties for lawbreaking than ordinary criminal process would allow.\n\nA. Forfeiture Unfettered\n\nFrom the federal government’s earliest days, forfeiture was critical to law enforcement. In the period studied here, Congress authorized the federal government to seize property connected with—among other things—arms exportation, slave trading, violating U.S. neutrality, al­cohol distilling, sugar and snuff refining, and trading with native peo­ples. In almost every area the federal government regulated, forfeiture was one of the primary tools of law enforcement. In some cases, the government could forfeit commercial goods, like illegally traded arms or cargo involved in unlawful native trading. In other cases, the government could seize ships that facilitated a legal violation, as for slave trade or neutrality violations. And it could often take both.\n\nFirst and foremost, forfeiture was a tool for enforcing the legislative scheme governing revenue collection—in particular, the customs duties imposed on goods imported into the United States. These duties were the national government’s lifeblood. During the period studied here—and well into the nineteenth century—receipts from import duties con­stituted the lion’s share of the federal government’s total revenue.\n\nGiven the importance of revenue, one of Congress’s primary items of business in 1789 was to organize customs collection. The first Collec­tion Act established collection districts along the eastern seaboard, each with a collector responsible for supervising the payment of duties. When a ship sailed into port, its master made entry at the collector’s office, providing a manifest indicating the cargo on board. Based on the manifest and inspection of the cargo, the collector (or his subordi­nates) would determine the amount of duties owed. An accurate assess­ment of duties depended on a full and complete accounting of the type and quantity of goods being brought into the country. Goods that escaped notice—either accidentally or by subterfuge—compromised the government’s ability to collect the revenue it was due.\n\nTo prevent evasions, customs inspectors regularly boarded ships arriving into port to examine documents and supervise the unloading of cargo. Once on board, if the officer had any “reason to suspect” that dutiable goods were being concealed, he could conduct a full search, with no warrant needed. Similarly, when officers learned of goods already landed on shore, they could obtain a search warrant for goods concealed “in any particular dwelling-house, store, building, or other place.”\n\nTo aid officers in their efforts to collect duties owed, the early forfeiture prohibitions Congress established were aimed at discouraging customs evasion. Some attacked the problem directly: For example, goods unloaded from a ship without an officer’s consent were subject to forfeiture. Goods omitted from the ship’s manifest, or inaccurately de­scribed, were also forfeited, as were goods invoiced at a lower value than their price at the place of export. Other regulations aimed at curtailing smuggling indirectly by making it more difficult to pull off. Goods im­ported in ships under a certain size were forfeited, as were beer and spirituous liquors imported in undersized containers. These proscrip­tions—even the most arbitrary seeming—were designed to make it more difficult for merchants to avoid paying duties owed on the goods they shipped.\n\nImportantly, forfeiture also extended to the ships that transported illegally imported goods. If a ship landed cargo worth more than $400 without a permit, both the goods and the vessel were subject to forfei­ture. The penalty for receiving such goods was a heavy fine (triple the goods’ value) and forfeiture of the receiving vessel. Ships could also be seized for fraudulently pretending to be American owned (which allowed them to benefit from lower import duties) or for unlicensed engage­ment in interstate trade (open only to Americans). Similar penalties were available for even minor infractions; for instance, importation of bottled beer in packages of fewer than six dozen bottles subjected both the beer and the vessel to forfeiture. In short, potentially severe penal­ties attached to a range of customs violations.\n\nIn addition to authorizing stiff punishments, the initial legislative scheme governing customs collection was harsh in another sense: It was largely a strict liability regime. With a few exceptions, those who violated the law were subject to penalties irrespective of whether they intended to evade paying the duties they owed. For example, of the dozens of prohibitions in the first Collection Act, only two depended on the offend­er’s state of mind. For all other transgressions, a penalty attached to even unintentional offenses. Working in combination, the forfeiture and liability provisions Congress enacted enabled the government to seize highly valuable property for unknowing violations of a host of technical requirements related to maritime commerce.\n\nThe statutory scheme governing customs collection also gave officials strong incentive to pursue such forfeitures. By law, half of the proceeds from a forfeiture went to the United States, and the other half was divided equally among the three principal customs officers for the district in which the seizure took place. Informants also received a cut of the proceeds, and certain nonrevenue statutes allowed informants to seek forfeiture directly via a qui tam action in their own name. If suc­cessful, the informant and the government shared the proceeds equally.\n\nSharing in forfeitures was a potentially strong inducement for customs officers. During this period the government repeatedly sought high-value forfeitures, some worth thousands of dollars. Given the mod­est income most officers received, even a partial share of such seizures represented a substantial financial boon. As a result, customs officers not only had significant authority to seize and condemn property in response to lawbreaking; they also had good reason to use that power.\n\nAuthority and incentives were not the only factors that encouraged expansive use of forfeiture, as the process for forfeiting seized ships and goods was relatively simple. The customs collector brought suit in federal district court, though the suit was actually initiated by the federal dis­trict attorney at the collector’s behest. The district attorney filed a complaint in the name of the United States, called a “libel” or an “infor­mation” in rem—that is, the suit was against the vessels or goods themselves. The libel did not need to include any details; a basic state­ment setting forth the articles to be forfeited and the alleged statutory violation was sufficient.\n\nThe notice requirement was similarly minimal. The court had to provide fourteen days’ notice of the proceedings, but this only required the marshal of the court to post notice of the suit in a local newspaper and in a public place. Neither the government nor the court had to make any effort to identify and directly notify interested parties, and even the limited publication requirement was not always enforced. If no one filed a claim in opposition—which was often the case —after a few weeks the court would enter default judgment in favor of the government.\n\nThe government also enjoyed significant advantages in the few cases that went to trial. Though as a general matter both sides presented evi­dence, often including live and written testimony from various witnesses, under the original legislative scheme it was the defending claimant who bore the burden of proof—that is, they had to disprove that a violation had occurred. Congress adjusted this burden in 1795 so that it applied if only the government first showed that there was “probable cause” for the prosecution. But that itself was a fairly low bar for the government to surmount, and one it likely met in any case it bothered to bring.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, customs forfeitures were tried before a judge, not a jury. This makes intuitive sense: Juries in the colonial period had long favored claimants and defendants against the government in trade and revenue cases, and their stubbornness was one of the principal reasons the British government gave jurisdiction over revenue cases to the vice-admiralty courts in the colonies (which sat without a jury). In­deed, in the early years of the federal courts, juries continued to render defendant-friendly verdicts in cases where the government sought mone­tary fines in personam.\n\nYet if the jury’s absence in early forfeiture cases is understandable, it is nonetheless noteworthy. One of the prime sources of colonial outrage in the run-up to the American Revolution was precisely the fact that trade and revenue cases were tried to a jury in England (generally in the Court of Exchequer), but in the colonies they were tried to a judge in the British vice-admiralty courts. Despite this background, and the use of juries in early state admiralty courts, the early federal courts appear to have adopted a practice of trying revenue-related forfeiture actions with­out a jury. This change did not happen overnight; the records examined for this project reveal a small handful of suits against goods or vessels that were tried to a jury. But those cases appear to be outliers. By the close of the period studied here, the Supreme Court had definitively ruled that all seizures under the nation’s impost, trade, and navigation laws made on navigable waters were “admiralty causes” and therefore tried to a judge.\n\nFull consideration of why the early federal courts embraced a feature of British governance that Americans viewed as anathema only two decades earlier is beyond the scope of this Article. But the simplest ex­planation is that, when faced with the task of constructing a viable revenue system, the Founders—like Parliament and crown officials in an earlier period—did not want obstructionist juries to undermine the government’s ability to collect much-needed revenue. They instead wanted to ensure that the government would be able to use forfeiture to its fullest extent.\n\nB. The Search for Limits\n\nThe picture of early forfeiture that emerges from the records is a harsh—and perhaps familiar—one. The forfeiture power was highly punitive in both theory and practice, imposing significant penalties for minor transgressions, through procedures that both gave the govern­ment significant advantages and provided significant personal rewards to the enforcers. In short, at first blush the early practice appears to confirm the portrait of unfettered government power the modern Supreme Court has drawn.\n\nFaced with this reality, forfeiture’s critics argue that this early history has limited relevance because forfeiture was traditionally used for narrow purposes: to remediate harm, impose penalties on those outside the courts’ jurisdiction, and support revenue collection. Therefore, critics contend, there is no historical basis for denying constitutional protec­tions in connection with modern forfeitures that go beyond those limited objectives.\n\nThe difficulty with these arguments is that historical practice was not restricted in the ways modern critics suggest. To be sure, the early government used forfeiture for the “limited” purposes critics identify. But it also used forfeiture more broadly, raising doubts about whether the constraints for which modern critics advocate are historically justified.\n\n1. Remediating Harm. — Critics contend that early forfeiture had limited “remedial” purposes. One such alleged purpose was to replace the lost revenue that resulted from a customs evasion: Forfeiture of property involved in illegal importation could repair the harm to the public treasury that resulted from nonpayment of duties owed. A se­cond remedial purpose was to remove from circulation two categories of dangerous items: “instrumentalities” that facilitated the commission of the offense (and could do so again if left in the hands of customs evaders) and “contraband”—that is, inherently illegal or harmful prop­erty. According to the critics, while forfeiture in such contexts could be justified as a remedial measure aimed at protecting government revenue or preventing further lawbreaking, modern forfeitures that go beyond such limited purposes—such as those reaching property purchased with the proceeds of illegal activity—are “punitive” and should therefore be subject to constitutional limits (particularly under the Excessive Fines and Double Jeopardy Clauses).\n\nThe difficulty with this argument is that the government’s early for­feiture practices were not limited solely to “remedial” purposes. In both theory and practice, civil forfeiture did far more than replace lost reve­nue or remove dangerous items from circulation. By imposing severe financial penalties on the owners of forfeited property, it served as a means of punishing lawbreaking.\n\nConsider the value of most forfeitures as compared to the revenue lost from customs evasion. While the rates of customs duties on particular goods varied, from 1790 to 1807 the average annual tariff on dutiable goods was generally around twenty percent, and only exceeded twenty-five percent twice. As a result, forfeiture of goods subject to ad valorem duties—that is, duties imposed in relation to the value of the goods—was likely to be four or five times more valuable than the duty owed. Rather than simply replacing lost revenue, forfeiture multiplied it. And that is true even before considering forfeiture actions brought against illegally imported goods and the vessels that carried them. Be­cause ships were often worth thousands of dollars, the penalty imposed through forfeiture in such cases grew by orders of magnitude.\n\nThis is not merely a hypothetical problem. Research reveals that, in the early period, the government routinely used forfeiture to impose penalties that were wholly disproportional to the potential revenue loss stemming from a violation. For example, when Thomas Shaw brought two casks of rum on board his ship to sell to passengers en route from Londonderry to New York, he unwittingly ran afoul of a law prohibiting the importation of spirits in casks bearing American marks. In re­sponse, the government sought to forfeit both the rum (worth $405.75) and his ship (worth $12,000), a penalty more than 100 times greater than the duties owed. And this was not an outlier case; a number of statutes provided for forfeiture of both goods and vessels, and federal officers were not shy about using them.\n\nConversely, federal officers also showed little hesitation in pursuing relatively insignificant penalties, even when it made little economic sense. They regularly filed suit to forfeit low-value goods, though their eventual condemnation and sale resulted in little profit to the govern­ment or the interested officers. For example, in both New York and Pennsylvania, default judgments were common against goods that sold for under $50 (about $1,000 in present-day dollars). Once the court taxed costs for the marshal, clerk, and district attorney, the remainder to be shared between the government and customs officers was often negligible, sometimes less than $10 total.\n\nIn a number of cases, in fact, the sale proceeds did not cover the court costs, meaning that even the minimal effort required to obtain a default judgment was not a break-even proposition for the govern­ment. Nor was this approach limited to default judgments. At times (though not often), the government actually litigated cases even when they promised minimal returns at best. In other words, though forfei­ture could theoretically serve the remedial purpose of compensating the government for lost revenue, federal officers often used the power in situations where its primary impact was to impose a financial penalty on the violator.\n\nThere is an analogous difficulty with the other version of the “remedial” argument advanced by critics—that forfeiture was limited to “instrumentalities” of lawbreaking or “contraband.” By statute, the gov­ernment could do far more than simply seize inherently illegal goods and the ships that transported them (though it could do that too ). It could also seize perfectly legal goods that were brought into the country by illegal means—whether it was unloading them without permission from a customs officer, invoicing them at lower than actual value, or simply transporting them in the wrong kind of container. Moreover, the government did not hesitate to use this power; the federal court records are replete with cases involving the forfeiture of ordinary commercial goods that simply happened to be imported contrary to law. In early practice, the government used forfeiture for more than just “remediation.”\n\n2. Reaching Lawbreakers. — The second historical limitation advanced by modern critics fares no better: They contend that the breadth of the government’s early forfeiture power was merely an expedient, as it enabled the government to impose penalties on guilty parties that would otherwise be beyond its reach. This argument’s premise is the belief that many of the people involved in customs violations were located outside the United States, or could easily put themselves outside U.S. territory (on a ship, for instance), and were therefore often beyond the jurisdic­tion of American courts. If the property involved in customs violations was not subject to forfeiture, then federal officers would often have no recourse against lawbreaking merchants, ship owners, and mariners who could easily absent themselves from the United States. According to a number of critics, modern forfeiture should be similarly limited to cases in which it is difficult to penalize lawbreaking conduct through an in personam action against the wrongdoer.\n\nIn theory, this argument has some merit. One longstanding justifica­tion for the forfeiture power was the difficulty of being able to enforce the revenue laws against those over whom the American courts could not assert jurisdiction. And it is true that during the early period federal officers sought forfeiture against goods and vessels owned by foreigners, people against whom in personam penalties—that is, monetary fines—would likely have been difficult to secure. Nor was this simply a jurisdictional issue; in smuggling cases it was often difficult for federal officers to identify the lawbreakers in the first place, leaving forfeiture of the smuggled goods as the only means by which the officers could penalize violators.\n\nThe problem with this theory is that the early forfeiture power ex­tended well beyond cases in which it was practically or jurisdictionally difficult to impose a fine against the actual lawbreaker. As Caleb Nelson points out, forfeiture was used in contexts other than maritime regula­tion; it was used in a variety of domains under state law and was also used as a tool for enforcing federal excise taxes on distilled spirits. Even if it is unclear how widespread state practice was, and even if there was some debate in the nineteenth century about forfeiture’s constitutional­ity when applied outside the maritime context, these examples suggest that civil forfeiture’s legitimacy did not depend on it being used only to reach those who might otherwise evade punishment.\n\nThere is also a more powerful objection to the jurisdictional theory: The early federal government regularly instituted forfeiture suits in mari­time cases where personal penalties against the violators were almost certainly available. For example, in an early smuggling case from Massa­chusetts, the Boston collector of customs wrote to Alexander Hamilton detailing his continuing efforts to locate “a few bags of cotton” that had been illegally landed on an island off Cape Cod, despite having already instituted in personam actions seeking stiff fines against the captain and mate of the ship in which the cotton had been imported. Indeed, the court records reveal numerous forfeiture actions in instances where levying fines against natural persons presumably would have been feasible.\n\nThe government’s preference for forfeiture was not because fines were statutorily unavailable. Congress imposed monetary penalties for numerous violations related to the regulation of maritime commerce: failure to make timely entry at the customhouse, discrepancies be­tween the ship’s manifest and the actual goods landed, leaving port without permission, not painting the name and port on an American vessel, not reporting a change in command, or failing to return an expired registry —just to name a few. And the fines themselves could be significant, often $500 or more (roughly equivalent to $13,000 today ). In short, if there had been an early consensus that monetary fines were the preferred tool of federal law enforcement, the government had the means to act accordingly.\n\nThe government’s enthusiasm for in rem forfeiture of course makes perfect sense, but not in a way that gives comfort to modern critics. In many cases, a forfeiture produced more significant returns than a fine for both the government and the officers involved, particularly if the offense allowed for seizure of a vessel in addition to goods. And given the many advantages of in rem process—including a lower burden of proof and trial before a judge rather than a jury —it was certainly easier to secure a forfeiture than a fine. In fact, in the smuggling episode in which Hamilton endorsed customs officers’ efforts to seek both forfei­ture of a few bags of cotton and fines against the smugglers personally, the government failed to secure the latter, apparently because the jurors thought “the penalty . . . was too high.” The government’s routine use of in rem forfeiture, in addition to or in lieu of in personam fines, casts serious doubt on the proposition that early forfeiture was purely a tool for reaching wrongdoers who lay beyond the courts’ jurisdiction.\n\n3. Protecting the Fisc. — Finally, some critics have suggested that because early forfeiture was oriented toward ensuring that the gov­ernment was able to enforce customs collection, modern forfeiture that serves purposes unrelated to revenue should be subject to stricter constitutional scrutiny. This, too, fails as a limiting principle.\n\nEven if most early forfeiture actions were in response to customs violations, not all were; for example, there were suits for involvement in arms dealing, the slave trade, and violations of U.S neutrality. Although such prosecutions were relatively rare, the fact that they took place at all casts significant doubt on the proposition that forfeiture was constitution­ally legitimate only in relation to revenue collection. And immediately after the period studied here the government made significant use of forfeiture to enforce regulations on maritime commerce that were largely unrelated to revenue collection—namely, for violations of the Jeffersonian Embargo from 1808 to 1811, and for trading with the en­emy in the War of 1812. As a result, the suggestion that forfeiture should be subject to stricter constitutional limitations when used outside the revenue context seems to project backward a constraint that was not apparent at the Founding.\n\nThere is a better explanation for early forfeiture’s narrow orienta­tion than the (unspoken) existence of a special constitutional carve out for powers protective of the public fisc: The federal government used forfeiture primarily in support of revenue collection and maritime regulation because those are the things the early government did. Though recent historical scholarship has demonstrated that the federal government had a greater presence in early American life (especially economic life) than has traditionally been understood, its chief func­tions (at least prior to the War of 1812) were collecting taxes and regulating maritime commerce. In other words, the limiting principle of “revenue collection” that critics identify was not particular to forfeiture; it was inherent in the nature of early federal authority itself. Accordingly, if history is to offer a basis for constraining modern forfeiture’s scope, it is not because it was used for limited purposes in the Founding Era.\n\nIII. Forgoing Forfeiture\n\nAs it turns out, forfeiture at the Founding was meaningfully circum­scribed, but in ways that courts and commentators have failed to recognize. While the federal government’s early law enforcement prac­tices indicate an expansive conception of the forfeiture power, the government’s exercise of its remission authority tells a very different story—one in which the solution to the problem of forfeiture’s potentially “ruinous” effects was robust discretion to return forfeitable property, lodged centrally in the executive branch.\n\nShortly after Congress established the statutory regime governing forfeiture, it recognized the need for a means by which the government could mitigate forfeiture’s harshest effects. As section III.A explains, there was universal agreement on this point. At Hamilton’s urging, Congress gave the Treasury Secretary authority to return property seized for unintentional violations of the law. Moreover, as section III.B shows, in exercising their remission authority the early Treasury Secretaries demonstrated a profound commitment to granting as much relief as was permissible under the statutory scheme Congress established. They granted relief in the overwhelming majority of cases presented to them and accepted almost any plausible explanation for why the underlying violation was unintentional, even when harboring significant doubts about the petitioner’s claims. As section III.C reveals, in exercising remission so expansively, the Secretaries did not simply sand down forfeiture’s roughest edges. Rather, they transformed forfeiture entirely, turning the harsh strict liability regime outlined by statute—and relied on by the Supreme Court in its modern forfeiture cases—into a moder­ate exercise of state power.\n\nA. Establishing Remission\n\nThe necessity of tempering forfeiture’s consequences was apparent as soon as the First Congress created the customs regime that under­girded the new nation’s finances. Only a few months after the 1789 Collection Act went into effect, Hamilton explained the problem to Congress: The government’s extensive authority to seize private property raised the prospect of “heavy and ruinous forfeitures” being imposed for infractions resulting from “inadvertence and want of information,” rather than any intent to defraud the revenue. To avoid injustice, Hamilton argued that a “discretionary power of granting relief” was “indispensable.” He urged Congress to follow “the usual policy of Commercial Nations” and vest such power “somewhere.”\n\nHamilton’s basic premise attracted broad agreement in Congress. As leading Federalist Fisher Ames argued, it was “necessary” to provide some mode of redress for forfeitures that “bear hard upon individuals.” His colleagues concurred: It was a universal principle that “no person ought to be liable who is not guilty of a violation of the laws intentionally or willfully.” Yet under the existing statutory regime, those who violated the revenue laws, “whether intentionally or through igno­rance,” were “precluded from all relief.” Given the “duty of [customs] officers to prosecute in all cases,” a power to return seized property to those who committed minor or unintentional infractions was “necessary” to avoid injustice. Indeed, it would be “impossible to get along” without it.\n\nMembers of Congress recognized that creating such power was risky. It was a truism that “safe and effectual” revenue collection required that the penalties set out for violations be made “nearly inevitable.” Accord­ingly, some members worried that creating a “discretionary power” to remit fines and forfeitures had the potential to seriously impair the public fisc. Too generous an application of the remission power risked encouraging “careless and incautious violations of the law.” Such a “delicate power” therefore needed to be “managed with a great deal of circumspection.” The goal, Ames explained, was to allow for relief in certain deserving cases while creating “the least risk of injuring the revenue.”\n\nThe solution Congress arrived at was to put the remission power in the Treasury Secretary’s hands. Under the 1790 Remission Act, any party interested in a seizure made under the laws regulating customs collection and the coasting trade could petition the Secretary to have the forfeiture remitted. The petitioner first submitted the petition to the district court, which heard evidence and transmitted a judicial statement of facts to the Treasury Secretary. If the Secretary determined that the viola­tion was not the result of “wilful negligence or any intention of fraud,” he could remit the penalty in whole or in part, “upon such terms or conditions as he may deem reasonable and just.” This included the shares due to customs officers or informants—a provision members of Congress thought essential to ensuring that the remission scheme be able to provide complete relief. The Secretary’s decision was effectively final, as the statute did not provide for any administrative or judicial review.\n\nThrough the remission procedure, Congress essentially created an alternative mechanism for contesting government seizures. Though technically remission was only available for a penalty that had been “incurred,” nothing in the statute required a claimant to wait until judg­ment in court against them to file a petition. And in practice, petitions seeking to undo a judgment post hoc were rare. Instead, in most cases a claimant filed a petition immediately after the government filed suit; the court proceedings were stayed pending Treasury’s disposition of the peti­tion (though generally without entry of a formal stay).\n\nProcedurally, remission also had many of the trappings of litigation in court. Before the judge could inquire into the facts of the case, the district attorney and the collector—the government officials responsible for pursuing forfeitures—each had to have notice of the petition and “an opportunity of showing cause against the mitigation or remission.” In preparing the statement of facts, the district judge heard witnesses and considered written testimony and documentary evidence. The judge’s responsibility was not simply ministerial; in determining the “facts” of the incident, he had to make the same kind of credibility determinations he would in trying a case. This was especially true because the petitioner’s eligibility for remission turned entirely on their state of mind—that is, whether the Treasury Secretary believed that the petitioner violated the relevant statutory provision unintentionally.\n\nYet if the remission procedure functioned as a parallel adjudicative procedure for contesting forfeitures, it differed from litigation in a crucial respect: The Treasury Secretary had far greater latitude than district judges in deciding whether a forfeiture was warranted and, if so, how severe the penalty should be. This is for two reasons. First, while violations of the statutory regulations the courts administered were almost entirely strict liability offenses, the Treasury Secretary had author­ity to remit penalties whenever he was persuaded that no fraud had been intended. As a result, judicial rulings in litigated cases paid no heed to questions of mens rea, while remission outcomes largely depended on the Secretary’s judgment about the offender’s state of mind. Second, the statutory regulations prescribed specific penalties for each offense, offering judges no latitude as to the degree of penalty to be imposed. The Secretary, on the other hand, had broad authority to remit as much or as little of a penalty as he deemed appropriate. In other words, the remission power introduced significant discretion into a law enforcement regime that otherwise allowed for none.\n\nB. Excusing Violations\n\nAs a formal matter, remission merely gave the Treasury Secretary the power to mitigate forfeiture’s potentially harsh effects but no obligation to do so. In practice, however, the three Secretaries who held office during the period studied here were exceedingly liberal in their use of the remission power, granting relief in the overwhelming majority of cases presented to them. The result of this generosity was nothing less than a fundamental reconfiguration of the forfeiture power itself.\n\nThe numbers are stark: From 1790 to 1807, the government insti­tuted a total of 578 forfeiture actions in the New York and Pennsylvania district courts. As a procedural matter, exactly half the suits were resolved in court, and half were resolved by the Treasury Secretary under his remission authority.\n\nThe difference in outcomes between the two modes of disposition is striking. In cases adjudicated in court—that is, cases in which no remission petition was filed—the government prevailed eighty-nine percent of the time, thanks to the huge number of default judgments (accounting for more than three-quarters of all cases adjudicated in court). The opposite is true in cases resolved via remission; the Secretar­ies granted ninety-one percent of remission petitions, with seventy-one percent of those grants being full remissions in which the petitioner only had to pay court costs. And most partial remissions required the peti­tioner to pay a relatively small sum to recover his property. In the vast majority of cases, therefore, judicial decisions respecting forfeiture favored the government, whereas submission of a remission petition provided property owners nearly full relief from forfeiture.\n\nLooking behind the numbers, closer examination of the petitions themselves reveals just how lenient the remission regime was. The Secretaries accepted a broad range of excuses as justification for lawbreaking conduct. For example, petitioners did not need to assert that extraordinary circumstances prevented them from following the law. Instead, an asserted difficulty with—or just the inconvenience of—complying with customs regulations consistently offered a path to forgiveness. The Secretaries remitted forfeitures incurred due to ship captains’ hurry to get a cargo to port, changes in foreign markets, and trading restrictions imposed by other nations. Even a petitioner’s admitted carelessness in following the law was not fatal, despite the fact that the Remission Act expressly disallowed relief in cases of “wilful negligence.”\n\nIn addition, plausibility was not a high bar. The Secretaries remitted for­feitures despite misgivings about the veracity of petitioners’ assertions, a lack of evidence supporting them, indications of other questionable conduct, and “circumstances of suspicion.” Nor did the Secretaries require much persuading; in Hamilton’s view, if there simply “appear[ed] to be reasonable ground for a presumption” that the violation was unintentional, forbearance was called for. It was not even always necessary for the petitioner to justify his error—the mere assertion that it was unintentional could trigger a remission.\n\nThe Secretaries also went to great lengths to ensure that claimants were able to make their cases. As a statutory matter, petitioners were responsible for establishing that a violation was unintentional, which included presenting evidence to the district court. In practice, how­ever, the Secretaries investigated cases themselves, asking federal officers on the ground for additional information, so as to fully consider the merits of the petitioners’ claims. And the Secretaries did so knowing full well the extra burden these requests imposed on federal officials.\n\nFor Hamilton, this willingness to bend over backward in favor of petitioners was motivated by an appreciation of forfeiture’s potentially severe consequences. As he explained to the federal officers charged with enforcing the customs regime, Hamilton was “unwilling . . . to precipitate a forfeiture as long as there is a chance of new light to evince innocence.” This was true even in “extremely questionable” cases. In fact, Hamilton regularly expressed his doubts about “the innocence of the transaction[s]” he was presented with, but he declined to reject un­persuasive petitions outright. Instead, he repeatedly gave petitioners further opportunity to “explain[] and put[] matters in a more satisfac­tory light, if they can.”\n\nC. Transforming Forfeiture\n\nThe generous approach Hamilton and his successors adopted did more than provide meaningful relief to a substantial number of claimants. In granting relief to petitioners with any plausible claim to an unintentional violation of the law, and by calibrating penalties in accordance with the claimants’ level of culpability, the Secretaries substantially reshaped core principles of the forfeiture regime Congress established. The picture of early forfeiture that emerges from the remission records is therefore quite different from the image one finds in modern Supreme Court decisions.\n\n1. Incorporating Intent. — The first transformation wrought by the Secretaries’ remission practices lay in shifting what was formally a strict liability regime into a system that effectively required lawbreaking intent to permit a forfeiture. As discussed above, only a small handful of the numerous offenses set forth in the 1789 Collection Act turned on the offender’s state of mind; for the vast majority, whether the violator acted intentionally, negligently, or innocently was irrelevant to liability. The Remission Act gave the Treasury Secretary the power to remit penalties incurred without “wilful negligence or any intention of fraud,” but it did not require that he do so. The legislative scheme thus established strict liability as the baseline, with a discretionary power vested in the Secretary to grant relief to occasional deserving petitioners.\n\nIn practice, however, the Secretaries always granted remission in response to a plausible claim of lack of fraudulent intent. Petitioners who could credibly pin the blame on others—whether they were ship cap­tains, crew members, business partners, prior owners, or even customs officers —were successful in securing relief. In contrast, the rare cases in which the Secretaries denied remission usually involved facts suggesting complicity or at least a failure to properly supervise on the owner’s part.\n\nThe most common basis for remission was simple ignorance of the law. Whether because the petitioner had been misinformed by others, had left the country for a while, or had been simply “poor and . . . ignorant,” time and again the Secretaries granted forbearance solely in response to a claim of a lack of legal knowledge. In fact, ignorance of the law was not only a potential excuse—it was always an excuse. The records reveal not a single instance of the Treasury denying remission because the Secretary deemed a mistake of law defense to be insufficient. What is more, the Secretaries regularly granted remission in response to dubious claims of ignorance—for example, when the statutory provision in question had long been in effect, or the petitioner was someone who could well be expected to know the law governing their business. In short, a mistake of law did not have to be reasonable; it just had to be believable.\n\nIt is worth pausing to consider the significance of the Secretaries’ treatment of ignorance of the law as a complete defense to forfeiture. At the time, the principle that ignorance of the law was not an excuse for lawbreaking was firmly established, and had been for centuries. Though contemporaries recognized that the doctrine risked subjecting persons innocent of real wrongdoing to harsh penalties, the severity was a necessary evil. Otherwise, it would be too easy to evade the law, either by pretending to be unaware of it, or by neglecting to learn it; those who knowingly ran afoul of the law could simply assert that they were unaware of its requirements. Indeed, permitting mistake of law as a defense re­moved any incentive that merchants had to learn the new regulations Congress had enacted and to abide by them.\n\nThis was not an abstract concern. As discussed earlier, there was deep anxiety in Congress that the remission power risked undermining enforcement of the revenue laws. And while Hamilton thought forfei­tures incurred because of “misconstruction” or “want of information” were candidates for relief, he also believed—at least at first—that remission was only a temporary expedient, to “allow sufficient time for persons to become acquainted with the law.” Yet contrary to Hamilton’s initial assumption, in practice the Secretaries (him included) not only treated every colorable claim of ignorance as a basis for remission, they repeatedly did so in circumstances suggesting that they could have taken a dimmer view of the petitioners’ claim for relief. And they continued to do so long after the rules Congress created for revenue collection had been firmly established.\n\nThe Secretaries’ fulsome exercise of the remission power worked a profound change in the legal regime governing forfeiture. As a formal matter, the statutory scheme regulating maritime commerce largely ignored questions of intent in prescribing penalties for violations. But under the Secretaries’ approach, a claimed lack of fraudulent intent was a complete defense to forfeiture, effectively rendering such intent an element of every customs offense.\n\n2. Tailoring Penalties. — The second transformation resulting from the Secretaries’ remission practices was their introduction of strong proportionality considerations into the forfeiture regime. Here the change was more subtle, but important nonetheless.\n\nAs a formal matter, the statutory scheme evinced concern for maintaining proportionality between offenses and forfeitures, but only roughly so. Some violations triggered fines (of varying amounts), some resulted in forfeitures, and some both. But as to forfeitures, the stat­utes rarely provided any gradation—the penalty was the value of the goods, irrespective of whether that amount was low or high. To be sure, forfeitures in response to violations that threatened to deprive the government of customs duties on imports were often proportional in a general sense: Because the duties owed for many types of goods were calculated as a percentage of their value, forfeiture of the goods in full bore a direct relationship to the harm to the public fisc that arose from nonpayment. But in many instances, forfeiture could result in widely disparate penalties imposed for identical offenses.\n\nIn exercising their remission authority, the Secretaries evinced a deeper concern for meting out penalties commensurate to the level of misconduct than did the statutes. First, every statement of facts produced by a district court judge noted the value of the articles subject to forfeiture. This information was irrelevant to the question of eligibility for remission—by statute, a forfeiture could be remitted as long as it was incurred “without wilful negligence or any intention of fraud.” But evidence about the value of the forfeiture was necessary to enable the Secretaries to exercise their statutory authority to tailor relief “upon such terms or conditions as he may deem reasonable and just.” The fact that every petition included information about forfeiture value suggests that the Secretaries understood themselves to have not only the power to tailor remission but also an obligation to ensure congruence between the level of misconduct and the severity of the penalty.\n\nMore evidence of the Secretaries’ concern for proportionality lies in the decisions themselves. As noted earlier, a percentage of remissions granted significant but not complete relief. Partial remissions were generally granted in cases involving some degree of responsibility for the violation on the petitioner’s part but no actual fraud. Negligence was the most common reason for not granting full remission; the Secretaries imposed small penalties on petitioners who offered no good excuse for their claimed ignorance of the law, as well as those who were simply careless or forgetful. At times the Secretaries also imposed penalties on petitioners who failed to properly supervise others. In most such cases the penalty was relatively minor—twenty or fifty dollars—represent­ing a small fraction of the potential forfeiture’s total value. And even larger penalties generally paled in comparison to what the petitioner stood to lose by forfeiture. In short, when the offense was minor, so was the penalty the Secretaries imposed.\n\nThe Secretaries were explicit about their belief in the importance of carefully tailoring the penalties they imposed. As Hamilton explained to Congress, penalties causing “material suffering or loss” should be limited to cases involving a significant “degree of negligence.” Albert Gallatin echoed this view two decades later; in cases where he thought it “improper” to grant complete remission, his practice was to “graduat[e] the amount of penalty” according to the nature of the case. In deter­mining what penalty was appropriate, he took account of the “degree of negligence manifested by the party” as well as “the importance, for the safety of the revenue, of the particular provision which had been infringed.”\n\nThis is the proportionality principle in action. Petitioners who had admittedly broken the law, but who made a plausible case that they did so without fraudulent intent, were not subject to forfeiture’s harshest consequences. At the same time, those who bore some responsibility for the violation were not excused entirely; negligent merchants paid a price for their dereliction of responsibility, albeit a small one. Hamilton agreed with this too: When compliance with the law “was practicable,” it was appropriate that the violator suffer “[s]ome degree of inconvenience.” By carefully aligning the penalties imposed on property owners with their degree of culpability, the Treasury Secretaries sought to ensure that the government used its statutorily broad power to forfeit property as moderately as possible. Rather than the unconstrained power the Supreme Court has imagined, forfeiture at the Founding was kept within limits.\n\nIV. Forfeiture and the Constitution\n\nIn light of the Supreme Court’s reliance on history to justify its denial of constitutional protections against civil forfeiture, this Part considers what the Founding Era practice revealed in Part III might tell us about constitutional limits on civil forfeiture today. As section IV.A explains, the government’s generous exercise of the remission power raises significant doubts about two key propositions underlying the Supreme Court’s modern jurisprudence: that “innocence” was tradition­ally irrelevant to civil forfeiture’s propriety, and that civil forfeiture was not considered a “punishment” to be constrained by the proportionality principles that apply to other government-imposed penalties. At mini­mum, this Article’s contrary findings offer good reason for the Court to reconsider the historical underpinnings of its doctrinal conclusions in these two critical domains.\n\nThe history discussed here may also do more than simply challenge a faulty judicial narrative about forfeiture’s past. It offers historical evidence—though admittedly speculative—to support the imposition of stronger constitutional constraints on forfeiture’s exercise today. In particular, section IV.B assesses evidence that early remission was shaped by a Founding Era understanding that robust protections for forfeiture’s victims were a necessary—and possibly constitutional—corollary to the government’s exercise of its power. Yet as section IV.C explains, it is uncertain whether the revised understanding of forfeiture’s history advanced here necessitates the recognition of judicially enforceable limits on that power today.\n\nA. Forfeiture’s History\n\nThe federal government’s early remission practices raise deep doubts about the historical beliefs that underlie two key areas of the Supreme Court’s forfeiture jurisprudence. Recall that the Court’s rejec­tion of an “innocent owner” defense to forfeiture under the Due Process Clause rests on a belief that considerations of innocence have never been relevant to forfeiture’s propriety. Similarly, the Court seems to have concluded—though not clearly—that civil forfeiture was traditionally not understood to be “punishment,” and therefore not subject to the proportionality requirement embedded in the Excessive Fines Clause.\n\nAs detailed below, those conclusions are dubious. Solicitude for innocent owners and proportionality in punishment were both core concerns of the early forfeiture regime, a finding that has implications for the Court’s jurisprudence going forward. At minimum, the revelation that the government’s early use of civil forfeiture was subject to signifi­cant constraints offers reason for the Supreme Court to revisit its contrary historical understanding and the doctrinal conclusions that flow from it.\n\n1. Innocence. — First, consider innocence. The Court has consistently held that a property owner’s lack of involvement in a legal violation has no bearing on the propriety of civil forfeiture under the Due Process Clause. This is true even though the Court recognizes that it is potentially “unfair” to penalize innocent owners for the acts of others. The reason that such manifest unfairness does not require constitutional protections for innocent owners is history. Citing the “historical back­ground of forfeiture statutes in this country”—including the customs regulations discussed in section II.A—and prior decisions “sustaining their constitutionality,” the Court has concluded that the Due Process Clause offers no protection to innocent owners.\n\nThe Court’s understanding of forfeiture’s history is incomplete at best. Contrary to the conclusion the Court has drawn from a handful of its prior opinions, concerns over the injustice of forfeiting the property of innocent owners have deep historical roots. As Part III demonstrates, the principle that morally nonculpable property owners should be shielded from forfeiture’s harsh effects was an essential element of the federal government’s practice from its very beginnings.\n\nIndeed, the Treasury Secretaries’ early remission activities point to a conception of “innocence” far more capacious and forgiving than even the modest version rejected by the Supreme Court. Take historical claims to “innocence” that mirror modern conceptions—that is, when the claimant asserts that they had no direct involvement in, or even know­ledge of, the offense underlying a forfeiture. Supreme Court doctrine adopts a hard-line approach; for example, the Court has rejected the “innocent owner” arguments of a woman who jointly owned a car used by her husband when soliciting a prostitute and a boat-leasing com­pany whose yacht was used to transport a small amount of marijuana, though in neither case was there any suggestion that the owners had any knowledge of the crime, let alone involvement in it. By contrast, early property owners who asserted such defenses were broadly successful in securing remission. In fact, they prevailed in circumstances far less sug­gestive of “innocence” than those present in recent Court decisions.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the early conception of “innocence” evident in the Secretaries’ remission practices extended beyond those who could plausibly argue a lack of involvement in wrongdoing. The Secretaries did not grant relief only to persons who were personally innocent of wrongdoing; they also remitted forfeitures incurred by persons whom we might consider to be morally innocent—that is, those whose violations were the result of extenuating circumstances, or (more commonly) who were simply ignorant of the law. In other words, in the early period a successful claim of “innocence” did not necessitate establishing lack of actual involvement or knowledge; all that was required was to plausibly assert absence of intent to break the law (and sometimes barely so).\n\nThe capaciousness of this early conception of “innocence” is most evident in Alexander Hamilton’s evolving views of remission’s relation­ship to claims of ignorance of the law. As noted earlier, Hamilton initially believed that a federal remission power would only be necessary to “allow sufficient time for persons to become acquainted with the law.” But that is not what happened. Not only did remission soon become a permanent feature of the regulatory regime governing maritime com­merce, but in practice Hamilton and his successors forgave forfeitures in response to claims of legal ignorance long after the requirements and prohibitions of that regime had been clearly established.\n\nIn short, if Hamilton originally understood remission to be a necessary expedient in managing the transition to a new regulatory regime, over time he and his successors used it in a way that indicates a deeper principle at work: Even if many violators could reasonably be expected to know that they were violating the law, imposing forfeiture was only appropriate in cases involving specific lawbreaking intent. Rather than severing forfeiture’s legitimacy from questions of moral culpability, as modern doctrine does, in the early period the Secretaries were guided by a conception of “innocence” that viewed forfeiture as necessarily limited by such considerations.\n\nThis Article’s revelation that innocence was in fact a paramount concern in the early forfeiture regime should encourage the Court to reconsider its rejection of an innocent-owner defense under the Due Process Clause. Contrary to the Court’s understanding, from the first days the federal government used civil forfeiture as a tool of law enforcement, claimants were able to recover property seized by the government whenever they could plausibly assert that they lacked law­breaking intent. Shorn of its historical rationale, the Court’s refusal to consider claims to innocence must be justified on other grounds. Perhaps it can be—such questions are beyond the scope of this Article. But, at minimum, these are questions the Court should be asking itself.\n\n2. Proportionality and Punishment. — Second, consider proportionality and punishment. As explained above, history has also shaped Supreme Court doctrine regarding the Eighth Amendment’s applicability to civil forfeiture. Under the Court’s approach, the key question in assessing whether a particular penalty is a “fine” for purposes of the Excessive Fines Clause—and is therefore subject to the Clause’s “gross proportion­ality” requirement—is whether that penalty constitutes “punishment.” In answering that question, the Court has again looked to history. While in Austin the Court suggested that, historically, civil forfeiture has been considered punishment, in Bajakajian the Court cast doubt on that proposition, asserting that because “[t]raditional in rem forfeitures” were historically not considered punishment, they “occupy a place outside the domain of the Excessive Fines Clause.” The Court echoed that view in holding that civil forfeiture is not “punishment” for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, on the strength of early practice and “a long line of cases” so holding.\n\nHere again, the Court’s historical conclusions are doubtful. To be sure, early forfeiture served, in part, what we might understand to be “nonpunitive” purposes. Statutory provisions providing for the seizure of vessels and their equipment not only penalized individuals for their misconduct; they also served the “remedial” purpose of removing from circulation the “instrumentalities” of lawbreaking conduct—such as ships used in the slave trade—and thereby potentially reducing the incidence of future violations. The sums raised from forfeitures also served as compensation for customs officers and court personnel, and—theoreti­cally—replaced revenue lost to customs evasion.\n\nIn the main, however, early forfeiture was a punishment for wrongdoing, a means of deterring such conduct in the future—something contemporaries acknowledged. The government routinely pursued forfeitures that served no apparent purpose other than penaliz­ing people who violated the law. And the longstanding justification for in rem forfeiture—that it allows a sovereign to reach wrongdoers who are otherwise beyond its jurisdiction—makes no sense unless the forfeiture punishes lawbreaking conduct. In addition, despite the fiction of the “guilty property,” members of the Founding generation fully understood that an in rem forfeiture imposed punishment on individuals, not on the property itself. Indeed, the entire point of creating the remission power was to provide relief from forfeitures that “might bear hard upon individuals.”\n\nThe historical evidence also demonstrates an early concern over the Eighth Amendment’s central principle: proportionality in punishment. As discussed earlier, remission provided relief to those who were subject to penalties that were disproportional to their degree of moral culpability for the offense. And by granting almost all of the remission petitions presented to them, the Treasury Secretaries made clear that forfeiture of valuable property was an inappropriate punishment for unintentional violations of the law. So much so, in fact, that it was better to err in favor of generosity in dubious cases. Rather than sanctioning outsized forfeitures irrespective of the offense, the government’s early practice ensured that the punishments imposed via forfeiture fit the crime.\n\nTo the extent the Court has concluded that civil forfeitures were historically not considered to be punishment and therefore are not restrained by the Clause’s proportionality principles, that conclusion seems wrong. At the Founding, civil forfeiture was clearly understood to serve in significant part as a punishment for lawbreaking and was also constrained by a deep concern for ensuring that such punishments were commensurate with the offender’s culpability. To be sure, confirming the Clause’s applicability to civil forfeiture might not precipitate significant changes in the government’s forfeiture practice. But at the very least, the evidence discussed here gives the Court good reason to reject assertions—like those made by the State of Indiana this past term in Timbs —that there is no historical basis for subjecting civil forfeiture to the Clause’s proportionality requirement.\n\nB. Forfeiture’s Constitutionality\n\nForfeiture’s early history might do more than simply encourage the Supreme Court to reconsider its historical justifications for denying constitutional protections to those subject to government seizures. The limited use of forfeiture at the Founding might also serve as the basis for an affirmative argument in favor of stronger constitutional protections in the present day. As discussed below, there is reason to attribute the early restrained approach to a Founding Era understanding that the Constitution did in fact apply to civil forfeiture.\n\nBefore unpacking the evidence of remission’s constitutional under­pinnings, it is worth noting that precisely how this history might factor into a new constitutional jurisprudence of civil forfeiture depends on one’s views about the role of history in constitutional interpretation and adjudication. While even a partial overview of the possibilities is beyond the scope of this Article, we can stipulate that historical evidence shedding light on Founding Era constitutional understandings is poten­tially relevant to almost any constitutional interpreter. And we can further stipulate that evidence from the period immediately following Ratification is of high salience. This is true even for proponents of “original public meaning” originalism, who accept that immediate post-Ratification evidence is highly probative of what contemporaries under­stood the Constitution to mean in 1788. Post-Ratification evidence is also important when the original meaning of constitutional language is indeterminate; such evidence can aid in the process of “constructing” constitutional meaning when textual interpretation fails to provide an answer, or in discerning the meaning of constitutional text that is originally susceptible to contested interpretations but, over time, becomes settled or “liquidated.” Given the acknowledged indetermi­nacy of phrases like “due process” and “excessive fines,” evidence regarding the federal government’s post-Ratification practices may have significant value for determining the constitutional meaning of such terms as they relate to civil forfeiture.\n\nThere is a problem, of course: The Constitution itself does not visibly appear in the forfeiture and remission story told here. Research in both published and unpublished cases during this period reveals no instance of a party arguing in court that the Constitution limited the government’s exercise of the forfeiture power. And the constitutional silence extended beyond the courts. With one important exception discussed below, I have found no indication that anyone in Congress or the executive branch contended that the Constitution itself circum­scribed the forfeiture power. One might reasonably object to ascribing constitutional significance to historical practices that were not obviously constitutionally motivated.\n\nThat said, there is good reason to think that the Treasury Secretaries’ generous remission practices were motivated by widespread Founding Era agreement that it was fundamentally unjust to seize private property in response to unintentional violations of the law. As a result, remission in such circumstances was not discretionary; it was required—possibly by the Constitution itself.\n\nEvidence of remission’s obligatory nature can be seen from its earliest days. As discussed above, the remission power came into being because Hamilton and Congress agreed that the threat of “heavy and ruinous forfeitures” under the revenue laws rendered it a “necessity” that the government create—and continuously exercise—“some power capa­ble of affording relief.” Indeed, as a House committee explained in 1798, as a general matter Congress was “extremely loath to afford relief in cases of non-compliance with the . . . revenue [laws].” But it was “essential to justice” that petitions seeking remission for unintentional violations “be favorably heard.”\n\nMoreover, the way in which the early Treasury Secretaries used the power Congress created indicates that what the Founding generation deemed to be “necessary” was not simply the existence of remission but its maximal exercise. Most obviously, the fact that the Secretaries granted complete or near-complete relief in the overwhelming majority of cases presented to them suggests that they considered it their duty to grant remission whenever a claim plausibly alleged a lack of fraudulent intent. The Secretaries’ willingness to grant remission even in cases with dubious claims of innocence only strengthens the inference that they understood themselves to be compelled to grant relief as broadly as their statutory authority would allow. Gallatin said as much in an 1813 report to Congress describing how he exercised the remission power: He did not “consider himself authorized” to deny remission (at least in part) if he believed there was no fraudulent intent. In other words, despite the lack of mandatory language in the remission statute itself—which simply gave the Treasury Secretary the “power” to remit forfeitures —Gallatin was of the view that remission was obligatory in cases of violations committed without fraudulent intent.\n\nSimilar markers of remission’s “necessity” can be seen in the ways that the Secretaries interpreted particular statutory provisions. For example, Hamilton routinely granted relief from forfeitures related to the domestic production of spirits, despite the fact that, by statute, remission was available only for forfeitures under the laws “for collecting duties of impost and tonnage, and for regulating the coasting trade”—that is, not for laws related to making spirits. And Hamilton stuck to his expansive—and atextual—interpretation of the remission power despite the fact that two federal judges expressed serious doubts about his statu­tory authority to exercise it in that way. Along similar lines, Gallatin conceded that, in “common parlance,” the term “wilful negligence” in the Remission Act could readily be understood to mean any negligent act, “however unimportant.” But under such an interpretation, remission would be unavailable for most violations. So Gallatin instead read “wilful negligence” narrowly, to mean the same thing as “intention of fraud,” even though such a reading effectively rendered redundant those two phrases in the statutory text (and also reduced the benefits forfeiture provided to the government fisc, as Gallatin forthrightly admitted).\n\nNotably, the Treasury Secretaries’ willingness to push their statutory authority to its outer limits (and arguably beyond) provoked no apparent opposition in Congress. To the contrary: According to a House commit­tee established in 1813 to investigate the Treasury Secretaries’ remission practices, the Secretaries—far from contravening legislative intent—exercised their authority “in a manner liberal and just.” Accordingly, Congress repeatedly reauthorized the remission statute in the 1790s, expanded the Secretaries’ power in 1797, and made remission a perma­nent feature of the customs collections regime in 1800. And Congress included parallel remission provisions in numerous specific statutes in future years.\n\nOf course, the existence of a legislative and executive consensus regarding the “necessity” of remitting forfeitures incurred uninten­tionally does not mean that contemporaries understood the compulsion to be constitutional. They might have believed that generous remission was simply good policy. As noted earlier, the federal government was deeply dependent on customs revenue. And while many, like Hamilton, believed that “the security of the revenue” depended on rigorous enforcement of the customs laws, they also recognized that “heavy and ruinous” forfeitures of goods and vessels could harm merchants and slow the flow of customs revenues into federal coffers. As the afore­mentioned House committee put it in 1798, granting remission for unintentional violations of the law was “essential” both to “justice” and to “the interest of commerce.”\n\nIt is not clear, however, that the Secretaries’ generous remission practice was good policy. In the short term, the government had strong incentive to keep much of what it seized. Though receipts from forfeiture were never a major source of early government revenue, in the period discussed here they were so low that they did not even cover the expenses the government incurred for pursuing forfeitures in court (let alone the cost of detecting and interdicting violations), obliging Treasury to repeatedly request special appropriations to cover the deficit. At minimum, a less generous remission policy might have allowed forfeiture to pay for itself.\n\nRemission also had a negative impact on customs officers’ wallets. Recall that the customs statutes “encourage[d] vigilance” among officers by granting them a significant share of every forfeiture. But the Secretaries’ remission practices substantially reduced customs officers’ in­come, even as collectors besieged Treasury with complaints about the inadequacy of their pay. A less generous remission policy could have helped remedy this problem, too, as the shares officers stood to gain from a single high-value forfeiture were often equal to their entire annual compensation.\n\nIt is also questionable whether the Secretaries’ generous approach to remission was good policy at a broader level. As already mentioned, one key article of faith among government officials was that customs collec­tion depended on consistent application of the penalties prescribed for evad­ing it. Members of Congress repeatedly made this point in establishing the remission power, which was meant to provide an avenue for relief for those who suffered undeservedly from a necessarily inflexible enforcement of the revenue laws. Executive branch officials and judges agreed; as Hamilton’s immediate successor Oliver Wolcott put it, customs officers were to “execute the Law, without reference to any circumstances of fraud or innocence, . . . because nothing but the strict­est method can prevent the Revenue system, from being deranged.”\n\nMost notably, front-line officers also worried that relaxed enforcement sent the wrong message to merchants. According to some officers, it was “of great Consequence that every breach of the Revenue Laws should be prosecuted.” If the government failed to pursue violations incurred due to alleged ignorance, “others might expect to avoid the law by making a like plea.” Overgenerous remission created precisely these problems. According to one federal district attorney, Hamilton’s habit of remitting virtually every forfeiture meant that those who “trespass[ed] upon the regulations of Congress” feared little from forfeiture proceedings in court. Instead, government lawsuits were “a mere Subject of ridicule.” In short, even if generous remission brought the government potential benefits, it also risked imposing substantial costs.\n\nIf the Treasury Secretaries’ forgiving attitude toward forfeiture was not compelled by statutory text or policy considerations, what drove them to grant remission so freely? One possible answer is the Constitution. In 1792, Hamilton reported to Congress on objections that had been raised against a 1791 act imposing a tax on distilled spirits—the much-maligned “Whiskey Tax.” One of the complaints, according to Hamilton, was that the penalties in the act—which included the kinds of fines and forfeitures found in customs regulations—were “unusual or excessive.” Hamilton rejected the objection. Such penalties could not be considered “either unusual or excessive,” as they were similar to “those which are common in revenue laws.”\n\nThough Hamilton did not expressly mention the Constitution or the Eighth Amendment, it seems unlikely that his word choice was accidental. After all, “excessive” and “unusual” are two of the three adjectives the Amendment uses to describe impermissible penalties. This suggests that the Eighth Amendment’s limitations on government power—and those in the Excessive Fines Clause in particular—were potentially applicable to civil forfeitures. At minimum, some members of the public apparently believed this to be the case, and Hamilton thought the argument sufficiently meritorious to warrant a response.\n\nMore importantly, while Hamilton rejected the contention that the Spirits Act’s forfeiture provisions were “excessive,” he added a crucial caveat: The penalties the act provided for were neither unusual nor excessive when exacted as punishment for “wilful and fraudulent breach­es of an important law.” What this suggests is that such forfeitures would be considered “unusual and excessive”—that is, unconstitutional—if they were imposed for unintentional violations. Of course, sparing from punishment those who did not intend to violate the law is exactly what the remission power was intended to do. It is undoubtedly no coincidence that the criteria Hamilton used to identify constitutionally permissible penalties—those imposed for “wilful and fraudulent” violations—are the same Congress used in the 1790 Remission Act to demarcate violations for which remission was unavailable. The implica­tion is unmistakable: The remission power is what saved civil forfeiture from constitutional objection.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton’s report offers further reason to think that, in his view, remission was necessary to preserve forfeiture’s constitutionality. Later in the report, Hamilton enumerated the features of the Spirits Act that prevented it from “operating severely or oppressively,” as its critics charged. First among them—unsurprisingly—was the act’s remission provision, which gave the Treasury Secretary exactly the same authority to mitigate penalties as the general remission acts gave him with respect to customs and maritime violations—that is, in cases where the penalty was “incurred without wilful negligence, or any design or intention of fraud.” In other words, what rendered civil forfeiture constitutionally unobjectionable was the fact that remission protected those who, in Hamilton’s words, committed “undesigned transgressions of the law.”\n\nAdmittedly, a few sentences in a report to Congress is a slender reed on which to base conclusions about Hamilton’s views on forfeiture’s constitutional limits, let alone to attribute those views to his contemporaries. But this evidence should not be dismissed lightly, because it may explain why, for two decades after Ratification, Hamilton and his successors in office exercised the remission power more generously and comprehensively than either the statutory language required or sound policy recommended, and why Congress repeatedly endorsed their approach. In exercising the remission power to its fullest extent—ensuring relief for anyone who could plausibly claim a lack of fraudulent intent—the Secretaries ensured that civil forfeiture did not transgress the constitutional limits that Hamilton seemed to recognize.\n\nThe insights to be gleaned from Hamilton’s report might also help solve a puzzle regarding civil forfeiture’s constitutionality: Why is the early history apparently devoid of any constitutional challenges to particular forfeitures in court? One might reasonably argue—as scholars and litigants recently have—that the absence of judicial discussion of constitutional limits on the forfeiture power serves as powerful evidence that, at least until the twentieth century, no one imagined that the Constitution had anything to say about forfeiture’s limits.\n\nThe early Treasury Secretaries’ maximal exercise of the remission power points to a different answer: Innocent claimants seeking return of their property did not make constitutional arguments in court because they did not have to go to court at all. Given the very high rate of success for remission petitions, claimants who could make colorable assertions of lack of fraudulent intent likely preferred remission’s near-guaranteed path to relief than the expense and uncertainty of trial. This possibility is borne out by the numbers; of the nearly 600 forfeiture actions instituted in New York and Pennsylvania federal court from 1789 to 1807, half were resolved through the remission process, and another thirty-eight percent were default judgments in favor of the government. Only the remaining twelve percent were “contested” in court, and this includes many cases that were voluntarily dismissed by one of the parties after proceedings had begun. In other words, owners of seized property who had no viable basis for challenging a forfeiture simply did not bother to do so. And those who did have viable claims to relief took them to the Treasury Secretary, not to the courts.\n\nIn this sense, we can see the remission power as a constitutional safety valve: statutory authority granted to the executive branch to ensure that the government’s use of forfeiture did not transgress constitutional limits. Remission moderated—yet preserved—the government’s power to forfeit property in response to lawbreaking. In other words, the Secretaries’ expansive use of remission may have precisely been what made the government’s otherwise unfettered power to forfeit private property constitutionally acceptable.\n\nC. Forfeiture’s Future\n\nEven if we accept that remission’s early history points to a Founding Era understanding that forfeiture was subject to constitutional limita­tions, a question remains: Must any limits we can discern from the historical record be judicially enforced today?\n\nPerhaps not. If nothing else, Congress’s early establishment of the remission power, combined with the Treasury Secretaries’ robust exercise of that power, suggests a Founding Era commitment to enforcing limits on the forfeiture power via the executive branch, not the courts. In other words, if forfeiture’s early history supports the argument that forfeiture must be substantively bounded by principles of innocence and proportionality, that history offers less support for the notion that, as a procedural matter, such principles must be vindicated by judges.\n\nInstead, what this history might suggest is just what Hamilton implied in his report to Congress: Providing an avenue for meaningful administrative relief satisfies any constitutional obligation to spare those guilty of only minor or unintentional transgressions from forfeiture’s most severe consequences. The Supreme Court, in fact, has suggested as much. In Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., the Court affirmed its view that due process did not mandate a rule protecting innocent owners from forfeiture. Yet the Court acknowledged that “the ‘broad sweep’ of forfeiture statutes . . . could . . . give rise to serious constitutional questions.” In particular, a forfeiture incurred by an owner who had “done all that reasonably could be expected” to prevent the violation might very well be “unduly oppressive.”\n\nIn addressing this possibility, the Calero-Toledo Court pointed to the existence of the very remission procedures discussed here, beginning with the 1790 Remission Act. It discussed at length how historical and modern-day remission statutes have consistently offered relief to those who forfeited their property through no fault of their own. Though the Court did not expressly say that such remission procedures provide the protections for innocent owners that the Constitution could be understood to demand, that was the import of the Court’s discussion.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, such avenues arguably "
