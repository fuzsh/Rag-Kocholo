The chair was probably brought from Fotheringay, and placed in Conington Church as a sacred relic, by Sir Robt. Cotton, who built Conington Castle partly with the materials of Fotheringay, and who (according to Gough, in his additions to Camden's Britannia, vol. ii., \"Iceni,\" ed. 1789) \"brought from there the whole room where Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded.\" By this, perhaps, is meant, the deeply-recessed arcade that now forms the two exterior sides of the ground-floor of Conington Castle; which arcade, doubtless, was on the interior walls of Fotheringay, the windows being above it: the principal window being supposed to be that which now forms the staircase window of the Talbot Inn, Oundle. Modern windows have been placed within the eleven divisions of the arcade at Conington Castle.\n\nIn speaking of Conington Church, Gough says (see Additions to Camden) that \"Lord Coleraine saw a chair of an Abbot of Peterborough in this church, 1743,\" which must have been the chair now under notice. The nature of its decorations shows it to have been a chair used for religious purposes; and the six principal figures that adorn it, are made to face at right angles with the chair; so that when it was placed on the south side of the altar, the faces of the figures would be turned towards the east.\n\nA full description of the chair may not be without its interest to the readers of \"N. & Q.,\" since (as far as I am aware) it has never yet received more than a passing notice from the historian; and if it indeed be a relic of Mary Stuart—as there seems good reason to believe—it deserves more attention (in these days of minute detail) than it has hitherto obtained.\n\nThe top of the chair is battlemented, and flanked by the two side-pieces which terminate in pediments supporting figures. Both figures are seated on {198}low chairs of a massive ecclesiastical character. The right-hand figure (which is headless) holds an open volume, and is apparelled in chasuble and alb. The left-hand figure is seated on a more highly-decorated seat, wears a crown, and is bearded; is vested in chasuble, alb, and dalmatic; and, though the hands are deficient, evidently did not, like the other figure, bear an open volume. Both figures face to the east. The upper part of the back of the chair is filled in with a pointed arch, cusped, and highly ornamented; the arcs being divided into smaller cusps, which terminate (as do the larger) with leaves and trefoils carved with great richness. In the spandrels of the cusps are birds with outspread wings, bearing labels. Those on the left appear to be eagles; those on the right have long bills, and may be intended for pelicans. The large right-hand spandrel of the arch contains a figure of the Virgin Mary, crowned as \"the Queen of Heaven,\" clad in long flowing drapery, with her hands upraised, apparently in benediction, and her hair loose and streaming. Near to her is her emblem, the pot of lilies; the pot being much decorated, the lilies five in number. It stands upon a label, whose folds fill up the rest of the spandrel. The left-hand large spandrel contains the figure of an angel feathered to the elbow and knee, his wings outspread, and a label proceeding from one hand. The arms of the chair are divided into two parts. The first part terminates in a graceful curve, supporting a figure: the second part is continued with a curve, carried on into the wings of a figure kneeling upon one knee: the intervals are filled up with open Gothic work. The four figures on the arms are all angels, whose wings are made to rest upon, or join into, the curved form of the chair-arm. They all face to the east, and are clad in loose drapery; the folds of which (as in the cases of the other figures) are carved with great minuteness, and disposed with much knowledge of artistic effect. The upper left-hand figure holds a trumpet; that on the right a stringed instrument, which neither resembles the Grecian, Roman, Jewish, or Egyptian lyre, but has precisely the same form as the modern \"banjo\" of the negroes. Of the two angels on the lower divisions of the arm, the one on the right bears a legend, and the one on the left appears to have done the same, but the arms have been broken off. These legends may have been illuminated with texts of Scripture, &c. The sides of the chair are recessed, and filled in with a species of Gothic tracery that is apparently of later date than the rest. The front of the chair is panelled, and the foot is decorated with quatrefoils in high relief.\n\nDuring the sleep of indifferentism which fell upon the church towards the close of the past century, all interest attaching to the chair seems to have been forgotten; and, after a lapse of years, it was discovered by the late Mr. Heathcote, of Conington Castle, in a room of the belfry of the church, where it had been thrust aside with other things as useless lumber, and daubed with the whitewash and paint of the generations of workmen who had cleansed their brushes on its broad surface. Mr. Heathcote, with a praiseworthy regard for a relic of so much interest, resolved to replace the chair in the position it had formerly occupied in the chancel of the church: but before this could be done, it was necessary to repair the ill usage which the chair had received, and to restore it, as much as possible, to its original condition. It was accordingly confided to trustworthy and skilful hands; the old ornamental portions were replaced, and the chair was in every way restored strictly in accordance with its original design. It is now in a good state of repair, and will probably remain for many ages a mute memorial of that tragic scene in which it once played its part.\n\nAnd, could we imagine the Dryad that watched over its forest-birth had filled its oaken frame with speech and feeling: or that a greater Power had put a voice into its shape, and caused the beam out of its timber to cry out against the cruel death-scene in the banquet-hall of Fotheringay, we might almost suppose it to have denounced the English Queen in the words of the Prophet Habakkuk (ii. 10, 11.):\n\n\"Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul. For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.\"\n\nAnd, so long as that chair remains in the church of Conington, and the stones of the banquet-hall of Fotheringay form a portion of its castle, so long shall that cry go up to heaven, and tell the hapless doom of Mary Stuart!\n\nCuthbert Bede, B.A.\n\nINEDITED LETTER OF WARREN HASTINGS.\n\nThe subjoined letter, believed to be unpublished, is so characteristic of the energy and decision of the great governor-general of India, that I think it worth recording in your publication. It appears to be written and signed by him immediately after, as when it came into my possession the bright sand then in use was adherent more or less to the whole document. Sir Philip Francis and the other signature are in a different ink, and were so awkwardly in their place, that it would indicate that those signatures were previously obtained.\n\nH. W. D.\n\n\"To Capt. Robinson, Commander of the Morning Star.\n\n(Secret Department.)\n\n\"You are hereby commanded to proceed down the River with this Tide, to seize all the French {199}pilot vessels and pilots which you may be able to find, and bring them up to Calcutta.\n\n\"A pilot will be sent on board you by the Master Attendant, who will furnish you with orders to him to point to you such pilot vessels as may be in the service of the French nation.\n\n\"In the execution of this service the utmost secrecy is to be observed.\n\nMEDIÆVAL EMBLEMS OF THE PASSION.\n\nThe venerable Priory Church of Great Malvern contains a series of these emblems, among which are some I have never before met with; and as they may be interesting to some of your readers, I have made a note of them. They have evidently been moved from some other part of the church to their present position in St. Anne's Chapel, and as a few of the more usual emblems are wanting, the series has probably been more complete than it is now. The date of the glass is the latter half of the fifteenth century, and consists of a series of demi-angels, each bearing a shield, upon which these emblems are depicted.\n\nOn the first are two heads, representing Judas kissing his Master, the head of the Saviour being surrounded by the usual cruciform nimbus.\n\n2. The reed, here drawn as a bulrush with flag leaves, crossed by a mace.\n\n3. The lantern.\n\n4. Christ blindfolded; represented symbolically as having a thin muslin bandage over His eyes, which are seen through it and depicted wide open, as if not at all affected by it.\n\n5. Two hands issuing from the dexter side of the shield, as if in the act of buffeting; from the sinister side issues one hand pulling a beard or lock of hair.\n\n6. The spear of Longinus, with drops of blood and water trickling from it, crossed by the reed and the sponge.\n\n7. The cock that warned St. Peter.\n\n8. The crown of thorns.\n\n9. The cross.\n\n10. The falchion of St. Peter crossed by another mace.\n\n11. The seamless vest.\n\n12. The hammer between two nails only.\n\n13. The purse of Judas overflowing with money, represented as a merchant's gypciere.\n\n14. The ladder.\n\n15. Two scourges or flagelli crossing each other.\n\n16. The sacred monogram, I.H.C.\n\n17. The five wounds.\n\n18. St. Veronica, with the napkin outspread impressed with the sacred head.\n\n19. An impudent repulsive head in the act of spitting.\n\n20. The lower portion of the pillar entwined with the cord.\n\nTo this Note I wish to add a Query. Have any of your correspondents ever met with, in similar representations, the instruments I have described as maces in shields 2. and 10.? The first has a round termination, with three triangular-shaped spikes issuing from it, one at the end, and one on each side of the ball; the second has a pointed oval, or egg-shaped end, and is quite studded with spikes, not triangular, but straight like the teeth of a woolcomb; they evidently refer to the \"weapons\" mentioned in St. John xviii. 3., and I am not aware of the existence of any similar types. I may also state that those mentioned on shields 1. 4. 5. and 19. are by no means usual.\n\nWhile on this subject I will add a list of the other emblems I have met with not included in this series, and shall be glad to receive from any of your readers any additions to it.\n\nThe ear of Malchus; the two swords which they showed the Lord when He said \"It is enough;\" the three dice; the pincers; the thirty pieces of silver; the pitcher of water which our Saviour used when He washed His disciples' feet; the towel, generally represented hanging from a ring, with which He wiped them; the fire at which St. Peter warmed himself, and the three spice-boxes for embalming. I shall also be glad to hear if the representation of two nails only instead of the usual number of three, occurs in any other instance.\n\nNorris Deck.\n\nGreat Malvern.\n\nBOOKSELLING IN CALCUTTA.\n\nLooking over your Queries this morning, my attention was drawn to that now in course of elucidation in your pages—the origin of the phrase \"Sending a man to Coventry.\" I am not about to offer any explanation thereof, but simply to chronicle in your columns, more for the amusement than the edification of your readers, a reminiscence of an eccentric application of a passage in Shakspeare bearing upon this popular dislike to Coventry.\n\nAny of your readers who may have visited the capital of British India will recollect the native kitaub-wallahs, or booksellers, who drive a good trade in the streets of Calcutta by thrusting their second-hand literature into the palanquins of the passers, and their pertinacity and success in fixing master with a bargain. For the information of the untravelled, I may further remark that these flying bibliopoles draw their supplies from {200}the daily auctions arising out of the migratory habits or the mortality to which the residents in that city are subject; and it would somewhat astonish our Sothebys and Putticks to see the extent of these sales of literary property, and derange their tympanums to hear the clamorous competition among the aforesaid half-naked dealers for lots not catalogued with their bibliographical precision. The books thus purchased, I may further observe, are subject to the overhaul of the better-informed of the tribe before they make their appearance in the streets; when deficiencies are made good, bindings vamped, and lettering attempted: finally, they are placed in the hands of the hawkers, when the following peculiarities are detectable:—where a title or last leaf may have been wanting, these Calcutta editions occasionally display a prophane book with a sacred title; or a pious treatise, for the sake of the word \"Finis,\" made complete by affixing the last leaf of Tristram Shandy or the Devil on Two Sticks! Less intelligent jobbers will open their book, and, finding the first word \"Preface,\" clap it incontinently in gilt letters on the back! I leave the imagination of the reader to fill up the cross-readings which would likely result from such practices, and revert to my anecdote, which I had almost lost sight of.\n\nSome twenty years ago, then, the dingy tribes were startled, and the auctioneer gratified by the appearance of a new face in the bidders' box—a brisk little European, who contested every lot, aiming, apparently, at a monopoly in the second-hand book trade. Shortly thereafter, this individual, having located himself in a commanding position, came forth in the daily papers as a candidate for public favour; and, in allusion to the reformation he contemplated, and his sovereign contempt for his black brethren, headed his address, to the no small amusement of the lieges, in the Falstoffian vein:\n\nThis joke was no doubt thrown away upon his Hindoo and Mussulman rivals, but, alas for the reformer! he little knew the cold indifference of the Anglo-Indian about such matters, and, as might have been expected, he failed in establishing himself in business, and ultimately fell a victim to the climate. Of the previous history of this one, among ten thousand, who have left their bones in the land of cholera, I know nothing beyond the fact that he was a son of Thomas Holcroft, a dramatist of repute in his day.\n\nJ. O.\n\nFOLK LORE.\n\nSubterranean Bells (Vol. vii., p. 128.).—The tower and nave of Tunstall Church, Norfolk, are in ruins; the chancel alone being used for divine service. The village tradition says, that this calamity was caused by fire; and that the parson and churchwardens quarreled for the possession of the bells which were uninjured. During their altercation, the arch-fiend walked off with the subjects of dispute; but being pursued, and overtaken by the parson—who began to exorcise in Latin—he made a way through the earth to his appointed dwelling-place, taking them with him. The spot where this took place is now a boggy pool of water, called Hell Hole; and an adjoining clump of alder-trees is called Hell Carr. In summer time, a succession of bubbles—doubtless caused by marsh gas—keep constantly appearing on the surface. Those who believe in the tradition, find in this circumstance a strong confirmation. For, as it is the entrance to the bottomless pit, the bells must be descending still; and the bubbles would necessarily be caused by bells sinking in water.\n\nIn the adjoining village of Halvergate, on the largest bell, is the following inscription:\n\nI suppose this must be \"audita Johannes,\" but the inscription certainly is avita.\n\nOn the second bell:\n\nOn the third bell, founder's name, and date 1653,—a solitary instance, I imagine, of an addition made to a peal of bells during the Puritan triumph of the Great Rebellion.\n\nE. G. R.\n\nFisherty Brow, near Kirkby Lonsdale, supplies such an instance as J. J. S. inquires after. There is a sort of natural hollow scooped out there, where a church, parson, and all the people, were swallowed up ages since; and any one who doubts it, may put his ear to the ground on a Sunday morning and hear the bells ring!\n\nP. P.\n\nOld Weather Proverb.—The old monkish Latin rhyme is very plainly verified this year:\n\nFebruary 2nd was a most brilliant day here, where I live, not twenty miles from London: the ground is now covered with snow, and the frost very sharp.\n\nC— S. T. P.\n\nW—— Rectory, Feb. 12.\n\n{201}\n\nPrimrosen.—The early appearance of primroses this year induces me to trouble you with some East-Anglian folk lore concerning them, premising that here the word still forms its plural in en.\n\nAt Cockfield, Suffolk, there are none, nor, it is said, do they thrive when planted; though they are numerous in all the surrounding villages, which do not apparently differ from Cockfield in soil.\n\nThe village legend says that here, too, they once were plentiful, but when Cockfield was depopulated by the plague, they also caught the infection and died, nor have they flourished since that time.\n\nIn East Norfolk some old women are still found who believe that if a less number of primrosen than thirteen be brought into a house on the first occasion of bringing any in, so many eggs only will each hen or goose hatch that season. When recently admitted into deacon's orders, my gravity was sorely tried by being called on to settle a quarrel between two old women, arising from one of them having given one primrose to her neighbour's child, for the purpose of making her hens hatch but one chicken out of each set of eggs. And it was seriously maintained that the charm had been successful.\n\nSince then I have heard that it only has an influence over geese. Perhaps this may account in some measure for the belief. In early seasons, persons are induced to carry in specimens of the first spring flowers that they find. In such seasons, too, fowls lay early, and perhaps do not sufficiently protect their eggs. The ungenial weather which too frequently succeeds spoils the eggs, and the effect is attributed to the \"primrosen\" of course; the cases where a few flowers are brought in, and the fowls have numerous broods, remain unnoticed.\n\nE. G. R.\n\nHarvest Home Song, sung in some Parts of Surrey.—\n\nR. W. F.\n\nBath.\n\nINEDITED POEM ON CHAUCER.\n\nI lately bought a black-letter Chaucer (1561), in which I find MS. notes by two or three writers. One is in rather a crabbed handwriting, and dates from 1574. I must own to being unable to decipher this gentleman's notes to my satisfaction; but the writing of another is clear and distinct. There are a few emendations on the \"Rime of Sire Thopas,\" and the following \"Eulogium Chaucerj.\" I do not know whether it has appeared anywhere in print before; and as my reading in the British poets is too limited for me to say anything about its author, I should be glad if you or any one of your correspondents would inform me who the lines are by:—\n\nT. A. S.\n\nMinor Notes.\n\n\"Le Balafré.\"—I was surprised to see that Miss Strickland, in the three volumes published of the Lives of the Queens of Scotland, always ascribes this well-known sobriquet to Francis, second Duke of Guise, instead of his son Henry, third duke. This is a mistake which I should have thought the merest tyro in history could not have committed about persons of so much note, and affords another instance of what Messrs. Macaulay and Alison had already exemplified, that writers of the most profound research will often err as to matters which lie, as it were, on the very surface.\n\nJ. S. Warden.\n\nMacpherson's \"Ossian.\"—It would appear as if Macpherson had picked up his information about British history in the pages of a kindred spirit, Geoffrey of Monmouth, for certainly he could have found in no other writer that Caracalla and Carausius were cotemporaries.\n\nJ. S. Warden.\n\n{202}\n\nEpitaph from Tichfield.—The curious epitaph which I inclose was copied, as closely as possible, from a monument in Tichfield Church, Hants. You may perhaps think it worthy of a place in \"N. & Q.\"\n\nRubi.\n\n\"A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!\" Richard III., Act V. Sc. 4.—In the edition of the Walewein published by Professor Jonckbloet, Leyden, 1846, is found, vol. ii. p. 178., a remarkable parallel passage to the world-famed line of Shakspeare, the verses 16007-8 of the Lancelot, a romance of the Middle Ages:\n\nJ. M.\n\nWeight of American Revolutionary Officers.—On the 10th of August, 1778, the American officers at West Point were weighed, with the following result:\n\nLbs. Gen. Washington 209 Gen. Lincoln 224 Gen. Knox 280 Gen. Huntingdon 182 Gen. Greaton 166 Col. Swift 319 Col. Michael Jackson 252 Col. Henry Jackson 238 Lt.-Col. Huntingdon 212 Lieut.-Col. Cobb 182 Lt.-Col. Humphreys 221\n\nOnly three of the eleven weighed less than two hundred pounds,—a result which does not confirm the Abbé Raynal's theory of the deterioration of mankind in America.\n\nUneda.\n\nPhiladelphia.\n\nThe Patronymic \"Mac.\"—The Inverness Courier of 1823 gives a list of genuine Celtic surnames beginning with Mac, amounting to no less than 392.\n\nKirkwallensis.\n\nErroneous Forms of Speech.—Should you consider the following as worth a place in your publication, they are at your service.\n\n1. The much used word Teetotal is wrong: it ought to be written Teatotal. It implies the use of tea, instead of intoxicating liquors: that was its original meaning. Let us return to the proper spelling. Better late than never.\n\n2. The expression, lately become very common, \"Up to the present time,\" and so forth, is wrong. It ought to be \"Down to the present time.\" The stream of time, like all other streams, is always descending. In tracing a thing backwards, from the present time, it is quite right to use the word up.\n\n3. The words down and up are much misapplied by the inhabitants of the provinces in another sense, not knowing, or forgetting that, par excellence, London is considered the highest locality: from every place, how high soever its position, it is \"up to London,\" and to every such place, it is \"down from London.\" In London itself, St. Paul's Cathedral is considered as the highest or central point; and in every street radiating from that point, it is up when going towards it, and down when going from it. In going from St. Paul's to the Poultry we go down Cheapside.\n\n4. The inhabitants of provincial towns and cities are much in the habit of saying such a person is not \"in town\" to-day. That is wrong: they ought to say \"in the town.\" The word town is, par excellence, applicable to London alone.\n\nRobert Smart.\n\nSunderland.\n\nHexameters from Udimore Register.—The following hexameters are copied from the fly-leaf of a register-book which dates back to 1500. They were written by a vicar in Elizabeth's reign. The burden of the lament is, that the tithes, now worth about 500l. a-year, had been sold by a \"sordid unprophetick priest\" for 30l. per annum, and that consequently all his successors found themselves \"vicars without tithes.\" The register-book is in the church of Udimore, near Rye, in Sussex:\n\nJ. Mn.\n\nDr. Johnson.—The parchment containing the grant of the freedom of the city of Aberdeen to the \"Literary Colossus,\" in 1773, once the property of {203}Mrs. Piozzi, was sold in Manchester in August, 1823, to an eminent bookseller in Bond Street.\n\nKirkwallensis.\n\nBorrowed Thoughts.—We often hear the man who, from his more advanced position, looks with contempt on the wisdom of past ages, likened to the child mounted on his father's shoulder, and boasting that he is the taller of the two.\n\nThis no new idea. It is probably derived immediately from Mr. Macaulay, who in his Essay on Sir James Mackintosh says:\n\n\"The men to whom we owe it that we have a House of Commons are sneered at because they did not suffer the debates of the House to be published. The authors of the Toleration Act are treated as bigots, because they did not go the whole length of Catholic Emancipation. Just so we have heard a baby, mounted on the shoulders of its father, cry out, 'How much taller I am than Papa!'\"\n\nBut it may be traced farther; for hear what Butler says (Hudibras, ii. 71.):\n\nErica.\n\nWarwick.\n\nSuggested Reprints.—Acting on the suggestion of J. M., I make a note of the following:\n\n\"Joshua Sprigge's Anglia Rediviva, London, 1647, gives a florid but authentic and sufficient account of this new-model army in all its features and operations by which England had come alive again. A little sparing in dates, but correct when they are given. None of the old books are better worth reprinting.\"—Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Cromwell.\n\nI would remark, also, that there are very few collections of maxims so good and profitable to the present time as Francis Quarles' Enchiridion, London, 1702, 12mo. A reprint would be very useful. There is an article thereon in the Retrospective Review, vol. v. p. 180.\n\nK. P. D. E.\n\nQueries.\n\nRIGBY CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nIn looking over old family papers, I find a bundle of letters, sixty-seven in number, some of them very interesting, written to my grandfather by Richard Rigby, commencing in the year 1758, and ending 1781. This Richard Rigby, it appears, held the then sinecure office of Master of the Rolls in Ireland, but resided altogether in England, and held office under several administrations as Paymaster of the Forces. His letters from 1769 to 1781 are all dated from the Pay Office. He is the Mr. Rigby whose awkward integrity is alluded to by Philo-Junius in his letter of 22nd June, 1769, and who is ironically styled \"Modest\" by Atticus in letter of 14th November, 1768. My object is to endeavour to ascertain from some of your correspondents whether there is any representative of Mr. Rigby who possibly might have in his possession the counterpart of the correspondence above alluded to, which to Irishmen could not fail to be of interest, and probably of historic value. The writer was a member of the Irish House of Commons, and, it appears, was in the habit of giving very graphic details of Irish politics in general, and of the proceedings of the House of Commons in particular. Under date of 8th December, 1769, Mr. Rigby thanks him\n\n\"For your constant accounts of what passes in your parliaments. If it was not for the intelligence I give the ministers from you and the rest of my friends, they would know no more of what is doing in the Irish Parliament than in the Turkish Divan. For (neither) the Lord Lieutenant nor his Secretary ever write a line to the Secretary of State.\"\n\nAgain, 2nd December, 1771:\n\n\"I am much obliged to you for your constant intelligence, and so are greater persons than myself, for I happened to be with Lord Rochford to-day when his letters arrived from his Excellency, and he had sent no despatches of a later date than the 26th, so that his Majesty and his ministers would have known nothing of a report having been made by that committee, but for my information. Lord R. sent your letters with my leave to the King. They will do no discredit to the writer, especially when compared to that blotting paper wrote by his Excellency.\"\n\nIn another letter he talks of the reports of speeches made by his correspondent being far better than those of any note-taker; so that if they are forthcoming, I have no doubt they would be of interest and value to the historian of Ireland of that time.\n\nK. K.\n\nHERALDIC QUERIES.\n\nCan any of your correspondents furnish me with the names to the following coats of arms?

H. P.\n\nON A PASSAGE IN ACTS XV. 23.\n\nDr. Burton (Greek Test., Oxford, 1848), in a note on the words ὁι πρεσβύτεροι καὶ ὁι ἀδελφοί (Acts xv. 23.), says: \"Most MSS. read ὁι πρεσβύτεροι ἀδελφοί.\" I should feel much obliged to any of your readers who could kindly direct me to some particular manuscripts, to which Dr. Burton may possibly have alluded when he wrote the above note; or who could refer me to any Greek MSS. of authority, in which the καὶ is not found. I have been enabled to consult the Codex Laudianus, a MS. of the seventh century; also the MS. Canon, of the early part of the tenth century; and the Codex Ebner., of the twelfth century. In neither of these is the καὶ missing. Nor am I aware of any Greek Bible or New Testament printed without the καὶ; nor indeed of any translation without the conjunction (though there may be some such) in Latin, or in any other language, with the single exception of the Vulgate after St. Jerome, and its several versions. The Bibles of Sixtus V. and Clement VIII., agreeing in this particular, read alike, \"Apostoli et seniores fratres.\" On the other hand, Vutablus, in his new translation, reads, \"Apostoli et presbyteri et fratres;\" which is likewise the reading of the interp. Syriac., as given in the Biblia Regia; also of Beza, as given in the edition of the Bible, Oliva Roberti Stephani, 1556; whilst in the Novum Testamentum e Græco archetypo Latino sermone redditum, Theodoro Beza interprete, ed. Hanov. 1623, the reading is, \"Apostoli, et seniores, et fratres;\" which is also the reading in Bibl. Sacr. ex Sebastiani Castellionis interpretatione, ed. Francofurti, 1697. To which may be added the Biblia Gallica, 1580; the Bibl. Belg., ed. Leydæ, 1737; and Luther's German Bible,—all which retain the and.\n\nI have also consulted a more important version, namely, the ancient Italic, which also reads, \"Apostoli, et seniores, et fratres;\" but which (in Pet. Sabatier's edition, Par. 1751) has appended to the verse the following note:\n\n\"V. 23.—MS. Cantabr. Scripserunt epistolam per manus suas continentem hæc, Apostoli, et presbyteri fratres, hiis qui sunt per Antiochiam, et Syriam, et Ciliciam, qui sunt ex gentibus fratribus, salutem.—Græc. textui Laud. consonat [versio Italica], nisi quòd habet κατὰ τὴν Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ Συρίαν, καὶ Κιλικίαν, pro Antiochiæ, et Syriæ, et Ciliciæ. MSS. quidam, pro χειρὸς manum, legunt χειρῶν, cum Vulg.; aliique plures tollunt καὶ post seniores. Irenæus, l. iii. c. 12. p. 199. a. legit: Apostoli, et presbyteri fratres, his qui sunt in Antiochia, et Syria, et Cilicia, fratribus ex gentibus salutem. S. Pacian., Paræn. ad Pœnit., p. 315. h.: Apostoli, et presbyteri fratres, his qui sunt Antiochiæ, et Syriæ, et Ciliciæ, fratribus qui sunt ex gentibus salutem. Vigil. Taps. l. xii. De Trin., p. 329. c.: Apostoli, et presb. fratres, iis, qui Antiochiæ, et Syr., et Cilic. fratribus qui sunt ex gentibus salutem.\"\n\nThis note certainly goes far to corroborate (if indeed it was not the chief authority for) Dr. Burton's assertion; but it does little to satisfy my curiosity on a point, which I conceive to be of considerable interest, and of no slight importance, at the present time. The Cambridge MS. appears to be in Latin only; as is also the passage referred to in Irenæus, whose original Greek is lost. So that, after all, there is some ground to suspect that there in fact exists no Greek manuscript whatsoever without the καὶ.\n\nI will add another note, which I find at the passage in Irenæus (Contr. Hær., lib. iii. cap. 14. p. 199., ed. Par. 1710):\n\n\"Sic cum Irenæo habent codd. Cantabrig. et Alexand. et Vulgatus interpres. At in editis Græcis: πρεσβύτεροι καὶ ὁι ἀδελφοί.\"\n\nJ. Sansom.\n\nOxford.\n\n{205}\n\nMinor Queries.\n\nBelatucadrus.—In the Poetical History, by the French Jesuit, P. Galtruchius, 5th edition, 1683, the sixteenth and closing chapter of the first book of this history of the heathen gods is devoted to those worshipped in England, and the last of whom mention is made is Belatucadrus, being introduced and summarily disposed of as follows:\n\n\"In time the idols did increase, and we find in ancient writers, some who have been transported hither by the eastern people, as the God (Abellio vocabatur in Gallia) Belenus, or Belatucadrus. The latter, to my knowledge, hath been adored in the north part of England; for lately, since the learned Camden hath mentioned him, there was a piece of his statue found in Westmoreland, near Brougham, a castle belonging to that bountiful and venerable lady, Anne Dorset, countess dowager of Pembrook and Montgomery, &c.; and in the bottom this inscription is to be seen: 'Sancto Deo Belatvcadro,' which idol was doubtless made by the Romans, for it was their custom to adore the gods of the country which they did conquer.\"\n\nMy object is to ascertain, if possible, if this portion of statue has been preserved? Has any subsequent discovery been made in the same locality respecting, or any additional light thrown upon, the one of which mention is herein made?\n\nKappa.\n\nSurname of Allan.—Perhaps Mr. Lower, or some other etymological reader of \"N. & Q.,\" may kindly assist me in my endeavours to find out the correct meaning and origin of this surname, variously spelt Allen, Allan, Allin, Alleyne, &c.? My theory on the subject, from various researches, is that it is a word of Celtic or Gaelic etymon, Aluinn, in that language, signifying \"delightful or pleasant.\" And again, several islet-rocks romantically situated in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, are called to this day Allans. I should much like, however, to have the opinions of older and more experienced etymologists than I can pretend to be; for few subjects present so interesting a field for different theories as that regarding the origin of family names does. As I am naturally interested in my own surname, I should also like to obtain a sketch of the different British families of note bearing the surname and arms of Allen or Allan, and references to those works which give their history and lineage.\n\nA. S. A.\n\nWuzzeerabad.\n\nArms of Owen Glendower.—Could any of your correspondents inform me of the blazoning of the arms of Owen Glendower, which, according to the copy of his private seal, furnished by Meyrick to the editor of the Poems of Lewis Glyn Cottie, are, Quarterly, four lions rampant; supporters, a dragon (gules?) and a lion?\n\nB. B. Woodward.\n\nTenent and Tenet.—When did the use of tenent (for opinion, dogma, &c.) give place to tenet? Surely both forms should be retained, and used according to circumstances. It is correct to speak of a tenet of John Wesley. When attributing the same doctrine to Wesleyans, it becomes their tenent.\n\nY. B. N. J.\n\n\"I hear a lion,\" &c.—Can any of your correspondents favour me with the origin of the following jeu d'esprit, reputed to have been addressed to the Speaker in the House of Commons?—\n\nTo ascertain by whom, and upon what occasion, the above lines were uttered, would considerably gratify\n\nSagitta.\n\n\"The Exercist Day\" at Leicester.—In the Chamberlain's accounts for this borough for the year 1604-5, I find the following entry:\n\n\"Item. The vjth of Novembr [1604], being the\n\nexercist daye, given to the preacher and mynistrs\n\nat the exercistz, one pottell of clarett\n\nwyne and one quarte of sacke s.\n\nij d.\n\niiij\n\nThere are also charges \"for wyne drunk at the exercist dinners, on the viijth of Jany, the fyfthe of Marche, and the ixth of April,\" 1605. Were these meetings held for the purpose of exorcising the evil spirits and witches, the belief in which had at that time greatly increased in England, through the recent accession of \"the modern Solomon\" to the throne? and, if so, was the practice a general one, or were they merely for religious exercises?\n\nA few years afterwards nine unfortunate women were tried at our assizes for witchcraft, and were convicted and executed!\n\nLeicestriensis.\n\nEcclus. xlvi. 20.—Why does the Church order this verse to be omitted in the reading of the lessons? Is it because the passage assumes the fact that Samuel himself appeared to Saul—a statement open to discussion?\n\nBœoticus.\n\nEdgmond, Salop.\n\nEtymology of Burrow.—In the north of Gloucestershire I have met with the word burrow (I do not answer for the orthography), meaning sheltered, secure from wind, &c. The side of a thick coppice was spoken of as \"a very burrow place for cattle.\" Can any of your correspondents give the etymology of the word, or other instances of its use?\n\nBalliolensis.\n\nAlexander Adamson.—I should be glad to know who Alexander Adamson was (the tutor who accompanied Wm. and Patrick Ruthven, the son of {206}the Earl of Gowrie, in their flight into England in August 1600), and what became of him? There was a Wm. Ruthven, of Scotland, married at Chitterton, Northumberland, to Esther, daughter of Robert Adamson, vicar of that parish in 1681. Was he any relation to the Gowrie family?\n\nE. H. A.\n\nPsalmanazar.—The great literary abilities of Psalmanazar, and indeed all the known circumstances of his life and history, excite some curiosity as to his real name. Can any of your readers inform me of this?\n\nSt. Johns.\n\nColeridge's Christabel.—In the original edition of this poem, the following lines are to be found at the beginning of Part II.:\n\nNow these lines, and a great many more which I cannot remember, as I have not the original edition, are to be found in an old volume of Blackwood's Magazine, in a review upon the poem. The poem, as published in the edition of Coleridge's Poems edited by D. and S. Coleridge (Moxon, 1852), does not contain these lines, and no notice is taken of the fact by the editors. Either Coleridge did or did not cancel the lines mentioned; if he did, can any of your readers inform me in which of his works this fact is mentioned? If he did not, then one of the most beautiful poems in the English language has been edited in a manner that no one, I trust, will imitate.\n\nS. Y.\n\nBeaten to a Mummy.—Whence comes this expression? It is used to signify, beaten so that form and feature are no longer distinguishable; whereas the immediate object of a mummy seems to be the preservation of the form and features of the deceased. Is not the phrase a corruption of beaten to a mammock, to a piece, to a scrap, to a fragment? And yet, in Marryatt's Pottery (Murray, 1850, p. 250.) is the following passage:\n\n\"Diodorus Siculus (Book V. ch. i.), in speaking of the usages of the inhabitants of the Balearic Isles, states that these people were in the habit of beating with clubs the bodies of the dead, which, thus rendered flexible, were deposited in vessels of earthenware.\"\n\nThe Gloucestershire peasants frequently use the word mammock, which they pronounce \"mommock.\"\n\nRobert Snow.\n\n6. Chesterfield Street, May Fair.\n\nHanover Rats.—It is said that the native rat was extirpated from this country by the invading colonists from Hanover. What are the facts of this case, and where may the best account of this extermination of the natives be found? It is worth inquiring also, whether the aboriginal rat is now to be met with in any part of Great Britain. I should think that rat-catchers and farming folks could throw light on this interesting point of the British fauna.\n\nShirley Hibberd.\n\nPallant.—In the town of Chichester there are four streets, north, south, east, and west, to which the name of \"Pallant\" is attached.\n\nThis particular spot, which is close to the High Street, is always called The Pallant.\n\nCan any of your readers inform me of the origin and meaning of this word?\n\nI have never met with any inhabitant of Chichester who could solve this difficulty.\n\nA Cantab.\n\nCurious Fact in Natural Philosophy.—The Exeter Alfred of 1828 has in one of its numbers the following:\n\n\"Cut a couple of cards each into a circle of about two inches in diameter; perforate one of these at the centre, and fix it on the top of a tube, say a common quill. Make the other card ever so little concave, and place it over the first, the orifice of the tube being that directly under, and almost in contact with the concave card. Try to blow off the upper card, you will find it impossible. We understand that the cause that counteracts the effect at first expected of this singular phenomenon, has lately puzzled all the members of the Royal Society. A medal and a hundred guineas are said to be the reward of the successful discoverer.\n\nCould any of the correspondents of \"N. & Q.\" give any additional information on this rather curious point?\n\nElginensis.\n\nDrying up of the Red Sea.—Will some of your correspondents kindly assist me, by a reference to a passage in one of our modern historians, alluding to the extraordinary drying up of the Red Sea on one occasion? I thought I had read it in Rollin, as a quotation from Baronius, but cannot now find it in either one or the other.\n\nW. Stillman.\n\nBirmingham.\n\nJoan d'Arc.—Did Joan d'Arc (the Maid of Orleans) bear any heraldic insignia; and if so, what?\n\nIs the family from which she sprung now represented; and if they bear arms, what are they?\n\nIs there any family of this name (D'Arc), and if so, where? And what are the arms belonging to it, if there are any?\n\nBend.\n\nDiary of Thomas Earl.—Strype (Annals, vols. i. & ii.) sometimes refers to a MS. No. 206. in the collection of Moore, Bishop of Ely, which he describes as a Diary (vol. i. pp. 135. 180.) kept {207}by Thomas Earl, who was made parson of St. Mildred's, Bread Street, at the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's reign, and \"seems to have been a diligent noter of matters of remark concerning religion in his time\" (vol. ii. p. 539.). In the Catal. Libr. MSS. Angl., part ii. p. 366., it is described—\n\n\"Short notes of matters relating to the church by way of annals, written by some that favoured Puritanism, from the year 1548 to 1599.\"\n\nBishop Moore left his library to the University of Cambridge. Is this MS. in their possession, and is it a piece of historic value?\n\nQ. Q.\n\n\"Jenny's Bawbee.\"—I would be glad if any of the readers of \"N. & Q.\" would inform me where the old Scottish song, \"Jenny's Bawbee,\" is to be found? It begins,\n\nJ. Mn.\n\nLord North.—In Forster's Life of Goldsmith, the following remark occurs respecting Lord North, George III.'s premier:\n\n\"North was the son of the princess dowager's intimate friend Lord Guildford, and scandal had not hesitated to find a reason for the extraordinary resemblance he presented to the king in his clumsy figure, homely face, thick lips, light complexion and hair, bushy eyebrows, and protruding large grey eyes.\"\n\nWill some one of your readers favour me with an explanation of the meaning of this insinuation? Is it really intended to say that \"scandal\" reported Lord North to be the son of an illustrious lady of the royal family? It is clear Lord North strikingly resembled George III.; did the latter \"favour\" his father or his mother in physiognomy? Did George III. represent the Guelphs or the Saxe-Gotha family?\n\nObserver.\n\nEphippiarius.—What is the meaning of the word \"Ephippiarius,\" occurring as the description of a person in a Latin diploma of the seventeenth century? Does it signify saddler, or, as has been suggested to me, esquire?\n\nV.\n\nNixon.—Can any of your readers inform me if there was a painter of this name living at Brighton in or about the year 1806, what pictures he painted, &c., and when he died?\n\nJohn Garland.\n\nDorchester.\n\nTuebeuf.—Where is it? A royal charter to the town of Doncaster, given by the hand of Master Eustacius, Dean of Salisbury, Deputy-Chancellor, and witnessed by an Archbishop of Canterbury and others, is dated at Tuebeuf, 22nd May, 5 Richard I. (1194). In Miller's History of Doncaster (Appendix, Deed No. 1.), the name is printed \"Tuke or Toke,\" but on a reference to the original document it appears as above.\n\nJ. E. J.\n\nTooth of Sir I. Newton.—\n\n\"A tooth of Sir Isaac Newton was sold in 1815 for 730l.: a nobleman bought it, and had it set in a ring.\"\n\nThe above has gone the round of the papers without comment, contradiction, or illustration. Lest it should become matter of history, I wish to ask whether it is a new story or an old one; and whether it is a simple lie, or has any foundation in fact?\n\nH. B. C.\n\nU. U. C.\n\nThomas Ceeley.—Who was Thomas Ceeley, who defended Lyme Regis so gallantly with the famous Blake, the former being governor? His exploits have been recorded in the History of Lyme Regis, &c. Probably we must look to Plymouth for his residence.\n\nMr. Christopher Ceeley was with Sir Francis Drake in his third voyage into the West Indies in 1572-3. The \"Elizabeth Drake,\" of sixty tons and thirty men, under Sir Francis Drake, when acting against the Armada, was commanded by Thomas Sealye, another way of spelling Ceeley. There were Ceeleys, Sealeys, &c., in Devonshire and Somersetshire.\n\nG. R. L.\n\nMarigmerii—Melinglerii—Berefellarii.—In Pirri's Sicilia Sacra (Grævius, Antiqu. Sicil., ii. 425.) four officers of the inferior clergy, called marigmerii, are enumerated among the members of the cathedral of Montereale: and, in the same work (iii. 921.), two officers in the cathedral of Cifalu called melinglerii. Can either or both of these words be misprints, or corruptions of some word answering to the French marguillier, which in parish churches means a churchwarden, in collegiate churches a keeper of the relics? And what is the derivation of marguillier?\n\nIn Dugd. Monast., edit. 1830, vi. 1308., seven of the inferior clergy of the collegiate church of Beverley are called by what is said to be an ancient name, Berefellarii. What does this word mean? Can it be a blunder, in the original document, for beneficiatii?\n\nJohn Jebb.\n\nPeterstow Rectory, Ross.\n\n\"Judæus odor.\"—\n\nI have seen the above lines attributed to Vigilantius, but have not been able to verify the quotation. Can any of your readers tell me where they are to be found? I suspect they are not of so great antiquity, as Sir Thomas Browne (Vulgar Errors, book iv. chap. 10.), though he investigates {208}and denies the \"Judæus odor,\" does not notice the opinion that it is removed by baptism.\n\nH.\n\nLord Lyon King-at-Arms, Scotland.—Where is there an account of the origin of this office, and of the different possessors of it? Scotland does not, I believe, possess any corresponding work to Noble's History of the College of Arms, and I know of no history which contains the above-desired information collectively. To trace the succession of the Lord Lyon Kings-at-Arms would be interesting, as many celebrated, and even illustrious, individuals held that high office in Scotland. Poets as well as warriors might be mentioned amongst the number.\n\nA. S. A.\n\nWuzzeerabad.\n\nLouisa Lady Gordon of Gordonstoun, N. B.—This lady, who was the only child of Dr. John Gordon, Dean of Salisbury in England, and Lord of Glenluce in Scotland, married, 1653, Sir Robert Gordon, son of the Earl of Sutherland (better known as the historian of that earldom), who was created a baronet in 1625, and died in 1656. Their lineal male descendants became extinct in 1795, in the person of their great-great-grandson, Sir William, the sixth baronet. What I desire to ascertain is, who was Lady Gordon's father, this dean of Salisbury; his marriage, death, &c., and more especially how he was Lord of Glenluce? Perhaps some of your antiquarian subscribers may be able to assist me in these inquiries.\n\nA. S.

Z.\n\nMinor Queries with Answers.\n\nGame of the Whetstone.—In Lambarde's Perambulation of Kent (page 110., ed. 1596), the author, remarking on Ealred's assertion that King Edward the Confessor saw at mass the seven sleepers at Ephesus turn on one side after having slept seventy years together on the other, says:\n\n\"Which seeing it was within five years of so many as Epimenides slept, Ealred (in my phansie) is worthie to have the second game at the whetstone.\"\n\nIn the margin the note to this is—\n\n\"i Loue Lye or game for the whetstone.\"\n\nHalliwell, in his Dictionary, says that in old authors frequent allusions occur to the custom of decorating notorious liars with whetstones; but I would thank any of your readers for a fuller account of \"ye game for ye whetstone.\" What is known of Lambarde, or Lambert, as Gervase Markham calls him? Was his Topographicall Dictionarie (mentioned, as prepared for the press, in the Perambulation) ever published, and what other works by him exist?\n\nE. G. R.\n\nMeals.—On the N.W. coast of Norfolk are certain sandbanks so called. Brancaster Meals, Blakeney Meals, and Wells Meals are among those most dreaded by the mariner.\n\nIn Bailey's Dictionary occurs,\n\n\"Meales, Malls. The shelves or banks of sand on the sea-coasts of Norway.\"\n\nCan Norway be a misprint for Norfolk? It occurs Norway in ten or twelve editions of Bailey which I have examined. I can find no mention of \"meals\" or \"malls\" in any map of Norway, {209}except the whirlpool, the Maelström, be connected with it. In Norfolk ea, ee are frequently changed for oa, oo. Thus \"sheaf\" and \"reek\" are in Norfolk \"shoaf\" and \"roke;\" and \"smeath,\" a table land, is evidently from \"smooth.\"\n\nCan this change of vowels have taken place in this word, and \"meals\" signify \"moles,\" from the shelf of sand projecting like a mole? or can any correspondent suggest a better etymology?\n\nE.

If Bishop Stanley was appointed to this see in 1542, who was the possessor of it subsequently to the death of Bishop Huan Hesketh, or Blackleach, in 1510, a period of thirty-two years? Bishop Stanley's consecration does not appear in Cranmer's Register, which throws some doubt on the year 1542 as having been that of his appointment to the episcopate.\n\nA. S.

Edinburgh as above, 1688 and 1776.\"\n\nLockhart, in his Life of Scott, has told us with what enthusiasm Sir Walter welcomed a copy of the first edition of this \"True History,\" procured for him by Constable; and its rarity is accounted for by the author himself, when he says,—\n\n{210}\n\nSigma inquires why \"this ancestor of Sir Walter's was called Old Satchels?\" Hear the poet himself upon this point:\n\nAs a further sample of this old soldier's poetry, take his dedication \"To the truely Worthy, Honorable, and Right Worshipful Sir Francis Scot of Thirlston, Knight Baronet, wishes Earth's honor and Heaven's happiness:\"\n\nSatchels' chronicle deals largely in warlike matters. The Captain, indeed, seems to have a contempt for all not of his own honorable profession; consequently the book is full of the deeds, both foreign and domestic, of the \"Bold Buccleugh,\" and the clans Scott and Elliott. Instigated, no doubt, by the example of John Barbour and Henry the Minstrel, the author aimed at doing for the Scotts what his prototypes so worthily achieved, respectively, for Robert Bruce and William Wallace.\n\nAs mentioned by T. G. S., there was another reprint of this curious book, that of Hawick, by Caw, 1784. I know not to whom we owe either. Looking, however, to the names of the printers and period of publication, I should say that the earliest of these may have been one of the publications of that friend to the literature of his country, Sir David Dalrymple; and as we know that Sir Walter Scott made his first appearance as a poet in the Poetical Museum, printed at Hawick, by Caw, in 1786, may he not, with his strong and early predilection for the honour of the clan Scott, and his special affection for this \"True History\" of his namesake, have prompted the worthy Mr. Caw to the enterprise? Any edition of the book is of rare occurrence; and it has often surprised me that Captain Walter Scot should have been overlooked, when the Bannatyne, Maitland, and Abbotsford Clubs were so nobly employed in resuscitating the old literature of Scotland.\n\nJ. O.\n\nSTATUE OF ST. PETER.\n\n(Vol. vi., p. 604.; Vol. vii., pp. 96. 143.)\n\nB. H. C. asks for the authority on which is based the statement, that this statue was undoubtedly cast for a St. Peter, and cast in the time of St. Leo the Great (440-461). As the subject involves three questions, I will answer each separately.\n\n1. Was this statue cast for a St. Peter, or is it an ancient statue that had been found in the Tiber; or the ancient statue of Jupiter Capitolinus? That it must have been cast for a St. Peter will be readily allowed, after a careful examination, by any one at all accustomed to compare Pagan and Christian statues. The left hand holding the keys and the right hand raised in benediction, are unmistakeable evidences of the personage represented.\n\n2. What authority is there for believing it to have been cast in the pontificate of St. Leo? The authority is, first, a constant and very ancient tradition to that effect; secondly, a tradition that this same statue belonged to the ancient church of St. Peter's; and, thirdly, the almost unanimous belief in this tradition amongst the antiquaries and archæologists—local and at a distance, deceased and living.\n\nThis tradition is mentioned by most writers on the Basilica of St. Peter's:\n\n\"A destra evoi, in somma venerazione tenata, una statua in bronzo dell' apostolo S. Pietro, simulacro formato, secondo la pia tradizione, a tempi di S. Leone I. detto il grande,\" &c.—Melchiorri, p. 181., ed. 1840.\n\n\"On the right hand is a statue, held in very great veneration, of bronze, of the Apostle St. Peter: a figure cast, according to the pious tradition, in the time of St. Leo I., named the Great.\"\n\nTradition also asserts, that the statue belonged to the old church of St. Peter's:\n\n\"The seated bronze statue of St. Peter, which belonged to the ancient church, is said to have been cast in the time of Leo the Great.\"—Rome, Ancient and Modern, by J. Donovan, D.D., vol. i. p. 314.\n\nThere may now be seen, in what was part of old St. Peter's, and is now called the \"Grotte Vecchie,\" where the old flooring still remains—the old base of the bronze figure of St. Peter. It is {211}kept in the aisle to the left, as you enter the Grotte Vecchie; and was the pedestal of the statue till it was removed from the crypt by Paul V., as Melchiorri informs us. The old base was left in situ, and a new one made, which is the chair of white marble, with the whole surface wrought in arabesque bas-relief, upon a pedestal of light coloured alabaster, with a central tablet of granite, called \"granito verde.\"\n\n3. Was this statue cast from the metal of the Capitoline Jove? Melchiorri almost favours the opinion that it was; but the evidence of Martial, already quoted, seems fatal to this supposition. It occurs to me that the idea of this statue being a Jupiter converted, either by melting down or partial alteration, may have arisen from confounding this statue with another statue of St. Peter, now kept in the crypt of the church under the dome, and in the chapel of the Madonna della Bocciata or del Portico. This is also a seated statue of St. Peter, and stood in the atrium of the ancient basilica. It seems to have been a Pagan figure converted:—\n\n\"There is reason to believe that this statue of St. Peter had been originally erected to some Gentile; and that the head, arms, and hands were changed in order to metamorphose it into a St. Peter. In the old church it was usual to vest it pontifically on the feast of St. Peter, as is now the case with the bronze statue above. The Isaurian iconoclast threatened St. Gregory II. with the demolition of this statue: but the impotent menace cost him the duchy of Rome, and placed the temporal power in the hands of the Popes.\"—Rome, Ancient and Modern, vol. i. p. 574.\n\nPossibly enough, the fact of this figure of St. Peter having been converted, may have led to the idea that it was the other and better known statue. It may be well to add, that in St. Peter's there are forty metal statues, in addition to one hundred and five in marble, one hundred and sixty-one in travertine, and ninety in stucco.\n\nCeyrep.\n\nLORD CLARENDON AND THE TUBWOMAN.\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 133.)\n\nThe newspaper paragraph in question is quoted, in a MS. note in my possession, from the Salisbury Journal of August 29, 1828. From what source it was derived does not appear: the whole story is, however, fabulous. Edward Hyde, first Earl of Clarendon, was twice married. His first wife was the daughter of Sir George Ayliffe, of Foxley, in the county of Wilts. He married her in 1628, when he was only twenty years old, and she died of the small-pox six months afterwards, before any child was born. In 1632 he married Frances, daughter of Sir Thomas and Lady Ailesbury, by whom he had four sons and two daughters. Anne, the eldest daughter, became, as is well known, the wife of the Duke of York, and the mother of Queen Mary and Queen Anne. Sir Thomas Ailesbury, the father of Lord Clarendon's second wife, was a person of some distinction, both social and intellectual; of his wife, Lady Ailesbury, Pepys mentions in his Diary, November 13, 1661, that the Duke of York is in mourning for his wife's grandmother, \"which (he however adds) is thought a piece of fondness.\" In the collection of pictures at the Grove, the seat of the present Earl of Clarendon, there are portraits by Vandyke of Sir Thomas and Lady Ailesbury, and also a portrait, by an unknown artist, of Frances, the second wife of the Lord Chancellor Clarendon. (See Lady Theresa Lewis's Lives of the Friends of Lord Chancellor Clarendon, vol. iii. pp. 355, 356. 361.)\n\nMr. Hyde's two marriages are fully described by himself in his Life, vol. i. pp. 12. 15, ed. 8vo. 1761.\n\nThe story of the tubwoman, the grandmother of queens, seems to have been a legend invented for the purpose of exhibiting a contrast between the exalted rank of the descendants and the plebeian origin of the ancestor. Historical fiction and popular fancy delight in such contrasts. The story of date obolum Belisario, and Pope's account of the death of the second Duke of Buckingham, are more celebrated, but not more veracious, than the story of the marriage of Lord Chancellor Clarendon with the tubwoman.\n\nL.\n\nDISCOVERY OF PLANETS.\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 84.)\n\nLeonora says, \"supposing that the recently-discovered planets obey the same laws as the larger ones, they must be at all times apparently moving within the zodiac;\" and she asks for an explanation of the fact of their not having been discovered before.\n\nAncient astronomers having observed that the moon, and the planets visible to them, were never seen at more than a small angular distance north or south from the plane of the earth's orbit, they drew two circles parallel to the ecliptic, at the distance which experience had shown them to be sufficient for comprehending the apparent places of those heavenly bodies at all times; and to the intervening space they gave the name of zodiac. But there is no law of matter, or, in other words, it is no necessary consequence of gravitation or planetary action, which confines the planets' orbits within the zodiac. The fact can only be ascribed to the will of Him who first projected them into their intended paths; though that will had doubtless some wise and calculated end in view.\n\nIt was further observed, in the last century, that the increasing distance of each successive planet {212}from the sun would follow an uniform rule, if there were not one wanting between Mars and Jupiter, to fill up the series. This put astronomers upon the search, and led to the discovery, in 1801, of four small planets, all at nearly the requisite distance, but moving in paths inclined to the ecliptic at such large angles as carry them beyond the zodiac, though they necessarily move across it. From hence it was inferred that they were portions of a planet originally harmonising, in size, position, and orbitual path, with the rest of our system, but burst into fragments by an internal explosion, at some time prior to man's recorded observations of the heavenly bodies. This supposition gains strength from the continued discovery of more and still smaller fragments, each still moving as a planet at nearly the same distance from the sun; and each seeming to proclaim that there was a world, probably larger than our earth, amongst whose inhabitants sin entered, as amongst us; but for whom mercy was not in like manner procured.\n\nAs to the discoverer of a previously unknown planet, your inquirer should be told, that more is necessary than its merely coming within the field of an observer's telescope, even if it attracts his notice. Some years before 1781, the year in which Herschel discovered the planet which should perpetuate his name, Lalande had noted down an observation of a star, of a certain magnitude, in a position where afterwards no such star could be found, but where calculations since made, from the known orbit of that planet, prove that it must then have been. By failing to continue his observation of it, till it should have changed its place amongst the fixed stars, Lalande lost the discovery. And though Herschel's much more powerful telescope enabled him to perceive, on a first inspection, that it had a defined disc, more observations were required to enable him to say that it could not be a comet shorn of his beams: whilst, as to the last discovered planets, I think we have been told that their apparent size is but that of a star of the ninth order, in decreasing magnitude; and no part of the heavens has been so accurately mapped as to give an observer reason to conclude, from catching sight of one of these planetary fragments, that he has detected an obscure wanderer not usually seen in that locality. But if its appearance leads his practised eye to suspect that it shines with but borrowed light, and that induces him to continue his nightly watch, he receives his reward, if it be so, and announces the existence of another planet.\n\nHenry Walter.\n\nSTORY OF GENOVEVA.\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 133.)\n\nThe story of Genoveva is a popular German legend, and is given in No. 8 of the Volksbücher, published at Leipzig, 1838.\n\nGenoveva was a daughter of the Duke of Brabant, and wife of Count Siegfried, of Treves. When Charles Martel was attacked by the Saracens, Siegfried went to his assistance, leaving his wife to the care of his steward Golo. Golo fell in love with Genoveva, and being rejected, resolved to destroy her. To do so, he got up a charge against her of incontinency with the cook, and put both in confinement. On Siegfried's return, Golo convinced him, by the help of a witch and false witnesses, that his wife was guilty, and that the child to which she had given birth in prison was born eleven months after her husband's departure. Siegfried ordered Golo to bring the criminals to justice. He, fearing exposure, had the cook poisoned in gaol, and commissioned two of his servants to take the countess and her boy into a wood and kill them; but, moved by her tears, they left the intended victims, and deceived their master. Genoveva took shelter in a cavern, and lived upon roots; but her milk failing, the child was about to die. She prayed fervently, and a beautiful doe, tame as a domestic cow, came and suckled the child, and returned daily for that purpose for seven years. The passage illustrated in Silurian's picture is as follows:\n\n\"Als die weinende Mutter dies gefleht hatte, sihe, da kam eine Hirschkuh zu ihr, welche sich als ein zahmes Vieh anstellte, und freundlich um sie herstrich; gleichsam, als wollte sie sagen: Gott habe sie dahin gesendet, dass sie das Kindlein ernähren sollte. Die betrübte Mutter erstaunte, und erkannte alsbald die Vorsehung Gottes, legte das Kind an die Zitzen des Wildes, und liess es so lange saugen, bis es wieder Kraft bekam. Durch diese himmlische Wohlthat wurde die liebe Genoveva so sehr erfreut, dass sie mit vielen süssen Thränen den gütigen Gott Dank sagte, und ihn demüthig um Fortsetzung solcher gnädigen Hilfe anflehte.\"—P. 24.\n\nThe story ends happily. Siegfried discovers that his wife is innocent, takes her back, and punishes Golo: but for these matters I refer those who are curious to the book, which is well worth reading. Genoveva died April 2, 750, and the doe pined to death at her grave.\n\nH. B. C.\n\nU. U. Club.\n\nSilurian will find a very beautiful illustration of his engraving by Felsing, after Steinbrück, in the little poem entitled Genoveva, published by Moxon.\n\nV.\n\nGenoveva of Brabant, a tale of old times, translated from the German of Christopher Schmid, published by Burns or Masters, price 2s. 6d. illustrated, will give Silurian the information required; as also will Genoveva, a poem by the Rev. R. C. Trench, London, 1842, Moxon.\n\n†\n\nOakhurst.\n\n{213}\n\nANCIENT DUTCH ALLEGORICAL PICTURE.\n\n(Vol. vi., pp. 457. 590.; Vol. vii., pp. 46. 97.)\n\nMy Query respecting this picture has been answered in the Navorscher by a learned gentleman who writes under the signature of Constanter, in that publication. The editor of the Navorscher has communicated to me the name of this gentleman, and also the following translation of his remarks on my Query, and has also kindly permitted me to make what use of the latter I think fit. I therefore transmit them to you, that you may, if you think the subject of sufficient interest, insert them in your pages.\n\nJas. H. Todd.\n\nTrinity College, Dublin.\n\nDid not the whole arrangement of the picture give me reason to suppose that it must be a kind of symbolical point (figuurlÿk punt), such as the Rhetoricians were wont to show during their solemn processions—the character also of the additional verses, and especially the description of the paintings against the wall of the room, which is represented on the piece, would corroborate this meaning. These pictures, with the arms mentioned as making part of them, point directly at Haarlem as the town whence the painting must have had its origin; for who is not acquainted, albeit only through the title of the Opregte Haarlemsche Courant , with, \"the sword proper, on a red field, between four stars, surmounted by a cross, or?\"\n\nNow, in the seventeenth century there existed at Haarlem three Societies of Rhetoricians. One, the Oude Kamer , erected in 1503, had chosen for its motto, Trou moet blÿcken; and for its symbol, the pelican or speelkoornen; whilst her shield was emblazoned as follows,—in the middle our Saviour crucified, and, behind the cross, Æneas bearing his father. To this Kamer the painting alludes, of which Dr. James H. Todd says, \"That nearest the fire-place is oval, representing the crucifixion. There is a white scroll across the picture, containing words which I cannot make out.\" Had the sentence not been obliterated, the querist would have read, Trou moet blÿcken. The second allegory, with illegible subscription, cannot be anything but the ensign of the so-called Jonge Kamer at Haarlem, de Wÿngaertrancken, with the symbol, Liefde boven al (Love above all). I presume this on account of the framework of the painting, ornamented on each side with bunches of red grapes (vine-branches) dependent from below. These bunches have been figured in the identical way on a scutcheon of the same Kamer, which is still preserved in the council-hall of Beverwÿk: there also we see, to the right, a female statue representing Faith; and, on the upper part, in the middle, another with a burning heart in her hand, and two (not three) children at her side, representing Charity, who thus has been placed above all the rest, conformably to the motto of the Society. But, in lieu of the third child, stands immediately under her on the Beverwÿk blazon another woman, Rhetorica; and to the left, instead of the man with the hawk (?), another female representing Hope, and completing, in this manner, the Christian trilogy (1 Cor. xiii. 13.). Besides, in the middle compartment, not John Baptist but our Lord is seen, standing as victor over Hell, in which Satan is conspicuous. However, notwithstanding these deviations, I think the resemblance too striking not to consider the painting on the wall as the ensign of the Jonge Kamer. The third or last picture, representing the marriage of Christ with the Church, is the well-known blazon of the third Rederÿkerkamer at Haarlem, surnamed de Flaamsche (the Flemish), which bore the Witte Angieren (white stock-flowers, not lilies), with the motto, In liefd getrouw. This shield too is still preserved in the town-hall at Beverwÿk.\n\nThus, the three Haarlem Societies of Rhetoricians are represented by their shields in the room designed; nay, if I am not mistaken, the painter has given us a delineation of their meeting-place. This appears: 1. By the statue in the niche, Rhetorica. 2. By the two cup-boards, one of which contains the prizes, carried by the Kamers at various entries and processions; to wit, silver and gold cups, flagons, and dishes: whilst in the other, its books are deposited. 3. By the table under the window, well to be distinguished from that around which the guests are seated, and used by the Rhetoricians as a movable stage, on which to rehearse their plays (whence Willems and Mone derive the name of tafelspel [table-play]). 5. By the broad roller under the pictures, that occupies the space, where otherwise was commonly hung the Keur (statutes) of the Kamer. This last inscription, connected with what is to be read over the fire-place, fully explains the meaning of the whole picture. The lines censure the disputes regarding the dogmata of religion, because every body thinks his conviction the best one; many controversies being carried on \"Wanneer het volck is vol\" (whilst people are full), by incompetent and illiberal critics, and these contentions alienating their hearts from Charity, the chief commandment of Christ. In a word, the painting is the faithful representation of what the Haarlem Rhetorician, Dirk Volkerts Coornhert, professed {214}and advocated in his writings. Still the piece belongs to a later period, perhaps between the years 1618 and 1630, when the disputes with Remonstrants, Socinians, and Kooledsjanten (Collegianten, collegians, sectarians of the van der Kodde's) had reached their highest point. It is known that the Rhetoricians frequently meddled with these contending parties, to the great displeasure of the Synods, which more than once contrived to elicit severe measures from the magistrates against them. How far the Haarlem Societies made themselves justly liable to such interferences, I have not been able to discover; but it might be ascertained by means of one or other of their works published about that time, as, Der Wit-Angieren Eerenkrans: ghesproten nyt de Flaemsche Natie, ter eeren der Slaghet van Rederÿcke tot Haerlem, 1630, 4to, or the Refereinen en Liedekens van't Hemelert, 1648.\n\nThe verses, excepting the last but one, which is sorely maimed, are easily to be explained. Whether the figures be portraits, I cannot decide without ocular inspection of the painting.\n\nConstanter.\n\nAmsterdam.\n\nThis reply was written before the publication of your last notices (\"N. & Q.,\" Vol. vii., pp. 46. and 97.). The verses you mentioned in the last-named part are, in English, \"Here one must guess To wash glasses And to p—s in them Would not be fit.\" I entirely agree with the poet.\n\nCould you not acquaint me with the length, breadth, and height of the picture, and with the painter's name?\n\nTHE \"PERCY ANECDOTES.\"\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 134.)\n\nI have much pleasure in replying to the inquiries of Uneda. The Percy Anecdotes, published in forty-four parts, in as many months, commencing in 1820, were compiled by \"Sholto and Reuben Percy, Brothers of the Benedictine Monastery of Mont Benger.\" So said the title-pages, but the names and the locality were supposé. Reuben Percy was Mr. Thomas Byerley, who died in 1824: he was the brother of Sir John Byerley, and the first editor of the Mirror, commenced by John Limbird in 1822. Sholto Percy was Mr. Joseph Clinton Robertson, who died in 1852: he was the projector of the Mechanics' Magazine, which he edited from its commencement to his death. The name of the collection of Anecdotes was not taken from the popularity of the Percy Reliques, but from the Percy Coffee-house in Rathbone Place, where Byerley and Robertson were accustomed to meet to talk over their joint work. The idea was, however, claimed by my clever master and friend, Sir Richard Phillips, who stoutly maintained that it originated in a suggestion made by him to Dr. Tilloch and Mr. Mayne, to cut the anecdotes from the many years' files of the Star newspaper, of which Dr. Tilloch was then editor, and Mr. Byerley assistant editor; and to the latter overhearing the suggestion, Sir Richard contested, might the Percy Anecdotes be traced. I have not the means of ascertaining whether Sir Richard's claim is correct; and I should be equally sorry to reflect upon his statement as upon that of Mr. Byerley, my predecessor in the editorship of the Mirror. The Percy Anecdotes were among the best compilations of their day: their publisher, Mr. Thomas Boys, of Ludgate Hill, realised a large sum by the work; and no inconsiderable portion of their success must be referred to Mr. Boys's excellent taste in their production: the portrait illustrations, mostly engraved by Fry, were admirable.\n\nJohn Timbs.\n\nLADY NEVILL'S MUSIC-BOOK: MODE OF READING THE ANCIENT VIRGINAL MUSIC.\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 59.)\n\nThe index to Lady Nevill's Music-book, printed by your correspondent L. B. L., was made known to the public in 1789, in the third volume of Dr. Burney's History of Music. In addition to the information given in \"N. & Q.,\" the doctor adds:\n\n\"Besides the great number of Bird's compositions for keyed instruments, which are preserved in the Virginal book of Queen Elizabeth (now in the Fitzwilliam Museum), another manuscript collection of his pieces still subsists, under the title of Lady Nevil's Music-book. It is a thick quarto, very splendidly bound and gilt, with the family arms beautifully emblazoned and illuminated on the first page, and the initials H. N. at the lowest left-hand corner.\"—P. 91.\n\nThe MS. in question was the property of Dr. Burney, at whose sale, in 1814, it was purchased for 10l. 10s. by Mr. Thomas Jones, of Nottingham Place. At the sale of the latter, about ten years afterwards, it was bought by Triphook, the bookseller, and by him sold to Lord Abergavenny. I remember seeing the book when in Triphook's possession, since which time I had lost sight of it, until the notice by L. B. L. in your pages.\n\nMr. Thomas Jones was a well-known musical antiquary, and possessed many rare treasures in this department. One of the most important was the original MS. of Lady Nevill's Music-book, in the handwriting of William Byrd the composer. This valuable relic is now in my library.\n\nJohn Baldwine, the person who made the splendid copy for the use of Lady Nevill, was a singular character. I have some materials for his biography which may one day see the light. He was a poet in his own time, and wrote a metrical {215}account of famous musicians. The latter part, which I extract from the MS. now before me, relates to the composer of Lady Nevill's Music-book:\n\nAs regards the ancient notation of Lady Nevill's Music-book, I will now say a few words.\n\nIn the most ancient music for keyed instruments, such as the organ, virginals, harpsichord, spinet, &c., a staff consisting of eleven lines was used, that is, five lines for the treble, and five lines for the bass, and a centre line, being the note C. This was improved upon by dividing the staff into two sixes, and repeating the C line twice over, viz. in the lower part of the treble staff, and in upper part of the bass staff. As music progressed, and performers required more scope for the movement of the hands, the staff of twelve lines was rent asunder, and the middle C line excluded altogether. It then became the custom to print the five upper lines and the five lower lines much more widely apart, as is now done in modern music. But it ought not to be forgotten that there is only one line really between them; that is to say, there are only three notes between the two sets of five lines, viz. the note below the upper five, the note above the lower five, and the note on that middle line, and that note is middle C, or, more properly, tenor C. A knowledge of this important fact would much facilitate the student in learning to read in the tenor cleff.\n\nIn decyphering the old virginal music, all we have to do is to leave out the lower line of the upper staff, and the higher one of the lower staff. It then reads like our modern music.\n\nEdward F. Rimbault.\n\nSCARFS WORN BY CLERGYMEN.\n\n(Vol. vii., p. 143.)\n\nThe statement made in the Quarterly Review for June, 1851, p. 222., referred to in \"N. & Q.,\" is very inadequate. The scarf now worn by many clergymen represents two ornaments very different, though now generally confounded, viz. the broad and the narrow scarf. I can well remember, in my boyhood, hearing mention made of the distinction between the broad and narrow scarf, then customarily observed by many; and this at a time when the res vestiaria, and matters connected with the ritual, had not become objects of public attention. The broad scarf was the distinction (of what standing I cannot pretend to say) used by chaplains of the king, and of privileged persons, by doctors in divinity, and by the capitular members of collegiate churches. It was worn with the surplice and gown; and, by doctors in divinity only, with the scarlet academical robe. The narrow scarf has been immemorially used by clergymen, whether priests or deacons, in many large towns, and by the clergy in some cathedrals, and not unfrequently by country clergymen. By custom, those who serve, or have served, the office of junior dean in Trinity College, Dublin, wear a scarf. In fact, it represents the stole, or that ornament (under whatever various names it was known) which, all through Christendom, had been a badge of the three orders of bishop, priest, and deacon. In the Church of England, however, none of those variations in its mode of arrangement, which elsewhere discriminates these three orders, have been retained. Is there any proof that it has not been used ever since the Reformation? And may not its very frequent disuse within memory {216}be attributable to that well-known slovenliness in ritual matters which was but too characteristic of the last century?\n\nJohn Jebb.\n\nPeterstow Rectory, Ross.\n\nUNANSWERED QUERIES REGARDING SHAKSPEARE.\n\nDomestic anxieties having unavoidably detained me in this place during the last three or four months, I am necessarily without nearly all my books. My corrected folio, 1632, is one of the very few exceptions; and as I have not the No. of \"N. & Q.\" to which A. E. B. refers, I am unable to reply to his question, simply because I do not remember it.\n\nTo whomsoever these initials belong, he is a man of so much acuteness and learning, that, although I may deem his conjectures rather subtle and ingenious than solid and expedient, I consider him entitled to all the information in my power. I do not, of course, feel bound to notice all anonymous speculators (literary or pecuniary); but if A. E. B. will be good enough to take the trouble to repeat his interrogatory, I promise him to answer it at once.\n\nMy recent volume was put together with some rapidity, and under many disadvantages: not a few of the later sheets were corrected, and several of them written, two hundred miles from home. Such was the case with the note on the suggestion I hastily attributed to Mr. Cornish, on the faith of his letter in \"N. & Q.\" I did not advert to the circumstance that Warburton had proposed the same emendation; and it may turn out that a few other notes by me are in the same predicament. The authority I usually consulted as to the conjectures of previous editors was the Variorum Shakspeare, in twenty-one volumes 8vo.\n\nI need hardly add that I was acquainted with the fact that Mr. Singer had published an edition of Shakspeare; but, like some others, it was not before me when I wrote my recent volume, nor when I printed the eight volumes to which that is a supplement. Even the British Museum does not contain all the impressions of the works of our great dramatist; but I resorted, more or less, to twenty or thirty of them in the progress of my undertaking.\n\nMr. Singer's edition, no doubt, deserves more than the praise he has given to it: on the other hand, I am thoroughly sensible of the imperfectness of my own labours, however anxious I was to avoid mistakes; and when I prepare a new impression, I will not fail duly to acknowledge the obligations of Shakspeare to Mr. Singer. One of my notes on a celebrated passage in Timon of Athens will have shown that there was no reluctance on my part to give Mr. Singer full credit for a very happy emendation.\n\nI hope and believe that he does not participate in the anger some have expressed, because I have been merely the medium of making known other emendations at least equally felicitous.\n\nJ.

The term is variously corrupted by the English poets and dramatists,—passy-measure, passa-measure, passing-measure, &c. Douce, in his valuable Illustrations of Shakspeare (edit. 1839, p. 72.), has the following passage on the subject:\n\n\"Florio, in his Italian Dictionary, 1598, has passamezzo, a passameasure in dancing, a cinque pace; and although the English word is corrupt, the other contributes a part, at least, of the figure of this dance, which is said to have consisted in making several steps round the ball-room, and then crossing it in the middle. Brantôme calls it 'le pazzameno d'Italie,' and it appears to have been more particularly used by the Venetians. It was much in vogue with us during Shakspeare's time, as well as the pavan; and both were imported either from France, Spain, or Italy. In a book of instructions for the lute, translated from the French by J. Alford, 1568, 4to., there are two passameze tunes printed in letters according to the lute notation.\"\n\nThe passamezzo was sometimes sung as well as danced. Morley, in his Introduction to Practicall Musicke, 1597, has an interesting passage bearing on the point, which has been overlooked by modern writers:\n\n\"There is likewise a kind of songs (which I had almost forgotten) called Justinianas, and are all written in the Bergamasca language. A wanton and rude kinde of musicke it is, and like enough to carrie the name of some notable curtisan of the citie of Bergama; for no man will deny that Justiniana is the name of a woman. There be also manie other kinds of songs which the Italians make; as pastorellas and passamesos, with a dittie, and such like, which it would be both tedious and superfluous to dilate unto you in words; therefore I will leave to speak any more of them, and begin to declare unto you those kinds which they make without ditties.\"\n\nMr. Forbes asks, \"Is the tune of the galliard known?\" I know at least a hundred different galliard tunes. They are distinguished by appellations which seem to indicate their being the {217}favourites of particular persons, as in these instances:—\"The King of Denmark's Galliard,\" \"The Earl of Essex's Galliard,\" \"Sir John Souch his Galliard,\" \"Sir Henry Noell his Galliard,\" &c.—See Douland's Lachrymæ, or Seaven Tears, 1603.\n\nThe galliard is a lively air in triple time: Brossard intimates that it is the same with the Romanesca, a favourite dance with the Italians. It is graphically described in Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy:\n\n\"Let them take their pleasures, young men and maides flourishing in their age, fair and lovely to behold, well attired, and of comely carriage, dauncing a Greek galliarde, and, as their dance required, kept their time, now turning, now tracing, now apart, now altogether, now a curtesie, then a caper, &c., that it was a pleasant sight.\"\n\nChristopher Sympson, in his Compendium of Practical Musick (ed. 1678, p. 116.), says:\n\n\"A pavan doth commonly consist of three strains, each strain to be play'd twice over.... Next in course after a pavan follows a galliard, consisting sometimes of two, and sometimes of three strains.\"\n\nSpecimens of the passamezzo pavan and galliard may be found in Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book, in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge. One is dated 1592. Others may be found in the Public Library, Cambridge (MS. marked \"D. d. 3, 18.\") Also in two rare printed books,—Robinson's School of Musick, fol. 1603; and Neder-landtsche Gedenck-clanck, Haerlem, 1626. The latter work contains the \"Passamezzo d'Anvers.\"\n\nEdward F. Rimbault.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.\n\nThe Albumen Process.—In answer to Mr. Lawrence's Queries regarding the albumen process (in Vol. vii., p. 116.), I think I can supply him with the information he requires.\n\nThe albumen should be placed in a cup, or some wide-mouthed vessel, and, after carefully removing from its surface every trace of air-bubbles, it is to be poured carefully on the plate, and after being flooded over the surface of it, the plate being tilted on one side, the greater portion of the albumen may be run off into the cup again. The plate must not be held sideways, however, for more than an instant; and it must be brought as soon as possible into the horizontal position, face downwards, between the points of the wire support, as used by Messrs. Ross and Thompson; and being held by the cord attached to the wire support, it must be given a slow rotary motion. The rate at which to cause it to rotate must be a matter of experience, but must be such as to keep the surface of albumen even, and neither to let it settle in the centre, nor to leave that and pass completely to the edges; neither must too much of it be allowed to flow off, as then the coating will not be thick enough. The best plan is to fix on the wire support at the corner of the plate, and then pour on the albumen, and then no time need be lost between pouring off and giving the rotary motion. The albumen will keep some time in a bottle; but as soon as it begins to get curdy and opalescent, it begins to lose in sensitiveness. The plate, if well prepared, will remain sensitive and in good order for two days at least, and being kept in a dry and cool place is a great assistance to its preservation. The addition of about five drops of saturated solution of bromide of potassium to every ounce of previously-iodized albumen causes great depth and brilliancy in the negative. The same sensitive bath answers over and over again, as with collodion. The time of exposure cannot be specified, as that varies almost indefinitely from ten minutes to an hour and a half.\n\nIn regard to obtaining a greater sensitiveness, the addition of starch size in the place of the water to the albumen appears to increase it, and certainly gives great improvement in depth of the blacks. A very good way of beating up the albumen is as follows:—Take a round stick, and having cut several slits in it, from the bottom half-way up it, insert into these several pieces of quill, so that they may project on each side of the stick to the length of about half an inch or a little more, and tie up the bottom of the stick with some string wound round it to keep the quills in place. Take then the albumen, iodized as directed by Thornthwaite or any other successful manipulator, and place it in a tall cylindrical glass vessel; and taking the whisk as above prepared between the palms of the hands, roll it backwards and forwards, keeping the part armed with the quills immersed in the albumen. This is the most effective method I know, and much less tiring than the old method with the common whisk.\n\nIn answer to another Querist, I have only to reply that the black tints in the French positives are due to the presence of starch, used as a size for the paper. I have lately succeeded in producing several very beautiful and brilliant effects of this kind by passing the paper—French or English, it does not much matter which—first over a size of starch, and next (after being dried) over a combination of albumen and thin starch size, composed of equal parts of each, to which, according to the process of M. Le Gray, may be added one-fifth of a saturated solution of chloride of ammonium. This is only an improvement in the process as described by M. Le Gray, and the rest of the process will be found in his own book, or in Thornthwaite's Guide.\n\nF. M. L.\n\nTorquay.\n\nQueries on Mr. Weld Taylor's Process.—I hope Mr. Weld Taylor will not withhold (from those {218}who would most thankfully acknowledge the favour) an amended description of his paper process, embracing replies to the following Queries:\n\n1. How strong should the cyanide solution be that is to be added \"drop by drop;\" and how much of it is likely to redissolve the precipitate formed by the first mixture?\n\n2. Should the paper be brushed with, floated on, or immersed in the solution? If either of the latter, for how long a time; and what then?\n\n3. How is the bath of nitrate of silver prepared, and the mode of applying it to the paper?\n\n4. How much sulphuric acid is added to a given quantity of water, in which the paper is placed after removal from the exciting bath; and is it immersed or floated?\n\n5. Is the paper, when removed from the water, to be partially dried with blotting-paper, and used in its damp state? or will it keep, and how long?\n\n6. What is the probable time of exposure in the camera?\n\n7. How is the picture developed? and, finally, how fixed?\n\nJohn James.\n\nDifficulties in the Wax-paper Process.—Can any of your photographic correspondents give me some hints regarding the following difficulties, which I (in common with many other amateurs) have met with in working according to Le Gray's wax-paper process?\n\nThe proportions I used were exactly those published by Le Gray, and the paper and other materials were of the description he recommends; but nearly every picture, on being placed in the gallic acid, was spoiled, by the appearance of numerous small black spots, all well defined on one and the same side, but comparatively undefined on the other. These may possibly have been owing to iron in the paper, and may therefore, perhaps, be obviated by following the method of Mr. Crookes. But I am anxious to learn if others have experienced these spots in their pictures, and to what they attribute them, as well as how they can best be prevented.\n\nMy second difficulty was in the want of intensity in the pictures, which completely prevented my obtaining even a tolerable impression from them. I tried many different times of exposure, and even after working long with Le Gray's slightly-different proportions, but always without success. The margin of the pictures, however, which had been exposed to the daylight, always became of the most intense black, after the picture had been developed.\n\nBut my third difficulty was the most annoying of all, because the constant source of failure, though in itself apparently the most easily obviated. It was the difficulty of keeping the dishes which contained the solution clean; the effect of this want of cleanliness being the marbling of the pictures whenever placed in the gallic acid and aceto-nitrate of silver. This is a difficulty I never before encountered, during half a dozen years' practice of photography (during which I used to be as successful as most of my brother amateurs); and though I tried every plan I could think of to insure cleanliness, such as washing the dishes with warm water, nitric and muriatic acids, &c., and afterwards wiping them thoroughly with clean cloths, still the mixture of gallic acid and aceto-nitrate of silver, for developing the picture, brought out some marblings or blotches on the dish, which were invariably communicated to the picture, even though it was only floated on the surface of the solution, and prevented, with the greatest care"
