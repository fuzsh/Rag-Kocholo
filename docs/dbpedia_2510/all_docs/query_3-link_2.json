Throughout this period—nearly half of the Psalmistâs âdays of our yearsâ—I have been blessed with health and strength to produce these volumes, year by year (with one exception), upon the appointed day; and this with unbroken attention to periodical duties, frequently rendered harassing or ungenial. Nevertheless, during these three decades I have found my account in the increasing approbation of the reading public, which has been so largely extended to the series of âThings not generally Known,â of which the present volume of âCuriosities of Scienceâ is an instalment. I need scarcely add, that in its progressive preparation I have endeavoured to compare, weigh, and consider, the contents, so as to combine the experience of the Past with the advantages of the Present.\n\nIn these days of universal attainments, when Science becomes not merely a luxury to the rich, but bread to the poor, and when the very amusements as well as the conveniences of life have taken a scientific colour, it is reasonable to hope that the present volume may be acceptable to a large class of seekers after âthings not generally known.â For this purpose, I have aimed at soundness as well as popularity; although, for myself, I can claim little beyond being one of those industrious âants of scienceâ who garner facts, and by selection and comparison adapt them for a wider circle of readers than they were originally expected to reach. In each case, as far as possible, these âCuriositiesâ bear the mint-mark of authority; and in the living list are prominent the names of Humboldt and Herschel, Airy and Whewell, Faraday, Brewster, Owen, and Agassiz, Maury, Wheatstone, and Hunt, from whose writings and researches the following pages are frequently enriched.\n\nThe sciences here illustrated are, in the main, Astronomy and Meteorology; Geology and Paleontology; Physical Geography; Sound, Light, and Heat; Magnetism and Electricity,—the latter with special attention to the great marvel of our times, the Electro-magnetic Telegraph. I hope, at no very distant period, to extend the âCuriositiesâ to another volume, to include branches of Natural and Experimental Science which are not here presented.\n\nI. T.\n\nNovember 1858.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nÂ PAGE Introductory 1–10 Physical Phenomena 11–26 Sound and Light 27–53 Astronomy 54–103 Geology and Paleontology 104–145 Meteorological Phenomena 146–169 Physical Geography of the Sea 170–192 Magnetism and Electricity 193–219 The Electric Telegraph 220–228 Miscellanea 229–241\n\nvii\n\nThe Frontispiece.\n\nTHE GREAT ROSSE TELESCOPE.\n\nThe originator and architect of this magnificent instrument had long been distinguished in scientific research as Lord Oxmantown; and may be considered to have gracefully commemorated his succession to the Earldom of Rosse, and his Presidency of the Royal Society, by the completion of this marvellous work, with which his name will be hereafter indissolubly associated.\n\nThe Great Reflecting Telescope at Birr Castle (of which the Frontispiece represents a portion1) will be found fully described at pp. 96–99 of the present volume of Curiosities of Science.\n\nThis matchless instrument has already disclosed âforms of stellar arrangement indicating modes of dynamic action never before contemplated in celestial mechanics.â âIn these departments of research,—the examination of the configurations of nebulÃ¦, and the resolution of nebulÃ¦ into stars (says the Rev. Dr. Scoresby),—the six-feet speculum has had its grandest triumphs, and the noble artificer and observer the highest rewards of his talents and enterprise. Altogether, the quantity of work done during a period of about seven years—including a winter when a noble philanthropy for a starving population absorbed the keenest interests of science—has been decidedly great; and the new knowledge acquired concerning the handiwork of the great Creator amply satisfying of even sanguine expectation.â\n\nThe Vignette.\n\nSIR HUMPHRY DAVYâS OWN MODEL OF HIS SAFETY-LAMP.\n\nOf the several contrivances which have been proposed for safely lighting coal-mines subject to the visitation of fire-damp, or carburetted hydrogen, the Safety-Lamp of Sir Humphry Davy is the only one which has ever been judged safe, and been extensively employed. The inventor first turned his attention to the subject in 1815, when Davy began a minute chemical examination of fire-damp, and found that it required an admixture of a large quantity of atmospheric air to render it explosive. He then ascertained that explosions of inflammable gases were incapable of being passed through long narrow metallic tubes, and that this principle of security was still obtained by diminishing their length and increasing their number. This fact led to trials upon sieves made of wire-gauze; when Davy found that if a piece of wire-gauze was held over the flame of a lamp, or of coal-gas, it prevented the flame from passing; and he ascertained that a flame confined in a cylinder of very fine wire-gauze did not explode even in a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, but that the gases burnt in it with great vivacity.\n\nThese experiments served as the basis of the Safety-Lamp. The apertures in the gauze, Davy tells us in his work on the subject, should not be more than 1/22d of an inch square. The lamp is screwed on to the bottom of the wire-gauze cylinder. When it is lighted, and gradually introduced into an atmosphere mixed with fire-damp, the size and length of the flame are first increased. When the inflammable gas forms as much as 1/12th of the volume of air, the cylinder becomes filled with a feeble blue flame, within which the flame of the wick burns brightly, and the light of the wick continues till the fire-damp increases to 1/6th or 1/5th;viii it is then lost in the flame of the fire-damp, which now fills the cylinder with a pretty strong light; and when the foul air constitutes one-third of the atmosphere it is no longer fit for respiration,—and this ought to be a signal to the miner to leave that part of the workings.\n\nSir Humphry Davy presented his first communication respecting his discovery of the Safety-Lamp to the Royal Society in 1815. This was followed by a series of papers remarkable for their simplicity and clearness, crowned by that read on the 11th of January 1816, when the principle of the Safety-Lamp was announced, and Sir Humphry presented to the Society a model made by his own hands, which is to this day preserved in the collection of the Royal Society at Burlington House. From this interesting memorial the Vignette has been sketched.\n\nThere have been several modifications of the Safety-Lamp, and the merit of the discovery has been claimed by others, among whom was Mr. George Stephenson; but the question was set at rest forty-one years since by an examination,—attested by Sir Joseph Banks, P.R.S., Mr. Brande, Mr. Hatchett, and Dr. Wollaston,—and awarding the independent merit to Davy.\n\nA more substantial, though not a more honourable, testimony of approval was given by the coal-owners, who subscribed 2500l. to purchase a superb service of plate, which was suitably inscribed and presented to Davy.2\n\nMeanwhile the Report by the Parliamentary Committee âcannot admit that the experiments (made with the Lamp) have any tendency to detract from the character of Sir Humphry Davy, or to disparage the fair value placed by himself upon his invention. The improvements are probably those which longer life and additional facts would have induced him to contemplate as desirable, and of which, had he not been the inventor, he might have become the patron.â\n\nThe principle of the invention may be thus summed up. In the Safety-Lamp, the mixture of the fire-damp and atmospheric air within the cage of wire-gauze explodes upon coming in contact with the flame; but the combustion cannot pass through the wire-gauze, and being there imprisoned, cannot impart to the explosive atmosphere of the mine any of its force. This effect has been erroneously attributed to a cooling influence of the metal.\n\nProfessor Playfair has eloquently described the Safety-Lamp of Davy as a present from philosophy to the arts; a discovery in no degree the effect of accident or chance, but the result of patient and enlightened research, and strongly exemplifying the great use of an immediate and constant appeal to experiment. After characterising the invention as the shutting-up in a net of the most slender texture a most violent and irresistible force, and a power that in its tremendous effects seems to emulate the lightning and the earthquake, Professor Playfair thus concludes: âWhen to this we add the beneficial consequences, and the saving of the lives of men, and consider that the effects are to remain as long as coal continues to be dug from the bowels of the earth, it may be fairly said that there is hardly in the whole compass of art or science a single invention of which one would rather wish to be the author.... This,â says Professor Playfair, âis exactly such a case as we should choose to place before Bacon, were he to revisit the earth; in order to give him, in a small compass, an idea of the advancement which philosophy has made since the time when he had pointed out to her the route which she ought to pursue.â\n\n1\n\nCURIOSITIES OF SCIENCE.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nSCIENCE OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.\n\nIn every province of human knowledge where we now possess a careful and coherent interpretation of nature, men began by attempting in bold flights to leap from obvious facts to the highest point of generality—to some wide and simple principle which after-ages had to reject. Thus, from the facts that all bodies are hot or cold, moist or dry, they leapt at once to the doctrine that the world is constituted of four elements—earth, air, fire, water; from the fact that the heavenly bodies circle the sky in courses which occur again and again, they at once asserted that they move in exact circles, with an exactly uniform motion; from the fact that heavy bodies fall through the air somewhat faster than light ones, it was assumed that all bodies fall quickly or slowly exactly in proportion to their weight; from the fact that the magnet attracts iron, and that this force of attraction is capable of increase, it was inferred that a perfect magnet would have an irresistible force of attraction, and that the magnetic pole of the earth would draw the nails out of a shipâs bottom which came near it; from the fact that some of the finest quartz crystals are found among the snows of the Alps, it was inferred that the crystallisation of gems is the result of intense and long-continued cold: and so on in innumerable instances. Such anticipations as these constituted the basis of almost all the science of the ancient world; for such principles being so assumed, consequences were drawn from them with great ingenuity, and systems of such deductions stood in the place of science.—Edinburgh Review, No. 216.\n\nSCIENCE AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.\n\nThe earliest science of a decidedly English school is due, for the most part, to the University of Oxford, and specially to Merton College,—a foundation of which Wood remarks, that2 there was no other for two centuries, either in Oxford or Paris, which could at all come near it in the cultivation of the sciences. But he goes on to say that large chests full of the writers of this college were allowed to remain untouched by their successors for fear of the magic which was supposed to be contained in them. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to trace the liberalising effect of scientific study upon the University in general, and Merton College in particular; and it must be remembered that to the cultivation of the mind at Oxford we owe almost all the literary celebrity of the middle ages. In this period the University of Cambridge appears to have acquired no scientific distinction. Taking as a test the acquisition of celebrity on the continent, we find that Bacon, Sacrobosco, Greathead, Estwood, &c. were all of Oxford. The latter University had its morning of splendour while Cambridge was comparatively unknown; it had also its noonday, illustrated by such men as Briggs, Wren, Wallis, Halley, and Bradley.\n\nThe age of science at Cambridge may be said to have begun with Francis Bacon; and but that we think much of the difference between him and his celebrated namesake lies more in time and circumstances than in talents or feelings, we would rather date from 1600 with the former than from 1250 with the latter. Praise or blame on either side is out of the question, seeing that the earlier foundation of Oxford, and its superiority in pecuniary means, rendered all that took place highly probable; and we are in a great measure indebted for the liberty of writing our thoughts, to the cultivation of the liberalising sciences at Oxford in the dark ages.\n\nWith regard to the University of Cambridge, for a long time there hardly existed the materials of any proper instruction, even to the extent of pointing out what books should be read by a student desirous of cultivating astronomy.\n\nPLATOâS SURVEY OF THE SCIENCES.\n\nPlato, like Francis Bacon, took a review of the sciences of his time: he enumerates arithmetic and plane geometry, treated as collections of abstract and permanent truths; solid geometry, which he ânotes as deficientâ in his time, although in fact he and his school were in possession of the doctrine of the âfive regular solids;â astronomy, in which he demands a science which should be elevated above the mere knowledge of phenomena. The visible appearances of the heavens only suggest the problems with which true astronomy deals; as beautiful geometrical diagrams do not prove, but only suggest geometrical propositions. Finally, Plato notices the subject of harmonics, in which he requires a science which shall deal with truths more exact than the ear can establish, as in astronomy he requires truths more exact than the eye can assure us of.\n\nIn a subsequent paper Plato speaks of Dialectic as a still higher3 element of a philosophical education, fitted to lead men to the knowledge of real existences and of the supreme good. Here he describes dialectic by its objects and purpose. In other places dialectic is spoken of as a method or process of analysis; as in the PhÃ¦drus, where Socrates describes a good dialectician as one who can divide a subject according to its natural members, and not miss the joint, like a bad carver. Xenophon says that Socrates derived dialectic from a term implying to divide a subject into parts, which Mr. Grote thinks unsatisfactory as an etymology, but which has indicated a practical connection in the Socratic school. The result seems to be that Plato did not establish any method of analysis of a subject as his dialectic; but he conceived that the analytical habits formed by the comprehensive study of the exact sciences, and sharpened by the practice of dialogue, would lead his students to the knowledge of first principles.—Dr. Whewell.\n\nFOLLY OF ATHEISM.\n\nMorphology, in natural science, teaches us that the whole animal and vegetable creation is formed upon certain fundamental types and patterns, which can be traced under various modifications and transformations through all the rich variety of things apparently of most dissimilar build. But here and there a scientific person takes it into his foolish head that there may be a set of moulds without a moulder, a calculated gradation of forms without a calculator, an ordered world without an ordering God. Now, this atheistical science conveys about as much meaning as suicidal life: for science is possible only where there are ideas, and ideas are only possible where there is mind, and minds are the offspring of God; and atheism itself is not merely ignorance and stupidity,—it is the purely nonsensical and the unintelligible.—Professor Blackie; Edinburgh Essays, 1856.\n\nTHE ART OF OBSERVATION.\n\nTo observe properly in the very simplest of the physical sciences requires a long and severe training. No one knows this so feelingly as the great discoverer. Faraday once said, that he always doubts his own observations. Mitscherlich on one occasion remarked to a man of science that it takes fourteen years to discover and establish a single new fact in chemistry. An enthusiastic student one day betook himself to Baron Cuvier with the exhibition of a new organ—a muscle which he supposed himself to have discovered in the body of some living creature or other; but the experienced and sagacious naturalist kindly bade the young man return to him with the same discovery in six months. The Baron would not even listen to the studentâs demonstration, nor examine his dissection, till the eager and youthful discoverer had hung over the object of inquiry for half a year; and yet that object was a mere thing of the senses.—North-British Review, No. 18.\n\n4\n\nMUTUAL RELATIONS OF PHENOMENA.\n\nIn the observation of a phenomenon which at first sight appears to be wholly isolated, how often may be concealed the germ of a great discovery! Thus, when Galvani first stimulated the nervous fibre of the frog by the accidental contact of two heterogeneous metals, his contemporaries could never have anticipated that the action of the voltaic pile would discover to us in the alkalies metals of a silver lustre, so light as to swim on water, and eminently inflammable; or that it would become a powerful instrument of chemical analysis, and at the same time a thermoscope and a magnet. When Huyghens first observed, in 1678, the phenomenon of the polarisation of light, exhibited in the difference between two rays into which a pencil of light divides itself in passing through a doubly refracting crystal, it could not have been foreseen that a century and a half later the great philosopher Arago would, by his discovery of chromatic polarisation, be led to discern, by means of a small fragment of Iceland spar, whether solar light emanates from a solid body or a gaseous covering; or whether comets transmit light directly, or merely by reflection.—Humboldtâs Cosmos, vol. i.\n\nPRACTICAL RESULTS OF THEORETICAL SCIENCE.\n\nWhat are the great wonders, the great sources of manâs material strength, wealth, and comfort in modern times? The Railway, with its mile-long trains of men and merchandise, moving with the velocity of the wind, and darting over chasms a thousand feet wide; the Electric Telegraph, along which manâs thoughts travel with the velocity of light, and girdle the earth more quickly than Puckâs promise to his master; the contrivance by which the Magnet, in the very middle of a strip of iron, is still true to the distant pole, and remains a faithful guide to the mariner; the Electrotype process, by which a metallic model of any given object, unerringly exact, grows into being like a flower. Now, all these wonders are the result of recent and profound discoveries in theoretical science. The Locomotive Steam-engine, and the Steam-engine in all its other wonderful and invaluable applications, derives its efficacy from the discoveries, by Watt and others, of the laws of steam. The Railway Bridge is not made strong by mere accumulation of materials, but by the most exact and careful scientific examination of the means of giving the requisite strength to every part, as in the great example of Mr. Stephensonâs Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait. The Correction of the Magnetic Needle in iron ships it would have been impossible for Mr. Airy to secure without a complete theoretical knowledge of5 the laws of Magnetism. The Electric Telegraph and the Electrotype process include in their principles and mechanism the most complete and subtle results of electrical and magnetical theory.—Edinburgh Review, No. 216.\n\nPERPETUITY OF IMPROVEMENT.\n\nIn the progress of society all great and real improvements are perpetuated: the same corn which, four thousand years ago, was raised from an improved grass by an inventor worshiped for two thousand years in the ancient world under the name of Ceres, still forms the principal food of mankind; and the potato, perhaps the greatest benefit that the old has derived from the new world, is spreading over Europe, and will continue to nourish an extensive population when the name of the race by whom it was first cultivated in South America is forgotten.—Sir H. Davy.\n\nTHE EARLIEST ENGLISH SCIENTIFIC TREATISE.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, the poet, wrote a treatise on the Astrolabe for his son, which is the earliest English treatise we have met with on any scientific subject. It was not completed; and the apologies which Chaucer makes to his own child for writing in English are curious; while his inference that his son should therefore âpray God save the king that is lord of this language,â is at least as loyal as logical.\n\nPHILOSOPHERSâ FALSE ESTIMATES OF THEIR OWN LABOURS.\n\nGalileo was confident that the most important part of his contributions to the knowledge of the solar system was his Theory of the Tides—a theory which all succeeding astronomers have rejected as utterly baseless and untenable. Descartes probably placed far above his beautiful explanation of the rainbow, his Ã priori theory of the existence of the vortices which caused the motion of the planets and satellites. Newton perhaps considered as one of the best parts of his optical researches his explanation of the natural colour of bodies, which succeeding optical philosophers have had to reject; and he certainly held very strongly the necessity of a material cause for gravity, which his disciples have disregarded. Davy looked for his greatest triumph in the application of his discoveries to prevent the copper bottoms of ships from being corroded. And so in other matters.—Edinburgh Review, No. 216.\n\nRELICS OF GENIUS.\n\nProfessor George Wilson, in a lecture to the Scottish Society of Arts, says: âThe spectacle of these things ministers6 only to the good impulses of humanity. Isaac Newtonâs telescope at the Royal Society of London; Otto Guerickeâs air-pump in the Library at Berlin; James Wattâs repaired Newcomen steam-engine in the Natural-Philosophy class-room of the College at Glasgow; Fahrenheitâs thermometer in the corresponding class-room of the University of Edinburgh; Sir H. Davyâs great voltaic battery at the Royal Institution, London, and his safety-lamp at the Royal Society; Joseph Blackâs pneumatic trough in Dr. Gregoryâs possession; the first wire which Faraday made rotate electro-magnetically, at St. Bartholomewâs Hospital; Daltonâs atomic models at Manchester; and Kempâs liquefied gases in the Industrial Museum of Scotland,—are alike personal relics, historical monuments, and objects of instruction, which grow more and more precious every year, and of which we never can have too many.â\n\nTHE ROYAL SOCIETY: THE NATURAL AND SUPERNATURAL.\n\nThe Royal Society was formed with the avowed object of increasing knowledge by direct experiment; and it is worthy of remark, that the charter granted by Charles II. to this celebrated institution declares that its object is the extension of natural knowledge, as opposed to that which is supernatural.\n\nDr. Paris (Life of Sir H. Davy, vol. ii. p. 178) says: âThe charter of the Royal Society states that it was established for the improvement of natural science. This epithet natural was originally intended to imply a meaning, of which very few persons, I believe, are aware. At the period of the establishment of the society, the arts of witchcraft and divination were very extensively encouraged; and the word natural was therefore introduced in contradistinction to supernatural.â\n\nTHE PHILOSOPHER BOYLE.\n\nAfter the death of Bacon, one of the most distinguished Englishmen was certainly Robert Boyle, who, if compared with his contemporaries, may be said to rank immediately below Newton, though of course very inferior to him as an original thinker. Boyle was the first who instituted exact experiments into the relation between colour and heat; and by this means not only ascertained some very important facts, but laid a foundation for that union between optics and thermotics, which, though not yet completed, now merely waits for some great philosopher to strike out a generalisation large enough to cover both, and thus fuse the two sciences into a single study. It is also to Boyle, more than to any other Englishman, that we owe the science of hydrostatics in the state7 in which we now possess it.3 He is also the original discoverer of that beautiful law, so fertile in valuable results, according to which the elasticity of air varies as its density. And, in the opinion of one of the most eminent modern naturalists, it was Boyle who opened up those chemical inquiries which went on accumulating until, a century later, they supplied the means by which Lavoisier and his contemporaries fixed the real basis of chemistry, and enabled it for the first time to take its proper stand among those sciences that deal with the external world.—Buckleâs History of Civilization, vol. i.\n\nSIR ISAAC NEWTONâS ROOMS AND LABORATORY IN TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.\n\nOf the rooms occupied by Newton during his early residence at Cambridge, it is now difficult to settle the locality. The chamber allotted to him as Fellow, in 1667, was âthe Spiritual Chamber,â conjectured to have been the ground-room, next the chapel, but it is not certain that he resided there. The rooms in which he lived from 1682 till he left Cambridge, are in the north-east corner of the great court, on the first floor, on the right or north of the gateway or principal entrance to the college. His laboratory, as Dr. Humphrey Newton tell us, was âon the left end of the garden, near the east end of the chapel; and his telescope (refracting) was five feet long, and placed at the head of the stairs, going down into the garden.â4 The east side of Newtonâs rooms has been altered within the last fifty years: Professor Sedgwick, who came up to college in 1804, recollects a wooden room, supported on an arcade, shown in Logganâs view, in place of which arcade is now a wooden wall and brick chimney.\n\nDr. Humphrey Newton relates that in college Sir Isaac very rarely went to bed till two or three oâclock in the morning, sometimes not till five or six, especially at spring and fall of the leaf, when he used to employ about six weeks in his laboratory, the fire scarcely going out either night or day; he sitting up one night, and Humphrey another, till he had finished his chemical experiments. Dr. Newton describes the laboratory as âwell furnished with chymical materials, as bodyes, receivers, heads, crucibles, &c., which was made very little use of, ye crucibles excepted, in which he fused his metals: he would sometimes, though very seldom, look into an old mouldy book, which lay in his laboratory; I think it was titled Agricola de Metallis, the transmuting of metals being his chief design, for which purpose antimony8 was a great ingredient.â âHis brick furnaces, pro re nata, he made and altered himself without troubling a bricklayer.â âWhat observations he might make with his telescope, I know not, but several of his observations about comets and the planets may be found scattered here and there in a book intitled The Elements of Astronomy, by Dr. David Gregory.â5\n\nNEWTONâS âAPPLE-TREE.â\n\nCurious and manifold as are the trees associated with the great names of their planters, or those who have sojourned in their shade, the Tree which, by the falling of its fruit, suggested to Newton the idea of Gravity, is of paramount interest. It appears that, in the autumn of 1665, Newton left his college at Cambridge for his paternal home at Woolsthorpe. âWhen sitting alone in the garden,â says Sir David Brewster, âand speculating on the power of gravity, it occurred to him, that as the same power by which the apple fell to the ground was not sensibly diminished at the greatest distance from the centre of the earth to which we can reach, neither at the summits of the loftiest spires, nor on the tops of the highest mountains, it might extend to the moon and retain her in her orbit, in the same manner as it bends into a curve a stone or a cannon-ball when projected in a straight line from the surface of the earth.â—Life of Newton, vol. i. p. 26. Sir David Brewster notes, that neither Pemberton nor Whiston, who received from Newton himself his first ideas of gravity, records this story of the falling apple. It was mentioned, however, to Voltaire by Catherine Barton, Newtonâs niece; and to Mr. Green by Martin Folkes, President of the Royal Society. Sir David Brewster saw the reputed apple-tree in 1814, and brought away a portion of one of its roots. The tree was so much decayed that it was cut down in 1820, and the wood of it carefully preserved by Mr. Turnor, of Stoke Rocheford.\n\n9\n\nDe Morgan (in Notes and Queries, 2d series, No. 139, p. 169) questions whether the fruit was an apple, and maintains that the anecdote rests upon very slight authority; more especially as the idea had for many years been floating before the minds of physical inquirers; although Newton cleared away the confusions and difficulties which prevented very able men from proceeding beyond conjecture, and by this means established universal gravitation.\n\nNEWTONâS âPRINCIPIA.â\n\nâIt may be justly said,â observes Halley, âthat so many and so valuable philosophical truths as are herein discovered and put past dispute were never yet owing to the capacity and industry of any one man.â âThe importance and generality of the discoveries,â says Laplace, âand the immense number of original and profound views, which have been the germ of the most brilliant theories of the philosophers of this (18th) century, and all presented with much elegance, will ensure to the work on the Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy a preÃ«minence above all the other productions of human genius.â\n\nDESCARTESâ LABOURS IN PHYSICS.\n\nThe most profound among the many eminent thinkers France has produced, is RÃ©nÃ© Descartes, of whom the least that can be said is, that he effected a revolution more decisive than has ever been brought about by any other single mind; that he was the first who successfully applied algebra to geometry; that he pointed out the important law of the sines; that in an age in which optical instruments were extremely imperfect, he discovered the changes to which light is subjected in the eye by the crystalline lens; that he directed attention to the consequences resulting from the weight of the atmosphere; and that he moreover detected the causes of the rainbow. At the same time, and as if to combine the most varied forms of excellence, he is not only allowed to be the first geometrician of the age, but by the clearness and admirable precision of his style, he became one of the founders of French prose. And, although he was constantly engaged in those lofty inquiries into the nature of the human mind, which can never be studied without wonder, he combined with them a long course of laborious experiment upon the animal frame, which raised him to the highest rank among the anatomists of his time. The great discovery made by Harvey of the Circulation of the Blood was neglected by most of his contemporaries; but it was at once recognised by Descartes, who made it the basis of the physiological part of his work on man. He was likewise the discoverer of the lacteals by Aselli, which, like every great10 truth yet laid before the world, was at its first appearance, not only disbelieved, but covered with ridicule.—Buckleâs History of Civilization, vol. i.\n\nCONIC SECTIONS.\n\nIf a cone or sugar-loaf be cut through in certain directions, we shall obtain figures which are termed conic sections: thus, if we cut through a sugar-loaf parallel to its base or bottom, the outline or edge of the loaf where it is cut will be a circle. If the cut is made so as to slant, and not be parallel to the base of the loaf, the outline is an ellipse, provided the cut goes quite through the sides of the loaf all round; but if it goes slanting, and parallel to the line of the loafâs side, the outline is a parabola, a conic section or curve, which is distinguished by characteristic properties, every point of it bearing a certain fixed relation to a certain point within it, as the circle does to its centre.—Dr. Parisâs Notes to Philosophy in Sport, &c.\n\nPOWER OF COMPUTATION.\n\nThe higher class of mathematicians, at the end of the seventeenth century, had become excellent computers, particularly in England, of which Wallis, Newton, Halley, the Gregorys, and De Moivre, are splendid examples. Before results of extreme exactness had become quite familiar, there was a gratifying sense of power in bringing out the new methods. Newton, in one of his letters to Oldenburg, says that he was at one time too much attached to such things, and that he should be ashamed to say to what number of figures he was in the habit of carrying his results. The growth of power of computation on the Continent did not, however, keep pace with that of the same in England. In 1696, De Laguy, a well-known writer on algebra, and a member of the Academy of Sciences, said that the most skilful computer could not, in less than a month, find within a unit the cube root of 696536483318640035073641037.—De Morgan.\n\nâTHE SCIENCE OF THE COSMOS.â\n\nHumboldt, characterises this âuncommon but definite expressionâ as the treating of âthe assemblage of all things with which space is filled, from the remotest nebulÃ¦ to the climatic distribution of those delicate tissues of vegetable matter which spread a variegated covering over the surface of our rocks.â The word cosmos, which primitively, in the Homeric ages, indicated an idea of order and harmony, was subsequently adopted in scientific language, where it was gradually applied to the order observed in the movements of the heavenly bodies; to the whole universe; and then finally to the world in which this harmony was reflected to us.\n\n11\n\nPhysical Phenomena.\n\nALL THE WORLD IN MOTION.\n\nHumboldt, in his Cosmos,6 gives the following beautiful illustrative proofs of this phenomenon:\n\nIf, for a moment, we imagine the acuteness of our senses preternaturally heightened to the extreme limits of telescopic vision, and bring together events separated by wide intervals of time, the apparent repose which reigns in space will suddenly vanish; countless stars will be seen moving in groups in various directions; nebulÃ¦ wandering, condensing, and dissolving like cosmical clouds; the milky way breaking up in parts, and its veil rent asunder. In every point of the celestial vault we shall recognise the dominion of progressive movement, as on the surface of the earth where vegetation is constantly putting forth its leaves and buds, and unfolding its blossoms. The celebrated Spanish botanist, Cavanilles, first conceived the possibility of âseeing grass grow,â by placing the horizontal micrometer wire of a telescope, with a high magnifying power, at one time on the point of a bamboo shoot, and at another on the rapidly unfolding flowering stem of an American aloe; precisely as the astronomer places the cross of wires on a culminating star. Throughout the whole life of physical nature—in the organic as in the sidereal world—existence, preservation, production, and development, are alike associated with motion as their essential condition.\n\nTHE AXIS OF ROTATION.\n\nIt is remarkable as a mechanical fact, that nothing is so permanent in nature as the Axis of Rotation of any thing which is rapidly whirled. We have examples of this in every-day practice. The first is the motion of a boyâs hoop. What keeps the hoop from falling?—It is its rotation, which is one of the most complicated subjects in mechanics.\n\nAnother thing pertinent to this question is, the motion of a quoit. Every body who ever threw a quoit knows that to make it preserve its position as it goes through the air, it is necessary to give it a whirling motion. It will be seen that while whirling, it preserves its plane, whatever the position of the plane may be, and however it may be inclined to the direction in which the quoit travels. Now, this has greater analogy with the motion of the earth than any thing else.\n\nAnother illustration is the motion of a spinning top. The greatest mathematician of the last century, the celebrated Euler, has written a whole book on the motion of a top, and his Latin treatise De motu Turbinis is one of the most remarkable books on mechanics. The motion of a top is a matter of12 the greatest importance; it is applicable to the elucidation of some of the greatest phenomena of nature. In all these instances there is this wonderful tendency in rotation to preserve the axis of rotation unaltered.—Prof. Airyâs Lect. on Astronomy.\n\nTHE EARTHâS ANNUAL MOTION.\n\nIn conformity with the Copernican view of our system, we must learn to look upon the sun as the comparatively motionless centre about which the earth performs an annual elliptic orbit of the dimensions and excentricity, and with a velocity, regulated according to a certain assigned law; the sun occupying one of the foci of the ellipse, and from that station quietly disseminating on all sides its light and heat; while the earth travelling round it, and presenting itself differently to it at different times of the year and day, passes through the varieties of day and night, summer and winter, which we enjoy.—Sir John Herschelâs Outlines of Astronomy.\n\nLaplace has shown that the length of the day has not varied the hundredth part of a second since the observations of Hipparchus, 2000 years ago.\n\nSTABILITY OF THE OCEAN.\n\nIn submitting this question to analysis, Laplace found that the equilibrium of the ocean is stable if its density is less than the mean density of the earth, and that its equilibrium cannot be subverted unless these two densities are equal, or that of the earth less than that of its waters. The experiments on the attraction of Schehallien and Mont Cenis, and those made by Cavendish, Reich, and Baily, with balls of lead, demonstrate that the mean density of the earth is at least five times that of water, and hence the stability of the ocean is placed beyond a doubt. As the seas, therefore, have at one time covered continents which are now raised above their level, we must seek for some other cause of it than any want of stability in the equilibrium of the ocean. How beautifully does this conclusion illustrate the language of Scripture, âHitherto shalt thou come, but no furtherâ! (Job xxxviii. 11.)\n\nCOMPRESSION OF BODIES.\n\nSir John Leslie observes, that air compressed into the fiftieth part of its volume has its elasticity fifty times augmented: if it continued to contract at that rate, it would, from its own incumbent weight, acquire the density of water at the depth of thirty-four miles. But water itself would have its density doubled at the depth of ninety-three miles, and would attain the density of quicksilver at the depth of 362 miles. In descending, therefore, towards the centre, through nearly 4000 miles, the condensation of ordinary substances would surpass the utmost13 powers of conception. Dr. Young says, that steel would be compressed into one-fourth, and stone into one-eighth, of its bulk at the earthâs centre.—Mrs. Somerville.\n\nTHE WORLD IN A NUTSHELL.\n\nFrom the many proofs of the non-contact of the atoms, even in the most solid parts of bodies; from the very great space obviously occupied by pores—the mass having often no more solidity than a heap of empty boxes, of which the apparently solid parts may still be as porous in a second degree and so on; and from the great readiness with which light passes in all directions through dense bodies, like glass, rock-crystal, diamond, &c., it has been argued that there is so exceedingly little of really solid matter even in the densest mass, that the whole world, if the atoms could be brought into absolute contact, might be compressed into a nutshell. We have as yet no means of determining exactly what relation this idea has to truth.—Arnott.\n\nTHE WORLD OF ATOMS.\n\nThe infinite groups of atoms flying through all time and space, in different directions and under different laws, have interchangeably tried and exhibited every possible mode of rencounter: sometimes repelled from each other by concussion; and sometimes adhering to each other from their own jagged or pointed construction, or from the casual interstices which two or more connected atoms must produce, and which may be just adapted to those of other figures,—as globular, oval, or square. Hence the origin of compound and visible bodies; hence the origin of large masses of matter; hence, eventually, the origin of the world.—Dr. Goodâs Book of Nature.\n\nThe great Epicurus speculated on âthe plastic natureâ of atoms, and attributed to this nature the power they possess of arranging themselves into symmetric forms. Modern philosophers satisfy themselves with attraction; and reasoning from analogy, imagine that each atom has a polar system.—Huntâs Poetry of Science.\n\nMINUTE ATOMS OF THE ELEMENTS: DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER.\n\nSo minute are the parts of the elementary bodies in their ultimate state of division, in which condition they are usually termed atoms, as to elude all our powers of inspection, even when aided by the most powerful microscopes. Who can see the particles of gold in a solution of that metal in aqua regia, or those of common salt when dissolved in water? Dr. Thomas Thomson has estimated the bulk of an ultimate particle or atom of lead as less than 1/888492000000000th of a cubic inch,14 and concludes that its weight cannot exceed the 1/310000000000th of a grain.\n\nThis curious calculation was made by Dr. Thomson, in order to show to what degree Matter could be divided, and still be sensible to the eye. He dissolved a grain of nitrate of lead in 500,000 grains of water, and passed through the solution a current of sulphuretted hydrogen; when the whole liquid became sensibly discoloured. Now, a grain of water may be regarded as being almost equal to a drop of that liquid, and a drop may be easily spread out so as to cover a square inch of surface. But under an ordinary microscope the millionth of a square inch may be distinguished by the eye. The water, therefore, could be divided into 500,000,000,000 parts. But the lead in a grain of nitrate of lead weighs 0Â·62 of a grain; an atom of lead, accordingly, cannot weigh more than 1/810000000000th of a grain; while the atom of sulphur, which in combination with the lead rendered it visible, could not weigh more than 1/2015000000000, that is, the two-billionth part of a grain.—Professor Low; Jamesonâs Journal, No. 106.\n\nWEIGHT OF AIR.\n\nAir can be so rarefied that the contents of a cubic foot shall not weigh the tenth part of a grain: if a quantity that would fill a space the hundredth part of an inch in diameter be separated from the rest, the air will still be found there, and we may reasonably conceive that there may be several particles present, though the weight is less than the seventeen-hundred-millionth of a grain.\n\nDURATION OF THE PYRAMID.\n\nThe great reason of the duration of the pyramid above all other forms is, that it is most fitted to resist the force of gravitation. Thus the Pyramids of Egypt are the oldest monuments in the world.\n\nINERTIA ILLUSTRATED.\n\nMany things of common occurrence (says Professor Tyndall) are to be explained by reference to the quality of inactivity. We will here state a few of them.\n\nWhen a railway train is moving, if it strike against any obstacle which arrests its motion, the passengers are thrown forward in the direction in which the train was proceeding. Such accidents often occur on a small scale, in attaching carriages at railway stations. The reason is, that the passengers share the motion of the train, and, as matter, they tend to persist in motion. When the train is suddenly checked, this tendency exhibits itself by the falling forward referred to. In15 like manner, when a train previously at rest is suddenly set in motion, the tendency of the passengers to remain at rest evinces itself by their falling in a direction opposed to that in which the train moves.\n\nTHE LEANING TOWER OF PISA.7\n\nSir John Leslie used to attribute the stability of this tower to the cohesion of the mortar it is built with being sufficient to maintain it erect, in spite of its being out of the condition required by physics—to wit, that âin order that a column shall stand, a perpendicular let fall from the centre of gravity must fall within the base.â Sir John describes the Tower of Pisa to be in violation of this principle; but, according to later authorities, the perpendicular falls within the base.\n\nEARLY PRESENTIMENTS OF CENTRIFUGAL FORCES.\n\nJacobi, in his researches on the mathematical knowledge of the Greeks, comments on âthe profound consideration of nature evinced by Anaxagoras, in whom we read with astonishment a passage asserting that the moon, if the centrifugal force were intermitted, would fall to the earth like a stone from a sling.â Anaxagoras likewise applied the same theory of âfalling where the force of rotation had been intermittedâ to all the material celestial bodies. In Aristotle and Simplicius may also be traced the idea of âthe non-falling of heavenly bodies when the rotatory force predominates over the actual falling force, or downward attraction;â and Simplicius mentions that âwater in a phial is not spilt when the movement of rotation is more rapid than the downward movement of the water.â This is illustrated at the present day by rapidly whirling a pail half-filled with water without spilling a drop.\n\nPlato had a clearer idea than Aristotle of the attractive force exercised by the earthâs centre on all heavy bodies removed from it; for he was acquainted with the acceleration of falling16 bodies, although he did not correctly understand the cause. John Philoponus, the Alexandrian, probably in the sixth century, was the first who ascribed the movement of the heavenly bodies to a primitive impulse, connecting with this idea that of the fall of bodies, or the tendency of all substances, whether heavy or light, to reach the ground. The idea conceived by Copernicus, and more clearly expressed by Kepler, who even applied it to the ebb and flow of the ocean, received in 1666 and 1674 a new impulse from Robert Hooke; and next Newtonâs theory of gravitation presented the grand means of converting the whole of physical astronomy into a true mechanism of the heavens.\n\nThe law of gravitation knows no exception; it accounts accurately for the most complex motions of the members of our own system; nay more, the paths of double stars, far removed from all appreciable effects of our portion of the universe, are in perfect accordance with its theory.8\n\nHEIGHT OF FALLS.\n\nThe fancy of the Greeks delighted itself in wild visions of the height of falls. In Hesiodâs Theogony it is said, speaking of the fall of the Titans into Tartarus, âif a brazen anvil were to fall from heaven nine days and nine nights long, it would reach the earth on the tenth.â This descent of the anvil in 777,600 seconds of time gives an equivalent in distance of 309,424 geographical miles (allowance being made, according to Galleâs calculation, for the considerable diminution in force of attraction at planetary distances); therefore 1Â½ times the distance of the moon from the earth. But, according to the Iliad, HephÃ¦stus fell down to Lemnos in one day; âwhen but a little breath was still in him.â—Note to Humboldtâs Cosmos, vol. iii.\n\nRATE OF THE FALL OF BODIES.\n\nA body falls in gravity precisely 16-1/16 feet in a second, and the velocity increases according to the squares of the time, viz.:\n\nIn Â¼ (quarter of a second) a body falls 1 foot. Â½ (half a second) 4 feet. 1 second 16 â 2 ditto 64 â 3 ditto 144 â\n\n17 The power of gravity at two miles distance from the earth is four times less than at one mile; at three miles nine times less, and so on. It goes on lessening, but is never destroyed.—Notes in various Sciences.\n\nVARIETIES OF SPEED.\n\nA French scientific work states the ordinary rate to be:\n\nÂ per second. Of a man walking 4 feet. Of a good horse in harness 12 â Of a rein-deer in a sledge on the ice 26 â Of an English race-horse 43 â Of a hare 88 â Of a good sailing ship 19 â Of the wind 82 â Of sound 1038 â Of a 24-pounder cannon-ball 1300 â\n\nLIFTING HEAVY PERSONS.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary pages in Sir David Brewsterâs Letters on Natural Magic is the experiment in which a heavy man is raised with the greatest facility when he is lifted up the instant that his own lungs, and those of the persons who raise him, are inflated with air. Thus the heaviest person in the party lies down upon two chairs, his legs being supported by the one and his back by the other. Four persons, one at each leg, and one at each shoulder, then try to raise him—the person to be raised giving two signals, by clapping his hands. At the first signal, he himself and the four lifters begin to draw a long and full breath; and when the inhalation is completed, or the lungs filled, the second signal is given for raising the person from the chair. To his own surprise, and that of his bearers, he rises with the greatest facility, as if he were no heavier than a feather. Sir David Brewster states that he has seen this inexplicable experiment performed more than once; and he appealed for testimony to Sir Walter Scott, who had repeatedly seen the experiment, and performed the part both of the load and of the bearer. It was first shown in England by Major H., who saw it performed in a large party at Venice, under the direction of an officer of the American navy.9\n\nSir David Brewster (in a letter to Notes and Queries, No. 143) further remarks, that âthe inhalation of the lifters the moment the effort is made is doubtless essential, and for this reason: when we make a great effort, either in pulling or lifting, we always fill the chest with air previous to the effort; and when18 the inhalation is completed, we close the rima glottidis to keep the air in the lungs. The chest being thus kept expanded, the pulling or lifting muscles have received as it were a fulcrum round which their power is exerted; and we can thus lift the greatest weight which the muscles are capable of doing. When the chest collapses by the escape of the air, the lifters lose their muscular power; reinhalation of air by the liftee can certainly add nothing to the power of the lifters, or diminish his own weight, which is only increased by the weight of the air which he inhales.â\n\nâFORCE CAN NEITHER BE CREATED NOR DESTROYED.â\n\nProfessor Faraday, in his able inquiry upon âthe Conservation of Force,â maintains that to admit that force may be destructible, or can altogether disappear, would be to admit that matter could be uncreated; for we know matter only by its forces. From his many illustrations we select the following:\n\nThe indestructibility of individual matter is a most important case of the Conservation of Chemical Force. A molecule has been endowed with powers which give rise in it to various qualities; and those never change, either in their nature or amount. A particle of oxygen is ever a particle of oxygen; nothing can in the least wear it. If it enters into combination, and disappears as oxygen; if it pass through a thousand combinations—animal, vegetable, mineral; if it lie hid for a thousand years, and then be evolved,—it is oxygen with the first qualities, neither more nor less. It has all its original force, and only that; the amount of force which it disengaged when hiding itself, has again to be employed in a reverse direction when it is set at liberty: and if, hereafter, we should decompose oxygen, and find it compounded of other particles, we should only increase the strength of the proof of the conservation of force; for we should have a right to say of these particles, long as they have been hidden, all that we could say of the oxygen itself.\n\nIn conclusion, he adds:\n\nLet us not admit the destruction or creation of force without clear and constant proof. Just as the chemist owes all the perfection of his science to his dependence on the certainty of gravitation applied by the balance, so may the physical philosopher expect to find the greatest security and the utmost aid in the principle of the conservation of force. All that we have that is good and safe—as the steam-engine, the electric telegraph, &c.—witness to that principle; it would require a perpetual motion, a fire without heat, heat without a source, action without reaction, cause without effect, or effect without cause, to displace it from its rank as a law of nature.\n\nNOTHING LOST IN THE MATERIAL WORLD.\n\nâIt is remarkable,â says Kobell in his Mineral Kingdom, âhow a change of place, a circulation as it were, is appointed for the inanimate or naturally immovable things upon the earth; and how new conditions, new creations, are continually developing themselves in this way. I will not enter here into the19 evaporation of water, for instance from the widely-spreading ocean; how the clouds produced by this pass over into foreign lands and then fall again to the earth as rain, and how this wandering water is, partly at least, carried along new journeys, returning after various voyages to its original home: the mere mechanical phenomena, such as the transfer of seeds by the winds or by birds, or the decomposition of the surface of the earth by the friction of the elements, suffice to illustrate this.â\n\nTIME AN ELEMENT OF FORCE.\n\nProfessor Faraday observes that Time is growing up daily into importance as an element in the exercise of Force, which he thus strikingly illustrates:\n\nThe earth moves in its orbit of time; the crust of the earth moves in time; light moves in time; an electro-magnet requires time for its charge by an electric current: to inquire, therefore, whether power, acting either at sensible or insensible distances, always acts in time, is not to be metaphysical; if it acts in time and across space, it must act by physical lines of force; and our view of the nature of force may be affected to the extremest degree by the conclusions which experiment and observation on time may supply, being perhaps finally determinable only by them. To inquire after the possible time in which gravitating, magnetic, or electric force is exerted, is no more metaphysical than to mark the times of the hands of a clock in their progress; or that of the temple of Serapis, and its ascents and descents; or the periods of the occultation of Jupiterâs satellites; or that in which the light comes from them to the earth. Again, in some of the known cases of the action of time something happens while the time is passing which did not happen before, and does not continue after; it is therefore not metaphysical to expect an effect in every case, or to endeavour to discover its existence and determine its nature.\n\nCALCULATION OF HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES.\n\nBy the assistance of a seconds watch the following interesting calculations may be made:\n\nIf a traveller, when on a precipice or on the top of a building, wish to ascertain the height, he should drop a stone, or any other substance sufficiently heavy not to be impeded by the resistance of the atmosphere; and the number of seconds which elapse before it reaches the bottom, carefully noted on a seconds watch, will give the height. For the stone will fall through the space of 16-1/8 feet during the first second, and will increase in rapidity as the square of the time employed in the fall: if, therefore, 16-1/8 be multiplied by the number of seconds the stone has taken to fall, this product also multiplied by the same number of seconds will give the height. Suppose the stone takes five seconds to reach the bottom:\n\n16-1/8 Ã 5 = 80-5/8 Ã 5 = 403-1/8, height of the precipice.\n\nThe Count Xavier de Maistre, in his ExpÃ©dition nocturne autour de ma Chambre, anxious to ascertain the exact height of his room from the ground on which Turin is built, tells us he proceeded as follows: âMy heart beat quickly, and I just counted three pulsations from the instant20 I dropped my slipper until I heard the sound as it fell in the street, which, according to the calculations made of the time taken by bodies in their accelerated fall, and of that employed by the sonorous undulations of the air to arrive from the street to my ear, gave the height of my apartment as 94 feet 3 inches 1 tenth (French measure), supposing that my heart, agitated as it was, beat 120 times in a minute.â\n\nA person travelling may ascertain his rate of walking by the aid of a slight string with a piece of lead at one end, and the use of a seconds watch; the string being knotted at distances of 44 feet, the 120th part of an English mile, and bearing the same proportion to a mile that half a minute bears to an hour. If the traveller, when going at his usual rate, drops the lead, and suffers the string to slip through his hand, the number of knots which pass in half a minute indicate the number of miles he walks in an hour. This contrivance is similar to a log-line for ascertaining a shipâs rate at sea: the lead is enclosed in wood (whence the name log), that it may float, and the divisions, which are called knots, are measured for nautical miles. Thus, if ten knots are passed in half a minute, they show that the vessel is sailing at the rate of ten knots, or miles, an hour: a seconds watch would here be of great service, but the half-minute sand-glass is in general use.\n\nThe rapidity of a river may be ascertained by throwing in a light floating substance, which, if not agitated by the wind, will move with the same celerity as the water: the distance it floats in a certain number of seconds will give the rapidity of the stream; and this indicates the height of its source, the nature of its bottom, &c.—See Sir Howard Douglas on Bridges. Thomsonâs Time and Time-keepers.\n\nSAND IN THE HOUR-GLASS.\n\nIt is a noteworthy fact, that the flow of Sand in the Hour-glass is perfectly equable, whatever may be the quantity in the glass; that is, the sand runs no faster when the upper half of the glass is quite full than when it is nearly empty. It would, however, be natural enough to conclude, that when full of sand it would be more swiftly urged through the aperture than when the glass was only a quarter full, and near the close of the hour.\n\nThe fact of the even flow of sand may be proved by a very simple experiment. Provide some silver sand, dry it over or before the fire, and pass it through a tolerably fine sieve. Then take a tube, of any length or diameter, closed at one end, in which make a small hole, say the eighth of an inch; stop this with a peg, and fill up the tube with the sifted sand. Hold the tube steadily, or fix it to a wall or frame at any height from a table; remove the peg, and permit the sand to flow in any measure for any given time, and note the quantity. Then let the tube be emptied, and only half or a quarter filled with sand; measure again for a like time, and the same quantity of sand will flow: even if you press the sand in the tube with a ruler or stick, the flow of the sand through the hole will not be increased.\n\nThe above is explained by the fact, that when the sand is poured into the tube, it fills it with a succession of conical21 heaps; and that all the weight which the bottom of the tube sustains is only that of the heap which first falls upon it, as the succeeding heaps do not press downward, but only against the sides or walls of the tube.\n\nFIGURE OF THE EARTH.\n\nBy means of a purely astronomical determination, based upon the action which the earth exerts on the motion of the moon, or, in other words, on the inequalities in lunar longitudes and latitudes, Laplace has shown in one single result the mean Figure of the Earth.\n\nIt is very remarkable that an astronomer, without leaving his observatory, may, merely by comparing his observations with mean analytical results, not only be enabled to determine with exactness the size and degree of ellipticity of the earth, but also its distance from the sun and moon; results that otherwise could only be arrived at by long and arduous expeditions to the most remote parts of both hemispheres. The moon may therefore, by the observation of its movements, render appreciable to the higher departments of astronomy the ellipticity of the earth, as it taught the early astronomers the rotundity of our earth by means of its eclipses.—Laplaceâs Expos. du Syst. du Monde.\n\nHOW TO ASCERTAIN THE EARTHâS MAGNITUDE.\n\nSir John Herschel gives the following means of approximation. It appears by observation that two points, each ten feet above the surface, cease to be visible from each other over still water, and, in average atmospheric circumstances, at a distance of about eight miles. But 10 feet is the 528th part of a mile; so that half their distance, or four miles, is to the height of each as 4 Ã 528, or 2112:1, and therefore in the same proportion to four miles is the length of the earthâs diameter. It must, therefore, be equal to 4 Ã 2112 = 8448, or in round numbers, about 8000 miles, which is not very far from the truth.\n\nThe excess is, however, about 100 miles, or 1/80th part. As convenient numbers to remember, the reader may bear in mind, that in our latitude there are just as many thousands of feet in a degree of the meridian as there are days in the year (365); that, speaking loosely, a degree is about seventy British statute miles, and a second about 100 feet; that the equatorial circumference of the earth is a little less than 25,000 miles (24,899), and the ellipticity or polar flattening amounts to 1/300th part of the diameter.—Outlines of Astronomy.\n\nMASS AND DENSITY OF THE EARTH.\n\nWith regard to the determination of the Mass and Density of the Earth by direct experiment, we have, in addition to the deviations of the pendulum produced by mountain masses, the variation of the same instruments when placed in a mine 1200 feet in depth. The most recent experiments were conducted22 by Professor Airy, in the Harton coal-pit, near South Shields:10 the oscillations of the pendulum at the bottom of the pit were compared with those of a clock above; the beats of the clock were transferred below for comparison by an electrio wire; and it was thus determined that a pendulum vibrating seconds at the mouth of the pit would gain 2Â¼ seconds per day at its bottom. The final result of the calculations depending on this experiment, which were published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1856, gives 6Â·565 for the mean density of the earth. The celebrated Cavendish experiment, by means of which the density of the earth was determined by observing the attraction of leaden balls on each other, has been repeated in a manner exhibiting an astonishing amount of skill and patience by the late Mr. F. Baily.11 The result of these experiments, combined with those previously made, gives as a mean result 5Â·441 as the earthâs density, when compared with water; thus confirming one of Newtonâs astonishing divinations, that the mean density of the earth would be found to be between five and six times that of water.\n\nHumboldt is, however, of opinion that âwe know only the mass of the whole earth and its mean density by comparing it with the open strata, which alone are accessible to us. In the interior of the earth, where all knowledge of its chemical and mineralogical character fails, we are limited to as pure conjecture as in the remotest bodies that revolve round the sun. We can determine nothing with certainty regarding the depth at which the geological strata must be supposed to be in a state of softening or of liquid fusion, of the condition of fluids when heated under an enormous pressure, or of the law of the increase of density from the upper surface to the centre of the earth.â—Cosmos, vol. i.\n\nIn M. Foucaultâs beautiful experiment, by means of the vibration of a long pendulum, consisting of a heavy mass of metal suspended by a long wire from a strong fixed support, is demonstrated to the eye the rotation of the earth. The Gyroscope of the same philosopher is regarded not as a mere philosophical toy; but the principles of dynamics, by means of which it is made to demonstrate the earthâs rotation on its own axis, are explained with the greatest clearness. Thus the ingenuity of M. Foucault, combined with a profound knowledge of mechanics, has obtained proofs of one of the most interesting problems of astronomy from an unsuspected source.\n\nTHE EARTH AND MAN COMPARED.\n\nThe Earth—speaking roundly—is 8000 miles in diameter;23 the atmosphere is calculated to be fifty miles in altitude; the loftiest mountain peak is estimated at five miles above the level of the sea, for this height has never been visited by man; the deepest mine that he has formed is 1650 feet; and his own stature does not average six feet. Therefore, if it were possible for him to construct a globe 800 feet—or twice the height of St. Paulâs Cathedral—in diameter, and to place upon any one point of its surface an atom of 1/4380th of an inch in diameter, and 1/720th of an inch in height, it would correctly denote the proportion that man bears to the earth upon which he moves.\n\nWhen by measurements, in which the evidence of the method advances equally with the precision of the results, the volume of the earth is reduced to the millionth part of the volume of the sun; when the sun himself, transported to the region of the stars, takes up a very modest place among the thousands of millions of those bodies that the telescope has revealed to us; when the 38,000,000 of leagues which separate the earth from the sun have become, by reason of their comparative smallness, a base totally insufficient for ascertaining the dimensions of the visible universe; when even the swiftness of the luminous rays (77,000 leagues per second) barely suffices for the common valuations of science; when, in short, by a chain of irresistible proofs, certain stars have retired to distances that light could not traverse in less than a million of years;—we feel as if annihilated by such immensities. In assigning to man and to the planet that he inhabits so small a position in the material world, astronomy seems really to have made progress only to humble us.—Arago.\n\nMEAN TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTHâS SURFACE.\n\nProfessor Dove has shown, by taking at all seasons the mean of the temperature of points diametrically opposite to each other, that the mean temperature of the whole earthâs surface in June considerably exceeds that in December. This result, which is at variance with the greater proximity of the sun in December, is, however, due to a totally different and very powerful cause,—the greater amount of land in that hemisphere which has its summer solstice in June (i. e. the northern); and the fact is so explained by him. The effect of land under sunshine is to throw heat into the general atmosphere, and to distribute it by the carrying power of the latter over the whole earth. Water is much less effective in this respect, the heat penetrating its depths and being there absorbed; so that the surface never acquires a very elevated temperature, even under the equator.—Sir John Herschelâs Outlines.\n\nTEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH STATIONARY.\n\nAlthough, according to Bessel, 25,000 cubic miles of water flow in every six hours from one quarter of the earth to another, and the temperature is augmented by the ebb and flow of every24 tide, all that we know with certainty is, that the resultant effect of all the thermal agencies to which the earth is exposed has undergone no perceptible change within the historic period. We owe this fine deduction to Arago. In order that the date palm should ripen its fruit, the mean temperature of the place must exceed 70 deg. Fahr.; and, on the other hand, the vine cannot be cultivated successfully when the temperature is 72 deg. or upwards. Hence the mean temperature of any place at which these two plants flourished and bore fruit must lie between these narrow limits, i. e. could not differ from 71 deg. Fahr. by more than a single degree. Now from the Bible we learn that both plants were simultaneously cultivated in the central valleys of Palestine in the time of Moses; and its then temperature is thus definitively determined. It is the same at the present time; so that the mean temperature of this portion of the globe has not sensibly altered in the course of thirty-three centuries.\n\nTHEORY OF CRYSTALLISATION.\n\nProfessor PlÃ¼cker has ascertained that certain crystals, in particular the cyanite, âpoint very well to the north by the magnetic power of the earth only. It is a true compass-needle; and more than that, you may obtain its declination.â Upon this Mr. Hunt remarks: âWe must remember that this crystal, the cyanite, is a compound of silica and alumina only. This is the amount of experimental evidence which science has afforded in explanation of the conditions under which nature pursues her wondrous work of crystal formation. We see just sufficient of the operation to be convinced that the luminous star which shines in the brightness of heaven, and the cavern-secreted gem, are equally the result of forces which are known to us in only a few of their modifications.â—Poetry of Science.\n\nGay Lussac first made the remark, that a crystal of potash-alum, transferred to a solution of ammonia-alum, continued to increase without its form being modified, and might thus be covered with alternate layers of the two alums, preserving its regularity and proper crystalline figure. M. Beudant afterwards observed that other bodies, such as the sulphates of iron and copper, might present themselves in crystals of the same form and angles, although the form was not a simple one, like that of alum. But M. Mitscherlich first recognised this correspondence in a sufficient number of cases to prove that it was a general consequence of similarity of composition in different bodies.—Grahamâs Elements of Chemistry.\n\nIMMENSE CRYSTALS.\n\nCrystals are found in the most microscopic character, and25 of an exceedingly large size. A crystal of quartz at Milan is three feet and a quarter long, and five feet and a half in circumference: its weight is 870 pounds. Beryls have been found in New Hampshire measuring four feet in length.—Dana.\n\nVISIBLE CRYSTALLISATION.\n\nProfessor Tyndall, in a lecture delivered by him at the Royal Institution, London, on the properties of Ice, gave the following interesting illustration of crystalline force. By perfectly cleaning a piece of glass, and placing on it a film of a solution of chloride of ammonium or sal ammoniac, the action of crystallisation was shown to the whole audience. The glass slide was placed in a microscope, and the electric light passing through it was concentrated on a white disc. The image of the crystals, as they started into existence, and shot across the disc in exquisite arborescent and symmetrical forms, excited the admiration of every one. The lecturer explained that the heat, causing the film of moisture to evaporate, brought the particles of salt sufficiently near to exercise the crystalline force, the result being the beautiful structure built up with such marvellous rapidity.\n\nUNION OF MINERALOGY AND GEOMETRY.\n\nIt is a peculiar characteristic of minerals, that while plants and animals differ in various regions of the earth, mineral matter of the same character may be discovered in any part of the world,—at the Equator or towards the Poles; at the summit of the loftiest mountains, and in works far beneath the level of the sea. The granite of Australia does not necessarily differ from that of the British islands; and ores of the same metals (the proper geological conditions prevailing) may be found of the same general character in all regions. Climate and geographical position have no influence on the composition of mineral substances.\n\nThis uniformity may, in some measure, have induced philosophers to seek its extension to the forms of crystallography. About 1760 (says Mr. Buckle, in his History of Civilization), RomÃ© de Lisle set the first example of studying crystals, according to a scheme so large as to include all the varieties of their primary forms, and to account for their irregularities and the apparent caprice with which they were arranged. In this investigation he was guided by the fundamental assumption, that what is called an irregularity is in truth perfectly regular, and that the operations of nature are invariable. HaÃ¼y applied this great idea to the almost innumerable forms in which minerals crystallise. He thus achieved a complete union between mineralogy and geometry; and, bringing the laws of space26 to bear on the molecular arrangements of matter, he was able to penetrate into the intimate structure of crystals. By this means he proved that the secondary forms of all crystals are derived from their primary forms by a regular process of decrement; and that when a substance is passing from a liquid to a solid state, its particles cohere, according to a scheme which provides for every possible change, since it includes even those subsequent layers which alter the ordinary type of the crystal, by disturbing its natural symmetry. To ascertain that such violations of symmetry are susceptible of mathematical calculation, was to make a vast addition to our knowledge; and, by proving that even the most uncouth and singular forms are the natural results of their antecedents, HaÃ¼y laid the foundation of what may be called the pathology of the inorganic world. However paradoxical such a notion may appear, it is certain that symmetry is to crystals what health is to animals; so that an irregularity of shape in the first corresponds with an appearance of disease in the second.—See Hist. Civilization, vol. i.\n\nREPRODUCTIVE CRYSTALLISATION.\n\nThe general belief that only organic beings have the power of reproducing lost parts has been disproved by the experiments of Jordan on crystals. An octohedral crystal of alum was fractured; it was then replaced in a solution, and after a few days its injury was seen to be repaired. The whole crystal had of course increased in size; but the increase on the broken surface had been so much greater that a perfect octohedral form was regained.—G. H. Lewes.\n\nThis remarkable power possessed by crystals, in common with animals, of repairing their own injuries had, however, been thus previously referred to by Paget, in his Pathology, confirming the experiments of Jordan on this curious subject: âThe ability to repair the damages sustained by injury ... is not an exclusive property of living beings; for even crystals will repair themselves when, after pieces have been broken from them, they are placed in the same conditions in which they were first formed.â\n\nGLASS BROKEN BY SAND.\n\nIn some glass-houses the workmen show glass which has been cooled in the open air; on this they let fall leaden bullets without breaking the glass. They afterwards desire you to let a few grains of sand fall upon the glass, by which it is broken into a thousand pieces. The reason of this is, that the lead does not scratch the surface of the glass; whereas the sand, being sharp and angular, scratches it sufficiently to produce the above effect.\n\n27\n\nSound and Light.\n\nSOUNDING SAND.\n\nMr. Hugh Miller, the geologist, when in the island of Eigg, in the Hebrides, observed that a musical sound was produced when he walked over the white dry sand of the beach. At each step the sand was driven from his footprint, and the noise was simultaneous with the scattering of the sand; the cause being either the accumulated vibrations of the air when struck by the driven sand, or the accumulated sounds occasioned by the mutual impact of the particles of sand against each other. If a musket-ball passing through the air emits a whistling note, each individual particle of sand must do the same, however faint be the note which it yields; and the accumulation of these infinitesimal vibrations must constitute an audible sound, varying with the number and velocity of the moving particles. In like manner, if two plates of silex or quartz, which are but crystals of sand, give out a musical sound when mutually struck, the impact or collision of two minute crystals or particles of sand must do the same, in however inferior a degree; and the union of all these sounds, though singly imperceptible, may constitute the musical notes of âthe Mountain of the Bellâ in Arabia PetrÃ¦a, or the lesser sounds of the trodden sea-beach of Eigg.—North-British Review, No. 5.\n\nINTENSITY OF SOUND IN RAREFIED AIR.\n\nThe experiences during ascents of the highest mountains are contradictory. Saussure describes the sounds on the top of Mont Blanc as remarkably weak: a pistol-shot made no more noise than an ordinary Chinese cracker, and the popping of a bottle of champagne was scarcely audible. Yet Martius, in the same situation, was able to distinguish the voices of the guides at a distance of 1340 feet, and to hear the tapping of a lead pencil upon a metallic surface at a distance of from 75 to 100 feet.\n\nMM Wertheim and Breguet have propagated sound over the wire of an electric telegraph at the rate of 11,454 feet per second.\n\nDISTANCE AT WHICH THE HUMAN VOICE MAY BE HEARD.\n\nExperience shows that the human voice, under favourable circumstances, is capable of filling a larger space than was ever28 probably enclosed within the walls of a single room. Lieutenant Foster, on Parryâs third Arctic expedition, found that he could converse with a man across the harbour of Port Bowen, a distance of 6696 feet, or about one mile and a quarter. Dr. Young records that at Gibraltar the human voice has been heard at a distance of ten miles. If sound be prevented from spreading and losing itself in the air, either by a pipe or an extensive flat surface, as a wall or still water, it may be conveyed to a great distance. Biot heard a flute clearly through a tube of cast-iron (the water-pipes of Paris) 3120 feet long: the lowest whisper was distinctly heard; indeed, the only way not to be heard was not to speak at all.\n\nTHE ROAR OF NIAGARA.\n\nThe very nature of the sound of running water pronounces its origin to be the bursting of bubbles: the impact of water against water is a comparatively subordinate cause, and could never of itself occasion the murmur of a brook; whereas, in streams which Dr. Tyndall has examined, he, in all cases where a ripple was heard, discovered bubbles caused by the broken column of water. Now, were Niagara continuous, and without lateral vibration, it would be as silent as a cataract of ice. In all probability, it has its âcontracted sections,â after passing which it is broken into detached masses, which, plunging successively upon the air-bladders formed by their precursors, suddenly liberate their contents, and thus create the thunder of the waterfall.\n\nFIGURES PRODUCED BY SOUND.\n\nStretch a sheet of wet paper over the mouth of a glass tumbler which has a footstalk, and glue or paste the paper at the edges. When the paper is dry, strew dry sand thinly upon its surface. Place the tumbler on a table, and hold immediately above it, and parallel to the paper, a plate of glass, which you also strew with sand, having previously rubbed the edges smooth with emery powder. Draw a violin-bow along any part of the edges; and as the sand upon the glass is made to vibrate, it will form various figures, which will be accurately imitated by the sand upon the paper; or if a violin or flute be played within a few inches of the paper, they will cause the sand upon its surface to form regular lines and figures.\n\nTHE TUNING-FORK A FLUTE-PLAYER.\n\nTake a common tuning-fork, and on one of its branches fasten with sealing-wax a circular piece of card of the size of a small wafer, or sufficient nearly to cover the aperture of a pipe, as the sliding of the upper end of a flute with the mouth29 stopped: it may be tuned in unison with the loaded tuning-fork by means of the movable stopper or card, or the fork may be loaded till the unison is perfect. Then set the fork in vibration by a blow on the unloaded branch, and hold the card closely over the mouth of the pipe, as in the engraving, when a note of surprising clearness and strength will be heard. Indeed a flute may be made to âspeakâ perfectly well, by holding close to the opening a vibrating tuning-fork, while the fingering proper to the note of the fork is at the same time performed.\n\nTHEORY OF THE JEWâS HARP.\n\nIf you cause the tongue of this little instrument to vibrate, it will produce a very low sound; but if you place it before a cavity (as the mouth) containing a column of air, which vibrates much faster, but in the proportion of any simple multiple, it will then produce other higher sounds, dependent upon the reciprocation of that portion of the air. Now the bulk of air in the mouth can be altered in its form, size, and other circumstances, so as to produce by reciprocation many different sounds; and these are the sounds belonging to the Jewâs Harp.\n\nA proof of this fact has been given by Mr. Eulenstein, who fitted into a long metallic tube a piston, which being moved, could be made to lengthen or shorten the efficient column of air within at pleasure. A Jewâs Harp was then so fixed that it could be made to vibrate before the mouth of the tube, and it was found that the column of air produced a series of sounds, according as it was lengthened or shortened; a sound being produced whenever the length of the column was such that its vibrations were a multiple of those of the Jewâs Harp.\n\nSOLAR AND ARTIFICIAL LIGHT COMPARED.\n\nThe most intensely ignited solid (produced by the flame of Lieutenant Drummondâs oxy-hydrogen lamp directed against a surface of chalk) appears only as black spots on the disc of the sun, when held between it and the eye; or in other words, Drummondâs light is to the light of the sunâs disc as 1 to 146. Hence we are doubly struck by the felicity with which Galileo, as early as 1612, by a series of conclusions on the smallness of the distance from the sun at which the disc of Venus was no longer visible to the naked eye, arrived at the result that the blackest nucleus of the sunâs spots was more luminous than the brightest portions of the full moon. (See âThe Sunâs Light compared with Terrestrial Lights,â in Things not generally Known, pp. 4, 5.)\n\nSOURCE OF LIGHT.\n\nMr. Robert Hunt, in a lecture delivered by him at the Russell Institution, âOn the Physics of a Sunbeam,â mentions30 some experiments by Lord Brougham on the sunbeam, in which, by placing the edge of a sharp knife just within the limit of the light, the ray was inflected from its previous direction, and coloured red; and when another knife was placed on the opposite side, it was deflected, and the colour was blue. These experiments (says Mr. Hunt) seem to confirm Sir Isaac Newtonâs theory, that light is a fluid emitted from the sun.\n\nTHE UNDULATORY SCALE OF LIGHT.\n\nThe white light of the sun is well known to be composed of several coloured rays; or rather, according to the theory of undulations, when the rate at which a ray vibrates is altered, a different sensation is produced upon the optic nerve. The analytical examination of this question shows that to produce a red colour the ray of light must give 37,640 undulations in an inch, and 458,000,000,000,000 in a second. Yellow light requires 44,000 undulations in an inch, and 535,000,000,000,000 in a second; whilst the effect of blue results from 51,110 undulations within an inch, and 622,000,000,000,000 of waves in a second of time.—Huntâs Poetry of Science.\n\nVISIBILITY OF OBJECTS.\n\nIn terrestrial objects, the form, no less than the modes of illumination, determines the magnitude of the smallest angle of vision for the naked eye. Adams very correctly observed that a long and slender staff can be seen at a much greater distance than a square whose sides are equal to the diameter of the staff. A stripe may be distinguished at a greater distance than a spot, even when both are of the same diameter.\n\nThe minimum optical visual angle at which terrestrial objects can be recognised by the naked eye has been gradually estimated lower and lower, from the time when Robert Hooke fixed it exactly at a full minute, and Tobias Meyer required 34â³ to perceive a black speck on white paper, to the period of Leuwenhoeckâs experiments with spidersâ threads, which are visible to ordinary sight at an angle of 4â³Â·7. In Hueckâs most accurate experiments on the problem of the movement of the crystalline lens, white lines on a black ground were seen at an angle of 1â³Â·2; a spiderâs thread at 0â³Â·6; and a fine glistening wire at scarcely 0â³Â·2.\n\nHumboldt, when at Chillo, near Quito, where the crests of the volcano of Pichincha lay at a horizontal distance of 90,000 feet, was much struck by the circumstance that the Indians standing near distinguished the figure of Bonpland (then on an expedition to the volcano), as a white point moving on the black basaltic sides of the rock, sooner than Humboldt could discover him with a telescope. Bonpland was enveloped in a white cotton poncho: assuming the breadth across the shoulders to vary from three to five feet, according as the mantle clung31 to the figure or fluttered in the breeze, and judging from the known distance, the angle at which the moving object could be distinctly seen varied from 7â³ to 12â³. White objects on a black ground are, according to Hueck, distinguished at a greater distance than black objects on a white ground.\n\nGaussâs heliotrope light has been seen with the naked eye reflected from the Brocken on Hobenhagen at a distance of about 227,000 feet, or more than 42 miles; being frequently visible at points in which the apparent breadth of a three-inch mirror was only 0â³Â·43.\n\nTHE SMALLEST BRIGHT BODIES.\n\nEhrenberg has found from experiments on the dust of diamonds, that a diamond superficies of 1/100th of a line in diameter presents a much more vivid light to the naked eye than one of quicksilver of the same diameter. On pressing small globules of quicksilver on a glass micrometer, he easily obtained smaller globules of the 1/100th to the 1/2000th of a line in diameter. In the sunshine he could only discern the reflection of light, and the existence of such globules as were 1/300th of a line in diameter, with the naked eye. Smaller ones did not affect his eye; but he remarked that the actual bright part of the globule did not amount to more than 1/900th of a line in diameter. Spider threads of 1/2000th in diameter were still discernible from their lustre. Ehrenberg concludes that there are in organic bodies magnitudes capable of direct proof which are in diameter 1/100000 of a line; and others, that can be indirectly proved, which may be less than a six-millionth part of a Parisian line in diameter.\n\nVELOCITY OF LIGHT.\n\nIt is scarcely possible so to strain the imagination as to conceive the Velocity with which Light travels. âWhat mere assertion will make any man believe,â asks Sir John Herschel, âthat in one second of time, in one beat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of light travels over 192,000 miles; and would therefore perform the tour of the world in about the same time that it requires to wink with our eyelids, and in much less time than a swift runner occupies in taking a single stride?â Were a cannon-ball shot directly towards the sun, and were it to maintain its full speed, it would be twenty years in reaching it; and yet light travels through this space in seven or eight minutes.\n\nThe result given in the Annuaire for 1842 for the velocity of light in a second is 77,000 leagues, which corresponds to 215,834 miles; while that obtained at the Pulkowa Observatory is 189,746 miles. William Richardson gives as the result of the passage of light from the sun to the earth 8Â´ 19â³Â·28, from which we obtain a velocity of 215,392 miles in a second.—Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, vol. iv.\n\n32 In other words, light travels a distance equal to eight times the circumference of the earth between two beats of a clock. This is a prodigious velocity; but the measure of it is very certain.—Professor Airy.\n\nThe navigator who has measured the earthâs circuit by his hourly progress, or the astronomer who has paced a degree of the meridian, can alone form a clear idea of velocity, when we tell him that light moves through a space equal to the circumference of the earth in the eighth part of a second—in the twinkling of an eye.\n\nCould an observer, placed in the centre of the earth, see this moving light, as it describes the earthâs circumference, it would appear a luminous ring; that is, the impression of the light at the commencement of its journey would continue on the retina till the light had completed its circuit. Nay, since the impression of light continues longer than the fourth part of a second, two luminous rings would be seen, provided the light made two rounds of the earth, and in paths not coincident.\n\nAPPARATUS FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF LIGHT.\n\nHumboldt enumerates the following different methods adopted for the Measurement of Light: a comparison of the shadows of artificial lights, differing in numbers and distance; diaphragms; plane-glasses of different thickness and colour; artificial stars formed by reflection on glass spheres; the juxtaposition of two seven-feet telescopes, separated by a distance which the observer could pass in about a second; reflecting instruments in which two stars can be simultaneously seen and compared, when the telescope has been so adjusted that the star gives two images of like intensity; an apparatus having (in front of the object-glass) a mirror and diaphragms, whose rotation is measured on a ring; telescopes with divided object-glasses, on either half of which the stellar light is received through a prism; astrometers, in which a prism reflects the image of the moon or Jupiter, and concentrates it through a lens at different distances into a star more or less bright.—Cosmos, vol. iii.\n\nHOW FIZEAU MEASURED THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT.\n\nThis distinguished physicist has submitted the Velocity of Light to terrestrial measurement by means of an ingeniously constructed apparatus, in which artificial light (resembling stellar light), generated from oxygen and hydrogen, is made to pass back, by means of a mirror, over a distance of 28,321 feet to the same point from which it emanated. A disc, having 720 teeth, which made 12Â·6 rotations in a second, alternately obscured the ray of light and allowed it to be seen between the teeth on the margin. It was supposed, from the marking of a counter, that the artificial light traversed 56,64233 feet, or the distance to and from the stations, in 1/1800th part of a second, whence we obtain a velocity of 191,460 miles in a second.12 This result approximates most closely to Delambreâs (which was 189,173 miles), as obtained from Jupiterâs satellites.\n\nThe invention of the rotating mirror is due to Wheatstone, who made an experiment with it to determine the velocity of the propagation of the discharge of a Leyden battery. The most striking application of the idea was made by Fizeau and Foucault, in 1853, in carrying out a proposition made by Arago, soon after the invention of the mirror: we have here determined in a distance of twelve feet no less than the velocity with which light is propagated, which is known to be nearly 200,000 miles a second; the distance mentioned corresponds therefore to the 77-millionth part of a second. The object of these measurements was to compare the velocity of light in air with its velocity in water; which, when the length is greater, is not sufficiently transparent. The most complete optical and mechanical aids are here necessary: the mirror of Foucault made from 600 to 800 revolutions in a second, while that of Fizeau performed 1200 to 1500 in the same time.—Prof. Helmholtz on the Methods of Measuring very small Portions of Time.\n\nWHAT IS DONE BY POLARISATION OF LIGHT.\n\nMalus, in 1808, was led by a casual observation of the light of the setting sun, reflected from the windows of the Palais de Luxembourg, at Paris, to investigate more thoroughly the phenomena of double refraction, of ordinary and of chromatic polarisation, of interference and of diffraction of light. Among his results may be reckoned the means of distinguishing between direct and reflected light; the power of penetrating, as it were, into the constitution of the body of the sun and of its luminous envelopes; of measuring the pressure of atmospheric strata, and even the smallest amount of water they contain; of ascertaining the depths of the ocean and its rocks by means of a tourmaline plate; and in accordance with Newtonâs prediction, of comparing the chemical composition of several substances with their optical effects.\n\nArago, in a letter to Humboldt, states that by the aid of his polariscope, he discovered, before 1820, that the light of all terrestrial objects in a state of incandescence, whether they be solid or liquid, is natural, so long as it emanates from the object in perpendicular rays. On the other hand, if such light emanate at an acute angle, it presents manifest proofs of polarisation. This led M. Arago to the remarkable conclusion, that light is not generated on the surface of bodies only, but that some portion is actually engendered within the substance itself, even in the case of platinum.\n\nA ray of light which reaches our eyes after traversing many millions of miles, from, the remotest regions of heaven, announces, as it were of itself, in the polariscope, whether it is34 reflected or refracted, whether it emanates from a solid or fluid or gaseous body; it announces even the degree of its intensity.—Humboldtâs Cosmos, vols. i. and ii.\n\nMINUTENESS OF LIGHT.\n\nThere is something wonderful, says Arago, in the experiments which have led natural philosophers legitimately to talk of the different sides of a ray of light; and to show that millions and millions of these rays can simultaneously pass through the eye of a needle without interfering with each other!\n\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF LIGHT.\n\nLight affects the respiration of animals just as it affects the respiration of plants. This is novel doctrine, but it is demonstrable. In the day-time we expire more carbonic acid than during the night; a fact known to physiologists, who explain it as the effect of sleep: but the difference is mainly owing to the presence or absence of sunlight; for sleep, as sleep, increases, instead of diminishing, the amount of carbonic acid expired, and a man sleeping will expire more carbonic acid than if he lies quietly awake under the same conditions of light and temperature; so that if less is expired during the night than during the day, the reason cannot be sleep, but the absence of light. Now we understand why men are sickly and stunted who live in narrow streets, alleys, and cellars, compared with those who, under similar conditions of poverty and dirt, live in the sunlight.—Blackwoodâs Edinburgh Magazine, 1858.\n\nThe influence of light on the colours of organised creation is well shown in the sea. Near the shores we find seaweeds of the most beautiful hues, particularly on the rocks which are left dry by the tides; and the rich tints of the actiniÃ¦ which inhabit shallow water must often have been observed. The fishes which swim near the surface are also distinguished by the variety of their colours, whereas those which live at greater depths are gray, brown, or black. It has been found that after a certain depth, where the quantity of light is so reduced that a mere twilight prevails, the inhabitants of the ocean become nearly colourless.—Huntâs Poetry of Science.\n\nACTION OF LIGHT ON MUSCULAR FIBRES.\n\nThat light is capable of acting on muscular fibres, independently of the influence of the nerves, was mentioned by several of the old anatomists, but repudiated by later authorities. M. Brown SÃ©quard has, however, proved to the Royal Society that some portions of muscular fibre—the iris of the eye, for example—are affected by light independently of any reflex action of the nerves, thereby confirming former experiences. The effect is produced by the illuminating rays only, the chemical and heat rays remaining neutral. And not least remarkable is the fact,35 that the iris of an eel showed itself susceptible of the excitement sixteen days after the eyes were removed from the creatureâs head. So far as is yet known, this muscle is the only one on which light thus takes effect.—Phil. Trans. 1857.\n\nLIGHT NIGHTS.\n\nIt is not possible, as well-attested facts prove, perfectly to explain the operations at work in the much-contested upper boundaries of our atmosphere. The extraordinary lightness of whole nights in the year 1831, during which small print might be read at midnight in the latitudes of Italy and the north of Germany, is a fact directly at variance with all that we know, according to the most recent and acute researches on the crepuscular theory and the height of the atmosphere.—Biot.\n\nPHOSPHORESCENCE OF PLANTS.\n\nMr. Hunt recounts these striking instances. The leaves of the Ånothera macrocarpa are said to exhibit phosphoric light when the air is highly charged with electricity. The agarics of the olive-grounds of Montpelier too have been observed to be luminous at night; but they are said to exhibit no light, even in darkness, during the day.
