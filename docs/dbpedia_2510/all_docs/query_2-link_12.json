Musings over a coffee about the potential for a project on periodical press history turned into a multivolume proposal to survey the history of British and Irish press history from its inception in the seventeenth century through to the present, which I then pursued with my colleague Martin Conboy at the University of Sheffield. I agreed to take on editing the nineteenth-century volume of the proposed series we developed. Little did I know that it would take six years, multiple workshops, conferences and working group meetings, as well as multiple rounds of editorial shaping, to bring this volume to fruition. Much support from a number of colleagues also helped at key moments during my sojourn into the voluminous world of the nineteenth-century media, and I am grateful to the British Academy for providing funding for an early career researcher workshop on ‘Communication and Knowledge 1620–1900: The Atlantic and its Continents’, held in Dundee in March 2014, at which preliminary planning work was done for this initiative. Thanks also are due to former colleagues Bob Carr and Suzanne Spalding at the Centre for Open Learning, University of Edinburgh, who worked with me to organise ‘Communities of Communication II: Newspapers and Periodicals in Britain and Ireland from 1800 to 1900’, a two-day conference at the University of Edinburgh in September 2015 that featured many fine presentations subsequently expanded into chapters featured in this volume. I am grateful to the contributors who agreed to join me in mapping out the contours of media and press production over a key moment of British and Irish cultural expansion and evolution, and with whom I have had the pleasure of editing and seeing into print. It has been an exciting journey. Finally, xix\n\nxx\n\nacknowledgements\n\nit behoves me to thank those who have provided permission to reproduce the images featured in this volume.

Murray had built up his family firm through astute management of literary property: he had been responsible for turning Lord Byron into a household commodity, selling his volumes of poetry as fast as they could be printed; he had championed Jane Austen, who brought her greatest works to him for publication; and he had instituted the Quarterly Review in 1809, which had become a leading Conservative voice in the periodical press world. Now he was being asked to invest in a new venture, a daily newspaper to be called the Representative, set to stand as a Conservative counterpoint to the more Whiggish London Times. The man pitching the idea was young firebrand Benjamin Disraeli, who promised to find half the start-up capital needed if Murray would front the other half. Disraeli sought but failed to get Walter Scott’s Scottish born-and-bred son-in-law, editor and writer John Gibson Lockhart, to take on the editorship role, though Lockhart did accede to playing a consultancy role while taking up editorship of Murray’s Quarterly Review instead. A number of less qualified individuals were called on to fill the gap, with the polymath Irishman William Maginn providing crucial interventions as an overseas correspondent, provider of copy, and then manager of the newspaper’s production. Money was lavishly poured into launching the new press entrant on 26 January 1826, but it soon became apparent that this Conservative voice was not of interest to the paying public, and that Disraeli was signally unable to manage the running of the paper. It did not help that it was launched in the face of opposition by two 1\n\n2\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nkey players of the Conservative government then in power, the Foreign Secretary George Canning, and the First Secretary to the Admiralty John Wilson Croker. It also fought headwinds occasioned by the financial crash of 1825–6, where overburdened debt structures and risky investments in overseas shares, bonds and government loan schemes collapsed and brought down a great number of financiers, investors, printers, publishers and press outlets. In these circumstances, and haemorrhaging money, John Murray faced financial ruin. As recorded in an 1829 issue of the Spirit of the Age, John Murray was found wandering the streets one evening in great despair. Worse for wear from drink, he was asked if he wanted a coach to take him home. ‘No, damn me Sir,’ he is said to have shouted, ‘I want an Editor!’ Murray extricated himself from the situation by closing down the newspaper after six months of operation, absorbing financial losses of almost £26,000. His publishing business survived to thrive into the twenty-first century. Disraeli moved on to forge a career in politics, but not before penning the satirical roman à clef Vivian Grey (1826–7), in which the tale of this failed endeavour was replayed (to his favour), and Murray was mercilessly lampooned. Maginn carried on with journalistic work, interspersing occasional editing roles for provincial town newspapers with London-based press activity. The incident marks a side note to the careers of the key players in the rise and fall of this 1820s short-lived paper, and has been fully explored in recent studies of Disraeli and Maginn (Akel 2016; Latané 2013). But key points about this moment are relevant to the volume on nineteenth-century press history you are now reading. For a start, though based in London, the Representative was a product of trans­ regional cooperation, financed and lightly overseen by Scots, absentmindedly edited by an Englishman of varied religious upbringing, supported by an Irish ‘man of letters’ and press veteran, and opposed by a cabal of high-ranking Conservative players in the London political establishment. Though Murray was the proprietor/publisher, he was not its printer, an assignment reserved to the London-based firm of William Clowes, early adopters of the steam powered Applegarth presses developed by Englishmen Augustus Applegarth and Edward Cowper, and who, by 1840, had become owners of the largest printing works in the world, with over twenty-five mechanised steam presses in constant use (Clowes 1953: 37). The money used to underwrite the venture was drawn from profits generated by Murray’s publishing stable of periodical press publications, literary works, poetry books and other generic titles. In other words, it was a meshing of multi-regional interests, talents, experiences, industry, new technology and print\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\ntrade income, exemplifying in microcosm the fluid and interlinked nature of press and periodical interaction across nineteenth-century Britain and Ireland. At various points over the last 400 years, key political, economic and social processes have worked to hinder or promote the expansion and dissemination via newspapers and periodicals of information across Britain and Ireland. The nineteenth century provides an apposite frame from which to consider the economics of press and periodical production in Britain and Ireland. The nineteenth century was subject to significant development and innovation in a number of fields linked to the production, consumption, and social and political role of the media. The period also represents the large part of the political union of Britain and Ireland (1801–1922), supporting investigation of how far their presses can be considered similarly connected organisationally, commercially and economically. Past discussions of the nineteenth-century British and Irish press have focused mainly on the daily press as political spaces shaping cultural and social infrastructures (Curran and Seaton 1991; Koss 1981, 1984, 1990). It is only recently that the term ‘the press’ has broadened to include other forms of journalistic endeavours beyond daily or weekly newspaper journalism. Such broadening enables clearer understanding of the role played by the swathe of focused weeklies, monthlies and specialist press publications in fomenting and supporting other types of engagement across underrepresented readership over the course of the century. One of the key drivers behind this volume is a desire to extend the thinking about what constitutes the nineteenth-century press, and to move discussions beyond a general focus on metropolitan news and information circuits. There are currently no studies in the field offering a broad enquiry and critique of the nineteenth-century newspaper press and periodicals that links both Britain and Ireland. Some studies concentrate on discrete periods or themes, others on particular regions or nations, and others site the press within a broader range of media. Chris Morash’s A History of the Media in Ireland (2012), for example, is a wide-ranging study with a proper national focus, but with an entwining of nineteenth-century press work and twentiethcentury media forms. Focused studies on either Irish and English nineteenth-century press history do exist, including Marie Louise Legg’s Newspapers and Nationalism: The Irish Provincial Press, 1850– 1892 (1999), Victoria Gardner’s The Business of News in England, 1760–1820 (2016) and Andrew Hobbs’s A Fleet Street in Every Town: The Power of the Provincial Press, 1855–1900 (2018). One has to reach\n\n4\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nfurther back to find similar studies of Welsh- and Scottish-focused press history, including Aled Jones’s Press, Politics and Society: A History of Journalism in Wales (1993), William Donaldson’s Popular Literature in Victorian Scotland: Language, Fiction and the Press (1986) and Robert Cowan’s The Newspaper in Scotland: A Study of Its First Expansion, 1815–1860 (1946). Nevertheless, in terms of the longer-term continuities and impacts across national and regional borders proposed here, these surveys offer a restricted view of the evolution of the general nineteenth-century newspaper and periodical form that could embrace the entirety of Britain and Ireland. In response to this gap, this volume offers a fully comprehensive, research-led, interdisciplinary examination of nineteenth-century British and Irish newspaper and periodical history during a key period of change and development. It covers an important point of expansion in periodical and press history across the four nations of Great Britain (England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales), concentrating on how ­nineteenth-century print communication can be accessed via crossborder comparisons and contrasts. It is designed to provide readers with a clear understanding of the current state of research in the field, drawing on contemporary methodologies, demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of work in this area, and offering an indication of themes ripe for further investigation. The impact on the field of digital media and new archival approaches also informs discussions, with examples by contributors such as M. H. Beals, Colette Colligan and Jessie Wilkie drawing on significant datasets to anchor their arguments about the scope and reach of press activity across international borders. This field of research has wider intellectual implications than is sometimes realised. Media and press history are interdisciplinary areas of enquiry, encompassing research into literacy and reading practices, relations among publisher-proprietors, editors, contributors and readers, and analysis of new technology and evolving communication networks. The interdisciplinary demands of such research widen its importance beyond the specialist historian and the general field of journalism studies, encompassing material of significance to other academic fields, such as social, political and cultural history, business and intellectual history, the history of international innovation in technology, literary culture, material culture and social history. This volume, and the multivolume series in which it is embedded, seeks to add to these conversations with insights into press trade connections between Scotland, Ireland, Wales and England, and their extensions to European and trans-oceanic and transnational counterparts. It also highlights matters related to national and transnational identities,\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nmigration, skills and knowledge exchange, and the place of such texts in a globalised marketplace. The volume is organised so as to encourage contributions across regions, linking up findings and material thematically, and ensuring consistency in approach. To start, there are four themed sections focusing on key areas of press and periodical development, with keystone chapters covering the economics of the press and periodicals, insights into production, analysis of nineteenth-century readership and distribution networks, and in-depth examinations of legal frameworks under which the press operated. They offer close-grained examinations of the responses of the trade to social, political and cultural challenges over the centuries, including issues related to censorship, new organisational initiatives, and technological innovation. Particular attention is also paid to the rate, scope and nature of the adoption of new technologies in typesetting, printing and illustrations within print media contexts. Similarly, time is spent discussing the newspaper and periodical press as a physical artefact, and visual culture and the place of graphic design, illustration and technological developments in newspaper and periodical press production. Following these keystone chapters are thirty-eight chapters and case studies that explore a full range of press activity and press genres during this intense period of change. They include examinations of religious, literary, political, business, trade, satirical, illustrated, leisure, sporting, scientific and medical press genres, as well as analyses of provincial press activities, emerging developments in children’s and women’s press genres, and diasporic, overseas, ethnic-language and émigré press work. It is a truism to state that press history inevitably reflects the wider historical and social contexts within which such material was produced. The nineteenth century was exceptional in terms of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh print communication expansion. It bore witness to great social change, a widening expansion of overseas linkages, and the move of print and the press to a central position in social, political and cultural terms. At the start of the century, press outputs and numbers were limited, labouring under severe legal restrictions and government censorship, high production costs, and low readership numbers confined to elites and literate citizens with expendable income. Matters began changing from the 1820s, with press and periodical publications flowing through into the marketplace in response to new political movements, technological innovation and audience expectations. The evolution of press and periodical publishing enterprises over the course of the century are explored in Howard Cox and Simon Mowatt’s chapter on the economics of the press. As they point\n\n6\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nout, the history of press business expansion during this period is a narrative demonstrating a move from small, family-owned enterprises at the start of the century to end-of-century domination by capital-­­ intensive, vertically integrated limited-liability companies. Early-century newspapers and periodicals were produced in the face of stringent legal regulations imposed by the British government following civil unrest, due to war conditions and economic hardship in the first two decades of the century, and the fallout from the Peterloo ‘massacre’ of 1819. There were, in addition, a range of legal changes in the nineteenth century which bore directly on the press, to do with subjects such as court reporting, censorship, obscenity, contract and copyright. But paradoxically, as Tom O’Malley explores in his chapter on the law, while the press became ostensibly freer from state control, it became progressively entangled with rights and constraints emanating from the state, at a time when communications were central to the way in which people experienced the state, and the state interacted with the daily lives of the population. Critics such as William Hazlitt, however, could not help noticing that, in spite of state-imposed restrictions and financial strictures during the first quarter of the century, by the 1820s press publications had begun moving towards more entrepreneurial and audience-focused means of disseminating news and ideas. In his well-known 1823 contribution to the Edinburgh Review, ‘The Periodical Press’, Hazlitt called on writers and editors to recognise this new state of affairs, commenting, We must look to the public for support. Instead of solemn testimonies from the learned, we require the smiles of the fair and the polite. If princes scowl upon us, the broad shining face of the people may turn to us with a favourable aspect. Is not this life (too) sweet? Would we change it for the former if we could? But the great point is, that we cannot! Therefore, let Reviews flourish – let Magazines increase and multiply – let the Daily and Weekly Newspapers live forever! (Hazlitt 1823, repr. 1930–4: 220) Such expectations increased from the mid-century onwards, as a cornucopia of less expensive general and special-interest titles, catering to a greatly engaged and expanded reading public, began vying for space on crowded retail shelves, enabled by lower production costs, technological advances and societal embrace of print as a key communication tool. The gradual diminution of government taxes on paper, ink and press outputs in face of a changing political and social canvas also played a part in this surge. Surveying the possibilities opened up by press expansion in December 1844, the commentator John\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nCampbell spoke for many in foreseeing that such changes were unstoppable and linked to progress: ‘Cheap periodicals belong to the age of the railway!’ he declaimed, continuing, ‘Every man, then, to his taste; Gothic things for Gothic men; but light postage, quick transit, cheap Bibles and cheap Periodicals, for the Millions of England!’ (Campbell 1844: vii–viii). Mass changes of this sort were also aided by exponential rises in British and Irish print specialists trained and eager to support local and regional press and print needs. In Britain and Ireland, there was a shift from a concentration of press activity in a small number of urban centres to wider, diffuse networks of locally and regionally based jobbing print businesses. The labour historians Sidney and Beatrice Webb described the results in 1897 in their ground-breaking study Industrial Democracy: The printing trade, on the other hand, once concentrated in half a dozen towns, has to-day crept into every village, the vast majority of printing offices being tiny enterprises of small working masters. The compositor, moreover, has to deal with a variety of employers, from the London daily newspaper or the great publishers’ printer, down to the stationer’s shop in a country town or the fore man of a subsidiary department of a railway company, wholesale grocer or manufacturer of india rubber stamps. (Webb 1897: 465) Many press operators ventured overseas in answer to calls by new ­settlements for skilled artisans able to promote their towns to the wider world. As one contemporary memoirist recalled, such communities needed help in attracting residents and in supporting growth: ‘It was not at all uncommon,’ they noted, ‘where no printer appeared to start a newspaper for such a budding community, for the citizens or promoters of the prospective city to assume the financial obligations entailed in order to encourage some member of the craft to set up a press and to give the location publicity’ (quoted in Finkelstein 2018: 17). Likewise, expatriate and English-speaking communities based in continental Europe, Asia and South America sought outlets capable of keeping them abreast of news, culture and occurrences where feasible, as documented by M. H. Beals, Amelia Bonea, Diana Cooper-Richet and Paul Raphael Rooney within this volume. The mid-century onwards witnessed the full absorption of press and print into the British and Irish cultural mainstream. News and periodical production moved from early-century censorship, suppression and attempts to limit information in wake of French revolution, the rise of Bonaparte and social agitation linked to economic hardship,\n\n8\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nto mid-century endorsement of the press as a means of integrating and harnessing social movements within a burgeoning industrialised nation, to an end-of-century use of the press as a demotic, readershipfocused and financially based commodity. Andrew King’s chapter on the trade press offers details of the exponential rise in titles printed across the four kingdoms from the mid-century onwards in the wake of such advancement. Contemporary press directories, though not reliable, give a general idea of the sharp rise during this period in numbers of press titles, particularly after the abolishment of lingering ‘taxes on knowledge’ in the late 1850s. In the 1850 Hammond’s directory, for example, there were listed 547 newspaper titles that had been produced that year (Hammond’s 1850: 20). By 1900, numbers had more than quadrupled, with Mitchell’s Directory listing 1,947 newspapers and 2,328 periodicals in operation that year (Mitchell’s Directory 1900). On a more holistic note, John North, the general editor of one of the most comprehensive attempts to map out the number of newspapers and periodicals produced in Scotland, Ireland and England (Waterloo Directory of English, Irish and Scottish Newspapers and Periodicals, 1800–1900), has published evidence of over 3,900 Irish titles, 7,300 Scottish titles and over 100,000 English titles still extant in archival collections that were produced over the course of the century, many of them short lived (North Waterloo Directory). Many other titles undoubtedly remain unknown and unaccounted for, having perished in years of conflict, been discarded, or lost without trace. While this volume cannot reclaim all such material as part of press history, one of its remits is to challenge the artificial divide that in the past has governed the use of the terms ‘the press’ (seen primarily as relating to daily and weekly newspapers, geared to reporting on current events, politics and social mores) and the ‘periodical press’ (evoking print outputs of less immediate currency or frequency, such as monthlies and quarterlies, geared to chronicling cultural, literary, trade or niche genre interests). This hierarchy of values, as Joanne Shattock points out in her chapter on cultural agents, also reflected class and professional distinctions that came into play regarding editorial functions, authorial contributions and social distinctions between journalistic ‘hacks’ and men and women ‘of letters’. The move from a tightly controlled state to more open state governance, benefiting from a widened franchise and taxation base, and a society engaging with increasing industrialisation and urbanisation, stimulated the interests of increasing, politically engaged working and middle classes. Coupled with major improvements in literacy rates, the political, social and economic developments of the period linked into\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\na wider audience interested in more varied press outputs. Legislative and technical developments enabled the British and Irish press to meet this growing demand. The reduction and eventual repeal of the ‘taxes on knowledge’ (advertising duty, excise duty on paper, and stamp duty on newspapers) between the 1830s and late 1850s provided for the beginnings of an affordable popular press. The growth of national and international railway networks from the 1830s onwards, noted in Paul Raphael Rooney’s chapter for this volume, improved distribution and communications speeds and delivery. The introduction of the rotary press in the 1860s supported increased and cost-effective production. The 1869 Electric Telegraph Act nationalised the domestic communications infrastructure by which the press transmitted and gathered information, which, in association with the growth and development of news agencies such as the Press Association and Reuters, connected them to a burgeoning international cable network. These developments provided a cost-effective means of gathering and producing news that grew substantially after the government of Lord Palmerston repealed stamp duty in 1855. The increased production and consumption of British and Irish press and periodicals during the second half of the nineteenth century placed its owners, managers and editors in increasingly influential positions with regard to politics and economics of the United Kingdom. The growing market for their output also led to a diversification in the form of news. Political and commercial information was augmented with sports, leisure and literary material. Women became a focus as consumers of media through advertising and content, and as producers in their own right, though frequently at reduced wages compared to their male counterparts, a point brought out in Joanne Shattock’s chapter on cultural agents, and Kathryn Ledbetter’s chapter on the women’s press. A growth in advertising likewise ensured a diversity, range and independence in news reporting, especially in the nineteenth-century regional press, as Peter Robinson points out in his case study on newspapers and advertising. It allowed press outlets to move beyond a need for patronage to ensure financial stability, to a financial model driven by access to and promotion of local enterprise. The connection between newspapers and advertising became so strong in the nineteenth century that the term ‘Advertiser’ often formed one-half of a collocation involving frequency (most commonly ‘evening’, ‘daily’, ‘weekly’) and/or location (usually an industrial city). This accounted for titles such as the Manchester and Salford Advertiser and Chronicle, the Northern Star and Leeds General Advertiser and the Plymouth and\n\n10\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nCornwall Advertiser, to name some of the more important examples. Not only were many papers principally defined by their role in making the public aware of the availability of goods and services in their area, the revenue advertising generated was often instrumental to their birth, and fundamental to their survival. An increasing population, which was also becoming more literate, fed demand for a diversity of press outputs, and the nineteenth century saw changes in production techniques for both text and image, which improved the speed and efficiency of output to meet such demands. The course of the century witnessed larger capital investment in press production, and increased returns and profits as a result of this investment, as documented in Helen Williams’s chapter on press production. Williams outlines how speed and timeliness of production were always important, especially to the daily newspaper sector of the trade, and the introduction of iron steam presses, and other presses built on the rotary principle rather than sheet-fed machines, dramatically improved the output of the pressroom. Competition, divisions of labour within each press outlet to support new areas of discussion and reportage, and more complex managerial structures to oversee the results, fed into the need to further professionalise the industry. As a result, as Martin Conboy notes, ‘journalism moved from the margins of English society to a more economically lucrative and socially respectable position’ (Conboy 2004: 124–5).\n\nIllustration and Visual Culture The nineteenth century also saw changes in available methods of reproducing illustrations, with the invention and development of lithographic printing processes and, in the second half of the century, new photographic processes such as halftone and photogravure. Illustrations in the press became more numerous, although colour printing remained too complex and expensive for most purposes in the periodical trade. In her chapter on illustration, Rose Roberto demonstrates the way in which images in the nineteenth-century press were shaped by the Victorian urban experience, by increasing knowledge and desire to define and control the world, and by wider design practices created to cater for burgeoning business needs in local, national and international markets. To meet newspaper deadlines, press images needed to be produced quickly and cheaply. They also had to be striking enough to sell newspapers and journals. In response to these needs, the industry adopted relief methods of illustration such as wood engraving, photomechanical\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nprocesses and eventually photography, which could more easily integrate with text. As photography developed as an art form over the second half of the century, it influenced other methods of design and illustration production, with photographic-like bordered illustrations becoming standard practice in news pages, and engravers increasingly focusing on images with linear and tonal codes in realist styles. The rise of illustrations in journals also provided visual spaces in which readers could imagine and contextualise their understanding of contemporary society. The Illustrated London News self-servingly trumpeted eight months after its launch in 1842 that the popularity of visually rich press publications such as its own was proof of the interlinked power of image and text: ‘We discovered and opened up the world of Illustration as connected with News,’ it boasted, ‘and the quick-sighted and sound-judging British public peopled it at once’ (Illustrated London News, 6 January 1842). Developments over the next half-century ensured further advances in the illustrative powers of the press.\n\nOrganisation, Transportation and Distribution Such technological changes fed into organisational change within the print trade. As processes improved, and especially as they were mechanised, workers in the print trade and their organisations were forced, to some extent at least, into adopting new work practices. National unions for the print trade (stutteringly launched in the first third of the century), became more fully established from the 1840s onwards, and were strongest in the largest firms and print centres, particularly where daily and weekly newspaper production was concentrated. By 1900 the technologies and work practices surrounding print production had settled into a pattern that would continue through to the mid-twentieth century, where, and as Helen Williams notes, workspaces were managed through worker-led associations and structures, wages and piecework rates were keenly watched and enforced through strong union involvement, and there were clear demarcations of jobs undertaken by specialised labour forces defined by artisanal skills differences. Efficiencies of scale, speed and print production aligned alongside a shift in readership, access and public interest. Nineteenth-century newspaper reading public numbers expanded and diversified as the century advanced, and new genres of publication emerged to match diverse cultural, social, thematic interests and demand. The Education Acts of 1870 and 1871 implemented across England, Scotland and\n\n12\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nWales (and much later in Ireland in 1892), aimed at guaranteeing free educational opportunities for everyone under the age of sixteen, contributed to a social revolution that by the end of the century supported entrepreneurial circulation of a vast quantity of print and press material. Increased distribution of news and press products was facilitated by fee-paying circulating libraries, an expanded public library system, and railway-station news stalls established by W. H. Smith & Son in England and Wales, Eason & Son in Ireland and John Menzies in Scotland, as Paul Raphael Rooney covers in his chapter on readership and distribution. Alongside this came the development of a reliable postal and steam transport system to distribute print and press material across local and national borders. At the beginning of the century, although newsprint was taxed, news was allowed to be sent free by post, but the system of stamping newspapers was cumbersome and limited growth of press material. The great postal reform of 1840 greatly reduced the cost of personal correspondence. However, printed matter did not benefit from such reductions until a uniform ‘Book Post’ rates covering all print subscriptions was established in 1847, followed by further reductions in printed matter postal rates in 1870. Such reductions enabled publication subscriptions to become financially viable, supported wider distribution of press material, and stimulated the creation of the wide range of specialist magazines and journals documented in Andrew King’s chapter on the trade press.\n\nThe Professionalisation of Journalistic Practices Developments in press economies and technologies and an increased readership for new material called for the professionalisation of journalistic practices. Journalists and press commentators throughout the century, as Joanne Shattock, Andrew Hobbs and Stephen Tate note in their contributions for this volume, subjected their rapidly expanding industry and their emerging profession to great self-scrutiny and oversight. New reporting roles opened up for many seeking to rise in class and professional status, a point brought out in case study chapters by Stephen Tate on reporters and Steve Harrison on the development of the byline. Allison Cavanagh documents in her case study chapter on correspondence columns and Frederick Milton and Siân Pooley in their chapters on children’s press and correspondence columns respectively, how newspapers and press outlets began experimenting with ways of engaging with readers through the use of letters to the editor, a process that meshed with the socially responsive forms that marked\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n13\n\nthe rise of New Journalism in the 1880s, a rise documented by Philip March in his case study chapter for this volume. By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, journalism had become acknowledged as a profession in its own right, with professional organisations, industry-related courses and training guides available to inspire and guide potential recruits on best practices and skills. The increased market for news and information required a comparatively expanded workforce, which, in line with wider political and social developments, contributed to organising professional bodies such as the National Association of Journalists (founded in 1884) and later the National Union of Journalists (established in 1907). Women entrants to the profession, few throughout the first half of the century, slowly rose in numbers, particularly helped after the 1860s by increased opportunities to publish in the expanding periodical press field, points raised in Kathryn Ledbetter’s chapter on the women’s press. Towards the end of the century, further professional support would emerge through establishment of organisations such as the Society of Women Journalists (1893), and through the issuing of a growing number of training guides aimed specifically at women journalists. More generally, the industry also benefited from moves to certify and support training for professional examination processes, with institutions such as the London School of Journalism (1887) becoming established for such purposes.\n\nTransnational Exchanges and English-Language Communication Networks An important theme for this volume is the flow of press information across nineteenth-century international borders, with several chapters detailing how the English-language press operated in overseas spaces, how it influenced other national press discourses, and how it was conducted via communication networks supporting the flow of ideas and knowledge across space and time. In her survey chapter on English-language press activities across nineteenth-century continental Europe, Diana Cooper-Richet undertakes one of the first attempts to draw together general trends evident through studying the rise of such Continental print sources. The English-language newspapers published in continental Europe aimed to satisfy the needs of anglophone visitors and expatriate communities. Some, such as Galignani’s Messenger, a daily published in Paris from 1814 to 1895, were long lived and successful in retaining a strong readership base. The majority of such publications, however, tended to be short lived with modest circulation. At first mainly literary in content, or circulating information\n\n14\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\ngathered from other sources as part of what has been termed ‘scissors and paste’ or exchange journalism, such press outlets progressively evolved towards a more modern approach and integration of original journalism by the end of the century. There’s also consideration in this volume of nineteenth-century émigré press operations in Britain. Many European radical activists who faced persecution, arrest, imprisonment or worse fled to Britain for safety, particularly after the revolutionary period of 1848, which saw national movements and political interventions surge across a number of European states. Helen Williams documents in her case study chapter that, by 1850, Britain was home to émigrés of a range of nationalities, including French, German, Italian and Polish communities, who used it as a base for launching foreign-language newspapers and journals aimed at émigré communities in Britain and at readers in home countries. Williams covers one such narrative of press interaction involving the nineteenth-century Russian émigré press. It is a story providing an intriguing side-light on political movements and British attitudes to ‘aliens’ in the nineteenth century. Though few in number, Russian émigré press operatives were active from the 1850s onwards, with the most prominent being Alexander Herzen, who operated in London from 1853 through to the mid-1860s producing Russian-language newspapers, pamphlets and journals. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, others would come forward to publish English-language titles for such communities, with titles such as Free Russia produced with the aim of garnering support in Britain for Russian oppositional movements. A key link for both émigré press and the English-language transnational press was its international readership, a mix of original language, anglophone and expatriate subscribers who purchased and consumed such material, whether based in the Continent, in the Middle East, in India or in South America. Other connections could be found between international press outlets, periodicals published in Britain and Ireland, and Continental press editors who borrowed and exchanged essential parts of their editorial material from each other. Such borrowings feature in Cecilia Wadsö Lecaros’s case study chapter documenting British influences on the Swedish periodical press of the 1830s. Wadsö Lecaros offers insight into how Swedish access to periodical publications, emanating from the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (SDUK), proved instrumental in establishing Swedish periodicals aimed at educating their readers in similar didactic form. Importantly enough, the transnational exchange was to some extent reciprocal, with the SDUK in turn commissioning a number of\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\narticles about Sweden and Norway from its Swedish contacts for the Penny Cyclopaedia and for the Quarterly Journal of Education. These articles, focusing on Swedish and Norwegian geography and education, were published at a time when Scandinavia received little attention in the British press, and are suggestive of the two-way transactional flow of information that was common among press outlets of the period. M. H. Beals deepens our understanding of exchange agreements and transactional information sharing in her case study chapter on international communication networks. By the start of the twentieth century, communication networks connecting the local, regional, national and international presses of the world had become commonplace. But as Beals points out, its basis lay in the exchange agreements pioneered in the hundred years preceding, which allowed editors to reprint an unfathomable selection of news and literary content, chosen at their leisure from a vast number of possible sources. Access to such material increased immeasurably thanks to telegraphic communication innovations, and the copper wiring, stretched underwater and overland across continents and countries, that supported such international news transmission from mid-century onwards. As public demands rose for knowledge of news of foreign conquest and war, competition to supply it intensified, and press associations sprung up to provide their subscribers with the most up-to-date intelligence. By the end of the nineteenth century the fundamental landscape of transnational exchanges had shifted from a robust, decentralised network reliant on postal and courier transport to circulate information, to a highly centralised and telegraphic one, controlled by a small number of powerful commercial enterprises. Electronic connections spreading news instantaneously across multiple continents could shape news agendas, spread false information and shatter reputations. A case in point can be found in Colette Colligan’s case study chapter on the international coverage of Oscar Wilde’s trial for ‘gross Indecency’ in 1895, a sensational news story that was transmitted around the world and would feature in over seventy English- and foreign-language newspapers. The coverage, which at times spread and amplified misleading information in ways that crowded out accurate reportage, makes for interesting comparisons to twenty-first-century news systems and issues. How the story was seized upon and spread in the weeks following the trial is a salutary lesson on global press networks’ susceptibility to pressures of audience demands in an age of increasing connectivity. Steamships were vital conduits for moving print media internationally from port to port in the nineteenth century, and also functioned as\n\n16\n\ndavid finkelstein\n\nconnectors of British- and Irish-produced news to expatriate audiences in South Asia and the Antipodes. As Paul Raphael Rooney explores in his case study chapter on the steamship press, vivid examples such as the Home News for India, China, and the Colonies (1847–98), edited between 1867 and 1874 by Shirley Brooks, represented vital news sources within the nineteenth-century colonial press world, fostering an empire-wide exchange of ideas and ideologies in particular for colonial authorities based in such spaces, and linking centre and periphery in a two-way conversation. Not all British news circulation and communication networks involved uncontested movement between metropolitan centres and peripheral spaces. Amelia Bonea offers an important corrective to this formula, particularly in regard to British imperial forays into maritime Asia, identified here as the expanse of water stretching from the western coast of India through to China and Japan, via the Bay of Bengal and the China Seas. Colonial officials and mercantile communities based in such spaces required accurate knowledge of trade, commerce and political news specific to such regions. Before the advent of telegraphy in the mid-nineteenth century, such material was circulated from point to point via sailing ships and steamers plying these maritime spaces. However, the introduction of telegraphy to India in 1855, the establishment of the first telegraph routes between Britain and the Indian subcontinent a decade later, and the completion in 1871 of telegraphic communication routes with Japan via Siberia, Hong Kong and Shanghai, added new dimensions to the circulation of English-language information within Asia itself. An immense network of telegraph operators versed in transmission became woven into the newsgathering fabric of English-language press operators in the Asian and South-East Asian regions, with steamships then ensuring a wide circulation of the resulting printed outputs to regional subscribers.\n\nReview and Literary Journalism Throughout the nineteenth century, a significant proportion of press content in British and Irish periodicals, magazines and newspapers was devoted to book reviews and literary journalism. This was especially true of literary periodicals and magazines, many of which called themselves reviews, and which included ground-breaking (and longlived) early quarterlies such as the Edinburgh Review (founded in 1802), the Quarterly Review (launched in 1809) and the Westminster Review (started in 1824). Over the century, with advances in printing technology, the lifting of various taxes on newspapers, and the rise in\n\n­\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\na literate reading public, the number of publications devoted partly or wholly to reviewing grew exponentially. These included publications that appeared quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily. In tandem with these developments, needless to say, the number of editors and writers concerned with reviews and reviewing increased substantially as well. Joanne Wilkes demonstrates in her chapter on literary review journalism that a wide variety of genres ended up being discussed in such review spaces: although fiction was an important trend over the century, reviews also covered history, biography, art, poetry, religion, philosophy, politics, science, and (more so than in later centuries) classical and European literature. As a corollary, the generalist reviewer who could turn his or her hand to a wide variety of topics was an important participant in the reviewing field. As was common in general press work, reviews were largely published anonymously up to the 1860s, and in many outlets well beyond then. Often this practice was based on an intention by editors to present a general editorial ‘face’ to readers, whereby contributions would be seen as consonant with specific political, cultural or social stances espoused more generally across the journal itself. This would continue through to the 1860s, when the rise of the star author encouraged promotion of signed contributions to raise readership interest and journal sales. The focus on anonymity throughout the first half of the century, though, created paradoxical situations for female anonymous reviewers: anonymity enabled them to handle topics considered at the time beyond women’s competence, but it also hampered later recognition of their work when seeking to construct an authorial presence in the literary marketplace.\n\nWelsh-, Irish- and Scots Gaelic-Language Press Production The nineteenth-century Welsh-, Irish- and Scots Gaelic-language press has been underrepresented in past studies of press history. This volume rectifies this gap with chapters by Aled Jones, Sheila M. Kidd and Regina Ui Chollatáin. They are unique in being the first attempts to link comparative, holistic surveys and analyses across the four kingdoms of the challenges in representing such cultural and linguistic identities within a dominant English-language press environment. Aled Jones points out in his chapter on Welsh-language press identity that over 500 titles were published in Wales over the course of the century, with a significant number appearing exclusively in the Welsh language, and the inclusion in virtually all Welsh-based Englishlanguag"
