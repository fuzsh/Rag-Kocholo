        "text": "The Master of Ceremonies announces a great ball to be held on Valentine’s Day in the Upper Assembly Rooms of Bath. Ladies of the highest rank—and some who wish they were—scheme, prepare, and compete to make best use of the opportunity. Dukes, earls, tradesmen, and the occasional charlatan are alert to the possibilities as the event draws nigh.\n\nBut anything can happen in the magic of music and candlelight as couples dance, flirt, and open themselves to romantic possibilities. Problems and conflict may just fade away at a Valentine’s Day Ball.\n\n25% of proceeds benefit the Malala Fund.\n\nBeauty and the Bounder\n\nby Jessica Cale\n\nHe’s a liar and a fortune-hunter… and exactly what she needs.\n\nThe moment Lady Emilia sets eyes on the Chevalier d’Aubusson, she knows their fates are tied together. For good or ill, she cannot say. A mysterious aristocrat with a tragic past, the chevalier makes waves with his considerable charm.\n\nBut the chevalier is not as he seems. There are cracks in his story, and Emilia never could resist a mystery. Whether he’s a gentleman or a bounder, he might just be the man for her.\n\nThe Earl Takes a Wife\n\nby Sherry Ewing\n\nIt began with a memory, etched in the heart.\n\nLady Celia Lacey is too young for a husband, especially man-about-town Lord Adrian de Courtenay. But when she meets him at a house party, she falls in love.\n\nAdrian finds the appealing innocent impossible to forget, though she is barely out of the schoolroom and a relative by marriage.\n\nHis sister’s deceptions bring them together, but destroys their happiness. Can they reach past the hurt to the love that still burns?\n\nThe Beast Next Door\n\nby Jude Knight\n\nIn all the assemblies and parties, no-one Charis met could ever match the beast next door.\n\nCharis Fishingham has always felt more at home at Eastwood—Beastwood, as the neighbours called it, after the flawed child who once lived there. In the Eastwood gardens, Charis can escape her mother’s expectations, her sisters’ chatter, and her own worries about her future. There, she reads and remembers her secret friend, long gone into exile to have his birthmarks removed at his family’s command.\n\nNow the Beast has returned. Eric Lord Wayford would rather face the surgeons of Naples and Napoleon’s armies than the tongues of the ton. He joyfully greets Charis, and their future looks to be full of hope.\n\nBut someone does not wish Charis to wed the Beast of Beastwood, and will stop at nothing to keep them apart.\n\nThe Umbrella Chronicles: John and Emma’s Story\n\nby Amy Quinton\n\nA serious-minded, scientific man of learning seeks a complex and chaotic practitioner of all things superstitious who will upend his well-ordered life.\n\nThe Umbrella Strikes Again! Another Bachelor Has Fallen!\n\nEngland, 1815\n\nDr. John Edward Hartwell needs assistance, though not quite the kind of help he might think. True, he is well-organized, tidy, and pathologically set in his ways—a more serious-minded man one might never find.\n\nBut in his ways, I have determined, lies misery.\n\nEnter Miss Emma Merryweather—a woman who is as lovely as she is chaotic. She is the perfect candidate to compliment our man of numbers and logical focus, bringing sunshine and superstition to redirect him away from a future of certain wretchedness.\n\nAnd now that she has been categorically convinced that they are destined to be together—the signs, you see—no one can stand in her way, for she is as tenacious and optimistic as she is beautiful.\n\nAnd none can resist her smile.\n\nIf I have anything to say about matters, and I always have something to say about matters, the signs will point the way.\n\nThey already have.\n\nLady Harriett Ross,\n\nSelf-proclaimed Motley Meddler * Mistress of Destiny * Wielder of the Infamous Umbrella\n\nI’m just an old woman with opinions. On everything.\n\nCandles in the Dark\n\nby Caroline Warfield\n\nDoug Marsh and his candles bring light to many, none more than Esther. They may light the Assembly Rooms even as his love lights her life.\n\nDoug Marsh knew what the army expected of him. Invalided out, he struggles to run his uncle’s candle-works and look after those dependent on it. A contract with the Bath Assembly Rooms would go a long way toward succeeding at both of those things. The plight of a young woman is a distraction he doesn’t need.\n\nEsther Hopkins, formerly ‘the Honorable’, has no time to mourn the life denied her by a single mistake. A woman alone with a new-born son to raise needs work, and she is determined to make it on her own. If only she could stop yearning for the sturdy arms and kind blue eyes of the man who rescued her from starvation and enlisted the entire Marsh Candle Works to her support. But Sergeant Marsh shows nothing but benevolent interest in her welfare. Why should he care for a fallen woman?\n\nIn the normal course of things Esther is far above Doug’s touch. Can he find the courage to court her and still take care of business at the same time?\n\nAmazon • Barnes & Noble • Kobo • iBooks • Smashwords\n\nAbout the Bluestocking Belles\n\nThe Bluestocking Belles (the “BellesInBlue”) are ten very different writers united by a love of history and a history of writing about love. From sweet to steamy, from light-hearted fun to dark tortured tales full of angst, from London ballrooms to country cottages to the sultan’s seraglio, one or more of us will have a tale to suit your tastes and mood.\n\nOther Bluestocking Belles Collections\n\nBooks by Individual Belles\n\nHatfield House\n\nHatfield House is a Jacobean manor built by Robert Cecil, the son of William Cecil, the most trusted advisor of Elizabeth I. Robert succeeded his father as Elizabeth’s advisor, eventually becoming an advisor of James I as well. Robert Cecil is the one who discovered the plot of Guy Fawkes and others to blow up the House of Lords. A later Cecil (James) was made Marquis of Salisbury, and the Salisburys still own and live at Hatfield House more than 500 years later.\n\nHatfield Palace, which stood nearby (of which only a banquet room remains) was where all of Henry VIII’s children (Mary, Elizabeth, and Edward) were raised. It was here where Elizabeth learned that she was queen after the death of her sister Mary.\n\nPhotos of Hatfield House\n\nKenwood House\n\nWilliam Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, bought the house in 1754 and commissioned Robert Adam to remodel it, which he did from 1764-1779. The library is a masterpiece of Robert Adam genius, but the rest of the house is equally splendid. It is a pity that most of the original Adam-designed furniture was dispersed long ago, but a later owner, a Lord Iveagh, purchased the house in 1925 and displayed his fabulous collection of paintings there before leaving the house and its contents to the nation in 1927.\n\nLord Mansfield and his wife never had children of their own, but they did take in two young daughters of nephews: Lady Elizabeth Murray and Dido Belle, who was a mixed-race daughter of an enslaved West Indian woman. Dido Belle was the subject of a recent film, Belle.\n\nPictures of Kenwood House\n\nBuckingham Palace\n\nBuckingham Palace needs no introduction from me. I scheduled my trip this year so that I could visit, since it’s only open to visitors when the Queen is on holiday in Scotland (August and September). No photographs allowed, so I pinned these from other people’s Pinterest boards.\n\nHere’s Squidgeworth ready to enjoy a coffee and scone with me after the tour.\n\nPictures of Buckingham Palace\n\nOsterley Park\n\nBuilt by Sir Thomas Gresham, financial advisor of Elizabeth I, Osterley Park was later purchased by Robert Child, a wealthy banker, who left it (and his entire fortune) to his granddaughter, Sarah Fane, who married George Villiers and became Lady Jersey (yes, Sally Jersey, one of the patronesses at Almack’s during the Regency period) a year later. But the house has been little used, as the Jerseys preferred spending their time at other properties. Here you will see not only the Robert Adam touches, but also nearly all of the original furniture, including the room where Adam worked and some of his drawings.\n\nPictures of Osterley Park\n\nDevizes & the Bear Hotel\n\nThe Bear Inn was once owned by the father of a young Thomas Lawrence, who used to charm the clientele by reciting poetry and drawing likenesses. He was quite good, and was eventually knighted for his portrait painting. See my blog post here.\n\nPictures of Devizes\n\nBath\n\nSquidgeworth and I had a very enjoyable two days in Bath, staying at the Brooks Guesthouse, where I stayed three years ago on my Rick Steves tour. Here I visited No. 1 Royal Crescent, the Jane Austen Centre, the Victoria Art Gallery, the Holburne Museum, the Assembly Rooms and Fashion Museum (second visit), and Sally Lunn’s.\n\nHere’s Squidgeworth saying goodbye to Bath.\n\nPictures of Bath\n\nTomorrow afternoon, Susana will be on her way across the pond to London for her 2015 English adventure. This time, however, she won’t be traveling alone. Her dear friend Squidgeworth, who turned chartreuse with envy when his cousin Squidge got to travel there with Ki Pha earlier this year, will be accompanying her on the trip and posing for photos along the way. Squidgeworth and his cousin appear identical—as indeed does every member of the Squidge family—but the Squidgeworths are the aristocratic blue-bloods of the family. He was quite indignant that his commoner cousin got to visit the land of their ancestors before he did. He got over his fit of pique when Susana explained that she was going later this year because she wanted to visit when Buckingham Palace was open to the public. Squidge, after all, didn’t get to go there.\n\nSo… where else are Squidgeworth and Susana going this year?\n\nSussex\n\nA dear friend invited them to stay a few days in Eastbourne, where they will be visiting Firle Place and/or the Glynde Estate, Chartwell, visiting the quaint village of Alfriston, and Quebec House. They will also be taking in a play called Flare Path.\n\nLondon\n\nFrom there, they will travel to London, where they will be residing in a rented flat near London Bridge. There are always plenty of things to see in or near London, and some of the places on this year’s list include:\n\nBuckingham Palace (of course)\n\nOsterley Park\n\nKenwood\n\nHam House\n\nThe White Hart, St. Albans\n\nMarble Hill\n\nThe Foundling Museum\n\nThe Victoria & Albert Museum: specifically, the Vauxhall exhibit, with the Handel statue and supper-box paintings.\n\nDay Trips from London\n\nPetworth, West Sussex\n\nWaddesdon Manor\n\nHatfield House, Hertfordshire\n\nBurghley House, Lincolnshire\n\nBateman’s House, East Sussex\n\nThe Bell Inn, Stilton\n\nLyme Park, Cheshire\n\nGreenway, Devon\n\nCharlecote, Warwickshire\n\nArundel Castle, West Sussex\n\nOvernight Stays\n\nBath and Devizes\n\nIn Devizes, Susana and Squidgeworth will be staying at the historic Bear Inn, which featured in Susana’s Coaching Days & Coaching Ways blog series. Then they will spend two days in Bath, visiting some of the sights that figure in Susana’s story, The Third MacPherson Sister, from the Sweet Summer Kisses box set.\n\nYork\n\nFollowing that, S & S will be heading north for two nights in York, where they will be paying visits to Harewood, Castle Howard, and Haworth, as well as enjoying the lovely city itself.\n\nEngland’s Stately Homes By Train\n\nNeither Susana nor Squidgeworth is interested in driving in England, so Cheryl Bolen’s book, English Stately Homes By Train, has been very helpful in planning the trip. Susana used the print version for planning and will take the digital version on her iPad for the trip.\n\nFollow S & S on their wanderings\n\nSquidgeworth will be appearing regularly on Susana’s Facebook Page, and photos will be downloaded to Pinterest as well. Highlights of the week will appear on Mondays on this blog. Please keep in touch so they don’t get too homesick!\n\nÀ bientôt\n\nSusana & Squidgeworth\n\nBath Abbey\n\nFive things to know about Bath Abbey*\n\nThree different churches have occupied the site of today’s Abbey since 757 AD. First, an Anglo-Saxon monastery which was pulled down by the Norman conquerors of England; then a massive Norman cathedral which was begun about 1090 but lay in ruins by late 15th century; and finally, the present Abbey Church as we now know it.\n\nThe first King of all England, King Edgar was crowned on this site in 973 (as shown above). The service set the precedent for the coronation of all future Kings and Queens of England including Elizabeth II.\n\nThe first sight most visitors have of Bath Abbey is the West front, with its unique ladders of Angels. The story behind this is that the Bishop of Bath, Oliver King, is said to have had a dream of angels ascending and descending into heaven which inspired the design and which also inspired him to build a new Abbey church – the last great medieval cathedral to have been built in England.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 by order of King Henry VIII, the Abbey lay in ruins for more than 70 years. It wasn’t until 1616, that much of the building we see today was repaired and in use as a parish church and over two hundred years later, in the 1830s, that local architect George Manners added new pinnacles and flying buttresses to the exterior and inside, built a new organ on a screen over the crossing, more galleries over the choir and installed extra seating.\n\nThe Abbey as we know it is the work of Sir George Gilbert Scott, who from 1864 to 1874, completely transformed the inside of the Abbey to conform with his vision of Victorian Gothic architecture. His most significant contribution must surely be the replacement of the ancient wooden ceiling over the nave with the spectacular stone fan vaulting we see today.\n\n*http://www.bathabbey.org/history\n\nThe Pump Room\n\nSituated next to main street entrance to the Roman Baths, visitors can sample the waters from the warm spring which fills the Roman Baths. The building also houses a restaurant, where it is popular to sample the afternoon tea.\n\nThe Roman Baths\n\nThe house is a well-preserved Roman site for public bathing. The Roman Baths themselves are below the modern street level. There are four main features: the Sacred Spring, the Roman Temple, the Roman Bath House and the Museum holding finds from Roman Bath. The buildings above street level date from the 19th century.\n\nThe Pulteney Bridge\n\nThe bridge features two ranges of shops designed in the Palladian style c. 1770, between them forming a narrow street over the bridge. The street and buildings sit above three segmental arches of equal span.\n\nThe shops on the north side have cantilevered rear extensions. Consequently the northern external façade of the bridge is asymmetrical, much altered and of no architectural merit, whereas the southern external side clearly shows the hand of Robert Adam.\n\nSydney Gardens (formerly Bath Vauxhall Gardens)\n\nThe Sydney Gardens are the only remaining 18th century pleasure gardens in England.\n\nThe gardens were constructed in the 1790s opening in 1795 as a commercial pleasure grounds, following the development of Bathwick by Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet across the River Avon from the city centre. The original plans were by Thomas Baldwin and completed by Charles Harcourt Masters who included a maze or labyrinth, grotto, sham castle and an artificial rural scene with moving figures powered by a clockwork mechanism. The gardens were illuminated by over 15,000 “variegated lamps”. Around 1810 the Kennet and Avon Canal was built through the gardens.\n\nThe Sydney Hotel\n\nThe Sydney Hotel was built within the gardens. The original design for the hotel, prepared by Thomas Baldwin in 1794, was a two-storey building which would serve the pleasure gardens. After Baldwin was bankrupted his design for the hotel was not implemented. Instead a three-storey building was designed by Charles Harcourt Masters. The foundation stone was laid in 1796 and the building was ready by 1799. Visitors entered the gardens through the Hotel. Projecting from the rear of the building at first floor level was a conservatory and a semi-circular Orchestra with a wide covered loggia below. Two semi-circular rows of supper boxes projected from the sides of the building. The gardens were used daily for promenades and public breakfasts which were attended by Jane Austen among others. At public breakfasts tea, coffee, rolls and Sally Lunn buns were served at about midday, followed by dancing. There were generally three evening galas each summer, usually on the birthdays of George III and the Prince of Wales, and in July to coincide with the Bath races. During these galas the gardens were lit with thousands of lamps and the guests took supper accompanied by music and fireworks. Breakfasts, coffee-drinking, newspaper-reading and card-playing took place in the ground floor of the Hotel and dancing in a ballroom on the first floor. All the rooms could be hired for private parties and meetings.\n\nThe Assembly Rooms\n\nThe Assembly Rooms formed the hub of fashionable Georgian society in the city, the venue being described as “the most noble and elegant of any in the kingdom” They were originally known as the Upper Rooms as there was also a lower assembly room in the city, which closed soon after the Upper Rooms opened. They served the newly built fashionable area which included The Circus, Queen Square and the Royal Crescent.\n\nPeople would gather in the rooms in the evening for balls and other public functions, or simply to play cards. Mothers and chaperones bringing their daughters to Bath for the social season, hoping to marry them off to a suitable husband, would take their charge to such events where, very quickly, one might meet all the eligible men currently in the City.\n\nThe Theatre Royal\n\nThe present main entrance to the Theatre Royal, in Sawclose, was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was Beau Nash’s first house. The exterior of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger and erected by John Palmer.\n\nThe theatre itself was erected in 1805, replacing the Old Orchard Street Theatre which was also called the Theatre Royal, which is now a Freemason’s Hall.\n\nThe theatre is said to be haunted by The Grey Lady, who was an actress centuries ago. She has been seen watching productions in the Grey Lady Box, and she leaves the distinctive scent of Jasmine. She has been seen and scented in recent years.\n\nText from Wikipedia.\n\nAbout The Third MacPherson Sister (part of the Sweet Summer Kisses anthology)\n\nAfter a disastrous fourth Season in London, Rebecca and her mother take refuge in Bath to determine their next course of action. Rebecca has always known she’ll never be able to measure up to her older sisters, the “Golden Twins,” who were the reigning queens of the ton in their day, but surely there is a gentleman somewhere capable of appreciating her finer qualities.\n\nMiles Framingham, Duke of Aylesbury, finds himself in need a wife… although he doesn’t really want one. Burdened with the responsibilities of a dukedom from a young age, what he really yearns for is freedom. Marriage to the right woman, though, might not be such an onerous task.\n\nWhen the hapless Rebecca finds herself pushed into the lap of this eminently eligible duke in the nave of Bath Abbey, a match between them seems ordained by the heavens… except for the little matter of his past history with her sisters.\n\nBluestockings and wallflowers seek happily-ever-afters. Only handsome, respectable and deeply romantic persons need apply. Dukes and marquesses will be given special consideration. Apply within.\n\nThis anthology contains nine fun, heart-tugging, and wholesomely romantic Regency novellas that are as sigh-worthy as they are sweet, brought to you by USA Today and national bestselling, award-winning authors.\n\nAmazon • Barnes & Noble • Kobo • iBooks • Google\n\nA Hearty Welcome to Fellow Bluestocking Belle\n\nJude Knight\n\nA short history of invalid chairs\n\nOne of the many things I love about writing historical romance is the odd bits of knowledge I need to research.\n\nIn Farewell to Kindness, I needed a way for my hero’s cousin, an injured soldier, to get around the house under his own steam, which led me to invalid chairs, and ultimately to my little novella, Candle’s Christmas Chair.\n\nWheels on chairs for invalids go back a very long way. We have documentary evidence of them in a Chinese print reliably dated to AD 525, but human ingenuity quite possibly put chairs and wheels together long before that.\n\nIt’s likely, though, that only the rich had such chairs. Certainly, once wheeled chairs for invalids begin to regularly pop up in the documentary record, the posteriors seated in them belonged to the rich and the noble.\n\nIn 1595, King Philip II of Spain was sketched sitting in a reclining chair with wheels on each leg. It was clunky and heavy, and he needed to be pushed around by a servant, but – hey – king, right?\n\nSelf-propelling chairs arrived remarkably quickly after that, unsurprisingly developed by someone who was himself in need of a chair. In 1655, Stephen Farfler, a paraplegic watchmaker, moved himself around in a chair with three wheels. He moved around by turning handles that worked on the geared front wheel.\n\nMost of the sites I looked at when researching wheelchairs jump from Farfler to John Dawson of Bath. But wheelchairs – both ordinary chairs with wheels and more advanced chairs designed specifically to have wheels – continued right through.\n\nAnd, in any case, the Bath chair was invented around 1750 by James Heath. Bath was becoming popular as a spa town, but it was not designed to easily get around in a carriage, and ordinary wheelchairs really only worked well on a flat surface such as inside the house.\n\nThe Bath chair was designed to take invalids out and about; primarily down to the Roman Baths for the treatment, and then back home again. Until then, invalids used the sedan chair, which required two attendants to carry. The Bath chair just needed one person at the back pushing. Furthermore, the occupant of the chair had the steering stick and could therefore directly control the direction of travel. I can see that would be appealing to the average wealthy dowager!\n\nYou can see from the advertisement that Heath also sold wheelchairs. The example shown appears to have wheels at the front and stabilising legs at the rear, so no doubt the attendant lifted slightly when he pushed.\n\nBut the self-propelling chair had not gone away. John Joseph Merlin, a Belgian inventor and watchmaker (and, perhaps not incidentally the inventor of the in-line skate) created a successful chair that became the model for others. Keith Armstrong, in A very short history of the bicycle and wheelchair, says:\n\nIn the mid 1770’s he invented roller-skates and presented his new creation by arriving at a London party playing his violin whilst gliding around the room. Merlin received rapacious applause and an encore, the party-goers demanded that he repeated his act, during the second attempt, he quickly discovered that he didn’t known how to stop and he had a major accident. The next we read about him is of the invention of a new type of self-propelled wheelchair… His design was so successful that 120 years later, a London catalogue of medical equipment was able to boast nine different ‘Merlin’ wheelchairs available on their books. Merlin died in 1803.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Merlin chair had small handles on its arms. But the name “Merlin chair” was retained for later chairs where the occupant was able to turn the large rear wheels to get around, and – by the late 19th century – the smaller propelling wheel had arrived, to help people keep their hands clean.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the end of the 18th century, let’s not forget John Dawson. The most prominent Bath chair maker of his time, his chairs outsold everyone else’s. Since, by all accounts, they were not very comfortable, we must assume that the others were worse!\n\nAbout Farewell to Kindness\n\nFor three years, Rede has been searching for those who ordered the murders of his wife and children. Now close to end of his quest, he travels to his country estate to be close to the investigation.\n\nHe is fascinated by the lovely widow who lives in one of the cottages he owns. A widow who pays no rent. A widow, moreover, with a small daughter whose distinctive eyes mark her as as the child of his predecessor as Earl.\n\nSix years ago, Anne blackmailed Rede’s predecessor at arrow-point for an income and a place to livein hiding from her guardian’s sinister plans for her and her sisters. He no longer has legal rights over her, but the youngest sister is still only 18. He cannot be allowed to find her.\n\nRede is everything she has learned not to trust: a man, a peer, a Redepenning. If he discovers who she is, she may lose everything.\n\nTo build a future together, Rede and Anne must be prepared to face their pasts.\n\nRegency noir\n\nUS99c to 8 April 2015; USD3.49 from 9 April 2015\n\nKobo • iBooks • Barnes & Noble • Smashwords • Amazon\n\nExcerpt\n\nGeorge was drunk. But not nearly drunk enough. He still saw his young friend’s dying eyes everywhere. In half-caught glimpses of strangers reflected in windows along Bond Street, under the hats of coachmen that passed him along the silent streets to Bedford Square, in the flickering lamps that shone pallidly against the cold London dawn as he stumbled up the steps to his front door.\n\nThey followed his every waking hour: hot, angry, hate-filled eyes that had once been warm with admiration.\n\nHe drank to forget, but all he could do was remember.\n\nOne more flight of stairs, then through the half open door to his private sitting room, already reaching for the waiting decanter of brandy as he crossed the floor.\n\nHe had a glass of oblivion halfway to his lips before he noticed the painting.\n\nIt stood on an easel, lit by a carefully arranged tree of candles. George’s own face was illuminated—the golden shades of his hair, his intensely blue eyes. The artist had captured his high cheekbones and sculpted jaw. “One of London’s most beautiful men,” he’d been called.\n\nHe stalked to the easel, moving with great care to avoid spilling his drink.\n\nYes. The artist had talent. Who could have given him such a thing?\n\nAs he bent forward to look at it more closely, something whipped past his face. With a solid thunk, an arrow struck the painting, to stand quivering between the painted eyes.\n\nRead the first three chapters here.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nJude Knight writes strong determined heroines, heroes who can appreciate a clever capable woman, villains you’ll love to loathe, and all with a leavening of humour.\n\nTwitter • Facebook • Blog • Goodreads • Newsletter\n\nInterview with Rachel Brimble\n\nSusana: Tell us something about your newest release that is NOT in the blurb.\n\nRachel: The Temptation of Laura is the second book in my ongoing Victorian series with eKensington. The books are set in and around the famous city of Bath, England. I am lucky enough to live just a short thirty-minute drive from the city so it was inevitable I would write historical romances with Bath as the influence.\n\nMy romances are darker than most because I love to write about the poorer people living in the late 1800s rather than the gentry. Laura is a prostitute striving for a better life and Adam is an actor whose ambition and fear of failure leads him to make dire mistakes. I enjoy reading books where the hero and heroines have to struggle for their happily ever after…I hope your readers will agree the fight is worth it, come the end.\n\nSusana: Are you working on something at present that you would like to tell us about?\n\nRachel: I am working on book 3 in the series – tentatively called The Passion of Monica, this story is about Monica Danes who was a secondary character in book 2. As soon as she appeared on the page I knew she deserved her own story. This book takes Monica from her beloved Bath back to her hometown of Biddestone. The death of her father means her family needs her and Monica is forced to face the painful lesson of learning to forgive and forget…\n\nSusana: What are you reading now?\n\nRachel: Right now I am reading The Victorian House by the fabulous historian, Judith Flanders for research, as well as Lady of the Rivers by one of my all time favorite authors, Philippa Gregory.\n\nSusana: What author or authors have most influenced your writing?\n\nRachel: For my contemporary work (Harlequin Superromance), my biggest influences are Nora Roberts, Jill Shalvis and Robyn Carr. For my historical work, I love Jean Fullerton, Philippa Gregory and Lisa Kleypas\n\nSusana: What is your work schedule like when writing?\n\nRachel: I am lucky enough to write full-time around my two teenage daughters so when they are at school, I work from 8.30-3.30 and then grab as much time at the laptop as possible around household chores and running them where they need to be. At the weekends, I write if we aren’t doing anything as a family but try my hardest to spend time with my husband and kids.\n\nSusana: Is there a writer you idolize? If so, who?\n\nRachel: My all-time favorite writers are Nora Roberts and Stephen King – both these authors never fail to deliver and every time I pick up one of their books, I know I am in for a treat both as a writer and reader. Their styles are entirely different but the stories are heavily character-driven which draws me in and makes me care.\n\nWhen I grow up, I want to call myself Nora King 😉\n\nAbout The Temptation of Laura\n\nLaura Robinson has always been dazzled by the glamour of the stage. But perhaps acting and selling one’s favors are not so different—for Laura must feign pleasure with the men she beds to survive. Now, with her only friend at death’s door and a ruthless pimp at her heels, escaping her occupation seems impossible. Hoping to attract a gentleman, she attends the theater. Yet the man Laura captivates is no customer, but a rising star and playwright…\n\nAdam Lacey has been driven to distraction since the moment he saw Laura. She is his ideal leading lady come to irresistible life—and so much more. Certain they can make the perfect team on and off stage, he is determined to win her heart—and discover her story. But that is precisely what Laura fears. And she has no idea that Adam harbors shameful secrets of his own. Will the truth free them to love—or destroy all their dreams…?\n\nAvailable\n\nAmazon US • Amazon UK • Barnes & Noble • Kobo\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRachel lives with her husband and two young daughters in a small town near Bath in the UK.
