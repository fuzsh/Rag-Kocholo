        "text": "The codex studied in these pages has not received the attention it deserves, either for the uniqueness of its texts or for the old? age of the copy. The first part (ff. 1-50) contains a Chronographia syntomos that IRIARTE erroneously identified with the Chronographikon syntomon of the Patriarch Nicephorus, an error that was followed by other scholars until BAUER published the work in 1909, despite which it has never been present in the studies of chronographies from the Macedonian period. The second part of the codex (ff. 51-82) is a miscellany of fragmentary materials attributed more or less justifiably to Hippolytus. Among them, the presentation of the codex gives a prominent place to the Diamerismos (ff. 51v-63) and the Stadiasmos of the Sea (ff. 63-82v). This contribution aims to examine the Madrid MS in order to understand the meaning of the miscellany of its texts: a brief Byzantine chronography updated in the reign of Leo VI and partially coinciding with the Tables attributed to the Patriarch Nicephorus, then the initial fragment of the Synagoge of Hippolytus (3rd c.), one of the works that started the assimilation of the biblical computus into the Christian mind-set. Finally, after a brief transition between biblical history and Roman geography, a fragmentary Mediterranean periplus which essentially dates back to the Augustan era and was incorporated by Hippolytus into his Synagoge. Our research will conclude that these historiographical and geographical materials, despite their fragmented nature, were copied in Constantinople shortly after the intense recovery of historical texts promoted by Emperor Constantine VII."
