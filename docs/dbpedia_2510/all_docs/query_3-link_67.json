Out of those 81, 12 of the 14 SEC schools were represented.\n\nHere are the SEC nominees:\n\nArkansas DB Hudson Clark\n\nAuburn LS Jacob Quattlebaum\n\nFlorida PK Adam Mihalek\n\nGeorgia QB Stetson Bennett\n\nKentucky P Colin Goodfellow\n\nLSU RB Josh Williams\n\nMississippi State LB Sherman Timbs\n\nMissouri WR Barret Banister\n\nOle Miss TE Casey Kelly\n\nSouth Carolina WR Payton Mangrum\n\nTennessee LS Matthew Salansky\n\nTexas A&M DS Connor Choate\n\nThe award will be given out on Dec. 5 at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Ark."
