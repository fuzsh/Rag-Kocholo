Khatt is a mountainous village south-east of the city of Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates. Famous for its hot springs,[1] and latterly home to a spa hotel,[2] there is evidence that Khatt has been a site of constant human settlement since the stone age â€“ a record of over 5,000 years of occupation.
