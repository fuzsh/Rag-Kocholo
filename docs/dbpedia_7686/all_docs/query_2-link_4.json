        "text": "For 45 years, Iran's most famous modern monument, the Azadi (Freedom) Tower in Tehran, has been the backdrop to every major news story coming out of the country.\n\nA plaza for celebrations, anniversaries, military parades and a gathering point for mass demonstrations, the 50m (165ft) tall tower has overlooked some of Iran's most important political events.\n\nThe edifice was built in 1971, to represent a symbol of modernity and project the way forward for Iran.\n\nEven at the time the project was finished, architect Hossein Amanat never expected that \"it would become such an icon, so popular with the people of Iran\".\n\nOriginally named the King's Memorial, or Shahyad, it was commissioned to mark 2,500 years of the Persian Empire, celebrating the richness of Persian history and culture.\n\nHossein Amanat was a rising star in Iran's architectural scene when, in 1966, he won a national competition to design the monument.\n\nLocated in western Tehran, on the road from the city's old international airport, the monument itself is made of white marble and is surrounded by a 50,000 sq m (540,000 sq ft) plaza, which is decorated with gardens, fountains, a museum and exhibition centre.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Iran was already a major oil producing country, which led Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to embark on an ambitious programme of modernisation and industrialisation.\n\nDuring this period, Iran's modern art scene was simultaneously thriving. It was like \"a mini renaissance\", says Mr Amanat.\n\nArtists, poets and musicians were trying to create their own, original styles, distinctive from but also drawing inspiration from those in the West. Yet, they also had their eye on the traditional elements of Persian culture.\n\nMr Amanat says that the style of Shahyad was also a manifestation of this period - modern, yet very Persian, with aspects of both pre- and post-Islamic architecture.\n\nMr Amanat says that, of all the events that the tower has witnessed, this one was \"memorable\".\n\nFor many Iranians living outside Iran, this surprising turn of events appeared to show a different side of the nation.\n\nFor Mr Amanat, the scenes were both personal and moving; he says the building was \"like the embrace of a father, embracing all these people in front of it\".\n\nIts historical pull, he believes, lies in the tower's evolution as a \"symbol of Iran\", an aesthetic icon of the capital that is both intensely Iranian and Islamic at the same time."
