        "text": "I am a real estate developer and registered architect with deep financial and policy experience and a strong interest in technology and how it is radically shaping the future of my industry. I founded Amanat Properties to redevelop historic residential properties. I assemble locally-based, highly-skilled teams for each project, including innovative consultants who can maximize a historic building's potential, lenders who specialize in redevelopment opportunities and investors who believe that attractive financial returns and community building can go hand-in-hand. Amanat means \"held in trust\" in the Urdu language and that is how I see each of my projects. Through my work, I make the places around me more beautiful, more livable and more accessible for all.\n\nInvesting in tomorrow.\n\nI focus on redeveloping historic properties, particularly residential and mixed-use. I look for architecturally significant townhouses, apartment buildings and commercial buildings built before the 1920s, with deferred maintenance, subpar operations, poor renovations and under-built zoning envelopes. Total budgets range from $5.0 to $10.0M. My business plan is simple but effective - renovate, repurpose, extend and restore properties with development timelines of 1 to 2 years and hold periods of up to 6 years. I take advantage of valuable public incentives, including Opportunity Zones, Urban Enterprise Zones, New Market Tax Credits and Historic Tax Credits. Learn more about winning public incentives from my partner company, REDIST.\n\nSmall to mid scale, as-of-right and tax-advantaged strategy."
