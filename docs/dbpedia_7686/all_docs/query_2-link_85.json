        "text": "Explore Tehran, the heart of Iran, through our detailed Tehran Travel Guide. This city, a fascinating amalgamation of modern advancements and rich historical tapestries, showcases everything from soaring skyscrapers to ancient palaces. Dive into Tehran’s cultural depth, savor the flavors of Persian cuisine, and wander the lively bazaars.\n\nOur guide offers insights into creating an unforgettable experience, highlighting must-visit sites, lesser-known treasures, and essential travel tips. Tehran caters to both history buffs and those seeking the pulse of city life, guaranteeing an impactful journey.\n\nTehran’s history stretches back over 6,000 years, with its strategic location in north-central Iran playing a pivotal role in its cultural and historical development. Initial settlements date to the Bronze Age, but Tehran rose to prominence in the 9th century as a vital hub on the Silk Road.\n\nThe 20th century marked a period of significant transformation under the Pahlavi dynasty, leading to rapid modernization and Tehran’s evolution into the epicenter of Iran’s advancement.\n\nNow, with a population exceeding 10 million, Tehran stands as a bustling metropolis that embodies Iran’s political, economic, and cultural dynamism. It invites global visitors to explore its unique heritage and lively contemporary scene.\n\nHow is the Weather in Tehran?\n\nTehran experiences a semi-arid climate with four distinct seasons, which makes it a year-round destination depending on what you’re looking for.\n\nSummers are hot and dry, with daytime temperatures ranging from 30°C (86°F) to 40°C (104°F). Nighttime temperatures can be more comfortable but still quite warm. Autumn offers mild and pleasant weather, ideal for outdoor activities. Daytime temperatures range from 15°C (59°F) to 25°C (77°F).\n\nWinters are cold, especially at night. Snowfall is not uncommon, and temperatures can drop below freezing. This season attracts skiers to the nearby mountain resorts.\n\nSpring is arguably the best time to visit, with mild temperatures, blooming flowers, and plenty of sunshine. Daytime temperatures can vary from 10°C (50°F) to 20°C (68°F).\n\nDiscover the ideal times for your visit to Tehran:\n\nGet Around Tehran\n\nGetting around traffic-clogged, sprawling Tehran is a true test of patience. While taxis are your best bet, they are pricier here than the rest of the country.\n\nA large local bus network will also take you almost anywhere you need to go, as long you can make sense of the routes and Persian line numbers.\n\nThe true star of Tehran’s transport system however, is the brand new metro.\n\nTehran Bus\n\nThe buses in the Tehran are quite efficient in Iran and it is by far the most preferred transport for women, who deem it safer than taxis. Buses operate throughout the city but timetables and routes are not readily available.\n\nBus stops, in particular along Vali Asr Street, are clearly marked and numerous. Otherwise, you can ask a passerby for the nearest stop.\n\nDay services are frequent, but in the evenings (some buses do not run after 21.30) and on Fridays these are more sporadic.\n\nAlways buy a ticket either at the kiosk or from the driver himself, paying at the end of the journey.\n\nFemale travellers may need to exit the bus and then come up to the driver at the front to pay for the ticket (around 3,000 rials).\n\nTehran BRT Bus\n\nThe Tehran Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is a rapid transit system serving Tehran which was officially inaugurated in 2008. The BRT has a network of over 150 kilometres, transporting 1.8 million passengers on a daily basis.\n\nThe BRT has a total of ten lines with a further expansion planned to bring the total length to 300 kilometres. In 2023, the fare for regular and express buses has been set at 1,800 Iranian Rials (IRR) for the first 2.5 kilometers. For every additional 2.5 kilometers, an extra 400 Iranian Rials (IRR) will be charged.\n\nBRT tickets in Tehran are offered as prepaid, rechargeable cards and are integrated with the Tehran Metro system. To purchase one of these electronic, credit-based tickets, you can go to the ticket sales booths located at metro stations.\n\nRecharging your BRT ticket is quite easy. Simply visit the designated booths in the metro stations to reload your card.\n\nGiven that these booths can often be crowded, it’s recommended to use the machines installed in metro stations for this purpose.\n\nThese machines allow you to recharge your ticket using a bank credit card. Additionally, there are machines at the entrances of BRT stations for recharging your ticket as well.\n\nTehran Metro\n\nThe first line of the Tehran metro opened in February 2000. There are now five lines in operation connecting the far-flung parts of this huge city. One-way and return ticket costs are 3,500 rials and 5,500 rials respectively, regardless of the distance.\n\nTravel passes are the cheapest way to use the metro and useful if you plan to use trains regularly.\n\nLike the Oyster card on the UK London underground, you purchase a card at the ticket office and charge the card with funds and swipe in and out of the barriers at the stations. Rush hours, best avoided, are from 06.00 to 09.00 and 1/1.00 to 17.00.\n\nMetro carriages are also gender-segregated, but metro travel is safe and efficient and indications are written in both Persian and clear English.\n\nWhile metro services are not as frequent as in European cities, the carriages are clean and you can always purchase a little something from one of the sellers along the way.\n\nSee and download a Map of the Tehran Metro (PDF) below.\n\nTehran Taxi\n\nTraveling by taxi in Tehran is easy and inexpensive. A shared taxi (savari) costs around 5,000—10,000 rials and private hire (darbast) costs up to 80,000 rials, depending on where you are going.\n\nDo remember that Tehran is not a pedestrian-friendly city and a short savari ride up Valiasr Street may save a great deal of energy.\n\nRideshare Apps in Tehran\n\nIt is recommended for traveler to use the ride-sharing apps such as SNAPP or TAP30 since they are cheaper than the regular taxi most of the time.\n\nGetting to Know Tehran’s Airports\n\nOne of the first modes of transportation you’ll likely encounter in this Tehran travel guide is air travel. The city boasts two airports: Imam Khomeini International Airport, which primarily serves international flights, and Mehrabad Airport, generally used for domestic travel.\n\nImam Khomeini International Airport\n\nTehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKA) is located roughly 30 kilometers southwest of the city center. The duration it takes to travel from various parts of Tehran to IKA can vary greatly depending on the mode of transport, traffic conditions, and the specific location in Tehran from which one is departing.\n\nThe distance between Imam Khomeini Airport and some important places\n\nIKA to Azadi Stadium (West Tehran)\n\nBy car: Approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour, but can be longer during peak traffic times.\n\nBy public transport: There isn’t a direct public transport line from Azadi Stadium to IKA. One would typically need to take a combination of metro and then a shuttle or taxi. This can take upwards of 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on wait times and connections.\n\nIKA to Tehran City Theater (Central Tehran)\n\nBy car: Roughly 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on traffic.\n\nBy public transport: Similar to the route from Azadi Stadium, there isn’t a direct line. The journey will likely involve a combination of metro and other forms of transport, taking around 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIKA to Lavizan Forest Park (North Tehran)\n\nBy car: Around 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\nBy public transport: Again, the journey would likely involve multiple modes of transport and can take around 2 hours or more.\n\nIKA to Milad Tower (North-central Tehran)\n\nBy car: Approximately 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\nBy public transport: There isn’t a direct public transport line from Milad Tower to IKA. As with the other locations, one would need a combination of metro and then a shuttle or taxi. This can take around 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIKA to Espinas Palace Hotel (Northwest Tehran)\n\nBy car: Around 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\nBy public transport: There isn’t a direct line from Espinas Palace to IKA. One would likely need a combination of the metro and then a shuttle or taxi. This can take around 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIKA to Parsian Esteghlal Hotel (North Tehran)\n\nBy car: Approximately 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\nBy public transport: Similarly, there isn’t a direct line from Parsian Esteghlal to IKA. The journey would likely involve a metro and then a transfer to a shuttle or taxi, taking around 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIKA to Ferdowsi Hotel (Central Tehran)\n\nBy car: Roughly 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on traffic conditions.\n\nBy public transport: As with most locations in central Tehran, there isn’t a direct line to IKA. One would need a combination of metro and other forms of transport, taking approximately 1.5 to 2 hours.\n\nIKA to Qom City Center\n\nBy car: Qom is located about 125 km south of Tehran. The drive from Qom city center to IKA is around 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on traffic and the specific route taken.\n\nBy public transport: There’s no direct public transport route from Qom to IKA. One would typically need to take a bus or train to Tehran and then transfer to another mode of transport to reach IKA. The total journey could take 3 hours or more, depending on wait times and connections.\n\nMehrabad International Airport\n\nBuilt in 1938, Mehrabad International Airport was Tehran’s primary airport for both domestic and international flights. Although its role for international flights has diminished with the advent of Imam Khomeini International Airport, Mehrabad continues to be a crucial facility for domestic travel within Iran.\n\nWhether you are arriving from abroad or traveling within the country, both airports offer a range of services and amenities to facilitate your journey.\n\nDistance and Travel Time from Mehrabad International Airport to Tehran City Center:\n\nThe distance is roughly 10 to 12 kilometers, depending on the specific destination in the city center.\n\nBy Car:\n\nWithout traffic: Approximately 20-30 minutes.\n\nWith traffic (especially during peak hours): It can take 40 minutes to over an hour.\n\nBy Public Transport: There’s a metro station (Mehrabad Airport Station) on Line 4 of Tehran’s metro system which connects the airport to the city center. Using the metro, it can take approximately 30-40 minutes to reach the city center. However, considering potential waiting times for the next train, the total journey could be a bit longer.\n\nTehran Train Station\n\nConstructed in 1927, the Tehran Railway Station stands as a key hub for various forms of travel. Easily accessible by metro and bus, it offers a convenient option for getting around the country.\n\nRoutes and Distances\n\nThe station serves as a junction for numerous routes that connect Tehran to other major cities. Key routes include Tehran to Mashhad, Tehran to Ahvaz, Tehran to Tabriz, and Tehran to Bandar Abbas. These cities are the terminal points, but the trains also make stops at various cities along these routes.\n\nProximity to Airports\n\nSituated about 13 km from Mehrabad Airport and approximately 45 km from Imam Khomeini International Airport, the station is conveniently located for those looking to transition between air and rail travel.\n\nTicketing\n\nIran Train tickets can easily be purchased through the OrientTrips website, making it simple for travelers to plan their journeys.\n\nWhether you’re exploring the city or venturing out to other parts of Iran, Tehran Railway Station provides a convenient and efficient travel solution.\n\nTehran Bus Terminals\n\n1. Azadi Terminal (West Tehran)\n\nAzadi Terminal, one of Tehran’s largest and busiest terminals, opened its doors in 1996.
