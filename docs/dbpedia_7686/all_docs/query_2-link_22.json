A visit to this place will give you a glimpse on the Sarai’s which dates back to the Mughal period. Sarai Amanat Khan is a well-designed caravan sarai, which is situated at a distance of 40 km from Amritsar. The Sarai is famous for its glazed tile decoration, mosque engraved with Arabic inscriptions and ornamental Mughal gateways. It has two gateways, Lahori Darwaza and Dilli Darwaza, which opens to a large courtyard that houses a mosque and a well. The horseshoe-shaped tomb is surmounted by 4 minarets. Amidst Mughal architecture and floral designs, there is a faded tile that mentions an inscription from Amanat Khan himself stating that the Sarai has been constructed for the comfort of God’s best creation.\n\nend of article\n\nNext story\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh Panorama\n\nAlso Read"
