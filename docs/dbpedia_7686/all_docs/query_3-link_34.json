They perceive it as real, which makes it real.\"\n\nThe subject of this article is part of an MCU franchise story \"inspired\" by the canon of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is thus not considered official canon.\n\nProfessor Sana Amanat is a Noble Prize winning scientist, who also designs defensive systems for S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nBiography[]\n\nProfessor Amanat, a native of Brooklyn, New York City, developed a professional career as a renowned scientist that allowed her to win a Noble Prize. After receiving the prize, Amanat decided to make her first public appearance in her old neighborhood because she felt it was the safest place. Unbeknownst to her, the Cadre was hired to kidnap Amanat to design weapons for their employer, instead of defensive systems for S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nHowever, Nick Fury assigned Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff to go undercover in Brooklyn to prevent the kidnapping. While undercover, some of the mercenaries recognized them for their role in the Battle of New York, and, after running facial recognition software, confirmed their identities. Rogers and Romanoff revealed themselves and fought different groups of mercenaries disguised as civilians before raiding The Cadre's base of operations, where one of the mercenaries told them that their goal was to distract them long enough for another team to kidnap Amanat.\n\nAmanat's motorcade was attacked with smoke bombs to facilitate the kidnapping, but it was thwarted by Rogers, who took advantage of his knowledge of the area to ambush the mercenary that had taken Amanat as a hostage. After her rescue, Amanat publicly thanked Rogers and Romanoff and praised some aspects of Brooklyn.[1]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllies[]\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nSteve Rogers/Captain America\n\nNatasha Romanoff/Black Widow â€ \n\nEnemies[]\n\nCadre\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe character's name and likeness are a reference to Sana Amanat, the director of content character development at Marvel Entertainment.[2]\n\nGallery[]"
