        "text": "The UAE stands out as one of the wealthiest countries in the Middle East, boasting a diverse array of businesses that provide both resident and non-resident investors with a plethora of trading opportunities.\n\nFor traders and investors alike, it's essential to acquaint themselves with local UAE companies, which can offer portfolio diversification, trading opportunities, and exposure to potentially lucrative financial markets.\n\nHere's what you need to know about trading UAE local stocks:\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe UAE is one of MENA’s strongest economies, projected to expand further in the future.\n\nFor traders seeking to potentially benefit from the UAE economy, trading CFDs on local UAE shares can be suitable.\n\nSome of the most popular UAE shares include Dubai Electricity and Water, Emaar Properties, Emirates NBD Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, and Salik Company, among others.\n\nLocal UAE share CFDs allow traders to trade rising and falling share prices with leverage.\n\nLeveraged trading can amplify gains but also result in significant losses.\n\nWhat Is the UAE?\n\nThe United Arab Emirates, commonly abbreviated as the UAE or the Emirates, is a Middle Eastern country situated in West Asia. It shares borders with Saudi Arabia, Oman, the Arabian Gulf, Iran, and Qatar.\n\nThe UAE comprises seven emirates (territories ruled by monarchs), and these are as follows:\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nDubai\n\nSharjah\n\nAjman\n\nUmm Al Quwain\n\nRas Al Khaimah\n\nFujairah\n\nAs of 2024, the UAE's population stands at 9,591,853, reflecting a 0.79% increase from the previous year.\n\nThe UAE’s Economic Landscape\n\nBefore delving into UAE CFD stock trading, it may be beneficial to gain an overview of the country's economic landscape to determine if investing in its businesses aligns with your goals.\n\nThe State of the UAE Economy\n\nAs of 2024, the UAE ranks as the fourth-largest economy by GDP in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Renowned for its prosperous business environment, innovative infrastructure, high-end airlines, telecommunications, and fast-paced markets, the country also excels in healthcare, education, and sustainability.\n\nThe UAE’s Economic Future\n\nAligned with its vision and national action plan, \"We Are the Emirates 2031,\" the country aims to enhance its sectors in the following manner:\n\nTourism: Adding 450 billion AED to the GDP.\n\nNon-oil exportation: Increasing to 800 billion AED.\n\nGDP: Raising to 3 trillion AED.\n\nForeign UAE trade: Elevating to 4 trillion AED.\n\nLegislation development: Achieving top rank for new economic sectors.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if the country’s economy will adhere to its policymakers' goals.\n\nGaining Exposure to the UAE Economy through Share CFDs\n\nOne avenue to gain exposure to the UAE's economy is by trading Contracts for Difference (CFDs) on shares of popular local UAE companies.\n\nTrading CFDs involves opening buy or sell positions on derivative agreements between two parties (a buyer and a seller, or a trader and a CFD provider) to transact the difference in the share's price from the contract's opening to its closure.\n\nCFDs are leveraged instruments, meaning gains and losses are magnified. Importantly, CFDs don't confer ownership of the underlying asset but enable trading on both rising and falling asset prices without ownership.\n\nPlus500’s Local UAE Share CFDs\n\nIf trading local UAE stocks via CFDs appeals to you, here are the relevant share CFDs offered on the Plus500 platform:\n\nDubai Electricity Water Authority (DEWA.AE)\n\nFounded: 1992\n\nType: A government-owned utilities company.\n\nIndustry: Electricity, Water and District Cooling.\n\nEmirates NBD (EMIRATESNBD.AE)\n\nFounded: 1963\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nEmaar Properties (EMAAR.AE)\n\nFounded: 1997\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Real estate\n\nDubai Islamic Bank (DIB.AE)\n\nFounded: 1975\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nSalik Company (SALIK.AE)\n\nFounded: 2022\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Industrials\n\nAir Arabia (AIRARABIA.AE)\n\nFounded: 2003\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Aerospace\n\nDubai Financial Market (DFM.AE)\n\nFounded: 2000\n\nType: A stock exchange\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nEmaar Development (EMAARDEV.AE)\n\nFounded: 1997\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Real estate\n\nEmirates NBD (EMIRATESNBD.AE)\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Telecommunications\n\nTECOM Group (TECOM.AE)\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Real estate\n\nDubai Investments (DIC.AE)\n\nFounded: 1995\n\nType: A sovereign wealth fund\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nNational Central Cooling (TABREED.AE)\n\nFounded: 1998\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Water & Related Utilities\n\nAl Ansari Financial Services (ALANSARI.AE)\n\nFounded: 1966\n\nType: A private company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nGulf Navigation Holding (GULFNAV.AE)\n\nFounded: 2003\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Transportation\n\nDubai Taxi Company (DTC.AE)\n\nFounded: 1994\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Transportation\n\nAjman Bank (AJMANBANK.AE)\n\nFounded: 2008\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nGFH Financial Group B.S.C (GFH.AE)\n\nFounded: 1999\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nAramex (ARMX.AE)\n\nFounded: 1982\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Courier and logistics\n\nTaaleem Holdings (TAALEE.AE)\n\nFounded: 2003\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Education and training services\n\nDeyaar Development (DEYAAR.AE)\n\nFounded: 2001\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Real estate\n\nAmanat Holdings (AMANAT.AE)\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nUnion Properties (UPP.AE)\n\nFounded: 1987\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Real estate\n\nAmlak Finance (AMLAK.AE)\n\nFounded: 2000\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Financials\n\nEmirates Reem Investments (ERC.AE)\n\nFounded: 1980\n\nType: A public company\n\nIndustry: Beverages- Non-Alcoholic\n\nIf these companies’ shares pique your interest, you can start trading local UAE share CFDs with Plus500.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe UAE presents a robust economic environment rich in speculative trading opportunities, particularly for those looking to diversify their portfolios through local companies.\n\nBy trading CFDs on local UAE shares with Plus500, traders can access various stock sectors, from utilities and finance to real estate and telecommunications, without the need for asset ownership.\n\nAs the UAE continues to evolve and strive toward ambitious economic goals, traders can potentially benefit from the growth and diversification offered by the country's dynamic market.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhich are the best stocks in the UAE?\n\nThere’s no black or white answer to this question as the “best stocks” to trade depends on your risk tolerance and individual needs.\n\nHow can I buy UAE stocks?\n\nYou can buy UAE stocks through a stock exchange or open buy positions on Share CFDs contracts with a provider like Plus500.\n\nIs there any stock market in the UAE?\n\nYes, there are multiple stock markets in the UAE including: the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Nasdaq Dubai.\n\nIs stock trading allowed in the UAE?\n\nYes, stock trading is allowed in the UAE."
