        "text": "Move over Black Widow and step aside She-Hulk: Marvel Comics is introducing a new superhero – a 16-year-old Muslim-American girl named Kamala Khan, to reflect the growing diversity of its readers.\n\nThe character, who will be the new Ms Marvel, lives with her conservative Pakistani parents and brother in the US state of New Jersey.\n\nShe will make her debut in January and appear in a monthly series starting on February 6.\n\n“It is so important that we tell stories that reflect the ever-changing world that we live in and being a Muslim-American is so much a part of that,” said Sana Amanat, the series editor, who also worked on the Ultimate Spider-Man and Ultimate X-Men comic books.\n\nAlthough the inspiration for the new series came from a desire to explore the Muslim-American experience, she said it was not about what it meant to be a Muslim, Pakistani or American.\n\n“It is about a young girl who is figuring out who she is and what happens when these really extraordinary things happen to her,” she added in an interview.\n\nKhan is a big comic book fan and after she discovers her superhuman power – being a polymorph and able to lengthen her arms and legs and change her shape – she takes on the name of Ms Marvel. The title had previously belonged to Carol Danvers, a character Khan had always admired.\n\nThe idea for the new superhero stemmed from a casual conversation Amanat had with her senior editor, Steve Wacker, about her own experiences growing up as a Muslim-American.\n\n“He was interested in the dilemma I faced as a young girl and the next day he came in and said, ‘Wouldn’t it be great to have a superhero that was for all the little girls that grew up just like you, and who are growing up just like you are today, and to create a character they can be inspired by,'” Amanat said.\n\nThe writer, G Willow Wilson, a convert to Islam, and artist Adrian Alphona are working on the project, which started about 18 months ago.\n\nWilson said she created the character as a true-to-life person so that people, particularly young women, could relate to her.\n\nKhan experiences the usual teenage angst, feelings of confusion and being an outsider, dealing with the expectations of her parents and problems at high school.\n\n“It’s for all the geek girls out there, and everybody else who’s ever looked at life on the fringe,” Wilson said in a statement.\n\nKhan is not the first Muslim-American character in the superhero world, which has been largely dominated by white males, but Amanat said she was being pushed to the forefront of the Marvel universe.\n\n“People have been mostly positive about it,” she said, adding that the real test would come early next year when the series began."
