Russell Brand has reflected on his marriage to his 'amazing' ex-wife Katy Perry.

The British comedian, 48, was married to the pop star, 38, for just over one year after tying the knot in India in 2010, with the former couple's divorce being finalised in 2012.

Russell is now remarried to wife Laura and the couple have two daughters, while Katy has a baby daughter named Daisy with actor fiancé Orlando Bloom, 44.

During the most recent instalment of Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge, the English actor/comedian opened up about his former marriage to the pop star and his struggles with fame at the time.

'Some aspects of it were like amazing. She's an amazing person, and it was kind of incredible to live for a moment in that eye of the cyclone-type aspect of fame.

'Aside from my sort of feelings of affection for Katy, it's a time that I remember being a little bit chaotic and a bit, for me, to speak for myself, a little disconnected.'

Previously answering questions from the public on TikTok this week, Russell was asked about his first marriage and insisted he has 'nothing but positive feelings for her [Katy]'.

'I really tried in that relationship,' he admitted, adding: 'I have nothing but positive feelings for her.'

Last year, Katy gave her own thoughts on her ill-fated marriage to Russell, admitting the mix of success and love at such a young age was 'like a tornado'.

Speaking in an interview on Australian 60 Minutes in August 2020, Katy said: 'I was having great success at 23, 24 and 25 and then I met someone that was interesting and stimulating.

'It was just like a tornado, it was everything happening at once.'

Katy acknowledged that the marriage was not easy as she said she 'always resonated with friction and resistance and challenges'.

'He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,' Katy previously told Vogue magazine.

'Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.'

Katy was first linked to fiancé Orlando when they were seen flirting at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2016, and went public with their relationship a few months later in May at the Cannes Film Festival.

The couple parted ways just over a year later in March 2017, but the split wasn't to last and they got back together later that year.

The actor proposed to his long-term love on Valentine's Day in 2019 when he popped the question with a $5 million flower-shaped ring in front of Katy's entire family.

Katy and Orlando announced they were expecting their first child together last year, and welcomed baby daughter Daisy Dove Bloom into the world in August 2020.

It comes after Russel revealed he is expecting his third child with his wife Laura.

The comedian appeared with Steven Bartlett on The Diary of a CEO podcast , who made the announcement on his behalf.

Russell, who is proud dad to daughters Mabel, six, and Peggy, four, gave a rare insight into fatherhood and at one point, broke down in tears.

Stephen told him: 'You fell in love and you've got two children. You've got a third on the way, around the corner. That's a very special love you have found.'

Of being a father, Russell said: 'It taught me there is a lot more important in this world than me.

'There's a lot more important stuff in this world then what I want, think or reckon.

'It taught me that love is real. It teaches you everything to become a father. All lessons are there.'

The TV star then became emotional and fought back tears as he spoke about a 'future he won't be a part of', which Steven quizzed him on.

Not making much sense, he said: 'Any old man, any old woman. My little girls, it's just so beautiful.'

The couple married in 2017 at an intimate service near their home in Henley-on-Thames.
