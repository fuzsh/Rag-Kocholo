        "text": "Russell recently made headlines after The Sunday Times, The Times of London and Channel 4 Dispatches reported in a joint investigation that four women had accused the comedian of rape and sexual assault occurring between 2006 and 2013. Russell released a video statement on Friday, before the report was published, denying all allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nLaura’s Instagram account @thejoyjournal, which Russell referenced in the caption of a 2020 YouTube video and a March Instagram post, is currently unavailable. We were unable to verify when the account was deleted, and British outlets have reported different timelines for its removal either before or following the investigation. Laura otherwise has not commented publicly on the allegations against her husband.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Russell’s wife Laura and their family.\n\nRussell Brand’s current wife is Laura Brand\n\nLaura Brand (née Gallacher) is the daughter of golfer Bernard Gallacher, per The Independent, and grew up in Surrey, England. According to People, she lived on the Wentworth Estate, an exclusive private estate. Her sister, Kirsty Gallacher, is a radio presenter who previously worked for Sky Sports.\n\nAccording to People, it was Kirsty who first introduced the two in 2007. Russell told Stylist in 2016 that when they first met, he was 30 and Laura was 19. In a 2020 interview with You Magazine, which appears to no longer available but was preserved by the Internet Archive, Laura said that she “really fell in love” when they first met.\n\nPer You Magazine, Laura studied art before working in the hospitality industry. Eventually, according to People, she launched a lifestyle blog after leaving hospitality. And then, as she told Grazia in 2020, she reconnected with Russell after her friend dragged her out on a walk after her ex moved out of her flat. On the path, they coincidentally ran into him.\n\nThe couple were married in 2017, though they briefly dated in the late 2000s before Russell’s marriage to Katy Perry. According to People, they reunited romantically in 2015. Laura said in a 2020 episode of the podcast Made by Mammas that when she and Russell reconnected after his marriage to Perry ended, they “immediately knew it was going to be serious”. Then, she said, they slowly got to know each other again and worked to “rebuild [our] foundations and trust”.\n\nLaura has also published several books, including The Joy Journal for Magical Everyday Play and The Joy Journal for Grown-ups.\n\nThe couple’s first child, Mabel, was born in 2016\n\nLaura gave birth to the couple’s daughter Mabel in 2016, E! News reported in November of that year. The publication reported that Russell announced the birth of his child during a stand-up show, with an audience member telling E! News that he left the show quickly because Laura had given birth.\n\nHe previously announced his impending fatherhood in an Instagram post in July of that year, sharing a photo of him peeking over the cover of a book titled The Expectant Dad’s Handbook.\n\nThe couple do not frequently share photos of their children on social media, but Russell said on Today that he loved being a father.\n\n“She’s so beautiful and so glorious and so full of joy and love,” he told host Megyn Kelly. However, he jokingly added that his daughter Mabel was a “vicious, vindictive, villainous little character” who relentlessly tugged at his chest hairs.\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child, Peggy, in 2018\n\nThe couple had their second daughter, named Peggy, in 2018. In an interview with The Sunday Times when Peggy was six months old, Russell said that his wife Laura handled much of the domestic work of caring for their children and “wouldn’t go away for 24 hours” because she “respects and cares for their safety too much”.\n\n“It turns out that she is extremely well versed in the nuances and complexities of child-rearing,” Russell said of his wife. “Me, I am dedicated to it, devoted to it, but I am still surprised when it’s like, ‘Oh my God, this is f****** really hard and it’s so exhausting.’ The younger one, I just feel inept so quickly, like with the crying.”\n\nRussell and Laura announced that they were expecting their third child in June\n\nThe Diary of a CEO podcast host Steven Bartlett revealed during an interview with Russell in June that the couple are expecting another child.\n\n“You fell in love and you’ve got two children. You’ve got a third on the way, around the corner. That’s a very special love you have found,” Bartlett said."
