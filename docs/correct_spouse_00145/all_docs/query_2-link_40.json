        "text": "In a 2013 Vogue interview, the singer admitted she had at first felt “a lot of responsibility” for the divorce - until she “found out the real truth”.\n\nBut Perry said she would keep the “truth” a secret “for a rainy day” as she couldn’t “necessarily disclose”.\n\nThe resurfaced interview has prompted speculation about what the singer might have been referring to.\n\nBrand is accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old schoolgirl as well as raping a woman against the wall in his Los Angeles home, not long after his split from Perry.\n\nPerry said in the Vogue interview of her ex-husband, “He’s a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him.\n\n“Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.”\n\nShe admitted, “I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that.”\n\nThe pop star also looked back on her marriage in her documentary Part of Me, during which one scene showed her in tears before taking the stage at a show following a fight with her then-husband.\n\nThe pair first met in 2008 and married in 2010 with a luxurious wedding ceremony in India at the Ranthambore Tiger Sanctuary in Rajasthan.\n\nBut less than two years later they split, citing “irreconcilable differences”.\n\nBrand reflected on their relationship last month during an episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge.\n\n“Some aspects of it were, like, amazing. She’s an amazing person, and it was kind of incredible to live for a moment in that eye of the cyclone-type aspect of fame,” he said at the time."
