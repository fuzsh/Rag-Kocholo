        "text": "Katy Perry and Russell Brand marked their first meeting at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards when director Nick Stoller tapped the \"Dark Horse\" singer to have a brief cameo on Get Him to the Greek alongside Christina Aguilera and Pink.\n\nShe soon opened up about her love scene with Brand, who was playing Aldous Snow in the project.\n\n\"My scene called for me to make out with him,\" she told MTV. \"And on the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny. I hop like a bunny when I'm happy — I get a bit childlike.\"\n\nAt that time, Perry was dating Travie McCoy.\n\nRumors bombarded their marriage as reports claimed the then-couple was having marital problems. Brand dismissed them when he co-hosted Live With Regis and Kelly, saying they were happy together.\n\nStill, he noted that the attention they got from the media put stress on their marriage.\n\nNew talks surfaced when Perry appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she spoke about her desire to have children, leading people to assume she was already pregnant with their first child.\n\n\"I think that's one of the reasons you get married, and especially to the person that you marry,\" she said. \"You think, 'Hmmm, that person is going to be a good partner, a good parent.'\"\n\nThe gossip continued when she attended the American Music Awards. To put an end to the hearsay about them, she responded to comments that she had a small baby bump and told Hollyscoop she was not expecting a child yet.\n\nBrand filed for divorce from Perry in Los Angeles Superior Court, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason behind the filing.\n\nIn 2013, the American Idol judge revealed to Vogue that her estranged husband ended things between them via text.\n\n\"At first when I met him he wanted an equal,\" she said. \"…and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they're like, 'I can't handle the equalness.'\""
