        "text": "Katy Perry has opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about her failed marriage to Russell Brand and explains why she included it in her new movie.\n\nThe star, who has hardly mentioned her divorce from Brand, said she decided to include the break down of their relationship in her new film, Part of Me, to show a realistic account of her life.\n\nIn the film, the 27-year-old singer gives fans a frank and honest insight into her world, even appearing make-up free in many shots.\n\nKATY PERRY STYLE HIGHS AND LOWS\n\nKaty explained to Ellen: 'When you see the film, it’s a bit scary because there’s a lot of shots of me bloated with zits and normal.\n\n'I think it’s important to start breaking down the idea that to achieve your dream you always have to be perfect or flawless or live in some kind of fantasy world.\n\n'So that’s why I decided to put everything into the film,' she added.\n\n'In the most tasteful way. But mostly it’s about how I go there and the ride along the way which can be bumpy but mostly it was extremely fun.'\n\nKATY PERRY & RUSSELL BRAND DIVORCED FINALISED\n\nWhen asked by Ellen if the film still shows parts of her marriage to Russell, Katy said: 'I thought it was important to show everything in between. I think sometimes people think that we’re perfect and we know we’re not perfect, at all.'\n\nKaty was said to have been 'shocked' and 'blindsided' when Russell filled for divorce last December, just two months after their first anniversary.\n\nSHOCK CELEBRITY SPLITS\n\nKATY PERRY AND RUSSELL BRAND BEST MOMENTS"
