        "text": "Katy Perry signed her divorce papers with a smile — quite literally.\n\nThe pop singer, who just released her latest single “Woman’s World,” revealed online that she kept her hallmark smiley face and heart in her autograph even when signing her divorce papers from her ex Russell Brand.\n\n“I’ve always had a heart in my signature and a smiley face. Even when I was depressed, I would still sign it with a smiley face,” she said in a clip from a livestream that has since been reposted by fans.\n\n“I signed my divorce papers with a smiley face and a heart and that’s just because this is my signature,” she continued in the video, during which she was signing copies of her forthcoming album “143.” “Not because of anything else really.”\n\nIn the comments on TikTok, Perry’s fanbase praised the “Teenage Dream” singer\n\n“I can do it with a broken heart,” quipped one user who was quoting the Taylor Swift hit by the same name.\n\n“She finally got her smile back,” championed another.\n\nPerry, 39, married Brand, 49, in 2010, but the pair divorced in 2012.\n\nIn a Vogue interview the following year, the pop singer revealed that the British actor informed her he was filing for divorce over text.\n\n“Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011,” Perry said at the time.\n\nThe same interview resurfaced last year when multiple women came forward and accused Brand of sexual assault. In 2013, Perry had said that she “found out the real truth,” but couldn’t disclose it and chose to “keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.”"
