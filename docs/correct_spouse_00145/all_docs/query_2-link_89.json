        "text": "Katy Perry once seemingly hinted at knowing ‘the real truth’ about her ex-husband Russell Brand in a resurfaced interview.\n\nThe comedian, 48, featured in Channel 4 and The Times’ collaborative Dispatches episode on Saturday night in which he faced allegations of rape, sexual assault, and controlling and emotionally abusive behaviour.\n\nHe denied the ‘very very serious allegations’ in a video posted across his social media platforms on Friday night ahead of the episode, as well as an expose from the newspaper.\n\nFireworks hitmaker Perry, 38, made remarks about Brand in an interview following their breakup.\n\nThe pair’s whirlwind romance began in 2009, before they married on October 23, 2010, in a lavish ceremony at a tiger sanctuary in India.\n\nHowever, the pair split just 14 months later when Brand told Perry he wanted a divorce via text message before she was set to hit the stage.\n\n‘At first, when I met him, he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, “I can’t handle the equalness,”‘ she told Vogue in 2013.\n\nShe described his attitude towards her as ‘very controlling,’ especially when it came to her touring lifestyle before hinting at deeper issues with Brand and his behaviour.\n\n‘I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth,’ she said. ‘I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.’\n\nSimilarly, Dannii Minogue labelled Brand a ‘vile predator’ in an interview from 17 years ago.\n\nSpeaking to The Mirror at the Michele Watches Summer Party, she said of Brand: ‘He is completely crazy and a bit of a vile predator.\n\n‘I certainly don’t think he has cured his sex addiction, that’s for sure.’\n\n‘He wouldn’t take no for an answer,’ she added. ‘He always goes that step too far.\n\n‘Never quite far enough to slap his face, but usually too far.’\n\nMinogue continued: ‘He’s obviously very intelligent – but he wears more make-up than I do.\n\n‘Normally I love guys with eyeliner on. It can be very sexy, but not on Russell. Absolutely no way, never, he’s just not my type.’\n\nMinogue later said Brand had leched over her ‘fabulous breasts’ and claimed he followed her down a corridor and offered his phone number to her.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Katy Perry owes you nothing"
