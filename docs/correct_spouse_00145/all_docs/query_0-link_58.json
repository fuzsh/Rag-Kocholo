        "text": "Katy Perry and Russell Brand had a whirlwind relationship, with the former couple getting engaged, married and then subsequently divorced within a three-year period.\n\nThe singer, now 38, and the actor, now 48, are said to have begun their relationship back in 2009, with them having got engaged just months later. They tied the knot the following year and remained married until their divorce in 2012.\n\nThe marriage has attracted attention over the years, with there having been various claims about it, including that they had \"nothing in common\". It was also suggested that fame played a part in the breakdown of the relationship.\n\n'Nothing in common'\n\nThe pair are said to have clashed over partying and when they wanted to have children. It has previously been alleged that Katy and Russell had opposing lifestyles, which it was suggested had caused a lot of tension.\n\nAmid speculation about their separation, a source told the Mirror back in 2012: \"Their lives were heading in ­completely opposite directions.\" The source went on to state that the pair \"realised they had nothing in common and no future.\"\n\nThe source continued at the time: \"Russell left his party lifestyle behind a long time ago because it nearly killed him.\" They added: \"All he wanted to do is stay at home, do his yoga, keep his demons away and have a family with Katy.\"\n\nKaty travelled internationally on her California Dreams tour during their first year of marriage. The source said: \"When [she] had rare time off from her touring all she wanted to do was go out partying in Hollywood.\" They added: \"Russell was not ­interested and he'd had enough of the rowing.\"\n\nThe singer-songwriter later alleged that the pair had felt differently about having children, with her saying that she \"wasn't ready\" at the time. She also suggested that it would have been a \"way of control\" to keep her at home more.\n\nShe told Marie Claire during an interview in 2013: \"[Russell] really wanted me to have children, and I knew I wasn't ready – I think it was a way of control. I think it was part of, if I have a kid, then I would have to sacrifice – I'd have to be home more. I really wanted to, but I knew I wasn't ready for it.\"\n\nShe however told Vogue that same year: \"I have to claim my own responsibility in things. I do admit that I was on the road a lot. Although I invited him time and time again, and I tried to come home as much as I possibly could.\"\n\nDiscussing their relationship, Katy suggested that she didn't find it amusing when she caught him \"making jokes\" about her in a show. She said he hadn't known she was in the audience because she had come to surprise him.\n\nKaty further said that Russell had \"wanted an equal\" when they met, but she alleged that some men ultimately \"can't handle the equalness\". She claimed that he didn't like the \"atmosphere\" of her \"being the boss on tour,\" adding at the time that she found it \"really hurtful\" and \"controlling\".\n\n'A lot of game-playing'\n\nThere was said to have been \"a lot of game-playing\" in the relationship, with it suggested that this included towards the end of the marriage. They seemingly separated in 2011, though their divorce wasn't finalised until around 2012.\n\nIt reported that the former couple had an argument shortly before Christmas in 2011. Russell was said to have returned to the UK afterwards, whilst Katy reportedly headed to Hawaii with some pals. She was said to have turned her phone off and it was suggested she had wanted to call his bluff.\n\nKaty however was said to have been 'blindsided' by Russell subsequently filing for divorce and allegedly letting her know via text message. She told Vogue magazine in 2013 that she was informed by Russell that he was divorcing her in a text that she received on New Year's Eve that year.\n\nDiscussing the end of the relationship, a source said at the time: \"Katy was surprised that Russell didn't come running back but she had met her match. They are both strong-willed people and there has been a lot of game-playing going on.\"\n\n'Eye of the cyclone'\n\nKaty and Russell have both spoken about their relationship having come whilst at the height of their fame. He suggested that being in the spotlight contributed to their separation, whilst she once said her life was \"like a tornado\" at the time.\n\nDuring an appearance on John Bishop: In Conversation With in 2017, Russell said about that period of their lives: \"Katy was obviously very, very occupied and very busy. I was very occupied and very busy - not to the same degree, I recognize.\"\n\nHe further commented about the former couple's relationship: \"The marriage didn't last for a very long time and I think that is to do with the sort of undulating nature of fame and that, living in those conditions and what was happening.\"\n\nDiscussing the public nature of the relationship, Russell said on Running Wild With Bear Grylls earlier this year: \"That was when I was sort of most in the public eye and working in America. Some aspects of it were like amazing.\n\n\"She's an amazing person and it was incredible to live for a moment in that eye of the cyclone type aspect of fame. Aside from my sort of feelings of affection for Katy, it's a time that I remember as being a little bit chaotic and a bit for me, speaking for myself, a little disconnected.\""
