        "text": "Katy Perry has happily moved on since her split from ex-husband Russell Brand in 2011, which happened just 14 months after they tied the knot.\n\nBut sources close to the pop star, 38, have claimed that she still feels haunted by their marriage following the allegations of sexual assault and rape made against him.\n\n“This is an absolute nightmare for everyone and Katy feels sick to her stomach,” a source says . “She can’t believe she was married to someone accused of such horrible things. She fears that marrying Russell was the worst decision she ever made.\n\n“Katy has moved on with her life, but her first marriage might end up haunting her to the grave. You can imagine how upsetting this has been for her.”\n\nComedian and actor Russell has been accused of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse by four women. In a joint investigation by The Sunday Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches , it was claimed the alleged incidents took place at the height of his fame between 2006 and 2013.\n\nRussell, 48, who has been married to Laura Gallacher, 36, since 2017, has vehemently denied the allegations and insists all his relationships were “absolutely always consensual”.\n\nThe BBC, where Russell worked as a radio presenter between 2006 and 2008, said it was “urgently looking into the issues raised” by the allegations. Channel 4, where he was a presenter, has announced an internal investigation.\n\nKaty, who is now engaged to long-term partner Orlando Bloom, 46, who is father of her three-year-old daughter Daisy, previously claimed that Russell ended their marriage by text and the pair never spoke again.\n\nDespite the abrupt end to their relationship, our source says that Katy’s devoutly religious family stayed in contact with him.\n\n“They showed Russell so much love. They welcomed him into their home and treated him like a son,” they claim.\n\n“They kept in touch even after Russell and Kate separated and did their best to counsel him through what was a very difficult time.\n\n“They wanted to help and show how great God’s love can be. But Russell preferred to deal with things his own way. The Hudsons [Katy’s family name] tried to stick by him.”\n\nKaty has not publicly commented on the allegations against her ex-husband, who she married in a traditional Hindu ceremony in Rajasthan, India.\n\nHowever, an interview that she gave to Vogue in 2013 has since resurfaced. In it, she claimed she “found out the real truth” following their divorce, which was finalised in February 2012.\n\nDiscussing their relationship, Katy said, “At first when I met him, he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, ‘I can’t handle the equalness.’ He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting.”\n\nShe added, “I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth. I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go and I was like, ‘This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me.’ So I have moved on from that.”\n\nIn 2020, Katy compared their brief marriage to a “tornado”, adding that she has “always resonated with friction, resistance and challenges”.\n\nOther stars have spoken out about their uncomfortable encounters with Russell. Vanessa Feltz said she was “horrified” when he asked if he could “have it off” with her or her daughters on a 2006 chat show.\n\n“I went into that show with him, as, I thought, a friend, an admirer, that kind of thing,” she said.\n\n“But when someone starts talking about having sex with your daughter, your children… my daughter Saskia was 17 at the time. There has to be some kind of boundaries, some kind of politeness.”\n\nPop star Dannii Minogue accused Russell of being a “vile predator”, while television host Lorraine Kelly took a break from X, formerly Twitter, last week, after detailing how Brand had called her “a slut” on Graham Norton’s talk show.\n\n“It’s gone a bit dark,” she wrote, redirecting fans to her Instagram account for “mostly cute photos of my dog”.\n\nMeanwhile, Russell’s YouTube channel, which has 6.6 million subscribers, has been suspended from making money from adverts in the wake of the allegations against him."
