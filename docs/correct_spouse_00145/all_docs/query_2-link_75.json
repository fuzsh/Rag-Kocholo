        "text": "After Morgan revealed the singer’s nickname for Brand, he reportedly was “thrilled” and said, “He was a pretty powerful bloke, he could manipulate folk with his eyes.”\n\n“I like Rasputin... he was all right, wasn’t he... a mad monk with magical, mystical powers, having it off with everyone, drinking and getting into fights,” the star continued to say to the journalist.\n\nBrand and Perry were married for 14 months between October 2010 and December 2011 when the comedian broke up with her through text.\n\nIt comes after an investigation by The Sunday Times,The Times of London and Channel 4′s Dispatchesaccused the star of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse.\n\nFour women came forward with the allegations which they claimed occurred between 2006 and 2013 – the peak of Brand’s fame – with the youngest of the women being 16 at the time of the alleged offending.\n\nIn the days since the disturbing allegations, Brand has denied all claims, insisting that all of his relationships “were absolutely, always consensual”, however an investigation by the British police has been launched after they released a statement confirming they had received an official sexual assault accusation against Brand.\n\nPerry, who is engaged to her long-time partner Orlando Bloom, hasn’t broken her silence on the claims yet - but questions remain over what she might know about the situation, as she has claimed she knew the “real truth” about her ex-husband following their split.\n\nIn a 2013 Vogue interview, the singer admitted she had at first felt “a lot of responsibility” for the divorce - until she “found out the real truth”.\n\nBut Perry said she would keep the “truth” a secret “for a rainy day” as she couldn’t “necessarily disclose”.\n\nThe resurfaced interview has prompted speculation about what the singer might have been referring to."
