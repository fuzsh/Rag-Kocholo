        "text": "It’s been reported that Katy Perry feels “sick to her stomach\" following the allegations made against Russell Brand.\n\nThe comedian faces allegations of sexual abuse, rape and assault which emerged as the result of a combined investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches and The Times.\n\nIn a programme aired by Channel 4 on Saturday, September 16, four women shared their alleged experiences of abuse by Brand between 2006 and 2013 when the star was at the height of his fame. Brand has denied the allegations strenuously.\n\nThe former Channel 4 and BBC presenter married pop star Katy in 2010 and announced in December 2011 that they had decided to call it quits after just one year of marriage. He told the Firework star, now engaged to actor Orlando Bloom, he was ending their romance via a text message he sent on New Year’s Eve.\n\nThe mum-of-one is said to have been left “sick to her stomach” after the recent allegations.\n\nA source told OK! magazine : \"This is an absolute nightmare for everyone and Katy feels sick to her stomach. She [Katy] can’t believe she was married to someone accused of such horrible things. She fears that marrying Russell was the worst decision she ever made. Katy has moved on with her life, but her first marriage might end up haunting her to the grave. You can imagine how upsetting this has been for her.\"\n\nKaty and her ex husband were married at a lavish ceremony at the Aman-e-Khas luxury resort outside the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in India, which is also home to various animals, from camels to elephants and horses. Guests were given a chance to ride camels and elephants at the event. Katy later told Vogue after their split: “He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him. Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\"\n\nThe comments came after a source told the Mirror at the time that the pair had soon realised they had 'nothing in common'.\n\nKaty’s family stayed in touch with the actor and comedian after the split, as a source told OK!: ”They [Katy's parents] showed Russell so much love. They welcomed him into their home and treated him like a son. They kept in touch even after Russell and Kate separated and did their best to counsel him through what was a very difficult time.\"\n\nBrand has been married to Scottish blogger Laura Gallacher, 36, who is the daughter of Scots golf legend since 2017 and the pair were reportedly introduced by her sister Kirsty.\n\nEarlier this month, it emerged that four women are alleged to have come forward with the claims against comedian and actor Brand.\n\nThe BBC is also investigating a claim that he flashed a woman before laughing about it on his radio show.\n\nThe incident allegedly happened in 2008 when the woman was working in the same building as the corporation's office in Los Angeles, BBC News reported.\n\nBrand was a presenter on BBC Radio 2 and Channel 4 and starred in several Hollywood films around the time the allegations are claimed to have taken place.\n\nBrand has denied the allegations made against him in a YouTube video released before the article and documentary went live after he received a letter and email from a newspaper and TV company.\n\nHe said he “absolutely refutes” the claims made against him and says his relationships were “absolutely, always consensual”.\n\nHe said: ”Now, this isn't the usual type of video we make on this channel where we critique, attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story, I am the news. I've received two extremely disturbing letters or a letter and an email. One from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks, as well as some pretty stupid stuff like community festival should be stopped, that I shouldn't be able to attack mainstream media narratives on this channel.\n\n”But amidst this litany of astonishing rather baroque attacks, often very serious allegations that I absolutely refute. These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies. And as I've written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous.\n\n”Now, during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual. I was always transparent about that. Then almost too transparent, and I'm being transparent about it now as well. And to see that transparency metastasised into something criminal that I absolutely deny makes me question, is there another agenda at play? Particularly when we've seen coordinated media attacks before, like with Joe Rogan, when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream media didn't approve of, and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language.\n\n”I'm aware that you guys have been saying in the comments for a while, watch out, Russell. They're coming from you. You're getting too close to the truth. Russell Brand did not kill himself. I know that a year ago there was a spate of articles. Russell Brand’s a conspiracy theorist, Russell Brand’s right wing. I'm aware of news media making phone calls, sending letters to people I know for ages and ages. It's being clear to me, or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices. And I mean, my voice along with your voice.\n\n”I don't mind them using my books and my standout to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past. What I seriously refute are these very, very serious criminal allegations. Also, it's worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narrative that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct, apparently, in what seems to me to be a coordinated attack.\n\n”Now, I don't wanna get into this any further because of the serious nature of the allegations, but I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they're working very closely together. We are obviously going to look into this matter 'cause it's very, very serious. In the meantime, I want you to stay close, stay awake, but more important than any of that, if you can, please stay free.”\n\nOn Friday, he released another statement.\n\nHe said: \"Hello there you awakening wonders, obviously, it's been an extraordinary and distressing week and I thank you very much for your support and for questioning the information you've been presented with. By now, you're probably aware that the British government have asked big tech platforms to censor our online content.\n\n\"Some online platforms, have complied with that request. What you may not know is that this happens in the context of the Online Safety Bill – this is UK legislation that grants sweeping surveillance and censorship powers and is a law that has already been passed. I also don't imagine that you've heard of the trusted news initiative and now, as often is the case when a word like trusted is used as part of an acronym to describe an unelected body, trust is the last thing you should be offering.\n\n\"The trusted news initiative is a collaboration between big tech and legacy media organisations to target, patrol, choke and shut down independent media organisations like this one. We'll be talking about that on our show on Monday on Rumble.\""
