        "text": "Katy Perry's romance with ex-husband Russell Brand was sparked during a cinematic moment in the 2010 film Get Him to the Greek in which he portrayed her love interest.\n\nWhile the former couple's romantic on-screen scene never made it to the big screen, it opened the gateways for a real-life romance, which could only be described as \"weird\" and \"short-lived\" by fans across the internet.\n\nThe Firework singer recalled the encounter in a 2010 Glamour interview, after shooting a kissing scene with Brand, an overly joyful Perry hopped \"like a bunny” as they left the set.\n\nThe scene was ultimately omitted as Perry felt its inclusion might seem “too … literal.”\n\nThe former duo's relationship took a bold turn at the VMAs the following year with Perry, recalling she threw a bottle at Brand, hitting him on the head, signifying that he had “met his match,” in an interview to Esquire.\n\nIn an interview with Metro, Brand highlighted the surging chemistry he felt, describing it as \"natural\" and \"just like we were mates\".\n\nAfter four months of dating and cute public appearances, the pair announced their engagement in January 2010.\n\nThe former celeb couple exchanged wedding vows during a Hindu ceremony in India later the same year in October.\n\nBrand described the wedding as \"mundane and spectacular\" in an interview with Details Magazine.\n\nJust a year after their wedding, Brand announced the couple were parting ways.\n\nHe noted his ongoing affection for the pop singer saying he hoped they'd \"remain friends.\"\n\nPerry revealed to Vogue in 2013 Brand initiated the break up via text.\n\n“He’s a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,” Perry told Vogue in 2013. “Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.”\n\nBrand continued to speak extremely highly of his time with Perry during appearances on Today and Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\n\nIn 2017, Brand married Laura Gallacher with whom he has two daughters, Mabel and Peggy.\n\nBacktracking a year to 2016, Perry began dating Pirates of The Caribbean actor Orlando Bloom. The couple welcomed their daughter, Daisy Dove, into the world in 2020.\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with 60 Minutes Australia, the 36-year-old Teenage Dream singer described their relationship as “a tornado,” drawing a contrast with her current relationship, which she termed “healthy frictional.”\n\nIn 2017 the couple briefly broke up, with Perry ranking Bloom the second best in bed experience she's had on an episode of Spill Your Guts on James Corden's The Late Late Show.\n\nIn 2018 the couple got back together after being spotted in Prague.\n\nPerry made waves during her and Brand's early dating phase in 2009 after showcasing her dedication to the actor with a nod to his favourite soccer team, West Ham FC, on her outfit during the MTV European Music Awards.\n\nAs the years passed, both parties shared their views on the end of the short-lived marriage, with Perry citing the challenges of both being in the limelight and Brand attributing it to being at distinct life stages."
