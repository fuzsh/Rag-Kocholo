        "text": "File Katy Perry and Russell Brand under couples who DIDN’T remain friendly after getting divorced!\n\nIn his new documentary, Brand: A Second Coming, the 40-year-old comedian has some harsh words for his pop star ex, whom he was married to for 14 months, ending in 2012.\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry Follows “Slutty Taylor Swift” Instagram Account\n\nThe actor explains that his visit to Africa as part of Comic Relief in 2010 was the beginning of the end for their relationship.\n\n“The stuff in Africa hit me really hard,” Russell says in the movie. “I’m associated with the very thing I detest: vapid, vacuous, plastic, constructed, mindless celebrity. That’s the very sea we’re swimming in: ‘Oh, who’s he? He’s married to Katy Perry.’”\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry, Channing Tatum and More Celebrities You Didn’t Realize Have Imperfect Smiles\n\nBut referring to the 30-year-old as “vapid” is hardly the worst of it. While talking to close friend Stephen Merchant, he admits that he doesn’t think his marriage to Katy will last (they were together during the filming of the doc).\n\n“It’s definitely good I’m with someone I love,” he says. “But it’s not a resolution to anything spiritual. This is my suspicion, that at some point, to be happy, I’m going to have to walk away.”\n\nYikes. That’s not something we’d ever want to hear.
