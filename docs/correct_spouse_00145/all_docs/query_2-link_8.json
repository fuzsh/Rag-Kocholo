        "text": "Katy Perry once claimed to know the “real truth” about Russell Brand, who has now been accused of raping four women — but promised to “keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.”\n\nThe cryptic comments from Perry, who split with Brand in 2012 after the English comedian asked for a divorce via text, came in a 2013 Vogue interview.\n\nBrand is notably accused in one assault which happened just months after his divorce to the pop phenom.\n\n“I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day,” the singer said. “I let go and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that.”\n\nPerry refused to elaborate on what she knew about Brand, with fans speculating at the time that Brand could have been jealous and unsupportive of his ex-wife’s stardom, which eclipsed his own.\n\nThe theory came after the “American Idol” judge said Brand didn’t like her being the “boss,” and described him as “very controlling” in the interview with Vogue.\n\nWhile the pop singer has remained silent about her ex, her previous comments have resurfaced following the allegations levied against Brand that he sexually assaulted four women, including a 16-year-old, between 2006 and 2013, according to a joint investigation published Saturday by the Times of London and Channel 4 Dispatches.\n\nFollowing the report, the BBC – where Brand had worked as a radio presenter during the time of the first assaults – said it as a launched its own internal investigation into the allegations. The production company Banijay UK is launching its own probe.\n\nOne of the accusers, named Nadia, claimed that the English actor raped her “against a wall” in his Los Angeles home in July 2012, five months after the divorce with Perry was finalized.\n\nNadia was treated at a rape crisis center the same day, according to medical records cited by investigative reporters.\n\nBy then, Perry was completely out of Brand’s life, with the “Roar” singer telling Vogue: “Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.”\n\nThe moment was especially painful for Perry, which was reflected in her “Part of Me” documentary when she sobbed after receiving his break-up text right before she was set to perform on stage.\n\nThe couple had been together since 2009 — they hit it off after she made a cameo in his film, “Get Him to the Greek,” and the pair started officially dating following that year’s MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nPerry and Brand were married the following year, with their marriage lasting only 14 months.\n\nIn 2016, Perry got together with actor Orlando Bloom, who proposed to her in 2019. The couple are engaged and share 3-year-old daughter Daisy Dove.\n\nBrand, now a father-of-two, is currently married to wife Laura Gallacher.\n\nThe British star denied the rape allegations moments before the report detailing the disturbing accusations was published.\n\n“Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,” he said, claiming that his sexual relationships were “always consensual.”"
