        "text": "With sparks flying when they first met at the 2008 VMAs, Katy Perry and Russell Brand began their whirlwind relationship the following year and just a mere three months later were engaged to be married.\n\nAfter the British comic got down on bended knee to pop the question at the Taj Mahal in India on New Year's Eve, they decided to forego a traditional Western wedding in their respective homes in the States and UK and hold their stunning, scenic ceremony in India. The then-couple, who didn't realise that they would be parting ways only fourteen months later, spared no expense with the ceremony, which incorporated a fusion of traditional Indian and modern Western cultures.\n\nBut pal David Baddiel admitted he was at the wedding and Russell confided in him before he tied the knot.\n\nBack in 2017 the comic said: \"Can I say that I was at Katy Perry’s first wedding? I was there…Russell did tell me that they had a big row the night before they got married. I did think when he said that, of asking, “Are you sure?” but I didn’t say that. Perhaps I should have done.\"\n\nRussell and Katy held their nuptials at the Aman-e-Khas luxury resort outside the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary, also home to various animals, from camels to elephants and horses. Guests were given a chance to ride camels and elephants. However, there was a terrifying turn of events when a wild tiger snuck in on proceedings and got within fifty feet of the couple and celebrating guests. A local official revealed at the time: \"This particular tiger has killed before. It came into the compound at 11pm, with the party at its peak, and caused pandemonium among staff.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it wasn't just the wildlife that stole the show, as Russell and the Fireworks hitmaker had an array of famous faces at the ceremony, including David Walliams, Jonathan Ross and P Diddy. At their intimate and private wedding ceremony, the loved-up pair and their guests wore traditional Indian clothes.\n\nThe extravagant experience also included the comedian and Teenage Dream songstress entertaining their attendees with a Bollywood banquet with drummers, dancers, fire eaters, and snake charmers. The showbiz pair also showed off their matching Anuugacchati Pravaha tattoos, which translates to \"go with the flow.\"\n\nHowever, only 14 months into their marriage, Russell broke up with Katy over a text message. It was alleged Russell, aged 36 at the time, was struggling with Katy's superstar fame. Their divorce was finalised in 2012. The relationship had always seemed a lost cause from the British comic's side, as Katy's efforts in trying to make the relationship work were documented in her 2012 documentary film Part Of Me, where she was frequently filmed in despair over the amount of time she was spending away from Russell.\n\nTwo years after their split, Katy reflected on why their marriage didn't last. She told Vogue in 2013 that while Russell had wanted his partner to be his \"equal\" when they first met, he ultimately could not \"handle the equalness\".\n\n\"He didn't like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting,\" she recalled. \"I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can't necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go, and I was like: This isn't because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brand is now the centre of an investigation by The Times, the Sunday Times and Channel 4's Dispatches over rape allegations and claims of sexual and emotional abuse, which are alleged to have taken place between 2006 and 2013. Brand has denied the allegations and said that his relationships have been consensual. He shared a video on Friday ahead of the documentary in which he denied the \"very serious, criminal allegations\".\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook to make sure you're not missing out."
