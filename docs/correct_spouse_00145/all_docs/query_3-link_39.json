        "text": "Even after seven years together, Orlando Bloom says there's still plenty of surprises when it comes to his relationship with Katy Perry.\n\nThe actor appeared on the cover of the new issue of Flaunt magazine, opening up to the outlet about his “baby mama and life partner” and how they've kept their relationship going so strong for all these years. “We're in two very different pools,” Bloom admitted, referring to their very different creative professions. “Her pool is not a pool that I necessarily understand, and I think my pool is not a pool that she necessarily understands. Sometimes things are really, really, really, challenging. I won't lie.” The Lord of the Rings star continued, “We definitely battle with our emotions and creativity, [but] I think we're both aware of how blessed we are to have uniquely connected in the way that we did at the time that we did, and there's definitely never a dull moment.”\n\nPerry and Bloom first met in 2016 at a Golden Globes after party and then reconnected over burgers later that night. On an episode of American Idol, the pop star explained, “I met my boyfriend over In-N-Out. We were at the Golden Globes and we weren't together. So I had my security guard grab 10 In-N-Outs and all of a sudden I see my boyfriend's hand—he wasn't even sitting at our table—he just swoops in and he grabs it and I was like, 'Hey that's my burger!'” Three years later, the actor proposed to the singer on Valentine's Day. A week later, during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Perry recalled, “It was very sweet. It was Valentine's Day…we went to dinner and I thought we were going to go see some art after dinner but we pulled up to a helicopter. We landed on a rooftop [in Los Angeles]—my whole family was there, and all my friends. He did so well.” And in August 2020, the couple welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove."
