        "text": "RUSSELL Brand has revealed he would like to be friends with his ex-wife Katy Perry, six years after he ended their marriage by text.\n\nThe comedian, 42, who is now married to Laura Gallacher and a father, famously dumped the pop star in 2011 after being married for just 14 months.\n\nBut now he is hoping to put all that behind them, telling Grazia magazine: “I’m willing and open for reconciliation, any kind.\n\n\"Because if we can’t overcome our relatively trivial personal disputes in this world, what hope is there for us?”\n\nAnd despite the marriage lasting just over a year, the Get Him To The Greek star has no regrets.\n\nHe continued: “It was a very important and lovely time in my life. I don’t regret being married to Katy at all.\n\n“I have very positive feelings about that whole experience and Katy is an extraordinary woman.”\n\nDuring their whirlwind romance Katy, now 32, and Russell got matching tattoos that read Go with the flow in Sanskrit and Russell has now revealed he has no intention of removing it.\n\nHe told the magazine: “Of course I’m going to keep it.”\n\nKaty previously told Vogue magazine that she hadn’t heard from her ex since he called it quits on their marriage.\n\nShe said: “He’s a very smart man, a magical man and I was in love with him when I married him.\n\n“Let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.”\n\nThe singer, who was filming a documentary about her world tour at the time of the break up, has said she thinks her hectic work schedule played a part in the split – but also hinted that something else was going on that contributed to it.\n\n“I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day,” she teased.\n\n“I let go and I was like, ‘This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me.’ So I have moved on from that.”\n\nKaty is currently enjoying an on/off relationship with Orlando Bloom, after previously dating John Mayer for a number of years.\n\nRussell wed Laura Gallacher - with who he has ten-month-old daughter Mabel - in front of their celebrity friends last month.\n\nThe couple had a small service at Remenham Church near their home in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\n\nA source told The Sun: \"They wanted a very small, personal affair with their daughter Mabel, family and close friends rather than a circus. It was a lovely occasion. Mabel was guest of honour.\"\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220."
