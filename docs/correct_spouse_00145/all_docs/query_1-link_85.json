        "text": "Russell Brand allegedly raped a woman in his home just five months after he finalized his divorce from Katy Perry.\n\nIn a bombshell exposé published by the Sunday Times Saturday, an accuser who went by the name Nadia alleged that the comedian raped her “against a wall” in his Los Angeles home in July 2012.\n\n“I’m stuck underneath the painting and he’s pushing up against me,” she alleged to the British newspaper.\n\n“He’s a lot taller than me. And he has that glazed look in his eye again. And I can’t move. And I told him, ‘Get off, get off.’”\n\nThe “Get Him to the Greek” star, 48, allegedly did not have on a condom when the alleged rape occurred.\n\nBrand had just settled his divorce with Perry, now 38, in February of that same year.\n\nAside from Nadia, three other women accused the “Rock of Ages” star — who was married to the “Dark Horse” singer from 2010 to 2012 — of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse in incidents that allegedly took place between 2006 and 2013.\n\nPage Six has reached out to reps for Perry and Brand but did not immediately hear back. The “Hot N Cold” singer has not yet spoken out about the accusations made about her ex.\n\nAnother accuser, who went by Alice in the report, claimed the comic was “emotionally abusive and controlling” during their three-month relationship when she was just 16. At one point, she said Brand allegedly sexually assaulted her by forcing “his penis down her throat” to the point where she choked.\n\nA day before the allegations surfaced, Brand released a video denying the claims.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I have received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of egregious and aggressive attacks,” he shared in a video message on Instagram.\n\n“Amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”\n\nThe “Forgetting Sarah Marshall” star did not say what the allegations against him were, but noted that he had a “promiscuous” past and said all of his relationships “were absolutely always consensual.”\n\nPerry and Brand began dating in 2009 before they tied the knot the following year. They were only married for 14 months before the actor famously dumped the “American Idol” judge via text just minutes before she was due to perform on stage."
