        "text": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are parents to toddler Daisy Dove, but they may be looking to expand their brood. In an August 2022 interview with People, Perry hinted that she’s interested in having more children: “I'm a planner,” she said. “So we’ll see.”\n\nIn 2019, Perry and Bloom got engaged after three years of dating on-and-off. Although they had to postpone their wedding due to COVID-19, the couple is still looking forward to tying the knot.\n\nWhile we await their nuptials, here's a detailed look into Perry and Bloom’s relationship.\n\nJanuary 2016: Perry and Bloom meet for the first time at a party.\n\nAfter the 2016 Golden Globe Awards wrapped, Perry and Bloom both headed to an after party. The two began flirting at the event, where a Us Weekly source reported that they were “extremely flirty and whispering to each other” at the event. The two had undeniable chemistry throughout the night, with photos from the event showing the two smiling and laughing as they interacted with each other. “He would lean in to whisper into her ear and touch the small of her back as they chatted,” the source said. Later in the night, Perry and Bloom were spotted leaving the party together.\n\nFebruary 2016: Bloom introduces Perry to his son.\n\nA source revealed to People that Perry spent time with Bloom’s son, Flynn, from his previous relationship with Miranda Kerr. Flynn was five at the time, and he spent time with Perry at a children’s birthday party at Robert Downey Jr.’s house.\n\n“They were laughing, playing music and joking around with Flynn,” the insider said.\n\nAnother source shared that Bloom attended Perry’s pre-Grammys Creators Party presented by Spotify later that same month.\n\nApril 2016: Perry and Bloom attend Coachella together.\n\nPerry and Bloom made the trek down to Indio, California, to attend the annual Coachella Music Festival together. “They were hugging and with a group of other people,” a festival-goer told E! News. “Orlando was behind her and swaying with her to the music. They also were vaping together. They were kissing and very much a couple.”\n\nMay 2016: Perry makes their relationship official on Instagram.\n\nPerry made their relationship Instagram official by posting a cute picture of the couple lounging in robes on the steps of a building in Cannes, France.\n\nAugust 2016: Perry and Bloom go on a vacation together to Italy.\n\nPerry and Bloom are spotted out and about again, this time on vacation in Italy. Paparazzi snapped the couple paddleboarding together, and Bloom was completely nude when he took his girlfriend out on the water. Naturally, the pictures caused a stir on the Internet.\n\nThat same month, a source told People that Bloom “always gushes about Katy and thinks she is amazing in a million ways,” and would not mind starting a family with the singer. “He would love to settle down with Katy and have more kids. He hasn’t been this serious about a girl since Miranda.” Bloom has had one child, a 9-year-old son named Flynn, with his ex-wife, Miranda Kerr.\n\nOctober 2016: Perry and Bloom couple up in costume for Halloween.\n\nThe couple decide to dress up for Halloween as Hillary and Bill Clinton, complete with a cartoonish Donald Trump following them.\n\nNovember 2016: Bloom spends Thanksgiving with Perry's family.\n\nPerry documented on Instagram that Bloom was over to spend the holiday with her family. The couple wore adorable matching plaid onesies and prepared meals with each other throughout the day. The following month, Bloom joined Perry's family again for Christmas.\n\nDecember 2016: Bloom and Perry dress up as Santa and Mrs. Claus.\n\nOn December 19, Bloom and Perry dressed up as Santa and Mrs. Claus and surprised the kids at the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.\n\n“Never naughty, always nice. The kids at CHLA received a much-deserved visit from Santa and Mrs. Claus … who happen to look a lot like Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom!” the hospital posted to their Facebook.\n\nJanuary 2017: Perry plans a massive surprise party for her boyfriend.\n\nFor Bloom's 40th birthday, Perry planned a massive party for her boyfriend in Palm Springs, California, where she surprised him with a visit from his mother, Sonia Copeland Bloom. Bloom called it the “best gift ever.”\n\nFebruary 2017: Perry and Bloom officially break up.\n\nAfter 10 months of dating, Perry and Bloom decided to call off their relationship. Their reps released a joint statement explaining that they needed time apart: “Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time.”\n\nA source told E! that the split was initiated by Perry, but the feeling was mutual. “Katy pulled the plug. It was a few events that happened over the past few months. They both still love each other very much, though, and getting back together could happen once they have some space.” Despite the split, the pair chose to remain friendly to maintain the bond Perry had with his son. “Katy has built a really strong connection with Flynn. It's sad but it will work out how it's supposed to,” the source added.\n\nMarch 2017: Perry shuts down rumors that she and Bloom had a nasty split.\n\nPerry took to Twitter to clear the air, adamantly explaining to fans that things between her and her former boyfriend were just fine. “HOW BOUT A NEW WAY OF THINKING FOR 2017!? U can still b friends & love ur former partners! No one's a victim or a villain, get a life y'all!” she tweeted.\n\nApril 2017: Perry and Bloom are still friends post-breakup.\n\nBloom discussed his relationship status with Perry post-breakup.\n\n“We’re friends, it’s good.” he said. “We’re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don’t think anybody cares about what I’m up to. Nor should they. It’s between us. It’s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don’t have to be about hate.”\n\nJune 2017: Perry ranks Bloom second best in bed in her list of ex-boyfriends.\n\nOn James Corden's “Spill Your Guts” segment, Perry was asked to list her ex-boyfriends in order of worst to best in bed, or be forced to eat a disgusting dish. “They’re all amazing lovers and I would have sex with all of them after I get out of this place,” she said. She confirmed with a head nod that Orlando fells in the middle; Diplo ranked the worst, and John Mayer the best.\n\nAugust 2017: A fan sees Perry and Bloom together.\n\nPerry and Bloom were spotted attending an Adele concert together, raising suspicions that they might be dating again.\n\nMarch 2018: Perry and Bloom go out together in Prague.\n\nBloom was filming TV series Carnival Row in Prague, and Perry went to visit him. This only heightened the rumors that they were dating again, but the duo were reportedly keeping things casual this time around.\n\n“After Orlando and Katy split, they stayed in touch. It wasn’t some awful split. They were just busy with their careers and it wasn’t working,” a source told People. “In the past few months, they have spent a lot of time together. They both love traveling and are trying to share as many fun trips as possible. They are dating, but not necessarily putting a label on it. They are not girlfriend and boyfriend. They do seem very happy together though. Orlando always had the nicest things to say about Katy. He loves spending time with her.”\n\nApril 2018: Perry and Bloom visit the Vatican.\n\nWhile at the Vatican, Perry and Bloom met the Pope and posed for a lovely picture showing support of The Cura Foundation.\n\nMay 2018: Perry confirms that she is no longer single.\n\nOn the season finale of American Idol, Perry shared a fangirl moment with Bachelorette star Becca Kufrin, and revealed that she's off the market. “I’m not single but I still like you,” she told the reality TV starlet.\n\nSeptember 2018: Perry and Bloom make their first red carpet appearance together.\n\nThe couple took the next big step in their relationship by making it red carpet official. The two attended the Gala for the Global Ocean, hosted by H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco, and looked smitten with each other.\n\nDecember 2018: Perry buys a date with Bloom.\n\nAt the One Love Malibu Festival charity auction on December 2, a date with Bloom was one of the big prizes. Perry herself helped auction him off, saying, “You can do a motorcycle ride with him to a lunch destination to have lunch with Orlando freaking Bloom. That also means that when you are on the motorcycle with him you’re holding him in a way that I am not excited about.”\n\nOne Bloom fan placed a bid for $20,000, but Perry ultimately won and bought the date for herself for $50,000.\n\nFebruary 2019: Perry announces their engagement.\n\nJust a day after Valentine's Day, Perry took to Instagram to share an adorable snap of her and her man huddled together. The photo supplied a clear look at her flower-shaped ruby and diamond engagement ring. The ring is reportedly 4.5 karats and had a estimated retail value of a whopping $5 million.\n\n“Orlando had planned this for a while,” a source close to the couple told People. “He wanted it all to be special.” And to accommodate Perry's more traditional parents, Bloom made sure to ask for permission first before popping the question. “Katy’s family knew he was proposing. He talked to her parents about it before...Katy was very surprised and shaking with happiness...They both want kids together and will prioritize this.”\n\nPerry later spoke about the proposal during a Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp interview. “It was Valentine’s Day and I had to work that day,” she said, via People. “I just remember meeting him at dinner at this place, this Italian restaurant, because when I get a pass, I just want to stuff my face with pasta. So I get there and, I mean, he’s like clean-shaven. He’s not wearing tennis shoes. I’m like, ‘Ah shit, something is going down!’ We were ordering everything, and I was like, ‘Who is this person?!’”\n\nBloom then took her onto a helicopter after dinner. “I got on a helicopter and he asked me to marry him, and then we landed on this building and then went downstairs and my family and friends were there and the most flowers you’ve ever seen. It’s like when Kanye does that for Kim, you’re like, ‘Oh my God!' And I was like, ‘Oh my God!’”\n\nMarch 2019: Bloom and Perry move in together.\n\nA source close to Bloom told People that he moved into Perry’s home and is selling his own, stating that it’s “much more private.”\n\n“Since they are engaged, it was just a natural step for them to live together,” the insider revealed. They also added that Bloom’s ex-wife, Kerr, “doesn’t have an issue” with it.\n\n“Miranda knows Katy and the two get along. Miranda doesn’t have an issue with Flynn being at Katy’s house when Orlando has custody. Everyone is getting along great,” the source detailed.\n\nAdditionally that same month, a source opened up to People about the vibe of Perry and Bloom’s upcoming wedding. The insider said that the pair is “slowly planning their wedding,” but “they don’t have a date yet.”\n\n“Their past weddings [Perry's to ex-husband Russell Brand and Bloom's to ex-wife Miranda Kerr] were, of course, very different,” adds the Bloom source. “They are trying to find a middle ground now.” The source also noted, “Orlando always shied away from anything flashy. He doesn’t want a huge, celebrity wedding. But they also have many friends that are important to them. They are still figuring out the details. Katy will work with a planner.”\n\nJune 2019: Perry says she's in no rush to plan her wedding.\n\nThe singer made it clear during an interview on KISS Breakfast with Tom & Daisy that she was in no rush to race down the aisle. “Well yeah, one step at a time,” Perry said when asked about a date. “Definitely trying to, like, lay the good emotional foundation for the lifetime of commitment, which is, like, a big deal, you know?”\n\nJuly 2019: Bloom explains how he and Perry deal with being long distance.\n\nBecause of their hectic jobs, the couple has to spend a lot of time apart, but they still find the time to make it work.\n\n“That's part of the job, right?” Bloom told People on July 27. “You have to do the groundwork together, create the feeling of trust and safety so that you can spend time apart and do everything that you need to do and still feel tethered to that person, so that you can go on a journey together.”\n\nAugust 2019: Bloom opens up about his future marriage to Perry.\n\nDuring an appearance on Today, Bloom spoke about their future, emphasizing a need to connect prior to walking down the aisle. “It’s important to me that we are aligned—I’ve been married and divorced, and I don’t want to do it again,” Bloom shared. “And we’re both fully aware of that. She’s remarkable and so I’m always so impressed with that and I’m encouraged.”\n\nDecember 2019: Perry and Bloom postpone their wedding.\n\nUs Weekly reported that the couple, who had previously been planning a December wedding, postponed the nuptials. A source told the outlet, “they changed the timing due to the location they want.”\n\nIn fact, the couple is reportedly planning two ceremonies in two different locations. “They’re going have one local wedding party, and the other will be a destination wedding party,” a source told Us. Concerns about what the date change may mean for the couple should be kept at bay, the source adding, “They’re beyond in love.”\n\nE! also spoke to a source about why Perry and Bloom are postponing their wedding to 2020. “They wanted to get married quickly but scheduling and pulling everything together has proven to be difficult,” the source said. “The wedding was supposed to be in September, then December and now early next year. They have had to move things around because Katy has grand ideas of where and how she wants things to be.”\n\n“They have the guest list figured out and many of the details,” the source continued. “They hope to have everything finalized soon because they are very excited about getting married.”\n\nJanuary 2020: The couple rings in the new year together.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Perry shared a photo of herself and Bloom in 2020 glasses while snuggling with their dogs. “when you’re in bed before midnight is when you know you’re starting the new year right #2020,” she captioned the post.\n\nThe following day, Perry's January 2020 Vogue India cover dropped. During the interview, she opened up about how Bloom was “an anchor” for her. “He’s not the No. 1 fan of Katy Perry, but he’s the No. 1 fan of Katheryn Hudson,” she explained, referring to her birth name. She continued, “When we first met, he said we would pull the poison out of each other, and we really do. It’s exhausting, but we really hold each other accountable.”\n\nFebruary 2020: They celebrate a year of engagement.\n\nPerry honored both Valentine's Day and the one-year anniversary of her engagement to Bloom with a sweet IG post. She shared a series of black-and-white photos from the couple's engagement party, writing, “one year ago I said yes to a life of love and evolution... and definitely never a dull moment 😜.” Bloom responded, “We don’t do dull doe ❤️.”\n\nMarch 2020: Perry announces she's pregnant.\n\nHours after the singer teased her new music video and sparked pregnancy rumors, she confirmed she's expecting in the video for “Never Worn White.” In addition to cradling her pregnant stomach in the video, Perry shared a snippet of the song on Instagram, writing, “Let’s just say it’s gonna be a jam packed summer... 🎶♥️🙂 #NeverWornWhite is out now.”\n\nShe also divulged details of her pregnancy to fans on her Instagram Story and Twitter. “I’m excited, we’re excited, and happy,” Perry said on her IG Story. “It’s probably the longest secret I’ve ever had to keep. I thought I would tell you guys in the best way through a piece of music.” She also tweeted her excitement for not having to hide the bump any longer.\n\nApril 2020: Perry and Bloom announce they're having a girl.\n\nPerry posted a photo of her fiancé with pink icing all over his face. “💕 it’s a girl 💕,” she wrote in the caption. The couple is reportedly overjoyed to welcome their daughter into their family and consider her birth something happy to look forward to during the coronavirus global pandemic.\n\n“They are both so excited about having a baby. They are also ecstatic that it's a girl,” a source told People. “They love that they have this amazing, positive thing to focus on right now. It’s such a happy distraction for them. Katy really hopes everything has calmed down with the virus by the time the baby will be born this summer.”\n\nOn the heels of Perry and Bloom's gender reveal, a source told People that the couple is preparing to be parents during quarantine. “It’s a stressful time for them like for most people,” the insider told People. “They're also spending every day together. They are used to having their separate careers and not being on top of each other every day.” The source said that while they “have disagreements and conflicts like all couples,” they are “not a big deal,” adding, “Katy, of course, has concerns about giving birth for the first time—especially since things are so uncertain right now. [But] they are very excited.”\n\nMay 2020: Perry gives a quarantine couple update.\n\nWhile on SiriusXM Hits 1’s The Morning Mash Up to promote her new single, “Daisies,” Perry spoke about staying at home with Bloom during the pandemic. “What I have actually learned, some of the positive…because he’s seen it all, and God bless him, he’s still here,” she said. “It’s amazing and commendable. I have definitely tested him, like…‘oh yeah, you think you can handle me?’”\n\nShe also touched on the activities they're doing while homebound. “We have a LEGO room in our house. It was a TV room,” she said. “He gets these Legos that are super hard to do… and he’ll make those in two days and then he displays them on the wall, like a championship Lego wall. I was like ‘oh, you’re a lot handier than I thought you were. Can you hang this thing for me, please?’”\n\nJune 2020: Perry recalls her struggles following a past breakup from Bloom.\n\nDuring an interview with radio show Q on CBC, Perry got candid about her mental health following a split from Bloom in 2017. Perry told Power, via Daily Mail and CNN, that “my career was on this trajectory when it was going up, up and up and then I had the smallest shift, not that huge from an outside perspective, but for me, it was seismic,” she said. “They say if a ship is one degree off from their navigation, they'll land on a different continent.” Perry added, “I had given so much out, and it literally broke me in half. I had broken up with my boyfriend, who is now my baby daddy-to-be. And then I was excited about flying high off the next record. But the validation did not make me high, and so I just crashed.”\n\nPerry said she even contemplated taking her own life during this period. “Gratitude is probably the thing that saved my life, because if I didn’t find that I would have wallowed in my own sadness and probably just jumped,” she said. “But I found the ways to be grateful. If it gets really, really hard I walk around and say, ‘I am grateful, I am grateful!’ even though I am in a shitty mood.”\n\nJuly 2020: Perry confirms she won't wed Bloom in 2020.\n\nPerry spoke about her relationship with Bloom during a wide-ranging interview with Howard Stern. “He's the only one that could handle it and that's why we're in this position,” she explained about her personality and dynamic with Bloom, via E!. “I showed him all of it. And I still test him and he still shows up and he still is not fazed by it and that's why he is perfect for me—because I'm a lot!”\n\nShe also confirmed that after the coronavirus pandemic cancelled wedding plans around the world, she and Bloom would not marry this year. “We cannot plan anymore in 2020, because those plans are always canceled,“ she admitted, dispelling rumors of two ceremonies. “I honestly, never heard of the other wedding, I only knew of one wedding. Of course, that will come in the future, but for now, we want to deliver a healthy child. And that's what's coming up.”\n\nAugust 2020: Perry speaks about she and Bloom's rocky journey to parenthood.\n\nFor the latest issue of People, Perry got candid about her relationship with Bloom, including past breakups and their excitement for a new baby. “It's really about an individual journey that makes the whole thing better. We both had to decide to go on that journey separately because it's not my half and your half that makes a whole,” Perry told the outlet. “It's my wholeness and your wholeness that makes this whole thing happen.”\n\nAccording to the outlet, the track “Champagne Problems,“ off Perry's upcoming Smile album addresses their challenges as a couple. “It's a song that really talks about how intense it's gotten and how many things we have had to go through. Yes, we have problems. Everybody has challenges in a relationship,” she explained. “If it's a real relationship, it's going to challenge you into your best self. I really understand what Justin Timberlake said about, ‘You're my mirror,’ because it's true. They bring up all this stuff you can't really see about yourself.”\n\nShe continued, “It's a never-ending evolution, so it's not peachy-keen jelly bean all the time, but it's nice to have been able to show each other all the good, bad and everything in between, and really fight for our best selves. Now, we just joke, like yeah, we still have things to work out—but champagne problems! We've gotten through a lot of hell.”\n\nAs for becoming a parent, Perry told People there are several qualities she hopes her daughter will inherit from Bloom. “Of course you admire someone that usually has traits you want more of. I want to be more spiritual and more centered, and that's him,” she explained. “He wants to be more organized and good with thinking about big picture stuff. Those are traits that we really aspire to learn about each other.”\n\nAs for their elusive wedding, Perry told the outlet, “I tried to do it this year and it poo poo-ed on me so ask me again in another year! I went through the whole freakin' process. Right now, we're just so focused on this [pregnancy], which is exciting. Let's hope [2021] is different than '20.”\n\nAugust 2020: Perry and Bloom welcome their first child together.\n\nOn August 27, UNICEF announced the birth of Daisy Dove Bloom on Instagram. Perry and Bloom are Goodwill Ambassadors for the charitable organization.\n\n“We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,” said the couple in a statement.\n\nMay 2020: Perry celebrates her first Mother’s Day with Bloom.\n\nBaby Daisy came just in time to be here with Perry for her first Mother’s Day.\n\n“i found everything i was ever searching for when i became a mother. so grateful for that profound, deep love and honored to join the mama club. happiest Mother’s Day ❤️🌼,” she tweeted.\n\nBloom shared a tribute to his fiancé on Instagram.\n\n“Got myself a real catch. 🐠 ❤️Sending love and respect to all the amazing people who have shaped our lives, supported us and loved us unconditionally. Happy Mother’s Day 🌼,” he wrote along with a photoshopped picture of him carrying Perry as a mermaid.\n\nOctober 2020: Bloom calls Daisy his “mini-me.”\n\nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, the actor spoke about which parent his newborn daughter resembles most. While Bloom admitted that Daisy shares traits from both parents, he confirmed that she did in fact get Perry's gorgeous eyes.\n\n“Fortunately she got those Katy blues, which was perfect,” said Bloom “But then she sort of looked like a bit like my mum so then I got a little bit confused because Katy's breast feeding this mini-me/my mum/who’s she going to look like next?”\n\nJanuary 2021: Bloom is emotional following Perry's performance at Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nPerry sang “Firework” in Washington, D.C. for President Biden's Celebrating America special. In honor of his fiancée, Bloom posted some rare behind the scenes footage on Instagram.
