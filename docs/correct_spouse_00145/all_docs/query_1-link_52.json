        "text": "Russell Brand and Katy Perry's marriage was doomed from the start after a telling confession from one of his friends.\n\nFellow comedian David Baddiel was with Russell on the day of the nuptials and has previously revealed how he told him he had a huge row with Katy the night before the wedding. David - who previously co-hosted Russell's BBC Radio 2 show with him as a guest presenter - opened up about the situation to Glamour on their Hey It’s Okay podcast, and admitted he often wondered if he should have intervened.\n\nDavid told the outlet in 2017: \"Can I say that I was at Katy Perry’s first wedding? I was there... Russell did tell me that they had a big row the night before they got married. I did think when he said that, of asking, 'Are you sure?' but I didn’t say that. Perhaps I should have done.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nThe former couple said \"I do\" at a breathtaking wedding ceremony with scenic views in India back in October 2010. Brand and Perry, who met at the VMAs in 2008, became an item in September 2009 and got engaged after three months of dating. Getting down on one knee, Russell proposed to his pop singer girlfriend near the Taj Mahal in India on New Year's Eve.\n\nAt their intimate and private wedding ceremony the loved-up pair, and their guests, wore traditional Indian clothes. Taking place near a wildlife sanctuary, the ex-couple's nuptials featured an array of animals from camels, to elephants, and horses. The actor and singer also had famous guests at the wedding – including P Diddy, David Walliams, and Jonathan Ross.\n\nHowever, only 14 months into their marriage, Russell broke up with Katy over a text message. It was alleged Russell, who was aged 36 at the time, was struggling with Katy’s superstar fame. Their divorce was finalised in 2012.\n\nOpening up about the breakdown of their marriage in 2013, Katy told Vogue: \"He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him. Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\" Meanwhile, Russell blamed her pop career for the split, saying \"I'm associated with the very thing I detest: vapid vacuous, plastic, constructed, mindless celebrity.\"\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook\n\nAll the latest news, showbiz, lifestyle and sports updates, brought to you by our dedicated American team.\n\nFollow the Mirror US News page on Facebook to make sure you're not missing out."
