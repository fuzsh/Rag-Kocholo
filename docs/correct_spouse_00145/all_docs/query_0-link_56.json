        "text": "Katy Perry has been particularly scathing when reflecting on her 14-month marriage to comedian Russell Brand.\n\nIn a candid conversation with Vogue's Vicki Woods for the July edition, Perry, 28, revealed she's had no contact with Brand since he informed her of his intention to divorce via text on December 31, 2011.\n\nPerry recounted her experiences with Brand to Vogue, expressing her initial love and admiration for him.\n\nHowever, she hinted at challenges in their relationship due to her success, suggesting that Brand struggled with her position of authority during her tours.\n\nPerry also touched on an incident where Brand made jokes about her without realizing she was in the audience.\n\nHe’s a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him...let’s just say I haven’t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me on December 31, 2011,\" Perry stated in the interview.\n\n\"At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, 'I can’t handle the equalness.' He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour,\" the singer continued.\n\nPost-divorce, Perry has been intermittently linked with musician John Mayer but denies any intent of retaliation against Brand.\n\nIn 2016 Perry began dating Pirates of The Caribbean actor Orlando Bloom with the pair engaged. The couple welcomed their daughter, Daisy Dove, into the world in 2020.\n\nDuring a 2020 interview with 60 Minutes Australia, the 36-year-old Teenage Dream singer described their relationship as “a tornado,” drawing a contrast with her current relationship, which she termed “healthy frictional.”\n\nAs the years passed, both parties shared their views on the end of the short-lived marriage, with Perry citing the challenges of both being in the limelight and Brand attributing it to being at distinct life stages."
