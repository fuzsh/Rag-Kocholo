        "text": "WireImage.com\n\nIt's official! Russell Brand and Katy Perry tied the knot Saturday night in India.\n\nBrand, 35, and Perry, 25, \"were pronounced Mr. and Mrs. Brand on Saturday, October 23,\" the couple said in a statement. \"The very private and spiritual ceremony, attended by the couples' closest family and friends was performed by a Christian minister and longtime friend of the Hudson Family. The backdrop was the inspirational and majestic countryside of Northern India.\"\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at a luxury resort. Earlier in the day, two elephants named Laxmi and Mala were seen arriving at the resort. As the animals walked into the venue, a red carpet was rolled out for them. \"Mala is a bit skittish and hates crowds but she managed to behave herself,\" a source told WHO.\n\nIn a traditional Indian wedding procession, known as the \"bharat,\" the bridegroom and his male relatives and friends walk to the spot where the bride awaits. The bridegroom is often on a white horse, but an elephant is considered an even grander, more magnificent mode of transportation – the maharajas, or Indian royals, traditionally arrived at weddings on elephants.\n\nThe sound of Indian instruments – including the sitar, the santoor, the tabla and kettle drums – and the singing of traditional Rajasthani folk musicians could be heard from deep inside the Aman-i-Khas resort, along with some sacred Vedic chanting and the occasional burst of applause and cheering by the guests.\n\nAt the entrance, the trees lining the path into the venue were lit up with white and gold lights.\n\nThe elephants at Katy Perry and Russell Brand's wedding in India, WireImage.com"
