        "text": "A teenage dream! Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom’s high-profile relationship, which started in January 2016, has included a dance-off, a nude paddleboarding session, a meeting with the pope and just about everything in between. The singer and the actor dated from January 2016 to March 2017 before briefly calling it quits. They were officially back together by February 2018, and one year later, he proposed on Valentine’s Day. While the duo had big plans for their nuptials, they were forced to postpone first in late 2019 because of a problem with the location and then again in early 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Amid their ever-changing wedding plans, Perry announced in March 2020 that she was expecting their first child — a baby girl. “Well, it wasn’t an accident,” she told SiriusXM’s Mikey Piff at the time. “I’m so grateful for everything that I have been able to do and achieve, all the goals I’ve been able to check off my list, the life I’ve lived thus far. I’ve just been trying to create this space in my own life where I’m not running myself too ragged and creating space for something new to happen like this.” [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"FJvorzpdUW-2838738-14453\"] Perry added that she and Bloom were “both looking forward to this new interval of life and sharing this.” Their daughter, Daisy Dove, arrived in August 2020. The California native revealed the secret to her relationship with the Brit in September 2019, while also showering her beau with compliments. “He is the kindest soul. He is the kindest man I’ve ever met,” she gushed during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. “He shows up and he’s such an encouragement spiritually, emotionally and physically. I do not care to work out and he’s like, ‘Let’s go work out! Let’s go do hot yoga!’ That’s kind of our love language is all things spiritual and working out.” Bloom, for his part, raved to The Sunday Times in March 2020 that Perry is “very surprising.” He elaborated: “She’s witty and smart and intelligent. She’s charismatic, but she’s direct too, and this dynamic was intriguing to me.” Scroll through for a timeline of the couple’s love story so far:\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nJune 2020\n\nThe “Small Talk” singer reflected on her 2017 breakup from Bloom. “My career was on this trajectory when it was going up, up and up and then I had the smallest shift, not that huge from an outside perspective. But for me it was seismic,” she said on the Canadian radio show Q on CBC. “I had broken up with my boyfriend, who is now my baby-daddy-to-be, and then I was excited about flying high off the next record and the record didn’t get me high anymore. … The validation didn’t get me high, and so I just crashed.”\n\nCredit: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nThe pair couldn't keep their eyes off one another while attending Variety's Power of Women event.\n\nDuring the event, the American Idol judge called up her beau to help her “undo my corset” ahead of her musical performance. Bloom, for his part, hustled onto the stage to loosen her shapewear as Perry noted, “Pull it all the way down. I have [a] girdle in here. All the way down!”\n\nAfter the Lord of the Rings actor unzipped her ball gown, he gave her a quick kiss on her shoulder and returned to his seat.\n\nCredit: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMay 2022\n\nPerry gushed about the way her fiancé helps her find balance during an appearance on the \"Dear Chelsea\" podcast. \"I always say when he walks into the room he has this joie de vivre to him and some people ask, 'What is this guy on?'\" she explained. \"He's just really got this happy, posi[tive] vibes and I'm a little bit more heady and prone to depression in some ways — and so it's good for me to be around him because he gets me out of my head a little bit.\"\n\nThe singer added that it was Bloom's kindness that drew her to him — and made her feel confident about starting a family with him. \"I got to see what a great dad he was with his first child, Flynn, who is now 11. So that definitely, primally influenced me [to want kids] — something inside of me said, 'You, mid-30s. This man is nice. Must breed,'\" she joked. \"He is a kind man.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Orlando Bloom/Instagram\n\nOctober 2022\n\n\"Right now, Katy especially feels like she has her hands full. Wedding planning isn't her focus right now. It hasn't been No. 1 on their list,” a source exclusively told Us of the couple’s wedding plans. “Orlando and Katy both see it as a ceremony and aren't in a rush to get married. They have a much deeper and connected relationship than they did before.”\n\nThe twosome feel “more like a team” since welcoming Daisy. “They have different priorities than before,” the insider explained. “Having this big wedding isn't as important — they see themselves as practically already being married.\"\n\nWhen it comes to expanding their family, the source told Us that Perry and Bloom haven’t ruled out a second child.\n\n\"They're not taking any steps to prevent kids, but they're not actively trying for another one,” the insider said, noting that the musician “doesn't want to walk down [the] aisle pregnant,” per the source. “They're not against having another baby, though. They're just simply focused on Daisy.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Orlando Bloom/Instagram\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nDespite their goofiness together, Bloom got candid about his and Perry’s relationship struggles in an interview with Flaunt Magazine.\n\nStating that they are in “two very different pools” in terms of their career success, the Carnival Row star explained, “Her pool is not a pool that I necessarily understand, and I think my pool is not a pool that she necessarily understands.”\n\nHe continued, “Sometimes things are really, really, really, challenging. I won’t lie. We definitely battle with our emotions and creativity, [but] I think we’re both aware of how blessed we are to have uniquely connected in the way that we did at the time that we did, and there’s definitely never a dull moment.”\n\nCredit: Rob Latour/Shutterstock\n\nApril 2023\n\nPerry offered fans rare insight into how she and Bloom keep their romance running smoothly after so many years together. \"Orlando and I’s initials are O.K.,\" the \"Wide Awake\" songstress, 38, wrote via Instagram alongside a photo of herself and her fiancé. \"We continuously put in the work to make sure they aren’t 🚨K.O.🚨. Find yourself a partner that will go down to the mat with you and get back up every time. I love you my fighter @orlandobloom 🥊♥️.\"\n\nBloom replied in the comments section, writing: \"I love you and our love ❤️ bombs💥wouldn’t have it any other way 😍.\"\n\nFor the couple's location, Perry tagged \"The Hoffman Process,\" which is a week-long therapy retreat designed to help participants identify and overcome negative behaviors and thought patterns. Both she and Bloom have completed the treatment, and Perry has credited it with \"profoundly\" changing her life."
