        "text": "Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry are navigating letting go!\n\nThe Orlando Bloom: To the Edge star appears on the latest episode of the On Purpose with Jay Shetty podcast and reveals the most challenging aspects of his years-long relationship with the American Idol judge.\n\n\"I think I'm constantly learning to let go. 'Cause anything that I try to hold onto, whether it's good or bad, doesn't serve me,\" Bloom shares of the lesson he's learned in his relationship. \"Not in the relationship, and it doesn't really serve either of us. And that's really hard. To keep letting go and to keep letting her go. You know, the idea of, 'cause I think when you are in a deeply loving, committed relationship, you want to control or own or have and, you know, even just letting go of ideas, how things should be, or the idea of what intimacy or intimate moments are to you versus them, or whatever it may be.\"\n\nHe continues, \"Because you've chosen that person, you are on a journey with that person. You are gonna learn this lesson. And if you've chosen that person, then that's the person you're gonna learn that lesson with. You know, I mean, that's the opportunity, right?\"\n\nBloom and Perry, both 39, got engaged in 2019 and welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove, in 2020. Bloom also shares Flynn, 13, with ex-wife Miranda Kerr.\n\nFor the Carnival Row star, the lesson of letting go has also helped him and his partner grown their love for each other.\n\n\"I seize the opportunity every day to grow and as you see from the show, I'll never choose the easy path. You know, like, it's just not who I am,\" he tells Shetty. \"In some ways, my relationship is the greatest opportunity for my continual growth. I know we both see it that way. So that's how we grow. And we do. She'll hold me accountable and I'll do the same. And sometimes, you know, you'll be confronted by your own self. And I think, you know, trust, right. Trusting your path, your journey, your faith, that this is what's meant for you.\"\n\nLast week, Bloom spoke with ET, where he offered a glimpse at how much support he's received from his fiancée, amid the dangerous activities he's taken on in his unscripted series.\n\n\"It's so encouraging… we're both, I think, you know, cheerleaders for each other,\" Bloom said of the \"Firework\" singer. \"She definitely pushes me to be the best version of myself and we both hold each other accountable as best we can.\"\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean star also credits their unwavering support for each other as a key to their long relationship.\n\n\"That's part of what, you know, works for us as a couple, trying to evolve,\" he shared. \"Her support was, you know, obviously immensely important and always is.\""
