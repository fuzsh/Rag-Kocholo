        "text": "Katy Perry met Russell Brand in 2009 while filming \"Get Him to the Greek.\"\n\nPerry first met Brand back in 2009 when he was filming the comedy, \"Get Him to the Greek.\"\n\nIn the movie, the comedian reprises his role as Aldous Snow, the chaotic rock star character from \"Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\" He starred opposite Jonah Hill, who plays a record label employee tasked with escorting him to Los Angeles.\n\nThe film features a number of cameos from other actors and musicians, including Perry, who had a scene with Brand that was ultimately cut.\n\nThe scene saw Perry making out with Brand's character, and back in 2010 she told Glamour magazine (via MTV) that she was excited to shoot the cameo.\n\nShe said: \"When he was filming 'Get Him to the Greek,' I did a cameo with him. My scene called for me to make out with him. And on the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny. I hop like a bunny when I'm happy. I get a bit childlike. He gives me the Christmas Eve jitters.\"\n\nBrand and Perry later started dating in September 2009 after meeting again at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nKaty Perry said that Russell Brand broke up with her over text in December 2011.\n\n14 months after their wedding, Brand decided to call off their marriage and filed for divorce on December 30, 2011, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\n\"Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends,\" he said in a statement at the time, per People.\n\nPerry later said that Brand broke up with her in a text message.\n\nThe moments after the singer received the message were caught on camera for her 2012 movie, \"Part of Me,\" just as she was about to perform on stage during her tour.\n\nPerry has never revealed what the text said, but she told Vogue in 2013: \"He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him. Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\"\n\nBrand discussed his reasons for breaking up with Perry when he appeared on \"The Howard Stern Show\" in July 2012 (via MTV), explaining that he wanted to settle down and start a family, but Perry's career got in the way.\n\n\"She's young, successful, and dedicated,\" he said. \"You can't fully understand it until you do it. I was really into the idea of marriage and having children.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything to hurt her. She's younger than me, she's a young woman and she's beautiful and she's sensitive and I care about her deeply ... I don't want to be too glib. She'll read it and she'll be sad and I don't want that,\" Brand added.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in July 2012, per E! News.\n\nIn 2013, Katy Perry said she knew \"the real truth\" about Russell Brand but couldn't speak about it.\n\nA year after their divorce was finalized, Perry opened up about the split in an interview with Vogue and said that Brand called off their relationship because he didn't like her being in charge at times.\n\n\"At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they're like, 'I can't handle the equalness,'\" she said. \"He didn't like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting.\"\n\nHowever, Perry went on to add that she had learned something about Brand that she couldn't talk about in the interview.\n\n\"I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can't necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day,\" Perry said. \"I let go and I was like, 'This isn't because of me; this is beyond me.' So I have moved on from that.\""
