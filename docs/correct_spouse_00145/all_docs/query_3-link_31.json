        "text": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom are \"more in love now than they've ever been\", with a source suggesting they could finally be ready to set a date for their wedding.\n\nOrlando proposed to Katy on Valentine's day back in 2019, but the loved-up couple are yet to make it down the aisle. They were originally set to tie the knot in 2020, but their plans were derailed when they couldn't secure their dream location. They then had to change their wedding plans again during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, Katy and Orlando are now hoping that 2024 will be \"the year they make it happen\". A source explained: \"They're happier then ever and everyone is predicting they'll get married soon - possibly even on Valentine's Day, which is the anniversary of their engagement.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift predicted her relationship with Travis Kelce in resurfaced 2009 interview\n\nThe source explained how both Katy and Orlando originally wanted to get married in Japan, but said the distance made it too difficult to arrange. \"Doing something closer to home in California makes a lot more sense. Their place in Montecito has nine acres so there's plenty of room to do it there. Plus, it's close to LA so all of their showbiz friends could easily attend,\" the source told Heat magazine.\n\nThe couple are believed to have been enjoying a number of romantic dates recently and have been made stronger following the birth of their daughter Daisy Dove Bloom in 2020. Daisy \"totally united\" Katy and Orlando, according to the source, and they're \"more in love now than they've ever been\".\n\nAs well as finalising any wedding plans, Katy and Orlando are rumoured to be hoping to expand their family in 2024. The source suggested Katy \"very much wants to have baby number two\" and said this year makes the most sense.\n\nThe singer finished her Las Vegas residency in November 2023, meaning she has more time to spend with her family. At three years old, the source also said Daisy is now \"old enough to understand the whole thing\" and is ready to be a big sister. The Mirror has approached representatives for Katy and Orlando for comment."
