        "text": "Brand recently made headlines after The Sunday Times, The Times of London, and Channel 4 Dispatches reported in a joint investigation that four women had accused the comedian of rape and sexual assault occurring between 2006 and 2013. (Brand released a video statement on Friday, before the report was published, denying all allegations of wrongdoing.)\n\nLaura's Instagram account @thejoyjournal, which Brand has referenced in the caption of a 2020 YouTube video and a March Instagram post, is currently unavailable. Insider was unable to verify when the account was deleted, and outlets including The Sun and The Mirror have reported different timelines for its removal either prior to, or following, the investigation. Laura otherwise has not commented publicly on the allegations against her husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Brand's wife Laura and their family.\n\nRussell Brand's current wife is Laura Brand\n\nLaura Brand (n√©e Gallacher) is the daughter of golfer Bernard Gallacher, per The Independent, and grew up in Surrey, England. According to People, she lived on the Wentworth Estate, an exclusive private estate. Her sister, Kirsty Gallacher, is a radio presenter who previously worked for Sky Sports.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAccording to People, it was Kirsty who first introduced the two in 2007. Brand told Stylist in 2016 that they first met when he was 30 and Laura was 19. In a 2020 interview with You Magazine, which appears to no longer available but was preserved by the Internet Archive, Laura said that she \"really fell in love\" when they first met.\n\nPer You Magazine, Laura studied art before working in the hospitality industry. Eventually, according to People, she launched a lifestyle blog after leaving hospitality. And then, as she told Grazia in 2020, they reconnected after Laura's friend dragged her out on a walk after her ex moved out of her apartment. On the path, they coincidentally ran into Brand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple were married in 2017, though they briefly dated in the late 2000s prior to Brand's marriage to Katy Perry. According to People, they reunited romantically in 2015.\n\nLaura said in a 2020 episode of the podcast \"Made by Mammas\" that when she and Brand reconnected after his marriage to Perry ended, they \"immediately knew it was going to be serious.\" Then, she said, they slowly got to know each other again and worked to \"rebuild your foundations and trust.\"\n\nLaura has also published several books, including \"The Joy Journal for Magical Everyday Play\" and \"The Joy Journal for Grown-ups.\"\n\nThe couple's first child, Mabel, was born in 2016\n\nLaura gave birth to the couple's daughter Mabel in 2016, E! News reported in November of that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe publication reported that Brand announced the birth of his child during a stand-up show, with an audience member telling E! News that he left the show quickly because Laura had given birth. He previously announced his impending fatherhood in an Instagram post in July of that year, sharing a photo of him peeking over the cover of a book titled \"The Expectant Dad's Handbook.\"\n\nThe couple do not frequently share their children on social media, but Brand said on \"Today\" that he loved being a father.\n\n\"She's so beautiful and so glorious and so full of joy and love,\" he told host Megyn Kelly of Mabel. However, he jokingly added that his daughter was a \"vicious, vindictive, villainous little character\" who relentlessly tugged at his chest hairs.\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child, Peggy, in 2018\n\nThe couple had their second daughter, named Peggy, in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times when Peggy was six months old, Brand said that his wife Laura handles much of the domestic work of caring for their children and \"wouldn't go away for 24 hours\" because she \"respects and cares for their safety too much.\"\n\n\"It turns out that she is extremely well versed in the nuances and complexities of child-rearing,\" Brand said of his wife. \"Me, I am dedicated to it, devoted to it, but I am still surprised when it's like, 'Oh my God, this is f****** really hard and it's so exhausting.' The younger one, I just feel inept so quickly, like with the crying.\"\n\nBrand and Laura announced that they were expecting their third child in June\n\nAccording to People, \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast host Steven Bartlett revealed during an interview with Brand in June that the couple were expecting another child.\n\n\"You fell in love and you've got two children. You've got a third on the way, around the corner. That's a very special love you have found,\" Bartlett said, per People."
