        "text": "Why did Katy Perry & Russell Brand divorce?\n\nWhy did Katy Perry & Russell Brand divorce? Katy Perry and Russell Brand divorced due to various circumstances. “Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I’ll always adore her and I know we’ll remain friends,” he said in a statement at the time, per People. In a Howard Stern Interview, he talked about the end of the marriage. “She’s young, successful, and dedicated,” he said. “You can’t fully understand it until you do it. I was really into the idea of marriage and having children.”\n\n“I don’t want anything to hurt her. She’s younger than me, she’s a young woman and she’s beautiful and she’s sensitive and I care about her deeply … I don’t want to be too glib. She’ll read it and she’ll be sad and I don’t want that,” Brand added.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue in 2013, Perry revealed the grounds of the marriage. “At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, ‘I can’t handle the equalness.’ He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour. So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting,” Perry said at the time.\n\n“I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day. I let go and I was like, ‘This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me.’ So I have moved on from that.”\n\nWhat was Russell Brand's response to the rape allegations?\n\nWhat is Russell Brand’s response to his rape allegations? A day before the reveal, he posted a three-minute-long Instagram video defending himself.\n\n“I’ve received two extremely disturbing letters, or a letter and an email, one from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks,” he began the video. “But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks, are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute.”\n\nHe continued, “These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream, when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies,” he shared. “And as I’ve written about extensively in my books, I was very, very promiscuous. Now during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely, always consensual. I was always transparent about that then—almost too transparent. And I’m being transparent about it now as well. And to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal, that I absolutely deny.”\n\nWhile he did not name the Times or Channel 4 explicitly, he called out media groups for using his experiences to “attack” him. “I don’t mind them using my books and my stand-up to talk about my promiscuous, consensual conduct in the past. What I seriously refute are these very, very, serious criminal allegations,” he went on to add. “Also, it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently, in what seems to me to be, a coordinated attack.”\n\nThough he didn’t address what happened due to the “serious nature,” he did make his stance clear. “I feel like I’m being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together,” he shared."
