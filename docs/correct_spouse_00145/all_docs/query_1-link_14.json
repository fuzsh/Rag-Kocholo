        "text": "Hello there, you awakening wonders.\n\nNow this isn't the usual type of video we make on this channel where we critique, attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story I am the news.\n\nI have received two extremely disturbing letters - well a letter and an email.\n\nOne from a mainstream media TV company, one from a newspaper, listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuff - like my community festival should be stopped, that I shouldn't be able to attack mainstream media narratives on this channel.\n\nBut amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque, attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute. These allegations pertain to the time when I was working in the mainstream - when I was in the newspapers all the time, when I was in the movies, and as I have written about extensively in my books I was very very promiscuous\n\nNow during that time of promiscuity, the relationships I had were absolutely always consensual. I was always transparent about that then, almost too transparent. And I'm being transparent about it now as well.\n\nAnd to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that I absolutely deny makes me question is there another agenda at play?\n\nParticularly when we have seen coordinated media attacks before - like with Joe Rogan when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstream media didn't approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language.\n\nI’m aware that you guys have been saying in the comments for a while ‘Watch out Russell, they are coming for you, you are getting too close to the truth, Russell Brand did not kill himself’.\n\nI know that a year ago there was a spate of articles ‘Russell Brand is a conspiracy theorist, Russell Brand’s right wing’.\n\nI’m aware of news media making phone calls, sending letters to people I know for ages and ages.\n\nIt’s been clear to me or at least it feels to me like there's a serious and concerted agenda to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and I mean my voice along with your voice.\n\nI don't mind them using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past. What I seriously refute are these very very serious criminal allegations.\n\nAlso it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems to me to be a coordinated attack\n\nNow I don't want to get into this any further because of the serious nature of the allegations, but I feel like I'm being attacked and plainly they are working very closely together\n\nWe are obviously going to look into this matter because it’s very, very serious. In the meantime I want you to stay close, stay awake but more important than any of that if you can, please, stay free."
