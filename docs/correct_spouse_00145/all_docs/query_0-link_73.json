        "text": "David Baddiel has given GLAMOUR some inside info on Katy Perry and Russell Brand’s wedding six years ago. The writer, comedian and close friend of Russell joined us for our Hey It’s OK podcast and spoke about the event he attended in October 2010.\n\n“Can I say that I was at Katy Perry’s first wedding?” said David. “I was there...Russell did tell me that they had a big row the night before they got married. I did think when he said that, of asking, ‘Are you sure?’ but I didn’t say that. Perhaps I should have done.”\n\nHe also revealed that the bride and groom paid for all of their friends to come out to India for the occasion, and they had a huge vegan wedding cake.\n\nRussell, 41, and Katy, 32, separated in December 2011 after 14 months of marriage. He allegedly asked for a divorce over text message and released a public statement saying, \"Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends.\"\n\nKaty broke her silence on Twitter the following month, thanking her fans for their support. \"I am so grateful for all the love and support I've had from people around the world. You guys have made my heart happy again.\" She added, \"Concerning the gossip, I want to be clear that NO ONE speaks for me. Not a blog, magazine, 'close sources' or my family.\"\n\nThe reference to \"my family\" was interpreted as a dig at Katy's evangelical pastor parents, who claimed that their daughter's divorce was \"a gift from God\", during a packed-out service in Ohio.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter later in 2012, Katy said she would never speak about what caused the breakdown of their marriage: \"Nobody knows what really happened except the two people who are in it.\"\n\nThe popstar also revealed how the relationship had affected her career: \"There were times when what was going on in my personal life was so overwhelming that I had to bend over to let those tears fall straight out of my eyes, and not my false lashes just as I'm about to go up on that ramp and sing 'Teenage Dream'.\"\n\nThe couple's divorce was granted by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Marc Marmaro and became official on July 14 2012. A friend of Russell's told TMZ, \"This divorce is as amicable as it gets, and Russell was a [good person].\" Proving that there was no bad blood on Katy's side, she signed her divorce papers with a heart and smiley face.\n\nRussell has since become a father to one-year-old daughter Mabel, with his 27-year-old girlfriend Laura Gallacher. Katy has had high profile relationships with John Mayer and Orlando Bloom, but is currently single.\n\nCatch up on our previous Hey It's OK podcasts here.\n\nShocking A-List Splits\n\nGallery48 Photos\n\nView Gallery"
