        "text": "Katy Perry has never been one to shy away from speaking her mind especially when it comes to mental health.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue published Thursday, the \"Swish Swish\" artist spoke out about battling depression and how her fiance Orlando Bloom has helped her through the process.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, around the same time her fifth album \"Witness\" was released, Perry said she was depressed in a way that she never was before.\n\n\"I became depressed and I did not want to get out of bed. In the past, I had been able to overcome it, but this time something happened that made me fall down too many flights of stairs,\" she said. \"I had to really go on a mental health journey.\"\n\nPerry attributes her transformation to doing the work and having a partner who holds her accountable.\n\n\"I’ve gone to therapy, been through the Hoffman Process, done plant medicine,\" she said, referring to the week-long retreat that claims to help people \"identify negative behaviors, moods, and ways of thinking.\"\n\n\"And I have a partner who is also all about finding a balance – Orlando, who is on a spiritual journey of his own,\" Perry said. \"He’s an anchor who holds me down, and he’s very real. He’s not the number one fan of Katy Perry, but he’s the number one fan of Katheryn Hudson.\"\n\nMore: Katy Perry dishes on Orlando Bloom's helicopter proposal\n\nMore: Orlando Bloom reveals why he turned down 'Saturday Night Live' hosting gig\n\nThe 35-year-old artist noted that when the pair first met they helped each other through the healing journey, and she attributes it to how much in common they have – they're both in the spotlight and have both dealt with divorce.\n\n\"When we first met, (Orlando) said we would pull the poison out of each other, and we really do. It’s exhausting, but we really hold each other accountable. I’ve never had a partner who was willing to go on an emotional and spiritual journey like Orlando,\" Perry said. \"It’s challenging, because you’re facing all the things you don’t like about yourself. It’s like a never-ending cleanse.\"\n\nEven though Perry's work schedule may get hectic, she still finds time for her family, which now includes Bloom's 8-year-old son.\n\n\"We do a lot with Flynn. We go to the movies or to amusement parks&mldr; We’re constantly doing things that are fun,\" Perry said.\n\nDespite the artist being scrutinized in the public eye for cultural appropriation and shading Britney Spears, Perry is still willing to push through.\n\n\"I’ve been in the public eye for 12 years and I’ve made many mistakes. I’m human, and I still want to try,\" she said. \"I don’t want to be defeated or become a recluse. I want to live life. And doing that means you might occasionally trip, but it’s not about how you fall – it’s about how you get up.\""
