        "text": "Russell Brand’s ex-wife, pop singer Katy Perry, seemingly hinted at his dark reputation years before sexual abuse allegations against him came to light.\n\nFive women have come forward to allege that the actor and comedian raped, sexually assaulted or abused them, claims the 48-year-old has denied.\n\nTheir allegations are featured in a special by Channel 4, The Times and The Sunday Times entitled Russell Brand: In Plain Sight.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nNow, a 2013 Vogue interview with Brand’s ex-wife has resurfaced in which Perry described Brand as “controlling” and the relationship as “hurtful”.\n\nPerry said she was in love with Brand when they married in 2010 - but 14 months later, it was all over.\n\nShe told Vogue she blamed herself for their split until she “found out the real truth” about Brand.\n\n“At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, ‘I can’t handle the equalness’,” she said.\n\n“He didn’t like the atmosphere of me being the boss on tour.\n\n“So that was really hurtful, and it was very controlling, which was upsetting.\n\n“I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.\n\n“I let go and I was like, ‘This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me.’\n\n“So I have moved on from that.”\n\nThe singer has not yet disclosed what she meant by “the real truth” and has made no public statement on the current allegations against Brand.\n\nPerry has since remarried, to Pirates of the Caribbean actor Orlando Bloom.\n\nThe allegations against Brand were first published by the Sunday Times in the UK on September 16.\n\nOne of the unnamed accusers alleged that Brand raped her “against a wall” in his home in Los Angeles in 2012.\n\nAnother alleged victim said she was in an “emotionally abusive and controlling” relationship with Brand when she was 16 and he was 31.\n\nShe claimed that he referred to her as “child” throughout their relationship.\n\nAlthough 16 is the age of consent in the United Kingdom, the woman said Brand had groomed and raped her.\n\n“Russell engaged in the behaviours of a groomer, looking back, but I didn’t even know what that was then, or what that looked like,” the woman, who is not being identified, told The Times.\n\nBrand denied the allegations in a video shared to his social media, and said his relationships have all been consensual.\n\nHe said he received “extremely disturbing” communications from a mainstream TV company and a newspaper “listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks”.\n\n“But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,” Brand said.\n\nThe comedian went on to say that the allegations stem from a time during the height of his mainstream fame when he was transparently “very, very promiscuous,” adding that all the relationships he had at the time “were absolutely always consensual”.\n\nBrand accused The Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 of working closely together to construct “a coordinated attack” against him.\n\n- with NBC News\n\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au.\n\nFor more engaging celebrity and lifestyle content, visit 7Life on Facebook.\n\nYour cookie settings are preventing this third party content from displaying.\n\nIf you’d like to view this content, please adjust your .\n\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Guide."
