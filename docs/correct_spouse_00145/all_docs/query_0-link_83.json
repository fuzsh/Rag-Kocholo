        "text": "TMZ reports that Russell Brand filed for divorce Friday, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" The actor and comedian married Katy Perry in October 2010.\n\n\"Sadly, Katy and I are ending our marriage. I'll always adore her and I know we'll remain friends,\" Brand said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDivorce rumors had been circulating about the star couple since late November. At the time, Brand denied that the pair had plans to split.\n\n\"I'm married to Katy perpetually. 'Until death do us part' was the pledge. I'm still alive!\" Brand told Ellen Degeneres.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecent photos of Brand and Perry sans wedding rings further fueled rumors that the couple had split."
