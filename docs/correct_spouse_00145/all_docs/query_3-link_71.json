        "text": "Orlando Bloom took to Instagram to share an adorable family photo.\n\nPictured walking with his family, enjoying what appears to be a nice stroll in a park, Bloom is seen holding hands with his fianc√©e, Katy Perry, and 10-year-old son, Flynn Bloom, whom he shares with ex-spouse, supermodel Miranda Kerr. \"Family,\" he captioned the post in all caps, adding a vertically spelled-out \"love ‚ù§Ô∏è.\"\n\nBloom and Perry appear to have become very family oriented in the last year. Back in August, Bloom and Perry welcomed their now 10-month-old daughter, Daisy Bloom, which marked Perry's newfound role as a mother. \"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,\" they previously wrote in an Instagram post by UNICEF.\n\nIn commemoration of Father's Day, Perry shared another post on Instagram, in which Bloom is seen playing soothing music in the delivery room where their daughter was delivered. She wrote in the caption, \"Happy first Father‚Äôs Day to to the healer of my heart and the giver of my greatest gift üåºüïä... I love you WHOLE world ‚ô•Ô∏è.\"\n\nOn Mother's Day, Perry took to Twitter to share her sentiments on being a first-time mom. \"I found everything I was ever searching for when I became a mother,\" she wrote. \"So grateful for that profound, deep love and honored to join the mama club.\"\n\nKerr is reportedly happy about the couple's parenting of her and Bloom's son. \"I just feel so happy that Orlando found someone that makes him happy, because at the end of the day, for Flynn to have a happy father and a happy mother is the most important thing,\" Kerr reportedly shared with WSJ. Magazine. \"Flynn has always been the priority for me and making sure that he felt safe and he felt, you know, comfortable,\" she added. \"Just putting his needs first, like, 'Is this in the best interest of Flynn,' no matter what we did.\"\n\nThe model also shared that she harbors no hard feelings toward her ex-spouse, emphasizing that her child's happiness is her main priority. \"Even when we were separating, I thought, 'Is this in the best interest of Flynn?' And I was like, 'Yes, it really is,'\" Kerr said. \"If you put everything in that perspective it takes it away from anything too personal between you and your ex. It really makes it about the child.\""
