        "text": "Actor and comedian Russell Brand hit the headlines last week as a series of shocking accusations emerged.\n\nSeveral women have accused Brand, 48, of rape, sexual assault, and controlling behaviour over a seven-year period at the height of his fame, when he was fronting chatshows, hosting on BBC radio, and starring in Hollywood blockbusters.\n\nA Dispatches special shared harrowing details of the alleged incidents, following a lengthy investigation from Channel 4, The Sunday Times, and The Times.\n\nAllegations include those from a woman who was just 16 at the time she met Brand, claiming he ‘shoved his penis’ down her throat.\n\nBrand himself has profusely denied the ‘very serious’ allegations, telling his online followers in a video that he is questioning whether ‘there is another agenda at play’ and saying the sexual encounters with the alleged victims were ‘consensual.’\n\nThe Metropolitan police has confirmed that since the documantary aired it has received a number of non-recent sexual assault claims relating to Brand and has now launched an investigation into the singer.\n\nThe Get Him to the Greek actor rose to fame in the early 2000s, starting out as a stand-up comic before securing presenting gigs on MTV and Channel 4, such as Big Brother spin-off, Big Brother’s Big Mouth.\n\nBrand has also hosted his own radio shows, released books, and voiced characters in films such as Despicable Me and Trolls.\n\nIn recent years, he’s taken a step back from the spotlight, instead spending his time podcasting and campaigning, often dividing people with his political views.\n\nDespite being catapulted to fame with his success in TV, however, there’s one high-profile relationship the disgraced star is instantly recognised by.\n\nWhen was Russell Brand married to Katy Perry?\n\nBrand was married to US pop star Katy Perry for 14 months.\n\nThe Teenage Dream hitmaker, 38, started dating Brand after splitting from Travie McCoy in December 2009. They first crossed paths in the summer of that year while Perry filmed a cameo for Get Him to the Greek.\n\nPerry and Brand got together after meeting again that September at the VMAs, with things moving very quickly indeed as Brand proposed on New Year’s Eve just months later while holidaying in India.\n\nShe married Brand on October 23, 2010, in a traditional Hindu ceremony near the Ranthambhore tiger sanctuary in Rajasthan.\n\nHowever, on December 30, 2011, Brand announced that he and Perry were divorcing.\n\nPerry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led to the end of their split.\n\nAs shown in Perry’s own concert documentary, Brand told her he wanted a divorce via text message just moments before she was due to go on stage.\n\nShe said he never spoke to her again after that message was sent.\n\nMeanwhile, Brand claimed that he divorced her due to the Roar singer’s commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism.\n\nPerry also spoke about struggling with suicidal thoughts when their marriage ended so abruptly.\n\nDid the pair have any children?\n\nPerry gave birth to a daughter named Daisy Dove in August 2020, born to her and husband Orlando Bloom, whom she married in 2019.\n\nBrand is also a father, having been married to Laura Gallacher for six years and sharing Mabel (born in 2016) and Peggy (born in 2018). Gallacher is currently pregnant with their third baby.\n\nHowever, Perry did not have children with Brand.\n\nAhead of their split, a source told The Mirror at the time that Perry and Brand had realised they had ‘nothing in common’.\n\n‘Russell left his party lifestyle behind a long time ago because it nearly killed him. All he wanted to do is stay at home, do his yoga, keep his demons away and have a family with Katy,’ the source said.\n\n‘But when Katy had rare time off from her touring all she wanted to do was go out partying in Hollywood.\n\n‘After the high of the wedding, reality kicked in. Katy was away all the time and she became more and more successful. She is doing so well and Russell couldn’t handle it.’\n\nAs Perry grew more and more famous, she and Brand clashed over his desire to settle down and have kids.\n\n‘[Russell] really wanted me to have children, and I knew I wasn’t ready – I think it was a way of control,’ Perry previously told Marie Claire.\n\n‘I think it was part of, if I have a kid, then I would have to sacrifice – I’d have to be home more.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Russell Brand hits out at ‘war against free speech’ in live show return amid sexual assault allegations"
