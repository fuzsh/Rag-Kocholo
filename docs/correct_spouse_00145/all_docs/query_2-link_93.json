        "text": "He filed for divorce after 14 months\n\nFive years after divorcing pop star Katy Perry, comedian Russell Brand has revealed he would be willing to reconcile with his ex-wife.\n\nSpeaking to Grazia magazine in an exclusive interview, Russell, who has recently married his girlfriend Laura said,\n\n“It was a very important and lovely time in my life. I don’t regret being married to Katy at all.\"\n\nThe couple who met on the set of Get Him To The Greek in 2010 filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences after just 14 months of marriage in December 2011. Having tied the knot in a Hindu ceremony in October 2010, their divorce was finalised in 2012, however Russell said, \"I have very positive feelings about that whole experience and Katy is an extraordinary woman.”\n\nThe 42-year-old actor still has a tattoo that the pair both had done which says ‘Go with the flow’ in Sanskrit, when asked if he was going to keep it he said, “Of course I’m going to keep it.”\n\nHe was then asked if one day they would be friends and he replied,\n\n“Oh yeah, I hope so. I’m willing and open for reconciliation, any kind. Because if we can’t overcome our relatively trivial personal disputes in this world, what hope is there for us?”\n\nRussell is now married to 30-year-old Laura, who is a lifestyle blogger and sister of TV presenter Kirsty Gallacher. The couple married last month after their announcing their engagement in June last year.\n\nA month after announcing their engagement Russell then announced they were expecting their first child with a couple of funny Instagram posts.\n\nRussell and Laura now share 10-month-old daughter Mabel who was born in November 2016. Since the birth of his daughter he says being a father made marriage and monogamy so important to him. “It’s funny because marriage is such an external thing but I do think it’s good and it matters,” he explained.\n\n“It would have been a bit rich to call myself a feminist before, but having Mabel has made me one in a very simple way.\" he commented, \"I couldn’t consider the idea of being a woman before and now I can. And the thought that my daughter would be restricted, held down in any way or disqualified on the basis of her gender is one I really don’t care for at all.”\n\nMeanwhile in the years since divorcing, Katy Perry has gone on to date singer John Mayer, DJ and record producer Diplo, and actor Orlando Bloom, with whom she has been spotted again recently. Earlier this year she was put under the spotlight when she was asked by TV host James Corden to rank their performances in bed.\n\nThe full interview with Russell Brand appears in this week’s Grazia, on sale now.\n\nCheck out more showbiz stories from heat radio:"
