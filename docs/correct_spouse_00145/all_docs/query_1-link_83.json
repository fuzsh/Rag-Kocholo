        "text": "Katy Perry disappeared from the spotlight for a while after her very public marriage breakdown with Russell Brand, to take time to heal and to recover from her heartbreak.\n\nNow she's back with a brand-new album, full of power ballads like the hit tune Roar, and she's happily dating long-term crush John Mayer. And, even more inspiringly, she's confessed to W Magazine that she does not regret a single moment of her ill-fated marriage:\n\n\"I really loved it. It was a new, fun, exciting journey.\"\n\nMore importantly, she feels that her divorce has changed her - for the better - and she has learned to become more confident about herself in the process:\n\n\"I like how I am now, and I think all things happen for a reason.”\n\n“People talk about bullying, but you can be your own bully in some ways. You can be the person who is standing in the way of your success, and that was the case for me. I was having a great professional streak, but personally, I was really immature, so I had to balance those things out.”\n\nShe added: “If you are not happy with something, you should change it. So I went to a lot of therapy, and finally, I am able to speak up for myself: You are going to hear me roar!”\n\nWe're loving Katy Perry's positive attitude towards the past and we think, in summary, it has a very important lesson in it.\n\nNever regret any of your past relationships. Love is never a mistake; it is either a very good relationship or a very good lesson - and, for Katy, her divorce been a lesson in self-confidence."
