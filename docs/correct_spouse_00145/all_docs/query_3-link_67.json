        "text": "Katy Perry opened up a bit to Chelsea Handler on the comedian's Dear Chelsea podcast about the work she and her partner Orlando Bloom do to keep their relationship healthy. The two are in therapy, and both did the Hoffman Process (a kind of week-long therapy retreat) at different parts of their relationship.\n\nPerry was addressing a viewer, who asked how she could yell less with her boyfriend.\n\nPerry addressed the habit of yelling first, then the benefit of couple's therapy: “I have found that—I know it sounds also like a cliché—but like three deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. It just like expands your options in your brain to think differently than like 'red, red, red.' And I think you’re [Chelsea] correct about the whole—I know what it’s like to have been yelled at as a child so like remembering that and kind of going like, 'Oh, that never worked with me,' and knowing it’s not going to work with the other person.”\n\n“Your partners usually see your best and a lot of your worst sides because they’re there to be your mirrors,” Perry continued. “Orlando and I do couple's therapy, and we love it because it keeps us in tune, and the resentment can get really strong when you’re both working hard. And god bless successful people in the spotlight, and so when you want to come back to being normal in a domesticated world where you have a child and stuff like that, you have to really learn how to be kind of different out there in the big and in the small. And so we’ve had a lot of success with that couple's therapy.”\n\n“But she [the viewer] asked if there was a treatment or something like that,” Perry added. “I went to this place—I’m sure you’ve heard of it—called the Hoffman Process. And I went there—Orlando went before me.”\n\nKaty Perry and Orlando Bloom In New York City on January 27, 2022"
