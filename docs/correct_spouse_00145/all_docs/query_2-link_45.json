        "text": "Katy Perry has, of course, not commented on this weekend’s allegations against ex-husband Russell Brand – where four women have come forward via a joint investigation from The Times and Channel 4’s Dispatches accusing the comedian of rape, sexual assault and emotional abuse. And nor should she have to. Over the weekend, however, an old interview has resurfaced where Katy Perry spoke about her divorce from Russell Brand after their short whirlwind marriage, and hinted she knew “the real truth.”\n\nSpeaking to Vogue in 2013, Katy Perry spoke about the complexities of her marriage and split from Russell Brand. “At first when I met him, he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, ‘I can’t handle the equalness.’” She then said his attitude towards her pop career was “very controlling” which put a strain on their relationship – especially when she was touring. Katy Perry was at the peak of her pop prowess during their marriage – touring her seminal record Teenage Dream.\n\nThe most intriguing part of the interview is when Katy Perry says “I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth. I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.” The lack of specifics here and the fact she hasn’t divulged more has of course got people reading into this quote, in light of the allegations made towards Russell Brand on Saturday.\n\nOn Friday evening, before The Times and Dispatches levied their allegations, Russell Brand denied everything in a video statement.“I seriously refute these very, very serious criminal allegations. Also, it’s worth mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narrative that these two mainstream media outlets are trying to construct, apparently, in what seems to me to be a coordinated attack.”\n\nIf you’ve been affected by this story or are the victim of sexual assault, you can access help and resources via www.rapecrisis.org.uk or by calling the national telephone helpline on 0808 802 9999.\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n\n• New investigations and cutting ties: All that’s happened since the Russell Brand allegations\n\n• A Dannii Minogue interview has resurfaced where she called Russell Brand out in 2006\n\n• Here’s what actually went down between Russell Brand and The Geldofs"
