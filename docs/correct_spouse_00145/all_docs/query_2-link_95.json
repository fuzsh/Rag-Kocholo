        "text": "Katy Perry is a celebrity that has intrigued me for a long time, but I’ve only spoken about her in relation to important topics on this blog. Thanks to a particular loyal reader, ahem @guips95, I’m ready to dive deep into the world of Katy Perry.\n\nSince this is the first Katy post, we’re going to rewind about ten years in the past considering Katy was waaaaay messier back then, than she is now.\n\nEverything is according to a source unless otherwise stated.\n\nHer relationship with Russel Brand\n\nKaty’s relationship with Russel is notorious for ending very shortly after their marriage, him breaking up with her over text, and her having to go out and perform on tour directly after. This was shown in her Part of Me documentary from 2012.\n\nBut what really happened?\n\nFor starters, their marriage was very impulsive. They were having problems while they were dating so it was a shock to everyone that they would go on and get married.\n\nThey got married in 2010 in a traditional Hindu ceremony in India.\n\nThe fact that neither one of them was Hindu and yet they got married in a traditional Hindu ceremony should show you that the state of their relationship was merely for the aesthetic. Russel is believed to be an atheist, then he was Buddhist, and now? I don’t know.\n\nIn 2017, Russel said that “The marriage didn’t last for a very long time, and I think that is to do with the undulating nature of fame.'“ However, schedules didn’t have anything to do with it.\n\nThey were not compatible and there came a point where Katy was VERY bored with Russel. According to one source of mine, he was ready to settle down and have kids, but she wasn’t.\n\nAround this time, Katy started struggling with alcohol. She was drinking a lot and that had to do with her wanting to escape the relationship. At one point, Russel supposedly had a drinking problem, but Katy had a bigger problem than him. My source says that that caused a lot of problems in their marriage as well and he wanted her to get sober.\n\nRussel loves talking about anything that will give him attention and it’s why he brings up Katy from time to time. This was a nightmare for Katy after the divorce because he would constantly talk about it even though it was positive. She didn’t like how he was painting himself as an angel either.\n\nMy source also told me that Russel supposedly cheated on Katy… a lot.\n\nAnd trust me… we are going to talk about Katy as a person because she is not your typical backstabbing calculative menace of a celebrity that we’re used to talking about on this blog.\n\nSince their relationship happened a long time ago, my source doesn’t really remember any minor details about how they used to treat each other and all of that … so that’s Russel and Katy.\n\nKaty’s struggle with drugs and alcohol\n\nKaty opened up about her struggles with alcohol and addiction in general, but let me tell you something, Katy was known for her coke use in the industry.\n\nMy source called her the “coke queen” and everyone knew it. She tells me that her coke habit started taking off around 2014.\n\nBecause she was such a huge celebrity during those years, she had access to a whole other world of drugs, and there came a point where it was supposedly really bad and she only associated with those with the same habit.\n\nShe started getting out of hand around 2017. That was when everything started spiraling out of control for her.\n\nThat was one of her main breaking points.\n\nHer coke habit chilled around 2019 and then she was pregnant in 2020. I haven’t heard of her doing drugs since she became a mom.\n\nKaty and her drug associates\n\nAt some point during those coke years, Selena Gomez and Katy started getting super close; from one coke queen to another.\n\nThe peak of their drug sessions was in 2015.\n\nI’m not exactly sure what went on, but I assume it had to do with them exchanging drugs, dealing drugs to one another, exchanging their drug connections, and just a whole drug binge together.\n\nI am not really sure if they slept together or what the depth of that relationship was, but my source tells me it had to do with drugs.\n\nIn my professional opinion, I think that Katy and Abel hanging out probably also had to do with Selena. Selena and Abel broke up in October 2017 and that’s when she reconciled with Justin Bieber.\n\nSo why wouldn’t Katy wanna one up Selena? What do you guys think about my little theory? Do you think that Katy and Abel meeting up had something to do with Katy trying to get revenge on Selena for hooking up with her man? Or is this far-fetched?\n\nKaty and Orlando Bloom’s Relationship\n\nAccording to my source, Orlanda cheated on Katy a lot.\n\nHowever, my source tells me that he cheated on her a lot during their engagement. They got engaged on Valentine’s Day in 2019 and she got pregnant in 2020.\n\nInterestingly enough, they were going to break up shortly before she found out that she was pregnant.\n\nIt’s now 2022 and their wedding keeps getting postponed with Katy last saying in February 2022, that their destination wedding keeps getting put off every few months due to the new variants.\n\nGirl…\n\nMy bet? She won’t make it down the aisle.\n\nMy source also said that in 2021, their relationship was oddly under wraps as if they secretly broke up and didn’t tell anyone because Katy was pregnant. What do you guys think?\n\nShe describes her as someone who cannot stand up for herself and can easily get put in her place.\n\nThe way Katy’s career fell off in the industry after being one of the best selling pop stars of her time was a story that always intrigued me and now that I know that information, I can safely say it’s because Katy is not a shark in the industry.\n\nHow Katy went from having six #1 best selling singles from ONE ALBUM to being some random judge on The Voice and not being able to get a top 40 on Billboard, is a senior thesis that I am willing to commit to and research.\n\nI think it keeps me up at night… that and Demi Lovato’s Heart Attack not cracking the top ten on Billboard after debuting with 215,000 pure sales in one week.\n\nI personally believe that they were never an official thing because every time they run into each other, they are dating other people.\n\nIn 2018, they were rumored to be dating. However, Katy was too much of a coked-out mess to be with Rob at the time who was working on building his portfolio as a serious actor.\n\nThat wraps up this Katy Perry post! We talked about a lot here so I really wanna know what you guys think. Was this something you were expecting? Were you shocked to learn any of this information? What do you guys think about Katy Perry?\n\nAnd do you think that Taylor Swift is responsible for running Katy’s career?\n\nIf I didn’t get to a certain topic about Katy in this post, I can definitely talk more about her in future posts since there was a lot of ground to cover here.\n\nI hope you guys enjoyed this post! I am looking forward to reading what you guys think in the comments down below.\n\nWhere to find or contact us:"
