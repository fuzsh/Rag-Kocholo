        "text": "Past comments about Russell Brand from high-profile women - including his ex-wife Katy Perry - have resurfaced after he was accused of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.\n\nFour women claim Brand sexually assaulted them between 2006 and 2013 - with the allegations coming to light as part of an investigation by The Times, The Sunday Times and Channel 4 Dispatches over the weekend.\n\nThe 48-year-old comedian denies all claims against him - and says all his past relationships were consensual.\n\nRead more: Met Police receives 2003 Russell Brand sex assault claim\n\nIn 2006, pop star Dannii Minogue called Brand a \"vile predator\" while describing an appearance with him on his MTV chat show 1 Leicester Square.\n\nThe Australian singer, who had been promoting her album The Hits & Beyond, told The Mirror: \"[Brand] is completely crazy and a bit of a vile predator. I certainly don't think he has cured his sex addiction, that's for sure. He wouldn't take no for an answer.\n\n\"He's obviously very intelligent - but he wears more make-up than I do. Normally, I love guys with eyeliner on. It can be very sexy, but not on Russell. Absolutely no way, never, he's just not my type.\n\n\"Throughout the whole interview, he kept making shocking remarks that I can't even repeat. Just uttering the words would make me blush.\"\n\nClick to subscribe to the Sky News Daily wherever you get your podcasts\n\nAnother past interview from Brand's ex-wife Katy Perry has also resurfaced, with the pop star describing Brand's behaviour as \"very controlling\", and talking about what she called the \"real truth\" about him that she would not disclose.\n\nBrand and Perry were married between October 2010 and July 2012.\n\nIn the Vogue interview from 2013, speaking about their former relationship, Perry said: \"I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can't necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.\"\n\nBrand got his big TV break in 2000, presenting several shows on MTV. He went on to host the Big Brother spin-off show on Channel 4 from 2004.\n\nHe became one of the biggest comedians of the 2000s - eventually breaking the US and carving out a career in Hollywood.\n\nMore recently he has rebranded as a wellness influencer, attracting millions of followers on social media.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat are the allegations against Russell Brand?\n\nBrand: From drug addict to comedy star\n\nFollowing the accusations against him, Brand has been dropped by his London-based agent Tavistock Wood as well as several charities he was associated with.\n\nBrand's supporters include tech billionaire Elon Musk and controversial influencer Andrew Tate - both of whom have defended the comedian online.\n\nBrand performed a sold-out comedy gig in northwest London on Saturday night, and is due to perform again in Windsor on Tuesday evening."
