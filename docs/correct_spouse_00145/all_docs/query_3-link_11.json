        "text": "January 2016: They were photographed hitting it off at the Golden Globes\n\nBloom and Perry were spotted getting very close at CAA's 2016 Golden Globes after party. Anonymous attendees told Us Weekly that the two were also seen dancing together.\n\n\"Katy and Orlando Bloom had a total dance-off — it was the best part of the party,\" one source said. \"Katy literally dropped to the floor and was waving her booty around, beckoning Orlando.\"\n\nPerry later told Jimmy Kimmel that she and Bloom hit it off at the awards ceremony.\n\n\"We bonded over an In-N-Out burger about three years [ago] at the Golden Globes. He stole one off of my table,\" she said in 2019. \"He took it, and I was like, 'Wait! Who — oh, you're so hot. Fine, take it!' And then I saw him at a party, and I was like, 'How are those onions resting on your molars?' He's like, 'I like you.'\"\n\nMay 2016: Bloom and Perry were both at the Cannes Film Festival, but didn't arrive to any public events together\n\nAfter Us Weekly confirmed their \"fun hookup thing\" in February and they were spotted at Coachella together in April, Bloom and Perry appeared to purposefully avoid each other in public.\n\nAn anonymous attendee of the amfAR Gala at the Cannes Film Festival, which took place on May 19, 2016, told Us Weekly that Bloom and Perry would whisper to each other from adjacent tables throughout the evening — but the in-house photographers \"were advised not to take any pictures of the pair when they were chatting.\"\n\nMay 20, 2016: The couple became 'Instagram official'\n\nIt appears that Bloom and Perry spent more time together in France than paparazzi and photographers were able to capture.\n\nWhen Perry posted a photo of the couple in Cannes on Instagram, many took it to be an official confirmation of their relationship.\n\nAugust 2016: They weathered their first scandal\n\nThe two were photographed paddleboarding while on vacation together in Italy — and Bloom made headlines for going nude.\n\n\"It was extremely surprising,\" he later told ELLE UK about the photos. \"I wouldn't have put myself in that position if I'd thought it would happen.\"\n\nFebruary 2017: Bloom and Perry announced they would be taking 'respectful, loving space' apart\n\nOn February 28, 2017, amid rampant breakup reports, representatives for the two stars confirmed their split to \"Entertainment Tonight\": \"Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand, we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time.\"\n\nTwo days later, Perry tweeted, \"U can still b friends & love ur former partners!\"\n\nThree years later, Perry told SiriusXM's CBC Radio One that she was close to suicide after their breakup, which coincided with the rollout of her fifth album, \"Witness.\"\n\n\"I had broken up with my boyfriend, who is now my baby-daddy-to-be, and then I was excited about flying high off the next record,\" Perry said. \"But the validation did not make me high, and so I just crashed.\"\n\nAugust 2017: They were spotted together again — but Perry appeared to shut down reconciliation rumors\n\nFans were divided over their relationship status when Bloom and Perry were seen attending Ed Sheeran's concert together.\n\nLess than one month later, Perry addressed the reported reconciliation on Sirius XM.\n\n\"I think people are in and out of your life. It's nice to keep people you love around you,\" she said. \"For me, it's never so extreme. So, when you get older, lines get blurred. And you know what, I'm really busy. I'm about to go on tour for another year.\"\n\nBloom told ELLE UK in November 2017 that he and Perry were \"friends.\"\n\n\"It's good. We're all grown-up,\" he said. \"She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don't think anybody cares what I'm up to. Nor should they. It's between us.\"\n\nApril 2018: Bloom and Perry were officially back on\n\nAmid reports of their reunion and flirty social media exchanges — which included Perry tagging Bloom in a flirty Instagram story — the singer confirmed in an interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" that she was in a relationship.\n\n\"I have been spoken for and speak for myself,\" she said, \"and I'm very happy!\"\n\nJust days later, Bloom accompanied Perry on a visit to Rome, where she was scheduled to be one of the speakers at the United to Cure event.\n\nPerry called Bloom \"my darling\" in a video of the two on their way to the Vatican, where they met Pope Francis side-by-side.\n\nSeptember 2018: They made their red carpet debut\n\nThe couple attended the Gala for the Global Ocean together in Monte-Carlo, Monaco.\n\nDecember 2018: Perry outbid a fan to win a date with her own boyfriend\n\nThe pop star was performing at One Love Malibu, a fundraiser held at King Gillette Ranch in Calabasas, California, for those affected by the Woolsey Fire. She auctioned off a date with Bloom, which would include a motorcycle ride and lunch.\n\n\"You're holding him in a way that I am not excited about,\" she said when encouraging fans to bid for the prize. \"You're holding his pecs and his six-pack — and it's so glorious. … You get to hold on to Orlando for about 45 minutes … and then, you get to stare into his brown eyes!\"\n\nThe bidding reached $20,000 thanks to one excited fan named Laura, but Perry wasn't having it.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"Laura, I'm sorry. I'm buying it for $50,000,\" she said, before dropping the microphone and walking off stage.\n\nFans were divided over the gesture and couldn't decide if it was sweet or annoying.\n\nLater that month, Bloom posted a photo of a holiday card that included Perry's name; the name of Bloom's son, Flynn; and the names of all their pets. The couple also announced their pledge to reduce their use of plastic.\n\nFebruary 14, 2019: Bloom and Perry got engaged\n\nBoth stars posted the same close-up couple shot on Instagram, featuring a massive flower-shaped pink diamond on Perry's left ring finger.\n\nBloom wrote, \"Lifetimes,\" while Perry captioned her post, \"full bloom.\"\n\nPerry's mother posted (and later deleted) photos of the couple apparently at a Valentine's Day-themed engagement party. \"Look who got engaged on Valentine's Day!!\" she reportedly captioned the images on Facebook.\n\nThree months later, Perry shared details about the elaborate proposal during an interview with Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp.\n\n\"It was Valentine's Day and I had to work that day,\" she said. \"I just remember meeting him at dinner at this place, this Italian restaurant, because when I get a pass, I just want to stuff my face with pasta.\"\n\n\"So I get there and, I mean, he's like clean-shaven. He's not wearing tennis shoes. I'm like, 'Ah shit, something is going down!'\" Perry continued. \"I got on a helicopter and he asked me to marry him, and then we landed on this building and then went downstairs and my family and friends were there and the most flowers you've ever seen.\"\n\nAugust 2019: Bloom said they're in no rush to tie the knot\n\n\"It's important to me that we are aligned — I've been married and divorced and I don't want to do it again,\" Bloom said during an appearance on Today. \"And we're both fully aware of that. She's remarkable and so I'm always so impressed with that and I'm encouraged.\"\n\nJanuary 2020: Perry opened up about their relationship and called Bloom 'an anchor who holds me down'\n\nIn her Vogue India cover story, Perry described Bloom as \"very real.\"\n\n\"He's not the number one fan of Katy Perry, but he's the number one fan of Katheryn Hudson,\" she told the magazine.\n\n\"Orlando is like a sage. When we first met, he said we would pull the poison out of each other, and we really do,\" she continued. \"It's exhausting, but we really hold each other accountable. I've never had a partner who was willing to go on an emotional and spiritual journey like Orlando. It's challenging, because you're facing all the things you don't like about yourself. It's like a never-ending cleanse.\"\n\nMarch 5, 2020: Perry revealed that she was pregnant with the couple's first child\n\nPerry revealed her pregnancy in the music video for a new song, \"Never Worn White.\"\n\n\"I've never worn white / But I'm standin' here tonight / 'Cause I really wanna say 'I do,'\" she sings in the ballad, which nods to how she wore a gray wedding dress when she married Russell Brand.\n\nAfter the music video launched, Perry confirmed her pregnancy during an Instagram livestream and said she's due summer 2020.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"There's a lot that will be happening this summer,\" Perry said. \"Not only will I be giving birth, literally, but also figuratively to something you guys have been waiting for.\"\n\nThat \"something\" turned out to be Perry's sixth studio album, \"Smile.\"\n\nApril 3, 2020: Perry revealed they were expecting a daughter\n\nThe couple apparently threw a gender reveal party in early April. Perry posted a photo of Bloom's face, covered in what looks like pink icing.\n\n\"It's a girl,\" she wrote.\n\nAugust 2020: Perry discussed their 'spiritual' connection again\n\nIn an interview with The Times of London, Perry said she and Bloom are bound together by \"spiritual evolution.\"\n\n\"He's very sensitive. Very emotionally evolved,\" she said. \"He gets up at 7 a.m. and chants for an hour. One of the things that binds us is our desire to be more spiritually evolved? And our desire to investigate that realm? One of our main love languages is the spiritual evolution.\"\n\n\"We love mysticism, conspiracies, aliens, all that stuff. We love an adventure of the mind. That's definitely something we are bound by.\"\n\nAugust 26, 2020: Perry gave birth to their daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom\n\nAs Goodwill Ambassadors, Perry and Bloom's birth announcement was posted by UNICEF on Instagram. The post was shared alongside a donation page to \"help every mother and newborn get the care they need.\"\n\n\"We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,\" the couple told UNICEF.\n\n⠀\n\n\"But we know we're the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was,\" they continued. \"Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes.\"\n\n\"In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB's arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child.\"\n\nOctober 7, 2020: Bloom gushed about their daughter on 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show'\n\n\"It was funny because when she first came out I was like, 'Oh it's me it's a mini-me!' Then, fortunately, she got those Katy blues which was perfect,\" Bloom told Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nThe actor, who practices Buddhism, also told the talk-show host that he begins every morning by chanting and Daisy \"soothes a bit\" when she hears his voice.\n\n\"She responds very nicely,\" he said. \"It's like I'm a baby whisperer. I'm definitely winning daddy points.\"\n\nJanuary 13, 2022: Perry said that Daisy is 'a combination of both me and her father'\n\nPerry gave an update on motherhood during an interview with People.\n\n\"Daisy is great,\" she said. \"She is a combination of both me and her father, which we are fearless with lots of chutzpah and just big characters. So the combination of us both is definitely coming out.\"\n\nShe added: \"It's amazing to see everything new again through a toddler's eyes.\"\n\nFebruary 8, 2022: Perry said the coronavirus pandemic had prevented their wedding\n\nDuring an interview with Australian radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O, Perry said the couple originally planned to get married in Japan in 2020, but it was postponed due to the pandemic.\n\n\"It's a destination location,\" she said. \"We're still trying for it to work out.\"\n\nShe added: \"Every couple of months it's like, 'New variant! New variant! New variant!'\"\n\nAugust 2, 2022: Perry hinted that she wants to have more kids with Bloom\n\nWhen People asked if Perry sees more children in her future, she replied, \"I'm a planner,\" adding, \"So we'll see.\"\n\nThe chart-topper had previously told Chelsea Handler that she didn't think she'd become a mother until she met Bloom.\n\n\"I wasn't very maternal and I think that probably stems from some childhood stuff,\" she said during an episode of Handler's podcast.\n\n\"Orlando, I got to see what a great dad he was with his first child, Flynn,\" she continued. \"So that definitely, primally influenced me — something inside of me said, 'You, mid-30s. This man is nice. Must breed. He is a kind man.'\"\n\nFebruary 2023: Bloom said their relationship can be 'really, really, really challenging'\n\nFor the March 2023 cover of Flaunt, the actor discussed challenges that he and Perry face, describing her as his \"baby mama and life partner.\"\n\n\"We're in two very different pools,\" Bloom told the magazine. \"Her pool is not a pool that I necessarily understand, and I think my pool is not a pool that she necessarily understands.\"\n\nBloom added: \"Sometimes things are really, really, really challenging. I won't lie.\""
