        "text": "Katy Perry met ex-husband Russell Brand while filming a romantic scene for Get Him to the Greek, but their real-life romance didn’t pan out.\n\n“When he was filming Get Him to the Greek, I did a cameo with him. My scene called for me to make out with him,” Perry told Glamour in 2010 about working with Brand two years earlier. “And on the way down the stairs after the scene, I was hopping like a bunny. I hop like a bunny when I’m happy — I get a bit childlike. He gives me the Christmas Eve jitters.”\n\nWhile the scene was ultimately cut from the movie, their interaction gave her the courage to make the first move when Brand was on stage at the VMAs the following year. “I was 25, 30 feet away from him. And I threw the bottle straight at him. Hit him smack dab on the head,” Perry told Esquire in July 2010.\n\nThe duo announced their engagement in January 2010 after just four months of dating and tied the knot during a Hindu ceremony in India in October of that year. However, their relationship ended just as quickly as it began.\n\nBrand announced in December 2011 that he and Perry had decided to call it quits after just over one year of marriage. In July 2012, Brand explained to Howard Stern that while he “loved [Perry] so much,” he ultimately realized that their relationship just wasn’t working.\n\nKeep scrolling to relive Brand and Perry’s whirlwind romance:"
