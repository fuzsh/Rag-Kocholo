        "text": "KATY Perry has moved on with a new baby with fiance Orlando Bloom.\n\nBut she made a rare comment about her short-lived marriage to comedian Russell Brand, nine years since their split.\n\nThe singer, 35, called the marriage \"like a tornado,\" as she promoted her new album on 60 Minutes Australia, in an interview which aired on Sunday.\n\nKaty - who welcomed daughter Daisy Dove last Tuesday - described the relationship with Brand as the \"first breaking of my idealistic mind.\"\n\n\"I was having great success at 23, 24 and 25 and then I met someone that was interesting and stimulating. It was just like a tornado, it was everything happening at once,\" she revealed.\n\nThe Smile singer added that she has \"always resonated with friction and resistance and challenges,\" and said that she knows that about herself.\n\nBritish actor Brand and Katy wed in a lavish Indian ceremony in 2010, before splitting the next year.\n\nThey divorced after 14 months of marriage.\n\nKaty previously told Vogue that Brand was the one who decided to end their marriage when he sent her a text message on New Year's Eve 2011, informing her that he planned to file for divorce.\n\n\"He's a very smart man, and I was in love with him when I married him,\" Perry said at the time \"Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\"\n\nKaty described her relationship with Orlando Bloom in far healthier terms, calling it \"a healthy frictional, very open, very communicative, nothing is swept under the mat type of relationship.\"\n\n\"It's like, we should probably walk into the other room to discuss something where we disagree because we'll just do it in public,\" she told them. \"But I think if we can get to the ends of our lives together, we'll be each other's greatest teachers.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Dating is different. Weekend lovers? That's fun, that's candy. This is solid. This is like the main course.\"\n\nKaty and Orlando were set to tie the knot in Japan earlier this summer but decided against it because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic."
