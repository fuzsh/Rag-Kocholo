Call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.\n\nResurfaced comments suggest Katy Perry knew a hidden truth about ex-husband Russell Brand 10 years before allegations against him surfaced.\n\nPerry married the British comedian in October 2010 after beginning their relationship a year earlier. 14 months later, Brand announced that he and Perry were separating. In 2013, Perry dished on the breakup during a Vogue interview.\n\nShe called Brand’s behavior during the marriage, “very controlling,” and claimed he didn’t like her being the boss in her own career. “At first when I met him he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, I can’t handle the equalness,” she said.\n\nPerry, 38, also alluded to a secret about Brand, 48, that she uncovered after the split. “I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth, which I can’t necessarily disclose because I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day,” she said. “I let go and I was like: This isn’t because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that.” In the same interview, Perry also claimed that the last time she spoke to Brand was when he informed her that he was filing for divorce via text.\n\nOver the weekend, Brand spoke out to deny allegations of sexual assault made by four women in a British documentary and The Times and Sunday Times newspapers. The alleged assaults took place between 2006 and 2013. One woman claims she was 16 when the alleged assault occurred.\n\nSince the claims were made public, British police have received a report of a sexual assault that took place in London in 2003. In a statement, police did not name Brand but mentioned the TV and newspaper allegations.\n\nIn a video shared on his social media, Brand condemned the “extremely egregious and aggressive attacks.” He admitted that he was “very, very promiscuous” at the time of the alleged assaults but claimed his relationships were “consensual.” Brand wife also appears to have had a very pointed response to the allegations."
