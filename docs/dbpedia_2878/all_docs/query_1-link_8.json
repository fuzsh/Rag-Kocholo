        "text": "Just working my way through the neutropils factory and man the stealth sequences are great showcase for the upgraded lighting. It's all just so much more dynamic. Great way of bringing those scenes to life even further.\n\nAlso this is my nth time playing it but I'm just kind of now realizing - was uncharted pretty heavily influenced by this whole \"adventure game with an AI companion who quips and solves puzzles with you\" or am I forgetting another stand out that preceded BGE? Even when Peyj is not present, they often replace him - it's a more prominent aspect of the game than my memory gives it credit for.\n\nPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time has a number of sections where you solve puzzles and fight enemies with Farah with constant dialogue, but it's not as consistent as BG&E. Interestingly both games were published by Ubisoft right at around the same time.\n\nI first played this game on PS2 and as far as I got was the Slaughterhouse before I stopped playing for some reason. IIRC, I just couldn't figure out how to progress.\n\nI'm playing on Switch and finally, I bought all of the items from Mamago and made it to the moon. I'm very happy with my progress in the game so far.\n\nI'm really enjoying the game, though it certainly isn't a polished release -- I've encountered several weird bugs while playing on the Switch. For example, while I can happily invert all the controls, I think doing so makes using the photo camera in the very late-game spaceship double-invert back to non-inverted. (But thankfully I only needed to take one photo at this point, so far, at least).\n\nThe game also crashed on me once, when I talked to the rhino at Mamago. But thankfully it autosaves, so it didn't set me back at all.\n\nStill, it's a pretty great game.\n\nUbisoft's software slams your CPU with an anti-malware scan, as you start and as you exit the game. Particularly on exit, it puts my 7800X3D at 85c. Which doesn't even happen after 10 minutes of Cinibench R23 (that tops out at 78c). Steam version here.\n\nIt also blatantly ignored my user input, when I denied permissions to \"make changes to your PC\" or to connect the game to my account. I denied it all, just to see what would happen. It went ahead and installed itself and connected the game anyway.\n\nSeems like they didn't fix a bunch of the bugs introduced from the HD version. Missing graphical effects in cutscenes, broken shadows and camera glitches are all still there. Would be nice to have an option to enable the letterboxing from the original release too.\n\nI generally like the work they've done with this new edition though. Occasionally the work seems far too high fidelity, feeling out of place or flattening out the OG style. There's some grievances I have regarding the changed colour grading as well. Hopefully some patches are in the works, these feels a couple of crucial tweaks away from being the definitive version because it's otherwise quite impressive.\n\nI haven't started my playthrough yet but did anyone else get an update on Steam today? Can't seem to find any patch notes atm.\n\nI have it via Ubisoft Connect, not Steam, but got the same update.\n\nPatch notes just say 'General stability fixes' but looking at the Steam forums, the update did absolutely sod all.\n\nI'm one of the people affected by the AMD GFX driver bug, meaning I can't play it at all, and the game still crashed in the exact same spot(s) it did before the update.\n\nPicked this up last night and was surprised at how hard it gets the Steam deck huffing and puffing when playing at 60fps. Fans basically cranking at full, it sounds like.\n\nOut of curiosity I installed the original release of the game to compare and... it kinda does the same thing. Something about this game just really gets those fans spinning.\n\nThis won't launch on my Steam Deck anymore - Ubisoft Connect launches, and then I just get a black screen. I've tried verifying the game files and deleting the proton files and letting UbiConnect reinstall but same result. Anybody else having the same issue? PaulloDEC, is yours still launching?\n\nI've just tried it, then restarted the Deck and tried it again; both times it's booted up as usual. Not sure what might be going on with yours unfortunately!\n\nBeat this a few days ago, and I really liked it!\n\nAlways wanted to play it as a kid but never got the opportunity. So I'm glad it lived up to my childhood expectations. Reminded me a lot of Rayman 3 which I played a bunch as a kid, obviously not in terms of plot or gameplay, but more so the aesthetic and graphics. Wouldn't be surprised if they ran on the same engine. God I miss 6th gen ubisoft.\n\nAlso loved how diverse the cast was. Black female MC, and pretty much the entire human cast are POC. This game would be considered super diverse by today's standards, much less 2003.\n\nMusic was excellent as well. My only complaints is that I hated the stealth in this game. Stealth is very hard to do right and unfortunately I don't think it was great here, which sucks because it's such a large part of the game. Also that final boss was ass. The inverted controls are one thing, but the constant stun locking, losing all your healing items, and having to see that same unskippable cutscene over and over were torture.\n\nOther than that, great game!\n\nMan I fell off hard. I think it told me to go to the slaughter house and I stopped because I played like 3 or so hours of the previous dungeon and had fun. But that was a month ago and I haven't had the want to pick it back up. I really should before it slips into the deep back logs\n\nMan I fell off hard.

But that was a month ago and I haven't had the want to pick it back up. I really should before it slips into the deep back logs\n\nNot much left to go! Def worth picking back up, slaughter house is a great dungeon\n\nMan I fell off hard.

But that was a month ago and I haven't had the want to pick it back up. I really should before it slips into the deep back logs\n\nAre you me? Same exact thing happened to me. I stopped playing for stellar blade which I also ended up dropping for trails through daybreak. I do want to go back and finish this though."
