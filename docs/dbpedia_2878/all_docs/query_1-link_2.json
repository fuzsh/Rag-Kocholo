        "text": "In 2004 I played what remains one of my favorite and for my money one of the greatest video games of all time. It is called “Beyond Good and Evil.” Man was this game something else! Developed and published by Ubisoft the game could be found anywhere you ever so pleased. It was available for all the top platforms at the time; Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube and the PC. It was released internationally and there were even a few prime time tv spots. But the marketing of the game was a little flat, people didn’t know what the game was about or weren’t pressed enough to care and so this title ended up in the bargain bin fairly quick. Which was a plus for me in my poor high school days as I was able to buy the game for just $15. This is all besides the point, what is important is that “Beyond Good and Evil” offered me one of the most enjoyable video game experiences ever.\n\nMost people agree with me. Though the game was not a success financially, critics and just about everyone who played it loved and admired the game. It dared to be different in a sense, especially with its concept and it remains one of the best storylines ever translated for a console. In my humble opinion few games since this one have been able to match it’s rich dialogue, engaging plot, fun characters, beautiful scenery, soundtrack and or creative blend of gameplay. (This is of course on video game standards I’m not saying Gene Wilder wrote the script I’m just saying its good.) Well the good word of mouth seems to have served the intended franchise well as there are plans to make a sequel. So you may be asking why I feel “Beyond Good and Evil” should be a major motion picture.\n\nI could simply answer “Because I think its awesome!” But that’s not giving this game it’s credit. And goshdarnit I’m going to try my best to make sure the whole world knows about this electronic achievement and demands a movie be made! Some of you, actually most of you probably don’t even know what this game is all about so let me fill ya’ in real quick.\n\nThe game takes place on a remote mining planet in the year 2435. This remote planet is called Hillys. In this world aliens are generally anthropomorphic animals and humans as in most sci-fi films live on the planet as well. Its implied that humans colonized the planet generations ago, as there is a quite advanced society on the planet similar to earth’s. The planet was a peaceful one (that never lasts for long) until it came under siege from the DomZ an alien life form that abducts people and drains their energy and or infects them to make them into mindless drones. It isn’t long before the entire planet becomes a military dictatorship run by the Alpha Sections. The Alpha sections are super seedy and it doesn’t take long before an underground resistance named the IRIS network takes root in hopes of exposing the Alpha Sections who are most likely working with the DomZ.\n\nThe lead protagonist in this story is Jade. A photo journalist with an iron will and a heart of gold who becomes personally invested in the dealings of the DomZ and Alpha Sections when the orphanage she helps run with a pig-like caretaker named Pey’j is attacked by the DomZ and some of the children are kidnapped. To make matters worse Jade doesn’t have enough money to pay the bills that keeps the protective shield of the orphanage running. (Part of the reason the DomZ are able to attack them.) Jade due to her combat skills with a staff and her impressive photo skills is recruited by the IRIS network to expose the truth about the DomZ and the Alpha Sections.\n\nThis is really when the game picks up. Jade must work with several people to infiltrate secret Alpha Sections’ bases of operation and has to gain photo evidence of anything incriminating she sees. Jade can fight, but she can become easily outnumbered so the game heavily relies on efficient stealth and photo journalism. It’s an action-adventure, but it’s also a puzzle game that will test your nerves at times. The use of the staff is unconventional but it constantly reminds you that Jade is the everyday woman fighting for the resistance. She isn’t out to kill, but she will if she has to. Plus with the millions of games where the hero uses a weapon such as a gun this helps “Beyond Good and Evil” stand out in my eyes from the rest of the pack.\n\nNow I’ll stop there with too many notes on the gameplay as this isn’t as much a review as it is a call to action from Hollywood. This game could finally be the “Spiderman” to video game movies. The movie that could cause video games to be taken seriously when being adapted for the silver screen. No more of that “Alone in the Dark” crap, that “Prince of Persia” tomfoolery and may that “Dead or Alive” movie forever burn in cinematic hell.\n\nThis already has a stellar plot, a great cast of characters, and an environment that could make any art director and or director of photography drool over twisting and re creating. I know the financial woes of this game could turn off potential investors and producers in the project but if marketed right this time it really could be a box office success.\n\nI don’t even think a huge budget is in order to make this film a reality. The entire cast could be relative unknowns, big A-list stars are not needed. The bulk of the money should be spent on ensuring the script is faithful to the game and is well formed, that the set design and special effects look convincing and then finally hiring the right director. When it comes to a director I’d go with someone who knows science fiction/fantasy but also can operate on that sense of dread and mystery. “Beyond Good and Evil” is not as bleak as say “Alien” or “The Thing” so David Fincher as much as I like him probably would make this film a bit too dark. There needs to be that right tone as the game does have it’s great moments of comic relief. Sure I’d like to direct it, but if I never get the chance someone such as; J.J Abrams, DJ Caruso or Stephen Sommers would be a good fit I feel. Michel Ancel created the world of the game so any studio would be foolish not to have him on at the least as a consultant.\n\nAs far as actors and actresses go for a film such as this I think most parts could be well handled by a casting director. I think April Webster and Alyssa Weisberg (“Star Trek” 2009) would be the first people I called. However for the role of Jade the character goes through a very interesting arch that is more dynamic than it is dramatic and due to the possibility of a sequel is never fully fleshed out. So maybe one day when Ubisoft finally gets around to publishing “Beyond Good and Evil 2” we’ll know more about her. Maybe I’m biased because I interviewed her on my radio show “The Final Cut” but I think she would be a great pick. She shares a resemblance to Jade and with some combat training ( and or a stunt double that magically looks like her) she could really sell as the futuristic heroine. So keep that note big shot producers, you heard it from me first.\n\nIn conclusion “Beyond Good and Evil” could be made into a true sci fi epic thriller. It has action, drama, comedy, suspense, mystery and a certain charismatic energy few games have ever been able to match. So first I urge you to play the game, then I urge you to give your thumbs up of approval of this masterpiece of interactive media becoming a movie. I know that I may just have to make this myself, but just in case someone reads this and decides I’m onto something make sure when you make the movie you give me a special thanks credit."
