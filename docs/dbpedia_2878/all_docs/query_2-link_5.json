        "text": "Ubisoft's laziness.\n\nLet me get one thing straight about this rant. Beyond Good and Evil is a great game. And this rant has nothing to do with the game it self. But how Ubisoft went about releasing this version of the game.\n\nIs beyond good and Evil a great game? Yes! Great story great gameplay memorable characters etc.\n\nThe problem is the sheer laziness when it came to putting it up on Steam. Beyond Good and Evil was originally released on the Game Cube with a PS2 and Xbox version as well as an old fashioned PC port. Now considering this game is a bit old a classic. You'd think that before putting up a an version of the game on steam that Ubisoft would have had the common sense of... \"Hey computers don't quite work the same way as they did back then. Perhaps we should optimize it so it will work without issue?\"\n\nNope they just flat out took the original PC version of the game put it on steam and waited for the bucks to roll in. The game it self doesn't have high performance demands.. Infact the majority of issues with the steam version is more that it wasn't updated so that the changes to how computers work would allow it to run 100% smoothly instead of requiring a tone of effort on the player's part.\n\nNow I got an X-box 360 controller yet the game isn't right out of the download capable of using it. (Requires work from the player to even reginize the buttons.) On top of that. Sound issues with computers that have more then one core, or certain graphics card brands it always thinks are out of date even when fully updated. Flickering screen and texture problems etc.\n\nThe fact theres so much the typical player of the steam version have to do to get it into a playable state is just outright an outrage.\n\nIt's not like we players didn't pay for our steam copy. Or for that matter set the price because I know there's always going to be the one guy who will use the fact the price wasn't high as an excuse. WE PLAYERS DIDN'T SET THE PRICE! THAT'S NOT A VALID EXCUSE!\n\nWhen you consider how unplayable it is unless you tweak so much you as the player realize your doing what should have been the publisher's job from the start!\n\nTHERE IS NO REASON WHY THE STEAM VERSION COULDN'T HAVE BEEN COMPATABLE WITH X-BOX CONTROLERS AS THIS GAME WAS RELEASED ALREADY ON THE X-BOX! THERE IS NO EXCUSE THAT UBISOFT DIDN'T OPTIMIZE IT FOR MODERN COMPUTERS!\n\nTHE REASON UBISOFT ISN'T SECCESSFULLY SELLING GAMES AS MUCH AS IT WOULD LIKE IS BECAUSE OF SLEEZY TACTICS LIKE THIS!\n\nWe players have less and less trust in both the quality of your games as well as the quality of your customer service and support of popular games. If you can't simply make sure an ledgendary quality game like Beyond Good and Evil can run propperly on good computers then how likely are players to buy more games from you?\n\nOptimizing a game isn't that difficult. The game itself was already made. Your job is merely to edit a couple system things so it will run propperly from the get go without errors.\n\nIf you wanna restore the gaming community's trust in your games how about you start by fixing the problems in not only your classic games but also your current ones. A Simple patch could fix all the problems with the steam version of Beyond Good and Evil.\n\nWHEN IS THAT PATCH GOING TO ARRIVE?!"
