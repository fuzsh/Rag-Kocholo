        "text": "Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition is a remaster that few asked for, but it offers good technical improvements, adds new content and brings us a little closer to Beyond Good & Evil 2. If you have never played it you should give it a try and if you did, it never hurts to enjoy it again if you are a fan of the saga.\n\nReview in Spanish | Read full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition takes one of Michel Ancel's best works and recaptures its multi-genre format at a very different time in gaming. Pure early millennium action in a great adventure that mixes mechanics to still feel as fresh and as powerful as it did almost 21 years ago. Ubisoft sets the stage for Beyond Good and Evil 2 with a powerful gallery full of content, a new Speed Run mode and a new mission in the final stretch that better explains the story of Jade and her nature.\n\nReview in Spanish | Read full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is an absolute classic, and the 20th Anniversary Edition makes it easier than ever to appreciate why. The characters are endearing, the visuals are mostly amazing, the music is incredible, and the gameplay is a ton of fun on top of all that. If this is your first time stepping into Jade's sneakers or your 20th, now has never been a better time to explore the beauty of Hillys.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil – 20th Anniversary Edition is the absolute best way to replay a cult classic of a game. It still retains the look and feel of the original, while providing some much needed improvements like resolution, frame rate, controls and more. Hopefully this edition will create a new generation of fans. It truly is a must-play game.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good and Evil turns 20 and returns to our screens with the inevitable signs of time, which however have not totally spoiled the freshness of its gameplay, a still valid story and a cast among the best ever created by Ubisoft.\n\nReview in Italian | Read full review\n\nNintendo has been getting heat for the pricing of its recent Switch remasters, so to see Ubisoft's Beyond Good & Evil so lovingly restored for a reasonable price is a true joy. The 20th Anniversary Edition boasts some lovely visual and auditory upgrades, an excellent gallery feature, and a whole bunch of meaningful extras that make this journey back into Hillys well worth taking. Granted, the 30fps performance on Switch is a bit of a bummer compared to other platforms, and there's no denying that the experience has aged considerably in certain areas, but the gameplay is so varied, and the world so unique, that you'd be remiss not to at least give it a shot. Welcome back, 'Yade'.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil's 20th Anniversary Edition does a commendable job of freshening up an experience that had long aged out of its must-play status. Enhanced visuals that don't dull the original charm, welcome quality-of-life and control improvements and a nice smattering of extra content go a long way to making this a worthwhile revisit to Hillys.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is proving a timeless game, and $19.99 for this 20th Anniversry edition with extras and updates is \"beyond\" fair. In truth, the original was already great back in the day, though being beloved by critics didn't translate into high sales. So, I'm happy that this action-adventure is getting progressively more popular with the advancement of time, as it's an outstanding game not to be missed!\n\nRead full review\n\nThe Y2K sensibilities of the game design hold up and there is a quaintness to the French cartoony aesthetics that crystalizes the moment in time this game came out. Beyond Good and Evil aged well; even without visual updates, it would still be a good-looking and fun game. Maybe it is setting things up for the next game Ubisoft has been cooking up for over a decade, or perhaps it’s bringing new players up to speed; either way I am curious about what comes next.\n\nRead full review\n\nBeyond Good & Evil's characters and story still have something to offer in the current age, and its small world is a refreshing change to the huge, open expanses seen in every other game today. Although it lacks quality in a multitude of areas, including combat, stealth sections, and camera controls, Jade's quest attempts to tell a compelling narrative that will have players eager to reach its conclusion. It seems quite clear after playing that Beyond Good & Evil was supposed to be something much more than what it is, and it remains to be seen where things go from here, but this adventure harks back to a fun era in video games and holds up just about well enough that it deserves a playthrough today - just maybe have a guide at the ready to figure a few things out.\n\nRead full review\n\nThe brave 2000s were a completely different period in videogame history. Franchising started to reach enormous heights and unknown players such as Beyond Good and Evil had unfortunately gone unnoticed. However, this inventive title slowly gained a cult following, and now after 20 years, its Anniversary Edition is hand-delivering a truly passionate love letter to all fans! This game was ahead of its time and once again shines thanks to updated visuals, better performance, and wholesome bonus content.\n\nReview in Slovak | Read full review"
