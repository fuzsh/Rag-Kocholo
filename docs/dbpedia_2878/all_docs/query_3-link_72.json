        "text": "It looks like an updated version of Ubisoft’s iconic PS2 era platformer Beyond Good & Evil could be coming to the PS5, as a listing for a 20th Anniversary Edition has been uncovered on the US ratings board website, the ESRB. While the game hasn’t been officially announced by the French publisher, it’s rare for classifications like this to appear erroneously.\n\nThe original game launched in 2003, although it was later ported to the PS3 in 2011. Obviously, a sequel was announced several years ago, but has seemingly failed to get off the ground, with series creator Michel Ancel unceremoniously departing the publisher in 2020. By all accounts the follow-up hasn’t been cancelled, but it’s hard to imagine it ever launching at this point.\n\nOn the subject of the original game, the ESRB notes of the new version: “This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a reporter accompanied by a pig-like companion investigating a conspiracy on the planet of Hillys. From a third-person perspective, players explore fantasy locations, take photos of evidence, solve puzzles, and fight robot and alien enemies.”"
