        "text": "Update [Wed 29th Nov, 2023 15:15 GMT]:\n\nWell, that didn't last long, did it?\n\nAfter Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition was accidentally listed on the Microsoft Store and briefly made available to Ubisoft+ subscribers, Ubisoft itself has now confirmed that it is indeed the real deal (shock).\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), it's been revealed that the updated game will arrive in 2024 with more news coming early in the year. The team has stated that it is dedicated to providing \"an experience that truly honors the legacy of the original\".\n\nSo there you have it! A Switch version hasn't been confirmed just yet, but we're pretty confident it will arrive on Nintendo's platform alongside PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.\n\nOriginal Article [Wed 29th Nov, 2023 00:45 GMT]:\n\nFollowing a rating earlier this year, evidence of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition has now surfaced once again, this time on Microsoft's store page. The game's achievements for this platform have also been discovered.\n\nUbisoft hasn't officially revealed this new game just yet, but at this point, it seems like there could be a surprise announcement and shadow drop in the near future. When the rating originally surfaced, Nintendo Switch was one of the many platforms listed.\n\nThe Microsoft Store page includes a number of images of the 20th Anniversary Edition as well as a description. There's no release date or price just yet, so perhaps we might hear something at The Game Awards, taking place next week on 7th December. Here's the full description of this new version of the game:\n\nSwoop into the marvelous world of Hillys as action-reporter Jade to investigate the mysterious DomZ alien attacks alongside colorful characters, like her adoptive uncle Peyâ€™j or the valiant Double H.\n\nEmbark on this epic adventure in up to 4K, 60 fps with improved graphics, controls, and audio, along with brand-new autosave and cross-save features.\n\nEnjoy exclusive new rewards as you explore the planet and discover more about Jadeâ€™s past in a new treasure hunt throughout Hillys.\n\nPut your skills to the test thanks to the new speedrun mode and updated achievements, and learn more about the gameâ€™s development and secrets in the anniversary gallery!\n\nArmed with her daÃ¯-jo and faithful camera, Jadeâ€™s adventure will get you to freely explore Hillys, combat creatures large and small, infiltrate dangerous areas, solve enigmatic puzzles, play addictive mini-games, race the best hovercraft pilots, and take pictures of the whole experience.\n\nBe ready to dive into a trailblazing blend of action gameplay and thrilling emotional cutscenes!"
