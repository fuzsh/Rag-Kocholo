        "text": "It appears that Ubisoft is gearing up to release a new edition of Beyond Good & Evil on Xbox to celebrate the game's 20th anniversary.\n\nSean Carey\n\nPublished 31 Aug 2023\n\nFollowtopics\n\nRumourXbox Series X|SSean Carey\n\nA newly-discovered listing reveals that the ESRB has rated a new edition of Beyond Good & Evil. According to the rating, Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC (thanks, MACOS380). As it stands, this new 20th anniversary edition has not yet been announced by Ubisoft.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition rated for Xbox Series X|S\n\n\"This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of a reporter accompanied by a pig-like companion investigating a conspiracy on the planet of Hillys,\" reads the rating. \"From a third-person perspective, players explore fantasy locations, take photos of evidence, solve puzzles, and fight robot and alien enemies. Combat is sometimes fast-paced, with players using melee weapons (e.g., staffs, torches) to strike stylized enemies that generally break apart or vanish into puffs of smoke. One boss battle depicts a squid-like alien stabbed in the eye, with yellow-green splatter effects.\"\n\nBeyond Good & Evil first launched on the original Xbox way back in 2003 before a HD version of the game was released in 2011 for the Xbox 360. This HD version is still playable via Xbox backwards compatibility.\n\nAs for Beyond Good and Evil 2, the last we heard about the sequel was that while the game was still in active development (despite being announced 15 years ago), its managing director had reportedly left the project.\n\nWritten by Sean Carey\n\nAvid Xbox and achievement fan, Sean has committed to playing the best RPGs, racing games, and first-person shooters Xbox Game Pass and his precious free time will allow. Prior to joining TrueAchievements, Sean gained a degree in journalism from Solent University.\n\nGet the biggest Xbox news delivered straight to your inbox every week.\n\nJoin"
