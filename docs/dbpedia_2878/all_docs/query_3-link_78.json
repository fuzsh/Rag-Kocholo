If you want to know why I feel this way, you can look for my review on it. This isn't about bugs, UI, controls or any of the other awkward and questionable design choices. Right now I just want to focus on the core game play. I spent 30 hours in EG2 doing my best to engage with the games mechanics and nearly called it quits.",
