        "text": "Beyond Good and Evil 2 hasn't stopped development yet, and despite a lack of evidence, it is still in the works at Ubisoft Montpellier.16 years since this upcoming action-adventure game was first announced in 2008, Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still kicking about. While there may not be a lot to talk about, we do know a few facts garnered from various blog posts and video breakdowns.\n\nCurrently, we do know that this upcoming action-adventure game will work as a prelude to the events that take place in the first game, released in 2003. The story largely revolved around Jade, an investigative reporter on a mission to expose a government conspiracy.\n\nAs of now, we have gathered every bit of detail we know about Beyond Good and Evil 2, so if you want to know more about the game, read on to see what's in store.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2: cut to the chase\n\nWhat is it? The sequel to 2003's action adventure Beyond and Evil\n\nWhat can I play it on? PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC\n\nWhen can I play it? TBC\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 - everything we know so far\n\nUbisoft hasn't confirmed when Beyond Good and Evil 2 will release or what platforms to expect it on. \"We’re just not there yet, and once we are, you’ll be the first to know\", Ubisoft devs said in a blog post back in 2020.\n\nIn an investor call in July 2021 (via GamesRadar), Ubisoft's chief financial officer, Frederick Duguet, wouldn't be drawn into providing a release window either. However, he did provide this statement: \"We are progressing well with Beyond Good and Evil 2, but it's too early to tell you more at this stage.\"\n\nIn June of 2024, Ubisoft confirmed a remaster of Beyond Good and Evil, which released June 25, 2024. The remaster comes with an extra quest line, which, according to the official website, ties into Beyond Good and Evil 2. This is the first time that Ubisoft has even mentioned the sequel in a long time, so the good news is that it's still clearly in the works in some respect. You can see the full quote below:\n\n\"Learn more about Jade's childhood and her link to Beyond Good & Evil 2 thanks to a new treasure hunt throughout Hillys! Collect exclusive cosmetic rewards as you progress through the game and explore the planet.\"\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 trailers\n\nIn June 2019, the development team behind Beyond Good and Evil 2 hosted a live stream to dish out new gameplay details and concept art.\n\nIt was explained that in the game, everyone in System 3 is a clone, while hybrids are made by crossing the DNA of humans and animals. Some of these hybrids are used as slaves in the mining and collecting of a valuable and dangerous mineral called Diwalite. You can watch a video of the stream below:\n\nWe've included some key Beyond Good and Evil 2 trailers throughout this article, but if you want to find more for yourself, then check out Ubisoft's official YouTube channel.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 story and setting\n\nThe first Beyond Good and Evil, released in 2003, follows photojournalist Jade's quest to investigate and uncover an alien conspiracy which leads to a grand and diverse adventure spanning stealth navigation, melee combat, puzzle solving, photography, and even racing.\n\nAt E3 2018, we attended a behind-closed-doors demo of Beyond Good and Evil 2, learning that it'll be a prequel with a younger Jade being the antagonist. The story will have new information on Jade, DomZ, and the origin of the human-animal hybrids. You can see the young nemesis for yourself in the cinematic trailer.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 gameplay\n\nIn the behind-closed-doors demo of Beyond Good and Evil 2 we attended in 2018, we were told that Beyond Good and Evil 2 will allow you to play co-operatively in an open world that is astonishingly large and utterly seamless. You'll be able to move from city streets to the sky, to space to outer space without any loading screens at all.\n\nFrom the off, you'll have a melee weapon, a gun, a shield, and a jetpack, which can be modified with interesting augments. One key item is the spyglass which players can use to assess situations before going into them. Hovering over an enemy will tell you more about them, what augments they're using, and their abilities. It should certainly make planning an attack a lot more smooth.\n\nFurthermore, the environment will be somewhat destructible, allowing parts of buildings to be demolished. Real-time meteor showers will be able to impact entire portions of planets which could potentially trigger missions and story events.\n\nHowever, given these details were shared six years ago and Ubisoft hasn't provided an update on the game since 2020, it's likely that some of these elements may change in the final product.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 FAQ\n\nWhen was Beyond Good and Evil 2 first announced?\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 was first mentioned during a UbiDays event all the way back in 2008. Then, it wasn't until E3 2017 that we saw anything substantial. A trailer was shown off, which was seriously impressive, though did little to explain what the game actually was at the time. Since then, Ubisoft has only really made brief mentions to Beyond Good and Evil 2.\n\nHas Beyond Good and Evil 2 been cancelled?\n\nNo, Beyond Good and Evil 2 has not been cancelled. While it was first revealed back in 2008, it got something of a re-reveal in 2017. Still, it has been a very long time since we saw anything substantial from the game. Ubisoft actually mentioned the sequel alongside the June 2024 release of the Beyond Good and Evil Remaster, so for now, the game is still in the works.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil 2 news\n\nA brand new game engine\n\nBack in 2017, Ubisoft revealed in an update video that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is being built in the new Voyager game engine in order to capture creator Michel Ancel's vision for the game and create a world as large as Beyond Good and Evil 2's intends to be.\n\nEmile Morel, the creative director for Beyond Good and Evil 2 has died\n\nThe creative director of Beyond Good and Evil 2's death was first reported by colleagues who took to LinkedIn (via IGN). \"A cherished colleague for over a decade at Ubisoft Montpellier, we laughed and wept through good times and bad, and shipped a lot [of] great games together,\" former Beyond Good and Evil 2 narrative director M. Gabreille Shrager wrote.\n\nYou Might Also Like..."
