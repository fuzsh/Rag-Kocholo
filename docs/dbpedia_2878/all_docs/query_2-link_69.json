        "text": "We just reported a couple of weeks ago that Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition PlayStation Trophy data had been spotted, hinting at some kind of update on the game’s launch, or better yet an imminent release. It seems fans will be getting the latter, as Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition will be launching on Nintendo Switch tomorrow, June 25, 2024. Here’s the launch trailer:\n\nFor whatever reason, Ubisoft has been incredibly cagey about the launch of Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition. First there were multiple leaks that the game was inbound, then Ubisoft made the official announcement in January of 2023, and then nothing else for a year. Then the Trophy data link happened and Ubisoft put out a post on X saying 06.25.24 is the launch date… only to then delete the post! The company then published the above trailer on its YouTube channel, so we’re going to go out on a limb and assume that yes, the wait is finally over and you’ll be guiding Jade and friends through their adventure once more.\n\nIf things change, we’ll be sure to let you all know. In the meanwhile, let us know if you’re excited to play Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition down in the comments!"
