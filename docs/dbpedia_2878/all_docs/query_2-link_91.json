        "text": "Two absolutely wonderful games from PS2 Ubi who were on fire during the early 2000's with these two games, Rayman and Splinter Cell.\n\nI went through both BG&E and SoT relatively recently, so I'm a bit of a newer fan, but I had an amazing time with both games and yearn for more games like them.\n\nNo other game captures the curious and exploratory nature of Beyond Good and Evil. The way you uncover more and more about the story, the characters being extremely likeable and well-written despite their short screen time, everything about BG&E just screams instant classic. Jade is still one of my favourite character designs out there and it's a huge shame Ubisoft's gone the route they've gone with for the sequel, if it ever ends up coming out. There were rumours of a 20th anniversary edition coming out, but that's probably not happening at this point.\n\nSpeaking of sequels and weird routes, the Sands of Time is no slouch either. An incredibly cinematic game for 2003, you go through an Arabian Nights inspired adventure that truly feels like a full-on journey, with the wear and tear showing on the Prince the further into the game you get. Combine the atmosphere with the amazing parkour system, and a rewind feature(!), and you've got one of the quintessential PS2 games that any action-adventure fan should play. Of course, the PoP series is thankfully still alive, with The Lost Crown coming out later this year, though this game was supposed to get a remake that might have ended up in development hell.\n\nSo, how does everyone else feel about these games in 2023? Do they hold up, or should they stay in the past?\n\nBoth games hold up really well (Though BG&E better than Sands of Time).\n\nSome of my absolute favorites. A shame the SoT Remake and BGE2 are basically vaporware now\n\nIn regards to PoP specifically, one of my favorite things about it is how well it nails being \"an adventure\".\n\nIt reminds me a lot of RE4 where from the start to the end, you really felt like you were truly seeing how all of this was playing out in real-time.\n\nIn regards to PoP specifically, one of my favorite things about it is how well it nails being \"an adventure\".\n\nIt reminds me a lot of RE4 where from the start to the end, you really felt like you were truly seeing how all of this was playing out in real-time.\n\nYup! One of my faavourite things too. The Prince from the beginning is a different Prince than the one at the end, both in terms of character and visually, with him looking less like royalty and more like someone who's gone through a lot of shid.\n\nBeyond Good & Evil is still one of my favorite games. It was so cool being able to snap photos of the wildlife.\n\nOne of my favourite parts of the game! I love how well it ties into the game's narrative as well, it's not just taking photos of animals because it's a cool mechanic.\n\nAgree for Mechner, but for Ancel don't forget that after the 2020 revelations the best that can be said about his work ethic is \"at least he didn't sexually harass his employees\" so I'm fine with his retiring.\n\nYeah I figured this would get pointed out. I certainly also wish he was a better person while he was working and that his response to those allegations was to self reflect as opposed to go on the defensive, but I can feel that and also be sad to lose him as a creative force in the industry.\n\nAny more news\n\nI really liked BG&E. I've been holding off on a replay because of the rumored?/leaked? 20th anniversary edition but uh... well... where is it Ubisoft??\n\nyeah was just gonna ask if anybody had heard more news on that\n\nBeyond Good and Evil remastered leaked ahead of the series' 20th anniversary\n\nA new Beyond Good and Evil game is potentially arriving in the near future, however, it's not the game that fans might be hoping for.\n\nIs the sands of time remake still a thing? Was it ever officially cancelled? Wasn't it supposed to release like 3 years ago? 🤕\n\nIt's supposedly still in development but under a different studio. The one Ubisoft Pune developed (the one we've seen trailers for) is all but cancelled, though weirdly enough the trophies for it were made public a long time ago. Ubisoft Montreal's taken over so hopefully it looks a bit better than the Pune one. With Lost Crown coming out in two month, I think we're not getting any updates until late next year at the earliest.\n\nHuge fan of BG&E. That OST is one of my favorite soundtracks from a video game ever too. It sounded like it belonged on the Chrono Cross OST.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/jTdcJWDNsao?si=__55zCkYBswtIK-h\n\nView: https://youtu.be/6jl84Sj4nCM?si=dGCHZiO7NElKfRGd\n\nOh I love the OST. Don't forget the best song on the OST though:\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxKBCLPP20s\n\nSands of Time is one of my favourite videogames.\n\nI was planning on creating a thread to celebrate the game's anniversary on 10th, but kinda forgot... lol\n\nThe soundtrack for SoT was phenomenal imo.\n\nI loved the SoT OST. The mix of eastern & western instruments, especially when combat starts. The soundtrack definitely contributed to that overall Arabian adventure feel of the game. Wish they didn't do a hard 90 with Warrior Within though.\n\nI'm listening to the BG&E soundtrack again and I don't know how it's possible to feel that nostalgic for a game I played two years ago. Both games genuinely have amazing OSTs.\n\nHmm, I don't know much about Beyond Good & Evil but isn't there a remaster or remake coming out for this game? If not maybe I can pick it up sometime.\n\nI've been wanting to play some old games lately.\n\nThere was supposed to be a port for the 20th anniversary but I think that got quietly killed. It still holds up pretty well on the PS3, so I assume the Steam version also holds up well enough to play in 2023. It's also only $9.99, and as far as old games go, there's not a lot like this one.\n\nThere was supposed to be a port for the 20th anniversary but I think that got quietly killed.

It's also only $9.99, and as far as old games go, there's not a lot like this one.\n\nThe steam version isn't the HD version unfortunately. It's the original PC port and requires a decent amount of modding to make it run properly. Unless someone's up for modding, I probably wouldn't recommend that version. Ps360 HD edition is definitely the best way to play it in 2023\n\nDo any of the pc versions of bge actually work on modern systems without graphical glitches?\n\nI personally had no major issues with the uplay version (even had controller support) but I might have had to disable a setting or two in the options menu to stop some weird flickering artifacts.\n\nThat said to get things up to modern standards I installed a quick drag and drop widescreen mod which also enabled higher resolutions iirc. This was at 60 fps/60hz fixed refresh rate 1080p. I think there are issues introduced above 60hz.\n\nI'm always a bit surprised by the claims that it needs a lot of modding, perhaps this varies by launcher and with PC hardware but I've never really had issues on the last 3 or 4 PCs I've tried it on."
