Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition marks a significant milestone for one of gaming’s most beloved cult classics. Originally released in 2003, this action-adventure game quickly gained a dedicated fan base thanks to its unique blend of storytelling, exploration, and engaging gameplay. You step into the shoes of Jade, a photojournalist fighting against an oppressive regime on the planet Hillys. With its captivating narrative and memorable characters, Beyond Good & Evil set a high bar for creativity in the industry.

Now, two decades later, Ubisoft has remastered this iconic title, bringing it to modern platforms with enhanced visuals and new content. The 20th Anniversary Edition not only revitalizes the graphics but also adds a brand-new quest that connects to the long-awaited sequel, Beyond Good & Evil 2. This remaster introduces Jade’s adventure to a new generation while rekindling the nostalgia for longtime fans.

As we dive deeper into this review, we’ll explore how the remaster holds up against the test of time. Does it still capture the magic that made it a classic? Let’s find out!

Uncover new lore and adventures

Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition revisits the captivating narrative of the original 2003 game while introducing new elements that enhance the overall experience. You take on the role of Jade, a photojournalist working for the IRIS Network, as she seeks to uncover the dark conspiracy orchestrated by the Alpha Sections, who are secretly collaborating with the DomZ to kidnap the inhabitants of the world of Hillys.

The story unfolds through a series of engaging missions where you use stealth and investigative skills to gather evidence against the oppressive regime. The game’s story is filled with twists and turns, which kept me glued to the screen throughout the campaign. Characters, including Jade’s uncle Pey’j and Double H, contribute to the story’s depth, with meaningful interactions that provide insight into their personalities and motivations.

A significant addition is a brand-new questline that connects to the highly anticipated sequel. This treasure hunt allows you to explore Jade’s backstory and her relationship with her mother, unlocking new hand-drawn and voiced cutscenes that deepen the narrative. This connection to the sequel not only enriches the original story but also gets me even more excited for the future of the franchise.

While the core narrative remains intact, the new content offers fresh perspectives on Jade’s character and her journey, making it an interesting and worthwhile experience. Overall, I feel that Ubisoft did a really good job blending nostalgia with new content.

The gameplay is a blend of action, stealth, and puzzle-solving. Emphasis is placed on investigation over combat, requiring you to take photographs of conspiracies and collect items, adding depth to the experience.

With its upgraded visuals and audio, Beyond Good & Evil: 20th Anniversary Edition makes Hillys even more appealing. Additionally, Ubisoft has updated the game’s controls. This provides smoother navigation and more responsive combat. A quality of life improvement that I very much appreciated. This allows you to engage with the game’s mechanics more easily. An autosave feature has been added, which replaces the original’s manual save points. This welcomed addition now allows you to focus on the action without worrying about losing your progress.

However, there are some gameplay aspects even in this remastered version that show their age. First, combat can feel clunky. The game’s one-button system for combos and a lack of a lock-on feature can really put a hamper in combat. Second, camera angles can get frustrating, especially during intense moments. This sometimes leads to not having a clear view of what’s going on, which is particularly important during stealth sections. Finally, the AI of both Pey’j and Double H can be inconsistent. This leads to annoying situations such as when they get stuck on walls or fail to follow you during critical moments.

Despite these issues, the game successfully combines nostalgia with new content, making it a worthwhile revisit for both new and returning players. And, the game’s unique storytelling and exploration ensuring its status as a classic in gaming history.

The visuals and soundscape of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition

Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition’s visuals breathe new life into the game. The remastered graphics have improved textures, shadows, and lighting. The colourful art style, remains true to the original while feeling fresh and modern. The game’s visual overhaul makes exploring even more enjoyable.

The sound design is just as impressive. The remastered musical score retains the spirit of the original game while enhancing the overall atmosphere. The music fits seamlessly with the gameplay, drawing you deeper into Jade’s adventure. Plus, the sound effects have been refined, adding more depth to both the combat and exploration experiences.

The voice acting in Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is definitely a highlight. The talented voice actors bring the characters to life, delivering their lines with genuine emotion and authenticity. Jade’s voice, in particular, makes her journey feel personal and engaging. The dialogue flows smoothly, helping you to connect with the story and its characters on a deeper level. Overall, the presentation of Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is a testament to the care and attention Ubisoft has given to this classic title.

Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is a fitting tribute to a game that has stood the test of time

Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition is an excellent remaster. The game retains its charm, giving you a chance to revisit the vibrant world of Hillys. The enhanced visuals and revamped audio breathe new life into the experience, making it more enjoyable for both new players and veterans alike. The addition of behind-the-scenes content and a new questline connecting to Beyond Good & Evil 2 adds extra value.

However, the game does show its age in some areas. The combat can feel clunky, and the camera angles can be frustrating at times during intense moments. Some visual effects, like smoke and holograms, appear outdated compared to modern games.

Despite these drawbacks, the core elements that made Beyond Good & Evil a classic remain intact. The engaging story, memorable characters, and unique gameplay mechanics continue to shine. While it may not fully capture the magic of its original release, it still offers a nostalgic journey worth taking. For fans of the original and those who are new, this remaster serves as a fitting tribute to a game that has stood the test of time.
