        "text": "From the author of Perdido Street Station, an epic and breathtaking fantasy of extraordinary imagination\n\nA colossal fantasy of incredible diversity and spellbinding imagination. A human cargo bound for servitude in exileâ¦\n\nA pirate city hauled across the oceansâ¦\n\nA hidden miracle about be revealedâ¦\n\nThese are the ingredients of an astonishing story. It is the story of a prisonerâs journey. Of the search for the island of a forgotten people, for the most astonishing beast in the seas, and ultimately for a fabled place - a massive wound in reality, a source of unthinkable power and danger.\n\nPRAISE FOR CHINA MIEVILLE\n\n[Mievilleâs] wit dazzles, his humour is lively, and the pure vitality of his imagination is astonishing. Ursula K. Le Guin, The Guardian (on Three Moments of an Explosion)\n\nDark and thought-provoking. The San Diego Union-Tribune (on The City & The City)\n\nRichly conceived. The New York Times Book Review (on Embassytown)\n\nMieville more than delivers. San Francisco Chronicle (on Kraken)\n\nCompulsively readable. The Washington Post Book World (on Perdido Street Station)"
