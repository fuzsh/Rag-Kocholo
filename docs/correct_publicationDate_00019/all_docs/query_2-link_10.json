        "text": "Mountain in the Sea 🔗\n\nby Ray Nayler\n\nFinished on 04/05/2023\n\nFun to read this against the backdrop of GPT3/GPT4! I enjoyed the book but found it kind of fizzled out at the end. I was hoping it was going to work towards some kind of crescendo but found the ending just kind of weak. But I still enjoyed the read.\n\nPopisho 🔗\n\nby Leone Ross\n\nFinished on 09/21/2022\n\nWhat a magical lush book. Ugly, raw, squelchy. The opposite of the Ruth Ozeki book I just read... Popisho is full of exquisite descriptions, magical realism, surreal nonsense and raw, bloody, colorful magic. Full of gods and humans at their best and worst I absolutely loved this book. If you're looking for something that is a riot of color, emotion and humanity then this is it.\n\nThe Book of Form and Emptiness 🔗\n\nby Ruth Ozeki\n\nFinished on 08/28/2022\n\nWhile at times Ruth Ozeki's writing is lyrical and magical, mostly this book felt kind of sterile. Neither of the main characters feel deeply explored and the most interesting characters (the aleph and the bottleman) are really only side events. Overall the book tasted like it had been aged in steel barrels and I was left wanting something more full bodied, more lyrical, more vivid.\n\nAssassin's Fate 🔗\n\nby Robin Hobb\n\nFinished on 06/11/2022\n\nOof. That concludes reading all 16 of the realm of the elderlings books. I haven't kept detailed notes on them but I'm so glad that I read them all and read them in order. In many ways Nighteyes is the main character. These last three books tie together so many threads and loose ends - the storyline is dark but the ending is magical. Robin Hobb has such a powerful command of both small characters and giant worlds.\n\nA Memory Called Empire 🔗\n\nby Arkady Martine\n\nFinished on 02/10/2021\n\nWhat richness! The first time I've read sci-fi that felt a bit like Iain M Banks. Deep, complex, rich worlds with strong characters. An absolute treat - spanning langauge, poetry, politics, identity, memory and more. I cannot wait for the followup. After reading so much poorly written sci fi recently (Dune, The Ministry of the Future, Exhalation..) this was a refreshing breath of fresh air.\n\nExhalation 🔗\n\nby Ted Chiang\n\nFinished on 01/04/2021\n\nAbandoned 2/3 of the way through :( - while I quite enjoyed some of the provocations in the stories ultimately the writing didn't captivate me. Left me feeling bored so I gave it up.\n\nThe Player of Games 🔗\n\nby Iain M. Banks\n\nFinished on 12/01/2020\n\nI have fond memories of the first time reading this and felt like it left a big impression on me. Re-reading this book I still loved it but the shine has come off a little - I think other culture books are perhaps better. Still, the world building (universe building!) that Iain M Banks does is like no other.\n\nEast of Eden 🔗\n\nby John Steinbeck\n\nFinished on 07/29/20\n\nWhat a magnificent - truly epic work. I'm a big Steinbeck fan already and I think I even read this one previously but loved immersing myself in this wonderful story. The biblical theme is almost too strong at times but is richly counterbalanced by Steinbeck's incredibly loving character portraits. Amazing.\n\nThe Memory Police 🔗\n\nby Yoko Ogawa\n\nFinished on 05/17/20\n\nWhile the writing style at times is captivating - like a penny falling into a deep well - often the writing was unremarkable and the plot unfolded fairly slowly. All in the book was, ironically, forgettable. That said - the ending, where bodies start to fade away really resonated during this period of lockdown and isolation - it captures the essence of my embodied self fading away into an infinite series of zoom screens.\n\nA Winter’s Promise 🔗\n\nby Christelle Dabos\n\nFinished on 12/30/19\n\nThere are moments when the lavish fantasy world and the magic contained in it sucked me in - but ultimately the character development and plot just didn't hang together to keep me reading. Good escapist reading but there are better fantasy worlds to lose yourself in than this one.\n\nInfinite Detail 🔗\n\nby Tim Maughan\n\nFinished on 12/1/19\n\nA fun quick read. There's some good language and some nice world-setting but I wish some of the characters had been more fully developed and I wish the central idea had been stronger. The ending kind of fizzles out and there could have been room for so much more here.. Good for a little lightweight-dytopia though.\n\nDead Astronauts 🔗\n\nby Jeff VanderMeer\n\nFinished on 11/15/19\n\nI think perhaps I made a mistake. I didn't realize until after I'd read it that it was part of the Borne series. Maybe that would have been useful because this book made zero sense. Like a William Burroughs book it was somehow interesting and riveting at times despite literally making no sense. Did I mention it makes no sense? The first section with the three astronauts was the most compelling..... Maybe I should read the other Borne books and it'll make more sense? But I doubt it.\n\nThe Nix 🔗\n\nby Nathan Hill\n\nFinished on 10/28/19\n\nAbandoned 500 pages in. I tried to keep going but just couldn't. A Very Bad Book. Highly un-recommended. This is a good takedown. So many characters are badly written sexually frustrated males and it's just all round a bad book. Couple sentences worth savoring but.. ugh.\n\nA Gentleman in Moscow 🔗\n\nby Amor Towles\n\nFinished on 10/03/19\n\nAmor is a wonderful writer with so many lyrical touches, flourishes and turns of phrase. The feel of the book of politics, culture and acting in the proper way is great. Without posting spoilers there's a few themes in the book that make me feel like the book was written by a man - that some of the more emotionally rich moments are skipped over... But overall highly recommended as a fun, engaging and lyrical book.\n\nTempo - timing, tactics and strategy in narrative-driven decision-making 🔗\n\nby Venkatesh Rao\n\nFinished on 09/09/19\n\nI really should have read this years ago but I really enjoyed this piece. The core ideas around tempo of interactions, narrative time and that the kitchen is the best way to think about time will all stick with me for a while. Recommended.\n\nConversation - How Talk Can Change Our Lives 🔗\n\nby Theodore Zeldin\n\nFinished on 09/04/19\n\nA delightful little book that was a gift from my friend Brian. A little meditation on conversations, how important they are and some of the explicit and implicit ways they can go wrong. At first I thought this was going to offer solutions and ideas but mostly it just offers poetry and provocations. I think it'll stick with me for a long time though - and the art from the author scattered through the book makes a lovely little object. Thanks Brian!\n\nRecursion 🔗\n\nby Blake Crouch\n\nFinished on 9/3/19\n\nA fast-paced, high-action read. A fun time-travel romp with some great characters. Ultimately I thought the premise was smart and the writing handled it well but the whole novel felt a little shallow. There were some really meaty ideas about identity and family wrapped up here that kind of got sidelined for the sake of the technology-driven plot and I thought that was a shame. Fun read though.\n\nIdiots First 🔗\n\nby Bernard Malamud\n\nFinished on 8/15/19\n\nThe opening line of Idiot's First is a masterpiece. 'The thin ticking of the tin clock stopped'. Loved a few of the other stories but some were definitely forgettable. I'd recommend dipping your toe in and at the very least reading the title story Idiots First.\n\nThe Scar 🔗\n\nby China Miéville\n\nFinished on 08/06/19\n\nAh what delicious sludgy, dark, human texture. China Miéville's descriptive language and world building is unparalleled. This is book two (after reading Perdido Street Station last year). These books are long and luxurious so perhaps not the best entry point if you're new to his writing but if you like this kind of thing there's nothing better. My only quarrel with this book was the ending... It felt somewhat unsatisfying, or rather unfinished - where a typical book resolves this felt like the open sea was still in front of you? But it's a very minor comment as mostly the strength of this book was that every page told a lifetime of texture. Definitely going to read book three of this trilogy after a break.\n\nLast Night 🔗\n\nby James Salter\n\nFinished on 07/14/19\n\nAfter reading All That Is I had to wash my palette and get back to some of his delicious writing. This was much more in line with Light Years and contained some lovely moments. None of the short stories will linger with me too long but it's a short read and I'd recommend it.\n\nEmissaries Guide to Worlding 🔗\n\nby Ian Cheng\n\nFinished on 7/8/19\n\nThe core idea of the masks - the cartoonist, the director, the hacker and the emissary - is wonderful and a new lens to look at the world through, so overall I'd recommend the book. But there was also an incredible over-indulgence from the author to live inside his own worlds (which feels very finite game like, not infinite game like). And the lack of people anywhere in his worlds is also problematic. That said - the book as an object is beautiful and wonderfully designed.\n\nThe Prisoner 🔗\n\nby Thomas M. Disch\n\nFinished on 7/7/19\n\nI really enjoyed this - a delightfully British story of being trapped, like a combination of Kafka and PG Wodehouse. The plot derailed itself in a few places and there was a whole Shakespere reference that kind of went over my head but the writing was wonderful. Recommended.\n\nOval 🔗\n\nby Elvia Wilk\n\nFinished on 6/24/19\n\nI really loved this. Distinctive, fresh writing that captures so much of the present weirdness in society while also somehow feeling timeless. The middle third dragged slightly for me but the descent into ecological weird towards the end is just wonderful and reminds me of the Annihiliation series by Jeff Vandermeer. Oh and the whole book centers on this premise of artists becoming 'consultants' which is magnificent. Recommended. Verdict- 👍🌲\n\nAll That Is 🔗\n\nby James Salter\n\nFinished on 06/09/2019\n\nA wildly disappointing read. Not that it was so bad but that having recently read Light Years I was expecting so much more. There were moments of brilliance in the writing and some of the scenes will linger with me overall the book didn't really make me feel anything. Definitely read Light Years instead.\n\nThe Gone Away World 🔗\n\nby Nick Harkaway\n\nFinished on 5/07/2019\n\nA majestic feat of imagination - whirlwind story of a gong-fu epic in a world gone mad. Definitely feels like it needed better editing or structuring and was about 100 pages too long but the strength of imagination and grasp of poetry really captivated me. Picked this up off the street on the way home from kung-fu training (approriate!). I'll be reading more of his work.\n\nLight Years 🔗\n\nby James Salter\n\nFinished on 4/12/2019\n\nThis book completely destroyed me. The writing is dense and poetic like almost no one I've ever read. Did you know glass is a liquid and slowly 'flows'? This book operates on a time horizon and 'flows' through lives in a deeply transformative way. Found via Phil Gyford\n\nDelirious New York 🔗\n\nby Rem Koolaas\n\nFinished on 3/18/2019\n\nIt's architecture writing but lyrical, magical and opinionated. A tour de force through New York's history with tons of interesting characters, ideas, explorations and more. Ideas include congestion as an organizing principle of the city, and every block being an archipelago. Wonderful and highly recommended.\n\nTomorrow In The Battle Think On Me 🔗\n\nby Javier Marias\n\nFinished on 2/17/2019\n\nAbandoned. I think somewhere in this book is buried a wonderful treasure. The looping self-aware story is fundamentally interesting and new but the language that wraps around it chokes it to death. Abandoned about half way through.\n\nThe Power 🔗\n\nby Naomi Alderman\n\nFinished on 12/30/2018\n\nProvocative premise but I felt it squandered an opportunity at a deeper political and/or emotional exploration of what would happen if teenage girls gained a new incredible power. Somehow it resorted to.... fucking and fighting?"
