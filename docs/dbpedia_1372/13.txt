CBID is the Chuck Berry International Directory, a 2.200 page pile of Chuck Berry records information published in four volumes between 2008 and 2013. For details see the bibliography section of this site.

CBID is never complete as new records and CDs appear and some old rarities are discovered. This section presents interesting additions and corrections to CBID.

Today: The more you browse the Internet, the more cover versions you find. Here's another list of artists and band playing Chuck Berry's music. This time all new entries start with the letter M [continued]

MADHOUSE (Sweden)

Early ‘80s rock band produced by a.o. Dr. John and Willy DeVille. Members: Anders Kraft, Bengt Kirschon, Björn Gideonsson, Christian Falk and Gabbe Gabrielsson.

Nadine (4:10) 1982

12” EP: Private Hell 36 [Sound Of Scandinavia SOSM-1136] ● Sweden, 1982

MARCE & CHEMA (Spain)

Latino pop duo with a little rock in them. They usually sing in Spanish but I haven’t heard the Berry medley so I can’t verify.

Rockmania medley: Johnny B. Goode / Carol / Memphis, Tennessee / Nadine / Roll Over Beethoven / Rock And Roll Music (8:30) 1979

LP: Ganador [Reflejo 10C 062-062.888] ● Spain, 1979 (promo)

LASSE MÅRTENSON (Finland)

Lars Anders Fredrik Mårtenson, popsinger, songwriter, musician and actor, born 1934 in Helsinki. His first single came out in 1962, and many more followed. Several albums since 1966. He died in 2016.

LP: Lasse [RCA Victor LPM-10071] ● Finland, 1966

MARTÒ & THE JUDAS (Italy)

Giancarlo Martelli, pop/rock singer. Seems like he had a great hit in Italy with “Hey Joe” in 1967. Performed in Italian.

Bye Bye Johnny [as “Bie Bie Johnny!!!”] (1:40) 1966

LP: Lost And Found [Discoverix DSX-33001] Italy, 1991

Limited edition 500 copies. Previously unissued. I am always skeptical to such short versions. It’s almost over before it starts.

MAYBERRIES (UK)

Rock sextet based in Mayfield, East Sussex fronted by lead singer John Murray. They play rock’n’roll, blues and soul and are gigging in Mayfield and the surrounding area. They recorded some demo tracks back in July 2018.

Little Queenie (3:22) 2022

70th Jubilee Edition for streaming on all platforms and a special You Tube video

Yes I know, this is not the way this list usually goes. But this was recorded to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The video was produced incorporating classic photographs and clips from the queen’s reign and artwork by local primary school children. And best of all, 100 per cent of the proceeds from the song will go to help seriously ill children from across the UK treated at Great Osmond Street Hospital.

PETE MacDONALD & THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN (Canada)

Country music singer, songwriter and guitarist from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Leader of The Country Gentlemen.

Memphis, Tennessee [as “Memphis”] (2.17) 1968

LP: Pete MacDonald And The Country Gentlemen [Rodeo Int. SRLP-7112] ● Canada, 1968

Recorded at Stereo Sound Studios, Montreal, P.Q. One side is instrumental and one side vocals (“Memphis”).

ALI McGREGOR (Australia)

Run Rudolph Run (3:22) 2015

CD: A Very Jazzamatazz Christmas [ABC Music (Universal) 4729008 ] ● Australia, 2015

Can’t say it sounded so very jazzy (unfortunately) despite featuring a horn section. More like a “soul” version except her voice is not.

MEDECIN’E (France)

Rock’n’roll quartet.

Beautiful Delilah (2:06) 2004

I’m Talking About You [as “Talkin’ Bout You”] (2:21) 2004

Nadine (3:55) 2004

CD: Rock Therapy [Caducée Records CD-004] ● France, 2004

They also do “Route 66” credited to Chuck Berry(!), sorry Bobby.

Run Rudolph Run (2:36) 2000

CD: Mek & The X.Mas Peks [Kick Music KICKCD-118] ● Denmark, 2000

A little heavy rockabilly rendition of this classic.

EDDIE MESA With THE HI-JACKS (Philippines)

Eduardo de Mesa Eigenmann was born in 1940. As Eddie Mesa he’s known as a Filipino singer and actor. He was at a time famous as “the Elvis Presley of the Philippines” because of his impersonation of the man. Later on he moved to the USA and eventually saw the light...

Roll Over Beethoven (2:21) 1970

45: Scoop Records SP-116 ● Philippines, 1970

RAPHAEL MEYNER & The Sleep Workers (West Germany)

Roll Over Beethoven ( : ) 1971

45: Life Records St 71 310 ● West Germany, 1971

It’s not easy when you find absolutely nothing about this artist on the net.

MIKO (Japan)

Mieko Hirota, female singer who was born in Tokyo 1947, died in 2020. She was very popular and regarded as a dynamic and great singer. Her first album came in 1961 and she’s had a lot of them throughout the years.

Rock And Roll Music ( : ) 1971

2-LP: Rock Rock [Columbia JPW-37-38] ● Japan, 1971

Not sure if she sings in English or Japanese on this one.

MIRABELLO 3 (Italy)

Pop trio, one girl, two boys. But they have additional musicians on board.

Rock And Roll Music [Italian lyrics] (2:28) 1977

LP: Chi Porta Giù Questo Cane? [Intingo ITLM-14501] ● Italy, 1977

MIRROR IMAGE ( USA)

Back In The USA (2:54) 1980

LP: Performs The Songs Of Linda Ronstadt [Pickwick SPC-3745] ● USA, 1980

The more correct title here would have been Performs The Hits Of … Anyway, if you look at the entry by Platinum Players on this blog performing Back In The USA, released on a Pickwick LP in ’79, it wouldn’t surprise me if it is actually the same version. Although I don’t know for sure as I haven’t heard either one. Do I really have to?

MISSING MOONLIGHTERS (USA)

Actually called The Moonlighters, who had an album out in 1977 and another in 1983. Country-rock group, led by vocalist and guitarist Bill Kirchen (page 1292).

Let It Rock (3:36) mid 1980s (live)

Oh What A Thrill (4:05) mid 1980s (live)

2-CD: Live / Studio Closet Tapes [Globe Records GLO-037] ● USA, 2008

All tracks are previously unissued. The studio ones were recorded at various places in California. And the live ones? Well it was recorded at various night clubs in the San Francisco Bay area, but nothing is mentioned when it happened? Irritating. However, “Let It Rock” is a good country-rock version with solid bass and beat and after 2 minutes with an interesting interlude. “Oh What A Thrill” works just as good. You can listen to the entire album on You Tube.

MISSING SOULS (France)

Beat/soul band from Lyon. Ian Kapoudjian (guitar, vocals), Ricky Bilbao (organ, bass), Zaza Sharps (vocals, bass, tambourine), Lester Mizzi (drums).

I’m Talking About You (2:02) 2015

LP/CD: The Missing Souls [Dangerhouse Skylab DSL-009] ● France, 2016

ELIZABETH MITCHELL (USA)

Multi-instrumentalist, it seems she plays any kind of everything with a sound to it. Looking at the amount of musicians who participated on the album below, it would probably take a page. The whole album is aimed at children.

School Day (3:43) 2006-2009

CD: Sunny Day [Smithsonian Folkways SFW CD-45064] ● USA, 2010

Recorded 2006–2009 at On-Me Sound, Mount Tremper, New York. The vocals on the Berry track is by Charlotte Constan. She’s also singing on “Mystery Train”, the other only rock’n’roll song included on the album. Good education for children nevertheless.

MOHAIR SWEETS (Canada)

Colin Bryce, singer, songwriter, keyboardist, guitarist. Russ Kroeker ( bass) and Greg Gardner (drums). Bryce is regarded as being punk-rocker from the late ‘70s and from 1997-2007 the man behind Mohair Sweets print and webzine. As far as I can tell they have five CD EPs out from 2014-2018.

You Never Can Tell ( : ) 2017

CD EP: The Ronnie Lane Tribute EP [Mohair Sweets Mohair #03] ● Canada, 2017

Well, Ronnie Lane himself did perform this song on almost all of his concerts, so people connected to his music think it is a proper choice to include this Berry classic. (See Ronnie Lane on page 1305)

MONTE CARLOS (USA)

Country-rock quintet, Billy Cioffi (vocals, guitars), Michael Clark (vocals, keyboards), Philip Krawzak (saxophone), Will MacGregor (bass), Kirk Arthur Trachsel (drums).

You Can’t Catch Me (3:24) 1994

CD: Monte Carlos [B.T. Puppy Records BTP-055222-2] ● USA, 1994

MONTROSE (USA)

1970s hard rock band from California led by founding member Ronnie Montrose. They had four albums out on Warner Bros. from 1973 to 1976.

Roll Over Beethoven (3:39) 1974

2-CD: Paper Money [Warner Brothers R2 557788] ● USA, 2017 (DeLuxe Edition)

CD 1 is the original “Paper Money” LP from 1974. CD 2 contains a previously unissued (incl. R.O.B.) KSAN Radio Session, Record Plant, Sausalito, California, 26 December 1974.

MOODY BROTHERS (USA)

We already have this group on the blog, however, I have added this new cover.

Run Rudolph Run (2:43) 1987

CD: Home For The Holidays [Intersound Digital CHD-1502] ● Canada, 1991

Recorded at Lamon Sound Studios, Charlotte, North Carolina in October 1987.

GARY MOORE (UK)

See Volume 3, page 1373 for biographical info.

Thirty Days (3:15) 2007 (live)

CD: Live At Bush Hall 2007 [Eagle Records ER-203672] ● USA, 2014

This album was released all over EU, Australia and Japan. Later re-issued in EU on a 2-LP set in 2019. I like this live version better than the studio one.

R. STEVIE MOORE (USA)

Robert Steven Moore, born 1952 in Nashville. Son of Bob Moore, the famous studio bass player. Stevie is sometimes called the Godfather of Home Recording and one of the most recognized of the cassette underground. Rumor has it that he has

recorded around 400 (yes four hundred) self-released albums, but also several albums released on various labels (mostly compilations).

Havana Moon (3:03) 2016

CD: Lids & Blankets: A Covers Collection Vol.1 [Stevie Moore self-released] ● USA, 2016

Ok, but a little predictable and boring.

MOTIFS (UK)

Obscure Liverpool beat group active on Merseyside during the 1960s. A trio formed by former members of The Del Renas.

All Aboard ( : ) 1963

Various CD: Beat Waves ‘Cross The Mersey Vol. 2 [Merseyside Records Me-1002] ● UK, 2012

Previously unissued. Recorded 1963, so this will have to be the very first cover of this rather obscure Berry song, first available on the “Chuck Berry On Stage” album that came out in England October 1963.
