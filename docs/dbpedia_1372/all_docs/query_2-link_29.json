        "text": "Articles > Names\n\nVanhat nimityyppimme (Finnish Names)\n\nby Rouva Gertrud\n\nI Preface\n\nThis work is a revised translation of my paper Suomen nimet, which was originally published as #8 in the series Lastuja Aarnimetsästä. This series is the Finnish equivalent of Compleat Anachronist. The list of names is more or less the same in both works, but I have added an ultra short course of Finnish for this international version.\n\nThe basic purpose of this work was to aid documentation, therefore I have included only those names I have personally found from the original sources given in section IV. During my research I have come across a variety of names dated to be medieval but given without a source. I havent included these names if I havent found them from my sources.\n\nThe only exception is the table of ancient Finnish naming system (Table 1). It is a view of one researcher, but I have included it since he has based it on real evidence gathered from around the Baltic sea. There are very few examples of the pagan Finnish names in medieval sources.\n\nI owe thanks for Master Pietari Pentinpoika Uv, who has helped me to decipher some of the more cryptic names. He has also written the original text for the section III in this paper.\n\nRouva Gertrud i.e Gertru i.e Kerttu Katariinantytär Roisko\n\nLea Viljanen\n\nVironkatu 10 D 23, 00170 HELSINKI, FINLAND\n\nII On The Finnish Language\n\nThe purpose of this chapter is not to teach you Finnish, but to give you a few simple facts that you may need to know when looking at the actual name list.\n\nThe Finnish language belongs to the Finno-Ugric family of languages. This means that Finnish is not related in any way to English, Swedish (both are germanic languages) nor Russian (slavonic). The largest linguistic relatives of Finnish are Estonian and Hungarian. This unrelatedness to germanic languages is an important fact, since medieval Finland has been part of Sweden. During the Swedish reign many of the scribes were actually Swedish speaking and utilized Swedish spelling for Finnish names. Therefore the spelling may not accurately reflect the actual pronounciation of the name.\n\nFor example, Finnish has some vowel combinations (diphthongs), which Swedish just doesnt have. Therefore the Swedish speaking scribes havent been able to write them. Examples of such combinations are /uo/ and /ie/. For example, the name of our country, Suomi, is usually written somi in period texts. The same problem applies to double consonants (/tt/, /kk/ etc), most sources use only a single consonant where there should be two according to the Finnish pronunciation.\n\nThere is also a Finnish thing called vowel harmony. The vowel harmony dictates which vowels can be seen together in a word. The simplified rule is: in a non-compound word there cannot be vowels from both groups /u o a/ and /y ä ö/. The suffixes also follow this, if you want to say in a village in Finnish, the normal ending would be -ssa, but in this case you would have to say kylässä instead of *kylässa, since the latter word would include vowels from both groups. Combined words do not follow this rule as a whole, but the components of a combined word do. Remembering this rule helps a lot in deciphering weird spellings of the medieval scribes.\n\nAdditionally, Finnish does not have the voiced consonants [b], [d] and [g] (this fact can be clearly heard when some Finns speak English). Therefore the Finnish way is to substitute those alien sounds (and therefore letters) with the unvoiced [p], [t] and [k], respectively. This explains some spelling variants.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Finnish is its agglutinating nature. Agglutinating languages use suffixes where English would use prepositions. For example in English you say in the house, Finns would say talossa, where talo means house and ssa is a suffix for the case used to indicate being inside something. There are fifteen or so cases (to the dismay of schoolchildren and despair of foreigners) plus a serious number of other suffixes (in my house  would be translated as talossani).\n\nAs if this wouldnt make words long enough, we Finns have a tendency to combine simple words to make even longer words. For example a brick house would be called tiilitalo (tiili=brick), and if you are in it, you would say tiilitalossa, and if the house would be yours, you would say tiilitalossani... If the bricks were red, the house would be punatiilitalo (punainen=red, puna a shorter form) and so on ad infinitum.\n\nIII Structure Of A Finnish Name\n\nFirst names\n\nThere are several layers of first names in Finland. The earliest layers is the proto-Finnic name system. But since the earliest written records in Finland date from the 14th century, ie. definitely from the christian era, we dont really know a lot from pagan Finnish names. Some examples and traces have been found, mainly from surnames and locatives. Additionally these old names have been widely used also in the Carelia and Estonia, where more records and name variants can be found.\n\nThere is an addendum to this work, which tabulates the proto-Finnish names and name element according to the PhD dissertation of D.-E. Stoebke. While there are not so many definitive answers there, the work is the most comprehensive of its kind. So if you are interested in pagan names, look at the table, otherwise the actual name list may be more of a use.\n\nAnother layers are the germanic and scandinavian names, which eventually more or less displaced the old Finnish names. However, the names were very quickly adopted to the Finnish sound system and variants emerged very quickly (VIDKE  VITIKKA, BENGT  PENTTI). Additionally there is a layer of Russian and Greek Catholic names in easternmost Finland and Carelia.\n\nOther names\n\nAdditionally to first names, three types of other names were also used: patronymics and matronymics, locatives and bynames. There were maximum of one of each, but not everybody had all of them.\n\nMatronymics and Patronymics\n\nA matronymic indicates a mothers name and a patronymic the fathers. A patronymic was the norm, a matronymic was used probably only if the father wasnt known (for exampleMaijsa Lucija dotter). Most of these names were derived from the fathers (or mothers) first name, but some examples can be found where it was formed from a byname (Remi Kettun) or from the whole name (Maijsa Henrik Nijrans dotter).\n\nThe best know type is the straightforward-poika or-tytär ending to the actual parent name. However its not the only way, also a-nen-ending and spelling variants-n,-inen and-in were often used. The parents name was often in Swedish. Actual examples areOlcko Suninpoica (Sunis son),Laso Bengtin (Penttis son),Joann Lembivalchonen (Lempivalkonen, Lempivalkos son),Eskil Nielsson orAppollonia Pedersdotter (Pietaris daughter).\n\nThis type of-nen-patronymic was common especially in the Eastern Finland and these names were in active use in Carelia up to this century.\n\nLocatives - names from houses and villages\n\nPeople were usually from somewhere and locatives are quite a simple way to distinguish between two persons of the same name. The locative could be the name of the village or house. The locatives were formed in all the same ways as were patronymics (-nen, -n, -inen, -in). Which meansLæpsæ dotter af Kurhila was from Kurhila house/village andJunni karilanen from the house of. Additionally house names were formed by different case endings (Dominicus Hanhikosken,Junka Junitalasta) or without any ending whatsoever (Axel Tomasson Kiwiniemi).\n\nHowever, most of the scribes have used prepositions familiar to them when entering locatives (in Swedishi,av,från andpå, in latinde).\n\nBynames\n\nBynames were the most varying of names. They could indicate a profession (Volmar lenszman, nimismies), physical attributes (kutenHoykka Gregorius, hoikka - thin) or be just otherwise descriptive (for exampleHinric Poiu, poju - a kid,Girmund Suarte, svart - musta - black,Arendh Warg, varg - susi - wolf taiSigurd Whenapha, vehnäpää - wheat head). Also old pagan names or name elements were used as bynames (Michel Kaukapeiue, Kaukapäivä).\n\nIV References\n\nPrimary sources:\n\nAHV Suomen historiallisia lähteitä V:5.

On the left there is the name either spelled exactly as it was found or normalized to a more modern or Finnish spelling (for examplei-j,ae-ä) if that is easily deciphered or formed knowing modern Finnish names. However, I have tried to avoid making too radical changes to the actual examples. If the spellings found do not fully support a truly Finnish version of the name, I have indicated the proper Finnish spelling after the actual example.\n\nThe second column indicates the gender of the bearer in examples (F=female, M=male, ?=unknown or unclear). Most of the names marked as ambiguous are probably male, since the sources tend to excplicitly state whose wife/mother/sister/daughter a woman was. However, this probability does not apply to the ancient Finnish name system, for those names we really do not know if the names had any gender separation or not.\n\nThe last column includes the actual name examples as closely copied from the primary sources as possible. The actual name or name phrase is printed initalics. The examples are selected to give the reader a feel of the possible name spellings and variants. Some commentary on the name is also occasionally offered.\n\nMost names (all but the pagan Finnish names) have at least one dated reference, ie. I have personally found it from the primary sources. Some names, which are given as support or additional information, do not have the reference indicated, these names are taken from a secondary source (the Suomalainen nimikirja), mostly from the surnames section. The old Finnish name system is documented in the Table 1 on the last page.\n\nThe reference states the source abbreviation (see chapter V) and includes either the folio or page number where the example can be found. Some sources do not have folio numbers, so there is only the page number indicated.\n\nMost of the names are of Germanic or Scandinavian origin or their Finnish variants and some are pagan Finnish names or name elements. And some  well  unknown. Some of these names do not make sense even to a native Finn. I have tried to add a note to these weird cases."
