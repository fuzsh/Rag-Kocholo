        "text": "Post by gee on\n\nThis youtube guy Andrew is a Beatles 'expert' without question, and I really enjoy his many detailed informative postings where he goes into tremendous detail concerning many aspects of The Beatles catalogue and their story which is never less than fascinating...\n\nHe has done a Beatles v Hollies albums compare posting - to be fair he clearly likes and rates The Hollies and recommends their albums which is great....however he does the time honoured bigging up of The Beatles as if sun gods bestowing us with their glory on vinyl....and by compare the mere mortal Hollies are out of their depth etc - a bit of an exaggeration on my part maybe but he admits he only got into The Hollies later on and obviously The Beatles are his first love - no problem there, tho' he does only look at the sixties Hollies work chiefly the Nash years\n\nI do think he makes a few rather dismissive judgments however re Hollies music - bearing in mind they had nowhere near the studio time afforded The Beatles while one might ponder (as Bobby has) how much George Martin might have pushed The Hollies...and equally with no disrespect how much might Ron Richards have held The Beatles back..? (not any dig at Ron but the fact is he clearly wasn't anywhere near as enthusiastic about The Hollies and their songwriting...or had the same forward thinking ideas as GM had re The Fab Four - remember it was Ron not George who dumped Ringo off 'Love Me Do' !)\n\nWhile Lennon-McCartney clearly were mega prolific ...as Clarke-Hicks-Nash quickly became over 1966-67...and most people (maybe a bit brainwashed by the pop media perhaps ?) were Beatles mad, The Hollies songwriting was pretty imaginative and from 1965 notably they wrote some impressive songs about self confidence, intimidation,social issues, social class awareness, even death itself with historical references (''I've Got A Way of My Own', 'Don't Run And Hide','Too Many People', 'Hard Hard Year', 'What's Wrong With The Way I Live', 'High Classed' etc....)\n\n...while they created rather unusually structured with key and tempo changes songs such as 'Come On Back', 'When I Come Home To You', 'Oriental Sadness' (a title never mentioned in the lyrics)... the perverse non rhyming lines of 'Peculiar Situation' ...and whoever heard of a song called 'Pay You Back With Interest. ?\n\nDue to their cheerful happy go lucky innocent image (or lack of any major image or problems re image) people always took The Hollies for granted thus probably saw them as mere pop lightweights...but while this suited most of the group members the fact is songs such as 'Stop Stop Stop' and even 'Carrie Anne' ('then you played with older boys and prefects...') plus album track 'The Games We Play' ('...are you sure were getting away with this...?) had a direct \"riskay\" (for the times) angle that most Beatles singles songs never had - while even in 'Norwegian Wood' Lennon ends up sheepishly sleeping in the bath !\n\nThe Hollies use of unusual instruments such as vox flying phantom guitar, Banjo, glockenspiel, bells, the direct miking up of Bobby's drums, plus even sound effects (pre Beatles) prove they were at least working along the same innovative lines as The Fab Four\n\nThe Hollies and Beatles did cross over a few times style wise - but I can only think of about half a dozen Beatles songs that utilise full on three part harmonies as the featured vocal performance ('This Boy', 'Tell Me Why', 'Yes it Is', 'If I Needed Someone', 'Nowhere Man'....and later on 'Because')...however they differ as groups musically alot too with most Beatles songs featuring one singer and some with two plus backing vocals if used - also The Hollies had a 'jazzy' styled edge to them re some instrumental approaches like Bobby's drumming on 'I'm Alive', his outro on 'Interest'...the for the time quite lengthy Hicks / Alan Hawkshaw guitar / piano solo tradeoff on 'Put Yourself in My Place'\n\nEric Haydock's fast six string bass guitar runs were a key foundation of The Hollies that was unique to their style at that time\n\nthe way the two groups took 'A Taste of Honey' is so telling re their differences - and The Hollies had a clear folk music influence from artists such as The Kingston Trio and Peter Paul & Mary which became apparent over 1965-66\n\nwe all know how highly The Beatles rated the works of The Everly Brothers...and in turn The Everly Brothers rated the (non hits) original songs of The Hollies hence recording 'Two Yanks in England' in 1966 - so perhaps MORE critical respect and overdue acclaim ought to be afforded to The Hollies both as songwriters and musicians rather than just dismissing 'Hollies' (1965) and 'Would You Believe ?\" as 'patchy' and no comparison to 'Revolver' as this guy does here ?\n\n- of course we all know the strengths of 'Revolver' (tho' - dare I say it ? - I would have dropped the children's song 'Yellow Submarine' replacing it with 'Rain', and for me only 'Taxman' of George's three songs I'd rate as a true Harrison classic...while John's 'Dr Robert' is fine but not outstanding by his high standards - unlike say 'She Said' or 'I'm Only Sleeping'.... and I have never been overly mad on 'For No One' to be honest compared to say 'Here There and Everywhere' - but that is just my views of course)\n\nlike The Animals, Searchers, Spencer Davis Group even Rolling Stones The Hollies were at something of a crossroads in late 1965 / early 1966 with various factions within the group unlike the far more 'all together now' Beatles and their producer & team at EMI - often they were rushed in the studio and fighting to get THEIR own songs on a album (Ron had insisted they cut 'That's My Desire' in 1965 !) and that needs to be borne in mind .....so a direct compare with 'Revolver' is wrong and unfair, however there WAS enough creativity in the four original songs (one dating from 1965) plus in how they mixed Buddy Holly and The Byrds on 'Take Your Time' and covered the Paul Simon song to show how they were moving forward...while some conservative factions within and around the group saw them retain a safer stance on some Rock & Roll and soul covers VERY popular at that time\n\nso maybe Andrew needs to read Malc's book (that is if he hasn't yet) to understand The Hollies set up and situation circa 1965-66 ...and not make direct comparisons to Beatles works which is really unfair I feel\n\nHe goes no futher than 1969...so 'Confessions' / 'Distant Light' and the Rickfors era onwards are not part of his overview of Hollies album works which again he ought to address I feel if he has not yet done so\n\nBut I would reiterate he IS pretty positive re alot of Hollies album work which is good to see...he rates 'Evolution' and 'Butterfly' very highly while many youtube replies are DELIGHTED to see him cover The Hollies on his Beatles based channel...which might have surprised him at little maybe...?\n\nI can recommend this guy tho' overall - his excellent postings are FULL of information but he has a very fine style never coming across as any kind of 'know all' just objective and interesting...!\n\nPost by cameron on\n\nI've always said this... the Hollies got to where they did on their own merits. There was no \"shark\" manager causing controversies like the Stones had, no investor willing to pull strings like the Beatles had with Brian Epstein buying enough singles of 'Love Me Do' to get it into the national charts... The Hollies were on their own, and after 1966, barely even had EMI on their side, who put very lacklustre effort into promoting one of their best-selling acts across the world thanks to that 'Hollies Ltd' business deal.\n\nLikewise in the studio, Ron Richards pretty much left them to it. He was interested in what they bought to the table but was quite abrupt with his opinions of what was a hit and what wasn't. Thankfully, later on, he couldn't tell the Hollies what to do, which lead us to some great stuff that we otherwise wouldn't have got, particularly 'Long Cool Woman', from what I've heard of his comments about the track. I think perhaps the Hollies' secret weapon was Peter Bown who was interested in getting a good sound onto tape, and worked with the band - particularly Bobby - to accommodate their wishes.\n\nThe Beatles vs Hollies comparison isn't fair. People see a musical year as being linear in the 1960s, but the \"summer of love\" didn't kick off until 1st June 1967 when 'Sgt. Pepper' dropped. By that reckoning, 'Evolution' was WAY ahead of the curve. Most popular artists who are remembered for great psychedelic albums didn't put out their response to 'Sgt. Pepper' until the END of 1967 or even as late as mid-1968 in the case of The Move and the Small Faces. In early 1967, following 'Revolver', the Rolling Stones were putting out the perfect pop album with 'Between The Buttons', which was dismissed by the band themselves more or less immediately. Ditto the Small Faces self-titled debut for Immediate records around the same time, only hints at their full blown flower power potential later in the year... Credit where credit is due, 'Revolver' WAS ahead of the curve for its time, though its a sum of parts for me. There's a lot more filler on that LP than there is on 'Rubber Soul', IMO. And lots of artists at the time in Britain were busy taking their lead from 'Pet Sounds', which was a different direction entirely...\n\nPost by gee on\n\nThere is an argument - and I know some who feel it - that The Beatles were really just mostly a pop group NOT a rock or blues outfit like say Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Fleetwood Mac, Yardbrids, Jeff Beck Group, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (featuring Mick Taylor) Ten Years After etc...'serious groups' not just pop music\n\ncertainly as time went on in the sixties The Beatles both in look and musical style moved towards the likes of The Rolling Stones,THE Who,The Pretty Things etc...than ever the other way around...\n\nThe Beatles never broke out of the standard love songs format until late 1965 - while say Ray Davies was writing songs about class distinction and social structure ('A Well Respected Man') , Pete Townshend was writing about the inequalities of life ('Substitute') and the frustrations of youth ('A Legal Matter', 'My Generation'), even The Hollies were writing about social issues and the inevitability of death itself in 1965...\n\nAlso The Beatles used session players for things like the flute whilst groups like Manfred Mann, The Moody Blues had flute players and in the case of The Manfreds more skilled vibes, saxophone, trumpet, double bass players etc\n\nMike Hugg of Manfred Mann was writing songs about racial prejudice in 1966 ('Mr, You're A Better Man Than I') and The Yardbirds writing songs about everything from suicide ('Farewell') to nuclear destruction '('Shapes of Things') in 1966\n\nmany artists were moving in areas The Beatles never ventured into before 1966...yes they were among the innovative crowd but were not the FIRST to do everything as they get credited with doing\n\nwhilst The Beatles love songs were pretty much the standard tales of love with the victim of a poorly acting partner other writers like say John Sebastian ventured into the deeper angle of a totally inaccessable relationship in 'Younger Girl', and took the opposite view on a broken relationship in 'Didn't Want To Have To Do it' than say Paul took in 'You Won't See Me' - when Sebastian's song was from the viewpoint of the one ending the relationship BUT hating breaking her heart...not just walking away from a bad relationship as in so many songs\n\nThe Hollies songs such as 'I've Got A Way of My Own', 'Don't Run And Hide', 'Whats Wrong With The Way I Live', 'Hard Hard Year', and 'High Classed' explored social issues and even a form of bullying from others breaking someone's confidence - all quite deep tho' they never get much recognition for it.\n\neven The Four Seasons were doing social comment songs about the unemployed such as 'Beggars Parade' in 1966 - another idiom are The Beatles never ventured into as first and foremost they mostly kept a popular style even when they became more adventurous with songs like 'Hey Jude' full of La La La La...\n\nPost by madprofessorblyth on\n\nI understand a bit of what you're saying there Gee, but with all due respect I think what you mention is a part of the Beatles' universal appeal and a part of what makes them so important with the innovations that they did make. As an example, of course like all of their peers, the first two Beatles LPs were mostly 'love songs,' but I think we could likely all agree that their sound had already hugely shifted between 'Please Please Me' and 'With The Beatles,' in that they sound even more confident and skilled in their playing and their songwriting. While the actual lyrical content might be more about boy/girl situations, the distinctive melodies and shocking chord changes put them in a special field: their music was fresh and available to be appreciated by both the teenyboppers in school as well as the 20-somethings who would be peers with the members of these groups. The fact that recordings like 'Ask Me Why' and 'I Want To Hold Your Hand' were made in the same year is pretty amazing in ways, that they'd already come so far. While most people would say there aren't any 'obscure' Beatles recordings left, there are still some great nuggets like 'Not A Second Time' which in some ways are very simple but also have distinctive elements (like that unexpected chord change) which make them quite unique and memorable. I love all of those other groups you mention, including the Hollies of course, and firmly believe they are all underrated in their own way, but I don't think that judging exclusively on lyrical content makes them any more 'ahead' or 'behind' the Fabs. To play 'devil's advocate' a bit, perhaps some people were looking more for a 30 minute musical escape from their weary worldly circumstances rather than yet another song describing and commiserating the dreariness that they and their families were dealing with day-in and day-out. I'm not sure we can equate the Beatles' output with examples like 'A Well Respected Man' and others, when those groups too got to those topics after getting popular with their own boy/girl love songs - for example's sake, the Kinks, who I absolutely adore, sure built their early career on many of those- and they too had some covers which didn't enhance their prowess, especially that abysmal 'Louie Louie'! And even after those early flirtations with those songs, they still had 'Till The End Of The Day,' and cuts like 'I'm On An Island' which isn't any more culturally relevant than a Beatles track like 'The Word' which is pretty ahead of its time as a pre-'Sunshine Superman' track of expanding horizons...!\n\nAs we've all discussed here many times (including already a bit within this thread), unfortunately in many ways the Hollies were the ones responsible for holding themselves back (Sweet Little Sixteen as previously mentioned being a prime example of what *not* to do!) - I of course agree with the wish that the various 'critics' would give them more of the respect which they rightfully deserve - but they've never been their own advocates in terms of promoting their reputation (or lack thereof). I'm not sure trying to compare any of these groups, especially with specific examples which might remove some of the context, really does *any* of these groups justice... they're all a piece of the puzzle that makes that era so great, fascinating, and full of brilliantly crafted pop music. However, the Beatles were the zeitgeist and not just another talented pop group for a whole host of reasons - which can't be captured in a casual or short fashion (surely would be a voluminous undertaking!) Just my thoughts\n\nPost by baz on\n\n...yet the likes of say; Tommy Steele, Lonnie Donegan, Duane Eddy, Cliff Richard, The Shadows, Joe Brown, The Tornados (& producer Joe Meek), Johnny Kidd & The Pirates, Billy Fury, etc...are seldom if ever credited as having any kind of influence on The Beatles and their music...but each did have some influence in one way or another\n\nIncreasingly I see people posting on youtube etc how ONLY The Beatles did this, that, whatever first...and were increasingly light years ahead of EVERYBODY ELSE...!\n\nsuch blinkered blind adoration is not a good thing, and does The Beatles no favors really....a balanced view with a proper sense of perspective needs to be retained - it's fascinating to see how the artists back in that fifties / sixties era duly influenced each other so much and their respective music was all the better for it..\n\nI've spent the last 20 years reassembling my music collection in a way where I can now listen to everything chronologically and the main reason I did this was so I could gain a much better insight and understanding on how the music of the 50's and 60's evolved. The whitewashing of history that implies The Beatles invented everything just makes me retch and I count myself as a huge Beatles fan. Hang about... there's that photo of John Lennon getting Billy Fury's autograph in 1960, Mike McCartney's sneaky shot of George Harrison posing with Joe Brown's guitar in 1962 and the wonderful accounts of when The Beatles and The Shadows met for the first time with The Beatles parodying the famous Shadows' walk and became good pals. And those guys meant nothing to The Beatles? Yeah, right. Oh, what was John heard humming on the big Abbey Road set before a take of one of their songs... oh... \"Man Of Mystery\". The Beatles knew ALL those artistes works and took some inspiration whether it be musical or visual. For goodness' sake, Paul McCartney went on a date and saw Frank Ifield... an amusing story as he was dating Ifield's girlfriend... and oh, they covered his big hit \"I Remember You\"!\n\nAll we ever hear is how they plundered American 45's... of course they did, they were always looking for material other British acts hadn't yet found in order to try and stand out but to assume that was all they were influenced by is ignorant and nonsensical. They soaked up music from all genres... they devoured it because it was educational and inspirational. Hey, Bruce Chanel's latest record has a harmonica on it, let's get one of them things... and the harmonica was an important part of those first three Beatles singles.\n\nEverybody was influencing each other, taking a little from this, a touch of that and creating something different and fresh with their own identity stamped upon it. NOBODY was genuinely 100% original though many records sounded original because of the changing technology and new sounds. A classic example for me is The Kinks' \"You Really Got Me\" - that was a startling bolt out of the blue as nobody had heard guitar played like THAT before though the structure is very derivative of American blues. Sure, The Beatles thought they were being original with the final chord of \"She Loves You\" and whilst George Martin thought it sounded odd, he realised it was very Glenn Miller so perhaps the Fab's unconsciously \"borrowed\" from Glenn Miller as well... it didn't really matter where those touches or chords came from... they'd have heard them before and used them in new ways.\n\nIt's always great to see any mention of Johnny Kidd and The Pirates these days as they were criminally under-rated and now unfairly forgotten... they were loved by practically everyone that saw their live show and by goodness some of those singles were absolute killers and I like to think Lennon channeled a bit of Kidd in his vocal style. Lennon readily admitted that the first British rock and roll record that meant something was Cliff's \"Move It\" and I'm sure he would have loved \"Please Don't Touch\" and \"Shakin' All Over\" as well. I do wonder if he was aware of Vince Taylor's sublime \"Brand New Cadillac\" as EMI dumped that one away on a B side!"
