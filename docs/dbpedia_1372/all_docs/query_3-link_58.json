        "text": "People\n\nThe great majority of the people of Sweden are of ethnic Swedish origin. The two main minority groups of indigenous peoples are the Finns and the Sami (Lapps). The Finns live mainly in the northeast, along the border with Finland. In Sweden’s northern interior live some 20,000 Sami (see Lapland). Once a hunting and fishing people, the Sami developed a system of herding reindeer that they still practice today. Most of the Sami in Sweden have other occupations as well.\n\nAlthough different groups of immigrants have influenced Swedish culture through the centuries, the population of Sweden historically has been unusually alike in ethnicity, language, and religion. In the 20th century, however, Sweden began to receive more immigrants. At first, most of the people moving to Sweden came from other Scandinavian countries. Starting in the late 20th century, Sweden began to receive an increasing number of refugees from countries in the Middle East and Africa, including Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Turkey, Eritrea, and Somalia. Many people from Latin American countries that were suffering under repressive governments also moved to Sweden. In the second decade of the 21st century, the number of people seeking asylum (a place of safety) in Sweden expanded dramatically. They included many people fleeing from a civil war in Syria.\n\nThe national language of Sweden is Swedish. It belongs to the Scandinavian group of Germanic languages and shares many features in common with Norwegian and Danish. Finnish and the Sami languages belong to the Finno-Ugric group. About 200 languages are now spoken in Sweden because of immigration.\n\nMost of Sweden’s people are Protestants, mainly Lutherans belonging to the Church of Sweden. Immigration has brought many Muslims, Roman Catholics, and Greek Orthodox Christians to Sweden. Judaism has been practiced in Sweden since the late 18th century.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the population lives in urban settlements. The largest city is the capital, Stockholm, which is also the country’s educational, cultural, and industrial center. Other major Swedish cities are Göteborg (Gothenburg), Malmö, and Uppsala. Most of the Swedish population, both urban and rural, are concentrated in the south of the country.\n\nCulture\n\nSwedish literature dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, when books of law appeared. In 1541 a Bible translation by Olaus Petri marked the beginning of the modern Swedish language. King Gustav III encouraged the writing of literature by founding the Swedish Academy in 1786. In the 18th century one of Sweden’s greatest poets, Carl Michael Bellmann, wrote songs set to his own music that are still popular.\n\nIn the 19th century such poets as Erik Gustaf Geijer and Esaias Tegnér were inspired by Sweden’s past. Other poets, such as Viktor Rydberg and Carl Snoilsky, followed a realist trend in literature.\n\nIn the 20th century the greatest of Sweden’s literary figures, August Strindberg, wrote novels and plays that had a great influence on the development of European literature. Other authors who wrote at the beginning of the 20th century were Gustaf af Geijerstam, Albert Engström, and Selma Lagerlöf, a Nobel Prize winner in 1909. Lagerlöf was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Swedish poets include Gustaf Fröding and Verner von Heidenstam, who won a Nobel Prize in 1916.\n\nSome of the most notable modern Swedish writers—Pär Lagerkvist, poet Harry Martinson, and novelist Eyvind Johnson—were Nobel laureates. The Nobel Prizes were instituted by the Swedish scientist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite. In contemporary Swedish literature such authors as Kerstin Ekman, P.C. Jersild, Lars Gustafsson, Sara Lidman, Henning Mankell, and Mikael Niemi found a wide audience. Stieg Larsson dazzled readers worldwide with a series of detective novels that helped to set the stage for international appreciation of Swedish and Scandinavian crime fiction. One of the most widely published and translated modern Swedish writers is Astrid Lindgren, noted for her children’s books, including the famous Pippi Longstocking series. (See also Scandinavian literature.)\n\nThe most famous Swedish artist was probably Anders Zorn, who produced remarkable paintings and etchings. The sculptor Carl Milles designed fountains and monuments both in Sweden and the United States. Sweden is renowned for its leadership in glass and furniture design. The country has also been a world leader in industrial design.\n\nSweden’s contribution to music lies mainly in the country’s singers. Famous Swedish singers include Jenny Lind, Birgit Nilsson, and Jussi Björling. Popular music, especially the Europop of the internationally celebrated group ABBA, and music production, editing, and advertising were major Swedish exports from the late 1970s on.\n\nSwedes have made important contributions to film. Actor-director Victor Sjöström was a pioneer of the Swedish film industry in the silent and early sound eras. Later, director Ingmar Bergman was hailed internationally as one of the most important filmmakers of all time. Other notable people of the Swedish film industry include actors Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Bibi Andersson, and Max von Sydow and director Lasse Hallström.\n\nSweden has a rich heritage of folk culture, which developed when the population consisted mainly of farmers. Local folk costumes, art, and music have largely vanished from everyday Swedish life but are maintained for special occasions. They can also be found at the numerous open-air folk museums, where old farmhouses and other aspects of former peasant life are on display. One such open-air museum is at Skansen in Stockholm.\n\nThere are some special holidays celebrated by the Swedes. On December 13 young girls wear headdresses of wreaths decorated with lighted candles and serve coffee and special buns to older family members. This day is known as St. Lucia’s Day, and there are parades and celebrations in most communities. The holiday marks the beginning of the Christmas season, and it is meant to bring hope and light during the darkest time of the year. Midsummer Eve is celebrated about June 21—the summer solstice (the longest day of the year)—with dances and songs. At this time of the year, in most of Sweden it is light until late at night.\n\nEarly History\n\nSwedish history begins with the activities of the Vikings in the 9th century. The Vikings established a trading center at Birka near modern Stockholm. They followed river routes from the Baltic Sea to the interior of Russia, where they established strongholds. The Swedish Vikings also reached Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) and the Caspian Sea.\n\nChristianity spread slowly in Sweden after the baptism of King Olaf (Olof Skötkonung) at the end of the 10th century. Royal power was weak, and the country was divided into a number of provinces that had their own laws. As Sweden gradually became more unified, Uppsala emerged as the first capital. About 1250 the city of Stockholm was founded. Being close to the sea, it grew rapidly as a port and commercial center, and by the 15th century it had become the capital of the country.\n\nThe founder of Stockholm was probably Birger Jarl, who produced the first Swedish national laws in the mid-13th century. He also gave German merchants privileges for trade with Sweden. By the following century Sweden’s trade was almost entirely controlled by the German Hanseatic League, and the richest and most powerful citizens were German traders.\n\nThe Middle Ages were marked by internal struggles for supremacy between the kings, their relatives, and the nobles. In 1397 King Erik of Pomerania was elected king of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway. An attempt to consolidate the three countries into a single kingdom was made in a proposal for the Kalmar Union, which was never ratified. Erik was deposed in Sweden and Denmark in 1439 and in Norway in 1442. There followed a period of unrest and revolts. A nobleman, Sten Sture the Elder, became state administrator of Sweden in 1471 and served as regent for many years. He died in 1503. In 1520 King Christian II of Denmark landed in Sweden and put many supporters of the still-powerful Sture family to death in the Stockholm Bloodbath.\n\nA Growing Power\n\nThe Swedes expelled the Danes in 1523, and King Gustav I Vasa came to the throne as the ruler of an independent Sweden. By 1537 he had broken the trade monopoly of the Hanseatic League and laid the foundations for the growth of Sweden as a strong state. At this time the Reformation reached Sweden, and the Lutheran form of Protestantism eventually became the national religion.\n\nIn the 17th century Sweden emerged as a great power in the Baltic region. Finland was already under Swedish control, and Estonia had been annexed in 1595. King Gustavus Adolphus played the major role in Sweden’s rise to power. By seizing more eastern Baltic territories from Russia and Poland, he turned the Baltic into a Swedish sea. He joined the German Protestants in their wars against the Austrian Roman Catholics but was killed at Lützen in 1632. Sweden gained territory in Pomerania on the southern coast of the Baltic. In 1660 the Swedes won from Denmark the islands of Ösel and Gotland and other Danish territories in southern Sweden.\n\nSweden’s decline as a great power began under the reign of Charles XII. After military successes against the Danes, Poles, and Russians, Charles attempted an invasion of Russia and was defeated at Poltava in 1709. After his death Sweden’s power gradually decreased. The rising power of Russia and continued opposition from Denmark created serious problems. A war between Sweden and Russia took place between 1788 and 1790, and in 1808 Russia annexed Finland.\n\nIn 1810 one of Napoleon’s generals, Jean Bernadotte, was invited to become crown prince. He became king in 1818 as Charles XIV John. Napoleon approved the union of Sweden and Norway, which took place despite Norwegian opposition, in 1815. This union was dissolved in 1905.\n\nThe 20th and 21st centuries\n\nSweden remained neutral in World War I but suffered from the European economic crisis that followed. The Social Democrats, in power from 1932 to 1976, expanded the modern welfare state. Sweden was again neutral in World War II, but it permitted German troops to cross Swedish territory in order to reach Norway. Sweden provided shelter, however, for many refugees of German oppression.\n\nThe postwar period was marked by the further development of the Swedish economy. Sweden became one of the most prosperous countries in Europe. The Social Democrat leader Olof Palme was prime minister from 1969 until 1976. After a short period of rule by a center-right coalition government, Palme returned to power in 1982. In 1986 he was assassinated on a Stockholm street. A suspect was found guilty in 1989, but an appeals court overturned the conviction because of insufficient evidence. In 1991 the Moderate Party leader was named prime minister. It was only the second time in 60 years that Sweden was governed under a nonsocialist leader. The Social Democrats returned to power after winning a general election in September 1994. In the early 21st century, power alternated between the Social Democrats and the Moderates.\n\nSweden has been a member of the United Nations (UN) since 1946. The country joined the European Union (EU) on January 1, 1995, after a referendum on membership was approved by voters in November 1994. Sweden did not, however, adopt the euro, the European single currency, when the euro was introduced in 1999. Sweden held the EU’s rotating presidency in 2001. In September 2003 Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh was fatally stabbed in a Stockholm department store. Lindh had been a leader in the campaign to adopt the euro. In a referendum held days after her murder, however, the country again rejected the European currency. Although the Swedish economy was hard-hit by the global financial crisis and economic downturn of 2008–09, it was able to bounce back quickly. However, the unemployment rate was high among young people, and many Swedes were dissatisfied with the growing gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nSweden was at the center of a migrant crisis that swept through Europe in 2015. More than a million migrants arrived in Europe after fleeing turmoil in the Middle East—most notably the Syrian Civil War—and Africa. That year, more than 160,000 migrants came to Sweden—a prosperous country with a generous welfare system and a reputation for being welcoming. Swedish social service facilities were overwhelmed by the mass influx of people. Some Swedes, especially those who supported an anti-immigration political party, were also afraid that terrorists might be posing as migrants. In response, Sweden enacted new immigration restrictions. The government also denied refugee status to tens of thousands of people who sought asylum in Sweden, meaning that they had to leave the country.\n\nSweden's rulers from 1523\n\nFor many years Sweden declined to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The country wanted to remain neutral and stay out of military alliances such as NATO. However, Russia’s military presence in the Baltic region generally became more aggressive in the 2010s. As a result, in 2016 Sweden agreed to provide “host nation” support for NATO forces. It also stationed a permanent force of Swedish troops on the Baltic island of Gotland. In February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine and started a war there. In the wake of this aggression, Sweden changed its long-standing position on neutrality. The country asked to join NATO, and in June the alliance formally invited Sweden to become a member. Sweden officially joined the alliance in March 2024."
