        "text": "Chronology of Colonial Swedes on the Delaware 1638-1713\n\nby Dr. Peter Stebbins Craig\n\nFellow, American Society of Genealogists\n\nFellow, Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania\n\nHistorian, Swedish Colonial Society\n\noriginally published in Swedish Colonial News,\n\nVolume 2, Number 5 (Fall 2001)\n\nAlthough it is commonly known that the Swedes were the first white settlers to successfully colonize the Delaware Valley in 1638, many historians overlook the continuing presence of the Delaware Swedes throughout the colonial period. Some highlights covering the first 75 years (1638-1713) are shown below:\n\nNew Sweden Era, 1638-1655\n\n1638 – After a 4-month voyage from Gothenburg, Kalmar Nyckel arrives in the Delaware in March. Captain Peter Minuit purchases land on west bank from the Schuylkill River to Bombay Hook, builds Fort Christina at present Wilmington and leaves 24 men, under the command of Lt. Måns Kling, to man the fort and trade with Indians. Kalmar Nyckel returns safely to Sweden, but Minuit dies on return trip in a hurricane in the Caribbean.\n\n1639 – Fogel Grip, which accompanied Kalmal Nyckel, brings a 25th man from St. Kitts, a slave from Angola known as Anthony Swartz.\n\n1640 – Kalmar Nyckel, on its second voyage, brings the first families to New Sweden, including those of Sven Gunnarsson and Lars Svensson. Other new settlers include Peter Rambo, Anders Bonde, Måns Andersson, Johan Schaggen, Anders Dalbo and Dr. Timen Stiddem. Lt. Peter Hollander Ridder, who succeeds Kling as new commanding officer, purchases more land from Indians between Schuylkill and the Falls of the Delaware.\n\n1641 – Kalmar Nyckel, joined by the Charitas, brings 64 men to New Sweden, including the families of Måns Lom, Olof Stille, Christopher Rettel, Hans Månsson, Olof Thorsson and Eskil Larsson. Also such single men as Peter Cock, Matts Hansson and his brother Anders Hansson, Ivert Hendricksson, Johan Ericksson, Matts Hansson from Borgå, Johan Stålkofta, Lucas Petersson, Knut Mårtensson, Lars Bjur, and four orphans, including Israel Helm. Ridder purchases land on east side of Delaware from Raccoon Creek to Cape May, and on west side from Bombay Hook to Cape Henlopen.\n\n1642 – Probable year of first settlement in present Pennsylvania, at Techoherassi, Upland and Finland.\n\n1643 – The Fama and Swan arrive from Sweden, bringing Johan Printz, first royal governor of New Sweden, six feet tall and weighing 400 pounds, with 50 new settlers, including Captain Sven Skute, soldiers Jonas Nilsson, Jürgen Keen, Johan Gustafsson, Anders And-ersson Homman, Peter Jochimsson and the family of Anders Andersson the Finn. Printz builds Fort Elfsborg on east side of Delaware and Fort New Gothenburg on Tinicum Island, where he also builds his own manor house, called Printzhof.\n\n1644 – Kalmar Nyckel and Fama arrive from Sweden with 14 more men, including Lt. Johan Papegoja. Printz establishes tobacco plantations at Christina, Upland and on west side of Schuylkill (Province Island), but the experiment is a disaster. Revert to corn the next year, buying tobacco from Virginia.\n\n1645 – Settlement is made at Kingsessing and the first grist mill is built on Mill (now Cobbs) Creek.\n\n1646 – First log church built on Tinicum Island.\n\n1647 – Fort Korsholm is completed on Province Island.\n\n1648 – Swan arrives from Sweden, bringing 12 or more men, including Rev. Lars Carlsson Lock, Nils Larsson Frände, Johan Fisk and Hendrick Johansson. Aronameck, on west side of Schuylkill, settled. Dutch build Fort Beversreede on east side of Schuylkill, but Swedes thwart Dutch attempts to build dwellings in area.\n\n1649 – Kattan runs aground near Puerto Rico. None of its 69 passengers reach New Sweden. Most of them die in the Caribbean. A few find their way back to Sweden, including Dr. Timen Stiddem.\n\n1651 – Dutch build Fort Casimir at Sand Hook (New Castle) and abandon Fort Bevers-reede in Schuylkill. Governor Printz, his forces depleted by deaths and desertions to Maryland, abandons Fort Elfsborg and Fort Korsholm, concentrating his forces at Fort Christina and Fort New Gothenburg. The Christina River becomes the de facto boundary between New Sweden and the Dutch.\n\n1652 – Printz seizes plantation of Lars Svensson (Lasse the Finn) on west side of Up-land (Chester) Creek, claiming that Lasse and his wife were guilty of witchcraft and owed him money. Renames plantation Printztorp. Lasse and his wife die, and other freemen become more hostile to Printz’s rule. Several freemen move to Fort Casimir area to live under Dutch rule.\n\n1653 – Twenty-two freemen file petition with Governor Printz, complaining of his auto-cratic rule. Printz brands the petition a “mutiny”, accuses Pastor Lars Lock, Olof Stille and one of his own soldiers of instigating the crime. After having the soldier killed by a firing squad, Printz packs his bags and returns to Sweden, leaving the colony under the command of his son-in-law Johan Papegoja. Fifteen more freemen flee the colony to seek refuge at Fort Casimir or Kent Island, Maryland. Papegoja hires Indians to bring them back, dead or alive. Indians return with heads of two former freemen.\n\n1654 – Population of New Sweden is now reduced to 70 men, women and children. Survivors debate uniting with the Dutch at Fort Casimir, but the issue becomes moot when the Eagle arrives in May with about 250 passengers, including some old-timers such as Dr. Timen Stiddem. Johan Rising, the new Governor, captures Fort Casimir from the Dutch, restoring the entire Delaware River to Swedish control. Including the Dutch at Fort Casimir (which he renamed Fort Trinity), Rising counts 368 persons in the colony. But disease and famine soon take their toll, and most of the Dutch move to New Amsterdam (New York). Governor Rising introduces reforms to insure that freemen’s rights to property are protected and adds freemen Peter Rambo and Matts Hansson from Borgå to his Council. Olof Stille and Peter Cock also sit as justices at Tinicum Island. New settlements are established at Ammansland (Ridley Township) and Swanwick.\n\n1655 – Food shortages plague the colony. Some colonists move to the Sassafras River in Maryland. In September, Dutch Governor Stuyvesant, with seven armed ships and 317 soldiers, invades New Sweden. Badly outnum-bered, the Swedes surrender the colony without a fight. Governor Rising and 36 others return to Sweden. Most of the Swedes and Finns decide to stay in America, pledging allegiance to the Dutch.\n\nThe Swedish Nation, 1656-1681\n\n1656 – Mercurius arrives from Sweden in March, carrying 14 Swedes and 92 Finns. After Dutch refuse to allow ship to pass Fort Casimir, the Indians climb aboard and usher the ship to Tinicum Island, where the passengers land. The ship, including its commander (Johan Papegoja), safely returns to Sweden. The Dutch are persuaded to grant the Swedes and Finns self-government in the area north of Christina River. In August, the first court is ap-proved, consisting of Olof Stille, Mats Hansson from Borgå, Peter Cock and Peter Rambo. First militia headed by Captain Sven Skute, Lt. Anders Dalbo and Ensign Jacob Svensson. Newly-arrived Finns settle at Marcus Hook and Bochten (Verdrietige Hook).\n\n1657 – Having acquired the area south of the Christina River from the Dutch West India Company, the City of Amsterdam establishes its own colony, called New Amstel, at present New Castle. Stuyvesant retains nominal con-trol over the Swedish Nation north of Christina River.\n\n1658 – Numerous tracts are surveyed in Maryland on the Sassafras River for Swedes and Finns who had moved there.\n\n|\n\n1660 – Alexander d’Hinojossa becomes governor of New Amstel after death of Jacob Alrichs. Stuyvesant asks Swedish nation to supply soldiers in his war against the Indians at Esopus (Kingston, NY). Swedes refuse, insisting on their historic non-aggression policy with the Indians.\n\n1662 – Armegot Printz Papegoja, daughter of Johan Printz, sells Tinicum Island to a Dutchman, Joost de la Grange, excepting the Swedes’ church from the sale. Swedes’ court moves to Upland. D’Hinojossa invites Finns living in the Swedish nation to move to Crane Hook. About 15 families agree to move.\n\n1663 – Stuyvesant begins issuing land patents to Swedish settlers in the Swedish nation. At request of d’Hinojossa, City of Amsterdam solicits more Finns to leave Sweden for the Delaware. Thirty-two Finns arrive on the Purmerlander Kerck and settle at Feren Hook on south side of Christina Creek.\n\n1664 – Control over Swedish nation, north of Christina River, transferred from Stuyvesant to New Amstel. Peter Rambo, Sven Gunnarsson and sons, Olof Stille, Lars Andersson Collinus move across Schuylkill to Passyunk, Wicaco and Moyamensing and receive confirming patents from d’Hinojossa. Another ship from Amsterdam, carrying 140 Finns for the New Amstel colony, sinks in Atlantic Ocean. English warships seize the New Amstel colony from the Dutch. Swedes and Finns are assured that their property rights and freedoms will not be affected. The Upland Court continues as before. Olof Stille retires and is replaced by Peter Cock as Chief Justice of the Upland Court. Israel Helm replaces Mats Hansson, deceased.\n\n1665 – Dutch freemen begin acquiring land from Indians on east side of Delaware (New Jersey) opposite New Castle.\n\n1667 – Log church built at Crane Hook to serve Swedes and Finns living between Verdrietige Hook and New Castle. Lars Lock, minister at Tinicum church, agrees to serve both congregations.\n\n1669 – A Finn named Marcus Jacobsson, posing as son of Swedish general Königsmark, travels from house to house in the Swedish na-tion, urging them to take up arms against the English. He is caught by Justice Peter Cock, tried, convicted of treason and sold as a slave in Barbados. Settlers who supported the “Long Finn Rebellion” are fined.\n\n1671 – First English census of the Delaware enumerates 165 households between Burlington Island and New Castle. Except at these two extremities and at Passyunk (mostly English), the population is overwhelmingly Swedish and Finnish. First Finns to move to the east side of Delaware River settle in what later became known as Penn’s Neck, Salem County.\n\n1673 – Upland Court is increased to five justices with addition of Lars Andersson Collinus and Olof Svensson. Swedes and Finns make first settlement in Gloucester County, on Raccoon Creek, in an area soon called New Stockholm.\n\n1675 – Upland Court obtains authority to build a third Swedish church at Wicaco, to serve households living above Mill (Darby) Creek. Part of court fines are earmarked for this purpose.\n\n1676 – Upland Court is increased to six justices with addition of Otto Ernest Cock.\n\n1677 – New log church at Wicaco dedicated.
