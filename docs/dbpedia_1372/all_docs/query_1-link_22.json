        "text": "CBID is the Chuck Berry International Directory, a 2.200 page pile of Chuck Berry records information published in four volumes between 2008 and 2013. For details see the bibliography section of this site.\n\nCBID is never complete as new records and CDs appear and some old rarities are discovered. This section presents interesting additions and corrections to CBID.\n\nToday: The more you browse the Internet, the more cover versions you find. Here's another list of artists and band playing Chuck Berry's music. This time all new entries start with the letter M [continued]\n\nMADHOUSE (Sweden)\n\nEarly ‘80s rock band produced by a.o. Dr. John and Willy DeVille. Members: Anders Kraft, Bengt Kirschon, Björn Gideonsson, Christian Falk and Gabbe Gabrielsson.\n\nNadine (4:10) 1982\n\n12” EP: Private Hell 36 [Sound Of Scandinavia SOSM-1136] ● Sweden, 1982\n\nMARCE & CHEMA (Spain)\n\nLatino pop duo with a little rock in them. They usually sing in Spanish but I haven’t heard the Berry medley so I can’t verify.\n\nRockmania medley: Johnny B. Goode / Carol / Memphis, Tennessee / Nadine / Roll Over Beethoven / Rock And Roll Music (8:30) 1979\n\nLP: Ganador [Reflejo 10C 062-062.888] ● Spain, 1979 (promo)\n\nMC: Ganador [Reflejo 10C 262 062 888] ● Spain, 1979\n\nLASSE MÅRTENSON (Finland)\n\nLars Anders Fredrik Mårtenson, popsinger, songwriter, musician and actor, born 1934 in Helsinki. His first single came out in 1962, and many more followed. Several albums since 1966. He died in 2016.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee [as “Saanko Turkuun, Naapuriin”] ( : ) 1966\n\nLP: Lasse [RCA Victor LPM-10071] ● Finland, 1966\n\nMARTÒ & THE JUDAS (Italy)\n\nGiancarlo Martelli, pop/rock singer. Seems like he had a great hit in Italy with “Hey Joe” in 1967. Performed in Italian.\n\nBye Bye Johnny [as “Bie Bie Johnny!!!”] (1:40) 1966\n\nLP: Lost And Found [Discoverix DSX-33001] Italy, 1991\n\nLimited edition 500 copies. Previously unissued. I am always skeptical to such short versions. It’s almost over before it starts.\n\nMAYBERRIES (UK)\n\nRock sextet based in Mayfield, East Sussex fronted by lead singer John Murray. They play rock’n’roll, blues and soul and are gigging in Mayfield and the surrounding area. They recorded some demo tracks back in July 2018.\n\nLittle Queenie (3:22) 2022\n\n70th Jubilee Edition for streaming on all platforms and a special You Tube video\n\nYes I know, this is not the way this list usually goes. But this was recorded to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The video was produced incorporating classic photographs and clips from the queen’s reign and artwork by local primary school children. And best of all, 100 per cent of the proceeds from the song will go to help seriously ill children from across the UK treated at Great Osmond Street Hospital.\n\nPETE MacDONALD & THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN (Canada)\n\nCountry music singer, songwriter and guitarist from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. Leader of The Country Gentlemen.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee [as “Memphis”] (2.17) 1968\n\nLP: Pete MacDonald And The Country Gentlemen [Banff SBS-5330] ● Canada, 1967\n\nLP: Pete MacDonald And The Country Gentlemen [Rodeo Int. SRLP-7112] ● Canada, 1968\n\nRecorded at Stereo Sound Studios, Montreal, P.Q. One side is instrumental and one side vocals (“Memphis”).\n\nALI McGREGOR (Australia)\n\nBorn 1974 in Melbourne, Victoria. Soprano opera singer, actress and cabaret performer.\n\nRun Rudolph Run (3:22) 2015\n\nCD: A Very Jazzamatazz Christmas [ABC Music (Universal) 4729008 ] ● Australia, 2015\n\nCan’t say it sounded so very jazzy (unfortunately) despite featuring a horn section. More like a “soul” version except her voice is not.\n\nMEDECIN’E (France)\n\nRock’n’roll quartet.\n\nBeautiful Delilah (2:06) 2004\n\nI’m Talking About You [as “Talkin’ Bout You”] (2:21) 2004\n\nNadine (3:55) 2004\n\nCD: Rock Therapy [Caducée Records CD-004] ● France, 2004\n\nThey also do “Route 66” credited to Chuck Berry(!), sorry Bobby.\n\nMEFISTO (Czechoslovakia)\n\nSee Volume 3, page 1359 (Mefistos) for biographical info. Also this blog for correct info regarding the band name.\n\nRock And Roll Music (2:19) 2003\n\nSweet Little Sixteen (3:16) 2003\n\nCD: Mefisto Rock’n’Roll Vol. 2 [Areca Multimedia AM 80215-2] ● Czech Replublic, 2004\n\nJohnny B. Goode ( : ) 1989 (live)\n\nLittle Queenie ( : ) 1989 (live)\n\nRoll Over Beethoven ( : ) 1989 (live)\n\nSweet Little Sixteen ( : ) 1989 (live)\n\n2 CD: Mefisto Stoy 1964-1992 [Saturn KK-0353-2] ● Czech Replublic, 2011\n\nRecorded live at KD Eden, Praha 26 October 1989. Here they also do a live version of the instrumental tribute “I Like Chuck Berry” between Johnny B. and Queenie.\n\nReelin’ And Rockin’ ( : ) 1992 (live)\n\n2 CD: Mefisto Stoy 1964-1992 [Saturn KK-0353-2] ● Czech Replublic, 2011\n\nRecorded live at Letni Kino, Praha 3 May 1992.\n\nMEK & THE X-MAX PEKS (Denmark)\n\nOle Ballund aka Mek Pek (vocals), Mika Vandborg (guitar), Kim Nekroman (bass), Jens Daugaard (drums).\n\nRun Rudolph Run (2:36) 2000\n\nCD: Mek & The X.Mas Peks [Kick Music KICKCD-118] ● Denmark, 2000\n\nA little heavy rockabilly rendition of this classic.\n\nEDDIE MESA With THE HI-JACKS (Philippines)\n\nEduardo de Mesa Eigenmann was born in 1940. As Eddie Mesa he’s known as a Filipino singer and actor. He was at a time famous as “the Elvis Presley of the Philippines” because of his impersonation of the man. Later on he moved to the USA and eventually saw the light...\n\nRoll Over Beethoven (2:21) 1970\n\n45: Scoop Records SP-116 ● Philippines, 1970\n\nRAPHAEL MEYNER & The Sleep Workers (West Germany)\n\nRoll Over Beethoven ( : ) 1971\n\n45: Life Records St 71 310 ● West Germany, 1971\n\nIt’s not easy when you find absolutely nothing about this artist on the net.\n\nMIKO (Japan)\n\nMieko Hirota, female singer who was born in Tokyo 1947, died in 2020. She was very popular and regarded as a dynamic and great singer. Her first album came in 1961 and she’s had a lot of them throughout the years.\n\nRock And Roll Music ( : ) 1971\n\n2-LP: Rock Rock [Columbia JPW-37-38] ● Japan, 1971\n\nNot sure if she sings in English or Japanese on this one.\n\nMIRABELLO 3 (Italy)\n\nPop trio, one girl, two boys. But they have additional musicians on board.\n\nRock And Roll Music [Italian lyrics] (2:28) 1977\n\nLP: Chi Porta Giù Questo Cane? [Intingo ITLM-14501] ● Italy, 1977\n\nMIRROR IMAGE ( USA)\n\nBack In The USA (2:54) 1980\n\nLP: Performs The Songs Of Linda Ronstadt [Pickwick SPC-3745] ● USA, 1980\n\nThe more correct title here would have been Performs The Hits Of … Anyway, if you look at the entry by Platinum Players on this blog performing Back In The USA, released on a Pickwick LP in ’79, it wouldn’t surprise me if it is actually the same version. Although I don’t know for sure as I haven’t heard either one. Do I really have to?\n\nMISSING MOONLIGHTERS (USA)\n\nActually called The Moonlighters, who had an album out in 1977 and another in 1983. Country-rock group, led by vocalist and guitarist Bill Kirchen (page 1292).\n\nLet It Rock (3:36) mid 1980s (live)\n\nOh What A Thrill (4:05) mid 1980s (live)\n\n2-CD: Live / Studio Closet Tapes [Globe Records GLO-037] ● USA, 2008\n\nAll tracks are previously unissued. The studio ones were recorded at various places in California. And the live ones? Well it was recorded at various night clubs in the San Francisco Bay area, but nothing is mentioned when it happened? Irritating. However, “Let It Rock” is a good country-rock version with solid bass and beat and after 2 minutes with an interesting interlude. “Oh What A Thrill” works just as good. You can listen to the entire album on You Tube.\n\nMISSING SOULS (France)\n\nBeat/soul band from Lyon. Ian Kapoudjian (guitar, vocals), Ricky Bilbao (organ, bass), Zaza Sharps (vocals, bass, tambourine), Lester Mizzi (drums).\n\nI’m Talking About You (2:02) 2015\n\nLP/CD: The Missing Souls [Dangerhouse Skylab DSL-009] ● France, 2016\n\nELIZABETH MITCHELL (USA)\n\nMulti-instrumentalist, it seems she plays any kind of everything with a sound to it. Looking at the amount of musicians who participated on the album below, it would probably take a page. The whole album is aimed at children.\n\nSchool Day (3:43) 2006-2009\n\nCD: Sunny Day [Smithsonian Folkways SFW CD-45064] ● USA, 2010\n\nRecorded 2006–2009 at On-Me Sound, Mount Tremper, New York. The vocals on the Berry track is by Charlotte Constan. She’s also singing on “Mystery Train”, the other only rock’n’roll song included on the album. Good education for children nevertheless.\n\nMOHAIR SWEETS (Canada)\n\nColin Bryce, singer, songwriter, keyboardist, guitarist. Russ Kroeker ( bass) and Greg Gardner (drums). Bryce is regarded as being punk-rocker from the late ‘70s and from 1997-2007 the man behind Mohair Sweets print and webzine. As far as I can tell they have five CD EPs out from 2014-2018.\n\nYou Never Can Tell ( : ) 2017\n\nCD EP: The Ronnie Lane Tribute EP [Mohair Sweets Mohair #03] ● Canada, 2017\n\nWell, Ronnie Lane himself did perform this song on almost all of his concerts, so people connected to his music think it is a proper choice to include this Berry classic. (See Ronnie Lane on page 1305)\n\nMONTE CARLOS (USA)\n\nCountry-rock quintet, Billy Cioffi (vocals, guitars), Michael Clark (vocals, keyboards), Philip Krawzak (saxophone), Will MacGregor (bass), Kirk Arthur Trachsel (drums).\n\nYou Can’t Catch Me (3:24) 1994\n\nCD: Monte Carlos [B.T. Puppy Records BTP-055222-2] ● USA, 1994\n\nMONTROSE (USA)\n\n1970s hard rock band from California led by founding member Ronnie Montrose. They had four albums out on Warner Bros. from 1973 to 1976.\n\nRoll Over Beethoven (3:39) 1974\n\n2-CD: Paper Money [Warner Brothers R2 557788] ● USA, 2017 (DeLuxe Edition)\n\nCD 1 is the original “Paper Money” LP from 1974. CD 2 contains a previously unissued (incl. R.O.B.) KSAN Radio Session, Record Plant, Sausalito, California, 26 December 1974.\n\nMOODY BROTHERS (USA)\n\nWe already have this group on the blog, however, I have added this new cover.\n\nRun Rudolph Run (2:43) 1987\n\nCD: Home For The Holidays [Intersound Digital CHD-1502] ● Canada, 1991\n\nRecorded at Lamon Sound Studios, Charlotte, North Carolina in October 1987.\n\nGARY MOORE (UK)\n\nSee Volume 3, page 1373 for biographical info.\n\nThirty Days (3:15) 2007 (live)\n\nCD: Live At Bush Hall 2007 [Eagle Records ER-203672] ● USA, 2014\n\nThis album was released all over EU, Australia and Japan. Later re-issued in EU on a 2-LP set in 2019. I like this live version better than the studio one.\n\nR. STEVIE MOORE (USA)\n\nRobert Steven Moore, born 1952 in Nashville. Son of Bob Moore, the famous studio bass player. Stevie is sometimes called the Godfather of Home Recording and one of the most recognized of the cassette underground. Rumor has it that he has\n\nrecorded around 400 (yes four hundred) self-released albums, but also several albums released on various labels (mostly compilations).\n\nHavana Moon (3:03) 2016\n\nCD: Lids & Blankets: A Covers Collection Vol.1 [Stevie Moore self-released] ● USA, 2016\n\nOk, but a little predictable and boring.\n\nMOTIFS (UK)\n\nObscure Liverpool beat group active on Merseyside during the 1960s. A trio formed by former members of The Del Renas.\n\nAll Aboard ( : ) 1963\n\nVarious CD: Beat Waves ‘Cross The Mersey Vol. 2 [Merseyside Records Me-1002] ● UK, 2012\n\nPreviously unissued. Recorded 1963, so this will have to be the very first cover of this rather obscure Berry song, first available on the “Chuck Berry On Stage” album that came out in England October 1963."
