        "text": "The following material on the Dalaker farm is a composite of material written by Rudolph L. Dalager, son of Nels Dalager, describing his trip to the Dalaker farm and the Sogndal area in Norway in the early 1930’s, and my trip with Phyllis to this same area in 1991. Rudolph and my father, Karl Dalager, were first cousins.\n\nAs we cross the Sognefjord we see the beautiful pine covered mountains and the many small hay meadows (click to see map). All tillable land is utilized. We land at Kaupanger which is on the north shore of the Sognefjord. As we take the road to Sogndal, it is not long before we see the old Kaupanger Church where Anfin, Hans, Nils, Brita and Lasse, the children of Guri & Sylfaest Dalager were baptized and confirmed. In the graveyard next to the church can be found the grave markers for Lasse, the brother who stayed in Norway and his son Andreas. In some unmarked grave lies the body of Solfest, the father and husband who died before Brita and Guri left for America.\n\nAs we traveled along the good black topped road on our way to Sogndal, we saw a sign pointing off to the right with the word ‘Dalaker’ (dal-valley, aker-cultivated fields). This would indicate that the tract of land was quite level and that the family was comfortably situated.\n\nWith the modern automobile, it did not take long for us to reach Dalaker. Rudolph described his path to Dalaker as a strenuous up-hill walk. The farm is located very high up and from it we have a magnificent view of the Sognefjord and the surrounding mountain peaks. The Dalaker farm is set amidst the beautiful Kaupang Forest.\n\nWhen Rudolph visited the Dalaker farm in the 1930’s he found that the house was like the pictures he had seen with some modernization. It was not a large house but was strongly built. Rudolph was told that the doors and some of the furniture and inside conveniences dated back to his father Nils’ time. He could reflect that his grandparents, Solfest and Guri–whose maiden name was Hostager—had lived here and that all the children were born here except Lasse. Lasse, the one who remained in Norway, was born at Amla, which is closer to Kaupanger. It was Lasse’s children Guri and Olav who accompanied Rudolph to Dalaker and who he later visited in Olso.\n\nWhen Phyllis and I visited in 1991 there were no Dalakers living at Dalaker; however, the buildings were in very good condition. We enjoyed a light lunch with the new owners and were able to experience the view that our ancestors were a part of every day of their lives. The Dalaker setti, which was located further up the mountains where the milkmaid stayed at night during the summer, is now a part of the area museum. The three pictures of the buildings on the Dalaker farm which accompany this piece were provided by Aasmund Dalaker, a grandson of Lasse Dalaker.\n\nWhen Rudolph and his party returned to Kaupanger, they walked the road that our grandparents must have walked hundreds of times. Along the road they saw farms like Hostager (Guri’s maiden name), Olstad, Bjork, Holten. The father of Henry Holten of Glenwood, Minnesota, came from that farm. Henry Holten and Hans Dalager were 1st cousins. This was also the berry season and the walkers in Rudolph’s party enjoyed berries such as lingonberry as they walked. The walk to Kaupanger took about one hour.\n\nIn historic Norway, the eldest son would inherit the farm. Therefore, Sylfaest Lassesen must have been the oldest son of Lasse Bottolfsen Hagen. Sylfaest was born March 4, 1797 and baptized February 26, 1800. Sylfaest married Guri Anfindsdatter Hostager, baptized November 15, 1806, the daughter of Anfind Anfindson Hostager on March 19, 1833 . To this marriage five children were born: Anfin, born May 15, 1834; Lasse, born April 3, 1837; Hans Solfest, born November 5, 1842; Nils, born December 11, 1846; Brita, who became known as Betsy, born August 7, 1851. Solfest is the Americanized form of Sylfaest. However, records attach the name Dalaker to Guri’s family indicating that Guri may have inherited Dalaker farm where she and Sylfaest lived..\n\nAccording to tradition, Anfin should have inherited the Dalaker farm. However, he decided to come to America to seek his fortune. Therefore the farm went to Lasse, the second oldest son. Anfin and Hans were the first from this family to come to America crossing the ocean in a sailing vessel in 1861.\n\nAfter arriving at Quebec, Hans and Anfin made their way by river boat and wagon to Wisconsin\n\nby Lavilla Dalager Peterson\n\nMy father was born in Bergenstift, Indre, Sogn, Norway on November 5, 1842. He was the third son of Mr. and Mrs. Solfest Dalager. His brothers were Anfin, Lasse, and Nils. He had one sister Brita. Anfin, who was the oldest, came to America when Hans did in 1858. Anfin was so sold on becoming an American that he looked at America as his homeland and even gave up his birthright in Norway. When these two boys, 21 & 16 years old stopped in Wisconsin they went to a meeting where they were asking for volunteers for service against the Indians. Anfin volunteered. He became ill shortly after and spent the rest of his life (maybe two years) with a couple who cared for him.\n\nDad went on to Goodhue County, Minnesota where he worked for an aunt and uncle-in-law. He worked here for several years. He was paid a few pounds of wool for this work. Another cousin of his made him a pair of stockings from the wool. During the winters he worked in the pine forests near St. Cloud and Little Falls. After the Indian scare was over he filed a claim for a homestead in Pope County in 1866. His homestead was issued by President U. S. Grant October 1, 1873. His homestead is where Herman Dalager now lives.\n\nHans was married to Ingeborg Knutson in 1871. The following children were born to them. Jenny Grove, Christine Houston, Julia Solverud Knutson, Hannah Johnson, and Karl Dalager. Fifteen years later, in 1886, Ingeborg died.\n\nHans Dalager’s brother Nils, his sister Brita and his mother who was widowed came to Pope County from Norway. Brita lost her husband by accident and she and grandma Guri Dalager, Mrs. Solfest Dalager, later moved to Webster, South Dakota. Here Hans’ mother, Guri, lost her life in a prairie fire. She had gone to the barn to same the animals and was overcome by fumes. This was in 1886. Brita was saved by jumping into a shallow well but she was so badly burned she was in a wheel chair the rest of her life.\n\nBrita had three children: Andrew, Julia and Sophia.\n\nNils Dalager settled in Pope County. He has passed on. He left many boys who carry his name, son at Benton Harbor, Mich. and in California.\n\nIn 1888 Hans married Amelia Bentrud. To them were given 10 children: Tillie, Cora, William, Selmer, Alice, Herman, Lavilla, Lucille, Helen and Alma who died in 1908 at the age of 8 years.\n\nHans died at his home in Chippewa Falls Township of cancer. He was 68 years old at the time. He was buried at the Barsness Lutheran Church Cemetery.\n\nHans Sylfestsen Dalager was born November 5, 1842 in Sogndal, Norway and baptized in the Sogndal Lutheran Church, Sogn og Fjordan County, Norway. His parents were Solfest Lassesen and Guri Anfindsdatter Hostager. Solfest and Guri owned or worked on a tract of land known as ‘Dalaker.’ Hans had three brothers, Anfin, Lasse, and Nels and one sister, Brita.\n\nIf the Dalager ancestors had followed the Norwegian naming tradition when they came to America, Hans and Anfin would have been Solfestsen. However, they took the name of the farm, Dalaker, and changed it to Dalager. The Dalagers we know in Norway such as Aasmund and Molfrid still are known as Dalaker.\n\nThe Sogndal church records showing those leaving the parish in the year 1861 lists Hans Solfestsen, born November 5, 1842. No listing was found for Anfin but family tradition says that they traveled together by sailing ship. Prof. Gerhard B. Naeseth, genealogist for the Vesterheim Genealogical Library in Madison, Wisconsin, who did this research, felt that in 1861 Hans and Anfin most likely would have travaeled up the St. Lawrence River, through Quebec. Prof. Naeseth could not check the ship passenger list because lists were not retained in Quebec until 1865. The 1861 sailing date for Hans disagrees with the date found in some writing by some of the family but Prof. Naeseth sent a copy of the record confirming the 1861 date.\n\nPassengers on sailing ships in 1861 had to provide their own provisions and almost all the passengers exhausted their food supplies before reaching America. According to Julia Dalager Chilson, Anfind and Hans had a chest of Lefsa and flatbrod on the ship which they shared with the rest of the passengers.\n\nAfter arriving at Quebec, Hans and Anfin made their way by river boat and wagon to Wisconsin. Here they went to a meeting where they were asking for volunteers for service against the Indians. Anfin was so sold on becoming an American that he looked at America as his homeland and even gave up his birthright in Norway. Here was a chance for him to serve his new country so he volunteered.\n\nPrivate Anfin Dalaker\n\nFrom Wanamingo, Minnesota<\n\nGoodhue County\n\nEnlisted August 22, 1862 at Fort Snelling, MN\n\nMustered into Company D, 10th Regiment of Minnesota\n\nInfantry Volunteers Oct 9, 1862\n\nHonorably discharged for disability Sept 14, 1863 at Fort Goodhue, MN\n\nAnfin was involved in the Indian wars and was stationed at Fort Sisseton in the Dakota Territory. Due to lack of proper clothing and frozen feet, Anfin contracted tuberculosis and was discharged. He spent the rest of his life with a couple and died March 17, 1864, leaving Hans alone in the U.S. at the age of 22. Anfin had been a very thrifty soldier and after all the expenses of his illness, death and burial were cared for, he left an estate of about $200.00 to his younger brother Hans.\n\nHans stayed with his uncle and aunt, the Hostagers, in Goodhue County of south eastern Minnesota for about two years, working for his keep. He was paid a few pounds of wool for his work\n\nAnother cousin made his stockings from the wool which Hans needed when he worked in the pinery woods and lumber camps in the St. Cloud and Little Falls area of Minnesota during the winters.\n\nBetween 1866 & 1868, after the Indian scare was over, using the money he had inherited from Anfin plus his savings from the lumber camp work, Hans fulfilled his dream when he filed a claim for 160 acres of land under the Homestead Act. This land was the NE 1/4 of section 12 in Barsness township, about six and a half miles south of the present sight of Glenwood, Minnesota. Ulysses S. Grant was President. Hans’ patent, homestead papers signed by President Grant, were issued Oct 1, 1873, five years after the original homestead. This is the farm that was farmed by Herman Dalager and later by Orville Feigum.\n\nHans broke some land and built a log house and a stable. Leaving the farm in the care of a neighbor, Hans went back to Goodhue County for a visit. While he was gone his house, stable and two mules were burned by a prairie fire. He became rather discouraged and left for a lumber camp near St. Cloud for the winter. However, when spring came, he returned to his homestead, rebuilt his building and started over again.\n\nHans and one of his neighbors would help each other break new land. This neighbor said Hans had the speediest oxen he had ever seen. He also said the mosquitoes were so bad he could not sleep, but Hans did not mind them at all and he would sleep all night. During this time in the late 1860’s, the nearest town was St. Cloud, about 70 miles away. Sometimes Hans would walk to town and return carrying flour and other necessary things on his back. Sometimes he would use oxen but they were very slow. A trip to St. Cloud would take four or five days. One time when Hans and a neighbor were returning from St. Cloud, it started to rain. They stopped, removed the produce from the box, turned the wagon box upside down and sat under it until the rain was over and arrived home without getting wet. It is unclear whether they had oxen pulling a wagon or they were pushing a two wheeled cart with a box on it.\n\nAbout 1870, the town of Benson was established. It was now possible to shop and haul grain to the railroad there. It was 25 miles away and the trip could be made in two days. Hans was one of the first to buy horses and to build a barn with a hayloft. People came from miles around to see his barn.\n\nIngeborg Knudson, also known as Isabelle, was born August 8, 1848. In the Nord-Aurdal records she is listed as the daughter of Knud Lagesen Gjeldemarken and Ingeborg Syversdatter. In the Sor-Aurdal records, Ingeborg Syversdatter was born October 6, 1823 and her wedding to Knud Lagesen Gjeldemarken took place on June 17, 1847. The death record of Knud, found in the Nord-Aurdal records, recorded his death on April 24, 1853, at the age of 34 years. Ingeborg would have been less than 5 years old at the time. She had no known brothers or sisters. From family records it is known that Ingeborg came to the St. Cloud area when she was 12 years old, about the year 1860. It is uncertain who she traveled with or how long she lived in the St. Cloud area. However, Hans and Ingeborg may have first met in this area.\n\nThe 1870 federal census for Barsness township, Pope County, lists family #10 as Lars Larson (age 45), Ingeborg (age 47) and Isabelle (age 21). Hans Dalager was listed as family #12 in this same census report. The age for Ingeborg (47) would be right for Ingeborg Syversdatter who had been married ot Knud Lageson Gjellemaken and the age for Isabelle (21) would be right for Ingeborg Isabelle Knudson, if the census was taken in the spring before her 22 birthday on Aug. 8, 1870. This indicates that Lars Larson was most likely Ingeborg’s step father and his wife, Ingeborg, was her mother. To further support this the Nord-Aurdal records record the marriage, on Dec 29, 1853, of Lars Larson Anmarken, age 27, son of Lars Knudsen, to Ingeborg Syversdatter, age 30, the mother of Ingeborg Isabelle.\n\nLars Larson’s homestead document lists his quarter of land as the SE 1/4 of section 12 of Barsness township and Hans Dalager’s homestead document lists his quarter of land as the NE 1/4 of section 12 of Barsness township. Therefore Lars’ and Hans’ homestead quarters adjoined each other.\n\nOn July 7, 1871 Hans married Ingeborg (Isabelle) Knudson Larson. Following their marriage, Hans & Ingeborg settled on the groom’s homestead. The following children were born to them: Jennie (Mrs. J. O. Grove), Sophia (Mrs. Theodore Ogdahl), Christine (Mrs. George Houston), Solfest (who died at the age of 2 years of convulsions while teething), Julia (Mrs. Solverud Knutson), Henry (who died as a baby), Hannah (Mrs. P. O. C. Johnson), Louise (who died as a baby), Karl Theodore, and Martin (who died at the age of two months of blood poison contracted from his mother). Ingeborg, the mother of the above children died of blood poisoning six days after the birth of Martin. She was 38 years old when she died January 5, 1887.\n\nSome of the characteristics of the Dalager children, as described by Julia would be physical stamina. This is illustrated by the long lives of those who lived through infancy. Their mother, on her death bed, requested that her children be given a chance for an education. Four of the girls in the family followed the role of teachers. The following Bible verse, written in Norwegian, is recorded on Ingeborg’s gravestone in the Barsness Lutheran Church Cemetery.\n\nLuke 18:16 Let the little children come to me and forbid them not,\n\nfor the kingdom of God belongs to such."
