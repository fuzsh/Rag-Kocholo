        "text": "We believe marketing is broken. And we‚Äôre here to fix it. Conversion rates in digital marketing are ridiculously low. Also, only 15% of people connect an ad to the correct sender brand. We at Brinna start by solving the most pressing problem in the industry: good quality ad versioning with speed. This is what the Brinna for Photoshop plugin does. Read more about what we do and become one of the first test users of the plugin! Link in comments. üì∏ Maria √ñstlin #marketing #conversionrates #branding #startup\n\nRunning the content agency Starlings, it really frustrated me that there were no good design tools for versioning of digital ads, i.e. being able to quickly, easily and above all automatically make hundreds of variants with different content. And at a reasonable cost. Now this is what we do in Brinna. Sign up on our waitlist at www.brinna.co if you want to be one of our first users. Or contact me if you want to become an early tester right away and be involved in the development of the product - super valuable to us! üåºüôè\n\n130-150 - that is an average number of SaaS applications per company. There‚Äôs been a 5x increase over a period of 3 years and 10x since 2015 ‚ùó When you add a new tool to your company‚Äôs tech stack, you get more complexity, integration challenges, costs, not to mention that things might slow down or bring into security headaches. That is why Brinna does not want to add on to the tech stack. Instead, we leverage on the tools that marketing and branding professionals already use and love. Our Photoshop plugin slots right into the designers' existing setup. And let‚Äôs them shine without ever having to step out of the tool they are already using. Are you a Photoshop user? Or have Photoshop users in your team? Reach out to become the first test users of our plugin that does the versioning/scaling of assets in minutes instead of hours. #startup #techstack #saas\n\nNaming a company. One of the most difficult yet fun decisions in the early days. This is the story behind our name, Brinna. As branding and marketing are our passion and business, it was important that our name communicates this. The process started with playing with the word brand. The English word brand actually exists in the same writing form in Swedish language, meaning fire. From fire we went into ideating words to do with flames, hot, and burning. That led to the verb to burn in Swedish, which is brinna. There is also a fun fact and connection between burning and branding. Branding began (approx around 2 700 BCE) with the practice of cattle owners marking [branding] their cattle with the owner‚Äôs sign by using a heated iron. In addition, we think that Brinna has a nice Scandinavian sound and vibe; our roots and heritage are important to us. And if we are totally honest here, our first work-in-progress startup name‚Äôs .com domain was already taken. Therefore, we had the burning need to come up with a new name. üòÄ That‚Äôs how we became Brinna."
