Streaming is good in addition to live concerts in the future and especially nice for those who can´t make it to a concert hall. Many musicians this year have missed the interaction with an audience from behind the cameras. Still Zilliacus is happy that Korsholm Musid Festival could be arranged under the circumstances and with such good quality of the concerts. ”In general the festival has done well, this was planned, when we finally took the decision\" says director Johnson. We have learned the secrets of streaming! The personal encounters between audience and musicians is a loss, though. That is what makes the excitement of the festival.\n\nNext year the festival is arranged 28.7 - 4.8 2021!\n\nPart of the artists that was cancelled this year due to Covid-19, will come next summer.
