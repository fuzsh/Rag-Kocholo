The $50.000 Lange Trophy, which was held for the first three years in Vail, was by far its most prestigious trophy, and the largest purse as a typically magnificent gesture by Bob Lange\n\nA Mason Beekley Tribute: Mason Beekley, ISHA’s Founding President and constant benefactor during its first decade of existence died on August 20, occasioning an outpouring of letters to the journal from Associates, family and friends. The letters are gathered here in tribute, including letters from his sister Frannie, his four daughters, Liza-Lee, Sayre, Lauri and Francie, and from John Fry, the acting president of ISHA, and members of the ISGHA board of directors, and the Heritage editorial board.\n\nReaders’ Response: The lead letter from a perplexed reader asks if this the future of the sport, referring to two pictures submitted with the letter taken from Vanity Fair, one of extreme skier Glenn Plake with his two-foot high hairdo, and another of two snowboard pioneers— Sherman Poppen, inventor of the Snurfer, and Jake Burton Carpenter, designer of the breakthrough Burton Board. On the grounds that Vanity Fair celebrates the falling of Aspen into the arms of snowboarding forwarding the notion that snowboarders and extreme skiers are now ruling the roost.\n\nOther letters: John Fry, Internationalism vs. Americanism on the lack of success ISHA has had abroad; John Clendenin: Ski Dek is Alive and Well, on the use of the Ski Dek as a learning aid for the Aspen Ski School; Allen Adler: A Ski Patrol is A Ski Patrol Is a Ski Patrol, on the very different modes in which pioneer ski patrols took on their first duties; Wolfie Lert, The So-So Patrol, on an early hairy ride down the mountain as tail gunner on a patrol toboggan carrying an injured skier.\n\nFurther letters—Barry ZeVann: A Man Named Zdarsky, on his trip to Lilienfeld, home of the stem turn and its inventor, Mathias Zdarsky; J. Vernon Lamb: an aluminum ski pole inventor in early Lake Placid days; Wolfgang Lert: A Girl Named Katy, submitting an early picture of Bogner stretch pants in action, displayed by U.S. Team Member Katy Rudolph; Kirby Gilbert: A Coach Named Wolfie, submitting a clipping of Wolfgang Lert’s early career as a UCLA ski coach;\n\nOther letters—Luanne Pfeifer corrects the sequence of her book, Gretchen’s Gold and Dick Durrance’s Man on a Medal; an Illusionary Cup, showing two graphics, one photo with a chairlift rider waving, the other a coffee ad with a cup inserted in the rider’s hand;\n\nOn the final page: a series of letters praising the ISHA website, and Joyce Harringtton’s memento of her father’s career in organized skiing.\n\nCover Story: The Empire That Exploded: Bob Lange and the Plastic Boot—original research by the Editor who authored the piece, about his discovery that Bob Lange more or less faked his way through four years when he was first designing the plastic boot. His engineering was inspired but the manufacturing did not get underway until five years after he had first had reps scouring the field for orders. The name of the boot got out alright, but not the boots.\n\nIn 1965, Success came in a rush, propelled by skiers riding to victory on Lange boots, and Bob made up for lost time, building a ski, ski boot and skate empire that expanded at an astounding rate. Then came the fatal technical flow in Lange-flo, the liner that made the boot bearable. It broke through the lining and over 100,000 boots had to be replaced. This sent Lange Co. into a financial tailspin from which it never recovered, and the empire disintegrated, and the future evaporated.\n\nMovers and Shakers: Where They Are Now: A new feature, in this case rounding up the “Lange Alumni,” fellow workers with Bob Lange in his ascent to the top, namely Morrie Shepard, Nick Hock, Peter Kennedy, Dave Jacobs and Ian Ferguson.\n\nThe Skiers’ Bookshelf: the lead review by ISHA president John Fry gives top marks to The Trail Breakers, a story of the pioneer Red Birds of Montreal, a ski club of the alumni of McGill University ski teams. The Red Birds were, by a year, the first downhill ski club in North America. They were the first on the continent to hold an official Kandahar. As a lifetime Red Bird himself, Fry notes that old Red Birds penetrated the sport in Canada and the U.S. in their day.\n\nThe Story of Aspen, reviewed by the Editor, is a re-issue somewhat enlarged of Mary Hayes’ earlier boo, of the same name, who has added a touching thumbnail history of the social underpinnings of the town.\n\nSki and Snow Country, the Editor says, is a book of stunning black and white photographs of the late great mountain photographer Ray Atkeson, annotated by pioneer ski cinematographer Warren Miller.\n\nThe Big Jump at Dartmouth: a memoir by early Dartmouth ski team member Dave Bradley, a noted American author. He writes of the life and times of the big jump at Dartmouth—once the biggest in the East&Mac226;making the case for college jumping though it was dropped long ago now. Bradley takes the reader on the psychological thriller that is a jump on a big hill. He leaves every reader, even one who have never jumped, an understanding why men hurl themselves into the void in an ultimate test of nerve.\n\nThe American Museums—The First U.S. Ski Congress: the backstory of the coming of a great history writers’ gathering in the United States by Academic ski historian John Allen, chairman of the academic committee of the congress and Skiing Heritage’s columnist. The initiative for the event was taken by the Editor. John Allen took charge from there with much help from skisport promoter Bernie Weichsel, who had the ear of the proper parties at Park City, where the Congress will be held right before the Utah Olympics in February 2002.\n\nThree outstanding European historians are scheduled to present papers: Max Triet, Director of the Swiss Sports Museum at Basl, Dr. Bernard Morgen, Professor of American Studies at George Washington University, author of the recent Snow in America, and Dr. Matti Goksøyr, professor at the Norwegian Sports University in Oslo. Some forty papers will be given—and be bound in a book that will be published by ISHA.\n\nRemembering—a new feature, looking back at the lives of notable skiers who, as of recent date, are no longer with us: Skeeter Werner, onetime U.S. team member in the 1950s (along with her famous brother Buddy Werner). Sverre Engen, of the celebrated Engen brothers, jumpers all—two of them, Sverre and Alf, took up residence in the Utah mountains outside Salt Lake City to make this area (the next Olympic venue) the U.S. hotbed of jumping, powder skiing and avalanche control. Hal Codding, a superb racer and instructor who drifted west from Woodstock, Vermont, to settle at Reno, Nevada, and open a notable ski shop, became, as writer Dick Dorworth records, his mentor and hero, the man around whom the Reno ski world centered. Kay Reed, wife and indispensable partner of Carroll Reed, who founded the first official Arlberg Ski School in the East and the first elite ski shop in the country, a branch of Saks Fifth Avenue at North Conway, New Hampshire. Later, the couple’s Carroll Reed Shops became an outstanding chain for skiwear and outerwear, and the name Carroll Reed an emblem of quality and distinction.\n\nLongthongs and Short Tales: What Men Are Good For: another Abby Rand classic humor column, this one on the battle of the sexes on near the slopes circa 1960.\n\nFourth Issue 2001 (December) Vol 13 #4\n\nCover: AGerman poster for the 1936 Olympic Games at Garmisch-Partenkirschen; The artist cleverly served his masters and avoided controversy over the athlete’s salute on the poster. The Olympic salute was with the arm stretched to the side, palm down, while German salute, mandated after the Nazi Party came to power, was with the arm high and in front and palm facing forward The artist split the difference in arm position and kept the hand out of the picture, impossible to determine whether it was facing front or facing down.\n\nThe President’s Letter: John Fry, the new ISHA president, announces the joining of two efforts: Skiing Heritage is to become the official publication of the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame and Museum, of Ishpeming,, Michigan as well as the official publication of ISHA. The letter also announces ISHA’s participation in the International Ski History Congress at Park City, Utah three weeks before the 2002 Olympic Games are held there.\n\nReaders’ Response: Skiing Heritage’s letters column is headed by a portrait of the founding president, the late Mason Beekley, taken from the cover of a memorial service program given out at the event, held October 14 at his home in New Hartford. There are three pages of letters recalling memories of Mason; the first is by John Moore of the Aspen Historical Society. The others were signed by Alan Engen, of the Alf Engen Ski Museum; Bob Fisher, an old acquaintance, and Sandra Heath of the New England Ski Museum. The next few pages are devoted to those responding to the article on the late Bob Lange, inventor of the plastic ski boot, in the Third Issue 2001. There are letters from Lange’s wife Vidie, from David Luennsman, who was his first employee in the boot business; Peter Kennedy who was an ally in marketing Lange boots; Dave Jacobs, a board member at Lange boots; by John Auran, onetime editor at Skiing, who disputed some of the statements in the article; Nick Hock, onetime sales manager for Lange boots, Will Lund, who wore Lange’s first boot with the inner flo material that broke down, Allen Adler, USSA Historian and Hall of Fame board member, who writes he was unable to wear Langes when they came out; Bunny Bass, a pioneer U. S. bootmaker Other letters on a variety of subjects came from Cindy Murin, daughter of Hall Codding whose obituary ran in the previous issue; Michael Brady, ISHA’s man in Oslo, on the various spellings of akvavitt, Norway’s national drink; Paul McMorris notes that New Hampshire is claiming Black Mountain as the oldest ski area in the state in spite of the fact that two other New Hampshire resorts had lifts before Black Mountain and two had lifts at the same time.\n\nFeature: The Historic First Four Games, 1924-36 The introduction notes that the early Olympics were nothing like the modern spectacles and that before a Winter Olympics could be held, there had to be facilities for ski racing and ski jumping as a start. And the resistance of the Scandinavian countries to international ski events held at resorts had to be overcome.\n\nThe first section, Birth Pangs of the Olympics tells how France became the first nation with resort facilities for jumping and touring, that the first Olympics was held in Chamonix only after Chamonix had hosted a series of national and international ski events. The second section describes the First Winter Olympics at Chamonix, and the fact that it was not at the time considered an official winter Olympics. The Norwegians took eleven of the twelve medals offered, all in jumping and cross country, having gotten a hundred-year head start in the sport, having invented jumping competitions and cross country racing during the 1800s. There is a discussion of the later movement to transfer the bronze medal in the special jump to U.S. jumper Anders Haugen, who had been victim of a mathematical error in the scoring that gave the bronze to the Norwegian, Thorleif Haug. The third section describes the Second Winter Games, held at St. Moritz in 1928 after the Norwegians narrowly voted to join after feeling betrayed because the 1924 meet had been declared by the International Olympic Committee as the first official Winter Olympics after the meet was over. The American team was woefully unprepared with slapdash arrangements for transportation and uniforms. But they nevertheless Rolf Monson came in sixth in the jump and Charley Proctor 14th, as the sole native born American in the Olympics. The newly-founded sport of alpine skiing was excluded, but in the same year, the first popular international alpine combined meet was held at St. Anton, foretelling the end of the dominance at the Games of cross country and jumping. The fourth section is on the first-ever U.S. Winter Olympics, held at Lake Placid, New York, run essentially by the Lake Placid Club, which had been holding winter sports events for nearly a generation, notably the annual college circuit championships it had held since 1921. But it was still essentially a private club and only the modest number of contests were being held a series of contests well within the club’s capacity to hold. The fifth section details the events of the Fourth Winter Olympics, held at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, in 1936. This was the first Winter Games in which international and national politics had a strong hand. Germany aimed to use the Games as a platform to advertise its progress under the banner of the Nazi Party and Adolph Hitler. The English speaking countries resisted to some extent. It was the first Games to have a huge opening ceremony. For the first time, the Americans had an outside chance of winning a medal in skiing. Our top contender, Dick Durrance , who had been raised in Garmisch, did not better than 10th in the combined, after a questionable official penalty. The combined medals were the only medals awarded in alpine skiing. The U.S. women’s alpine team was the brainchild of Alice Kiaer, who raised the funds, picked the team, hired a coach and supervised the training. The best women’s result was Betsy Woolsey’s 19th. Norway’s Birger Ruud was the hero of the Games, coming in first in the jumping and first in the downhill, the only Olympian ever to score in both Olympic nordic and alpine events.\n\nMover and Shaker: Gretl Uhl, famous in Aspen for her gourmet deli-on-the-mountain for a dozen years. Gretl was born in Garmisch, and emigrated to the U.S. with the help of Dick Durrance.\n\nClassic Skis: Skis have a Soul Rigo Thurmer writes of his first skis, which he bought in 1924 from Sporthaus Schuster in Munich. He goes on to tell of the succession of skis that he owned, including the Splitkeins that he had to give to the German war effort in World War II, and a counterfeit pair of Dynamics he bought on the black market after the war that turned out to be pine rather than hickory.\n\nMan on a White Charger: Ed Scott by Dick Dorworth. A longtime resident of Sun Valley, Dick Dorworth profiles the man who brought the modern aluminum ski pole into the world, a cantankerous, scrupulously honest citizen of Sun Valley whose contribution to the sport arose from his uncompromising search for the best in materials and construction.. Scott was also a leading activist in community affairs, among other things the most frequent and acerbic appearances in the local Ketchum newspaper letters columns.\n\nCondo Mania by Paul Hochman. a brief and humorous description of the coming of the condominiums to the sport, triggered by visionary Sun Valley and Snowmass developer Bill Janns. A government appraiser is quoted as summing the condo up, “T-111 plywood, board and batten siding, electric heat, multi-colored shag carpeting and avocado trim.”\n\nSkiers’ Bookshelf: First Tracks, a Century of Skiing in Utah by Alan Engen and Gregory Thompson, reviewed by Mike Korologos; a coffee table book with running text of the state whose early fascination with ski jumping and heavy support from Salt Lake citizens resulted in a ring of resorts in the Wasatch mountains including Alta and Park City, where the 2002 Olympics were held. Co-author Alan Engen is the son of Alf Engen, who as director of skiing came to personify the Alta ski school, the deep powder university for the nation’s skiers. Midwest Skiing, A Glance Back by John Pontti and Kenneth Luostari. A pictorial history of the heartland where skiing was born, had its first national headquarters and hall of fame reviewed by John Allen, the most well-known ski historian in the U.S., who faults some of the book’s priorities but enjoys the nostalgia. Snow In America by Bernard Mergen This is a different kind of ski history dealing with the social history of snow, the changing attitudes toward winter, and winter recreation and the part played by skiing n the changes. The author is a professor of American studies at George Washington University in D.C. Reviewed by the editor.

The lead story goes from his first assignment to cover Taylor back to the research he has done on the pre-Taylor history of the short ski, beginning with the five foot Zdarsky ski in Austria at the turn of the 1900s, and the first short short ski, which was the firngleiter, or spring snow ski of the mountaineering skiers, including one patented by Emo Henrich, the head of the Stratton Mountain ski school. Then the text covers the kurzki of the Kitzbuhel ski school in a program that began in the 1950s under Karl Kolller, after it had been explored by older Kitzbuhelers. The next short ski of note was the goon ski, invented by an Olympic figure skater Jimmy Madden, who designed it and used it around Mt. Cranmore in North Conway. Then enters the last and most influential short ski teacher, Clif Taykir if Brattleboro Vermont who with the aid of Ski Magazine started a movement that brought short ski director parallel teaching, known now as GLM or Graduated Length Method, to a dozen American resorts before it faded away, but its influence is still felt in the adoption of short “ski blades” for learning at a number of American ski school currently.\n\nTechnique and Teaching: Surviving Schrittbogen A memoir by Stu Campbell, longtime head of the Stowe Ski School and Ski Magazine technical editor on his days as a college racer in the turmoil of the “reverse revolution” of which schrittbogen was a part., a step turn that put racers in a reverse position..

A story on the U.S. ski manufacturing industry showing how the early American ski factories making hickory skis were replaced in the U.S. by Howard Head and his successors making aluminum skis, and then by the fiberglass skis. And although there were a dozen American ski makers who had come on the scene since the beginning, by the 1980s, all the existing ski makers were in trouble partly from overproduction and partly from the effects of globalization which sent the factories to third world countries both in the U.S and in Europe. The last attempt at U.S. ski making was set in motion by the Volant company, launched by Bucky Kashiwa. But eventually, Volant folded too under the pressure of third world competition. Currently there are no skis mass-produced in the U.S., and the few manufacturers are all boutique operations, like Steve Denker’s Evolution Skis in Salt Lake and former Head Ski chief designer John Howe’s Claw ski made in Maine.\n\nClassic Gear: Binding Revolution by Wolfgang Lert. An appreciation by veteran skier Wolfgang Lert of the revolutionary Huitfeldt binding invented in Norway in 1894, including the first-ever toe irons screwed to the ski itself, which set the concept later extended to a toe iron mortised directly through the ski. The binding was so sturdy that Amundsen chose it as the binding with which he became the first to ski to the North Pole. Combined with the Hoyer-Ellefsen lever heel strap buckle, its popularity lasted well through the 1920s and the principles of the toe iron fixed directly to the ski and lever tension for the heel strap was adapted by the most popular and universal binding in history, the Kandahar type binding in which the toe iron became a toe plate screwed directly to the top of the ski and the Ellefsen buckle became the front throw heel cable tensioning device.\n\nWhere Are They Now? by Seth Masia.
