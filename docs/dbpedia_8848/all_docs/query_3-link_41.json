        "text": "With a rematch of last year’s NBA Finals kicking off tonight, Rick Ross felt it was necessary to revisit a classic MMG song of theirs and re-“heat” it up.\n\nBefore the 2011 NBA Finals, Rozay celebrated his hometown Miami Heat making the championship by releasing the track “Finals” featuring Meek Mill and Gunplay.\n\nFast forward three years, and Rozay is back with the D. Rich-produced street banger “Finals 2”, only this time he substitutes Meek Mill for Wale, Gunplay, Rockie Fresh, Fat Trel, Tracy T, and French Montana.\n\nGive the encore a listen below, and let us know who you think had the hardest verse?\n\nQuotable Lyrics:\n\nRich niggas don't test drive\n\nAnd double M, that be the best high\n\nI let her count the cake up in my stash spot\n\nPut all her naked photos in my laptop\n\nWe got a bond that we could never break\n\nShe wash her hair with Bel Air, that pussy sweet as cake"
