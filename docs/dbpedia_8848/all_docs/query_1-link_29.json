        "text": "Fat Trel has been arrested again, less than two months after getting released from prison in October.\n\nAccording to an arrest docket obtained by XXL on Thursday (Dec. 9), Fat Trel, born Martrel Reeves, was arrested and booked at the Arlington County Sheriff's Office in Arlington, Va. on Wednesday (Dec. 8) on four counts of a Revocation of Suspended Sentence and Probation in connection to a 2018 arrest. Trel is currently in custody awaiting bond and has a court date scheduled for Jan. 14, 2022.\n\nThe details of the 2018 arrest he was picked up for are unclear.\n\nFat Trel was released from prison in October. The \"Large Amount\" rapper was initially arrested on July 8, 2018, in Upper Marlboro, Md. on a charge of a Gun Offender Fail to Register, but also has an arrest from Aug. 30, 2018, in Arlington, Va. It's uncertain if the cases are related.\n\nReports from July of 2018 include that police pulled over Trel in a vehicle for a traffic violation and found that he didn’t have any identification on him or a driver’s license because it was previously suspended. Police also discovered a .40-caliber gun loaded with 10 rounds of ammunition. The pistol was later identified as a “ghost gun,” which are assembled from kits and function like a real firearm. These reports, however, have not been confirmed.\n\nThe weapon, according to The New York Times, is extremely dangerous and usually doesn’t have a serial number, which makes them hard to trace.\n\nIn March of 2016, Fat Trel was arrested for Possession of Counterfeit Money after being accused of attempting to use fake bills at a Maryland casino. He maintained his innocence. The following month, he was taken into custody in Arlington, Va. for DWI, narcotics distribution, speeding and driving with a revoked license.\n\nXXL has reached out to the Arlington County Sheriff's Office and an attorney for Fat Trel for a comment."
