        "text": "Rick Ross came out on the Best Buy Theater stage on Monday night somewhere in the past — the 2010-11 era, specifically. That was the moment of his greatest triumph, when he made songs that sounded like gladiator calls, when the fictions he had written to transform himself into one of hip-hop’s kingpins were beginning to breathe life.\n\nAfter a few minutes of rapping bits of “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast),” “I’m Not a Star” and “Ima Boss,” he paced the stage in his glorious red leather jacket with a red-fur-lined hood and reminded the crowd, “It gets no bigger than the boss.”\n\nAn overstatement, maybe, even if only because Mr. Ross’s prodigious belly, normally flaunted as a sign of uncaring power, looked slimmer than usual.\n\nIn any case, a boss gets exhausted. All that bossness — it wears on a soul, even someone as durable as Mr. Ross, who in the last few years established himself as one of hip-hop’s most important and theatrical figures and then, once he’d planted his flag, began to look uncertain how to maintain the pose."
