        "text": "Back in October, Fat Trel was released from prison following a years-long stint in prison, and much of hip hop subsequently celebrated the return of one of rap’s most dominant emcees in the game. As with many who have shared experiences before him, the question arose as to when the D.C. talent would be delivering new music — footage of Trel alongside the likes of Icewear Vezzo, Lil Durk, Rick Ross and fellow hometown hero Wale only stoked the proverbial fire.\n\nToday (Nov. 10), Fat Trel makes his official return to wax with “Last Day In,” a Kid Tha Producer-backed effort that’s filled with vivid, street-oriented raps that quickly show just how much he hasn’t lost a step from any standpoint:\n\n“Niggas really let they opps walk around them, some shit I don’t understand, and they really say he used to be official, ‘til he got on the stand, took an oath, then he raised his right hand, told on his man, everybody know it, ain’t nowhere to go, so you go and get him out that jam…”\n\nShot by Be Different Media, “Last Day In” also sees an accompanying clip that’s centered around Trel and a couple of beautiful women laid up in different locations while counting money. Elsewhere, an iced-up Trel delivers his bars from in front of a wall lined with TVs. Simply put, the video keeps things simple and to the point, allowing the spotlight to remain on the song itself.\n\nIn a recent interview with REVOLT, Trel spoke on his forthcoming album, which is named after his late Slutty Boyz comrade and brother Boosa Da Shoota, who was tragically killed back in June:\n\n“We definitely got a lot of shit on the way. Boosa’s Keeper, the new album, I would say, 68 to 73 percent completed.\n\nWith that, press play on “Last Day In” below. As stated, Boosa’s Keeper is on the way."
