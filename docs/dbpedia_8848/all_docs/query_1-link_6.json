        "text": "FAT Trel is a rapper from Washington, DC who was recently incarcerated.\n\nOn October 15, 2021, it was reported that Fat Trel was freed from prison.\n\nWho is Fat Trel and how old is he?\n\nTrel, born Martrel Rayshard Reeves, is a musician. Born June 26, 1990, Trel is 31-years-old.\n\nHe is currently signed to DTLA Records with distribution via BERYL MEDIA and was previously signed by Rick Ross's label Maybach Music Group and Atlantic Records.\n\nThroughout his career, he has collaborated with several artists and released a slew of mixtapes with Rick Ross, Big K.R.I.T., Chief Keef, Wale, Gucci Mane, E-40 and YG.\n\nHis last project Big Homie dropped last year with 18 tracks and guest appearances from artists, including No Savage, Big Flock, Goonew, Trippa and Z-Wayne.\n\nWhy did Fat Trel go to jail?\n\nHe was arrested on July 8, 2018 for possession of a firearm and ammunition.\n\nThe Virginia rapper pleaded guilty for the illegal possession of a ghost gun in 2020 and faced a maximum of 10 years in prison.\n\nIn September 2021, US District Judge Paula Xinis revealed he would only be sentenced two years and six months in federal prison and three years of supervised release.\n\nOn October 15, 2021, footage circulated on social media of the freed rapper as he made his way out of the prison facility.\n\n“You know what the f*** it is,” Fat Trel is heard saying in the clip.\n\n“The king of Northeast is back n****, and you know what the f*** is up with me n****.”\n\nThe Virginia rapper's legal troubles began in 2016 after he was charged with possession of counterfeit currency after he allegedly attempted to use counterfeit money at a local casino."
