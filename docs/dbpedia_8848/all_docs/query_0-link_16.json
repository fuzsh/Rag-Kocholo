        "text": "American rapper and record executive\n\nThis article is about the American rapper. For the medieval Hungarian historian known as Master P, see Anonymus (notary of Béla III).\n\nPercy Robert Miller Sr. (born April 29, 1970),[1] better known by his stage name Master P, is an American rapper, record producer, record executive, actor and entrepreneur. He founded the record label No Limit Records in 1991, which was relaunched into the spin-off labels New No Limit Records and No Limit Forever Records. Miller gained fame in the mid-1990s as the lead member and founder of the label's hip hop group TRU, as well as his fifth solo album Ice Cream Man (1996) and its namesake lead single. His 1997 single, \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\" received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nIn total, Miller has released 15 studio albums.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPercy Robert Miller was born and raised in the Third Ward of Uptown New Orleans, Louisiana. He grew up in the Calliope Projects. He is the oldest of five children. He has one sister, Germaine, and three brothers: Kevin, and platinum-selling rap artists Corey \"C-Murder\" and Vyshonne \"Silkk the Shocker\" Miller. He attended Booker T. Washington High School and Warren Easton High School.[3] Having played on the basketball team, Miller attended the University of Houston on an athletic scholarship, but dropped out months into his freshman year and transferred to Merritt College in Oakland, California to major in business administration.[4] After the death of his grandfather, Miller inherited $10,000 as part of a malpractice settlement. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records And Tapes, which later became the foundation for No Limit Records. On February 15, 1990, Master P released the cassette tape Mind Of A Psychopath. His brother Kevin Miller was killed that same year in New Orleans. This increased his motivation to become a successful entrepreneur to change his life and save his family.[5]\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\n1989–1995: Early works\n\n[edit]\n\nMaster P released his debut studio album Get Away Clean on February 12, 1991. This was followed by his second album Mama's Bad Boy, which was released in April 1992. Both albums were released through In-A-Minute Records. Also in 1992, he released his first collaboration album with his group TRU titled Understanding the Criminal Mind, and in 1993 they released another album titled Who's da Killer? Master P released his third studio album The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me! on March 18, 1994; it was later re-released in 1997 as a limited edition under Priority. That same year Master P collaborated on the No Limit compilation albums West Coast Bad Boyz, Vol. 1: Anotha Level of the Game and West Coast Bad Boyz: High fo Xmas. On June 6, 1995, Master P released his fourth studio album 99 Ways to Die. Master P and TRU released their third album True in 1995, which was the group's first major release after two independent albums. The album reached number 25 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 14 on the Top Heatseekers. The album was known for its first single and one of Master P's best known songs \"I'm Bout' It, Bout It\". He also worked on the compilation album, Down South Hustlers: Bouncin' and Swingin', during that year.\n\nMaster P said that when he used to open for Tupac Shakur in the early 1990s, the people responsible for introducing him would frequently call him \"Mr. P the country singer\".[6]\n\n1995–2000: Return to New Orleans and mainstream success\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1995, Master P moved from California back to New Orleans to relocate No Limit Records with a set of new artists and in-house producers Beats By the Pound. On April 16, 1996, Master P released his fifth album Ice Cream Man. It contained the hit single \"Mr. Ice Cream Man\". Later in 1996, Master P returned with TRU to work on Tru 2 da Game, which would not be released until February 18, 1997. At that time, TRU was reduced to a trio with just Master P alongside his brothers C-Murder and Silkk the Shocker. On September 2, 1997, Master P released his breakthrough album Ghetto D. The first week sales of the album were the highest of any of Master P's albums, selling over 760,000 copies, and it went on to go certified triple platinum. It contained the hit single \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\", Master P's highest-charting single to date. The song earned him an MTV Video Music Award nomination the following year for \"Best Rap Video\", but lost to Will Smith's \"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It\". On June 2, 1998, Master P released his seventh and best-selling album to date MP Da Last Don. Master P released a film of the same name earlier that year. The album debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Top 200 charts selling over 400,000 copies in its first week, and went on to sell over four million copies. On October 26, 1999, Master P released his eighth studio album Only God Can Judge Me, which contained his single \"Step To Dis\". The album went certified gold, selling over 500,000 copies. In 1999, Master P and TRU released their fifth studio album Da Crime Family. On November 28, 2000, he released his ninth studio album Ghetto Postage which contained his hit singles \"Bout Dat\" and \"Souljas\". Also in 2000, Master P and his new group 504 Boyz released their debut album Goodfellas, which peaked at number 1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and contained their hit single \"Wobble Wobble\".\n\n2001–2005: The New No Limit\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 18, 2001, Master P released his tenth studio album Game Face, the first Master P album released on The New No Limit, which had a partnership with Universal Records. In 2002, The 504 Boyz released their second album Ballers. Both albums charted high on the Hip-Hop charts, but shortly after, No Limit began to decline in popularity. Record sales as well as roster changes and lawsuits caused No Limit Records to file for bankruptcy on December 17, 2003.\n\nMaster P's eleventh album, titled Good Side, Bad Side, was released on March 23, 2004, through Koch Records, debuting at number 1 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart. Master P and TRU released their last album The Truth in 2005 followed by Master P's twelfth studio album Ghetto Bill:The Best Hustler in the Game\n\n2005–2007: Guttar Music\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, Master P and his son Romeo Miller formed the independent label Guttar Music. On November 29, 2005, Master P released his first independent album and thirteenth overall, Living Legend: Certified D-Boy, on Guttar Music. Master P and 504 Boyz released their last album titled Hurricane Katrina: We Gon Bounce Back that year, and it was dedicated to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nIn April 2006, Master P released a compilation album America's Most Luved Bad Guy.

The series shares stories of Master P's career as a record executive and businessman, underscoring the unprecedented distribution deal with Priority Records that made No Limit Records a powerhouse record label in the 1990s.[46] Awareness of the circumstances of Master P's incarcerated brother, C-Murder, resurged after the series aired, prompting Percy to rally for his brother's release. On August 17, 2020, Master P posted a video to his Instagram account of him and C-Murder's lawyer speaking to a group of protesters, inciting momentum to work in favor of his brother's liberation.[47]\n\nBusiness career\n\n[edit]\n\nAside from being a rapper, Master P has enjoyed a successful career as an entrepreneur and investor. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records, which later became the foundation for his own record label of the same name.[48]\n\nMiller was one of the first rappers to notice and take advantage of the retail potential of the music industry. As an investor, Master P was one of the first rappers to build a business and financial empire by investing in a wide range of business and investment ventures from a variety of industries. He has since invested the millions of dollars he made from his No Limit record company into a travel agency, a Foot Locker retail outlet, real estate, stocks, film, music, and television production, toy making, clothing, telecommunications, a jewellery line, auto accessories, book and magazine publishing, car rims, fast food franchises, and gas stations.[49][50][51][52] His sports management agency No Limit Communications, a joint venture with marketing guru Djuan Edgerton, was a success. His conglomerate company, No Limit Enterprises became a financial powerhouse. His real estate investment and property management company, the New Orleans-based PM Properties controls over 100 properties across the United States.[53] According to Black Enterprise magazine, No Limit Enterprises grossed $110 million in revenue in 1998 alone. This level of success inspired other rappers to branch out into other business ventures and investments.[53][54] Miller also has his own line of beverages called \"Make 'Em Say Ughh!\" energy drinks.[55]\n\nRappers had historically focused more on the artistic and glamorous side of hip hop music while paying very little attention to the business, investment, and financial aspects. All that changed in 1996 when Master P signed a music distribution deal with Priority Records, one where No Limit Records would retain 100% ownership of their master recordings and keep 85% of their record's sales while giving Priority 15% in return for pressing and distribution which allows No Limit to profit from future sales such as catalogs and reissues.[53] Master P went on to make hundreds of millions of dollars from this deal. Additionally, Master P invented many innovative marketing techniques. According to Wendy Day, CEO of the Rap Coalition, \"Master P had a whole marketing movement. He was the first person to market the way a corporate entity like IBM would market to their clientele.\" Whereas the traditional model for marketing records was to spend millions of dollars on expensive videos and air play, Miller did not have such a luxury. As an independent artist, Miller had to find a way to sell, market and build platinum record selling demand on a limited recording budget. He was known for keeping upfront business expenses down and profit margins high. He began selling tapes out the trunk of his car in every city and town in America where there was potential demand for his music. He gave out free samples to people with expensive cars and had them playing his music throughout their neighborhoods. This street level guerrilla marketing technique set the foundation to build a larger fanbase for the future. After signing his deal with Priority, Miller began a high volume business model of cranking out as many records as possible, as frequently as possible. He branded all his albums, so that the No Limit brand became more important than the actual artist's name. Miller cross-promoted all his artists and albums inside the album covers. He also used pen and pixel graphics and Mafia-inspired themes to make his albums stand out using Photoshop. He offered 20 songs per album, whereas most albums offered 15 or less, as Miller learned that customers wanted more for their money. He turned his artists into Marvel comic book-like characters rather than just rappers. He made sure his artists were number one on SoundScan every time they released an album, to build the perception of popularity. He used inexpensive videos to promote his artists and he cross-promoted albums using films and vice versa and tied them altogether as a package. Brand image and identity became more important than just music quality. Miller's record labels have sold 75 million records as a result of his innovative marketing and branding strategies.[54][56]\n\nAs founder and CEO of No Limit Entertainment, Miller at one time presided over a business empire that included his conglomerate No Limit Enterprises, No Limit Records, Bout It Inc., No Limit Clothing, No Limit Communications, No Limit Films, No Limit Sports Management, P. M. Properties, and Advantage Travel. Miller represented former NFL running back Ricky Williams when he was drafted by the New Orleans Saints; however, the deal was rated the worst contract for a player in NFL History by ESPN.[57] Miller manages the music, film, and television career of his son, Romeo Miller, as well as pop star Forrest Lipton and Atlanta rapper Gucci Mane. Miller was the executive television producer for his teenage daughter Cymphonique's Nickelodeon Show, How To Rock, and the co-creator of Romeo!, the hit Nickelodeon television show that stars his son.[58]\n\nIncome\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Miller ranked 10th on Forbes magazine's list of America's 40 highest paid entertainers, with an estimated income of $56.5 million. In 2013, Miller's wealth is estimated to be $200 million, making him one of the wealthiest figures in the American hip hop scene.[59]\n\nProfessional basketball career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Miller joined the Fort Wayne Fury of the CBA as a backup guard after a No Limit employee asked the Fury head coach to give his boss a tryout. According to the coach Miller was \"coachable [and] an eager learner\", but not NBA material.[60]\n\nMiller was on the Charlotte Hornets training camp roster for 10 days in January 1999.[61][62] He was invited to participate at the request of Hornet Ricky Davis's father.[63] He scored 7 points in intrasquad play[64] and played eight minutes in two exhibition games before being released on February 1.[62] Miller claimed he played well but was cut because his rap lyrics were too offensive.[65]\n\nThat fall he was on the Toronto Raptors training camp roster.[66] He scored eight points in one preseason game, but was dropped before the season began.[67][68] He complained that the Raptors hadn't given him a fair chance.[69]\n\nIn November, he signed with the San Diego Stingrays of the short-lived IBL,[70] a \"home for players without NBA skills and those who are developing them.\"[71] His performance was disappointing[72][73] and he played for less than a season.[74]\n\nIn 2004, Miller played for the ABA's Las Vegas Rattlers and Long Beach Jam. He earned try-outs for the Denver Nuggets at training camp for the summer league in 2004 and the same opportunity for the Sacramento Kings in 2005.[75] He took part in the 2008 McDonald's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game and scored 17 points.[76] He also coached the AAU team the P. Miller Ballers with players such as Brandon Jennings, Lance Stephenson, and DeMar DeRozan who went on to achieve success in the NBA. DeRozan said of his time being coached by Miller that, \"I am forever grateful for having him in my life ... He taught us about life, how to understand business—the business of basketball. He was, in a sense, a father figure.\"[75]\n\nOther ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm and television career\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1997, Master P has been in numerous feature and straight-to-DVD films, as well as television shows. His filmography includes Uncle P, Uncle Willy's Family, Soccer Mom, Gone in 60 Seconds, Hollywood Homicide, Toxic, Foolish, and '. In 1999, he had a small run in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he led a professional wrestling stable called The No Limit Soldiers in a feud with Curt Hennig's The West Texas Rednecks. Master P also starred in Romeo! alongside his son Romeo Miller on the children's network Nickelodeon from 2003 to 2006. He was also a contestant on Dancing with the Stars, replacing Romeo who dropped out due to an injury. He partnered with Ashly DelGrosso and received a total score of 8 out of 30 for his pasodoble, the lowest score in the show's history. He was eliminated in Week 4.\n\nIn 1999, Miller starred alongside Eddie Griffin in the hit film Foolish.\n\nAs reported in March 2011, Miller planned to star in a new film with his protégé Gucci Mane, titled Get Money. The film, set for release through No Limit, would be based on Miller's book of the same name.\n\nOn June 10, 2015, it was announced that Master P and his family would be starring in their own reality show titled Master P's Family Empire. It is scheduled to be aired on Reelz sometime in November.[77]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 1, 2007, Miller released his first book, titled Guaranteed Success.[78]\n\nPro wrestling\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, The No Limit Soldiers appeared on WCW Monday Nitro feuding with The Filthy Animals and The West Texas Rednecks.\n\nOn October 8, 2019, it was reported and confirmed that Master P purchased ownership in Brooklyn, New York-based independent wrestling promotion House of Glory.[79]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nMiller is known for his music and his business acumen, due to creating and branding his highly successful independent record label No Limit Records, as well as his other business ventures.[1][80][81]\n\nMiller is held in high esteem by other rappers as well. During an interview after meeting Miller, Atlanta rapper 2 Chainz stated, \"This is my first time meeting [him]. I just want to let him know how he influenced the whole South in Hip-Hop.\" 2 Chainz went on, \"We used to argue people like they ain't understand why we appreciated Master P and his music. It was more than that. I felt like it was his grind, his hustle. He actually put music out like every week. I even heard stories about some of the songs never even being mixed before. It was just about giving the fans what they needed. And he the reason why a lot of us are here, including myself.\"[82]\n\nAccolades and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Master P won the award for \"Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist\" at the American Music Awards.\n\nIn 2005, Miller was ranked at number 36 by VH1 in their list of 50 Greatest Hip Hop Artists.[83] On September 29, 2008, Miller's single \"Make 'Em Say Uhh!\" would be ranked at number 94 by VH1 in their list of 100 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs.[84]\n\nBET named Miller number 28 in 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time'.[85] BET also listed Miller as one of 'The 25 Influential Black Music Execs'.[86]\n\nIn November 2011, Miller's son Romeo Miller performed at the 2010 Hip Hop Honors, along with his brother Valentino Miller, his cousins Lil' D and Black Don, and his uncle Silkk The Shocker, as well as Trina, Gucci Mane, and Mystikal to honor Master P and No Limit Records.[87]\n\nOn December 11, 2012, DJ 5150 and DJ Hektik released a tribute mixtape to Master P titled Uptown Veteran.[88]\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Miller was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, making him the first hip hop artist to be inducted.[89]\n\nOn January 20, 2015, Montreal R&B/Hip Hop artist Xav released a song with Master P called \"Bout It Bout It\", from his upcoming Zeeky EP, paying homage to Master P's 1995 international hit.
