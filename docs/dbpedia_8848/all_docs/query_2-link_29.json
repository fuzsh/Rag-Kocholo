        "text": "By Michelle Richardson,\n\nSpecial to the AFRO\n\nIt’s almost festival season and that means the number one music festival in the nation’s capital is returning. Last week, Broccoli City Festival (BCF) dates and lineups were announced and like the young kids say, “it’s lit!”\n\nBroccoli City Festival is a “Black-owned social enterprise that focuses on people and progress,” according to the festival’s official website. Organizers say the festival is meant to “foster creativity and community growth by building innovative experiences that intersect technology, music, art, and social impact.”\n\nThe largest festival in the country for young people of color, BCF was founded by Brandon McEachern, Marcus Allen, and Darryl Perkins and was named after their hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina. Broccoli for the “Greens” and city for the “boro.”\n\n“This year’s lineup continues our tradition of celebrating culture, both nationally and locally in the DMV, and those who continue to play a role in driving progress in Black communities,” said McEachern in a statement. “Our goal is to always create a dope cultural experience and highlight a diverse group of artists who are taking Black music to new heights, and I’m proud of how it’s come together.”\n\n“It’s pretty much the HBCU of festivals,” said one DC resident who attends the festival every chance he gets. “It just a bunch of my people vibing out to our favorite artist and the food good too.”\n\nThe two-day festival will take place Saturday, July 15 and Sunday, July 16. On Saturday, acts such as Lil Uzi Vert, The City Girls, Jazmine Sullivan, Mariah the Scientist, Ice Spice and Saucy Santana will take the stage and on Sunday, festival goers can enjoy performances by Maryland native Brent Faiyaz, Kodak Black, Glorilla, DC native Fat Trel, Chloe Bailey, and Coco Jones.\n\nDC Go-Go artist such as UCB, Backyard Band, and TCB will take part in “Battle of the Bands.”\n\nAlthough, the music festival offers concerts with a focus on R&B, hip hop, trap, and soul, music isn’t the only aspect of the festival attendees can enjoy. BCF offers 40+ artist, DJ’s, and influencers, 50+ local vendors and brands, and 40+ healthy food vendors as well as 2 stages.\n\nDespite beginning as a concert, BCF has expanded to include conference speakers, online panels, and community fundraisers. The festival even host a 5K running event for charity. Also, BCF gives back to the DC Community by hiring local talent and focusing on social initiatives such as healthy eating all year long and cleaning up local rivers and waterways.\n\nThose who volunteer with BCF initiatives can earn free tickets to the festival if they have a certain amount of community service hours.\n\n“I’ve never been but I’m looking forward to going this year and living my best life. I’ve heard nothing but good things,” stated Brandon Williams, a freshman student at Howard University.\n\nEverything Legendary Plant based Burgers, Smirnoff, and Red Bull are partners of the BCF this year.\n\n“This is an event curated for us, by us and I think people can recognize that. That’s why this festival is always a success and people have a good time,” said Audrey Watkins, a DC native.\n\nTickets for the festival can be bought in 2-day General Admission, 2-Day GA+, 2-Day VIP, Rose Bar All Access VIP, or Rose Bar Sky Deck Bottle Service and can be purchased here: https://broccolicity.frontgatetickets.com/\n\nInformation on hotels, vendors, BCF merchandise, and FAQ’s can be found here: https://www.bcfestival.com/\n\nThe post Popular music festival to return to nation’s capital this summer appeared first on AFRO American Newspapers ."
