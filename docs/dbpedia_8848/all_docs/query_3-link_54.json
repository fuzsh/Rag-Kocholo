We want to continue highlighting those who continue to play a role in driving progress in Black communities,” says Brandon McEachern, co-founder of Broccoli City Festival. “Our goal is to always create a dope cultural experience and highlight a diverse group of artists who are taking Black music to new heights, and I’m proud of how it’s come together.”\n\nThe return of classic BC Fest features including seamless admission, multiple stages of nonstop music, the greatest local food trucks, live art displays, interactive sponsor activations, an impact and marketplace village with Black-owned companies and community programming are among the other highlights. In the festival grounds and in the VIP areas, bars will sell alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as craft cocktails, beer, wine, and other libations.\n\nBCFestival.com/Tickets will start selling General Admission and VIP pass choices on Friday, March 3 at 10 a.m. EST. Rain or shine, BC Fest will run from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m."
