        "text": "Tap in to some of the newest music released this week including a single from Rob49 & Cardi B, projects from Childish Gambino, JT and more!\n\nZac Efron‘s latest movie, We Are Your Friends, reportedly made history for being one of the worst flops from a major studio. The EDM culture-influenced film raked in only $1.8 million from over 2,300 theaters nationwide. Apparently that makes it the fourth-worst wide-release opening weekend. [TIME] Young Thug was the latest to do a sit-down interview […]\n\nFat Trel is getting a little inspiration for Kanye and Fetty Wap these days. The Maybach Music rapper releases a new JD On The Track-produced song titled “All Day.” Following the release of his Georgetown mixtape, the DMV rapper’s still keeping his fans engaged by dropping loosies every now and then. Channeling his inner singer, […]\n\nFat Trel’s been teasing the release of Georgetown for months, and now it’s finally out. The 16-track project features contributions from Fetty Wap, Troy Ave, Young Chop, 808 Mafia, K.E. On The Track, and so many more. One of the standout records on the mixtape is a Cool & Dre-produced joint titled “BRRRR,” which features Trel’s MMG boss […]\n\nFat Trel is the latest artist to get another addictive hook from Fetty Wap, as the two team up for their new song “I Need You.” The D.C. rapper recruited the Jersey native for the female-friendly track, which was produced by Allsteezy, and will definitely be a jam to sing along to in the club. […]\n\nIt’s been exactly a year since D.C. rapper Fat Trel released his Gleesh mixtape, and after suffering from a broken leg via a motorcycle accident, the “Respect With The Teck” rapper is back with a brand new tape titled Georgetown. Centered around ’80s nostalgia, Georgetown will be Fat Trel’s attempt at bringing back the period of […]\n\nWhere the loyalty at? On the heels of releasing “Miracle On U Street” and “The Chess Match,” Wale drops “Loyalty” featuring MMG labelmate Fat Trel and Dew Baby. “Aye little boy where your loyalty at?” raps Wale. “And if you hate me, don’t be throwing me daps.” The Festivus mixtape arrives today at 3:31 p.m. EST. Wale’s […]\n\nUnfortunately, this beef will probably get worse before it gets better. Migos have been beefing with Chief Keef, Fredo Santana, and their GBE crew for a while now, but things recently got violent. Not only did Fredo Santana publicly threaten Migos on Twitter, but just a few days later, the Atlanta trio was robbed during […]\n\nA lot can be said of the rapper Fat Trel. However, love him or hate on him, you have to respect the way he’s made a name for himself In this murky rap world. His new song ‘These Niggas,’ which features K Camp, is a step up from Trel’s usual trap-inspired soliloquies. Not going to […]\n\nIt’s 2014 and them boys are back! In honor of the NBA Finals featuring Rick Ross’ home team, the Miami Heat, he releases part two of his 2011 track “Finals” which originally featured Meek Mill and Gunplay. This time around, Meek Mill isn’t featured on the track (probably busy), but Gunplay, Wale, Rockie Fresh, Fat Trel, […]"
