        "text": "Now that Fat Trel has completed his legal obligations, he will be taking over your speakers and bringing new energy to the party. Earlier today (Dec. 7), the D.C. rapper Fat Trel released the first taste from his upcoming project, “Strike Sum.” Produced by TayDaProducer, the track features hard-hitting bars on life beyond fame and the streets:\n\nIn addition to the video for “Strike Sum”, Be Different Media created an accompanying visual. With Trel riding around in a Rolls-Royce, he and his MGE collective take over a gas station with him and his crew. There are also other high-performance vehicles that do donuts in the film while keeping with the automotive theme.\n\nFollowing years of recidivism, Fat Trel was released from prison last year after many years of being incarcerated. After launching his album campaign, the No Secret star continued to maintain his already prestigious career with the single “Hellcats & Trackhawks” was composed over Lil Durk’s “Last Day In”. Icewear Vezzo and EST Gee could also be seen alongside Wale and his longstanding collaborator, Icewear Vezzo. Amidst all of this success and momentum, he found himself back in the corner after a struggle with an arrest in 2018. It was only late last month that he managed to return to freedom, just in time for the Thanksgiving holiday, after being imprisoned for seven months.\n\nA few years back, the star of No Secrets talked with Business Insider about his advice for those looking to follow in his footsteps:\n\nIn my opinion, I would tell them to keep their eyes on the prize and stay focused. Make sure that you focus more on the music side of things. There is where I believe I made a mistake. There was a time when I was trying to perform on the streets and work in the industry at the same time. I was not taking my career or my job as seriously as I should have. You gotta leave that neighborhood s**t behind.”"
