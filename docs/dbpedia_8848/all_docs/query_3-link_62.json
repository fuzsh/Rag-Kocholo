        "text": "You may recognize Reggie Watts as the bandleader of The Late Late Show with James Corden. If you grew up in Great Falls, you may have even seen him around town as he was growing up. In fact, Watts, who was born in Germany but grew up in Great Falls, is seeing his stock on the rise as he has been blending music, comedy, effects and improv to the delight of audiences all over the world for years and his \"Great Falls\" Tour is coming to Montana this fall (just not to Great Falls). He will, however, be hitting Bozeman and Missoula. Watts will perform at the Elm in Bozeman on Monday, October 23. Presale tickets to that show go on sale tomorrow at 10am here with the general sale starting Thursday. You can catch Reggie at the Wilma Theater in Missoula on Tuesday, October 24. Tickets go on sale this Thursday at 10am at the Top Hat in Missoula, online or by calling (406) 514-3849.\n\nThe following is from the show's press release: Reggie Watts is an internationally renowned Musician/Comedian/Writer/Actor who currently stars as the bandleader on CBS’s The Late Late Show with James Corden. Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Watts blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy, wowing audiences with performances that are 100% improvised.\n\nWatts’ first Netflix special Spatial released to massive critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it “a giddy rush of escapist nonsense” and dubbing Watts “the most influential absurdist in comedy today.” The A.V. Club described Spatial as “signature\n\nWatts, meaning it’s alternately exhilarating, silly, exhausting and transcendent”."
