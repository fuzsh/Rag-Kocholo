        "text": "A few years ago, before anyone knew his name, before rap artists from all over the country started hitting him up for music, the rap producer Lex Luger, born Lexus Lewis, now age 20, sat down in his dad’s kitchen in Suffolk, Va., opened a sound-mixing program called Fruity Loops on his laptop and created a new track. It had a thunderous canned-orchestra melody, like an endless loop of some bombastic moment from Wagner or Danny Elfman; a sternum-rattling bass line; and skittering electronic percussion that brought to mind artillery fire. When the track was finished, he e-mailed it to a rapper named Waka Flocka Flame. Luger had recently spent a few months in Atlanta with Waka, sequestered in a basement, producing most of the music for Waka’s debut album. Waka had asked him for one more beat, one that could potentially be the album’s first single.\n\nMonths later, Luger — who says he was “broke as a joke” by that point, about to become a father for the second time and seriously considering taking a job stocking boxes in a warehouse — heard that same beat on the radio, transformed into a Waka song called “Hard in da Paint.” Before long, he couldn’t get away from it.\n\nWhen radio stations got their hands on another Luger-produced track — “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast),” by Miami’s Rick Ross — suddenly everyone was calling Luger, asking for his own “Hard in da Paint” or “Blowin’ Money Fast.” Luger’s beats were everywhere, fueling hit songs by people you’ve heard of (Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z) and innumerable underground mix tapes by people you haven’t heard of (street-famous rappers like Fat Trel, Lil Scrappy and OJ Da Juiceman).\n\nAnd then last year, Kanye West summoned Luger to New York, to Electric Lady Studios in the West Village. Kanye wanted a Lex Luger beat or two for his fifth album, “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” Kanye set Lex up in a downstairs room, where Lex knocked out a drum track for the M.B.D.T.F. bonus cut “See Me Now,” and by the time he got back upstairs, Kanye had thrown Lex’s beat under a newly recorded vocal by Beyoncé Knowles — who was there in the room, sitting in a chair next to Jay-Z.\n\nYou made it now, Lex remembers Jay-Z saying. You got Beyoncé bopping to your beats.\n\nLex didn’t know whether to hug her or shake her hand. He went with the hug.\n\nIt happens about once a year in hip-hop production: someone invents or perfects a sound, someone figures out how to get a weird noise out of some piece of technology not designed to make that noise, someone figures out a way to make a drum machine say the same old thing with a different accent and the whole rap world tilts on its axis. If you manage to change the beat — if your sound drifts upstream from mix tapes to pop radio, if it becomes the only thing anybody wants to hear — you can change hip-hop. In the ’90s, Dr. Dre slowed gangsta rap down to a cruising-lowrider pace, creating music for which a cocky drawl is the ideal lead instrument, and Snoop Dogg became a star. Lex Luger’s sound helped elevate Rick Ross, who pounds haikulike syllables into the spaces in the music, and Waka Flocka Flame, a pure-energy rapper who just blows the house in.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
