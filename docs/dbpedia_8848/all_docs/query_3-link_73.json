        "text": "A hip-hop concert that was planned for November 7th at Detroit’s Masonic Temple has been canceled by promoters due to the venue’s new vaccine mandate.\n\nShe's was known as \"the fastest woman in the world,\" but Florence Flo Jo Griffith Joyner was much more than that. She was a loving mother, a designer, and even an actress too.\n\nThe eighth and final season of 'black-ish' will definitely be ending on a high note as it's recently been revealed that former First Lady Michelle Obama will make a special guest appearance for one episode.\n\nAfter already breaking barriers as the first woman and Black person to be elected as New York State Attorney General, Letitia James is continuing her rise in the political ranks with reports that she'll be entering the run to be NY Governor in 2022.\n\nA white man from Michigan won a $10 million discrimination lawsuit after a federal jury in Charlotte agreed with his claims that his former employer fired him because he was a white male.\n\nWe have a lot to celebrate this week. It's Eva's birthday, it's Halloween, and Cuffing Season is in full effect! To top it off, we have special guest A.J. Johnson giving us the scoop on how she doesn't age and her new TV One show 'Life Therapy'.\n\nJeezy made an interesting revelation about his longstanding friendship with Jay-Z during the latest episode of TV One's 'UNCENSORED,' which included an incident where both rap vets had to have each other's backs when it came to a Vegas fist fight.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Chris Brown's public declaration of support for Kyrie Irving's refusal to get vaccinated, boxing icon Floyd Mayweather Jr. took some time to write the 29-year-old Brooklyn Nets star a note and let him know he's got another famous face in his corner.\n\nEric Heinze, an assistant chief inspector with the U.S. Marshal's Task Force, and Kristopher Hutchens, a Clayton County police officer, were charged with felony murder, aggravated assault, burglary, making false statements and violation of oath by a public officer in the death of Jamarion Robinson."
