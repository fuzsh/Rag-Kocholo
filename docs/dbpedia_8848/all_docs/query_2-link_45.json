        "text": "On the heels of the alleged Migos chain snatching along with Drake and Tyga‘s social media feud, I’ve concluded there’s two kinds of rap beef: real life disagreements and all for show beefs.\n\nAs any PR head would acknowledge, any publicity is good publicity. Headlines gain attention and clicks, which further people research on different artist, you can gain a fan by a well fueled rap beef such as the Kanye West and 50 Cent showdown — which was most likely all for show. 50 Cent and Kanye do not have the same core fanbase but it’s a likely sitaution for a fan of Kanye to check out 50 music and vice versa. Fake beefs normally occur when it’s time for albums to drop.\n\nReal beefs pop up out of nowhere such as Migos performing in DC two weeks ago and member Quavo getting his chain snatched for violating the “check in” code. While publicity beefs are relatively short and over before you realized it started, real beefs take some time to settle down. There’s going to be homemade videos addressing the situation, threatening songs and videos and can lead to a demise which happened with the most famous rap beef of all time, Tupac and Biggie.\n\nHere’s a short list of who’s beefing in the rap game right now and why, along with my take on if it’s real or fake.\n\nMigos VS Fat Trel, Chief Keef and crew (REAL)\n\nMigos started it by uploading that IG video clowning on Chief Keef’s man. Chief Keef and his cousin Fredo Santana took to Twitter letting it be known this wouldn’t be the end of it. Migos performed in DC, hometown of Chief Keef’s affiliate Fat Trel. Quavo chained is snatched and Fat Trel uploaded a video on WorldStar a day or two after confirming he knew who had the chain and those group of guys were shown passing the chain around in the video. But it’s gets even complex and more beefy once the chain snatcher is seen on FaceTime dropping the dime on ex-friend Fat Trel in Quavo newest video which addresses the whole ordeal.\n\nILoveMakonnen VS Troy Ave (REAL)\n\nTroy Ave is known to hop on a remix real quick. Well Makonnen wasn’t feeling his remix to “Tuesday” and expressed his resentment via Twitter. Troy Ave came back with less than 140 character response of: just know we gon see about your comments when we see you fat b#tch.\n\nEasily pulled off as laughable. I’m sure both have forgot all about it by now.\n\nOG Maco VS Key! (Could Be REAL, Could Be FAKE)\n\nBoth new artists and both climbed to the top together. I wouldn’t have known about the other without the other. But OG Maco released a diss track “Fat Fuck” four days ago which makes my friendship alarm go off. Were these guys ever friends? What happen to make you guys fall out so rapidly?\n\nCould be real for the fact that you don’t know anyone until money is placed in front of them. Could be fake because it just happened too soon, they were both just performing together in NY.\n\nTrinidad James VS Maino (REAL)\n\nMr. All Gold Everything did the unthinkable, he got a little truthful in front of the wrong crowd. He stood in front of a New York audience and declared Atlanta’s rap scene runs New York. Now I wasn’t in attendance and neither was Maino but I knew the statement alone would ruffled the feathers of some in cocky hip hop birthplace.\n\nMaino felt the need to speak up for New York’s music scene and threw a few jabs via Twitter and it ended with a six minute phone call between the two.\n\nLil Jay VS Lil Durk (REAL)\n\nThese two clearly go back further than Chiraq and Lil Jay has it out for Lil Durk. Like he does not like him and will drop his name in every song he can. His newest claim is Lil Durk is a snitch for beating his gun case. Lil Durk says he needs at least $20,000 to even respond to Lil Jay.\n\nDrake VS Tyga (FAKE)\n\nI can’t take this beef serious at all because Drake isn’t the kind to beef but instead he’ll like a few pictures of your girl on IG. They probably are not “cool” but I highly doubt, there’s going to be any real beef going on.\n\nWale VS Meek Mill (FAKE)\n\nSimilar to Tyga and Drake’s beef, these guys are on the same team which makes me really question everything. Meek Mill doesn’t seem like the type to address his issues with anyone via Twitter as he did with labelmate Wale. But the calm head that Wale kept, really confirmed how fake it was. Because as we know, Wale is emotional and will address how he feels via Twitter but instead he played it as Mister Cool.\n\nIggy VS Snoop Dogg (FAKE)\n\nThe OG Snoop Dogg doesn’t beef and if he does it wouldn’t be with a girl from Australia that raps. And supposedly T.I. had to step in to squashed the ordeal. Nah, I don’t believe it.\n\nMeek Mill VS Drake (REAL)\n\nI for one, really thought this was fake until my older brother said these exact words: “What has Meek gained from these besides L’s?” If it were fake, both would have been winning in the situation; and as we can see Drake is the supreme winner in this beef."
