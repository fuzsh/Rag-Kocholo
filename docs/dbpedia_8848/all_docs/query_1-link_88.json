        "text": "Zoe Pound are a widespread criminal organization composed of mostly Haitian immigrants. Zoe Pound was founded in the mid 1990's in the Lil Haiti section of Miami, Florida by a small group of Haitian immigrant youths who were tired of being attacked by Whites law enforcement agencies and in some cases African Americans. It started as a way for the Haitian youths to protect themselves from other racial groups but turned into something much larger. Zoe Pound is currently one of the most dangerous criminal organizations in the East Coast. Due to the extreme secrecy of the organization, not much is known about the groups chapters outside of the United States (Bahamas, Haiti, Jamaica, United Kingdom, Trinidad, Dominican Republic, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Africa and Canada) but great strides by law enforcement has been keeping the gangâ€™s main chapter in Miami, Florida in control post 2002, although MPD hints the group is still very active in and around South Florida including Miami.\n\nThere is a rumor that has circulated around media circles for years, before any rap artist can shoot a video in Miami, they must get permission from the Zoe Pound. Several musicians have shouted out Zoe Pound in songs and music video including 50 cent, Tony Yayo, Rick Ross, Trick Daddy, Cam'ron, Jim Jones, DJ Whoo Kid, Pastor Troy, Gunplay, Kodak Black, Future, Lil Double 0, Peezy, Bezzal, Spodee, Sett, Fat Trel, Meek Mill, Big Boogie, That Mexican OT, Kato 2x, 24 Heavy, Kollision, Young Dolph, Action Pack, Snoop Dogg, Peso Peso, Sauce Walka, Mac Critter, Boosie, Slimelyfe GG, Slimelyfe Shawty, Street Monstaz and others.\n\nIdentification[]\n\nZoe Pound is an international criminal organization with roots in Haiti, active in east coast United States to Canada to the Caribbean. The main chapters in the South Florida area do not wear any specific colors, in order to blend in and not draw attention from law enforcement but however some members tend to wear the colors of red and blue which represent the colors of the Haitian flag or the Haitian flag bandanna put on the left side which represents that the haitian flag is tattered on their heart.\n\nAccording to local and federal law enforcement, despite aggressive crackdowns on the gang's drug operations in the South Florida area, the gang remains active. Zoe Pound is the most dangerous out of all Haitian gangs in South Florida, specializing in drug trafficking. The gang is also known to work with South American drug cartels due Zoe Pound's control over some ports in Haiti (which lie about 1 hour from U.S. shores) and the infamous Port of Miami. The History Channel featured Zoe Pound Gang in Season 3, episode 12 of the acclaimed documentary Gangland which aired Thursday, December 4, 2008.\n\nRappers that shout out or rep Zoe Pound[]\n\nRedd Eyezz\n\nStreet Monstaz (Top-6 / ZMF High-Ranking)\n\n50 Cent\n\nKodak Black\n\nRozay\n\nTrick Daddy\n\nBirdman\n\nFuture\n\nLil Double O\n\nSee Also[]"
