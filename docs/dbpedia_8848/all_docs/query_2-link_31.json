With the current popularity of “Drill” and “Trap” music, he offers a unique perspective from an underrepresented hub in hip hop.” – The Source\n\n“Nooch is buzzing thru HIS city right now, Washington DC. the streets are def asking/waiting for his latest mixtape.” – World Star Hip Hop\n\n“Nooch is a rising rapper coming out of the DMV… currently getting shine from that area.” – Hot New Hip Hop\n\nThe nation’s capitol isn’t typically thought of as a hotbed for hip-hop. The birthplace of Go-go and Moombahton has produced precious few widely recognized talents. Wale and Oddisee (from the wider DMV region) are the two veterans that immediately come to mind. The drought seems be ending though, as a new crop of young MC’s like Fat Trel, Shy Glizzy and Black Cobain, have been attracting national attention. It’s time to add 18-year-old DMV-native Nooch to the list of promising DC talent. With one project under his belt, he has already proven himself a capable artist in his own right — to date his videos have amassed nearly 500,000 views. Having already worked with MMG’s Fat Trel as well as fellow DC protostars Shy Glizzy and Black Cobain, Nooch has positioned himself to take his place amongst DMV’s rap elite.\n\n[wpex click for full bio]\n\nA listen to 18-year-old DMV-native Nooch quickly reveals an artist who listens just as much as he speaks. A certified engineer, Nooch is equipped with an ear for music that goes beyond the usual trap-inspired tunes of his peers within and outside of the DMV. While many artists strive to create a singular sound by which they can define themselves, the 18-year-old rapper rejects that notion all together, hoping that each song is its own experience that simply adds to a greater one. Thus, differentiating is where Nooch excels most. He nods to the artists he looks up to while adding his own essence to each track. His versatility combined with his fan-first approach to making music sets him apart from the sounds of his region and radio.\n\nThe son of Boobe — one of DC’s most respected underground artists and label owner — it should come as no surprise that Nooch would fashion himself a rapper as well. It wasn’t until 2012 that he decided music was something he wanted to seriously pursue. At the urging of his father and friends, he stepped into the studio for the first time in February 2013. The result was a bass-heavy banger titled “Gotta Go” that proved Nooch’s potential, 17 years in the making. Soon thereafter, he shot a video that landed on WorldStarHipHop.com and garnered over 60,000 views in the first 24 hours. The positive response motivated him to record and release a project, his first, in only 3 months, though one could never tell. His debut mixtape, Rookie Season, received positive reviews from the Washington City Paper saying “the tape’s overall shrewdness—from its RGIII-themed cover to its guest spots by DMV studs Fat Trel and Shy Glizzy—fits with a DMV scene that seems to get more sophisticated by the week.”\n\nEven with his father’s decade of experience and ability to create quality product at his fingertips, Nooch, has no need to lean on his lineage. 2014 promises at least two releases: a collaborative effort with Baton Rouge born, Atlanta based artist Cerdafied and a second solo project titled Sophomore Slump. Despite its name, Nooch is confident his second effort will turn heads. “If more people hear [my music], they’re going to like it,” he says. “They don’t have a choice.” With Rookie Season in the books and the forthcoming Sophomore Slump, which is slated to include features from the likes of Paul Wall and Wale, Nooch is quickly establishing himself among the top tier of emcees expected to gain national renown as eyes and ears continue to turn toward the DMV’s burgeoning rap scene.\n\n[/wpex]\n\nPress Releases\n\nNahRight Debuts Latest Single from 18-Year Old DMV Rapper’s Forthcoming Sophomore Slump Mixtape\n\n18 Year Old D.C.
