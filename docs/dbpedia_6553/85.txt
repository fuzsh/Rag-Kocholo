In Operation Snatch Terry-Thomas plays a British officer during World War II who is charged with the welfare of Gibraltar's barbary apes. When he detects that the animals' morale is slipping, he devises a plan to go behind the German lines to "kidnap" a new ape to lift his charges' spirits before the Germans find out about their condition and use it as propaganda.

We love the fantastic, and highly appropriate, '3 wise monkeys' imagery on the rare country-of-origin UK double crown poster for the 60s mad-cap caper.
