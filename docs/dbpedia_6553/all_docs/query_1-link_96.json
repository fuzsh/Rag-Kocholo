First up is Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre (2023). Then we move on to The Covenant (2003). Finally we review Snatch (2000).\n\nCheck out more of our Triple Feature reviews.\n\nMark Radulich and his wacky podcast on all the things:\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/markkind76\n\nalso\n\nFB Messenger: Mark Radulich LCSW\n\nTiktok: @markradulich\n\ntwitter: @MarkRadulich\n\nAlso check out the W2M Network Discord.\n\nA focus on Guy Ritchie, Operation Fortune Ruse De Guerre/The Covenant/Snatch Review\n\nYou can now watch episodes of Radulich in Broadcasting Network in Video format on the W2M Network Youtube Channel.\n\nAbout Triple Feature\n\nThe name says it all, a triumvirate of movies reviewed by Mark Radulich and Co that usually all have some kind theme that ties them together. There’s usually at least one new release included along with two other movies that could be older or also new releases too.\n\nAbout Radulich in Broadcasting’s Beginnings\n\nMark Radulich has been an internet personality since 2004 with his Progressive Conservatism blog. He then took that blog to the airwaves and created a podcast for it. It then changed to PC Live. After that, he brought out the 411mania Ground and Pound Radio as well.\n\nAlso, Mark would partner up with another 411mania alum, Sean Comer, to create the movie franchise review podcast Long Road to Ruin and then Robert Cooper to create the metal album review podcast, The Metal Hammer of Doom. Robert Winfree took over the MMA show and then added his own podcast, Everybody Loves a Bad Guy. That’s when the Radulich in Broadcasting Network was born. Joining Winfree in having their own podcasts were super fan’s Jesse Starcher (Source Material). Finally, Winfree and Radulich added a weekly movie review show to the ever-growing lists of podcasts on the Network."
