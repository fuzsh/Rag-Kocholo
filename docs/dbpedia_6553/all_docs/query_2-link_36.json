Jimmy Wright documentary and shorts producer recorded on the 15th of January 1990. Interviews Morris Stevenson and Alan Lawson side one. Sorry Marinus. Um tell me what right. Jimmy perhaps you'd like to tell us when you were born and a little bit about your childhood. Well I was born on the 18th of August 1922. Uh the east side of London Manor Park. And. At that time. My father who had been in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War had gone back into the Royal Air Force because in 1918 the RCC became the Royal Air Force and so at that time my sister was two years old. Joan and we lived with. My grandmother. And it wasn't until father came out of the Royal Air Force I think that was 1928 when talkies started and uh he he wanted to go into the newsreel business which was just being formed and uh I think British movie tone was the company you know that uh. He joined to begin with and then a few years later possibly 1930 31 British Paramount decided to start a newsreel and he joined British paramount. Jimmy can I can I ask what did he joined his own eyes. I think he was uh mainly on the road but whether he was you know endeavouring to to sell newsreels to some of us individually in different parts of the country uh that might well have been. It was a kind of an administrative capacity of when when he left to join Paramount he became general manager so I think as I remember it uh in my school days because we had moved first of all to. Halston because he was he was then based at the School Road North Acton which was nearby and uh when he joined paramount. And then uh we moved out to healing then and that's the place I remember you know much more than I do my early days. I think I was about seven or coming up to eight when we moved to hitting the so I was uh kindergarten school in healing then and I left uh the age of ten because all the boys had to leave. Then I went on to a prep school called Denham Lodge which was uh just on the border of oxygen Denham close to Arthur Kingston remember. Yes well just just opposite Arthur Kingston's house to the lodge. And I was there until uh 15. I should have really left earlier but uh. I don't know how it happened but uh I left 15 and I went to the London Regent Street Polytechnic and I was there until. The war broke out. In September. What were you on the knees any calls. No I was. I was at my ordinary school uh the the school of cinematography was on the top floor and uh often I sort of looked at the sign in a rather longingly and hoped that perhaps one day I'd make it. But of course you know when the war broke out. The uh. Well first I would say that I had two main hobbies in my school days and one was a model airplane and building um. Solid scale models and uh flying models. And uh I had a hankering over flying and perhaps going into the Royal Air Force but I also had this uh uh tremendous interest in photography and uh in nineteen thirty six when I did a cycling holiday just before my 14th birthday uh I bought my first camera in a little town of Bon on the River Rhine one pound thirty of white land a brilliant 445 lens and uh side uh took quite a lot of photographs while I was cycling up the Rhine think we cycled about 500 miles. I did part of the journey back on a river steamer and part by train packed cologne and then by train back to Ostend and across in the vote. And um anyhow uh. When the war started the film industry of course virtually came to a standstill shooting at Cannon. I think they were making the thief of Baghdad then and uh production stopped. The Americans went back to America and uh everyone thought there was gonna be uh bombing and uh. Perhaps even invasion. Anyhow. I got a job. My school was evacuated to Somerset and uh I think my father quite rightly said as a war my son you must do some work. So I had to go and find myself a job. So uh I got a job in uh Lloyds Bank in Uxbridge and uh I stayed there for almost a year and then technicolour at that time. I think we're getting involved in making gunnery training films for the Admiralty and George Gunn who is head of the Canberra department was a near neighbour of ours and friend of a father. Both being involved in film work although in totally different areas of film production. And uh I think George knew that I was very keen. To get into the film business and he had lost three technicians who got into the Royal Air Force and. That's how I compare first jobs John's working in the camera department a Technicolor songstress that was on three strip. Yes. So I had to learn. How to load up 3000 feet of negative and not get it in the wrong order. That's for sure. And also of course unloading and getting it leveled off in the right hands and uh as I got involved in different types of production. Often we had to break down the film perhaps into several sections I might be having a stack of say nine cans with three different tests all going into full. They're all in the dark. Of course total darkness. So I had to be very careful about. Loading and unloading film. It was in the camera department but at that time yes I do indeed. Because in the Cannon department John Marlowe was head of the optical department and we had two brilliant mechanics Bryn Jones and Ron Hill and Doug Haig who had joined in technicolor. I believe from Gilford. Doug was a very experienced technician and he taught me a tremendous amount about. Optics and stop motion photography which of course was what he was very much involved in as he was in charge of making the films on air gunnery training. But there was also Ron Cross and the camera department. He was a technician in charge of the three strip camera and. Just trying to think of the other technicians of course Jack Cardiff and Jeff Unsworth were the two lighting cameramen. And Harold Hazen was the technician that I worked mostly with. And then oh the the most extraordinary break I had within just a week of starting work in the camera department. Was there was a location. At struggling Bay which involved two cameras Jack Cardiff Harold Hazen and myself and on the other camera Freddie and Henty career Penta you may remember I joined the Royal Navy shortly afterwards and was lost in a midget submarine attack on the turf it's suddenly. But uh everyone said my goodness you've got a marvellous break actually going out on location so soon. I mean the training normally I'd take the colour was quite considerable before you actually went out with the camera crew and were entrusted with taking the prisoner masters that. Padded box and handing it to the uh to the technician to uh to rest on the knife edge. Behind the Camera gate the gate because of course there were two two camera Gates does this restrict camera so I had this this marvellous uh break travelling down to switch and uh the whole operation was the um I think it was called the Petroleum warfare board had the bright idea of setting the sea on fire is an anti invasion. Yes device device I tried and the idea was that uh uh they had uh reservoirs of oil up on the cliffs at struggling Bay at intervals there was a pipeline running down the cliffs side across the beach and out into the sea. And then each pipeline uh fanned out like the spokes of the wheel of a part of a cart. And at the end of the spokes a jet of oil would be released and it would come to the surface making a pool of oil and each of the spokes uh the pools of oil would would eventually join up and make a complete pool very large pool of oil and then the pipelines were carefully been carefully calculated how they will be separated along the beach so that eventually each pool of oil joined up and made a uh a wall and they would ignite the oil using carbide floats and eventually as I say the sea would all flare up making this big wall of fire. And uh Freddy young and Henty Crear were in a boat acting as the invaders. Jack Cardiff Harold and I were on the beach filming it from the defensive point of view. I'd say the camera got very very hot and I was a bit worried that the the uh Canada Balsam that held the prison together you know might uh melt. Yes I believe this did happen when before the war when the the camera crew was shooting one of the world window series for Fitzpatrick on the slopes of love for service. I think this actually did happen. This is true yeah it really is. Yes. Carrying on it. Well my. My work has as I say was mainly involved in the beginning with animation work. Sometimes it was cartoon work because Eric Gill the artist set up an animation. Studio where he had a number of artists painting the cells and uh downstairs in the Cannon department we were filming their cartoon work which was all involved in a gunnery training for the Navy. Sometimes we were also shooting model aircraft assimilating attacks by either Japanese. Torpedo and bombing aircraft or the German ones. And uh this was done by. A track was set up in the Cafferty File and in the studio there and the camera was mounted on um for us later. The wheels have been taken off the voice later and uh the whole the lost later could be moved along. At very small distances while we shot the frame at a time stop motion. Tracking into the model of the aircraft the little models were mounted against black velvet they were painted white. And the reason for this was that when the negative was developed the aircraft would become black and although it had little. Markings these swastikas really or the Japanese Uh. So as I write this I tried these could just faintly be seen and we would shoot the sky backgrounds down at Rams gate on the end of the jetty there. And we'd set up the camera so that we had 180 degrees of uninterrupted seascape and with the sky on the sea horizon as we needed it and the clouds were shot in a silver surface mirror which operated horizontally and vertically on two camps and the depending on the attack of the aircraft the cabins were cut accordingly and the person who worked out all the very clever mathematics of how the camera should be shaped to create the. Movements of the aircraft was of course Bernard happy. At Technicolor brilliant mathematician and optical expert and so we we would shoot the sky backgrounds and it's there was the Sky Movement which gave the impression that the aircraft was flying through the air because as I say the air the little model aircraft was static in the center of screen all the time but we were tracking in close to it to give the impression that it was diving towards the ship. That's how we that's how we shot the attacks and these were used in the dome teacher which I believe George Gordon who was head of covert development. I think George and Bernard have you were the creators of the doom. Teacher principal so that the the gunner could set up inside the dome and have complete 360 degrees if he knows if he needed to go all the way around the dome. And these little films would be projected. On the sky backgrounds of the those the I think this is how it was envisaged. And of course the domes were constructed at Technicolor crated up and sent to all parts of the world where there were naval establishments and air gunnery training was in progress then then after then after that what do you do anymore. Oh yes. Oh yes in between times. Excuse me. The British Council had commissioned documentary companies. Several were I think members of the film producers guild and uh Technicolor were employed because of course there were only three three strip cameras in this country at that time and it was the color was purely commercial colour process. So if you wanted to make a film or cinema showing Technicolor was the process to use and. The British Council were financing a series of documentaries featuring main salable products overseas. For instance uh Harris Tweed. Porter Tweed are. Materials made in cotton. The clothing industry and Yorkshire cotton in Lancashire. Class pottery Crown Derby pottery Wedgwood pottery and the idea was that these photos will be shown in North and South America was the idea of boosting the export trade to help pay for the war. Do you ever get to operate a camera at technique. No. Um I was uh. The clapper loader in my earliest days and filling in the report sheets. They were very detailed. I'd take the color you had to. Fill in a full description of the scene. The lens. A distance the camera was when the object. And on the reverse side of the report sheet you had to then fill in a color description of each scene and uh footages were very carefully noted because the cost of making colored prints was very expensive and the producer of the filming color would only very sparingly print up to take color color sections. That. Would have black and white of selected selected takes and uh which we used to shoot what was known as a color pilot at the end of the scene and. One of my jobs was to take the readings front and at 45 degrees on each side to get the camera readings for Jack Cardiff who was the cabinet man that I mostly worked with on location give me when you say you had to do a description a color description of color was there under state guidelines. No no no I was just one zone free interpretation of the colors as as they appeared at the time. Um Jimmy when you were Technicolor was this after you'd been attempted to join the RPF and were rejected on. The grounds of your eyesight. Or was that this was after just a few months after because on my 18th birthday in 1940 I was working at a bank at that time. And. I didn't start working take the for about another two months leading up to months afterwards. Perhaps you'd like to expand on that a bit about wanting to join the RPF. And be discovering that your eyesight was lacking. Well I think you know at that time. As I say the film world had come to a standstill I was fully in time as it were working in the bank. I didn't really enjoy particularly that sort of work because it wasn't what I really set out to do and and several of my friends who were in the. Oxbridge model era club with me and also the number 14. Squadron. A DCC the air defence Cadet Corps. So several of my troubles had already joined the Air Force. Soon after the war broke out and I think I felt well it was I was 18 and now I could go along and join up but it wasn't as simple as that because it was then that I discovered my my sight wasn't good enough. I was a bit short sighted not a lot but enough to be turned down. I think at that time you had to be absolutely spot on. I think perhaps later on in the war maybe the site tests weren't quite too stringent Jimmy give me a can I go back to you you mentioned about Arthur Kingston across the road. Did you ever go across to Arthur at all. Well yes yes I did because he was a great inventor. Oh he was a fantastic person then. My father knew him very well and uh the mill club was just around the corner and uh I've put it all down so it's okay. Arthur and father I often meet in the middle class and talk about Arthur's uh inventions and so forth and uh and also maintained all the newsreel cameras at British paramount. And in fact he he invented this marvelous slow motion camera for my father which would change for normal speed to slow motion almost instantly. I think it was just a loss of perhaps a frame and a half or something very very my Newt. And for newsreel work this was very spectacular. Didn't did he did he did have his workshop in. Did you have a workshop in his garage. Well he had his yes he had his workshop uh in the in the house. They hadn't but later um I think the headmaster of the school. Was called up and. The gymnasium that I used to use when I was at school there was turned into houses workshop. So I. There was an old old building just across the stream street when I ran right through Arthur's house. Uh and and in between our school grounds and uh this building which I don't know whether it was uh a stable beforehand converted into a gymnasium but that became Arthur's workshop. Now. Let's get back to taking place. You've been talking about the British Council commissioning these films. You were involved in those. Yes I uh I worked on several I worked on uh. Uh. One called Harris Tweed which we shot in the Outer Hebrides. Harold Hazen Jack Cardiff myself. Charlie Tester was the sound recordist and uh Don weeks was the assistant. Who drove the through the the the truck the shooting rate that we used as the camera car. And. You know with Technicolor equipment it's pretty bulky and we had a three wheel Dolly. Location one in the back. And. What was known as a lightweight blend because I was shooting this so I could tell you though in the end it was with that with Jack And don and Harold in the car. There's only room for me on the roof so I literally used to travel sitting on the roof of a car. This was great to me in the Hebrides because it was a pleasant countryside no traffic anywhere just single track roads and uh every now and again we'd come to a gate at the end of a huge area and I'd have to slide down off the roof open the gate that the car goes through close the gate and get back on the roof again. And that's how we would drive around. Lewis and Harris visiting the crafters cottages and we had all four whether it was such a shame because. Terry Bishop was the director and Terry had gone out beforehand and uh to suss out the locations and the many matters for the boat. He said Oh marvellous great. The weather's been terrific from the next day on. It rained solidly for about a fortnight and we were confined very much to a little hotel road all of the south end of the islands. But we did sort of knife out and snatch scenes just whenever we could. But the location went on suddenly a bit long as intended and um part of that particular film we had to do a lifeboat sequence because the story was around the Hebrides and lad. The boat had been torpedoed and he was literally steering the boat back to the island again. And every day the director would look out the window and they out seized on raft after they chaps. And eventually. He thought the weather was right and the lifeboat was towed out including a few local seamen. And this young man who was going to do the steering and uh Jack Cardiff Harold and myself we we bolted a top hat to the to the one of the seats in the lifeboat and. We were duly towed out of the sequence but unhappily the tow rope broke and we started to drift and the boat really at one stage we thought we were going on the rocks and it was the camera we were thinking about more than anything the loss of the Technicolor camera seeing as how there are only three of them. You nearly lost one on Western approaches. I believe so I believe sir Farrow Jack was being sick. It was it was a sorry state. Where is that. These fishermen they found a bit of sail in the and the bottom of the boat and they they all had no mast. They were literally holding it up and uh it catches the wind and they and how they brought us in through a little narrow inlet without getting on the rocks. I'll never know because it was very close very close. Well the uh only feature that I worked on in the short time you know that I was to take the colour before I went into the Royal Air Force was the great Mr handle which I think was also ranks first venture into the feature business other than the religious films which he had been making before. And of course the the story of handle was in a sense uh slightly religious. Yeah. Did you ever see is TV film. Yes I did. Yes. Yes. Besides time did you buy you that when we started. I'm just wondering. Well I think I may have seen it in Technicolor. When we when it was finished what a stink. Well frieze green you know it was the cameraman or allegedly the cameraman but Jack Cardiff was keeping it more than holding his hand. I think so. I think so really and truly yes. Anyway so what did you do on that when you were you on the floor. Yes. Harold was uh was operating when he was focusing and I was. He was focusing the actual camera. I was uh learning focusing and I was focusing viewfinder and um I'm tracking shots you know and loading and unloading my first actual break as a technician. It was life and death and kind of. But I only worked right at the very beginning on artists tests and you know some other tests before the actual. Production shooting started because I at that stage I felt I really ought to join join up. I'd lost lost several friends in the RAF and uh. What did you do on those tests with the artists tests with as an operator as a technician I know there was a difference. The uh the I forget who the like to be involved crass interference. No Chris was in the area then because um um Bobby Pascoe showing me the camera I mean might not I'm not sure. I think he was afraid quite impressive. But I'm all right. I think it was going to be Jack Carter's first. Major. Love of feature lighting. I think Jack did light it in the end but as I say I only worked on tests and then went to the into the service. When would that be. This is in May I say. April May 42. The form unit. I'd heard the foam needed to be informed. I think at the end of 41 and that's that's what I wanted to try and do to get into the area foam unit so you would have done basic training first. Yes I had to do that when I joined at Coddington. Like most most of the RAF ground staff did and I went out to Great Yarmouth to do my square bashing. We were living in their ladies houses the been acquisition. They were empty and we did our square bashing up and down the streets on the front. But the all of us and I was there actually when at that time the Jerries were doing what they called the by Decca raid and sort of TIFF and Rowland may. Be the parish church was I think the largest or the oldest in East Anglia and that was their target and they they set fire to the church with incendiaries and then came back and machinegun the firemen. All they were trying to put the blaze out but that was the only attack we had. You know whilst I was in the office then I went to a straight one for. A test before going on to the School of Photography. There were two schools of photography no one was at Farnborough no number a Blackpool. And I was destined for the number two school of black and I spent nearly six months there until December 1942 when I passed out and actually was posted to Pinewood. I never thought I really would be posted the film unit because you you very rarely were posted to your choice of unit. I could have been posted anyway but. I had said that you know I particularly want to go into the film unit as possible and I had some motion picture experience and lo and behold I was first fired. So I have Christmas at home and uh I never went straight over to them. So you're living in the economy then to launch the kind of man hours it was within cycling distance of Pinewood Studios then when did they send you on the gunnery course. I suppose I was about a couple of months also at Pinewood and. The time was spent we had three aircraft based at Benson and Anson Hudson and a Beaufort Flight Lieutenant Haggard was the officer in charge of the film unit aircraft and. These were used for making films. Aircraft recognition films navigational training various training training films that we did and that is where I I learnt. From my experience with using a camera in the air with people like Chris Janice. Dennis and Hala. Gill Taylor he was really he was the film unit and. Harry Waxman was then trying to think of other ways gallium to try it again. He had already gone overseas. Yes he can. In fact when he was here when he was killed I was posted out there to join the desert airforce. Yes I I went to stormy down. I think it was in March 43. To do the gunnery training course and I think it was in part the end of April when I completed the course. I let it stop me. I wanted to know really. Yes sir.\n\nTranscript\n\nShow Speaker\n\nYes I think it was the end of April. Maybe just the beginning of May. But I guess the big surprise of course at the end of the gunnery course was that I was offered a commission. I hadn't gone on the gunnery course for anything other than two to gain aircrew status because I wanted to join the Operations Unit of the film unit and you can fly on ops and else you had me a crew category and I think it was thought that not only was the air gunnery training course the shortest of all the air training courses but we'd end up being able to shoot a gun instead of shoot with the camera if necessary. And as I said I'd end it ended up by becoming a pilot officer. You didn't save why you were on the commission. One never knows these things like how they were about I suppose I'm trying to see how many of us were on the course. Difficult to think back. Must be it must've been 50 or so US and six of us. Were offered commissions to do rather well. That's what I was told that you the crew. Oh well I can't remember exactly how well I did. I did well. Yeah i i i i love the training. You know I even in the photographic course as well lied. I knew at the end of it it was all going to be of no use to me if I got into the film unit. It was all very interesting and it involved. The overlying. Cameras that we used the automatic cameras of the aircraft and uh and so on and I felt little you know immensely interesting and and also the still photography and processing work it was all all interesting and I enjoyed it. Did you have to do both still photography and cinematography. Well on the on the actual photographic course of flak for it it was all still photography. The automatic cameras processing the enormous long rolls of film that we used in the in the automatic cameras printing huge lengths of film and then doing a bit of identification you know trying to read the photographs although that was a highly specialized job well that's kind of navigation. Well I went really from the point of view of assessing damage after a raid or or identifying targets before a raid. I mean it was mainly W's who were employed at Medina near Marlow. The special unit for identifying I forget the one forgets over the years the actual terminology of Peter their titular work pattern. And then of course we were we were using still cameras it was. It was all interesting. Coming back to find now. Yes I tried to remember other names who actually ask Skeeter Kelly of course was ahead ahead of me if I at least probably a year by the time I overheard was how I joined Jerry how do. You weigh. Terry Holt was or he was away I think yes he was already away. I'm trying to think of Lee Howard Lee. Lee was still on Monday when Lee Lee was on mosquitoes. We had one one mosquito aircraft Squadron Leader Patterson was the first the pilot and you know it was a fixed camera in the nose of the mosquito. And you name it. Yes that's right. You name the aircraft in Lee. Lee switched it on and off and you were very restricted to what you could do from the mosquito through the bombing. It was a panel that was all really very confined space as well. Well was David David Prosser was with you. Was he wave wait. No he was later. He was later. I was paranoid. Pat was the CEO. Yes. Pat was squadron leader then and he was he was CEO of the ops unit. Teddy bad was the wing commander you end up in Whitehall as we learned the twist overall in charge of PR one then take us home from. Let me see how do I. Oh I know. Well I'm coming back as well as a as an officer to the Pinewood um through them. It's Teddy bad. What was to say the least. A little thrown. I doubt he he what he was of a ruddy complexion. Well I don't think I've ever seen him quite so red in the face when I confronted him. And what we've. The words he used. We've known establishment for another officer. I don't know what I'm going to do you know he really was beside himself. He's quite quite funny and I'd hidden on one of the sets when I first arrived at the studio and uh I knew sooner or later I'd be said for uh. Sure enough I was uh and the furrow Teddy he he really didn't know quite what to do so he posted me as swiftly as possible. And Skeeter Kelly drove out with me to meth for a little satellite aerodrome to uh felt well in Norfolk on the borders of Norfolk and Suffolk and uh that's where I joined uh 4 6 4 and 4 8 7 Ventura squadrons 4 4 6 4 was the Australian squadron for its 7 was using the squadron and uh on the way up Skeet broke the news to me that um 4 8 7 squadron had lost 10 out of 11 aircraft the day before over Holland and. Q Have you heard much but uh it was one of those unfortunate incidents when the ranger. What kind of a plane was that. Ventura was a twin engined Lockheed Aircraft. Um conversion of the Hudson which was smaller and uh it was affectionately known as the flying pig I think because it was a pig to fly apparently and uh. It had this belly to allow for the bomb load and slightly swept up fuselage at the back. So that uh a rear gunner could lie flat on the floor and under fire um comes two twin guns. Towards the rear of the aircraft. It had um it was ill defended. That was the only defense it had. And um it had a small Astrodome for navigational purposes and. Navigator and pilot uh wireless operator upfront but we removed the Astrodome and had a wooden shield built and a wooden platform over the main spar of the aircraft which was immediately underneath the Astrodome so that I could stand on the loading platform and I'd just be head and shoulders above the top of the fuselage of the aircraft with the windshield protecting me from the slipstream and I could then have a 180 degrees panoramic view of what was going on in the sky of other aircraft or you know if we were attacked too. And then the. Bomb polymers panel was there at the Gunners panel I should say at the rear of the aircraft was a bullet uh piece of glass you couldn't film through it because the clarity also wasn't good enough. It was very thick and dense and uh they made a special frame with with um a quick release levers and I could turn these levers and with withdrawal the pins and lift the whole. Panel out. It was very very heavy and it only came out easily when the aircraft was one of its sort of downward movements and I could quickly lift it right out and then fall through the open space had a clear clear view and so I'd lean over the edge and balance the human Sinclair camera on the on the frame. I had to make sure that that whilst I was looking through the viewfinder and seeing the target and the problems going down that I'd actually got the lens of the camera which was lower down and. Made sure that was clear of the aircraft. That was it. Did you use this at all or was it always humans only. Very occasionally the eyes were almost entirely I used an even simpler camera single answer. Yes. Do you have any. I could. I could change lenses. Oh yes but I mean they used the 50 mil lens because that. That gave me. You haven't a lot of time to change lenses. And if I was filming other aircraft in the formation we were usually flying in a box what was called box formation in threes. With boxes of six aircraft with a box of six flying slightly below and behind us. Because I nearly always flew in the leading aircraft so that I would be filming not only the our own target being hit by our box of six aircraft but the box of six following behind what what. Other lenses you had presumably Thirty five fifty three. I had the 35 the 50 and 75 those were the only one that is right. Yes yes. But I I use principally the 50 mil really all the time as a double spring clockwork motor. And just about had a running time to complete a bomb run and the bomb bursts before it could quickly wind off again and to get other shots. How many banks did you carry on. I only used to take two to go on a bombing raid because. They were 200 foot schools and I only used usually around 100 to 150 feet of film on any depended on how many other shots I might take. But then that I was confined mainly to depending on the type of aircraft because you see I flew in a lot of aircraft where you could only shoot through the bottom part of the aircraft like Boston normally Baltimore. It was only in the Mitchell where you had a small side window that you could open and film horizontally. You know this was a side venture it was a big exception you know having this special platform and being able to shoot over the top of the aircraft as well as you are. Where was your film processed. It was all processed under guard at ranked laboratories. Well denim labs as it was known as their space then I think the rushes were waist up to the Ministry of Information and the Army Navy and Air Force chiefs used to view the material shot by the three services and decide which could be used for propaganda purposes and which had to be retained either for secrecy points of view for the archives I've seen some film that you shot using the color of King George 6 inspecting your squadron. Yes. Well the the the visit of the king and queen. That was in May I think towards the end of May. It was really because of this tremendous loss of 10 out of 11 aircraft for its seven squadron that when when the squadron was reformed I think it was common practice for the king and queen to visit. Where they've been a major loss to boost morale and like they would visit. A city that had been heavily bombed and see the shuttle. What was this was 16 millimeter on a very simple Codex any special was 50 foot magazines of all of Kodachrome. I mean it was really the simplest possible camera and we were very lucky to get any color at all. I think I only had that probably was all I had at that time and I used it on the royal visit it was a joke. No it was uh it belonged to the film unit. Yes. Yes. Did that use much 16. Very very little. Very little. I think it was only. In the senior special in. Disney in color. And if it is as I said it was very very little of it around I I was allowed to. After I'd been with the French tourist squadrons for I think it was a matter of a couple of months. I was then posted overseas and I took the name Sinclair. Plus the Sydney special and a few magazines of colour. When you say impressive overseas roughly what was that. That was in custody in the beginning of July. I can tell from my logbook if you wanted to accurately turn that for you. He's 43. Oh yes 43. Yes a wee wee. I didn't know where I was. Going at all. I wasn't told. I was just told to get kitted out with tropical Kit Kit and went up to Euston and up to Greenock and boarded the ship. And even when we were in convoy we didn't know where we were going. The convoy went to Philip ville. First of all and our ship most of the of those on board were Army and Army nursing sisters and they. They disembarked at Phillip ville and then the ship turned around and went back to Algiers and I think I was the only one left on it. At that stage and the RPF had a small film unit had mainly moved up to Tunisia to El Moussa and. But there was a PR unit at Algiers that it'll be are up on the hill overlooking the bay and I was there just a few days until. He could fix me up with a flight to Halloween to Tunis. I think I stayed overnight as I slept sitting up in the airport overnight and the next day I went on to Malta to um to join two to three Baltimore squadron was in check who was in charge of the film unit. Well Arthur Taylor was the CEO of the number two film production unit and I think they were actually at Del Mar so at that stage and then I didn't see them at all in Sicily I was with the squadron we moved from Malta to Monte longer on the south coast of Sicily as the fighter boys moved up and the Germans were pushed further north their fuel became fainter we moved into Monte long. And then when the uh the terriers were finally pushed out of Sicily we moved up to GBP which was the airport for Catalonia I was flying I. Was the American 12th bombardment group. In Boston's from Cali and Malta. Bombing targets in northern Sicily and it clear it was with. A Boston Marathon. Boston squadron we were attacking a gun position on the slopes of Mount Bronte and several aircraft were lost in that attack and we got hit. In fact the aircraft bounced and I nearly fell out of this gate because I was filming through the escape hatch. It was a pretty big one on the Boston and it was the first time had flown in Boston and. I didn't realize you know how wide it was. You couldn't stretch your elbows right across the opening. Only over one side of it. And when we got hit some some flak as I say it felt as though the aircraft was being kicked hard. And I had a job to hold myself from falling through the opening. You didn't have your parachute on it. No you couldn't. You see the the crew of an aircraft all where the parachutes on the chest knew you couldn't wear the parachute and a lot of the cameras were there just wasn't room and only the pilot used to wear his parachute all the time and sit on it. He wore a different type of parachute and we had to steer it away somewhere and if we had to get out grab it quickly and clamp down. Was that the time that you had to bail out when you were hit. Not that time. No. That time you know we got back okay. No problem. But no it was later on when I was back with two twos two to three Baltimore squadron and we were then based we'd moved from Sicily to can Bucca Sally at dizzy and we were then. The Germans were then just beyond Naples. On the west side of Italy and where the American Fifth Army were fighting and Monty and the eighth Harvey were pushing up the Adriatic side of Italy and it was the eighth army that we were giving to the three squadron. Desert air force were giving close support. And as far as the army were then. They had advance beyond Fajr. They were off in the fast Fastow area on the Adriatic coast and we were attacking targets just beyond the frontline and it was in October of October the 15th we were attacking an 88 millimeter gun position which the 8th. Harvey we're having a lot of trouble. From. When we ourselves. Were shot down. By the 88 one of its guns and. We lost an engine and a lot of petrol because we were holed in the petrol tanks in the wings and. The aircraft. Momentarily went into a spin the petrol was flowing into the aircraft. I had the escape hatch opened you see because we were on the bomb ran up the time and I had to very quickly shut the escape hatch because the petrol might have ignited it was dripping from the control wires and. I was afraid it might get onto the electrical equipment and spark off a fire. And. But when we started to spend I had to open it again smartly because the by this time the wireless operator had unplugged his intercom and crawled from up mid ships and the aircraft down to where I was I was underneath the. Gun turret. And the wireless operator was ready to jump out. He had a bit more experience than I had and he probably in that sort of situation before. So he was ready to to to bail out and very soon after this the pilot seemed to get control of the aircraft and he gave the command to bail out. And so I signaled to the wireless operator towards the. Course he was unplugged and got his intercom plugged into two pointed to the escape hatch to jump. By this time the gunner was slithering out of his turret and climbed on his parachute. He indicated to me to go next but I hadn't got my parachute on at that stage it was stuck in the flare chute and I'd got the camera. So I signaled to him to go and grab my parachute planted on went to. I said to the pilot you know that I was I was going because until the pilot was totally separated from us at the front and until we had signals that we had bailed out he couldn't bail out because the navigator was in front of him in the nose. So he knew and the navigator had gone but he didn't know when we were gone so I said Well I'm just just going now and clamped on the chute went to field for the record and it was no cord there what I I'd done in a hurry I put it on upside down and the reporters on the left side but you couldn't change once it was clamped on you couldn't get it off. That was the whole idea. They were really very firm fasteners side although you know hope for the best. And I jumped and pulled a Rip cord and I was quite relieved when I heard the at the crack of the chute opening above me and I just looked up and there it was lovely floating away. And to my astonishment I read I could I could see it. We just managed to cross our own lines. I didn't know at the time which side we really were but I could see gunfire. Puffs of smoke and them around and. But I didn't realize that we were so close to the ground. So we must have lost quite a lot of height when the aircraft. Was out of control and it was several years afterwards when I met the pilot again and we talked about the bailout that he actually was unconscious for a while. There was a smell of the hundred octane petrol and his navigator in the nose the the quick release mechanism should have allowed the floor of the aircraft to drop away so that he could just fall out but it got damaged I suppose when the aircraft was hit and he couldn't he wouldn't. And he was kicking and kicking and in the end he had to operate it in the normal way as though he was going down the steps out of the aircraft and put the hatch down and slide out. Well when the air flew in at that stage the pilot must've been revived. Thank goodness for us because we didn't know all this was going on in the back of the aircraft. I suppose we would have you know if it had just gone on out of control we would have jumped for it anyway you know because your parachute was on upside down. Did it affect how you landed or. No it didn't. And I'd seen parachutes. You know when you go through all your training purposes you you you go into the parachute packing shed and you see how they're packed and and so on and and how the strands are stitched to the inside. To the heart back of the of the parachute pack. And they're all going out one particular way. So that is the parachutes put on the right way the strands are all going straight up to the to the parachute itself. So I knew they were being double back on themselves because it was upside down. And that's why I wasn't too sure whether they would hold when the jet and the parachute opened and with my weight on one end and the parachute. I don't mean opening art but it you know that the fastening must be very very strong indeed and didn't make any difference to left the camera behind. But sadly that was my only regret because thinking about it afterwards I might have been able to to wedge it behind. So I actually like it but I might have been able to wedge it behind the waiving of the parachute harness for myself and it might not have slipped out. I was very sorry about that. Did you have much film recorded on that camera that. Was far behind. Oh yes I think I might have got. We had dropped our bombs and we were actually on the bomb island and. I might have got you know some of the target jamming. I mean what kind of a landing did you have that. Well that was what surprised me as I said I looked up and saw the parachute was open and I looked down and the ground was coming up. You know really quite quickly I had no idea that I was as low as that side. I just quickly put my legs together bent my knees and just let myself crumble up as I hit the deck. That's how we'd been taught. I'd never done a parachute jump before. We'd only been practicing in the hangar swinging across and dropping onto onto a mat to assimilate how hard it would be. You know when we hit the deck you were attached to the Eighth Army do you say that particular or you told me you were having trouble with this gun position. Well uh to to three squadron right throughout the North African campaign and these systems Sicily and Italian campaign they're so occupation as one of the squadrons of the first tactical air force was giving close support bombing Patton bombing the German gun positions and their supply columns and so forth. So we were always attacking targets very near to our own front line. That wasn't your father also attached to the wealth father had there before I even joined the Air Force. He was already flying with the 8th Air Force from Basim Vaughn. On a raid over. France Holland Belgium and later in raids into Germany. He was hit. He volunteered to join rejoin the airforce at the outbreak of war to film. And they they didn't want to know. They said he was too old and he must've been only 41 in 1940 because he was born in 1899 but they said no no you're too old and so when the Americans came into the war he volunteered. But he was in Italy wasn't he. Oh late late on yes he he seems to be here 41 42. He was with the 8th Air Force in this country and then in 43 he when the landings in Algeria took place. The was the first and the first time I advanced from Algeria I met up with the ATO in Tunisia. Well he went out to Algeria with the. Condor and joined the flying fortress squadron that was attacking deep penetration into. Sicily and Italy and prior to the Sicily landings. And. Eventually he joined the 5th Army on the ground when they were at. I think the army headquarters was Caserta just north of Naples. And I think that was called the Gothic line with the. They dug in in 1943 for the winter of 43 44 before the advance on Rome. My father was at the Battle of Cassino fulfilling and then went on to to Rome. I got a note here that in autumn 1943 you met Ian Struthers somewhere in Italy. Yes. That was so that was very soon. That was it must have been in October of 43 when we had moved from Sicily to Cannes Pocus Charlie. And. I think I'd done three my first three raids from a camp focus Charlie. And. You know they were all taped up with all the report sheets. We had a special despatch bag labeled up for PR one Whitehall. And it was a question of getting that delivered to someone who was going to be going back to England as soon as possible. And I happened to see a figure I recognised in the shape of that in Struthers in his tropical kit with his war correspondent insignia on the shoulders. Right. When did you know him from. Well I'd met and. Because he he was a newsreel camera earlier with British paramount. And so I think I must've met him. Might have been of Brooklyn's one of the race meetings that I'd been to. I know I had met him and seen him before. So I was quite astonished. I've got some quotes here. When I talk to him and you said Who are you. What's your name and you must know my father. Because he. He said that you approached him. Really. Yes. And then of course he knew. And yes I. Because he was quite a individualistic person you know. I mean I think he had a moustache. He. I don't know any vaguely. Quite a small world. All these cameramen and I keep bumping into each other. He's quite a little dilatory sort of figure was over here. Anyway I said I had this problem was getting as he. Oh no he said that's no problem over there and pointing to a pilot. Had got all his gear ready to jump into the aircraft to go over and have a word with him. That's Lord. Douglas Hamilton. And he's going to be flying over the top back to uh Benson because he's he is he's flown non-stop here on a photo reconnaissance. I think he must have been from Benson and. He actually took my films back. They couldn't have got back more quickly than that because otherwise it might have been. Well if they'd have gone by air they would have gone back to Algiers to Gibraltar and then Gibraltar. How I suppose you had to use quite a lot of initiative and change to get your films back when you were so far afield. Yes it was. It was a question really of locating somebody in Transport Command. I mean often at a CO 2 would fly in with supplies of one sort or another because I mean in the early days of going from Sicily into Italy. Taranto was was mined they couldn't take any ships in there until all mines were cleared so all the supplies for the Army and the airforce were all flown in by Dakotas I mean they were marvelous. They just flew anything and everything in bomb's wheels petrol carry cans of petrol everything. Well that must have been very close to your accident. Yes I had gone. In December. I left the squadron and I went to Naples for a bit of a rest because in the meantime you know I've done quite a lot of ups from Malta from Sicily from Italy including the escape in October when we were shot down and I think the CNO probably thought good I did have a bit of a rest and I went over to the unit and moved them from Giovanni. So from a convent close to Bari on the Adriatic coast they'd moved over to Naples at Vollmer. That was at the top of the Finnish killer railway in Naples and. So I was over in Naples for a little while. Then I was sent to Gibraltar to join the. Catalina flying boat squadrons with Bill Wilbur and the UK with some. Bill and I were attached to the flying boats for a few weeks because by this time the the Germans were beginning to remove the submarines out of the Mediterranean because of the advance of the ROV towards Rome. And the idea was hopefully we would go out on anti submarine patrols with the cat leaners and and get some strikes and we did one or two very long trips Sunday night 20 20 are flights. Out into the Atlantic up the Portuguese coast into the Bay of Biscay and back. But we didn't we didn't get anything unfortunately. So Bill and I. I think we had a signal from Arthur Taylor saying you know catch we've gotta get back to Naples and we were having a drink in a bar and an American Liberty ship captain we got into conversation with him and he said well I'm sailing tonight. Why didn't you come back with me. So we we thought well we're not in any great hurry to get to Naples the way we've still got to somehow get a flight to Algiers and then pick up another flight from Algiers to Naples stocky.\n\nTranscript\n\nShow Speaker\n\nIt was lovely. It was in January. Lovely sunny day rolled off her shirt sleeves we were up on deck and then we went down had a lunch trolley had lunch. They were feeding off food fresh food from the fridge not pulling beef and biscuits and the kind of tack we're used to having come out from the States. They got plenty of meat and vegetables and so on in the in the fridge. Well this was all very fine and we was sitting up on on deck just watching the sun disappear into the sea and some little ships started putting a smoke screen around the convoy and we sort of took this as normal practice. In the air in the evening but there sooner had they laid the smoke screen then Jamie radiates appeared through the smoke right down on the sea and they started dropping torpedoes on the. They hit the ship on our port side. I would think just the stern of mid ships and it just disappeared. I've never seen what I know seen a ship go down before I seen a model shot in the studio. We've done that before. But to see it go down and nobody had a chance to get off was really quite horrifying and it just didn't seem real at all. Well the next thing there was a hell of a big bang and the ship heaved up and the nose went down into the water. We had got a hit ourselves up front and. We were rushed for our life jackets and ready to take on the lifeboats or jump over the side whichever we had the chance to do and the ship didn't actually disappear it went down with the nose into the water and settled and. We were taken off by. Little rescue ships which were among the convoy. They'd be doing the smoke laying low before. So we had time to get off and take our camera equipment and. Eventually we were taken ashore it all ran and Bill and I thought well person safe to fly back the rest of the way. Well that's what we did. We went again. You didn't manage to get any pictures of that because you were. It all happened so fast now. It was very unfortunate from that point of view. I mean the last thing we expected was attack at that stage in the war to to be attacked right round the southernmost corner of Spain. I mean had we been up in the Mediterranean nearer Italy that would have been a different matter. But these aircraft. Must have taken off from an airfield in the south of France. I think we discovered afterwards that it was Montpellier. And. You know they had flown some some considerable distance for the type of air twin engine aircraft in those in those days. And they were they must have gone out over the Algerian or as close to the Algerian coast turned and attacked us from the most. Unexpected area as well. And they were so low that it was difficult for the ships to shoot out them without hitting our own ships to sea because either they were right down so low as they came across the convoy they were then beginning to climb up and away. But. The gunners must have had difficulty you know for hitting the other ships. So when you put a short Iran where did you go from there. We flew to Naples during and then we had to lift into Dakota taking supplies to Naples. So it was you know very soon after that I I went to Corsica where we were flown over. I went on my own on that trip that we had an aircraft. Attached to the film unit for transport purposes. And I was flown over two years of that here on the east coast of Corsica where there was. An American Mitchell squadron and set number of air Cobra fighters for protection put a detachment of four marauders from Number 14 squadron which was based at bleeder just outside Algiers. So there were four aircraft. That bleeder for Corsica and for that Taranto critically. And these aircraft completely covered the whole of the western Mediterranean for low level reconnaissance activities. They had had the bomb bays. Converted into long range petrol tanks. So the aircraft from Corsica could fly all up the coast of Italy. From. Just south of Rome. Right up. Along the southern coast of France and spy out the coastal travel and coastal vessels. Or submarines or any hostile enemy any ship radio back and the petrol bombers would go out and they were fitted with a heavy gun in the nose of the eye of the aircraft. And so they could go in low level and fire shells at the coastal ships and sink them that way. And with some fighter try to cover if necessary. So I was in Corsica for a short while and then I went to. Back to Naples and that's where I met Father and we had a little celebration. So he gave me a very nice watch. My 21st birthday which had I'd spent in Sicily Monte longer under canvas in a cotton field where we were we were. Using us which we were using a spare bedroom and so we had a few jugs there and then I went back to Naples and then went down to grotesquely to to rent her to join the other detachment of marauders. To complete the assignment off. It was the only squadron of marauders in the Royal Air Force so that was the reason why I was and I had done one one reconnaissance trip with up to the Adriatic to try SDP and polar and then down the Dalmatian Coast among the islands down to the Greek islands to Piraeus and then back to Toronto and done some filming of the movie ground staff working on the aircraft to make have a little story. And. I was taking off to do some air to air shots of another Marauder to complete the story of the air of the squadron. When we had an engine catch fire port engine on takeoff and we were just airborne when the. Pilot became aware of what the engine was on fire and of course we he tried to turn and get back to the airfield again but she would not fly on one engine at that height and there was no. One. We had no time Willhite to bail out so you know we just ploughed in cartwheels and burst into flames and that's that's what happened. I was lucky in the sense that. Because the American. Ground crew I think we came down in an olive grove which was being used for camouflaging supplies and bombs and so on and I was rescued from the aircraft by an American I believe and the tail of the aircraft. Was blown clear and we had the chap who was with me in the rear part of the aircraft. He went with it and. I didn't he he got you know but he he got a broken bones and put the chaps up front and so presumably that was a full fully tanked up aircraft with all these extra fuel tanks. I tried and so it was just like a furnace like a flying petrol station really so. That was an interruption to your career and was suddenly the end of my career as a cameraman. Yes so after your your parents or your father came to visit you. Oh yes he. Was roughly where and where are we now in time. We're in February the 20s. Nineteen forty 1944 when the accident occurred and um I was given 48 hours and the registrar who was an Army hospital. And. When the registrar was posting those who had been killed I suppose you'd been told I was only going to live for 48 hours. He posted me as well. So my mother was unfortunate really because she got a telegram saying that I died as a result of injuries received which was why must be an awful shock to her was farther away as well. Both of us away and um. Fortunately as I say father was on the other side of Italy with the 5th Army and when father told General Akers what had happened he he said well you know this is why aircraft go down and see your son. And you can fly him back to England. You know if you can. But. You know when father arrived and heard that I'd already been posted as dad he was absolutely furious. Needless to say because at that stage I was to the land of the living. And he managed to. Because I was heavily doped with morphine. Kill the pain and also I think with the idea of giving me. An overdose to let me just slide away peacefully. And he said well you know I'll find out whether my son wants to die or not just stop giving him the morphine and I'll talk to him. And that's. I vaguely remember seeing the flash of a camera because I saw that I mean I remember making some derogatory remark but even then he couldn't. Hold himself back from his foot photography. Taking a picture of me. I must have been a sorry sight cocooned in bandages and so forth but. He wasn't allowed to fly me back to England. The colonel in charge of the hospital wouldn't allow it. And I think on the grounds that I probably wouldn't survive the journey. But I think also he was highly embarrassed by having posted news or having been writing you off. Or yes writing me off prematurely. But father ordered him to move me to another hospital. And I was transported off over the mountains to Bari on the Adriatic coast to the 98 British General Hospital that even they really hadn't got any facilities for tackling the severe burns and that fortunately they were going well they were going to take my right hand off the next day and remove the right eye. And a surgeon a plastic surgeon from another hospital just a short distance up the coast was visiting the hospital and fortunately. He removed me to his hospital and. Saved my right hand by grafting round the wrists. He wasn't sure whether the grafts would take but he said Well I'll have a gun. And he put my hand in a splint and he said he said well if you know if you were never able to move the hand afterwards at least you will. You'll be able to carry things and you know it may be of some use but the grafts took. And. I was three months in the hospital while they were trying to clear up the burns as best they could because they hadn't got behind bars. And. Each time I had to go down to the theatre and had to be anesthetized once they were doing dressings and putting a little bit of skin in one or two places to cover up the bare bone and she can only now cause and. I think they they tried to cover the left eye. That's at the bottom because the left eye wasn't so bad as the right eye. I'd lost completely my eyelids. I was in a very bad state and of course I'd lost all my hair naturally and I had all been burnt off and eyebrows and quite a bit of the nose. Anyhow Ticky battle was the plastic surgeon there. And I through my life I guess to him and certainly my right hand. No doubt about that. And after three months he allowed me to be flown back to England. And that was from forger to Naples Naples to Algiers. I had to wait in at the RAAF hospital there about 48 hours until there was a liberator taking engine. I think the range and crankshaft back to England for a refurbishing and re grinding and delivery to took me from Algiers to Gibraltar where we refueled and then he did an overnight flight flying over Spain which he shouldn't have done. But that was the only way of getting back as quickly as possible. And. Over occupied France coming down. Over the channel. We had a fighter escort in landing at. Lyneham in Wiltshire and then I was flown from London to Gatwick which was just a cross aerodrome and Mercedes and then by ambulance to East Grinstead that's where I started. How shall we say Archie Mac and doing his team with the Queen Victoria Hospital really started to get to work to cure the burns completely because they had Brian Barnes and to start some serious plastic surgery. He um I always remember I haven't been in the hospital very long and he'd done a day's operating and was doing a ward round after tea and a tremendous pain in the right eye because it was uncovered you know the eyelids column and I was badly damaged and he took one look at it and he said oh no I'll come back after I've had some suffering and we'll see if we can cover that up a bit and that's the kind of man he was you know in indefatigable came back and with the anaesthetist in his theatre sister and I went down for my first operation that he squints did to. Get some relief innovating covering up the right eye of him. Well that was the start of a whole series of operations which went on in between visits to some Dunstan. After eleven months in hospital the first eleven months actually they can do. He's known as the boss to all of us in those days. We've only refer to him as Archie since his death. But he was always the boss to us and uh. And uh oh we we thought he could cure anything and anyone impulsive or just took a little bit longer. Anyway he gave everyone tremendous confidence and and hope for the future a New Zealand directly and he had learned his trade if you like from another New Zealander Sir Harold Gillies is his cousin who was as first was virtually the granddaddy of plastic surgery in this country in the late twenties thirties I think he looked after you know a number of things. First war casualties and so Archie said Well I'm giving you arrest now for six months and build you up and I'm selling you just nonsense. I don't like the idea of going to an institution as a sort of an sort of that put me out put you right off and the fact that he he had said after four years of plastic surgery and rebuilding the face and the eyelids. I probably have a cordial graft operation and recover some sight. Not Ernie and the right eye. But they're certainly in the left which wasn't quite so badly damaged anyhow. What the boss said went nowhere. I went to Church Stretton in Shropshire in January 1945 for six months or nearly six months training. And it wasn't a bit like I'd expect it certainly wasn't an institution that it was rather like going back to school again. And of course I met lots of chaps from all three services including. Air raid wardens. Merchant Seamen all walks of life before the war had lost their sight. Then some were suddenly far worse off than myself. Some had lost their hands as well as their sight. And so it wasn't really as great a hardship. As I had anticipated. It was great fun really learning braille and typing and carpentry and handicrafts doing a fair amount of drinking in the evenings. I think that's where I learned my drinking and I never regretted ever learning Braille. I'd always been opposed to it whilst I was in bed in the hospital and someone had come to see me and I think some nonsense and Ray arranged a visit and in the hopes of getting me started but I just didn't want to know about braille then. But once I was trapped Stratton and everyone else was having their brand class their typing class and so on. I I soon got into the routine and I couldn't be without Braille and I stopped him. What was your resistance. The Brown was it perhaps you thought it might be all right. Well that was it. You see I thought What a waste of time when I learn braille I'm going to see again. And that was my philosophy really. All right. You know as things turned out it wasn't. I had many many operations but only when I whilst I was at East Grinstead for the last three years in between father plastic surgery. But even when I left the hospital and started work back in the film industry again at Shepherd. I went to France and had to walk on in graft operations at different times but after I'd had seven. And no result it was pretty obvious that the retina had been badly damaged either by. Glaucoma which had been one of the troubles by the corneas weren't successful or it could have been by x ray treatment that I had received to endeavour to kill blood vessels which for spoiling the corneal grafts and. Which would destroy the lens of the eye. So I had a cataract. Have that removed and I think the X-rays may also have affected the retina so uh I just gave up having anymore. So when you introduce it. When did you finish your rehabilitation policy. Well I left hospital in nineteen fifty one apps after seven seven seven years. Yes. In and out of hospital and. Several of my troubles from the film unit days. Jim Davis Skeeter Kelly. Eric Cross. They. Had formed together. A small company and back in I suppose about 1945 46 when I was at East Grinstead. They had been visiting me in hospital and asked if I would like to join the company and put my gratuity into it. This is what I did and I used to visit in-between operations just to see what was going on and get the feel of the studio life again. And as I say in 1951 I left East Grinstead came to Shepparton and. I lived in a little hotel at the bottom of many hit Lane here Riverside Hotel little family hotel and I lived there for nearly two years whilst I was looking for somewhere to live couldn't find anywhere at a price that was reasonable and decided the only thing was to try and get a building licence and find a piece of land and build my own house which is what what I did. What was the name of the company Anglo Scottish fickleness because the Scottish element was Dick Andrews who is a great buddy of Jim Davis in the VIP days before the war and. They had decided to be a good idea you know to former and so they skates was a part of it. And then several of the other members of the film unit Charles Heath got to remember them all not to have a challenge to this. I didn't know where he is now. He went to last I heard Charles was about as Addis Ababa would be setting up a television station out anyway this is the house that you you built. Yes. Yes it's original form anyway. Yes it was. I was limited to the amount of money I could spend on it by the building license regulations and what materials could be used. But I was very lucky you know to get a license as a single person. They only usually allowed to marry or to marry married couples. But I was allowed a license on the grounds that my parents lived in economics and travelling from economy to Shepparton was a very difficult journey to nearly two hours on three buses. It really wasn't very practical. And. So I was allowed a license by my Oxbridge council and we had that transferred to. This area and then it was the task of looking for a piece of land which wasn't easy even in those days but eventually be most of the land here in Shepparton was owned by the Lindsay family who owned the manor house. They built the railway line from Shepparton to Strawberry Hill in the latter part of the last century and. Built. Colonel Lindsay was alive in those days and. Said there were several old houses that had big gardens and there was one empty one on the corner of any gate Lane and this was the the site that I finally settled on and it was leasehold at that time for that matter the great thing was to find somewhere to build a house. And. I then had to pay a development charge because you had to pay a development charge in those days as well. Well a lot of formalities to go through and I was impatient or took a long time. But eventually the house was built in nineteen fifty two and I took up residence in November and. I've been here ever since. Tell us about this cottage. Well Angus Scottish had. A very small room in the old house but the studios. Norman Loudon was the owner of the studios in those days and it was sound city. Originally of course and. As the company expanded what we were then given the park keepers lodge at the old entrance to the studio which was closed. And. When I came to work for the company that's. Office sharing it was secretariat was the old dining room of the park cave as large as the front door opened into just this one main room in the house and. The Cutting Room was a kitchen but the back was turned into a cutting room and the bedrooms upstairs. I think it was free if I remember rightly returned into offices very cold place in the wintertime time and there was a question of wearing one's overcoat. Well I've put up with that for a little while and then decided to get one of these oil stoves with the pink paraffin that was available in those days off a blue ocean. You. I said yes one was one was pink and one was blue. What was it. Anyway. That was how we how we used to heat the key for large I didn't I wasn't too sure in the beginning whether I was going to come to terms with the office side of me all of us might even be of any use in that area because I knew nothing at all about the front office the front office. I always thought that we owned the camera crew did all the work and I often wondered what what the dickens they didn't take us. Anyway I soon learned not only all the preproduction work that weeks of work that went into the preparation look shooting was the least of one's work. That was a matter of days or weeks and then there was all the post-production afterwards going through the cutting rooms the laboratory work titles recording commentary dubbing negative cutting funds and print all the procedures that were really as I learned more and more about that side of the business it became more and more interesting but suddenly in the very earliest days when I was just answering the telephone to get to know people and to get to know what it was all about. That was a bit of a struggle. How did you feel about that Jimmy when when you were you know first took the plunge. After all your rehabilitation it must have been mixed feelings. Well I think you know as the let's face it seven years have gone by and I got used to helping him to see it that time. So I No. One's thoughts when you're re rehabilitating when you're having training your thoughts are positive. I think well they tend to overlook the difficulties and things you can't do when you concentrate on the things that you can do to try and do those you know to the best of your ability. And I think each and every one of us are different. Inasmuch as it's easier for some of us to come to terms and overcome those problems than it is for others. And I think the least to dwell on what you're missing and what to what you can do better. You can't turn the clock back. You've got to look ahead and as I say concentrate on the things you can do. But did you ever think that you would ever be working in the film industry again after the trauma of the accident. Well I had. Not really I think in the in the very earliest days. I just know you know what I was going to do. I suppose I all my attention for the first year or so was in getting on my feet again getting getting over the burns getting started on the on the plastic surgery side. I had not thought a lot too much about the future. I mean had the biggest shock to me was being ditched out of a service within a few weeks of arriving back in this country. As soon as I was registered blind I was ditched out of the service is no use anymore and that you know I really thought that was. Terrible. And very quickly we set about. Putting that right not only for myself but getting me the discharge regulations from the hospital. For all service people changed. And it was with pressure with the. Threat of publicity and the threat of. Of. What we were going to do. That. Turned the tide. In the House of Commons. I mean Archie Mac can do is right behind us and a great champion. My father was around then for our time. What he was going to do from the press side. I dread to think that. I'm sure it was the pressures that. Were on it was changed I the ruling was that no servicemen would be discharged until he had reached surgical finality. And that was when the surgeon said well you know I've done all I can. That's it chaps. You. Know. You're leaving. So I was reinstated and I stayed in the service for the next six. Maybe seven years until now knew for doing this. I didn't get any promotion. I. Know they lost. But all the. Other Ranks. So sergeant got an automatic promotion to warrant officer right up to a double entry only to you had to learn officer but I didn't get. Anything here. I mean when you first came back on this. Deck during your plastic surgery day you came out. Yes. Very early to try and see how. Well it was I was say about. What. Would happen to you then and to what you are. There. That's a bit of a hurricane. I did a terrific job was a bit of a mess then. Yeah yeah. You. Must know I mean. I wish I may not but this isn't finished. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna have.\n\nTranscript\n\nShow Speaker\n\nEvery time. We try to feel as you were saying you can be about a particular song that meant that we go yes. When we started what we started. We've started this is this is signed for. Right. We move in a rally. Really. You were saying Don't. Take the kind of members of the staff they're very supportive. Well yes he gave a clarity I don't know if you remember he gave it up. Nobody was very very good. What do you remember Peggy. Peggy was continuity on on the adamantly films and. Peggy Mossman who became Peggy Charles. Was the secretary in the Cabinet department and and her assistant was Mary. And when I was in hospital the marvelous thing I think was the way they used to collect funds and they were always sending me records. I've got a marvelous collection of 78 records. Semi classical popular ones at the time. I mean it was all down to down to Technicolor. And all those who were involved in I was raising funds. I really did appreciate the interest that was that was taken and the visits I used to have and in those early days in hospital is tremendous. And then when you when you'd come out and you were starting with endless gratitude you get like marital. Opposites. Well were you. You know I don't. I I think I made one one visit perhaps but. No I was once I was in in work. But. English Scottish work got very very busy when commercial television came on the scene. I mean the size of the company from just a handful of people rapidly rapidly grew. I mean we had our biggest problem was finding the kind of small studio space that you needed for making television commercials because the main studios were far too expensive and the stages were much bigger than we needed. And the only way we could economically produce commercials in that way was to to have a number of commercials to make and to put two stages and change from one to the other all the time build on one shoot on the other and so on and we used to go out to Hill Street where we had a reasonable deal. I think the old BHP. Was it the youngest moon. Or no not VIP. And I just tried to think a British national yes I tried British national and I think as a studio manager he was such a well-known Percy Dayton wasn't he paving a boom operator was Percy day and I got to meet PERCY Well I think it it's a long time in Peabody right now. Him. For MGM. Oh yes. Yes it is. What is it became a big piece. It became such in television. That's right. That's right. Absolutely. It was too expensive to true to Shepperton. We very rarely shot chef. Although. There were. Occasions when cut off from studio with what we did in the air. We couldn't find a large house with a ballroom. To convert. That was the idea we had rather like Braithwaite. Yes. That was the kind of place we were really looking for. And eventually I suggested to the architect who designed my house we'd give him the draft of drawing up some plans for a small studio and just see how much it will cost. And in the beginning everyone's at all that's going to be far more money than we can afford. But nevertheless you know we'll go through the exercise and we'll see how much it does cost. Well as it turned out. Val else's plan was costed and we found that for thirty thousand pounds we could build the studio three thousand thirty thousand. And it was a lot of money. In nineteen fifty five Yeah I suppose in those days the tremendous amount of money but for that amount we built a stage 60 by 60 and managed to build a smaller stage. 40 by 60 which is now a Hollywood studio. And. We didn't have enough money to put the. Floor down at that time but very soon once the studio would raise the money which was easier than we thought. Much easier. And we built a studio and it was being used then very soon after that we were able to put the floors in and. We also. Set up a sound department that we had our own recording and dubbing yet hadn't gotten. While projection theater came you know in the beginning when we called the studio but. From about eight of us in 1951 when I left hospital. By the time the studio was operational and we also had a converted cinema in Adelstein which was the Plaza cinema. And that was being used and was up for sale because a company got into financial difficulties and before we built elephant studio we acquired the old Plaza cinema and we were using that for small very small set animation work trick trick trick work. In those days we had this very painting doing matte shots Derek paintings making models and. Tooling going to of course was in charge of all our animation work. He'd been an editor in the film unit and resolve principal editor and dangerous Scottish when the company first started. But when we got into making advertising films mainly for Cadbury brothers they were our principal clients and we were making colourful advertising films for the cinema. And then when commercial television started of course we were one of about a half a dozen companies that were experienced in making commercials so we were very quickly employed making television commercials. But we went back to black and white. That of course until. I suppose about 1963 as far as color started I forget exactly what it was that BBC toured going on but later than that I think that a little later that year could well be I know BBC 2 was first starting to go into ITV when I came back from America in 1968. I made the very first commercial in colour for Jerry Paulson. Ninety percent of everything that was being done at that time was in black and white. So it was as late as 68 even as late as that. Yes I mean maybe sixty seven there were some big made is but eventually when the studio was complete and was in full operation and then the Adelson studio we were 80 80 on the staff we had for cutting rooms for editors working full time for camera crews. Full time no one on one particular day I remember we had seven units working with four of them in different parts of the world on location jobs Granada Television desperately needed the crewing they had the administrative ability but they hadn't set up a studio and it was technicians and so on. And when the current affairs program search light which I think Jeremy Isaacs was involved in in those days in his very earliest days in television. Bill Lloyd was in charge of production in Manchester and I used to provide the camera and on crews and all the stock arranged the processing and. They used to shoot in different parts of the world during the week. And it was always planned to arrive back on a Friday evening to catch the bastard Humphreys on Friday night. And then the rushes went on several M train to Manchester. And the editors were busy working over the weekend cutting the programme to go out on Monday night Searchlight always went out on on a Monday night. And I think they just projected the rushes today all the day I guess. I don't think they even had time to cut the day entering. But they were exciting very exciting days no doubt about that. But it was a really full time job. At the height of television commercial work I suppose I sometimes have. Around 50 individual commercials all in production. I was production manager by then and they were either in the. Early stages of planning the casting preproduction work the actual shooting or in the post-production stage and. I used to have to do a daily progress report on everything for my own purposes. I had three secretaries working for me then and I used to keep one busy completely on progress reports so that I was able at any time of the day know exactly where a particular commercial was and. This was vital really in the post-production stages because agency producers very often would get onto another. Production and you had to watch carefully. Reading an optical double head day making sure that you. Were left with sufficient time to get any alterations done negative cutting answer print and then the television coffee's 48 hours before transmission because if you if you didn't get the prints delivered if you got a 10 percent file of the cost of the airtime and it was missed and. Tell me. You say you hand me the tapes you know keeping up keeping up to the secretary keeping up to date on that on schedule you have a dual purpose typewriter. I mean so you were I wouldn't be able to read it or measure in Braille. No I never put anything in Braille except my notes. That I took on the telephone. I had a brain shorthand. I did a shorthand Braille course. Just before I started work so that I could take notes telephone conversations fairly fairly quickly but only that I could really read them back just like any shorthand typhus can only read erm because you get into your own method of of. Writing shorthand just as he was shorthand Braille and I used Braille for convenience but not for pleasure. I don't read braille books and. I just haven't got the patience you know to do it. But I keep all my files. I had. All my technicians in files divided up into the various categories of work followed loaders focus operators lighting cameramen sound camera operators boom off raid this mixes you know I mean I could very quickly look up a telephone number and most of my my work. Was done on the telephone costs and very often the evenings because technicians were out working during the day and the only time you could contact you in the evening when they got home self-satisfied production schedules and so then. You rely entirely on your memory which must be fantastic. Well I think a blind person does tend to develop the memory because it's one of your your storage goals and assets really. And I don't claim to. Remember to any telephone numbers obviously the ones that you use very frequently I mean the labs and the various technicians. Suddenly but up to me I would rely on my Braille records very much which would dictate your secretary. Oh yes yes yes. I always dictated as I say every day I would I would write up the progress of each on each job and then at the end of each week all my notes were duplicated for the. Only production create agency to know our own by see our own produce. Because we had a London office by then and we had three or four chaps whose job was to you know wine and dine the our clients and keep them sweet and keep the work flowing in because you know having built the studio we had to keep keeping us fully occupied as we could. And. That was one of our jobs to make sure it was busy busy and we used to hire it when when we had a stage to spare but suddenly it was mostly our own production. Who were your producers and cameramen and editors during that period. There must be some good old 818 names there. Oh well I mean Frank Kingston was. On the permanent staff then. Eddie up was Palin's Jim Davis was how he was a director and chairman of the company. He was principal cameraman staff cameraman as I say but. We had just trained to think they all. Had the gilding boys there then. No they well they started a little bit later on you know towards my last year or so with the company but. Editors we had Julian corn to run run run trainer came to us from the labs and just forget the deal that headed towards but we employed a number of freelance cameraman as we needed. You know we got to know different different ones and you had an animation section and did you. Oh yes. Yes. Who were your animators. That was Julian Julian Corn who was the principal is in charge of the whole the animation and. I'm. Just trying to think of pop pompously type latest. N1 brothers. I mean we How. Yes Jeff and Roger first worked for us in those days. Jeff in the cutting room to begin with. Then he said he really wanted to direct. I gave Jeff his very first job. Actually I was a little export commercial for I think it was Cousin soap but it was something which we haven't a big budget to do and he was so key and he had obvious ability. He never looked back. From then onwards. He was giving giving me lots of small props to learn his trade. And then he very quickly left a simple freelance as so many did you know I mean we had John Spencer a permanent director Len Reeve directing David Paul Tanguy on the staff directing. Did you have a chap called Harold Mac from the animation side. Here remember and here for Howard Mac the name's Smiley he's dead now but he left England. Uh the latter part of the 60s and formed a company in Holland in Amsterdam and he called his company Anglo Dutch. And he started language Scottish because I used to do quite a lot of work with him. He was a very talented man. Great sense of humor. I think it was just after I had gone I may well have been heavily be because you see when Julian and I left when we discovered that we hadn't got the interests in the companies we thought we had but we virtually had a share in the in the parent production company which was always the favourite was written on because all all the assets were into other companies that we'd been told we had an equal share and then discovered we had. So that's why we went well I gave the company ten months to resolve the situation and they were reluctant to let us write. So we left the occasional shock of their lives where we left because we were taking a big chance huge chance and I set up an office in proffer day's old house Shepperton studio. Was the Met artist that gets famous met artists from denim and. Had an office. Up there and for four years I was working from this office in Shepparton and then. Looking around for a suitable studio accommodation and in London because the advertisers really were working much more with London based companies. Whilst in the earliest days it was you know an adventure to come out to in Shepparton studios and rub shoulders with the Stars and the famous directors and producers but they were less less inclined I think later on wouldn't you agree with the keenness to work with a company in London that they could pop from easily and see and discuss a job them and so forth. And I was often told if I had a studio in London you know I would be more likely to get more work. Because I was lame the help of Layne Reeve who also left the company. We set up a small studio called them. But you know it was only suitable for small sense then we had to use studios in London if we had a fix it to build. There was what this could be. What year was this that you know the shady dealing was going behind your back and you decided to break away 61. That's when I left 1961. And so when did you actually moved to London 64 yes 64. You actually moved to London. Yes. Funnily enough the father was looking around for premises like he converted. We first of all found. Gold hawks studio in gold haul road and. Somebody called Freddy Roberts and earned it and it was up for sale for 25000. He was in financial difficulty. There was some John Hale's location so Grover Jones he was. He was in the basement. And. John and Benny Lee had a handful of lights and they were just starting their lighting lighting company Lee lighting. And it was an ideal little studio just the right size. I had used it before and. I just couldn't get the couldn't raise the money because he he had a number of deaths and you had to take on the debts. So Helen's as well as the studio that was the deal. And I could raise the money for the bricks and mortar. No trouble at all. But as regards his debts that was well it wasn't all so sadly we did get it. I believe that's Virgin's headquarters nine total. I don't know a recording studio but a father phoned. 73 Newman Street which was the ground floor was an old warehouse. It had a very it was a listed building and it had a mews a couple booths behind. So you had access for loading and unloading which was ideal for the what was a warehouse. Before that the floor was very uneven and I think it fell away about two or three inches at one side. Anyway we we got a what we thought was a good deal from the landlords and the carpenters at Shepperton Studios ladies a superb floor absolutely dead level I mean you could track on it without any trouble at all without any tracks really. It was a super floor and we soundproofed us and we had a very nice little soundstage there with an office suite conference room. My office secretary's office had a good sized kitchen suitable for food preparation for commercials and upstairs. We had. Quite a nice sized room which we turned into an animation department. So it was ideal for Julian to have his rostrum camera and our title artist and to work up there and eventually we acquired an office for Oxbridge aerial image. So we were able to shoot our own obstacles especially trick trick obstacles. Live action over Kirn cartoon work over live action. And we did quite a lot of subcontract work for other cartoonists and other production companies because the aerial image was a fairly new piece of apparatus. In those days and we could turn out obstacles overnight using this equipment and we had a cutting room and in the basement and makeup and dressing rooms in the basement. So we were able to cast shoot the net it everything under the one roof and process just round the corner Humphreys laboratories of Australian film labs. So it was really an ideal setup and I think the extraordinary coincidence was that it was 73 Newman Street was where the children's film foundation used to be you know in the early days when we used to do some productions for them the Anglo Scottish company. We did several children's films. You mentioned that your father found this property for you when you did your father get involved in your company affairs in any way or influence you. He was a great influence on your earlier life wasn't he. Well he was 57 when Paramount did a deal with the rank organisation and I think the deal was that Paramount around the world was getting rid of a lot of their overseas. I think that they were a little bit afraid of what was going to happen and they were divesting themselves of a lot of their overseas interests and rank. They did this deal with trying to distribute their feature films although the newsreel was still making. A profit not a big profit. My father had. A number of overseas versions going out every week. He he acquired the South American market even from the Americans which was quite something he didn't even go out there. He just sent a newsreel out there and they seem to like it and liked the deal and. So ranks took them over and then a year later shut down the newsreel. So that was father out of work and. The year before when ITN was starting up. He had the chance of of. Running ITN and he turned it down because he had been twenty seven years with Paramount and as he said he'd always been treated well. He had had a good good life was was British Paramount and he didn't want to just leave at that stage. Mind you he got nothing out of it because he got no pension or anything. He got three months pay and that was he was finished and he and of course even fifty 57 although he was very young young man his white hair. I think I must attend to my line never in that vein with white hair. You know they just. They were did they would interview him and then they'd say no. How old are you. As soon as they knew his age. I don't know. And and of course he. Let's face it his knowledge was specialized it was usually in the main although he'd been a cameraman as well in the during the war. So he came out of the film this is altogether. He had a shop at Richmond from Richmond Hill for a while and then when I started the high end film company I persuaded him to give give all that up come and live in Shepparton and. To be a sleeping partner and in the company. What year was that. Six to one. And it wasn't really. Good for my mother's house because she was getting arthritis very badly then and what was working in the shop shopping cooking running the flat as well. I mean really and truly she couldn't have gone on very much longer like that. And I persuaded father. Team to do is to give it up come in with me. I formed a separate company to hold all the animation equipment and I didn't license what salary I had came out of the film production company and. What money he he had came out of the equipment company. And every time we did any shooting we paid a higher charge to the equipment company for lighting equipment in the studio for animation equipment and slowly but surely we we built up the finances and that's how we were able to. Acquire the free aerial image and. That became you know really quite an asset a tremendous asset. How did you paint it. Absolutely. And the sad thing from my point of view is when in nineteen sixty eight. Production in the studio was getting less because advertisers as well as film producers in the feature field were tending to shoot more and more outside studios because it was cheaper they were going on location not only in this country or abroad for the weather as well. And commercials more and more were shot in here. You'd choose a nice modern flat but some furniture in it. And. The studio was idle for too long and I wasn't able to keep the rent rate sky. And so I had to close the studio and very quickly find alternative premises for the animation equipment and that wasn't easy because we had to find somewhere in the West End in the Soho area but somewhere that had the height of the ceiling height for the rostrum which I think was from memory and I needed to 12 feet minimum and. I also had to have a solid floor because you know to have really smooth animation and so forth had to be like that was the aim got married was sixty 68 sixty seven point six I study yes. It was one year one year after it was filmed it was a difficult year and I had I hadn't a very I hadn't a good director commercial director at that time and most of the of the good ones were forming their own companies it was the it was the period when splinter groups were springing up and. You know it was difficult from that point of view we hadn't a big enough capital to take home some with somebody at a very high high salary rate and also I think I didn't have a producer with me to grab the work I had a few regular clients who came with me when I left Anglo Scottish I mean there were tremendous. Without their continued support I couldn't really have got the commercial company going as well as as well as we did tremendous to me during those very busy years of production from about what 55 56 Up to you know the late 60s. What were the highlights of you know any awards or any special films that you made or any particular programs that year. We did the. Bob Hope we did some Bob Hope shows. When he first when the American forces were in Iceland. Attractive Vic I think the very first one we did for Bob Hope was a Christmas show he did for the American troops at Reykjavik and he he badly needed he had a programme going out for General Motors a one hour show regularly and. His brother who'd been a butcher. Was running the check hope he was running the the Hope Enterprises company and Bob would shoot the programs for Hope Enterprises and they would sell and so we did we did it one up there and then Wood Green CSA was owned by ATV. Lou great outfit in those days and Bob and done a deal with ATV to use wood green to shoot one of his shows and there again we we provided the three cameras needed one and trained one on tracks static static camera speed the usual three camera technique for television production. And then we've processed and we've provided all the editing arrangements. Did you know that there was a program on about two or three weeks ago about you know entertainment during the war and so on and there were a lot of Bob Hope shows. I guess that program. I knew it was coming in and Bob Hope and Bruce Francis Langford were being. Did anyone else see that program. Blank. But I wondered if any of that material were whether any of it was recent enough for it to have been yours. Because I suspect I might have been one up in Iceland. Others there was Reykjavik. There was a Woodley would Greenland and then we did order one we did in Casablanca. That was I had a telephone call here one evening from Jack hope from Paris on a Wednesday and he said we ordered. We want to shoot a programme in Casablanca. Oh we're flying out on Sunday. We're arriving tomorrow. Can you fix somewhere for us all to meet and. Have a production meeting on it. I only want a few sets one of a few prefabricated sets take out the usual three crews film one camera. Yes I said Jack. Okay. Call me back and I I just was on the telephone from the time the phone rang here just continually ringing cruise to see if I could get a three camera crews the three sound crews a starter because that meant they'd all got to get inoculations for four. Going out to Morocco. Next to that idea on the Thursday or the Friday ready for flying out on Sunday and then these I. Couldn't think where to have the meeting and then I knew they were flying into bobbing. SIGHS Oh well I knew the proprietor of the portrait Hotel a priceless chap called Louis hands. He was a great party because we lived only a short distance away in economics and I rang him up I said you got a room room room Louis of hope and all his entourage you can come in and talk him out and he fixed "
