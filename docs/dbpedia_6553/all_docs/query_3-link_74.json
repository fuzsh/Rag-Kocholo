        "text": "This study analyzes the monolithic-cum-essentialist portrayal of the non-Euro-American world in Hollywood movies, bringing forth the fact that the project of Othering is still at play but in different manifestations. This qualitative research endeavors to apply the concept of Orientalism to carry out a postcolonial analysis of the movie American Sniper. As Edward Said, decades ago, proposed a way to understand the notions of the West regarding East in his famous work Orientalism, the study helps to understand the embedded ideologies which are promoted through movies, and the way these discourses are used to shape the Western worldview about the East. The study highlights the fact that Hollywood, famous for entertainment and advanced motion pictures, is also being used for shaping the narrative of the superiority of the West. As Islam and Arabs have always remained in the limelight of the Hollywood movies, this special association of the entertainment media with the Islamic Orient is not just for the purpose of amusement but also to (un)consciously build unbefitting images of the East and portray it as a monolith of an inferior status for the common viewer in the West.\n\nThis research seeks to study whether students from the University of Western Cape have an awareness of what constitutes stereotypes and stereotyping, whether they are mindful of its existence and use in the generation of genres and their films, and the implications the students reactions present to the film industry and social consciousness. This study calls into question the cinematic representations of the African motif as accurate cultural representations. This research is situated in a post-Apartheid South Africa context where South African audiences have experiences a gradual escalation in their exposure to North American films, and specifically the negative stereotyping of the African motif in film content. The South African context in which the students reside in has existing racial tensions brought from the country’s past, as well as tensions with foreign nationals due to socioeconomic issues. The research considers literature on the definition, implementation and ramifications of the process of stereotyping by looking at four main stereotypes in the films District 9 and Lord of War respectively. This is done as a way of understanding the rationale that governs Hollywood film stereotypes. The research reviews literature that describe the defining attributes of the two chosen films genres, as a way of correlating the characteristics of the identified Hollywood film stereotypes to the films genre classification. The theoretical framework of the research consists of reception theory, uses and gratification theory, film theory, genre theory and social identity theory. These are used in order to settle the link in the UWC students’ reactions to the stereotypes themselves and the genres of the films, and to inferences on what influences audience viewership - from context to notions of group and individual identity. The research data utilizes qualitative research methodology to gather the data required and articulates the importance of the researcher utilizing film screenings. Data collection methods in the study include focus group discussions and a single semi-structured interview. The logic of the argument is pursued through a data presentation that presents the findings based on the demographic categorizations of gender, age, year of study and racial classifications. The data for each stereotype is presented as an initial identification of the stereotype and an analysis of the data. In order to link the primary problematic with the reasons respondents chose as to why they watch specific films, the three focus groups and one semi-structured interview are studied according to the identification of the choices, and an analysis of the choice based on the links to the genre of the films and the stereotypes within the films. The study conclusion includes a summary of the key findings and whether the research question was answered, and the significance of the finding. Findings suggest that UWC students are generally not aware of North American cinemas stereotyping, but are extremely conscious of racial stereotypes in specific films and readily embrace them in the genre of comedy. The students’ reactions suggest ambivalence to supporting South Africa’s film industry because their standards are built on an excessive exposure to Hollywood films which has set the precedence, and established dominion in the South African box-office. Findings also suggest that the simultaneous involvement of South African actors in Hollywood films, and the distance the South African film industry has to Hollywood contributes to the students’ enjoyment of films. The research’s exploration of genres provide clarity into how the gratification audiences receive from film genre like war crime that condenses social and historical experiences the way Lord of War does, affirms some of the commonly agreed to cultural symbols and values."
