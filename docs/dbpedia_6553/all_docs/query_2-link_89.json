OCTOBER 1, 1962 Vol. 81 No. 24 THEATRE REHABILITATION Modernization and expansion of mo- tion picture theatre properties will be given new Impetus as a result of rapport between the Small Business Administration and the .\\merlcan Banks Ass’n whereby the latter’s mem- bers are looking more favorably on making loans for such purposes. While, from time to time, the Government Agency has extended such loans, it was hampered in rendering this service in many deserving and worthwhile instances by the lack of interest on the part of local banks. But, now, the banks have modified their position and will support the Agency’s program. Until comparatively recently, theatre owners seemingly held back on needed remodeling and refurbishing of their theatres, until a year ago, when the Agency made more such activity possible by granting loans up to $350,000, for which theatres grossing less than $1,000,000 per year were eligible. Recognition that moderniza- tion of properties and improvement of operations by replacement of old, wornout equipment would increase attendance and income has been seen, not only to be helpful to theatre business but, as well, in stimulating building and other businesses throughout an area. In a report out of Washington published else- where in this issue, it is noted that Federal regulations limit a single borrower to receiving a maximum of $50,000 on improvement loans. However, as the SBA will make an equal amount available, the way is open for a great many worthy projects to be given the desired as- sistance. As the article states, “The SBA is hope- ful that the motion picture exhibitor, often in dire need of modernizing his theatre, will, through the new plan, find the road to the necessary financing easier.” And significant is the statement by Sam E. Fleming, president of the American Banks Ass’n, with reference to the benefits he saw in the program to small busi- ness. Said Mr. Fleming, “We think that it will be one of the greatest moves that has happened in enabling small business to modernize, compete, survive and prosper,” Doubtless, that includes small theatres, whose essentiality to the community is emphatically stated in an editorial that recently appeared in large display type on the front page of the Rich Hill (Mo.) Mining Review, viz: There is no doubt that, since the Booth Theatre burned in Rich Hill, it has affected the general business in Rich Hill, with every merchant being affected either directly or indirectly. The rebuilding of the Booth Thea- tre will not only improve the business section of Rich Hill greatly, but will also help each business in Rich Hill. The Saturday night crowds in Rich Hill are approximately half as large as they were when the theatre was in operation. While the Booth Theatre is an individually owned business, the merchants of Rich Hill should be cooperative and help in any way they can in seeing that this theatre is rebuilt. Television has lost some of its appeal and, with the rebuilding, the theatre would offer fine entertainment to both young and old alike. Let’s get behind the Booths and be helpful to them in any way possible in helping to re- build this theatre, which will help beautify our town as well as help bring business to our town so that Rich Hill can continue to grow instead of standing still or falling behind. Conversely, it already has been, and continues to be, proved that small theatres in small towns, given new life as a result of their being rehabil- itated and re-equipped, have benefited their communities and the area around them. But there still are many situations that, for one reason or another, have not been able to get the necessary work done. To these we recommend renewed or new contact with their bankers or the nearest Small Business Administration office. (Incidentally, the SBA office at Kansas City informed us that they do make loans to rebuild burned-out theatres. ) ★ ★ The Mirisch Record The record achieved by the Mirisch brothers — Harold, Walter and Marvin — in the short span of five years is nothing short of phenomenal. Setting out with the objective of producing top quality features, they reached that goal early in the career of their independent production com- pany. Their continuing success has been high- lighted by the winning of a substantial number of Academy Awards and with high-scoring box- office showings for their productional achieve- ments. The extent of the Mirisch progress is evidenced by the announcement that this young company has firmed a schedule of 20 productions to be made in the next two years at an approximate cost of $65,000,000. Considering that this pro- duct output will exceed by about 25 per cent the total of pictures made by the Mirisches over the past five years, this is, indeed, a gigantic forward step. From their background in exhibition, the Mirisch brothers have learned to keep a weather- eye on the boxoffice, focusing their attention on seeking out top story properties, top name players, directors and producers. Their forth- coming lineup reveals continuing adherence to this concept. The industry can well be proud of the Mirisches and their acumen in knowing what will make good pictures — and making them. f OCTOBER TO HAVE 16 NEW RELEASES FROM ELEVEN FIRMS Lipton Sees MCA Pushing Producfion at Universal More Than in September But Less Than Oct. '61; 4 Hollywood Films NEW YORK — After September, which had the smallest number of new pictures available for exhibitors to start off the 1962-63 selling season — a mere 15, the ma- jority of them filmed in England or abroad, October will be a little better as regards new product. The month will have 16 new pictures from nine majors, plus Buena Vista and Continental, as well as several foreign features from Embassy and other independents. TEN FILMED IN ENGLAND However, the 16 for October 1962 is four less than the same 11 companies released in October 1961. As in September 1962, the majority, or ten of the 16 pictures, were filmed in England or abroad with only “Con- victs 4,” “The Chapman Report” “Hero’s Island,” and “Pressure Point” actually made in Hollywood. “Requiem for a Heavyweight” and “Tv'O Tickets to Paris” were entirely filmed in Manhattan while “No Man Is an Island” was shot entirely in the Philippines. In addition to the regular October re- leases, Columbia’s “Barabbas” will start two-a-day runs in October, as will Darryl F. Zanuck’s “The Longest Day” for 20th Century-Fox release, and “Long Day’s Journey Into Night,” an Embassy picture filmed in Manhattan. The other important October releases are headed by “A Very Private Affair,” MGM’.s first Brigitte Bardot picture; “The Chap- man Report,” from the sensational novel; “The Loves of Salammbo,” an Italian ad- venture film; “Hero’s Island,” also an ac- tion film; “Swordsman of Siena,” adven- ture picture made in Italy, and “Almost Angels,” made in Vienna by Walt Disney, all of these in color and all except the Bardot picture and “The Chapman Report” ideal for younger moviegoers. The black-and-white pictures include “The Pigeon That Took Rome,” “Warriors Five,” filmed in Italy; “Convicts 4” (for- merly titled “Reprieve”) ; “Requiem for a Heavyweight,” from the famed TV drama; “Two Tickets to Paris,” “We’ll Bury You,” a feature-length documentary, and two British films, “Operation Snatch” and ‘\"The Hands of Orlac.” LEVELT BY COMPANIES Broken down by companies, the October 1962 releases will be: ALLIED ARTISTS — \"Convicts 4,\" the new title for \"Reprieve,\" which was originally released in June in a few spots to mild returns. It stors Ben Gazzara, Stuart Whitman, Sommy Davis jr., Vincent Price and Rod Steiger. AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL — \"Warriors Five,\" made in Italy, starring Jack Palance with Anna Ralli. BUENA VISTA — \"Almost Angels,\" produced in Vienna in color by Walt Disney, with Vincent Winter ond Peter Week. This is being teamed with a reissue of Disney's cartoon feoture in color, \"Lady and the Tramp.\" COLUMBIA — \"Requiem for a Heovyweight,\" pro- duced in Monhotton by David Susskind, starring An- thony Quinn, Jockie Gleason, Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris; \"Two Tickets to Paris,\" produced in New York by Harry Romm with Joey Dee, Gary Crosby and Kay NEW YORK — 'The recent MCA-Uni- versal-Decca deal will have a direct and beneficial effect on exhibition which will be measured by a greater flow of product, ac- cording to David Lipton, vice-president of Universal. Lipton, who was in New York last week from the coast, pointed out that MCA was doing something that no other company had done in many years and that was im- proving the studio, re-equipping it with the newest of technical advances and setting up plans for a big program of pictures. “Instead of cutting back on production,” Lipton said, “we are pushing forward. While television will play an important part of operations, there will be an intense concentration on motion pictures for the- atres.” Lipton said new stages were being built and, instead of selling off parts of studio lots, MCA would utilize all of the studio property and more, too. As for setting up a definite number of pictures for any one season, Lipton said such a policy had long been out-dated and no longer is feas- ible. 'The studio will not, and cannot, desig- nate a numerical program, but will make as many pictures as the company can handle effectively and can cast with boxoffice po- tentials, he said. To produce pictures just to meet a numerical schedule is neither economical nor good business, but, he added, there will be more pictures from Uni- versal. MCA is spending millions of dollars for general improvements and additions at the studio where it will make most of its pic- tm-es. Overseas shooting will be minimized, it is reported, and adopted only when an authentic locale is essential to the story. Medford, and \"We'll Bury You,\" a feature-length docu- mentary. \"Barabbas,\" the Dino De Laurentiis Biblical epic, is opening a few prerelease two-a-day dates in October. CONTINENTAL — \"Operation Snatch,\" produced in England, starring Terry-Thomas, George Sanders with Jackie Lane, and \"The Hands of Orlac,\" produced in England, starring Mel Ferrer, Dany Carrel and Felix Aylmer. EMBASSY — In addition to \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" produced in New York, starring Katharine Hep- burn, Sir Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards jr. and Dean Stockwell, which will open two-a-day engagements in October, the company will release several foreign pic- tures including \"Madame,\" in color, which is English- dubbed and stars Sophia Loren and Robert Hossein; \"Divorce — Italian Style,\" produced in Italy, starring Marcello Mastroianni with Daniela Rocca; \"La Viaccio,\" made in Italy and France, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Claudia Cardinale, and \"7 Capital Sins,\" made in France, starring Jean-Pierre Aumont and Dany Saval. MGM — \"A Very Private Affair,\" produced in Paris in color, by Louis Malle, starring Brigitte Bardot and Marcello Mastroianni, and \"Swordsman of Siena,\" pro- duced in Italy in color, starring Stewart Granger and Christine Kaufmann. PARAMOUNT — \"The Pigeon That Took Rome,\" pro- duced mostly in Italy, starring Charlton Heston, Elsa Martinelli, Harry Guardino and Baccaloni. Paromount is Lipton is of the opinion that everyone will benefit from MCA’s acquisition of Uni- versal and Decca: production, distribution and exhibition and all of the personnel connected with them. MCA Suit Settlement Hailed by Stembler CHARLO’TTE, N.C. — John H. Stembler, president of Theatre Owners of America, has hailed the settlement of the Music Corp. of America-Justice Department anti- trust suit as clearing the way for MCA’s entry into making motion pictures for theatres. “It is now the hope of all exhibition that MCA’s new production will be substantial and will put more quality films at exhibi- tion’s disposal,” Stembler told the 50th an- nual convention of the Theatre Owners of North and South Carolina in his address at the Queen Charlotte Hotel Tuesday (25). Stembler also voiced the hope that Uni- versal, now an MCA subsidiary, would use good judgment and restraint in the re- quired disposal of its film library and do “nothing that would result in any ‘dump- ing’ of films to free television. “The bad experience of all film com- panies when they opened their libraries to free television in the 1950s should have a tempering influence on Universal’s actions,” he said. Stembler also urged the Carolina theatre- men to try to eliminate competitive bidding, now that both the federal courts and the Department of Justice had found splitting of product was legal. He told exhibitors to “bend every effort to work out fair and reasonable splits” and distributors to con- sent to such fair and reasonable splits. also reissuing Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" star- ring James Stewart and Grace Kelly, with \"Roman Holiday,\" starring Gregory Peck ond Audrey Hepburn. TWENTIETH CENTURY-FOX— \"The Loves of Sa- lammbo,\" produced in Itoly in color, with Joeques Ser- nas, Edmond Purdom and Jeanne Volerie, and Darryl F. Zanuck's two-a-day feature, \"The Longest Day,\" produced in France with 42 name stars, which will be playing key city dates in October. UNITED ARTISTS — \"Hero's Island,\" in color, starring James Mason, Rip Torn, Neville Brand and Kate Manx; \"Pressure Point,\" made in Hollywood, starring Sidney Poitier and Bobby Darin. UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL— \"No Man Is an Is- land,\" in color, produced in the Philippines, starring Jeffrey Hunter with Marshall Thompson and Borbaro Perez. WARNER BROS. — \"The Chapman Report,\" in color, starring Shelley Winters, Efrem Zimbalist jr., Cloire Bloom, Jane Fonda and Glynis Johns. Governor Films will have a British film. “A Kind of Loving,” starring Alan Bates and June Ritchie, and Astor and several of the other independents will have foreign- language pictures to add to the October total. 4 BOXOFFICE October 1, 1962 BANKERS-GOV'T. AGREE ON LOANS Banks Assn Now Supports Plan For Theatre Modernization Financing Continue Streamlining At 20th Century-Fox NEW YORK — Determined to reduce the overhead of 20th Century-Fox, Darryl P. Zanuck, president, is continuing to stream- line operations and cutting costs to the bone. The field distribution system, Boxoffice was told, has been reduced from 900 per- sons to approximately 390. The 30-odd branches eventually will be reduced to about 17, w’ith sub-offices manned by a resident manager, a booker and secretary. The homeoffice departments are being tightened up insofar as manpower is con- cerned and the next step will be the se- lection of a sales chief for the foreign di- vision. Seymour Poe, worldwide sales chief, and Zanuck went to Europe last week for the bow of “The Longest Day.” Zanuck was scheduled to return immediately after the opening, but Poe will stay on and visit the company’s offices abroad. A reduction in key branches overseas also is on the docket. The company has three pictures, includ- ing “Loves of Salammbo,” which were pur- chased outright a few years ago but have been on the shelf. These are being pre- pared for release. Twentieth-Fox also will have feature-length pictures on the lives of Marilyn Monroe and Will Rogers, as well as another Robert Youngson film on high- lights of pictures of the past. These will be put into distribution as interim product im- til the company can get going on its own program early next year. It appears likely that no new 20th-Fox feature will be available until late next year, with the ex- ceptions, of course of “Cleopatra” and “The Longest Day.” There appears to be considerable opti- mism within the company on the prospects of the company pulling out of its present difficulties, although, admittedly, it will be a long, hard pull. Atlanta Exhibitor Charged Under 'IHegal' Ordinance ATLANTA — An eighth charge of exhibit- ing an obscene film has been filed here against Leonard Freeman, manager of the Kirkwood Adult Theatre, this time in con- nection with the showing of “ICipling’s Women” in defiance of the city film classifi- cation ordinance. Although only Friday Sept. 21, a Fulton County Superior Court found the ordinance illegal, police served the new charge against Freeman. In the past, the theatre manager has both won and lost on similar charges. On the sixth and seventh charges, he was given a suspended sentence of 30 days in jail and $53 fine, with the added proviso that upon further conviction the suspended sentence would be invoked. The Fulton county court ruling on the classification ordinance came as the result of a suit brought by distributor members of the Motion Picture Ass’n of America. The court withheld an injunction banning en- forcement of the ordinance pending an appeal by the city, which may be filed within 30 days. Mrs. Christine Smith, former local censor until that position was declared unconstitu- tional, now is a film classifier under the new ordinance. She had found the film, “Kip- ling’s Women,” objectionable. WASHINGTON— Motion picture the- atre owners who want to finance moderni- zation and expansion through Uncle Sam’s Small Business Administration will find that their local banks now support the agency’s plan. Until recently the American Banks Ass’n non-support of the plan blocked many theatre owners from getting SBA sponsored financing. The bankers have now modified their position and will support the govern- ment agency’s new program. Member banks and the SBA will share 50-50 in fi- nancing small plant modernizations, con- versions, and expansions. BOOSTS EXHIBITORS’ CREDIT The change in policy by the bankers or- ganization means a stronger flow of credit for exhibitors who want to expand or con- vert to drive-in operations: moderniza- tion programs for new projectors, seating, marquees, and theatre front facelifting will also be looked upon with a more favorable eye. Details of the program were spelled out here at a joint news conference headed by John E. Horne, administrator for the SBA, and Sam E. Fleming, Nashville banker and president of the American Banks Ass’n. The association’s 14,000 mem- ber banks were asked by Fleming to sup- port the new program as a Banks-Small Business Administi-ation “cooperative” ef- fort. Prior to recent policy changes recom- mended by the SBA’s National Small Busi- ness Advisory Council, bank cooperation was relatively limited. Edward B. Arthur, operator of a 22-theatre chain in the St. Louis area, is a member of the SBA Coimcil. This group’s recommendations strength- ened the loan program to where it is ex- pected to get the greatest stimulus in the agency’s eight years of financing small business modernizations. As reported in Boxoffice last October 30, theatres grossing less than $1 million a year are eligible for loans up to $350,000 for ten years, at interest rates ranging from 4 to 5.5 per cent. EXAMPLES CITED Let’s assume you are the owner of a ten- theatre chain and have found that modern- ization of your five “most-run-down” houses would increase your yearly box- office receipts by $15,000. A tally of your obligations shows that the increased earn- ings would easily repay the $100,000 needed for refurbishing and new equipment, in ten equal, annual payments. Banks, as a rule, favor modernization loans, because they know that one such improvement in commercial buildings will BOXOFFICE is interested in hearing “success” stories from exhibitors who have used the SBA plan for moderniza- tion of their theatres. Please send the material, including pictures if desired, to Editor, BOXOFFICE, 825 Van Brunt Blvd., Kansas City 24, Mo. bring about a contagion of improvements throughout the area. However, other prob- lems exist in making large loans. Because commercial banks carry a large percentage of demand deposits they have to maintain a high degree of liquidity and, besides this, federal regulations limit a single borrower to receiving a maximum of $50,000. Prior to the new SBA-Banker Ass’n plan, your banker would be sympathetic to your problem, but would do his best to discour- age you from taking your financial prob- lem to a government agency. Now, under the new plan, it is hoped you won’t en- counter such frustrations. Provided you meet the credit require- ments, your banker will now suggest what the SBA calls its “simplified bank partici- pation— early maturity plan.” Under this plan the bank will commit $50,000 to your needs — staying under the federal limitation — and the SBA an equal amount. Since the loan will mature in ten years, the bank will take the first five years of the ma- turity, thus enabling it to stay within its liquidity requirements. The SBA will re- ceive its repayment during the second five years. 'The SBA is hopeful that the motion pic- ture exhibitor, often in dire need of mod- ernizing his theatre, will, through the new plan, find his road to the necessary financ- ing easier. One bank official stated that it may not be quite true a “new frontier” has been reached in banking, but certainly Fleming’s description of the program’s benefits to small business will apply to in- dependent small motion picture theatres. “We think,” Fleming said, “that it will be one of the greatest moves that has hap- pened in enabling small business to mod- ernize, compete, survive, and prosper.” Exhibitors interested in the program may get details from their bankers or the near- est office of the Small Business Administra- tion. Joseph Moritz to Head AIP Exhibitor Relations LOS ANGELES — Joseph Moritz will head the new exhibitor relations department es- tablished by American International Pic- tures. Moritz is the company’s treasurer and emerges from inactive status to head the new setup. The new department will work closely with exhibitors in all areas, according to AIP heads James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff. Film Admissions Up 6% WASHINGTON— Motion picture theatre admission prices have risen by 6.2 per cent during the past year, the Department of Labor reported. A gain in film theatre ad- mission prices, due to the showing of special features, was responsible for a 0.3 per cent increase for reading and recreation in the recreation index, the Department re- ported. BOXOF7ICE :: October 1, 1962 5 YEARS AND IN ROADSHOW RELEASE 1 i IN PRODUCTION I 1 I IN PREPARATION V4^ iiJi' J Celebrating Fifth Anniversary MIRISCH PROGRAM OF 20 FILMS SET AT COST OF $65 MILLION MARKING THE BEGINNING — ^Five years ago, the newly formed Mirisch Co. was honored at a cocktail reception in New York attended by more than 200 industry members, with United Artists as the host. The Mirisch brothers — Walter, Harold and Marvin — are flanked by Arthur B. Krim, UA president, at left, and Robert S. Benjamin, chairman of the board of UA, at right. Output for 2- Year Period To Exceed That for All Of the Past 5 Years HOLLYWOOD — The Mii-isch Co., which is celebrating its fifth anniversary, has an- nounced an accelerated production pro- gram calling for filming of a minimum of 20 major motion pictures during the next two years — four more than the 16 thus far produced in the company’s five-year ex- istence. Expenditure on the new product will approximate $65,000,000. The production plan was revealed by Harold J. Mirisch, president of the inde- pendent filmmaking firm, who also evalu- ated the company’s first five years. The 16 films produced since the found- ing of the company in September 1957, in- cluding the two Academy Award winners, “The Apartment” and “West Side Story,” are expected to return a world gross of ap- proximately $105,000,000 on an investment of $34,875,000, Mirisch said. This estimate might prove conservative, he added, since it represents a projection of the eventual gross for “West Side Story,” based on only the first 200 playdates. Total gross for this picture alone now is in excess of $35,000,000. REMARKABLE SUCCESS The remarkable success of the youthful company, since its founding by Harold and his two brothers, Walter and Marvin, hes been attributed to the logic of their creed; • Find the best filmmakers. • Provide them with the best story ma- terial and most talented associates. • Give them freedom to concentrate completely on the film. • Then let a small and effective organi- zation handle all the other matters such as negotiating contracts and financing, per- suading stars to work under the Mirisch banner, arranging production logistics and supervising the merchandising of the com- pleted film on a coordinated, worldwide basis. The Mirisch brothers have carried out this logic. From the first, they focused their attention on finding the best film- makers. A little more than a year after the company began, they were associated with Billy Wilder and his production of “Some Like It Hot,” one of the most successful non-roadshow films ever distributed by United Arti.sts, grossing more than $15,000,- 000. Subsequently, the company made ar- rangements with other top filmmakers such as Fred Zinnemann, Robert Wise, Blake Edwards, J. Lee Thompson, John Franken- heimer and Anatole Litvak, turning out, among other product, two more Wilder productions, “The Apartment” and “One, Two, Three”: William Wyler’s, ‘\"The Chil- dren’s Hour”; John Sturges’ “The Magnifi- cent Seven,” and John Ford’s “The Horse Soldiers.” The company today remains small in size, but highly effective. Including the Mirisch brothers, there are approximately a dozen permanent members of the company. “We do not own the bricks and mortar of studio buildings,” Harold Mirisch ob- served, “but utilize such facilities only when we need them. Nevertheless, we feel that we are a ‘major’ studio in our thinking and our ability to translate this thinking into motion picture entertainment.” Mirisch’s list of 20 pictures now sched- uled for filming and release during the next two years, would bear out this con- clusion. They include: “Two for the Seesaw,” comedy-drama starring Robert Mitchum and Shirley Mac- Laine, produced by Walter Mirisch, di- rected by Robert Wise, from Isobel Len- nart’s adaptation of the William Gibson Broadway play, now being edited for Christmas release. “The Great Escape,” adventure-suspense, starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Richard Attenborough, being filmed on location in Germany by producer-director John Sturges from a screenplay by James Clavell and W.

And a film to be made in Hollywood by Federico Fellini, his first production in the United States. In addition to commitments with the top filmmakers. The Mirisch Co. also has non- exclusive contracts of varying lengths with topnotch performers, including Yul Bryn- ner, Horst Buchholz, George Chakiris, James Garner, Dean Martin, Shirley Mac- Laine and Pamela Tiffin. When asked the goal of the company, Walter Mirisch’s answer is, “Our com- pany’s aim is to become pre-eminent as the quahty independent filmmaker.” The record of awards given Mirisch pic- tures in the last five years indicates a good start in that direction. They include: “Some Like It Hot,” six Academy Award nominations, one award, plus awards from Writers Guild of America, the British Academy, Hollywood Foreign Press Ass’n and Chile’s Laurel de Oro award. “The Apartment,” ten Academy nomina- tions, five awards, plus awards from New York Film Critics, Writers Guild of America, Directors Guild, Producers Guild, British Academy, Venice Film Festival, Hollywood Foreign Press Ass’n and New York Foreign Press Ass’n. “The Children’s Hour,” five Academy nominations, and three Hollywood Foreign Press Ass’n nominations. “West Side Story,” 11 Academy nomina- tions, ten awards and one special award, plus a Royal Command Performance in London and awards from New York Film Critics, Directors Guild, Producers GuUd, Writers Guild of America, Hollywood For- eign Press Ass’n and New York Foreign Press Ass’n. MIRISCH CAREERS IN HORATIO ALGER TRADITION HOLLYWOOD — The New York-bom Mirisch brothers, Harold, Marvin and Walter, who head The Mirisch Co., began their motion picture industry careers at the bottom of the ladder and their climb to the top has been in true Horatio Alger tradition. Both Harold and Marvin began as office boys, Harold with Warner Bros, and Marvin with Grand National. Walter’s first film industry job was ushering at Jersey City’s State ’Theatre during a school vacation. Harold stayed with Warner Bros, for 17 years, eventually rising to become execu- tive in charge of Wisconsin theatre opera- tions during his last six years with the com- pany. He then owned and operated several theatres in the Milwaukee area in associa- tion with publisher Walter Annenberg. In 1942, Harold joined RKO in New York, remaining with that firm for five years in charge of film booking for the entire cir- cuit. He arrived in Hollywood in 1947 to join Allied Artists as assistant to president Steve Broidy and became a stockholder. Eventually, all three brothers came to- gether at Allied Artists. While Marvin worked as office boy at Grand National, he also attended evening classes at City College in New York. After graduation in 1940, Marvin continued with Grand National, rising to booker and then branch manager in the New York ex- change. He joined Harold in Milwaukee in 1940 and, with his eldest brother Irving, started Theatres Candy Co., soon to be- come one of the largest concession busi- nesses in the nation. In 1952, Marvin came to Hollywood and joined Allied Artists as assistant secretary. Walter continued to work in theatres and film exchanges while completing his schooling. In 1942, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin and later from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Ad- ministration. He joined Allied Artists in 1945 and, after providing some 25 films for the studio, became executive producer for Allied Artists in 1951, at the age of 29. Thus, in the early 1950s all three of the brothers were at Allied Artists, and the ideas that were to become the basis for the formation of The Mirisch Co., began to take form, reaching their culmination, in Sep- tember 1957, with the opening of their own independent film production firm on the Samuel Goldwyn lot.

Lee Thompson Robert Wise William Wyler Fred Zinnemann BOXOFFICE :: October 1, 1962 9 COPRODUCTION DEAL SET Para.-Embassy in Tie For 'Carpetbaggers' HOLLYWOOD — Joseph E. Levine’s Em- bassy Pictures and Paramount Pictures have finalized a deal for the production of Harold Robbins’ best-seller, “The Carpet- baggers.” Announcement of the new pro- duction association was jointly made by Barney Balaban, president of Paramount and Joseph E. Levine, at a press luncheon at Chasen’s last week. Production plans were briefly outlined by Levine, Jack Karp, Paramount vice- president and studio head, and Martin Rackin, Paramount production chief. “The Carpetbaggers” will go into pro- duction next spring at Paramount studios and will be filmed entirely in Hollywood It will be shot in 70mm super-Panavision and Technicolor. Paramount will distribute the film throughout the world. No director has been signed to date. Casting of stars for major roles and in important support- ing roles will be announced soon. John Michael Hayes is currently working on the screenplay. Hayes previously wrote the scenarios for such highly successful pic- tures as “Peyton Place,” “Butterfield 8,” “Rear Window,” and “To Catch a Thief.” “The Carpetbaggers” has sold almost five million copies in both the hard-cover edi- tion published by Simon and Schuster (Trident Press) and the paperback edition issued by Pocketbook. Levine will participate in the production of “The Carpetbaggers” and also will supervise the creation of the film’s adver- tising and promotional campaign, in as- sociation with Paramount. Author Robbins and sci-een writer Hayes flew to Hollywood from New York to at- tend the press conference. In addition to Levine, Karp and Rackin, others at the press conference representing Paramount were Y. Frank Freeman, vice-president; treas- urer James H. Richardson; Charles Boas- berg, general sales manager and vice- president of Paramount Film Distributing Corp.; Martin Davis, Paramount Pictures director of advertising. Representing Em- bassy were Leonard Lightstone, executive vice-president; Jimmy McHugh, president of the Levine-McHugh Music Co., and Harold Rand, director of publicity. Hartford Pay TV Extends Decoder Rental Waiver HARTFORD— An extension will be made of the introductory three months’ decoder rental waiver granted to Channel 18’s pio- neer pay TV subscribers here. All new sub- scribers will be included, according to Charles Wood, the Station WHCT’s general manager. So far the $10 installation charge for a subscription TV decoder is the only fee paid by new subscribers, in addition to the “admission” price for each program seen. Starting October 1, subscribers on rec- ord, as of July 1, will begin to pay a de- coder rental charge of 75 cents a week, but this will apply only after three months have elapsed. Applicants who have decoders installed now will receive the first three months’ rental free. The only charge will be for the installation and programs viewed. Tax Agents After Share Of Fight on Closed TV NEW YORK — Federal tax agents swooped down on theatres from Boston to Los Angeles ’Tuesday (25) night freezing the promoter’s interest in the receipts from the closed-circuit television showings of the Patterson-Liston fight. Internal Revenue Service men served pa- pers on establishments showing the tele- cast attaching only the promoter’s share of receipts, estimated at 55 per cent. Pro- moter of the fight was the New York firm of Graff, Reiner & Smith, Inc. The IRS notice of liens, according to one theatre- man, claimed that the promoter owed taxes amounting to $1,710,500. The promoter’s interest in the fight tele- cast was expected to be well in the mil- lions. Pre-fight forecasts estimated a $5,- 000,000 take from the match, with most of the money expected from the TV closed- circuit showings. Harold Pearson Resigns; Feted at Convention MILWAUKEE — Harold Pearson, execu- tive secretary of Allied 'Theatre Owners of Wisconsin the last 15 years, was the hon- ored guest at a dinner in the Pfister Hotel Wednesday night (Sept. 26), climaxing the opening day of the Allied convention. Pearson has resigned, effective follow- ing the convention, to enter another field of business in Menominee, Mich. Speakers at the dinner paid tribute to Pearson as a great organizer and as a staunch and tireless friend of every ex- hibitor. A successor to Pearson was to be an- nounced at a later date. Closed Circuit TV of Fight Goes Down for the Count NEW YORK — Closed circuit tele- vision apparently went down for the count along with Floyd Patterson Tuesday (Sept. 25) night when the reception of the Patterson-Liston fight in theatres across the nation was re- ported to have been from bad to nil, although satisfactory in some scattered areas. The New York telecast, overall, was far from expectations. The screen at the Fox Theatre in Brooklyn pre- sented only flickering shadows and the fight was over before the cash custom- ers had seen anything. A near riot was created and the police had to be called. Peace did not come until the manage- ment promised to return the money. Tickets for the event in the metropoli- tan area ranged from $6 to $12. The closed-circuit presentation was booked in Manhattan, Queens, Brook- lyn and parts of New Jersey. More than 250 theatres and audi- toriums across the country had booked the fight on closed circuit television. It had been estimated that the gross would be approximately $4,250,000. Indications were on Wednesday that there would be litigation in many areas and that it would be more than a week before the exact gross could be determined. Skouras Optimistic Despite Film Costs CHARLOTTE, N. C. — Spyros Skouras disclosed that the Marilyn Monroe footage of the unfinished “Something’s Got to Give” may yet be seen by the public. At a press conference here, Skouras said he could say no more than that, but added he felt some use would be made of the film to help make up the losses incurred by this production. Skouras was in Charlotte to speak at the opening luncheon of the three-day 50th anniversary convention of the Theatre Owners of North and South Carolina at the Queen Charlotte Hotel. Regarding “Cleopatra,” he said; “It has caused me more pain and anxiety than any man ever had in his life. The motion pic- ture will cost $40 million when all costs are in. It will be the most expensive picture in history, but it will also have the highest boxoffice gross in history.” He said the film was expensive, because first footage shot in England had to be scrapped and production begun anew when the crews were moved to Egypt. “We were concerned over the climate in Eng- land and did not want to take the chance. Miss Taylor nearly died of pneumonia while in London.” In spite of his predictions for the film’s boxoffice success, he said, “I would not put up with it again. Julius Caesar was assas- sinated because of Cleopatra and Mark Antony committed suicide, and I don’t know what is going to happen to me,” he said. With the two highly-talked-of films cost- ing 20th Century-Fox so much, Skouras was asked, “What is the outlook for the studio?” His answer: “I’m very high on the future of om' company.” In his speech at the luncheon Monday (Sept. 24) he defended the morality of American films. “American films are the cleanest in the world,” he said. “The films from the United States have reached the corners of the earth and have Americanized the world. Ten Poe Stories Slated By AIP in Five Years HOLLYWOOD — As a result of the box- office success enjoyed by the four Edgar Allan Poe short stories aheady filmed, American International toppers James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff have an- nounced plans to film ten more Poe thrillers over the next five years. Cui-rently in pro- duction is “The Raven,” shooting at Pro- ducers Studio under the direction of Roger Corman. Vincent Price will star in all ten, with Roger Corman assuming producer-director chores. The budget has been set in the $750,000 to $1,000,000 bracket. Filming will start April 10 on the first of the new features, which is “Masque of the Red Death,” from a screenplay by Robert Towne. This will be followed by “The Haunted Palace,” screenplay by Charles Beaumont; “Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Gold Bug,” “A Descent Into the Maelstrom,” “Ligeia,” “The Thousand and Second Tale of Scheherazade,” “The Angel of the Odd,” “City in the Sea” and “Four Beasts in One.” 10 BOXOFFICE October 1, 1962 Johnston Hails Status of Film Ad Men Iowa Allied Forming Booking Combine DES MOINES — Details of what now ap- pears may be one of the largest indei>end- ent buying and booking combines in the midwest will be spelled out at a luncheon scheduled for October 8 by Allied Inde- pendent Theatre Owners of Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota. AU independent exhibi- tors in the Des Moines exchange area are invited to the 12:30 p.m. meeting at the Standard Club in Des Moines. According to Harrison Wolcott of El- dora, secretary-treasurer of Iowa Allied, the five-man committee appointed to work out the combine plan, now has a nucleus of 34 theatres — including top drive-in and indoor houses. More exhibitors are joining each day, Wolcott said. Qualified personnel have been engaged to handle the buying and booking and a per- manent office will be opened in Des Moines October 15. Iowa Allied executives have completed financial arrangements for each exhibitor taking part in the cooperative and these will be announced at the October 8 meet- ing. Wolcott pointed out that there still is room for participation by more interested independent theatre owners. Some advantages of such a combine, as stressed by the Allied group, include elimi- nation of travel expenses and time spent in frequent trips to Des Moines film ex- changes. It is the feeling of those backing the combine that this time could better be spent in keeping up their theatres or build- ing promotion and goodwill on Main street back home. It also is their feeling that through a combine there would be film in- formation not otherwise available to the independent exhibitor. Better playdates and a more workable arrangement with film companies are other aims. There are approximately 108 exhibitors in the Des Moines area who buy and book their own films. S.O.S. Buys Full Equipment From Paramount News NEW YORK — S.O.S. PhotoCine Optics, Inc., has purchased the entire equipment inventory of the now inactive Paramount News from the parent company. Para- mount Pictures. The transaction is said to involve over $500,000 in original equipment cost. J. A. Tanney, president of S.O.S., states this acquisition now gives the company the largest supply of cameras, lenses, recording amplifiers, magazines, tripods, motors and microphones in New York City. Seven Arts Signs Freeman HOLLYWOOD — Seven Arts Productions, headed by Eliot Hyman and Ray Stark, have signed producer Everett Freeman to a multiple-picture deal, under which he will produce two films a year for the com- pany. First on Freeman’s slate is “Sunday in New York,” Norman Krasna play, scheduled to start shooting next April. Krasna has arrived here from Switzerland for conferences with the producer. And the American WASHINGTON — Motion pictiu’e adver- tising men and their work and problems were saluted by Eric Johnston, president of the Motion Picture Ass’n of America, in an address before the Advertising Club of Metropolitan Washington here on Tuesday (Sept. 25). Although the motion picture industry spends around $200,000,000 a year on ad- vertising, not as much as the “deodorant gang,” the problems which face the film ad man set him apart from his brothers in the advertising fraternity, Johnston said. “I doubt if anybody envies him,” John- ston said. “A glance at his problems is sufficient proof that he’s got one of the toughest jobs in the world.” Johnston then pointed out that the ad man in this industry had to movmt an en- tirely new campaign for a new product as often as 30 times a year, whereas a cigaret company, for example, could create a slogan which was retained for a long time. The film ad man also has to prepare ads that satisfy contractual requirements re- garding the billing of talent, dream up campaigns suitable to big cities as well as small towns and create newspaper ads that must appear alongside those of com- petitors. Johnston quoted one advertising manager of a film company as follows: “I’ve got to convince 70 million people around the world to get out of their easy chairs, turn off their ’TV sets, get dressed, go downtown, buy a ticket and see this movie.” On the whole, Johnston continued, mo- tion picture advertising deserves to rank with the best in contemporary advertising, and, he added, “I’d like to see the movie ad man appreciated more by his industry, by his fellow-advertisers and by the public.” Further discussing appreciation, John- ston said it also involved understanding the HIGH ITALIAN HONOR— Milton R. Rackmil, left, president of Universal Pictures and Decca Records, is shown receiving one of Italy’s highest honors with his being named Knight Com- mander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Dr. Tito Da Prato, consul for Italy in Los Angeles, made the presentation in Rackmil’s office. Motion Picture real place of the motion picture in today’s world. He said the American motion pic- tures were more than “just movies,” but America’s best advertisement in the world. He said he also considered it one of the most effective communicators of ideas. While the Russian film industry uses the film as a machine and an instrument of propaganda and distortion, the American film is the creation of individuals and por- trays no given set of ideas, he said. It is free to explore all the ideas conceived by free men in a free society; in short, it can show the truth, he stated. As to what American pictures were com- municating right now, Johnston quoted John Kenneth Galbraith, U.S. Ambassador to India: “It does seem to me that the American film is perhaps our most important form of cultural extension. Certainly I have found it so. It isn’t that all of our films are good, although certainly the technical standards are uniformly high. And the best are very good. ’They are also a window to the interest, variety and color of Ameri- can life. And increasingly, I think, they catch and reflect the American artistic spirit.” “The motion picture’s potential for the dissemination of ideas, its potential for the communication of beliefs, its potential for the promotion of human understanding — all are unlimited,” Johnston concluded. Rosen's Eastern Region Wins U-I Sales Drive NEW YORK — Joseph B. Rosen’s eastern region was the top cash prize wiimer in the 26-week Universal Pictures domestic Presi- dential Sales Drive, honoring Milton R. Rackmil, which concluded June 30, ac- cording to Henry H. “Hi” Martin, vice- president and general sales manager. Bar- ney Rose’s western division won second place. The top exchange was W. A. McClure’s Jacksonville branch, with W. D. Kelly’s San Francisco office placing second; Charles Hudgens’ Oklahoma City exchange, third; Harold Saltz’s New York office fourth and R. L. Carpenter’s Memphis exchange fifth. Within Rosen’s region, the New York branch was first. New Haven was second, Philadelphia was third and Boston was fourth. In the Barney Rose region, San Francisco was first, Los Angeles, second, and Portland was third. The Vancouver office of Empire-Uni- versal, which handles the distribution of Universal’s pictures in Canada, managed by Brian Rudston-Brown, took first prize among the Canadian offices, with second place going to Toronto, managed by R. W. Smith, and third by Montreal, headed by W. H. Spears. Mark Plottel is general sales manager of Empire-Universal. Col.

BOXOmCE October 1, 1962 11 Britain's Successful 'Carry On' Series Preparing to Start Its Seventh By FRANK LEYENDECKER LONDON — British producer Peter Rogers and director Gerald Thomas, who make features for Anglo-Amalgamated in Britain, little realized the gold mine they were un- covering when they made a modest-budget slapstick comedy, “CariT On, Sergeant,” in 1957. This slapstick service farce which had Bob Monkhouse, Dora Bryan, Kenneth Con- nor, Shirley Eaton, Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey, not then top names even in England, captured the fancy of the Brit- ish movie-going public to the extent that it became the third largest grossing picture there in 1958. NURSE’ IS BIG GROSSER Rogers and Thomas followed this with “Carry On, Nm'se,” which again had Con- nor, Williams, Hawtrey and Miss Eaton, in addition to Wilfrid Hyde-White and the buxom Hattie Jacques, in the leads and this became one of Britain’s “Top Ten Money- makers” in 1959. In America, “Carry On, Sergeant” was released by Governor Films to only average retmms (mostly in the art houses) in 1959 but, in 1960, “Carry On, Nurse” registered long runs in every key city in the U.S., had a lengthy run at the Little Carnegie Theatre in Manhattan and built up acclaim by laugh-minded patrons until it grossed well over $2,000,000 in the U.S. — a sensational figure for any British picture. Back in England, “Carry On, Constable,” again with Connor, Hawtrey, Miss Eaton and Miss Jacques, in addition to Leslie Phillips and Sidney James, was another big grosser in 1960 and, when it was released in the U.S. in 1962, it also started registering big grosses. The next “Can-y On” picture, another big hit in England but just now opening its first U.S. dates on the West Coast is “Carry On, Teacher,” which again featm-es Connor, Williams, Hawtrey and Miss Jacques, as well as Ted Ray, a popular British music hall comic. Also shown in England was the next, “Carry On, Regardless,” one of Bri- tain’s “Top Ten Moneymakers” of 1961, which features Connor, Williams, Hawtrey and Liz Fraser. All of these have been di- rected by Thomas, who tries to keep a stock company of farceurs together in all of the series. PLAYERS GAIN POPULARITY The sixth of the series and the first in color, largely because of its cmise ship backgrounds, is “Carry On, Cruising.” This stars Connor, Williams and Sidney James, as well as Liz Fraser and Esma Cannon, the latter a fluttery spinster type. Since the first “Carry On, Sergeant” was made five years ago, several of the regulars among the players have gone on to greater success in the acting field. Ken- neth Williams is currently starring in one of London’s biggest stage hits, “The Public Ear and ‘he Private Eye,” by Peter Shaffer of “Fiv', Finger Exercise” fame while Dora Bryan, who recently scored in the British film version of “A Taste of Honey,” is cur- rently starring on the London stage in the lead of the American musical, “Gentlemen Sidney James and Kenneth Williams in Anglo-Amalgamated’s “Carry On, Cruising,” sixth in the popular British comedies. Prefer Blondes” while Hyde-White is star- ring in the London stage hit, “Miss Pell Is Missing.” Early in 1963, Rogers will put the seventh of the series, “Carry On, Spaceman,” the first with a topical theme, into production — and the series may very well go on forever, he told this reporter in London. Rogers is a modest man who prefei’s to diversify his productions and, to that end, has recently produced “Twice Around the Daffodils,” “Peeping Tom,” “Please Turn Over,” “No Kidding” and other comedies and some dramatic films, most in association with di- rector Thomas. But British exhibitors still demand more “Carry On” pictures. 12 Recordings Are Made For 'Mutiny' Openings LOS ANGELES — Twelve recordings have been set for MGM’s Areola Production “Mutiny on the Bounty,” in connection with the fall openings as a hard-ticket road show attraction. Four of the singles feature the “Love Song from ‘Mutiny on the Bounty,’ ” re- corded by Webley Edwards with orchestra on Capitol, Hem’y Mancini and orchestra on Victor, Elmer Bernstein and orchestra on Choreo and Rene Touzet, piano, and orchestra on Crescendo. MGM Records has evolved a “package” of four albums and both London and Warner Bros, records present the “Love Song,” former with Montevani and orches- tra and latter with George Greely and orchestra. Academy Award-winner Broni- slau Kaper composed the musical score for the picture. Titles for Audubon Film NEW YORK — Robert Di Mattina has completed the English subtitles for “Pay- time,” the new French film which is being released in the U. S. by Audubon Films, ac- cording to Radley H. Motzger, president. The picture, which was written by Fran- coise Sagan, stars Jean Seberg and Chris- tian Marquand and was directed by Fran- cois Moreuil, Miss Seberg’s former husband. $17,500 in Damages Set In Infringement Suits LOS ANGELES — Judgments amounting to $17,500 have been signed in favor of six major companies in their copyright in- fringement suits against William E. Foley, doing business as Associated Pictures, by Judge Crocker in the U. S. district court here. Companies involved were Columbia, Walt Disney Productions, Paramount, United Artists, Universal and Warner Bros. Foley was charged with imauthorized sales of 35mm prints of 47 motion pictures, mostly features, released by the plaintiffs. Among them were Universal’s “The Perfect Furlough,” Disney’s “The Littlest Outlaw,” Columbia’s “Our Man in Havana,” Warner Bros. “Onionhead,” Paramount’s “Run for Cover” and United Artists’ “Bwana Devil.” The plaintiffs were granted $250 each in statutory damages for each copyright in- fringement, together with the costs of each action and the fees of the plaintiffs’ attor- neys, which the court allowed in the sum of $1,000 in each case. Following the entry of preliminary in- junctions last February, forbidding Foley to engage in any futme dealings with the films in the suit, Foley failed to appear to answer the complaints. The law firm of Freston & Files repre- sented the plaintiffs, with the New York firm of Sargoy & Stein as counsel. Seven More Installations Of Norelco Projectors NEW YORK — The motion picture equip- ment division of the North American Philips Co. will install seven new Norelco Universal 70/35 projectors, including two at drive-in theatres, according to Niels Tuxen, general manager. This makes about 140 theatres in the U.S. with Norelco 70/35 projectors. The two outdoors spots are the Thunder- bird Drive-In in Atlanta and the Cranston Auto Theatre in Cranston, R.I. The hard- tops are the Astor, Omaha; Stanley Warner Fabian Theatre, Paterson, N.J.; Skouras Route 59 Theatre, Nanuet, N.J., and the Terrace, Livonia, Mich. Another Norelco in- stallation took place at the 20th Century-Fox De Luxe labs in Hollywood. 'Flame in Streets' Booked In 19 U.S. Key Cities NEW YORK — Atlantic Pictures’ “Flame in the Streets,” cmTently playing at the Forum and the 72nd Street theatres, has also been booked in 19 other U.S. key cities, according to George Roth, president. “Flame,” a British pictm’e starring John Mills, is playing the Towne Theatre, Denver, and will play Philadelphia, starting Oc- tober 17; Pittsburgh, Stamford, Buffalo, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Boston, Syracuse, Hartford, New Haven, Worcester, Spring- field, Youngstown, Detroit, Harrisbmg, Providence and Akron, Ohio.

Predict AIP 1962 Gross To Double 1961 Total LOS ANGELES — American International Pictures’ 1962 gross has already exceeded 175 per cent of the company’s previous year’s receipts, thus assuring an end-of- the-year total double that of 1961 gross, it was announced by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff, AIP toppers. Nicholson and Arkoff, with sales chief Leon P. Blender left for Chicago to meet with exhibitors in the Windy City to dis- cuss upcoming AIP product and also to screen “Marco Polo” prior to the local opening. American International’s skyrocketing grosses have been spurred by three succes- sive smash hits. They are “Poe’s Tales of Terror,” “Panic in Year Zero!” and “Marco Polo.” Bobby Darin Tours Keys For Tf a Man Answers' NEW YORK — Bobby Darin, who is co- starred with his wife, Sandi'a Dee, in Uni- versal’s “If a Man Answers,” will make a seven-city tour to promote the November release, starting in New York October 2.

Fabian in Public Service Film HOLLYWOOD — Fabian will film a five- minute public service picture appealing to students to remain in school. This is part of the national campaign to discour- age teenagers from dropping out of school. The film will be made available to high schools through the New York Public School Systems. BETWEEN THE LINES = By AL STEEN The New Jersey Suit ^HERE IS A certain amount of irony in the legal action brought by the Maple- wood Theatre, Maplewood, N.J., to force earlier availability of product for theatres in northern New Jersey. The case was filed about a year ago by the Maplewood on be- half of member theatres of Allied Theatre Owners of New Jersey in the area. Three years ago. New Jersey Allied had proposed that the theatres in the region be given day-and-date availability and book- ings with New York theatres. According to a New Jersey Allied spokesman, the dis- tributors “laughed at us and said we were crazy.” Now, a spokesman pointed out to us the other day, what the exhibitor had asked for is exactly what is taking place with the Premiere Showcase plan and other multiple booking formulas now in operation. Incidentally, the New Jersey litigation is now going through the depositions process and may go to trial next spring. 70mm Progress ^HE ADVERTISEMENT by North Ameri- can Philips Co. for its Norelco 70/35 projector in the September 3 issue of Box- office was somewhat of an eye-opener as to the future of 70mm pictures. The ad listed the titles of 20 pictures which already had been released in 70mm and then listed 59 other pictures in wide film which were either shooting or an- nounced for future production. Doubtless, the ad was prepared before certain changes had been made; for example, ‘\"The Greatest StoiT Ever Told” now is destined for Cine- rama. And there were a few others for which a definite process still was in abeyance. But for the sake of argument, suppose that nine of the 59 listed did not go the 70mm route. That would leave 50 pictures which will need projectors that will accom- modate 70mm. It is probable that few in the industry were aware of the strides and progress be- ing made in this medium. A year ago, only a handful of pictures had been earmarked for 70mm and there was a great deal of skepticism as to whether they would de- velop into reality. It now looks as if 70mm production is creeping in slowly but surely and that the switch to compatible projectors will be the rule. The widefilm and widescreen actually are a reoccurrence rather than an innova- tion of the last decade. The medium almost caught on in 1929 and 1930, when a few theatres installed them. Paramount had a process known as Magnascope. Fox Film had introduced Grandeur, while RKO was experimenting with what was known as the Spoor-Berggren method. It was reported at the time that Warner Bros, had a wide- screen system which it would unveil when it was perfected. The Warner method, what- ever it was, probably is still in moth balls. Besides, the Warner boys were too busy at the time with their new gold mine known as Vitaphone to give too much heed to any- thing else. The time, too, was not appropriate. Ex- hibitors were going through the birth pains of converting from silent to sound pictures, as well as adjusting acoustics to drown out the echoes from the screen. To have to in- stall widescreens after having to buy porous screens would have been too much of a load to carry. Nevertheless, the interest in the wide- film-screen medium was great early in 1930 and there were predictions that it would be the major development of that year. Not until more than 20 years later did the big screen come into its own, ushered in first by Cinerama and then by Cinemascope for the average theatre. • TV Season Is Here F SOME exhibitors have been coasting along during the summer without worrying much about television competition because the shows mainly were repeats, they had better start applying some showman- ship to offset what looks like a strong TV season. The new video season has started and each of the networks is offering some potent properties for the stay-at-homes. From Monday through Saturday, there are some mighty strong programs scheduled — some new and some continued standbys — and there appears to be greater cut-throat competition among the webs to outdo each other to attract and retain the viewers. At least, the scheduled programs look good on paper. Whether they measure up to expectations is another matter. But the house-slipper entertainment-seekers are going to remain in their house slippers im- less the motion picture theatres can con- vince them that there is better entertain- ment on the big screen. Television stations and the networks do not stint in their newspaper advertising of their attractions. The ads hit you in the eye with a powerful punch, whereas some- times it takes a magnifying glass to find where a particular pictm-e is playing in a particular theatre. Some film distributors have told us that they were getting “fed up” with the lack of cooperation by theatres in sharing promo- tion costs and that there was going to have to be a change. The hue and cry for greater showmanship is old hat. If the fall and winter TV shows stack up to promises, some exhibitors will have to go bare-headed, whether they like it or not. BOXOFFICE :: October 1, 1962 13 LETTERS Another View of Films on TV Read with interest Gray Barker’s letter in the September 17, 1962, issue of Box- office. “There is some tendency by dis- tributors to sell off the unsuccessful (the- atrically) pictures and to withhold the successful films for possible reissue . . Evidently Mr. Barker wrote that letter before Seven Art’s two-page spread in Variety announcing the following films were available as a package for TV sta- tions: “Auntie Marne,” “Sayonora,” “The Pajama Game,” “The Silver Chalice,” “The Old Man of the Sea,” “Helen of Troy” and others. Numerous persons outside the industry have asked me why Hollywood is “selling out?” These people also asked me if all the studios were going to close as had 20th Century-Fox. This took nearly two hours of explaining. Gentlemen, look at it this way. Which age group makes up the greater percentage of the motion picture audience today? Various surveys indicate that teenagers and young adults make up the greater percent- age. These people will probably “go to the movies,” regardless of what is on TV. But, are you satisfied with just this audience? The 30 years-and-over age group makes up a very large portion of our population and are the ones that will sit in front of those TV sets and watch “Sayonora,” rather than go out to the local theatre to see the same film. TOA has been praising Warner Bros, for its early availability of “What Ever Hap- pened to Baby Jane?” Are we going to ignore the fact that this studio is one of those selling the newest films to TV? Has anyone asked the studio why the sellout? Is this vast movie, ’TV, and music empire in such financial stress that the sellout is warranted? Have they tried making their film library available to theatres or have they decided against it, because of a few reissue failures? I believe some answers are in order. How about you? JAMES A. MANUEL 2614 Madison Street Hollywood, Florida 'Good Bet' That Was Undersold I have been one of your subscribers for almost two years and I thoroughly enjoy your magazine and the effort that you make to promote better relations between the ex- hibitors and the distributors and help in every way that you can to improve business in general for the industry. (Was formerly in theatre business.) I am, more or less, one of these people that you refer to as being “lost audience” for a variety of reasons most of which you, yourself, have brought out at one time or another. La-st night I went to a little movie the- atre downtown here in San Francisco called the Powell Theatre. It is a sort of last-run theatre playing pictures for a 50 cent ad- mission charge that have usually been shown everywhere else in town already. At (Letters must be signed. Names withheld on request) this showing, they were playing a Para- mount import called “Forever My Love.” This was practically a first-nm engage- ment as prior to this time “Forever” has played at only one art house in one of the outlying areas of town and then only for a very short run. The theatre was packed solid for both performances that evening and audiences sat there literally spellbound. You could tell by the expressions on their faces that they were amazed because this pictiu-e pro- vides just the entertainment that your theatre owner clients and the public at large have been begging for all these last few months. In this picture is the most lavish and breathtaking European scenery photographed in beautiful shades of Tech- nicolor which reminds one of Cinerama. There is music and dancing that is very en- tertaining, fine acting and a good, clean story line that enthralls adults and is en- tertaining to children also. This is one picture that all of your small- town and second-run big city theatres should get behind and, if necessary, pro- mote it with a money-back guarantee. There will be very few refunds asked for. It seems a shame that Paramount hasn’t bothered to get behind this picture and pro- mote it. If I hadn’t seen the promotional material in Boxoffice prior to the releasing date of the picture, I wouldn’t have known enough about it to go and see it myself. This picture has been dubbed in Eng- lish and, while the dubbing is not always evenly matched with the facial expressions, the picture is so unusual that the imper- fection in the dubbing is scarcely noticed. DAN JAY San Francisco, Calif. Another 'Family Picture' Definition It’s too bad Mr. Webster is not still with us to furnish us with a proper definition of what a family motion picture is. For moviegoers who live in a small college town, such as it is my privilege, I think a family picture is one that nowadays, pos- sibly, would keep a good many people away from the boxoffice, just as it will attract a great many to it. It is certainly one that will build, not destroy, future patronage for a theatre and it is one that will promote goodwill and furnish a theatre with good- will ingredients that is almost as vital to today’s theatre operation as good pictures. It is one that wiU stimulate a desire for a theatre manager or owner to get off his “fanny” and mingle with his patrons and get a thrill from seeing the real backbone patronage of this business — the family trade — enter his theatre, as well as listen to and swell up with pride at their favor- able comments. Certainly, the family picture that will attract children, will relieve parents from hiring baby sitters and vice versa, relieve baby sitters from such jobs.

Stembler, president of Theatre Owners of America.

By AL STEEN ^HE DAVID MERRICK-Leland Hayward stage success has been brought to the screen by Mervyn LeRoy almost intact with, of course, greater sweep and backgrounds which only the screen can produce. “Gypsy” is a glittering saga of show business as it was in the 1920s and 1930s and is based on the career of Gypsy Rose Lee, the most renowned of burlesque stripteasers. How- ever, it is her mother, played by Rosalind Russell, who holds the spotlight and is the center of attraction through most of the footage, although Natalie Wood, as Gypsy, slowly works her way into the top spot when, quite by accident, according to the screenplay, she substitutes for a “peeler” when the latter is arrested for shoplifting in Wichita and can’t make her appearance. Foiirteen songs, the entire score of the stage version, are utilized in the film and each is given a colorful and rousing pro- duction support. Comedy is plentiful, with a touch of pathos here and there. Karl Malden is the third star in the cast in the role of Herbie, the long-suffering suitor for Miss Russell’s hand and shows a surprising talent for comedy, and even a bit of hoofing with Miss Russell and Miss Wood. One of the big scenes in the stage play, that of the cavorting of three strip- teasers backstage, has been reenacted prac- tically in its entirety and is one of the big comic moments of the pictm’e. The same performers were cast in the screen version; Betty Bruce, Faith Dane and Roxanne Ar- len. Another from the stage, Paul Wallace, repeats his sensational dance number, “All I Need Is the Girl.” Produced in Technicolor and Techni- rama, the musical score is by Jule Styne, with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, who did Warner Bros.

Its boxoffice potential is unlimited, at least for those who like musicals. And they are in the majority. Warner Bros, followed its smash hit, “The Music Man,” with “Gypsy,” giving it two top musicals in a row. Whether “Gypsy” measures up to “The Music Man,” is a matter of opinion, al- though the latter may have a slight edge, without taking anything away from “Gypsy.” Miss Russell is outstanding as the dom- ineering stage mother whose ambition is to make stars of her two daughters. Miss Wood and Ann Jilliann. She takes every advantage to clown, display sorrow, dance, sing and exhibit her talents. Miss Wood, as the somber and even shy Gypsy until given a chance to let herself go, is outstanding. Jack Benny, as a second-rate comedian in a second-rate theatre, does a guest bit that arouses considerable laughter. The story is that of an ambitious stage mother. Miss Russell, who drags her two children through the agonies of trying to get them established in show business, play- ing the tank towns and the bigger towns. It is her daughter, Jime, who appears to make the greater progress, but she goes off on her own, leaving only Louise (Gypsy) to be guided by her mother. When her troupe is booked into a combination pic- ture and vaudeville theatre in Wichita, Gypsy volunteers to replace a stripteaser when the latter can’t appear. She offers a new type of graceful stripping that wins applause and, against the will of her mo- ther, goes on to become the queen of Minsky burlesque. The only adverse comment on the film might be its length. Although at no time does it drag, the two hours and a half of running time could be cut in a few spots. Mervyn LeRoy directed from Leonard Spigelgass’ screenplay which was based on the book by Arthur Laurents. Distributor Conference Set In Madrid by Bronston LOS ANGELES — Samuel Bronston has arranged for an on-the-spot distributor conference on October 23-24 at the Madrid locations of “55 Days at Peking.” The pro- ducer is calling the group to a “see for yourself” conference. Some 50 representatives of 11 companies distributing pictures will be invited, with Bronston, executive vice-president Paul Lazarus jr., Ralph Wheelwright and Milton Goldstein heading the sessions.

Usually the clear and frank statement of the chairman’s report, in the past, has rarely produced any new or startling ob- servations by Davis, when quizzed by the British and American representatives of the tradepress. This year, it was different. Af- ter answering a few minor points of clari- fication about the report, Davis turned to his interrogators and delivered some in- dividual remarks about the controversial matter of the “Third Release” — sometimes called the “National Circuit.” It will be recalled that the five trade as- sociations had conducted a survey to find out how the product position was facing exhibitors over here with a general aim of trying to aid the position of both theatre owners and producers who were not able to show or get their films released on the ABC or the Rank circuit. Davis produced new statistics to show that, while 135 the- atres in the country were covered by the third release, 45 of them belonged to Rank and ten to ABC, leaving only 80 cinemas obligated to take Third Release, owing to barring conditions or other reasons. More- over, there were 153 cinemas which could play the Third Release or Rank pictures, 131 which could play the Third Release or ABC, and a further 1,212 cinemas which could play 'Third Release, ABC or Rank. “That is the reason why there were so few replies to the exhibitors’ circular,” said Davis. “These figures reveal that the agita- tion of the Third Release is the work of a handful of agitators, while the mass of ex- hibitors could not care less.” Thus, as far as the Rank Organization is concerned, the third circuit is dead, and chairman Davis and his newly appointed managing direc- tor, Kenneth Winckles, will shortly merge some of the 45 Third Release theatres into the Rank release pattern, close a few others, allow a few more to go in for long- playing engagements and generally stream- line the position accordingly. In his last report to shareholders as chairman of the Rank Organization, Lord Rank (who now becomes president) stated that it was expected that there would be further shrinkage in theatre attendance during the coming year and this might lead to some reduction in profits, although in similar circumstances the group main- tained profits from exhibition in the U. K. during 1961-62. As previously reported, the Rank Or- ganization in a 53-week period made a trading profit of £8,391,810 in 1961-62, com- pared with £8,118,805 in the previous 52 weeks. Film earnings overseas continued at a high level, being no less than 41 per cent of total earnings. Lord Rank pointed out that, in spite of political and economic problems in Central and South America, the Group held to its position and con- tinued to receive substantial remittances from these countries. On film production. Lord Rank declared that the biggest problem was the continu- ous and alarming rise in costs, particularly of artists and creative talent, largely brought about by scarcity. All producers were competing for the limited supply available. At the moment, he saw no signs of this situation easing. Faced with the shortage of Hollywood product. Lord Rank had a word to say about coproduction with Europe and stated, “The problems of co- production with the three most important film producing countries in the Common Market, France, Italy and Germany, have not been resolved, although some progress had been made.” In this connection, John Davis noted at his press conference that, while last year Hollywood had"
