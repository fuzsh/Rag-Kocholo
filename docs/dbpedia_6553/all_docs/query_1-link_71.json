        "text": "Brash, bold, and wickedly funny, are three words that describe Guy Ritchie’s films and he's following suit with Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, his new action-spy-thriller, another globe-trotting adventure of spies, out to save the world through their own unconventional tactics.\n\nOrson Fortune (Jason Statham) must track down and stop the sale of a deadly new weapons technology wielded by billionaire arms broker Greg Simmonds (Hugh Grant). Reluctantly teamed with some of the world’s best operatives (Aubrey Plaza, Cary Elwes, Bugzy Malone), Fortune and his crew recruit Hollywood’s biggest movie star Danny Francesco (Josh Hartnett) as bait on their globe-trotting, undercover mission to save the world.\n\nOperation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre follows the long line of Ritchie’s filmmaking legacy of comedy action thrillers that include Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch, RocknRolla, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and most recently, The Gentlemen."
