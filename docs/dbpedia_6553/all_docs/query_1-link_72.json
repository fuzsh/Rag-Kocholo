The target of this scheme is a true Steel Monster – the one-of-a-kind “Nomad” tank that features an exciting, custom-designed exterior inspired by the film.\n\nWorld of Tanks PC players will enjoy the BATTLE PASS SPECIAL: SNATCH THE DIAMOND, which presents a set of objectives to complete. As tankers work through the 14 days of challenges, they can get special Snatch-inspired content in their garage. This includes five notorious tank commanders, a collection of memorable customization items like 2D styles, decals, inscriptions, a medal, and, of course, the ultimate target: a custom “Nomad” tank.\n\nOn top of that, until February 15th, Prime Gaming members can claim a special package featuring “That Dog” as a crew skin, thematic decals, a special medal, and much more."
