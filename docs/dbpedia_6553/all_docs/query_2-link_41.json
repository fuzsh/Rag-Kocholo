        "text": "E2 Visa Requirements for Investors\n\nThe E2 visa, also sometimes called an investor visa, startup visa or entrepreneur visa, can be one of the most flexible visas in the non immigrant visa category offered to those who are interested in starting a business in the US.\n\nThe average wait time for a visa is several weeks, many visas are good for 2-5 years, and many visas allow for frequent international travel.\n\nSo, what are the requirements for an E2 treaty investor visa? We’re glad you asked. (For information regarding an E2 investment enterprise or E2 visa for employees, please check out these more specific articles.)\n\n1. Qualifying Treaty or Equivalent for an E2 Visa\n\nIn order to be eligible for the E2 visa, the principal investor is required to be a national of a treaty country. This means that treaty investors must have a legal, valid passport from one of the countries with which the United States has an agreement. You don’t need to have your permanent residence in that country. You may have additional passports and another foreign residence. You may have received your passport two weeks ago.\n\nYou may have been born in a non-treaty country. Your spouse and kids may have passports from non-treaty countries. Rest assured that none of this matters when it comes to meeting this particular visa requirement. If you have a legally-issued, valid passport from a treaty country, consider this requirement met!\n\nThe main question is about the passport you currently have. Since the agreements with all treaty countries are different, the visas are different as well. Each visa will allow entry to the US, and each visa allows you, as an E2 visa investor, to enter the US with permission to live and work in the US. However, the length of visa validity and the number of times you can come and go from the US varies considerably.\n\nCountries such as Canada, UK, France, Pakistan, and others allow for the most flexibility. Those visas are typically good for five years and allow unlimited trips into and out of the US. On the other end of visa flexibility are countries like Egypt and Jordan, which allow for only one entry within three months of issuance. To check on the visa flexibility for your country, see Department of State “Visa Reciprocity” page.\n\nExceptions for E2 Visas\n\nThere are some exceptions and things to look out for when figuring out if you meet this E2 visa requirement.\n\nAre you from the UK? And by UK, I mean the British Isles (except Ireland, which is a treaty country, but under a different treaty), the Channel Islands, and Gibraltar. If you have a UK passport but don’t reside in the British Isles, the Channel Islands, or Gibraltar, you likely won’t qualify as a UK national unless you live in the British Isles.\n\nThe great news? You don’t have to live there for long. However, you will have to provide a lease/mortgage or other residential proof that at the time of the visa application you were living on the British Isles.\n\nAre you from Svalbard or Greenland? You may have a problem here, as well. Although Norway and Denmark are both treaty countries, the treaty doesn’t extend to Svalbard or Greenland.\n\nAre you from Bolivia or Ecuador and currently have no E2 visa? Unfortunately, they are not issuing any new E2 visas.\n\nAre you from New Zealand? Good news! A treaty between the US and New Zealand has been established.\n\nAre you from Israel? Our sources say that you will soon be able to apply for an E2 visa! This one has been in the works for some time and is supposed to open up officially very soon.\n\n2: Nationality\n\nThe next E2 treaty investor visa requirement is that of nationality. Since you have already met the treaty requirement, it seems like nationality should be a slam dunk, right? The truth is that this requirement has to do with the nationality of the business, not the nationality of the principal applicant. That said, in many cases, the two are one and the same. Let’s look at a couple of examples.\n\nE2 Visas Where the Individual is 100% Owner of the Business\n\nBetsy the barber is from Mexico. She has always dreamed of opening a barber shop in Hastings, Nebraska. It seems like a heavenly place. She decides that she would like to be the sole owner of this business. She files a Nebraska LLC for Betsy’s Bigfoot Barber, LLC and is the sole member of that LLC. When she applies (through her lawyer, of course) for the E2 visa, the nationality requirement is easily met with one copy of her Mexico passport. The company, Betsy’s Bigfoot Barber, LLC, is 100% owned by a Mexico national. Betsy’s Mexico passport proves not only her nationality, but also the nationality of the company. The nationality requirement is met.\n\nThe E2 Visa Requires that the Individual is the Majority Owner of the Business\n\nLet’s take a quick look at Betsy again. This time, she decides that having a US citizen business partner will help grow the business faster. She talks with her cousin, Steve, who was born in Nebraska and knows many of the high rollers in Hastings. Steve agrees to go into business with Betsy as a 40 percent partner. Great! This partnership still easily shows Mexico nationality and control. No problems here.\n\nWhat if Steve and Betsy decide to go into business 50/50? This should also work, but there may be a little more explanation needed regarding Betsy’s duties and control over the business. (We’ll discuss this later in this same article under the “Direct and Develop” portion).\n\nThe E2 Visa Requirements for an Individual Owner of Dual Nationality\n\nAre you a dual national? In many cases, that is no problem. However, please keep in mind which passport you are using to come to the US (particularly in the case of E2 change of status). If you have two passports, you should only enter the US with the passport you’re going to rely upon for the E2 visa. If you don’t, and you eventually decide that you would like to change status to E2 visa investor, you will have a problem. Furthermore, if you are granted the E2 visa with one nationality and you later enter the US using a different passport, you could run into unauthorized work issues. Let’s take a look at a couple of examples:\n\nBobby the baker owns 100% of his business, Bobby’s Buns, LLC. He has two passports: one from Russia and one from Canada. Russia is a non-treaty country, while Canada is a treaty country. Bobby enters the US with the Russia passport containing a B1/B2 visa. He is admitted for 180 days. During this time, he decides he wants to open a bakery in Minot, North Dakota, and starts getting his business together. He obtains a lease for his baking space, and he buys both a truck and equipment.\n\nAbout five months after he enters the US, he decides that he wants to change status through USCIS instead of going to Toronto to apply for a visa through the Department of State. He contacts Rupert Law Group to help. The answer? No can do. He is here as a Russian national, a non-treaty country, which means he doesn’t meet this E2 visa requirement. He would need to leave the US and apply as a Canadian through the Department of State in Toronto.\n\nLet’s take another look at Bobby. He has the same business and the same passports. However, this time he leaves the US and gets an E2 visa in Toronto through the Department of State. He enters the US using both his Canadian passport and E2 visa and gets to work. About six months later, he decides to visit his cousins in St. Petersburg. He leaves the US and enjoys a couple of weeks of even more snow than what is found in North Dakota.\n\nWhen Bobby returns to the US, he uses his Russian passport. He is admitted with his B1/B2 visa. Oh no! As a holder of a B1/B2 visa, he will be ineligible to work. If he works after being admitted with a B1/B2 visa, he may have problems down the road since he will be considered to be working without authorization. So, what should Bobby do? Leave again and come back with the Canadian passport.\n\nWhat if you are a dual national of two treaty countries? In this case, you may be able to choose which passport you use. Some things to consider and discuss with your visa attorney are the following:\n\nWhich E2 visa is more flexible? If you are a dual national of Pakistan and Egypt, for example, you may want to pick Pakistan. It has a much longer and much more flexible visa than the visa for Egyptian nationals.\n\nWhere do you spend the most time? This may be at least a consideration for you. If you possess passports for both France and Italy, and you live full-time in Italy, the choice is easy. The flexibility is the same, and so Italy is the most convenient choice. But what if you are a passport holder of Australia and Canada, and you live full-time in Australia? You may still consider using the Canada passport because it’s more flexible (Canada offers a visa for five years instead of Australia’s four-year visa). But then again, it may not be worth acquiring the extra year of visa if you can show ties to Australia and you have virtually no ties to Canada—except for a passport. There is no right answer here, it will completely depend on you and your visa attorneys’ decision.\n\nDo you have employees you’d like to eventually bring to the US? If so, the passport you choose will be crucial. The employee will have to have the same national passport as you in order to be employed in the US as an E2 visa\n\nemployee.\n\nE2 Visa Requirements for Multiple Owners of Different Nationalities\n\nThere is always the option of opening a business with a partner from another country. To make this portion easier to follow, we will lay out another example.\n\nDave and Diane are long-time friends. Dave has a France passport, while Diane has a Chile passport. They met at a Finnish vocational school while studying “Cleaning and Property Services.” After school, they parted ways – Dave returned to France and Diane returned to Chile – but they always kept in touch via email and Facebook. Upon reading news of Diane’s finalized divorce on Facebook one day, Dave saw his chance. He got on WhatsApp and called Diane immediately. The two decided they were ready for a new adventure: opening a property management business in Jackson, Mississippi. The two pooled some money together and initiated their new venture, Dave and Diane’s Dusters, Inc.\n\nHow will this work though? Dave and Diane are each from different countries! In this narrow area of 50/50 ownership and control, this partnership can work. The company is considered a dual nationality, of sorts. If Dave and Diane wish to hire one person from Chile and one person from France as E2 employees, they may do so.\n\nE2 Visa Requirements for a Fifty Percent Ownership\n\nIn almost all cases, the E2 visa investor needs to show that he/she owns a minimum of 50% of the business. So, in what scenario may the investor own less than 50% of the business and still meet the national requirement?\n\nIf you are an individual investor, you must only show that you control (or will control) the business. An easy way (and the most typical way), is to show you own 50% or more of the business. (E2 visa tip: If you’re going for ease, and your partner is flexible, own 51% of the business. It eliminates all confusion and additional explanation). However, you can also demonstrate control by “possession of operational control.”\n\nIn other words, you must explain your job duties in exquisite detail and emphasize the controlling nature of your duties. Maybe you are the CEO and will be the sole partner in charge of the business. The others are simply silent partners who will have no say over the running or direction of the business. This could work. Note that the title alone means nothing. You really need to show the job duties and be as detailed as possible in your report.\n\nE2 Visa Requirement: Intent to Depart Upon Termination of Status\n\nYou must intend to depart the US at the end of your authorization. That’s pretty simple to understand, and both USCIS and the Department of State take this E2 visa requirement very seriously. In fact, not meeting this requirement is one of the more frequent denials for the E2 visa.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is an easy requirement for a treaty investor to meet. In most cases, you simply have to tell the officer that you intend to leave the US when your authorization expires. Some consulates require a signed letter stating the same. You typically do not need to show anything else. In fact, the regulations state that you can sell your house and all your possessions in your home country and still meet this requirement. So where is the “sticky” area for the E2 visa investor when it comes to the intent requirement?\n\nImmigrant Petition Pending for an E2 Visa\n\nThe regulation language is clear that you must intend to depart the US when you no longer have E2 status. So, what if you have an immigrant petition pending? (An immigrant petition is a document that, if approved, may eventually lead to a US green card.) For the most part, you need to assure the consulate officer during the visa interview that you have no intent of staying beyond your authorization time for your E2 visa to apply for lawful nonimmigrant status. You must also assure them that you intend to come back to the Department of State for a visa interview instead of adjusting status through USCIS.\n\nThere are several instances when you may have an immigrant petition pending.\n\nDiversity Lottery: They may know that you have applied for this even if you haven’t been chosen. This shouldn’t be an issue as long as you are honest, and as long as you can convince the officer that even if you are chosen in the lottery, you will not attempt to adjust status without leaving the United States.\n\nFamily Petition: Your parent or sibling submitted an I-130 to petition you. This could be an incredibly lengthy wait. In some instances, the process takes 25 years; and in most instances it takes at least a decade. So, this is a common situation. Again, please be honest when discussing this petition; and be sure to speak with your visa attorney about how to approach this during the visa interview.\n\nChild Petition: US citizen child petitions parent. If your child is a US citizen and is 21 years old or older, and they want to petition you for a green card, just wait. These petitions go through rather quickly (usually a year or so), and it will be here before you know it.\n\nWork Petition: This one could be a bit tricky, considering that in order to get this petition, a company is petitioning you to work for them. As a result, there will likely be a lot of questions at the visa interview about your true intent of where you will be working and how you are going to make a successful business when you will likely be taking another job in 1-2 years. Best to consider your options if you have an\n\nI-140 pending.\n\nInvestor Green Card: If you are from China, Vietnam, or even India, you know how long the process may take to get the investment green card. In some instances, investors determine that they will apply for the E2 first, add investment, and then apply for the EB-5 visa (investor green card). Note that in the case of a Chinese, Vietnamese, or Indian national, you will likely have to renew the E2 before your number becomes current for the EB-5. (And yes, I realize that none of these countries are treaty countries. It may be possible to get a second citizenship that is E2 eligible, like Grenada for instance).\n\nE2 Visa Applicants Must Have Invested or Be in the Process of Investing\n\nAnd now, the information you have all been waiting for… the investment portion! This is probably the area with the most frequently asked questions. Since this topic is so loaded with information, I like to break this section up into three parts: the source of funds, the investment capital itself, and the substantiality of the investment funds.\n\nTo address the “elephant in the room” up front – there is no minimum investment amount. That said, don’t celebrate too early: there has to be a significant economic contribution and the business has to make commercial sense. There is also no such thing as an approved $25,000 investment for a marginal enterprise. We will cover this shortly. Now onto the more nuanced portion of investment.\n\nSource of Funds for an E2 Visa\n\nIn other words, “Where did you get the money you have invested?” And after you answer that question, you need to show that the money is at risk or that you have possession/control of the money. Easy as pie, right? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nWhere’d You Get the Cash for the E2 Visa?\n\nThe great news is that almost every legal way to get money is OK. You can inherit, win the lottery, use personal savings, receive a divorce settlement, receive a monetary gift, sell your personal items or real estate property, or even get a secure signature loan. Almost everything is on the table … except a couple of small things. What is it with the law? There are always exceptions!\n\nThe Money Must Be at Risk for an E2 Visa\n\nOnce you show where you get the cash, you need to show that the money is at risk. In the government’s words, “If the funds are not subject to partial or total loss if business fortunes reverse, then it is not an ‘investment.’”\n\nE2 Visa Funding Risk: Inheriting the Business\n\nYou can’t get an E2 visa with a business you inherited. Sorry, can’t do it. So, what are you supposed to do if you inherit a business in the US and you can’t work in it? You may have a couple of options – sell it and use the proceeds to start a different business. You could get an E2 visa on a new business. Or, you simply let the current employees run the day-to-day and you are simply a silent, foreign investor. You could never work in the business, but you could own a business in the US without a visa. (Tip: never do this without speaking with a visa attorney first. On the surface,\n\nit seems simple enough; but you need to have a visa attorney review the intricacies of your specific situation before you can know for sure that you aren’t causing future immigration trouble for yourself.)\n\nE2 Visa Funding Risk: Loan Based On the Business\n\nAgain, this is a no-go. The reason? The point of the E2 visa is “inherent risk.” If you are using the business itself as collateral for a loan, the inherent risk is gone. Translation – you don’t have enough skin in the game. And, another warning – please note that if you get a loan based on the business assets and some personal assets, the loan can’t be used to show investment!\n\nSo now it’s everyone’s favorite time – examples of how this requirement may play out."
