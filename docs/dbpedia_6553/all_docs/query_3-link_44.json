        "text": "Introduction\n\nBoris \"The Blade\" Yurinov is an Ex-KGB agent, who is introduced as the person who sold Tommy the gun he has in his trousers in the opening scene. He later provides Franky \"Four-Fingers\" with a gun free of charge in return for Franky placing a bet for him at Brick Top's bookies. He then engages Vinny, Sol and Tyrone to rob the bookies and steal the briefcase containing a priceless diamond which is attached to Frankie's wrist. The robbery does not go to plan, but Franky is captured and taken to Vinny and Sol's shop.\n\nDuring an argument about what Boris will give them, as there was not much cash at the bookies and they now know about the diamond in the case, Vinny says Boris's name loudly enough for the blindfolded Frankie to hear. Boris then shoots Frankie in the head, but not before Vinny returns the diamond to the briefcase. As no one knows the combination to the briefcase, Boris calmly hacks off Franky's hand with a huge cleaver he has in in a holster on his belt before ordering the others to dispose of the body.\n\nLater he is confronted by Avi's henchman and brutally beaten and taken hostage, but he escapes when the car crashes, only to be run over by the car Sol, Vinny and Tyrone are driving. He survives and goes to his house, retrieving a military-grade assault rifle to enact revenge on those who've wronged him. Boris is a master at being \"killed' and once he has his eyes set on what he wants no-one and nothing can stop him.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn his youth, Boris operated as an KGB operative. Very little is known about his past and therefore very little will be put into determining his past. Other characters called him \"uzbekistanian\", however, his typically Russian name and surname, combined with Slavic appearance and accent, suggest he's ethnic Russian, not Uzbek. He is probably a citizen of Uzbekistan of Russian origin.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBoris is displayed as cold, calculating, determined, focused, diligent, secretive, and highly violent and intelligent individual who has no problem with cutting limbs off dead individuals to simply take what he wants and because of the reason he wants. He is ultimately motivated by greed and is willing to hurt people who gets in his way without a second thought and for those who try to undermine is malicious capabilities often find out first hand his absolute disregard and apathy towards the suffering of others that is inflicted upon them by others or by himself. His ex-KGB implicates that he is knowledgeable in intelligence gathering and the technological devices utilized to get it, espionage tactics and how to apply them and in general usage of them, \"chameleon-like' capability to create a false identity right on the spot and able to work around governmental intricacies to get his identity. He is ruthless in his conviction and desire to complete what he has his mind set on would result in falling into obvious traps, overlooking details due to his diligency, and his obsession with getting revenge on Avi and Tony would eventually lead to him being blinded by his rage and possibly \"killed' by Bullet-Tooth Tony in a bar's hallway.\n\nHe has no qualms about the necessities of using people to get what he wants and displays this trait when he shot Franky in the head and proceeded to threaten the trio to not follow him, and that if they do he will kill them. His primary downfall would be to either to disregard the severity of the scenarios that follow him, often treating as mere consequence, and fails to recognize that killing Franky was the main reason as to why Avi and Toni became involved in the first place, while also being prone to impulses, an example is where he killed Franky as an intimidation attempt when Franky was the only person who knew the code.\n\nAbilities[]"
