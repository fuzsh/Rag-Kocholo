        "text": "January 11th, 2024 – Wargaming is thrilled to present exclusive content inspired by the crime-comedy Snatch, available both in World of Tanks PC and World of Tanks Blitz. Tankers will become a part of an elaborate caper alongside five of Snatch’s most colorful characters – Franky Four-Fingers, Bullet-Tooth Tony, Tommy, Turkish and Boris the Blade. The target of this scheme is a true Steel Monster – the one-of-a-kind “Nomad” tank that features an exciting, custom-designed exterior inspired by the film.\n\nWorld of Tanks PC players will enjoy the BATTLE PASS SPECIAL: SNATCH THE DIAMOND, which presents a set of objectives to complete. As tankers work through the 14 days of challenges, they can get special Snatch-inspired content in their garage. This includes five notorious tank commanders, a collection of memorable customization items like 2D styles, decals, inscriptions, a medal, and, of course, the ultimate target: a custom “Nomad” tank.\n\nOn top of that, until February 15th, Prime Gaming members can claim a special package featuring “That Dog” as a crew skin, thematic decals, a special medal, and much more.\n\nWorld of Tanks Blitz also rolls into the criminal underworld with the special Battle Pass Operation Snatch. Running until January 31st, it offers players unique rewards, from a custom Caravan skin for the Charioteer tank, five movie character-inspired avatars to four tank camos based on Snatch’s gang of bruisers: Franky-Four Fingers, Boris the Blade, Turkish & Tommy, and Bullet-Tooth Tony. All this loaded up with a special item “Brand-New Caravan” inspired by the film, which players can find waiting in the garage."
