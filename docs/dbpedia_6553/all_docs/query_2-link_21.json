What’s more, the black and white lighthouse is easily recognisable.\n\nAgent Kelly (2020)\n\nKelly is a retired assassin in her 50s who returns to her old ways for (wait for it…..) revenge.\n\nShe escapes to Spain to avoid her hunters, ending up in Almería, where shooting of both kinds took place in El Ejido, Puerto Almerimar and Almería city.\n\nMore filming took place in the city of Málaga and in Motril, Granada.\n\nThe Legion (2020)\n\nThe Romans are bogged down in Armenia and send a messenger to get help. While they wait the actors can enjoy the mountains, lakes and valleys of the Natural Park of Somiedo in Asturias.\n\nAmong the park’s locations were La Farrapona at 1,708 metres, and the frozen lakes of Saliencia.\n\nThe crew’s lodgings were at Pola de Somiedo. In fact the staff at the Castillo del Alba hotel informed us that the actors practised their sword fighting on a terrace behind the hotel.\n\nThe messenger also has to cross a bit of desert, and for this they employed the lesser known desert of Gorafe in the province of Granada.\n\nWe were lucky to be accompanied by local tourism entrepreneur and film enthusiast Miguel, who drove us around in his 4X4 (totally necessary to visit all the good spots) showing us the locations of films and series.\n\nAccess to the location for this film is very complicated and can only be achieved with a 4X4 or possibly a helicopter.\n\nThe wild scenery is certainly spectacular.\n\nEnglish speaking Miguel can be contacted via his web site: http://www.geoparkgranada.com/\n\nAll this and Mickey Rourke too!\n\nWay Down (2020)\n\nCatalan director Jaume Balagueró is no stranger to international projects and this time combines Spanish and foreign actors in a heist movie with the 2010 World Cup final, won by Spain, as a backdrop.\n\nCentral Madrid was briefly shut down around the emblematic Plaza de Cibeles, as our stars tried to rob the Bank of Spain.\n\n41 days of shooting included scenes shot at the Palacio Cibeles (site of the Town Hall and the CentroCentro contemporary arts centre), Edificio Zúrich in calle Alcalá, Edificio Metrópolis on the corner of Gran Vía, Círculo de Bellas Artes, Instituto Cervantes, Palacio de Buenavista (HQ of the Spanish army) and the Biblioteca Nacional\n\nA thousand extras, 340 crew, 80 police officers and 80 soldiers took part. As did the Good Doctor, Freddie Highmore, who had actually lived in Madrid for a year.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 (2020)\n\nThe film begins with Diana as a child trying to win the Amazon Games. The beach she rides along was at Sotavento de Jandía, Fuerteventura, although the mountain scenes were filmed on Tenerife at Maciza de Teno and the gulley of Masca (where Wrath of the Titans was shot) and Isla Baja.\n\nIn September 2018, filming took place in Almería on the follow-up to Wonder Woman. The Alcazaba castle is supposedly that of the King of Crude, Emir Said Bin Abydos in Cairo, and was one of the main locations used, including the gardens of the Casa del Alcaide, the Cerro de San Cristóbal and the Muralla de Jayrán, which then becomes the wall dividing the Emir’s land from the rest.\n\nThe church of San Pedro with its twin towers also appears.\n\nA car chase took place on Fuerteventura, at the Corralejo sand dunes, where a village was built, and there was also filming at La Oliva around Parque Holandés and the beach of El Jablito.\n\nOn La Palma island, they superimposed images of a satellite headquarters, using the same location as the Aretuza island in The Witcher, which was also superimposed. It is here that the film reaches its finale and once more the world is saved.\n\nRifkin’s Festival (2020)\n\nWoody Allen does for San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa what he did for Barcelona, as well as Paris, London and even New York, with a film centred on the famous San Sebastián film festival and filming all over the city’s most iconic locations such as the Concha beach, which is the opening shot of San Sebastian and appears again as Felipe tries to seduce Wallace’s wife Sue under the boardwalk and also for the dreams of the Jules and Jim film.\n\nThe film begins and ends with Wallace talking to his psychiatrist, in a set constructed inside the Miramar Palace.\n\nWe see Wallace crossing the iconic Maria Cristina bridge, and then approach the Kursaal Centre, venue of the San Sebastian Film Festival.\n\nIn the Plaza Gipuzkoa gardens Wallace meets a friend who gives him the card of Jo, the doctor.\n\nIn the grounds of the Ariete Palace they shot the first black and white scene with all the characters from Wallace’s past.\n\nWallace visits the doctor, whose office is in Paseo Árbol de Gernika.\n\nWe then see him in a restaurant, Mirador de Ulia, with spectacular views of the beach.\n\nIn the Café de la Concha he chats to some festival goers and discovers Jo’s complicated past.\n\nFelipe is interviewed on the terrace of the Maria Cristina Hotel, where most of the characters are staying, and where Wallace and Sue later have breakfast.\n\nWallace kills time visiting the Donosti Bookshop in Plaza Bilbao. He kills some more time visiting the church of San Vicente.\n\nHe has a drink with Jo in the garden of the Botanika Café and later attends a party in Felipe’s honour at the San Telmo Museum. Felipe then plays the bongos in the Altxerri Bar.\n\nOn his day out with Jo they drive across the Maria Cristina Bridge before visiting the Chillida statue, Peine del Viento. They take a boat across the bay at Pasajes de San Juan and have a waterside picnic at Ereñozu.\n\nTwice they visit a market, located in Santiago Plaza, Pasai Donibane, where they buy bread and chocolate, and later Jo looks for a gift for her husband Paco.\n\nThe dream supper, based on Buñuel’s Exterminating Angel was filmed at Gipuzcoa Provincial Council.\n\nWallace phones Jo and says his farewells seated in front of the bandstand, the Kiosko del Boulevard.\n\nAs was the case in Barcelona, San Sebastian tourist office has organised a Movie Walk to visit the film’s locations as Allen indulges in all his usual obsessions.\n\nThe Roads Not Taken (2020)\n\nLa Isleta del Moro, where the writer spends his time in a bar on the beach and discusses how to end his book with two girls on a bar terrace, the Parque Natural Cabo de Gata (both represent Greece), while the cemetery of San José in the city of Almería and the desert of Tabernas (supposedly in his character’s native Mexico) were all locations in a film starring Javier Bardem, whose mental state is deteriorating, much to the displeasure of his daughter.\n\nThe cast used the Hotel Cortijo Paraiso in Los Escullos, where Pilar Miró filmed “El Pájaro de la Felicidad” in 1993 and the Hotel Elba in the city of Almería.\n\nRon Hopper’s Misfortune (2020)\n\nCanary Island director Jaime Falero shot the whole film in his native Tenerife, a story about Hell with Vinnie Jones as the Ferryman who takes you there.\n\nGranada Nights (2020)\n\nA young British-Asian man heads to Granada to save a relationship but arrives too late and has to make do with friendship and culture in this beautiful city.\n\nThe Alhambra inevitably features, but so does the Camborio Club for some more up to date scenes.\n\nWriter/Director Abid Khan informed us: “Here is some information on the major locations; we shot in a lot of locations around the city but these are the main scenes – If you need more details let me know?”\n\nHammam Al Ándalus, Cueva de Curro – Flamenco Cave with eccentric gypsy owner Curro, Cafe Futbol, Carmen de los Martires, Mirador de San Miguel, Camino del Sacromonte, Pub Legend, Café Bar Pennsylvania, Bohemia Jazz Café, Teteria Baghdad, Granada Inn Hostel, Centro Lenguas Modernas, Potemkin café, Hannigan & Sons Irish Pub.\n\n“We also all stayed in Hospedaje Almohada – we rented the whole place and this was actually the place that I stayed in 2005-2006 and started writing the script.\n\nAnother interesting fact is that I wrote the script on locations e.g. I wrote the Mirador scene at the mirador and the Camborio nightclub scene I wrote whilst I was at the nightclub! I wanted the film to be authentic to the place which is why I wrote in this way. We also shot the gypsy processions as they were happening and wrapped a fictional narrative around documentary scenes. With the vast history and culture of the city, it was important the locations needed to be a main character in their own right because this film in essence is a love letter to the city of Granada.”\n\nIt Snows in Benidorm (2020)\n\nIsabel Coixet directs this story set in the bright, murky location of Benidorm, Alicante, where some British citizens such as Timothy Spall take a break from sunny Manchester.\n\nThe Red Wall of Calpe has nothing to do with politics, but is an apartment complex designed by Ricardo Bofill. This and other locations such as Pola Park in Santa Pola, and the area between Hotel Canfali and Villa Venecia, make up some of the locations, as do the streets of Benidorm.\n\nCarmen Machi plays a policewoman obsessed with the presence of poetess Sylvia Plath in Benidorm in the 50s, and her house is located in Plaza del Torrejó.\n\nAlex’s workplace is located beneath Apartamentos Oasis.\n\nState of Prey (2020)\n\nA Scandinavian thriller with a mix of nationalities and languages, including English, much of the filming takes place in and around Torrevieja, Alicante, thanks to the ready supply of coastline, mountains, skyscrapers and natural light, according to its director.\n\nFilming also took place at Callosa de Segura, Benidorm, Santa Pola and Elche.\n\nThe Midnight Sky (2020)\n\nGeorge Clooney was on the Canary island of La Palma in February 2020 staying at the exclusive Hacienda de Abajo, at Tazacorte.\n\nOne of the locations for this film about a scientist stranded in the post-apocalyptic Arctic is the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos. Two scenes were shot there featuring Ethan (son of Gregory) Peck as the younger Augustine (Clooney), sacrificing all for science on ‘the island,’ at the ACTEC site.\n\nTrevor (2020)\n\nTrevor seems to be a classic ex-pat, living the good life at his villa in Spain, and then his daughter and her boyfriend come to visit.\n\nThe rolling countryside is to be found around Cardedeu in the province of Barcelona.\n\nChasing Wonders (2020)\n\nAlthough set in Australia, the film is about a Spanish family and stars Paz Vega and Edward James Olmos.\n\nFilming also took place in Barcelona, La Granada del Penedès, Sant Miquel D’olèrdola, Subirats, Viladellops. and Lleída.\n\nBlack Beach (2020)\n\nAlthough mostly shot in Spanish, there is also a fair amount of English dialogue, mostly at the beginning when the action takes place in Belgium, and also during an inspiring English class given by nuns in an African school.\n\nIn Gran Canaria, the oil drilling platforms in the bay of Las Palmas were one of the reasons for filming there, and the restaurant Segundo Muelle, next to the Hotel Santa Catalina was also used for the final meeting between Carlos and his mother.\n\nOther exteriors included Playa del Inglés, Puerto Rico, Puerto de Mogán and San Agustín.\n\nThe mansion where Carlos is lodged in Africa was actually in Gran Canaria as was some of the jungle.\n\nThe discotheque scene was filmed in Madrid, with what was hopefully a digitally inserted giraffe in the foyer.\n\nThe final chase scene was multinational, starting in Ghana, continuing in Toledo, moving on to Canarias. The car crashed in Toledo, in an African village which was built in Toledo inside a Spanish army camp. The action then returns to Madrid and Ghana.\n\nA Perfect Enemy (2020)\n\nKiké Maíllo directs another Spanish film shot in English, this time about an architect who has a run-in with a girl.\n\nFilmed in various locations in Barcelona, such as El Prat de Llobregat, El Maresme, L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Reus, Masia Freixa, Terrassa and Sant Vicenç de Montalt.\n\nAna Eiras of Sábado Películas informed us that filming took place in the trade fair, Fira de Reus, in Barcelona for interior shots, in Maresme and El Prat for car shots and in Terrassa on set at the Escola Superior de Cinema i Audiovisuals de Catalunya.\n\nOne Glorious Sunset (2020)\n\nThe problems of dealing with dementia when ‘Dad’ starts to lose it.\n\nFilmed on Tenerife. Deanna Dewey of TF Productions informed that “the film was mostly shot in the South of the Island with a few shots in the north and up in the mountains. The locations I can remember are Golf del Sur, Valle San Lorenzo, Puerto Colon and Los Abrigos.”\n\nThe Odd Perspective (2020)\n\nAnother production in English from the aFilm workshop based in Sitges, where some of the action takes place, as well as in Barcelona.\n\nMultiple murders and a synergist detective who can connect stuff!\n\nUs (2020)\n\nUs is a four part BBC mini series starring Tom Hollander, who tries to turn a failing marriage into a holiday romance instead of vice versa.\n\nHis holidays include Paris, Amsterdam, Venice and Barcelona, although Venice is in reality also Cataluña.\n\nTom is Douglas and is accompanied by his wife Connie (Saskia Reeves) and son Albie (Tom Taylor).\n\nIn episode 3 Albie leaves his parents to join a girl called Kat in Venice. Douglas searches for him there and comes across a couple of musicians in a typical Venetian square, which is plaza de Sant Felip Neri.\n\nDouglas meets a woman called Freja (Sofie Gråbøl), and they have a coffee on a hotel terrace, Hotel Neri (calle de Sant Sever, 5).\n\nIn episode 4 in plaza de Sant Felip Neri, Freja and Douglas have another coffee, when Douglas’s wife rings.\n\nFreja and Douglas go for a walk after supper and come across a Roman temple, which in reality is in the city of Vic in calle Pare Xifré. Then they walk along the arcades in the plaza Mayor.\n\nThe next day Douglas visits Siena, but it’s still Vic, and here we see him sitting on the steps of the Sant Pere cathedral.\n\nIn episode 5 Douglas actually travels to Barcelona, and finds his son leaving a disco, which is in fact number 4 plaza Sant Josep Oriol.\n\nIn a flashback we see Connie and Douglas watching the light show at the Font Mágica.\n\nThe next day Douglas wanders through plaza Carles Buïgas by the Font Mágica. We see him talking to Albie with the MNAC as a backdrop.\n\nDouglas and Albie drink coffee with churros in Bar El Mendizábal in calle Junta de Comerç, 2. That night they have a drink in Granja El Drac de Sant Jordi in plaza de Sant Josep Oriol, 3. After visiting a disco we see them sitting on a bench inside pasaje del Crèdit on the corner of calle Baixada de Sant Miquel. The disco was in fact a vegetarian restaurant called Salida, at 7 Baixada de Sant Miquel, although the interiors were filmed in Sitges. Returning to their hotel they pass through plaza Real and las Ramblas.\n\nThen we see Albie and Douglas enter the Estación de Francia in Avenida Marqués de l’Argentera to catch a train to Sitges.\n\nIn episode 6 they are back in Barcelona. From a taxi we see Paseo Picasso and la Pedrera before arriving at a rented flat in calle Teodor Roviralta.\n\nDouglas and Connie accompany Albie to the Estación de Francia to see him off.\n\nWe then have a tour of the city including plaza de Sant Felip Neri, the Bisbe bridge and the sculpture of the Toro Pensador by Josep Granyer y Giralt in Rambla Cataluña.\n\nDouglas and Connie walk around the barrio Gótico to the plaza del Pi through a market to a juice bar which in reality is the Giovanni ice cream shop.\n\nWe see the Montjuic cable car, and Connie looking at the city from the Jardines de Miramar.\n\nThey visit the Fundación Miró, and we also see plaza Cataluña, the Calatrava Tower and Paseo de Gracia before they return home.\n\nBill and Ted Face the Music (2020)\n\nKeanu Reeves stars in an update of an old story about two rockers trying to save the world.\n\nAlthough filmed entirely in Louisiana USA, San Dimas, set in the year 2720, is in fact Santiago Calatrava’s City of Arts and Sciences (CAC) of Valencia, also used in George Clooney’s Tomorrowland, although this time the stars stayed home and did everything on green screen, while Valencia’s sci-fi complex was padded out with some serious CGI. One such example of padding, was adding Calatrava’s Montjuïc Communications Tower, located in Barcelona’s Olympic Park and built in order to transmit the 1992 Olympic Games.\n\nCAC represents the home of the Great Ones, led by Holland Taylor, Charlie Sheen’s mother in Two and a Half Men.\n\nThe Music Island (2021)\n\nThe music island is of course Ibiza, although this philosophical film was also shot in the UK and Bulgaria.\n\nLast Letter from your Lover (2021)\n\nFilming of the flashback scenes to 1965 took place in and around the internationally famous Formentor Hotel at the eastern extreme of Mallorca, representing the French Riviera, in a romance spanning decades.\n\nOff the Rails (2021)\n\nThe cast includes Judi Dench and Franco Nero, and some flight scenes were shot at the Bennisalem Aeródrom in Mallorca, where a selection of planes can be seen.\n\nThe modernist architecture of the capital, Palma, is seen in some evening shots and El Passeig des Born de Palma represents Paris, while Costa de la Pols also appears. The 13th century gothic Basílica of Sant Francesc and the parish of Santa Eulàlia are seen and also the cathedral, where on 2nd February the Festa de la Llum was woven into the plot. The stained glass windows of the cathedral play a role in the plot.\n\nFilming took place in Pollença too.\n\nThe Eternals (2021)\n\nAngelina Jolie stars in a science fiction story about immortals who visit the volcanic wasteland of the Teide National Park, Tenerife.\n\nLanzarote and Fuerteventura are also involved and represent pre-historic landscapes for a film that spans the ages as the Gods meddle in the affairs of Man.\n\nShooting in Fuerteventura took place around Ampuyenta and nearby El Espinal, as well as Buen Paso and on the volcanic, black beach at La Solapa at Pájara, all of which are in the Parque Rural de Betancuria, representing ancient Mesopotamia.\n\nThe film is part of the Marvel empire, and the crew stayed at two hotels in El Castillo, including the Sheraton Fuerteventura Beach at Caleta de Fuste.\n\nFor a touch of the Amazon, the crew moved to Fragas do Eume, a forest in the Galician province of La Coruña.\n\nThe Internationalist (2021)\n\nAn Australian photographer goes in search of his grandfather, who disappeared during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nThe locations include Corbera del Ebro, (Tarragona), and Barcelona.\n\nToday Corbera’s old town, destroyed in the Battle of the Ebro in 1938, has been conserved in its ruined state, and the church is now an exhibition centre, reminding us of its tragic history.\n\nBorrego (2021)\n\nA botanist researching in the desert gets caught up in a drug smuggling ring.\n\nThe desert concerned was Tabernas in Almeria, and not California.\n\nTrue Things (2021)\n\nRuth Wilson stars in a drama produced by Jude Law and which has been filmed in the province of Málaga.\n\nThe Paseo Marítimo Ciudad de Melilla was one location, as was Plaza de la Merced, with some interiors shot in a flat in La Malagueta.\n\nThe port, the historic centre and the town of Benalmádena also appear.\n\nGunfight at Dry River (2021)\n\nTwo abandoned villages in the province of Tarragona, Piñeres and Corbera de Ebro, are used to recreate a Mexican township with water problems; a topical question in Catalonia and the rest of Spain.\n\nCorbera del Ebro’s tatty, desolated look is not so much due to drought, as to the fact that the old town was destroyed during the Battle of the Ebro in Spain’s Civil War in 1938.\n\nThe desert scenery of Tozal de la Cobeta, Monegros, Zaragoza is also employed.\n\nSAS: Red Notice (2021)\n\nAnother story by ex-SAS soldier Andy McNab, about a fellow SAS man, Buckingham, trapped in the Chunnel by terrorists with his girlfriend.\n\nBuckingham has a place in Mallorca at Son Marroig, which was also used in The Kovac Box (2006).\n\nThe final wedding scene includes images of the Sa Foradada peninsula hole in a cliff, allegedly made by a cannonball in a 1582 conflict between North African pirates and Majorcan Christians.\n\nDon’t Come Here (2021)\n\nAs opposed to wishing you were here, as a tourist is murdered on idyllic Mallorca.\n\nFilming took place around the village of Campos, and especially at Sa Barrala, where the forest cabins were located.\n\nUnder Spanish Skies (2021)\n\nA very international cast with actors and crew from Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tunisia, China, Japan, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Canada, U.S.A.

We shot the film in August, 2019 and completed it in June, 2021”.\n\nFinca Juncarejo represents the main building with the pool and small belfry where widowed Leah lives.\n\nRed Notice (2021)\n\nThis year sees two films with Red Notice in the title, as this is the name of an Interpol alert.\n\nThis international film stars Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot.\n\nJohnson and Reynolds travel to Valencia to rob arch-villain Sottovoce, although an aerial view of the city’s main square for two seconds is all we see.\n\nReynolds and Johnson escape the clutches of Sottovoce and escape through a trap door into the middle of a bullfight. Johnson is butted by a bull in the bullring, which was that of Antequera, Málaga, with 300 locals as extras, although the aerial shot is of the Sevilla bullring, La Maestranza, both of which are supposed to be Valencia.\n\nHitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard (2021)\n\nAlthough mostly shot in Croatia, the presence of Antonio Banderas brought about some scenes in Málaga, specifically in Hacienda Nadales, a banqueting venue, and an industrial estate building at Guadalhorce.\n\nThe Nanny’s Night (2021)\n\nThe interiors of this horror story were shot in a house in Valdemoro, with exteriors nearby in Valdetorres del Jarama, both in Madrid.\n\nThe film marks the debut of Ignacio López, a close collaborator of author and director Victor Matellano.\n\nSend it! (2021)\n\nA kite-boarding story of love and surf with a cameo by Richard Branson (that’s how Trump got started and you heard it here first!)\n\nPedro Barbadillo of the Mallorca Film Commission informed us that shooting took place in North Carolina, Texas and a day’s shooting in Mallorca on 11 July 2018 and three weeks of preparation.\n\nThe filming took place at sea and covered an area between the cathedral in Palma to Es Malgrats.\n\nOnce again Palma Pictures was the local production collaborator.\n\nSpace Jam: A New Legacy (2021)\n\nAlthough no humans were to be found on Tenerife, not even LeBron James, who played a similar role to Michael Jordan in the original version, a lot of the technical cartoon work took place at the Tomavision studios.\n\nThe Matador’s Cape (2022)\n\nMartial arts expert Gary Wasniewski tries his hand at bullfighting, with filming in the bullring at Almería, and in Talavera de la Reina, Toledo.\n\nThe film is a variation on a standard theme of what to do when someone assassinates your wife.\n\nUncharted (2022)\n\nFirst there was a Playstation game, and then came the movie.\n\nWhen brothers Nathan and Sam are arrested, they are taken to an orphanage, the Recinto Modernista de Sant Pau (Sant Antoni Maria Claret, 167); a former hospital, now a museum in Barcelona.\n\nStarring Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg and Antonio Banderas, filming took place in October 2020 along the Costa Blanca, Alicante.\n\nThe Granadella cove was once again used, as it was in The Cold Light of Day.\n\nThe Cova dels Orguens, a cave that can only be reached by sea below Cap San Antoni, also appears. It is here that Nathan finds Magellan’s lost ships, although this was a set constructed elsewhere.\n\nNathan and Sully meet Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), in Plaza de Carles Buigas, site of the Font Mágica de Montjuic. They talk on the roof of the Pabellón Victòria Eugènia, and they chase her past the fountain of the Plaza de las Cascadas, and then through a market situated in Plaza de Josep Puig i Cadafalch. The chase ends at her car in Plaza de las Cascadas.\n\nThen we see Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) arguing with his father Armando (Manuel de Blas) in the Born Centro de Cultura y Memoria.\n\nSantiago Moncada meets his father again in Plaza Gaudí in full view of the Sagrada Familia.\n\nThey visit the church of Santa Maria del Pi looking for the treasure or clues to its whereabouts.\n\nSully and Braddock fight in Bar Pisamorena (Consolat de Mar, 37).\n\nSecret tunnels abound and Sully talks down to Nathan and Chloe as they try to emerge from a sewer in Plaza Sant Felip Neri.\n\nThe action moves to the Phillipines, although the beach is in reality that of Lloret de Mar, Girona. The coves at Sa Boadella and Treumal were employed.\n\nFor the prison scene at the end, where we see brother Sam writing postcards, they once again used the Recinto Modernista de Sant Pau.\n\nDuring the credits we find Nathan and Sully in a bar in Havana, in reality Barcelona in the Mescladís del Pou, Calle Carders, 35, setting the scene for the follow up movie.\n\nAsteroid City (2022)\n\nThis Wes Anderson film was shot from August to October 2021 near Chinchón (Madrid), where a western-type set and a train station were built.\n\nThe golf course at Aranjuez was used for filming on September 6th.\n\n200 local people were contracted as extras and the Chinchón Parador was sealed off for mere mortals until December 1st.\n\nStars such as Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Carell are in it.\n\nOperation Mincemeat (2022)\n\nColin Firth stars in a remake of ‘The Man who Never Was’, which also had scenes shot in Spain, at the beach and cemetery where the corpse was washed up and buried respectively in Huelva.\n\nHowever, the new version was filmed in Málaga, largely because of its busy, international airport, much to the displeasure of the people of Huelva.\n\nThe local film office informs that the locations are Málaga Town Hall, Gardens de Puerta Oscura and the San Miguel cemetery.\n\nAt the end we see the real grave of the body used, in Huelva cemetery, as we do in The Man who Never Was.\n\nThe Man from Rome (2022)\n\nSet in Sevilla and Rome, a computer hacker meets a ghostly 17th century church (or something like that).\n\nAfter the credits we see an aerial shot encompassing the Guadalquivir river and the bullring.\n\nThe action in Sevilla was filmed in Plaza de San Francisco, including the Town Hall, and around Plaza Nueva. The Town Hall represents the Archbishop’s palace, which Father Quart, a gun-toting far from chaste priest visits. Both the Sala del Apeadero and the Sala Capitular Baja were used.\n\nThe historic town of Carmona also appears; the Church of the Virgen de las Lágrimas, so important in the film, is in reality the 16th century Convento de la Concepción, now empty. We can see a cloister through a door at times, and at the end in an aerial view, showing us that this is a convent rather than a simple church.\n\nThe Palacio de la Motilla in calle Cuna is the home of the Bruner family. This palace will probably become a hotel in the near future.\n\nNot all is monuments, Sevilla’s river, the Guadalquivir also features considerably, as do its bridges, Cristo de la Expiración and Triana and the Muelle (dock) de la Sal.\n\nThere are also scenes in the riverside Restaurante Abades Triana, with its views of Sevilla’s emblematic Torre de Oro. Here Quart has lunch with Macarena Bruner. When Father Ferro is kidnapped, he is held on a riverboat, and we see the well-known Luna de Triana.\n\nShooting also took place in Paseo de Colón, Plaza de Toros, calle Betis, Hotel Renacimiento de la Cartuja, where Quart stays and is attacked, and calle Parras.\n\nYet another film based on a novel by Arturo Perez-Reverte, with performances by the actor who played Conan as a boy, Jorge Sanz.\n\nSimón Andreu plays the President of the bank that is the focus of evil in the film.\n\nMarlowe (2022)\n\nPhilip Marlowe is not a new subject for a film, and Liam Neeson is not a newcomer to filming in Spain, but shooting Marlowe is Manresa, in the province of Barcelona is an original idea.\n\nAccompanied by Colm Meaney and some period cars and costumes, in November 2021 the actor was to be seen filming in calle Jaume I in the Bar Restaurante Miami, which was converted into Schmidt’s Liquors in faraway Los Angeles.\n\nIn this scene they discuss the brutal murder of Peterson’s sister.\n\nMarlowe’s first encounter with the sister takes place in the vaults of a cemetery.

Scenes were shot in the Camino del Coso.\n\nAfter Sax the film moved on to Novelda, to areas known as Paraje Natural Clots de la Sal and Serra de la Mola, where two scenes were shot. The first consisted of a Taliban ambush of an American convoy, and in the second the Taliban search a vehicle, and in the following gunfight two bodies are thrown into a river, which was in fact the Vinalopó.\n\nThe area was chosen because one of the production team, holidaying in Altea, visited the Santuario de Santa María Magdalena in Novelda and noticed how the countryside was similar to Afghanistan.\n\nThe final action scenes around a dam and reservoir were filmed at the Amadorio reservoir, which provides water to Villajoyosa.\n\nThe airport scenes were shot at Zaragoza’s Garrapinillos airport, with some magical mountains added using CGI.\n\nHustle (2022)\n\nAdam Sandler returned to Mallorca, (he filmed scenes from Jack and Jill there with Al Pacino) for a story about a basketball scout who hopes he’s found a new star in Spain, although most of the film takes place in Philadelphia.\n\nThe scene where Sandler discovers Bo playing basketball in a rough neighbourhood was shot at El Rafal, while the more professional players played in the Son Moix Polideportivo.\n\nThe flat where Bo and his family live can be found at Nou Llevant.\n\nAt the beginning Sandler visits various countries looking for his star, among them Russia, where the artificial snow was in fact created at Pollença.\n\nThe scene where Sandler is offered a job at a hotel with a pool was filmed at Sa Fortalesa.\n\nThe Mother (2022)\n\nJennifer Lopez and Joseph Fiennes star in a film interrupted by the pandemic, where Gran Canaria represents Cuba.\n\nShooting took place there around Plaza Cairasco, Alameda de Colón, Gabinete Literario (a cultural centre from whose balcony Lopez and Fiennes look out and chat in happier times) and Hotel Madrid.\n\nEl Salobre, Berriel airfield, plaza de Santa Ana, Casa de Colón, La Isleta, Calle Guzmán El Bueno, the districts of San Cristóbal, La Isleta and San Juan de Las Palmas with its defensive battery, Calles Malteses and Bravo Murillo all feature.\n\nThe motorbike and stolen car chase scene took place around San Cristóbal, San Telmo park with its iconic bandstand and calle Canalejas, as well as Fataga and Meloneras.\n\n60 kilometres from the capital, at San Bartolomé de Tirajana, a luxurious villa called Monte Léon, was employed as Hector’s house, which Lopez trashes in rescuing Zoe.\n\nAnd 11 kilometres away, the Marquesa Garden at Aruca, with its 2,500 species of plants from 5 continents, offered a touch of exotica, while a gulley at Artenara offers us a view of palm trees in another scene.\n\nD is for Detroit (2022)\n\nA young man called Tarquin, getting away from drugs and London, discovers sun, scenery and music in Ibiza, including a shot of the magical island of Es Vedra.\n\nA Man of Action (2022)\n\nA Spanish film, about an anarchist, Lucio Urtubia, with characters speaking English and Spanish.

The Casa da Cultura Galega became a bank that Lucio robs.\n\nVigo’s port also features, as does the old barracks of the Civil Guard, as well as Plaza Estrela, the Xunta building and the pedestrian area of O Calvario and a café terrace between Rúa Montero Ríos and Rúa de Concepción Arenal.\n\nSantiago de Compostela, A Coruña appears too, including Calle das Ameas, Praza do Obradoiro, Praza de Salvador Parga, Calle de San Francisco, Calle de Santo Agostiño and Alameda Park.\n\nFrom 1 to 15 October del 2021, filming took place in Tarragona, using the Complex Educatiu, the Banco de España and the old provincial prison, located in Avenida L’Argentina.\n\nThe film was actually set in Paris, which is recognisable in the scenes where the Eiffel Tower appears.\n\nWho Killed Che Guevara (2022)\n\nThe title speaks for itself. Figueras (Girona) was among the locations.\n\nPlanet of the Astronauts (2022)\n\nA spoof movie (I think) about astronauts returning to a devastated Earth, post-Covid.\n\nAmong the locations they visit, searching for a remedy, is Barcelona, where we see two lovers kissing in front of the famous fountain in the Ciutadella park.\n\nDead Man, Don’t Die (2022)\n\nGerman director (and actor here) Dirk Roche filmed most of this at the Fort Bravo township in Tabernas, Almería.\n\nWith a Budget of only 41,000 euros, the movie was shot in 18 days, with a six month interruption due to the Covid crisis.\n\nWhat About Love (2023)\n\nStarring Sharon Stone and Andy García, and with a load of Spanish actors too, the film was made in the USA, Rumania and Catalonia in October 2012.\n\nThe locations include Barcelona, (especially the Cuitadella park, where the steps leading up to Neptune’s statue play an important part in the romance) Canet de Mar, Montserrat and Tossa de Mar (Girona), made famous in the 50s when Ava Gardner filmed ‘Pandora and the Flying Dutchman’ there.\n\nSome images were also shot in Begur, Castelldefells, Gavà, El Prat de Llobregat, Jardines de Santa Clotilde in Lloret de Mar, Pals and Sitges.\n\nDirected by Klaus Menzel, it is the story of an American Senator’s daughter who falls in love with a cinema director in Barcelona, with whom she sets off on their own road movie.\n\nLucas (2023)\n\nJuan Pedro Ortega directs a film about a serial killer with footage from his native Barcelona.\n\nFyre Rises (2023)\n\nA reluctant ex-mercenary is forced to return to his old ways.\n\nWriter-Director Paul Knight informed us: “We shot in Lanzarote, in Puerto Del Carmen in early September 2022 – in and around the local town”.\n\nAmerican Star (2023)\n\nSpanish director Gonzalo López-Gallego filmed this film set in Fuerteventura in Fuerteventura.\n\nA professional assassin goes there to fulfil a contract and has to take time off due to a delay.\n\nAs American Star was a ship, wrecked near Fuerteventura in 1994, we can expect it to play a part.\n\nCatching Dust (2023)\n\nFour weeks of filming at Puerto del Rosario, Antigua and La Oliva on the island of Fuerteventura produced a story of white trailer trash in the desert as two couples work out their differences.\n\nUncancelled (2023)\n\nIt started with a wedding between Australian film maker Luke Eve and his bride María Armiñana, which was cancelled due to COVID 19.\n\nTrapped in Valencia, they decided to make a documentary out of their experience, although it later became this feature film, a mixture of truth and fiction with some professional actors.\n\nTheir prison was Valencia, and among the locations were El Palmar, a village famous for its multiple paella restaurants, the Sueca rice fields and the Malvarrosa beach, where Sorolla used to paint and Hemingway used to imbibe.\n\nJourney to Bethlehem (2023)\n\nAntonio Banderas leads the cast of a musical version of the birth of Christ.\n\nRepresenting the Holy Land are Almería, where Nicolas Ridley’s set from Exodus at El Chorrillo, in the Sierra de Alhamilla was brought out of retirement as Mary and Joseph make their way to destiny.\n\nThe movie makers favourite beach, Monsúl, also appears.\n\nBanderas plays Herod, and his lair is the often used castle of Santa Bárbara, Alicante, especially the dungeons, where filming took place in February 2023.\n\nBird Box Barcelona (2023)\n\nAs Woody Allen basically makes the same film in different cities, so this version of Sandra Bullock’s California Bird Box takes the franchise to Barcelona, in a film made in Spanish and English, depending on who is speaking to whom.\n\nIn the opening scene Sebastián and his daughter Anna go skating at a sports centre, which is located in Granollers. Three nasty blindmen attack them in the Antigua Fábrica Mercedes-Benz (calle Sant Adrià, 65). As they emerge outside the CGI shifts into top gear (at least I hope it’s CGI) and we see Eixample, completely wrecked.\n\nScenes of destruction ensue, including people hanging from a bridge at Baró de Viver. We also see plaza Cataluña and the Barceloneta beach, where a cruise ship is sinking and bodies abound.\n\nSebastián and Anna wander around an industrial estate, which is Carretera del Mig, Hospitalet.\n\nThe ensuing bus depot scene was also filmed in the antigua fábrica Mercedes-Benz.\n\nIn a flashback we see some wind turbines, which are at Falgars del Bas, Girona.\n\nSebastián’s office is in the Torre Pujades, calle Provençals. Out in the same street, a man crashes to the ground.\n\nHe seeks refuge in the underground, the station being Selva de Mar, but the suicide bug is spreading.\n\nSebastián seeks his daughter at her school, the Casa de la Convalecencia in calle Sant Antoni M.ª Claret, 17. The chapel is in La Salle Bonanova (Paseo Bonanova, 8).\n\nSebastián looks down from a building and sees Palacio de la Virreina, and an obelisk in the Diagonal.\n\nWith Claire Rafa and Octavio he goes to a refuge (Torre del Reloj, Plaza de la Vila de Gracia)\n\nThey meet Sophia and we see an aerial view with torre Mapfre, hotel Arts and the Tibidabo church.\n\nAfter a lot of hiding, from a building they observe a church, which is the dome of the Basílica de la Mercè.\n\nOn Monjuic mountain Claire and Sophia take the cable car and we see the Montjuic castle, where Bird Box Barcelona 2 is clearly being set up.\n\nSpanish, German and English are all used in a film that is clearly aiming for an international market.\n\nSee You on Venus (2023)\n\nThis is a film with a message; and the message is that you can park your van anywhere in Spain, but especially, near or even under national monuments.\n\nMia and Kyle travel from California to Spain to find her birth mother. She has a list of candidates and criss-crosses the country checking out each of them.\n\nFirst she visits Segovia, and quite naturally they leave the van unmolested beneath the Roman aqueduct, as one does.\n\nAs they check out the city we see the cathedral, a man painting next to a statue of Juan Bravo, (a 16th century leader of the Comuneros revolt, for which he was executed) and a long shot of the Alcazar castle.\n\nThey move on to Valencia, passing through the Plaza Redondo, which used to sell birds and now sells embroidery and tourist stuff.\n\nAfter some serious criss-crossing we see them in San Sebastian, Gipuzkoa, looking down on the Concha beach from Monte Igueldo.\n\nZooming back to Valencia, they eat strawberries beside the Central Market, pass quickly through Benidorm, Alicante, back to the province of Valencia at the Port Saplaya residential area, whose marina has earned it the title of Little Venice, and then back to Altea, near Benidorm, to play a bit of soccer with some kids in the Plaza de la Iglesia, with its church the Virgen del Consuelo.\n\nAt a romantic beachside restaurant with a little island just off the coast, Kyle discovers the relationship between Mia and Noah and gets upset. The island is Portichol on the Costa Blanca, and the restaurant in Cala Portichol is Cala Clemence.\n\nJust writing about this is getting exhausting! But we haven’t finished yet; it’s back to Valencia to visit the Plaza de la Virgen, with its cathedral, where Mia reveals her situation as regards her heart operation.\n\nUndeterred by stress they shoot up to Consuegra, Toledo, driving past the castle and windmills, although the road is a dead end in reality.\n\nSensibly, they then end up in the city of Toledo, with views of the Alcazar, and spend a night in the city’s Parador, with its view of the River Tajo.\n\nThen its off to Cuenca, for a chance to drive past the famous Hanging Houses, and to find her Mum.\n\nMission accomplished they slip into La Granja Palace of San Idelfonso and of course are able to park among the fountains and gardens at night with no other tourists present, as is usually the case.\n\nAnd of course, thanks to the excellent Spanish health service, the operation is a success.\n\nAgent of Solitude (2023)\n\nA CIA agent pursues a terrorist across Europe, including Barcelona.\n\nFast X (2023)\n\nWith Vin Diesel and Jason Statham in the lead roles you might expect some fisticuffs and horseless carriages, and you’d be right.\n\nAlthough mostly shot in Portugal and Italy, the final scene takes place at the Aldeadávila dam in Salamanca province; the same dam that appears in Doctor Zhivago and Terminator: Dark Fate.\n\nVenom 3 (2024)\n\nAnother Marvel superhero bites the dust of Almería. Local expert and author José Enrique Martinez informed us that filming was taking place in Rambla El Búho and Las Lomillas, and that star Tom Hardy was training at the Dayron gym in Huércal.\n\nAnother key location was Cartagena, Murcia. Sets were built in the Los Mateos district of the city, representing Mexico.\n\nAnother location was the Calblanque nature reserve, to the east of the city.\n\nFilming also took place in the newly reopened Ciudad de la Luz studios in Alicante province.\n\nIn Huesca province the Gállego river was the protagonist for some white water scenes shot around Mallos de Riglos and Murillo de Gállego between 5th and 7th March 2024.\n\nThe Assessment (2024)\n\nFilming took place in Tenerife in August 2023 at Abades in the district of Arico. Who knows if they took advantage of the abandoned leper sanatorium there.\n\nIt wouldn’t be surprising, as this dystopian film deals with the abandonment of the planet due to climate change.\n\nAlicia Vikander and Elizabeth Olsen star in a film directed by Fleur Fortuné. Not much gender diversity there!\n\nDen of Thieves 2 (2024)\n\nGerard Butler stars in a thriller set in Marseilles but filmed largely in Tenerife. Evin Ahmad, who answered the question who is Erin Carter? co-stars after making the eponymous series in Barcelona.\n\nFilming in the island capital Santa Cruz involved making some changes. A jeweller’s was created in calle Del Castillo and a police booth on the corner of calles Teobaldo Power and Imeldo Serís.\n\nA bar called La Capilla in calle Salamanca, became a French bar called La Chapelle.\n\nSome scenes were shot at the port and a beach, Las Teresitas, was used when Butler and Jackson emerge fully clothed from the water.\n\nDaniela Forever (2024)\n\nHenry Golding plays a man trying to contact his dead girlfriend through dream therapy.\n\nLocations include Madrid.\n\nKilling Rainbow (2024)\n\nNot just Rainbow but a whole plethora of people being whacked. Fortunately most of them deserve it.\n\nSome scenes were filmed Marbella, Malaga, where a hitman meets Ruby, and Tenerife, where a hotel supposedly in Florida appears.\n\nThe Path Less Travelled (2024)\n\nShiloh travels to Barcelona in search of treasure, with a dead wife, a grandfather’s story and nothing to lose.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Spain (2024)\n\nThis comedy involving some zany characters takes us to various Spanish locations (hence the title) including the castle of Gibralfaro in Málaga and the deserted beaches of the Canary Island of Fuerteventura.\n\nIn Torremolinos, Málaga the action takes place at the adults only Hotel Sirenos, where Cindy practises her singing on the roof, combined with the castle and local beaches. The tourist shops are also located there.\n\nCindy and Joey visit the Gibralfaro castle, from which they look down at the bullring, which he calls the Colosseum. She agrees that everything here is ancient!\n\nArgylle (2024)\n\nTruth may be stranger than fiction, but sometimes it’s the same thing.\n\nThis thriller starring Henry Cavill includes some scenes shot in Tenerife.\n\nVanilla (2024)\n\nA gay couple try to shore up their rocky relationship with a trip to Barcelona, but a third party complicates matters.\n\nRun Baby Run (2024)\n\nNot many international films have been made in Teruel province, but this thriller helps balance things out a bit, with most of its locations being there.\n\nThe production team set up camp in Alcalá de la Selva, and used various nearby locations such as the quarry at Villafranca del Campo, where some car chase scenes were shot.\n\nBezas, Cedrillas, Gúdar, Mora de Rubielos, Rubielos de Mora, Villarluengo, the reservoir at Balagueras, and Valdelinares, which is a ski resort.\n\nFilming also took place at the director’s native Sabadell, Barcelona.\n\nGodzilla x Kong: The New Empire (2024)\n\nWhile on a rampage, Godzilla trashes the Colosseum in Rome, a French nuclear plant and then Cádiz, where we briefly see locals fleeing past the Gran Teatro Falla in Plaza Fragela.\n\nThe Room Next Door (2025)\n\nPedro Almodovar finally makes a full length English language film with the help of Julianne Moore and Tilda Swinton.\n\nFilming took place in the US and in Madrid.\n\nIn the province of Guadalajara, Almodovar spent 17 days in March 2024 shooting in the village of El Cubillo de Uceda. A house was built between the town and Viñuelas, and later burnt unfortunately. Another cinema tourism attraction gone up in smoke.\n\nIn the Grey (2025)\n\nWe know it stars Henry Cavill along with Javier Bardem’s brother Carlos, and that it has been filmed in Tenerife. One of the locations was Tenerife’s Casino in plaza de La Candelaria.\n\nAlong the coast another location was San Andres, where a gulley known as Las Teresitas and the neighbourhood of Suculum were used.\n\nThe Island (2025)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and his real life partner Rooney Mara are to star in a film by Pawel Pawlikowski, which will include filming on Fuerteventura.\n\nDivine Remedy (2025)\n\nThis Icelandic comedy tells the story of a group of priests who come to Spain in search of decent plonk.\n\nStarting out in Reikiavik their quest takes them to Laguardia, Bodegas Altos de Rioja, Bodegas Valdelana, Bodegas Lecea, Muga in Haro, San Millán de la Cogolla, Ermita de los Arcos in Tricio and Nuestra Señora de la Asunción in Arenzana de Abajo.\n\nThe Gentleman (2025)\n\nRon Perlman, whose brilliant, multi-linguist performance in The Name of the Rose really made the film, stars as an American gentleman out for revenge on the streets of San Sebastian, Gipuzkoa.\n\nAccording to Salvi García of dypcomunicacion the film was made partially in English, being the debut of Mexican director Gabriel Beristain.\n\nSalvi sent us a long list of locations: Palacio de Aiete, Calle Garibai, 14, Parque Alderdi-Eder, Plaza Lasta, S/N, Edificio Servicios local 4, Mari Kalea, Virgen del Coro church, Calle Moraza, 2, Larramendi Kalea, 14, Calle Jose Miguel de Barandiaran 28, Palacio de Miramar, all in the city of San Sebastian.\n\nIn nearby San Juan they filmed in Pasai Donibane, Donibane Kalea, 1, Santiago Plaza and the San Juan Bautista church.\n\nThey also shot in Usurbil, Irún, Atotxa Hernani and Errenteria.\n\nBlade Runner 2099 (2025)\n\nThe follow up to Blade Runner 2049, also filmed partly in Spain, which was of course the follow up to Blade Runner.\n\nAlthough not confirmed, it is believed that some filming will take place in Barcelona, suitably modified of course.\n\nTV Series Made in Spain\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nIn Game of Thrones, the Alcazaba of Almería represented the castle of Sunspear, the capital of Dorne, kingdom of the Martell family. Some benches created for the series can still be seen there.\n\nIt is here that Ellaria murders Doran Martell. Later in Season 6 episode 10, none other than Diana Rigg discusses avenging with Indira and her fighting females.\n\nFor the interiors however the Real Alcázar of Sevilla represented the Water Palace Gardens of ‘Dorne,’ where Ellaria and Doran Martell argue about revenge and where Jaime and Bronn go to rescue Myrcella in Season 5 episode 2.\n\nAlso in the province of Sevilla is the town of Osuna, whose bullring was the site of the Fighting Pit in Season 5, when Daenerys Targaryen fights the Sons of Harpy and rides her dragon.\n\nNearby at Santiponce are the ruins of Italica, a Roman city, the cradle of emperors such as Trajan and Hadrian, founded in 206 BC. The amphitheatre which had a capacity of 25,000 spectators is used as a backdrop for the ruins of the Dragon Well. It is here that Daenerys negotiates with Cersei, asking for her cooperation against the White Walkers in episode 9 of Season 5.\n\nIn Season 8, episode 6 it hosts one of the final scenes as the nobles judge Jon Snow and Tyrion.\n\nCórdoba, and specifically its long Roman bridge, was used in Season 5, episode 3 to represent the city of Volantis, which Tyrion and Varys cross, although the bridge has been modified to include houses like the one in Florence. In a later episode, Theon and Yara cross the bridge to take refuge in the city.\n\nIn Season 5, episode 1, Cersei arrives for her father’s funeral and climbs the steps to Girona’s CGI modified cathedral. The same steps are seen in the wedding between Tommen and Margaery in episode 3.\n\nIn episode 6 of Season 6, Jaime Lannister rides up the same steps to confront the High Sparrow, only to be let down by King Tommen.\n\nIn episode 1 of Season 6 we find blinded Arya Stark begging by the gardens behind the cathedral in calle Obispo Josep Cartañà.\n\nThe cathedral nave is the Great Sept of Baelor, while the old library that Sam visits in Season 6 episode 10 is in the monastery of San Pedro de Galligans, where we see him in Season 7 episode 1 serving his apprenticeship.\n\nThe play that Arya watches, and which we see on more than one occasion, took place in Plaça dels Jurats.\n\nLater in Season 7 Arya Stark walks through Braavos market looking for a way to abandon Braavos. The market was located in the Paseo Arqueológico of Gerona and in calle del Rey Fernando el Católico, in front of the entrance to the Baños Árabes.\n\nArya will revisit the Baths, built in 1194, when she is chased there in Season 6 episode 8 by the Waif and upsets fruit sellers tumbling down the steps of Sant Domènec.\n\nIn the province of Guadalajara, the abandoned castle of Zafra was employed to represent The Tower of Joy in the Red Mountains of Dorne. It his here that Bran and the Three Eyed Raven watch Bran’s father Lord Eddard Stark fighting Sir Arthur Dayne in episode 3 of Season 6. At first it’s 6 against 2, then 4 against 1, but a knife in the back balances the score. Later in episode 10, we see what happens when Eddard enters the castle.\n\nThe 12th century castle was built upon previous Visigoth and Moorish fortifications and guarded the border between Christian and Moorish forces.\n\nBack in Almería, Mesa Roldán castle appeared in season 6, episode 9, representing Meereen. Here there is a meeting between the Masters and Daenerys and her allies, interrupted by a dragon perching on the castle and some throat slitting. We also see the quarries of Majadas Viejas (Sorbas) at the same time.\n\nDriving up to the Sierra Alhamilla spa, below you to the right you see an avenue of palm trees and various abandoned buildings. The site began as a mining location and the sets were later constructed by Ridley Scott for Exodus. Later they would be employed in Game of Thrones as a Dothraki settlement, Vaes Dothrak. The series Penny Dreadful also used this location.\n\nIn episodes 1 and 3 they used the Rambla de Búho for the scenes with the Dothraki taking Daenerys to Vaes Dothrak, passing under the giant statues of two horses (courtesy of CGI of course). In episode 5 they leave the settlement, Daenerys having won their hearts.\n\nThe Dothraki also appear with Daenerys in the Bardenas Reales desert of Navarra, representing the Dothraki Sea in Season 6, episodes 1 and 6. At the end of episode 6 she speaks to the Dothraki on top of her dragon, inspiring them to follow her.\n\nIn the city of Cáceres itself, filming took place in Plaza de Santa María, Arco de la Estrella, Torre de Bujaco, Torre de los Púlpitos, Cuesta de la Compañía and the facade of Fundación Mercedes Calles and Carlos Ballestero, situated in Casa Palacio de los Becerra.. Scenes representing Euron Greyjoy’s victory parade in Season 7, episode 3 were shot here.\n\nNearby the scenery of Malpartida de Cáceres, Los Barruecos was used for the battle in which Daenerys defeats Jamie Lannister’s forces and then her dragon burns Randyll and his son Dickon from the House of Tarly.\n\nThe castle of Santa Florentina in Canet de Mar, Barcelona was used in the 6th season, episode 6 to represent Sam’s home, Horn Hill, although only for the interiors, especially the cloister.\n\nAlso in Season 6 the castle of Peñiscola, representing Meeren, is the scenario for the burning of the ships, with filming taking place at Plaza de Santa María, Portal Fosc, Rampa de Felipe II, Paso de Ronda and Parque de Artillería, as well as both the town’s beaches.\n\nIn episode 1 of Season 7 Daenerys arrives with her fleet at Dragonstone, although the church of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, just west of Bermeo, Vizcaya, is barely recognisable with so much CGI. In fact really only the 241 steps are authentic.\n\nAlong the coast is the flysch beach at Itzurun, Zumaia Gipuzkoa, where Jon Snow disembarks to meet Daenerys, although they immediately ascend the steps of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe from there.\n\nIn Vizcaya Muriola beach was the scenario of a mission by Tyrion Bannister and Sir Davos, who come ashore there at what is supposedly Kings’ Landing.\n\nTrujillo in the province of Cáceres was a location, representing Casterly Rock. While the Unsullied are capturing it, Jamie Lannister is at Almodovar del Rio, Córdoba, representing High Garden, sacking, looting and killing Diana Rigg in Season 7, episodes 3 and 4.\n\nIn episode 7 the Unsullied are lined up in front of Kings’ Landing (Trujillo Castle) where they are joined by the Dothraki.\n\nHouse of the Dragon\n\nIn October 2021 filming took place in the main square, castle and some churches in Trujillo, Cáceres, where a dragon statue replaced the usual suspect, Pizarro.\n\nIn Cáceres filming took place in Cuesta de Aldana, and the Plaza de San Jorge (the fights between Sir Cristen Cole and Ser Arryk and between Aegon and Aemond take place there, although the church has been green-screened out and a fountain from the Patio de los Liones in Granada’s Alhambra incongruously built).\n\nSanta María square was the main location for the scenes where Prince Daemon and his new, reformed Watch commit a massacre in episode 1.\n\nCalle Amargura, Cuesta de Aldana and Adarve de Santa Ana also appear.\n\nThe leafy splendour of the Jardins de Santa Clotilde at Lloret de Mar, Girona was also used to represent the gardens of King’s Landing in episode 2. It is here that Lord Corlys discusses the dangers to the realm with Rhaenys Targaryen, the King’s cousin.\n\nLater the King discusses marriage in the garden with his daughter, Rhaenyra Targaryen.\n\nDragonstone, the Targaryen castle appears, as it does in Game of Thrones, as a CGI disfigured San Juan de Gaztelugatxe chapel, Vizcaya, where Rhaenyra and her uncle Daemon face off with their dragons, disputing the ownership of an egg!\n\nThe name Gaztelugatxe means Rock Castle in the Basque language, which may have induced Francis Drake to sack it in 1593, an incident repeated the following year by the Huguenots of La Rochelle, who rather churlishly killed the caretaker.\n\nThe ancestral home of the Targaryen uses the iconic flysch beach of Itzurun in Zumaia, Gipuzkoa.\n\nIn episode 4, King of the Narrow Sea, Rhaenyra and Daemon see a street play, which takes place at the Casa del Sol, a 15th century building in Calle de la Monja, Cáceres.\n\nIn episode 5 the action moves to Lord Corlys’s castle, which is an interesting composite of Saint Michael’s Mount in Cornwall and the castle of Butrón in Viycaya. This medieval castle was completely restored in 1878, giving it its current Bavarian-inspired excesses.\n\nIn episode 6 we move to the castle of La Calahorra in Granada province, representing Pentos where Daemon and Laena Velaryon stay in episode 6. Curiously the castle is transported to some clifftops, faraway from its real inland location. The impressive cloister is used for a banquet, and Daemon’s library was built there as a set.\n\nIn 2020 the local council of La Calahorra erected a series of statues reflecting their long history as a cinema setting. One of these shows the famous Iron Throne. It is located on the path leading up to the castle.\n\nIn season 2 Trujillo features again for the funeral scene in episode 2. Here we can see Plazas San Mateo, Veletas, Santa María and San Jorge, as well as the Arco de la Estrella.\n\nThe Witcher\n\nFilming took place in Gran Canaria of the highly successful TV series The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill, who had previously made The Cold Light of Day on the peninsular. Maspalomas, Cuevas Blancas, Tamadaba, Roque Nublo, Caldera de Tejeda, Fataga, Agaete and Guayedra, were all locations on Gran Canaria, while Garafía, Los Tilos, La Zarza, Cubo de Galga, El Paso and San Andrés y Sauces, were locations on La Palma island.\n\nThe dunes of Maspalomas represent a desert where Yennefer transports Queen Kalis and her child, trying to escape an assassin. The second transportation is to Roque Nublo, and the third to the forests of Caldera de Tejeda. Finally, Yennefer ends up alone on the beach at Guayedra.\n\nThe dry river bed of Fataga is the location along which Jaskier and Geralt travel and Jaskier sings ‘Toss a Coin to you Witcher’.\n\nGarafia represents the location of the magicians’ academy Aretuza, situated in the series at Thanedd (Temeria). The rocks are real but the tower is a CGI creation.\n\nNear Agaete we can find the beach of Guayedra, which is where the Brotherhood comes ashore on its way to the keep at Sodden Hill to confront the army of Nilfgaard.\n\nBrokilon, the forest of death, is an amalgamation of three La Palma forests; Los Tilos, La Zarza and Cubo de la Galga. It is to here that Ciri flees from Cintra. When she drinks the liquid from the tree, she is transported to the dunes of Maspalomas.\n\nAt El Paso we find Los Llanos del Jable, which represent the Dragon Mountains, where the four teams go in search of a green dragon to kill. Llano de las Brujas, the viewpoint at Cumbrecita and Roque de los Muchachos, where the questers set up camp, were all used, although the dragon cave itself was situated in Hungary.\n\nBlack Mirror\n\nGran Canaria’s Caldera de Tejeda provided the final scene of the episode ‘Hated in the Nation’ from Season 3. At the end, like the end of Silence of the Lambs, we see the policewoman following the villain, without his bees to protect him, in what appears to be South America; or somewhere exotic.\n\nEpisode 1 of season 4 is a Star Trek spoof in which USS Callister lands on a planet which is in reality Lanzarote.\n\nThe Playa de Bermeja in Yaiza, with its black sand beaches and the red Montaña Bermeja were used, as was an abandoned quarry called Rofera de Teseguite at Teguise.\n\nOne of Spain’s most filmed petrol stations is the ‘Alfaro,’ on the Autovía A-92 Exit 376 – Tabernas. The restaurant next door, now closed, was used for the Netflix series Black Mirror to represent the Black Museum in episode 6 of season 4. The museum, supposedly located in the Australian desert, was painted black for the occasion.\n\nThe interior however, was filmed in Málaga’s old Provincial Prison at Cruz de Humilladero, now closed and a location for various films.\n\nIn season 5, episode 2, Billy Bauer, the boss of Smithereen, is located, supposedly in Furnace Valley Utah, although his glass home retreat was in reality located in the province of Granada, at Gorafe.\n\nThe desert of Gorafe is not as well known as that of Almería, and perhaps for that reason has conserved its wildness.\n\nWe were lucky to be accompanied by local tourist entrepreneur and film enthusiast Miguel, who drove us around in his 4X4 (totally necessary to visit all the good spots) showing us the locations of films and series.\n\nThe Black Mirror house in fact has two locations, as the house has been moved to a different place since the filming and replaced with a similar glass house.\n\nEnglish speaking Miguel can be contacted via his web site: http://www.geoparkgranada.com/\n\nFor season 6 the Black Mirror team returned to Málaga. Episode 4, Mazey Day was filmed at Marbella, Estepona and an estate between Monda and Ojén, which represented the Cedarwood Retreat. San Pedro Alcántara and the Loasur studios in Coín were also employed.\n\nThe East Sunset Motel, where a paparazzi takes photos of an actor indulging in an illicit rendezvous, was in reality a restaurant called Venta José Carlos C/ Junta de los caminos, Puerto de la Torre, and another restaurant, situated in the nearby mountains was Venta El Túnel. It is here, at the tunnel entrance, that Mazey Day has her car accident.\n\nFor episode 3, Beyond the Sea, about David, an astronaut played by Josh Hartnett, his space age house can be found in La Eliana, Valencia, at calle Dr. Moliner 21. It is currently called Casa Axis and belongs to an artist, Felipe Pantone.\n\nThe house is frequently used by film makers and publicists for its futuristic look, although it was actually built in the 70s.\n\nWestworld\n\nThe film version of course starred Yul Brynner, who made many films in Spain, and the third season includes various Spanish locations.\n\nThe Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias (CAC), in Valencia, which appeared in George Clooney’s Tomorrowland, plays the hi-tech HQ of the Delos corporation, where we see Charlotte Hale (Tessa Thompson) landing by helicopter.\n\nArchitect Ricardo Bofill, who designed the park where the CAC is located, provided his house-studio at Sant Just Desvern (Barcelona), built in an abandoned cement factory. In the series it is Engerraund Serac’s HQ. It’s here that Maeve Millay, actress Thandie Newton, regains consciousness.\n\nIn another episode, The Winter Line, she comes to in an Italian town occupied by the Nazis during World War II, although it is in fact Besalú, (Girona), where part of The Perfume was shot. Plazas Llibertat and Prat de Sant Pere were employed, as was the town’s iconic 12th century bridge.\n\nSilent Witness\n\nWhen Silent Witness, a BBC series, took the action to Afghanistan in 2012, they took a short cut and filmed in Almería.\n\nRambla de Buho and Rambla Roja near Tabernas were used for some desert driving scenes, the airport was the well-known Alfaro petrol station by the A92 car park, while the tarmac road was on the way to the Sierra Alhamilla.\n\nAn Orange Grove was filmed at Cortijo Concejo. The main compound was at La Galera, north of Tabernas.\n\nThe Tenerife village of Güímar has been frequently used for the BBC series Silent Witness, which began in 1996, representing a Mexican border town with the USA. Furthermore, an abandoned leper sanitorium further south at Abades has also been put to good use. Built in 1943, it was never used as such as the illness was brought under control. The Spanish army used it until 2000.\n\nThe Crown\n\nIn season 3 Princess Margaret’s happy days of refuge were filmed at the Playa de los Alemanes at Zahara de los Atunes, Cádiz, representing Mustique in the Caribbean.\n\nNearby, San Roque’s Sotogrande residential area was used for Margaret’s visit to the USA, specifically when she drives along a palm tree lined avenue, supposedly in Los Angeles.\n\nThe emblematic Hotel Alfonso XIII in Sevilla, which appears in Lawrence of Arabia, became California in the 60s for a visit by Princess Margaret, where a party is held in her honour.\n\nHacienda la Pañuela, near Jerez, Cádiz, is the ranch in Arizona owned by the Douglas family, Margaret’s hosts as she awaits a White House invitation from President Johnson.\n\nThe Palacio de Congresos y Exposiciones of Torremolinos, Málaga, somehow transformed itself into San Francisco airport.\n\nWhen the Duke of Edinburgh’s mother has to pawn jewels in Greece, she does so to help finance a convent, represented by the church of Santo Domingo in Jerez, where she is a nun. The streets of San Juan de Aznalfarache, Sevilla, also represent Greece.\n\nThe 18th century naval station of La Carraca at San Fernando is used for the scenes where she goes past soldiers who are holding a coup, on her way to the pawn shop. The same location would be used in season 4 episode 8 when Margaret Thatcher walks to the Queen’s yacht, supposedly at Nassau in The Bahamas, and again in episode 9 as Charles walks towards his Caribbean posting. On both the latter occasions we see the distinctive gate towards which they are walking.\n\nThe library of Cádiz university campus of Puerto Real appears when Queen Elizabeth arrives in Nassau for the Commonwealth meeting in episode 8.\n\nThe Crown was one of many to employ the desert of Almería, this time representing New South Wales during the visit there of Charles and Diana in season 4.\n\nWhen Mark Thatcher gets lost during the Paris-Dakar rally, he is in fact more lost than you’d think, in the Finca Las Lomillas in the Tabernas desert.\n\nWhat’s more, the famous red Ayer’s Rock was also filmed in Almería, with a little CGI magic, specifically in Rambla Búho, representing the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park.\n\nEven more magic converted the Auditorio Cortijo de Torres, Málaga into the Sydney Opera House!\n\nA little less technology was used to construct the ranch in the same rambla, where Charles and Diana are reunited with their baby son William.\n\nUnlike many sets, the ranch has been preserved, although transported to the Oasys western township.\n\nThe producers also managed to create an airport at El Toyo, in a car park next to the Hotel Barceló Cabo de Gata.\n\nIn episode 8 there is a flashback, when Princess Elizabeth gives a 21st birthday address to the Commonwealth from Cape Town.

In fact, the first episode was screened the day after President Kennedy’s assassination.\n\nBut Valencia was not feeling itself, as the futuristic City of Arts and Sciences complex represented Colony world Gliese 581 D, where, according to the BBC’s magazine Radio Times: “architect Santiago Calatrava…..created an opera house like a spaceship; an Imax cinema resembling a giant eye; a science museum that could be an aircraft hangar crossed with a whale skeleton; and the largest aquarium in Europe, with 45,000 living creatures of 500 different species”.\n\nIn 2019 filming also took place in Tenerife for the 12th season of the British TV series Doctor Who.\n\nFilming took place in a pine forest near the Teide mountain and in the Auditorium de Santa Cruz.\n\nKill the Moon was the title of the 7th episode of the 8th season filmed on Lanzarote, near the Volcán del Cuervo, in the Parque Nacional de Timanfaya.\n\nPlanet of Fire was shot at the jetty at Órzola, also on Lanzarote, this time playing itself, where Howard discusses Peri’s future with her and the Doctor looks over the treasure found underwater.\n\nAt the Mirador del Rio, Timanov and Malkon speak about the unbelievers. This old gun battery was converted into a restaurant by Cesar Manrique. Filming also took place at the Papagayo beach, where Peri is brought ashore after a swimming accident.\n\nWhen Jodie Whittaker took over from Capaldi some filming took place in Granada province, specifically around Aldeire, Alquife, and La Calahorra. This was episode 6 of Season 11 and Granada represented the Punjab in an episode entitled Demons of the Punjab, with the snowy peaks of Sierra Nevada once again standing in for The Himalayas.\n\nThe episode The Two Doctors, screened in 1985, was filmed all over Sevilla.\n\nLocations included La Finca La Caprichosa, the River Guadiamar, Plaza del Triunfo, Calle Joaquin Romero Murube, Calle Rodrigo Caro, Plaza de la Alianza and Plaza Doña Elvira among others.\n\nThe 2012 episode A Town Called Mercy made use of both the Oasys and Fort Bravo western township parks in Almería.\n\nWhile filming in Almería, the production team slipped next door to the Sierra Nevada mountain’s, the peninsula’s highest, to shoot the snow scenes for the episode Asylum of the Daleks.\n\nBerlin Station\n\nThe Canary island La Palma features in the TV series Berlin Station, representing Panama.\n\nWhen Meyer enters the Panamanian jungle in the first episode looking for a box, he is in fact at Los Tilos, with its spectacular waterfall.\n\nLater, scenes in a typical Panamanian street market were filmed in Avenida El Puente de Santa Cruz.\n\nSome beach bar scenes were shot at Playa de la Bombilla at Tazacorte.\n\nFuerteventura also appears in the series specifically at Hotel Oliva Beach and Finca Cervantes at Lajares.\n\nWhite Lines\n\nThe TV series White Lines is the story of a DJ called Axel, whose death is investigated by his sister Zoe.\n\nBut first we go to Almería, where Axel’s body is unearthed after a storm, and Zoe talks to the police at the Fort Bravo western theme park at Tabernas.\n\nA lot of the filming was done on Mallorca, including the scene in the first episode when Marcus meets a mafia boss in Bar Restaurant Illeta, located at Camp De Mar beach near Andratx. Marcus’s villa is in reality Can Pirata at Cala D’Or.\n\nThe orgy scene in the first episode was filmed at S’Estaca, a villa that had belonged to actor Michael Douglas.\n\nThe Calafat finca was Son Oliver, a villa in the Coanegra Valley near Santa Maria del Camí, although scenes from the villa’s chapel (where the dog’s funeral is held) and courtyard were actually filmed at the Biniagual vineyard at Binissalem.\n\nThe Calafat foundation’s residential home, where Conchita Calafat tries to enlist the support of a priest for her plans, is El Rafal dels Porcs at Es Llombards.\n\nFrom Almería, Zoe takes a ferry to Ibiza and gives us a good view of the capital with its castle and harbour seen both from below and above. Most of the film’s flashbacks are of Ibiza in the 90s, including Axel’s favourite spot, the watchtower Torre d’en Rovira at Sant Josep de sa Talaia with views of the islands of Des Bosc and Sa Conillera. It is here that Kika takes Zoe to talk about her relationship with Axel.
