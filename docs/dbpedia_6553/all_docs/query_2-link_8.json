        "text": "Journey to Italy, in 1954, reunited him with Ingrid Bergman. This Roberto Rossellini film was made during Bergman's ostracism from the U.S. following her affair and pregnancy with Rossellini. Miss Bergman was 5'9-1/2” and as a result had to be carefully matched with her leading men (she can often be seen in flat or low-heeled shoes in her movies), but there were no worries with Sanders, who stood 6'3-1/2.” They look quite tall together here! He was miserable throughout the filming due to Rossellini's languid style of working.\n\nRare is the man who can say he worked with Bette Davis, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Lucille Ball, Elizabeth Taylor, Ethel Merman AND Esther Williams, but Sanders did! In the Roman warfare/aquatic adventure conglomeration Jupiter's Darling, Sanders played the Roman dictator Fabius Maximus, the man who is supposed to be wed to Williams before the handsome and daring Hannibal (played by Howard Keel) comes barrelling in with his army of elephants. Sanders recorded and filmed a song for the musical, but it was cut out before general release. Next came a triad of period films starting with Moonfleet with Stewart Granger, then The Scarlet Coat with Cornel Wilde and Michael Wilding, followed by The King's Thief. Here, he played King Charles II again (as he had in Forever Amber) opposite Edmund Purdom, Ann Blyth and David Niven. Dig the gaggle of little dogs he has surrounding him in this shot to the right!\n\nAfter some less-glamorous films such as Never Say Goodbye (with Rock Hudson), While the City Sleeps (with Dana Andrews and Rhonda Fleming) and That Certain Feeling (a departure for him in that this was a Bob Hope comedy with Eva Marie Saint also on board), he reverted to tuxedoed splendor for Death of a Scoundrel. This film was a semi-family affair due to the fact that his ex-wife Zsa Zsa was one of the featured females (another being Yvonne De Carlo) and his brother Tom Conway was cast for the second (and last) time as his character's brother. In time, Conway's alcoholism would lead to an estrangement between the men and ultimately lead to Conway's death from cirrhosis in 1967.\n\nSanders hosted a television program in 1957 called The George Sanders Mystery Theater, but he only appeared in one (or two, depending on the source) of the episodes. He typically introduced them only. That same year, he took part in the small-scale MGM remake of Garbo's The Painted Veil, this time called The Seventh Sin. He played a heavy-drinking expatriate living in Hong Kong, who befriends Eleanor Parker, there with her estranged doctor husband Bill Travers. As was often the case, he gave one of the film's more interesting performances (if not the most interesting.)\n\nSanders got to work with Sophia Loren in 1959's That Kind of Woman. The film had him playing a millionaire who basically buys her for himself, with Keenan Wynn and her friend Barbara Nichols accompanying her on a train, though she quickly falls for soldier Tab Hunter (and no, I am not making up this cast!) He was supposed to reunite with Tyrone Power on his next film, Solomon and Sheba, but Power died during the filming, replaced with Yul Brynner. You can see George's height again coming into play here as he dwarfs the 5'10” Brynner. Sheba was played by curvaceous Gina Lollobrigida, giving Sanders the opportunity to work with both major Italian bombshells in one year. Sanders married for the third time in 1959 to Benita Hume, the actress widow of Ronald Colman, who had died the year before. Far from slowing down, though, he had four films released in 1960. The Last Voyage cast him as Captain of a luxury liner that suffers an explosion and begins sinking (all the while with Dorothy Malone trapped under some fallen wreckage as Robert Stack tries in desperation to free her before she drowns.) Some felt Sanders seemed to walk through his part. He was accused of doing it even more so in Bluebeard's Ten Honeymoons, playing a much married man killing off his wives one after the other.\n\nSomehow, he found time to write a book during all this called Memoirs of a Professional Cad that was praised for its witty prose. (He had been credited with two books in the 1940s during his Saint/Falcon days, but both were ghost-written with his name attached for publicity and sales' sake.)\n\nHe had a supporting part in Trouble in the Sky, about the investigation into a pair of airline crashes, that starred Michael Craig. His most enduring film from this period was the now-cult horror flick Village of the Damned, in which he and his wife Barbara Shelley are aghast to discover that their blonde, albino-like son, is one of several children born at the same time who wreak havoc on the community. This was actually a film intended for Ronald Coleman, but Sanders took over the part when he died.\n\nSanders, who never had many illusions about acting, claiming the biggest goal of his life was to retire, began appearing in some lackluster movies. Operation Snatch, was not quite as dirty as it may sound, actually having to do with the obtaining of a gorilla in order to keep the apes of Gibraltar in good stead. Similarly, The Cracksman had to do with a locksmith coerced into helping a burglar and The Golden Head was about thieves who took a bust of Saint Laszlo. (These could almost be mistaken for porn titles!)\n\nThe Disney adventure classic In Search of The Castaways and Blake Edwards' very amusing comedy A Shot in the Dark (officially a sequel to The Pink Panther, but actually shot first!) were better-known works from this time frame. He also appeared with Kim Novak in 1965's The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders.\n\nThe hit, camp TV series Batman came calling in 1966 and he played Mr. Freeze, a role later undertaken by Otto Preminger and Eli Wallach. Sanders' ex Zsa Zsa Gabor also essayed a villainous role on the series with a character called Minerva.\n\nAfter filming the spy movie The Quiller Memorandum with George Segal and Senta Berger, Sanders played four roles in the far-out comedy Good Times, which starred Sonny & Cher!! I'm telling you, this man worked with almost everyone. This was followed by the animated Disney film The Jungle Book, which made good use of Sanders' inimitable voice as he played the fierce Shere Kahn the Tiger. Another of his notable projects was taking on the old Clifton Webb role in a TV rendition of Laura, this time with Robert Stack, Farley Granger, Miss Arlene Francis and, in the title role, a stiff Lee Radziwill (Jackie Kennedy's sister) in her screen acting debut and simultaneous swan song.\n\nSanders soon relocated to Majorca, Spain, where he had long owned a beautiful home. Several low-budget productions followed, surely done solely for the money, though he was enlisted as part of the cast of John Huston's spy drama The Kremlin Letter. Fans got quite a shock when Sanders, who must have felt by this time that he'd done virtually everything else, appeared in his first scene in full-on drag. (And it's a wonder Hermione Gingold didn't sue!) He was shown playing piano in a San Francisco gay bar, then recruited to use his gay sensibilities to get cozy with a Soviet suspect as part of the mission at hand. His character knitted and was shown admiring the bare behind of a male statue. This was quite a departure for the legendary ladies man. His wife Hume had died of bone cancer the year before (something he used as an excuse to depart from the impending Broadway musical Sherry! with Miss Dolores Gray and based on The Man Who Came to Dinner, though in truth he was feeling insecure about doing it in the first place.) He began to display a loss of balance and a general sense of complete boredom with his work and in his life. He was quoted as having said, “Acting is like roller-skating. Once you know how to do it, it is neither stimulating nor exciting.” In a bizarre move (and primarily because Zsa Zsa wouldn't remarry him), he proposed to Zsa Zsa's sister Magda Gabor and she accepted! The spur of the moment marriage lasted a mere six weeks, but it put him in the trivia books for having married two out of the three Gabor sisters.\n\nHe costarred in the Agatha Christie mystery Endless Night in 1972 with Hayley Mills and Britt Ekland, still as nattily dressed and aristocratic as ever, but perhaps should have made this his last appearance. At age sixty-five (young by today's standards!), with his health having faltered, a stroke having affected his movement and speech (and work), he grew depressed. He couldn't stand the thought of becoming infirm, nor of being reliant upon someone for help. Unable to properly play his beloved grand piano, he pushed it out of the house and promptly took an axe to it. He then, under the advisement of his current (and much younger) girlfriend, sold his Spanish house and began to aimlessly stay here and there.\n\nOn April 23rd, 1972, he checked into a hotel in a coastal town not far from Barcelona, Spain where he swallowed five bottles of Nembutal. He was discovered two days later with a note that said, “Dear World, I am leaving because I am bored. I feel I have lived long enough. I am leaving you with your worries in this sweet cesspool. Good luck.” The screen's ultimate cynic had left behind an appropriately cynical farewell. He had been talking about committing suicide in his sixties ever since he was a young man! The man whose stated goal was to retire, actually worked up until practically the very end. (He didn't even stick around until December when The Poseidon Adventure was released. It might have changed his mind!)"
