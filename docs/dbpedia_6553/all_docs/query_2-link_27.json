Everyone will regret not finding notice of a particular something which to him revealed the integrity and warmth, or the wit, or the talent, or the courage, or the staying power, or the canni- ness, or the wide diversity of interest of this remarkable man. 'There has never been a chief who had a closer rapport with more of his people than Allen Dulles; each of us treasures his special encounters and favorite stories. One thinks back to those moments of unwelcome news and the \"Great Scot!\" sentence that indicated an instant awareness of its por- tent and presaged the call to speedy action; or those other times- moments to be dreaded-that opened with an ominous \"See here.\" One remembers with an inner smile his end of the unavoidably-over- heard telephone talks, when he fell into transparent double talk, which one could not help but translate almost as fast as he spun it out. One can never forget the times of gaiety often hilarity, nor the flashes of anger which usually cooled as fast as they exploded. One thinks back to those late afternoon sessions-seven o'clock- when our Director had already worked a twelve hour day at full throttle. The task would be the clearing of a difficult paper on a com- plicated substantive issue. There would be a pause as he shifted his mind from what to do about Antarctica or a clandestine operation of which he was self-appointed senior case officer. \"Allll right,\" he would say, \"now let's look at your paper.\" Spectacles pushed up the fore- head to the front hair, he would read, puzzle silently, reread., and then challenge. Unsatisfied he would draft something and ask \"How about this?\" And the \"this\" would reveal a man, thoughtful, knowl- edgeable, and sharp at the end of a day that would have numbed people twenty years his junior. \"What's the matter with getting exhausted,\" he once replied to a lieutenant who had observed uncomplainingly that he found a certain assigned task more onerous than all his other duties. The trouble with this story is that Allen Dulles gave the impression of not knowing what exhaustion was.

CIA MEETS THE PRESS Rush V. Greenslade Long before the growth race between the US and the USSR be- came news, a Soviet propaganda theme, and a presidential campaign issue, CIA had organized a large-scale research effort on the econ- omy of the USSR. This effort was started about 1950 in the Office of Research and Reports, the predecessor of the Office of Economic Research. The research developed in the CIA as a result of the unavailability of reliable information from open sources. Prior to the death of Stalin, officially released Soviet economic statistics were fragmentary, ambiguous, and unusable for analysis or policy support. Academic research on Soviet economic growth was under way but, hampered by the lack of open data, it was many years from fruition. CIA studied production in various sectors in great detail and con- structed independent measures for agricultural production, indus- trial production, and gross national product (GNP). The effort was a great deal larger than private groups could undertake and it bene- fitted by access to classified information unobtainable outside. The results were much timelier than academic efforts even after the USSR began releasing voluminous. statistics in 1956. Soviet aggregative sta- tistics, even though more prompt and more numerous than before, still suffered from biases and a non-comparability with statistics of Western countries. Economic intelligence research acquired new importance in the mid-1950's when Khrushchev challenged the US to a growth race. This peaceful competition was to take the place of the cold war and would establish the superiority of one of the two economic sys- tems-capitalism or socialism. During the late 1950's and early 1960's, Khrushchev inaugurated a succession of campaigns for catching up with US economic performance. The Soviets were \"catching up with the US\" in meat and milk production, in steel production, and in industrial production. These several campaigns were accompanied by a barrage of statistics purporting to show progress in various fields, faster growth on the part of USSR than the US, and a closing of the gap between the USSR and the US. Appr0Q~ tRl ea'se 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010606-6 MORI/HRP PAGES 3-10 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 CONFIDENTIAL The Press Through 1960 Soviet economic growth was impressive while that of the US was a little sluggish. Aided by the grain production from the \"new lands,\" Soviet statistical performance compared favorably with that of the US, and the achievements of Soviet science in space made the statistics appear even more impressive and plausible. CIA estimates showed the growth rate of Soviet GNP to be about twice that of the US. For industrial growth the ratio was even more unfa- vorable to the US: in 1956-1960, 81/2 percent in the USSR against 21/2 percent in the US. The most thorough and respected academic es- timate, that of Professor Abram Bergson of Harvard, was very close to CIA estimates for the 1950's. Bergson calculated the average annual rate of growth of GNP from 1950 to 1958 was 6.8 percent. CIA's estimate was 6.5 percent. Soviet Slowdown in the 1960's By the end of 1962 the rapid growth of the USSR relative to that of the US was widely known. CIA estimates had been publicized by the Director of Central Intelligence (Allen W. Dulles) in open testimony before the joint Economic Committee of Congress in No- vember 1959. This testimony was reported in the press and was printed in its entirety in a Congressional document. Mr. Dulles made another public speech in December 1959 before the National Associa- tion of Manufacturers repeating the same message. This also was widely reported in the press. However, for the following two years, 1961 and 1962, CIA estimates indicated a slowdown in growth. These , stimates had not yet been made public. Suddenly, in August of 1963, the Soviet government began negotiating with Canada for a massive purchase of wheat. It soon became known that the USSR had suf- fered a severe drought and crop failure and did not have sufficient grain reserves to feed its population. The USSR contracted with Canada and the US for the surprising total of 11 million tons of wheat for delivery in 1963 and 1964 to be paid for by sales of gold. At the request of the Director of Central Intelligence (John A. McCone), ORR prepared an assessment of the Soviet economy. This was incorporated into a briefing given by the DCI to President John- son and the National Security Council in December 1963. The high- lights of the economic portion of the briefing were: 9. Growth of Soviet GNP in 1963 would be about 1% percent. 2. Growth in 1962 had already slowed, so the average of the two years was only 2% percent, drastically lower than the previous rates of 5 and 6 percent. Api*oved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T0MAMWf6 10006-6 ApproTil l Pmrs#Zelease 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03196W 111 06-6 3. Agriculture accounted for a large part of the slowdown in both 1962 and 1963 but not all of it. Industrial growth had also slowed noticeably since 1958. 4. In trying to raise meat production, Khrushchev had prodigally used up his surplus grain production of the preceding years, 1958-1961, and had much smaller grain reserves than CIA had previously estimated. 5. The slowdown in industry was in large part the result of competition of defense for scarce investment and R&D resources. 6. Gold production and stocks were significantly lower than current public estimates. 7. The Soviet campaign to obtain long term credits from Western Europe for the purchase of advanced Western equipment was a natural consequence of its dwindling gold stocks. The President was very interested in this assessment of the Soviet economy and suggested that it be made available to the public. How this was to be done was apparently left up to the Director. The Press Conference The objectives in releasing the story were fairly straightforward. After years of hearing that the USSR was rapidly and inexorably catching up with the US, the American public would surely be glad to hear that this was no longer true, at least temporarily. Secondly, the reported developments supported the US policy of discouraging the extension of long-term credits to the USSR. Thirdly, the report could be declassified without affecting its substance. In addition to releasing the story, however, the Agency decided to permit reference to itself as the source. This was uncommon but not unprecedented. In The New York Times of 23 June 1960, page 36, an article by Harry Schwartz had reported on some estimates prepared by CIA, for a Congressional committee. The headline had read: \"CIA Forecasts Soviet Output Will Grow 80 percent in Next Decade.\" The object of allowing attribution to the Agency in 1964 was simply to get the story on page one, if possible, rather than on page forty-one. In short, the Agency had a good story to tell and wanted. to be sure it was heard. The main points in the Director's briefing appeared on 29 Decem- ber 1963 in an article by Charles Bartlett on an inside page in the Washington Star. This. article featured the limited Soviet gold stock and production, and the need for import credits. This was the first time the CIA gold estimates had been made public. In the body of the article the CIA was named as the source of the information in CONFIDENTIAL 5 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Appr8 CF&r [ease 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A9RR31QS10006-6 the article. On 5 January 1964 a similar article appeared in The New York Herald Tribune by Tom Lambert, datelined Washington. He attributed his information to \"intelligence analysts here.\" These two articles caused no particular stir. However, on 8 Janu- ary 1964 an article by Edwin L. Dale, Jr. appeared on the front page of The New York Times under the headline, \"Sharp Slowdown in Soviet Growth Reported by CIA.\" The article reported the CIA analysis at length and also discussed CIA's responsibility for re- search on the Soviet economy. Dale had received no special favor or dispensation and his article said nothing essential that was not in the previous articles. But somehow it caused a furore. Front page, The New York Times, with attribution! The Washington press corps raised an immediate clamor for equal briefing. In response to this demand the Agency scheduled its first press conference for the following day, at CIA headquarters. Twenty re- porters attended. The conference was conducted by the Deputy Di- rector for Intelligence, Ray Cline. A press release, entitled \"Soviet Economic Problems Multiply,\" was passed out. But by this time So- viet economic problems were no longer news. The first question asked by a reporter was, \"Why? Why this public apparition, this naked materialization of CIA?\" The DDI replied: \"Well, we thought we had a good story, so ...:' Twenty eager faces radiated frank and open disbelief. The press conference made headlines all around the world. How- ever, the message of Soviet economic slowdown was subordinated to speculation about CIA's motives in seeking the publicity. The most frequently cited motives were (1) a supposed CIA-State Depart- ment conflict over European long-term credits for the USSR-CIA opposing, the State Department approving; and (2) an alleged at- tempt to rebuild CIA's public reputation after the Bay of Pigs epi- sode. The CIA-State Department rivalry hypothesis was illustrated by the famous Herblock cartoon in The Washington Post which showed a black cloaked figure offering to peddle some \"hot statistics\" to a foreign service officer on the steps of the State Department building. The Reaction The CIA analysis and estimates met with a mixed reaction in the US press, among the academic specialists on the Soviet economy, 6 CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 ApprTc e8lP r Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T034ZQ1 fflMf64K)006-6 and in foreign countries. In the US many commentators accepted the CIA position, but a substantial number reserved judgment pend- ing further information, and a small number openly disagreed. On 9 January, the day after the first Times article by Dale, Harry Schwartz, who was the Times' Soviet economic expert, published the results of a telephone survey of academic experts. All five who were can- vassed were surprised by the CIA's conclusions about rates of growth. One said, \"It is impossible.\" Another said, \"Fantastic.\" On the other hand, Professor Abram Bergson, whose own calculations of Soviet GNP growth up to 1958 were the most widely accepted of all esti- mates, said, \"I am a little surprised but I can't rule it out.\" It was hard, as Schwartz pointed out, to understand how Soviet growth could plunge from 6 or 7 percent a year to 2% percent. The explanation was primarily the decline in agricultural production for two succes- sive years, a development not yet known to the academic specialists.' The British press was generally doubtful of the accuracy of the esti- mates of growth and of gold stocks. In particular, the London Econo- mist thought that the proper estimate of the growth rate should be around 5 percent instead of 2% percent. However, most British com- mentators agreed that Soviet growth had slowed noticeably. The Brit- ish press unanimously interpreted the CIA action as an attempt to support the US policy of opposing the granting of long-term credits to the USSR, something the British Board of Trade was eager to do. The British, unlike some of the American press, knew that this was also US administration and State Department policy and not just CIA's policy. Schwartz's later analysis of the American reaction is interesting. The following quote is from his book, The Soviet Economy Since Stalin, Lippincott, 1965. pp. 33-34. \"The depth of this concern [with the rapid Soviet growth relative to that of the US] became strikingly clear in early 1964. The CIA-from which Mr. Dulles had retired-made public its calculations for 1962 and 1963, which showed that Soviet economic growth had slowed down dramatically, to less than 2.5 percent annually. It added that the gap separating American and Soviet production levels was once again widening so that Moscow's prospects for victory in the economic competition during the foreseeable future had dimmed substantially. A naive observer might have thought that a wave of joy would have swept the United States at this good news. The :reality was the reverse, however, and numerous American voices were quickly raised to criticize the CIA and its new estimates. Having finally been con- vinced that there was such a thing as a Soviet economic threat, many Ameri- cans seemed reluctant to believe that even temporarily Moscow had received a setback and Washington was doing comparatively well.\" CONFIDENTIAL 7 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Appr~ B llXese 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A0930~010006-6 e ress The. CIA press release took the Russians very much by surprise, appearing as it did even before the official Soviet announcement on the economic results for 1963. When these appeared later in Janu- ary, the usual percentage increase in national income was absent. All that was given was a figure of 5 percent growth in gross social product. Gross social product is a heavily double-counted statistic summing the outputs of all sectors of the economy without netting out the intermediate sales from one producing sector to another. In several letters to US newspapers, Soviet writers denounced CIA on a variety of grounds but could find no answer to the 21/a percent GNP growth rate except to cite the announced 5 percent growth in gross social product. When the statistical handbook, Narodnoye Kho- ziaistvo, SSSR v godu 1963, was finally released in early 1965-sev- eral months late-it showed the growth of national income (Soviet definition) to be 31/2 percent for 1963, and a 4.2 percent average for the two years, 1962 and 1963, compared to an average of 7% per- cent for 1959-1961. National income (Soviet definition) excludes most services, which grow slowly, and hence systematically increases faster than national income or product by Western definition. In the light of that bias the Soviet announcement came closer to supporting the CIA estimates than the Soviet economists' (or the London Economist's) estimate of 5 percent. The reaction of Eastern European countries was the most interest- ing of all. As reported in a New York Herald Tribune dispatch of 10 February 1964, satellite officials accepted the CIA estimates and were using them to oppose Soviet policies, such as economic integra- tion through CEMA, and to support their own hopes for increased policy independence. In Canuary and February 1964, the Director and his deputy for in- telligence visited the major capitals of Western Europe, briefing the NATO governments on the Soviet economic and military positions. A representative of ORR accompanied them to brief economic special- ists in the governments on the methodology and data underlying the economic estimates. All except the British Board of Trade were persuaded that the CIA estimates were generally valid. The validity of CIA's analysis became generally acknowledged in the US press after the official Soviet report on economic performance 8 CONFIDENTIAL Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 The Press CONFIDENTIAL in the first half of 1964. Harry Schwartz of The New York Times, a former skeptic, wrote a Times story in July 1964 with the following headlines: \"Soviet Economy Seen Stumbling-Growth in Industrial Output During First Half of 1964 Falls Short of Hopes-Bright Spots are Few.\" The US academic community was brought around by the appear- ance of carefully explained calculations of Soviet GNP by Dr. Stanley Cohn, of Research Analysis Corporation. Although his estimated growth rates were not identical with those of CIA, they were reason- ably close, and his methods and procedures were essentially the same as the Agency's. Cohn's analyses appeared in successive volumes of studies on the Soviet economy published by the joint Economic Com- mittee. The latest revision of Cohn's estimates shows 4.5 percent growth in 1962 and 2.7 percent in 1963 for an average of 3.6 percent. The CIA gold estimate, which rested on highly classified data, was accepted and published by the US Bureau of Mines in 1964. In due time it was also accepted by the joint Intelligence Board in London and by the banking community in London. An Endorsement from Siberia The most unexpected support for CIA's economic estimates came from a prominent young Soviet economist, Dr. Abel Gezevish Agan- begyan, who is the head of the Laboratory of Economic-Mathemati- cal Methods in Novosibirsk, and a corresponding member of the So- viet Academy of Sciences. He was one of a large number of econ- omists who were urging radical economic reform on the Soviet leader- ship prior to 1965. In December 1964, he delivered a private lecture in Moscow, reportedly to the Central Committee, and again in June 1965 to the staff of a publishing house in Moscow. Notes taken by someone present at the latter lecture leaked to the press in England and Italy, and also were acquired by the American Embassy in Mos- cow.

The Director was earnestly advised to get CIA out of the news and keep it out. Two years later, in October 1965, after the poor Russian harvest of 1965, the CIA again prepared a press release on Soviet growth, repeating estimates for preceding years and estimating growth of GNP in 1965 at 3 percent. This time the State Department issued the release. It was described as \"prepared by the Department of State in consultation with other interested agencies.\" The report of this release did not make the front page of The New York Times.

ON THE TRAIL OF HEN HOUSE AND HEN ROOST Donald C. Brown The last successful U-2 mission over Soviet territory in April 1960 obtained photographs of a very large research and development cen- ter at Sary Shagan, on the shores of Lake Balkhash.1 It had been sus- pected for some time that research on antiballistic missiles (ABM) was conducted at Sary Shagan, but few who saw those first reconnais- sance photos were prepared for the huge size of the program evi- denced by dozens of separate facilities spread over an area approx- imately the size of the state of New Jersey. Two of the more arresting objects observed in the 1960 photo- graphs were large radars which came to have the intelligence nick- names of Hen House and Hen Roost. Both of these radars were lo- cated on the western shore of Lake Balkhash, and they looked out over the rest of the Sary Shagan complex toward Kapustin Yar, the launching point for ballistic missiles which served as targets for what- ever ABM tests the Soviets were conducting. Both the Hen House and Hen Roost were fixed installations of staggering size. The Hen House antenna building was more than 900 feet long-three times the length of a football field-and nearly 50 feet high. The Hen Roost had two antennas, each over 500 feet long, separated by over half a mile. The southernmost of the two Hen Roost antennas was very low to the ground-only 15 feet high- but the northern antenna rose 65 feet high. The fixed nature of the antennas for the Hen House and Hen Roost meant that the direction of their beams of radar energy could not be steered or altered by simply moving the antennas. It was ob- vious that these radars, if they were not to be confined to looking in a single fixed direction, would have to employ some means of elec- The last U-2 reconnaissance mission in that program was that of Francis Gary Powers, who was brought down over Sverdlovsk in May 1960.

Electronically steered antennas were just being developed in the US at that time, and the presence of two apparently operational radars of this type at the Soviet ABM center whetted the appetite of the intelligence commu- nity to know more about the Hen House and Hen Roost. During the next two and a half years, little information became available beyond that obtained from the 1960 photography, but both radars continued to be subjects of considerable speculation. Those early estimates are best passed over here, mostly because they were wrong, however much they illustrate the severe limitations of analysis based on only one source of information. What was needed for the beginning of a useful analysis of either radar was knowledge of its signal. The first break in the Hen House-Hen Roost story came in late 1962. The Soviets had resumed atmospheric testing of nuclear weap- ons, and some of their tests involved missile-borne weapons which were detonated as they approached the ABM test center. Besides the directly destructive effects of a nuclear burst, it releases enormous amounts of energy which can cause radical changes in the radio trans- mission properties of the surrounding atmosphere. Radar waves, which ordinarily would be propagated in essentially straight paths into space, can be reflected or beift to different directions in the highly ionized region created by a nuclear burst. On 28 October 1962 one of the ABM-related nuclear tests near Sary Shagan created propaga- tion disturbances which caused many otherwise undetectable signals to be reflected to US ELINT stations in the Middle East. Thirteen new signals were recorded and many of these were thought to have originated at Sary Shagan. The signal which excited the most immediate interest was one designated BUEB (its designation has varied with the years, and currently is B357Z). BUEB had a very low pulsing rate of about 100 pulses per second, which suggested that it was intended to operate against targets at ranges greater than 800 miles. Since even the high- est flying aircraft are well below the horizon when they are between 300 and 400 miles from a radar, BUEB became an instant candidate for the signal of an ABM radar. Ballistic missiles, because they rise several hundred miles above the earth, can be visible at several times the normal range for aircraft and most other objects. In addition, missiles approach their intended target so rapidly that it is desirable Applgved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A00 D006-6 Approved odRIgaasiee 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A0003SpEU?a ?06-6 ovie to detect them at as great a range as possible. BUEB used very long pulses which could provide the energy necessary for such long range detection. Most interesting of all, however, was the observation that each pulse of this signal was transmitted at a different frequency. More- over, as the frequency changed, the direction of the transmissions also appeared to change. This effect-beam steering by changes in transmitted frequency-is one type of electronic steering, exactly what was expected from the Hen House or Hen Roost. BUEB was therefore a prime candidate as the signal from one-but only one-of them. For the next couple of years a very strange argument, important for the answer sought, but rather pointless for the chances of finding it, developed within the community over which radar, Hen House or Hen Roost, was the source of the BUEB signal. By early 1964, a group of radio scientists from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), under the leadership of Jim Trexler, had succeeded in detecting BUEB transmissions after they were reflected from the moon.' These moon-bounce intercepts confirmed that the signal was indeed from a frequency-steered radar and provided considerable detail on. signal characteristics. They even determined that the source of the signal was at Sary Shagan, which had been only an informed assumption in the analysis of the 1962 intercepts, but there was still not enough in- formation to say which radar was the source. So the battle raged on. Despite the lack of firm evidence one way or the other, strong ad- vocates for each radar nevertheless emerged. Emotional, numerologi- cal, and prescient arguments filled the evidential void. Since the ra- dars were only three miles apart, were presumed to operate in much the same way for, the same basic purpose, and were pointed in much the same direction, identifying the origin of BUEB was not an easy task. Nor was the question merely an academic one. By 1964 reports had been received that Hen House radars were being operationally deployed at several locations in the Soviet Union. There was no cor- responding evidence of Hen Roost deployment. If BUEB came from the Hen House, there was an opportunity, rare in the ABM busi- ness, of having an intelligence lead well before a system was com- ' See \"Moon Bounce Elint,\" Studies XI 2, p. 59.

On the other hand, if the signal was from Hen Roost, then we were in trouble, because in that case we would not have the slightest idea how Hen House worked. The resolution to that controversy came in early 1965 when an ex- ternal contractor, ESL, Inc., working with some carefully documented measurements made by Jim Trexler's moon-bounce intercept pro- gram, proved with mathematical rigor that BUEB came from Hen House. After a decent interval for the Hen Roost aficionados to re- cover, this answer was generally accepted, and Hen Roost began to slip into obscurity. The conclusion at the time was that the two radars had been in direct competition for the same job, that Hen House had won the competition, and that we were unlikely to see any more of Hen Roost. This conclusion was bolstered by the fact that Hen House was being deployed, and by a television film made in 1965 by the Soviets to celebrate their military might twenty years after the defeat of Nazi Germany, which featured some close-up shots of the northern antenna of the Hen Roost. Since the Soviets seldom tip their hand on advanced military technology, this revelation of structural details of the Hen Roost was taken as strong evidence that they, too, had given up on that radar. During the same era that the Hen House-Hen Roost competition was being waged in the intelligence offices of the US, and presumably also on the sands of Sary Shagan, another significant radar develop- ment was taking place in the Moscow area. In 1964, a very large A-frame structure began rising above the trees near Naro Fominsk, 35 miles southwest of Moscow. This structure, nicknamed the Dog House, had all the earmarks of yet another electronically steered ABM radar. The two flat faces supported by the A-frame were es- sentially square and over 350 feet on a side. One face, pointed prac- tically down the middle of the US ICBM threat corridor to Moscow, provided convincing evidence of an ABM function. The ABM util- ity of the opposite face, which points southeast toward the Indian Ocean, is somewhat obscure, but interest in Dog House among ABM analysts was-and remains-high. By late 1967 the northwest face of the Dog House A-frame was completed, and in the summer of 1968 those stalwarts of Hen House signal collection, the NRL group, succeeded once again in pulling in a new signal by lunar reflections. The signal was quickly identified as being a transmission from the Dog House, but it was a most App14ved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A00c 1T0006-6 e a es 005/04/18 :CIA-RDP78T03194A000 PE~ q~oo6-6 Approo vet FRgfi 'hacp peculiar signal indeed. Like Hen House, Dog House changes its transmitted frequency to effect beam steering. Quite unlike Hen House or any other large Soviet radar ever observed, however, Dog House uses a signal which is continuously on (continuous wave sig- nal, or cw), and is not transmitted in short pulses. The Dog :House signal is constantly changing frequency and beam pointing direction, so it is perfectly feasible for the radar to make simultaneous range and angle measurements without the ambiguities usually associated with cw signals. Nevertheless, most radar analysts were rather taken, aback at the bizarre appearance of the Dog House signal when it was first identified. Subsequent reports have revealed that there is more to the Dog House system than the A-frame. More than a mile to the southwest of the A-frame are additional long, low structures which are probably the actual transmitting antennas. The A-frame antenna is now believed to be for receiving only. Such a two-antenna system makes a cw signal more explicable. Conventional pulsed radars require only one anten- na, which is used alternately for both transmitting and receiving. After a pulse is transmitted, the antenna is switched to the radar receiver for the detection of target echoes, then switched back to the transmitter during the brief time required to transmit the next pulse. Such a sharing of functions cannot be achieved with a cw radar like Dog House. Since the transmitter is operating all of the time, a separate antenna must be provided for the receiver. There are additional problems with cw operation, among them a require- ment to prevent transmitted energy from masking very weak target echoes in the receiver. One way to achieve this isolation of trans- mitter from receiver is to, provide a large physical separation between the two antennas. For the Dog House, they are more than a mile apart. One puzzling aspect of the Dog House had been the lack of an identified prototype. Because of the vast physical size of the radar and its obviously great cost, it was reasonable for the first full-scale version of the Dog House to be placed where it would have some operational use. The Soviets, however, are great prototype builders and thorough testers of new equipment (the research and develop- ment Hen House is still in operation, nearly nine years after it was first spotted) and they probably would not use all of the unconven- SECRET 15 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 SECRET Soviet ABM Radars tional technology evident in the Dog House without some sort of de- velopmental testing outside the laboratory. After the initial shock of the Dog House signal had worn off, it occurred to some of us that a necessary feature of that radar's op- eration-the use of two separated antennas-had also been a promi- nent feature of our old friend, Hen Roost. Hen Roost did not have even a passing physical resemblance to Dog House, but it did have two antennas. While there are sometimes reasons to use separate transmitting and receiving antennas with a pulse radar, there must have been some compelling reason for the 3,800-foot separation of the Hen Roost antennas. Could it, too, have been a cw radar? Was Hen Roost in fact a testbed for the signal later used by Dog House? There was some evidence that the Hen Roost had been dismantled by the Soviets after it was displayed in the 1965 TV film. If the re- ports of its demise were true, no more signals could be expected from Hen Roost, but those signals intercepted after the October 1962 nuclear test were still lying around on magnetic recording tape. It was possible that the Hen Roost signal had been there all the time and had been ignored because we were looking for a pulsed, rather than a cw radar. Some hope that a Hen Roost signal existed and that it could be identified was generated by the following train of logic: a) The Hen Roost should have been operating at the time of the nuclear tests. If the tests had anything at all to do with ABM developments, then all Sarv Shagan ABM radars should have been on. b) From considerations of Hen Roost antenna size and the beamwidth which would probably be required for it to do an ABM job, the radar should have operated at a radio frequency somewhere near 200 MHz. c) The Hen House signal, at a radio frequency similar to that estimated for Hen Roost, was intercepted; therefore, whatever propagation anomalies permitted detection of the Hen House signal should also have per- mitted interception of the Hen Roost signal. d) Then, if we were both logical and lucky, the problem would be reduced to identifying which signal, of those recorded, come from the Hen Roost. e) The Hen Roost signal should look like the Dog House signal. The search soon narrowed to only one of the 1962 signals. In the records, and as reported in earlier analyses, this signal had the ap- pearance of one from a very poor radar or perhaps some data trans- Apprbked For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A000S66ff6006-6 Appr v~ei OW I Raa 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78TO3194AO003P08APY06-6 mission system. The signal appeared as a train of ragged pulses whose width and repetition rate varied considerably throughout the in- tercept. The average pulsing rate was 12.5 pulses/second, too :low for all but the most arcane of ABM applications. For this reason and be- cause of its seeming instability, the signal had been dismissed in 1962 as an unlikely candidate for a Hen Roost transmission. Upon re-examination, however, another train of very narrow pulses, which had been overlooked during the 1962 analysis, was found intermixed with the broad pulses. When the repetition rate of this additional pulse train was determined to be a very stable 12.5 pulses/second, a powerful clue to the true identity of this long-lost signal was avail- able. Armed with hindsight, we can explain all of the observed signal characteristics in terms of a frequency-sweeping cw signal of the Dog House type. A signal which sweeps over a broad range of frequencies, even though it is transmitted continuously, will be detected by a narrow-band receiver as merely a pulse of energy. Consider the analogy of rapidly tuning your home radio. Many stations transmit- ting at different frequencies are on the air simultaneously. As the tuning dial is spun, the receiver will pass each station rapidly, and the listener will hear a series of brief bursts of sound. If this con- ceptual model is inverted and it is imagined that the radio dial is left at a single setting but the stations are constantly changing fre- quency, then a rough feel can be gained for the misleading appear- ance of a frequency-sweeping ew signal through a normal ELINT re- ceiver. The other features of the 1962 signal can also be explained by a ew signal model. As shown in Figure 1, the instability of the main pulse train could be caused by changes of receiver tuning. The short pulses could be caused by a much more rapid frequency slide of the signal as it returned from its highest value to begin a new sweeping cycle; the comparative stability of the short pulse train would result from the rapidity of the \"flyback\" and the consequent insensitivity of pulse timing to receiver tuning. Additionally, the width of the apparent pulse emerging from the receiver would be a function of signal strength, since receiver bandwidths are not sharp on-or-off functions, but instead fall off gradually on either side of the center frequency.

In all respects they matched. As the receiver was tuned, the positions of the broad pulses changed; with the receiver tuning steady, the interval between pulses was constant. The short and long pulses dis- appeared together when the receiver was tuned away from the sig- nal band of frequencies. In addition, the width and amplitude of the broad pulses changed with frequency, providing evidence that the transmitted beam was changing position with changing frequency. All in all, the match to a Dog House-like signal was uncanny. An uncanny match is not proof positive, however. The best that can be said is that the 1962 signal probably came from the Hen Roost, but it is doubtful that we will ever know for sure. The case for the relationship can be summarized as follows: a) The signal was intercepted due to anomalous propagation conditions after a nuclear burst. It appeared shortly after the burst and had not been seen before, nor has it been seen since. b) It probably came from Sary Shagan because of its coincidence in time with ABM tests and its appearance at the same time as the Hen House signal. c) It is a frequency-swept cw signal. Hen Roost was the only Sary Shagan radar at that time suitable for transmitting such a signal. In comparison with some of the rather far-out present-day estimates on Soviet ABM developments, this is a pretty strong case. It now appears, therefore, that those two large radars we first saw in 1960 were not really competitors at all, but were instead develop- mental models for two entirely different radars: the Hen House, which followed a fairly direct path to become an ABM early warn- ing and space tracking radar, and the Hen Roost, which, from the intelligence point of view, meandered a bit but eventually grew into the Dog House ABM radar at Moscow.

THE TALE OF HUSHAI THE ARCHITE C. N. Geschwind Since the publication of the Studies article, \"Wanted: An Inte- grated Counterintelligence\" in the summer of 1963, there has been an increase of community interest and concern about that most dan- gerous and least publicized of all agents, the \"agent of influence.\" 1 Accordingly, it seems appropriate to review the story of the first influence agent operation on record. This operation was set up by King David and is recounted in II Samuel, 15-18. This account is a good deal more circumstantial and detailed than the frequently cited cases of Rahab the Safe House Keeper (Joshua 2: 1), and Delilah the Penetration Agent (Judges 16: 5). Futhermore, besides its his- torical and human interest, this operation reminds us of the efficacy of simplicity, audacity, speed, and the exploitation of human frailties in this kind of enterprise. Here is what happened, when King David played for time to counter his son Absalom's surprise attack. David's handsome and popular son, Absalom, having waited many years in vain for his father to go the way of all kings, formed a conspiracy to kill him and usurp the throne. King David soon be- came aware that Absalom had assembled a large revolutionary force from among the men of Israel, and that the King's best privy coun- sellor, Ahithophel the Gilonite, had defected to Absalom. Upon hear- ing of this counsellor's defection, King David prayed that the \"counsel of Ahithophel might be turned to foolishness\" but he also gathered his loyal generals and bureaucrats and fled. Absalom thereupon oc- cupied the royal palace. Mounting the Operation When David stopped to pray in the course of his flight, Hushai the Archite, an aged counsellor, came to him with his coat rent and earth upon his head, professing grief and loyalty which the King Approved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A000301A p PAGES 21-24 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010006-6 SECRET Hushai evidently knew to be sincere. King David said to Hushai, \"If thou re- turn to the city and say unto Absalom, `I will be thy servant, oh King, as I have been thy father's servant hitherto'. . . . then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel ... and what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the Palace, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, who have with them their two sons, and by them ye shall send unto me everything that ye can hear.\" Capturing the Dupe When Hushai the Archite had made his way to the palace, he ap- proached Absalom, who knew him well, and said, \"God save the Kingl\" Absalom asked, \"Is this thy kindness to thy friend, David. Why wentest thou not with thy friend?\" Hushai replied, \"Nay, but whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose, his will I be and with him will I abide ... as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy pres- ence.\" And so Hushai the Archite was accepted as a defector and re- established as a counsellor. The Influence Operation At the council of war which Absalom called, Ahithophel advised Absalom as follows: \"Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night and will come upon him while he is weary and weakhanded and will make him afraid. All the people that are with him shall flee, and I will smite the king only. I will bring back all the people unto thee.\" This pro- posal reportedly pleased Absalom and all the elders well, but they must have had some doubts and second thoughts as to where the glory would land, for Absalom said: \"Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith.\" Hushai lost no time in exploiting the distrust, jealousy, fear, and guilt complexes inherent in the situation, saying: \"Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people. Behold, he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of (our men) be overthrown at the first that who- soever heareth it will say, `There is slaughter among the people that AppiVved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A00( 'IT0006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Hushai SIECRET follow Absalom!' And even he that is valiant shall utterly melt, for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man. Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee from Dan even to Beersheba as the sand is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person. So shall we come upon him in some place . . . as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and. of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one. Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel. bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there.\" Now, Absalom and \"all the men of Israel\" thought this advice was better than the advice of Ahithophel, no doubt in part because it gave everybody a piece of the action, and when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was rejected, he went home, \"put his household in order and hanged himself\" rather than get into a stenching contest with a skunk. While this demonstrated Ahithophel's foresight, it also put Hushai the Archite fully in the driver's seat. A little effective counter- intelligence work on Ahithophel's part might have yielded bigger dividends. The Espionage Action Like Alger Hiss millennia later, Hushai the Archite was not con- tent to stick to the relatively safe business of influence operations, but had also to dabble in espionage. Hushai immediately cabled on Zadok and Abiathar the priests and told them: \"Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus I have counselled. Now therefore send quickly and tell David not to lodge in the wilderness but speedily pass over (the Jordan).\" The sons of these priests, the couriers Jonathan and Ahimaaz, were staying under cover outside the royal city, and received this mes- sage via \"a wench,\" not otherwise identified. An informer observed this contact and reported it to Absalom, who sent out an investi- gative force. The couriers were aware of the leak and sought help from a village woman who hid them in a well. When the investigators queried the woman she said, \"They went that-away,\" or words to that effect, and the search went astray. The couriers then hastened to King David, who promptly crossed the Jordan and mobilized a desperate army.

There General Joab found and killed him, ending the insurrection. Since Hushai's accomplices subsequently prospered, it is reasonable to assume that he also retained an hon- ored place in the restored administration and ultimately retired with a large pension. General Joab, however, did not fare so well, for King David bore him a lethal grudge for killing Prince Absalom. Perhaps the King saw his renegade counsellor Ahithophel as the real villain in the piece.

COORDINATION AND COOPERATION IN COUNTERINTELLIGENCE It is axiomatic that the structure and functions of a counterintel- ligence service, or of the counterintelligence part of an intelligence service, are determined by the activities of its chief adversaries more than by any other single factor.' Any realistic discussion of US coun- terintelligence thus must begin with the two Soviet services, the KGB and the GRU, respectively, the state security service and the mili- tary security service. The scale of the effort that has been made and continues to be made by Soviet intelligence is difficult to exaggerate. Some 21,173 So- viet nationals reside in the 77 non-Communist countries of the world, of whom 5,943 are officials. At least 60 percent of these, or 3,560, are in fact intelligence personnel. Moreover, the Soviet services work very closely with the 19 intelligence services of the seven Communist gov- ernments of Eastern Europe. During the 1950's the Soviets domi- nated these services through a system of senior advisors whose word was law. Although this control has been somewhat relaxed during the 60's, close coordination continues. The testimony of defector Major Laslo Szabo before the Armed Services committee of the House of Representatives in March, 1966, amply bore this out. Szabo served in the AVH, the Hungarian foreign intelligence service, for 20 years before he defected. (He is now 43 years old.) He was given a full year of training by the Soviets in Moscow, starting in September, 1957. He testified that the AVH printed and distributed forgeries de- faming the US, at Soviet direction. One instance was the dissemination of a forgery of Newsweek magazine in late 1963, principally in Asia and Africa. He said that another AVH officer, Bela Lapusnyik, who defected in Austria in 1962, was murdered by poison in a Viennese jail on AVH orders carried out by the Czechoslovak foreign intelli- gence service. His testimony shows the unified nature of the clandes- 1 See A. C. Wasemiller's \"The Anatomy of Counterintelligence\" in Studies XII 4, p. 9 if.

It also helps to explain why the attack at the subterranean level is not affected by what is happening at the diplomatic or open level. The attack does not slow down, for example, because of thaws in diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR. Our defenses against this attack are of two types, passive and ac- tive. These two kinds of defense are commonly called security and counterespionage, and they constitute the twin halves of counter- intelligence. All US departments and agencies with intelligence func- tions are responsible for their own security abroad.2 Within CIA, re- sponsibility for security is divided in two different ways. Basically, CIA and all other agencies are trying to defend three things: its per- sonnel, its installations, and its operations. The first two, security of personnel and security of installations, are in the Agency the respon- sibility of the Office of Security. Responsibility for the third element, the security of operations, is in turn divided between the operating divisions, which have a line function, and the counterintelligence staff, which has the staff responsibility. This kind of division clearly re- quires close coordination, and this in fact occurs on a daily basis. US practices in physical security abroad are not uniform but are also not widely divergent. Our safes are much alike. So are our guard systems, floodlights, pass control systems, and the rest. The same is true for security of US installations, where one of the chief dangers is hostile audio penetration. In this area uniform measures of defense are ensured through the work of the Audio Countermeasures Com- mittee of the US Intelligence Board. One significant difference in personnel security measures is inher- ent in the basic nature and functions of the military as contrasted with CIA. A military officer typically serves a tour of duty in the intelligence specialty and then moves on. Intelligence is only one of the many functions of the armed forces, which need well-rounded officers. CIA personnel, in contrast, usually spend their entire pro- fessional lives in the same business. The result is a steady growth in sophistication, including counterintelligence sophistication, and the added advantage of a far smaller turnover rate in personnel. It also means that Agency people with access to classified information usu- The Soviets have adopted the opposite system: the civilian service, the KGB, is responsible for the security of the GRU.

They are themselves a part of the process of getting and reporting that information. The point is, however, that even though the security of each ele- ment overseas is its own responsibility, the hard fact is that US in- telligence security is essentially indivisible. The exchange of intel- ligence within the US community is vast and growing. The future will see an even greater exchange, chiefly as the result of the adop- tion of automatic data processing systems and community projects like COINS, designed to let us query each other directly by ma- chines. The possibility has therefore increased, and will continue to increase, that successful operations by the opposition could obtain in- formation originated by any element, if not all elements of the in- telligence community. The security of our foreign operations is also indivisible, and is also a community responsibility. It differs from other kinds of secu- rity work in that it does not employ set defenses, although it also must be based on basic CI principles. The security aspects of each operation must be hand-tailored, and no operations should be planned, let alone launched, without security being a primary consideration from the beginning. Counterintelligence specialists are not firemen, to be called in only after disaster has struck. They must be brought into the picture from the outset and remain throughout the life of any operation, if that operation is to be secure. Through their knowl- edge of the adversary services and their CI expertise, they are par- ticularly adept at foreseeing complications. The interdependence of the US counterintelligence community is also manifest in our relationships with liaison services. We cannot cut off these relationships because of concern about security, but experience has certainly shown that we must calculate the risks in- volved as realistically as possible in the knowledge that the US is now Soviet target number one. Between 1917 and the mid-30's the Soviets focussed their attention chiefly on France, in large part be- cause of the presence of the large white Russian colony in and around Paris. They were eminently successful, a fact from which we continue to suffer today.3 From the mid-30's to World War II the Soviets' emphasis shifted to England. Again they scored notable suc- cesses. Consider, for example, the case of George Blake. 'See the novel Topaz by Leon Uris (reviewed in Studies XII 1, p. 88).

He was found guilty of offenses chargeable under the Official Secrets Act that is, of spying for the Soviets- and was sentenced to 42 years of imprisonment. He was born in 1922 in Holland of a Dutch mother and an Egyptian Jewish father who had become a British subject. Blake served in the Dutch under- ground and became involved in the ill-fated British operation code- named North Pole. In July 1942 he left Holland, on British orders, and travelled through Brussels and Paris to unoccupied France and across the mountains to Spain. He was taken by ship from Gibraltar to England. After nine months in the Royal Naval Volunteer Re- serve he was assigned in July 1944 to MI-6, the British Secret In- telligence Service. He served in The Hague, London, and Hamburg, went to Cambridge for a Russian language course, took some tech- nical and tradecraft training, and was posted to Seoul, South Korea, in November 1948 as the first British intelligence representative there. His official or cover position was that of vice-consul. In July 1950 he and his colleagues were taken prisoner by the North Koreans and were held until April 1953. Blake later insisted that he became converted to Communism dur- ing this period. This is doubtful. Rebecca West, in her brilliant book The Meaning of Treason, speculates that he may have become a Com- munist agent during his service in the Dutch underground. In any event, the damage he inflicted was enormous. According to his story, he decided in October 1951 to offer his services to Soviet intelligence. He wrote a letter which was handed by the North Korean intelligence service to the ubiquitous Soviet apparatus. He suggested that all British prisoners be interviewed, to protect him against suspicion. This was done, and from October 1951 to January 1952 he was able to meet securely with a Soviet case officer. This part of Blake's story, incidentally, was confirmed by the Polish Deputy Minister of the Interior and chief of the secret police, Col. Alster, a Jew, who defected to the West after learning in late 1960 that the Soviets were planning secret anti-Semitic meas- ures. Among the Soviet spies Alster identified was George Blake. Between April 1953, the date of his release from imprisonment, and April 1961, when he was arrested, Blake served the British and Soviet intelligence services in London, Berlin, and Lebanon. Accord- ing to US calculation he furnished the Soviets with 4,720 pages of 28 SECRET Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Counterintelligence SECRET documentary material during those eight years. As a result Soviet intelligence scored some smashing successes. A highly placed pene- tration agent, a Russian, was identified by Blake and then killed by the Soviets after being identified by Blake. General Robert Bialek, the Inspector General of the People's Police in East Germany, de- fected to the West at the time of the June 1953 uprising. His apart- ment in West Berlin was only a block from Blake's. In February 1956, acting on information from Blake, the East Germans under Soviet control kidnapped General Bialek and brought him back to East Germany. He died in a Soviet prison. Blake attended joint meetings at which CIA legal-travel operations into the USSR were disclosed. He also attended meetings concerned with audio operations against the Poles in Berlin and against a Yugo- slav military mission there. He was present at joint planning ses- sions concerning the activity of the anti-Soviet Russian emigre or- ganization known as NTS. Four NTS leaders, who had previously entered and left the USSR, were caught on their next trip as a result of Blake's information, and were never heard from again. Blake served only five years and four months of his 42-year sen- tence. On 23 October 1966 he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs Prison. The facts of the escape demonstrated beyond doubt that it was engineered by the Soviets. The buoying effect upon the morale of Soviet spies everywhere can be easily imagined. Counterespionage The other side of the CI coin-counterespionage-has one pur- pose which transcends all others in importance: penetration. The emphasis which the KGB places on penetration is evident in the cases already discussed from the defensive, or security viewpoint. The best security system in the world cannot provide an adequate defense against it because the technique involves people. The only way to be sure that an enemy has been contained is to know his plans in advance and in detail. Moreover, only a high-level penetration of the opposition can tell you whether your own service is penetrated. A high-level defector can also do this, but the adversary knows that he defected and within limits can take remedial action. Conducting CE without the aid of penetrations is like fighting in the dark. Con- ducting CE with penetrations can be like shooting fish in a barrel. The famous case of Col. Oleg Penkovskiy is an instructive example. g Apprvg?Vor Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A0003000&006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 SECRET Counterintelligence Penkovskiy was born in 1919 of aristocratic Caucasian parent- age. His father, an officer in the White Army, disappeared in the post-revolutionary fighting in 1919. The son joined the Soviet Army in 1937 and was commissioned in 1939. During World War II he became a regimental artillery commander. In 1945 he married the daughter of Lt. Gen. Gapanovich. From 1945 to 1948 he studied at the Frunze Academy and from 1949 to 1953 at the Military Dip- lomatic Academy. He was then posted to the GRU. In January 1955 he arrived in Turkey as the assistant military attache and as acting head of the GRU residency there. He quarreled with a superior, Major General Rubenko, and was sent home in November 1956. He was embittered by the quarrel and its outcome. He began to think about getting in touch with the Americans. During 1958-1959 he was given technical instruction in missiles, and he began to accumulate information against the day when he could deliver it to the West. Having no safe means of hiding the copies that he had made of key documents, he carried them around for two years sewn into his cloth- ing. In 1960, as a member of a scientific-technical committee, Pen- kovskiy had legitimate reasons for meeting foreigners, among whom was an Englishman, Greville Wynne, who delivered certain mate- rials provided by Penkovskiy to the British Embassy in Moscow. Wynne also delivered a letter from Penkovskiy to American authorities. In April 1961 Penkovskiy was a member of a scientific-technical dele- gation visiting in the West. Intelligence contacts were made. How- ever Penkovskiy's three applications for visas for further travel to the West, all made in April-July 1962, were refused by the KGB. He was last seen at liberty on 6 September 1962. The Penkovskiy case illustrates the great value of penetrations. There can never be enough of them. It illustrates the need for ef- fective and secure liaison relationships. And it illustrates the neces- sity for coordination in all counterespionage activities. In the US in- telligence community, the responsibility for the management of counterespionage is lodged with CIA. Specifically, the responsibility of being the community's coordinator for espionage and counteres- pionage is assigned to CIA by National Security Council Intelligence Directive No. 5. Such was not always the case. In the late 50's, when the basic principles of NSCID 5 were hammered out, a good deal of parochial- AppMed For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A00td IT0006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Counterintelligence SECRET ism had to be overcome. During the drafting process, certain pro- posals were made which would have had the effect of destroying centralization and returning the US intelligence community to the competitive and fractionalized conditions of the past. General Trus- cott, then the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, read these proposals and said: \"Knowing General Eisenhower as I do, I should not wish to be the person who would bring these recommendations to him.\" In these later days, however, there is general realization that the Soviet services and their extensions in the Communist countries of Eastern Europe are a highly integrated system, and that we cannot cope effectively with a coordinated attack if we ourselves are unco- ordinated. The security problem we can handle in a decentralized fashion because security rules are pretty much the same for all. But counterespionage must be centralized. As we have noted, the heart of counterespionage is the penetration operation-and we could not possibly achieve reliable penetrations on a fragmented or de- partmental basis. The same is true of the other principal kinds of CE operations. To be effective, all require a central command post. In addition to the penetration, this is true of all efforts to induce defection. And it is true with respect to the deception operation. This type of CE operation is based upon an established channel of communication with the enemy, and the purpose is to insert into this channel misleading information which will cause the enemy to take action which is contrary to his own interests. The need for cen- tralized direction is clear. It is not possible to mislead the opposi- tion by a series of uncoordinated bright ideas. It can only be done according to a central plan. The need for central coordination is just as great in the employ- ment of the double agent. He is a center of controversy today in in- telligence circles because such operations are hungry consumers of time and manpower. From beginning to end, a DA operation must be most carefully planned, executed, and above all, reported. The amount of detail and administrative backstopping seems unbearable at times in such matters. But since penetrations are always in short supply, and defectors can tell less and less of what we need to know Approved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300046006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 SECRET Counterintelligence as time goes on, because of their cut-off dates, double agents will continue to be part of the scene.4 Audio surveillance, another important CE tactic, also must be centrally coordinated. It is a form of physical surveillance, which means sustained drudgery. It may many times depend for success on effective liaison relationships. Although Americans are technically gifted, no amount of such expertise will suffice if the operation is badly managed. In the past three years the Soviets have been publishing more and more about their own intelligence exploits and key personalities. This also underlines the need for centralized effort on our part. All of this material is being examined and when it concerns intelligence matters, it is being translated into machine language and stored on tape. By now a substantial percentage of the counterintelligence held in machine language by CIA was derived from overt materials. Ever since World War II the Soviets have devoted more and more time and energy to a third kind of subterranean attack in addition to espionage and counterespionage. This involves propaganda and disinformation, including forgeries, designed to convince people all over the world that Soviet accusations against the US, its military forces, and its investigative services, are true. This kind of operation is called covert, rather than clandestine, because of a basic distinc- tion. A clandestine operation, if properly conducted, remains totally concealed. The authorities in the target area never know that any- thing happened. A covert operation, on the contrary, must have a product, such as a radio newscast, a newspaper article, a forged docu- ment or some other tangible. For this reason the service carrying out a covert operation knows from the start that it cannot keep the activity itself a secret; it aims instead for plausible denial. The object 'It is important to be clear about this matter of defectors. What a pre-World War II defector has to say is still important. We shall not win this war against Soviet intelligence without true depths of expertise. When a Soviet defects, when he walks into an American embassy, the worst thing that can happen to him is a confrontation with incompetence. Strong-arm methods will not work with him. It's no good grilling him, or making him the objective of a squeeze session. Soviet intelligence officers are told over and over that if they come over to the American side, they will be ignored as individuals, and squeezed like lemons. What the defector most needs is the attentions of someone who knows his world.

He has one end of the trail of evidence in his hand. What he wants to do, of course, is follow it all the way back to the source. In other words, counterintelligence work carried out against covert activity uses the same methods as does CI waged against espionage and counterespionage. What we need to do is to spot the Soviet hand behind the visible product. We therefore study, for instance, the African, West German, or American writer whose work consistently echoes the main Commu- nist lines. Such themes have become familiar: the US government is fascistic; in America all minorities, including the poor, are ruth- lessly oppressed; American foreign policy is bankrupt, a mere dis- play of brute force; CIA and the FBI are Gestapo-like organs; CIA, in particular, has usurped the function of the State Department and is secretly making policy; America is dominated by commercial in- terests-Wall Street, the United Fruit Company, the big oil com- panies; the American negro can win equal rights only through vio- lence; and there are plenty of others. When we see these themes played and replayed-often appearing first in a supposedly non- Communist publication, then picked up and replayed by Tass and Radio Moscow, then repeated in Africa-we seek to learn all we can about the original author and the magazine or paper in which the piece first appeared. However far to the left the tone of such an article may be, the question is whether it is legitimate, in the sense of being an indigenous attack. If so, we can do no more than grin and bear it. Intelligence services can't be cry-babies, and they can't get into a public arena and slug it out with attackers who, no mat- ter how hostile, misled, or mendacious, are nevertheless expressing their convictions in their own terms. But the picture is very different if the supposedly non-Communist writer is in reality a Soviet agent, receiving the standard Soviet: pack- age of material from which to work, holding secret meetings with a Soviet case officer or a go-between, and accepting Soviet money. This sort of thing is as deadly as spying. In sum, the US needs to pay more attention to counterintelligence operations against Soviet covert action. We need to identify the agents, double some of them, place surveillance on them and their case officers, and finally mount operations to recruit Soviet CA spe- cialists.

When hostile clandestine pressure grows strong, the US counterintelligence community shows a correspondingly greater capacity for working together. This has happened with re- spect to Vietnam. The first and gravest CI problem there, which per- sists, is that there are simply not enough specialists engaged in full- time counterintelligence work. The need for tactical military intelli- gence has been so great that our CI potential has been largely drained off to meet the need for more order-of-battle and POW information, more analysis of captured enemy documentation, and the like. The CI teams of both the Army and the Marine Corps spend most of their time collecting tactical military intelligence. Compared to these activities, the OSI detachments and the detachments of the relatively new Naval Investigative Service are much less burdened with positive requirements, but these are primarily security, not counterespionage, units. The second grave problem is to determine the extent to which the North Vietnamese have succeeded in penetrating the government and the intelligence services of the South. The Republic of Vietnam has an extensive CI network. It consists of the Central Intelligence Organization, the Military Security Service, and the Vietnamese Na- tional Police. But they too are constantly diverted from long-range projects by the pressing need for tactical collections. The security program in the South simply does not work because the government has expressed and implemented its willingness to accept as citizens of South Vietnam all Viet Cong who profess to have had a change of heart. The first step toward coordinated action that had to be taken was to identify the enemy. As long as we persisted in using \"Viet Cong\" as an omnibus term for everything Communist, we were unable to understand events. In February 1967 CIA called together the ele- ments of the CI community and outlined the problems as it saw them. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, the Naval Intelligence Command, the Air Force's OSI, and the CI ele- ment of the G-2, Marine Corps. Task forces were created. CIA pro- vided space and equipment, as well as personnel, and furnished the researchers the counterintelligence collected up to that time.

What was known of the intelligence structure did not match the typical Communist pattern, and strength estimates were obviously far too low, when judged against the wide range of North Vietnamese intelligence activity. The first research targets to be selected. were the Security Sections, called the An Ninh, of the Communist Party of North Vietnam, which are physically situated in South Vietnam. These security sections are built around cadres of intelligence per- sonnel trained by the North Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security and infiltrated south. The Ministry of Public Security, like the rest of the government in the north does not recognize the government in the south and considers South Vietnam as its own territory, tem- porarily and illegally occupied in part by the American gangsters. Hence the An Ninh elements are regarded by their Headquarters as security forces. The Ministry receives a constant flow of information from these security sections and issues a steady stream of orders to them. The sections also contain South Vietnamese Viet Cong person- nel who have been recruited and trained in South Vietnam. Our present An Ninh strength estimate is approximately 20,000. Because of the view held by the North Vietnamese, these forces carry out not only espionage and CI functions but also public safety and security functions, judicial, police, and even penal functions. At district and higher levels, they also have an \"Armed Security Unit\" of the Security Section. It. is the assigned mission of this unit to seek out, harass, and if possible destroy the intelligence and security organizations and personnel of the opposition-chiefly the Americans. Other elements of North Vietnamese intelligence and Cl are now under study; and it is expected that additional papers, designed primarily for use in the field, will be forthcoming on such subjects as technical intelligence, and the Central Research Directorate. In June 1968, CIA published \"The DRVN Strategic Intelligence Service: Cuc Nghien Cuu.\" Computer programs are now being used to cope with the increasing flow of CI. In short, the team approach is paying off. Cooperation is excel- lent, and the results are proving useful to all.

A WATCHMAN FOR ALL SEASONS To begin with, the knowledge which strategic intelligence must pro- duce deserves a more forbidding adjective than `useful.' You should call it the knowledge vital for national survival and as such it takes on somberness and stature. Sherman Kent in Strategic Intelligence Allen W. Dulles in The Craft of Intelligence\" comments: \"The cloud in the sky may be no bigger than a man's hand, but it may portend the storm; and it is the duty of intelligence to sound an alarm before a situation reaches crisis proportions.\" No intelligence officer is apt to dispute Mr. Dulles' nutshell pres- entation of problem number one. There are, however, differences in the kinds of interest individual analysts may take in the cloud, depending on their fields of specialization-tactical analysis, current intelligence, strategic warning, and so on through a long list. There is a degree of overlap among the three fields named both because boundaries are nebulous and because the individual analyst is often expected to don more than one hat. Tactical warning might be described as that which can be obtained by such sensors as the DEW line radars indicating that an attack had actually been initi- ated. The best-publicized tactical warning in US history occurred in April 1775 when the intelligence apparatus of the patriots sent Paul Revere galloping across the Middlesex countryside. Strategic warning has been defined to be that which the intelli- gence community might provide prior to an actual attack, and hope- fully while preparations for the attack are still in progress. This is the uneasy realm of the warning, or indications analyst. In the na- ture of the case, therefore, the warning analyst deals in extreme situa- tions. The hypotheses he tests against the evidence tend to stress the outside possibilities. He is interested in what might be. The problem SECRET 37 Approved For Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78T03194A0003Wffl)\"ft# PAGES 37-43 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000300010006-6 SECRET Watchman of warning essentially involves the steady contemplation, and some- times the courageous advocacy of ominous cases. In the trade, these are known as \"worst case\" situations. Some other distinctions can be made. Current intelligence seeks to discern the enemy's actual intentions in the short run. The interests of current intelligence are world-wide while those of warning intel- ligence-as defined in the intelligence community-are rather lim- ited geographically. The latter is engrossed in \"indications of prepara- tions for offensive military action in the immediate future against the United States, its overseas forces or its allies.\" This is the pri- mary mission of the Watch Committee, the Washington focal point under USIB of strategic intelligence. It has historically been largely limited to the USSR, Communist China, and their allies. In the last decade the Watch Committee has followed developments from time to time in a number of diverse areas peripheral to the Communist blocs such as Laos, South Vietnam, Thailand, the Sino-Indian bor- der, Korea, Cuba and the Middle East. The rationale for following these developments has been that a potential for Communist ex- ploitation existed in the situation which might develop into a threat to the US or its allies. Indications, or warning intelligence thus may be said to be dis- tinguished from other forms of current intelligence in that its primary interest in enemy behavior is in terms of its threat potential. While indications intelligence is usually co-located with current intelligence, is always dependent on the same information, and is frequently de- pendent on the current intelligence analyst himself, it does neverthe- less view matters from a different perspective. The warning analyst takes incoming scraps, matches them in his mind against an indi- cator list, and frequently refers back to small nuggets that have long since lost their current intelligence value. The warning analyst may find threat overtones in a pattern of events which might otherwise he considered innocuous if viewed piecemeal. This is not to suggest that there is some peculiar mystique about the indications process. The indications analyst is, in the writer's view, a current intelligence analyst under instruction to review the same intelligence as others, but, as we have said, from a different perspective. The indications analyst looks at the information for any strategic threat, perhaps only potential, to the US, its forces abroad, or its allies. Other current intelligence analysts are also ex- pected, as one of their duties, to think in terms of indications, but it is the warning analyst's sole obligation to do so.

Let us assume that in the 1970s the leader- ship of Great Frusina (GF)-a mythical nation invented by Sherman Kent-chooses to levy demands in most threatening form on the neighboring small country of Outer Riding (OR) to stop the alleged gross discrimination against OR's Frusinian minority. OR has a de- fense pact with the US. Current intelligence evaluation of the situation will proceed along several lines. Thus, the political analyst sees the threat as part of the Frusinian leadership's effort to distract and obtain support from dis- satisfied groups. The political analyst will question the degrees of support to be expected from allies of the two countries. The eco- nomic analyst calculates the length of time it will take for GF to gird its logistic loins for intervention. The military analyst follows closely the number of GF units involved in exercises near OR's border. The indications analyst, however, might ask himself whether GF was just possibly using the threat of intervention to disquise efforts at a surprise attack on the US. How many of its submarines are op- erating out of their normal area? What is the state of GF's heavy bombers? Are there any unusual steps being taken in the civil de- fense field, such as art treasures being crated and moved out of town in case of a retaliatory attack, keeping in mind that OR has no heavy bombers or missiles that could reach the Great Frusinian capital city? Hypothetically and ideally the warning analyst should be able to rack up all his indicators, both positive and negative, and produce a rough assessment as to how ready GF may be to launch an attack. In reality, reading the warning tea leaves is not all that clear or easy. Except in the unlikely event of our having direct access to policy-making circles in Moscow or Peking, and guaranteed chan- nels of prompt communications, the available intelligence may pro- vide no signals, some signals, or ambiguous signals. Should the Krem- lin decide on a pre-emptive attack on the US limited to missiles, the preparations would be minimal and indicators might be virtually non- existent. The other extreme would be a full-scale mobilization of the enemy's conventional forces to be utilized in conjunction with his missiles. In the latter case there may very well be sufficient indi- cators available to give warning that the enemy had developed his capabilities to the point where he could launch an attack at almost any time should he elect to do so.

Thus, when only a single gauge begins to register abnormally, there may be no particularly serious threat developing. As an increasing number of abnormalities begin to show up simultaneously, however, the warning analyst inches closer to the edge of his chair and seeks to determine the intent behind the enemy action. The total picture presented by developing enemy action is rarely defined in sharp colors. It tends to be less than clear-cut, in part because of the constantly changing base lines which make last year's abnormalities this year's norms. By way of example, the Soviets' sur- face Mediterranean Squadron is now always present in the backyard of the 6th Fleet, and the Squadron's size has gradually expanded. There was no surface Mediterranean Squadron consistently on station the year-round prior to the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. Soviet heavy bombers get \"out-of-area\" and touch off radar reactions in Iceland and the North American east coast periodically, both in numbers and at distances that would have been rated as \"abnormal\" several years ago, but tend to be considered more or less normal, if not completely friendly at present. There is a strong tendency in the ranks of professional bureau- crats to safeguard one's nether parts. For the warning analyst, however, continually to utter only shrill cries of \"Wolfl\" would ob- viously be no service to the policy-maker. For this reason the warning analyst, keeping in mind the possibility of the worst possible situa- tion, must make a strenuous effort to give a realistic judgment on the significance of any collection of abnormalities. And since the enemy's activity may have been initiated for any one of a variety of reasons, he obviously must try to come up with the best possible assessment of enemy motivation. The enemy may he creating abnor- malities as he prepares for a pre-emptive attack on the US or one of its allies; or he may be attempting to defend against a fancied attack from the US, or he may be staging a magnificent bluff in sup- port of a major political move; or as in the recent past he may be planning-right next door to NATO-to force one of his satellites back on to the straight and narrow path that leads to Socialist per- fection, Moscow style. It can be hazardous to measure present and future situations against past lessons. Nevertheless, past experience does suggest a Appr#Bed For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000?b5&FF3006-6 Approved Watchman Release 2005/04/18: CIA-RDP78TO3194A000 0R1Q006-6 number of observations that should help shape the warping analyst's general background and judgment. Two Major Don'ts Don't expect the enemy to apply the same logic to his estimates of the situation in question as the US analyst would. To wit, in the sum- mer of 1968, there was a strongly-argued line current around the in- telligence community that the Soviets probably would not invade Czechoslovakia since they would surely be deterred by the oppro- brium with which the world would judge such an action. Don't be a victim of the Easy or Logical Explanation Syndrome. It is frequently tempting to accept such an explanation even if it may not be the correct one. Thus, during the Korean War there was considerable warning that the Chinese might intervene in the con- flict, but there was also a tendency to downgrade the seriousness of the Chinese threat. Instead it was interpreted as a diplomatic ploy designed to restrain the US and its allies by means short of direct military involvement. Remember that US intelligence has been trapped before by mis- judging the intended target(s) which an enemy is preparing to at- tack. Before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the warning signals received by US intelligence were analyzed, in part at least, as point- ing to a Japanese campaign against Southeast Asia, which turned out to be only a part of the whole truth. Remember that repeated warnings can dull the reactions and wariness of both the policy-maker and the intelligence analyst. Warn- ings on North Korean intentions and capabilities were given repeated- ly during the year prior to June 1950. How was one to distinguish the North Korean Army activities north of the DMZ in June 1950 as preparation for a jump-off when similar past activities prior to that time had proven invariably to be preparations for maneuvers? Remember that history does not necessarily repeat itself. An ex- cellent example of this was the Dutch hope prior to World War II that they would again be allowed to remain neutral as they were in World War I. The hope apparently grew into expectation. Thus, re- peated warnings from a German military source located in the horse's mouth, including notices of postponements and changes in schedule, SECRET Al Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 Approved For Release 2005/04/18 : CIA-RDP78TO3194A000300010006-6 SECRET Watchman served largely as an irritant and caused disbelief in The Hague. Fol- lowing receipt of the final warning, the deputy chief of Dutch intel- ligence is reported to have sought reassurance about German inten- tions by phoning the German military attache. In the latter's absence, his \"charming wife\" is reported to have given the Dutch bureaucrat the assurance he craved. The Dutch official thereupon went home, only a few hours before German ground forces rumbled over the Dutch frontier. The Two Important Questions Do the enemy's actions signify an effort at deception and is he deliberately, or perhaps unintentionally, creating a mix of signals that point in virtually opposite directions? The missile crisis in Cuba is a well-remembered example of deception. Another possible example is the Hungarian revolution in 1956 when, in the face of the rapid and large build-up of Soviet troops, Soviet officials in Hungary ap- pear to have carried out a charade by fulfilling an agreement to with- draw Soviet forces from Budapest and apparently indicating agree- ment to discuss withdrawal from Hungary. Does everyone have the warning? History records that some nine hours after the openin"
