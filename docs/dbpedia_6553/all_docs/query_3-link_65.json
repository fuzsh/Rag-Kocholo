        "text": "British filmmaker Guy Ritchie has a new movie out. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a big spy comedy with an all-star cast including Henry Cavill, Eiza González, Henry Golding, and Jack Reacher himself Alan Ritchson. But it isn't showing in any cinemas in the UK.\n\nThis has become something of a theme for Ritchie. Since cinemas reopened after the pandemic restrictions lifted in 2021, he's made four movies, and none of them have seen the inside of a British multiplex on their initial release.\n\nIt's quite the change from being the guy who shook up the UK's film industry in the 90s and 2000s with the underworld one-two punch of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.\n\nSo what on earth is going on, and is it actually a bad thing for Ritchie fans?\n\nWhy don't Guy Ritchie movies come to UK cinemas?\n\nThis trend for Ritchie's movies started with the 2021 thriller Wrath of Man, starring Jason Statham as a mysterious hardman using his particular set of skills to defend cash trucks from thieves. It got its American cinema release in May 2021, but was conspicuously absent from the UK schedule.\n\nLionsgate had planned a British release, likely during the summer, but they pulled the plug due to the continued uncertainty around COVID-19. Eventually, Prime Video swooped in to hoover up the distribution rights. Wrath of Man debuted in the UK as an Amazon Original in December 2021.\n\nNext up was Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre. This absurdly named espionage caper — again starring Statham — was originally set for a global cinema release via STX Entertainment. Things stalled when STX decided to retool the movie, which featured Ukrainian bad guys, in the wake of Russia's invasion.\n\nLionsgate stepped in to distribute the film theatrically in the USA, but it was again Prime Video that stepped up in Britain. They obviously enjoyed their time in the Ritchie business.\n\nBy this time, Amazon and MGM had merged, using their combined bidding power to win the global distribution rights for Ritchie's next movie — Jake Gyllenhaal starrer The Covenant, set during the war in Afghanistan. Amazon also stumped up 50% of the budget. The director's name was considered such a big draw at this point that the film was released under the title: Guy Ritchie's The Covenant.\n\nAgain, the movie swerved UK cinemas in favour of an exclusive Prime Video release, while MGM gave it a theatrical push in the States.\n\nWatch: Trailer for The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\n\nFor The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, meanwhile, it's the old combo of Lionsgate and Prime Video once again. The former is releasing the movie in US cinemas, while the latter is handling a streaming debut outside of North America.\n\nEveryone involved sees this as a potential franchise, with this first movie based on war reporter Damien Lewis's book Churchill's Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII.\n\nIn the UK, at least, Prime Video has decided that streaming platforms are the ideal home for Ritchie's movies, preferring not to butt heads with the bombastic blockbusters on the big screen. Amazon has certainly seen plenty of joy from gritty action, having made huge successes of franchises like Reacher as well as star-driven series like Chris Pratt's The Terminal List and John Krasinski's Jack Ryan.\n\nGiven that climate, it makes sense for Ritchie's projects to hit streaming in this way. He's also worked with Netflix for the new TV series based on his 2019 movie The Gentlemen, so he's quickly emerging as the king of streaming.\n\nIt's a shame that such a talented British filmmaker doesn't get chance to shine in our cinemas, but he's still doing plenty of wild and inventive work. Even if we do have to watch it in our living rooms.\n\nThe Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is streaming on Prime Video\n\nRead more:"
