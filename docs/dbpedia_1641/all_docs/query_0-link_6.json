        "text": "This is the best “brit-pop” album, sorry, I don’t make the rules.\n\nFounded in 1978, Pulp is a British band from Sheffield. From 1983 to 1992 the band would release three unsuccessful albums and see several line-up changes. The band’s fortunes changed when they shifted their style into what would soon be considered brit-pop. Along with Oasis and Blur, Pulp would stand at the forefront of this new musical movement. Their album His ’n’ Hers began receiving regular radio play and was nominated for a Mercury award. Following this success the band began recording for their fifth album, Different Class. Released in October of 1995 the album went on to be a critical and commercial success with three of the released singles cracking the top 10 in the UK. The album is also certified x4 Platinum in the UK. THis album and not the preceding one, went on to win the Mercury Award in 1996.\n\nDisplaying their driving pop-rock sensibilities, “Mis-Shapes” opens the album as an exemplar of this album at its best. Near spoken-word verses break into a catchy and melodic tambourine laced chorus with Jarvis Crocker belting for the rafters. This track also establishes the main theme of Different Class. The less well off blue collar class vs. the affluent upper crust. “Pencil Skirt” is one of the songs which doesn’t shine as much as many of the others for me. I find when the band leans into their old crooning ballad tendencies they lose me a bit. Perhaps their most well known song, “Common People,” is an absolute triumph. Crocker has stated in live performances this is the only song people will ever remember the band for, and he doesn’t care, because its a good fucking song. The song details an alleged interaction with a well off college student who longed to be like a commoner. Crocker then outlines the day to day life of the lower class over panging keyboard work while reinforcing the idea a rich person could never experience the desperation of poverty. The song has a neo-disco vibe but eschews the genre’s steady bpm for a song which grows in intensity with each verse and chorus. “I Spy” is a dark pop song with whispering urgency in each line. “Disco 2000” lives up to its name and more. Reminiscing on his childhood and envisioning the distant future year of 2000, Jarvis sings to his would have been sweetheart. The song has a bit of an incel vibe if we are being honest in modern parlance, but the end of the song is more well adjusted and mature. Side B’s “Something Changed” is a swelling pop ballad about happenstance and fate. “Sorted For E’s and Wizz,” is a keys heavy drug haze of a song. The percussive drumming and other worldly keyboard of the verses lead into the stilted choruses about the glory of a drug high and the inevitable come down. “F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.” has some inventive production value between its claps and stomps. The song builds up from a bleak and eerie space into a full blown pop anthem in the latter half. The menacing bass line becomes subservient to the high keys of the chorus as Crocker questions what love means in the most literal sense. This song is able to balance the band’s desires of being Leonard Cohen crooners and a disco pop revolution quite well. “Monday Morning” is a latin fusion power pop anthem which leads us into the album closer “Bar Italia.” This songs opening lines “Now if you can stand / I would like to take you by the hand” seems to be a continuation of the drug usage themes. In the end, the downcast common people all meet at this bar in Soho at the end of the night because there’s nothing else to do.\n\nMust Listen To: F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.\n\n“What…\n\nIs…\n\nThis…\n\nFeeling called love?\n\nWhy me?\n\nWhy you?\n\nWhy here?\n\nWhy now?”"
