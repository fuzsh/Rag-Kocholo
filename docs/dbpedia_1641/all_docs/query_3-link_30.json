        "text": "Vampire Weekend: white college rock with African rhythms\n\nJudging by these pages there seem to be two big new ideas in music for 2008. One is eccentricity, with its adherents already being dubbed The New Eccentrics. The other is white college rock bands borrowing African rhythms. That scene, spearheaded by Vampire Weekend, doesn't as yet appear to have been given a name.\n\nThis is an opportunity. The tendency of music journalists to put bands into boxes is often derided but, come on, it is kind of fun. And I bet Stuart Maconie has a wry smile to himself every time he hears somebody use his hugely successful coinage Britpop. It's also worth remembering that all genres get given names eventually so it's worth making the effort to try and think of a good one.\n\nI still find it weird that fans of music with walls of distorted guitar and breathy vocals have uncomplainingly accepted Shoegazing as the name of the genre they love. Why did the much more flattering and arguably more descriptive American term Dreampop never catch on?\n\nMore recently I've seen complex and intelligent bands like Battles described as Math-Rock which is even worse, especially when reduced to \"a bit math-y\". The problem seems to be that new scenes are often christened by people who don't like the music very much.\n\nSince Rock 'n' Roll there have been very few cool names for genres. Pop is a bit patronising. Hip-hop just sounds silly. Funk generally refers to either being scared or a bad smell - which might explain Jamiroquai but not much else.\n\nWikipedia has a long list of musical genres and there are a few that it would be nice to hear more often. Bastard Pop sounds great, although it turns out it's just a reference to the trend a year or two back for playing two songs at the same time. The self-explanatory Bleak House sounds pretty brilliant, too, although unfortunately that may be somebody's idea of a joke.\n\nAnyway, it's not too late to give Vampire Weekend and their lesser-known ilk a decent scene to belong to. Apparently they're influenced by the African musical style Hi-life so that may need to be incorporated in the title somewhere. They also have a touch of the clean-cut poppiness of Hanson's Mmmbop about them.\n\nSo how about Hi-bop?\n\nNo, that's rubbish isn't it? It turns out this isn't as easy as I'd thought - if anyone's got any better ideas, and nothing better to to do, I'd love to hear them."
