        "text": "3. Codes and Conventions • How do we recognise the Britpop genre? • Colours= blue, white and red • Logo/symbols= tends to be the Union Jack (sometimes mod symbols- influence of 1960/70’s pop music) • Influenced by British guitar music of the past • Glam rock • Imagery associated with Britpop was equally British and Working class. • Making sounds of the past (similar music to what it was in the 60/70’s)\n\n4. Britpop was defined by focusing on bands rather than solo artists. Writing their own material and playing instruments themselves. Singing in regional British accents. References to British places and culture in their lyrics. Fashion consciousness. Stylistically, Britpop bands relied on catchy hooks and wrote lyrics that were meant to be relevant to British young people of their own generation.\n\n5. Audiences • Because there was the emphasis on British reference points, it made it difficult for the genre of Britpop to achieve success in the US. • • • • The audience would have ranged from: British young people Working class Those who were interested in bands such as The Beatles, The Kinks, The who etc."
