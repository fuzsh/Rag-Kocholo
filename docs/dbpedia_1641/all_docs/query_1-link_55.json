        "text": "The Best of Britpop Music Tuesday continues with one of my Favorite Songs from the band Pulp. The song \"Disco 2000\" is my Favorite Track off of my Favorite Pulp Album, Different Class. Pulp is one of the Best of the Britpop Bands, and they are definitely one of my Top Britpop Bands (see my list of Top 10 Britpop Bands from the 90's here - with Pulp in the Top 5). So, take a seat, adjust your speakers or throw on a set of headphones, turn the volume up, and let's learn a bit about one of the Best Britpop Bands and Songs with Pulp's \"Disco 2000\"."
