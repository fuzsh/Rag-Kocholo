        "text": "A new four-part series Britpop: The Music That Changed Britain will kick off this weekend to celebrate the genre’s 30th anniversary.\n\nREAD MORE: Blur and Oasis’ big Britpop chart battle – the definitive story of what really happened\n\nThe series will document the story of the integral British genre from start to finish. There will be “exclusive new interviews with the key players”, who will tell “fascinating behind-the-scenes stories”, and a “rare and unseen archive of all the era’s big names”.\n\nThe first episode tells the story of Britpop’s rise to fame and the infamous rivalries between Blur, Oasis, Suede and Elastica. Some pivotal artists featured include Alex James and Dave Rowntree of Blur who’ll talk about their “disastrous” early tour and creating their classic ‘Parklife’ album.\n\nAlso, we’ll see Liam Gallagher and Noel Gallagher talk in rarely-seen archived interview footage from the early days of their career. This sets up well for the second episode’s deep dive into the Oasis vs Blur chart battle and feud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new four-part series Britpop: The Music That Changed Britain will be premiering on Sunday (March 12) at 9pm on Channel 5 in the UK.\n\nNoel Gallagher and Damon Albarn have buried the hatchet at least, with the former offering to sprinkle some more “Northern magic” on new Gorillaz material following previous collaborations.\n\nRecommended\n\nIn other news, Noel Gallagher recently revealed that he would “never say never” to an Oasis reunion. The band have been remained split since 2009. Noel, meanwhile, is gearing up to release his new album ‘Council Skies‘ with the High Flying Birds on June 2, having recently shared the Robert Smith remix of the single ‘Pretty Boy‘."
