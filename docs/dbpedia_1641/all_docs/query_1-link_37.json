        "text": "After a recent viewing of the latest Oasis rockumentary Supersonic I was reminded of just how brilliant the 1990s were. Born in 1987, I spent the next decade aging from 3 to 12. So essentially my entire childhood. Really rather integral years in early musical development.\n\nWatching the documentary reminded me of how colourful and optimistic the decade was, particularly in music. It was a good time to be British. We were pretty cool in the 90s. New politics, a new music scene and a new culture were taking over. Even in cinema Britain was proving to be a force to be reckoned with . Danny Boyle’s Shallow Grave and Trainspotting gave the British cinema industry a fresh new look. Guy Ritche’s Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels proved the UK could stand toe to toe with Hollywood. Hugh Grant and Richard Curtis were busy revamping the romantic comedy genre. The Full Monty was a hugely successful international smash, and on top of all that Pierce Brosnan stepped into the role of 007 and rebooted the withering James Bond franchise so spectacularly that GoldenEye became the 4th highest grossing film of 1995.\n\nWhat I remember mostly about music in the 1990s is that album releases, concerts, the top 40 chart rundown, TV appearances etc were all events. “Events” in the sense that, nowadays you can listen to anything you want whenever you want through your phone. Whereas, pre-internet, everything was met with a lot more grandeur. I remember watching shows such as Top of the Pops, TFI Friday and CD:UK with the entire family, sat around 1 TV. Due to the limited amount of TV channels (compared with today) a big event on telly really was a BIG event.\n\nIt was the same with music, there were no leaked albums or singles, no illegal downloading, no streaming, no viral marketing. When an anticipated album or single dropped it was an event. Everything was physical as well. You had to actually take yourself down to the shops and buy a hard copy of a cassette, LP or CD. Nothing was as disposable as it is now.\n\nAnother big thing for me in the 1990’s as well was purchasing the Now! compilation albums. They were essentially a collection of the biggest chart singles from the last few months gathered together on a 2 disc (or cassette) set. What I loved about them was the diversity. Unfortunately the UK music ‘charts’ seem to have spiraled into disarray. With the Guinness book of hit singles calling it a day in 2006, unable to keep up with the changing trends in chart referencing, and downloads becoming the preferred medium of distribution, the entire chart now, in my opinion, is open to debate. With the amount of internet outlets one can obtain a song from in this day and age I think it is near impossible to give an accurate account of sales and or downloads.\n\nThe diversity in the 1990’s Now! albums was truly wonderful though, and I don’t think you see too much of it these days. Now with specific digital radio stations, TV channels and charts dedicated to each individual genre you don’t seem to get the same eclectic mix of popular music as I remember there being. As well as the Britpop (that was predominately indie-rock), there was a huge boy band and girl band scene of the time, with acts such as Take That, Boyzone, 5ive, East 17, Westlife, The Spice Girls, All Saints, B*Witched etc. There was a big Euro-pop wave that hit UK charts with massive singles from the likes of Aqua, Eiffel 65 and Ace of Base and with a big Ibiza club scene emerging dance anthems and trance music was frequently charting well in Britain. On top of all this you had your rap, R&B, rock, pop-punk, grunge and even Nu-Metal crossing over into the mainstream, and because of music shows such as Top of the Pops all of these acts stood side by side and performed on the same bill. It was great.\n\nFor this blog post I have decided to focus solely on the Britpop genre. Firstly the term “Britpop” is ambiguous, and I’ve taken it to mean, indie-rock / pop produced by British artists that was part of a big musical scene in 1990s. Naturally I’ve not been able to cover every act that turned up on Top of the Pops with a guitar and a funny haircut, but here’s 20 of the best:\n\nBlur\n\nOne of the seminal pioneers of the Britpop movement were the London based alt-rockers Blur. Constantly reinventing themselves throughout the 90s and beyond, the band experimented in a number of musical genres including indie, hip-hop, electronica and gospel, and always seemed to be ahead of the game bringing something new and fresh to audiences. With 4 UK number 1 albums and 11 top 10 singles in the 1990s alone. Blur were definitely one of the most popular UK acts of the decade.\n\nThe Lightning Seeds\n\nWith a knack for infectious melodies, the Liverpool based quartet will always be remembered for their mega-hit Three Lions. Together with comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner, the Lightning Seeds’ single was the soundtrack to England’s 1996 European football tournament and their 1998 World Cup. Reaching number 1 on both occasions, the song generally resurfaces every couple of years for drunken yobbos to yell in pubs during international footballing competitions. Aside from their novelty soccer record, they produced a string of really catchy singles, including this fantastic cover of The Turtles, 1960’s pop tune You Showed Me.\n\nOcean Colour Scene\n\nOcean Colour Scene are definitely one of my favourite acts of the 1990s. The bluesy rockers from Birmingham released one of the major albums of the decade in the form of 1996’s Moseley Shoals. The opening track and lead single from the album, The Riverboat Song was propelled into infamy as it was used every week on Chris Evans’ T.F.I Friday. The show ran for 4 years between 96 and 2000 and pretty much encapsulated the 1990s. I had the privilege of hanging out with the band a few years ago, backstage at a gig in Crewe and presented Simon Fowler with a copy of their single The Circle. After looking it over he had no recollection of even recording the B-side, a cover the The Beatles’ Day Tripper.\n\nCornershop\n\nThis unique musical outfit from Leicester scored a smash hit in 1998 in the form of Brimful of Asha. A relatively obscure single released a year earlier, the song barely charted. However with a re-release of the track remixed by Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), who was also at the height of his fame, the song went straight in at number 1 in the UK, as well as charting in 11 other countries, and becoming a hit in Europe, the US and Australia. Taking their name from the stereotype that British-Asians “often own corner shops” the band fused indie-rock with electronica and traditional Indian music.\n\nCatatonia\n\nFronted by Cerys Matthews, the Welsh rockers peaked in fame towards the end of the 1990s, scoring 3 top 10 singles and 2 number 1 albums in 1998/99. Cerys also had a number of side projects in the pipeline around the same time, including a duet with Space on their single The Ballad of Tom Jones and then a duet with (the actual) Tom Jones himself on his Reload album. The album essentially rebooted his career and Cerys lent her vocals to the Christmas classic Baby it’s Cold Outside.\n\nKula Shaker\n\nWith infusions of psychedelia Kula Shaker were one of the “grooviest” British bands of the 90s. Their first record K released in 1996 became the fastest selling debut album in the UK at the time and contained elements of psychedelic rock, raga rock and indie. One of the first singles I ever owned was their 1997 cover of Deep Purple’s Hush which I still think, dare I say it, trumps the original.\n\nPulp\n\nTogether with Suede, Oasis and Blur, Pulp would definitely stand out as one of the “big 4” of Britpop. It’s hard to define the band’s style with traces of glam rock, art-rock, post-punk and indie all jockeying for position. Along with Jarvis Cocker’s obscure melodies and lyrics reading like the work of a working class poet, Pulp are almost indefinable in style. Originating from Sheffield, the band were hugely successful and influential in the 1990s. With huge Britpop anthems such as Common People and Disco 2000 the band stood out as something completely different within the genre.\n\nSupergrass\n\nThey were young, they ran green, kept their teeth nice and clean. They saw their friends, saw the sites and felt alright. It is rather bizarre that the Oxfordshire trio had around a dozen hit singles in the 90s but in retrospect are generally only remembered for 1. The infamous Alright peaked at number 2 in the UK charts in 1995 and has since become one of the “go-to” Britpop anthems.\n\nThe La’s\n\nSpeaking of bands that are only remembered for 1 tune…. The La’s were on the scene, a few years before Britpop took off. Releasing only 1 studio album in 1990 and scoring an international hit with There She Goes in the same year, the group disbanded shortly after. A couple year later, guitarist John Power formed a new band that successfully integrated themselves into the Britpop movement.\n\nCast\n\nAnd that band was….. Cast. With 3 top 10 albums and 11 successful singles released throughout the 1990s, the Merseyside quartet had a knack for infectious melodies and 60s inspired lyrics and instrumentation. Their debut album All Change went platinum, becoming the highest selling debut album in the history of the Polydor label. Walkaway is generally considered to be the band’s standout tune, however I remember owning this particular single on cassette circa 1997 and playing it consistently.\n\nSuede\n\nOne of the biggest and organically exported British bands of the 1990s were the alt-rockers Suede. At the forefront of the 90’s British invasion, Suede were already dominating the scene by early 1993, with a number 1 album and hit singles on both sides of the pond. Animal Nitrate and Metal Mickey charted strongly in 6 countries, the latter scoring Suede a top 10 single in the USA. Standing out from the crowd as being a bit rockier and a bit more glam, Suede definitely perfected their own sound, which successfully resonated with audiences around the world.\n\nTravis\n\nJumping on to the tail end of Britpop, the Glaswegian soft-rockers definitely used the 1990s as a launch pad to hit their peak. Their first album Good Feeling didn’t really do too much business in the UK despite spawning 5 top 40 singles. It wasn’t until 1999’s The Man Who that the band really took off. With huge hits such as Turn, Driftwood and Why Does It Always Rain on Me? the band would be at the top of their game for the next few years, producing a very impressive back cataloge of catchy pop records.\n\nShed Seven\n\nNever quite reaching the heights of their counterparts, Shed Seven were always slightly underneath the mainstream radar. Granted they were a lot less accessible for a pop audience. With more complex and melodic guitar arrangements and a slightly darker tone lyrically, they were never going to get a crowd going like Noel Gallagher could with Don’t Look Back in Anger. I am fond of the band though, and similarly to Cast’s Flying, Shed Seven’s Chasing Rainbows was one of my first singles. In retrospect, I’ve no idea how I obtained it.\n\nStereophonics\n\nI remember the ‘Phoics being tremendously colourful in the 1990s. Colourful videos, colourful personalities, coulourful tunes and colourful albums. Since their debut album in 1996, the band, I think have done a great job of maintaining a certain quality. Take for example, their first 5 albums in particular, there really isn’t a weak link. Similarly with their singles, from 1996’s Local Boy in the Photograph to 2005’s Dakota there isn’t a great deal of filler.It isn’t surprising that they’re one of the Britpop acts that are still going strong today.\n\nManic Street Preachers\n\nAnother motley crew of Welsh rockers that captured the hearts of 1990’s Britain. By 2002 the group had already racked up enough chart success to release a 20 track Best Of compilation. Scoring their first top 10 hit in 1992, the Manics continued strongly for the rest of the decade, even bagging a number 1 in 1998 with If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next. For me though, they will always be the band that sung the theme tune to one of favourite childhood TV shows, the Renford Rejects:\n\nThe Verve\n\nWigan’s biggest musical export since George Formby. Urban Hymns was one of the biggest albums of the 1990s and also contained 1 of the biggest singles of the 1990s, Bittersweet Symphony. I’ll challenge anyone to come up with a more iconic music video of the decade, as almost 20 years later, it’s still being parodied. Masterminded by front man, vocalist and lead songwriter Richard Ashcroft, after the groups disbandment in the late 90’s he went on to have a very lucrative solo career and is still releasing albums to date.\n\nElastica\n\nFormed by ex-Suede band members Justine Frischman and Justin Welsh, the band debuted with a number 1 LP in 1995. With only 1 album release in the 1990s, the band’s career was short-lived, but integral to the history of Britpop. The band had a very brief reformation in 2000 with a couple of the original members being replaced, and released their second and final album. With mixed reviews and an unremarkable chart peak, Elastica will always be remembered for their momentary, but brilliant stint in the mid 90s.\n\nRadiohead\n\nGetting inadvertently caught up in the Britpop scene, were the experimental / alternative rock band Radiohead. Their debut single Creep in 1992 is now legendary as an indie-rock anthem, and their 1990’s albums The Bends and OK Computer are some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful records of the era. Constantly evolving, the band reshaped their sound for every project, and it’s hardly surprising that they’re still continuing to release hugely acclaimed albums and filling stadiums around the world.\n\nPlacebo\n\nAnother band caught up in the mid 90’s madness were the alt-rock trio Placebo. Their eponymous debut album in 1996, proved to be groundbreaking on the alternative scene, giving a voice to outsider culture and accidentally spilling over into the mainstream. With lyrics about sex, drugs, gender confusion, bisexuality and suicide, combined with Brian Molko’s quirky vocals and some experimental guitar work, the band are 1 of the most unique outfits of the decade.\n\nOasis\n\nThe brothers Gallagher. The poster boys of the Britpop movement, and without doubt the biggest band on the scene. Unashamedly borrowing, plagiarising and thieving riffs and lyrics from T-Rex, Gary Glitter, Primal Scream, Stevie Wonder and The Beatles to name but a few, the band molded all their influences in to one colourful melding pot of optimism, rebelliousness and unbelievably catchy melodies. With Liam as the face of the band and Noel as the brains, Oasis became gargantuan in the UK and it’s hard to imagine another group (in this day and age) managing to reach the heights of their success."
