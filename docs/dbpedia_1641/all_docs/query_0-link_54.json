        "text": "If you grew up in the 90s, chances are you have fond memories of the music scene that dominated the UK and beyond. Britpop, as it was called, was a cultural phenomenon that brought back the glory of British guitar pop and rock, influenced by the likes of The Beatles, The Kinks, The Who, David Bowie and more. Britpop bands were known for their catchy melodies, witty lyrics, charismatic personalities and distinctive fashion sense.\n\nIn addition to the musical influences that shaped Britpop, this iconic era was characterised by a unique blend of rebellion and nostalgia. Emerging in the aftermath of the grunge movement, Britpop offered a refreshing alternative, celebrating a sense of national pride and identity. Bands like Oasis, Blur, and Pulp not only dominated the airwaves but also became symbols of a generation's spirit. The rivalry between Oasis and Blur, epitomised by the infamous \"Battle of Britpop,\" added a theatrical element to the scene, captivating fans and fuelling the media frenzy.\n\nCreator: Roger Sargent\n\nCopyright: EMPICS Entertainment\n\nBeyond the music, Britpop extended its influence to the fashion and lifestyle of the time. Union Jack flags adorned clothing and album covers, while the distinctive \"Cool Britannia\" ethos emerged, encapsulating a renewed sense of British coolness and confidence. Britpop became a cultural movement, influencing everything from fashion trends to the way people perceived British identity.\n\nThe Bands That Made Britpop a Thing\n\nBritpop was not a unified genre, but rather a diverse collection of bands that shared some common elements. Some of the most successful and influential bands were:\n\nOasis: I mean do they really need an introduction? The Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, were the poster boys of Britpop, with their swagger, attitude and rivalry. Their songs, such as \"Wonderwall\", \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" and \"Champagne Supernova\", were anthems for a generation. Oasis sold over 70 million records worldwide and became one of the most popular bands of all time.\n\nBlur: Oasis' main rivals, Blur were led by Damon Albarn, who later formed Gorillaz. Blur's music ranged from the cheeky pop of \"Parklife\" and \"Girls & Boys\" to the more experimental sounds of \"Song 2\" and \"Beetlebum\". Blur won multiple awards and influenced many indie bands that followed.\n\nPulp: Fronted by the charismatic Jarvis Cocker, Pulp were known for their witty and socially conscious lyrics that reflected the lives of ordinary people. Their songs, such as \"Common People\", \"Disco 2000\" and \"Babies\", were catchy and clever. Pulp became one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the 90s.\n\nSuede: Often considered the pioneers of Britpop, Suede were led by Brett Anderson, who had a distinctive voice and style. Suede's music was glamorous and edgy, with songs like \"Animal Nitrate\", \"The Drowners\" and \"Trash\". Suede won the Mercury Prize in 1993 and influenced many other bands.\n\nOther notable Britpop bands include The Verve, Supergrass, The Charlatans, Ash, Elastica, Embrace, Stereophonics and many more.\n\nCreator: Sylvia Patterson\n\nCopyright: The Standard\n\nThe Fashion and Adidas Brand\n\nBritpop was not only about music, but also about fashion. Britpop bands had a distinctive look that combined elements of mod, glam, punk and casual styles. Some of the common features were:\n\nParkas: The long green coats that were popularized by Oasis and Liam Gallagher in particular. Parkas were originally worn by mods in the 60s and became a symbol of Britpop coolness.\n\nBucket hats: The floppy hats that were worn by many Britpop stars, such as Liam Gallagher, Richard Ashcroft and Tim Burgess. Bucket hats were also associated with rave culture and football fans.\n\nAdidas: The German sportswear brand that became synonymous with Britpop fashion. Many Britpop stars wore Adidas clothing and footwear, such as tracksuits, trainers and t-shirts. Adidas also sponsored some Britpop bands and events, such as Oasis' Knebworth concerts in 1996.\n\nUnion Jack: The flag of the United Kingdom that was used as a motif by many Britpop bands and fans. The Union Jack was seen as a symbol of pride and patriotism for British culture and music. Some examples are Geri Halliwell's famous dress at the 1997 Brit Awards, Noel Gallagher's guitar and Liam Gallagher's coat.\n\nHow Manchester Was Synonymous to This Era\n\nManchester was one of the epicenters of Britpop, as it was home to some of the most influential bands and venues of the era. Manchester had a rich musical history, dating back to the 80s with bands such as Joy Division, New Order and The Smiths. In the early 90s, Manchester was also known for its rave scene and the Madchester movement, which featured bands such as The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and The Charlatans.\n\nManchester's influence on Britpop was evident in several ways:\n\nOasis: Oasis were formed in Manchester in 1991 and became one of the most successful bands of all time. Oasis' music was influenced by Manchester's musical heritage, such as The Beatles, The Stone Roses and The Smiths. Oasis also played some of their most iconic gigs in Manchester venues, such as The Boardwalk, where they were discovered by Alan McGee; Maine Road Stadium, where they played two sold-out shows in 1996; and the GMEX Centre, where they performed their last UK gig in 1997.\n\nThe Haçienda: The legendary nightclub that was opened in 1982 by Factory Records and New Order. The Haçienda was one of the most influential venues in the world, hosting some of the most groundbreaking acts and events of the 80s and 90s, such as The Smiths, New Order, The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, The Chemical Brothers and many more. The Haçienda was also a key place for the rave scene and the birthplace of acid house music. The Haçienda closed in 1997 and was demolished in 2002, but its legacy lives on.\n\nThe Britpop Now Show: A special edition of the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland that was broadcast in 1995. The show featured some of the most prominent Britpop bands of the time, such as Blur, Pulp, Supergrass, Elastica and Menswear. The show was filmed at the Manchester Apollo and was hosted by Manchester native Steve Coogan, who played his famous character Alan Partridge.\n\nBritpop was a defining moment in British music and culture, and Manchester played a vital role in it. Manchester's musical scene continues to thrive and produce new talents, such as The Courteeners, The 1975 and Blossoms.\n\nAs the curtain closed on the Britpop era, its impact endured, leaving an indelible mark on music and culture. While the sounds may have evolved and the fashion trends shifted, the spirit of Britpop continues to inspire generations, reminding us of a time when music, style, and a sense of rebellion intertwined to create something truly special. And as Manchester's musical legacy lives on, echoing through the streets and venues, Britpop remains a cherished chapter in the ever-evolving story of British music history."
