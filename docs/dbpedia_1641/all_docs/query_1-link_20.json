        "text": "Pulp’s classic 1995 song “Common People” has been voted as the No. 1 anthem of the Britpop era.\n\nThe Jarvis Cocker-led group came out on top of the BBC Radio 6 Music poll ahead of songs by the Verve, Oasis, Blur, Suede, the Bluetones and Ash.\n\nIn its heyday, Pulp was everyone’s second-favorite Britpop band. If you were into Oasis, you couldn’t be into Blur. But everyone plugged into the scene was just fine with Pulp.\n\nThe Sheffield outfit’s frontman cut a suave, charismatic figure with a genuine talent as a wordsmith. But success didn’t come early on. After various line-up changes and middling commercial success, wide attention finally arrived with 1994’s “His N Hers,” the band’s fourth studio album which delivered the hits “Babies” and “Do You Remember the First Time?”\n\nThe follow-up, “Different Class,” proved to be the band’s career-defining album. “Different Class” reached No. 1 on the U.K. albums chart, won the 1996 Mercury Music Prize, and yielded the top 10 singles “Common People,”” Mis-Shapes/Sorted for E’s And Wizz,” “Something Changed” and “Disco 2000,” which appeared at No. 9 on the BBC poll.\n\n“Common People,” with its elegant story-telling (“She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge, She studied sculpture at Saint Martin’s College, That’s where I, caught her eye”) and a video which featured Sadie Frost, actually missed out on the top spot first time around. The track peaked at No. 2 on the U.K. singles chart, pipped by Robson & Jerome’s cover of “Unchained Melody.”\n\nMore than 30,000 people voted on the poll, the culmination of a week-long celebration to mark 20 years since the birth of Britpop.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBBC Radio 6 Music’s “Favorite Britpop Anthem” poll:"
