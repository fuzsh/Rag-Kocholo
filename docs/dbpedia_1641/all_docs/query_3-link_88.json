        "text": "Britpop. What a wild few years that was, eh? Cultural moment, they call it nowadays, as opposed to being an actual genre, but I think there’s merit in both descriptions. I am, after all, a seasoned provider of opinion about music. The seasoning is a basic salt and pepper rub, but it’s still seasoning! So what do I make of the Battle of Britpop? We know that, officially speaking, the Battle of Britpop was a single chart-race between Oasis and Blur, with Blur winning out by a Country House mile, but if you want to look at a cultural moment like Britpop, you can’t look at a single chart race, but rather, at the war itself.\n\nSo, buckle up, and we’ll go on an adventure to explore the Battle of Britpop properly, shall we?\n\nNow, between you, me, and that person reading over your shoulder (Hi Dave!) I was a bit young when Britpop was in its prime, so I’ve had to do a bit of research and according to that research, there was a quartet of bands referred to as the “big four” – Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp. I had heard of all of these, and in fact, three of these feature on the playlist from our music suggestions page. But, I’ll be as fair as I can, and incorporate facts and figures into the matter rather than just relying on – ugh – feelings.\n\nSo, we’ll do a proper comparison in a tournament style. It’ll be fun, you’ll love it. And if not, it gives me a chance to mess about with some pictures and websites. To start, I’ve gone to Challonge.com, who have a tournament bracket generator, plugged in the four names, and it randomly generated the below tournament for us to start with. We’ll go through, deciding who wins section 1, section 2, the 3rd place match, and then the final. Let’s get on with it, shall we? Should be fun!\n\nOasis vs. Suede\n\nHonestly, I’m not entirely sure I can be impartial on this one, so we’ll resort entirely to statistics.\n\nOn the face of it, Oasis won out there, and honestly, I prefer them to Suede, myself. Match goes to Oasis.\n\nBlur vs. Pulp\n\nI don’t know for sure which band I was introduced to first of the two, but I’ve been aware of them both for many, many years. I remember being shown the Common People video and thinking “what the hell is the guy doing in a trolley, and why would she leave Greece to study sculpture?”, and I also remember blasting Parklife in the car on the way to do the shopping last week and singing along, so they’ve both given me positive memories.\n\nIt’s awkward, cos as a rule, I prefer Pulp‘s sound, but, so far, I prefer more of Blur‘s songs. You can’t beat the likes of Country House, Song 2 or Girls and Boys, but you also can’t beat the likes of Disco 2000 or Sorted For E’s & Wizz, so it’s a real tough one. I’m going to give it to Blur. Don’t hate on me for it, just accept that you’re allowed to disagree.\n\nLooks alright, doesn’t it? I went with stars instead of crowns, but the message gets across still. And considering it’s been edited in paint, I’m sure we can allow a few inconsistencies. Let’s resolve the 3rd place ranking.\n\nSuede vs. Pulp\n\nIn order to try and keep this fair, let’s have a look at two specific songs, one from each, and compare them. In order to keep this fair, we’ll do songs about the same topic, in this case, drug use, cos that’s a rock and roller move, isn’t it? I would normally insert a picture of someone who looks like they’ve had a particularly rough time of it with drugs, here, and make some joke about this being a now-washed-up rock star, but let’s be honest, I can just do a picture of Ronnie Wood and get the same message across.\n\nSo, drug use songs. Let’s go with So Young by Suede and Sorted For E’s And Wizz for Pulp. The former refers to the experience of taking drugs, with the repeated line “let’s chase the dragon”, something commonly associated with smoking heroin. Not so subtle. The latter has a more upbeat look at drug use at a festival of some sort – potentially Glastonbury, though it can’t be, cos it references Hampshire, and Glastonbury is in Somerset. Oddly though, I just found out it was debuted at Glastonbury, so that’s something.\n\nThe former looks at taking drugs as a consequence of misspent youth, whilst the other looks at it as an experience altering occasion, whilst also highlighting the possible consequences of partaking of whatever E’s and Wizz are. One assumes ecstasy and some other substance.\n\nI prefer Sorted For E’s And Wizz by a long shot. It’s a more cheerful song, it’s a happier song, even when looking at the controversial topic of drug use. It’s mellow – no real stress until towards the end, and even then, it’s a sort of chilled out stress – like I would assume someone tripping out might have. I wouldn’t know, I’ve never done MDMA. Unless you count listening to the Madonna album.\n\nSo, Pulp wins that one, putting them in 3rd place in the Battle of Britpop. What does that do for the standings?\n\nSo that brings us to the final. Who won the Battle of Britpop, between Oasis and Blur?\n\nOasis vs. Blur\n\nPart of me hoped it wouldn’t come down to this pair, but in my gut, when I started this post, I just knew it had to. There’s a reason they’re the two the media focussed on, and it’s because they’re the big ones of the big four. They were the ones to watch, and watch we did. So, to make this fair, I’m going to do the same thing I did for 3rd place, but twice. We’re going to look at the official “Battle of Britpop” songs – Country House, and Roll With It – and then the ones that, in retrospect, Noel Gallagher thought it should have been between – Girls & Boys, and Cigarettes & Alcohol. I’ll be doing this by scoring each song out of – unusually for us – five, and then combining each band’s scores to give them a score out of ten. The winner is the one with the highest score. Seems simple enough, right? Then let’s go!\n\nSo there we have it. The final standings. In fourth place, Suede, in 3rd, Pulp, Oasis in 2nd, and then Blur, the official TGTRS winners of the Battle Of Britpop. The final tournament image is below, because I’ve made the others and it seems daft not doing the last one too.\n\nAs always – and be aware, I only highlight it because we mean it – get in touch if you agree, disagree, whatever. Let us know what you think, and if you think differently, convince us of why you’re right and we’re wrong. I love a good discussion.\n\n-That Guy\n\nAdditional Comment: Personally, though, I think my favourite songs from each band are Parklife and Half The World Away. Very different songs, but both amazing."
