        "text": "This genre spawned some of my favorite albums. To name a few:\n\nBlur - Parklife\n\nElastica - Elastica\n\nSupergrass - I Should Coco\n\nOasis - Definitely Maybe\n\nSuede - Suede\n\nPulp - Different Class\n\nTo me, these albums stand the test of time and I will always view them as classics. Anybody else a fan of the genre?\n\nSame here, loved and still love Britpop. So many good albums during that period from @ '93-'97 plus/minus a year or so.\n\nVerve\n\nSuper Furry Animals\n\nOcean Colour Scene\n\nDodgy\n\nPortishead\n\nRide\n\nHurricane #1\n\nStereophonics\n\nRadiohead\n\nSome might not be \"Britpop\" but the music coming off of that island was better than anything else at the time.\n\nIt's amazing how many quality albums were released in such a short period of time.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like being young and being into punk and Star Wars, take a listen to \"1977\" by Ash. I've always thought it has such a great sound, massive in the right places.\n\nI used to own those compilations! Great collections.\n\nHaving lived through it, and being a target market (the Blur vs Oasis thing happened the week of my 16th birthday), I can confirm that it was mostly terrible.\n\nThe amount of albums that still stand up today are woefully few compared to the amount of garbage (not including Garbage) being thrown out on a weekly basis and hyped to eternity.\n\nI remember Oasis' \"Don't Look Back In Anger\" being played over and over during the coverage of the 1996 European Football Championship (which happened to be in England) on German TV.\n\nThe official Championship song was The Lightning Seeds' \"Three Lions on the Shirt\", but over here everybody was singing along to Oasis and the \"Morning Glory\" album went straight into the Top 10 and Oasis have got a strong German fanbase to this day. Even on their final tour they played to sold out crowds over here. I have seen them live four times myself.\n\nAnd the best thing was: the German team won the 1996 Euro! Sorry to our English friends\n\nIrony; I bought a CD single of Lightning Seeds' 'Sugar-Coated Iceberg' which had 'Three Lions' as a b-side (along with covers of 'SF Sorrow Is Born' and 'Porpoise Song') in a shop in Germany.\n\nWhereas I bought the 3 CD reissue of \"Be Here Now\" at Fopp in Covent Garden last year!\n\nI've studiously avoided buying any of these though I quite like Pulp. Oasis too badly recorded for me to bother with. The others I found quite annoying from the singles constantly playing at the time. 'Parklife' is an annoying earworm. There was much better material that would loosely fall into Brit Pop from this period such as early Radiohead, The Verve and PJ Harvey.\n\nSorry, but this whole 'Britpop' thing struck me as a total press/music industry invention...there was no britpop genre or movement at the time.\n\nYou could argue there were a few decent UK bands around at the time, but I think you could say that at any time...you can't really say any of them were a particular genre, other than maybe 'pop-rock'.\n\nI say the whole Britpop phenomenon, was a non-existant media created Yawn-fest.\n\nThe 'Britpop' era actually passed me by in the 90's. I was more into Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins and various grunge bands at the time. A couple of years ago I started listening to (revisiting) the so called 'Britpop' classics and now they are some of my favorite rock albums. I actually feel they are far superior to the American 90's releases of the day.\n\nThat is Pop not Britpop. It's what ultimately killed Britpop or pop/rock as a mainstream chart genre. Frankly I put the end as coinciding with the rise of The Spice Girls. After that the industry was only interested in artificially created boy/girl bands for some time. Some rock bands developed into more sophisticated album bands such as Radiohead. Dido is well post Britpop and comes from a dance music background.\n\nI suppose if you lived through that time I can understand if you would be completely sick of it. Because I am a 'late bloomer' with regards to the genre maybe I am hearing the music with new ears"
