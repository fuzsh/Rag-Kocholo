        "text": "Demon Music will issue a new Britpop-era compilation curated by legendary music photographer Kevin Cummins called Caught Beneath The Landslide: The Other Side of Britpop and the ’90s.\n\nAvailable as a four-CD set or a 2LP vinyl package, Caught Beneath The Landslide offers classic tracks, lost gems, live and alternate versions, B-sides and single edits from the Britpop era. Acts include Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, Elastica, Radiohead, Lush, Supergrass, Menswear, Gene, The Auteurs, The Charlatans, Echobelly, Ash and Sleeper.\n\nKevin Cummins was chief photographer at the NME for more than a decade and was witness to – and documented the musical and cultural phenomenon in the first half of the ‘90s, that was variously tagged ‘Britpop’ or ‘Cool Britannia’.\n\nHis photo-book While We Were Getting High: Britpop and the ‘90s, was published last year and now Kevin has compiled this companion collection. The four-CD package contains 71 tracks, which the 2LP vinyl set offers 26.\n\nIn-depth sleeve notes explore the bands, their influences and features contributions from producer Stephen Street, DJ Steve Lamacq, Johnny Dean (Menswear), Math Priest (Dodgy), Kevin Miles and Matt James (Gene) and Jaime Harding (Marion) and contain original photos from Kevin’s collection\n\nKevin Cummins says: “It was always my ambition to have a companion album to the book, a chance to enjoy the music of that era, music as timeless as the images. When I was selecting photos for my book, I took to Twitter to ask fans if certain bands could be considered part of the genre. Several musicians joined in to deny they were ever part of Britpop. The Manics were never considered part of the genre, nor Primal Scream, and much as I would have like to include them I chose not to. So it pleases me that we can feature both bands and many more in this collection, with its broader take on Indie music in ‘90s Britain.”\n\nThe Amazon-exclusive 4CD set with signed print is now sold out, but Rough Trade in the UK have an exclusive 2LP black vinyl edition also with signed print (it’s also available in the USA). This is also limited to 500, like the CD set. There is also a clear vinyl indies-only exclusive (also available at Rough Trade)\n\nCaught Beneath The Landslide: The Other Side of Britpop and the ‘90s is out on 4 June 2021 (was 30 April).\n\nCaught Beneath The Landslide 4CD set\n\nCD 1\n\n1.
