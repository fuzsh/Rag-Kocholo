        "text": "Where my dad had mods, and the generation between us had punk, I ended up with Britpop. The period between my 15th birthday and my 18th was a period of genuine optimism when Britain shrugged off the hair metal of Bon Jovi and Guns ’n’ Roses and pulled on a Kappa or Adidas tracksuit.\n\nLooking back, half of what made Cool Britannia cool wasn’t Britpop at all, at least not how we would end up defining it. But all of a sudden there was a constant stream of songs about what it meant to be British, and to be working class. Three songs stuck with me in particular: Parklife, Common People and A Design for Life.\n\nIn August 1994 Blur released Parklife, the title song of the album of the same year. Of these three songs it is the one that is thoroughbred, dyed in the wool Britpop. Jangly and primary coloured, with Quadrophenia star Phil Daniels providing vocals on the spoken verse, its accompanying video featured Daniels and Blur frontman Damon Albarn drive around an as-yet ungentrified East London in a beat up Ford, pretending to be double glazing salesmen.\n\nNot exactly a celebration of working class culture (Sample lyrics: I get up when I want except on Wednesdays /When I get rudely awakened by the dustmen), the song did however set a standard for the Kinks-esque storytelling, slice of life mode of songwriting that would embody Britpop. However, Blur did themselves no favours. The hilariously posh James Blunt described Albarn as having “an orchard full of plums in his mouth and a silver spoon stuck up his arse.” Albarn (an Essex boy like Brand), along with his bandmates, the other musicians in this list and myself, went to what Tony Blair would describe as a “bog standard comp”. It is true that in speech Albarn was a lot less cockney (or mockney) than in song. My sister adored Blur which, of course, put me right off them. On hearing the chorus to Parklife (Awwww the peepuwww, so many peepuwww…) I dubbed them the “New Chas n Dave” and even made a Chas n Dave CD inlay which I put in the copy of their following album The Great Escape when I gave it to her for her birthday. She was unamused.\n\nBlur went to art school but so did Pulp (see below). Blur were seen as the middle-class posh boys when they took on the suitably unsullied-by-education working class Oasis in “the battle of britpop” later in 1994, when their Country House was released on the same day as the Manchester band’s Roll with It. Some of the criticism was born from the slightly sneering tone of Parklife (not just the song but the album), but they suffered heavily because of the idea that your working class hero should be a noble-ish savage and not, under any circumstances, reference Balzac.\n\nNine months to the day later, Pulp’s breakout hit, Common People was released. There was no hiding the fact that Jarvis Cocker had been to art school (the song opens with “She came from Greece she had a thirst for knowledge/ She studied sculpture at Saint Martin’s College”) But Pulp were saved from accusations of being middle class by their sheer northernness. This despite the fact that Cocker’s mother was a (shock!) Conservative councillor! In Sheffield as well!\n\nAt a casual glance, it’s a similar premise to Parklife — a kitchen-sink-melodrama narrative with a brightly coloured, pantomime video (even with almost matching shots of terraced housing) but the point was very different. “Laugh along even though they’re laughing at you/ and the stupid things that you do/Because you think that poor is cool” could almost have been written as a riposte to Blur’s apparent posturing. The song was a smash hit and propelled the band, who had been struggling on in one form or another since the early 80s, to stardom. You could pick up an “I’m Common” T shirt from your local HMV. Of course to spend fifteen quid (a lot of money in those days) on a T shirt that said “I’m Common” was missing the point of the song spectacularly. I still have mine, although it’s a little tight now.\n\nI loved and still love Pulp, and Common People is a song I will always hold in great affection. The album it came from (Different Class, given to me as a birthday present from my sister with no sarcastic inlay card) was worn out on the sixth form common room tape deck and I rather clumsily used the line “You wanna sleep with common people like me?” to try and seduce a fellow student (I was rebuffed with a card that read “I’m no common person”). Two and a bit years later it would be the first song I would dance to with my partner, who I met at an indie disco at the student’s union (Liverpool John Moores, not St Martin’s). I refrained from doing the amusingly literal dance I used to do along to the song at parties back home, otherwise he might also have escaped my clutches.\n\nNearly a year would pass and I would try and fail to learn to drive before what I would argue is not just the greatest song of the era, but the greatest song of all time would come out. A Design for Life didn’t sneer, nor did it hide its erudition behind jokiness. From the opening line “Lib’ries gave us power” to the video which quotes Lenin and misquotes Orwell (“Hope lies in the proles”) these three Welsh valley boys, reeling still from the disappearance of their band-mate and school-friend Richey, skewered class and politics, and the idea that the Gallagher brothers were somehow more authentically working class by never having read a book. I’m reasonably sure it’s the only time there’s been a Lenin quote on Top of the Pops. And not just Lenin, there’s Le Corbusier. And Henry Van de Vald. And the lead singer has a slightly mangled Kierkegaard quote tattooed on him, and had since he worked in a bar in Newport. Where had this band been all my life? The short answer is making music since I was ten, but it took a number two hit to get them on my radar. They are bog standard comp boys, valley boys who don’t have to joke around to hide being clever, they read because they want to and are proud to be educated. James Dean Bradfield, he of the tattooed Kierkegaard quote, who talks about class and uses phrases like “iconoclastic eroticism” when talking about why he likes V-necked T-shirts, is considered the uneducated one (he went to sixth form so infrequently he turned up a day late for the last day.) The video, between quotes and shots of the band miming in a chilly-looking warehouse, juxtaposes footage of: drunk Leeds United fans and toffs in top hats at Ascot; fox hunters and poll tax protesters. Twenty years on I had the slightly meta experience of seeing the band play A Design for Life live, with a projected backdrop of the video, at the Royal Albert Hall. The video has footage, juxtaposed with the football fans again, of the flag waving Last Night of the Proms. We cheered when that came up, the proles (at least one of whom is a Leeds fan and was a little tipsy) having stormed the proms. Well, not so much stormed as paid £45 to get in. But still, as Orwell actually said, “If there is hope, it lies in the proles.”\n\nClass conscious but not arrogant, the Manics would support Oasis on their American tour, and at the Britpoptacular behemoth that was Knebworth. In 1998 they would score a number one hit with a song about working class Welshmen going to fight for the International Brigades in Spain. They would go on to have the first number one of the new millennium with Masses Against the Classes, a song that opens with a sample of Noam Chomsky. They are still going, like a series of well-timed explosions in a bookshop."
