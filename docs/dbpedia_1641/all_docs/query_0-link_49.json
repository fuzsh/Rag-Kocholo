It’s a bit nerve wracking choosing a live band, but I’ve always loved Britpop and a load of the music that has sprung up from those times – so when I found Adam and his band everything was looking good. Well it was better than good, the guys turned a good party into a great party and I can’t thank them enough for that. Professional in every way pre, during and after the gig – I would 100% recommend them. – Nick Canney – European Managing Director of Innocent Smoothies, 50th Birthday Party, Gerrard’s Cross\n\nWe booked Total Britpop for our wedding having seen them at a number of different gigs. These chaps are superb, can whip up a crowd, and are versatile enough to mix it up. The evening of our wedding was turned into a party by Adam and the guys- exactly what we wanted. Absolutely brilliant quality and range- made our evening. Well done and Thank You guys – Merry Christmas! – Lee Marsh, Wedding in Penkridge, Staffordshire\n\nThank you for a fantastic performance. The Warrant Officers’ & Sergeants’ Mess, Christmas Function 2019 appreciated the efforts from the band. The music was professionally delivered, sounded quality and enhanced the atmosphere. The performance enhanced the ‘Peaky Blinders’ themed event with tunes that everyone could dance, sing and relate to. All that attended have mentioned that you were brilliant and have walked away with lasting memories of the event. – Staff Sergeant Arron Hastings, Royal Engineers Christmas Party, Chetwynd Barracks, Nottinghamshire"
