        "text": "Who is Blur: Their Story\n\nAn early version of Blur was formed in the college years of the bandmembers lives at Goldsmith’s College in London. The band was originally named Seymour after J. D. Salinger’s Seymour: An Introduction, however the label that they signed with rejected the name and the members chose the name Blur out of a list of alternatives brought to them. The band produced “There’s No Other Way,” a single which peaked at number eight early in their career but had trouble matching it later on, producing a few flops. Leisure, their first full album did well, peaking at number seven on the UK Albums Chart; although, as John Harris wrote, he “could not shake off the odour of anti-climax,” and the reviews were controversial.\n\nThe band later discovered that they were £60,000 in debt, prompting an American tour to regain financial stability. They released “Popscene,” a pivot in their style, which was deemed to be quintessentially British. They claimed to be homesick while touring in the US, missing England, but when they returned home, they were upset to have found that another alternative rock group, Suede, had started to replace them as the rising stars. Later though, in 1994, Blur released “Girls & Boys” which is their highest charted single, reaching number five in the UK and number fifty-nine in America.\n\nThe bandmates started to fall apart after the Britpop battle with Oasis was over, and Graham Coxon specifically started to find comfort in drinking alcohol, unhappy with the image that Blur held as the ingenuine basic pop group compared to Oasis. He was also upset with Damon Albarn controlling the image of the band, so he started to listen to American punk and grudge bands, such as Pavement, which at first the rest of the band found distasteful, but they later embraced parts of the style, and the band grew in another direction.\n\nAfter the mania of the Top of the Pops battle subsided, Blur continued to record and produce music but has not managed to regain the attention of the media. In short, they lost the spotlight while Oasis continued to grow more popular and even struck a number of hits in America, something that Blur could never accomplish.\n\nThey have only produced two albums in the 2000s and 2010s, Think Tank (2003) and The Magic Whip (2015).\n\nThe Clash Between Oasis and Blur: The Rivalry Explained\n\nThe tale as old as time goes as so: The North against the South, the rich against poor, the educated verses the ignorant, OR all of the above.\n\nWhen Oasis and Blur started to grow into their styles, a new fridge movement called Britpop (a ‘pseudogenre’ mostly reported as a marketing tool and/or cultural movement) was new and was classified as sounding like a typical British, alternative rock-type sound. It was mostly combative to American punk and grudge styles.\n\nFrom this movement, four bands, commonly called the “big four” arose, Blur, Oasis, Suede, and Pulp, although today, Blur and Oasis are seen as the genuine ‘big two’ per say.\n\nOasis was a band that had a simple and uncomplicated sound, one that seemed to speak to the British masses. Noel Gallagher is often referred to as the mastermind even though Liam was the out-spoken, outlandish bandmember often taken to be “the leader.” When Noel joined the band in 1991, he noticed that the band’s members had unrefined skills, and to combat this, he created rhythms and melodies that were not complex or difficult to play. This proved to be a genius move, and they grew to be beloved for their simplistic style.\n\nAt the same time that Oasis was gaining traction, Blur also started to become a mainstream band. They, hence the term Britpop, were a quintessential British band, and they started to rub shoulders with Oasis.\n\nDuring the Brit Awards of 1995, Damon Albarn, after Blur had received four awards, which was unheard of at the time said “I think this should’ve been shared with Oasis.” Graham Coxon then said, “Yeah, much love and respect to them.”\n\nBut when Oasis produced “Some Might Say,” a single that reached number one on the charts, Damon attended their celebration, he says, to congratulate them. Liam reportedly came over to him and said, “Number fucking one,” right in his face. Albarn remembers thinking, “OK, we’ll see…”\n\nAt this point, Oasis and Blur both had their latest albums scheduled for a release date in Autumn of 1995, Blur’s in September and Oasis’s in October. This was not a problem because the albums could be released and would not interfere with the progress of one another. It was the release date of their singles that clashed. Oasis had their single scheduled to be released one week before Blur’s single “Country House.” The problem with this is explained by Andy Ross. He states, “We thought they were mad. But the thing is, a number one record tends to have a better-than-evens chance of being one the week after, just because it’s on Top of the Pops, and all the kids hear it.” This means that because Oasis had scheduled their single one week before Blur’s, it would most likely stay as number one, not giving Blur a chance to compete. This is why the release date had to be moved. So, the decision was to release Oasis’s Roll With It the same day as Blur released Country House. The date of both releases was now set for August 14 and the atmosphere was tense. Both bands were ready to claim the prize that they thought was rightfully theirs.\n\nThe thing about the rivalry was that it was about more than a title or even music — it was a battle between the British class systems. Blur was from the South, which, by stereotypes, meant that the bandmates were better educated and more financially stable than Oasis, who were from the North. None of Oasis’s bandmates went to college, and before their musical career they spent time as construction workers. Oasis dubbed Blur as “Art school wankers” while the press deemed Oasis to be working class heroes. The problem was not that either statement was more or less true but that the public seemed to be invested in this one-dimensional view of the bands.\n\nBy this point, Blur was seen as inauthentic and ingenuine. Oasis was almost guaranteed to win with “Bookmaker even giving the band odds of 6–4, in their favor” as Trash Theory states. But when the time came, Blur won by 58,000 copies, wining the battle of Top of the Pops. They then preformed at TOTP’s concert, bathing in their sweet victory. Alex James even wore an Oasis shirt, further antagonizing their archrivals.\n\nBut not all of the bandmates were enjoying their win. Guitarist of Blur, Graham Coxon, after not appearing to be enjoying the performance, almost jumped out of the window while drinking later that night. Alex James commented the following:\n\n“I think Graham just thought ‘Oh my god, this isn’t what I wanted when I was listening to the Pixies and Pete Townsend. I didn’t want to be sitting in a pouncey club Soho club with an oomph record at number one. What have I done?”\n\nBut the truth is often described as so: “Blur won the battle, but Oasis won the war.”\n\nWhen the two band’s albums came out, Blur’s The Great Escape hit number one on the charts, naturally, but never received the same recognition as Oasis’s (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? complete with the hit song “Wonderwall.” It became the fourth best selling album of all time in the UK, and even became beloved in America, a nation that Blur had repeatedly failed to be recognized by. Then, in the 1995 Brit Awards, Oasis won three albums, leaving Blur with nothing. In their speech, Oasis mocked Blur by singing the lyrics of one of their songs, saying, “All the people, all the people, so many people…”\n\nLater, in 1996, Oasis sold out two concerts at Knebworth, “the two largest concerts in British history” as Trash Theory states. In fact, four-percent of the British population (2.5 million people) applied for tickets.\n\nAfter the clear victory of Oasis, the Britpop movement slowed and then stopped altogether with Blur finally getting a hit in America. After they had started to drift into styles more connected with American bands such as Pavement and Beck, they finally produced their most popular song in America, “Song Two,” which is still widely acclaimed. Ironically, this also happens to be the song that is most unlike any of their other songs.\n\nBlur, although Google says they are still active, are largely dormant, and have come out very little to preform. 2003 was their ending. Oasis continued until 2009.\n\nHistory repeated itself a short time after, when a dispute between Oasis and Albarn broke out in 2005 when the Oasis song “The Importance of Being Idle” was knocked off the number one spot in the charts by Albarn’s song “Dare.” The dispute was not a hot topic as the Top of the Pops battle had been in 1995, but it was noted in several reputable newspapers.\n\nBut while Blur has retreated into the dark corner of history, the Gallagher brothers and their infamous fights are still very much in the media. Although, there might be something different about their relationship as the year starts off in 2021.\n\nIn 2017, Damon and Noel preformed on the same track, “We Got the Power,” and they even shared the stage. Liam was unhappy with this and took to tweeting.\n\nBut only three years later, as the 2021 year starts off, the two brothers, Noel and Liam Gallagher, try to patch their relationship. MSN says, “Oasis star Liam Gallagher started 2021 by attempting to end his long-running feud with brother Noel, telling him he loves him and that this is their year.” It’s a hopeful start to a new year and the end of bad blood. The only fight between Oasis and Blur was to make better music, and their contributions to the evolution of modern rock are undeniable. It seems that the only genuine problem that was that of the media and false stereotypes.\n\nComment your thoughts below and share your perspective.\n\nReferences\n\nLook through the list below to find quizzes and links that will send you to other articles that discuss specific albums and songs of the two bands.\n\nSources\n\nLook through the list below to find the resources that I used to write this article.\n\nReferences:\n\nBand Quizzes\n\n— Blur\n\nOnly True Blur Fans Will Know These Answers\n\nTest Your Knowledge of Blur\n\nTest Your Knowledge of Blur\n\nWhat Blur Member Are You\n\n— Oasis\n\nTest Your Knowledge of Oasis\n\nTest Your Knowledge of Oasis\n\nArchive of Sporcle’s Oasis Quizzes\n\nWhat Oasis Band Member Are You\n\nAre You Liam or Noel Gallagher\n\nAre You Liam or Noel Gallagher\n\nA Close Look at Musical Style\n\n— Blur\n\nThe Ultimate Archive\n\nBlur’s Top Ten Songs\n\nBlur’s Think Tank\n\nThe Ranking of Every Blur Album\n\n— Oasis\n\nThe Ultimate Archive\n\nThe Ranking of Every Oasis Album\n\n(What’s the Story) Morning Glory?
