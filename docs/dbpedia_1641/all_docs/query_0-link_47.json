        "text": "Welcome to The Weekend Stream, a relaxing review of notable digital-only catalogue titles. There may be no CD or vinyl, but there's plenty of great new/old music to float you into the weekend. Today brings remixes from ABC, Madonna and Cypress Hill, plus rarities from Stan Getz and Julie Andrews!\n\nABC, The Look of Love (Single) (Mercury/UMC) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nAnother single from the upcoming reissue of The Lexicon of Love; like last week's, it focuses on \"The Look of Love\" - arguably the signature hit from ABC's debut - as heard in Steven Wilson's new vocal and instrumental remixes and a live version that'll be included in the vinyl box.\n\nMadonna, Hollywood (Remixes) (Warner/Rhino) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nReleased last week, this digital EP contains remixes of the second single from Madonna's controversial American Life (2003). \"Hollywood,\" infamous for being the first Madonna single in two decades to miss the Billboard Hot 100 entirely, nonetheless topped the magazine's dance chart and reached No. 2 in England thanks to remixes here from Paul Oakenfold, Jacques LuCont and others.\n\nCypress Hill, Black Sunday (Deluxe) (Ruffhouse/Columbia/Legacy) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nReissued for both its 30th anniversary and the ongoing 50th anniversary celebrations of hip-hop as a genre, this new edition of Cypress Hill's sophomore album features five bonus tracks, including new remixes of \"Insane in the Brain\" and \"Hits from the Bong\" by Statik Selektah and the group's own DJ Muggs, respectively, plus three rare vintage tracks including a Spanish version of \"Insane\" called \"Loco en el Coco.\" The West Coast Latin flavor (and blissed-out weed vibes) of this seminal rap album are as strong as they were in '93.\n\nTavares, Love Uprising (Expanded Edition) (Capitol/UMe) (iTunes (TBD) / Amazon)\n\nTavares' first album of the '80s found the family soul group adjusting to a post-disco sound, to varying results. One bonus track is included here - the original single edit of the title track.\n\nPulp, Disco 2000 EP (Island/UMO) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nSpeaking of disco, this dance-y Britpop banger (a U.K. Top 10 in 1995) is the latest of Pulp's original CD singles and EPs to make a digital debut. This beloved tune is backed with original B-sides and three vintage mixes of the track.\n\nJulie Andrews, Sings (RCA) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nAstoundingly, for all the warmth and beauty of her voice on stage (My Fair Lady, Cinderella, Camelot) and screen (the dual triumphs of Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music), there are less proper albums by British actress and icon Julie Andrews than you'd think. Sings, recorded with Irwin Kostal's orchestra and issued in 1958 - years before he'd offer scoring and orchestration on her two best-loved film roles - is one of them, featuring crystalline takes on songs from legends like Rodgers & Hammerstein (\"It Might As Well Be Spring\"), George & Ira Gershwin (\"He Loves and She Loves\"), Cole Porter (\"So in Love\") and Irving Berlin (\"Cheek to Cheek\").\n\nThe Stan Getz Quintet, Interpretations by The Stan Getz Quintet (Verve) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nA sprightly set anchored by the legendary tenor sax leader, Interpretations is notable among jazz trivia lovers as the first long-player on Norgran Records, the second label created by legendary genre impresario Norman Granz. (For those keeping score at home, the first was Clef, and others like Verve would follow in years to come.)\n\nBill Anderson, My Life/But You Know I Love You / Bill & Jan (or Jan & Bill) (with Jan Howard) / Bill / Every Time I Turn the Radio On / Peanuts and Diamonds and Other Jewels / Scorpio / Billy Boy & Mary Lou (with Mary Lou Turner) (MCA Nashville)\n\nMy Life: iTunes / Amazon\n\nBill & Jan: iTunes / Amazon\n\nBill: iTunes / Amazon\n\nEvery Time: iTunes / Amazon\n\nPeanuts: iTunes / Amazon\n\nScorpio: iTunes / Amazon\n\nBilly Boy & Mary Lou: iTunes / Amazon\n\nSeven out-of-print albums from country whisperer Bill Anderson, cut for MCA in the late '60s and '70s and featuring duet albums with Jan Howard and Mary Lou Turner, are back in digital print today. Includes 11 country Top 10s between them, including chart-toppers \"My Life (Throw It Away If I Want To)\" and \"World of Make Believe.\"\n\nDavids Daughters, Chemistry (ZTT) (iTunes / Amazon)\n\nSisters Claire and Lisa Brickleback only issued one single for ZTT, the Trevor Horn-produced \"Dreaming of Loving You\" in 1999. An exceptionally rare promo sampler included it and two other tracks as teasers for a potential album; today that album is finally released: a slice-of-its-time sugary soul outing that'll stir feelings in pop fans of a certain vintage."
