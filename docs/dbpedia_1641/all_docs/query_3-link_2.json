        "text": "Brit Pop. What is it?\n\nBritpop (British Pop) is a subgenre of Alt-Rock and Pop Rock. A lot of people wouldn’t classify Britpop as a genre, but more as a cultural movement which is also true. Like Grunge, it was a term created and used by the media to pigeon hole something but with culture aside. Britpop like all genres does have its own unique characteristics and musical style that is different from other genres that have been seen before. Britpop takes elements from other popular music that was seen in Britain during the 60s and 70s and smashes it all together to create a new and a proved version of British rock. The genre heavily relies on the typical rock mould of 4×4 drum beats. But uses a lot of upbeat melodies and chord progressions to give it a happier feeling. Just like the Beatles used back in the early days of their career. The guitars are normally bright and overdriven giving us the typical rock sound you might have heard from The Kinks, The Who, T-Rex, and Slade. A lot of Britpop bands added elements of acoustic guitar to add clarity to the raw tones of the electric guitars. The drums are loud and proud giving the songs a thunderous hit. The vocals are the biggest and most important thing of Britpop. As you would guess it isn’t Britpop or less you sing with a British accent. The lyrical content was mostly about England, partying, being working class and most importantly sex, drugs and you guessed it rock & roll. (wiki,2016).\n\nBritpop only really became a genre in the early 90s but Britpop’s roots come from Indie-Rock bands that were popular in the mid to late 80s. Bands like The Smiths, The Cure and The Happy Mondays. But the band that influenced a generation to go home play music and form a new genre that would take over England during the 90s was The Stone Roses. In 1989 The Stone Roses released their self- titled album which saw massive success. They even held for its time one of the biggest free gigs at Spike Island. Which the likes of Noel Gallagher and members of Blur attended before they even started bands. (2003)\n\nThings were looking good for British music during the late 80s and early 90s. Indie-rock was at its peak and shoegaze was taking over. That was until grunge showed it ugly head and took over the world of music pushing shoegaze and even British music off the map. Which for a lot of young people living in England was an outrage. A lot of Bands stayed strong and with the help of local labels and magazines like NME, Creation Records, and Select. They tried to take back England and its rich musical culture. With this movement, we saw the rise of Brit pop thanks to Select Magazine releasing an issue which heavily featured British acts. On the front cover, it featured a picture of Brett Anderson singer/frontman of Suede a pioneering band of Britpop standing in front of a Union jack with the words “Yanks Go Home!!. After this we saw a rise in British bands who stood proud to be British and showed this within their music. Band like Pulp, The Stone Roses, Blur, Suede and Denim releasing albums during the early 90s featuring topics on English culture. This was mostly thanks to Blur who released their 1993 album titled “Morden Life is Rubbish” which was based on their fear of the US taking over Brtish culture with their fake music, Food, TV.\n\nBelow is a playlist of bands that set the way for BritPop:\n\nBut we didn’t see Britpop become a genre until a little band from Manchester released their debut album “Definitely Maybe” which took the music world by storm. It was the fastest-selling album in British history and made Oasis one of the founders of Britpop. At the same time, Blur released their album “Park Life” based on British culture and also had groundbreaking success in Britain. That same year we saw original Britpop bands like Pulp release their album “Different Class” which was also an album based on British culture and class. Because of these groundbreaking releases, British music was back in the world’s eye and started to push grunge back a few steps. A year later Britpop became huge in Europe, wave after wave of bands started to take the limelight and release albums which saw Britpop become King.\n\nIn 1995 Oasis released their biggest album yet which saw the world go crazy for Britpop. This album was “Morning Glory” which like their album first album become a number one album all over the world and saw Oasis great success. The album was fresh and different to their last and had a more hit than any other album released around that time. The Britpop genre got so out of control that the media started a battle between Oasis and Blur who also released their album ” The Great Escape” the same year as Oasis. Seeing a chart war to see who would be king of Britpop.\n\nBelow is a playlist of bands that become household names:\n\nDuring the late 90s, Britpop started to get out of hand and became a huge culture fad, which was out of control. People started to choose sides and dress up like the bands they idolized. Like grunge, Britpop was about to crash and burn as well. A lot of bands started to break under pressure causing them to break up or hide from any media attention. Bands like Blur and Pulp got sick of the limelight and the whole Britpop culture. They decided to move on by making music that was a lot darker and featured elements of grunge, the genre they wanted to destroy. At the same time, Oasis released their album “Be Here Now” which failed quite badly in the charts and saw the break-up of Oasis. Like grunge, Britpop became so easy to recreate that labels wanted to fill the void of Oasis and Blur. That pop stars like Robbie Williams took their formula and made it into pop hits.\n\nBelow is a playlist of the aftermath of Britpop.\n\nThe characteristics of Britpop\n\nApart from songs that sing about being a youth in Britain and its culture, what else makes Britpop well Britpop. To do this I will break down the characteristics of the instruments in the genre. The song I will choose is From Oasis the band who were at the top of the British charts during the 90s.\n\nThe track is a straight forward song that has a simple 4×4 beat and typical songwriting method of intro/verse/chorus/verse/chorus/bridge/chorus. The track is also played in the B minor key set to a slow tempo of 127 Bpm.\n\nBelow is the layout of the song.\n\nfile:///C:/Users/Bec/Desktop/Roll%20with%20It%20(Remastered).html\n\nThe electric guitars have a really classic tone. It’s bright, thick and snarly. Because it’s got so much treble and low mids. It sounds like they are playing through a pumped Vox ac30 causing the signal to snarl. It has that perfect amount of gain and with little effects added. This kind of tone would have been used by bands back in the 70’s like T.Rex, The Kinks and Slade. A lot of Britpop bands used the same kind of guitar tone during the 90s. Your typical classic British tone, Gibson guitar pumped through a big Marshall or Vox amp turned up to 11. In the verses the acoustic guitar plays over the top to give the song a bit more life and clarity. The acoustic is pretty bass heavy and has a lot of mids added to given the guitar a full rounded sound. Acoustic versus where also a fairly big thing during the Britpop area.\n\nThe bass has a lot of low end compared to the rest of the guitars and also is fairly distorted and is fairly low in the mix as well. The drums are simple but have a powerful impact, the drums are really warm and heavily compressed. The kick has quite a thud to it, almost like a metal kick, where the rest of the kit has a fairly reverbed room sound. The snare is really snappy and cuts through the mix.\n\nEven know Britpop died at the start of the 2000’s bands like Blur are still kicking and releasing music to this day. Even though Oasis is dead and gone their founding members Liam and Noel Gallagher are still making music and touring the world.\n\nBelow is a list of Britpop artist that are still kicking today.\n\nReferences\n\nBattasek, J (Producer), & Dower, J (Writer/Director) (2003).
