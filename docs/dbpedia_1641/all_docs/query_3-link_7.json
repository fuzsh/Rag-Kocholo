        "text": "The following is a list of Britpop musicians. While definitions may vary, artists labelled as Britpop were typically guitar-based bands that emerged from the British music scene, were popular in the 1990s, and focused more on melody than other contemporary genres such as grunge.[1]\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nArtists\n\n[edit]"
