        "text": "How well do you know the Britpop classic, over a quarter of a century later?\n\nDisco 2000 is one of Pulp's best-loved songs. Written about the teenage years of Jarvis Cocker, the track was taken from its parent album Different Class and issued as a single on 27th November 1995 - just five years before the excitement and the anticipation of the Millennium celebrations.\n\nThe release capped an amazing year of Britpop, but now it's over a quarter of a century old, have you mastered the lyrics to Disco 2000? Even the talky bit from the single version? We'll give you a line and you have to fill in the gaps with the correct words."
