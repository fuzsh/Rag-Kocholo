        "text": "Well, as many folks who were extremely unhappy with the IMHO horrible grunge scene of the early 90's I had a serious Brit Pop phase around 93-97. The whole scene seemed so creative and, yes, fresh - despite the fact that the genre was as old as The Kinks. For a moment it seemed rock'n'roll was back - it was cool, catchy and exiting -great albums like Pulp's Different Class and It's Hardcore, Blur's Parklife and Great Escape, Suede's S/T, Dog Man Star and Coming UP, Radiohead's OK Computer and many others sounded amazing to these ears. Then all of a sudden it all just went away... Was the genre discredited by Oasis and the Oasis soundalikes? Or by million of bandwagon jumpers that followed? Or maybelike any other scene in history it just had it's lifespan? (For me as moscovite what made matters worse was the sheer fact that almost every band in Moscow was playing russian language brit-pop at the time and they all sucked - nowdays it's almost a dirty word among the music lovers). Anyway - I still can't figure it out - when did brit-pop die and did it? Why? I mean there was no visible backlash if I'm not mistaken and it just faded away. Recently I started to rediscover some of my CDs from that era and to my surprise the music is a just as great as it was back then. Not the sonics -unfortunately - somehow you can't really play these CDs on a decent system. Anyway - what do you think of the genre now, more than 10 years after it's heyday? What are your favourite acts and albums? What bands were the good, the bad and the ugly? And why on Earth did it collapse?\n\nHave you seen the Britpop documentary Live Forever? It's a really good one, and it seems to imply that the heyday of '90s Britpop started to come to an end with the release of Oasis' eagerly anticipated and hugely disappointing Be Here Now album in '97, the major shift in Blur's musical focus with the release of their self-titled album that same year, and the rise of Robbie Williams as a major force in the British pop scene.\n\nI still listen to a lot of Britpop; I find the best of it still holds up really well. Pulp's Different Class is still an amazing listen (so many strong songs like \"Mis-Shapes,\" \"Disco 2000,\" \"Common People,\" etc ... incredible stuff). Blur's best records still sound great today. Great singles by Elastica and Echobelly and so many others still sparkle ... Oasis' stuff, for me, has aged less well, but once in a while I still find myself cranking up \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" or \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\" and really getting into them.\n\nI still don't really consider Radiohead to be a \"Britpop\" band. They just never really fit into that aesthetic, IMO."
