If you aren't sure how to help, check the article guide Format and Content\n\nBritpop was a British music movement that emerged in the early 1990s and became particularly influential during the mid-1990s. It was characterized by bands that took inspiration from the British pop music of the 1960s and the punk rock and indie pop of the 1970s and 1980s The movement was seen as a reaction to the grunge music that dominated the early '90s, which originated from the United States. Britpop bands sought to produce bright, catchy alternative rock that was distinctly British, both in sound and attitude.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe term “Britpop” itself was coined by the media and was part of a larger British cultural movement known as “Cool Britannia,” which aimed to celebrate British culture and creativity This period saw a resurgence of interest in British fashion, art, and politics, with the music scene being at the forefront of this revival.\n\nSome of the most prominent bands associated with Britpop were Oasis, Blur, Suede, and Pulp, often referred to as the “big four” of the movement1. These bands, while each having their unique style and influences, shared common traits such as catchy melodies, sharp lyrics, and a reverence for past British pop sounds. Oasis, for example, drew heavily from The Beatles, while Blur was influenced by The Kinks and the mod subculture.\n\nThe peak of Britpop is often marked by the famous chart battle between Blur and Oasis in 1995, which was dubbed “The Battle of Britpop” and received extensive media coverage. This rivalry was symbolic of the larger cultural and musical impact of the movement, which had by then become a defining feature of 1990s British pop culture.\n\nBritpop as a whole fizzled out by 1997. This was due to several major events in 1997:\n\nBlur released their fifth studio album \"Blur\" in February 1997, which marked a departure from Britpop and saw the band dabbling in alternative rock, indie rock and lo-fi.\n\nOasis released their third studio album \"Be Here Now\" in August 1997, which went on to receive overwhelmingly negative reviews for being overproduced, bloated and lengthy.\n\nThe death of Princess Diana in August 1997.\n\nSpice Girls debut in 1996 seemed to recapture Pop's supremacy back to UK radio and Ok Computer stole the spotlight in 1997.\n\nMany saw the death knell with Pulp's This Is Hardcore in 1998 abandoning the former Britpop sound and ending that band.\n\nHowever, there has been a resurgence of Britpop shortly after it's \"demise\" called Post-Britpop. Post-Britpop is a derivative form of Britpop that emerged in the 2000's with groups such as Coldplay, Travis, Keane, and Snow Patrol. By musically straying away from the sounds of 1960s British guitar groups, favoring those crafted by more contemporary, non-British groups instead (aside from their Britpop predecessors, including Oasis and Blur), and by emphasizing more contemplative songwriting styles.\n\nThere also existed the British Indie Rock Revival around the same period. NME focused mostly on a set of Indie Rock revivals, with most of it focused on the raw sounding Garage Rock Revival and the tighter sounding Post Punk Revival. Both of these kicked off thanks to The Strokes early success abroad and the rest of their NYC Indie Scene. The UK countered with a host of Indie Rock Revival bands of their own; The Libertines, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party, Maxïmo Park, Kaiser Chiefs, and Arctic Monkeys. The first wave of these bands found success and classic releases before a surplus of less original bands eventually lead to the derivative moniker of Landfill Indie that mockingly described the latter half of this movement.\n\nMusic[]\n\nArtists[]\n\nBlur\n\nOasis\n\nPulp\n\nElastica\n\nSuede\n\nThe Verve\n\nRialto\n\nThe Divine Comedy\n\nSaint Etienne\n\nThe Seahorses\n\nShed Seven\n\nSilver Sun\n\nEchobelly\n\nSleeper\n\nStereophonics\n\nStrangelove\n\nAsh\n\nSuper Furry Animals\n\nThe Supernaturals\n\nThese Animal Men\n\nTravis\n\nComplete list on Wikipedia.\n\nSongs[]\n\n\"End of a Century\" - Blur\n\n\"Wonderwall\" - Oasis\n\n\"Common People\" - Pulp\n\n\"Animal Nitrate\" - Suede\n\nResources[]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this aesthetic.\n\nGuides:[]\n\nRYM Ultimate Box Set > Britpop\n\nBritpop on Rate Your Music\n\nRYM Ultimate Box Set > Post-Britpop\n\nPost-Britpop on Rate your Music\n\nPlaylists[]\n\nYouTube:\n\nTop 200 Greatest Britpop Songs by Mr Secondsoul\n\nThe Ultimate Britpop Playlist by Doogie\n\nSomething For The Weekend - Britpop Classics by G Rock\n\nBritish Pop Music 2022 ♫ Best UK Pop Songs 2022 Playlist by MEDLEY.ARTEMIS\n\nCool Britannia: '90s Britpop by YouTube Music\n\nCool Britannia - Ultimate Britpop Playlist by RoadTrip NewEngland\n\nSpotify:\n\nBritpop music by Spotify\n\n90's Britpop by Spotify\n\nBRIT-POP CLASSICS by STUART BLEAZARD\n\nBritpop 90's by Adrian Hughes\n\nBritpop Playlist by NME\n\nBritpop Archive (Top Britpop Anthems) by Lennon\n\nGallery[]"
