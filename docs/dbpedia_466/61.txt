Hundreds of demonstrators went to Karama Square in central Suwayda to Al-Atrash’s birthplace in the town of Al-Qurayya, south of the governorate, to participate in commemorating the anniversary of his passing, as this anniversary is considered a traditional occasion of a political nature that calls for freedom, democracy, and building a state of citizenship.

From the guest house of Al-Atrash, the sheikh of the spiritual sect, “Hamoud Al-Hanawi,” delivered speeches in which he recalled the sacrifices of Sultan Pasha Al-Atrash, his stand against the French mandate, and his offering of precious and precious things for the sake of Syria’s independence.

The twenty-sixth of March every year holds an important anniversary for Syrians in general, and the people of Suwayda Governorate in particular, as it represents the date of the departure of one of the national symbols in the modern history of Syria, who raised the banner of the struggle for Syria’s independence and territorial integrity.
