        "text": "Mohammad and Warda and their five children live in a classroom at the Sultan Bash Atrash shelter. It is a tight space for the large family, but they are grateful for its safety after the devastation of the February 6 earthquakes.\n\nBefore the disaster, they struggled as they tried to pick up the pieces after the prolonged Syrian conflict. Prior to the war, the family had a good life. They were middle class, and Mohammad easily met his family’s needs.\n\nHowever, when the war began, they lost their home in the attacks. The family then moved from one rented house to another. Then, to add to their woes, the fifth place they called home was destroyed in the earthquake.\n\nMohammad and Warda felt they had reached the end of their lives. They did not know where to go and what to do next to keep their family safe and provide for their children. Also, Nour had to put her dream of becoming a doctor on hold as she can no longer attend school. Her younger siblings are still afraid of doing activities that prevent them from running outside in case another earthquake strikes. Currently, the family depends on humanitarian assistance to cover their basic needs.\n\nMohammad was reaching a point of desperation. Life was already difficult for the family, and with the added catastrophe, he fell into depression. Without being able to provide for his family as before, he felt he had lost his purpose for living.\n\nTears came to Mohammad and Warda’s eyes as they remembered the recent tragedy.\n\nAfter the dust settled from the earthquake, the family was assigned to the Sultan Bash Atrash shelter with other families who lost their homes. At the shelter, they were registered to receive food assistance, NFIs and hygiene supplies. They also met ADRA staff whose warm smiles, care and assistance began to give them hope. Mohammed began drawing again – a hobby that he enjoys. Thanks to the assistance Mohammad and Warda are receiving, their family can eat meat and drink milk, which were completely unaffordable before, and keep their family clean and healthy."
