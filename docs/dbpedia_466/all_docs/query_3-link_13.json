They had recently discovered the personal diary he kept during the Palestine War. I asked that we work together to transform that diary, along with the story of Ahmad Sharabati and his generation of Syrian nationalists, into a book about the founding fathers of the Syrian Republic. They agreed and this book would never have seen the light if it were not for the unwavering support of Sharabati’s three children, Issam, Aida and Nora, and his grandchildren. Seeing the tragedy unfold currently in Syria, they wanted to document how different it could have been for the nation had Syrian democracy not been curtailed in 1949. They spent hours reviewing the text, editing and helping with the historical narrative, providing muchneeded photographs and documents. They all helped polish the work into its present form, and other relatives of the Sharabati family took the time to see me for interviews, notably Zuheir Bakdounes and Nadia al-Ghazzi. Needless to say, this book is as much theirs as it is mine and I am eternally grateful for all their time and efforts. I would also like to thank Jennifer Muller, the senior editor at the American University of Beirut who transformed this book into its ﬁnal form, and my friend, Fadi Esber, who read the text during its early and middle different stages. Garry Thorp facilitated my research at The British National Archives in Kew, while Joanna Godfrey at\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nxiii\n\nI.B.Tauris saw promise in the early drafts of the work and agreed to help transform it into a book – a vital project at this speciﬁc juncture of Syrian history.

Very little trade took place beneath the covered arcade of the magniﬁcent Hamidieh Souq of Old Damascus, which bore a striking resemblance to the ancient markets of Europe. The same lack of activity was recorded nearby at the Midhat Pasha and Bzurieh Markets, where traders were usually unloading and selling merchandise by early morning. Despite the small number of automobiles, trafﬁc was tight and regulated by a handful of policemen operating manual trafﬁc boards rather than lights. In the small overcrowded ofﬁces of the Damascus press, young journalists were busy writing eulogies of an elderly city gentleman who had died in Beirut earlier that morning and was being brought to his ﬁnal resting place in Damascus. His name was Uthman Sharabati and he was known throughout the Syrian capital. The funeral procession started after midday prayer, as is customary in the Muslim tradition. One hundred men, wearing dark morning suits and red Ottoman fezzes, ﬂocked from all over the city to take part in the funeral. Amongst the crowd were former prime minister Fares al-Khoury, the nationalist poet Khalil Mardam Bey, the Damascus MP Fakhri al-Barudi, and the director of protocol at the Presidential Palace, ofﬁcially representing President Hashem al-Atasi. Leading the funeral was Uthman Sharabati’s eldest son and political heir, Ahmad Sharabati. Although out of ofﬁce at the time, the ex-MP and cabinet minister was accompanied by some of the\n\n2\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nmost prominent members of Syria’s political, intellectual and economic class. Uthman Sharabati wasn’t celebrated because of his wealth or his connections to the upper echelons of power. It was because ‘Hajj’ Uthman, as the Damascenes affectionately called him, was a nationalist leader, and a philanthropist. The city itself was just recovering from years of turmoil. The pain and anguish of World War II was still fresh on everybody’s mind, as were the death toll and psychological scars from the Palestine War of 1948. Since that ill-fated war, three coups d’e´tat had rocked the young republic and democratic life had been restored only recently. Familiar leaders had disappeared and been replaced by inexperienced newcomers. In a rapidly changing world, Uthman Sharabati was a man the Damascenes had known for years and whom they trusted. The Sharabatis were one of the prominent political families of Syria during Ottoman and French rule. The long list of these families included the Azms, traditional eighteenth-century governors of Ottoman Damascus; the Atasis, the ranking political family of Homs; the Barazi notables of Hama; and the Jabiris, a landowning family from Aleppo that produced statesmen and politicians. The family unit was an important pillar of Syrian society, embodying strong values and social continuity. Young men often chose to continue in the footsteps of their fathers and grandfathers, be it in business, medicine, theology or politics. The enigmatic Hajj Uthman was a tough, digniﬁed, self-made millionaire who was a ﬁxture in the public life of Damascus during the late Ottoman period well into the 1940s. He was a community leader and public ﬁgure, although he never held any political ofﬁce. In an obituary in the popular Damascus daily Alef Bae, Hajj Uthman was described as The front-page Damascus).1 His nationalists like\n\n‘a cornerstone of nationalism and Syrian industry.’ story called him ‘Fakid Dimashq’ (The Loss of name often comes up in the memoirs of ranking Abdul Rahman Shahbandar, Hasan al-Hakim and\n\nSultan al-Atrash, who describe him as a friend and ranking member of the Syrian resistance. Hajj Uthman and his son Ahmad were similar in many ways, but also quite different. Although politically engaged, Hajj Uthman stood\n\nHands That Give, Never Take\n\n3\n\nat arms-length from government ofﬁce. His son, however, excelled at it: ﬁrst as MP, then as minister of education, and ﬁnally, as minister of defence. Although the People’s Party was founded at his home, Hajj Uthman refused to join any political party, despite monumental pressure from his friends. But he didn’t mind his son cofounding the League of National Action and then the National Party in post-French mandate Syria. Hajj Uthman spoke only Arabic and Ottoman Turkish, while his son conversed ﬂawlessly in ﬁve languages: Arabic, English, French, Turkish and German. Yet both father and son shared an unwavering commitment to Syria. Both had suffered at the hands of foreign occupiers and both took great pride at being founding fathers of the republic. A SELF-MADE MAN Uthman Sharabati was born into a small family in the conservative alSalhieh neighbourhood of Damascus, a middle-class district famed for its mosques, schools and cemeteries. Its name is derived from ‘Al-Saliheen,’ which roughly translates as ‘good and saintly’ residents of the neighbourhood. Al-Salhieh was a relatively new neighbourhood of Damascus, originally inhabited by pious emigrants from Greece, Spain, Turkey, the Hejaz, North Africa and Palestine. It lay to the northwest of the old walled city of Damascus, perched on the slopes of Mount Qassioun, and was highly attractive to newcomers for its fertile land and fresh air. When the Sharabati family settled in al-Salhieh, they were known as ‘Armawi,’ after the town in northern Spain, Ermua, from which they had come. At the time of Hajj Uthman’s birth in 1878, al-Salhieh was approximately 800 years old, and had no more than 300 inhabitants. By 1936, it had grown to include 2,814 residents: 2,622 Sunni Muslims, 182 Christians and ten Jews.2 Al-Salhieh evoked modernity and stood in stark contrast to the narrow, cobbled alleys of the Old City. Only al-Salhieh and other densely populated parts of town were well-lit and safe after dark.3 Hajj Uthman’s father was a workingman who dressed and lived like the other ordinary folk of al-Salhieh; devoted completely to his small family and daily prayers. He had no land, no steady income and\n\n4\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nno connections at government ofﬁces in Damascus or Istanbul. None of his relatives were prominent in the Ottoman Army or the Damascus Municipality. He had three sons – Uthman, Abdulhamid and Subhi – and one daughter, Fatima. They were never poor, but money was never abundant for the family.4 Unlike his siblings, Hajj Uthman did get some proper schooling at one of the numerous schools of al-Salhieh. He was taught Islamic history, penmanship, mathematics and grammar until sixth grade, when he was pulled out to work at a wholesale trade shop in the al-Bzurieh spice market, owned by Rushdi al-Rikabi al-Sukkari, a prominent city merchant.5 While at school, he earned extra income by helping wealthier boys write their homework, in exchange for one barghout (penny in Ottoman currency) per assignment.6 The money he made was not his to spend – he always gave it to his father and siblings. Uthman Sharabati was an intelligent young man; full of life and with a sharp analytical mind that allowed him to excel in mathematics and calculate risk and opportunity. He learned the streetwise methods of the Damascene markets and the centuries-old business ethics, which emphasised chivalry, philanthropy, trust and word of honour – as well, of course, as tough bargaining. By the age of ﬁfteen, he was buying and selling any item he could get his hands upon – sugar, rice and burghul (parboiled wheat). In time, he made a small fortune and set up shops of his own. With money came dramatic changes and upward social mobility, enabling Uthman Sharabati to marry, at the young age of twenty-two, into the prominent Tabba family from the ancient Bab Srijeh neighbourhood. By that time, Hajj Uthman had bought a new house, not far from his father’s house in al-Salhieh, in Zukak al-Hayet near the al-Aﬁf Mosque.7 It was a brand-new house, built by Europeantrained Ottoman architects with two large rooms at the entrance – one for the family and one for guests – separated by a long corridor that led to the living quarters. This is the house where Ahmad Sharabati was born in 1907. Despite Hajj Uthman’s efforts, however, his marriage did not last long, ending shortly after the crib death of his third child. Hajj Uthman remarried Muhibeh Eid, who also hailed from a prominent Damascene family. She gave birth to Ahmad Sharabati’s three half-siblings: two girls and a boy. The eldest,\n\nHands That Give, Never Take\n\n5\n\nMounira, was born during World War I, then Mustapha in 1919 and Hiba in 1921. The young Ahmad Sharabati developed an extremely close relationship with his half-brother and sisters, and became like a father to them after Hajj Uthman’s death in 1950. A SEASONED BUSINESSMAN Having put his family troubles behind him, Hajj Uthman concentrated on running his numerous businesses, which soon expanded to include importing steel and exporting dried fruits to Egypt and Palestine. His daily routine included a stroll to his ofﬁce via a small alley facing the main gate of the Damascus Citadel, a huge medieval fortress located in the northwest corner of the city walls. From his ofﬁce, Hajj Uthman ran his daily affairs and met regularly with members of the charity organisation he had established in al-Salhieh in 1932, to care for the neighbourhood’s poor and needy. It provided morning classes for children and evening classes for illiterate working adults, and ran an orphanage for twenty young boys. Hajj Uthman paid for the orphanage’s electricity, books and student desks. Hajj Uthman’s most successful venture was a tobacco factory that he set up in 1921 overlooking the River Barada in al-Baramkeh, near the main campus of the Syrian University. In 1883, a French ﬁrm had obtained concessions to produce, package, sell and tax tobacco in Ottoman Syria. The Ottoman government had been forced into signing this painful concession to evade foreclosure by French creditors. The French had invested heavily in Ottoman Syria, to the sum of 200 million French francs.8 They had paved the ﬁrst road linking Damascus to Beirut in 1853, constructed the port of Beirut in the 1890s and built the main railroad linking Beirut with Damascus and the Houran province in southwest Syria.9 Tobacco was a highly proﬁtable industry. It was harvested from the vast agricultural ﬁelds surrounding Alawite villages on in the Syrian coast and sold in Europe to the continent’s pipe-smoking notables, who favoured its freshness and taste.10 The Regie de Tabac, as this monopoly came to be known, dominated the tobacco trade for decades, and tobacco-makers like Hajj Uthman had to produce and sell under its auspices. When the\n\n6\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nlicense of the Regie de Tabac expired in 1930, production then went to the private sector, in which Hajj Uthman was king of the trade. The French, ﬁrmly in control of Syria by the time, taxed him with a staggering forty per cent of income and forced him to regulate both price and production.11 During the early 1930s, Uthman brieﬂy introduced ‘Sharabati Cigarettes’ into the Syrian market, which were branded using nationalistic slogans starting with, ‘Oh Patriots!’ When the worldwide depression reached Syria in the mid-1930s the cigarette industry crashed, inﬂicting painful losses. Hajj Uthman started to produce cheaper cigarettes for ordinary folk, Bafra, which became to Syrians what Marlboros were to Americans during World War II. Furious with his success, the French granted a new monopoly to a privately owned Franco-Lebanese company, the Campagnie Libano-Syrienne de Tabacs, which sold cigarettes at a low price in order to ruin Uthman Sharabati. In December 1932, his friend Fakhri al-Barudi, the charismatic leader of the National Bloc, staged a dramatic protest at the Grand Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. From its pulpit, he spoke out against the tobacco monopoly and asked the assembled masses to endorse his ‘Made in Syria’ campaign. ‘Buy Syrian products – from wedding gowns and trousers, to Syrianmade cigarettes!’12 Hajj Uthman retired at the age of sixty-eight, shortly after French troops left Syria. The tobacco business was very proﬁtable for the Sharabatis, and it was eventually bequeathed to his son in 1946, the year of Syria’s independence. While running it, Ahmad Sharabati ﬁnanced his political career, arranging street demonstrations and providing services to his supporters, which is how the patron-client system worked throughout the Middle East. Politicians would distribute money generously at election time, during the Eid holidays and throughout the month of Ramadan. They would provide services for their constituencies, such as paving roads, collecting garbage and bringing both running water and electricity to neighbourhoods within their sphere of inﬂuence. Aside from the tobacco business, the Sharabati family possessed many assets around Damascus. In addition to the main ofﬁce in al-Asrounieh near the Damascus Citadel, Hajj Uthman owned eight shops in the al-Bzurieh Market, where he had ﬁrst learned the secrets\n\nHands That Give, Never Take\n\n7\n\nof the business world. He also owned a bakery in al-Salhieh, near Hammam al-Muqqadam. Among his most important assets were large tracts of land in the Abu Rummaneh district, a stone’s throw from the electricity company in al-Sakhr Alley, near the famous Havana Cafe´. The Syrian government eventually transformed these lands into an upscale residential quarter in the 1940s. A presidential palace was erected at the top of the street, followed by banks, shops, restaurants and modern buildings with elevators on both sides of Abu Rummaneh. This is where Ahmad Sharabati moved with his family in 1952, into a two-ﬂoor villa behind Jahez Park, which later became the premises of the Papal Embassy in Damascus. Money and material possessions, however, never really mattered to Hajj Uthman. Reputation always came ﬁrst, as he had learned as a child in the spiced alleys of the al-Bzurieh Market. In March 1949, Army Commander Husni al-Za’im came to power in Syria, toppling Hajj Uthman’s old friends – President Shukri al-Quwatli and Prime Minister Khaled al-Azm. His own son, Ahmad, was forced into exile during al-Za’im’s four-month rule in Damascus. Al-Za’im sent an envoy to Hajj Uthman, however, saying that he wanted to discuss politics with the aging notable. Although Hajj Uthman had little affection for rebellious ofﬁcers and particular distaste for Colonel al-Za’im, who had brought down the country’s constitutionally elected president and unleashed a series of disastrous coups, he accepted al-Za’im’s invitation. At the time, Ahmad Sharabati was the licensed agent for General Motors in Syria and owned a brand new yellow 1949 convertible, which people gawked at and took pictures with on the streets of Damascus. The car happened to be parked at the doorstep, so Hajj Uthman drove in it to the Presidential Palace on a hill overlooking Damascus. When al-Za’im saw the car, his jaw dropped in lust. ‘What a beautiful car you have there, Hajj Uthman,’ he said, completely forgetting why he had called him in for an audience in the ﬁrst place. Rudely, he added: ‘Can I keep it?’ Although this man had toppled Syria’s democratic government – one which Hajj Uthman had helped craft with care – and despite the fact that his son was in exile because of him, Hajj Uthman did not object. He just nodded and smiled. When al-Za’im asked if he wanted anything in return, Hajj Uthman\n\n8\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nshook his head, ‘Nothing at all, Your Excellency.’ He simply presented the keys to Husni al-Za’im and went back home.13 The time had not come, he grumbled, when he would let Husni al-Za’im say that the old wise man of Damascus had asked him for a favour. ‘I spent my life extending my hand to others. A hand extended never asks for something in return. A hand that gives, never takes!’\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\nUthman Sharabati belonged to a generation of nation-builders deeply immersed in political life. They led street demonstrations, disappeared when necessary to avoid arrest, issued declarations, bankrolled political parties and helped elect parliamentarians and cabinet ministers. The two Sharabatis never considered themselves politicians; it was almost condescending to describe them as such. Instead, they were called ‘zu’ama,’ or the nationalist leaders of Syria – a rank much higher than that of ‘politician’ in the Syrian political lexicon. A famous example of a za’im was President Hashem al-Atasi, who led the anti-French struggle in the 1930s. He couldn’t conceive himself morphing into a traditional politician, competing for public ofﬁce or taking sides with one party against another. He was a leader of all Syrians, seen by many as ‘grandfather’ of the nation. As a result, when independence was achieved, Hashem al-Atasi willingly took a backseat and retired to his native home in the city of Homs. Hajj Uthman was exactly the same; when the last French troops marched out in 1946, he too retired from public life, claiming that his mission had been accomplished: to see Syria independent. ‘I am not a politician’ he would repeatedly tell his friends, ‘I never was and never will be.’1 Two of his closest friends, however, were frontline statesmen and politicians renowned throughout the Middle East. They had a towering inﬂuence on Syrian politics during the 1920s and a profound inﬂuence on Hajj Uthman’s son.\n\n10\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nFares al-Khoury was a Protestant lawyer the same age as Hajj Uthman, who had served as MP in the Ottoman Parliament and then as the ﬁrst ﬁnance minister in post-Ottoman Syria. Al-Khoury was a brilliant legal mind, a renowned essayist, a mathematician, a gifted poet and an academic who founded and headed the Faculty of Law at Damascus University. In 1920, he helped pen Syria’s royalist constitution and in the mid-1940s he became Syria’s ﬁrst Christian prime minister under President Shukri al-Quwatli. Abdul Rahman Shahbandar, like al-Khoury, was a graduate of the American University of Beirut (AUB). He trained as a medical doctor, and rose to fame during the waning years of the Ottoman Empire. Historians consider him the godfather of secular political thought in modern Syria. Shahbandar worked clandestinely against the Ottomans, joining a military uprising launched against the empire from Mecca, in 1916. Both he and al-Khoury were respected professors at Damascus University (originally named the Syrian University until 1958), and cabinet ministers during the short-lived Arab government of King Faisal I. Shahbandar, a charismatic statesman and impassioned orator, was the last foreign minister of pre-French mandate Syria. Although it might seem remarkable that a conservative like Uthman Sharabati would be so close to two Westernised intellectuals with outspoken views on religion and secularism, this mirrors the social and political matureness of the Damascus elite in the 1920s. Shahbandar was vocal in his criticism of traditional Islam, and often penned articles in Arabic and English criticising mainstream interpretations of the Muslim faith and Holy Quran. He strongly supported the unveiling of women, for example, and challenged views of a state ruled by Islam. Hajj Uthman, of course, frowned upon such unorthodox views, but this didn’t prevent him from remaining exceptionally close to Shahbandar, seeing him as the only ﬁgure worthy of real leadership throughout the turbulent 1920s. Such radical views would one day cost Shahbandar his life, when fanatics gunned him down in the summer of 1940, accusing him of being an atheist and a British spy. So angry was Hajj Uthman with the murder that he put a bounty on the head of the culprits: a staggering 5,000 SP. When the gunmen were apprehended in the orchards of al-Midan, south of the Old City, he promptly paid the money to the man who reported them to Syrian Police.\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n11\n\nThe term ‘Hajj’ means that Uthman Sharabati had performed the sacred Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca – at least once during his lifetime. He never missed prayer time and strictly observed the fast during Ramadan, along with the other pillars of Islam. What mattered to him was not al-Khoury’s religion or Shahbandar’s secular views, but rather what they were doing for the nationalist movement in Syria. Inspired by Shahbandar and al-Khoury, Hajj Uthman sent his son Ahmad to study at AUB in 1924 just like his two friends. In Beirut, Sharabati excelled in mathematics at the International College (AUB’s preparatory school), and was promoted academically in class well beyond his years.2 When visiting home on weekends, Ahmad Sharabati would often join these seasoned adults in in-depth political conversations. Hajj Uthman and his friends analysed the world around them, debating politics, economics, religion, culture and philosophy. Sharabati listened attentively, jotting down mental notes. All ideas were discussed around his father’s dining table, especially when Fares al-Khoury and Abdul Rahman Shahbandar were in the room. Quite unintentionally, they taught him the reality of politics in a way that no university could. Their mentoring was to prove vital for Sharabati’s future career, as were the monumental events that he witnessed ﬁrst-hand as a young man, from a small dormitory room on Bliss Street in Beirut. From there, the young Sharabati watched the birth of an entirely new Middle East. EYEWITNESS TO HISTORY Since 1876, the Ottoman Empire had been ruled by the powerful Sultan Abdulhamid II. The Ottomans themselves had come to Syria in 1516, ejecting the Mamluks from the city. At the time of Hajj Uthman’s birth the empire spanned three continents with a population of approximately twenty-ﬁve million inhabitants.3 They were anything but homogeneous: Turks, Arabs, Persians, Greeks and Armenians were included, along with a combination of Muslims, Christians, Druze and Jews. Sultan Abdulhamid II was an insecure man obsessed with safety, and constantly haunted by memories of his deposed uncles and brother. An assassination attempt in 1905 only added to his fears, sending him into self-imposed isolation behind\n\n12\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nthe high walls of Yildiz Palace. ‘Effendina’ was how the Damascenes referred to Sultan Abdulhamid II, who ruled between the years 1876 and 1909. Hajj Uthman knew no other ruler, as the sultan assumed the throne at the time of Hajj Uthman’s birth. Some remembered him with scorn, others with some affection as he had introduced some modernity to Damascus, like electricity, a tram system and the Hejaz Railway, linking the old capital of the Umayyads to Medina in presentday Saudi Arabia. Sultan Abdulhamid II ruled with an iron grip for thirty long years. He did this with no parliament or constitution, until a military coup forced him to introduce democratic reforms in 1908. That didn’t last long, and soon Ottoman ofﬁcers imposed tight control over the Turkish and Arab press, and stationed secret police on every street corner from Istanbul to Damascus. The Sultan’s spies exchanged information on Ottoman subjects through the modern telegraph system that he had introduced to the empire. World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. The young men of Damascus were hauled off to battle in the dreaded Safarbarlik. Some returned, but thousands perished on the battleﬁeld. Of the 2.8 million sent to ﬁght, 325,000 died in combat between the years 1914 and 1918. Another 240,000 died of disease, while no fewer than 250,000 were listed as ‘missing’ or ‘prisoners of war.’4 Additionally, an estimated 1.5 million deserted the Ottoman Army, ﬁfty per cent of whom were Arab soldiers.5 The grief caused by the massive death toll of the war cast a shadow of fear over the lives of an entire generation of Syrians. Hajj Uthman and his family watched in horror as loved ones and neighbours disappeared behind the front lines of the Ottoman Army, ﬁghting for a cause they did not believe in. The anguish of war was destructive to both the rich and poor in Ottoman Syria, thanks to an Allied embargo of all goods coming into the empire. A sharp decline in heating fuel led entire families in Damascus to spend the winter of 1915 in cold and darkness. As if death and psychological trauma were not enough, a famine broke out in Beirut that same year, and soon crept towards Damascus. It hit Hajj Uthman’s business badly, destroying the annual harvest of apricots and peaches that he dried and exported to Egypt and Palestine. Beirut notables either escaped on European liners before the Port of Beirut was shut down, or came to Damascus for sanctuary.\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n13\n\nThe population of Beirut dropped from 180,000 in 1914 to 75,000 in 1916.6 The US consul in Beirut described its streets in July 1916, saying: ‘They were ﬁlled with starving women and children. In my early evening walks I see people lying dead in the gutter.’7 This nightmare, which Syrians read about in the daily press and heard ﬁrst hand from the inhabitants of Beirut ﬂocking to Damascus, hit Syria next. A Christian pastor from Minneapolis who visited Syria during World War I said that in Damascus people were dying in the streets every single day. ‘Starvation and famine are everywhere’ he wrote, adding that ‘the men of Damascus are either in military service or hiding. The women and children are reduced to beggary.’8 The Damascus police collected no fewer than seventy unidentiﬁed dead bodies daily.9 By October 1917, the crisis had reached as far south as Jerusalem. Years later, Sharabati would close his eyes in pain when recalling images from these years. ‘I saw people digging through garbage, looking for something to eat. Some were eating orange peels – others found nothing to feed off. Many died of hunger right before my very eyes.’10 The anguish and pain of World War I was deeply imprinted in the mind of the young Sharabati. It shaped his personality and that of an entire generation of Arabs. The Great War lasted four painfully long years, and the last Ottoman troops evacuated Damascus at 6:00 am on 26 September 1918. Ironically, this was the very same day they had entered the city 402 years earlier, on 26 September 1516. On 1 October 1918, Arab troops marched into the liberated city, which had been destroyed by four days of looting.11 Emir Faisal, the son of Sharif Hussein of Mecca who had led the revolt against the Ottomans, marched triumphantly into Damascus two days later accompanied by 1,500 horsemen and his British advisor Colonel T.E. Lawrence. Thousands took to the streets to welcome him. Women threw rice and rosewater from balconies and young men danced on the sidewalks, while gunshots were ﬁred into the air from old rusty weapons. Children carrying ﬂags of the Arab Revolt waved for the young Emir. Sharif Hussein’s troops headed toward Marjeh Square in central Damascus and before sunset hoisted the Arab ﬂag over the Damascus Town Hall. Lawrence’s superior ofﬁcer, General Edmund Allenby, made an even more dramatic entrance into the Syrian\n\n14\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\ncapital, wearing his parade uniform and riding in a convertible white Rolls-Royce.12 The Damascenes watched in bewilderment and awe, having never before seen such an automobile. In his classic, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, Colonel Lawrence describes the scene: ‘Every man, woman, and child in this city of a quarter-million souls seemed on the streets, wanting only the spark of our appearance to ignite their spirits. Damascus went mad with joy!’13 Syrians watched the Ottomans leave Damascus in a panic, burying their gold and destroying their weapons. Before making their ﬁnal exit, Ottoman ofﬁcers set their stockpile of ammunition ablaze.14 Lawrence adds: ‘They ﬁred the dumps and ammunition stores, so that every few minutes, we were jangled by explosions, whose ﬁrst shock set the sky white with ﬂames. I turned to (Colonel) Stirling and muttered, “Damascus is burning,” sick to think of the great town in ashes for the price of freedom.’15 One week later, Beirut fell to the Arab Army, followed by Tripoli (in modern-day Lebanon) and Aleppo in the Syrian north. At the Grand Umayyad Mosque of Damascus, prayers were conducted the following Friday in the name of Sharif Hussein, ‘King of the Arabs.’ Emir Faisal declared that an Arab government would be established in Damascus, appointing an ex-Ottoman ofﬁcer, Rida Pasha al-Rikabi, as military governor and prime minister of ‘liberated Syria.’ The young Emir pardoned all those arrested during the Great War, conﬁscated Ottoman property, abolished the Turkish system of education, and packed his new state with Arabs from all stripes and colours to give them a share in nation-building. Fares al-Khoury became Faisal’s ﬁnance minister, and Shahbandar became his adviser, interpreter, and foreign minister. The two men were also voted MPs in the ﬁrst Syrian Parliament. THE MAYSALOUN TRAGEDY A devastating blow for Hajj Uthman and other Syrian nationalists came less than two years later, in July 1920, with the ill-fated Maysaloun Battle and the death of its commander, War Minister Yusuf al-Azma. Little did Ahmad Sharabati know that twenty-eight years later he would become General al-Azma’s third successor at the Ministry of War (by then renamed Ministry of Defence). Yusuf al-Azma was a\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n15\n\nnational hero embodying the values of nationalism in the psyche of all Syrians for generations to come. While growing up, al-Azma was an inspiring ﬁgure for Sharabati. Later in life he would draw parallels between what Yusuf al-Azma went through in the summer of 1920, and his own experience at the very same job, in the spring of 1948. The young General al-Azma was born into a prominent and inﬂuential family in Damascus in 1883. He was energetic and handsome and had studied at the Military Academy in Istanbul. After joining the Ottoman Army, he served in the Caucasus during World War I. When the Ottomans left Syria, al-Azma returned to Damascus, and in May 1920 became minister in the cabinet of Hashem al-Atasi. French troops had already landed on the Syrian coast and were preparing to march on Damascus. On 14 July 1920, the French High Commissioner to Syria, General Henri Gouraud, issued an ultimatum to King Faisal, demanding that he dismantle his government, arrest all anti-French activists, and dissolve the newborn Syrian Army. The king was given a deadline until midnight, 18 July. If no response came, Gouraud noted: ‘We shall have freedom of action.’ Senior ofﬁcers were summoned to the royal palace and asked to give an assessment of the current state of the young Syrian Army. ‘The guns that passed before you during the parades, Your Majesty; we only have a small number of bullets for them. They wouldn’t last for more than an hour on the battleﬁeld.’16 This was the view of Faisal’s senior ofﬁcers. Al-Azma thought otherwise, reporting to the king: ‘We will ﬁght when we are ordered to do so, without thinking about whether we will win or lose.’17 Asked if there were enough weapons for the army, one ofﬁcer replied: ‘The truth is that we don’t have enough weapons. God (praise be to Him) will help by enabling us to capture supplies at the ﬁrst clash between our forces and the French. We will ﬁght the enemy with what we take from them.’18 Based on these facts, Faisal realised that accepting the ultimatum, then improving its terms through negotiations, would certainly be wiser than going to war. Accordingly, he accepted the French dictate. When citizens objected, Faisal had them thrown in jail, and ordered his brother Crown Prince Zaid to crush any uprising.19 Demonstrators were stopped at the gates of the palace, accusing Faisal of treason. The king sent word to Gouraud within the given deadline, but the French general claimed\n\n16\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nthat it had arrived one hour late on 18 July. Gouraud argued that ‘armed bands’ had sabotaged the wires in the Damascus countryside, which accounted for the delay. He used the delay to further advance on Damascus. Al-Azma toured the countryside recruiting troops, and asked Muslim imams to use anti-French rhetoric at mosque pulpits. On 21 July, Faisal sent Education Minister Sati al-Husari to Aley in Mount Lebanon for talks with Gouraud aimed at delaying the mandate, or by some miracle, at cancelling it altogether. ‘You claim that the cable arrived late. One hour late. But it ﬁnally arrived and now that it has, why don’t you order your troops to stop advancing on Damascus?’20 French troops were marching from Shtura and Zahle toward Majdal Anjar and Wadi al-Harir (near the present Syria – Lebanon border), heading straight to the Syrian capital. Gouraud calmly explained: ‘You are not a military man, so you don’t understand the signiﬁcance of certain problems. When an army has begun to move, it cannot just stop anywhere.’21 Al-Husari was sent back home empty-handed. Faisal tried again, this time sending a delegation to meet him at the magniﬁcent Sursock Palace in Beirut. Walking slowly on the palace’s marble ﬂoors, Gouraud bluntly told his Syrian guests: ‘Syria is ours! We have arranged everything with the British.’22 Frantic, Faisal’s government started a contingency plan: how to transfer the capital to Daraa in southern Syria, should the French advance on Damascus and occupy the city.23 Meanwhile, General al-Azma was parading his army through the streets of Damascus, to lift public morale and encourage civilians to volunteer for service. Husari whispered into his ear: ‘Didn’t you say that your troops are ready for war.’ Azma replied: ‘My dear friend, I was blufﬁng, to fool the French.’24 Stunned, Husari remarked: ‘But you can see that things have passed the stage of bluff. We are now facing a real threat. Can we repel the enemy?’ Azma thought hard before replying. ‘Something could have been done at an earlier stage, but now . . . I don’t know.’25 On Saturday, 24 July the battle began at 6:30 am at the Khan Maysaloun pass on the Damascus–Beirut highway, twenty-ﬁve kilometres west of the Syrian capital. The Syrian Army was commanded by General Tahseen Pasha al-Fakir, a friend of Azma and, like him, a native of al-Shaghour. The Syrian Army included over 600 foot soldiers, sixty Royal Guards, twenty cannon soldiers and sixty horsemen,26 and\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n17\n\napproximately 1,500 civilian volunteers. Another 1,700 people volunteered for battle from the summer town of Zabadani near Damascus, but did not show up on the day of the battle, ﬂeeing with the arms that had been distributed to them in advance.27 On the other side, the French Army at Maysaloun stood at a total of 11,000 soldiers with forty-eight cannons, one hundred transport trucks, ﬁfteen tanks and ﬁve aeroplanes.28 Within al-Azma’s camp, soldiers carried old and outdated weapons, some dating back to the Arab Revolt and others to the 1890s. Others carried swords and even slings.29 Yusuf al-Azma, commanding his troops on the battleﬁeld with his service revolver in hand, was wounded in the chest and head when a French tank opened ﬁre on him. He tried crawling back to his original position, as soldiers rushed to save him.30 But it was too late; the Syrian minister of war died on the battleﬁeld at approximately 10:30 am on 24 July 1920. At thirty-six, he was the only ofﬁcer from the Syrian Army to die during the battle. The tiny army on which all Syrians had pinned high hopes had been eliminated completely. It did not re-emerge for another twenty-six years, when Ahmad Sharabati re-created it in preparation for the Palestine War. There are conﬂicting ﬁgures for the death toll at Maysaloun. The British government put it at 2,000 Syrians either wounded or dead, while in a letter of objection to the French, Faisal himself mentioned the ﬁgure 1,500.1 The French lost 800 men, four cannons, and one plane downed in a farm belonging to the Hasibi family near Sabbura, a tiny village in the vicinity of Damascus.31 Sitting behind his ofﬁce desk in the old markets of Damascus, Hajj Uthman heard the horriﬁc news of the battle, emerging slowly from Maysaloun. Bitter and crestfallen, he saw everything he had dreamed of collapse before his eyes. The next day, King Faisal ﬂed Damascus to al-Kisweh, a small town on the outskirts of the Syrian capital. He traveled by automobile; his ministers by train.32 The train cabins were transformed into ofﬁces and sleeping quarters for the king’s entourage.33 He continued to entertain an illusion – that somehow, someway – he could reach an agreement with Gouraud and return to his throne. French aeroplanes dropped leaﬂets on al-Kisweh asking its residents to eject Faisal, or suffer military consequences. He was given twenty-four hours to leave Syria, with orders never to return. Only one of his ministers showed up to bid him farewell.34\n\n18\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nWhen Henri Gouraud marched into the Syrian capital after Maysaloun, some Damascenes even came out to greet him, chanting: ‘Vive la France! Vive Gouraud!’ The sound of thousands of marching boots echoed through the cobbled alleys of Old Damascus. Some opportunists carried Gouraud shoulder-high when he asked to be taken to the tomb of Saladin, the twelfth-century Islamic sultan who fought off Christian crusaders and recaptured Jerusalem. The historic site is located behind the Grand Umayyad Mosque in the Old City. What remained of the city’s elite came out to introduce themselves, ﬂanked by French soldiers, Syrian clergymen and foreign consuls. Gouraud saluted the French ﬂag and decorated soldiers who had fought in Maysaloun. The next day, he attended Sunday Mass and visited the Grand Umayyad Mosque, reminding everybody that he was now fully in control of Syria. Gouraud carved Syria into citystates, creating the modern state of Lebanon, the state of Aleppo, the Sanjak of Alexandretta and the state of Damascus. Maysaloun was a turning point for Syrian nationalists. One battle had been lost, but the war with France was far from over. As Sharabati grew up, he got more and more involved with the Syrian underground, working hard to liberate his country from French occupation. He was a young boy of thirteen when the French took Damascus, and a city notable of thirty-nine when they walked out in defeat twenty-six years later. The infamous battle of Maysaloun convinced most Syrian nationalists that a foreign leader like King Faisal would not do for their country. When certain of his defeat, Faisal just packed up his belongings and left for Europe, begging the British for a throne – any throne – in exchange for the one left behind in Damascus. Ordinary Syrians realised that only local leaders could lead the antiFrench struggle; men of high moral ﬁbre, social standing and a history of resistance against the Ottoman Turks. Instead of breaking national pride and consciousness, Maysaloun actually pulled Syrians together. CHARLES CRANE IN DAMASCUS In April 1922, Shahbandar, al-Khoury and Hajj Uthman hosted US diplomat Charles R. Crane in Damascus. The American visitor had ﬁrst come to Syria in 1919 as part of a commission sent by President\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n19\n\nWoodrow Wilson. It was co-headed by another American, named Henry King, and was charged with inquiring into popular Syrian sentiment regarding a French mandate. Abdul Rahman Shahbandar had talked the US President into sending such a fact-ﬁnding mission when they ﬁrst met at the Paris Peace Conference. It was supposed to include representatives of the four major Allied countries – Great Britain, France, Italy and the USA – but all European states backed out, forcing President Wilson to commission it on his own. King was an educator who taught theology and philosophy at Oberlin College, while Crane was a wealthy philanthropist who knew the Middle East and had helped ﬁnance Wilson’s presidential campaign in 1912. The King-Crane Commission spent six weeks in the region, visiting thirtysix towns and receiving petitions from 1,520 villages. Throughout its short stay in Syria, the commission asked the same questions: ‘What do you think of Great Britain and France?’ and, ‘Do you feel that Syria needs a Western power to help its people march conﬁdently into the twentieth century?’35 The inhabitants of Syria, they estimated, stood at ‘around 1.5 million, meaning twenty-ﬁve people per kilometre.’36 They included 1.2 million Sunnis, 175,000 Christians (Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestant), 6,000 Druze, 25,000 Shiites (Alawites included), 12,000 Jews and 15,000 Ismailis.37 Along with other community leaders, Shahbandar, al-Khoury and Hajj Uthman advised that all peoples once controlled by the Ottoman Empire should become ‘completely and deﬁnitively free.’ They also recommended ‘serious modiﬁcation’ to Zionist ambitions in Palestine. The commission noted, ‘Only two requests – that for a united Syria and independence – had larger support.’ On 1 July 1919, Hajj Uthman was invited to attend a meeting of the Shura Council at the Abed Building in Marjeh Square, chaired by Council President Mohammad Fawzi Pasha al-Azm. A wide assortment of city notables was present, including al-Khoury and Shahbandar. Collectively, the attendees presented a ten-point declaration to the King-Crane Commission, which was later known as the Damascus Programme. They acknowledged Emir Faisal I as the ﬁrst post-Ottoman ruler of Syria, strongly denounced Zionist claims in Palestine and rejected the idea of a French or British mandate in the Middle East. The most striking thing the Syrians told the commission was that although they refused a\n\n20\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nEuropean mandate, they would nevertheless welcome an American one, believing that America would tutor, rather than conquer, the people of the East. Of the 1,863 petitions received, 1,084 asked for a US mandate in Syria.38 After much delay, the King-Crane Commission ﬁnally published its report in 1922, but by then it was too late for Syria. French tanks had already rumbled through Damascus, fully occupying the city in the summer of 1920. Although Wilson remained in ofﬁce until March 1921, he was incapacitated after suffering a severe stroke in 1919 and therefore he did not stand up in Syria’s defence that summer. His illness worsened shortly after the King-Crane Commission returned from Syria. No follow-up of the commission’s ﬁndings took place and, eager to see an end to the troublesome US president and his anti-colonial agenda, France and Great Britain went ahead with their plans for the Middle East. Wilson was now useless to Arab nationalists and his successor, Warren Harding, a newspaper publisher and senator from Ohio, was clearly uninterested in the Middle East. Two years later, Crane decided to visit Syria once again, to see how the country was faring under French occupation. On 1 April 1922, AUB President Edward Nickoley sent word to Shahbandar that Crane was coming to Damascus as a private citizen, ‘to meet old friends.’39 Crane arrived by train, via Haifa, on 5 April. Shahbandar wrote to Hajj Uthman, ‘Don’t go to sleep until all his meetings are arranged.’40 Hajj Uthman facilitated Crane’s tour of the capital, taking him to Sunday Mass at a church in Bab Touma and to visit Fares al-Khoury at his home in al-Qassa, the Christian neighbourhood of Damascus. Hajj Uthman also arranged for Crane to visit the conservative al-Midan, Shaghour and Qanawat neighbourhoods, both within and beyond the walled city. Accompanying him were future prime minister Hasan al-Hakim, Ismail Tabbakh and Hajj Uthman’s son-in-law, Rashid Bakdounes.41 Hajj Uthman suggested holding all future meetings at his home, ‘because hotels are ﬁlled with spies and informers.’42 That evening, city elders met at Hajj Uthman’s house, including three clerics, a handful of artisans and the merchants Abdul Hamid al-Attar, Abdullah al-Kuzbari and Kamal al-Halabi. Hajj Uthman also invited the widows of Syrian nationalists executed by the Ottoman Turks in Marjeh Square back in 1916.\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n21\n\nShahbandar addressed the political grievances of the Syrian people and Hajj Uthman spoke of their economic woes. Hajj Uthman talked about the trade barriers that were killing industry in Syria. Before World War I, Syria used to export an annual 1.5 million Turkish pounds’ worth of silk, textiles and food to Palestine, Egypt and the Hejaz.43 ‘Collectively, the ancient textile industry used to employ 30,000 families. This industry has come to a halt, because of the artiﬁcial borders that carved up our country.’44 Additionally, Damascus used to beneﬁt from Muslim pilgrims arriving from Persia, Turkey and Afghanistan, who came annually to take the Hejaz railway to Medina and then Mecca. They stayed at Damascus hotels and shopped at its bazaars, generating an estimated 500,000 Turkish pounds annually for the city’s treasury.45 The Great Powers truncated the 2,000-kilometre railway after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which left Syria in control of no more than 150 kilometres.46 The rest went to Transjordan, Palestine and the Kingdom of the Hejaz. Because of custom barriers imposed by the French, Muslim pilgrims now preferred making the holy pilgrimage via the Red Sea port of Jeddah, rather than Damascus.47 Hajj Uthman also criticised the taxation system imposed under the French mandate. ‘For the past twenty years, I used to pay an annual income tax of 50 quroush (piasters) to government authorities. Now, we are still in the ﬁrst quarter of the year, and I have paid 17,000 quroush to the French government.’48 The money being collected was ostensibly being used to build bridges and a telegraph line to the ancient city of Palmyra in the Syrian Desert, he added. ‘In reality, however, they are stealing the gold and riches of Syria. This explains why the price of gold has gone sky high over the past two years.’49 Hajj Uthman then took out a list of salaries paid by the French government to its agents and prote´ge´s in the Syrian civil service. The salary of the Damascus governor Haqqi al-Azm, he noted, was 360 SP monthly. ‘One Ottoman pound today equals 2.5 Syrian pounds.’50 ‘Under the Ottomans, the vali of Damascus used to get 150 Ottoman pounds per month. This of course was when the vilayet of Damascus included Homs, Hama, Tripoli and Beirut. Haqqi Bey is being paid twice as much, while he rules territory half the size of the original Ottoman vali.’51 This meant a huge drain on the Syrian government’s treasury, he said, which would soon lead to\n\n22\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\ncertain bankruptcy. Additionally, Haqqi al-Azm was making 8,500 SP annually ‘for protocol and festivities’ and 6,000 SP for travel expenses, in addition to 400 SP for newspaper subscriptions. ‘Meaning, the governor of Damascus accounts for 20,000 SP monthly – a staggering number, considering that the country is in debt and people live in crippling poverty.’52 Hajj Uthman added that French professors were being paid double the salary of Syrian academics at the Faculties of Law and Medicine (which one year later would form the nucleus of the Syrian University). A French academic was making 1,000–1,200 piasters per month, while Syrians were making no more than 500. ‘Do note that twenty-ﬁve per cent of the male population of Damascus and Aleppo alone are unemployed, Mr. Crane. Many of them are university graduates.’53 Everywhere he went, Crane heard uniform grievances: political repression, nepotism, embezzlement, corruption and economic disaster. Shahbandar angrily added, ‘Less developed countries like the Philippines are about to get independence from the United States, while we in Syria might get stuck with the French forever!’54 The moment Crane ended his two-day visit the French authorities had Shahbandar arrested. He was charged with receiving funds from the US government to topple the mandate government in Syria.55 Fares alKhoury defended him before French courts, to no avail. Shahbandar was sentenced to twenty years of hard labour for the possession of US$2,000 found on him. The amount, he claimed, was scholarship money made out in his name by Crane, to send two schoolgirls to university in the USA. One of them, Alice Qandalaft, was a Christian writer and activist from Damascus. In 1948 she became the ﬁrst Arab woman at the United Nations, serving on a diplomatic delegation headed by Prime Minister Fares al-Khoury. The other was Nazeq al-Abed, the daughter of Damascus notable Mustapha Pasha al-Abed, who chaired a women’s NGO and had founded a ﬁrst aid organisation, the Red Star, predecessor to the Syrian Red Crescent. In this humanitarian capacity, Nazeq al-Abed had joined the Syrian Army at Maysaloun in 1920. She had a profound effect on Crane but turned down his grant to study in the USA, recommending one of her students instead. One day after Shahbandar’s arrest, an estimated 8,000 men gathered at the Umayyad Mosque to hear impassioned speeches in\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n23\n\nhis defence. By the time Friday prayer was over, the crowd had reached 10,000 and broke out of the Grand Mosque, heading towards the Citadel of Damascus where Shahbandar and his comrades were being held. They marched through the Hamidieh Bazaar carrying portraits of Shahbandar and, armed with knives, slingshots and sticks, they threatened to liberate him by force. A French garrison immediately dispersed the crowd, arresting forty-six Damascenes. The same pattern was repeated daily until 10 April, when the demonstrators adopted a new approach. This time, forty women headed by Shahbandar’s wife, Sarah Mouayyad al-Azm, took part in the demonstration against the French. Prosperous merchants in the marketplace, headed by Hajj Uthman, all shut down their establishments in solidarity with Dr Shahbandar. Many women marched unveiled, while some ululated at high pitch, chanting slogans calling for the long life of Shahbandar and Charles Crane. Once again, the French intervened, arresting thirty-six people.56 FUNDING AND FOUNDING THE PEOPLE’S PARTY Shahbandar was eventually released, after spending seventeen months in jail, and embarked on an ambitious project: establishing the ﬁrst political party in French-mandate Syria. It was to be called the People’s Party and its goal was to create a constitutional monarchy in Damascus after liberating the country from foreign control and reuniting the whole of Syria. The founding conference was hosted at Sharabati’s home, put under Shahbandar’s service for the occasion.57 In May 1925, he came knocking on Hajj Uthman’s door, asking him to join the People’s Party Political Committee. In addition to himself, it included Fares alKhoury, the Paris-trained politician Jamil Mardam Bey and Deputy President of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce Lutﬁ al-Haffar. All three of them, al-Khoury, Mardam Bey and al-Haffar, were to become future prime ministers of Syria. Hajj Uthman politely turned down the offer. In one of his letters to Hasan al-Hakim, at the time working as a banker in Palestine, Shahbandar wrote: ‘It’s no use. We tried our best with our big brother Hajj Uthman. He refuses to speak to the press, run for public ofﬁce, or to join our party. We tried everything, with no luck!’58\n\n24\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nThree hundred and ﬁfty politicians, bureaucrats and retired ofﬁcers from the Ottoman Army were joining Dr Shahbandar. The party called for the uniﬁcation of Syrian lands, reuniting the Alawite and Druze districts that had been detached into autonomous regions in 1920, and the eventual unity of Greater Syria. To show his support, Hajj Uthman donated money to the new party – a total of 150 Syrian pounds.59 Hajj Uthman advised Shahbandar to buy shares in the party’s name in order to generate periodic revenue. ‘Don’t rely on membership fees or donations. One day they will dry up. Invest money, and give the party an economic lifeline of its own.’60 At the launch in June 1925, al-Khoury and Shahbandar took turns at the podium, stressing the secular cross-sectarian character of their new party, arguing that religion and politics shouldn’t mix. Making use of Hajj Uthman’s advice, Shahbandar charged no membership fee, making the People’s Party accessible to a large segment of Syrian youth who for ﬁnancial reasons were unable to join parties that charged upfront membership fees. At Hajj Uthman’s urging, he bought shares for the party in the newly established Ayn al-Fijeh Water Company, a money-generating enterprise bringing clean spring water to the homes of Damascus. It was the ﬁrst public-private partnership enterprise in Syria, relieving the burden on the River Barada which until then had been used for both irrigation and drinking, and would provide fresh drinking water to the citizens of Damascus for years to come. The People’s Party, inspiring as it was, was a very short-lived project. It died a few months later, after the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925. THE AUB AND MIT INFLUENCE While all of this was happening back home, Sharabati was completing high school in Beirut and preparing to join the prestigious American University of Beirut, probably at the advice of his father’s friends, Shahbandar and Fares al-Khoury. Both had studied and taught at AUB and often stressed that the university had a profound effect on their life and careers; it was the only institution in the entire Middle East left unscathed by the anguish of war and occupation. Originally named the Syrian Protestant College, it opened its doors to students in December 1866, changing its name to AUB in 1920. Although\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n25\n\nestablished by Daniel Bliss, a Christian missionary from the USA, AUB sought to serve ‘all conditions and classes of men without regard to colour, nationality, race or religion.’ AUB’s transition to secularism had started to bear fruit from the late nineteenth century, when Shahbandar led a student demonstration on campus, objecting to mandatory Sunday Mass at the university’s church. Later, AUB’s chapel was transformed into a secular lecture room, now called the Assembly Hall. By the time Sharabati joined its student body, AUB was already ﬁfty-nine years old and had earned a reputation for liberal education, secularism and ﬁrebrand nationalism. In future years, celebrated Syrian ﬁgures were to study at AUB including President Nazem al-Qudsi, the world-famous novelist Ghada al-Samman, the historian Constantine Zureik and poet Omar Abu Risheh. So did leaders of the Palestinian resistance, George Habash and Wadih Haddad, and Lebanese Prime Minister Saeb Salam. Lawrence of Arabia noted in his memoirs that ‘quite unintentionally, AUB taught revolution.’ AUB created a space where intellectual discovery could ﬂourish, helping develop the character of its students, enhancing their values and empowering their civic engagement. Because it was an American institution on Lebanese soil neither the Ottoman Turks nor the French could really meddle with its curriculum, enabling Arab students to bond and exchange bold ideas about revolution and nation-building. Sharabati spent one year at AUB before taking the unusual decision of traveling to the USA to complete his studies in mechanical engineering at the world-reputed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating in 1928. Travelling to the USA by boat, and studying at one of its top universities, was a complete novelty for Damascus; no other young man of his generation had even visited the USA, much less gone there to study. MIT adopted a polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied sciences and engineering. It was chartered during the American Civil War and, by the time Sharabati joined in the mid-1920s, MIT boasted a huge 168-acre campus addressing rapid scientiﬁc and technological advances. At MIT, Sharabati led an academically oriented life that was strikingly different from the one back home. He started developing into an athletic young man; playing football, tennis and bowling. He also swam weekly,\n\n26\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\na habit he learned during his time at AUB where he swam from alManara to the Pigeon’s Rock along the coastline of Beirut. Despite his young age, Sharabati was starting to develop into a full-ﬂedged nationalist in his own right; inﬂuenced by his father, no doubt, yet independent of Hajj Uthman, and very different. AUB and MIT introduced Sharabati to the modern world and how it was operating; a world very different from the one left behind by the Ottomans in Syria. MIT gave Sharabati the intellectual depth, scientiﬁc knowledge and cosmopolitan education that made him stand out among his peers in Syria. The MIT experience helped him revamp Damascus University in 1943 when he was minister of education, and his training in aeronautical and mechanical engineering helped him excel ﬁve years later at the Ministry of Defence. It also gave him a ﬁrst-hand understanding of American politics that no other Syrian politician had, making his advice all the more important in Damascus during the Cold War. He soon returned to his native Damascus and found himself walking in his father’s footsteps. Upon retirement, Hajj Uthman left behind a vast business empire, a solid reputation on the streets of Syria, and big shoes that Ahmad Sharabati was expected to ﬁll in the Syrian resistance. It wasn’t going to be easy, coming at the heels of the Great Syrian Revolt and the world economic depression of 1929. Intellectually and politically, however, Sharabati was ready for the job. BIRTH OF A POLITICAL CLASS The ‘Founding Fathers’ of Syria were brought together, perhaps unintentionally, by a common fate imposed by the monumental events of World War I and its immediate aftermath. Resistance to Ottoman rule and the anguish of the Great War were turning points in their careers, as was the failure of the Faisal government and the French occupation after Maysaloun. This generation watched the rapid collapse of three empires after World War I and the birth of new countries, like Syria. Arab historians have commonly grouped them as ‘Al-Rae’el al-Awal’ or the First Generation, in reference to men like Hajj Uthman, Shahbandar, Hashem al-Atasi, Shukri al-Quwatli and Fares alKhoury. None of them were trained as politicians but learned to operate in the complex web of Middle East politics via trial and error; marked by\n\nDamascus Occupied\n\n27\n\na painful learning curve of rapid intellectual evolution. They are categorised as Ottoman-trained or -inﬂuenced, born in the mid- to late nineteenth century, socially conservative and intellectually charged by the philosophical and ideological trends of their time and era: Arabism, Ottomanism and Islam. While growing up, these ﬁgures identiﬁed themselves as Ottoman subjects before discovering their Arab identity, and only after middle age did they start describing themselves as ‘Syrian citizens.’ Sharabati’s generation sometimes referred to, as ‘Al-Ra’el alThani’ is the one that played no role during this crucial period of modern Arab history, but was tremendously inﬂuenced by it. They used its grave injustices as a catalyst to lead the resistance against French and British colonialism during the inter-war years, empowered by modern education, exposure to mass media, modern travel like aeroplanes and trains and the liberal thought that came with collapse of the Ottoman order. They used their university education – in law, engineering and medicine – to generate income, develop their societies and to tackle the resistance with a more ‘scientiﬁc approach’ that was notably different from that of the ﬁrst generation. They were born Syrian and lived by this national and political identity. The grand injustice done to Syrian nationalists only empowered Sharabati and his peers, giving them ammunition to pursue their goals. All the sacriﬁces of the ﬁrst generation could not have been in vain, they argued. One battle had been lost, they prophesied, but the war with France was far from over. Their audacity lifted the spirits of the entire Syrian nation in the years to come.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\nIn 1925, a delegation of Druze notables, most of them religious leaders, traveled to Damascus for a meeting with the new French High Commissioner, Maurice Sarrail. A stern ofﬁcer and avowed atheist, Sarrail had no time for local complaints, particularly from clerics.1 He viewed Christian priests, Sunni imams, and Druze sheikhs with equal disdain, mocking their ways and religious beliefs.2 He refused to respond to any of their requests and, after they left, took steps he thought would silence the Druze once and for all. He invited the same delegation to return for another meeting in Damascus. When they showed up, he had them arrested and sent to the notorious Palmyra prison in the Syrian Desert.3 This treachery reverberated throughout Syrian society and aroused fury in the Druze Mountain. Even the British consul in Damascus remarked that this was not how sophisticated European generals ought to handle colonial affairs, adding that it reminded him of Turkish ‘methods of deception.’4 On 18 July 1925, Druze ﬁghters opened ﬁre on a French plane circling the Druze Mountain. The conﬂict escalated and by the end of July, the French had 10,000 troops stationed in the Mountain, whose entire population did not exceed 50,000.5 General Roger Michaud was sent to the Druze Mountain to force Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and his Druze ﬁghters into submission. On 2 August, the French forces were attacked by al-Atrash’s men: fourteen were killed, 385 were wounded, 432 troops were taken hostage and 2,000 riﬂes\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n29\n\nwere captured.6 Michaud himself ﬂed the scene and, in disgrace, his second-in-command committed suicide after being defeated by the Druze.7 The 2,000 riﬂes were distributed to al-Atrash’s men and thousands ﬂocked to his rebel army. By late August, this army was estimated at 10,000 men, equal to the number of French troops stationed in the Druze Mountain.8 At ﬁrst, the Syrian capital was indifferent to the Druze uprising, but the city’s elite could not ignore it. Soon young men from the Damascus countryside were taking up arms and pledging support for Sultan al-Atrash, putting the city’s nationalists in danger of becoming politically irrelevant. On 21 August 1925, Hajj Uthman called for a secret meeting at his residence in al-Salhieh. The invitation and location of the meeting was conveyed to each participant through a shoe-shine stationed by the Cinema Ghazi, behind the Grand Serail in Marjeh Square.9 This is where Shahbandar’s men would come to receive secret instructions, while casually having their shoes shined. They were instructed to arrive at speciﬁc times, to avoid arousing suspicion. ‘Preferably come walking – please don’t take a taxi or carriage.’10 By 6:00 pm, the gathering was complete. Chairing the meeting was Shahbandar himself, ﬂanked by his brother-in-law Nazih Mouayyad al-Azm on the left and Hajj Uthman on the right. Seated around the table were the Bakri brothers Nasib and Fawzi, Fares alKhoury, Jamil Mardam Bey and Hasan al-Hakim.11 The Bakris were sons of a Damascene aristocrat who had served at Sultan Abdulhamid II’s court. Nasib al-Bakri was an established leader who had served as Damascus MP in Faisal’s Parliament. Jamil Mardam Bey had served as Shahbandar’s assistant at the Foreign Ministry and al-Hakim was Shahbandar’s right-hand-man in the People’s Party. All of them were co-founders of al-Fatat, the leading underground movement that worked to bring down the Ottoman Empire. Fares al-Khoury, Jamil Mardam Bey and Hassan al-Hakim would later become prime ministers. That evening, they decided to bring the Druze revolt to Damascus. The men swore on their honour to ‘never rest until Syria is freed from all foreign intervention.’12 Hajj Uthman briefed them about support within the old souqs of Damascus, saying that thirty-six merchants were ready to offer ﬁnancial backing for the insurgency.\n\n30\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nOne of them, Yusuf Linadu, was Jewish, while the others were Sunni Muslims and Christians.13 Shahbandar added that friends of his wife had sent him their jewellery to sell in order to buy arms for the rebels. Hajj Uthman bought them all for 200 gold coins and then asked Shahbandar to return the jewellery to its generous owners, saying that the price of 200 gold coins would be his downpayment for the Damascus revolt.14 The list of women donors included Naziq al-Abed, the daughter of Mustapha Pasha al-Abed; Subhiya Tanneer, the director of an all-girls school in Arnous; a wealthy Kurdish lady from the Shamdin Agha family; and Mrs Shahbandar herself, Sarrah Mouayyad al-Azm. Two other women took part in the rebellion. The ﬁrst, Aziza Husrieh, was commissioned to spy on French ofﬁcers and collaborators, while Rashida al-Zebak was tasked with distributing riﬂes in the Damascus countryside.15 Shahbandar thanked Hajj Uthman and then assigned roles to those in the clandestine group. He would serve as the Damascus rebellion’s leader. Hajj Uthman would be its main fundraiser and coordinator. Al-Khoury, Mardam Bey and al-Hakim would be political advisers while al-Bakri would be their liaison with the rebels in the Druze Mountain and al-Ghouta. None of them had ever carried a riﬂe in their lives, but they were committed to realising their dream of a free Syria. Using mules and arms provided by Hajj Uthman, Shahbandar and two of his men went to the Druze Mountain to brief Sultan Pasha and coordinate their strategy with the Druze commanders. To throw off French intelligence, they spent the night in disguise at Hosh alMatban, a small village in al-Ghouta, and then moved to the summer resort of Bloudan, ﬁfty-one kilometres northwest of Damascus.16 From there, they traveled to Suweida by taxi, pretending to be agricultural experts from the municipality of Damascus. Shahbandar swore to dedicate himself fully to the revolt, closing his private clinic in Damascus to take up arms with the Druze rebellion and putting himself and his family at the Pasha’s disposal. The French responded with brutal force. First, they outlawed the People’s Party, arrested many of Shahbandar’s allies and inﬂicted harsh collective punishment on the Damascus countryside, burning homes, bombing villages and shooting anyone with ties to Shahbandar. Rebels in the countryside were already attacking French\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n31\n\npolice stations at night and cutting telephone and telegraph lines to and from Damascus.17 All People’s Party documents were conﬁscated, and on 27 August three ranking party members – Fares al-Khoury, Ihsan al-Sharif and Abdul Majid Tabbakh – were bundled into cars and taken to the Arwad Prison off the coast of Tartous.18 Fakhri al-Barudi, another ally of Hajj Uthman, was arrested at his home in al-Qanawat in the heart of the old city, as was the brilliant attorney Fawzi al-Ghazzi, a professor at the Damascus University Faculty of Law.19 Joining the rebellion was an enormous departure for these seasoned politicians who had built their careers on political engagement rather than military resistance; refusing, for example, to take up arms against the Ottomans during World War I. Their opposition to military rule had been based on constitutionalism, democracy and rule of law. On 23 August, pink and blue handbills were distributed in Damascus, signed by ‘Sultan al-Atrash, commander-in-chief of the Syrian Revolt.’ Printed at Ibn Zaydun Press by Fakhri al-Barudi, the leaﬂets were scattered in the streets at night, to be picked up and read by locals the next morning. The declaration began: To Arms! To Arms! Oh sons of glorious Arabs! Let us seek death that we may win life. Syrians; remember your forefathers, your history, your heroes, your martyrs, your national honour. Remember that the hand of God is with you and that the will of the people is the will of God.20\n\nThe document took the Damascenes by surprise. It called for the complete independence of ‘Arab Syria.’ Emancipation was a national demand, and so were a democratically elected government, a parliament and a constitution. The declaration demanded that Syrians be given the same ‘rights given to Frenchmen after the French Revolution.’21 Damascus was being pulled out of its slumber and into a military confrontation it had avidly tried to avoid since 1920. For his part, Hajj Uthman continued to send money to the al-Ghouta orchards – or what remained of them – ﬁnancing countryside rebels from his own fortune. Hajj Uthman also contacted his trusted friend, Shahbandar’s political rival, Shukri al-Quwatli, who transformed his Bala village in al-Ghouta into a storehouse for ammunition and a shelter for rebels escaping the French dragnet. When the French heard of the arms arriving in Bala, they bulldozed the village to the\n\n32\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nground. Hajj Uthman’s allowance to the rebels varied from half a gold pound to two gold pounds per month.22 From his hideout in the Druze Mountain, Shahbandar sent a bundle of letters to Hajj Uthman in Damascus, asking him to send them on. One was addressed to President Calvin Coolidge at the White House and another to Pope Pius XI at the Vatican. Shahbandar was pleading with them for international intervention to ‘save the people of Syria.’23 The French intercepted the letters and went after Hajj Uthman who, remarkably, did not blink when he learned the couriers were arrested. To avoid raising French suspicion, he had carried on with his daily routine, walking along the same streets and meeting the same people at his home every evening. Shortly after dawn on 1 September 1925, Senegalese soldiers serving in the French Army of the Levant burst into Hajj Uthman’s house, smashing the front door and windows with their bayonets. ‘Ou est Hajj Osman?’ they shouted as they searched the house, room by room, destroying furniture and mirrors as they went along. When he was dragged out in chains, he found that the Bab Touma notable Tawﬁq Shamiya was already in French custody. The two men were ﬁrst taken to the state dungeon in al-Hassakeh, in the far northeastern corner of the country. Two weeks later, they were escorted at gunpoint to Arwad.24 This is where Hajj Uthman spent the next two years, in a small damp cell, shared with three prisoners from Aleppo: Saadallah al-Jabiri, Salah al-Din al-Jabiri and AUB-trained medical doctor Abdul Rahman al-Kayyali.25 They were prevented from sleeping for days on end by having cold water thrown on their face as they began to fall asleep. They were strapped down on wooden benches while droplets of water fell on their forehead every minute in an attempt to drive them mad. Prison guards swore at them and threatened to arrest members of their family if they did not lead them to the whereabouts of Abdul Rahman Shahbandar. None of them ever stood trial but were held on charges of ‘high treason’ against the mandate regime. As of 2018, a marble slab still stands at Arwad Prison with the names of Syrian nationalists who had served time there during the Great Syrian Revolt. Ninth on the list is Hajj Uthman Sharabati.\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n33\n\nTHE FIRST SHELLING OF DAMASCUS While Hajj Uthman was in jail, chaos broke out in Damascus. On 18 October 1925, approximately 400 armed horsemen marched into the Syrian capital, on orders from Shahbandar, and headed for the Azm Palace in the heart of the Old City.26 One hundred of them, led by the nationalist leader Nasib al-Bakri, entered the old alleys from al-Qaboon, a suburb six kilometres northeast of Damascus. Two hundred were commanded by a night guard from the orchards of alShaghour named Hasan al-Kharrat and the remaining one hundred were from al-Ghouta.27 The eighteenth-century Ottoman governors of Syria had used the ancient Azm Palace, with all its treasures, as their home, and the French had used it as lodgings for senior personnel since 1920. Shahbandar had believed a rumour that Maurice Sarrail would be arriving from Beirut to spend the day at the palace.28 The rebels had orders to arrest the French High Commissioner to be traded later for hundreds of Syrian prisoners the French were holding. Sarrail, however, did not come to Damascus that day. In his memoirs, however, Shahbandar insists that Sarrail was at the Azm Palace but escaped in an armoured vehicle when the rebels approached.29 Whatever the case, French forces sealed off the Old City and bombs began shelling the Azm Palace. Damascus merchants literarily begged the rebels to leave the city, to no avail. The shelling continued non-stop for two days.30 Nearly every shop in the old market surrounding the Umayyad Mosque was destroyed either by machine-gun ﬁre or shelling. The Midhat Pasha and Bzurieh markets, just outside the gates of the Azm Palace, were the worst hit, followed by the al-Midan and Shaghour Markets.31 Nearly one hundred metres of the Hamidieh Market roof were destroyed, collapsing onto the small shops inside.32 The streets of the Old City, usually swarming with commercial activity, were covered with shattered glass, destroyed merchandise and remains of the dead. In the areas of Bab al-Jabieh, al-Kharabeh and Shaghour, 150 homes were destroyed beyond repair.33 The intense shelling led to the death of 1,416 Syrians and the displacement of 336 others.34 A delegation from the Damascus Chamber of Commerce led by Lutﬁ al-Haffar visited General Sarrail, demanding an immediate ceaseﬁre.\n\n34\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nSarrail said he would only agree to stop the onslaught if an astronomical ﬁne was imposed on the city, as punishment for having supported Shahbandar, and if all arms were surrendered to French authorities within four days. The delegation refused.35 FUNDRAISING FOR THE REVOLT Shukri al-Quwatli was among the few Syrian nationalists who evaded jail during the revolt, ﬂeeing to Egypt before the French issued a warrant for his arrest. From Cairo, he gathered a small team to help him raise funds across the Arab world and even as far away as North America. It included Mohammad Ali Taher, the Palestinian publisher of the political daily Al-Shoura, Syrian journalist Muhib al-Din al-Khatib, Abdul-Aziz al-Thaalbi, leader of the Tunisian movement Tunis al-Fatat and the Mufti of Jerusalem, Hajj Amin al-Husseini, who raised 13,000 pounds for relief work in Syria from wealthy Palestinians.36 In Cairo, the celebrated Egyptian nationalist Mustapha Nahhas Pasha, head of the Wafd Party, donated one hundred pounds in support of the Syrian revolt.37 In the USA, al-Quwatli opened a relief ofﬁce in Oklahoma, and Syrian-Americans opened another four, in Detroit, Chicago, Washington DC and Louisville. Soon, international newspapers were referring to the Damascus events as a ‘French massacre.’ The French press accused Sarrail of being a ‘despot’ who was ‘liquidating Syria.’ Worried that anti-French sentiment would spread to North Africa, Paris recalled General Sarrail in late 1925. Onboard the Sphinx, the Egyptian liner that took him back to France, the disgraced Sarrail spoke to a journalist from Le Petit Parisien on 10 November 1925. ‘What could have I done? Given the city over to the bandits? Attempted to ﬁght them on the streets? Should I have appeared on the balcony and addressed the crowd? Or should I have done nothing and allowed Christians to be slaughtered as in 1860?’38 When Sarrail arrived in Paris, demonstrators marched outside his home shouting ‘Assassin!’39 General Sarrail was replaced by Henri de Jouvenel, the ﬁrst civilian to hold the post of French High Commissioner. A journalist by training, he had been editor of the popular newspaper Le Matin before coming to Syria in late November 1925. Eager to put an end to the\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n35\n\nconﬂict, de Jouvenel offered Syrian rebels an honourable exit, promising not to arrest them or punish them in any way if they lay down their arms. All of them had been ‘fooled’ into taking up arms by Shahbandar and al-Atrash, he claimed, and called on them to ‘return to their senses and realise that change cannot happen through military force.’40 Some of them were pardoned, and de Jouvenel began approaching moderates like Fares al-Khoury and Lutﬁ al-Haffar, promising to respond to their political demands if they would help him end the revolt. ‘What do you want? A constitutional assembly? A parliament? A government? Take all of that, and you will be considered partners in the new Syria. All I want from you is to use your inﬂuence to call on the bandits to lay down their arms and have faith in French justice.’41 In 1927, de Jouvenel released Hajj Uthman from jail, whose name had twice been excluded from amnesty lists announced by the mandate regime.42 By this time, however, the French felt conﬁdent enough to completely turn the page with Syria’s nationalists. The country’s new French-appointed head of state, Damad Ahmad Nami, invited Hajj Uthman for an audience on 15 November 1927.43 A Circassian aristocrat from Beirut, Nami was the son-in-law of Sultan Abdulhamid II. He came to power with the intention of ending the revolt, reaching an agreement with the nationalists, and rebuilding Syria through reconciliation committees and a massive reconstruction programme bankrolled by Syrian industrialists. The Damad (which means son-in-law of the sultan in Ottoman Turkish) invited Hajj Uthman to join the central reconciliation committee, headed by Sheikh Badr al-Din al-Hasani, the leading Islamic scholar of his generation in Syria and respected throughout the Muslim world. Hajj Uthman accepted the offer. His ﬁrst mission was to travel to Amman for talks with the exiled Sultan Pasha al-Atrash.44 Hajj Uthman was asked to ﬁnd middle ground with the Druze leader – either a temporary or comprehensive ceaseﬁre – in exchange for a general amnesty for him and Shahbandar. Both men refused and remained in exile until 1937. As the talks stagnated, military operations continued. By mid1927, de Jouvenel had asserted French control over the Damascus countryside – at horriﬁc cost in human life – and had driven all the\n\n36\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nDruze warriors across the border into Transjordan. After turning down the French offer, both Shahbandar and al-Atrash were sentenced to death. Devastated by this turn of events, Hajj Uthman moved to Cairo, politely apologising to Sheikh al-Hasani, saying that he couldn’t carry on with reconciliation talks given France’s refusal to allow Shahbandar and al-Atrash to return home. His stance infuriated French authorities. By the end of 1927 the revolt, which had become the symbol Syrian nationalism and chivalry, had been squashed. Approximately 150,000 were left unemployed, representing ﬁfteen to twenty per cent of the labour force.45 Hajj Uthman and his friends had to come up with creative ways to ease the suffering of the people of Syria. It wasn’t going to be easy, with him now living in Egypt and with other nationalist leaders either in exile or jail. Damascus lay in ruins, its countryside completely destroyed and its national movement eradicated. LIFE IN EGYPT A few months after arriving in Cairo, Hajj Uthman was joined by his son, who had just completed his studies at MIT in the summer of 1928. Ahmad Sharabati arrived in Cairo with big dreams, boundless ambition and an outpouring of bitterness at what the French had done to his father and his country. Hajj Uthman had lost weight from his years in jail, with poor – if any – medical treatment. A car accident in Egypt had injured his leg and left him with a permanent limp, which made him look older than his ﬁfty years.46 Ahmad Sharabati soon developed a veracious appetite for politics. At only 21, he found himself immersed among Arab nationalists of all stripes and colours. Egypt was going through its own democratic transition, which the two Sharabatis witnessed ﬁrst-hand. Egypt’s ﬁrst elected parliament opened in March 1924, while Syria had no parliament and was ruled with an iron French ﬁst. Anti-colonial revolutions were happening around the world, and no doubt this inﬂuenced the young Syrian rebel. In Egypt, a revolt had broken out against the British less than ten years earlier, led by Saad Zaghloul Pasha, and its aftershocks could still be felt throughout Egyptian society. Ahmad Sharabati believed that since the Syrians had been able to crush the\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n37\n\nOttoman Turks they would, one day, also be able to defeat the French. It was only a matter of time and patience. His idealism was born of a mythical Syrian nationalism. He failed to realise that it was the British who had led the expulsion of the Ottomans from Syria, not the will and might of the Syrian people alone. As it developed, it was the British who would drive the French from Syria twenty years later. Ahmad Sharabati’s ﬁrst exile was not his own doing; he was paying the price for his father’s role in what came to be known as the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925. Cairo, however, initiated him into the complex and controversial world of Arab politics, introducing him to high-calibre politicians often twenty to thirty years his senior, similar to the calibre of men he had met at his father’s house in Damascus. Shahbandar also had moved to Cairo and was a regular guest at the Sharabati home. Egypt’s inter-war status as a centre for Arab nationalist activity, along with its rich culture, cosmopolitan community, liberal environment and large number of Syrian refugees, made it a perfect venue for the young Sharabati. Collectively, Egyptians called Syrian e´migre´s shawam. In addition, Egypt was less oppressive than most Arab capitals at the time – certainly less so than Damascus, Beirut or Jerusalem. The Syrian community in Cairo, with its shops, restaurants and newspapers, was well established by the early 1920s and welcomed the more recent Syrian exiles. During the day, he sometimes led the life of a young politician, attending overcrowded and smoke-ﬁlled meetings where Arab orators would take turns delivering impassioned speeches denouncing the British and French. They lashed out at everyone and everything; the partition of Syria that France had imposed, the creation of modern Lebanon, the British occupation of Palestine and the 1925 destruction of Damascus. Ahmad Sharabati listened carefully and remembered well. When not immersed in politics, he spent time with his father’s Egyptian business associates. Having brought new technology from the USA, Sharabati promptly set about opening a small iron and steel welding factory in Cairo, producing the ﬁrst wrought iron furniture in the Middle East and North Africa.47 He also began investing in the Egyptian stock market, buying and selling cotton stocks, which\n\n38\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nwas a booming market in Egypt.48 Egyptian cotton had been a prized commodity since the 1800s, when Mohammad Ali Pasha developed it as a cash crop to support his massive army. During the American Civil War when the supply of cotton from the USA was interrupted, the British government began to rely heavily on Egyptian-grown cotton, which was more durable, softer and less expensive than American cotton. The cotton was grown in Egypt but the cotton trade was dominated by foreigners. Of the thirty-ﬁve registered cotton brokers in Egypt in 1928, only two were Egyptians. The directors of the Egyptian cotton bourse were a mixture of Egyptians and several Middle Eastern nationalities, including Syrian Jews. The president of the bourse was a Syrian friend of Hajj Uthman named Jules Klat Bey. Even the cotton mills were monopolised by nonEgyptians. Ahmad Sharabati traded at the Cairo Stock Exchange which, when considered together with the Alexandria Stock Exchange, was one of the world’s top ﬁve exchanges. It was located at the old Ottoman Bank ofﬁce on Maghraby Street. In 1928, there were 228 listed companies at the Cairo bourse. Ahmad Sharabati succeeded amongst these international giants, securing his ﬁrst million pounds. It was self-made money, not the inherited fortunes of Hajj Uthman. The success did not last. The Wall Street stock market crash of 1929 – also known as Black Tuesday – reverberated around the globe. When the London Stock Exchange crashed, so did the Cairo Stock Exchange, destroying the price of cotton in Egypt. After only fourteen months in Egypt, Ahmad Sharabati was back at square one, exiled and ﬁnancially bankrupt. He vowed to return to Syria, never trade in the stock market again, dedicate himself to his family’s business and focus on driving the French from Damascus. Two of these vows were fulﬁlled by 1933. The Sharabatis moved back home and Ahmad joined the family business, slowly taking over the administration of the cigarette factories from Hajj Uthman. The French were still there, however, and with so many frontline nationalists either exiled or jailed, Ahmad and his friends looked for ways to drive the French out, whatever the cost. This conviction gave birth to one of the most sophisticated but short-lived political movements of inter-war Syria, the Usbat al-Amal al-Qawmi, or League of National Action.\n\nSyria in Revolt\n\n39\n\nASSESSMENT OF THE GREAT REVOLT The Great Syrian Revolt of 1925 was a turning point in the life of the nation and the lives of Syria’s founding fathers. Although gloriﬁed by nationalist historians for years to come, the revolt was a disaster for Syria. Not only did it completely fail at ejecting the French, it resulted in tighter security and the emergence of a police state under French commissioners, much harsher and more autocratic than before 1925. It crippled the Syrian economy and left the Damascus countryside in rubble. It also led to the banishment of such frontline nationalists as Shahbandar and Sultan al-Atrash, who were removed from the political stage for a full decade and almost sent into political oblivion. When measured by nationalist criteria, however, the Great Revolt was impressive. It showed that the people of Syria were proud, patriotic and would rally to arms when needed to achieve their independence. Making a point, however, was not the issue. Syrian nationalists wanted independence, which seemed farther away than ever after the Great Revolt. The older generation, which had accomplished the Arab Revolt of 1916, knew no other way of getting rid of an occupying force. When they took up arms a decade earlier it had helped topple the Ottomans and they saw no reason why it would not work against the French. But something had to be done differently. This is where Sharabati and his friends came in, learning from the mistakes of 1925 while providing a new plan, with new faces, and a different approach to resistance. Military force alone would never drive the French out of Syria, they argued. Military force was needed but had to go hand-in-hand with a political process that invested in the very same institutions France had introduced to Syria: a constitution, parliament, municipal elections and presidential ofﬁce. The Syrians had to play by France’s rules of engagement, earning their independence by ballots instead of bullets. They needed to organise into political groups, or parties if possible, and persuade world opinion to support them. They needed to pressure the mandate authorities through strikes, campus sit-ins, street demonstrations and opinion articles in the Syrian press. Exposing French tyranny to the outside world would beneﬁt the Syrian cause far more than shooting a French ofﬁcer or overrunning French barracks.\n\n40\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nThis required leadership, organization, discipline and vision, far more than individuals alone could provide. They also needed a functional political entity, but Syrians had not had a proper political party since the mandate was imposed. Shahbandar’s short-lived People’s Party had determined its own demise when it openly supported Sultan Pasha’s revolt. The younger generation of Syrian nationalists began to rally around big ideas and emerging leaders, giving birth to a colourful variety of political parties that included the Syrian Communist Party, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the Arab Baath and the League of National Action. These parties slowly emerged between 1927 and 1945, forming what would become the country’s traditional political fault lines. All of them started with the same purpose of liberating Syria from French rule. The birth of these modern political parties was a direct result of the failure of the 1925 revolt, which was a vital turning point in the country’s political transformation.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThe League of National Action\n\nAmbitious young Syrian men wanting to have political careers in the 1930s had only a few ideological parties to choose from in Damascus. One was the Communist Party of Syria and Lebanon, founded in Beirut after Vladimir Lenin’s death in 1924. It was anti-French and internationally well-connected thanks to the support it received from the Bolsheviks in Moscow. The Communist Party was attractive to schoolteachers, intellectuals, women wanting to break away from the restrictions of a male-dominated society, atheists and factory workers, all with very different ideological creeds and socio-economic backgrounds than Ahmad Sharabati. Another possibility was the nascent Damascus branch of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, led by a turbaned cleric from Homs named Sheikh Mustapha al-Sibaii. The Brotherhood, which had been founded in Egypt by Imam Hasan al-Banna in 1928, called for a caliphate-headed Islamic state and the end of British colonialism in North Africa and the Middle East. It was popular among the urban poor and lobbied against all kinds of foreign inﬂuence in the Muslim world, from music and cinemas to constitutions and parliaments, considering all of them imported and un-Islamic. The third possibility was the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), the Nazi-inﬂuenced paramilitary organisation established by the enigmatic Lebanese philosopher Antune Saadeh. Founded in Beirut in 1932, the SSNP was anti-colonial, secular and revolutionary, attractive to young intellectuals studying at AUB in the early 1930s.\n\n42\n\nThe Makers of Modern Syria\n\nSaadeh envisioned a greater Syria encompassing today’s Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Cyprus and the Sinai Peninsula. The pan-Syrian programme of the SSNP was too narrow for Ahmad Sharabati who, at this stage of his career, sought to liberate the entire Arab world, from Egypt and Tunisia to Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, from foreign control. THE NATIONAL BLOC A nationalist coalition founded by Hashem al-Atasi in October 1927, the National Bloc was the most important and organised anti-colonial movement in the Middle East.1 The party’s founding conference lasted for six days in Beirut and its attendees included Ibrahim Hananu, commander of the Aleppo Revolt of 1919; Aleppo physician Abdul Rahman Kayyali; Said al-Jaza’iri, the Damascus-based wealthy Algerian emir; Hama landowners Najib alBarazi and Abdul Qader Kaylani; Homs aristocrat Mazhar Pasha Raslan; Palestinian journalist Yusuf al-Issa; Beiruti notable Abdul Rahman Bayhum; Damascus attorney Ihsan al-Sharif; the mufti of Tripoli Abdul Hamid Karami; and two prominent citizens from Tripoli, Aref al-Baysar and Aref al-Rifaii. All of them were leading members of the ﬁrst generation of Syrian nationalists. At its founding conference, the Bloc outlined its ten-point programme, demanding the end of martial law, freedom of the press, a general amnesty, a halt to arbitrary arrests and a roadmap for when and how the French mandate would end.2 The National Bloc would be willing to deal with the mandate regime and offer it de facto recognition only if the party were told speciﬁcally when and how it would ﬁnish. The party were unwilling to become stooges of the French, but were clearly open to talks with Paris. They believed that military opposition had been suicidal for Syria and placed all of the blame for the Great Revolt’s collapse on Shahbandar and his friends. The National Bloc leaders stressed that they sought to change French policy by inﬂuencing French public opinion, not by armed resistance. The National Bloc hoped to win Syria’s independence from the French by cooperating with French-created institutions, one step at a time. This was a far cry from the nationwide revolution that Shahbandar had been calling for\n\nThe League of National Action\n\n43\n\nsince 1920, seeking nothing less than immediate and unconditional independence, with no French privileges whatsoever in Syria’s future. Members of the Bloc derided his oratory and claimed that his leadership had led them to nothing but destruction. Now that he seemed to be in permanent exile, they argued, Shahbandar was no longer entitled to speak on behalf of the nationalist movement. The National Bloc dominated the Syrian political scene from 1927 to 1946. During these years, its leaders would assemble in the old mansions of Damascus and Aleppo, to discuss how Syria should be run and with what form of government following the departure of the French. The Bloc founder and lifetime president, Hashem al-Atasi, emphasised that the National Bloc was a coalition of like-minded men with good intentions, and not a political party. All its members were prominent, wealthy landowners united by the desire to see a free and independent Syria. They also shared the belief that armed resistance alone would never end the mandate and that it must be dismantled politically rather than brought down militarily. They vowed to eject the French using institutions the French had created such as the Syrian parliament, municipalities and the presidency. The National Bloc’s three goals were the uniﬁcation of Syrian lands, independence and the establishment of a democratic parliamentary republic. The National Bloc was born out of the failures of Shahbandar and the Great Revolt, as well as the desire of the Syrian pe"
