        "text": "August 2021\n\nWritten by Shant Dadourian, Manhasset NY\n\nMy great grandfather, Dadour Dadourian, was born in 1905 in Gurin, Turkey. The Armenian genocide started when he was 10 years old when his father, Alexander, and all the men and boys in his village were taken by the Turks and killed. Only Dadour, his grandmother, step mother and baby brother survived. Dadour survived by fooling the Turks and dressing up as a girl. Everyone else in his family was killed including seven brothers and sisters.\n\nDadour, his grandmother, step mother and baby brother were forced to march through the desert to Der Zor, a town in Syria, along with thousands of other Armenians, most of whom were women and children. Sadly, his brother and step mother did not survive the long, deadly journey. After many days and miles of marching, Dadour and his grandmother managed to escape and made their way back to Gurin where Dadour vowed to avenge his families’ deaths and fight the Turks.\n\nBy 1919 it became very clear to them that it was no longer safe in Gurin, so Dadour and his grandmother managed to travel to Constantople in hopes of finding some surviving relatives.\n\nUnbeknownst to Dadour, he had two uncles, Harry and Dikran, who had emigrated to America, gained citizenship and lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts. When they learned that Dadour and his Grandmother were alive, Harry was sent to Costantople to find and bring them to America, along with other surviving members of his family. Unfortunately, Dadour was not interested in getting on the ship to America but rather to hunt down and kill Turks so when Harry found them, Dadour ran away. Sadly, Harry left Constantinople empty handed.\n\nDikran refused to give up trying to find his relatives so in 1920 he sent Harry back to Constantinople to find Dadour and his grandmother. Fortunately, Dadour cooperated with Harry and he and his Grandmother left Constantople to begin their new lives in America.\n\nOnce in Cambridge Dadour lived with his Uncle Dickran and attended the Boston School of Commerce from 1920 to 1924. Following graduation he moved to New York City and in 1932 married Elise Salibian of Beirut, Lebanon. Dadour and Elise had four sons who all worked in the family business.\n\nDadour learned the export business from his uncles, Dikran and Harry. Along with his close friend, Artin Aslanian, and cousin, Poozant Piranian, Dadour established the Dadourian Export Corporation, which exported used clothing to the Middle East, India and Asia. They also invested in real estate on the Lower East Side, including Chinatown.\n\nDadour used his entrepreneurial skills he developed in business to help build and support the Armenian community in the United States. He was constantly donating and fundraising for Armenian causes, never taking “no” for an answer. This included St.\n\nVartan Armenian Cathedral in New York City, which was one of the first Armenian cathedrals in North America, as well as establishing other parishes such as Holy Martyrs Armenian Church in Queens, New York and St. Mary’s Armenian Church in New Jersey.\n\nDadour helped develop the St. Nersess Seminary in New Rochelle, New York, which was the first Armenian seminary in the US. Dadour started Dadourian Sans, an organization for orphaned Armenian children from Turkey, bringing them to Jerusalem to be educated. In 1960 Dadour received the Medal of St. Gregory, the highest honor given to an Armenian layman, for his service to the church and community. He also founded the Armenian Endowment Fund.\n\nHe supported the Holy Martyrs Day School along with his second wife, Sara, who was the principal.\n\nIn addition to 4 sons Dadour and Elise also had 11 grandchildren. Dadour died in 1990 at the age of 85.\n\nThis is the Genocide survival story of my father‘s mother, my Grandmother, Haigouhi Arakelian Arslanian Khederian, born in 1895 to Boghos & Tourvanda (Kalfayan) Arakelian. Haigouhi grew up in Yozgat, Turkey with her three brothers, Arakel, Levon, & Garabed, along with her sister Zarouhi.\n\nAt the age of 17, Haigouhi married Asadour Arslanian, also of Yozgat, through an arranged marriage. The year was 1912. Asadour was a personable businessman working for Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. He was the first salesman to sell life insurance to the residents of Turkey. Asadour had 2 brothers, one a lawyer and the other a businessman dealing with imports and exports.\n\nHaigouhi and her new husband Asadour soon had a child in January of 1913, Harry Asadour Arslanian.\n\nThis 1914 family photo above shows my Grandmother Haigouhi on the far left with her husband Asadour next to her. Asadour's two brothers and sister are standing next to him. Seated are Asadour's parents, with baby Harry in the lap of Asadour's mother. The girl in front is Asadour's little sister Vergin (Virginia).\n\nIn 1915, all the men in this Arslanian family photo were dragged out of their family home in Yozgat and murdered by Turkish soldiers. Asadour was shot and killed along with his two brothers and father in front of their family home.\n\nIt was now 1915, and the Armenian Genocide had begun. The Turkish Government wanted to eliminate Armenian intellectuals first, and the Arslanian men fit into that category.\n\nThe Turkish soldiers then came back into the Arslanian home, yelling for any other males in the house. Haigouhi’s baby Harry was still in the house, and the women knew if the soldiers found him, they’d kill him for being an Armenian male. The frightened women desperately hid baby Harry under a pile of blankets, with Asadour’s little sister Virginia sitting on top of him. They prayed little Harry would not cry.\n\nLuckily baby Harry remained silent under the blankets. The soldiers then sternly gave an order: the women must leave Yozgat by morning. The women were devastated by the killings they’d just witnessed, but they gathered up all they could carry. My grandmother Haigouhi could only manage little Harry. Asadour’s little sister Virginia helped by carrying some food, a few belongings, and the family photo.\n\nThe following day, the women began to walk from their family home in Yozgat into the unknown. This walk is what was eventually known as the \"Death March\"... the long line of Armenian women, children, and elders who were forced from their homes, following each other into the hot desert.\n\nHaigouhi’s mother-in-law sadly did not survive the death march, succumbing to heat, starvation, and exhaustion, as well as dying of a broken heart after watching her husband and three sons shot to death. Although Virginia and her sister were devastated to lose their mother, they had no choice but to continue on.\n\nTwenty year old Haigouhi carried Harry in her arms day after day, for weeks and months. They walked through Turkey, hiding Harry, disguising him as a girl. They were occasionally able to take shelter in “safe houses” along the way.\n\nOne time a family hid them in their dry well for a few days. They lowered baby Harry, Haigouhi, Virginia, and Virginia's sister down the well in buckets. The four of them hid in the dark, muddy, awful smelling bottom of the well all day long. They waited there each day until the Turkish soldiers came through looking for Armenians. If Harry had cried or made a sound in the well, they would have been discovered, and Turkish soldiers would have killed them all. It was a life of constant fear.\n\nHaigouhi and the others found whatever they could for food, sometimes eating grass along the way. If they found poppies, they picked them. They could use the poppies to give to Turkish men in exchange for food, because the men would use the poppies to make opium.\n\nIf they reached a town center, little Virginia would go to the markets to beg or steal whatever little food she could. She would often get beaten by the food sellers. If there was a barrel of honey, Virginia would dip her hand in the honey, and then dip her hand in nuts, oats, or wheat. Then Virginia would run to Haigouhi and the others, who would lick the honey, nuts, and grain off her fingers. This was the only nourishment they would have for their entire day.\n\nThe group would then move to the next town, looking through garbage wherever they would go. While looking through trash piles for food, they would sometimes have the good fortune of finding rags or scraps of material. The women would then use the bits of material to sew clothes for dolls or babies.\n\nVirginia would try to sell these baby clothes to passersby in the next town. Whatever money she could get was used to buy food at the market to survive until the next day.\n\nHaigouhi, Virginia, Virginia's older sister and little Harry lived like this for five long years through the Middle East & Syria. They never knew from one day to the next where their next meal was coming from, nor where they would sleep for the night. They were nomadic refugees, who would walk day after day, from place to place, with little more than the clothes on their backs.\n\nIn 1918, the Turkish killings of the Armenians had ended, but Haigouhi and the others continued their nomadic life, with no place to call home.\n\nBy 1920, the Red Cross had become involved in the Middle East, trying to reunite displaced Armenian refugees with any of their living family members. Although Haigouhi only spoke Armenian and Turkish, the Red Cross informed her that two of her brothers were alive. Haigouhi’s brothers Levon & Garabed were alive and living in America!\n\nLevon and Garabed arranged to send Haigouhi money to buy tickets to America. It was an incredible relief that family members were about to rescue Haigouhi from her life of fear and homelessness. Haigouhi was going to America!\n\nHaigouhi, little Harry, Virginia, and Virginia’s sister got themselves to Greece where they boarded the USS Pannonia on April 4, 1920. After two long months at sea, the ship landed in Ellis Island, New York on June 7, 1920.\n\nHaigouhi was now 25, and Harry was a boy of 7. The group had endured five long frightening years together as nomads. Now they were about to enter a foreign country where they spoke not a word of English, but they were no longer homeless, hungry, hiding, and scared for their lives.\n\nAfter getting through the processing at Ellis Island, Haigouhi was reunited with her two brothers Levon and Garabed. Haigouhi learned that her oldest brother Arakel had been murdered by Turkish soldiers in 1915, and his wife Shnorig died in the death march with their two babies.\n\nHaigouhi also learned that Arakel’s oldest son Badrig, her nephew, was alive, and had been living in an orphanage, along with Haigouhi’s younger sister Zarouhi. The brothers sent money for Zarouhi and Badrig to buy tickets to America too.\n\nThe large group lived with Levon and Garabed Arakelian in Philadelphia, a popular region where many residents of Yozgat had settled. The blended family now lived together under one roof in crowded living quarters.\n\nVirginia and her sister eventually moved on and settled in Chicago with relatives. Virginia ended up in California, where she worked as a talented seamstress. She was hired as the head seamstress for Elizabeth Arden in Beverly Hills. Her clients included Hollywood elites, who gave her tips of several hundred dollars per fitting. This was a far cry from her days of trying to steal a few nuts to survive each day.\n\nAfter several months of the Arakelians living together in Philadelphia, Haigouhi was introduced to Boghos Khederian from Boston, who soon asked for her hand in marriage. They were married in Philadelphia in 1922, and settled in Massachusetts for the rest of their lives.\n\nBoghos Khederian had not been involved in the Genocide. Boghos was born in 1889 in Kayseri, Turkey (historically named Caesarea). Boghos and his brothers Assadoor and Garabed immigrated to America in the early 1900’s, after hearing rumblings that the Turkish government would be causing more trouble for the Armenians. They left behind their parents, grandparents, and four younger siblings in Kayseri, all of whom tragically perished during the Genocide.\n\nIn 1923, Haigouhi and Boghos had their first child, my father, Myron Paul Khederian. In 1926, Haigouhi and Boghos had a second son named Henry. Then, in 1932, they were blessed with their only daughter, who they named Anahid (Anita).\n\nIn Massachusetts, Boghos and his brother Garabed (Charles) opened a grocery store called Kidder Brothers Market in Roslindale, where my grandfather Boghos was the butcher. However, after the Great Depression, their business folded.\n\nBoghos and Haigouhi then moved their family to Somerville, where Boghos opened another small market. Eventually Boghos and Haigouhi moved their family to Belmont. But in the late 1930's, my grandfather Boghos's health failed, and he sadly passed away in 1941 at the age of 52.\n\nBoghos’s death left Haigouhi a devastated young widow of 46. However, she had a useful talent from her years of sewing those small scraps of cloth to make clothes during the Genocide. Haigouhi had also taught herself to sew on a sewing machine. So after Boghos died, Haigouhi was hired as a seamstress for Eastern Coat Company in Watertown, making high class men’s coats and suits.\n\nHaigouhi was a caring, hard-working mother of four, and loving grandmother to six. She had survived the Armenian Genocide and made a life for herself in America, and became very involved with the St. Stephen’s Armenian Church community in Watertown. Haigouhi was a gifted seamstress, knitter, and crocheter. She was also a talented cook and baker, whose specialties included souboereg, manti, choereg, khourabia, and ashma (katah).\n\nMy grandmother Haigouhi Khederian, who we affectionately called Grammy, passed away in 1972 at the age of 77, after a day of baking Armenian delicacies for Thanksgiving. Her son Harry lived a long happy life as a devoted husband, father, and grandfather, passing away at the age of 92.\n\nMy grandmother Haigouhi never learned to speak much English in her life. She never spoke to me or her other grandchildren about the Genocide. She never mentioned the horrific shootings in Yozgat, or the atrocities she witnessed on the death march. Like other Genocide survivors, her experiences during those five frightening years were all too painful for her to talk about. Grammy smiled and laughed often, but there was always a fear and sadness she carried with her from her days of living through the Genocide.\n\nAs a child, I would spend my Saturdays with my grandmother after Armenian school. As I would work on my Armenian studies with Grammy, I sometimes asked her about the Genocide. All she ever replied were these broken English words into my ear: “Never trust a Turk”. That’s all she ever said, but she’d say those words in a loud whisper, as if she were still frightened for her life. Turkish soldiers had killed her precious family members and had destroyed the life she had made back in Yozgat, a life I’m sure she thought of often, but never spoke about.\n\nI have carried my grandmother’s story in my head and heart my whole life.\n\nI am now able to be my grandmother’s voice, and am grateful for this opportunity to share her tale of survival through the Armenian Genocide...a story which was too painful for her to ever retell on her own.\n\nI, Mary Ann Kazanjian, am the daughter and only child of Badrig Arakelian, survivor of the 1915 Genocide of the Armenians in Turkey. Badrig, the eldest son of Arakel and Shnorig (Berberian) Arakelian, was born in Yozgat, Turkey in 1909. Yozgat, a rich and vast forest area, was located in central Turkey near the present day capital of Ankara. It was first established by the Armenian Capanoglu family of the “Tekke\" tribe in the early 1700s who came from Yerevan in the East to escape Turkish and Kurdish atrocities. The Capanoglu family surname derived from the meaning “Shepherd’s Son” and the land was named Yozgat, heavily inhabited by Armenians and Greeks. The Greek name for Yozgat was Bozouki.\n\nArchitect Simon (Sinan) from Yerevan was commissioned to build the grand palace for the Capanoglus and a mosque in 1779, twin to the magjificent Mosque Suleymaniye in Istanbul. Simon’s son, Haci Arslan (meaning lion), was the first usage of the Arslanian name.\n\nSimon’s grandson was Ohan Chorbaji Arslanian (1784-1874), and together with Simon they were the major benefactors and developers of Yozgat in the 1800s, building schools, bridges, bazaars and the Sourp Asdvadzadzin Church.\n\nBadrig was a seventh generation direct descendant of the wealthy Yozgat Arslanian family. He was the great, great grandson of Hovhannes or Ohan Chorbaji Arslanian on his maternal side. His legacy has now continued three additional generations with his daughter, Mary Ann, son-in-law Edward Kazanjian, his two granddaughters Krista and Karen Kazanjian Lilla and husband Paul, and his two great grandchildren Marianna and Damian Lilla.\n\nBadrig’s family lived on a street named Rue Tekke in Yozgat. He had a younger sister, Armenouhi, and an even younger brother, Haroutiun. His father and paternal grandfather had a comfortable living in the importing and exporting business in partnership with a Greek family.\n\nIn 1912, Badrig’s family moved North to Samson on the Black Sea and expanded their wholesale business with this Greek family in a huge warehouse on the waterfront. They dealt again in dry goods such as walnuts, soaps and dry fruit. Badrig, being the oldest, spent a lot of time with his father Arakel at this warehouse. Samson was a warmer semi-tropical climate and the Armenians, Greeks, and Turkish people lived cooperatively among each other. His Arakelian grandparents parents, Boghos and Turvanda, joined his family in Samson along with his father Arakel’s youngest sister, Zarouhi. Shortly thereafter both grandparents passed away before the Armenian Genocide began in 1915. The family lived in a comfortable hillside two story home with a view of the sea next to an Armenian church and graveyard. There was a new military building across the street built in 1911 where his father reported, dressed in a Turkish uniform, paid required fees and served in the National Guard.\n\nThere were mansions of wealthier Armenians on the hillside. Badrig befriended an Armenian boy whom he referred to as very rich because he had a tricycle and would treat Badrig to Hershey chocolate bars. This family had a tobacco factory manufacturing cigarettes. Badrig’s family took refuge in this friend’s huge cellar and watched the allied Russian and American ships during WW1 bombardments, while the elders opened their Bibles and prayed.\n\nIn 1918, Badrig’s father, Arakel, was taken away from his home by soldiers. The family was told that he was now serving in the military but he never returned. Two weeks later a notice was posted at the bazaar that all Armenians were ordered by the government to leave Samson within the week. His mother said she had an inkling of where his father was and decided to hire a wagon and go look for him with her two younger children in tow. Promising that she would return, she left both Badrig under the charge of his Aunt Zarouhi, age 19, who was still living with them, in the safety of the Greek partner’s home. His Mother also left all her jewelry to sell in order to care for Badrig and Zarouhi. Since all the Armenians had left, the Turks assumed Badrig was Greek, attending a Greek school. After six months, word was out that the Armenians could reclaim their houses so Badrig and his Aunt Zarouhi returned. The house was ransacked and all valuables were gone. For three months they sold off furnishings and what was left to survive. It was later reported to the extended family that Badrig’s mother, sister and brother had all perished on the forced march to the desert.\n\nThere was word of a Turkish orphanage in neighboring Marsovan, in what was once Anatolia College. His Aunt Zarouhi hired a wagon and took them there where Badrig stayed and she served as a nurse’s aide. They slept in filthy conditions on the earth floor with no coverings and given a quarter of a loaf of bread each day along with eating grass to survive. Badrig scratched his hands and faked a skin disease in order to go to the infirmary to see his aunt and get more food. Unfortunately he contacted a disease all over his body there, which took over a month to heal.\n\nThere was a maternal Uncle Roupen Berberian in Constantinople (present day Istanbul) that heard through a Marsovan Armenian family that Badrig was still alive. The family urged him to escape the orphanage, come to their home, where a covered wagon was waiting with a hired Turkish driver to take him to Samson. It was an overnight trip where they encountered a German soldier who spoke Armenian and asked “Hye es?” and escorted him the rest of the way. The next morning he boarded a fishing boat with only an orange and an apple in his hand answering to his name, Badrig. It was another overnight trip to Constantinople where he met his uncle. He lived with him there in Kadikoy on the Asian side in a very comfortable home for about six months attending Armenian school. He was in awe of first seeing trolley cars and the famous Galata Bridge. There was no hint of danger or fear there. His Aunt Zarouhi also arrived from the Marsovan orphanage and they were sent tickets by two other uncles who heard they were alive. These two uncles, Vahan Berberian and Levon Arakelian, had already come to America before 1915 to study and work and send money back to the Yozgat families. They organized and actively supported the Yozgat Union in Philadelphia to support schools and families in Yozgat.\n\nIn February 1920, Badrig and Zarouhi traveled to Greece where they boarded the ship S.S. President Wilson traveling in first class luxury to Ellis Island, New York. He was unable to enjoy the beautiful food since the voyage was very rough and he was always seasick. Due to being an orphan, it took two days of processing his entrance into America. They then went from Penn Station to Philadelphia where they met up with both the uncles who Badrig recalled bought him his first toy, a windup automobile. He lived with the Arakelians there and started first grade at nine years old, not knowing a word of English and being made fun of and physically bullied by non-Armenians.\n\nAt age 16 he quit school in grade six and worked with his Uncle Levon, whom he loved and respected, in the dry cleaning/tailor business. At age 18 he opened his own dry cleaning business but lost it in the Depression. In 1934 he moved to Massachusetts to help his father’s brother, Charles Arakelian, in Roslindale, with his bleaching business. Working for his uncle proved to be a very difficult situation, so Badrig then returned to Philadelphia and to High School. But he was summoned again by his Uncle Charles in MA who needed help again because he had broken his leg.\n\nHis uncle desperately needed his help back in Massachusetts and made many promises to him if he’d return again to Watertown, MA. Once again it was a difficult situation working together. So Badrig went out on his own renting a room for $3.00 a week on Dexter Ave., Watertown, MA. His landlord operated an Armenian Restaurant on the site of the former Kay’s Market on Mt. Auburn St., Watertown, MA. He also secured a job earning $6.00 a week pressing clothes (even though he was promised $12.00 a week).\n\nBadrig met Elizabeth Boyajian in 1944 from Belmont, MA. His cousin Harry Arslanian spotted her in the window of her father’s Belmont Provision Market on Belmont St. and suggested to Badrig to ask her out on a blind date. They married on Jan. 21, 1945 at St. James Armenian Church in Watertown. I was born the following year on Jan. 29, 1946 and was their only child. They lived at 40 Alma Ave. in Belmont and Badrig and Elizabeth were proprietors of Belmont Cleaners on Belmont St. Belmont. His one week a year vacation consisted of motoring to Atlantic City, NJ to enjoy the beautiful beach and exciting boardwalk attractions and of course visiting the extended family in Philadelphia and New Jersey. They later moved to 123 Winter St. Belmont and then to Barnard Road, Belmont.\n\nBadrig and Elizabeth were active members of the community and St. James Armenian Church where Badrig first organized the Men’s Club, Bingo and the first New Year’s Eve party.\n\nHe served on the St. James Parish Council and was a member of the Belmont Beaver Masonic Lodge. Elizabeth was the first organist at St. James and served for fifty years along with being a charter member of the St. James Women’s Guild. They were both recognized as Parishioners of the Year in 1986. Just two years later, Badrig died in 1988.\n\nBadrig always strove to be a good, proud citizen of the United States. Although an orphan and enduring a loss of great magnitude, he built a new family and reunited and enjoyed the many cousins and relatives of his and Elizabeth’s extended family in the United States. He was never bitter or angry with what happened in Turkey and wanted to look forward not behind. He supported the April 24 observances of the Armenian Genocide but also was concerned that politicizing would jeopardize the safety of the many Armenians still living in Istanbul.\n\nFast forward to 2009 and 2010 when my husband, Edward Kazanjian, and I made two pilgrimages, covering 3000 miles and 100 historic Armenian villages. As part of these journeys, we visited Yozgat, Samson, Marsovan and Istanbul,Turkey following in Badrig’s footsteps.\n\nBadrig’s maternal Uncle Vahan Berberian had painted, after his arrival in America, a Yozgat landscape scene. I brought a copy with me and amazingly found the same location as the painting depicted.\n\nWe also found the beautifully renovated historic Arslanian home which was now a museum, furnished as it was in the early 1900s. But also on the doorstep was the original tombstone with dates honoring Ohan Chorbaji Arslanian!\n\nWe also found Rue Tekke, the street where the Arakelian family lived. I was one of the 12 leading plaintiffs of the N.Y. Life Insurance Co. lawsuit that was settled in 2005, since I had my grandfather Arakel’s original policy invoices with his address.\n\nWe went on to Samson where we discovered the newly built 1911 military building and the Armenian hillside homes. We also went to Marsovan where we located the Turkish orphanage. We walked the streets of Kadikoy, Istanbul, passing several Armenian churches and neighborhoods.\n\nIt was very emotional and rewarding to walk the streets of all our grandparents’ ancestral villages. We also brought back soil to share with family and friends. It provided a physical connection to.the homeland. Also,making many public presentations and DVDs was our gift to the community. We wonder what our parents and grandparents would have thought of us making such a journey and to have come full circle. We experienced the beauty of the land, the familiar food and music, breathed the same air, drank the same water and connected with them spiritually. Badrig, along with many survivors, never wanted to return, feeling it was in the past and there was nothing there. But we now know “There is Something There”!"
