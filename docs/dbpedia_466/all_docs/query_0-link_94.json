        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nTimely diagnosis and prompt management of Retinoblastoma (Rb), the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children linked to mutations in the RB1 gene, are critical for the cure (1, 2). Globally, the incidence of RB is one in 15-20 thousand live births (3, 4). Although disease-specific mortality has markedly improved over the past years (5), global disparities in regional mortality rates remain a burning issue (6, 7). For example, the mortality rate in Asia and Africa, is as high as 40% to 70%, compared to less than 5.0% in Europe, Canada, and the United States (8–12). The incidence of Rb among the Jordanian population is estimated as one in 15620 newborns per year. Over the past few years, the mortality rate decreased from 38% to 5.0% because of the strict centralization of care for all Rb patients to a single specialized tertiary cancer center, in addition to the increased awareness among families and health caregivers in the country about this disease (13–16).\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Syria, which started in 2011, has had a profound impact on the entire region. An estimated 5.6 million Syrians have fled their country, mainly to Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon (17). Jordan hosts over 1 million Syrians; most of whom reside in host communities rather than in Refugee camps, where they have access to existing public health services (18). In 2018, cancer affected more than 18 million people worldwide, and more than 9.0 million died from the disease (19), and refugees are not immune (20, 21). Between 2011 and 2019, 917 Syrian cancer patients were registered at the King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) hospital-based cancer registry. A lack of sufficient funding from either host countries or international refugee aid organizations is expected to result in the suboptimal treatment of patients with cancer (22, 23).\n\nRb is a rare form of cancer, where a delayed diagnosis is considered the single most important poor prognostic factor in terms of survival and eye salvage rates (22–25). In a retrospective international study of 692 patients from 11 RB centers around the world, the long lag time between the first symptom for RB and visiting the RB treatment center was significantly associated with higher chances of an advanced tumor at presentation, presence of high-risk histopathology features, systemic metastasis and death (26). Refugees are challenged with difficulties in accessing adequate health care, which may result in delays in diagnosis and management of Rb, therefore are expected to have a worse outcome compared to citizens in the host countries. In this study, we evaluate the patterns of presentation and management outcomes among Syrian refugees living in Jordan, diagnosed with Rb who received treatment at King Hussein Cancer Center, in Amman, Jordan.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nCancer care and care for rare diseases, for both adults and pediatrics, might not be a priority of refugees’ health care in many host countries. Financial support is typically directed toward housing, food, and basic life needs. Ethical dilemmas ensue in such circumstances, especially when dealing with potentially curable cancers at a reasonable cost. Retinoblastoma is a rare life-threatening cancer in children that is curable if diagnosed early and treated adequately (4, 6, 10, 13). In this study we found, on average, a 2 months difference in lag time between groups in the diagnosis and initiation of treatment. This delay reduced the chance for eye globe salvage, without a significant impact on mortality.\n\nThe age-standardized rates (ASR) for age groups (0-14 and 0-19) for Rb were variable between different countries in the MENA region. The highest ASRs and the second highest worldwide were in Morocco with 9.2 and 7.1 cases per million person-years for the 0-14 and 0-19 age groups respectively. Followed by second place in Jordan with 7.1 and 5.1 cases per million person-years in both groups respectively. While the lowest ASRs recorded were in Qatar with 0.4 and 0.3 cases per million person-years years for the 0-14 and 0-19 age groups respectively. Tunisia recorded the same ASRs as Lebanon, with 3.6 and 2.8 cases per million person-years for the 0-14 and 0-19 age groups, respectively (27). Rb patients with delayed diagnosis and referral are expected to present with a more advanced tumor stage (25, 26, 28–30). In this study, 70% of the affected eyes in refugees had advanced intraocular stage (staged as group D or E), and 2% had an extraocular disease at diagnosis while only 56% of the affected eyes in Jordanian patients belonged to both groups, and none had an extraocular disease at diagnosis. This difference is expected because of the difference in the age at diagnosis directly related to the time lag between the first sign of the disease and the time of starting treatment. Our results showed that the median age at diagnosis for citizens with Rb was 4 months younger than the median age at diagnosis for refugees for both bilateral and unilateral patients. Furthermore, an extra 2-month lag time between signs of disease and starting treatment among refugees was noted in comparison to citizens.\n\nThe silent nature of Rb in the early intraocular stages, and the difficulties most refugee patients worldwide encounter in accessing medical care, may contribute to the late presentation seen among the patients in our study. Furthermore, the increased awareness of the disease, easy accessibility to health care, and the presence of the screening program for Rb in Jordan contributed to the difference in the promptness of diagnosis and starting treatment among Jordanian patients (29). For example, five Jordanian patients in this series were diagnosed by screening, compared to only a single refugee patient who had a parent and sister diagnosed with bilateral Rb. The signs and symptoms of Rb depend on its size and location. Leukocoria is the most frequent presenting sign of Rb, reported in approximately 50–60% of cases, followed by strabismus (25%) and inflammatory signs (6–10%) (30–33). In our study, 53% of refugees patients presented with leukocoria, followed by strabismus (20%) and buphthalmos (10%), in comparison to 71% with leukocoria, 20% with a squint and 1% with buphthalmos among Jordanians.\n\nUnfortunately, the impact of the delay in diagnosis was reflected in the treatment burden and management outcomes. Rb management guidelines recommend that the early diagnosed tumors (group A and a few of group B tumors) can be treated with focal therapy even without chemotherapy, while more advanced tumors need chemotherapy and sometimes radiation and/or enucleation, so the more advanced tumor at diagnosis the more treatment burden for the patient (34, 35). In this series, 25% of the affected eyes among Jordanian patients mandated primary enucleation, while 48% of the affected eyes among refugees mandated primary enucleation, as they presented with a more advanced stage. On the other hand, the chance for eye salvage was almost the same for the eyes that received conservative therapy (80% for Jordanian and 62% for refugees, p=0.06), probably a reflection of the unified treatment protocols in a specialized cancer center with the same team (13). The slight non-significant difference in the outcome might be a reflection of the difficulty of strict follow up for refugees living in camps where transportation and access to the central city for treatment is cumbersome. Eventually, the difference in the mortality rate for both Jordanians and refugees with Rb was not statistically significant (3% for Jordanian patients and 7% for refugees; p=0.33), a potential reflection of the centralization of care for all Rb patients in Jordan (13).\n\nPolicymakers should be aware that implementing cancer control programs across the continuum, from early detection to survivorship and palliative care programs, is cost-effective. For example, the 2019 World Health Organization report on cancer found that for every 1 USD invested in cancer, there is a direct productivity return of 2.30 USD and a total social return of 9.50 USD (23, 36). Although this might be less clear for rare diseases like Rb, Despite the clear unwarranted effect of delays in the diagnosis, thus the treatment for Rb patients in terms of decreased eye salvage rate and increased treatment burden, the mortality rates could be maintained at low levels once the patients are diagnosed and treated in specialized centers. An important issue with cancer care is the complicated management protocols, mandating a multidisciplinary-team approach that involves surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, psychosocial support, supportive/palliative care, survivorship, and genetic counseling (13, 29), Therefore, policymakers should be advocates to manage refugees cancer patients in specialized tertiary cancer centers to achieve the best possible survival for this category of patients.\n\nOur study shed light on the problem of the diagnosis and the management of Rb among refugees. We believe that highlighting these problems among refugee patients with rare tumors like Rb will help with developing solutions within healthcare systems that are directed toward refugees mainly in host countries with limited resources (like Jordan). We have shown that even with limited resources, having such rare diseases managed exclusively in specialized referral centers could offer the best outcome to those patients and could save lives. Our study has several limitations that need to be considered. This was a retrospective study with a limited number of patients from a single institution; thus, the findings might not be generalizable to the entire refugee population in Jordan or throughout the region. Nonetheless, the current study has several strengths; the data were obtained from the single referral cancer center (that exclusively treats all patients with Rb in the country) that has previously hosted and currently hosts a large number of refugees.\n\n4.1. Strength and limitation\n\nOur study was based on some strengths as all cases were under a strict follow-up program and they were treated in a single tertiary center at KHCC. This is due to that there is an unofficial agreement between Jordanian ophthalmologists that all Rb cases should be referred immediately to where all the cases are treated. On the other hand, It had some limitations as it can be improved by increasing the sample size which could have generated more accurate results, and integrating additional methods of data collection as a questionnaire could have increased the scope and depth of analysis."
