        "text": "Despite the growing acceptance of the Syrian government on the regional level, most notably with the readmission of Syria into the Arab League, the economic situation has continued to deteriorate with the Syrian pound hitting record low-values. The deterioration is likely a combination of extensive Western sanctions on Syria, exhaustion through years of war, the fact that some areas with key resource assets remain beyond government control, and the government’s own policies.\n\nThe government seems to have few if any solutions to these difficult problems, and there is ever growing discontent in government-held areas with the decline in the economy and living standards. This disillusionment is manifesting itself openly in the form of renewed protests in the southern provinces of al-Suwayda’ (primarily Druze population) and Deraa (primarily Sunni Arab).\n\nDemonstration on the evening of 23 August 2023 in the al-Suwayda’ village of al-Qurayya at the site of the tomb of Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, leader of the Great Syrian Revolution against the French occupation.\n\nThe protests in al-Suwayda’ seem particularly notable despite the fact that there have been previous rounds of protests in the province against the economic and livelihood situation. The protests in al-Suwayda’ now seem to enjoy more popular support than ever before.\n\nAmong those professing support for the protests is Abu Amir Osama ‘Albi, leader of the Faz‘at Fakhr Faction. Abu Amir provided me an extended statement on the position of him and his group regarding the new round of demonstrations. I produce it in translation below. It is a representative example of how even many of those who have stood with the Syrian government against the insurgents during the war are calling for major internal change, to the point of calling on the government to resign."
