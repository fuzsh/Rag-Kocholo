She is the daughter of the prominent Arab leader and Syrian nationalist Sultan Pasha al-Atrash.\n\nMuntaha has stood with the great Syrian revolution since day one and supported the demands of the Syrian people for freedom and dignity and the overthrow of the Assad regime. She also participated in many anti-regime demonstrations in the Damascus suburbs.\n\nMuntaha will forever be remembered by the Syrian people for the speech she gave in 2011, when she said: “There is no turning back. We want to overthrow the regime, and the wellbeing of the country must be above everything else. We want freedom, social justice, and salvation from the corrupt, oppressive Assad regime.”\n\nWe belong to Allah and to Him we shall return."
