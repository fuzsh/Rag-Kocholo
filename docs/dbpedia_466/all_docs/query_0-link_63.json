        "text": "Sultan al-Atrash was a Syrian Druze nationalist who commanded the Great Syrian Revolt against France and its State of Syria. He was born in al-Qrayya, a village in Jabal al-Druze, to a prominent Druze family of al-Atrash. He joined the Arab Revolt in 1916 and fought against the Ottoman Empire alongside Emir Faisal. He was awarded the title of Emir and the rank of a General in the Syrian army. After the French occupation of Syria in 1920, he led a rebellion against the French mandate that lasted for two years. He was exiled to Transjordan and later Iraq, where he maintained close ties with the Hashemite rulers. He returned to Syria in 1937 after a general amnesty. He remained a symbol of national pride and resistance for the Syrian people. He died in 1982 in his hometown and was buried there.\n\nShow More"
