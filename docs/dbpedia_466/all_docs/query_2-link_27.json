        "text": "The regime in Damascus has lost control of much of Syria for the foreseeable future. It has too few soldiers to retake the areas it has lost.\n\nIn brutal desperation, the authorities send the air force to rain bombs indiscriminately on towns and villages that have slipped from their grasp. They are nervous about the allegiance of the Sunni majority of the population, and recruit militias to support the army, largely from minorities.\n\nThese militias commit atrocities, further inciting the population against the regime. Government forces perched on the mountains above Damascus shell rebel-held areas of the city. The rebels commit atrocities, too, but the regime employs systematic state terror in its attempt to regain control.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? These words could describe what is happening in Syria today, but might equally have been written about the great rebellion against the French Mandate in Syria that began in July 1925.\n\nThe great revolt of 1925\n\nFirst, the Druze of the Hawran in the far south of the country rose up against the mandate authorities. The French thought that the Druze, as a religious minority, had few links with other Syrians. They were wrong. When Druze warriors successfully ambushed French columns sent to punish them, many local Muslims and Christians joined the revolt.\n\nThe French thought that the Druze, as a religious minority, had few links with other Syrians. They were wrong.\n\nOn 4 October 1925, Syrian troops in the predominantly Sunni city of Hama, over 200 miles north of the Hawran, mutinied and besieged the French administrators in their citadel. Two weeks later, Damascus itself rose and the High Commissioner's residence was ransacked. The whole southern half of Syria ceased to be safe for government forces.\n\nAt first brutal French tactics in 1925 just strengthened the rebellion. Damascus and Hama were crushed by artillery and bombers. Although the French regained control of the streets of these shattered cities, they had only succeeded in flushing the rebels out into the countryside, where they harassed government communications.\n\nThe French eventually won because they were able to ship in a large army from other parts of their empire. With boots on the ground, they squeezed the lifeblood out of the rebellion. Insurgent leaders like Fawzi al-Qawuqji, who had raised the flag of revolt in Hama, were welcomed as heroes wherever they went.\n\nHowever, people nervously urged him and his followers to move on. His presence would attract savage reprisals against any community suspected of harbouring him. In the spring of 1927, he followed other key figures in the rebellion, such as the Druze leader Sultan Pasha al-Atrash and the Damascus-based politician Abdulrahman Shahbandar, into exile.\n\nFast forward to 2011\n\nThe geographical spread of the rebellion that began against Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2011 is different, but comparable in extent. Large parts of the north and east of the country that did not rise in 1925 have done so. History never repeats itself exactly, but neither in 1925 nor 2011 did the government foresee the rebellion or the extent to which it would unite so many Syrians from different backgrounds.\n\nBoth uprisings were swelled by the neglected and excluded, as the poor in cities and the countryside flocked to the banner of revolt.\n\nIn each case, this was in reaction to a desperate economic situation brought about by a combination of short-sighted government policies and years of drought. Another point of commonality between the two uprisings is in the propaganda war. Like the French, Bashar al-Assad has done all he can to demonise opposition to his rule as sectarian fanaticism.\n\nThe biggest difference, of course, is that the French were foreigners. They had no legitimacy in the eyes of the vast majority of Syrians, but many who depended on the French for their positions or hoped to gain from French rule remained loyal. Others were quietly relieved when the rebellion failed.\n\nAs war shattered everyday life, most ordinary people just wished it would end. But as people from different sects fought the French, they discovered a shared sense of nationhood. This changed Syria irreversibly, and the French realised they would have to compromise with Syria's Arab nationalists in order to rule.\n\nThe uprising against the French was put down within two years. Today's Syrian revolution has already lasted four, and no end is in sight.\n\nBashar al-Assad has no army coming from overseas to help him regain control. Although he is Syrian, the revolution has shown his support is limited to segments of the population. He receives foreign help from the powerful Lebanese Shia militia Hizballah, Iran and Iraqi Shia volunteers, but they cannot provide the numbers the French needed to reconquer the country.\n\nSignificant differences\n\nThe rebels themselves are aided by large numbers of foreign volunteers. These include fighters in the Islamic State group, which has has done immense damage to the moral cause of the rebels, since its agenda and tactics are far removed from those of the Syrians who broke the barrier of fear to challenge the might of Assad's security state.\n\nThe French won because they shipped in an army from other parts of their empire. They squeezed the lifeblood out of the rebellion."
