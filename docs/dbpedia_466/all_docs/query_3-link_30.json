        "text": "This article analyzes spatial perceptions and practices of Druze citizens of Israel before, during, and after the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon in 1982−2000. It argues that the opening of the Israel–Lebanon border in 1982 and its closing in 2000 had three effects: it generated internal social, political, and cultural changes within the community in Israel; it changed the relationship of the Druze with the State of Israel; and it reestablished strong ties with their coreligionists in Lebanon and Syria. Drawing insight from the field of border studies, the article shows how Druze citizens of Israel live concomitantly in state and suprastate spatial scales, forming a third, integrated or hybrid, spatial scale. The article proposes using the concept “hybrid spatial scale” as a tool for studying communities such as the Druze that operate on multiple territorial scales.\n\nAuthor's note: I am indebted to Efrat Ben Ze'ev, Cyrus Schayegh, Faten Ghosn, and William Miles for reading earlier drafts of this article and making valuable comments. I am also thankful to the anonymous reviewers for their constructive critique. Yusri Khaizran deserves special gratitude for helping to set up some of the interviews and for deciphering for me complex Druze social and political practices. Finally, I am grateful to the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts at the University of Notre Dame for supporting my research trips to northern Israel.\n\n29 Scholarship on Israeli Druze tends to be broadly divided into two approaches. The first argues that Israel (even during the Yishuv years in Mandatory Palestine) has shrewdly used divide-and-rule policies to artificially separate Arab Druze from other Arab-Palestinian communities. Kais Firro's previously referenced book can be squarely placed within this group. See also Halabi, Ezrahim Shvey Hovot. The second approach points to a disconnection between Palestinian Druze and other Arabs in Palestine during the Mandate years. In 1948, it is argued, Druze strategically decided to align themselves with Israel and consequently a “blood oath” was established between them and the Jewish state. Nissim Dana's The Druze in the Middle East is a clear illustration of this line of argument. See also Nisan, Mordechai, “The Druze in Israel: Questions of Identity, Citizenship, and Patriotism,” Middle East Journal 64 (2010): 575−96CrossRefGoogle Scholar. Both approaches, however, acknowledge that since 1948, Druze have been discriminated against by the state. But while the former sees this discrimination as a structural condition inherent in the definition and practices of Israel as a Jewish state, the latter sees it as an unfortunate reality that should and could be amended.\n\n49 Interviews with the author, Yarka, Haifa/ʿIsfia, 2 January 2014. In my interview with Nissim Dana, he recounted cases in which he issued permits for Druze who asked to go to Lebanon to reconnect with their family from a previous incarnation. He explained that out of curiosity he had asked them for details, and they were able to give him information about the family and even their house, which they were going to seek out once in Lebanon. Another interviewee (8 July 2014) told me about a Druze senior military officer, a famous political figure today (whose name he refused to disclose because of concerns about public embarrassment), who in the late 1990s crossed the border, took a taxi to Hasbaya, and found the house where he had supposedly lived in a previous incarnation.\n\n55 “Hayalim Druzim Nishpetu ʿal Lehima le-tsad Aheyhem ba-Shuf, Davar, 17 January 1983; Muhammad Rammal, interview with the author, Yarka, 8 July 2014; interviews with the author, Hurfish, 21 January 2016. In a conversation I had with Hillel Cohen, today a Hebrew University professor, he noted that while he was imprisoned in a military jail in early 1983 (for a different felony), he met dozens of Druze, many of whom were convicted for defection and for providing military assistance to their Lebanese coreligionists."
