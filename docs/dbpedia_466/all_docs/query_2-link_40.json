        "text": "The Druze are often considered an Islamic group because they believe in Allah as the one God. However, their teachings are different enough that they are considered separate from the Muslim majority of the Middle East. Druze contains elements of Judaism and Christianity as well as Greek philosophy.\n\nThe Druze do not allow people to convert to or away from the religion. They must accept all Druze beliefs, deny other religious beliefs, avoid unbelievers, and maintain unity with other Druze.\n\nThe Druze religious system and beliefs are kept secret from the outside world and even from some of its own members. All Druze are divided into two categories: the ʿuqqal (“the wise”) and the juhhal (“the ignorant”). Theʿuqqal know the Druze teachings (hikmah), participate fully in religious services, and have access to Druze scripture. They must be virtuous and devout and are bound by strict behavioral codes. The ʿuqqal may rise through the ranks until they become ajawid, or “the generous.”\n\nThe ʿuqqal are responsible for the juhhal. The juhhal do not have to follow the same rules as the ʿuqqal. Much of the religion is kept secret from the juhhal. However, they are aware of certain Druze teachings, such as the oneness of God.\n\nThe founder of the Druze was al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. The Druze believe he was God in human form. Al-Hakim became a ruler of Egypt in 996. He was known for his cruel and strange practices. He persecuted Christians and Jews and banned various kinds of vegetables and shellfish. In 1017 he began to encourage the teachings of some Muslim missionaries who believed that al-Hakim was God on Earth. He disappeared in 1021. The Druze believe he will return one day.\n\nThe Druze have played important roles during various periods in Middle Eastern history. They stood against the Crusaders and were a powerful group for a time during the Ottoman Empire. The Druze staged an uprising in Syria and Lebanon in the 1920s. They became involved in conflicts in Lebanon and Syria in the 21st century as well."
