        "text": "Syria covers an area that has seen invasions and occupations over the ages, from Romans and Mongols to Crusaders and Turks.\n\nIt is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Christians, Druze, Alawite Shia and Arab Sunnis, the last of whom make up a majority of the Muslim population.\n\nModern Syria gained its independence from France in 1946, after which it saw considerable political instability with multiple military coups and coup attempts between 1949 and 1971. Between 1958 and 1961 it briefly joined with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic. Significantly, the 1963 coup saw the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party establish a one-party state.\n\nGeneral Hafez al-Assad seized power in 1970, setting up a repressive political system. After his death in 2000, his son Bashar al-Assad inherited the presidency.\n\nIn power since succeeding his father in 2000, Bashar al-Assad has fought for control of his country after protests turned into civil war.\n\nHe inherited a repressive political structure from his father Hafez al-Assad, with an inner circle dominated by members of the family's minority Alawite Shia community.\n\nCracks began to appear in early 2011, in the wake of the Arab Spring wave of popular dissent, but a divided opposition and strong support for President Assad from his Iranian and Russian allies steadily turned the tide of battle in the government's favour after 2017.\n\nSome key dates in Syria's history:\n\n3500-2300BC - Kingdom of Ebla, the earliest recorded indigenous civilization in the region.\n\nc. 2300BC - Part of the Akkadian Empire under Sargon the Great and his grandson Naram-Sin.\n\n1800-1200BC - Rise of the coastal kingdom of Ugarit.\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Syria becomes a battleground between the competing empires of the Hittites, Egyptians, Assyrians, Mitanni and Babylonia.\n\n1274BC - Battle of Kadesh between the Egyptians under Ramesses II and the Hittites under Muwatalli II - the best-documented battle of the ancient Near East including records of the world's first surviving peace treaty.\n\nc. 1200BC - Canaanites come to dominate the area after the Bronze Age collapse of civilisations in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n911-605BC - Area part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire.\n\n605-539BC - Becomes part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar the Great.\n\n539-330BC - Becomes part of the Persian Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great and his successors.\n\n330BC - Greeks under Alexander the Great conquer the area, on his death it subsequently becomes part of the succeeding Seleucid Empire.\n\n63BC - Roman general Pompey the Great annexes Syria - which becomes a Roman province.\n\n5th Century AD - Syria becomes part surviving eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire following the fall of the western half of the empire.\n\n1970 - Hafez al-Assad comes to power in a coup. His rule is characterised by repression and a major arms build-up.\n\n1973 - Syria and Egypt initiate the Yom Kippur War against Israel. The Israeli army reverses initial Syrian gains and pushes deeper into Syria.\n\n1976 - Syria intervenes in the Lebanese civil war. It maintains military presence there for next three decades, and exerts significant influence on Lebanese politics.\n\n1982 - Muslim Brotherhood uprising in Hama is suppressed in a month-long siege by the military, who kill an estimated 10-40,000 civilians.\n\n2000 - Hafez al-Assad dies and is succeeded by his son, Bashar al-Assad.\n\n2005 - Syrian forces withdraw from Lebanon under international pressure following assassination of Lebanese premier Rafiq al-Hariri.\n\n2011 - Outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Inspired by the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings, confrontation between the government and opposition soon develops into a multi-sided fight involving Islamists and rebels that draws in world powers. Some 300,000 people are estimated to have died.\n\n2023 - The main external military threat and conflict are the continuing fight with Islamic State militants and concerns about possible Turkish military offensives in the northeast in order to strike Kurdish groups."
