        "meta_description": "Abstract This article analyses the reconfiguration of religious identity in the Druze community in Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil, which was formed by the arrival of immigrants from Lebanon in the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries. The immigrants created ethnic and religious institutions destined to maintain Druze identity and its Islamic character. However, the transmission of religious knowledge to the generations born in Brazil was fragmentary and imperfect. Nevertheless, Druze identity was maintained by many and completely recreated in the religious context of Catholicism and Spiritism, while the connection to Islam faded away. The analysis focuses on how religious authorities and the belief in reincarnation were the main elements that allowed continuity in religious identity together with the transformation of tradition.",

        "text": "The Druze in Minas Gerais, a province in south-eastern Brazil, constitute a religious community created by immigrants from the Middle East in the early twentieth century, now made up of their descendants. While the immigrants lived Druzism as part of Islam, this connection disappeared among their descendants as the Druze tradition was completely reconfigured within the framework of affiliation to Spiritism1 and the incorporation of Catholic rituals. The collective reconfiguration of Druze identity through the adherence to non-Islamic religious systems has no parallels elsewhere, for this kind of continuity of Druze identity is usually found only on an individual scale.\n\nAmong the Druze communities of immigrant origin in the Americas and Australia it is not uncommon for individuals to convert to the religious traditions that are culturally hegemonic in the local society. The belief that Druze identity is linked to reincarnation and, therefore, cannot be lost or abandoned (Khuri 2004: 3) has allowed individuals who convert to other religious traditions to retain personal connections to existing Druze communities. Nevertheless, many of those who convert end up abandoning their Druze identity.\n\nWhile Druzism emerged within Islam, the relationship of the Druze with Islam varies according to each context. Most of the Druze consider themselves part of a specific tradition of Islam. Some emphasise the idea that they carry a universalistic religious truth that, while deriving from Islam, transcends all religious traditions and leads to a higher communion with the divine (Khuri 2004: 15). The latter position has led to the claim by some Druze individuals and communities that Druzism, although of Islamic origin, is a religious system autonomous from Islam.\n\nIn order to understand the religious dynamics of the Druze community in Minas Gerais this analysis will look at reincarnation as a device of embodiment of collective memories and at the role of religious authority in the reconfiguration of religious tradition. The ethnographic data analysed here comes from fieldwork done in Belo Horizonte and Oliveira, in the province of Minas Gerais, in September and October 2019, and fieldwork done in SÃ£o Paulo in February 2020.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis analysis of the Druze in Minas Gerais has shown how the maintenance of the Druze religious identity in the context of Brazilian society was accompanied by the creation of institutions and the constitution of a cohesive religious community in the early twentieth century. This was followed by efforts on the part of the religious authority of the community to enhance the circulation of religious knowledge among youngsters born in Brazil in order to revive their identity and commitment to the Druze tradition. Nevertheless, in the late twentieth century there was a profound transformation of the Druze religious tradition, with its reconfiguration within the religious framework of Catholicism and Spiritism, while its connections to Islam faded away.\n\nThe religious authority of the shaykh and reincarnation, as both belief and experiential arena, were central to this process. The shaykh presided over the circulation of religious knowledge, enlarging its scope and reach, making the religious tradition and the collective memory of the community more accessible and mobilising the members of the community around their Druze identity. The belief in reincarnation created experiential arenas in which collective memories were embodied as part of one's self, enhancing the sense of belonging and the cohesion of the community.\n\nTherefore, while the Druze born in Brazil were drawn into other religious affiliations, namely Catholicism and Spiritism, they remained attached to their Druze identity, inscribing it into their adopted religious systems. Thus, while the Druze tradition was deeply transformed by its association with other religious systems, it also reshaped their doctrines and rituals in ways that allowed the Druze to continue to exist as a distinct religious community. In this sense, while belief in reincarnation and the authority of the shaykhs were the main pillars of continuity of the Druze tradition in Minas Gerais, they were also the devices that triggered and shaped the dynamics of its transformation."
