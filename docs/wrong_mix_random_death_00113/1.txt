Our Executive Committee determines the companyâ€™s strategic direction and oversees the broad scope of our operations.

Our portfolio management team is headed by our chief investment officers (CIOs), led by Daniel J. Ivascyn. Investment decision-making at PIMCO, however, is very much a team effort, one that draws upon the skills and insights of our portfolio managers and analysts around the globe.
