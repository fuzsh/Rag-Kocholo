        "text": "Types of International instruments\n\nCountries\n\nPart of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's (CNSC) mandate is to implement international obligations on the peaceful use of nuclear materials and technology to which Canada has agreed. To achieve this objective, the CNSC works bilaterally and multilaterally with partners around the world to maintain a safe, secure and peaceful international nuclear sector.\n\nTypes of international instruments\n\nInternational instruments comprise a variety of documents. They include treaties, agreements, conventions, charters, protocols, declarations, memoranda of understanding and exchanges of notes.\n\nA treaty is \"an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, whether embodied in a single instrument, or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation\" (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties). Treaties are most commonly referred to as Treaty, Convention, Agreement or Protocol. An exchange of diplomatic notes or letters can also be a treaty.\n\nGovernments use non-legally binding instruments in international relations to express political and moral commitments as opposed to undertakings governed by public international law. These instruments are usually entitled \"memoranda of understanding\" or \"arrangements\".\n\nNuclear Cooperation Agreement (NCA)\n\nCanada's non-proliferation policy stipulates that Canadian-supplied nuclear material, equipment and technology may only be transferred to countries with which Canada has concluded a bilateral NCA. NCAs establish reciprocated obligations to minimize risk associated with major nuclear items. These include assurances that exports are properly protected, safely handled and used for peaceful purposes, and that Canada maintains control over nuclear exports.\n\nAdministrative arrangement (AA) pursuant to NCA\n\nCanada's NCAs contain a provision authorizing the CNSC as the appropriate government authority on the part of Canada to establish AAs to facilitate the effective implementation of an NCA.\n\nAdministrative arrangement (AA) on the import and export of radioactive sources\n\nThese non-legally binding bilateral arrangements between the CNSC and foreign regulatory counterparts implement key import and export control provisions of the IAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources (the Code), and the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources (the Guidance). The objective of the AAs is to establish efficient and harmonized bilateral procedures for the implementation of import and export controls, thus reducing the risk of undue delays in authorizing transfers of such sources.\n\nMemorandum of understanding (MOU)\n\nAn MOU, under section 21(1)( a) of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA), empowers the CNSC to enter into arrangements with any regulatory agency or department of a government or any international agency. These arrangements provide a framework for bilateral cooperation, and provide parties with assurances regarding the security of information exchanged, as well as enhanced clarity about responsibilities regarding visits and costs related to cooperation initiatives, among other benefits. While these arrangements are not legally binding, they nonetheless represent serious political commitments\n\nCountries\n\nArgentina\n\nAustralia\n\nBelgium\n\nBrazil\n\nChile\n\nChina\n\nColombia\n\nCzech
