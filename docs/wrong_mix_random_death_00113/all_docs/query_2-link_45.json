        "text": "Overview\n\nSince 2006, the Mass General Cancer Center has annually honored a luminary in the field - an extraordinary scientist, who has made major advances in our understanding of cancer and its treatment, and has been recognized as a true mentor by teaching and inspiring the next generation of cancer researchers. This year, the 2024 Jonathan Kraft Prize for Excellence in Cancer Research will be presented to Howard Chang, MD, PhD of Stanford University for his groundbreaking work on mechanisms that coordinate the activities of global gene expression programs controlling cell fate.\n\n2024 Event & Agenda\n\n2024 Jonathan Kraft Prize for Excellence in Cancer Research\n\nTuesday, May 2, 2024 | 1:30pm - 4:30pm\n\nStarr Center, Simches Building, 2nd Floor\n\n185 Cambridge Street, Boston, MA 02114\n\nDownload symposium flyer (pdf)\n\n1:30pm - Welcome and Opening Remarks\n\nDaniel A. Haber, MD, PhD\n\nDirector, Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research\n\nDirector, Mass General Cancer Center\n\nDaniel A. Haber, MD, PhD\n\nIntroductions\n\nDavid T. Ting, MD\n\nSymposium Chair\n\nAssociate Professor of Medicine\n\nMass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School\n\nDr. David T. Ting is an Associate Professor of Medicine at the Mass General Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research and Harvard Medical School. He is a physician scientist, cancer biologist, and bioengineer, and is currently Associate Clinical Director for Innovation at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Dr. Ting’s laboratory works on understanding RNA expression patterns in cancer to gain biological insight into the role of tumor heterogeneity in cancer progression, develop biomarkers applicable to the clinic, and to identify novel therapeutic avenues against cancer. His group uses single cell analytics to understand the relationship of cancer microenvironment and tumor cell plasticity. These single cell technologies have been applied to circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that have been isolated with microfluidic enrichment technologies to understand the molecular underpinnings of cancer metastasis and provide a path for blood based biomarkers. From these studies, his group has discovered the important role of aberrant expression of non-coding repeat RNAs in cancers that affect cellular plasticity, shaping the tumor microenvironment, and metastatic dissemination.\n\nDr. Ting received his BS in chemical engineering and biology from MIT, MD from Harvard Medical School, and medical oncology training at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He has founded three biotech companies based on the research in his lab including ROME Therapeutics, PanTher Therapeutics, and TellBio, Inc.\n\n1:40pm - \"Chromatin remodeling and gene control in cancer\"\n\nKaren Adelman, PhD\n\nEdward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology\n\nHarvard Medical School\n\nDr. Karen Adelman is the Edward S. Harkness Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School. She is also a Member of the Gene Regulation Observatory at the Broad Institute, and the Ludwig Cancer Center at Harvard Medical School. The Adelman lab pioneered genomic studies of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription, revealing that pausing of RNAPII in early elongation is a central regulatory step in metazoan gene expression. Ongoing work probes the interplay between transcription, RNA processing and epigenetic machineries to elucidate the determinants of mature mRNA formation in health and disease.\n\n2:00pm - \"Mechanisms driving evolution of drug resistance in lung cancer\"\n\nAaron Hata, MD, PhD\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine\n\nMass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School\n\nDr. Aaron Hata is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research at the Mass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Hata received his MD and PhD degrees from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and completed an Internal Medicine residency at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and a Medical Oncology fellowship at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Hata’s research focuses on understanding mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance to targeted therapies for lung cancer. His group has discovered mechanisms of clinical acquired drug resistance in oncogene-driven lung cancers, and he has played an instrumental role in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for overcoming drug resistance. Work by Dr. Hata’s group has also led to fundamental insights into the mechanisms that enable tumor cells to survive and evolve during therapy.\n\n2:20pm - \"Long noncoding RNAs as nucleation centers for heterochromatin formation\"\n\nMo Motamedi, PhD\n\nAssistant Professor of Medicine\n\nMass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School\n\nDr. Mo Motamedi is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and the James and Patricia Poitras Endowed Chair in Cancer Research at the Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research at the Mass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School. The research program in his laboratory is chiefly focused on understanding how changes to eukaryotic chromatin are made, maintained, and propagated, and how these changes establish alternative cellular states particularly in response to persistent stress. As a fellow, his work on fission yeast centromeres helped establish the Nascent Transcript Model, according to which non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) tethered to chromatin provide a platform for the assembly of RNA processing and chromatin-regulatory complexes. One focus of the lab is understanding the core mechanisms by which eukaryotic cells nucleate and establish heterochromatin using the fission yeast as a model organism. His lab is also interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells adopt phenotypic plasticity to develop resistance to treatment epigenetically.\n\n2:40pm - \"Disordered domains in oncogenic gene regulation\"\n\nMiguel Rivera, PhD\n\nAssociate Professor of Pathology\n\nMolecular Pathology Unit\n\nMass General Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School\n\nDr. Miguel Rivera is an Associate Professor of Pathology at the Mass General Krantz Family Center for Cancer Research and Harvard Medical School. He is also an attending physician in the Center for Integrated Diagnostics at MGH and an Institute Member at the Broad Institute. Dr. Rivera’s laboratory studies abnormal gene regulation in cancer, with a focus on how ‘driver’ oncogenes reprogram gene expression in cancer cells. These studies use a combination of genome-wide chromatin profiling, genome editing and biochemical assays and have led to several insights into mechanisms of chromatin regulation utilized by oncogenic transcription factors in a variety of tumor types. Dr. Rivera’s research has been recognized by several awards including the Thomas F. and Diana L. Ryan Research Scholar Award and the Martin Prize for fundamental research.\n\n3:00pm - Break\n\n3:20pm - \"Job’s dilemma for the genome: Why bad things happen to good chromosomes\"\n\nDavid Pellman, MD\n\nMargaret M. Dyson Professor of Cell Biology and Pediatrics\n\nDana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School\n\nDr. David Pellman is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a Professor of Cell Biology and Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, the Margaret M. Dyson Professor of Pediatric Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Associate Director for Basic Science at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. He received undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Chicago and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Whitehead Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Pellman’s laboratory has made contributions to understanding cell division and how cell division errors drive rapid evolution of the genome. His group’s accomplishments include: (1) the discovery of formin-dependent actin assembly and a mechanism for positioning mitotic spindles within asymmetrically dividing cells; (2) discoveries showing that whole genome duplication can promote evolutionary adaptation and tumor development; 3) the discovery of a mechanism explaining chromothripsis, a catastrophic mutational process in cancer and congenital disease.\n\n3:40pm - Keynote Speaker Introduction & Prize Presentation\n\nDaniel A.
