        "text": "Ben: Welcome to season 9 episode 3 of Acquired, the podcast about great technology companies and the stories and playbooks behind them. I'm Ben Gilbert and I'm the co-founder and managing director of Seattle-based Pioneer Square Labs and our venture fund, PSL Ventures.\n\nDavid: And I'm David Rosenthal and I'm an angel investor based in San Francisco.\n\nBen: We are your hosts. Listeners, David and I are coming at you live (sort of live) together from Seattle in person. First time since our Ethereum episode, David.\n\nDavid: Thatâs right. Which was not that long ago. Love that weâre back in the swing of things.\n\nBen: I know. Listeners, you probably donât notice a difference, but it feels totally different to be doing this with you in person, David, in full 3D.\n\nDavid: Energy in the room is electric.\n\nBen: Todayâs episode is on TSMC or the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Most people have never heard of it, but itâs the ninth largest company in the world episode.\n\nDavid: This is wild. Morris Chang founded TSMC at age 56,retired at 74, then came back at age 78 into the deal to make all of Appleâs chips. Weâre going to tell the whole story here. Itâs wild.\n\nBen: Itâs nuts. They make literally every chip in every iPhone sold today and soon to be in every Mac sold. If youâre excited at all about Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm, or even any of the chips that Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple are makingâall of those chips or nearly all of them are actually made by TSMC. Along with all the chips in your cars, in your smart home devices, fighter jets, and everything.\n\nUnbelievably, this company that the entire world relies on is on an island that some countries feel is a sovereign nation and the Peopleâs Republic of China feels is actually theirs. Todayâs episode has it all, ascending from startup, to tech superpower, an underdog founder, and of course, a good dose of geopolitics.\n\nDavid: Indeed. Before we dive in, Iâd like to welcome our presenting sponsor for all of season 9, pilot.com. Pilot is the backbone of the modern financial stack for startups and is backed by all-star investors like Sequoia, Index, Bezos Expeditions, and Stripe. They are truly the gold standard for start-up bookkeeping, and like Iâve been saying all season, pretty much all of my portfolio companies run on them. They are truly awesome and weâre so excited to have them with us. Now over to our conversation with Pilot co-founders Waseem Daher and Jessica McKellar.\n\nJessica, I know thereâs a fun story around one of your very first customers. Can you tell us that story?\n\nJessica: Yes. One of our earliest customers is my husbandâs first company. Waseem, Jeff, and I had already been through two companies together. It was so interesting to watch him go through that journey for thefirst time. It was delightful that my company could support him on the finance side through that growth, and in fact, that company was acquired. Actually,heâs back with startup number two, also using Pilotâa testament to the quality of the product.\n\nDavid: I love it. Youâve grown quite a bit. Who are some of the folks that use Pilot today?\n\nWaseem: I think one of the real reasons that folks come to Pilot today is a quite strongly demonstrated track record of expertise. Meaning we work with a thousand plus startups. We work with folks like Scale, Lattice ,Gem, Airtable, OpenAI. No one is doing the work that we do to the quality barthat we do it at the scale that we do it. Thatâs really the big unlock for Pilot, which is we can help you out when youâre two people in a garage. We canhelp you out when youâre multiple hundreds of people with a full-time finance team, a controller, a CFO, and all that good stuff.\n\nDavid: Love it. You can learn more about Pilot and whether they can help your company eliminate the pain of tax prep and bookkeeping by going to pilot.com/acquired. Thanks to Waseem and Jessica, all Acquiredlistenersâif you use that linkâwill get 20% off your first 6 months of service. Thank you, Pilot. As we talk about so often on this show and are definitely going to talk about on this episode, if you are a startupâanything that does not make your proverbial beer taste betterâyou should outsource to TSMC, AWS,or pilot.com.\n\nBen: All right. Listeners, it finally felt like the right time to do this episode amidst this global chip shortage that weâve got going on. David, I think Iâve heard even Ford has paused the production of F150sbecause of this. It is like a massive impact on the world. I think weâve had TSMC on the agenda to do for 2 Â½ years now in our little Google Doc.\n\nDavid: Totally. I feel like we havenât called in a mini-series, but letâs call it a mini-series on semiconductors in Silicon.\n\nBen: ARM episode.\n\nDavid: Yup, ARM episode. The Sequoia Part 1.\n\nBen: Thatâs right.\n\nDavid: Weâve done a ton of this. P.A. Semi.\n\nBen: Yup. Okay, listeners, it is time to jump into the history and facts. David is going to lead us in that. But as usual, even though weâre going to be probably very excited about some companies, less excited about other companies, the show is not investment advice. We may have investments in the companies we discuss. Itâs for entertainment and informational purposes only and you should do all of your own research even if you listen to the show for research purposes. Go do other research too.\n\nDavid: Do you hold TSMC? I donât. I wish I did.\n\nBen: I do not. I really wish I did starting pre-pandemic.\n\nDavid: Iâll have to think about it as we go through this episode. Okay, speaking of, we start. In Ningbo, China, in July 1931, just about one year after Warren Edward Buffet was born in Omaha, Nebraskaâand there are going to be quite a few parallels here as we go through this episode. But in July 1931 in Ningbo, China, our protagonist, Dr. Morris Chang, Order of Propitious Clouds with Special Grand Cordon, which is the highest civilian honor that anyone in Taiwan can hold.\n\nHeâs like a knight of Taiwan, the Order of Propitious Clouds. I think there are nine ranks of it and the highest is Special Grand Cordon.\n\nBen: And he is Special Grand Cordon?\n\nDavid: Heâs special. Heâs very special. He was born then. For those who are unfamiliar with Chinese geography, Ningbo is a small city, just a bit south of Shanghaiâsmall. Itâs about 8 million people. Just casual, no big deal.\n\nBen: Chinaâs scale is ridiculous. But certainly, it wasnât 8million when Morris was born in 1931.\n\nDavid: No. But I bet it was still probably pretty big. But yeah, today, eight million people, crazy. Morrisâs father was a county official and later became a bank manager. The family moved around a bunch a good bit within China as his father was transferring for work. This is pre-Peopleâs Republic of China. This is pre-World War II. This is a very different place.\n\nBen: Right. The leadership is not communist.\n\nDavid: No. His early childhood years were like middle class, not wealthy, but pretty well to do relative to your average Chinese citizen. Then when he was six, the Second Sino-Japanese War breaks out and Morris and his mom flee the main part of China to Hong Kong and they go to live in Hong Kong for a few years to escape the air aides and the fighting. And then, on December 8th, 1941, 3 hours after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked and invade Hong Kong.\n\nMorris talks about this. Everybody knows Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941. What people donât often talk about is the same thing happened in Hong Kong three hours later on the next day. Theyâre in Hong Kong. They flee again back to China. They end up in Shanghai this time and they stayed there for a few years until 1948 after World War II is over, but thatâs when the Chinese Civil War breaks out. That would lead to the Chinese Communist Revolution. They flee again back to Hong Kong.\n\nThis is crazy. Morris, before he turns 18, has lived through3 major warsâthe Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II, and the Chinese Civil War. Crazy. The next year, in 1949, which is the same year as the establishment of the PRC, the Peopleâs Republic of China, Morris turns 18 and with the help of an uncle that he has in Boston, his life completely changes. He gets accepted to Harvard. He goes to the US. He goes to college at Harvard. Wow.\n\nBen: Talk about a change of fate.\n\nDavid: Talk about a change of fate, a change of sceneâeverything. Morris says much later, \"My reaction entering Harvard was sheer ecstasy, almost disbelief, what a country! The United States was at its peak in its moral leadership and its political leadership in terms of democracy and it was the richest country in the world.\"\n\nBen: Not to mention stable. You could say what you want. You could count on the fact that itâs likely that 10 years from now, whatever economic structure or political structures exist will continue to exist. If what you want to do and what he ended up doing with his whole life is to innovate, having that stability around you and all those structures enable you to do that.\n\nDavid: We just take this for granted. But thatâs a good reminder. At the very least, heâs probably not going to have to flee Boston to continue his studies. But he does end up fleeing Harvard, as weâll get into. Morris loved it. That quote we read, he was so overjoyed to be there. But he realizes he has a new problem at Harvard. His parents arenât coming over. Heâs on his own. Heâs got to support himself and make his own way. At that time, his race is probably going to limit his opportunities.\n\nAs he says, \"In the early '50s in the United States, there were Chinese laundrymen, Chinese restaurateurs, Chinese engineers, and Chinese professors. Those were the only respectable professions for Chineseâno lawyers, no accountants, no politicians.\" What does Harvard churn out? Lawyers, sort of accountants, maybe politicians, yes. Not a lot of engineers.\n\nBen: Certainly finance professionals, not accountants.\n\nDavid: Certainly finance professionals. As we will see as we go along Morris. Heâs much more than a finance professional. Harvard actually didn't have an undergrad engineering program at the time.\n\nBen: Huh, that's crazy to think about.\n\nDavid: If you're really, really focused, you're probably going to go down the street in Cambridge from Harvard to MIT.\n\nBen: To MIT.\n\nDavid: Which Morris does. He only spends his freshmen year there and then for his sophomore year, he transfers to MIT so that he can study mechanical engineering. The next episode that Matimco sponsors, we're going to have to add TSMC to the alumni companies list.\n\nBen: It's amazing.\n\nDavid: It is amazing. The number of companies and market cap that have come out of that university is incredible.\n\nBen: And Pilot, right?\n\nDavid: And Pilot, that's right. We have so many companies to add to the list. All three co-Founders from PilotâMIT alums. Morris, our man, learned the ways of the world, in the US. He's focused. He starts mechanical engineering a year behind at MIT, he finishes both his undergrad and his masterâs in the remaining three years.\n\nBen: And what year is this?\n\nDavid: This would've been 1951 when he transferred, fall of1951.\n\nBen: Okay, to contextualize what's going on in the \"tech world\" right now because itâs not so much a world, that's a very small continent. You have all of the post-World War II defense spendings that went in, particularly on the West Coast with the innovations from Stanford. Has Fairchild Semiconductor started yet?\n\nDavid: Nope.\n\nBen: Maybe Shockley Semiconductor?\n\nDavid: Shockley Semiconductor was probably just getting going, but we're probably still in a vacuum tube.\n\nBen: Like Bell Labs land.\n\nDavid: Yeah. To give you a sense, silicon is years away. Transistors are probably just getting going. We're not in the integrated circuit yet, and it's all being done in germanium, not silicon. This is OG. After he gets his masterâs in three years, Morris wants to stay and do a Ph.D.âfully complete his technical training. But he ends up failing his qualifying exams twice. They give you two chances to take and he fails twice.\n\nBen: By the way, this is a good time to say, David and I watch and listen to every footage that Morris has ever spoken that has been released publicly to prepare for this. He is very funny.\n\nDavid: Oh, he's great.\n\nBen: The way he talks about this, he says that unfortunately, the biggest impediment to him going forward was that he failed the qualifying exam. But fortunately for him, they were kind enough to let him take it a second time, which he also failed. He has this really dry, clever sense of humor.\n\nDavid: In one of the Stanford interviews, he gets a question from the audience about how did he kick his smoking habit. The question was like, I know you used to smoke, how did you finally stop? And he's like, I never stopped. I still smoke. He's like 94 years old.\n\nBen: He goes on and makes the case for why he's a pipe smoker and actually, even though smoking is harmful to his lungs, it's actually beneficial for his mental life. He's pretty sure it's prolonged his life.\n\nDavid: He says he's delved into the data and pipe smokers live longer than non-smokers.\n\nBen: Which I'm sure you can find data to support that, also sure you can find plenty of data to refute that. But yes, this gives you a sense of who Morris is.\n\nDavid: Okay. He's failed his qualifying exams, he's got to go out and get a job, not as a Ph.D. He's got to go get a job as a super entry-level as an engineer. He has a master's degree, but still. Legend has it, he has a couple of job offers. The one he really wantsâremember, he's a mechanical engineer and this is super early days of technology. It's not really a thing yet.\n\nBen: There was electrical engineering at this time.\n\nDavid: Right. But he didn't study electrical engineering. In terms of where you would want to work, it's not really on anybody's radar screens especially Morris's that he's going to go enter the tech industry. He gets his dream job offer from the Ford Motor Company.\n\nBen: Oh, no way I didn't hear that.\n\nDavid: Yes. I'm sure this is a pocket full.\n\nBen: But let's repeat the pocket full story and broadcast it out to hundreds of thousands of people here.\n\nDavid: Totally. The legend has it that Ford offers him a salary of $479 a month to go take an entry-level job. And then he has a competing offer from Sylvania's new Semiconductor Division.\n\nBen: Sylvania, I know of this company only because my vacuum growing up was made by Sylvania.\n\nDavid: Yup. We're going to talk much more about Sylvania in one second. This is the competing job offer he's considering. They offer him a salary of $480 a monthâ$1 more. Legend has it that Morris asked Ford to beat Sylvania's offer. They didn't, so he took the Sylvania job offer. That's 100% apocketful. But you know Morris, he's great.\n\nSpeaking of Sylvania, do you rememberâIâm some portion of our audience remembersâwho else started their career in Sylvania'sS emiconductor Division right around this exact same time? We have talked a lot about this in this person on the show.\n\nBen: No.\n\nDavid: Donald T. Valentine.\n\nBen: No way. That's right.\n\nDavid: He started at Sylvania after Fordham, or maybe it was after the military.\n\nBen: He ended up at Shockley.\n\nDavid: I know then it was at Raytheon and then he joined Fairchild right after the Traitorous Eight left Shockley and started Fairchild.\n\nBen: You're better at remembering these deep details of older episodes than I am.\n\nDavid: I do a lot of research for this show. Sometimes research includes past Acquired episodes.\n\nBen: There you go.\n\nDavid: We've truly become a circular function here.\n\nBen: So they didn't overlap? Don Valentine and...?\n\nDavid: They were never in the same place. They were indifferent locations and different job functionsâvery different job functions. But they were both, I believe, at Sylvania at the same time.\n\nBen: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Crazy. Don, is out chilling in Californiaâlike we were talking aboutâand falling in love with California. He's playing water polo. He's like, oh my gosh, I'm never going to live this place. Morris, he's on the grind. He gets posted as a Junior Engineer at Sylvania's Ipswich, Massachusetts plant. Not quite the same glamour as Don out in Southern California. Remember, Morris is a Mechanical Engineer. He doesn't know anything about electrical engineering but he's working in this new Semiconductor Division.\n\nHe's living in a hotel, by the way. He doesn't even get an apartment. It's like some company-sponsored hotel. What a sad existence. He goes home back to the hotel from work and he studies the best textbook that he can find about electrical engineering, which is entitled Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors with Applications to Transistor Electronics written just a couple of years before, in 1950 by William Shockley.\n\nBen: Oh wow. Shockley and two other guys basically invented theâI'm not sure it was the first transistor, but the first transistor of the type that everything else would then be built upon when they were at Bell Labs not too long before this.\n\nDavid: Yeah, not too long at all. Again, it was back [...]of vacuum tubes and then Shockley invented the transistor, and then in a second, we're going to talk about the integrated circuit that Bob Noyce and Jack Kilby, who we're going to talk about co-invented.\n\nBack to this moment in time. Morris is just studying the Shockley textbook in his hotel room, but he's not in college and he doesn't have any teachers. He just has the book, but he's very resourceful. He figures out that one of the senior engineers at the plant is an alcoholic and hits up the hotel bar almost every night.\n\nWhat Morris does is he comes home from work in the earl yevening, he studies in his room for a couple of hours, and then later at night when the older colleague shows up at the bar, Morris goes down to the bar not to drink, but he brings the textbook and he asks the guy questions. He's like, I don't understand this, I don't understand that. He's just like buying drinks for his buddy. So great.\n\nBen: Incredible.\n\nDavid: Here's the quote he says later (he, being the older colleague), \"Didn't solve all my problems, but he solved enough so that I could move ahead. He was my main teacher about electrical engineering.\" So great.\n\nThis goes on for three years with Morris rolling hard. He's burning the candle on both endsâworking at the bar but not drinking, learning. But as he's learning the industry, coming up to speed, it becomes pretty clear to him that if he really wants to go places in this new emerging industry ,Sylvania, not really the right bus to be on, so to speak. Obviously, Do nValentine figures out the same thing and jumps to Raytheon and then to Fairchild.\n\nMorris says that the moment when this crystallized for him was there was a talk that a senior manager at Sylvania gave at the plant an dthe quote that the senior manager said that stuck with Morris for the rest of his life was, \"We (at Sylvania) cannot make what we can sell and we cannot sell what we can make.\" Real great position to be in. Morris is like,damn, I got to get the hell out of here.\n\nBen: That's a signal to move on if I ever heard one.\n\nDavid: Totally. Like Don, Morris leaves Sylvania for greener pastures. However, not to California for the Silicon Valley.\n\nBen: Halfway in between?\n\nDavid: Yup. Halfway in between. We talk a lot about Fairchild, the Traitorous Eight, Silicon Valleyâthe place to be. Here is the secret, Silicon Valley is all marketing. The biggest semiconductor companyâinall types, digital, analog, everything at that timeâwas not in California, it was in Dallas, Texas. It was Texas Instruments.\n\nBen: Which of course, me, you, many people in our generation know of as the people that made our graphing calculators in high school and college. But of course, at this time, I don't even think they had a consumer division yet.\n\nDavid: No. That's going to come up later. No, TI was the juggernaut. Now Silicon Valley is Silicon Valley. But then it was like, yeah, okay, California, West Coast. TI was the big and coming, they were the juggernaut. TI actually got it startedâI had no idea before doing the research hereâin the '30s. How did the technology company end up in a semiconductor company end up in Dallas, Texas? They started making instrumentsâTexas Instrumentsâfor measuring seismic activity for oil exploration.\n\nBen: That makes sense about Texas.\n\nDavid: They were like the TSMC, the technology provider to oil companies and that's what led them into computing and into digital to power that business. They were huge. Not just huge in terms of the company, but they were the technology leader.\n\nBob Noyce, like I was saying a minute ago, is credited when he was at Fairchild, inventing the integrated circuit and all that. While he was the co-inventor, simultaneously, it was co-invented by Jack Kilby who was at TI. Jack was actually the one who got the Nobel Prize for inventing the integrated circuit.\n\nGordon Moore, who was also at Fairchild and then founder of Intel along with Noyce, he would coin Moore's Law. But Jack has a great quote too about the implications of the integrated circuit and semiconductors. He says, \"What we didn't realize then,\" this is a little later when they were inventing it, \"was that the integrated circuit would reduce the cost of electronic functions by a factor of a million to one, nothing had ever donethat for anything before.\"\n\nIt's such a great way to frame it too. This had never happened in human history. Where there was this thing that used to be X expensive in terms of resources. And then magically one day it's a million times cheaper.\n\nBen: That's crazy. I didn't realize it was on that scale.This is probably a good time to talk about some definitions. Because there are some things that we've thrown around already, I think everyone has a general understanding of what these things are, but it's worth understanding more precisely before we move on.\n\nThe first of which is a transistor. The best way to think about a transistor is not the tiny little transistor that's on a silicon dietoday, but think about it as a little encased piece of circuitry with three prongs coming out of it. Those three prongs, we'll save the technical names,basically have an input and output and something that controls the input andthe output. It's a switch. It has two purposes. The first of which is being aswitch where you can decide that either a lot of stuff is going to go through itâstuff being voltage, current, or none, or it rounds to none. That way you can decide hey, this binary piece of equipment is either off = 0 or on = 1.That's a transistor.\n\nNow, a transistor can be made out of lots of different things. It can take any implementation. Why is everybody talking about silicon?Siliconâas in elementâis a semiconductor. It is a metalloid. It has some properties that make it like a metal, like a conductor. It has some properties that make it non-conductive. Imagine trying to move electrical signals througha piece of woodâit's not going to work. But imagine moving it through copper,it's going to work really well and you're never going to be able to interruptit.\n\nJeez, wouldn't it be great if some materialâasemi conductorâwhere we could modify whether the current was flowing through itor not?\n\nDavid: Make it a switch really easily.\n\nBen: Exactly.\n\nDavid: Lots of things are semiconductors. Germanium was the main material for a while. But germanium is expensive and rare. Silicon is madeof sand.\n\nBen: Silicon (I think) is the second most plentiful mine ableelement on earth.\n\nDavid: Yeah. I mean, it's sand, right?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nDavid: There's one other major thing though. We've been talking about transistors.\n\nBen: The IC?\n\nDavid: Yeah, the IC.\n\nBen: The integrated circuit.\n\nDavid: The integrated circuit. A transistor is a switch.Before the IC, people were making switches. You make one switch at a time, youwire it to another switch. If you've seen photos of any [...] in vacuum tubes,literally, they're plugging one tube into another. You're still doing that with transistors. When Noyce and Kilby invented the IC, now you can put a lot of switches on one thing. Fast forward to today, the latest processor, the5-nanometer processors that TSMC and basically nobody is churning outâbillions or trillions of switches are in like a tiny little...\n\nBen: Integrated circuit.\n\nDavid: Without the integrated circuit, that never would've happened. This invention, this miraculous invention of the integrated circuit happened in 1958. When did Morris Chang join Texas Instruments? 1958.\n\nBen: Fascinating.\n\nDavid: Coincidence? Yes, totally a coincidence.\n\nBen: Absolutely a coincidence.\n\nDavid: Absolutely a coincidence.\n\nBen: Again, to peg us in history here, weâre still (I think)10 years before the founding of Intel.\n\nDavid: Yes, exactly 10 years. Morris obviously wasn't working directly with Jack on inventing the IC. But this gives you a sense. TI,this is like Google plus Facebook.\n\nBen: Without the world paying attention to them.\n\nDavid: Yes, and in Texas. Morris gets assigned as his first project to a problem child within TI. They have entered into a deal with IBM. IBM is working on their first mainframe computer, a major project that's going to use transistor logic instead of vacuum tubesâthe IBM 7090. They anticipate so much demand for this product.\n\nUsually, IBM manufactures everything for all their products themselves, but they're like, we need more chips than we're going to be able to make ourselves so we need a second source for chips. They turned to TI. They're like, hey, we can give you all the designs for how to do this chip that we want for our product. We want you to additionally manufacture some of these in addition to our own line. You might even say almost like a contract manufacturer of chips or like a foundry business, almost.\n\nHmm, interesting. But it's not going too well. IBM's own plant is churning out transistors with about a 10% yield. Which means that of every 100 chips that they churn out of the plant, 90% of them fail and only 10%of them work. That's the first party line. The TI line has about a 0% yield. They're lucky if they're getting any. Almost everything coming off the linefails at TI when Morris shows up.\n\nMorris would say about this later, \"The supervisor was concerned. The operators were concerned. Everybody was concerned.\" Morris,remember, he's a mechanical engineer by training. He starts tinkering. He's like, this is a mechanical process. Chemical and mechanical processes creating this stuff. I'm just going to use my training and optimize it like a good mechanical engineer.\n\nHe starts doing some stuff and after about four months, he gets the yields at the TI plant up to 20%. Twice as good as the first partyline at IBM. There's a great profile that was one of the main sources for this episode in IEEE Spectrum. Great industry magazine that we'll quote from here,and they write:\n\n\"Suddenly, even TI president Pat Haggerty knew his name. IBM thought Chang had just gotten lucky, but when the company (IBM) sent engineers to talk to him, Morris described the theories heâd been testing an dexplained why his experimental process worked. The achievement propelled him into his first management job, creating a germanium transistor developmentdepartment with 20-plus engineers reporting to him.\"\n\nThis is his first big win here in the foundry business. On the back of all this, TI is like, all right, we got a rising star here. They offered to sponsor him to go finally get his Ph.D. They even offered to continue paying his full salary while he's getting his Ph.D., which they're paying for.\n\nBen: What? They think very highly of him.\n\nDavid: Very, very highly of Morris. This one probably made them millions doing this in 1958.\n\nBen: It's funny, I don't know anything about the commercial success of that particular IBM mainframe. But if it's the first one that's transistor-based instead of being vacuum tube-based, I have to imagine that it was far more efficient for customers, customers are probably lining up for it.\n\nDavid: I bet there's a lot of demand. Meanwhile, whatâs Morris making a year, $20,000? Maybe. Do you know how much it cost to go to Stanford then? Not much, so sure. Morris goes to Stanford and he's now like a pig in mud. He's found his calling. He can't wait to get back to Texas, back to TI. He finished his Ph.D. in two and a half years, wild.\n\nOne of the Stanford interviews with John Hennessy, the President of Stanford at that time, and they're joking. John was like, Morris,tell the students how did you finish your Ph.D. in two and a half years? Morris was like, I'm focused. I didn't do much else. By 1964, he's done. Heâs back at TI, and this is right when people have discovered the silicon is way more cost-effective and scales up way better.\n\nBen: If I remember right, the initial attempts at using silicon were that people didn't know how to work with it yet. Even though it was more abundant and cheaper, there's some particular manufacturing process that you have to do to silicon in order to make it as viable as it became.\n\nDavid: Yes, that is definitely correct. I don't remember exactly what it is. It's one of the many silicon semiconductor terms. It's not MOS, metal oxide semiconductor. That comes later. We're going to talk about it.One of those things that's innovation about how to transform, how to dope silicon to make it function and produce it at that scale as a semiconductor.\n\nBen: Listeners, this is where you should start to get the idea that especially today, manufacturing these products involves the most advanced process in human history consisting of layers of innovation,chemistry, physics, mathematics. It's breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough all building on top of each other, which need to all happen in the manufacturing process.\n\nEven here in 1964, weâre starting to get into the level of complexity where it's some of the most advanced science ever done being applied in an engineering and manufacturing fashion to get even marginal results at 20%yield of the manufacturing line.\n\nDavid: Little preview to fast forward to today, TSMC,they're a contract manufacturer for silicon, that is what they are. TSMC has40% operating margins as a contract manufacturer. It's not like there's no technology or R&D. They are one of the most advanced technology organizations in the whole world. There is so much IP, just in the manufacturing. Take out the design, take out the functions, just making this stuff is so hard. Now it involves lasers, we're going to get to that later.It's going to blow your mind how this stuff is done.\n\nAnyway, Morris, he's coming up. He's learning literally as this whole industry is getting developed, he's right there. A couple of years after he gets back from Stanford, he's still rising through the ranks. In 1967,TI made him a general manager of one of the divisions within the semiconductor business, and that's where he had his next big breakthrough. This is on the business side.\n\nMorris notices what they're doing setting up these new plants for all these successive new methodologies and processes of manufacturing, at this point integrated circuits and silicon-like semiconductors and pumping out these chips. It's super expensive to do this,super cost capital intensive.\n\nWhat TI and everybody else in the industry didâwhen they would start a new product line that would use a new fab for chipsâthey charged a lot of money for it because man, they put a lot of money into these things.Right off the gate, you want the latest new hotness in the end products that TI's selling, they're going to charge a lot of money for it.\n\nMorris realizes that that's not actually optimal to do that because as evidenced by his first big win at TI with the IBM line, there's alearning curve to getting the yields right and learning how to manufacture a new process. In the beginning, you're going to have a really low yield, and so what you want, ideally from a fabrication perspective, is you want to have aton of volume from the get-go.\n\nAs soon as the plan is online, you want to be running at max capacity so that you can, learn as fast as possible, get yields up to the profitable levels, and then you want to still be running at max capacity as long as possible because you already spent the fixed cost to make the plant. Basically, you always want max capacity. When you started out, by pricing sohigh, you kept demand low and you werenât able to get up to capacity fast enough.\n\nBen: It's almost like they didn't realize the benefit of the potential operating leverage that they had because they were just passing theirexact economics on to their customers and saying, you basically have to pay us for us to do all these fixed costs, and then you'll get all the benefits of how cheap it is to stamp it off the press every time. Whereas what they really should have been doing is saying, we will make an investment. We'll eat the cost ofhaving to spend all this up, but boy, are we going to be super profitable on every chip that comes off the line.\n\nDavid: Yup, totally. Morris is thinking about this. He hires BCG and they come up with the idea of actually pricing low to start to drive this volume and speed up the yield curve. And then also, the side benefit of that is, if they're pricing low and everybody else's pricing high, they're going to grab a ton of market share and probably keep that.\n\nBen: Paying consultants.\n\nDavid: I know. Here's Morris's quote about this, he says(this was in the late â60s), and Boston Consulting Group was a very smalloutfit when we did this. And we use loads of data, a lot of theory, and a lot of effort. The result was so-called learning curve pricing. We would automatically reduce (so start low), and then continually automatically reduce the price every quarter even when the market did not demand it. This was a very successful effort, even though it was somewhat controversial.\n\nA lot of people thought we were being foolish. Why would you reduce the price when you didn't have to? But we did it because we believed init, and indeed our market share just kept expanding. That combined with other strategies made the TI integrated circuits business the biggest IC business inthe world, and also the most profitable.\n\nThis is right when Intel is getting founded. So screw Fairchild and screw National. TI is kicking all of their butts and it's thanks to Morris. It's wild.\n\nBen: Interestingly enough, the ecosystem around TI, maybe I'm off on this, but the reason I always thought that Fairchild was (I suppose)successful in those days was out of all the defense spending and research that was being done at Stanford, the government as a customer. But is Texas Instruments playing in that ecosystem at all?\n\nDavid: Good question, probably. I think this is a case of the rising tide floating all boats. Yeah, Fairchild is killing it, Intel is killing it, National is killing it. TI is just killing it bigger than anybody else.\n\nBen: I see.\n\nDavid: On the back of this, Morris gets promoted to VP atTIâone level below the CEOârunning the entire semiconductor business. That happens in 1972, and he becomes the obvious leading candidate to be the next CEO of TI, which he's like, yeah, I want to do that. Yeah, I'm focused. This iswhat I love. This is my goal.\n\nBen: This is why I've been going to the bar for three years reading a textbook.\n\nDavid: Exactly. But it might be fair to say history turns on knifepoint. Things don't entirely go as planned. There are three different viewpoints (as far as I could identify) on what happens next to Morris at TI. He does not become the next CEO, obviously.\n\nViewpoint number one is simply probably unfair that he was just discriminated against because he was ethnically Chinese, although, at this point, I'm pretty sure already he was an American citizen, but anyway, he got passed over. I have no evidence for it, but not to be at all surprised that that was part of what was going on. So that's one.\n\nThe second point, which Morris totally acknowledges, TI wasa really big company. The semiconductor division. He had made it probably the most successful and the fastest rising division within the company, but you mentioned calculators. They were starting to launch the Consumer Products Division at this time.\n\nIn 1978, six years he's running the Semiconductor Division as VP, they moved him over to VP of consumer products in 1978 because this was a big new strategic initiative and it wasn't going super well. They're like,oh, Morris is a great manager. He can fix this and turn it around.\n\nBen: Different set of competencies, though, like marketing.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Here's Morris's quote on this, \"Mark Sheppard, then Chairman and CEO of TI, agreed with the prevailing wisdom at the time that a good manager could manage anything. In this case, I think he was wrong. I found the consumer business to be very different.\" like you'resaying, \"The customerâset completely different. The marketâcompletely different. And what you need to get ahead in that business is different too. Inthe semiconductor business, it's just technology and costs; in consumer,technology helps, but it's also the appeal to consumers, which is a nebulousthing.\" Not Morris's strong suit, at least not anything he's trained in.\n\nBen: Yeah, that makes total sense.\n\nDavid: In 1983âfive years after he got moved over to takeover the consumer businessâhe hasn't turned it around, it's still struggling,he gets demoted to \"head of quality and people effectiveness\", which is pretty much a slap in the face. This dude built your semiconductor business.\n\nBen: Is this when he says he was put out to pasture?\n\nDavid: Exactly, so that's number two. Here's number three. I found some evidence on this. It's unclear to me how much of this is Morris's fault versus his successor, but while Morris was definitely responsible formaking TI semiconductor a powerhouse, at some point towards either at the end of his tenure running it or under his successor, they totally dropped the ball,and this is when Silicon Valley in California takes over.\n\nIn the mid-70s, the semiconductor industry transitioned over to the metal oxide process, MOS. You ever heard about MOS, semiconductors?\n\nBen: Yeah, the precursor to CMOS.\n\nDavid: Exactly. That happened in the â70s, and TI again had the best engineer. They were well-positioned to lead this transitionâthey didn't. Actually, most of the talent within TI that were the ones that led the industry transition to MOS left, including probably most prominently a guy named LJ Sevin who left and founded a company called Mostek, and then he later became a semiconductor venture capitalist and founded Sevin Rosen Ventures,which was one of the early VC firms.\n\nHe was a TI guy and he left. The culture at TIâas shown by Morris's experience wasâthis was not like Traitorous Eight, Silicon Valley leave. It was like you're a company, man. Stay at the company. Motorola poacheda whole bunch of MOS engineers from TI, and it all kind of fell apart culminating in the biggest huge loss. This is really history turning on a knifepoint.\n\nIn 1980, Morris had already transitioned to consumer products, IBM put out a secret RFPâbid proposal for a secret project thatt hey're working on (this is 1980) by a new group based out of Boca Raton,Florida. Do you know what Iâm talking about, Ben?\n\nBen: I have no idea.\n\nDavid: Some listeners might know what I'm talking about.This is the secret project. This is the RFP to be the microprocessor, the CPU for the secret project.\n\nBen: Wait, wait, wait. What year is this?\n\nDavid: 1980.\n\nBen: 1980. No, I have no idea.\n\nDavid: The IBM PC.\n\nBen: Okay. That was out of Boca Raton?\n\nDavid: Yeah, it was a secret project like a Skunkworks division of IBM to build the PC, which is big. IBM was the mainframe company.We're going to build a personal computer. Skunkworks project, and TIâa couple of years earlier under Morrisâwould have been an obvious candidate. Remember ,he had the relationship with IBM going all the way back. TI probably should have been the processor chosen. Instead of course it was Intel. I think it wasthe 8088 that was chosen for that first one.\n\nBen: Wow. Boy did that set things in motion.\n\nDavid: Well, then the architecture standardizes on x86, andboom, there goes the whole next generation of computing away from TI over toIntel.\n\nBen: The sort of family of IBM with Intel processors and eventually running Microsoft operating systems.\n\nDavid: Then all the IBM clones all running Intel processors.\n\nBen: Okay, so this is really whereâ\n\nDavid: That's a major loss.\n\nBen: In the highway of history, TI accidentally took th eoff-ramp there.\n\nDavid: They did. Is that Morris's fault, is that no tMorrisâs? I don't know. All three of these things, certainly some discrimination, certainly the culture at TI was we rotate you around, you're going to fix consumer, he didn't fix consumer but couldn't, and then this semiconductor powerhouse took an off-ramp, as you say.\n\nAll that, his career in TI is basically over. He was the rising star. Everybody thought he was going to be the next CEO, and at age 52in 1983 after he stayed a couple of years being the head of whatever.\n\nBen: He was something of a staff employee.\n\nDavid: Yeah, he just resigned. He was like, well, I guess this is it. My career at TI, 30 yearsâdone. He's still regarded super highly inthe industry, though, in the semiconductor industry so people start calling him with opportunities.\n\nBen: He wants to be a CEO. I mean, that's whatâs on his mind.\n\nDavid: Yeah, he wanted to be CEO of TI, that didn't happen.He wants to be CEO, but he whittles it down to two opportunities he's going to consider. One is to go to a competitor called General Instrument, which people may have heard of another one of these old chip companies. It was based in Manhattan in New York City, actually, to go be their COO, the number two therewith the understanding of hey, if things go well in a couple of years, you'llreplace the CEO, become the CEO there or to become a venture capitalist.\n\nBen: Really?\n\nDavid: Yeah, he was weighing the two. I don't know where or how, I couldn't find that out, but he was weighing these two opportunities. The VC idea is going to come back up in a big way in a second, but obviously, he goes with General Instruments, GI. A) his dream is to be CEO. B) he's got this chip on his shoulder from the way TI ended, so great.\n\nHe goes off to New York. He leaves Texas. He lives in Manhattan. Things are going to work out at GI. The thing though is GI had a very different culture than TI. TI was this research, build, develop technology, push the ball forward. GI was almost (at the time) like a prototech private equity firm. Their strategy was they just acquired lots of different semiconductor businesses, either independent companies or divisions from other companies.\n\nBen: And try to integrate them.\n\nDavid: No, they would acquire them. They would get these business units in good shape and then theyâd sell them again.\n\nBen: Oh, really?\n\nDavid: Yeah. Literally, they were like a financial engineering firm, basically. Definitely not Morris's cup of tea. He only stays there a year. It's clear that that's not a good fit, so he resigned again.Within less than 18 months, he's had two major, major setbacks in his career.\n\nBasically, his dream is over. Here's the quote from him. H esays, \"Ater these two setbacks, at TI and GI, I did not think that my aspiration to be the CEO of a major US company was in the cards.\" Well,turns out he was right. He was not going to be the CEO of a major US company.\n\nHow do we go from this dude in his mid-50s, former rising star, now washed up from that to he's in Taiwan, he's CEO of TSMC? I don't think you could ever script this out. I think this is probably the most unique.Every founding story is unique, but I think this might be the most unique founding story we've had on Acquired so far.\n\nBack when Morris was at TIâwhen he was running the semiconductor business thereâhe went over to Taiwan a couple of times to talk about building a manufacturing plant there. TI would own and build a manufacturing plant, but they would outsource to Taiwan, not like a TSMC-stylebusiness. It was a TI plant there. He had no connection to Taiwan. Remember,he's Chinese. He's not from Taiwan, people are like oh, Morris, you went backto Taiwan. He didn't go back to Taiwan.\n\nBen: Yeah, he talks about how Taiwan was a strange land to him when he first got there. That it's not going back. It's not the land is a strange place to him, but like if he is going to call someplace home and return there, is it the People's Republic of China?\n\nDavid: Well, I think he would say at this point, it's America. He's been in America.\n\nBen: That's a great point.\n\nDavid: He's a US citizen. I don't know what he would say.It's complicated. Anyway, he had met a bunch of government officials in Taiwan when he was talking about building this plant over there, and that was back in the â70s. Now we're in the mid-80s, Taiwan at this point, it's a manufacturing nation. They have no IP, no technology.\n\nBen: Itâs a great Morris quote, you have it? Okay, the quoteâs great. All right, so this is Morris:\n\n\"We had no strength in research and development, orvery little anyway. We had no strength in circuit design, IC product design. We had little strength in sales and marketing,\" and this is of course,referring to Taiwan as a nation, \"and we had almost no strength in intellectual property. The only possible strength in Taiwan that we had, andeven that was just a potential one, not an obvious one, was semiconductor manufacturing, wafer manufacturing. And so what kind of company would youcreate to fit that strength and avoid all the other weaknesses? The answer wasa pure-play foundry.\"\n\nDavid: Yeah, that was Taiwan at the time. To give you asense, the typical gross margin, like the average gross margin of a Taiwanese company at this point in time in the mid-'80s, is 4%â5%. 04%â05% gross margin.\n\nBen: Before you even have overhead operating costs.\n\nDavid: Yeah. If you grew up around when Ben and I did, sortof born in the â80s in the US, you see made in Taiwan on everything like Barbie dolls, toys, clothes. Everything was made in Taiwan. Now it's made in China,made in Vietnam, or elsewhere, but made in Taiwan was super low-end physical manufacturing stuff.\n\nBen: Yeah, and a way pull forward the seven powers section,as Hamilton Helmer would sort of explain, if your margins, particularly your gross margins, are only 4% or 5%, you're in an industry or a business where allthe profits are arbitraged away, everyone's just race to the bottom on prices,and no one's able to build any real enterprise value because everyone's just out-competing each other for pure commodity.\n\nDavid: I mean, 4%â5% gross margins, people used to hammer o nAmazon, I guess, for being a low gross margin business in the 40%. Anyway, I can't even imagine running a company with that level of gross margins.\n\nThe Taiwanese government wanted to come up in the world.They're like, this is where we are now, this is not where we want to be. They knew that technology was the way. They had decided back in the â70s that they would establish an initiative called the Industrial Technology Research Institute or ITRI, and the goal was for it to become like the Bell Labs ofTaiwan to do some tech transfers from the US and elsewhere, home grow some real technology businesses in Taiwan so that maybe they can lift businesses out ofpoverty there at least.\n\nBen: Morris wasn't going to Taiwan to start TSMC.\n\nDavid: No.\n\nBen: He was being recruited to ITRI.\n\nDavid: One of the ministers he had met, a guy named K.T. Li,because of this, he would also become venerated in Taiwanese history. He's known as the Father of Taiwan's economic miracle literally because of this.\n\nHe recruits Morris to come over and run ITRI like be the head of Bell Labs Taiwan, essentially. This is a ridiculous thing for Morris todo. He had been captain of the American semiconductor industry, the fourth League. He was put out to pasture at TI, but at least he was still at TI. Then he was COO at General Instrument. He's going to go over to Taiwan and run a Research Park there, like what?\n\nBen: Every time someone starts something like this, it doesn't go well. A government top-down innovation mandate from a country that's not a world power tends not to turn into a gigantic economic success.\n\nDavid: This is like all the countries and cities that are like, we're going to build the next Silicon Valley in XYZ. We're going to recruit some former Silicon Valley person to come do that, and it's going to work. Probably not going to work.\n\nEverybody tells him not to do this, all his former colleagues. His wife at the time told him not to do this. His marriage was actually falling apart maybe in part because of this. He's had all these experiences. He's like, you know what, I just need a change of scene. I got to get out of here. So he takes the job and he figures it's going to be cushy.This is like a soft landing.\n\nBen: He thinks about this as like the pseudo retirement he's going into.\n\nDavid: Totally. Here's his quote, \"By then I was financially pretty secure. I was not rich, but you also have to realize that the standards of wealth were much lower back in 1985.\" And he's going to live in Taiwan where corporate magnets have 5% gross margins. He says,\"But still in absolute standards, I was financially secure which meant that I could live according to the way I desire, which was actually pretty modest... for the rest of my life without having to earn a living or asalary.\" This is retirement.\n\nBen: He also makes a joke (I remember after that) about how by the way, interest rates were higher back then, so that was much more achievable on less principle.\n\nDavid: Totally. 1985, he goes over. He takes over as President of ITRI. It's kind of a culture clash. This is retirement for Morris,but he's still coming from this hard-charging industry. All of the employees of ITRI are people in government jobs in Taiwan, and government jobs, not even ina democracy because Taiwan is under martial law or I think that it just ended.This is not the same. These are all like jobs for life. You're a governmentofficial in a non-democracy-type organization.\n\nMorris says, \"Back then they considered me a foreigner who suddenly became their boss. They were scared of me,\" and they wereright to be scared of him. There was one thing though, that the government had done right before Morris showed up, which was they had successfully negotiated one technology transfer license in the semiconductor industry fromâdid you find out what company this was? This is probably what they were trying to negotiate with TI for.\n\nBen: I do. It's a three-letter acronym, isn't it?\n\nDavid: Yup, yup, yup. We haven't talked much about it on this show, but this is another talking about captains of American industry.\n\nBen: Who was it?\n\nDavid: RCA.\n\nBen: RCA, that's right.\n\nDavid: RCA semiconductor line and the government in theâ70sâthe Taiwanese governmentâhad negotiated a tech transfer.\n\nBen: But this is like 10-year-old conductor technology,right? This is not the latest generation.\n\nDavid: No, TI, Intel, everybody, and Fairchild, they're leading the way. They're the bleeding edge of the semiconductor manufacturing process. RCA was already at least a generation behind. By the time it actually gets onto the ground in Taiwan, they're two and a half generations behind the leading producers.\n\nBen: It's like the only thing that you can do with that is...\n\nDavid: Super low-end stuff.\n\nBen: Right. There are some categories of goods that don't need fast or the latest processor.\n\nDavid: Totally, even today when TSMC, Intel, Samsung, or whoever built the fab, the leading-edge fabs produce the leading-edge stuff for a while, and then the new generations come on. They don't shut down the old ones. It's just chips that don't need the same bleeding-edge performance, they keep getting made on the old ones.\n\nBen: Often that's automotive or now what we think of as IoT,but the stuff in your smartphone, obviously is the leading edge.\n\nDavid: The government, ITRI, does actually spit out a company using this old RCA technology that would be called UMC, United Microelectronics Corporation. Not a technology leader. It actually does okay inthe long run. They would later spin out their own chip design business. UMC wasdoing both fabrications for third-party clients and designing some of their own chips with the fab that they created. They spin out their chip design businesslater, that becomes MediaTek.\n\nBen: Oh, no way.\n\nDavid: Yeah, which is a $50 billion company today. The government did pretty good.\n\nBen: Yeah, totally.\n\nDavid: This is pretty good what they were doing. When Morris arrives because of this, he's not starting from a standing start. It's good,but some assets donât fit.\n\nBen: They've acquired IP. They've created a company. There's a paved path.\n\nDavid: He gets to work at ITRI. He is working on all this.He's transforming the organization into a high-performing organization. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, K.T. Li comes back to him and heâs like, hey,great, you're running our Bell Labs, you're running ITRI. Now I want you to start a company.\n\nMorris is like, uhh. K.Tâs like, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't want you to have somebody else in ITRI do it. I want you, Morris Chang, to start a new semiconductor company here in Taiwan and I want you to make it into a global leader. Morris is like, uhm, okay. I think he doesn't say this directly, but he's got a great quote I'm going to say in a minute. Remember this is not a democracy in Taiwan at this time.\n\nMorris is also on his third job in three years. Yeah, he doesn't need a salary to survive, but this is kind of the end of the road forhim. If he gets fired, here at ITRI, he's legit done. He kind of doesn't have a choice here. The quoteâthis is so Morris, itâs so great. He says, \"It was like in the movie The Godfather. It was an offer I couldn't refuse.\"\n\nBen: I do think the implication was go start an Intel, or gostart an IDM. It wasn't, go start the very first pure-play foundry.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Li was the government. He was a minister. He was like, go start a semiconductor company and make it a world leader.\n\nBen: Right. Those semiconductor companies, they do really well, so go do that.\n\nDavid: Do that here.\n\nBen: That's, of course, when Morris says, okay, I'm being told I should do this. I have some latitude I can take and some liberties I can take on how I do it. The quote that I read earlier about evaluating exactly what type of semiconductor company should I start, that's how he then forms thebusiness plan.\n\nDavid: Lee is like, all right, good. We're capeesh, we're clear. Come back to me in a week with a business plan, tell me what you need,and we're going to make this happen. Morris is like, okay, a week. All right.\n\nThen a day later, Li supposedly is like, actually, Iâm going to need you to come in on Friday, so you got three days. They say necessity isthe mother of invention, and yeah, these three days are what creates the now ninth most valuable company in the world. Morris comes up with this brilliant idea to create a pure-play foundry companyâto be a contract manufacturer.\n\nBen: Sounds genius. Today, in hindsightâas Steve Jobs would sayâit's easy to connect the dots looking backward, but at that time, was this a good idea, David?\n\nDavid: Well, no. The answer is no. Like we've sort of said all along, all the chip companiesâall the American, European, and Japaneseâall the leading semiconductor companies made their own stuff. And there was some sharing of production and some companies were emerging that were borrowing production from the big guys.\n\nThere's a great quote right around this time from Jerry Sanders who was the co-founder and CEO of AMD. He famously said in themid-1980s, that \"real men have fabs.\"\n\nBen: That's right. What a quote.\n\nDavid: So ironic because in the 2000s, AMD would spin outits fabs and go fabless.\n\nBen: Global foundries.\n\nDavid: Yeah, going to global foundries. But yeah, this was not an obvious idea. If you wanted to be a real semiconductor company, you made your own chips. The idea was, yeah, this isn't manufacturing Barbie dolls here.This is real technology. You need to control its soup to nuts.\n\nBen: And already at this point in history, this is a nimportant point to make because I didn't realize this coming in where I thought, wow, Apple really outsources their manufacturing. They outsource some of it to TSMC and some of it to Foxconn. Maybe some of those people will start to do each other's work. No, this is a completely different thing.\n\nAssembling an iPhone is completely, completely different than taking a brand new design for the next-generation chip and manufacturing that chip. One is manufacturing and one is alchemy. The alchemy can only be done by alchemists. I think even here in the late â80s, we're already at th epoint where it's manufacturing broadly.\n\nDavid: You need to be a magician to do this.\n\nBen: Yeah. It's not like, well, I got a factory.\n\nDavid: No. No, no, no, no, no. The opposite of that. We saida minute ago, this is a bad idea. However, there was one problem with thepure-play foundry model, and it was a fatal problem. It could be a fatal problem, which was, where's the market? He sounds like Don Valentine here.Where's the market? Show me the market. This whole idea was really a solutio nlooking for a problem.\n\nBen: Of course, the solution being that all we have is manufacturing capability here. So let's start a company that just manufactures,and you're looking around like, okay, whose stuff are we going to manufacture?\n\nDavid: You got Jerry over at AMD. Heâs like, \"Real men have fabs.\" There are startups, but all these startups are building their own fabs, nobody wants to do this. Nonetheless, he has to start a company. Heâs literally got a gun to his head.\n\nBen: But he does have the core insight here. It's interesting, these companies don't exist yet, but Morris has reason to believe that people will want to start fabless chip companies and that they will need afoundry to fab those chips.\n\nHe says, \"When I was at TI and General Instruments Isaw a lot of integrated circuit designers wanting to leave and set up their own business, but the one thing or the biggest thing that stopped them from leaving those companies was they couldn't raise enough money to form their own company.Because at the time,\" as we were just sayingâreal men, \"it wasthought that every company needed manufacturing, needed their wafer manufacturing, and the most capital intensive part of a semiconductor company,of an IC company (does the manufacturing). I saw those people wanting to leave,but being stopped by the lack of ability to raise a lot of money and build awafer fab.\"\n\nDavid: Totally, right? Those companies, if you build it,they will come.\n\nBen: They haven't started.\n\nDavid: They haven't come yet. Morris is like, he knows what the long-term market is going to be, but he's got to find the short-term market. He needs some real politics here, so what's that going to be? So he says, well, maybe I can go around to the big guys. Just like my first thing back at TI, they've been doing some line-sharing for either new products thatthey need excess capacity for, or for older products that they need to transition some fabs but they still need to make components. Maybe I can takesome of that off their hands.\n\nHe goes around. He talks to Intel. He talks to TI. He talks to everybody in the industry. Then he talks to Motorola, like, sure, fine. And the government had told him, we know it's going to take a lot of money to setup a fab. We're good for half of it, but you got to go raise the other half o it. And we want you to raise it from Intel or TIâsomebody who's going to beyour first customer and they're going to be bought in.\n\nSo he does the rounds. He goes and talks to everybody. Hegets meetings with Intel. He gets meetings with TI. They're both like, Morris,we like you, but no. So heâs at the last-ditch effort and he has a meeting with Philips, the Dutch company. They have a semiconductor business. He has a great quote about this. He would describe Philips as the first rung of the second raiders in semiconductors, but they were the only interested option. They putup 28% of the capital. The government puts up 50%. It ends up being $220million in total.\n\nBen: $110 million is probably a lot more than what the Taiwanese government thought they were going to find here.\n\nDavid: Literally the Premier of Taiwan, the head of the government, has to then go around to all the other business leaders in Taiwan and strong-arm them into investing the rest of it. The other 22% I guess?\n\nBen: Yeah, we all should quickly say, remember, that Philips was a Dutch company because that's going to come into play later.\n\nDavid: I don't know how that's going to come into play.\n\nBen: Yeah. Putting a pin in Dutch.\n\nDavid: Okay, okay, we got a surprise coming. I'm going to be surprised here. We're doing it in real-time. Weâre doing it live. This may be the craziest part about the whole TSMC founding story. I'm 99.9% sure, Ben, youdo not know this. Do you know what the pre-money valuation was on TSMC?\n\nBen: No, I couldn't find that anywhere.\n\nDavid: It was $0. Morris Chang got no equity. Zero.\n\nBen: So 100% of the company was owned by the investors?\n\nDavid: Fifty percent by the government and the other 50%were owned by the investors. Morris got nothing.\n\nBen: And just got to keep his salary.\n\nDavid: He was a government employee.\n\nBen: Wow.\n\nDavid: There by the grace of the government.\n\nBen: Oh my God.\n\nDavid: Isn't that unbelievable? This is so the opposite of Silicon Valley.\n\nBen: How is he worth $3 billion today?\n\nDavid: Well, what he didâas TSMC started to workâhe basically put all of his money into buying. He bought his own shares in the company. I don't know if it was privately. They went public on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1994, and then the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. But yeah, heput basically all of his excess cash flow into buying TSMC shares.\n\nBen: Oh my god.\n\nDavid: Isn't that wild?\n\nBen: So the government-owned 50% of the whole business.\n\nDavid: And you can see their perspective too. Theyâre like,hey, we hired you to do this, and then we told you to do this. You are our footsoldier. We are the mafia.\n\nBen: Wow. Yeah. Things had really not gone well in his career that he was willing to take that deal.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Crazy. Before we go on in the TSMC story, we need to have two real quick sidebars.\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nDavid: We're talking about the summer of 1987 when TSMC got officially set up. They raised the money at a $0 pre-money valuation. Do you know what other big thing happened in 1987âwe have covered it on this showâinthe chip world?\n\nBen: Is this the founding of ARM?\n\nDavid: Yes, it is. ARMâJV between Apple, Acorn, and VLSI Logic, which was the manufacturing partner. They were an A6 company. That's a whole nother sidebar we're not going to get into. But yeah, 1987. What a year\n\nBen: Brand new, unconventional, instruction set architecture. It is totally different from the x86 stuff that the whole industry and world seem to standardize on at this point.\n\nDavid: The Annus Mirabilis for the semiconductor industry.\n\nBen: Useless, right? In 1987 it's hamstrung, it's very few instructions. PCs are always plugged in, so what do we need a low-power chip for? This thing's pathetic.\n\nDavid: Real men have fabs and use power. Okay, so that's sidebar number oneâARM gets started.\n\nBen: Okay. I was wondering, I don't actually know the relationship. Obviously, today, a huge volume of TSMCâs manufacturing is making chips for iPhones, which since the outset has used ARM.\n\nDavid: Chips that are using all mobile devicesâiPhones and Androidâall of which are ARM, and lots of servers that are ARM.\n\nBen: Presumably, there's some relationship coming between TSMC and ARM.\n\nDavid: Well, they're really close partners. This stuff is so integrated. Architecture companies like ARM, the EDA companies like Synopsysâthe engineering is all deeply embedded with one another.\n\nBen: Okay, so you mentioned EDA, I'm going to take your sidebar.\n\nDavid: You're going to raise me.\n\nBen: Raise you one more sidebar, so listeners, weâre twoclicks out here. This is a pretty good point to talk about how the value chain went from one company that created transistors and then they designed the chip,manufactured the chip, and marketed the chip. Here's how the value chain lookstoday. I think in the â80s, it already started to look like this.\n\nFirst, there's EDA. There's Electronic Design Automation.This is the software that professional chip designers use to do their work. So Synopsys, I think Cadence is another big one.\n\nDavid: Yeah, Cadence. They're the two leaders. That's Excelor Figma for chip designers. That's what they use.\n\nBen: Productivity tools. So that's category 1 of 4. Ofcourse, as you can imagine, the software to design the chips probably has to be very aware of the manufacturing capability of who's going to be manufacturing the chips. Let's put a pause on that for a second. Then, of course, there are the fabless chip design companies. So today, think Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm,eventually AMD after they stopped being real men, apparently.\n\nDavid: Tons of innovative new startups now like Cerebras.\n\nBen: P. A. Semi before Apple acquired it.\n\nDavid: Tesla. Yeah. P. A. Semi is coming in a sec.\n\nBen: Okay. So you've got the EDA companies that are making the software, the fabless companies that are designing the chips using the software.Then third, there's one company that we have not talked about yetâone component of the value chain, and these are the people that manufacture the machines that go into the factories that the foundries operate.\n\nDavid: There's actually one above EDA. There is one more part of the value chain. There's a fifth, which is IP. So that's all like ARM.\n\nBen: Oh, right.\n\nDavid: Yeah, like architecture, IP. There's actually a ton of companies now that do just straight-up IP. I thought before this episode,these were like, oh, just shell companies that sue one another about IP. It's not that. Systems are on a chip now. It's like everything is on one chip,basically. You need USB functionality in your chip. You don't need to design that. You just buy some IP off the shelf. There are companies that do that.\n\nBen: Yup. Okay. That's a good point. That's our fifth IP.They own the instruction set architecture. They kind of create the general rules that you're playing by when you're designing a chip such that whoever is writing the compilers knows what assembly language they're targeting, that cant hen operate on the chip that's going to be designed. We covered the EDA, wecovered the IP, we covered the fabless companies. There's somebody before weget to the foundries, which are the equipment manufacturers that sell to TSMC.\n\nMore historically, you've got Lam Research, you've got Applied Materials in the US, you've got Tokyo Electron in Japan. But todayâI just want to give everyone a taste of this and then we'll get more to it laterâthere's a company that is also Dutch-based called ASML, which was originally ASM Lithography. Lithography is marginally in scope for this episode. There's a whole thing we could do on the magical process that is lithography.\n\nDavid: Take me back to my high school photo lab.\n\nBen: Right? And the L is lithography. So the company was originally called ASM Lithography. They make the most advanced chip manufacturing machines in the world. They're the only company that makes them.They're located still in the Netherlands. Their biggest customer is TSMC. Thisis where I want to bring it all the way back around, and we of course will talkabout the magic that is these machines later. It was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Advanced Semiconductor Materials InternationalâASM Lithographyand Philips.\n\nDavid: Oh, wow. I did not know that. Thatâs crazy.\n\nBen: That is the beginning of the relationship between TSMC and their equipment provider.\n\nDavid: What a strategic point. It's TSMCâs insane capital operating cash flow production that enables them to spend CapEx above anybody else that allows them to buy more ASML equipment than anyone else. But that relationship, wow. These machinesâwe'll get into it later. It's going to blow your mind what this stuff does. Back to my second sidebar, also going to beworth it, P. A. Semi, right?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nDavid: We did an episode, it was like episode 20 something.\n\nBen: This is like when Acquired was a very different show when it was actually about small acquisitions.\n\nDavid: Totally. I don't know that we actually covered this,but I uncovered it in the research for this episode. Do you know the origins ofP. A. Semi?\n\nBen: No, I don't.\n\nDavid: Okay, so ARM, my sidebar number oneâ1987 also created. Theyâre just an IP design company like I was saying in your sidebar.\n\nBen: It's like Inception over here.\n\nDavid: They just license out the ARM architecture to other companies that then design using the ARM architecture. One of their original licensees was DEC, Digital Equipment Corporation, OG way back in the day. So they took the ARM architecture and tuned it for performance. They called what they did at DECâtheir version of ARM that they createdâStrongARM. That productline within DEC would later be acquired by Intel of all places. Crazy why Intelacquired an ARM architecture.\n\nBen: Right. They're the x86.\n\nDavid: Yeah, they remarketed it as XScale. I think they ended up shutting it down. So a bunch of the core engineers on the team like the deck team that I've been working with ARM from back in the day, and they're like, we just got acquired by Intel. What the hell? Screw this. We don't want to go work for Intel, weâre ARM.\n\nBen: There are no interesting flourishing alternative architectures at Intel.\n\nDavid: Yeah, we're ARM engineers. We're going to go startour own company.\n\nBen: That's P. A. Semi?\n\nDavid: That's P. A. Semi.\n\nBen: Of course, the underpinnings of all of Apple's chipstoday.\n\nDavid: Totally. The lineage of all of Apple siliconâprobably the most valuable defensible part of Apple today in terms of technologyâwas ARMand DEC to Intel to P. A. Semi to Apple.\n\nBen: That's wild. I don't think I ever knew that. So you cant race Apple silicon all the way back to Apple.\n\nDavid: Yeah, because ARM was a JV with Apple.\n\nBen: Yeah. Crazy.\n\nDavid: With Intel and DEC. Wow. Okay, so back to TSMC.Morris basically begs all of his old colleagues in the US, European, andJapanese semiconductor industries to just give the dregs to TSMC. And it really was the dregs. Here's Morris on what this was. \"The IDMs would let usmanufacture their wafers only when they didn't have capacity, or when theydidn't want to manufacture the stuff themselves anymore. Now, when they didn'thave the capacity, and asked us to do the manufacturing, then as soon as theygot the capacity, they would stop giving us orders, so it wasn't a stablemarket.\"\n\nBen: It wasn't actually a thing they wanted to outsource.They were just using them for availableâ\n\nDavid: They didn't have the capacity so they needed someextra excess space. But then when they got the capacity online, they took itaway. The chips that they gave us that they didn't want to make anymore, thereason they didn't want to make it was because it was losing money. Theybasically were just transferring their losses on producing these chips to TSMC.\n\nBen: How did they get out of this?\n\nDavid: Morris continues, \"The conventional conclusionat the time was that there was no market. That's why the pure-play foundry ideawas so poorly thought of. What very few people saw, and I can't tell you that Isaw was the rise of the fabless industry, I only hoped for it.\" As yousaid, \"But I had better reasons for hoping for it than the people at Intel,TI, and Motorola because I was now standing outside. When I was at TI andGeneral Instruments, I saw a lot of these IC designers wanting to leave, start their own businesses, and the constraint is setting up their own fabs.\"\n\nYes, he saw that at TI, but remember, he had been considering becoming a VC instead of going over to E3. This is the ultimate endround. He becomes essentially the world's best semiconductor VC. He takes ani ndex out on the whole future innovation and entrepreneurship market in semiconductors by becoming the platform that they're going to build on, instead of going and investing in them. He enables all of it. He's like the Y Combinator of semiconductors.\n\nBen: Right, or in many ways, the Tencent. Tencent, ofcourse, also does direct investing. But the idea that you could get distribution through WeChatâit's not distribution, but it is manufacturing.There is a thing that you have to raise 10%â20% of the capital that youotherwise would have needed to raise if TSMC exists.\n\nDavid: Yup. Just like Don Valentine when he left to go join VC a generation earlier, and again, this is not VC, it's TSMC building theplatform. But Morris is a hero. All these engineers all look up to him. He knows a lot of them personally. The ones he doesn't know, like, who's not going to take a meeting with Morris Chang?\n\nBen: He almost ran TI.\n\nDavid: Totally. He did all this amazing stuff.\n\nBen: It's interesting because it's like with the incumbents because they had it in their DNA to be a manufacturer, of course, they wanted to take the most profitable things and manufacture them in-house. But if youa ctually are betting on all these startups that will never develop DNA to be their own manufacturer, they never want to take that back.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Morris is now going out and evangelizing, and he's like, all these great designers, we're an option for you now. You want to leave, you want to start your own income? You don't need a fab, we'll be your fab. It takes a couple of years. For a couple of years, TSMC has to survive on the dregs from the IDBMs, the big guys. But after a couple of years, these startups get going. Little companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, Marvell,Nvidiaâthese are all started with TSMC.\n\nBen: Nvidia was started in 1993, only ever raised $20million, and never opened their own fab.\n\nDavid: I believe 100% with TSMC. Well, maybe they have other sources in other foundries too, but the vast majority of their businessâJensen talks about this. It took him actually a little while to get on Morris's radar.But once he did, the vast majority of Nvidia's chips, TSMC makes them. Nvidiais what, like a $350 billion, $400 billion market cap company now.\n\nBen: It's wild.\n\nDavid: They only raised $20 million. It's like AWS for chip companiesânever would have been possible before. This is what's super cool. I don't think Morris saw this. This even exceeds his wildest dreams. He was hoping for this fabless market to take off, but this creates this insane flywheel for TSMC. The fabless market starts to grow, which they're seeding and enabling it. As that happens, TSMCâs revenue grows.\n\nBen: Because they have 50% gross margins and 40% operating margins, they can take that profit and apply more advanced machinery to build more fabs.\n\nDavid: Advance the level of their technology. Remember, they were starting from behind on technology. Within about 10 years, they catch up,and then they start to exceed everybody else. As they pushed the manufacturing process technology forward, they're manufacturing better chips with smalle process links. They're enabling their customers, which are the fablesscompanies, to get better and better performance.\n\nAs they get better performance, the fabless companies can address more of the market and more use cases. Their existing customers get bigger and new fabless customers start, which gives them more revenue, which repeats the whole cycle. It goes slow. Like any flywheel. It takes a lot of effort and a lot of time to start turning it.\n\nFast forward to now. In the early 2000s, when TSMC finally caught up to the leading edge level of technology with other semiconductor companies, there were 22 companies that were at the leading edge. Let's call ita 150-nanometer process or something like that at that point in time.Twenty-two and TSMC finally broke into the pack. They were one of the 22. Bythe late 2000s, it had gone from 22 down to 14 that were at the leading edge.By the mid-2010s, there were six.\n\nBen: It's basically Samsung and TSMC, right?\n\nDavid: Today, there are two at 5-nanometer processesâthe current leading edge. It's only TSMC and Samsung. Intel has been trying to getthere, but they haven't been able to. They've fallen behind. The next process is going to be 3 nanometers. TSMC is going to launch that next year.\n\nBen: Which by the way, just slipped six months.\n\nDavid: Interesting. Well, Samsung has already slipped to2024.\n\nBen: Whoa.\n\nDavid: So very likely in the next process, itâs just going to be TSMC.\n\nBen: Which means that you will see that on an Apple slide somewhere announcing the next iPhone talking about how it's a 3-nanometerprocess. They'll take all the credit for it. And TSMC is totally fine with that because their job is not to market. It's to empower their customers.\n\nDavid: This flywheel, it's just unreal what happens here.They run the table on the whole industry.\n\nBen: It is interesting. The industry went from vertical to horizontally integrated, where the very best products in the market became horizontally integrated. I'm trying to figure out what drove that. I guess there's a couple of components to it. One is the speed at which Moore's Lawhappens makes it such that you can't be good at everything. You can't be goodat everything from EDA, to making the manufacturing equipment, to running themanufacturing process, to designing the chips. You're not going to write yourown instruction set architecture. People did need to break into the best of class.\n\nDavid: Morris got this great quote about this that I have inhere. He says, \"The semiconductor business is like a treadmill that speeds up all the time. If you can't keep up, you fall off.\" And that's Moore's Law. From 22, down to 2, down to 1. Even when their competitors are only doing the one thing that TSMC has done, if you fall behind by a step, you're toast.\n\nBen: Right. There's this big part of it that you're talking about that hasn't come up in other episodes because we tend not to talk about companies that require a lot of manufacturing prowess. In order to stay on that treadmill, the number of tens of billions of dollars that you need to be spending on CapEx is going up. You need to be enormously profitable so you canbuild the factories for the next generation.\n\nDavid: Yeah. There are two things. Yes, that is 100% true.TSMC just announced they're going to spend $100 billion in CapEx over the next three years, $30 billion this year, $60 billion over the next two, and I bet that keeps going up. That's a lot of billions. You might even say, this is so strategically important and people are talking about this. Certainly, China'stalking about this. The US government's now talking about this. Governmentsmight need to come in with a bazooka of money and create other options.\n\nAlmost all their manufacturing is in Taiwan. It's in this strategically, geopolitically challenged location. We need to re-onshore some of this in the US. China, of course, wants their own. You can't just spend the money and do this. The US government could come in and say we're going to spenda trillion dollars this year to do this. They can't do it becauseâwe're goingto get the powers laterâthereâs this marriage of scale economies and processpower that TSMC has in this industry.\n\nThere is no amount of money you could spend to catch up next year. You can't because engineering is so hard and the learning curve takes decades to get to this point. I was listening to a podcastâBloomberg Odd Lots podcasts about thisâwhere they're talking about this and the reporter who covers TSMC is great. They have some questions, like, will China just spend a billiondollars and create their own fabs? And they're doing this.\n\nBen: What's the company called? SMIC?\n\nDavid: Yes. SMIC.\n\nBen: Basically, TSMC seems to have picked the side in the US, with a little bit of prodding I'm sure from various presidential administrations over the last five years.\n\nDavid: Yeah. The guy who covers TSMC was like, they can do that and they are doing that, but they wouldn't know what to do with it. It's not because they're dumb.\n\nBen: It's the hardest thing in the world to do this stuff.To make the equipment that ASML does and to manufacture the way that TSMC does it is the hardest thing to do in the world.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Anybody else could get all the same equipment from ASML.\n\nBen: Actually, that's not true.\n\nDavid: Oh no. Iâm saying, even if you could, you wouldn't know what to do with it.\n\nBen: Right.\n\nDavid: It's not because you're dumb. There are only a small number of people in the world that can operate this stuff.\n\nBem: All right, I'm jumping out of my seat here. I'm going to do the ASML thing now. The reason that some people can't get their hands on the ASML equipment is because the Netherlands did not renew their trade agreement with China.\n\nAlso likely, it has been reported that probably that is because of US prodding to say, hey, these pieces of equipment you're making seem pretty specialized. You're the only person in the world who can do it. It makes the most cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing technology. Ah, maybe let's not sell that to SMIC in China, so they're not doing that. You might say,oh, come on, how hard can this stuff be?\n\nDavid: Tell us then what these machines do.\n\nBen: Well, first of all, they cost $200 million for a machine that makes the chips. That's going to go up to $300 million. By the way, on a lot of this, we have a lot of thank-yous for John Bathgate and Britton Johns, from the episode of the knowledge project that they went on totalk about a lot of this stuff.\n\nIt takes four 747s to ship one of these machines. You're TSMC, you buy one, and it arrives. Of course, the 747s, then there's a crew of ASML employees on-site, not only to assemble it, but then to help you run it. Like you mentioned, these companies are deeply integrated with each other to be able to pull this off.\n\nDavid: What does running it mean? What do these machines do?\n\nBen: It becomes exponentially harder to manufacture chips the more dense they are. So David, you mentioned 150 nanometers or so from several years back. We know now that the M1s are made on this 5-nanometerprocess. Well, the wavelength of white light (of regular light) is 193 nanometers.\n\nDavid: That seems like a problem.\n\nBen: Well, it's certainly wide. But we're humans, we come up with clever solutions. We can solve this. So you shoot it through a lens or maybe you shoot it through some water.\n\nDavid: Like a laser?\n\nBen: Well, not yet. But even that really only gets us tolike 11 nanometers. How the heck are we supposed to make these chips where the transistors are ostensibly only 5 nanometers apart? When what we've done todateâshooting through lenses and shooting through waterâgets us to 11 nanometers?\n\nWell, okay, this is crazy. You have to create a plasma. What they do, and this is called extreme ultraviolet light or EUVâthis is a process that is just wild. On one side of the machine, you drop molten tin. On the other side of the machine, you then hit it with a highly specialized laser. You perfectly pulse them. It explodes into a plasma, which creates extremeultraviolet light. Of course, this is hard enough to do as you can imagine howthat might work, but you actually have to do that 50,000 times per second.\n\nDavid: Yeah. What I read is that the accuracy with whichthat laser needs to hit the drop of the molten tin is more precise than the calculations to send the Apollo missions to the moon. You got to do that 50,000times a second.\n\nBen: Unbelievable. Think a little bit more about this. Wait a minute, that wavelength is so small, we're going shy of 11 nanometers here.We're going to 5 nanometers, 3 nanometers, that actually it is absorbed by all known mirrors, which were used to reflecting light. But they don't reflect this light because the wavelength is so small. Part of this process involvesreflecting it a bunch of timesâlike 20 or somethingâbefore etching the silicon.So what do we do?\n\nASML actually needed to invent a new type of mirror to do this. They also needed a contract with a German company to make this special type of laser, which is the only known company in the world capable of making it. This is crazy hard stuff. They only make 50 of these machines per year orso. They used to have competitors like Nikon used to compete with ASML on this,but it's too hard, they gave up. That's how hard extreme ultravioletlithography is.\n\nOf course, we haven't talked a lot about this and I think it's outside the scope of the show, but just to overly simplifyâlithography iskind of the process of taking that silicon wafer and etching a design on it. Ifwe want to do that in smaller and smaller ways, we got to do it with more andmore specialized equipment. At the end of the day, if you want to make the M2,the M3, the 18x bionic whatever it's going to be called, there is no other wayto make it than this extreme cutting-edge alchemy.\n\nDavid: It truly is alchemy.\n\nBen: You're a government, you want to throw a $100 billionâ\n\nDavid: Acquired is really doing well. We're on a tear here.Weâve got power, weâve got brand power. We got network economies. We got our community. We're doing well. We should invest in it. We should [...]opportunity. We should compete with TSMC. Screw the governments, weâll do it.We've got a couple of $100 million. Weâll buy this stuff. You have a CS degree.You're the more technical one. You can run this stuff. When we get the shipments from ASML, you can make this happen.\n\nBen: I wouldn't know the first thing to do. Even if we could invest the cash, even if we could build the facility, even if we could buy the machinesâwhich by the way, that's going to be hard because there's 50 some on backorder. I can't even get them for a couple of years.\n\nDavid: TSMC has ordered out all of them for years.\n\nBen: It takes people who have done the most advanced manufacturing in the world ever in history in order to know how to do the next version of it.\n\nDavid: This is why TSMC has 40% operating margins.\n\nBen: It's crazy.\n\nDavid: Totally crazy.I'm just in awe of this.\n\nBen: Completely.\n\nDavid: Okay, so alittle while back before we get totally geeked out on that, which was awesome,you said something like, how do we get this flywheel effect? It's great, but how do we really get from TSMC started taking the dregs from the IDMs, then the fabless companies came along. How do we get from there to now? There's anotherr eally important chapter here.\n\nBen: You're going to flash us forward from â93, â95 to 2010-ish. Is that what's about to happen?\n\nDavid: 2008. First,we'll stop in 2005. So 2005, things are going well, better than Morris ever imagined. These fabless companies are getting started. Nvidia is killing it. Iwas making gaming PCs at the time. I wanted those Nvidia GPUs.\n\nBen: But Nvidia wasn' ta top 20 stock in the world.\n\nDavid: No. Nvidia,come on, real men have fabs. Okay, maybe we're beyond that part, but they weremaking GPUs. Nvidiaâs stock track to whether they won the next Sony contract for the next PlayStation or the Xbox.\n\nBen: That was the market for GPUs.\n\nDavid: That was the market, right. Great market, but it's not what we're talking about here.\n\nBen: It's not abou tmachine learning. It's not about crypto. It's like, is the next PlayStation going to include your chip or not?\n\nDavid: Totally. But still, great for TSMC. It's awesome. 2005, Morris is 74 years old. He's like,all right, I did it. I did it and I've been buying TSMC stock with my ownmoney. It's done well enough. I didn't really need to work anyway. I'm going tocall it. I'm going to retire. Ready to retire, ready right off into the sunset.He hands the reins of TSMC over to his longtime Lieutenant, Rick Tsai, and here tires. He spent a couple of years. He's just chilling. I don't know what he's doing.\n\nHe loves literature.He's reading all sorts of stuff. He's on a second marriage, credits to his second wife for really reinvigorating him and inspiring him. Then it's thesummer of 2009.\n\nBen: By the way,that's right around the time that people were starting to speculate that EUV might work. All this had been kind of an idea to this point.\n\nDavid: Interesting.[...] science projects before. Oh, cool. I didnât realize that. This is going to make what happens even more sense. The financial crisis happened in 2008.Chaos everywhere, we've talked about it a lot on this show. Surprise press conference, TSMC, Summer 2009.\n\nThey announce that Morris is returning to lead TSMC as CEO. Rick is out. Morris is coming back for the third act of his career. I don't even know what number he's wearing. It's not 45 because that was the second act. He's like Jordan. He's beyond Jordan at this point. He's coming back. He's going to be CEO again at age 78. Rick would actually have a second act himself. Do you know what Rick is doing now?\n\nBen: No.\n\nDavid: Rick is CEO of MediaTek [...] of UMC. He's doing fine. Rick's doing great, but Morris comes back. Why does Morris come back?\n\nBen: But this is heralded as kind of a botched transition.\n\nDavid: Yeah. There's a lot of stuff going on.\n\nBen: From Morris toRick, people viewed it as like, you didn't really do a great job bringing in the next CEO of the company,\n\nDavid: Maybe. I don't know enough to say. I think maybe, but also, there's a lot going on at this moment in time. The financial crisis, that's a crisis that's affectingeverybody. That's one thing. But the other thing, in the press release, there'sa quote from Morris and he says, one, \"This move will not affect TSMC's fighting spirit and is likely to spur greater intensity.\" But two, he says that he sees \"golden opportunities ahead.\" What are these golden opportunitiesthat he's referring to? It's 2009âmobile, the smartphone.\n\nBen: 2007 in July, the iPhone came out, 2008, the iPhone 3G came out with the App Store for the first time, the SDK, and all these developers building for it, but of course...\n\nDavid: An Android came out in 2008.\n\nBen: Yup. Apple had to this point, while building this operating system, the scaled down version of OS10, it's Unix, but they weren't designing their own chips. They just used anoff-the-shelf Samsung chip. They got it right by saying like, hey, we got to use ARM in these things because you need a really low power device. They'vedone actual God's work and magic to be able to bring a PC x86 operating systemand created a sub-operating system from it.\n\nDavid: Computer it onyour hand.\n\nBen: Totally, thatruns on ARMâa miracle. But of course, it's an off-the-shelf Samsung processor.\n\nDavid: Totally. Eventhat's great for TSMC. Intel's not making that. Okay, so that's one. We'regoing to talk more about that in a sec.\n\nBen: We should say,Samsung also fabbed it because Samsung is both chip designer and amanufacturer.\n\nDavid: But the pointis (on mobile) the previous whole paradigm of computing, selling, and everything was PC. It was like stuff plugged into a wall. It was Intel. It wasx86. Yeah, TSMC could now access some of that because AMD went fabless, but come on. Now, all of the leading companies that are going to make silicon for design are ARM companiesâQualcomm, Broadcom, MediaTek, and Apple.\n\nBen: Who all are fabless.\n\nDavid: All arefabless. That's a big opportunity, and guess who knows all of those peopleâMorris.\n\nBen: We should say,2009 was an interesting tipping point because if you'll remember back to the2007 introduction to the iPhone, Steve Jobs has a slide where he says their hope, their goal is to get 1% of the existing smartphone market. Apple had no notion. Google had no notion of how big smartphones were about to become.\n\nIn 2009, I think the iPhone 4 came out. We're starting to see a ton of different OEMs making Android phones. You're moving into this era where everyone's looking at each other going, oh, this might actually be the next computing paradigm.\n\nDavid: Yeah. It was half of the next computing paradigm. Remember, this is when I started in VC.There were two waves that everybody was talking about.\n\nBen: Mobile and social?\n\nDavid: Mobile and thenon the consumer side, everything's shifting to mobile. That was what happened.\n\nBen: Bring your own device?\n\nDavid: Sort of, you're on the right track. What happened in the enterprise? The cloud.\n\nBen: The cloud.\n\nDavid: So you gotmobile and you got cloud. It's so simplistic, but those are the two things that drove trillions of dollars in market cap over the next decade. What's the cloud? First, the cloud is good for Intel, x86, you're putting CPUs in thecloud. Amazon's buying lots of...\n\nBen: The cloud is the best thing that ever happened for Intel.\n\nDavid: Totally.\n\nBen: That is an incredible server architecture.\n\nDavid: It was the best thing that ever happened to Intel. But as the cloud progressed and computing workloads progressed, the CPU became a lot less important. AI started becominga thing. CPU, maybe you need some of that. Maybe you'll use Intel, maybe you'lluse ARM, whatever. What really matters...\n\nBen: The majority of cloud workloads are still on CPUs today.\n\nDavid: Okay, fine,fine.\n\nBen: But you're right,the future looking.\n\nDavid: Why is Nvidia now a $300â$400billion market cap company? It's not because of the PlayStation.\n\nBen: It's bigger than Intel, right? Nvidia is 2X Intel's market cap, something like that.\n\nDavid: It's the cloud.\n\nBen: The notion ofc hips that are really good at parallelized processingâwhich is GPUs, and matrix multiplication effectivelyâvector math, versus the CPUâwhich are sort of these general-purpose workhorses built for the operating system that runs on your computer, supergood for serial. Of course, there are 64 cores on a CPU now, so they're good at parallelization too. But all this stuff, especially machine learning, is GPUs.\n\nDavid: It's GPUs and specialized like the Tesla Dojo stuff, that's not x86.\n\nBen: Yeah. The other thing that foundries enabled, the fabless era enabled is the custom chip.Everybody's building custom chips for all sorts of things.\n\nDavid: Yup. These two big golden opportunities are coming online and Morris is like, I got this.\n\nBen: When we should say we should clarify too, I think Tesla uses Samsung.\n\nDavid: Interesting. I didn't know that.\n\nBen: Not TSMC, or atleast for part of it. I think they actually even fab their chips in Austin in the US.\n\nDavid: Really?\n\nBen: Yeah.\n\nDavid: I can imagine that's going to last.\n\nBen: This is like the beginning of what everyone's sort of hoping for in the US. This is a return to American manufacturing of chips.\n\nDavid: They're going to have to go to TSMC though in the next generation because you want a3-nanometer.\n\nBen: It depends. It depends on what the workloads are and if you need it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, I guess so. It depends on what you need. Anyway, the point is, Intel's dominance isover. The index on all that's going to take over is TSMC and Morris riding back in. He comes in. He gets these deals done. The Apple deal, 2012, Morris Chang,78, 80 years old.\n\nBen: I think the Apple rep on that was Jeff Williams, the classic Tim Cook's Tim Cook.\n\nDavid: That's right.\n\nBen: I think there was something where it was even like, one went over to the other's house for dinner or something. It was like a living room conversation to ink the deal for, hey,we bought this companyâP.A. Semi. We've been designing our own chip architecture in-house. Weâre going to launch (I think it was) the A4 was the first one.\n\nDavid: Yeah, I think that was the first one.\n\nBen: It was Apple basically saying, we think a lot of people are going to buy a lot of iPhones int he future, and we are competing head-to-head with Samsung because they're a company that is not clear on strategy. They have a consumer angle here with the Galaxy phones. They think they're also kind of a foundry, which we...\n\nDavid: And Jobs hated Samsung famously. What did he call them? He called them some derogatory terms.\n\nBen: There's been a few interesting things. There was Steve Jobs saying he was going to wage a thermonuclear war.\n\nDavid: That was on Google.\n\nBen: I think that wasGoogle.\n\nDavid: But he had somelike, oh, Samsung, they're just [...], something that really put them in...\n\nBen: It was about the lawsuits. It was like when they kept stealing Apple's designs. This is late rbut Tim Cook read the quote on stage about it being a toxic hell stew.\n\nDavid: It doesn't get any better than that.\n\nBen: No. But Bloomberg reported that it was a really big risk for both companies, both Apple and TSMC.Apple was relying on a company that was then seen as an also-ran. The quote is,I think this is actually Jeff Williams, \"If we were to bet heavily on TSMC, there would be no backup plan.\" For TSMC, it meant an initial investment of $9 billion dollarsâfabs are expensive to buildâand devoting 6000employees to building a dedicated plant for Apple in just 11 months. It took several years before it even began producing the chips. That was in 2010 andthen I think 2012 was the launch of the A4 designed by Apple, built on the P.A.Semi acquisition, and of course fabbed by TSMC.\n\nDavid: I think it wasn't until the iPhone 6, which was 2014, 2013 something like that.\n\nBen: That they were solely TSMC?\n\nDavid: I think so.That was like a huge hit product. Because remember, the 6 was when they firsti ncreased the screen size. Those things flew off the shelves.\n\nBen: I'm pretty sure some iPhones had Samsung fabbed A4s and A5s in them, and some had TSMC fabbedones.\n\nDavid: All iPhones were huge winners, but the 6 was a mega, mega winner. I think that was all TSMC.\n\nBen: $9 billion of manufacturing capacity just for a deal with one company, it paid off.\n\nDavid: That was a betafarm deal and something only Morris could do.\n\nBen: Totally. It really speaks to founder gravitas.\n\nDavid: Yeah. Even i fhe had no equity as a founder, no equity that he didn't buy. After getting that deal done in 2013, Morris stepped down as CEO again, but he stays on as chairman. Then finally, once it all plays out and TSMC is on top, in June of2018, Morris retires presumably for real.\n\nBen: He even stepped down from the chairman role this time.\n\nDavid: Fully retires from chairman at age 86. Oh my God, wow. That was 2018. Let's talk about now.So 2020, TSMC (we alluded to this) operating profit of $20 billion on $48billion of revenue. They took $17 billion of the $20 billion in operatingprofit and plowed it all back into CapEx last year in 2020.\n\nBeginning of this year, January 2021, they gave guidance that they will raise CapEx from $17billion last year in 2020 to $25â$28 billion in 2021. In April of this year(2021), they raised it again to a $30 billion forecast for the year and $100billion over the next three years. That's the real shot across the bow"
