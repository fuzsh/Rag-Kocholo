        "text": "Homologous recombination (HR) is indispensable for the maintenance of genome integrity, and mutations in many HR genes are linked to a number of human diseases, especially various types of cancer (Prakash et al., 2015). HR is characterized as a major pathway to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and can occur between any two homologous sequences, such as sister chromatids, homologous chromosomes, or homologous sequences located at different genomic loci (Jasin and Rothstein, 2013). HR results in a unidirectional transfer of genetic information from one DNA molecule to another (i.e. gene conversion) and/or a reciprocal exchange of genetic information between the two DNA molecules (i.e. a crossover). A crossover involving two homologous chromosomes can cause loss of heterozygosity, which is a common occurrence in cancer, while a crossover involving homologous sequences located at different genomic loci will result in chromosomal rearrangements, such as deletions, inversions, and translocations, which have been linked to a variety of human diseases (Kong et al., 2011). Thus, in mitotic cells, HR is biased towards noncrossovers, and HR involving identical sister chromatids, referred to as sister chromatid recombination (SCR), is preferred (Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992; Nassif et al., 1994; Johnson and Jasin, 2000; Virgin et al., 2001; Stark and Jasin, 2003), in part because a crossover during SCR should not lead to a change in DNA sequence.\n\nHowever, studying SCR has been difficult, precisely because it does not normally result in a change in DNA sequence. Nevertheless, an SCR event that leads to a crossover, referred to as a sister chromatid exchange (SCE), can be detected. The mechanistic details of SCE and HR have been best studied using genetic assays in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Symington et al., 2014), though these assays are limited in several ways. First, perfect, or ‘equal’, chromosomal SCE events cannot be detected genetically, so most SCE assays measure ‘unequal’ SCE events, requiring recombination between misaligned sister chromatids. However, using a plasmid-based assay that creates a DSB on one of the two sister plasmids after DNA replication, equal SCE was found to occur much more frequently than unequal SCE (González-Barrera et al., 2003). Second, an often-used approach for detecting unequal SCE involves using two overlapping segments of a reporter gene in a tail-to-head configuration (Fasullo and Davis, 1987). The generation of a full-length reporter gene can result from an unequal SCE event, but it can also result from a long-tract gene conversion event, which does not involve a crossover. These two outcomes can be distinguished by analysis of sectored colonies (Kadyk and Hartwell, 1992), but this additional analysis is often not performed. Third, these assays measure recombination at a single genetic locus by introducing genetic markers at the locus. Introduction of such ‘reporter cassettes’ may disrupt the native chromatin environment, which could affect HR at the locus. Assaying recombination only at a single locus also ignores the rest of the genome. Some proteins important for HR may only affect specific regions of the genome, so these assays would not be useful to elucidate their functions. Lastly, most genetic assays rely on the outgrowth of a recombined cell. Thus, recombination events that lead to a reduction in cell proliferation capacity will be underrepresented, or left uncharacterized.\n\nTo alleviate these limitations, we previously developed a DNA template strand sequencing technique, called Strand-seq, which is capable of detecting SCE events genome-wide in single cells (Falconer et al., 2012). In Strand-seq, cells are allowed to divide once in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a synthetic analogue of thymidine. BrdU gets incorporated into the newly synthesized DNA strands. Single daughter cells are isolated and the nascent DNA strands are selectively degraded to isolate parental template strands for the construction of directional sequencing libraries. Multiple single-cell libraries containing unique index sequences are pooled and sequenced on an Illumina platform. Aligned reads are binned into non-overlapping segments and plotted as coloured horizontal lines along an ideogram of each chromosome. An SCE is revealed by a switch in reads mapping to the Watson strand to reads mapping to the Crick strand, or vice versa (Figure 1A). Strand-seq was originally developed for use with mammalian cells. However, since most mammalian cells are diploid, it is not easy to differentiate between an SCE from an interhomolog recombination event. Yeast, on the other hand, can be studied in both haploid and diploid states, and the molecular details of HR are best known from studies in yeast. Thus, we have adapted the Strand-seq approach to work with yeast cells. We observe that 23% of wild-type cells have at least one SCE—the first time spontaneous SCEs have been measured and mapped genome-wide in yeast. Interestingly, our findings suggest that most spontaneous SCE events are not due to the repair of DSBs.\n\nIn this study, we have used Strand-seq to measure SCE genome-wide in individual yeast cells. We provide evidence that the majority of spontaneous SCE events in wild-type cells are not the result of DSB repair. Non-DSB lesions have also been invoked to explain the synthetic lethality of mus81∆ sgs1∆ and sgs1∆ srs2∆ mutants (Fabre et al., 2002) and the proficiency of rad52 class C mutants for spontaneous inter- and intrachromosomal heteroallelic HR (Lettier et al., 2006). While the strand annealing activity of Rad52 is important for spontaneous SCE, it is not in the other noted instances of spontaneous HR, indicating that there must be at least two types of endogenous non-DSB lesions processed by HR. These lesions could be single-stranded nicks or gaps, as proposed in many of the original models for HR (Holliday, 1964; Meselson and Radding, 1975; Radding, 1982), or other type of structures interfering with strand-specific replication (Figure 5A and B). Indeed, it is well known that single-stranded gaps can initiate recombination in Escherichia coli (Persky and Lovett, 2008) and that fork collapse at the polar replication fork barrier RTS1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe induces HR-dependent replication restart from a single-stranded gap (Lambert et al., 2010).\n\nFigure 5\n\nThe importance of strand annealing for spontaneous SCE is reminiscent of recombination involving inverted repeats, which requires Rad52 but is only modestly reduced by deletion of RAD51 (Rattray and Symington, 1994). Rad59, which augments the strand annealing function of Rad52 (Petukhova et al., 1999; Davis and Symington, 2001; Wu et al., 2006), is required for spontaneous recombination of inverted repeats in the absence of Rad51 (Bai and Symington, 1996). It has been proposed that these events occur by template switching during DNA replication in a manner involving strand annealing (Mott and Symington, 2011). Poly-ubiquitylation of PCNA by the Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme complex promotes repair through the error-free post-replication repair pathway, which is thought to involve template switching (Xu et al., 2015). Rad5 and Rad18 were found to have only a minor role in inverted-repeat recombination (Mott and Symington, 2011), and the rates of spontaneous SCE in mms2∆, ubc13∆, and rad5∆ mutants are similar to wild type, as measured by an unequal SCE assay (Fasullo and Sun, 2017). However, template switching has been proposed to occur differently depending on whether the DNA lesion is on the leading strand template or the lagging strand template, with lesion bypass on the leading strand utilizing Rad5 while lesion bypass on the lagging strand mediated by Rad52 (Gangavarapu et al., 2007). Aside from the rDNA locus, we have so far been unable to map spontaneous SCE events to specific genomic features so further work will be needed to determine whether inverted repeats replicated by the lagging strand machinery are a source of spontaneous SCE (Figure 5C).\n\nWe were able to map multiple spontaneous SCE events to the rDNA locus because of its large size (approximately 10% of the genome). Due to its repetitive nature, the rDNA locus has been an excellent substrate for studying HR. Recombination within the locus is important to maintain repeat homogeneity and copy number homeostasis (Kobayashi, 2011). Consistent with the importance of HR at the rDNA locus, we observe that SCE is threefold higher at the rDNA locus compared to the rest of the genome (Figure 3B). Nevertheless, an SCE event occurs at the rDNA locus in only 6.4% (14 out of 218) of wild-type cells (Table 1). Considering that it has been estimated that a single cell has on average 3.6 Holliday junctions and one DSB within the rDNA array per cell cycle (Zou and Rothstein, 1997; Sasaki and Kobayashi, 2017), our data indicate that the vast majority of HR events at the rDNA locus do not result in crossovers, in agreement with previous work showing that HR at the rDNA locus is largely rearrangement-free (Zou and Rothstein, 1997).\n\nIn addition to SCE, Strand-seq could in theory be used to detect break-induced replication (BIR) events involving sister chromatids. BIR occurs when one end of a DSB invades an intact homologous DNA sequence to generate a replication fork that can potentially proceed to the end of the chromosome. Unlike canonical DNA replication, which is semi-conservative, BIR occurs by conservative DNA synthesis (Donnianni and Symington, 2013; Saini et al., 2013). With Strand-seq, a chromosomal region synthesized by BIR could either have no Watson or Crick reads (i.e. both Watson and Crick strands are newly synthesized) or both Watson and Crick reads (i.e. both Watson and Crick strands consist of the original parental template strands). Application of Strand-seq in yeast will be particularly advantageous to address questions about various types of DNA lesions and replication stress-inducing barriers at specific locations in the genome. These and other potential applications of Strand-seq offer intriguing new possibilities to study HR, complimenting more traditional assays to yield a better picture of HR activity genome-wide at the level of single cells."
