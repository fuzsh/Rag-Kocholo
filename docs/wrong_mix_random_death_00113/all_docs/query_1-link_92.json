In particular, monolayer CrI3 was found to be ferromagnet. Other vdW transition metal halides were later found to have different magnetic properties. How many vdW magnetic materials exist in nature? What are their properties? How do these properties change with the number of layers?\n\nContinue reading… Trevor Rhone (RPI) – Pls note the special time and location\n\nNancy Forde (Simon Fraser University) Thu. April 25th, 2024\n\n4:00 pm-5:00 pm\n\nSingle-molecule mechanical studies of unstable protein building blocks\n\nThe most abundant protein on earth, collagen, is the material building block that forms the basis of our connective tissues and the extracellular matrix that surrounds our cells. It performs important structural and mechanical roles, holding our bodies together and helping our tissues to withstand a wide variety of forces. Surprisingly, collagen proteins are structurally unstable at body temperature.\n\nIn this talk, which will be aimed at a very general Physics audience, I will introduce some of the fascinating physical properties of the unique triple-helix structure of collagen and will describe how we are using the techniques of atomic force microscopy and centrifuge force microscopy to study these properties,\n\nContinue reading… Nancy Forde (Simon Fraser University)\n\nLatham Boyle (University of Edinburgh) Tue.

A PT is a remarkable, intrinsically non-periodic way of tiling the plane whose many beautiful and unexpected properties have fascinated physicists, mathematicians, and geometry lovers of all sorts, ever since its discovery in the 1970s. A QECC is a fundamental way of protecting quantum information from noise, by encoding the information with a sophisticated type of redundancy. Such codes play an increasingly important role in physics: in quantum computing (where they protect the delicate quantum state of the computer);\n\nContinue reading… Latham Boyle (University of Edinburgh)\n\nMaxim Dzero (Kent State) Mon.

In my talk I will first provide an overview of the state-of-the-art experimental techniques. I will proceed with the overview of the theoretical results on the problem of far-from-equilibrium superconductivity which pre-dated the recent experiments. Then I plan to discuss how experimental discoveries motivated the theorists to revisit now classical problems which remained unresolved for many years.\n\nContinue reading… Maxim Dzero (Kent State)\n\nVictor Miralles (U Manchester) Tue. April 16th, 2024\n\n11:30 am-12:30 pm\n\nIntroduction to HEPfit and its potential to constrain the SMEFT\n\nAbstract: New physics extensions usually include many parameters that can be tuned to be compatible with current data. In many cases, instead of ruling out the models, we are just able to find constraints on their parameters. Finding these constraints, including as much information as possible, is usually challenging due to the huge amount of measurements available. In this seminar, we will show how the package HEPfit can be used to perform these global fits. As a relevant example, we will demonstrate how HEPfit can be used to constrain ‘model agnostic’\n\nContinue reading… Victor Miralles (U Manchester)\n\nAlp Sehirlioglu (MSE CWRU) Mon.

The primary focus in repurposing LCO lies in catalysis, particularly in decomposing environmental pollutants. Previous attempts in utilizing LCO for photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and thermocatalysis have shown promising results. LCO’s layered structure facilitates delithiation and intercalation, crucial processes in chemical exfoliation. This exfoliation process involves protonation and intercalation,\n\nContinue reading… Alp Sehirlioglu (MSE CWRU)\n\nMichael J. Ramsey-Musolf (U. Mass Amherst/T. D.

In this talk, I discuss the theoretical challenges and advances in the interpretation of experimental tests of fundamental symmetries performed with these strongly interacting systems. This theoretical work has enabled us to exploit such tests to achieve a deeper understanding of the dynamics of Quantum Chromodynamics in the non-perturbative regime and to gain a powerful new tool in the hunt for possible physics beyond the Standard Model.\n\nHost: Pavel Fileviez\n\nContinue reading… Michael J.

This familiar process is a confounding problem in many-body\n\nphysics due to the long-range, directional interactions between sinking particles. After\n\ndiscussing some known facts and known puzzles in the field, I will present results that\n\nshow qualitatively new behaviour when the particles have non-trivial shape and\n\norientational degrees of freedom, as do snowflakes, plankton, crystals, and other natural\n\nsediment.

April 3rd, 2024\n\n1:30 pm-2:30 pm\n\nAstrophysical Tau Neutrinos\n\nNeutrinos are very reticent fundamental particles. Tau neutrinos make electron and muon neutrinos look\n\npositively gregarious. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole has sensitivity to all three active neutrino\n\nflavors over an energy scale spanning six orders of magnitude. We report on the first high-significance measurement of\n\nthe most energetic tau neutrino candidates ever observed.\n\nHost: Benjamin Monreal\n\nContinue reading… Doug Cowen (Penn State)\n\nSamuel Patrone (Caltech) Tue.

In my talk, I will review the theoretical machinery that allows us to connect the primordial curvature fluctuations to the large-scale structures of the Universe, and I will present the results of 2306.08025. In this work, we performed the one-loop renormalization of the composite operator δρ², up to third order in gravitational evolution and in the presence of local non-gaussianities, using three distinct regularization schemes. I’ll show how this choice impacts the values of the counterterms,\n\nContinue reading… Samuel Patrone (Caltech)\n\nSamuel Schwab (Booz Allen Hamilton) Mon.

This first part is a historical narrative of the journey while the remaining two are technical overviews of some of the most recent work in building and characterizing the necessary infrastructure for scaling up superconducting quantum systems and building a heterogeneous quantum network. Specifically these will be focused on using integrated photonic photodiodes as cryogenic microwave sources, and our efforts in testing acousto-optic transducers.\n\nContinue reading… Samuel Schwab (Booz Allen Hamilton)\n\nJiadong Zang (U of New Hampshire) Mon.

A new type of spin interaction therein, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, stimulates the formation of many novel topological spin textures. One important example is the emergence of magnetic skyrmion, whose nontrivial topology enables unique dynamical property and thermal stability and gives rise to promising applications in future\n\nspintronic devices. Other than neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy, the topological Hall is an important identification of skyrmions.\n\nContinue reading… Jiadong Zang (U of New Hampshire)\n\nMichael Davidson (University of California, San Diego) Thu. March 21st, 2024\n\n4:00 pm-5:00 pm\n\nOptimizing Continental Scale Renewable Energy Systems\n\nWidespread use of renewable electricity sources is necessary to address climate change, but\n\ntheir intermittency, geospatial variability, and large land footprints create unique challenges for\n\noptimizing deployment while respecting power flow and engineering constraints. In this talk, I\n\nwill review approaches to plan continental scale systems that are renewables dominant. I will\n\ndescribe the key computational trade-offs and optimization methods that are used to plan land\n\nuse. Cost-effective deployment of high-penetration renewable energy systems depends not\n\nonly on technological and economic considerations but also on market institutions and policy\n\ncoordination.\n\nContinue reading… Michael Davidson (University of California, San Diego)\n\nAmy Connolly (OSU) Tue. March 19th, 2024\n\n11:30 am-12:30 pm\n\nUltra high energy neutrino detection in Antarctic ice: an evolving story\n\nHigh energy astrophysics is now being probed using four different energetic messengers: (charged) cosmic rays, gamma rays, gravitational waves, and neutrinos. The past decade and a half has been marked by discoveries of gravitational waves and neutrinos up to O(10^16 eV). Neutrinos in the ultra-high energy (UHE) regime (above 10^18 eV) are an important missing piece of the multi-messenger picture of the high energy universe, and will also be important probes of new physics. Experiments using radio techniques in Antarctic ice are the most promising for the discovery of UHE neutrinos.\n\nContinue reading… Amy Connolly (OSU)\n\nHongping Zhao (OSU) Mon.

However, ATs also exhibit many unusual features including the multifractal scaling of the critical wave functions. Conventional critical points possess conformal invariance which constrain their properties to the extent that they can be obtained exactly in two dimensions and to very high precision in three dimensions.\n\nContinue reading… Ilya Gruzberg (OSU)\n\nMichael Hinczewski (CWRU Physics) Thu. February 22nd, 2024\n\n4:00 pm-5:00 pm\n\nThe price of evolution: how thermodynamics shapes gene regulation\n\nMany of the physical processes in a cell consume energy, but we are only beginning to understand how these costs have influenced the course of evolution. Biology is strewn with counter-intuitively complex mechanisms whose evolutionary predecessors must have consumed significant energy resources without any clear fitness benefit. So how do such mechanisms evolve in the first place, and how strong is the guiding hand of thermodynamic optimization? My talk explores these issues through one specific example: gene regulation in higher organisms (including humans) by microRNAs. These small RNA molecules (only 22 nucleotides long) are versatile tools for controlling the expression of genes into proteins,\n\nContinue reading… Michael Hinczewski (CWRU Physics)\n\nDavid Moore (Yale) Tue. February 20th, 2024\n\n11:30 am-12:30 pm\n\nMechanical sensors for dark matter and neutrinos\n\nThe development of optomechanical systems has revolutionized the detection of tiny forces over the past few decades. As such technologies reach (and surpass) quantum measurement limits, they can enable new searches for weakly coupled phenomena, including dark matter, gravitational waves, “fifth’’ forces, and sterile neutrinos. As a demonstration of these techniques, I will describe an initial search for dark matter using an optically levitated nanogram mass sensor, which can exceed the sensitivity of even large underground detectors for certain classes of dark matter candidates in a few days of exposure.\n\nContinue reading… David Moore (Yale)\n\nSwagata Acharya (National Renewable Energy Lab) Mon.

February 13th, 2024\n\n11:30 am-12:30 pm\n\nMulti-field Wave Dark Matter\n\nIn this talk I will highlight some general aspects of an extension to the classic Ultra Light Dark Matter (ULDM) paradigm with a second light scalar particle. As experimental data is beginning to put more stringent constraints on single field ULDM, it is an interesting to explore what happens when more light particles are added to the picture. Having more light degrees of freedom present in our Universe might even be easier to reconcile with many UV completions of the Standard Model, where many scalars seem to be the norm and not the exception.\n\nContinue reading… Fabio van Dissel, IFAE (Barcelona)\n\nKofi Deh (Howard University) Mon. February 12th, 2024\n\n12:45 pm-1:45 pm\n\nClinical metabolic magnetic resonance imaging\n\nKofi Deh, Medical Physics at Howard University\n\nZoom recording\n\nTalk Abstract: Spin hyperpolarization can increase the signal-to-noise ratio in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by a factor of 10,000, making it possible to perform metabolic imaging for early cancer detection. In this talk, we will look at the motivation for metabolic imaging, the physics of hyperpolarization and the technical considerations required for MRI of hyperpolarized X-nuclei. We will also look at practical considerations for translating this technology into the clinic. Finally, we will briefly examine other candidates for MR metabolic imaging that have less complexity than hyperpolarized MRI.\n\nContinue reading… Kofi Deh (Howard University)\n\nBrian Welch (NASA / University of Maryland) Thu. February 8th, 2024\n\n4:00 pm-5:00 pm\n\nDissecting Galaxies in the Distant Universe with JWST and Gravitational Lensing\n\nThe launch of JWST in December 2021 opened a powerful new eye onto the distant universe. The telescope’s high spatial resolution, large collecting area, and infrared wavelength coverage have enabled detailed studies of distant galaxies that were untenable with other instruments. Combining this powerful tool with strong gravitational lensing has been particularly exciting. Gravitational lensing magnifies distant galaxies, enabling detection of intrinsically smaller, fainter features than is possible in blank fields. In this talk, I will review some recent lensed galaxy results from JWST, and discuss how these new observations are shaping our understanding of the physics that govern galaxy evolution on small scales.\n\nContinue reading… Brian Welch (NASA / University of Maryland)\n\nElias Most (Caltech) Tue. February 6th, 2024\n\n11:30 am-12:30 pm\n\nNeutron Star Mergers: From gravity to nuclear and plasma astrophysics\n\nAnnouncing the dawn of a new era of multi-messenger astrophysics, the gravitational wave event GW170817 – involving the collision of two neutron stars – was detected in 2017. In addition to the gravitational wave signal, it was accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts providing new windows into the different physics probed by the system. Since then, several gravitational wave events involving neutron stars have been discovered, with more expected over the next years.\n\nIn order to understand and interpret the physics of these events, it is necessary to model the intricate dynamics of such systems before,\n\nContinue reading… Elias Most (Caltech)\n\nAlison Patteson (Syracuse University) Thu.

My group explores how physical features of the cell’s environment impacts cell movement in both the context of bacterial biofilms and mammalian cells that move through changes in the cytoskeletal network. In this talk, I will present work on how collective groups of cells move and remodel their environment and how we can measure those collective forces even in complex environments, such as the extracellular matrix of mammalian tissues.\n\nContinue reading… Alison Patteson (Syracuse University)\n\nRoshan Abraham (UC Irvine) Tue.

In the HL-LHC era, we expect a significant number of neutrinos in the forward direction, opening the way for precision studies using collider neutrinos at the proposed Forward Physics Facility (FPF). In this talk, I will present some phenomenological studies in this direction. i) The electromagnetic properties of neutrinos (magnetic moments, milli-charge, charge radius) have attracted significant interest recently.\n\nContinue reading… Roshan Abraham (UC Irvine)\n\nThe 2023 Nobel Prizes Thu.

To\n\ndate, investigation of hybrid magnonic effects has been largely centered on the ferromagnetic\n\nresonance and long wavelength modes. It remains challenging to incorporate short-wavelength\n\n(deep mesoscale) modes for magnon hybridization, in which many fundamental questions, such\n\nas the wavenumber-dependent coherent phenomena, remain unanswered.

The properties of free streaming CMB photons from the surface of last scattering are altered by their interaction with matter in the Universe carrying crucial information about the the epoch of reionisation and also the origin, growth, and evolution of structures. In this talk, I will discuss the potential of a couple of these secondary anisotropies, namely the kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effects, to shed light into some of the long-standing cosmological quests like the physics of reionisation and the properties of dark energy.\n\nContinue reading… Srini Raghunathan (UIUC)\n\nPOSTPONED – Daniel Hart (NASA Glenn) Mon.

Despite progress in inflationary model-building and CMB observations, the end of inflation and the exact mechanism through which energy is transferred from the inflationary to the SM and Dark Matter sectors remains largely uncharted. This era is called reheating and is necessary to provide the thermal radiation-dominated universe required for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Depending on the underlying particle physics model, reheating can lead to the population of hidden sectors and the creation of remnant particles or topological defects. It can thus be used to constrain theories of high-energy physics,\n\nContinue reading… Evangelos Sfakianakis (CWRU)\n\nJosh Klein (U Penn) Tue.

The resulting randomness affects biological outcomes at multiple scales, from the probability that a single protein molecule successfully finds its folded state to the evolutionary trajectory of a population of cells. Understanding how the distribution of these outcomes changes over time is often difficult, and achieving control over this distribution via external interventions is an even more complex challenge.

The additional quadratic terms are multiplied by dimensionless coefficients that are related to the masses of the extra gravitational degrees of freedom and to the interaction couplings. The aim of this talk is to analyse the limit of the theory in which the Weyl-squared coefficient tends to infinity. Remarkably, the result of this limit turns out to be sensitive to the presence of a cosmological constant: when the latter is zero we have a massless limit for the spin-2 ghost,\n\nContinue reading… Luca Buoninfante (Nordita in Sweden)\n\nRandy Fishman (Oak Ridge) Mon.

Both of these problems are evidence that the gravitational sector of the Standard Model is incomplete at macroscopic distance scales. Indeed when General Relativity is treated as a low energy Effective Field Theory, it can be shown that it necessarily receives infrared relevant corrections from the fluctuations of massless or light quantum fields.

In flat space, this is unambiguously dictated by the Minkowski light cones, but the situation is more subtle with dynamical gravity.

When time reversal symmetry is broken, the Dirac surface states are gapped and interesting features are expected such as quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, topological magnetoelectric effect, and axion physics. In particular, when ferromagnetic order is formed within topological insulators (i.e., magnetic topological insulators) in zero magnetic field, the QAH effect can be realized for the chemical potential tuned within the surface gap such that the Hall conductance is quantized and chiral charge currents flow around the edges without dissipation.\n\nContinue reading… Kyungwha Park (Virginia Tech)\n\nJulia Gehrlein (CERN – MPPL 2023 Winner) Thu.

In 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs, it is often possible to do this exactly. We consider the propagator of free scalar fields in AdS geometries with a conical defect or a BTZ black hole, dual on the boundary to a heavy-light 4-point function.

Interestingly we do not directly observe the inflationary epoch, but instead infer its dynamics from correlations residing on the late time boundary of the inflationary spacetime where the universe reheats. This motivates us to ask whether we can understand things directly on this asymptotic boundary, without making explicit reference to bulk time evolution.

In particular, I will present EFTs enjoying biform symmetries, which are a slight variation of higher-form symmetries, and are defined by the presence of a conserved current that has the symmetries of a Young tableau with two columns of equal length. When these theories also have a topological biform current, its conservation law is anomalous, and this is sufficient to fix the current-current correlation function and infer the presence of a massless mode in the spectrum.\n\nContinue reading… Greg Mathys (Cornell)\n\nRosario Porras-Aguilar (UNC Charlotte) Mon.

Studying conformal field theories would help us to understand those universal characteristics that relate several seemingly unrelated physical systems. Also from a renormalization group perspective, studying the space of conformal field theories amounts to studying the space of all well-defined (or UV complete) quantum field theories.\n\nContinue reading… Carlos Cardona (CWRU)\n\nSantosh Kumar (Agnostiq) Mon.

While traditional algorithms for time series anomaly detection (TAD) have proven to be effective, the advent of newly accessible quantum processing units (QPUs) presents an opportunity to explore a quantum approach to TAD. This talk will introduce a new TAD algorithm called Quantum Variational Rewinding (QVR)[1,2,3], where we map and learn time series processes by embedding classical data into quantum states and rewinding them to their learnt initial state –\n\nContinue reading… Santosh Kumar (Agnostiq)\n\nJohanna Nagy (Washington University, St Louis) Thu.

Many-body interactions in complex quantum materials are an ideal platform because the interactions cause fascinating phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, exotic magnetic systems, correlated topological materials, and many others. In addition, four fundamental degrees of freedom, lattice, charge, orbital, and spin, provide strong tunability on the exotic properties, which allow enhancing our understanding of interacting quantum objects.\n\nContinue reading… Na Hyun Jo (U Michigan)\n\nPaul Steinhardt (Princeton) Thu.

A dark SU(2)D gauge sector with a dark scalar doublet playing the role of inflaton is considered along with several doublet and singlet fermions sufficient to realise multiple inflection points in the inflaton potential. While some of these doublet fermions play the role of dark matter, the rest of the fermions can play non-trivial role in generating light neutrino masses via seesaw mechanism while also leading to non-zero lepton asymmetry from out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy fermions.\n\nContinue reading… Arnab Dasgupta (PITT PACC – Univ. of Pittsburgh)\n\nMatthew Willard (MSE, CWRU) Mon.

The combination of phase selection and microstructure refinement are responsible for the remarkable easy in switching. In such materials, the magnetic domain walls become exceedingly wide primarily due to a microstructure-induced reduction in magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this seminar, the increase in magnetic domain wall width and its estimated size considering the random anisotropy model will be presented.\n\nContinue reading… Matthew Willard (MSE, CWRU)\n\nShulei Zhang (CWRU) Thu.

In this talk, I study the physics of the cosmological phonon collider: I uncover the imprints of heavy particles during inflation on the correlators of the Goldstone boson of the broken time diffeomorphism during inflation. I show that the reduced speed of sound for the Goldstone allows new types of footprints of heavy fields to emerge. In particular, I will demonstrate that the exchange of supersonic, massive fields that are still lighter than Hubble divided by the speed of sound induces characteristic resonances in the soft limit of the bispectrum.\n\nContinue reading… Sadra Jazayeri (Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris)\n\nBinghai Yan (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel) Mon.

In chemistry and biochemistry, however, it is the geometric asymmetry of non-superposable left or right-handed mirror images that constitutes chirality. While seemingly unrelated characters in different fields, the chiral geometry can lead to topological electronic properties in chiral molecules or solids, as we recently discovered in theory and experiments.\n\nContinue reading… Binghai Yan (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel)\n\nThorsten Schmidt (Kent State University) Wed.

A nonrelativistic version of the conformal symmetry, also called Schrödinger symmetry, is approximately realized in various physical systems, including neutrons in nuclear physics and ultracold atoms. After going through some basic facts about nonrelativistic conformal field theory, we describe one concrete application of such a theory in the physics of nuclear reactions with several neutrons in the final state.\n\nContinue reading… Dam Son (Chicago)\n\nQiuyue Liang (U Penn) Tue.

A leading paradigm to resolve the tension is a period of early dark energy, in which a scalar field contributes a subdominant part of the energy budget of the universe at this time. This scenario faces significant fine-tuning problems which can be ameliorated by a non- trivial coupling of the scalar to the standard model neutrinos. These become non-relativistic close to the time of matter-radiation equality,\n\nContinue reading… Qiuyue Liang (U Penn)\n\nWalter Lambrecht (CWRU) Mon.

Lambrecht\n\nDepartment of Physics, Case Western Reserve University\n\nJoin Zoom\n\nAbstract.–Layered and few-layer 2D oxides have remarkable properties. In this talk I will tell you about two oxides, V2O5 and LiCoO2. In both materials the quasiparticle self-consistent GW method is found to strongly overestimate the optical band gap. This is surprising because the GW method is usually quite accurate in predicting band gaps. The question is: what is missing in GW? Is it electron-phonon effects or electron-hole effects on the screening of the screened Coulomb interaction W?\n\nContinue reading… Walter Lambrecht (CWRU)\n\nMarcell Howard (U Pittsburg) Tue.

In this work, we find a generalized fermionic CSK state by solving the extended gravitational and fermionic Hamiltonian constraints of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation exactly. We show that this new state reduces to the original Kodama state upon symmetry reduction to FRW coordinates with perturbative fermionic corrections, making contact with the Hartle-Hawking and Vilenkin wave functions of the universe in cosmology. We also find that when both torsion and fermions are non-vanishing,\n\nContinue reading… Marcell Howard (U Pittsburg)\n\n(CANCELED) Mahi R. Singh (The University of Western Ontario) Mon.

Graphene was invented theoretically by Wallace in 1947 [1] and he found that graphene is a gapless material. Later, Wallace and I found additional gapless materials, such as narrow-gap semiconductors which have direct band gaps [2].\n\nContinue reading… (CANCELED) Mahi R.

Using a template-assisted assembly technique, capillary forces drive the assembly of lithographically-fabricated nanoparticles into open or close-packed structures. The sizes and shapes of the templates control the coordination number, disorder, and location of defects such as voids in the nanoparticle assemblies.\n\nContinue reading… Yiyu Cai (U Penn)\n\nThaddeus Ladd (HRL labs) Mon.

Quantum-dot-based qubits in silicon have recently enjoyed dramatic advances in fabrication and control techniques. The “exchange-only” modality is of particular interest, as it avoids control elements that are difficult to scale such as microwave fields, photonics, or ferromagnetic gradients. In this control scheme, the entirety of quantum computation may be performed using only asynchronous,\n\nContinue reading… Thaddeus Ladd (HRL labs)\n\nJanet Conrad (MIT) Thu.

The discovery of neutrino oscillations has changed the way we think about our model of particle physics. We must now incorporate tiny neutrino masses into our theory, as well as consider the possibility of other unexpected properties. You might ask what a tiny mass particle has to do with elephants? To learn this, you need to come to the colloquium.\n\nContinue reading… Janet Conrad (MIT)\n\nJennifer Cano (Stony Brook) Mon.

To achieve this goal, we consider two different platforms: 1) twisted heterostructures in 2D and 3D; and 2) the effect of a moire superlattice potential.\n\nContinue reading… Jennifer Cano (Stony Brook)\n\nCyrus Taylor (Physics), Thomas Gray (Chemistry) and George Dubyak (Biophysics and Physiology) Thu.

Concretely, QED3 with the flavor group SU(N) flows to a free theory for small N and to a conformal one for large N, whereas the critical flavor number is suggested to be anywhere between 1 and 10 by various theoretical and computational methods. This phase space of QED3 is very appealing, as it shows analogues of chiral symmetry breaking and confinement and hence can be u"
