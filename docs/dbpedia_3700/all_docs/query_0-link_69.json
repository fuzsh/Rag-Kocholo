        "text": "Back by popular demand, this is my latest installment with the topic of one hit wonders. I continue to be amazed by the popularity of this subject matter, as it brings back nostalgic memories for many folks.\n\nOver the past 3 years, I have published one hit wonders messages from years 1968 through 1972. These articles are among my most viewed messages of all-time.\n\nWith this latest edition of musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” from 1973. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 50 years ago.\n\nI have fond memories of listening to top 40 music from 1973 as it is the year that I graduated from Glenvar High School in Roanoke County Virginia. Then in September ’73, I started my freshman year at Virginia Western Community College, located in Roanoke.\n\nDuring daylight hours, I exclusively listened to Roanoke’s legendary WROV 1240 AM. This station featured a Top 40 format and was the number 1 top-ranked radio outlet in my city.\n\nAudio aircheck of Terry Young WROV Roanoke May 1973. Courtesy WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nThe WROV DJs that I remember back in 1973 were Larry Bly, Bart Prater, Terry Young, Shane Randall and Chuck Holloway. When WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home.\n\nAudio aircheck of Larry Bly WROV Roanoke April 1973. Courtesy WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\n50,000-watt WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM (Super CFL) and WABC 770 AM New York were my top three choices for nighttime listening 50 years ago.\n\nIn Chicago, I remember WLS DJs John Records Landecker, JJ Jeffries and Fred Winton, while Larry Lujack, Bob Dearborn and Ron O’Brien were superb on Super CFL. Cousin Brucie (Morrow) and Dan Ingram were radio announcing legends at WABC New York.\n\nSome other powerful radio stations that I occasionally heard in ’73: WOWO Fort Wayne 1190 AM, CKLW Windsor, Ontario (Detroit) 800 AM and WKBW Buffalo 1520 AM.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nSingles that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are generally not considered as a second hit. Example: a 2nd song peaking at number 87 does not constitute an artist as a two-hit-wonder.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nAs a point of reference, below are the top 10 biggest records of 1973. None of these artists are one hit wonders as they all had multiple top 40 hits.\n\n1 “Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree” Tony Orlando and Dawn\n\n2 “Bad, Bad Leroy Brown” Jim Croce\n\n3 “Killing Me Softly with His Song” Roberta Flack\n\n4 “Let’s Get It On” Marvin Gaye\n\n5 “My Love” Paul McCartney & Wings\n\n6 “Why Me” Kris Kristofferson\n\n7 “Crocodile Rock” Elton John\n\n8 “Will It Go Round in Circles” Billy Preston\n\n9 “You’re So Vain” Carly Simon\n\n10 “Touch Me in the Morning” Diana Ross\n\nBefore starting my countdown with the best 1973 one hit wonders, I must clear up some Internet erroneous information that some proclaim on this topic. The band Stealers Wheel is actually a “TWO-HIT WONDER.”\n\nStealers Wheel was a Scottish rock band formed by Gerry Rafferty and Joe Egan is 1972. The group’s well-known hit “Stuck in the Middle with You” peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1973.\n\nA second hit single for Stealers Wheel was “Star.” This highly acclaimed song also charted on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching #29 in March 1974.\n\nAdditional 1973 one hit wonders. Notable outside my countdown.\n\nPlayground in My Mind—Clint Holmes\n\nWalk on the Wild Side—Lou Reed\n\nSoul Makossa—Manu Dibango\n\nLove Jones—Brighter Side of Darkness\n\nArmed and Extremely Dangerous—First Choice\n\nSmoke Gets in Your Eyes—Blue Haze\n\nIn the Midnight Hour—Cross Country\n\nBack When My Hair Was Short—Gunhill Road\n\nWithout further ado, the countdown begins with 1973 groovy one hit wonders.\n\n15.

Lawrence was also an actress/comedian, who played the character “Mama” on the Carol Burnett TV show. One of the best country pop epic story songs from the 70s.\n\n2. Wildflower—Skylark\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #9 Hot 100, 25th Biggest Song of 1973\n\nCanadian pop/rock band. Reached #1 in Canada during 1972. Since the song was not available in the US as a single, Top 40 CKLW Windsor, Ontario, which is part of the Detroit, Michigan radio market, started playing “Wildflower” as an album track.\n\nThe song quickly became a hit in Detroit and was picked up by other top 40 stations in Michigan. Capitol Records then released the Skylark single in the US and it spent 21 weeks charting on the Billboard Hot 100. Folks all across North America loved the smooth vocals by lead singer Donny Gerard on this outstanding power ballad.\n\n1. Dancing in the Moonlight—King Harvest\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #13 Hot 100, 36th Biggest Song of 1973\n\nWithout a doubt, “Dancing in the Moonlight” by King Harvest is my top selection as the best 1973 one hit wonder. It is an all-time favorite single for me.\n\nKing Harvest formed in 1970, while the band members were attending Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. “Dancing in the Moonlight” is actually a cover song, with the original recording by a band called Boffalongo.\n\nShortly after the chart success of “Dancing in the Moonlight” on the Billboard Hot 100, King Harvest’s recording label Perception Records went bankrupt. Left without a recording contact, the band membership started to fluctuate. Eventually, King Harvest called it quits in 1976.\n\nThe only top 40 hit for King Harvest is still popular here in 2023. Whenever I play this song at wedding receptions where I am hired as a DJ, folks still love to dance to this song. Without a doubt, “Dancing in the Moonlight” is my favorite and top one hit wonder for 1973.\n\nI completely understand that my listing of 1973 groovy one hit wonders was written from my point of view and is subjective. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best one hit wonders from 1973? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1973.

The time frame for these excellent remakes, ranges from 1965 through 1980.\n\nI will be featuring a countdown on what I consider to be 20 magnificent remakes of classic original songs. In most cases, the initial first version and the cover remix, are both equally-exceptional recordings.\n\nHere is my definition of a cover song: a new performance or recording by an artist other than the original composer and/or performer.\n\nThere are a couple of different types of cover songs. First are remakes that sound similar to original version. The second type of cover tunes are reinterpretations of a song that differs substantially from the original recording.\n\nMy countdown of outstanding cover songs will highlight newer recordings of well-known hits that are presented in unique, different and fresh ways, as compared to the older original productions.\n\nI must note before revealing my listing of cover tunes: this is NOT an article comparing original older versions with newer renditions. The words “better” and “best” will not be used when describing the songs that I have selected for my countdown in the cover song category.\n\nA good example of how I am proceeding with excellent cover songs is with the fantastic Dolly Parton written ballad, “I Will Always Love You.” The legendary country music singer-songwriter had her original superb version reach number one twice on the Billboard Hot Country chart, in 1974 and again in 1982.\n\nForward to 1992, Whitney Houston had one of the biggest singles of the 90s with her rendition of “I Will Always Love You.” Houston won two Grammy Awards with Dolly’s anthem and both versions of this iconic song are uniquely outstanding.\n\nBefore I start the countdown on what I consider to be sterling cover songs, I am listing ten noteworthy tunes that landed just outside of my top 20 countdown:\n\nSuperstar—The Carpenters\n\nSummer Breeze—The Isley Brothers\n\nHere Comes the Sun—Ritchie Havens\n\nStrawberry Letter 23—The Brothers Johnson\n\nDancing in the Moonlight—King Harvest\n\nSloop John B—The Beach Boys\n\nSummertime Blues—Blue Cheer\n\nHush—Deep Purple\n\nCrossroads—Cream\n\nWithout You—Nilsson\n\nWithout further ado, my countdown of fabulous cover songs begins:\n\n20. You’re No Good—Linda Ronstadt 1974\n\nOriginal version: Dee Dee Warwick in 1963\n\nLinda Ronstadt reached superstardom with her cover version of “You’re No Good.” Backing musicianship on the song is impressive. A driving bass line, superior guitar riffs and a sparse drumming pattern generates a haunting melody.\n\n19. Take Me to the River—Talking Heads 1978\n\nOriginal version: Al Green in 1974\n\nTalking Heads co-produced this version with Brian Eno. Tune has a slow tempo. Combines pop/rock and classic soul/R&B in forming an eclectic mix of gospel, punk rock and new wave sounds.\n\n18. My Back Pages—The Byrds 1967\n\nOriginal version: Bob Dylan in 1964\n\nThe Byrds provide a superb interpretation of Bob Dylan’s song.

Roll Over Beethoven—Electric Light Orchestra 1973\n\nOriginal version: Chuck Berry in 1956\n\nOpening this tune: a snippet of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony before evolving into a straight up rock tune, featuring Chuck Berry’s original music and the “Peter Gunn Theme” song in the background. This is ELO’s absolute crown jewel.\n\n16. Love Hurts—Nazareth 1974\n\nOriginal version: Everly Brothers in 1960\n\nScottish Blues rock Nazareth soared high on international charts with their power ballad “Love Hurts.” Vocalist Dan McCafferty delivers an emotional outpouring of grief and seeking compassion on this rock track.\n\n15. Got to Get You into my Life—Earth Wind & Fire\n\nOriginal version: The Beatles in 1966\n\nMaurice White’s signature vocals sets up this innovative rendition.

Blinded by the Light—Manfred Mann’s Earth Band 1976\n\nOriginal Version: Bruce Springsteen in 1973\n\nStraight up rock tune. Manfred Mann’s version includes the “Chopsticks” melody played on piano near the end of the bridge of the song. The only song written by Bruce Springsteen to ever peak at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n7. Try a Little Tenderness—Otis Redding 1966\n\nOriginal version: Ray Noble Orchestra in 1932\n\nOtis Redding’s interpretation starts slow and soulful.

Respect—Aretha Franklin\n\nOriginal version: Otis Redding in 1965\n\nOtis Redding penned this song in 1965. Two years later, Aretha Franklin went to Muscle Shoals recording studio in Alabama and re-created Redding’s composition into an anthem. “R-E-S-P-E-C-T” became Franklin’s first number 1 hit and is considered her signature song.\n\nInducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored Franklin’s version by adding it to the National Recording Registry. Rolling Stone rates Franklin’s version of “Respect” as the number 1 best single on their “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” List.\n\nAll Along the Watchtower—Jimi Hendrix\n\nOriginal version: Bob Dylan 1967\n\nJimi Hendrix comes in at #1 on my countdown of excellent cover songs. The artist took the outstanding lyrics written by Bob Dylan and created a magical musical masterpiece.\n\nUtilizing a hard rock psychedelic sound, Hendrix’s rendering creates an outstanding landscape with powerful guitar riffs. Mixing dynamic instrumentation, along with Dylan’s almost biblical lyrics, invokes a sense of foreboding urgency, dread and possible doom.\n\nThe remake received a Grammy Hall of Fame award in 2001, and was ranked 40th in Rolling Stone magazine’s “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” listing.\n\nWithout a doubt, “All Along the Watchtower” by Jimi Hendrix is my top outstanding cover song from the golden age of top 40 radio.\n\nI completely understand that my listing of excellent cover songs was written from my point of view and is subjective. If you were creating a similar register of great cover tunes, your tabulation may be totally different.\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique.

I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 55 years ago.\n\nAudio aircheck above: Fred King WROV Roanoke June 1968. WROV Top 40 survey below from June 10, 1968. Courtesy of the WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nI have fond memories listening to top 40 radio from my home in Roanoke, Virginia during 1968. My go to station was legendary WROV 1240 AM, which was the top-rated radio outlet in my city.\n\nThe WROV DJs that I remember back in 1968 were Jack Fisher, Fred Frelantz, Bart Prater, Fred King, Ron Phelps and Phil Beckman. During daylight hours, I exclusively listened to WROV.\n\nWhen WROV reduced power at sundown, I would listen to top 40 AM radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. 50,000-watt WLS 890 AM Chicago and WABC 770 AM New York were my top two choices for nighttime listening.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart.

Only two of the songs listed are one hit wonders: “Love is Blue” and “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.”\n\n1 “Hey Jude” The Beatles\n\n2 “Love is Blue” Paul Mauriat\n\n3 “Honey” Bobby Goldsboro\n\n4 “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” Otis Redding\n\n5 “People Got to Be Free” The Rascals\n\n6 “Sunshine of Your Love” Cream\n\n7 “This Guy’s in Love with You” Herb Alpert\n\n8 “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” Hugo Montenegro\n\n9 “Mrs. Robinson” Simon & Garfunkel\n\n10 “Tighten Up” Archie Bell & the Drells\n\nBefore starting my countdown with the best 1968 one hit wonders, I must clear up some Internet erroneous information that some proclaim on this topic.\n\nThere are two outstanding singles from 1968 by artists who have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Some may disagree with me but I don’t consider either of these individuals as “one hit wonders.”\n\nJimi Hendrix: “All Along the Watchtower” Peaked at #20 on Billboard Hot 100\n\nA song written by the legendary Bob Dylan, “All Along the Watchtower” was the only Jimi Hendrix song to chart #40 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100. However, the superb guitarist did have three other songs peaking between numbers 52 and 67: “Crosstown Traffic”, “Purple Haze” and “Foxy Lady.” Here in 2023, all 3 of these singles continue to receive heavy airplay on US classic rock radio stations.\n\n2. Janis Joplin: “Piece of My Heart” Big Brother & the Holding Company: Peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe San Francisco psychedelic rock band Big Brother & the Holding Company had Janis Joplin as lead singer. While “Piece of My Heart” was the only song to chart #40 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100, the group’s follow up single, “Down on Me” peaked at #43 during the fall of 1968. Joplin also had a posthumous #1 hit “Me and Bobby McGee” in 1971.\n\nNoteworthy 1968 one hit wonders outside of my top 20 countdown:\n\nFire—The Crazy World of Arthur Brown\n\nSkip a Rope—Henson Cargill\n\nShame Shame—Magic Lanterns\n\nIn-a-Gadda-Da-Vida—Iron Butterfly\n\nPlayboy—Gene and Debbie\n\nLove Makes a Woman—Barbara Acklin\n\nNovelty 1968 One Hit Wonders:\n\nTip Toe Thru’ the Tulips with Me—Tiny Tim\n\nHere Comes the Judge—Shorty Long\n\nQuick Joey Small (Run Joey Run)—Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus\n\nHere Comes the Judge—Pigmeat Markham\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “It’s now on with the countdown.”\n\n20.

Nugent started a solo career in 1975.\n\n1. Pictures of Matchstick Men—Status Quo\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #12 Hot 100, 55th Biggest Song of 1968\n\nBritish rock band Status Quo has my number 1 song with “Pictures of Matchstick Men.” Formed in 1962, the band is still active in 2023. Interestingly, while Status Quo has charted fifty-seven top 40 hits in the UK, they have just one hit song in the US.\n\nStatus Quo co-founder, guitarist and lead singer Francis Rossi wrote the song for band’s only American hit. The songwriter’s lyrics use the term “matchstick men” which came from a reference to the paintings and drawings of English artist L. S. Lowry.\n\n“Pictures of Matchstick Men” is musically rich, with the tune featuring a phasing audio effect and wah-wah guitars. The record is said to be one of the first to use this technique. The distinctive four-note guitar riff throughout the song makes this a memorable song from the summer of 1968.\n\nWithout a doubt, I consider “Pictures of Matchstick Men” by Status Quo as one of the best singles from 55 years ago and the greatest one hit wonder of 1968.\n\nNow that I have humbly submitted my countdown of 1968 one hit wonders, I am curious to find out your opinion on this topic. Obviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique. The songs that you feel are the best may be completely different from my selections.\n\nWhat do you consider to be the best one hit wonders from 1968? There are no right or wrong answers. I welcome your thoughts.\n\nListening to music from the golden age of Top 40 radio will always have a special place in my heart. I cherish and fondly remember my favorite “one hit wonders” of 1968. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nI discovered top 40 radio in early 1967 as an 11-year-old boy in Roanoke, Virginia. Finding WROV 1240 AM that year, expanded musical horizons in my life and set up a future course for me working as a radio DJ.\n\nAttending Oakland Elementary School, I was familiar with the Beatles and viewed “The Monkees” TV series on a weekly basis but my knowledge of pop/rock music was limited.\n\nChristmas 1966, I was gifted 3 albums that whetted my appetite for popular music at that time: “Boots” by Nancy Sinatra, “Gary Lewis & the Playboys Greatest Hits” and The Monkees’ self-titled debut album. Santa Claus also left a record player underneath the Christmas tree that year.\n\nMy parents were not rock fans so I didn’t inherit any guidance on this popular type of music. My father listened to country music on WSLC 610 AM while my mother favored the smooth “Middle of the Road” format on WDBJ 960 AM.\n\nIn the winter months of 1967, I was curious about radio and started my lifelong love of music. Located in our living room was a huge RCA stereo console, which featured an AM/FM radio. I spent many afternoons exploring various local Virginia stations after I got home from school.\n\nIt was also in this time period that I bought my first record album: “More of the Monkees.” This was the second LP released by the TV rock band and featured the mega number 1 hit “I’m a Believer.”\n\nForward to spring break 1967: with no school happening, I found an AM desk-top tube radio in our kitchen. The stations that I listened to that week both had Top 40 formats: WROV 1240 AM and WPXI 910 AM.\n\nThen on my 12th birthday in May 1967, my parents gave me a transistor radio. From that point on, I was hooked on top 40 radio and WROV.\n\nLegendary Top 40 WROV 1240 AM was the top-rated radio station in Roanoke during the mid to late 60s and also throughout the 70s decade. The two DJ’s that I distinctly remember from WROV back in ‘67 are Jack Fisher and Fred Frelantz.\n\nWROV DJs Fred Freelantz and Jack Fisher. Photo courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nBack side of WROV Roanoke Musicard: Photo courtesy of WROV History Website/Pat Garrett.\n\nMy radio listening expanded during the “summer of love” in ’67, as I commandeered the desk-top tube radio from our kitchen and permanently kept this device in my bedroom. During daylight hours, I exclusively listened to WROV.\n\nUnlike my small transistor radio, the devise in my bedroom could pick up radio stations that were located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. On many nights that summer, I would tune in 50,000-watt, clear channel AM radio stations, such as WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nI still have fond memories listening to top 40 radio during 1967. For the remainder of this article, I will be sharing what I consider to be the best songs played on top 40 music stations 55 years ago.\n\nAs a guide, I used the Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1967 survey for songs I selected with my countdown. For chart information, I utilized, “The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits” by Joel Whitburn.\n\nBelow are the top 10 songs of 1967 according to Billboard:\n\n1 “To Sir With Love” Lulu\n\n2 “The Letter” The Box Tops\n\n3 “Ode to Billie Joe” Bobbie Gentry\n\n4 “Windy” The Association\n\n5 “I’m a Believer” The Monkees\n\n6 “Light My Fire” The Doors\n\n7 “Somethin’ Stupid” Frank & Nancy Sinatra\n\n8 “Happy Together” The Turtles\n\n9 “Groovin'” The Young Rascals\n\n10 “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” Frankie Valli\n\nSongs listed below are 1967 singles that I like but fell outside my top 20 countdown, randomly placed with no ranking. It was extremely hard excluding these outstanding songs from the final listing:\n\nSoul Man—Sam & Dave\n\nThe Letter—The Box Tops\n\nLight My Fire—The Doors\n\nTo Sir with Love–Lulu\n\nExpressway (To Your Heart)—The Soul Survivors\n\nSomebody to Love—Jefferson Airplane\n\nOde to Billie Joe—Bobbie Gentry\n\nPleasant Valley Sunday—The Monkees\n\nAll You Need is Love—The Beatles\n\nGimme Little Sign—Brenton Wood\n\nMirage—Tommy James & the Shondells\n\nI Had too Much to Dream (Last Night)—The Electric Prunes\n\nFriday on My Mind—The Easybeats\n\nHere Comes My Baby—The Tremeloes\n\nReflections—The Supremes\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “It’s now on with the countdown.”\n\n20. White Rabbit—Jefferson Airplane\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #8 Hot 100, 81st Biggest Song of 1967\n\nWritten by Jefferson Airplane’s vocalist Grace Slick. Lyrics uses figurative language from two Lewis Carroll books: “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass.” “White Rabbit” was a standout performance at Woodstock in 1969.\n\n19.

Brass instruments create a rich sound on the tune.\n\n11. On a Carousel—The Hollies\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #11 Hot 100, 42nd Biggest Song of 1967\n\n“On a Carousel” is a perfect pop song, written by Hollies band members Allan Clarke, Graham Nash and Tony Hicks.

Bernadette—The Four Tops\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #4 Hot 100, 82nd Biggest Song of 1967\n\nOne of Motown’s greatest bass lines is found on this song.

Ain’t No Mountain High Enough—Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #19 Hot 100, 87th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nI rate Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell’s single as the best Motown duet of all-time and the second greatest song during the 1961-1971 time period with the record company founded by Barry Gordy. With instrumentation by the Funk Brothers and Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Terrell/Gaye are marvelous on this toe-tapping tune.\n\n5.

Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album. Instead, both songs were released as a double-A sided 45-rpm single.\n\nPaul McCartney’s masterpiece “Penny Lane” uses many instruments not associated with most Beatles songs: flutes, piccolos, oboes, trumpets and a flugelhorn. “Penny Lane” is my second favorite Beatles song of all-time and was the first 45-rpm single that I bought with my own money during the spring of 1967.\n\nWhiter Shade of Pale—Procol Harum\n\nPeak Positions of Billboard Charts: #5 Hot 100, 38th Biggest Song of 1967\n\nBritish band Procol Harum came through with another 1967 “Summer of Love” anthem with their song “A Whiter Shade of Pale.” The single sold over 10 million copies world-wide, inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and is number 57 on the Rolling Stone “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” list.\n\nThe music was composed by band member Gary Brooker and Matthew Fisher, while lyrics were written by the group’s Keith Reid. Melody on the song has a classical music feel, with an outstanding mixture of organ and bassline. This is a brilliant piece of music, in my humble opinion.\n\n“A Whiter Shade of Pale” is my second favorite song of all-time and Procol Harum’s chef d’oeuvre is my number 1 top 40 single of 1967.\n\nNow that I have submitted what I consider to be the most significant top 40 hits of 1967, I am curious to find out your opinions on this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique of superb pop hits from 1967. The songs that you might feel are the best, may be completely different from my selections.\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the fantastic top 40 hits of 45 years ago. I look forward reading your responses. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nWhat are the most significant top 40 songs from 45 years ago? While that are no definitive answers to that question, I will be sharing what I consider to be the best pop singles of 1977.\n\nDuring 1977, I lived in Roanoke, Virginia and was employed by WJLM 93.5 FM as a country DJ. With this full-time position, I was totally immersed within the genre of country music at my radio station.\n\nWhenever I wasn’t working at WJLM, my radio listening tended to be in non-country formats. Since my first love musically was rock music, I predominantly listened to top 40 stations. And whenever possible, I also tuned into “All Things Considered” on Roanoke’s NPR affiliate, WVWR 89.1 FM.\n\nMy go to radio station that I heard the most during 1977 was WROV 1240 AM. I was employed part-time at this legendary top 40 outlet while attending Virginia Western Community College during 1974 and 1975. I fondly remember regularly listening to WROV DJs Bart Prater, Rob O’Brady, Bill Jordan and Larry Bly in ’77.\n\nSince WROV reduced their power at sundown, I would sometimes listen to a couple of 50,000 watt AM stations during the nighttime: WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nOn the FM band, I could listen to a couple of high-powered top 40 North Carolina stations that came in strong throughout the Roanoke Valley: WKZL 107.5 FM Winston-Salem and WRQK 98.7 FM Greensboro. And if weather conditions were just right, I could pick up Q94 Richmond (94.5 FM) which was a premier Top 40 station in Virginia.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on most significant top 40 hits from 45-years ago. Using Billboard magazine’s, “Year-End Hot 100 Singles of 1977” chart as a reference, I will countdown the what I consider to be the best songs in this category.\n\nBelow are the ten biggest records of 1977 according to Billboard.

Without a doubt, “Hotel California” is the number 1 song on my 1977 “Fantastic Top 40 Hits” countdown.\n\nNow that I have submitted what I consider to be the most significant top 40 hits of 1977, I am curious to find out your opinions on this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nObviously, I do not want to come across as authoritative with my critique of superb pop hits from 1977.

In early June that year, WJLM program director Gary E. Cooper handed me text for a commercial that he wanted me to create for an upcoming Elvis Presley Roanoke concert, that was scheduled for August 24, 1977.\n\nWhen I recorded the spot, I used two Elvis songs for a musical bed which I felt like our WJLM listeners would recognize: “Moody Blue” which had been a number 1 hit at my station earlier that year and Presley’s 1956 hit “Don’t be Cruel.”\n\nForward to August 16, 1977: I was on vacation in Northern Minnesota visiting relatives, when my grandmother Agnes Burt shared tragic news with me: “Elvis had left the building.” Obviously stunned, I couldn’t believe that Presley had died at the young age of 42.\n\nBack in 2017, I had my friend David Hollandsworth digitize some of my old WJLM DJ airchecks from reel-to-reel tape to computer files. Thankfully, the Elvis spot that I recorded was among my saved airchecks and can be heard below; the commercial I created for Presley’s Roanoke show that never happened.\n\nElvis Presley was just one of many crossover artists that we played on WJLM during 1977. Country radio was evolving and our FM station was on the forefront of airing artists from a wider, more diverse musical mix, compared to existing traditional AM radio country formatted outlets.\n\nWith this music blog message, I will chronicle excellent classic country crossover hits from 1977. In this category, I will countdown what I consider to be the premier songs that I played on WJLM 45 years ago.\n\nIn laying out parameters on this topic, I must define the term “Country Crossover.” For purposes of this article, the definition has multiple meanings.\n\nA “Country Crossover” refers to songs and/or artists from two directions. First, pop/top 40 artists recording songs that have country music elements and became hits on country radio. Second, proven hit makers within the genre of country music who have hit songs played on pop/top 40 stations and charted on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nI will be highlighting what I consider to be the best country crossover hits that I played on WJLM Roanoke 45 years ago.\n\nWJLM changed formats in August 1976 from religious programming to playing country music. Our main competition in the Roanoke market was WSLC 610 AM.\n\nWSLC AM primarily played traditional country songs of the 70s and a heavy dose of 50s/ 60s oldies, with roots within the Nashville and Bakersfield sounds of the country music genre.\n\nCore Artists on WSLC: Johnny Cash, Conway Twitty, Buck Owens, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Tammy Wynette, Bill Anderson, Porter Wagoner. Their format tended not to play pop, outlaw or progressive county songs.\n\nOn WJLM, we played mostly current music or songs that were less than 2 years old. Our format aired traditional Nashville/Bakersfield Sound artists but only if those artists were releasing new singles. Virtually no country oldies were featured on the regular WJLM rotation.\n\nDiffering from WSLC’s format, WJLM achieved a balanced mix of hits: 50% traditional artists, with the other half being in the “Outlaw/Progressive” genre and/or pop artists that recorded songs that had crossed over to country radio.\n\nBesides traditional country music legends like Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton, WJLM core artists included Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, David Allan Coe, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt, Glen Campbell, Olivia-Newton-John, John Denver, B.J. Thomas, Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray and Elvis Presley.\n\nSince WJLM didn’t have a vast library of older hits, the station was billed as “Roanoke’s New FM Country Leader.” The biggest advantage that we held over WSLC AM: the music sounded better on WJLM as our signal was broadcasted in stereo on the FM band.\n\nWhen we started playing country music in August 1976, WJLM’s playlist was 100 percent current music. Two of the biggest crossover hits we aired that summer were “One Piece at a Time” by Johnny Cash and “If You Got the Money Honey I’ve Got the Time” from Willie Nelson.\n\nDuring the remainder of 1976, Gordon Lightfoot’s epic story song, “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” was my number 1 favorite country crossover that I played on WJLM.\n\nAt the beginning of 1977, WJLM rolled out a second slogan for our station: “Your Place in the Country.” This catchy phrase invited listeners to find a new musical home with 93.5 FM.\n\nBefore starting the best 1977 classic country crossover singles countdown, I am listing some notable songs that fell outside of my top 20 tabulation for this category.\n\nSam—Olivia Newton-John\n\nYou Light Up My Life—Debby Boone\n\nMargaritaville—Jimmy Buffett\n\nSay You’ll Stay Until Tomorrow—Tom Jones\n\nTorn Between Two Lovers—Mary MacGregor\n\nAfter the Loving—Engelbert Humperdinck\n\nHow Can I Leave You—John Denver\n\nHome Where I Belong—B.J. Thomas\n\nI submit to you what I consider to be the top 20 premier country crossover singles that I played on WJLM Roanoke during 1977. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant.\n\n20.

However, hit songs without singing were commonplace on Top 40 radio from 1960 through 1985. In that time span, there were 18 different instrumental songs all peaking at number one.\n\nThe biggest instrumental hit of the 60s is “The Theme from a Summer Place” by Percy Faith and the Orchestra. This monster hit spent 9 consecutive weeks at number 1 and was the biggest record of 1960 according to Billboard. Faith won a Grammy Award for “Record of the Year” in 1961 for this song.\n\nThe summer of 1968 was the pinnacle for instrumental hits on Top 40 radio. On the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the week ending August 3, there are three instrumentals in the top eight positions: “Classical Gas” by Mason Williams peaked at #2, “Grazing in the Grass” from Hugh Masekela ranked #4 and “The Horse” by Cliff Noble and Co was number 8.\n\nAt the end of 1968, Billboard ranked 6 instrumental songs in their “Year-End Hot 100 Singles” chart with Paul Mauriat’s tune “Love is Blue” coming in as the second biggest record for ’68.\n\nWith this latest music blog message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the top 10 most significant instrumental singles between the years of 1965 and 1969. This time frame is considered to be part of the “Golden Age of Top 40 Radio.”\n\nCriteria that I am using in this article:\n\nTune charted during the 1965 to 1969 time period\n\nSingle peaked at number 10 or higher on the Billboard Hot 100 chart\n\nSong has NO voices, speaking of words or whistling anywhere on the tune\n\nMy favorite instrumental: Soul Coaxing by Raymond Lefèvre and His Orchestra. Peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1968.\n\nInstrumentals that are good but not eligible for my countdown because of human voices, brief singing or whistling:\n\nSoul Finger—The Bar-Kays\n\nThe Good, The Bad and the Ugly—Hugo Montenegro\n\nNo Matter What Shape—The T-Bones\n\nI Was Kasier Bill’s Batman—Whistling Jack Smith\n\nThe “In” Crowd—Ramsey Lewis Trio\n\nInstrumental songs just outside of my top 10\n\nHang ‘Em High—Booker T and the MGs\n\nQuentin’s Theme—Charles Randolph Grean Sounde\n\nKeem-O-Sabe—Electric Indian\n\nAs Casey Kasem used to say on his American Top 40 show: “And now it’s on with the countdown.”\n\n10. Midnight Cowboy—Ferrante & Teicher (1969)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Easy Listening, #10 Hot 100\n\nMusical score written by John Berry for the 1969 film “Midnight Cowboy.” The Ferrante & Teicher duo were American piano players who recorded many movie soundtracks, show tunes and light classical music tunes.\n\n9. Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet—Henry Mancini & His Orchestra (1969)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 15th Biggest Hit of 1969\n\nFrom the 1969 movie “Romeo & Juliet.” Music written by Nino Rota and rearranged by Henry Mancini, who plays the piano on the tune. Session musician Hal Blaine added drums to this track.\n\n8. Grazing in the Grass—Hugh Masekela (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Hot 100, 18th Biggest Hit of 1968.\n\nHugh Masekela was a jazz trumpet player from South Africa.

Hawaii Five-0—The Ventures (1969)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #4 Hot 100, 58th Biggest Hit of 1969\n\nWritten by Morton Stevens as the theme music for CBS TV series Hawaii Five-O. The Ventures cover version spent 14 weeks on the Billboard chart. One of the band’s biggest hits.\n\n6. The Horse—Cliff Nobles & Co (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2, Hot 100, 21st Biggest Hit of 1968\n\nInteresting that Cliff Nobles didn’t perform on the tune credited to him. A group of session musicians jammed in the studio to create the instrumental track. “The Horse” was released as the B-Side of the 45-rpm single “Love is All Right” and is the instrumental version of that tune.\n\n5. Soulful Strut—Young-Holt Unlimited (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #3 Hot 100, #2 Easy Listening\n\nYoung-Holt Unlimited was a jazz trio from Chicago, Illinois.

The tune also spent 11 weeks at number 1 on the “Easy Listening” chart and became the second best selling record in 1969 according to Billboard.\n\n2. A Taste of Honey—Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass (1965)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #1 Easy Listening, #7 Hot 100\n\nSignature tune by Herb Alpert received four Grammy Awards, including “Record of the Year” in 1966. “A Taste of Honey” topped the Billboard Easy Listening chart for five weeks and the American trumpeter was a 2006 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee.\n\nClassical Gas—Mason Williams (1968)\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #2 Hot 100, 43rd Biggest Hit of 1968\n\n“Classical Gas” was composed by Mason Williams and features instrumental backup by the professional session musicians known as the “Wrecking Crew.” During 1969, the tune won three Grammy Awards for categories all associated with instrumental music. Without a doubt, the musical masterpiece known as “Classical Gas” by Mason Williams is my number 1 selection for the best instrumental top 40 single of the mid to late 60s.\n\nNow that I have submitted my top 10 premier pop instrumental hits of the 60s, I am curious to find out your opinions of this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the best Top 40 pop instrumental hits from the mid to late 60s. I look forward reading your responses. Rock on!\n\nTo subscribe to my blog via email, please click the “Follow” button in the menu above.\n\nGraphic above by Julianne Woodson\n\nWhat are the best songs played on Top 40 radio during the 70s that were not released as singles by record companies?\n\nObviously, there are no definitive answers to my question. If I asked the above inquiry to 100 folks, I would surely receive one hundred different responses.\n\nWith this latest music blog message, I will be revealing my top selections based on these factors: Growing up in Roanoke, Virginia, listening to WROV 1240 AM and then being employed by the legendary top 40 station, starting in 1974.\n\nMy regular radio listening started in the spring of 1967 after my parents gave me a transistor radio. I quickly discovered WROV and was hooked on their Top 40 format.\n\nThen in the summer of 1967, I commandeered a desk-top tube radio from our kitchen and permanently kept this device in my bedroom. On most nights that summer, I would tune in 50,000-watt, clear channel AM radio stations, such as WLS 890 Chicago and WABC 770 New York.\n\nWhen I started listening to the radio 55 years ago, I quickly realized that Top 40 stations aired only songs that were released as 45-rpm singles by record companies. The biggest album from the 1967 “summer of love” was “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” by the Beatles. Since Capitol Records didn’t release any singles on the Fab Four album, there were no songs from the LP regularly played on Top 40 outlets.\n\nIt wasn’t until late 1968/early 1969, that I noticed Top 40 radio playing album tracks. The Beatles “White Album” came out during November 1968 but Capitol Records did not release any singles from the LP in America. However, many top 40 formatted stations played select cuts from the self-titled Beatles album.\n\nOn WROV Roanoke, they played three tracks from the Beatles “White Album.” First, the station aired “Back in the U.S.S.R” and then followed up with “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” and “Rocky Raccoon.”\n\nAbove is an audio clip when I was a guest DJ for a My Fab Four segment on SiriusXM’s the Beatles Channel. Featured on this audio clip: “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” & “Back in the USSR” from the “White Album.” Two of my four favorite Beatles songs of all-time.\n\nForward to the 70s. Most Top 40 stations were still on the AM band at the beginning of the decade. The emergence of FM radio in the late 60s and early 70s created challenges for existing AM radio stations.\n\nSince music sounded 100% better on FM, ratings for AM Top 40 stations starting declining. To compensate for the competitive disadvantage AM Top 40 radio had against new FM signals, many long-standing AM outlets decided to tweak their traditional playlists.\n\nMost Top 40 AM stations in the early 70s started playing the longer album version of songs rather than the shorter edited 45-rpm single record. Many of these AM outlets also embraced the playing of “non-single” album tracks on their hot rotation playlists.\n\nSometimes an AM Top 40 station playing an album track would result in a record company releasing a song as a 45-rpm single. This happened during my first job in radio at WROV in 1974.\n\nDuring early September 1974, WROV music director Chuck Holloway started playing the song “Black Water”, which was a track from the Doobie Brothers “What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits” album. After just a few spins on Holloway’s nighttime DJ air-shift, “Black Water” became an immediate hit in Roanoke.\n\nSoon after, Phil Beckman at WQRK Norfolk and Buzz Bennett with KDWB Minneapolis added “Black Water” to their playlists. Finally, Warner Bros Records released the song as a single and the Doobie Brothers achieved their first number 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 during March 1975. WROV received a gold record for being the first radio station to play and break “Black Water” as a hit song in America.\n\nFor the remainder of this message, I will be counting down what I consider to be the ten best classic Top 40 hits of the 70s. These were songs that received heavy airplay on WROV 1240 AM Roanoke, played as an album track and not released by a record company as a 45 RPM single.\n\nMy countdown of songs in this category is based solely on my experience of living in Roanoke, Virginia and listening to Top 40 WROV. The ten selections below are from my point of reference and are not meant to be a definitive listing of top album tracks aired on Top 40 radio in America during the 70s.\n\nBefore starting the countdown, here are some clarification points on non-single album tracks played on Top 40 radio:\n\nInformation on album tracks not released as 45 RPM singles pertains only to the United States.\n\nTime frame for non-single songs is up to 24 months after an album was initially released.\n\nSince only singles were eligible to appear on Billboard Hot 100, album tracks didn’t qualify to chart in the 70s.\n\nSome songs that were originally album tracks only may have subsequently been released as a single, years or even decades after the first release of a song.\n\nLater versions of singles could be in a variety of formats: 45 RPM, 12 Inch disc, Cassette, CD or Digital Download.\n\nWith the 2001 advent of iTunes, all songs on countdown can now be purchased as a digital single: via multiple Internet platforms.\n\nWhile the album tracks from the countdown are associated with airplay on WROV, all of the selections are still well-known songs in the 21st Century. Most can be heard daily on various radio outlets: classic rock, classic hits, oldies and multiple SiriusXM channels in 2022.\n\nA song just outside of my top 10 countdown is an album track that WROV played during 1976: “Turn the Page” from the Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band LP, “Live Bullet.” Two singles were released from the album: “Nutbush City Limits” and a medley of “Travelin’ Man/Beautiful Loser”\n\nWROV’s Music Director and DJ Bill Jordan provides information below on why he decided adding “Turn the Page” to his station’s playlist in 1976: “I was music director during a pretty interesting time at WROV. We had morphed into sort of a Top 40/Album Oriented format, and readily played album cuts that “fit” the sound we wanted.”\n\nJordan continues, “A friend switched me on to Bob Seger’s “Turn the Page” from his “Live Bullet” album. We started playing it in very light rotation and it quickly exploded. Record stores couldn’t keep the album in stock.\n\nIn fact, “Turn the Page” became so popular that Capitol Records considered delaying the release of the “Night Moves” album. In 1977, Seger performed at the Salem Civic Center in his last show as an opening act for Black Sabbath.\n\n“Turn The Page” brought the house down. Great times!”\n\nIt is now time for the countdown. The top ten radio hits of the 70s not released as 45 RPM singles:\n\n10. Southern Man—Neil Young\n\nFrom the “After the Gold Rush” album: Released September 19, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Terry Young 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” and “When You Dance, I Can Really Love.”\n\n“Southern Man” is found on two albums: Neil Young’s 1970, “After the Gold Rush” LP and a live version on a live 1971 Crosby Stills Nash & Young album, “4 Way Street.” WROV DJ Terry “Motormouth” Young played this track on his 7 to midnight shift during the winter and spring of 1973. The fast-talking DJ went on bigger radio stations like WLEE Richmond and WCAU Philadelphia. Terry Young was also on SiriusXM’s 60s on 6 channel during the first part of this century.\n\n9. Isn’t She Lovely—Stevie Wonder\n\nFrom the “Songs in the Keys of Life” album: Released September 28, 1976\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Rob O’Brady 1977\n\nSingles released from album: “I Wish”, “Sir Duke”, “Another Star” and “As.”\n\nWhen Stevie Wonder’s album “Songs in the Key of Life” came out, many consumers wanted Tamla Records to release “Isn’t She Lovely” as a single. Wonder didn’t want his over six-minute song to be edited and refused to have his song cut up into a shorter 45-RPM record. Many Top 40 stations played the song anyway, including WROV. Rob O’Brady would often play Wonder’s album track on his morning drive show and announce that it was dedicated to his loyal listeners, fondly known as “O’Brady’s Ladies.”\n\n8. Let It Flow—Eric Clapton\n\nFrom the “461 Ocean Boulevard” album: Released July 1974\n\nWROV DJs I Associate with Song: Chuck Holloway, Bart Prater & Rob O’Brady 1974\n\nSingles released from album: “I Shot the Sheriff” and “Willie and the Hand Jive.”\n\nWhile most Top 40 stations added “Willie and the Hand Jive” to their playlists after Eric Clapton hit number 1 with “I Shot the Sheriff”, WROV went in another direction. Music director Chuck Holloway added the album track “Let it Grow” to its hot rotation and aired in all day-parts. Clapton plays a dobro on this track and Yvonne Elliman provides backup vocals on this melodic tune.\n\n7. South City Midnight Lady—The Doobie Brothers\n\nFrom “The Captain and Me” album: Released March 2, 1973\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Bart Prater & Larry Bly 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Long Train Running” and “China Grove.”\n\n“South City Midnight Lady” is quite different from most Doobie Brothers songs. The tune features a pedal steel guitar, strings and synthesizer. I distinctly remember WROV’s morning DJ Larry Bly playing the song regularly in the fall of 1973. However, I mostly associate this Doobie Brothers song with afternoon announcer Bart Prater. “South City Midnight Lady” was Prater’s favorite song that he played on WROV. The legendary Roanoke DJ played it regularly on the station between 1973 and 1981, before leaving to work at crosstown K92 FM.\n\n6. The Chain—Fleetwood Mac\n\nFrom the “Rumours” album: Released February 4, 1977\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Rob O’Brady 1977\n\nSingles released from album: “Go Your Own Way”, “Dreams”, “Don’t Stop” and “You Make Loving Fun.”\n\nFleetwood Mac (FM) was hot on Top 40 radio in 1977 with four-top 10 singles. Fans wanted more songs to be played from the “Rumours” album and WROV obliged by adding a fifth song from the LP. “The Chain” is the only FM song from the album with writing credits from all five members (Stevie Nicks, Lindsey Buckingham, Christine McVie, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood. The band also regularly opens their concert tours by playing “The Chain.”\n\n5. Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding—Elton John\n\nFrom the “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” album: Released October 5, 1973\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Chuck Holloway 1974\n\nSingles released from album: “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting”, “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” and “Bennie and the Jets.”\n\n“Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding” was too long for a single release, but we played it at WROV in 1974 when I first started working for the station. Coming in at over 11-minutes long, this rock song was aired only after 7 pm and then up to 5 am the next morning. Chuck Holloway played it at least once every evening on his air shift. This medley of two songs from the “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” album, is a renowned musical masterpiece by the Bernie Taupin/Elton John duo.\n\n4. I Heard It Through the Grapevine—Creedence Clearwater Revival\n\nFrom the “Cosmo’s Factory” album: Released July 8, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Bill Thomas 1970\n\nSingles released from album: “Travelin’ Band/Who’ll Stop the Rain”, “Up Around the Bend/Run Through the Jungle” and “Lookin’ Out My Backdoor/Long as I Can See the Light.”\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival (CCR) had 3-double sided top 5 hit singles from their “Cosmos Factory” album. In the fall of 1970, many Top 40 stations played CCR’s 11-minute cover version of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.” At WROV, the CCR album track only aired during night time air shifts. 7 to midnight DJ Bill Thomas played the album track on Roanoke’s top 40 outlet.\n\nIn 1972, CCR broke up and John Fogerty had a nasty falling out with his record company. Fantasy Records released an edited 3:53 version of “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” as a single. It peaked at number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973. Obviously, this version cuts out most of the outstanding instrumental ending with the Motown cover tune.\n\n3. Maybe I’m Amazed—Paul McCartney\n\nFrom self-titled “McCartney” album: Released April 17, 1970\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Jack Fisher 1970\n\nApple Records was in a quandary in April 1970: Paul McCartney officially confirmed that the Beatles had broken up, and the last Fab Four album, “Let it Be” was set to be released in May, along with the Beatles single, “The Long and Winding Road.”\n\nOn top of all that activity, a self-titled “McCartney” debut solo album, came out just a week after the news that the Beatles were history. It was then decided by Apple Records that no singles would be released from Sir Paul’s LP. That didn’t stop WROV from adding the album track “Maybe I’m Amazed” to its playlist. It was a midday favorite of legendary DJ Jack Fisher.\n\nForward to December 1976: an album by Paul McCartney & Wings was released called “Wings Over America.” This live LP featured a cover of “Maybe I’m Amazed” and it became the lead single from the album. This new rendition peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the spring of 1977.\n\n2. Baba O’Riley—The Who\n\nFrom the “Who’s Next” album: Released August 14, 1971\n\nWROV DJ I Associate with Song: Dan Alexander 1971\n\nSingles released from album: “Won’t Get fooled Again” and Behind Blue Eyes.”\n\nThe opening track from the 1971 “Who’s Next” album is “Baba O’Riley.” The song most music critics consider as the best ever recorded by the Who was not released as a 45-RPM single 51 years ago.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: “Baba O’Riley” appears in Time magazine’s “All-Time 100 Songs” list, Rolling Stone’s list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time”, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.”\n\nMy fond memory of hearing this album track played on WROV: DJ Dan Alexander created comedy bits on his AM drive show, under the fictional character name of Marvin Meriweather. One morning just after Alexander started playing “Baba O’Riley”, Marvin shouts out the chorus refrain: “It’s only TEENAGE WASTELAND, they’re all WASTED.” It was truly a LOL moment for me.\n\nStairway to Heaven—Led Zeppelin\n\nFrom the “Lead Zeppelin IV” album: Released November 8, 1971\n\nWROV DJs I Associated with Song: Terry Young and Shane Randall 1973\n\nSingles released from album: “Black Dog” and “Rock and Roll.”\n\nMy number 1 selection on the countdown is “Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin, which is the signature song by the English band. WROV’s Terry Young played the song every night in 1973, when he was employed by the station.\n\nComposed by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, “Stairway to Heaven” is considered by many as the best rock song of all-time. This Led Zeppelin tune was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, voted as the third “Greatest Rock Song” by VH1, ranked #31 on the Rolling Stone “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” listing and inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nLed Zeppelin didn’t release many singles during their career and their greatest song was only available as an album track during the 70s decade. Without a doubt, “Stairway to Heaven” is the number 1 song played on WROV/Top 40 radio in the 70s and not released as a 45 RPM single.\n\nNow that I have submitted my top ten 70s album tracks that weren’t released as singles, I am curious to find out your opinions of this topic. What are your favorite songs on my countdown?\n\nIf you were living in the 70s and listened to Top 40 radio were any of the tunes listed above played on your home town station? Or maybe a Top 40 outlet in your community played different album tracks than the songs that I documented in this article?\n\nThanks in advance for sharing your thoughts and comments below on what you consider to be the best album tracks that never were released as a 45 RPM record during the 70s. I look forward reading your responses.

Three articles that I have written over the past couple of years, about 1969, 1970 and 1971 one hit wonders, are among my most viewed messages of all-time.\n\nWith this edition of my musical musings, I am concentrating on the best “one hit wonders” of 1972. I will be counting down the top songs in this category from 50 years ago.\n\nI have fond memories listening to Top 40 radio during 1972. I turned 17 that year and lived in Roanoke County, Virginia. During daytime hours, I was a regular listener to a couple of local Top 40 AM radio stations: WROV and WBLU.\n\nMy go to station was legendary WROV 1240 AM, which was the top-rated radio outlet in Roanoke. The WROV DJs that I remember during 1972 include Bart Prater, Larry Bly, Dan Alexander, Ron Tompkins, Phil Beckman and Charlie Bell.\n\nWBLU 1480 AM was the other Top 40 outlet in the Roanoke radio market. The only times that I listened to WBLU was traveling via school bus to and from Glenvar High School, and during an afternoon art class that I took during my junior year.\n\nAt sundown, WROV reduced their power and WBLU signed off the air, so I tuned in radio stations located hundreds of miles away from my Virginia home. Since radio waves changed on a nightly basis, I would listen to a variety of 50,000-watt, clear channel AM stations on any given night.\n\nThere were three main stations that I listened to during the nighttime: WLS 890 AM Chicago, WCFL 1000 AM and WABC 770 AM New York. On the Big 89 WLS, I remember DJs John Records Landecker, Fred Winston, Chuck Buell and JJ Jeffries. When tuning in WCFL, I would listen to Larry Lujack, Big Ron O’Brien and Bob Dearborn. With WABC, I regularly heard Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow) and Dan Ingram.\n\nA Top 40 radio station that is memorable to me in 1972 was WAPE 690 AM Jacksonville. My family was on vacation in Florida during July ’72 and I talked my parents into letting me visit the WAPE studios that was located in Orange Park. Since it was my dream to become a DJ once I graduated from high school, getting to visit the “Big APE” was extremely exciting for me.\n\nDuring my tour of WAPE, I got to meet music director and afternoon DJ Cleveland Wheeler, who gave me a quick look around the station. Then before leaving, Wheeler allowed me to view the “Big APE” main studio, where Larry Dixon was working his midday DJ shift.\n\nMy visit to WAPE was influential in my pursuit to make radio a career. Less than two years later, I landed a job with WROV Roanoke in April 1974. I was thankful that I had the opportunity to tour the “Big APE” during the summer of 1972.\n\nWhat exactly is a “One Hit Wonder?” The basic definition: An artist has only one hit song on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart during their career. This music blog message pertains solely to hit songs within the United States.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, here are the criteria that I am using to define a one hit wonder:\n\nNo other songs from an artist ever peaking at number 40 or higher on the Billboard National Pop Chart. (Chart positions from number 40 to number 1).\n\nOne hit wonders vary from country to country. An artist may have just one hit in the United States but may have multiple hits in another country.\n\nRegional hits are not taken into account: A second song must be a national hit and chart within the Billboard Top 40 pop survey.\n\nAny songs peaking outside of the Top 40, are always excluded for consideration.\n\nSongs that peak from numbers 41 through 100 on the national Billboard Hot 100 pop chart are never considered as second hits.\n\nAll documentation of chart positions I share below in this article comes from The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits by Joel Whitburn. I proudly own a hard copy of this excellent reference manual, which I consider to be the ‘bible” handbook for music history with Top 40 radio.\n\nWhen I started researching the topic of 1972 one hit wonders, I found some interesting data. There happened to be no artists with only one hit, among the 20 biggest songs from 50 years ago. Below are the top records for 1972, according to Billboard magazine:\n\n1 “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” Roberta Flack\n\n2 “Alone Again (Naturally)” Gilbert O’Sullivan\n\n3 “American Pie” Don McLean\n\n4 “Without You” Nilsson\n\n5 “The Candy Man” Sammy Davis Jr.\n\n6 “I Gotcha” Joe Tex\n\n7 “Lean on Me” Bill Withers\n\n8 “Baby, Don’t Get Hooked on Me” Mac Davis\n\n9 “Brand New Key” Melanie\n\n10 “Daddy Don’t You Walk So Fast” Wayne Newton\n\n11 “Let’s Stay Together” Al Green\n\n12 “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” Looking Glass\n\n13 “Oh Girl” The Chi-Lites\n\n14 “Nice to Be with You” Gallery\n\n15 “My Ding-a-Ling” Chuck Berry\n\n16 “(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don’t Want to Be Right” Luther Ingram\n\n17 “Heart of Gold” Neil Young\n\n18 “Betcha by Golly, Wow” The Stylistics\n\n19 “I’ll Take You There” The Staple Singers\n\n20 “Ben” Michael Jackson\n\nBefore I start sharing my 1972 one hit wonders countdown, I need to correct inaccurate information on the topic. Some Internet sites erroneously give 1972 one hit wonder status to songs and artists with multiple Top 40 hits. Clearly, the two singles listed below ARE NOT 1972 ONE HIT WONDERS:\n\nBrandy (You’re a Fine Girl)—Looking Glass\n\nOne of my all-time favorite epic story songs from the 70s is actually a two-hit wonder. During the summer of 1972, “Brandy” was a number 1 song. Looking Glass had a follow up hit in 1973 with “Jimmy Loves Mary Ann” which peaked at number 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. If “Brandy” had truly been the only hit for Looking Glass, it would have made #1 on my 1972 one hit wonder countdown.\n\nLayla—Derek & the Dominoes\n\nIt is absurd to place Eric Clapton as a one hit wonder. Clapton is the writer, singer and lead guitarist for the song “Layla” which was recorded under his band’s name of Derek & the Dominoes. The only 3-time member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, had 16 Top 40 solo hits, including covering his song “Layla” in 1993. The legendary guitarist also charted multiple top 40 hits, as a member of Cream and the Yardbirds. Absolutely, Eric Clapton is NOT a one hit wonder.\n\nAs I surveyed all true one hit wonders from 1972, I found 13 high quality singles that are on my countdown. These are songs that I deem to be culturally, historically, aesthetically significant, meaningful or relevant. Ahead of my countdown beginning, I want to share some extra songs that didn’t make my Baker’s Dozen listing.\n\nNovelty records that were one hit wonders in 1972:\n\n• Jungle Fever—The Chakachas\n\n• How Do You Do—Mouth and Macneal\n\n• The Delegates—Convention 72\n\nSix-extra ’72 one hit wonders. These selections are all quality songs, that fell just outside of my Baker’s Dozen countdown:\n\nWhite Lies Blue Eyes—Bullet\n\nSmall Beginnings—Flash\n\nEasy Livin’—Uriah Heap\n\nRun Run Run—Jo Jo Gunne\n\nHallelujah—Sweathog\n\nSuavecito—Malo\n\nWithout further ado, here are what I consider to be the 13 best one hit wonders from 1972. My Baker’s Dozen countdown starts now:\n\n13. Hot Rod Lincoln—Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Hot 100: #9, 69th Biggest Hit of 1972\n\nNovelty tune. Commander Cody’s band combines country, rock, pop and western swing genres of music. Lyrics describe illegal auto racing in California.\n\n12. Popcorn—Hot Butter\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Hot 100: #9, 28th Biggest Hit of 1972\n\nFirst of two instrumental tunes on the countdown. Music composed by Gershon Kingsley. Conductor Stan Free utilizes a Moog synthesizer on this song.\n\n11. Good Time Charlie’s Got the Blues—Danny O’Keefe\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #5 Adult Contemporary #9 Hot 100 in 1972\n\nFolk singer-songwriter from Spokane, Washington. Danny O’Keefe has written hundreds of songs recorded by other artists: most prominent include Elvis Presley, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, John Denver, Jackson Browne and Glen Campbell.\n\n10. Motorcycle Mama—Sailcat\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Hot 100: #12, 89th Biggest Hit of 1972\n\nSouthern rock band from Alabama. Song written by Sailcat member John Wyker. The group decided to break up in 1973, after “Motorcycle Mama” was their only Billboard Hot 100 chart success.\n\n9. Day by Day—Godspell\n\nPeak Positions on Billboard Charts: #8 Easy Listening, #13 Hot 100 in 1972\n\nCast from the Off-Broadway musical Godspell, are featured on this folk-rock ballad. Parables from the biblical book of Matthew provide lyrical content for this successful anthem.\n\n8. Beautiful Sunday—Daniel Boone\n\nPeak Position on Billboard Hot 100 #15, 42nd Biggest Song of 1972\n\nEnglish pop musician. Daniel Boone named “Most Likable Singer” by Rolling Stone magazine in 1972. According to Wikipedia, “Beautiful Sunday” is the biggest selling single by an international artist in modern Japanese musical history.\n\n7. Thun"
