        "text": "ABOUT\n\nWe had a crazy 2021 in and out of hospital for infection and then major surgery (unrelated to COVID). We have moved to Atikokan, Ontario. BIG move from Bradford. I've worked as a part time/full time musician/vocalist since I was a teenager in acoustic folk, roots, rock, country, Celtic, lounge and even sang some sea shanties and Harry Belafonte on the after-deck of my dad’s schooner. In 1980, Jesus reached down and pulled me out of a pit. Following that, I gave my life to him and now, as a solo gospel artist I travel with “tracks” – sorry but most musicians don’t want to work for free and small conferences, ladies’ luncheons and Christian missions and churches don’t pay a lot.\n\nI have 2 musically eclectic style (because I can) CD's that have gospel lyrics (because I believe) and a country demo and have performed nearly every genre of music live over the past several decades.\n\nAnother lifetime ago I had my own band called Lonesome Dove and was privileged to have played with some excellent studio musicians who often played for people a lot more famous than I. Their willingness allowed me a season of true growth in my vocal range.\n\nMost recently, for eight years, I was with Rammy, a Celtic fusion band that played traditional and contemporary fiddle tunes mixed with an eclectic variety of other genres for which I provided lead and bg vocals and played some pretty fun percussion, including bodhran. Sadly, Rammy dis-banded (sorry for the pun) a few years ago. We all still love each other but things just do run their course. We've talked about getting back together but it hasn't happened and I don't expect it will now as we've all either moved or busy with day jobs. Also, did some work with Earl Grey.Hot! a band that played lounge and easy listening for background at corporate dinners, weddings etc.\n\nThe tunes that I have uploaded here are from my own gospel CDs and from my country/rockabilly compilation CD and do not necessarily reflect all the genres that I love to do but rather give you a taste of what I've recorded in the past. The audio song list is eclectic - country/rockabilly/gospel in the lower ranges and Christian contemporary with some soprano thrown in for a little variety.\n\nScreen name:\n\ncelestez\n\nMember since:\n\nJul 15 2009\n\nActive within 1 week\n\nLevel of commitment:\n\nCommitted\n\nYears playing music:\n\n35\n\nGigs played:\n\nOver 100\n\nInfluences\n\nThe list of musical influences could go on and on because I love to sing recognizable hits and make them my own but this will give you the gist of it and you can add etc at the end of each list:\n\nCountry – Mary Chapin Carpenter, Wynonna/The Judds/Trishia Yearwood/Reba McEntire/Tanya Tucker/Shania Twain/Patti Loveless/Linda Ronstadt/K.D. Lang/Michelle Wright/Lacy J. Dalton and of course classic country’s Patsy Cline.\n\nR&B/Soul/Gospel/Christian Contemporary - Mahalia Jackson/Sandi Patty/Amy Grant/Lynda Randle/Lauren Talley/The Martins/The Lower Lights/Ben E. King/ Sam Cooke/ Mavis Staples and other greats (always wanted to do some Aretha but never did)\n\nRock – Stevie Nicks/Bob Seger/Creedence/BTO/Marshall Tucker Band\n\nPop/Jazz/Lounge – Billy Holiday/Bette Midler /Peggy Lee/Sarah McLachlan/Sarah Brightman (because I can)/ Eva Cassidy (whom I believe except for her untimely death was destined to be one of the greatest eclectic arrangers/singers of our time);\n\nFolk - Loreena McKennitt/Joan Baez/Joni Mitchell/Peter Paul & Mary/Harry Belafonte\n\nI do a solo program called Sentimental Journey for corporate, women's and seniors' groups and clubs that don't mind me using \"back tracks\". It is a tour through the decades in music that includes cover tunes from Doris Day/Kay Star/Connie Francis/Peggy Lee/ Rosemary Clooney/Teresa Brewer/Buddy Holly/Brenda Lee/Jo Stafford/Elvis/Bob Seger and more with lots of current performers already mentioned above. The program is tailored to the group paying the bill and I would love to be able to do this program with a band when the fees allow."
