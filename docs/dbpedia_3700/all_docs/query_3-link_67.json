        "text": "Somebody here MUST know something about Jo Stafford! I was packing up my mom's old 45's the other day and came across Jo Stafford's \"You Belong To Me\" on Columbia. Just for the hell of it, I played it to see what kind of condition it was in.\n\nI was a little surprised in that, to me, it sounded like a completely different take than the one I'm used to hearing which is on the Rhino \"Sentimental Journey\" collection. Her voice isn't as 'deep' and she seems to be phrasing things a bit differently and a bit 'brighter'. I considered that maybe the single was cut a little 'fast' (is that possible?) but I could swear up and down that it's a different take all together. Rhino lists it as the same single, Columbia 39811 but clearly it doesn't sound like it.\n\nAnyone know anything?\n\nGene\n\nJo Stafford is one of my mother's favorites ... so I got a lot exposure to her Columbia songs ... I don't have the Rhino CD ... but Stafford controls all of her Columbia material ... I believe that she rerecorded \"You Belong To Me\" for Capitol and maybe Decca ... don't know if she also controls those ... does the Rhino CD indicate from where YBTM was licensed? ...\n\nI just played Jo Stafford Capitol Collectors Series CD last night.Nice one Ron\n\nThe box set is nice,she was a great singer,made even greater by the fact that when her instrument wasn't up to her standard anymore,she gave the game away and retired with her reputation intact.A truly class act.\n\nA bit of trivia,Did you know that the original version of \"You Belong To Me\" was done by Sue Thompson on Mercury.She who late went to Hickory Records and had hits like \"Sad Movies(Make Me Cry) and \"Norman\".I always thought it was Jo Stafford.\n\nCousin It: I just played Jo Stafford Capitol Collectors Series CD last night.Nice one Ron\n\nThe box set is nice,she was a great singer,made even greater by the fact that when her instrument wasn't up to her standard anymore,she gave the game away and retired with her reputation intact.A truly class act.\n\nIt's true she generally stopped recording, but I wouldn't want to be without her cover of \"Stayin' Alive.\"\n\nStephen"
