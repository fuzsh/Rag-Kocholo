        "text": "At the time in the late 1930s and early 1940s when instrumental Big Band recordings were the most popular (the top three best-sellers in Big Band history were all instrumentals), the 'girl' singers were also attracting a great deal of attention. Even though the singers in that time were thought of as part of the total package, much as any orchestra member, they provided a decorative adjunct to the band's appearance on stage and in ballrooms, and often became a main musical attraction. These are some of the ladies we are presenting in this collection, twenty-eight of the many performers who distinguished themselves with the Big Bands and beyond, captured in their most memorable recordings as well as a few performers whose novelty recordings allowed their star to shine brightly for only an instant. Most of the singers in this album, however, honed their craft on the bandstand.\n\nAlso Available The Groups Sing JASCD393 & The Gentlemen Sing JASCD397\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc One\n\n1.
