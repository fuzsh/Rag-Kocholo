        "text": "I’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948, 1949.\n\nThe tenth (!) year of my run through the history of pop music, 1950, is after the establishment of the Cold War. We get a top 30 songs again this year. Note that years that end in zero are sometimes thought of as the start of a decade and sometimes as the end of a decade. I’m choosing to view them as the end of decades because I started with 1941, so this is the last of my 1940’s charts!\n\nAs I wrote in 1946, the period between WW2 and the Doo-wop era of the 1950s gets very little coverage in US popular culture, so I’m interested in building my knowledge of both the music and the evolution of US politics and culture through this time. Here are some contextual details:\n\nThe top grossing movie in 1950 was Samson and Delilah ($9M), a Cecil B. DeMille film retelling the biblical story. Sunset Boulevard won the Best Picture Oscar for the year. The film, about an attempted comeback by a silent movie star, has been ranked among the best movies ever made. The Emmy for the Best Dramatic Show in 1950 was Pulitzer Prize Playhouse. Major US events in 1950 were: development of the H-Bomb started, McCarthy accused 205 state dept. officials of being communists, Einstein warned of mutually assured destruction, the world’s first Broken Arrow event, Disney released Cinderella, the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to an African American author for the first time (Gwendolyn Brooks for Annie Allen), US forces came to the aid of South Korea (beginning US involvement in the Korean War), Beetle Bailey was created, the first 500-mile NASCAR race was held, Peanuts was first published, the first jet-to-jet dogfight happened (over Korea), Shirley Temple retired, MacArthur threatened to use nukes in Korea (!), the first TV remote control was marketed, and the US sent its first military advisors to Vietnam.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population, but I include the genders of all folks in the named artist on the track, so women could be on 100% of the tracks if all the named artists included both men and women. That hasn’t been the case at all so far: men dominate the charts. Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940a and 1950s, you would expect about three of the top 30 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1950 chart wasn’t really dominated by any one artist, with the Ames Brothers having 3 hits, five other artists with two hits, and 17 other artists with one hit each.\n\nBlack artists were part of two of the 23 artists on the 1950 charts, so 9%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on two out of 30, so 7%. The expected rate for the 1940s and 1950s would be 10%, so Black artists are pretty close to representation this year. Compare that track percentage to 1941-47: 8, 5, 20, 28, 18, 8, 9, 5, and 3%. It looks like Black artists got a big boost during the war, returned to expected representation afterwards, and saw a dip below expected representation and are back to close to expected representation in 1950.\n\nThis year sees the first Native-identified artist on the charts, Kay Starr, who is listed as both a solo artist and in collaboration with a white artist. That puts Native artists on the same level as Black artists for 1950, with two artists and two tracks. Native folks were 0.2% of the people in the USA in 1950.\n\nAs has become a trend since the war ended, there are no Latinx artist(s) on the 1950 charts (0%), and Latinx folks were about 2% of the US at the time, so they’re underrepresented on the charts.\n\nWomen are in seven of the 23 named artists (30%), and 10 of the 30 tracks (33%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. Compare these numbers to 1941-47: 9, 12, 15, 38, 18, 21, 15, 30, and 27%. Women have a big bump in 1944, which could be because of the war, or it could be related to the musicians’ strike, then decline for 45-47, but they are back up in 1948-1950.\n\nNotable songs include: 23. Ames Brothers – Rag Mop, 18. Patti Page – Tennessee Waltz, 15. Phil Harris – The Thing, and 11. Eileen Barton – If I Knew You Were Coming I’d’ve Baked A Cake. My favorite is 3. Anton Karas – Third Man Theme. I gave 22 of 30 (73%) a <3 this year. Compare that to 37% in 1949, 67% in 1948, 57% in 1947, 46% in 1946, 65% in 1945, 60% in 1944, 63% in 1943, 45% in 1942, and 41% in 1941. This is my highest <3 percent so far: I like 1950’s music, so maybe this is a trend? This year has several “throwback” tunes that may reflect a nostalgia for the pre-war period. It seems to be a lull in creativity between the swing era and the rock era, but I liked almost 3/4 of the songs, so maybe it’s a good fit for my taste?\n\nThe 1950 Charts:\n\nFrankie Laine – Cry Of The Wild Goose – “Aah-ahh” chorus starts us out, with a fast-paced train beat. It sounds like a Western song, but with some jazzy overtones. The wild goose cry is a metaphor for untamed love, I think. It’s an OK song, and I like the fast pace. It really sounds like the 1950s. <3. White male artist.\n\nBing Crosby – Dear Hearts And Gentle People – Banjo, and down-home back up band sound. Then Bing sings his velvety tones over the band and it’s a bit jarring. It’s a song about the goodness of rural people, but Bing doesn’t have the tonality to make a Country song sound correct. White male artist.\n\nBilly Eckstine – My Foolish Heart – This one starts out very lyrical, almost classical. Then Billy Eckstine comes in crooning about his fooooolish heaaaart. It’s one of the better crooning tunes I’ve heard, and crosses over into the ballad style of the 50s, so I’ll <3 it. Black male artist.\n\nAmes Brothers – Can Anyone Explain? – Swelling strings set a maudlin mood. The Ames brothers sing in harmony, asking whether anyone can explain the thrill of a kiss. They answer: No, no, no. They play with rhymes between “know” and “no”. It’s slow, shapeless, and uninspiring. White male artists.\n\nGordon Jenkins – Bewitched – YouTube to the rescue. It seems to be an instrumental. It’s got very little going for it, in terms of tune or organization. It would be at home as elevator music. Wow! A female vocalist comes in after the halfway point, singing in a way that is still uninspiring, but I had been convinced it would be an instrumental. It’s not great. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – Hoop-Dee-Doo – Bright horns to start us out, then an accordion! It’s a polka meta-song, as Perry sings about how polka music makes him happy. It’s a simple, bright song, but it makes me want to hear it again, so I’ll <3 it. White male artist.\n\nBill Snyder – Bewitched – Another cover of this track. It was uninspiring before, on the Gordon Jenkins version…. But this one is actually musically good. Something about the way the piano is working with the orchestra is making me pay attention this time. This version is really an instrumental, and it’s quality. <3. White male artist.\n\nAmes Brothers – Rag Mop – I love this tune, just because it’s so silly. It’s a “spelling” song, where they spell “rag mop”, but they spell it “r-a-g-g m-o-p-p”. I could listen to this one on repeat. <3. Also: it’s got the beginning of that “sock hop” sound that’s typical of the early 50s in my experience. White male artists.\n\nGordon Jenkins – My Foolish Heart – YouTube to the rescue. This one sounds a lot like the previous Jenkins tune: uninspired piano, “aah-aah” chorus, and lackadaisical orchestra. It’s just not for me. It seems to be building to something? Maybe vocals? Yes, male vocals come in, halfway through. This old style of long instrumental introductions is becoming rare. The vocals are as uninspiring as the rest of this tune. White male artist.\n\nPatti Page – All My Love – Trumpet fanfare to start, then whimsical flutes and guitar. Where is this song going? Patti has a great voice, and she seems to begiving you all her love, even if the skies fall. The guitar gives this a bit of Latin flavor, but the words and the rest of the tune don’t have any. It’s really not a song for me, but I will note that it has what I would think of as an “early 50s” sound. Now she’s singing a bunch of Spanish words, but it doesn’t convince me that it’s a Latin song. Please try harder. White female artist.\n\nTennessee Ernie Ford and Kay Starr – I’ll Never Be Free – Slow song, with a Western sound, but also a distinct “early rock” vibe. If I heard this song from a new artist, I would classify it as “rockabilly”. I like it. It has an interesting mix of vocals, piano, and steel guitar, backed by brushes on the snares. <3 White male and native female artists. Interestingly, Kay Starr was born on a reservation to a white mother and Iroquois father. She is the first native artist I’ve found on these charts.\n\nAndrews Sisters and Gordon Jenkins – I Can Dream, Can’t I – No instrumental intro, it just starts out with the backup singers and goes right into the vocalist singing the melody. It still has a “older” jazzy sound. It’s a slow love song. I like it (I like most AS tunes). <3. White male and female artists.\n\nPatti Page – Tennessee Waltz – In my days in the Tennessee marching band, this was the tune we used to end many halftime shows, and an upbeat version was part of the pregame show. So I already know and love this tune. At any rate, it starts out with some jazzy trumpet setting the melody. Then we get Patti singing in harmony with another woman singing this old familiar tune about losing love. This song always gives me goosebumps, and it can often make me cry. It’s the combination of the sentiments in the song, the musicality of it, and the nostalgia I feel to those late teen/early twenties years. 1995 is a long time ago now, and this song takes me back to that feeling of standing on the football field with 100,000+ fans singing along to the Tennessee Waltz. Goosebumps. <3. White female artist.\n\nAndrews Sisters and Gordon Jenkins – I Wanna Be Loved – Starts out with “ooh-ooh” chorus and emotional strings. Then we get into AS vocals, and it’s just great. It has that jazz standard sound. I don’t usually like slow love songs, but the Andrews Sisters get past the things that make me dislike slow love songs. <3. White female and male artists.\n\nAmes Brothers – Sentimental Me – Sentimental strings start us out, and set a very maudlin scene. It’s a crooning piece. Not at all like “Rag Mop” I’m afraid. The sound is fuller because there are four of them singing the crooning part, and that seems to have made it better. Honestly, the musicality here is better than many of the crooning songs in the 1940s. OK. I’ll <3 this song. What is becoming of me? White male artists.\n\nPhil Harris – The Thing – Bright trumpets and we’re off: this is a big, expansive song. Male vocalist singing a story song. He found a thing in a crate in the bay, but they won’t say what it is. Whenever they would use a noun, they have percussion instead. What is it? I’m curious now. We’re on the third verse and it’s become an albatross for the narrator. Each verse changes key, adding stress. Even St. Peter won’t take it. We never find out what the thing is! <3. White male artist.\n\nTony Martin – There’s No Tomorrow – Frantic violins build to an operatic vocal, singing the title verse. It folds into a standard crooner tune. It’s all about a one-night stand, I think: “There’s no tomorrow, there’s just tonight.” It’s not really a tune for me. White male artist.\n\nGordon Jenkins and The Weavers – Tzena, Tzena, Tzena – Frantic pace, quickly into the vocals. They are going quickly. There is no waiting with this song. It seems to be about dancing in the city square in the old country. Or something; I can’t tell because it’s so frantic. I can dig it, though. <3. White male and female artists.\n\nKay Starr – Bonaparte’s Retreat – Sassy saxophone and muted trumpets set up a jazz standard sound. Kay Starr has such a great voice. It’s about a man who is romancing her while the fiddles play Bonaparte’s Retreat. In that way it’s a kind of meta song. I think. Who cares: it’s great Dixieland Jazz. <3. Native Female artist.\n\nEileen Barton – If I Knew You Were Coming I’d’ve Baked A Cake – This sounds a bit like a novelty song. It has a more 50s sound than the rest of these tunes. It’s catchy and it’s all about shaming someone for dropping in unplanned. Then it’s Dixieland Jazz. What’s not to love. <3.\n\nSammy Kaye and Don Cornell – It Isn’t Fair – Belting out the title lyric is an interesting way to start a song. It’s not really crooning; it’s all belted out. It actually sounds very 60s to my modern ear. It’s not really my kind of tune, though: too slow and sappy. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – Harbor Lights – Steel guitar, very Hawaiian-sounding to my ear. Then we get a male and female voice singing about “harbor lights that once brought you to me…” It’s another slow, sappy song, so not really for me. White male artist.\n\nRed Foley – Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy – Hambone and guitar to start us out. It’s got a good beat, a locomotive beat. I like this song: it’s about a shoe shine boy who has so much music and dance in him that he gets everyone else around him excited. With this song, I can hear the tranisiton from the “solid four” beat of the 40s to the rock beat of the 50s. <3 White male artist.\n\nGuy Lombardo – Third Man Theme – This is a fully orchestrated version of the original, which seems to have charted higher. I love this tune; it was part of what got me excited about old movies when I first watched the Third Man with my parents back in the 1980s. I’ll <3 this version, but I like the original better. White male artist.\n\nTeresa Brewer – Music, Music, Music – This song has a purposeful old-timey sound, with tinkly piano and a reference to a nickelodeon in the refrain. It’s got a strong beat and a happy feel, so I’ll give it a <3. White female artist.\n\nGary and Bing Crosby – Simple Melody – Starts out with jazzy trumpets and a fast beat. Then we get Bing’s voice, but it’s not a strict crooning song. I can get behind this song: it has a simple melody and a strong beat, and it harks back to ragtime. The last two songs have been this kind of throwback sound; it suggests a nostalgia feeling in 1950, which fits with this period being a lull in developing novelty in popular culture. <3 White male artists.\n\nGary and Bing Crosby – Sam’s Song – According to Spotify, this song has the subtitle “The Happy Tune”. That’s what Bing sings in his first line, after a 20 second introduction. It’s a pretty fast, jazzy tune. It’s a meta song, too, because the lyrics are all about how Sam’s Song is so catchy you can’t forget it… These factors make me <3 this song. In the third section they add a fast-paced spoken counterpoint to the main singing line, so it’s even better than it initially sounded! White male artists.\n\nAnton Karas – Third Man Theme – As I mentioned above, this one is one of my favorite movie tunes of all time. I went crazy for it in the late 1980s when I saw the movie at the Orpheum Theater in Memphis, TN. It’s a catchy piece, played on the zither, which has a beautiful sound. According to Wikipedia, the popularity of this tune and the movie it came from resulted in a worldwide surge in zither sales. <3 White male artist.\n\nNat King Cole – Mona Lisa – I’ve already <3’d this song from when I’ve had it come up in Spotify rotation. Honestly, I could probably <3 every Nat King Cole song right now without listening: he’s so consistently wonderful. This song is very expansive, slow, and would be sappy in the hands of any other performer. With Nat King Cole, though, it’s a wonderful, warm, sentimental experience. Wikipedia indicates this song won an Oscar for best original song in 1950. Black male artist.\n\nGordon Jenkins and The Weavers – Goodnight Irene – Sad violins start us out, then the speed picks up and we get a big unison chorus singing us this traditional ballad. I’m most familiar with this song, honestly, from the videogame Bioshock: Infinite, where it’s sung by a crowd while they wait for you to show up and continue the story. The videogame crowd will sing the song on a loop until you finally show up, and it’s one of the many eerie moments designed into that game. This recording is a good one, and it is understandable why it would chart, but it’s not clear to me why it would be #1 for the year. I suppose it’s more of the throwback traditioinalism that led to Simple Melody and Music, Music, Music charting so high as well. I’ll <3 this cover. White male artists.\n\nI’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1948.\n\nThe ninth year of my run through the history of pop music, 1949, is after the establishment of the Cold War. We only get a top 30 songs this year.\n\nAs I wrote in 1946, the period between WW2 and the Doo-wop era of the 1950s gets very little coverage in US popular culture, so I’m interested in building my knowledge of both the music and the evolution of US politics and culture through this time. Here are some contextual details:\n\nThe top grossing movie in 1949 was Jolson Sings Again ($5M), the second part of the musical film biography of Al Jolson, focusing on his time entertaining troops in WW2. All the King’s Men won the Best Picture Oscar for the year. The noir film depicts the career of an idealistic politician who becomes as corrupt as those he started out fighting. The Emmy for the Most Popular Show in 1948 was Pantomime Quiz, and for 1949 it was Texaco Star Theater. Major US events in 1949 were: The first VW Beetle was imported; the first Emmy Awards; the first non-stop around-the-world airplane flight; NATO is formed; the Red Scare continued; the US sent a rhesus monkey into space; the first NASCAR race was held; Hopalong Cassidy premiered; the first US spree shooting happened; the Englewood race riot in Chicago happened; and this year is the first year on record that no Black American was lynched.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population, but I include the genders of all folks in the named artist on the track, so women could be on 100% of the tracks if all the named artists included both men and women. That hasn’t been the case at all so far: men dominate the charts. Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940s, you would expect about three of the top 30 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1949 chart was dominated by Gordon Jenkins, Russ Morgan, and Vaughan Monroe, with three tracks each.\n\nBlack artists were part of 1 of the 20 artists on the 1949 charts, so 5%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on 1 out of 30, so 3%. The expected rate for the 1940s would be 10%, so Black artists are under-represented this year. Compare that track percentage to 1941-47: 8, 5, 20, 28, 18, 8, 9, and 5%. It looks like Black artists got a big boost during the war, returned to expected representation afterwards, and now have seen a dip below expected representation. The backlash continues this year, but we have our first interracial collaboration to chart, with Tommy Dorsey and Charlie Shavers credited for their song, “The Hucklebuck”.\n\nAs has become a trend since the war ended, there are no Latinx artist(s) on the 1949 charts (0%), and Latinx folks were about 1.5% of the US at the time, so they’re underrepresented on the charts. This, combined with the last point reinforces a whitening of popular music in the post-war era.\n\nWomen are in 7 of the 20 named artists (35%), and 8 of the 30 tracks (27%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. Compare these numbers to 1941-47: 9, 12, 15, 38, 18, 21, 15, 30%. Women have a big bump in 1944, which could be because of the war, or it could be related to the musicians’ strike, then decline for 45-47, but they are back up in 1948 and 1949.\n\nNotable songs include: #24 Baby, It’s Cold Outside, as well as both Evelyn Knight tunes (#23 Powder Your Face With Sunshine, #8 A Little Bird Told Me). My favorite is #29 The Hucklebuck (also the first interracial collaboration on the charts). I gave 11 of 30 (37%) a <3 this year. Compare that to 67% in 1948, 57% in 1947, 46% in 1946, 65% in 1945, 60% in 1944, 63% in 1943, 45% in 1942, and 41% in 1941. This is my least-favorite year yet. The lack of diversity seems to have translated into a bunch of cloying, crooning tunes that are not to my taste. Perhaps this is why American period dramas skip the post-WW2 era.\n\nThe 1949 Charts:\n\nGordon Jenkins – I Don’t See Me In Your Eyes Any More – YouTube to the rescue, first thing! Weepy strings start us on a maudlin track. Then a sad-sounding male chorus singing the title to the song. This is an archetypal lost love sad song. I’m not a fan. White male artist.\n\nTommy Dorsey and Charlie Shavers – The Hucklebuck – Piano and bass set up a rollicking jazz tune. It has trumpets and saxophones playing the melody. Could it be an instrumental? It’s a good, old-fashioned Big Band tune and I <3 it. It does a good job of building complexity and adding instruments while keeping the theme. We get the male vocalist after 1:20. He’s singing about a dance: The Hucklebuck. He manages to rhyme “sacroiliac”, so this song only gets better. Also: this is the first song with an interracial named artist, with white Dorsey teaming with Black Shavers. Of course, it’s also the only song with a Black artist this year, and he shares billing with a white artist, so in some ways it supports the overall whitening of the charts for 1949. History is complicated.\n\nDick Haymes – Maybe It’s Because – Wow! Starts out with big harmony singing from a chorus. Also starts with singing the title. Then we get Dick Haymes singing, but not quite crooning. This song is OK, but it’s not my favorite. It’s a falling-in-love song. It feels very square. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como and The Fontane Sisters – ‘A’ You’re Adorable – Maudlin strings start us out, setting up a sentimental song. Then we get Perry Como crooning. This is an alphabet song, where each letter is a complement to the girl. So sappy. As often happens, it starts to skip over letters late in the alphabet. White male and female artists.\n\nSammy Kaye – Careless Hands – YouTube to the rescue. This has “singing guitar” in the intro. Then a chorus sings the lyrics, it has a bit of a Western feel. It’s another “abused lover” song about someone who is mistreated by their lover. It’s not for me, alas. White male artist.\n\nJo Stafford and Gordon MacRae – Whispering Hope – More maudlin strings. Is this a year of sappy songs? OMG it’s another song with male and female voices singing in unison. I can’t stand it! This song is about having hope to pass through troubling times, but I can hardly keep listening to it, it’s so saccharine. White male and female artists.\n\nJohnny Mercer and Margaret Whiting – Baby, It’s Cold Outside – A lot has been written about this song lately. I’m not a fan, given it’s modern context, but the construction of the song is very good, from a musical perspective. If it weren’t for the consent issues, I would heart this song. White male and female artists.\n\nEvelyn Knight – Powder Your Face With Sunshine – Hi-hat, then a wolf whistle and a male chorus asks her how she got that great look. She answers with the title. It’s a great, jazzy song, and I’ll ignore the street harassment opening because it’s in control by the lady singing it. It has a whistling bridge! <3. White female artist.\n\nRuss Morgan – So Tired – Big trumpets to start us out. This will be a BIG SONG it seems to say. It doesn’t sound tired. He’s so tired of waiting for you, longing for you. Why are you making him wait? The song has gone from BIG to pretty sparse instrumentation, featuring Russ’s sound, which actually sounds more 1950s and less croon-y, 1930s. I can get into this song. <3. It does drag in the bridge, a bit. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Red Roses For A Blue Lady – Chorus of male voices sings the title at the very beginning. Then we get into the single male vocalist: he’s trying to make up for his silly quarrel by bribing his lady with flowers. It’s a bit to sappy for me, but it’s starting to have a sound more like the vocals of the 1950s, I think. White male artist.\n\nBing Crosby – Galway Bay – Oboe sets up a nautical/Irish theme… Then we get Bing’s velvety crooning as he sings about an Irish pastoral scene. It’s really a crooning tune and I’m not interested. White male artist.\n\nDinah Shore – Buttons & Bows – I <3’d this tune when it charted at #21 in 1948. I’m glad it’s back.\n\nBing Crosby – Far Away Places – Oooh-oooh chorus sets up a dreamy scene. Bing’s voice is great, but I’m just not into the crooning (and I can almost tell that we’re done with it! I’m impatient!). This song may also be racist; I’m not sure because I’m not really listening anymore. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – Room Full Of Roses – YouTube to the rescue. More “singing guitar”. It’s about like the last Sammy Kaye tune: chorus singing the lyrics, singing guitar, and no energy. Blah. I’m surprised, because in the early 40s, Kaye was a swinging Big Band artist. White male artist.\n\nGordon Jenkins – Don’t Cry, Joe – YouTube to the rescue. Male chorus starts out singing the title… Female chorus sings “let her go…” I think this is a song about letting go of someone if you love them. It’s not my style, though: slow and maudlin. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – Forever & Ever – Bouncing, happy strings lead us into Como crooning the title phrase. It’s really just a classic crooning song, about waiting for your love. Not for me, I’m afraid. White male artist.\n\nRuss Morgan – Forever & Ever – This sounds very similar to the Como version. It has a chorus singing at the onset, though. It’s not any better. White male artist.\n\nGordon Jenkins – Again – YouTube to the rescue. Building strings lead us into a slow, lyrical tune. I can already tell it’s not my cup of tea: too slow and maudlin. We have a bunch of those in a row this year. Too bad for me. It goes on like this for some time, then we get a male crooning voice with a lot of reverb: he sounds like he’s at the bottom of a well. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Someday – Chorus sings along with Monroe, singing that someday you’ll want him to be true when he’s in love with someone else. I’m not sure what the point of the song is, unless it’s a “you’re making a mistake rejecting me” thing. It’s also straight crooning. White male artist.\n\nThe Blue Barron – Cruising Down The River – YouTube to the rescue. Oom-pah-pah band backing up a big chorus. It’s all very quaint sounding. It feels more 1910s and less 1950s. It has a whistling bridge… White male artist.\n\nAl Morgan – Jealous Heart – YouTube to the rescue. Piano and guitar, with some strings backing them up. It’s slightly better than the other recent tunes, but not enough that I want to hear it again. White male artist.\n\nFrankie Laine – Mule Train – A VERY Western song. It has a horse (mule) trotting beat, and the lyrics actually sing “clippity-clop” to invoke the sense of the mule train. There are cracking whip sound effects and everything. Points for difference. I’ll <3 it because it’s so fresh compared to everything else I’ve heard recently on this chart. It actually has some Doo-wop tones to it. White male artist.\n\nEvelyn Knight – A Little Bird Told Me – Oooh-ooh chorus starts us out. Then we get rocking piano and claps. It’s actually a rocking little tune. I like Knight’s vocals, and the band has a proto-rock sound. <3\n\nRuss Morgan – Cruising Down the River – Oom-pah pah. It’s the same as the Blue Barron tune, above at #11. It’s slightly better in its orchestration and execution, so I’ll <3 it. White male artist.\n\nThe Andrews Sisters and Gordon Jenkins – I Can Dream, Can’t I – Finally, Andrews Sisters! It starts out with a chorus singing “Dream of” and it reminds me of the rock tune “Dream, Dream, Dream”. This one is a solid little ditty with the Andrews Sisters sounding as good as usual. <3 White male and female artists.\n\nJimmy Wakely and Margaret Whiting – Slipping Around – Piano picks out the intro in a very rag-time sound, then we get a classic Country song, complete with steel guitar. I like it, and it’s got a much more modern sound than many of the other songs on this chart. It’s really like the modern C&W sound appeared fully on this tune. <3. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – Some Enchanted Evening – Of course, I love this song because of the moment when Harrison Ford sings it in American Graffiti. That movie is set in 1962, so 13 years in the future from this chart. It’s a classic song, and I’ll <3 it despite its crooning nature. In the end, some crooning songs make it to the heart level. White male artist.\n\nVic Damone – You’re Breaking My Heart – Squeaky strings set an ethereal tone, and we get high-pitched angel chorus. Damone seems to be singing a real crooner here. I’m having a hard time not LOLing at this tune. It’s not my style. White male artist.\n\nFrankie Laine – That Lucky Old Sun – Spare guitar starts us out. The vocals are spare, too, but have a rock and roll quality to the way they are recorded: more Elvis, less Bing. Not to say that this is a good song, though. It’s not to my taste. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Riders In The Sky – Another Western. I’ve heard this tune covered by other artists. Johnny Cash, in particular. It’s structurally a good song, and this version is good despite the crooning approach of Monroe. If I didn’t know this was older than the Cash version, I would assume this was a lesser imitation. <3. White male artist.\n\nI’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1947.\n\nThe eighth year of my run through the history of pop music, 1948, is after the establishment of the Cold War. We get a top 39 songs this year.\n\nAs I wrote in 1946, the period between WW2 and the Doo-wop era of the 1950s gets very little coverage in US popular culture, so I’m interested in building my knowledge of both the music and the evolution of US politics and culture through this time. Here are some contextual details:\n\nThe top grossing movie in 1948 was The Red Shoes ($5M), where a ballerina must choose between her career and her love for a composer. The Lawrence Olivier version of Hamlet won the Best Picture Oscar for the year. Also noteworthy was best director to John Huston for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, the movie that gave us the “Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!” line. Major US events in 1948 were: NASCAR was founded; SCOTUS outlaws religious instruction in public schools ; the Hells Angels were founded; the Marshall Plan was authorized; the US recognized Israel as a country; the Vanport, Oregon, flood happened; the US launched the first monkey into space; the Berlin blockade and airlift began; Truman issued the military draft to prepare for war with the USSR; Truman ended racial segregation in the armed forces; the Red Scare picked up speed with investigations in the House Un-American Activities Committee; Truman defeated Dewey (and Dixiecrat Strom Thurman) in the famous “Dewey Defeats Truman” election; and the first Kinsey Report was published.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population, but I include the genders of all folks in the named artist on the track, so women could be on 100% of the tracks if all the named artists included both men and women. That hasn’t been the case at all so far: men dominate the charts. Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940s, you would expect about four of the top 39 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1948 chart wasn’t really dominated by anyone, as four artists had two tracks and the rest all had one track each.\n\nBlack artists were 2 of the 35 artists on the 1947 charts, so 6%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on 2 out of 39, so 5%. The expected rate for the 1940s would be 10%, so Black artists are under-represented this year. Compare that track percentage to 1941-47: 8, 5, 20, 28, 18, 8, and 9%. It looks like Black artists got a big boost during the war, returned to expected representation afterwards, and now have seen a dip below expected representation. I wonder if there was a backlash that will continue in the late 40s and into the 50s?\n\nAs with 1947, there are no Latinx artist(s) on the 1948 charts (0%), and Latinx folks were about 1.5% of the US at the time, so they’re underrepresented on the charts. This, combined with the last point suggests a whitening of popular music in the post-war era.\n\nWomen are in 11 of the 35 named artists (31%), and 12 of the 39 tracks (30%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. Compare these numbers to 1941-47: 9, 12, 15, 38, 18, 21, 15%. Women have a big bump in 1944, which could be because of the war, or it could be related to the musicians’ strike, then decline for 45-47, but they are back up in 1948.\n\nNotable songs include: #37 and #10 I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover; #34 and #15 Woody Woodpecker; #29 William Tell Overture (Spike Jones); #2 Manana. My favorite is #1 “Twelfth Street Rag” by Pee Wee Hunt. I gave 26 of 39 (67%) a <3 this year. Compare that to 57% in 1947, 46% in 1946, 65% in 1945, 60% in 1944, 63% in 1943, 45% in 1942, and 41% in 1941. This is my most-liked year so far, and it could reflect a change in the music to become more “modern”, or at least more “1950s”, which I have a soft spot for. I’m looking forward to Doo-Wop eventually.\n\nThe 1948 Charts:\n\nJo Stafford – Serenade Of The Bells – Bells, and an “ooh-aaah” chorus. Jo sings a Mexican story… Too bad they couldn’t have a Latinx person sing the tune. It’s a lovey-dovey love song, so it’s not really for me. White female artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – How Soon – Strings sing a sappy, swelling tune, and we get Vaughn crooning relatively close to the start. It’s still a crooning song, though, so it’s not for me. White male artist.\n\nRuss Morgan and Milt Herth – I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover – This is another one of the tunes my granddaddy used to sing to me when I was little. I have a real soft spot for it in my heart. It’s a marching-band arrangement, and the vocals are sung by a big male/female chorus, belting it out like they’re on the football field at halftime. I love this song, but it’s interesting how the words my granddad sang aren’t the words in the recording; he must have had some drift in the memory of the song between 1948 and 1984… Or else I’ve had some drift over my time. <3. White male artists.\n\nFreddy Martin – The Dickey-Bird Song – Starts out like soft jazz, with a piano and bass, soft chorus, and now whistling of the melody. I like it. It’s a good, medium walking pace jazz song. It’s about animals singing about how great this time of year is and how great it is to fall in love. <3. White male artist.\n\nRay Noble – I’ll Dance at Your Wedding – Drumstick tapping, then slowly adding wind instruments to build the harmony and melody. It’s groovy, and had a solid big-band sound. Now we have a spoken-word intro with a woman telling Buddy he needs to stop dancing so he can get ready for the wedding. He’s singing how he’ll dance at the wedding in his old shoes. It’s got a good beat and I like it. <3 for its inventive lyrics and good musicality. White male artist.\n\nSportsmen and Mel Blanc – Woody Woodpecker – This seems to be the theme song from the Woody Woodpecker short subject movies! It’s pretty entertaining, featuring the characteristic Woody Woodpecker laugh and Mel Blanc’s voice work. This is actually one of two covers on the charts for 1948, with the other one (#15, Kay Keyser) the more famous. <3. White male artists.\n\nKay Kyser – On a Slow Boat to China – Starts with the male vocalist and then brings in the horns in a big unison. Then calms down to a groovy jazz tune that I can dig. It sounds like 1948 is going to be bigger on cool jazz (I hope, please I hope). I like this one and <3 it. It picks up the pace in the third section: is this the fast boat to China? White male artist.\n\nPrimo Scala – Underneath The Arches – YouTube to the rescue. This is an unimpressive tune with a rinky-tink musicality and unison chorus singing the words. It’s easy to hear why it’s not on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nTex Beneke – St. Louis Blues March – Bright trumpets and a march pace, with a marching beat start us out. We get a drum solo really setting the march scene. It’s basically jumping back and forth between a jazzy big-band tune and a marching modality. I like it (I like marches), so I’ll <3 it. White male artist.\n\nFrankie Carle – Beg Your Pardon – Piano brings in a fast paced, jazzy tune. There are also fiddles? I wonder whether this will be an instrumental. It’s certainly acting like it will. I like the piano work here, and the violins (fiddles?) provide an interesting contrast. OK, pretty sure it’s instrumental because theres’ only 20 seconds left and still no voices. Yes it was. <3. White male artist.\n\nSpike Jones – William Tell Overture – Oh, boy. I love Spike Jones…. It starts out as a cacophony. Then a gunshot and it starts back to the idyllic opening of the WTO. Then it goes into a cowbell and car-horn interpretation. Now we have gargling singing. On to the fast, cavalry part of the tune. Now we have a horse race announcer introducing a horse race…. We’re going to get a whole imaginary horse race. OK. All set to the WTO. I can’t imagine this on the radio, it’s so absurd. That’s why I love Spike Jones. Who wins???? Beetlebaum? <3. White male artist.\n\nTommy Dorsey – Until – YouTube to the rescue. It sounds like an archetypal slow, jazzy big band tune. It has a unison chorus singing about all the things that have to happen before a love better than you will arrive… Now we get a lead male singer crooning through the lyrics. It’s OK, but not great. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – Serenade Of The Bells – Second cover of this tune this year…. YouTube to the rescue. It sounds very much like the Jo Stafford version, but with a male vocalist. Not to my taste. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – Because – Swelling strings set a sentimental scene. Ugh. Now we get Perry crooning out the lyrics: Becauuuuuse… Hoooold my haaaand. Not for me, this song is. White male artist.\n\nElla Fitzgerald – My Happiness – Doo-doo chorus starts us out, and then we get Ella’s great voice. She wants to be with you at the end of her long days. You’re her happiness. It’s a very well performed song, and I think it a cappella! <3. Black female artist.\n\nArthur Godfrey – Too Fat Polka – This song was gross in 1947 and I refuse to listen to it again. White male artist.\n\nArt Mooney – Baby Face – YouTube to the rescue. This sounds familiar. It’s another band-sounding tune with a big unison chorus singing the lyrics. That seems to be a trend for 1948. This song isn’t great, and I can understand why it’s not on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nPeggy Lee – Golden Earrings – Charted at #46 in 1947 and in 1946. I gave it a heart the first time… so <3 this time too, I guess. White female artist.\n\nDinah Shore – Buttons & Bows – Starts out with a western/country feel. It’s a jaunty little town about a country gal who wants to go to the big city and stand out in buttons and bows. It’s pretty good, and Dinah has a great voice, so I’ll give it a <3. White female artist.\n\nThe Andrews Sisters – Toolie Oolie Doolie – Subtitled the Yodel Polka, this one promises to be entertaining. Accordion features prominently. Then we get the AS signing about a poor Swiss boy who has to sing “toolie oolie doolie” to charm a Swiss miss. Apparently yodeling is the way to a Swiss miss’s heart beneath the Alpine moon. I’ll <3 it because I just <3 the Andrews Sisters. White female artists.\n\nKen Griffin – You Can’t Be True, Dear – Electric organ starts us out with a carousel tune! Interesting choice for an infidelity song. It’s really oom-pah-ing along here. For a long time. Like 40 seconds. This may be an instrumental. Can you imagine this coming on the car radio in the Hot Pop songs show? It is, indeed an electric organ instrumental. Wow. (no from my son!) <3 for the oddity of it all. My son hates the organ and would downvote this song if he could, but he doesn’t get a vote. He’ll have to make his own blog. White male artist.\n\nFrancis Craig – Beg Your Pardon – YouTube to the rescue. This one starts out with very expressive piano. I think this may be another instrumental. It’s a more conventional pop piece, played on the piano, in contrast with the organ. Oh, wait, there is a male vocalist after 1:10. Wow, that’s a long intro, which is a throwback to the early 40s. It’s good, in a jazzy, non-crooning way. I would <3 it if it were on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nGracie Fields – Now Is The Hour – Weepy strings start us out, making an airy feel. Then Gracie sings, with a high-pitched, kind of weepy voice. She’s got to say goodbye now. She’ll be sailing across the sea, apparently. It’s not a compelling song for me. White female artist.\n\nDoris Day and Buddy Clark – Love Somebody – Light, happy intro with guitar and big band sound. Doris Day has a great voice. She loves somebody but won’t say who. She then goes on to describe him… Then Buddy Clark sings the same verse but from the male perspective. It paints a picture of two people in love who haven’t told one another yet. It’s a nice, happy song. <3. White male and female artists.\n\nKay Kyser – Woody Woodpecker – Well-orchestrated, using the full big-band, as Kay Kyser does. It’s great, and I loved Woody Woodpecker cartoons when I was growing up, so this hits my nostalgia spot, too. It’s better than the Sportsmen version, so I approve of its higher ranking. <3. White male artist.\n\nThe King Cole Trio – Nature Boy – Big French Horn opening sets an epic scene, complete with flighty flutes. Then Nat King Cole comes in with his beautiful voice, and it really doesn’t matter what the rest of the arrangement is. The ultimate message is that love is the most important thing in life, and that message is delivered beautifully. <3. Black Male artists.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Ballerina – This is a throwback to 1947, where it charted at #11. It must have had some sticking power. I don’t understand it: I don’t like this song. White male artist.\n\nGordon Jenkins – Maybe You’ll Be There – YouTube to the rescue. Big chorus in harmony to open, singing a sad song, I think? It sounds like the lyrics are asking whether the lover will let it end like this after all of their promises. Then a male vocalist sings about his sad, lonely walks. It’s really not for me: it’s a maudlin song and not musically interesting. White male artist.\n\nDoris Day – It’s Magic – Big strings open to paint a sentimental picture. Doris has a great voice, but the song is so sappy I don’t think she can save it. This really reminds me of “Que Sera Sera”, but without the emotional oomph of that song. Oh, wait! This is a song that Bugs Bunny is always singing while he’s bathing in the Looney Tunes cartoons! How about that. He sings it better, I think. White female artist.\n\nArt Mooney – I’m Looking Over A Four Leaf Clover – YouTube to the rescue. This is a slightly better version of the song than the Morgan and Herth version. It still has the big unison chorus, but the instruments are down-homey, like a banjo and a glockenspiel, I think. It’s OK, and for the sentimental reasons I outlined above I would <3 it if it were on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nThe Pied Pipers – My Happiness – How can this chart higher than Ella Fitzgerald’s cover? It’s only OK, and her cover was *amazing*. Even so, I’ll give this quaint, happy song a <3. White male and female artists.\n\nAl Trace – You Call Everybody Darlin’ – YouTube to the rescue, again. Nice, fast-paced walking beat. It’s really more of a locomotive beat. It’s a song about a woman who is playing the field and the singer is admonishing her that she won’t ever find true love because she’s not focusing her affections. It’s a theme that makes its way into songs even today. If it were on Spotify, I would <3 this song.\n\nDick Haymes – Little White Lies – Harp strums to open, then a big harmony from a big chorus. I’m about done with this song after 20 seconds. It’s sappy, and it has a doo-doot chorus. So sappy. White male artist.\n\nKen Griffin and Jerry Wayne – You Can’t Be True, Dear – I think this is a different version of the one I covered above, but I can’t find it. I’ll <3 it on principle. White male artists.\n\nJon and Sondra Steele – My Happiness – YouTube to the rescue. Tinkly piano starts us out, then we get a more archetypal reedy female jazz voice. I can hear a male voice there, too, but the mix is focused on the woman’s sound. It’s OK, but really, not as good as the Ella Fitzgerald version. I would give it a <3 if it were on Spotify. White male and female artists.\n\nMargaret Whiting – A Tree In The Meadow – Woodwinds set up a pastoral scene. Then we get Margaret Whiting singing about that pastoral scene. Apparently, someone has carved a love message onto the tree… “I love you til I die”. I get the feeling that won’t hold to the end of the song. In fact, it only makes it two verses in, before he’s untrue. So sad. It’s a pretty well put-together tune, so I’ll <3 it. Maybe I’m happy just because it’s not crooning…. White female artist.\n\nBing Crosby – Now Is The Hour – This one is subtitled “Maori Farewell Song”. That could be good or bad… Piano and an “oooh” chorus start us out. Then Bing comes in with his velvety tones. He’s singing a goodbye song (unsurprising, given the title). He’s bidding farewell to a person who is going across the sea. It’s not crooning, exactly, though those vowels are hit pretty hard. It sounds like holiday music to my ears because that’s where so much of this sort of music has been pigeonholed in our modern musical landscape. I’ll <3 it. No clear mention of the Maori, so it seems to have avoided any overt racism. White male artist.\n\nPeggy Lee – Manana – Oh, man, this song is clearly a Carnival song. It’s got the Latin beat and hits you over the head with it. Peggy Lee is singing with a Latina accent, too. It’s a catchy song and I like it. It’s a song about putting things off, and I can’t complain about that. <3. White female artist.\n\nPee Wee Hunt – Twelfth Street Rag – Rag suggests a piano tune! It’s a New Orleans Jazz Band tune! It’s great! I love it and it’s the best song this year, by far! <3 <3 <3. White male artist.\n\nI’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946.\n\nThe seventh year of my run through the history of pop music, 1947, is really at the beginning of the Cold War. We get a top 47 songs this year.\n\nAs I wrote in 1946, the period between WW2 and the Doo-wop era of the 1950s gets very little coverage in US popular culture, so I’m interested in building my knowledge of both the music and the evolution of US politics and culture through this time. Here are some contextual details:\n\nThe top grossing movie in 1947 was Welcome Stranger ($6.1M), where Bing Crosby plays a young singing doctor who fills in for a country doctor who’s on vacation. Gentleman’s Agreement, a film about anti-Semitism in New York, won the Best Picture Oscar for the year. 1947 saw the murder of the Black Dahlia, the first animals in space (fruit flies), the demonstration of the first Polaroid instant camera, Jackie Robinson sign with the Dodgers, the first Tony Awards, the “Cold War” mentioned for the first time, an extremely destructive earthquake and tsunami in Alaska, Truman begin the “Truman Doctrine” of containing communism, the Marshall Plan begin to rebuild Europe, the first UFO sightings, the Roswell Incident, the CIA officially formed, the US split Plutonium (opening the way for nuclear power generation), the Air Force become a separate branch of the military, the House Un-American Activities Committee begin its investigations into communism in Hollywood, the World Series first broadcast on TV, Chuck Yeager brake the sound barrier, the Spruce Goose fly its only flight, and the first electronic transistor demonstrated. The Baby Boom had started the year before, but I’m not sure how much people realized its significance yet.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population, but I include the genders of all folks in the named artist on the track, so women could be on 100% of the tracks if all the named artists included both men and women. That hasn’t been the case at all so far: men dominate the charts. Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940s, you would expect about five of the top 47 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1946 chart was dominated by Vaughn Monroe, with four of the 47 tunes, followed by Eddy Howard with three. There were 26 artists with only one tune in the top 47, so it was pretty even.\n\nBlack artists were 4 of the 35 artists on the 1947 charts, so 11%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on 4 out of 47, so 9%. The expected rate for the 1940s would be 10%, so Black artists are represented about as expected in tracks. Compare that track percentage to 1941-46: 8, 5, 20, 28, 18, and 8%. It looks like Black artists got a big boost during the war and returned to expected representation afterwards.\n\nThere are no Latinx artist(s) on the 1947 charts (0%), and Latinx folks were about 1.5% of the US at the time, so they’re underrepresented on the charts.\n\nWomen are in 7 of the 35 named artists (20%), and 7 of the 47 tracks (15%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. Compare these numbers to 1941-46: 9, 12, 15, 38, 18, 21%. Women have a big bump in 1944, which could be because of the war, or it could be related to the musicians’ strike.\n\nNotable songs include: #38 Feudin’ and Fightin’, #33 Civilization Bongo Bongo Bongo, #26 I Love You for Sentimental Reasons, #14 Chi-Baba Chi-Baba, and #2 Peg O’ My Heart. My favorite is #5 Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette) by Tex Williams. I gave 27 of 47 (57%) a <3 this year. Compare that to 46% in 1946, 65% in 1945, 60% in 1944, 63% in 1943, 45% in 1942, and 41% in 1941. It ticked back up this year; we’ll see if that trend continues (I really like 1950s music, and I’m waiting for that sound to show up).\n\nTwo interesting trends this year:\n\nTwo of the top 7 songs (#2 and #7) are instrumental covers of “Peg O’ My Heart”, but they’re both strange: one is an electric guitar/accordian duo, and the other is a harmonica trio. America is trying to find its new sound after the war and we’re getting some strange experiments.\n\nThere are two songs, #24 “Huggin’ and Chalkin’” and #21 “Too Fat Polka”, that are novelty songs that rely on body-shaming large-bodied women in a way that I find pretty gross. I wonder what it was about 1947 that led to those two being popular.\n\nThe 1947 Charts:\n\nKay Kyser – Ole Buttermilk Sky – I gave this one a heart when it was on the 1946 chart. White Male artist.\n\nPeggy Lee – Golden Earrings – I also gave this one a heart when it was on the 1946 chart. The first four of these tunes are the same as in 1946, so either they were sticking around or something is fishy in my source for charts. I should go find the old Billboards in the university online archives and look… White female artist.\n\nEddy Howard – I Love You For Sentimental Reasons – No love from me for this one in 1946. White male artist.\n\nDusty Fletcher – Open The Door, Richard – Still good, from 1946. It got a heart. Black male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – How Soon – This one was no good in 1946 (where it was also #43!). White male artist.\n\nBing Crosby – The Whiffenpoof Song – This one was no good as #44 in 1946, and I stick by that opinion. White male artist.\n\nTex Beneke and The Glenn Miller Orchestra – Anniversary Song – Our first new song of 1947! Saxophones start us out as the big band builds to a crescendo, then swoops around setting a dramatic scene. Now into a walking beat, sounding jazzy and sophisticated. This suggests a noir cityscape and hard-boiled city people. I wonder if there will be words? Yes, after one minute. We get a male chorus singing about how you dance like the day you were wed. This is, overall a solid swing tune played well by a big band. It gets a heart. White male artist.\n\nGuy Lombardo – Managua, Nicaragua – I liked this one as #42 in 1946. White male artist.\n\nCharlie Spivak – Linda – YouTube to the rescue. Whiny trumpet sets us up with a walking beat and a big band sound, as is typical of Spivak. Crisp male vocals: he doesn’t count sheep when he goes to sleep, he counts the charms about Linda. Poor dude, Linda doesn’t know he exists. It’s an unrequited love song, I guess. It’s pretty solid, and I would give it a heart if it were on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nDorothy Shay – Feudin’ And Fightin’ – Piano and female vocals right from the start. She’s singing about the way they fight in the lands outside the city. The vocals are crisp and sound very classical, but the words are country. “Why’d they have to shoot poor grandma?” seems to be part of the refrain. It’s another song that seems to be teasing about lower class Whites’ lack of civilization. It’s pretty funny, and it’s not as offensive to me as the one from last year, “Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly”, so I’ll give it a heart. White female artist.\n\nMargaret Whiting – You Do – Strings build for a sentimental song. I’m already dreading it. “Who knows how much I love you? You dooooo.” It’s just not for me, alas. White female artist.\n\nCount Basie – Open The Door, Richard – YouTube to the rescue. Starts with the sound of people talking at a party and now goes into the familiar knocking and “OPEN THE DOOR, RICHARD!”. This is a fun song, and Count Basie and his band do a great job with it, but nothing inventive. I would give it a heart if it were on Spotify. Black male artist.\n\nArt Lund – Peg O’ My Heart – YouTube to the rescue. This is a crooning tune with the emphasis on the a’s: Peg o’ my heaaaaart. It doesn’t make me interested. White male artist.\n\nKay Kyser – The Old Lamplighter – I didn’t like this one when it was #34 in 1946, either. White male artist.\n\nAndrews Sisters and Danny Kaye – Civilization Bongo Bongo Bongo – I like these artists, but this title makes me concerned… Starts well, with a fast beat. And with a riff, I recognize this tune, I think. Or maybe the tune has been used for other lyrics? It’s about a native person who has decided that civilization isn’t for him, and is mostly a parody of American culture. So maybe it’s OK? It’s a fun tune from a musical perspective, and I’m not sure whether the punching up is enough to make up for the punching down… I’ll give it a heart. White male and female artists.\n\nMills Brothers – Across The Alley From The Alamo – Strummy guitar, then into the harmony of the four Mills Brothers. It’s about a pinto horse and a Navajo who live across the alley from the Alamo. They seem to have been squished by a train because they didn’t look before crossing the tracks. It’s a Black band, but the song is punching down at Native folks, so I’m not sure where this song falls on the social justice spectrum. Musically, it’s good, but I don’t think I can heart it. Apparently, the song became a jazz standard. Black male artists.\n\nDinah Shore – Anniversary Song – Dinah shore has a great voice, and she makes this song sound very different from the Tex Beneke swing version. This version is like a sad eastern European love song. It’s good, but not the sort of song I usually like. I’ll give it a heart because of Dinah’s voice. White female artist.\n\nBing Crosby – White Christmas – This song was #4 in 1942. I gave it a heart then, and I still love it now. White male artist.\n\nGuy Lombardo – Anniversary Song – Third cover of this tune for the year. This one sounds more like the Dinah Shore version, with that eastern European flair. It has more warbly woodwinds, I think. Oh, and a piano. It’s going for the long musical introduction, unlike the Dinah Shore version. We get male vocals after 1:30. They are not impressive. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – You Do – Big band intro builds us up to a crooner male voice. It’s still not for me. White male artist.\n\nDick Haymes – Mam’selle – Building warbly strings set us up for another sentimental tune, alas. The male vocalist is pretty good, but it’s too croony for me. White male artist.\n\nThe King Cole Trio – I Love You For Sentimental Reasons – Piano starts us out, and we get Nat King Cole’s great voice. This song is a classic and still gets lots of play today. This song was #43 in 1946, and I liked it then, too. <3. Black male artists.\n\nHoagy Carmichael – Ole Buttermilk Sky – Rollicking piano starts us out. It has a distinct country music feel. I like it. It has a fast pace and goes well, and I don’t find the “Country” style to be problematic. <3. White male artist.\n\nHoagy Carmichael – Huggin’ And Chalkin’ – Big sound starts us out, big band but country feel. It seems to be a song about loving a very large woman. He has to mark her with chalk to make sure he knows how much of her he’s loved already. Then he ran into another man hugging his way around this lady. It’s catchy and clever, but it’s also punching down at large folks. I don’t think this would fly today. Maybe it shouldn’t be surprising how much of the music from this era uses putting people down as a theme. White male artists.\n\nEddy Howard – My Adobe Hacienda – Bright opening, setting up a clear big band sound. Now we have male harmony from the chorus. It’s about how he has a touch of Mexico in his house, with little things like a orchid and the sounds of guitars. I think it’s a Latinx-positive song, but the artist is not Latinx, according to my limited research. <3. White male artist.\n\nEddy Howard – I Wonder, I Wonder, I Wonder – Slow walk pace, big band sound, muted trumpets. The feel of this song is very much like the last one, with male harmony for the main lyrical line and a big band back up sound. It seems to be a solid song, well written, well-orchestrated, well performed. <3. White male artist.\n\nArthur Godfrey – Too Fat Polka – The title immediately makes me worry. Unsurprisingly it’s not on Spotify. It’s on YouTube… It’s a story song, singing about the song. OMG. “I don’t want her, you can have her, she’s too fat for me.” Seems to be most of the song. I can’t even listen to the whole thing. What about 1947 makes it the year of making fun of overweight women? White male artist.\n\nJack Owens – How Soon – YouTube to the rescue. I didn’t like the other version. And I don’t like this version, either. It’s a croooony sooooong. Ugh. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – When You Were Sweet Sixteen – Harp sets us up for a sentimental song. I’m worried because of the title of the song… He’s singing about when he first saw the love light in her eyes, but then they drifted apart, but he still carries a torch for her. I think he’s still in love with his high school sweetheart. At least I hope he was 16 when she was. That’s not clear from the lyrics. All that’s clear is that he loves you the same as he did when you were sweet sixteen. It’s overall a crooning song and it doesn’t get my less-than-three. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – The Old Lamplighter – I didn’t like this one when it was #18 in 1946. White male artist.\n\nThe Andrews Sisters – Near You – Piano sets us up for a fast walking pace, then the Andrews sisters come in quickly. They’re singing about how they want to be near you, using a solid four beat. It’s not as urgent as their music from 1941-42, but that may reflect the national attitude in 1947. I still like it. <3. White female artists.\n\nTed Weems and Perry Como – I Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now – The title is worrisome, but maybe it’s just a falling out of love song? It has a good big band sound, with a solid four beat. The clarinet is carrying the tune through the extended introduction. We get male vocals after 1:23. It’s a solid lead with a good chorus, and not too croony. It sounds a bit old fashioned for 1947, but I like it. It is, indeed, a song about a lost love and carrying a torch. <3. White male artists.\n\nRed Ingle and Jo Stafford – Temptation (Tim-tayshun) – Starts out with a hoe-down sound, like a called square dance. It’s very country-sounding, but I like it. It has fiddles and a oom-pah beat like you might hear for a square dance. It also has an accordion and an electric guitar. And a penny whistle, apparently. It’s overall good. <3. White male and female artists.\n\nPerry Como – Chi-Baba Chi-Baba – Twinkly sounds from strings and xylophone. Perry is singing a lullaby, with a wrap-around story in the song. It’s nonsense (I think?) as an Italian lullaby. It’s catchy and not too croon-y. It transitions into a solid four section at the midpoint of the song. <3. White male artist.\n\nFreddy Martin – Managua, Nicaragua – Can this top the Guy Lombardo version? Clarinets start us out with muted trumpets, then into a piano playing the main musical theme. It’s catchy and well-played. This tune has a fast beat, like I like, and the hook is catchy, so it’s hard to dislike it, given its bones. Freddy Martin seems to be doing a good job of it. The singing is squarer and easier to understand than the Guy Lombardo version. I wonder why we get so many Latin tunes but no Latinx artists this year. Actually, I don’t wonder: that’s America. I’ll <3 this song, but not institutional racism. White male artist.\n\nArt Lund – Mam’selle – YouTube to the rescue. Strings build to paint a sentimental picture. It’s still a crooner tune, and I really don’t like it. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Ballerina – Starts with a big fanfare, then into plinky strings. The song is sung in very formal way, but the music sounds more contemporary. It’s a song about how a ballerina has to work so hard, but her love doesn’t come to see her perform. So sad: it’s because she chose art over love. It’s really not a song for me. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – That’s My Desire – YouTube to the rescue. Starts out quickly with the male vocalist singing about how he wants just one night with you, to reminisce with you. It’s a slow, sappy song with some moderate crooning. It’s really not unpredictable and I find it unexciting. White male artist.\n\nLarry Green – Near You – Can it top the Andrews Sisters version? YouTube to the rescue. Rocking piano starts us out, then is backed by strings. They set up the melody. We get a long intro on this one, over a minute, unlike the AS version. It’s not saved by the vocals: they sound trite and saccharine. Ugh. White male artist.\n\nAl Jolson – Anniversary Song – Swelling strings set a very emotional stage. Very deep male vocals. It has that eastern European sound. It’s really not as good as the Tex Beneke or Dinah Shore versions. He’s trying too hard with his basso voice to hit the notes in this tune. I’m not sure why it’s ranked so high, especially with those others. There’s no accounting for taste. White male artist.\n\nThe Three Suns – Peg O’ My Heart – Accordion and electric guitar from the start: this has a very different sound from most of the other music this year. The electric guitar is very “new” sounding compared to the other 40s music I’ve been listening to. We’re getting an extended introduction… Now we have an electric organ! I think this is the beginnings of the 1950s sound I’m used to, but with an accordion. Strange. Overall, this is a strange cover. I’m starting to think it will be an instrumental. It is! <3 for the strangeness. White male artists.\n\nVaughn Monroe – I Wish I Didn’t Love You So – Sounds very typical swing, big band sound. The singing isn’t true crooning, but is more jazzy and fun. It has male vocals leading with a male and female chorus. It’s a pretty innocuous love song, and I can <3 it. White male artist.\n\nTex Williams – Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette – Interesting… That title might not make it today, with what we know about cigarettes. Fast bass to start, and a spoken bass “singing” the song. It’s really funny: it’s about how irritating it is to wait for folks to go on a smoke break while you’re playing poker. It’s a really good song and has a fast feel more like “Hot Rod Lincoln”. I like the way its complaining about cigarettes in the context of the 1940s. I’ll <3 it. White male artist.\n\nRay Noble and Buddy Clark – Linda – I liked the Spivak cover, so maybe this one will be OK. It has a spoken-language intro of a man hitting on a woman on the street in a way that wouldn’t be OK nowadays. The song itself is solid, listing all the great things about Linda, who doesn’t notice the singer. I’ll give it a <3. White male artists.\n\nTed Weems – Heartaches – Fast strings and clarinets carrying the melody… It really has a beat and it’s building to something. Now the piano is carrying the melody over the frantic strings and drums. Now a muted trumpet has picked up the melody, after 1:00, and I am starting to think it’s an instrumental. Now we have whistling taking up the melody, but the pace is just as frantic as ever. Now it’s on to clarinets again with the muted trumpet hitting a syncopated beat and unison for all to finish. It was an instrumental. I like it and I’ll <3 it. White male artist.\n\nThe Harmonicats – Peg O’ My Heart – Another instrumental cover? It’s a novelty band that does just harmonicas… I’ve heard this before! It’s got a classic Muzak sound like you would expect in an elevator or department store… I’ll <3 it for the novelty factor. White male artists.\n\nFrancis Craig – Near You – Third cover of this song this year. There’s strong piano to start us out. The album cover suggests that piano may be the main thing here. Ok, after 1:10, we get the male vocalist and the rest of the big band coming in. It’s a great, jazzy tune with a solid four beat and bright vocals. I’ll happily <3 it. I hope we get more like this and less of the crooning as we go forward. We get a piano encore in the third part of the song. White male artist.\n\nI’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945.\n\nThe sixth year of my run through the history of pop music, 1946, is after the end of World War II. We get a top 48 songs this year.\n\nThe period between WW2 and the Doo-wop era of the 1950s gets very little coverage in US popular culture, so I’m particularly interested in building my knowledge of both the music and the evolution of US politics and culture through this time. I’ll start putting more contextual details in this header.\n\nThe top grossing movie in 1946 was The Best Years of Our Lives ($10M), about three servicemen re-adjusting to civilian life. That movie also won the Best Picture Oscar for the year. 1946 saw the introduction of the first computer (ENIAC), the start of the CIA, the first use of “Iron Curtiain”, the Philippines granted independence by the USA, publication of Dr. Spock’s book on childcare, continued nuclear testing, the founding of the Atomic Energy Commission, Yogi Berra begin his pro baseball career, Republicans win majorities in the House and Senate in the mid-term elections, the last mass lynching in the USA, and Harry Truman establishing the President’s Committee on Civil Rights.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population (although that was not the case in 1941-1945). Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940s, you would expect about five of the top 48 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1946 chart was dominated by Bing Crosby, with five of the 48 tunes, followed by Perry Como with four. There were 17 artists with only one tune in the top 48, so it’s less even this year.\n\nBlack artists were three of the 29 artists on the 1946 charts, so 10%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on four out of 48, so 8%. The expected rate for the 1940s would be 10%, so Black artists are underrepresented in tracks for the first time since 1942.\n\nThere is one Latinx artist on the 1944 charts (3%), and Latinx folks were about 1.5% of the US at the time, so they’re overrepresented on the charts. Latinx folks were on one out of the 48 tracks, so 2%.\n\nWomen are in eight of the 29 named artists (28%), and 10 of the 48 tracks (21%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. This is up from 1945.\n\nNotable songs include: #45 “Open the Door, Richard”, #28 “Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop”, #16 “To Each His Own”, and #7 “Personality”. My favorite is #13 “Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow”. I gave 22 tracks (46%) a heart this year. Compare that to 52/80 (65%) in 1945, 24/40 (60%) in 1944, 25/40 (63%) in 1943, 45/100 in 1942, and 33/80 (41%) in 1941. I think the reason why my heart percentage dropped is a movement back to pre-war style crooning, sappy love songs and a movement away from the snappy songs that got Americans through WW2.\n\nThe 1946 Charts:\n\nKay Kyser – Ol’ Buttermilk Sky – Happy, rocking beat to start us out, female vocalist going “doot doot-de-doot” then a male vocalist singing a light line. It hints at a doo-wop sound like “Mr. Sandman”, but it’s not quite there yet. I like it and I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nPeggy Lee – Golden Earrings – Strumming guitar, and Peggy Lee humming start us out, set a kind of middle eastern flavor. If I didn’t know the date of this song, I would put it in the 1960s. It is about magic golden earrings that bring you love, I think. I see: the sound of the song is supposed to invoke “Gypsy” imagery, and that links in with the magic earrings. It’s good enough for a heart. White female artist.\n\nEddy Howard – I Love You For Sentimental Reasons – Horns and saxes set us up with a lazy city sound. Eddy Howard has a very high voice, contrasting with many of the male singers of the time. This is a bit of a sappy, slow song, and it doesn’t keep my interest. White male artist.\n\nDusty Fletcher – Open The Door, Richard – This one is based on Fletcher’s long-running Vaudeville routine. It is a novelty song, and the drummer plays the role of Dusty knocking on the door. After the spoken-word intro, it goes into a male chorus singing across the saxophone. Dusty isn’t going to sing, is he? This is contrasting spoken-word across the chorus. It’s pretty good, and I recognize that beats from it have found their way into modern artists like George Thorogood’s work. The track goes on for six minutes! I’ll give it a heart. Black male artist.\n\nBing Crosby – The Whiffenpoof Song – Bing starts us out with a recitation about the Whiffenpoofs singing in a bar. Is the whole song going to be like this? It is. It’s, maybe, a comedy crooning song? I’m not connecting with it at all. Oh, it seems to be a Yale a cappella song or something. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – How Soon – Swelling strings do not bode well for this song. It wants to be “dreamy”. Yes, it is another crooner. “Hooooow sooooooon will I be seeeeing yooooou?” It’s not for me. White male artist.\n\nGuy Lombardo – Managua, Nicaragua – Bright trumpets start us out with a fast, syncopated beat. It’s a male chorus singing about how great it is to be in Managua, Nicaragua. It’s catchy. Lombardo is not Latino but is using the popularity of Latinx music to his advantage, so there’s a cultural appropriation issue. I’ll give it a heart anyway. White male artist.\n\nThe King Cole Trio – I Love You For Sentimental Reasons – Let’s see if Nat King Cole can rescue this song. Yes, he can: after only about two seconds, even. His voice is so amazing. Also, the way he’s singing this line doesn’t suffer from the typical crooning issues; I’m not sure, but he can hit those vowels in a way that’s beautiful and not grating. I’ll give it a heart. Black male artist.\n\nBing Crosby – Sioux City Sue – This is a cover of a song that charted with a different artist in 1945. I liked that one, so let’s see whether Bing can deliver. Bright, bouncing trumpets set us out on a swing track. Bing sings it well, and again it’s a “Western” song, but with a swing modality, so I like it. This is such a catchy tune. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nModernaires and Paula Kelly – To Each His Own – First of five covers of this song. It must be popular in 1946. YouTube to the rescue. Flutes and woodwinds set us up for “Dreamy”. It’s a crooning song, alas. I’m about ready to move on from this era, please. White male and female artists.\n\nJo Stafford – Symphony – I didn’t like this song when it charted in 1945, so I’m going to skip it for 1946. White female artist.\n\nPerry Como – Dig You Later A Hubba-Hubba-Hubba – I wrote a bunch about this song when it charted in 1945, and I did finally go back and heart it, despite the offhand way it mentions the fire-bombing of Tokyo. It is what it is. White male artist.\n\nAndrews Sisters and Les Paul Trio – Rumors Are Flying – Les Paul *and* the Andrews Sisters? Oh, my. Turns out that it’s pretty good, but not as good as I expected: it’s too slow, and the oom-pah of the beat isn’t inspiring. I’m hoping it will change in the second half. Now we get a guitar solo, and that’s a plus. It’s not going to change pace, alas. It’s OK, and I’ll give it a heart. White male and female artists.\n\nDick Haymes and Helen Forrest – Oh! What It Seemed To Be – Woodwinds set up for a dreamscape. It’s a crooning song, alas. I just don’t have any patience for these songs today. White male and female artists.\n\nKay Kyser – The Old Lamplighter – Oboe starts us out reedily. Then we get “doo-doots” from a female vocalist. Now a male vocalist is crooning about the lamplighter. The chorus croons along. It’s just more crooning. White male artist.\n\nFreddy Martin – Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly – Trombones wah-wah us into the song; it promises to be irreverent. Plinky strings now, contrasting with blaring trumpets. It seems to be a “Western” song making fun of uneducated rural people. I think it’s about uneducated folks having lots of sex. This cover is clearly intended to make fun of country folks. Is it also about gay sex? And arson? Honestly, this is a pretty mean song and I’m embarrassed to listen to it. White male artist.\n\nCharlie Spivak – Oh! What It Seemed To Be – Whiny, muted trumpets set us up for what I expect to be more crooning. Lots of crooning in 1946. Maybe folks wanted a return to the pre-war culture? This one is marginally better than the previous one, but I’ll still give it a pass. White male artist.\n\nBenny Goodman – Symphony – Starts out with Benny on the clarinet. Can this one be better than the Jo Stafford version? I hope so. It has that Benny Goodman sound, with a swinging beat and good mix of sections, so I’m happy so far. The vocalist is better, too. This is actually a good, jazzy, swing tune. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nLes Brown – You Won’t Be Satisfied Until You Break My Heart – Spotify makes clear that Doris Day is the singer on this track. Muted trumpets and plinky string bass start us out. Man, Doris Day has a great voice. She really carries this track. It’s a falling-out-of-love song, about how poorly she’s treated by her man; but it sounds like a sultry falling-in-love song. It’s really good, so I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nTony Martin – To Each His Own – Second of five covers. Swelling strings show this will be a maudlin tune. So it is, with Tony Martin crooning through the lyrics. Not really for me, but I can tell it’s well put together from a musical perspective. White male artist.\n\nTex Beneke and The Glenn Miller Orchestra – Hey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop – YouTube to the rescue. Starts with a fast pace, building trumpets, and it’s clearly a swinging Big Band song. It’s one that folks have heard before, but this version isn’t on Spotify. It has a feel more like a doo-wop 1950s tune, like you might expect Elvis to sing it. I would give it a heart if it were on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – They Say It’s Wonderful – Woodwinds sighing in to set us up for another sappy song. Perry Como croons in that “They say that faaaling in looove is wooonderfuuuuul…” and I’m gone. Not for me, alas. White male artist.\n\nAndy Russell – Laughing On The Outside Crying On The Inside – Strings and a waltzy-beat. Andy Russel croons along to this sad song about hiding your disappointment with lost love. Not for me, either. Latino male artist.\n\nTex Beneke and The Glenn Miller Orchestra – Five Minutes More – Bright trumpets and plinky strings set us up for another swinging Big Band tune. It’s clear that Tex is trying to pick up from where Glenn left off. He’s pretty good, too, so I’ll allow it. The singing here is less do-wop and more like classic jazz. I’ll give this swinging tune a heart. White male artist.\n\nDinah Shore – Laughing On The Outside Crying On The Inside – Can Dinah Shore save this crooning tune? It starts better, with sassy trombones and electric guitar. Dinah’s voice is mixed so that she isn’t louder than the instruments, so she almost falls into the background. She’s got better vocal quality than Perry Como, in my opinion, and the instrumentation makes this a jazzier cover. It gets into some jazzy solos in the third section. Nice. I like it and I’ll give it a heart. White female artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – The Gypsy – YouTube to the rescue. Trumpets contrasting with woodwinds set up a sense of competition. There’s not much to it, so far: we get a vocalist singing “The Gypsy” and then more instruments that sound like they’re setting up for something else. Now, after 1:20, we get a story song sung by a female vocalist. It’s a story of a fortune telling gypsy, and it’s really not compelling musically or lyrically. White male artist.\n\nDinah Shore – Doin’ What Comes Natur’lly – How will Dinah cover this irreverent song? Her strong voice makes it better, but the strong anti-rural sentiment of the song is difficult to overcome. So, while this one is musically good, I don’t like it because of the classist attitude. White female artist.\n\nBing Crosby – Symphony – Third of four covers of this song in 1946. YouTube to the rescue. Big swelling, symphonic opening. Then Bing is crooning about a “Symphooony of loooove”. This song was hard to find because searching for “Symphony” isn’t very narrowing. Too bad it suuuuucks. In my opinion. I’m sure plenty of folks like it, just not me. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – I’m A Big Girl Now – YouTube to the rescue. Big trumpets start us out and then straight into a female vocalist singing in a Jazz mode. She’s singing about how she’s breaking up with her boyfriend because he doesn’t appreciate how she’s grown up. It’s a great song, with many double entendres. I would totally heart this song if it were on Spotify. White male artist.\n\nBing Crosby and Carmen Cavallaro – I Can’t Begin To Tell You – Piano to start (Carmen C.). Then Bing croons the title as the opening line. It’s better, musically, so I can handle this crooning. It’s actually a good balance of instruments to voice, and the great piano makes it all worthwhile. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nSammy Kaye – The Old Lamplighter – I didn’t like the last cover, so let’s see whether this is less crooning. Big band swelling crescendo to open is promising… Good balance of instruments. Then we get a male vocalist, with the doo-doo chorus. In the end, it’s too slow and croon-y for me. White male artist.\n\nFreddy Martin – Symphony – The last of the four covers of this song in 1946. Trumpest with dun-dun-dun to start us out. It’s not promising. There’s a frantic violin, too. And a piano. I sounds like they have a full symphony. The long musical introduction is OK. Will there be a vocalist? The saxophone is playing the crooning voice part and it’s fine. How about that? We get the crooning male vocalist after the halfway point of the track… And that ruins it (for me). White male artist.\n\nThe Ink Spots – To Each His Own – Third of five covers. I love the Ink Spots. This one starts out with tinkly piano and strumming guitar, then in to crisp male vocals. I can hear the chorus humming along, but they blend in well: the track mixing is very good here, too. This is how to do a crooning song and make it sound good, to my ears. Nice spoken word bridge, too. I’ll gladly give it a heart. Black male artists.\n\nKay Kyser – Ol’ Buttermilk Sky – This one seems to be on the chart twice. Maybe a single and an album version? I gave it a heart before. White male artist.\n\nFreddy Martin – To Each His Own – Fourth of five covers. Whiny violins set the melody at the outset. Then we get a saxophone playing the melody. This goes on for some time, swelling to meet the vocalist who then croooons through the rest of the song. White male artist.\n\nVaughn Monroe – Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow – This is one of those songs that’s familiar to us today. This version is great, with quality vocals and a good balance of the big band. This song seems to be a consent-recognizing version of “Baby it’s cold outside” and that earns it points, too. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nBetty Hutton – Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief – I’m worried about this song, given the title… This is a jazzy, swingy big band tune. Apparently the Doctor, Lawyer, and Indian Chief cannot love you more than I do… It does eventually get to stereotyping the Indian Chief, making fun of Native culture, alas. Otherwise, it’s a pretty good tune with a fast beat and good musicality. White female artist.\n\nPerry Como – Surrender – Swelling strings set a maudlin scene. Then Perry comes in with his silky vocals, crooning about how he wants you to surrender to his overtures of love. It’s one of those songs, trying to wear down the resistant woman. Plus crooning. Not for me. White male artist.\n\nFrank Sinatra – Oh! What It Seemed To Be – After the last two covers, I expect crooning. Swelling strings foreshadow more crooning. Frank has a great voice, so it makes this cover marginally more palatable, but it’s still not to my liking. White male artist.\n\nDinah Shore – The Gypsy – 2/3 covers… Dinah has a great voice, and she carries this song better than the Sammy Kaye version. It’s still not really a song for me, but it definitely has a sound that feels more 1950s than 1940s to my modern ear. White female artist.\n\nBing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters – South America, Take It Away – Worried about the title. The Atom Bomb is used as a characteristic of the USA (along with baseball, etc.) in setting up a contrast with South America. It’s a song reflecting on the popularity of Latin music at the time, essentially using a Latin beat to ask for the Latin folks to take it all back. It’s musically a good song, and I’m unsure about the cultural appropriation aspect, as they seem to be saying that the Latin music is too rocking for USA folks to handle… I’ll give it a heart. White male and female artists.\n\nJohnny Mercer – Personality – I think I know this song as one of the standards that has made it to me in 2020…. Saxophones set us up with a train-track beat. Yes, it is the song I recognized. It’s great, and that’s why it’s known today. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nFrankie Carle – Oh! What It Seemed To Be – Clarinet-heavy intro, with some spoken-word radio introductions. Now, after a whole minute, we get into the song itself. It’s that same song, that I’ve heard three times before this “year”. It has a female vocalist who’s doing an OK job with this song, but it’s just not one I like. White male artist.\n\nFrankie Carle – Rumors Are Flying – This sounds like so many of the crooning songs this year. It’s not as good as the Andrews Sisters and Les Paul version that I liked. The vocals are pretty good, though, and to be fair, it’s not actually a crooning song. There’s a female vocalist, and she has a solid sound. It’s a bit slow for me, and without Les Paul it’s not worth coming back to. White male artist.\n\nFrank Sinatra – Five Minutes More – Glockinspiel to open us up and then straight to Frank’s vocals. It’s a pretty swinging song, letting Frank show off his voice without slipping into crooning. I’ll give it a heart, even though it’s not as good as the Glenn Miller Orchestra version. White male artist.\n\nThe Ink Spots – The Gypsy – Characteristic plinky piano and guitar, with crisp male vocals that I love from the Ink Spots. This is the only version of the three this “year” I will give a heart to. I just love everything the Ink Spots do, even if there is a formula (there is a spoken word bridge here, too). If you do your formula well, it’s still good. Black male artists.\n\nEddy Howard – To Each His Own – Last of five covers. This song sort of embodies 1946. Clarinets feature strongly in the intro. It sounds kind of Benny Goodman-like. The vocalist has a crisp sound, with this otherwise croon-y song. This is my favorite of these five covers, and I’ll give it a heart. I didn’t think this song could be saved, but this cover does it. White male artist.\n\nPerry Como – Prisoner Of Love – Strings and harp set a sweet and sentimental stage, swelling to Perry’s vocals coming in. It’s a crooning song. 1946 is a year of resurgence of crooning songs, with less of the avant garde jazz, apparently. This song doesn’t move me. White male artist.\n\nI’m a paleontologist listening to all the Billboard top 100s so I can learn something about popular music and history. Here are my previous years : 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944.\n\nThe fifth year of my run through the history of pop music, 1945, is after the recovery from the musicians strike that ran from August 1942 to 1944. We get a top 80 songs this year. Some of my reading suggests we’ll get our first taste of BeBop in 1945. 1945 was, of course, the year we ended WW2 with the Atom Bomb, so that may make its way into the charts this year, but I expect more in 1946. The top grossing movie in 1945 was The Bells of St. Mary’s ($8M) and the Best Picture Oscar went to Going My Way. Both movies starred Bing Crosby playing the same character: a charismatic, singing Catholic priest. FDR passed away and Truman took over as President; it was his call to drop the bomb.\n\nAs I go through the songs each year, I note the race and gender of the artists, so I can track how representation changes over the years. You might expect 50% of tunes to be performed by women if they were a random sample of the population (although that was not the case in 1941-1944). Based on the racial mix of the USA in the 1940s, you would expect about eight of the top 80 tunes to be by a Black artist or artists and maybe one or two by another non-White racial group. Similarly, you would expect one or two songs by Latinx artists.\n\nAs before, I’m going to go through the songs in reverse order so I can count down to the big hits.\n\nTL;DR notes:\n\nThe 1945 chart was dominated by Frank Sinatra, with seven of the 80 tunes, followed by Bing Crosby and Dick Haymes with five, and Perry Como with four. Bing shares a credit for three other tunes. There were 38 artists with only one tune in the top 80, so it’s more even this year.\n\nBlack artists were 13 of the 53 artists on the 1945 charts, so 25%. When you go by tracks, Black folks are on 14 out of 80, so 18%. The expected rate for the 1940s would be 10%, so Black artists are overrepresented again. It will be interesting to see whether this holds true or whether there is a backlash in the postwar period. I hope not, but this is America, after all.\n\nThere are 6 Latinx artists on the 1944 charts (11%), and Latinx folks were about 1.5% of the US at the time, so they’re overrepresented on the charts. Latinx folks were on 6 out of the 80 tracks, so 8%.\n\nWomen are in 12 of the 53 named artists (23%), and 14 of the 80 tracks (18%). You would, of course, expect them to be in half of the groups on average (maybe more: no reason you couldn’t have all the groups have men and women, after all), so women are underrepresented. This is a drop from 1944, returning to levels more like 1943 and before.\n\nNotable songs include: #80 “Salt Peanuts”, #44 “Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well”, #17 “Caledonia”, #8 “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive”. My favorite is #1 “Rum and Coca Cola”, but it’s a bit controversial in the modern context. I gave 52 (65%) tracks a heart this year. Compare that to 24/40 (60%) in 1944, 25/40 (63%) in 1943, 45/100 in 1942, and 33/80 (41%) in 1941. Overall my appreciation of this music is trending upwards. It could be that it’s moving towards my ideal, or it could be that I’m getting accustomed to it.\n\nThe 1945 Charts:\n\nDizzy Gillespie – Salt Peanuts – Rolling on the hi-hat leads into trumpets playing a fast jazz tune. It’s sparsely instrumented, but catchy, with bass, piano, trumpet, and drums. Every now and then the trumpet drops out so someone can say “Salt peanuts salt peanuts!”. It’s, maybe, avant garde? Could it be Bebop? Wikipedia suggests it could be. I’ve discovered a new genre of music! I look forward to hearing my first Doo-Wop tune, and Rock n’ Roll, etc. This is fun. I like this tune, so it gets a heart. Black male artist.\n\nGilberto Alves – Prece a Lua – YouTube to the rescue. A sad clarinet starts us out. Then we get singing in Portuguese? It feels like a sad song, at the beginning, but it has a pretty typical Big Band slow song sound, except not in English. It’s not the sort of song that’s my favorite, but it’s good. Latino male artist.\n\nBetty Grable – I Can’t Begin to Tell You – Sad strings to begin, then straight into Betty’s vocals. No long intro here. It’s not exciting: it’s mostly a way to feature Betty’s velvety vocals. In the second half we get a wah-wah muted trumpet playing the melody. White female artist.\n\nJohnny Long – My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time – YouTube to the rescue. It starts out with a kind of tootly sound on the clarinets, backed by muted trumpets and trombones. I think I recognize this song from another cover of it. We have a long, 45 second intro, then into the vocalist, who sounds very thin and old-fashioned. I get the feeling that in 1945 there was a battle between newer, jazzier stuff and the stodgy older stuff from the swing era. Near the end we have a woman vocalist singing the main line, with a male chorus. Now we’re getting call-and-response between the male and female leads. White male artist.\n\nHal McIntyre & his Orchestra – Sentimental Journey – YouTube to the rescue again. This one starts out with sassy woodwinds, punctuated by muted trumpets. It’s growing in volume and complexity, adding sections to the band. Now we’re 1:20 in and still no vocals. Will it be an instrumental? It’s just not exciting. How did this chart above Salt Peanuts? White male artist.\n\nWoody Herman – Caledonia – Starts big, fast, and loud. It’s got the whole Big Band involved, but the clarinet is the lead, BeBopping through the song. I’ve heard other versions of this song as a Blues tune, but this is a fast, Jazz version. Wikipedia has a bunch about it in its Woody Herman bio. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nCarmen Cavallaro – Chopin’s Polonaise – Piano starts us out. I think this is just a straight up classical music piece that charted in 1945. It has an orchestra with the piano. It’s really good (Chopin is good, you know), but I’m surprised. I don’t think classical music ever charts on the pop charts nowadays. I’ll give it a heart. Latino male artist.\n\nHarry James and Kitty Kallen – I’ll Buy That Dream – YouTube to the Rescue. Starts big with the trumpet. Then into a swinging, slow tune with the trumpet as the featured instrument (hardly surprising given that Harry James is a trumpet player). It swings along for some time. Then we get Kitty Kallen singing: her voice is great, and from YouTube we can see that she’s credited on the album, so I’ll add her here. Her voice makes the tune. I would give it a heart if it were on Spotify. White male and female artists.\n\nPerry Como – Dig You Later (A-hubba Hubba Hubba) – Big, trumpety intro, leads into a male chorus starting the tune out, then a female vocalist call-and-response with Perry Como. The song seems to be about the firebombing of Tokyo: it’s a very happy, light song for such a somber subject. I can understand why they would have that attitude in 1945, but the song hasn’t aged well. It has a good beat and I like it from a musical perspective, but I don’t think I can have it in my Spotify playlist, because it’s just too shocking. White male artist.\n\nDick Haymes – Till The End of Time – Strings swoop along to introduce a crooning male singer who sings about how he’s not aloooone in the niiiiiight because he remembers you. It’s really not for me. White male artist.\n\nGuy Lombardo – Bell Bottom Trousers – Starts out with a nautical theme, and I think I can see where this one is going. The trumpets are bright and carry the tune into the vocals that start at 30 seconds. It’s about a woman who is in love with a sailor who wears bell bottom trousers, which were the standard uniform for sailors back in the day. I think it was to make it easier to kick off their boots if they fell in the drink. This song is cute, simple, and has a happy bright sound, so I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nPhil Moore Four – My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time – YouTube to the rescue again. This is the second cover of this tune, and I didn’t like the first… This one starts out more jazzy and gets to the vocalist soon. It’s a better version. It’s got a fast walking beat and it’s really not a crooner song: the singing is precise and doesn’t dwell on the vowels. I detect some electric guitar in the sparse intstumentals. I would give it a heart if it were on Spotify. Black male artists.\n\nFrank Sinatra – You’ll Never Walk Alone – Is this a response to the 1944 Dinah Shore hit I’ll Walk Alone? It has tinkly piano to start, then into very soft Sinatra vocals… I just realized that this is the song that Eddie the Shipboard Computer sings in the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy when he thinks the Heart of Gold will be destroyed. It’s strange what we have a memory for: I remember this song from the written page, not from hearing it sung. It was used ironically there, and I do not have any love for it, despite this bit of pop cultural connection. White male artist.\n\nCyro Monteiro – Boogie-Woogie na Favela – YouTube to the rescue. It has a great boogie woogie beat from the outset, but who’s surprised? Also, it’s in Portugese, but that’s not surprising. It has scat-jazz and BeBop elements, but it sounds clearly Bossa Nova. I like it and would give it a heart were it on Spotify. Latino artist.\n\nColeman Hawkins – Rifftide – YouTube to the rescue. This is another fast jazz tune, and probably BeBop. It’s great, and I wish it were on Spotify. It’s got great work between the trumpet, sax, and piano. I would give it a heart. Black male artist.\n\nBing Crosby & The Andrews Sisters – Along the Navajo Trail – Raunchy sax to start, then straight into Bing Crosby’s vocals. It’s technically a Western song, but it’s really a big band arrangement and performance here. The Andrews Sisters are great, too. It has a real Western feel overprinted on the big band sound, with the horse-walking da-dum da-dum beat. I’ll give it a heart. White male and female artists.\n\nEddie Heywood – Begin the Beguine – We played this in High School band, but I have no memory of the tune besides the title. Bright trumpets to start us, with piano trading off and taking the lead. It’s great, complex, and has wonderful, technical play by the musicians. It’s mostly a the piano and trumpets, in the end. I’ll give it a heart. Black male artist.\n\nSpike Jones – Holiday for strings – Will this be a joke song? Spike Jones is notorious for his humorous compositions. It starts out with stabby trumpets and segues into plinky harp. Now it has someone playing the cowbells, quite jarring. And wah-wah trombone, and it’s definitely a joke song. It’s catchy. It has cranks, gunshots, all the percussion. Honking horns now, and jangly bells. I like it. Now it has a clucking chicken! Then on to laughing voices taking the melody. It’s getting surreal. I’ll give it a heart. White male artist.\n\nDick Haymes – The More I See You – Piano starts, then straight into male vocalist, crooning along. It’s a love song about how happy he is to see you. Now the sentimental strings come in, but the focus is really on the vocals. It’s not for me. White male artist.\n\nThe Mills Brothers – I Wish – Spare guitar then straight into four-part harmony. It’s a beautiful, spare sound, as the main singer wishes that you were the shadow who walks with him in the park, and lots of other similes. It picks up in the second section, to a fast walking beat. It’s going back through the same lyrics but at 1.5 the time from the first section, as seems to be typical of these sorts of four-part harmony tunes. Now in the third section, they sing the lyrics in harmony across all the voices, then come back to one voice just before the full harmony for the finale. I’ll give it a heart. Black male a"
