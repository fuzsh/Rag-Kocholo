        "text": "NORMAN CANDLER AND HIS MAGIC STRINGS Try A Little TendernessDon’t Cry For Me Argentina; Chanson D’Amour; A Sentimental Moment; Another Suitcase In Another Hall; Nancy (With The Laughing Face); Feelings, etc… Candler By CandlelightCandlelight Waltz; Petite Fleur; Spanish Harlem; With A Song In My Heart; The Way We Were, etc… 28 tracks. Vocalion CDLK4430 [78:44]. The name ‘Norman Candler’ hides the true identity of Gerhard Narholz, born in Vöcklabruch, Austria, on 6 June 1937. A classically trained composer, arranger and conductor, Narholz has also used the pseudonyms Otto Sieben, Sammy Burdson, Jurgen Jänner, Walt Rockman, Mac Prindy, John Epping, Jim Harbourg, Renato Pegado and Tony Tape for various aspects of his wide-ranging musical interests. In real life this charming, modest and talented musician is also a successful businessman. In 1965 Gerhard and his wife Rotheide founded the Sonoton Recorded Music Library [now based in Munich, Germany] which supplies music for professional users in films, documentaries, radio and television. Its sister label is Intersound, which was immediately successful upon its launch with recordings by Horst Jankowski, to be followed later by top international conductors including Billy May, Nelson Riddle and Franck Pourcel. Sonoton has grown into the largest independent production music company in the world. During the 1970s Gerhard made around 20 LPs as ‘Norman Candler’, specialising in gently rhythmic treatments of songs that were popular at the time. He also proved his ability to write appealing melodies, and his own works: A Sentimental Moment, The Other Way, Soft And Tender and Days Of No Return fit comfortably alongside some of the better known numbers. Special mention must be made of the great Richard Rodgers classic With A Song In My Heart. It is not surprising to find a superb arrangement by the English composer, arranger and conductor John Fox [b. 1924] included on a Norman Candler album. For many years, right up to the present time, John has been a major contributor to Narholz’s Sonoton library, creating a wide range of orchestral colours which have been widely accepted by the entertainment profession around the world. He is warmly remembered in Britain for his many broadcasts conducting the BBC Radio Orchestra during its glory years of the 1970s and 1980s. The John Fox Strings were regularly heard on Radio 2, and in concerts John often included a choir together with his glamorous singer Joy Devon. He was also welcome in Europe, notably conducting radio orchestras in Germany, and his \"Easy Listening\" recordings have gained him many new friends in the USA, partly through new internet radio stations specialising in this repertoire. During his mature years John Fox has devoted much of his time to composing a succession of charming orchestral miniatures, often extolling the virtues of the English countryside, especially his beloved Surrey. Fortunately for his many admirers a good number of his works are available on compact discs. In this collection we can admire John’s mastery of the orchestra with his sometimes dramatic treatment of the Richard Rodgers classic With A Song In My Heart. His score is full of interesting diversions which he weaves like the intricate patterns in a mosaic, with the added touch of a discrete, yet effective, wordless chorale. Few arrangers can match his command of the full resources of a modern concert orchestra with such appealing results. This CD is a pleasant reminder of the kind of music that was so prevalent in the 1970s – undemanding yet enjoyable, and perfectly suited as background to gentle pursuits where the attention can be happily allowed to wander. David Ades\n\nTHE COMPOSER CONDUCTS VOL.1 for track listing see Light Music pages on this website. Alternatively visit www.guildmusic.com. Guild GLCD5177 [79:05] As compiler David Ades says at the start of his notes you would expect the ensuing music to be as the composer intended seeing as he or she was on the podium and Ron Goodwin is no exception as it is he and the Concert Orchestra who open the proceedings with his Jet Journey, a scintillating start to the programme. Courses de Toros (Bullfights) by Gerard Calvi is as the title suggests a musical depiction of the Spanish appetite for blood letting, [no way can it be called a sport unless the enraged and injured bull can get its horns into its tormentor] but Gerard Calvi really brings the atmosphere of the arena to life. I’ve got a couple of Spanish CDs which include \"bull-baiting\" music and the engineers have mixed the cheers and clapping of the watching mob…mercifully that doesn’t happen on the Calvi Recording. Two library pieces follow, Angela Morley’s Fun in the Sun from Chappell, a typical lighthearted newsreel and documentary accompaniment, then Cedric Dumont’s more romantic Les Parfums de Paris played by the New Concert Orchestra though I suppose it’s his own Orchestra in Basle. Woolf Phillips’ Parisian Mode on track five, used by BBC Television as signature tune to the panel game ‘What’s My Line’ was originally on a Columbia disc but it sounds tailor made for inclusion in a Mood Music publisher’s catalogue. Was it ever? I don’t know but I’m sure David does [Editor – I have never seen it anywhere else]. Listening to Rudolf Friml’s Puppets on Parade made me wonder why he called it that….it’s a lively catchy number with strains of \"city mobility\" type music from a mood catalogue…nothing of an eccentric nature you might have expected from the title and an excellent recording by the 101 Strings conducted by Friml. Bad Timing on track eleven is definitely NOT my idea of light music and it comes from something called ‘Billion Dollar Baby’, a Broadway show co-written by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Set in the prohibition era on Staten Island and in Atlantic City the score was written by Morton Gould. It opened in 1945 and ran for 220 performances. Not my cup of tea but maybe the rest of the music is more tuneful. More to my taste are the tunes of Roger Roger and one of them, Along the Avenue from the Chappell library is included here plus a couple of very cheerful and catchy numbers, Montana Round-Up by Kermit and Walter Leslie and Raymond Scott’sHuckleberry Duck. Neiani by Axel Stordahl, like Bad Timing is another piece that wouldn’t find shelf room in my CD collection. David says in the booklet notes that Stordahl realised that his style was more suited to slow sentimental ballads. If this one is anything to go by they’d be eminently suitable for putting people to sleep. However, things started looking up when André Popp and his Orchestra burst upon the scene with his lively and tuneful novelty La Bardinetta quickly followed by the sound of coconut shells and starting pistol introducing Percy Faith’s Fiddle Derby. And another track to keep one alert is Frank Perkins’ Fandango, guaranteed to keep the feet tapping. Now we dip once more into the world of newsreels, Pathe, Gaumont British, Movietone and other users of vintage background music with four tracks from Harmonic, Chappell, Boosey and Hawkes and Paxton. Sports Arena by Wilfred Burns conducting the Harmonic Orchestra, Charles Williams conducting the Queens Hall Light Orchestra in one of his best [I think] compositions Trolley Bus followed by Frederic Curzon’s Boulevardier and bringing up the rear Dolf Van Der Linden and his Metropole Orchestra with his catchy and clever Jack the Dancer…all of them just up my street. And to finish off Volume 1 of \"The Composer Conducts\" two Big Band type compositions…Blende Auf by Werner Muller conducting the RIAS Dance Orchestra and the First Movement of Otto Cesana’s Symphony in Jazz. Any listener with leanings towards Big Band music will certainly like these. Ken Wilkins\n\nTHE COMPOSER CONDUCTS VOL. 2 for track listing see Light Music pages on this website. Alternatively visit www.guildmusic.com. Guild GLCD 5178 [78:12] This is a honey of a disc, in repertoire and [with the possible exception of the Ewing selection] performances. It illustrates the fact that so many of our light music composers have been excellent conductors. Several of the 22 tracks are rousing marches: Things To Come [Bliss], the only one in stereo; State Occasion [Robert Farnon]; League of Gentlemen [Philip Green]; Salute the Soldier, not one of Eric Coates best known but thoroughly characteristic; Amethyst [Leighton Lucas] and Naval Occasion [Clifford], both suitably nautical; Sidney Torch’s busy International Sports; and March of the Bowmen, heard in abbreviated form in the Curzon selection. The Melachrino, Walter Collins, Ivor Novello and Arthur Wood items all exemplify lithe, skilful string writing [it is good to hear the Wood in its original orchestral guise, as nowadays, in my experience, it is usually heard in a brass band version]. Charles Ancliffe’s Thrillswaltz is clearly by the same composer as Nights of Gladness and Don Gilles’ Symphony for Funscherzo is worth revival. And we are reminded that the 1940s was the era of the light concerto with Peter Yorke’s Dawn Fantasy and Hubert Bath’s Cornish Rhapsody, from 1944 and stunningly played by Harriet Cohen, the equal of any performance I have heard of this popular piece. Recording dates are widely spread [1930 to 1959] and three are pre-war, but the customary Guild magic makes the best of the available sound. Generally the CD recommends itself without need for me to do so. I enjoyed it enormously, though. Philip Scowcroft\n\nThe KT Editor’s CD Choice for this issue\n\nMATTHEW CURTIS : Orchestral Works [Volume IV] Royal Ballet Sinfonia cond. Gavin Sutherland A Festival Overture; Short and Suite; On the River; Striding Edge; Variations on a Theme of Verdi; Four Winds Suite; Autumn Leaves; Sterling Silver; Summer Serenade; Christmas Rush Campion CAMEO 2085 [79:47] I was quite excited when hearing of this latest recording in Campion’s British Composer Series, having greatly enjoyed RFS member Matthew’s previous discs. The CD plopped through my letter box on Christmas Eve so I immediately went to the last track, an effervescent concert march, which Matthew says in his interesting booklet notes he wrote \"in order to fill what I saw as a vacancy in the Christmas repertoire for a light music piece capturing the spirit of anticipation unique to that season, yet avoiding overt references to carols, bells, Santa or snowfall.\" You will find out how successful he was when you hear the disc – for hear it you must. The obviously named Short and Suite and two other works on this disc were especially composed for the National Children’s Orchestra [under-13s] of Great Britain. The second of these, Striding Edge, a place well-known to Lake District climbers, is another concert march; although Matthew says that any attempt on the actual Edge at anything like the tempo of this piece would be to risk injury or worse! The 10½-minute Variations are on the chorus \"Viva Simon!\" from the original 1857 version of Verdi’s Simon Boccanegra – the 1881 revision usually heard today leaves it out. Autumn Leaves is not the familiar standard but a small orchestra elaboration of a piano piece written for Gavin Sutherland. The conductor was a member of the trio that played on the premiere performance of Summer Serenade,also performed here by a small orchestra. Another spirited item, spotlighting the whole ensemble, isSterling Silver [the longest single track at 7:59], written in 2005 to mark the 25th anniversary of the amateur West Lakeland Orchestra. With nearly 80 minutes of music this album is every bit as good as its predecessors, being chock-full of melody well played by the RBS. What a joy it is to celebrate a modern composer who can consistently write such good tunes.\n\nJIMMY DORSEY AND HIS ORCHESTRA WITH PATTI PAGE Lets Go To Town Manhattan ; That’s A Plenty; This Is My Song; Lets Fall In Love; What Can I Say After I Say I’m Sorry; Wimoweh; I Went To Your Wedding; South Rampart Street Parade; Lover; Jazz Me Blues; You Belong To Me; Just One Of Those Things; Sweet Georgia Brown; Muskrat Ramble; Hello, Good-Bye, Forget It. Sounds of Yesteryear DSOY 822 [59:20]. Four National Guard shows complete with all recruitment announcements, each with opening and closing signature tune So Rare. The Dorsey band sometimes plays Big Band, other times Dixieland. Patti Page, just starting on a solo career, is in fine voice. Paul Clatworthy\n\nBENNY GOODMAN AND HIS ORCHESTRA, QUINTET & SEXTET AFRS Shows Vol.1 Let’s Dance; Somebody Stole My Girl; On The Sunny Side Of The Street; And The Angels Sing; More Than You Know; I Got Rhythm; I Don’t Know Enough About You; Sing Sing, Sing; Let’s Dance; I Know That You Know; Ain’t Misbehavin’; My Sugar Is So Refined; Blues In The News; Dizzy Fingers; I Don’t Know Why; Oh! Baby: Somebody Stole My Girl; I Know That You Know. Armed forces radio transcriptionsSounds of Yesteryear DSOY 818 [62:37]. Digitally mastered from original discs complete with announcements interspersed with very corny comedy dialogue from Peter Donald. Martha Tilton’s fine vocal on And The angels sing tries to compete with Benny illustrating how fast he can play the clarinet, Second half has guest Johnny Mercer singing My Sugar Is So Refined and Blues In The News. Paul Clatworthy\n\nAFRS Shows Vol.2 Sounds of Yesteryear DSOY 828 [60:16]. Second volume of shows previously reviewed, this time containing twenty-six tracks in the same vein from shows three and four. Paul Clatworthy\n\nHITS OF GLENN MILLER AND TOMMY & JIMMY DORSEY IN STEREO The All-Star Alumni Band conducted by Bobby Byrne - featuring original arrangements and musicians 24 tracks incl. Tuxedo Junction; Moonlight Serenade; Little Brown Jug; Sunrise Serenade; Johnson Rag; Marie[Loren Becker, vocalist]; Boogie Woogie; Song of India; Well, Git It!; Opus No.1 … Sepia 1160[77:56] The \"big band sound\" to people below a certain age probably signifies banks of Marshall or Vox amplifiers with thousands of watts of audio, played by modern pop bands in an open field full of liquid mud in the middle of June. For those above that certain age it evokes memories of ballrooms with sprung Canadian maple dance floors, strict tempo foxtrots, waltzes and jive, accompanied by a genuine no-nonsense high quality dance band orchestra. We danced to such classics as Stardust, In The Mood and String of Pearls [all on this CD] with that special lady with that heady perfume that lingers forever. Just like the perfume our big band sound has and will endure forever. So roll back the carpet, grab \"that special lady\" and dance, because this CD is irresistible! The two dozen tracks are a good mix of all the old favourite numbers one associates with Glenn, Tommy and Jimmy but with some individual musicality on some of the tracks. That said, the fact that so many alumni musicians came together after the original bands dispersed is in itself no mean feat. Bob Eberly is the vocalist on I understand and The breeze and I, and duets with Dottie Evans on Amapola and Green Eyes. In CD format the stereo remastering and noise reduction of the original recordings is good but not exceptional, particularly the spatial separation. The standout track for me, Stardust, is extraordinary but a lot of you will have your own memories of these recordings and, maybe, that special lady. As a postscript: it is a pity that some of these timeless classics have not been used on the BBC’s ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ series. Keep on dancing! Roger Chantler\n\nTHE HOLLYWOOD FLUTE Louise Ditullio [flute] with Sinfonia Toronto conducted by Ronald Royer Suite from \"Hook\" [John Williams]; Suite from \"Dances With Wolves\" [John Barry]; Themes from \"Charlotte’s Web\" [Danny Elfman]; Theme from \"Sleeping With The Enemy\" [Jerry Goldsmith]; The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn [Laurence Rosenthal – for unaccompanied flute]; Short Stories [Ronald Royer]; Le Papillon [David Rose]; Theme from ‘Rudy’ [Jerry Goldsmith] [USA] Cambria CD-1194 [72:54]. The track that persuaded me to buy this CD was the composition by David Rose. He wrote it for Louise DiTullio, who had been a regular member of his orchestra since she was eighteen, working on TV shows such as ‘Bonanza’ and ‘Little House on the Prairie’. The piece is calledLe Papillon [the Butterfly], and it is so appropriate for the flute – describing the short life of that most beautiful of insects through its many stages. It was premiered in 1980 and thereafter Louise had the opportunity to perform the work several more times with David Rose conducting. He must have been proud of the work, because he mentioned it in correspondence with us [he was a member of the RFS] in the years before he died in 1989. It is clear that David never lost his flair for composing; it is a beautiful work, and deserves a place in every light music lover’s collection. The other tracks are almost a bonus, and they contribute magnificently to a most enchanting collection.

Bygone Days BYD77058 [77:20]. This recent release from the Delta Music Group is welcome for several reasons: first of all it is a generous helping of light music; secondly its bargain price will help to ‘spread the word’ about light music and hopefully reach some people who do not realise how enjoyable it can be; and thirdly it is simply a top quality product in all respects. Although he receives no credit, we understand that the compiler is Peter Dempsey, who has been responsible for many entertaining collections of light music in recent years. He has made a good choice, picking some comparative rarities among the familiar titles which will ensure that the collection is sufficiently attractive to ensure healthy sales. Indeed we have learned that extra copies were pressed soon after release, so let’s hope that another collection will follow soon. The comprehensive booklet notes are by Ralph Harvey, who many readers will already know from his magazine articles and the collections of continental music released by the likes of EMI and French record companies in recent years. The more CDs like this that are issued, the better it will be for light music. The hope is that any casual purchasers will be encouraged to explore the many other CDs that are currently available – not only compilations of older material, but new recordings by top orchestras and conductors. Top marks all round! David Ades\n\nMANTOVANI AND HIS ORCHESTRA Classical Encores & Christmas Album Track listing in JIM 186 Vocalion CDLK 4429 [41:24 & 42:09] We previewed this release in our last issue without any catalogue number or timings. Having now heard the 2-CD set I would include the first album with the beautiful seasonal offering as among the best Mantovani albums of all time, even if the latter does not quite give me the tingle I got from the original vinyl . Peter Burt\n\nPALM COURT LIGHT ORCHESTRA [of Canada] conducted by Charles Job Silver Jubilee Little Serenade [Ernest Tomlinson]; Dancing Stars [Herman Finck]; The Mosquito’s Parade [Howard Whitney]; Love Sends A Gift Of Roses [John Openshaw]; The Mad Major [Kenneth Alford]; A Love Long [Haydn Wood]; Side Saddle [Trevor H.

This new CD [dedicated to Ernest Tomlinson] features some of their most popular pieces, and it provides a perfect example of the kind of high quality light music of a traditional kind that is shamefully ignored by today’s broadcasters around the world. Happily we can choose to listen to CDs, rather than the radio, and this delightful collection is warmly recommended to everyone who appreciates this kind of repertoire.

Gold And Silver;Barcarolle; Theme from Romeo & Juliet; My Love Song Should Be A Waltz; Vienna, City Of Dreams; Roses From The South; Serenade; Eine Kleine Nachtmusik – Mozart Medley; O Mio Babbino Caro; Lara’s Theme; Romance:The Gadfly .... plus 28 track DVD incl. Seventy-Six Trombones; Blaze Away; Fächerpolonaise; Chianti Song; Nessum Dorma; Elyen A Magyar!; Sportpalast Waltz; The While Horse Inn; Emperor Waltz; Concerto Pour Une Voix; Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again; Botany Bay … Decca 533178 [Total running time 3:28:27] The Dutch violinist was described in The Times as \"Today’s face of classical music\" while other classical collectors are not so keen. Whatever … this album chart topping outfit has certainly achieved phenomenal success throughout the world in recent years. Mr Rieu is undoubtedly a very good musician and the orchestra play well for him. What I do not understand is why he feels the need to make his own arrangements of everything and does not sometimes leave well alone. Serenade is the beautiful Andante Cantabilefrom Haydn’s String Quartet Op.3 No.5. Moonlight Serenade itself is not played [another Decca slip-up? KT Ed.] Included in the modest price of the CD is a bonus DVD ‘Live In Australia’, which is quite something with its Rieu showmanship and razzmatazz. The enthusiasm from performers and large audience is infectious, giving the viewer a high feel good factor. Despite my initial reservations I found the music on both discs most enjoyable, although long term I shall probably prefer listening to looking. Edward Trub\n\n* Readers who enjoy the music of the Strauss Family and their contemporaries should not overlook the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Day Concert, conducted this year by Austrian-born Franz Welser-Möst, on a 2-CD Decca set 4782601 [46:18 & 54.55].\n\nTEX BENEKE AND HIS ORCHESTRA Here’s To The Ladies [Who Sang With The Band] Lillian Lane; Shirley Wilson; Claire Chatwin; Mary Mayo; Helen Lee; Eydie Gorme; Shirley Jones; Lois Lane; Barbara Edwards; Joan Cavanaugh Sounds of Yesteryear DSOY 829 [77:21] Twelve tracks with Tex’s own orchestra, eight with The Glenn Miller Orchestra and six with Ray Martin’s Orchestra, all culled from many private collections of his fans. A bouncy version of The Tunnel Of Love has Helen Lee singing with Tex himself. Dreamin’ is my business sung by Helen is a tune well worth reviving. Evidently Eydie Gorme never sang on any of Tex’s MGM recordings because of \"mike fright\". Her joyful version of Orange Coloured Sky contained here, shows no sign of fright!Paul Clatworthy\n\nPERRY COMO At the Supper Club featuring Lloyd Shafer and His Orchestra Sounds of Yesteryear DSOY 824 [74:43] Six Armed Forces radio shows, twenty-eight songs popular in 1946 with guests Nat King Cole, Spike Jones, Peggy Lee, Diana Lynn, Paula Kelly, The Modernaires and The Satisfiers. Putting this many into the programme ensures every listener gets something to enjoy. If you were a devotee of Perry’s later years on TV with the Mitchell Ayers Orchestra you will really notice the voice difference, far less intimate and relaxed. Paul Clatworthy\n\nFAIRY TALES OF IRELAND : Favourite Ballads and Folksong Arrangements Peter Dempsey [tenor], Guy Rowland [piano] 25 tracks incl. Love thee dearest; Killarney; Sweet Emerald Isle; Little Brigid Flynn; The Kerry Dance; An Irish Lullaby; Maire my girl; Open the door softly; The little shawl of blue; The Mountains o’ Mourne; The Rose of Tralee; Irish Love Song; The banks of my own lovely Lee; Duna; Shannon river; Macushla; Ireland, Mother Ireland FT1 [73:07] Peter Dempsey follows his recent CDs of Balfe, Tosti, Ketèlby, Coates and Haydn Wood with this varied selection of Irish melodies. Many are well known, though not all in these arrangements – Down by the Sally Gardens is in a Herbert Hughes’ version not Britten’s, for instance. A few are less often heard. ForThe Fairy Tales he returns to Eric Coates, while the rare but delightful My Irish daddy knows is by Haydn Wood. These are two examples of many here where the songs, music or words, emanate from Englishmen. Whatever the provenance there are considerable differences of mood. Three of my favourites are the deftly sung [and played] Kitty my love, the adorable Star of the County Down and the delicious Dublin Saunter, which seems to have stepped from a World War II musical. There is no weak link here. Mr Dempsey’s razor sharp delivery and admirably lucid diction do all songs proud and Guy Rowland’s accompaniments and two piano solos [Irish Air from County Derry and The Dear Little Shamrock] sparkle. I urge you to explore and be delighted by this disc. Available for £9.95 including p&p from Mr Dempsey at 44 Victoria Road, Bidford-on-Avon, Warwicks.

Will you remember?; Rosalie; Giannina Mia, Rose-Marie, Italian Street Song; Indian Love Call; Ah sweet mystery of life … Nelson Eddy & Gale Sherwood 12 tracks incl. Wunderbar; One night of love; If I loved you; You and the night and the music; The song is you; Just for tonight; Shall we dance? …Sepia 1161 [67:21] Former opera baritone Nelson Eddy and soprano Jeanette MacDonald in duet were one of the biggest cinema attractions in the 1930s and 1940s, stars of eight operetta films including ‘Naughty Marietta’, ‘Rose-Marie’, ‘The Girl of the Golden West’, ‘New Moon’ and ‘Bitter Sweet’. Here, in stereo recordings made in 1957/8, they sing together on disc for the first time since 1938. And pretty good they sound, too, although MacDonald has never been among my singers of choice. They duet on Will you remember?, Indian Love Call, Ah sweet mystery, and Wanting you; the remaining eights tracks being shared equally between them. MacDonald gives us a Latinate version of The Breeze and I, and closes the album with Beyond the Blue Horizon, and it is nice to hear again an old favourite, Stouthearted Men, sung by Eddy. Orchestras are conducted by Dave Rose [8 tracks] and Engel Lehman. The Canadian soprano Gale Sherwood is the least well known of the trio and was chosen by Eddy to sing with him in his night club act. The dozen enjoyable tracks here were recorded in 1960 with an orchestra conducted by Harry Sosnik. The whole disc is a nice reminder of glamorous times gone by. Ray Pavene\n\nNEW DEAL RHYTHM : Musical Cures For The Depression Blues Doug Bowles [tenor], Alex Hassan [piano] Shellwood Productions SWCD 41 [78:38] Here we have thirty songs, a majority sung by Doug Bowles to Alex Hassan’s ever lovely accompaniments, but some arranged as ebullient piano solos. They date from the America of the 1930s. Best known of them is Brother can you spare a dime? It has been said that over half the songs ever written are about love and even here we have titles like There’s no depression in love, I’m an unemployed sweetheart, Put a tax on love, My baby’s on strike and One big union for two. Bitter sweet some may be but all are entertaining, splendidly performed and excellently recorded. Recommended, though as most have a family likeness, the disc is perhaps best listened to a few tracks at a time.

Patti grew up to be the best-selling vocalist of all time. She crowned her career by winning a \"Grammy\" in 1999 at the age of 72. She was a skilled studio technician who could sing almost every kind of music. Some of the songs here beautifully arranged by Jack Rael were done again on a pure jazz album ‘Patti Page in the land of Hi-Fi’ arranged by Pete Rugolo [no doubt at her request]. The last eleven tracks are from Gordon Jenkins’ narrative tone poem Manhattan Towerarranged here by Vic Schoen and became one of her greatest successes high in the \"Billboard\" LP chart. Patti’s voice was definitely made in heaven, this issue displays it in all its glory.

Backed by orchestras led by Sy Oliver, Victor Young, Camarata, Ralph Burns and some small groups, Jeri works her magic on songs popular in the fifties, some well known others fallen by the wayside. Peter Dempsey’s informative sleeve states that she considered herself a pianist rather than a singer but her delectable intimate style won her many fans. Her last partner was the well known film composer Hugo Friedhofer, her skill at the piano helping him considerably in his studio work. She virtually retired from performance in 1961, in despair at declining standards in popular music, after which she spent most of her time teaching.

The delectable voice of Jo was featured on many of the V-discs sent to Service men overseas, a wonderful morale booster! The six shows on this CD were originally broadcast on American armed forces radio in 1946. After her first marriage broke up she teamed up with her musical director Paul Weston; two years later she married him and had a long career as a solo singer on the Columbia and Capitol labels.

Very few of the songs have moved to the present time but as Cliff Richard and Matt Goss are moving into this mode of vocalising perhaps some will be resurrected. The audience is sometimes edited out but sound, obviously culled from several sources, varies. Michael Highton’s sleeve notes relive Gary’s ninety three years in detail.

Along with some of the \"West Coast\" sounds provided by Marty Paich and various groups large and small, there are five tracks from the excellent recordings made in England: The Cuckoo In The Clock and Walkin’ Shoes with the Ted Heath orchestra; Hooray For Love with Cyril Stapleton’s orchestra; Waltz For Young Lovers with Roland Shaw’s Orchestra; and top of the list an absolutely superb version of A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square arranged by Wally Stott [Angela Morley].

Will’s smooth trombone graced many bands including Glenn Miller, Freddie Rich and our own Ray Noble before forming his own band. Will here features the trumpet of Billy Butterfield and piano of Stan Freeman. Of all the tracks the ballads set the high standard: Lonely Night, Winter Time and A Little Time To Dream are my pick, closely followed by three \"bouncy\" numbers: Ridin’ The Riff, Tasty Dish and A Ia Carte.

No doubt our French friends will be familiar with the name Christian Chevallier; for the rest of us this Platinum Collection is a revelation. Compiled by RFS member Serge Elhaik, we are taken back to the 1950s when Christian’s band was paying homage to US giants such as George Gershwin, Duke Ellington and Neal Hefti with some charts that really swing. This continues through the second CD [many numbers are his own compositions], until the third finds him mainly in the 1960s with attractive vocal tracks featuring Henri Salvador, Richard Anthony, Gilbert Becaud and Line Renard, with some tasteful string backings – quite a contrast to the earlier big band numbers. In fact the third CD contains some excellent tracks, some of which are in light orchestral territory. I particularly liked the non-vocal versions of four Gilbert Becaud numbers: Le Mur, Si Je Pouvais Revivre Un Jour Ma Vie, Croquemi-toufle and Il Fait Des Bonds. At an RFS meeting a few years back we showed a video of Dolf van der Linden and the Metropole Orchestra playing the last named in a TV broadcast – I always wondered where it came from! I think it true to say that this is a very varied selection which no doubt provides an accurate portrait of Chevallier’s career. The press release says he merits rediscovery, and I certainly agree.

Sounds of Yesteryear DSOY821 [75:04]. The first five tunes are preceded by a lesson on how to sing \"Bop\" by Charlie Ventura, Jackie Caine and Roy Kral. The second half includes rare broadcasts with among others Charlie Parker’s All Stars and The Miles Davis All Stars. Charlie’s deft sax playing really keeps things moving. A very enjoyable set.

The accompanying notes make the interesting point that the majority were composed before 1920 and yet all are still regularly performed at ceremonial occasions and on the concert platform and, until the sharp decline in their regular use, the park and pier bandstand. An exception is a fine modern march Skywatch by R.E.C. Davies dating from the mid-1970s, and it would have been useful to have some information on this piece but the notes are somewhat brief and generalised. All the tempi are superbly judged by the Director of Music who adopts the appropriately more sedate pace for Teike’s famous Old Comrades. The disc ends fittingly with the RAF March Past, which features George Dyson’s noble, dignified and poignant trio tune. The recordings made at RAF Uxbridge are uniformly excellent with production standards exemplary throughout. An undoubted \"feather in the cap\" for this outstanding band who can certainly look unflinchingly into the eyes of the Household Division and Royal Marines bands. Small wonder that last year they were signed up Decca! Strongly recommended. Roger Hyslop\n\nSOUSA Music For Wind Band, Vol. 8 Band of the Royal Artillery cond.

KT Ed.] it must be John Philip Sousa. The most surprising thing about this 2010 release is that the recording sessions for it were held in Woolwich Town Hall as far back as January 2005. As usual with this series the familiar mingles with a considerable number of rarely heard or performed pieces. Thus the popular share the disc with an extended selection from Sousa’s operetta ‘El Capitan’ and a 16-minute suite At the King’s Court’, which Keith Brion tells us in his informative booklet was probably composed in preparation for the Sousa’s Band 1905 tour to England, where it was played for King Edward VII at a command performance. The march Jack Tarreceived its first performance at the Royal Albert Hall with both the King and Queen present and the not inconsiderable forces of the Coldstream, Scots and Irish Guards, Sousa’s Band, a band from New Zealand and the Queens Hall Orchestra – its amazing the roof of the venerable RAH remained intact. Martin Hinton, principal cornetist with the RA Band, takes centre stage with Warrior from the aforementioned El Capitan’ and Campus, an ebullient jaunty piece that comes complete with words by the composer’s daughter and vocalized presumably by the band. This latest release amply vindicates again the reputation of this Band as one of the best in the British Army; and if you haven’t already started collecting this outstanding series – it is not too late! Roger Hyslop\n\nClassical Corner\n\nDVORAK Symphony No.6; Nocturne in B Major; Scherzo Capriccioso Baltimore Symphony Orchestra / Marie Alsop Naxos 8.570995 [68:19] The well received recordings by these forces of Dvorak’s Symphony Nos.7 & 8 [Naxos 8.572112] and the favourite 9th Symphony, ‘From the New World’, coupled with the Symphonic Variations [Naxos 8.570714] have been followed by the latest arrival, the magnificent 6th Symphony, which has been a \"Desert Island\" choice for me ever since I became acquainted with the classic account by the late Istvan Kertesz [Decca 473 798-2] in the mid-960s. Naxos have added the popular Scherzo and Nocturne, an arrangement for string orchestra of the slow movement from the Fourth String Quartet. Altogether extraordinary value and strongly recommended if you fancy this life enhancing musical masterwork. Roger Hyslop\n\nHALVORSEN Orchestral Works, Vol. 2 Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra / Neeme Jarvi ; *Marianne Thorsen [violin] Air norvégien*; Chant de Veslemoy*; Three Norwegian Dances*; Suite ancienne*; Symphony No 2, ‘Fatum’ Chandos CHAN10614 [75:50] This from the Norwegian composer Johan Halvorsen follows hard on the heels of Volume 1 reviewed in JIM 185. It is a particularly attractive release since it includes one of the composer’s most adorable works. The Suite ancienne [1911] was originally conceived as entrácte music for a play by Ludwig Holberg but it was always devised as an orchestral suite in its own right and to begin with was called the Holberg Suite, but to avoid confusion with Grieg’s composition Halvorsen finally settled on ‘From olden days’, which on publication was translated into the French equivalent. He regarded it himself as one of his finest compositions and certainly the 2nd movement, an Air with variations, is heartfelt and enchanting, and it is difficult to imagine anyone could be immune from its charms. The whole piece is simply bursting with melodic interest and thoroughly deserves to be better known. Also included are several short pieces for violin and orchestra, of which the Air norvégien is imbued with a delightful and unmistakeably Nordic freshness. The major work here is Halvorsen’s Second Symphony, to which on revision he attributed the nickname ‘Fatum’ or ‘Fate’. More challenging fare maybe but in no way can this be described as difficult music, with a notably cheerful third movement ‘intermezzo.’ An immensely likeable disc possessing great charm, integrity and above all melody, from a composer who thoroughly deserves a significantly higher profile in the musical firmament – and what better champion could he have than Neeme Jarvi? Well worth investigating. Roger Hyslop\n\nWilfred Askew reminds us of more recently received releases\n\nCARL’S WAR Czech National Symphony Orchestra cond.

For full track listing please see the Light Music CDs section of this website, or visit the Guild Music site where excerpts from all the tracks can be auditioned. You could almost hear the call \"Lights, Camera, Action\" prior to the opening number of this latest Guild release 'Bright and Breezy' which is also the title track by Peter Dennis: a typical show bizz/film opening number and newsreel backing of the 1950s, followed coincidentally or perhaps on purpose by Charles Williams' Jealous Lover which was used as the theme for Billy Wilder\" 1960 film 'The Apartment', musical director Adolph Deutsch. The recording on this CD is by Billy Vaughn and his Orchestra and very good it is too. I've always thought of Vaughn as a jazz/swing musician but this is pure concert orchestra and Charles Williams would have given the thumbs up at this version I'm sure. This isn't the first time Charles Williams' music has appeared in an American feature film; one of his many Chappell mood pieces Barrage on C234 was used in 'The Rocketeer' (1991) as backing to a supposed Nazi propaganda cartoon and his name appears on the end credits. This sequence can be seen on YouTube. Upping the tempo somewhat we have the Harry Warren/Bob Russell number Carnival played by Les Baxter and his Orchestra followed by the Robert Farnon Orchestra with Bob\" own arrangement of They Call the Wind Maria from 'Paint Your Wagon' and you can almost \"see the wagon train crossing the prairie\". I'm not sure that Ragazza Romanza as played by The Melachrino Orchestra comes under the banner of \"bright and breezy\", or Misty played by The Knightsbridge Strings, but Painted Carousels from the De Wolfe Library by Anthony Mawer and Bill Davies\" Toy Town Trumpeters from the Josef Weinberger library certainly do. Ernie Freeman, sometimes known as Sir Chauncey (where do they get these monikers from?) and his Orchestra play a piece called Midi-Midinette and as I'd no idea what a 'midinette' is I checked out my Chambers Dictionary: it\" a \"young female worker, especially in the Paris fashion or millinery business\" from the South of France and after all that it\" not a bad piece either, the music I mean. The Starlight Symphony conducted by Cyril Ornadel give a super performance of Begin the Beguine from 'Jubilee' by Cole Porter with what sounds like a wordless chorus, then the tempo perks up courtesy of Reg Owen and his Orchestra with Bambalina which needed three writers, Vincent Youmans, Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein to pen it. Although not \"bright and breezy\" Bob Farnon\" Players Cigarettes Commercials music Sea Shore played by Rawicz and Landauer and accompanied by Wally Stott\" Orchestra make a pleasing contribution to the programme ... but back to the theme of the CD: Ivor Slaney\" Stringendo, Dancing Daffodils by the Guy Luypaerts Orchestra and Up and Coming by the unsung Cyril Watters get the tempo back on track. Still up to speed is a topnotch recording on the Embassy Label of Marquina\" Spanish Gypsy Dance by Jacques Leroy and his Orchestra, whoever he is or was. Go to the top of the class if you know. From the MGM 1936 film 'San Francisco' comes the title number in this splendid arrangement by Carmen Dragon who conducts the Standard School Broadcast Orchestra on a transcription disc recorded in Capitol Studios in 1960. The CD ends with a 1937 German recording of the Ernst Fischer suite 'South of the Alps' played by a Concert Orchestra conducted by Bruno Seidler-Winkler. A fine piece of Continental light music to end this 80th Guild Light Music release.

The sound quality is first-class. However my feeling is that for releases from 1967 the arrangements sound pleasant but dated, rather ten years back in time and as such somewhat uninspired. By comparison, for example, Frank Chacksfield and his arrangers had for me moved on better with interpretations of pop songs of the '60s era.

The first album, released in 1967, was produced by the legendary (now Sir) George Martin and has been described online as a \"real light classic gem\". I won't argue with that. The first track was composed by orchestra leader Ralph Elman. The second album, from nine years later, has an exhilarating opening that brings to mind Ron\" Trumpet Volunteer on 'The Best of Sellers' 10\" LP. The remainder of the album gives us Ron\" stylish arrangements of three Latin American popular classics, and some of the best love songs in the business as well as Ron\" own romantic number. The oboe led last track is as beautiful a version of Sondheim\" evocative opus as I have ever heard. Liner notes by David Ades are as informative as ever. Among all the light music albums reviewed here, this release goes to the top of the pile and is my CD CHOICE for June. Peter Burt\n\nCHRIS DEAN\" SYD LAWRENCE ORCHESTRA A Night at the Movies Strike up the Band; Misty; Hooray for Hollywood; It\" Magic; With a Song in My Heart; Laura; Put on a Happy Face; Marcel McTattie LeCoq; It\" Alright with Me; Boulevard of Broken Dreams; Alexander\" Ragtime Band; Tara\" Theme; The Pink Panther; Smile; Bond Medley- Theme/You Only Live Twice/On Her Majesty\" Secret Service/ Nobody Does it Better/From Russia with Love/For Your Eyes Only/Thunderball/ Live and Let Die/We Have All the Time in the World/Goldfinger Avid IMCD004 (60:45) Ever since the inception of the Hollywood musicals the movies have been a rich source of great songs for bandleaders, and this new release shows that the tradition is alive and well, and in good hands. Gershwin's opener was the title song for the musical play which made it to the silver screen in 1940. Like some of the other numbers it's played in the Roland Shaw arrangement, whilst Billy May and Nelson Riddle get a look in also. The selection provides plenty of variety, with a nice balance between instrumentals '- with precise ensemble playing punctuated by featured soloists '- and excellent vocals. I'm delighted at the inclusion of a number penned especially for the late much-missed Malcolm Laycock, which takes as its title his adopted soubriquet. I can pay this CD no greater compliment than to say he would have loved it.

The 'Favourite Tangos' LP was originally recorded at Decca\" West Hampstead studios between 20th June 1952 and 10th April 1953 '- the year in which it was released. It makes a fine companion to the later stereo compilation ('Old and New Fangled Tangos'/'Folk Songs Around the World' on Vocalion CDLK4265) with which it has four tracks in common. 'Favourite Waltzes' was the maestro\" first 12-inch LP and comes from a year earlier although recording began in November 1951. It is an absolutely delightful compilation of melodies with that distinctive Ronald Binge orchestrated post-Charmaine \"Marmite\" string sound [love or loathe it] well to the fore but not excessively so. Once again Colin Mackenzie\" liner notes enhance the listening pleasure. This is one of three Vocalion CDs priced at £2.99 although, as I have bemoaned before, virtually impossible to obtain at that price from the usual online suppliers. Orders direct to Dutton incur p&p charges. But, still, a great bargain! Peter Burt\n\nPAUL MAURIAT & HIS ORCHESTRA Rhythm And Blues & The Paul Mauriat Orchestra 24 tracks incl. Respect; Unchain My Heart; I've Been Loving You Too Long; Natural Woman; Last Night; You Keep Me Hangin' On ... / El Bimbo; Mandy; Angie Baby; I Got a Name; Rock Your Baby; Have you Never Been Mellow ... Vocalion CDLK 4433 (72:46) One of \"Les Grands Trois\" of French light music maestros from the 1950s to the 1980s (the others being Franck Pourcel and Raymond Lefèvre), M. Mauriat will probably be quite well represented in our collections as there are over 220 of his albums listed at www.best-cd-price.co.uk. He had one of the largest recording catalogues featuring more than 1000 titles just from his Polygram years of 1965 to 1993. From this period here\" a 2-on-1 disc of fairly undemanding Mauriat fare to add to your shelves. The conductor is responsible for all the arrangements on the second album, which features the Hawaiian guitar of Marcel Blanchi on Mauriat\" own Pacific Holiday. Presumably Philips thought they knew what the public expected and did not bother with sleeve notes '- hence no liner notes here. Simon Peters\n\nMELACHRINO & HIS ORCHESTRA The Music of Victor Herbert & The Music of Sigmund Romberg 24 tracks incl. Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life; March of the Toys; Gypsy Love Song; I'm Falling in Love with Someone; The Streets of New York; Italian Street Song ... Deep in My Heart, Dear; Lover, Come Back to Me; The Riff Song; One Alone; Wanting You; The Desert Song ... Vocalion CDVS 1968 (74:55) A further release at the lowest possible price point from another of light music\" great conductors and orchestra. Both these RCA albums from 1960 are in stereo and it would be difficult to find a more melodic compilation. A review at the time described the playing as \"splendidly vital and with an exceptionally live and immediate sound for the string choir\". Herbert was born in 1859 (he died in 1924) and became the dominant and most influential composer, mainly in operetta vein, for the musical theatre in America. The selection here will be familiar to most. When I was growing up 'Desert Song, 'New Moon' and 'Student Prince' were standard fare for amateur operatic/dramatic societies throughout the land. All three shows are represented in the second album of best-known tunes from another American composer, the Hungarian-born Romberg (1887'-1951). Vocalion reprint Stanley Green\" sleeve notes from the original LPs, and there is a most attractive booklet front. Fine stuff! Peter Burt\n\nTHE MELODY LINGERS ON 28 Radio Favourites 1952-1960 Marching Strings (Ray Martin\" Concert Orchestra); Meet Mister Callaghan (Frank Chacksfield\" Tunesmiths); Marianina (Norrie Paramor\" Concert Orchestra); Violin Boogie (The Max Jaffa Quintet); Blue Tango (Ray Martin\" Concert Orchestra); Theme From Modern Times ('Smile') (Ron Goodwin\" Concert Orchestra); Delicado (Frank Cordell & His Orchestra); Gabrielle (Cyril Stapleton & His Orchestra); Little Red Monkey (Frank Chacksfield\" Tunesmiths); Terry\" Theme from Limelight (Ron Goodwin\" Concert Orchestra); Jamaican Rumba (Mantovani & His Orchestra); Song Of The Sea (Canção do mar) (The Melachrino Orchestra); Serenade To Eileen (Stanley Black & His Orchestra); Carnavalito (Cyril Stapleton & His Orchestra); Cresta Run (Sidney Torch & His Orchestra); Violin Samba (The Max Jaffa Quintet); No Other Love (Ron Goodwin\" Concert Orchestra); Zambezi (Joe Loss & His Orchestra); The Banks Of The Seine (Frank Chacksfield & His Orchestra); Stranger Than Fiction (Sidney Torch\" Orchestra); The Lily Watkins Theme (The Melachrino Orchestra); Flamenco Love (Frank Cordell & His Orchestra); Lazy Cowboy (Ray Martin\" Concert Orchestra); The Italian Theme (Cyril Stapleton & His Orchestra); Theme from Last Rhapsody (Stanley Black wIth Mantovani & His Orchestra); Red Cloak(Ron Goodwin\" Concert Orchestra); The Windows Of Paris (Tony Osborne & His Orchestra); Theme from A Summer Place (Norrie Paramor & His Orchestra) Delta Bygone Days BYD77062 (73:00). This is the anticipated follow-up to the 'Journey Into Melody' CD reviewed in our last issue. Its success has prompted this speedy sequel, which contains a feast of splendid light music. If you regularly collect similar compilations you will probably have some of the numbers, but there should be sufficient new titles to encourage you to purchase '- especially as it is available at a bargain price. Congratulations to Peter Dempsey for compiling and annotating another entertaining feast of nostalgia. David Ades\n\nWERNER MULLER & HIS ORCHESTRA Learn To Love & Sentimental Journey 22 tracks incl. Let\" Stay Together; With You Gone; You're a Lady; Learn to Love; The Impossible Dream; Clair; Theme from 'Lost Horizon' ... / I'm in the Mood for Love; I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm; Moonlight Serenade; At Last; Mood Indigo ... Vocalion CDLK 4432 (77:03) Although he has around 90 albums listed, it seems that there is less information on Werner Muller than practically any other internationally known light music maestro, even with the help of Google! And the various Vocalion re-issues I've seen, good as they are, do not provide any liner notes on the man or his music. I have discovered that he was born in Berlin in 1920 and that he spent many years conducting two of Germany\" most popular radio orchestras '- RIAS and WDR. He died in 1998. With this re-issue, on CD for the first time, we have two original Decca Phase 4 albums, the first from 1973, the second from four years later. The Muller concert orchestra is possibly more dominated by the brass section than some of its contempories and, although very well recorded (the recording engineer on both albums is Arthur Lilley, who played such a big part in the success of Mantovani\" recordings), maybe does not have as strong a personality of its own as some others. The opening track, Mouldy Old Dough, is one of those tunes you find yourself constantly replaying. The second album is mellower as befits the tune selection, although there is variety as Rimsky-Korsakov\" Song of India is followed by Duke Ellington\" Satin Doll. One of the best tracks for me is Begin the Beguine. With a nice string sound throughout, this is an attractive release. Peter Burt\n\nWOOLF PHILLIPS The Lullaby of Broadway (The Music of Dubin and Warren) & JACK PAYNE Say It With Music Lullaby of Broadway; I Only Have Eyes for You; You're Getting to be a Habit with Me; The Rose in Her Hair; Would you Like to Take a Walk; Forty Second Street; September in the Rain; Shuffle off to Buffalo; Shadow Waltz; You'll Never Know; Young and Healthy / Say in with Music; I'm in the Mood for Love; I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You); Try a Little Tenderness; Guilty; I Surrender, Dear; There\" a Small Hotel; Just One More Chance; Blue Pacific Moonlight; Memories of you; Love in bloom; Love is the Sweetest Thing Vocalion CDVS 1970 (70:22) Another bargain at £2.99! When he died in 2003, aged 84, Woolf Phillips obituary in The Independent described him \"as one of the last surviving major big-band leaders of the post-war British dance band scene\". Not all our readers may realize that Sid Phillips was his older brother. After war service he had been an arranger for Geraldo\" orchestra alongside Robert Farnon and Wally Stott (Angela Morley), and from November 1947 to September 1949 he led the famous Skyrockets orchestra. He is probably best remembered as bandleader, MC and comedy foil at the London Palladium during its heyday between 1947 and 1953. I seem to remember him, too, as MD for Vera Lynn on TV. His album here in full orchestral arrangements features the work of Al Dubin and Harry Warren who wrote some of the biggest hit songs of the 1930s. Jack Payne (1899-1969) may be remembered by our oldest readers as Director of Dance Music for the BBC at Savoy Hill, leading the BBC Dance Orchestra until he was succeeded by Henry Hall in 1932. He returned to the Beeb as Director of Dance Music for five years from 1941. I first became a fan in the early '50s when he was a notable radio disc jockey and in 1955 presenting his own TV show 'Words and Music', which ran for three series. The arrangers on this album are Dick Barrell, Brian Fahey and Tony Osborne. All credit to Mike Dutton (again!) for resuscitating these two immaculately played tuneful albums, with uncredited instructive original LP sleeve notes, from 1956 and 1958 respectively. Peter Burt\n\nFRANCK POURCEL & HIS ORCHESTRA Magnifique & Girls 24 tracks incl. Un Jour Se Lève; Yesterday; Mon Coeur D'Attache; (Manuel Benitez) El Cordobés; Le Ciel, Le Soleil et La Mer; Quand on est Ensemble; Solenzara; El?ise; Laura; Hello, Dolly!; Lili Marlene; Louise; Maria Elena; Maria; I Want to Be Happy; Mrs Robinson; Delilah; Brigitte; Pilar Vocalion CDLK 4441 [63.23]This superb new Franck Pourcel two-on-one is worthy of your attention not only for its terrific arrangements but also for the carefully crafted inlay notes which outline his distinguished career in some detail. Deservedly so, too, because Franck was one of the leading exponents of the modern orchestral format, making over 200 albums, a fraction of which, unfortunately, were made available in the British Isles. A masterly perfectionist in all he did, Pourcel highlighted the use of high-pitched strings, wordless female vocals and intriguing rhythms so well you could instantly recognise one of his recordings. A particularly good example of his ability to transform a good pop song into an instrumental gem is his treatment of Gilbert Bécaud's Seul Sur Son ?toile which later became the English language hit It Must Be Him, sung by Vikki Carr. Other highlights from this collection include the delightful Girl (where the strings reign supreme), Lara's Theme, Thunderball, Eloise and a hauntingly dramatic version of the continental hit Merci Cherie. This timely issue is a worthy testament to the memory of a truly great interpreter of the modern light orchestral album.

Whenever light music buffs talk about German salon music of the inter-war years the name Barnabas von Géczy inevitably crops up. It seems that collectors simply can't get enough of his recordings, so many of them will be over the moon with these new CDs from our friend Frank Bristow in Australia. The repertoire ranges from catchy light novelties such as Josef Rixner\" Ragamuffin (originally called Spitzbub) through familiar 'Palm Court' favourites like Im Chambre Separee to a few more substantial works by Haydn, Hellmesberger and Strauss. The booklets are packed with information, and Mike Redstone\" digital restorations are top class. If this is your kind of repertoire, you'll want to snap these two up straight away!

His biggest hit with his orchestra was his own composition, Tokyo Melody,the theme for the 1964 Olympics. On this CD the first 12 tracks are standard songs given a lush smooth treatment by the massed strings. The second brace are not quite so familiar but are also highly listenable to in Zacharias\" own arrangements. Peter Burt\n\nTHE FILM MUSIC OF DOREEN CARWITHEN BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Gavin Sutherland Boys in Brown; Three Cases of Murder; Mantrap; To the Public Danger; Men of Sherwood Forest; East Anglian Holiday; Travel Royal. Dutton Epoch CDLX 7266 (60:00) Doreen Carwithen was the amanuensis of William Alwyn whom she later married. Her music has a distinctive lyrical quality and is thoroughly approachable as light music; indeed had she been a man we would have heard a great deal more about her. This is a great CD and an excellent sequel to her Chandos disc (re-issued on CHAN 10365X) both of which you will want to play over and over again. Very highly recommended, especially as the music has been reconstructed by Philip Lane. The first five works are from dramatic films, the last two from travel documentaries. Edmund Whitehouse\n\nTHE FILM MUSIC OF BRIAN EASDALE BBC National Orchestra of Wales conducted by Rumon Gamba The Red Shoes; Kew Gardens; Black Narcissus; Battle of the River Plate; Adventure On; Gone to Earth Chandos CHAN 10636 (75:00) British films from the 1930s to the 1960s often had superb background music, which complemented the storyline perfectly but many, if not most, were jettisoned as being of little or no value once the film was released. Philip Lane has spent a massive amount of time rescoring them for recorded performance and here are his latest offerings, supplemented by John Wilson. The Red Shoes starred Moira Shearer as a doomed ballet dancer;Battle of the River Plate starred John Gregson, Anthony Quayle and Peter Finch chasing the German pocket battleship Graf Spee; Black Narcissus starred Deborah Kerr and Jean Simmons as two nuns in a doomed wartime love story; Gone to Earth starred Jennifer Jones, David Farrar, Cyril Cusack and the semi-blind Esmond Knight chasing foxes and each other; Adventure On (the suite from which was dedicated to Sir John Barbirolli) was a documentary about Massey Ferguson farm equipment; whileKew Gardens does exactly what is says on the label, depicting changing horticultural scenes south of the River Thames. Older film buffs will love these sounds of reconstructed old film music. Edmund Whitehouse\n\nDEBBIE WISEMAN 'The Promise' (Original Television Soundtrack) Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Conducted by Debbie Wiseman. Silva Screen SILCD1354 (74:41). During February Channel 4 in the UK screened an epic four-part drama documentary 'The Promise'. Debbie\" score is performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and is one of her most ambitious scores to date which, alongside the traditional orchestra, includes a vast array of ethnic performers. The story of the film centres around a British girl who travels to Israel/Palestine and retraces the steps of her grandfather who was a British soldier stationed there in the 1940s. To bring this story to life musically Debbie has drawn on Arabic and ethnic influences, and has featured the Duduk, Kaval, Dud, Arabic violin, Arabic vocal, and ethnic percussion '- as well as a full symphony orchestra of strings and woodwind. In a press release accompanying the launch of the soundtrack album, Debbie said: \"Working with director Peter Kosminsky again on 'The Promise' has been one of the most exciting and musically challenging projects of my career. Writing over 4 hours of music for the films, and weaving the western and ethnic eastern instrumentation together for this heartbreaking story was a massive challenge. It was a real delight to conduct the sessions with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the diverse solo performers '- I really didn't want it to end!\" Debbie is also heard playing the piano, and the CD comes with a lavishly illustrated booklet that will delight viewers wanting a permanent souvenir of the series. This is the latest in a long series of prestigious projects by one of the finest composers working in television and films today, and it is warmly recommended to readers who like to include this kind of repertoire in their collections.

Andrew McCullough on clarinet and Peter Ayers on accordion are joined by the double bass of Christopher Finch and the percussion of Ian Chopping in a wide ranging programme including three pieces by ?stor Piazzolla. Being a pushover for the evocative sound of the accordion, I found it and the tango rhythm irresistible. And who would have expected an accordion to play a Bach Organ Prelude? I also loved the instrument in musette mode on Paris Medley, written to entertain Orient Express passengers. Even one of my all-time unfavourite tunes, A Man and a Woman,composed by Francis Lai (himself an accordionist) is bearable. A slight cavil is that I would have been even happier with a playing time of nearer an hour '- quantity as well as quality. I urge you to get this CD and to share in the obvious enjoyment of the players.

But, nota bene, here he is not playing the famous Wurlitzer but his touring organ with its quite different sound. This album has grown on me with repeated hearings, although I still miss the resonance of the larger instrument. Music Box Dancer is delightful and the rather attractive JoplinRag is one I've not heard before. Evidently concert tour audiences are very appreciative of the instrument so good sales should ensue. The disc is produced by Mr Kelsall and our fellow RFS member Tim Wills. Even without the \"big W\", at under £6 online this is well worth a whirl. Peter Burt\n\nNIGEL OGDEN Pure Nostalgia 14 tracks incl. The Middy; Guys and Dolls Selection; Deep Purple; Funeral March of a Marionette; Is It True What They Say About Dixie?; Tower Ballroom Classics; Quickstepping with Jerome Kern; Moonlight in Vermont; Television Themes ... Grasmere GRCD135(73:47) It is the Tower Ballroom Wurlitzer Organ but at the console the long-time presenter of Radio 2\" 'The Organist Entertains' . The recording was evidently made on one of the coldest days in November last year. It arrived in early April on one of the hottest days so far this year. I have heard Nigel live in a nonconformist chapel and he is a fine player. (Interestingly, he includes two hymn tunes in his final selection Lest We Forget). One can only marvel here at his control over this super instrument. The album is an eclectic compilation that should give pleasure to all lovers of that special \"Blackpool sound\". Peter Burt\n\nTONY BENNETT While We're Young 57 tracks incl. Cold, Cold Heart; Always; Just in Time; It\" Magic; Boulevard of Broken Dreams; Stranger in Paradise; Rags to Riches; Blue Velvet; Sing You Sinners ... Jasmine JASCD 679 (79:00 & 79:31) This generous package presents Tony Bennett singing for the most part slow ballads. His rich full-throated voice is admirably suited to the material, and sound quality is excellent. The tracklist shows that he\" aided and abetted by some of the best accompanists of the time, in particular Percy Faith. Robert Nickora\" liner note hints that the compilation spans the middle to late fifties, but actual recording dates are omitted. Barry McCanna\n\nBING CROSBY Through The Years : Volume Seven 36 tracks incl. Learn to croon; Thanks; Muddy water; Mississippi mud; My kinda love; I surrender, Dear; Oh!

Sepia 1167 (74:27) The latest volume of this comprehensive series by the great Bing reaches 1954. Most of the tracks between April and June (accompanied by Buddy Cole and his Trio) are from 'A Musical Autobiography', Decca\" 20th anniversary celebration issue of five LPs in tribute to their most successful star. Standout tracks for me include two of my favourite songs,Love in bloom and It\" easy to remember, and also What can you do with a General? and Count your blessings '- both from the 'White Christmas' movie. All the tracks are introduced by the man himself and, although extremely interesting, might not make this compilation ideal for repeated listening ...? A 12-page booklet of notes by Malcolm Macfarlane is a model of its kind.

Metro CD650 (75:11 & 77:15)A few months ago in Back Tracks I encouraged you to buy a budget price disc by Barbara Dickson, actress, pianist, songwriter and singer. Now, alongside her latest album 'Words Unspoken' (Greentrax CDTRAX 353), on which she returns to her folk roots, we have a 2½ hour 2-CD compilation with good liner notes for around a fiver that must rate as the best bargain of the year so far. It contains a good mix of contemporary show tunes '- in 1985 she had a Top 20 hit with Another suitcase in another hall from 'Evita' and a No.1 with Elaine Paige on I know him so well from 'Chess' (still the all-time worldwide best-selling duet by two females) '- as well as folk numbers and excellent cover versions of other artists' hits. Barbara has a lovely voice, and it is no surprise to read that her debut album in the '70s sold more than 600,000 copies and stayed in the charts for more than a year. She received an OBE in the 2001 New Year\" Honours List for her \"service to music and drama.\" Not bad for someone whose early ambition as a wee Scots lassie was just to sing like Doris Day!

Retrospective RTS 4168 (78:58) & (78:41) a Although in essence this is a compilation that was issued in 2002 on the now defunct Living Era label, it deserves to be judged on its own merits, which are considerable. Between 1929 and 1947 Hutch recorded over 600 sides, initially for Parlophone (including some with Harry Roy, seven of which are included), changing to HMV in May 1940. They took in some of the greatest songs of the thirties and forties, and that\" reflected in this selection. Hutch was a song stylist, and the combination of his husky throbbing voice and his accompaniment convey potent charm. Sound quality is excellent, as is Peter Dempsey\" liner note. Barry McCanna\n\nPEGGY LEE The Hits and More 53 tracks incl. Manana; Caramba it\" the Samba; Riders in the Sky; Lover; Fever; My Heart Belongs to Daddy; Johnny Guitar; Sing a Rainbow; The Siamese Cat Song ...Jasmine JASCD 579 (76:55 & 77:02) This compilation spans just over a decade, from 1948 to 1959, when Peggy Lee was at the peak of her illustrious career. The tracklist shows year of recording and chart place but not accompaniment, although Ossie Dales' relatively brief liner note does refer to her album with George Shearing, from which You Came a Long Way From St. Louis has been included. Barry McCanna\n\nMARGARET WHITING\" Great Hits It might as well be Spring; A tree in the meadow; A wonderful guy; My ideal; Come rain or come shine; Baby, it\" cold outside (with Bill Lee); That old black magic; Moonlight in Vermont; Now is the hour; Slippin' around; Faraway places; My foolish heart; Guilty; Let\" go to church; Morgen; Lavender blue; I've been there; Till there was you; The Three Bells; Broken hearted melody; I loves you Porgy; What a diff'rence a day made; I only have eyes for you; My wish came true; Glad to be unhappy; Little girl blue; One for my baby Sepia 1163 (74:13) Margaret Whiting was a popular singer par excellence who died earlier this year, aged 86. She recorded for Capitol Records from soon after it was founded in 1942 for 15 years and had a string of more than 40 hits from '46 to '54. The biggest of these included Now is the hour, A tree in the meadow, andFaraway places, all Nos.1 or 2 in '48, then with Country & Western star Jimmy Wakely on Slippin' around, No.1 in '49. She joined Dot Records in 1957 and re-recorded in stereo her 'Greatest Hits',which comprise the first 14 tracks on this outstanding disc. She was fortunate in having as her arranger and conductor Russ Garcia, who was in the process of becoming a big name in Los Angeles jazz circles. The next ten tracks were issued as the album 'Top Ten Hits' in 1959. This time Milt Rogers does the honours as arranger/conductor. Great to hear The Three Bells again after many years, though it does not oust the version by Les Compagnons de la Chanson in my affections. Sepia has something of a coup with the last three tracks: the first-time release of rare performances accompanied by pianist Walter Gross. The CD booklet is well up to the high standard we have come to expect. This release is a wonderful memento of a beautiful vocalist singing quality songs, and has given me a great deal of listening pleasure. It will surely do the same for you.

Bos Entertainment BOS6819 [47:49].Back in May 2004 a sound engineer at the Caxton Theatre in Grimsby happened to make a recording of Gary in concert with the James Pearson Trio. It was never intended for release, and Gary had forgotten about it until he came across it last year. Happily for his many admirers he decided that it deserved to reach a wider audience. Gary needs no introduction to readers of this magazine; his work has been praised by us on many occasions in the past. This time we find him in a sophisticated cabaret setting, with superb arrangements by Andrew Cottee. Gary sings in the kind of relaxed and confident manner that can only be achieved by a performer with plenty of experience and bucketfuls of talent. Both Gary and Andrew have deservedly enjoyed considerable success in their careers since 2004, and long may they both continue to regale us with top quality popular music. The future is bright with talents like this around on the scene. David Ades\n\n75 GLENN MILLER MASTERPIECES Original Radio Broadcasts Glenn Miller and his Orchestra 42 tracks Sepia 1165 (67:42 & 65:51) The music of Glenn Miller has been with us for some 70 years and, like all things of quality, one never tires of the emotion that it evokes in one\" musical soul. This 2 CD set certainly captures the nostalgia of the wartime austerity years of the early 1940s. What make the recordings even more evocative are the introductions to some of the tracks by Glenn Miller in person. The music is quite a surprise with many tracks unfamiliar to the average dance band listener. But that said, it is for you the listener to decide on your personal preferences. Some of the Miller classics are here but unless you are an avid Glenn Miller aficionado I would be very surprised if anyone has heard all the tracks played by the great bandleader\" orchestra. My personal favourite is Perfidia, which incidentally was also played by The Shadows. Listen to both and compare. Another track that is particularly \"smooth\" is Blues in the night, with delightful vocal accompaniment and quite exquisite muted trumpet. To write too much about such famous people and their music cannot do justice to the listening experience. Suggest you buy and enjoy. Roger Chantler\n\nTHE SQUADRONAIRES The Royal Air Force Dance Orchestra : Twenty-Five Original Recordings from 1941 to 1953 Digitally Remastered incl. Amapola; Down Forget-Me-Not Lane; Anchors Aweigh; Harlem Sandman; A Journey to a Star; March of the Movies; No Name Jive; ...Bygone Days BYD77061 (77:55) The first sixteen tracks in this compilation were recorded in wartime, when the RAF Dance Orchestra recorded \"by permission of the Air Council\", after which it became known as The Squadronaires. But for the last three tracks, which were recorded under Ronnie Aldrich\" leadership, Jimmy Miller was the director, and he takes some of the vocals, as do Beryl Davis and guitarist Sid Colin. Two tracks in particular will clinch the appeal of this reissue, namely Come Out Come Out, Wherever You Are/It Must be Jelly,and I Heard You Cried Last Night/I've Found a New Baby, both of which were recorded for ENSA in mid-1944. Barry McCanna\n\nALADDIN (ORIGINAL LONDON CAST) / CINDERELLA 23 tracks Sepia 1162 (66:22) 'Aladdin', with music and lyrics by Cole Porter in what was to be his final project, first saw the light of day as an American television musical. A substantially different stage show was produced by Harold Fielding at the London Coliseum for Christmas 1960. It starred a young Bob Monkhouse, Doretta Morrow and Ronald Shiner. Direction and choreography were by Robert Helpmann and Bobby Howell was MD. Songs include No wonder taxes are high, Come to the supermarket, Ridin' high, with Trust your destiny to your star and the witty Wouldn't it be fun,both sung by Ian Wallace. 'Cinderella', from the pens of Rodgers and Hammerstein, had also been a television musical, panned by the critics but seen by a record-breaking 107 million viewers in the States. Harold Fielding brought it to the Coliseum in December 1959. The studio cast on this album includes two stalwarts of the London West End stage, Denis Quilley and Elizabeth Larner. The show is orchestrated and the London Variety Theatre Orchestra conducted by Gilbert Vinter. Among the songs the best known is No other love, which withMarriage type love augments the original score. The whole CD is a pleasing listen, likely to be most appreciated by people who actually saw the shows. Well done to the label for bringing the recordings back into circulation and to Dominic McHugh for his admirable notes. Ray Pavene\n\nAMERICAN CLASSICS : SOUSA The Great American Main Street Band / Timothy Foley 22 tracks incl. Gallant and Gay We'll March Away/Let\" Hurrah!; The Pathfinder of Panama; The Gladiator; The Gliding Girl; Who\" Who in Navy Blue; King Cotton; The Liberty Bell; The Stars and Stripes Forever!; Le Reine de la Mer; The Fairest of the Fair; Here\" To Your Health, Sir! The Washington Post; etc ... EMI Classics 64112222 (66:33) This release is presumably a reissue since the recordings made at the Rye Presbyterian Church, New York, date as far back as 1990. No matter, this is a highly enjoyable compilation of mainly marches '- some not yet included in the excellent ongoing Royal Artillery Naxos series '- intermingled and contrasted with a polonaise, a tango, a waltz and a dance hilarious (!), With Pleasure, crisply played with tremendous verve and panache. The band is clearly a highly accomplished and expert ensemble, and it would have been helpful if EMI had furnished some information about when it was established, its size, instrumentation, etc. One novelty here particularly for British listeners is the Mikado March, an arrangement of themes from the G&S operetta that had apparently taken America by storm in 1885. And, whilst decidedly not a novelty, mention should also be made of the George Washington Bicentennial March, significant because it was premiered in February 1932, only a month before the composer\" death. No self-respecting Sousa fan should pass this notable issue by and there is a good deal of interest here for the more general listener who simply has an ear for tuneful exuberant music. With superb recording quality '- strongly recommended. Roger Hyslop\n\nTHE WORLD OF BALLET Paris Conservatoire, New Symphony and Royal Opera House Orchestras / Anotole Fistoulari Eloquence ELQ4802391 (70:26 & 63:13) Melody abounds on this 2 CD set from the mid-price Australian Eloquence label '- now widely available in the UK '- under the baton of one of the best ballet and Russian music conductors of his time (he passed on in 1995). The original RCA vinyl of Lecocq\" (arr.Jacob) La fille de Madame Angot: and Walton\" Façade: Suiteswas enthusiastically reviewed for both performances and recording. And Gramophone opined that the J. Strauss II (arr. Dorati) Graduation Ball was \"Strauss as Strauss is played in Vienna\". The other equally attractive items are from four \"opera-ballets\": Mussorgsky\" Dance of the Persian Slaves, Rossini\" William Tell: Soldiers' Dance, Saint-Sa?ns\" Samson and Delilah: Bacchanale and Verdi\" Aida: Dance of the Moorish Slaves - March, plusWeber\"(arr. Berlioz) Invitation to the Dance, and Minkus\"Don Quixote: Pas de deux described by a composer of today as \"tunes just born to dance\". This is real feel-good music and these are distinctly desirable discs from \"Down Under\".

DRG-CD-8511 (64:34)\n\nJOHN BARRY Revisited 4 CDs: ‘Elizabeth Taylor in London’; ‘Zulu’; ‘Four in the Morning’; and ‘The Ember Singles’ Fantastic Voyage FVQD034 (60:40, 31:44, 68:37 & 35:55) The first was a 1963 US TV documentary, arranged and conducted by Johnnie Spence, and the six music-only tracks are reprised in stereo. Liz Taylor adopted a mid-Atlantic accent for her delivery, and I suspect that it worked better as an integral part of the TV programme. The second CD is the original stereo soundtrack of the 1964 epic film ‘Zulu’, including the narration by Richard Burton, plus six Zulu stamps performed by the John Barry Seven. The score of the 1965 feature film ‘Four in the Morning’ is dark and atmospheric. It comprises fifteen tracks, four of which are excerpts of dialogue only by the actors involved. The eleven music-only tracks are reprised in stereo. The music incorporates a recurring theme, which may become repetitive heard in isolation. Despite its title ‘John Barry Plays 007’, only four of the Ember singles are connected with James Bond films. The first two tracks were a best-forgotten attempt to exploit the 1963 Profumo affair; tracks 7 & 8 are commercial recordings of numbers from the first CD, and tracks 9 & 10 duplicate two tracks from the second. If you can ignore those drawbacks, this is a well-produced and presented boxed set which should appeal not just to John Barry enthusiasts, but also to collectors of esoterica, particularly relating to the Swinging Sixties.
