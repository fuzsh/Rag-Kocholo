        "text": "Live And Well\n\nLive album by\n\nDolly Parton\n\nReleased September 14, 2004\n\nRecorded December 12–13, 2002\n\nGenre Country\n\nLength 102:38\n\nLabel Sugar Hill\n\nProducer Dolly Parton, Gary Davis, The Blueniques\n\nLive and Well is a live album by Dolly Parton, released on September 14, 2004. It was recorded during her 2002 Halos & Horns Tour, her first in years; the performances on December 12 and 13, 2002 were used. A DVD of the concert was released simultaneously with the album.\n\nLive and Well - Wikipedia\n\n~~~~~\n\nThe show gets off to a rolling start with a cover version, this one I don't think Dolly's performed before, the great Orange Blossom Special. It's a bluegrass romp and Dolly sings the fire out of it, as expected. Train, Train is next, and it makes the opener a medley. Dolly then rolls into one of her new originals, the title track to the first of this trilogy. Mountain Angel is next, with a cute coda featuring Dolly picking up on some fans singing a long, which prompts a reprise of the song's hook. Other than that, not a lot of surprises here so far as far as performance, but the band from Halos and Horns is credited here (as The Blueniques), so it's entirely expected that this would be a slick, well-performed show. Shine and Little Sparrow follow, with Dolly describing the latter as an attempt to recreate an old-timey gospel/bluegrass tune. Up next, Dolly and the band launch into a rockin' Rocky Top, with some eyebrow-raising patter immediately following, and it starts a short sequence of Dolly hits, including an abbreviated acoustic version of My Tennessee Mountain Home, a simple but effective performance of Coat Of Many Colors, and Smokey Mountain Memories, complete with Dolly telling the story of the song beforehand. Applejack ends this oldies section of the show with Dolly's band firing on all cylinders. Marry Me returns to the new material and also serves as the close to the first disc of the set.\n\nHalos And Horns opens disc two, after a quick interlude with Dolly pondering the idea of calling her music \"hick hop\" (don't ask), followed by a couple more tunes from the album of the same name, including the fiery I'm Gone, Dagger Through The Heart, and the Bread cover If, with Dolly playing electric guitar (specifically the wah-wah guitar), which is a fun surprise. After The Gold Rush is a throwback for Dolly, and sets off another chain of classics, this time including 9 to 5, complete with audience singalong reprise, and Jolene, including a shoutout to drag queens, apparently. Dolly paused proceedings here to run down a few unfinished tunes with hilarious and/or horrific lyrics, depending on who you ask. Up next is an acapella medley of Dolly classics such as Islands in the Stream, Here You Come Again, Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That, and the bouncy Two Doors Down, here given the Alvin and the Chipmunks treatment, which is hilarious. We Irish is a Dolly original that seems to be new for this show, a cute celebration of all things Celtic that just lends itself to the ending singalong. Dolly's cover of Stairway To Heaven begins the finale of the show, and it's just as impressive in this live version as it was on the Halos and Horns album. Of course, a Dolly show wouldn't be complete without her biggest hit of all, the still-delightful I Will Always Love You, and it's a great closer to a great show. Some of Dolly's homespun humor is just right, and some of it might cause a doubletake, but the music is as impressive as ever, particularly with this slick but authentic band. Somewhat perfectly, Dolly wraps things up with a \"bluegrass version\" of her signature hit. Great stuff here.\n\nA Youtube upload of the DVD version of the show exists, but it's a real crunchy time in terms of video quality; YMMV. The audio is the same quality as the music-only release, of course.\n\nNext: Just in time for Christmas.\n\nHalos and Horns is considered by a lot of people to be the third album in Dolly's \"bluegrass trilogy\" but I've never thought of it as a bluegrass album. In fact, I would say that The Grass is Blue is the only true bluegrass album of the \"trilogy.\" To my ear, Little Sparrow is more folk and mountain music and Halos and Horns is an acoustic country album. Of course, the exception is the electric guitar in her cover of \"If.\" I've always wondered that since her cover of \"Shine\" turned out to be a hit if Dolly and her team decided that she had to have a cover of a rock song on every album going forward. It takes pretty big balls to take on Led Zeppelin but that cover of \"Stairway To Heaven\" might be one of the best recordings of her career. She'll record the song again on her Rockstar album, but that one doesn't come close to the artistry of this take. I took a class in college on song arranging and the professor who was a big rock guy, played this in class and declared that it was a \"f - ing masterpiece.\"\n\nFor God and Country always seemed like a novelty album to me. It's not one I've gone back and revisited much since it's original release. There's just not much of anything on that one that I feel the need to go back and revisit. \"Light of a Clear Blue Morning\" is one of her best songs, but she's done it twice already. \"Go To Hell\" is a fun gospel romp, but after seeing the clip of her singing this in her Christmas special it's now just a campy comedy bit. When I ripped this album into my digital library I removed the speaking parts. I'm not a fan of when Dolly does that kind of thing.\n\nI can't really comment on Live and Well since I just have the DVD and not the album.\n\nI totally agree with your take of the bluegrass \"trilogy\"! Like you, I've always considered The Grass Is Blue to be Dolly’s sole true bluegrass album. I loved this album from start to finish, no fast- forwards, with \"Silver Dagger\" being one of my Dolly all-times. I really admired Dolly for choosing from her broad taste in all types of music to interpret here.\n\nLittle Sparrow, one of Dolly's Top Tenners, is hardly a bluegrass album, as it greatly strays from the strict guidelines that constitute bluegrass. Purists were skeptical of The Grass Is Blue before they heard it, so there was no way its follow-up would be considered a proper bluegrass offering. Still, some of Dolly's finest songs are on Little Sparrow, both originals & covers. Anyone looking to newly investigate Dolly's music should certainly include this album among their inaugural round of her albums.\n\nHalos & Horns, while a satisfying listen, is the runt of this litter. It goes even further beyond the parameters of traditional bluegrass, but still offers a few contenders. \"These Old Bones\" was one of the songs that inspired Dolly's truly awful Heartsong movie series for Netflix, which was blasphemous to a genuinely unique & terrific song!\n\nI wasn't going to offer comment on For God & Country, but I will simply because of \"There Will Be Peace In The Valley For Me\" with the Fairfield Four, just gorgeous. I, too, edited the dialog from the song's intro, plays much better. Really, a sincerely spiritual 3 minutes of music. Also, Dolly channels her inner Aretha on \"Go To Hell\", which is a minor highpoint but amusing. Otherwise, there is nothing else to recommend on this album. Right down to the artwork, which features Dolly looking like Bozo in a few shots, it is Parton at her most patronizing, showbiz & low budget.\n\nNow, Just Because I'm A Woman...I really expected more from this project, especially since it received so much hype before its release date. Norah Jones did her jazzy \"The Grass Is Blue\" justice & Me'Shell Ndegeocello's \"Two Doors Down\" is another ace example of the influence Parton has had across genre. I just wish this track ran a bit beyond its 3 minutes of funk. Proving the expanse of her appeal is also Dolly herself, interpreting the collection's title track as an R&B anthem, a la Candi Staton. Melissa Etheridge's reading of \"I Will Always Love You\", on the other hand...If ever there was a reason the cutting room floor existed...\n\nKim McLean* – Happy Face\n\nLabel: Hippie Chick Twang Records – 635759159725\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: Sep 14, 2004\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nTracklist\n\n2 Angels And Eagles\n\nFeaturing [Duet With] – Dolly Parton\n\n3:42\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/25698796-Kim-McLean-Happy-Face\n\nFull playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwQ6y9BmcSWuXHvyjXa0E8yKLNJbAi-nk\n\nKim is a new artist to me, but this simple country tune is a treat, complete with Dolly singing harmony and taking the lead on the second verse. Great complementary voices here, though the song is pretty simple and straightforward. Some vaguely Irish flute adds a little texture, as do some lovely trading vocals towards the end.\n\nRandy Kohrs – I'm Torn\n\nLabel: Lonesome Day Records – LDR 005\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: 2004\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nStyle: Bluegrass\n\nTracklist\n\n3 It Looked Good On Paper\n\nVocals – Dolly Parton\n\n4:07\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/6507489-Randy-Kohrs-Im-Torn\n\nBack into the realm of bluegrass with this duet. Randy's got a fine voice, and Dolly joins in with him just perfectly. Outside of being in Dolly's album and touring band for Halos & Horns, seems he's also a fairly prolific Nashville session cat, which explains why the record's so solid, and the guest vocalist is just icing on that very pleasant cake. A favor returned, it would seem, and well done.\n\nRoy Rivers – Thank God I'm A Country Boy\n\nLabel: AGR Television – 426001922017\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: Germany\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nStyle: Country\n\nTracklist\n\n4 Thank God I'm A Country Boy\n\nVocals [Duet] – Dolly Parton\n\n2:50\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/2435956-Roy-Rivers-Thank-God-Im-A-Country-Boy\n\nNo, not Roy Rogers, Roy Rivers. No, I don't know who he is either. But he sings John Denver alright, I guess. Dolly immediately has twice the personality when she busts in the door on her verse. John Denver, she ain't, but neither is he. Not a patch on the original, though a double-time finale does its best; Dolly could have tackled this thing herself and I wouldn't have missed this feller. Harsh? Maybe.\n\nThe Bellamy Brothers* – Angels & Outlaws Volume 1\n\nLabel: Curb Records – D2-78873, Bellamy Brothers Records – D2-78873\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nStyle: Country\n\nTracklist\n\n5 Bellamy Brothers With Dolly Parton– If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body (Would You Hold It Against Me)\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/6924944-The-Bellamy-Brothers-Angels-Outlaws-Volume-1\n\nOne way to ensure a pretty great record is to take something that was already good, and add Dolly to it. It's got that awful chorused'n'chimey electric piano on it but otherwise a fairly solid little record. If it weren't for a few quips from Dolly in between vocals, this would be pretty straight forward, but she elevates it nicely.\n\nBrad Paisley – Time Well Wasted\n\nLabel: Arista Nashville – 82876-69642-2, Sony BMG Music Entertainment – 82876-69642-2\n\nFormat: CD, HDCD, Album, Stereo\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: Aug 16, 2005\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nStyle: Country\n\nTracklist\n\n12 When I Get Where I'm Going\n\nFeaturing – Dolly Parton\n\n4:08\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/24313961-Brad-Paisley-Time-Well-Wasted\n\nThis fairly basic country ballad features Dolly's strong harmonies, mostly, and Paisley's no slouch either. Also a nice trick to land a Dolly duet on your fourth album, too. Per Wikipedia, this duet's release \"made her the oldest female artist to have a Number One hit on the country charts\" which is either damning, impressive, or both, depending on who you ask.\n\nGeorge Jones (2) – Hits I Missed...And One I Didn't\n\nLabel: Bandit Records (10) – 79792-2\n\nFormat: CD, Album\n\nCountry: US\n\nReleased: Sep 13, 2005\n\nGenre: Folk, World, & Country\n\nStyle: Country\n\nTracklist\n\n3 The Blues Man\n\nFeaturing – Dolly Parton\n\n4:32\n\nhttps://www.discogs.com/release/4198388-George-Jones-Hits-I-MissedAnd-One-I-Didnt\n\nDolly and George covering Hank Jr. Not that surprising a combination, but not one I ever expected to roll up on. Nashville great Hargus \"Pig\" Robbins is also credited on piano here, a reunion of sorts with Dolly. The song itself is pleasant, with George's aged drawl fitting it nicely. Dolly does her usual trick of some great harmony vocals and a second verse that's all her, and it works, because of course it does. How could a combo like this miss?\n\nFull playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwQ6y9BmcSWuXHvyjXa0E8yKLNJbAi-nk\n\nNext: Dolly takes us back.\n\nThose Were the Days\n\nStudio album by\n\nDolly Parton\n\nReleased October 11, 2005\n\nRecorded 2004–2005\n\nStudio\n\nTwo Monkeys Studios (Nashville)\n\nStir Studio (Cardiff)\n\nThe Tracking Room at Masterfonics (Nashville)\n\nDollywood's Celebrity Theater (Pigeon Forge)\n\nOceanway (Nashville)\n\nMinutiae Studio (Nashville)\n\nAvatar Studios (New York City)\n\nKensal Town Studio D (London)\n\nNo Can Beat Studios (Hana)\n\nTaylor Made Studios (North Caldwell)\n\nSound on Sound Recording (New York City)\n\nChartmaker Studios (Los Angeles)\n\nGenre\n\nCountry folk\n\nbluegrass\n\nLength 43:50\n\nLabel\n\nSugar Hill\n\nBlue Eye\n\nProducer Dolly Parton\n\nThose Were the Days is the forty-first solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Dolly Parton. It was released on October 11, 2005, by Sugar Hill Records and Blue Eye Records. The album is a collection of covers of 1960s and 1970s folk and pop songs performed in a bluegrass style, some featuring the artists who originally recorded them. Parton supported the album with The Vintage Tour from August through December 2005.\n\nThose Were the Days (Dolly Parton album) - Wikipedia\n\n~~~~~\n\nThings kick off with a giggle and quickly launch into an interesting selection, while also being the title track. Those Were The Days might be most famous for being a hit on the fairly obscure Apple label in the late 1960s, originally sung by Welsh lass Mary Hopkin, and produced by somebody I can't quite recall... Porter Wagoner is also credited here as well along with the so-called \"Opry Gang\", which, according to a 2005 news story from a Dolly fansite, was packed to the brim with the likes of Pam Tillis, George Hamilton IV, Jan Howard, George Jones, Brenda Lee, and Jeannie Seely among others. I can only guess they're part of the ending gang vocals. Dolly tackles Dylan next, with a bluegrass spin through Blowin' in the Wind. Dylan was reportedly contacted to duet, though he (or his management) declined the invitation. Nickel Creek are the guests here, which is fitting. Norah Jones joins Dolly again on the next selection, the first of two Pete Seeger tunes on the album: Where Have All the Flowers Gone? Lee Ann Womack is also credited as a guest, and the three women add a touch of Trio to this lovely acoustic treatment. The Twelfth of Never is next, and a Johnny Mathis cover. Keith Urban duets here, and it's a pleasant uptempo country tune in this rendition, complete with nice big finish. Where Do the Children Play? is a fully countryfied rendition of a Cat Stevens song, supposedly featuring the man himself, though apparently not on vocals, as well as what sounds like a children's choir just in case you hadn't paid attention to the lyrics. It gets the full Dolly treatment and generally works. Me and Bobby McGee credits the songwriter joining Dolly, mostly in the latter part of the song, with that famous voice taking a low harmony. It's a great bluesy take on a classic and of course Dolly sings the fire out of it.\n\nCrimson And Clover is another songwriter to join in on a cover of his own record, though also only credited as contributing electric guitar. It's an interesting take on a classic, given a full pop country treatment, and some lyrical substitutions here and there. It's different enough to be interesting, and Dolly finds a little drama in the song that was mostly in the recording of the original, before a double-time bluegrass raveup leads to a quiet reference to the song's psychedelia. The Cruel War is listed as a traditional but arranged by Dolly. Alison Krauss is the big name guest here, along with her Union Station partner Dan Tyminski, as well as Dolly fan and established Nashville artist Mindy Smith. A simple acoustic arrangement pays tribute to the song's folk treatments over the years. It's lovely, and a somewhat quiet moment in a record that doesn't have as many. Turn! Turn! Turn! is the other Pete Seeger classic, and though the man himself isn't here, another legendary performer of the tune is, with Roger McGuinn contributing what sounds like his usual 12-string electric. It's somewhat buried in the mix but the entire arrangement pays tribute to the Byrds' iconic cover version. If I Were a Carpenter is the Tim Hardin folk classic, popularized by Johnny Cash. The deeper-voiced singer on this performance is 2000s country star Joe Nichols, and Dolly and Joe make a fine pair; not quite Johnny and June, but who is? A vocal harmony break that sounds like both singers backing themselves up is a nice little treat late in the recording. Both Sides, Now is given a full bluegrass treatment, and although it's a Joni Mitchell classic, the singer that beat her to releasing it is here, with Judy Collins credited and performing a lovely duet. Rhonda Vincent is also credited, and makes for another wonderful Trio-like blend of voices throughout. Imagine is the finale, and is of course the John Lennon classic. David Foster is credited as the guest, and is presumably the keyboardist here. It's a decent cover, though the strings and the return of what sounds like the children's choir (and a full choir) just nudges it over the edge of corny. And yet, Dolly's vocal is more or less as straightforward and authentic as one could ask for. Still, it's hard to compete with the seemingly effortlessly simple original. The irony is not lost on me that the Lennon cover makes this record *technically* bookended by Beatles, due to the other guy's ( )participitation in making Those Were The Days a hit, way back in 1968. It's also sort of a look forward to what Dolly would do nearly two decades later on her epic Rockstar album.\n\nNext: Busy, busy lady.\n\n( writeups are getting long because the albums are getting long )"
