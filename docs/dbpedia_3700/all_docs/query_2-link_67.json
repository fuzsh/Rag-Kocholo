        "text": "You have the original Brunswick Sea Shells. That's one I would love! I can imagine it being a real problem to get in excellent or better condition though. Which is essential for that album. I've never seen a copy even in bad condition. How did you get a lot of Canadian pressings? I can imagine them being very nice.\n\nThe If You Go LPs are both vocals in one speaker, music in the other. Awful! I will eventually get monos of these.\n\nI'm thinking of getting the World Record Club reissue of Pretty Eyes to get it in stereo. Just because it has a different sleeve. My mono is immaculate, like new, but I can tell how that kind of album would open up in stereo. I'd also like to hear Jump For Joy and Things Are Swingin' in stereo.\n\nThe reason I have such a mix of different pressings is because I've been picking them up cheap, with a lot coming from charity shops and cheap boxes in record shops and fairs. I've not paid more than £5 for any of them, a lot have been £1 or under. With the exception of the 10\"s they are all in excellent condition or better. Two of the 10\"s have bad wear (My Best To You) or a bad spiral scratch (Songs In An Intimate Style - this is annoying as it ruins about 10 seconds of an otherwise nice record but it doesn't jump. Such a scarce record though, so I'll live with it. The sleeve is perfect.)\n\nI had a few of Peggy's LPs for a long time (All Aglow Again, Beauty and the Beat! A worn Things Are Swingin'), but a couple of years ago, sadly a friend who volunteered in a charity shops wife became seriously ill. He had to move house and decided to get rid of his vinyl. Thousands of records. He sold the bulk of it to a dealer, who only took the usual 60s and 70s rock / pop type stuff, probably because he didn't have a clue what a lot of it was!\n\nThere were hundreds of albums left and he is a big Peggy fan, so he donated the leftover records to the shop he worked in, pricing them at only 69p each! I got all his Peggy records along with a lot of other interesting stuff. In a Peggy type style there was a lot of Nat King Cole, Sinatra (I'm not big on Sinatra!), Julie London, some Blossom Dearie, Dakota Staton, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Connie Francis, Nancy Sinatra and much more across many genres.\n\nAs there was a lot it took me a while to get to listen to them. I found myself enjoying Peggy more than expected. I thought she could potentially be samey or bland. How wrong I was! I started filling in the gaps as I found them and reading these threads. You and Ridin' High in particular have been invaluably helpful with this. There's been a few times you've mentioned an album here and I've bought it straightaway.\n\nI still have a lot to fully take in, but it's there and I have the rest of my life to do that! But I am playing and enjoying this collection a lot.\n\nI feel compelled to point out that Peggy Lee has the most albums in my record collection. This is not a coincidence\n\nIn addition to what I have now, I previously owned the following albums:\n\nBlues Cross Country\n\nSugar 'n' Spice\n\nMink Jazz\n\nIn Love Again!\n\nIn The Name of Love\n\nBig $pender\n\nGuitars a la Lee\n\nIs That All There Is?\n\nI pawned these titles because I did not care for the albums as much as the other offerings. In all cases, it's not the fault of Peggy, but of the arrangements and song choices. I'm a minimalist, so I keep my collection tidy, not making a habit of keeping albums that I do not enjoy. I try to live within means, and in my small house there's limited space for records! Tastes change over time, though, so perhaps one day I will come to appreciate some (if not all) of these albums.\n\nI've never owned LP versions of Christmas Carousel or If You Go, and those are two I'd like to have on record. In the case of the latter, I'll be looking for a mono pressing. Peggy's vocals are off-center on the I'm A Woman album, too, but I don't find it as distracting as I do for If You Go, because there's more reverb on the former and the arrangements seem less affected by an off-center presentation.\n\nThe only version of If You Go that I've heard is the two-on-one EMI CD with The Man I Love. This CD uses the stereo mix of If You Go, but an interesting note is that it features a narrow stereo mix, presumably to make the \"2.0\" channel separation feel less noticeable. It would be nice if someday the session tapes were used to create a freshly balanced stereo mix. I'd also love to see an audiophile reissue of Pretty Eyes - a wonderful album with great arrangements and stunning stereo sound.\n\nWonderful post, and thanks for your kind comments!\n\nThe Brunswick copy of Sea Shells is one of my most prized albums. It sounds far superior to any other presentation of the album that I've heard to date. Peggy's vocals sound breathier, earthier, with a good weight and purity of tone. The pressing is full of life and sparkle. I've always been a fan of Brunswick pressings, and prefer them for my Patsy Cline albums, too.\n\nThe reason I have so many Canadian pressings is simple - I live in Canada, and I tend to buy most of my records at the local stores rather than online. Canadian pressings are typically high quality, and I've compared the Capitol US/CA pressings of several titles, and of those, the Canadian versions beat the domestic pressings, but only very slightly. The UK pressings seem to be of higher quality than both Canada and US, with less noise and a blacker background.\n\nRegarding the mono/stereo differences of Jump For Joy and Things Are Swingin', you will notice a greater difference for the latter, which is somewhat surprising because it features a much smaller ensemble than the former. I became familiar with the songs of Things Are Swingin' from a stereo pressing, so when I finally heard a mono copy, the performances felt so different that my ears tricked me into thinking that I was listening to an album filled with alternate takes, when really that is not the case (except for \"You're Mine, You\").\n\nThe main difference between the mono/stereo versions of Jump For Joy is that the stereo lacks the weight or punch of the mono - the percussion and rhythm are not as easily heard in the stereo, although the timbre of the brass and strings have a delicious texture in the stereo that is less noticeable in the mono. In short, the mono has a more balanced and cohesive presentation, and the stereo has more space and air to it. Peggy's vocal sounds better on the stereo version, so both copies are required listening.\n\nI'd like to find a copy of the French reissue of I Like Men! someday.\n\nI haven't played Christmas Carousel yet. Children singing? No! Charming in reality, but I don't want it on a record!\n\nSome of the ones you've listed haven't done much for me. I don't like Big Spender as a song and the album didn't thrill me. Same with Guitars... I enjoyed Mink Jazz. Blues Cross Country was a bit disappointing because it's not very bluesy! I can't remember In Love Again. Liked In The Name Of Love. I really like Got That Magic from one of those, but I have that on 45. Pass Me By doesn't do much for me. Great opening track but then the dreadful title track follows it!\n\nI do think there's a drop in quality with Peggy from the mid 60s, not that she went bad, but didn't get near the standard of the Decca era or Pretty Eyes again. But she was over 20 years into an incredibly prolific career by then and she was still good. The late 60s LPs don't sound very interesting. I haven't heard any album I've disliked though. To be honest I feel uncomfortable being negative about any Peggy LP. I've deliberately stopped at Mirrors. I don't get the impression there's much artistically after that and I don't want to hear a real decline.\n\nI'm not a minimalist with records, I find room somehow! I just like too much music to be. I do have regular clearouts though and get rid of the ones I have no connection with. I don't see Peggy's ever going that way.\n\nPeggy has more albums than most artists in my collection, but she released a lot more too. I also have a lot of Dylan, The Who, Beatles, Queen, Neil Young and Bowie. Whenever I have a lot by an artist I get a case for their records so they don't have a massive amount of shelving taken up with a few artists.\n\nI must get a mono If You Go...\n\nBlues Cross Country was probably my least favourite of the bunch. I found it very disappointing, indeed. The only Quincy Jones album that I've enjoyed to such an extent as to consider essential is Vaughan and Violins.\n\nI wonder if I'd enjoy Then Was Then and Now Is Now - I may have to consider giving that one a chance, and perhaps the albums from the early 1970s.\n\nFab, fab, fab, fab ...\n\n[Fab four times -- that's what I say. Four or five times.]\n\nI mean: yours is a fab list of albums.\n\nSacrilege!\n\nJust kidding.\n\nIt was interesting to read how you have developed such an extensive Peggy Lee collection in a relatively short time.\n\nThank you. Nice to feel useful and helpful!\n\nThat's the right attitude. Incidentally, your words brought to mind a song that Peggy wrote: \"Life's for Living.\" (It's in the Things Are Swingin' album.)\n\nTaking a close look at your collection now ... From the Capitol years, the only LPs you don't have, if I am not mistaken, are those which were never released in the United Kingdom. Since they all happen to be from the late 1960s and early 1970s, I don't know if they will be of your interest. We will hopefully get to discuss all of them here, in due time. For the time being, I want to make a point about this one:\n\nIn this case, the better option is the CD (instead of the LP), for several reasons. First of all, the rarity of this LP translates into high asking prices. More importantly, the CD gives you much better sound quality and also 12 bonus tracks, many of them quite rare.\n\nGoing back to Decca, you now have all the LPs except for another one that was never issued in the UK, and an album that perhaps you fear will be too child-oriented (per your comment about Christmas Carousel):\n\nLeaving those albums aside, and taking into account that most of us tend to enjoy that period of Peggy's career so much ... Are you all set now, or are you considering to acquire every single song from that period? I imagine that there is very little Decca material for you to collect. Just a few songs ... Here is one that comes to mind (because I happened to come across this clip a couple of days ago):\n\nWhen I read that Peggy holds the record of most albums in your collection, I almost fell to pieces. Crazy, man, crazy. [Of course, I am sure that you'd be inCLINEd to retort that it's a matter of numbers and proportion: Peggy happened to make many, many more records than a certain all-time great country-pop singer, whose life was cut short much too early.]\n\nHow is the Pure Pleasure version of Peggy's The Man I Love? Are you pleased with its sound quality?\n\nAll I have to say to you is:\n\nJust kidding again. When it comes to singers who released many albums, it's only natural to like some of them less than others -- all the more so if the singers experimented with a variety of styles or musical backgrounds.\n\nMy guess is that, at the very least, you will like some of the interpretations in the mid-1960s album Then Was Then. Musically, it is a fairly cohesive strings-oriented piece, orchestrated by Sid Feller. (He is best known for being the man behind Ray Charles' career-defining albums of the 1960s, as well as his hit \"I Can't Stop Loving You,\" all material which preceded the recording of Then Was Then. His working relationship with Peggy went back to the early 1950s, however.)\n\nI am a big fan of several Blues Cross Country cuts: \"Going to Chicago Blues,\" \"Kansas City,\" \"The Train Blues\" ... I do think, though, that the LP as a whole is too brassy and loud for my own taste. It's the type of album that I enjoy playing only from time to time, and never more than once in a row. That's a very different situation from, say, Things Are Swingin', which I could probably play all day without getting tired of it.\n\nFor what is worth, I think that there are individual Quincy Jones charts that you might enjoy. Case(s) in point: the charts for both \"Hey Look Me Over\" and \"(Stay With Me) Stay With Me\" are credited to him. I believe that you like Peggy's interpretation of the former, and loved the latter in a YouTube version where she duets with Andy Williams. (The chart for that duet might not be by Quincy Jones, but it must have been derived from the one that he did do, for the studio recording) ... All that having been said, charts credited to Quincy Jones are always a big question mark, because he is rumored to have farmed out a fair amount of the stuff that was assigned to him.\n\nPEGGY LEE ON THE RADIO\n\nBack in the 1940s, radio was the thing. Singers who were active and well known made frequent appearances on radio programs. Peggy Lee was no exception. Lee was receiving offers to be a radio show host(ess) since at least 1945, when she was asked to take over Songs By Sinatra for the summer. A couple of years later, the songstress received a similar request to take the summer spot for Bing Crosby's Philco Show. She declined those two particular offers, but did accept others. In fact, Lee worked as the hostess of five radio shows (1947-1952), served as the \"girl singer\" on two others, and made guest appearances on many more.\n\nIn more recent times, a fine portion of her old-time radio vocals have found its way into commercial releases (CDs, LPs, cassettes). Herein we will point out the essential releases among those.\n\nThe most notable of the shows that this singer hosted was Club 88 Starring Peggy Lee, which ran for about a year, from late 1951 to late 1952. A generous selection of her performances from that show was issued in this officially issued 2CD set\n\nwhich has the added attraction of containing only numbers that Peggy never recorded in the studio. Consisting of 45 remastered tracks, it is easily the best of all the radio releases to be discussed in this post. A second CD, containing more performances from the same show, is rumored to be in the works.\n\nAnother radio program that Peggy Lee hosted for an extended period of time was Chesterfield's Supper Club. The two best known hosts of that daily program were actually Perry Como, who was regularly heard on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Friday since its outset (1944), and Jo Stafford, who was heard on Tuesdays and Thursdays, starring in 1945. After making quite a few guest appearances in both Perry's and Jo's installments, Peggy Lee eventually joined the Chesterfield family as a hostess, taking over the Thursday slot (1948-1949), and thus becoming the Chesterfield Supper Club's third chief host. Here is the primary CD on which her vocals from this show can be heard:\n\nThis is an unofficial but decent-sounding CD, released by a worthwhile British collector's label. You will hear Peggy's radio versions of mostly songs that she had recorded for Capitol (e.g., \"Waiting for the Train to Come in,\" \"I'm Glad I Waited for You\"). You will also hear her sing a few numbers that she did not do in the studio (e.g., \"I Cried for You,\" \"Can't Help Lovin' That Man\"). And, as suggested by the front cover, we get to hear her in duets with Dean Martin and Frankie Laine, too. \"Our gal\" does not sing in nine of the CD's tracks, but you still get plenty of Peggalee, because there are 29 tracks in this disc.\n\nThe Summer Electric Hour was the name of one of the other Lee radio shows from which CDs and LPs have been compiled. This 1947 program was actually co-hosted by Peggy with her Capitol label mate Woody Herman. You can hear tracks from the program in many unofficial CDs, in which such radio numbers are usually mixed up with studio recordings and even television tracks. The original release from which all the low-cut CDs appropriated the radio numbers is this collectors' LP, from the UK:\n\nNext up in this overview is a CD that is worthwhile because, unlike the previously mentioned items, it gives you the full radio broadcasts, rather than selected numbers from them. (Or maybe I should say that the CD gives you versions of the full radio broadcasts ... I'll leave it at that, lest I end up complicating my comments too much.)\n\nTo be more specific, this CD consists of one full episode of The Summer Electric Hour (on which Andre Previn guested) and three episodes of Club 88 Starring Peggy Lee.\n\nFinally, we have the following release:\n\nwhich has been issued by more than one collectors' label, and which can be found on several formats -- CD, LP, cassette. It is another case of a release that gives you full episodes of the radio shows -- in this case, one episode from Club 88 Starring Peggy Lee and one episode of a program that we have not mentioned yet, The Peggy Lee Rexall Show (1951). Peggy's guests on these broadcasts were bandleaders Tommy Dorsey and Benny Goodman. Some of the song choices are ditties that were chart hits at the time, and others are standards.\n\nIn addition to the above, you can track down many radio CDs and LPs by other artists, on which Peggy can be heard as a guest artist. Of those, the most important ones contain her extensive work with Bing Crosby and Jimmy Durante .......... But I won't go into that topic any further, because this post is already very long. (If anyone is curious or interested, we can certainly cover it in subsequent messages, of course.)\n\nLet's close with the titular track from one of the aforementioned releases:\n\nNext up: at last, indeed. We are ready to get into the Capitol world of Peggy Lee, which spanned several decades (1944-1972). We will be talking first about recommended boxed sets, which seems a timely topic, since Man at C&A was just talking about one of them.\n\nGreat stuff, yet again! I've just picked up the live 1947 - 1952 CD cheap.\n\nIt's a bit annoying that the At Last - Lost Radio Recordings CD is always overpriced (£30 on Amazon). I enjoy the radio recordings but don't really want to pay a lot for them or the rest of the stuff outside of Peggy's core catalogue - the stuff released at the time.\n\nI also cannot find an affordable copy of The Lost Capitol Masters anywhere which is a shame as it appears that along with the Decca era covering Classics and Collectibles, it will complement the Singles Collection 4CD set very well. I think that's the last thing I'll need. Of course I'll be missing tracks but that's OK, there's so much to get and it's going to take too much buying of CDs for one or two tracks.\n\nIs anybody on this thread the person who is compiling the complete Peggy Lee singles onto CD and writes the superb and very informative reviews on Amazon of Peggy's CDs?\n\nIt sounds so good that I parted with my original Canada pressing. The reproduction of the cover art doesn't look as nice on the reissue, but the disc sounds great!\n\n\"I Can't Stop Loving You\" having been written by the sad poet himself, the great Don Gibson. I was very pleased when I first learned that Peggy performed this number.\n\nYes, our tastes are similar. My biggest problem with Blues Cross Country is that it's too brassy. There's plenty of brass on Things Are Swingin', too, but the execution is different. Like you, I could listen to the latter all day, although I can live without the former. I recall thinking that In Love Again! (the bright side) and Sugar 'n' Spice had the same stylistic issue as Blues Cross Country - the arrangements are just too loud for my taste. Again, though, I'd like to stress this is not a Peggy Lee problem, and just a matter of my own tastes. (Albums in the same style by other artists fall on my deaf ears too - Julie London's Send For Me being another example. Awful.)\n\nCorrect; I enjoy \"Hey, Look Me Over\" because I feel that it effectively captures the essence of what Peggy's live concerts were like during the early to mid 1960s."
