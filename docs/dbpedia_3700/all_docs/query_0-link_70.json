It's often said that artists from one genre can't capture the heart and soul of the other. Many bluegrass musicians play by ear, without classical training, and their music is passed down from generation to generation with a certain degree of rusticity in a folkloric fashion. Proficient sight-reading classical musicians focus on technique, tone and timing, often to make them better orchestra musicians. Time for Three is a bold and courageous trio of young musicians with two violins and upright bass. Zachary DePue, Nicolas Kendall, and Ranaan Meyer met and formed the trio while enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music. Their self-titled debut album was released in late-2002. They perform regularly, at a variety of venues and festivals, and with many symphony orchestras. Their chutzpah is both a mix of strong self-assurance with a little impudence on the side. Thus, this pluckish trio is proving to be wildly entertaining.\n\nWith considerable shows under their belts, their repertoire shows that these lyrical players can continue to evoke great emotional electricity. It's interesting to compare this 2006 live concert with many of the same old-time fiddling, bluegrass, Gypsy and classical pieces released just over three years before. I don't sense any boredom in their playing of the selections. If anything, their youthful exuberance many push a few of them (\"Csardas\" or \"Ragtime Annie\" or \"Orange Blossom Special\") into high-stepping tempos that certainly have plenty of get-up-and-go but may actually lose some of their emotion and passion as a result of their speed.\n\nOpening with \"Shenandoah,\" their considerable pluck and fine bow work transition into a Ranaan Meyer's original, \"Foxdown.\" Father of Bluegrass Bill Monroe's \"Jerusalem Ridge\" about an area he hunted for fox near Rosine, Ky. is given a snappy arrangement with such tempo that the Celtic sounds that Monroe wanted to reflect with the minor key have been sacrificed for improvisational jazz-like sensibilities. As with their earlier album, Meyer's bass and some train sound effects provide the prelude for an \"Orange Blossom Special\" that is then propelled into a locomotive mood. Time for Three's live 2006 show only offered Jay Ungar's \"Ashoken Farewell\" (used as the theme for the PBS Civil War series), instead of incorporating it into a medley with \"Amazing Grace\" as they'd done before. Smooth handling of their violin bows allow the virtuoso musicians to intimately convey Ranaan Meyer's original \"Thunderstomp,\" a highlight of this concert. \"The Bach Double\" features just DePue and Kendall in a warm, weaving conversation, while Brahm's \"Hungarian Dance No. 5\" moves at a fast clip. They used to have a longer arrangement that segued from solo bass to the selection's rhythmic intensity.\n\nThe eclectic trio Time for Three demonstrates power, virtuosity, cohesion, and kinship. They would clearly be role models to other younger musicians taking up strings. They have some standard crowd-pleasers that are presented live. I encourage them to continue writing their own music, looking for new material to arrange, and pushing the envelope into uncharted territory. A faculty member at their alma mater, award-winning composer Jennifer Higdon, has been commissioned to create a contemporary work for the trio, scheduled to premier in early 2008. And, as they move quickly to even greater acclaim, I hope Time For Three won't be afraid to slow down just a tad to tap the emotional depth and personalities of some of the more familiar or less challenging melodies that they've played for years. (Joe Ross)\n\nANDY THORN -\n\nBolin Creek\n\nThornpipe Productions, No number\n\nhttp://www.myspace.com/andythornbluegrass\n\nEMAIL Athorn82@yahoo.com\n\nPlaying Time - 50:49\n\nSONGS - Bolin Creek, I Wonder How The Old Folks Are At Home, The Only Survivor, Garris, All That I Can Take, Old Cold Waltz, Leavin' Town, Winter's Mourning, Up Above, The Snake, Sundog, Shape I'm In, Star of Munster, Tumbleweed\n\nTony Trischka advises us to \"keep our eyes and ears on\" young twenty-something progressive banjo-player Andy Thorn from Durham, NC. Thorn's debut album, recorded in his living room over the course of a 4-day period in late-2005, gives us a taste of his proficient playing, enthusiastic singing, and competent songwriting. Back in the old days, recording an album at this point in a musician's career would be cost-prohibitive, but the availability of inexpensive home recording equipment has now changed that. Besides convening some hot pickers, the 2003 Rockygrass banjo champion (and band contest winner) has also brought his performing experience with the Broke Mountain Bluegrass Band, Big Fat Gap, UNC Jazz Band and Larry Keel to the table. With minimal overdubbing on \"Bolin Creek,\" Thorn organized quite a bunch with considerable pedigree of their own -- Larry Keel (guitar), Jenny Keel (bass), John Garris (fiddle), Mark Schimick (mandolin), Jon Stickley (guitar) and Travis Book (bass). These pickers are making their names with such up-and-coming groups as Natural Bridge, Steep Canyon Rangers, Biscuit Burners, Big Fat Gap and The Stringdusters.\n\nBesides Andy singing lead on his own \"All That I Can Take\" and \"Tumbleweed,\" various other lead vocalists are called upon - Larry Keel, Lauren Craig, Rick Hauchman, Mark Schimick, and Miles Andrews. If there's a shortcoming on this album, it's that the vocals just aren't up to the same standard as some of the instrumental prowess demonstrated on original tunes like the title cut, \"Garris,\" \"Winter's Mourning,\" \"Sundog,\" or J.D. Crowe's \"Leavin Town.\" Check out the triplets that Andy plays on the Irish reel, \"Star of Munster.\" There's a wide representation of banjodom here, and Andy's nimble-fingered techniques are very sound with hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, bends, and rolls providing plenty of pluck. There's also some very impassioned guitar, mandolin, fiddle and bass work on the album. In the right hands, some of the original vocal numbers (e.g. \"Up Above\" or \"Old Cold Waltz\") would be better served with fresh voices covering them. Stickley's snare drum and whistle also appear in \"Tumbleweed,\" that has a refreshing melody but suffers from some lyrical banality. Johnny Rivers' \"The Snake\" was done by Bill Emerson and Cliff Waldron back in the 1960s who may have been looking for the same kind of cross-genre success they achieved with their cover of Manfred Mann's \"Fox on the Run.\" Andy and company just don't quite cut it the way Emerson and Waldron did. Still, there's plenty of overall good-time energy and spirit on \"Bolin Creek.\" I can tell they had loads of fun making this CD, and Andy has also made a very commanding statement about his potential. Like the quilt-draped furniture and walls in his living room, Andy Thorn shows a fondness for a patchwork of sounds that have a strong jamgrass footing. (Joe Ross)\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS -\n\nCelebration of Life: Musicians Against Childhood Cancer\n\nSkaggs Family Records 6989090012\n\nPO Box 2478, Hendersonville, TN. 37077\n\nwww.bluegrassclassic.com OR www.skaggsfamilyrecords.com\n\nPlaying Time - 71:47 (CD#1); 68:37 (CD#2)\n\nIt's easy to see how this 2-CD album has become one of bluegrass music's top ten releases in 2006. Drawing material recorded live at the 2000-2005 Musicians Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Festival in Columbus, Ohio, the project was inspired by executive producer and musician Darrel Adkins. He and his wife Phyllis' beautiful 22-year-old daughter, Mandy, lost her battle to cancer (brain cell tumor) in 2000. The non-profit MACC was formed, and the festival was launched to raise funds for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tn. where treatment is dispensed for children with terminal illness. Volunteering to play the July festival, 136 artists are featured here. Most all of the big names in bluegrass are featured - Rhonda Vincent, Grascals, Keeny & Amanda Smith Band, Wildfire, Lost & Found, Larry Stephenson Band, Cherryholmes, Doyle Lawson, Tony Rice, J.D. Crowe, 3 Fox Drive, Marty Raybon, Blue Highway, Alecia Nugent, Lonesome River Band, Seldom Scene, and many more. Liner notes clearly lay out the pickers and singers on each song.\n\nThere are some entertaining pickup groups featured too. A 7-minute version of \"Freeborn Man\" features Dan Tyminski, Tony Rice, Bela Fleck, Doyle Lawson and Barry Bales. Of similar length, a bluegrass instrumental version of Gershwin's \"Summertime\" stars Bryan Sutton, David Talbot, Ashby Frank, Terry Smith, Aubrey Haynie and Randy Kohrs. Tony Rice introduces and dedicates his 11-minute solo and reflective rendition of \"Shenandoah,\" with a declaration that \"every musician is right here exactly where we are supposed to be doing this.\"\n\nThis album has a ton of first-rate and captivating variety from the bluegrass community, but I took special note of each and every song that conveyed sentiments that could be construed as tributes to the memory and inspiration of Mandy Adkins. Alan Bibey made a point of dedicating his own \"Side by Side\" to Mandy. As Kenny & Amanda Smith sing, \"I know this love will last forever, I know where loves lives, someday we'll always be together, living in Him.\" Kudos to Jack Campitelli and Bob Kelley for a fine job of recording, mixing and mastering the 37-tracks of absorbing music without any significant audience applause or background noise. Mandy would be very gratified by the result, and bluegrass music and this festival will just grow even stronger. Why? In \"The Healing Kind\" written by himself and Greg Luck, Ronnie Bowman sings \"the pain just grows stronger everyday, I think of you and I'm on my way, down memory lane with your hand in mine, ÂŒcuz I'm just not the healing kind.\" (Joe Ross)\n\nRICKY SKAGGS & KENTUCKY THUNDER -\n\nInstrumentals\n\nSkaggs Family Records 6989010072\n\nPO Box 2478, Hendersonville, TN. 37077\n\nwww.skaggsfamilyrecords.com\n\nTEL. 615-952-9250 OR 615-264-8877\n\nPlaying Time - 47:32\n\nI assumed that all eleven of these instrumentals were written by Ricky Skaggs because liner notes didn't provide tune credits. A little info from the label's publicist indicated that nine are new compositions by multiple Grammy award-winner Skaggs. Also, the CD jacket for this band's first-ever all-instrumental project has the entire seven-piece band on the cover, but a few of the regular members appear to be missing in the musical mix. Bios for Darrin Vincent and Paul Brewster are provided, but I don't see them listed in the credits. We do hear Ricky Skaggs (guitar, clawhammer banjo, mandolin, percussion), Jim Mills (banjo), Cody Kilby (guitar), Andy Leftwich (fiddle) and Mark Fain (bass). Guests include Jeff Taylor (accordion, whistle), Andy Statman (clarinet), and the Nashville String Machine with orchestration by Jim Gray on one cut.\n\nNo one can doubt the astonishing fluency with which these string practitioners speak. While they have a strong preference for moderate-tempo'ed offerings, they manage to create an eclectic state of musical mind with tastes of old-time, Celtic, bluegrass, Dawg, blues, jazz and classical idioms. Green hues of the Land of the Shamrock color compositions like \"Going to Richmond\" and \"Goin to the Ceili.\" If a fusion of Celtic and Classical sounds are your cup o' tea, listen to the embellished brogue provided by the Nashville String Machine on \"Crossing the Briney.\" With the band \"playing their thoughts\" in a manner similar to how fiddler Vassar Clements used to, \"Missing Vassar\" establishes a hillbilly jazz groove based on a recurring lick that honors that musical philosopher. With a copious amount of respect for another mandolinist (David Grisman), Ricky Skaggs and the boys lay a hot little tune, \"Dawg's Breath,\" on us. The melody inhales and exhales with precision, bounce and pizzazz. When \"Gallatin Rag\" begins, as on a few others, we clearly hear the only minimal shortcoming in this album's music - some distraction caused by Ricky's pick on his fingerboard. Statman embellishes that offering with some euphonious clarinet. In Statman's hands, it becomes clear why the instrument was once affectionately called the \"hot licorice stick\" among swing musicians in the 1930s and 40s.\n\nAll in all, this album is a tasteful tune set with several interpretive twists along the way. Performed by exceptional musicians, the composite is a product that would make Bill Monroe proud. They don't betray their bluegrass pedigree. Rather, their adventurous vision provides a treasure trove of unique tunes. I'd like to see some music notation and/or tablature for them so I can learn a few favorites. (Joe Ross)\n\nKENNY & AMANDA SMITH BAND -\n\nTell Someone\n\nRebel CD-1821\n\nwww.kenny-amandasmith.com or www.rebelrecords.com\n\nPlaying Time - 39:38\n\nKenny Smith started his music career playing Southern Gospel music in churches. His rock solid guitar work with the Lonesome River Band from 1995-2001 twice led to his winning IBMA's \"Guitar Player of the Year.\" Smith's solo project, \"Studebaker,\" showcased his fine songwriting and wife's soulful singing. A couple years have now passed since Kenny and Amanda turned plenty of heads with their defining bluegrass album, \"Slowly but Surely\" (Farm Boy FBR-1001), that included band members Ronald Inscore, Jason Moore, Steve Huber, and Ron Stewart. It helped formulate the band's original, contemporary sound characterized by beautiful vocals, expert picking, solid arrangements, excellent repertoire, and high recording quality. It also resulted in the band winning IBMA's 2002 Emerging Artist of the Year award.\n\nA couple years later in 2004, the versatile Kenny & Amanda Smith Band debuted on Rebel Records with their 2004 \"House Down The Block\" project. Now, in 2006, their first gospel CD, \"Tell Someone,\" introduces us to three new young musicians in the band - Jason Robertson (mandolin), Jason Davis (banjo), Zachary McLamb (bass). All three are very solid instrumentalists, but one minor complaint is that I can hear some of McLamb's strings snapping on the fingerboard of his bass, particularly on the up-tempo numbers. While some of that would be acceptable in a secular bluegrass set, it can be a bit distracting in a spiritually-tinged gospel set. Daniel Carwiles fiddles on seven of the tracks. Most of the band's vocal arrangements are sparse with only Kenny's tenor harmony below Amanda's lead vocal, but six tracks add a third harmony line courtesy of Rhonda Vincent (1 cut) or Wayne Winkle (5 cuts). The opening cut, \"Shoutin' Time,\" illustrates the similarity between Amanda's and Rhonda's voices as they trade lead vocals on the first and second verses. Laying vocal harmonies in below Amanda's high lead gives the band a personalized sound.\n\nThe album features standards that Kenny and Amanda sang while growing up in church while also showcasing strong and effective compositions from more contemporary songwriters such as Craig Market's \"Mary Had A Little Boy,\" Clay Hess' \"I Know Why,\" and Richard Gulley's \"Till I Get Home.\" The intent of making this CD was clearly for Kenny and Amanda to reach out and touch people by sharing messages of their Christian faith. Their poignant closer, \"Tell Someone How Precious He Is,\" embodies the overriding theme of their ministry through music. While they had been planning to record a gospel album for over a decade, the impetus for the album was provided when Kenny's father died in a tractor accident in March, 2006. With their calm assurance and devout belief, they are ready to face tomorrow and the continued opportunities and challenges that life will bring.

This country boy from Wise County, Va. was born into a large family that played music and sang in church. After he and his brothers won a band contest sponsored by the Stanley Brothers, Jack went to work as the bass player with Carter and Ralph from 1955-57 (picking up a bass for $15 or $20 from Mike Seeger). After over four years playing guitar or bass with Bill Monroe, Jack Cooke formed his own band (Virginia Mountain Boys) in Baltimore. There, up above Johnny's used car lot, he recorded some albums (on the Wango label) with the Stanley Brothers, calling themselves John's Gospel Quartet. This current album being reviewed ends with two bonus tracks of archived material recorded in 1963 (with Bill Sage, Roy Hoskins, Bobby Diamond). \"Let Me Rest at the End of My Journey\" and \"I've Always Been a Rambler\" illustrate what his band and voice sounded like over 40 years ago. In late-1969, Jack went back to work with Ralph Stanley and has been with him ever since. With good range and an ear for harmony, Jack can sing all parts.\n\nOn his first day of the job, Ralph Stanley asked Jack to handle the record sales. It's something he's successfully done without any pretenses or insincerity for years. He comes across as a man with empathy, kindness and understanding. His roots run deep to old-time mountain and bluegrass music. He doesn't believe in any fancy stuff or in taking the music \"uptown.\" Jack once said, \"A lot of people is ashamed to tell how they was raised and everything, I believe. But a man ought to tell it like it is. Got to keep it country. Keep it mountainous.\"\n\nWhat's so nice about this project is that it casts Jack Cooke into the spotlight. He's no longer just a sideman, a guy who was once a Blue Grass Boy with Bill Monroe or the long-time cornerstone in Ralph Stanley's band. Vernon Crawford \"Jack\" Cooke is now a solo artist who sings on all tracks and plays rhythm guitar on a couple too. Appropriately, his album opens with \"Gotta Travel On,\" a song he once cut with Bill Monroe years before (12/1/58 in Nashville to be exact). And, second up is one of his signature songs that showcases his piercing tenor vocals, Webb Pierce's \"I'm Walking the Dog.\" Jack may have been the first singer to adapt the song to bluegrass, and he is joined by Del McCoury's harmony vocals. Going way back, Del had been a Virginia Mountain Boy before he went to work for Monroe. This \"Sittin' on Top of the World\" album was produced by Jim Lauderdale who wrote \"That's How the Cookie Crumbles\" and who appears in the mix of three other cuts. Besides Del and Jim, other friends assisting include Ralph Stanley, Ralph Stanley II, James Shelton, Todd Meade, Steve Sparkman, Ronnie McCoury, Robbie McCoury, Jason Carter, Mike Bub, David Grisman, and Hubert & Jeanette Cooke.\n\nNot so long ago, Jack Cooke was a young musician living in an exciting time and learning from the impressionable Monroe and Stanley. Now, he's the mentor, and his relaxed and enthusiastic singing of bluegrass, country and gospel numbers will influence others. In a sense, he's passing on his genuine, honest music tradition to the next generation and showing ÂŒem how it was done. Over the decades, Jack's been approached many times to do his own album. I wish it would've happened sooner rather than later, but I reckon that finally getting it done makes for a good 70th birthday gift to himself, his family ... and us. With abundant rusticity, Jack Cooke's solo album reveals a devotion to a powerful mountain sound that is unadorned and down-to-earth ... just like Jack. (Joe Ross)\n\nTHE CIRCUIT RIDERS -\n\nLet the Ride Begin\n\nPinecastle PRC-1154\n\nwww.pinecastle.com OR www.thecircuitriders.com OR\n\nwww.darinaldridge.com OR www.myspace.com/tcrpg\n\nPlaying Time - 45:00\n\nLonesome Wind, Powderfinger, Mama, What Does Heaven Look Like There, Take Me Back To Old Kentucky, Seeds Of Doubt, Foggy Mountain Special, Colder And Colder, In The Master's Glory, Katie and Burl, Ten Years, Pickett's Charge, The Fall, Cold Wind\n\nThe Circuit Riders' \"Let the Ride Begin\" is a strong debut album that earns accolades for a smooth, contemporary approach to bluegrass. Presumably adopting a band name to reflect the lifestyle of a working band, the quintet from North Carolina can impart an exhilarating gallop to Neil Young's \"Powderfinger\" or a slow cantor to yet another contribution from the prolific songwriting team of Dixie and Tom T. Hall, \"Mama What Does Heaven Look Like There?\" About a traveling musician, \"Colder and Colder\" is a beautiful song but seems to slightly challenge singer Greg Luck's low vocal range on the verses. Overall, the band's vocals are burnished and calibrated, and their instrumental interaction provides a model of competence and intelligence.\n\nAs a band, The Circuit Riders evolved from former members of the last version of The Country Gentlemen with Charlie Waller prior to his passing. While Randy Waller has reorganized The Country Gentlemen, former members Greg Corbett (banjo), Darin Aldridge (mandolin), and Billy Gee (bass) formed The Circuit Riders with Greg Luck (guitar) and Jaret Carter (resophonic guitar). Luck wrote \"Lonesome Wind\" and \"The Fall\" for this album. Aldridge penned \"Seeds of Doubt\" and \"Ten Years.\" Lead vocalists are mainly sung by Luck or Aldridge, but Carter delivers them on \"Take Me Back to Old Kentucky.\" Carter's \"Pickett's Charge\" is a smoldering instrumental inspired by a famous Civil War battle. Another classic instrumental, \"Foggy Mountain Special,\" clearly shows that Corbett has cut his teeth on the picking of Earl Scruggs, and he also shows that he has mastered the technique for rolling triplets too.\n\nGreg Luck has played with such groups as Redwing, Lost & Found, Bass Mountain Boys, Lynn Morris Band, Bluegrass Cardinals, J.D. Crowe & the New South, and IIIrd Tyme Out. Not just a solid guitarist, he contributes some elegant fiddling on two cuts on this project, \"Mama What Does Heaven Look Like There?\" and \"Pickett's Charge.\" After playing with his family band and New Vintage, North Carolinian Greg Corbett spent 13 years as a Country Gentleman. In 1996, he took home the SPBGMA Banjo Player of the Year award. Darin Aldridge has experience playing music in various genres (country, jazz, folk, rock) and was with The Country Gentlemen for seven years. Listen to how he embellishes Luck's \"The Fall\" with bouzouki and mandola. Darin has also released a solo album, \"Call It A Day\" on the Pinecastle label. Jaret Carter also has experience playing country-rock, jazz and blues, and he gives about 50 private music lessons each week. Billy Gee was born and raised in La Plata, Md. but currently lives in North Carolina where he operates a guitar repair business. On this album, Wes Powers plays percussion on two cuts. \"Let the Ride Begin\" is a very convincing entree from The Circuit Riders. (Joe Ross)\n\nCROSS-EYED ROSIE -\n\nAdjusted\n\nUOR-002\n\nwww.crosseyedrosie.com\n\nPlaying Time - 42:18\n\nAchieving success as a band is as much about attitude as it is about the music itself. With their second album, \"Adjusted,\" band members of Oregon-based Cross-Eyed Rosie show that they have the right disposition about music being an important and satisfying part of their lives. Fully engaged in both traditional and original songs, Cross-Eyed RosieÂ¹s collective energy is productive, and you could say that the quintet is getting well-adjusted. The seed for the bandÂ¹s formation was planted when friends started jamming weekly at a coffee shop, and itÂ¹s well documented that caffeine and crowds help with attitude adjustment too. Throw in the frenetic energy of \"Moonbeams & Kerosene,\" along with some \"Wheatfield,\" \"Cowboy,\" and \"Little Switzerland,\" and youÂ¹ve got a surefire recipe for a progressive bluegrass buzz. TheyÂ¹ve also balanced their set by including some instrumentals such as \"Sophie's Reel.\"\n\nWorking to make the music as fun as possible for all, their uniqueness draws from the varied backgrounds of the band members. After Zoe Kaplan left the group in 2005, they had to regroup a bit. The band now includes Allison Longstreth (lead vocals), Lincoln Crockett (lead vocals, mandolin), Ellie Holzemer (fiddle, vocals), Jon Ostrom (guitar), and Jason Mellow (bass, vocals). Guests Erik Yates and Dale Adkins provide banjo on two cuts. Band members have a number of musical aspirations. With classical voice training, Allison has Kentucky roots and dreams of a musical career. Lincoln wants to perform more solo shows around Portland. Jon handles booking for the band, and he'd like to see even more gigs roll in for Cross-Eyed Rosie. Ellie hopes to someday be mistaken for Laurie Lewis or Alison Krauss. From Pennsylvania, Jason has spent the last decade building a fulfilling lifestyle in Oregon that balances music and family commitments.\n\nProbably learned from Iris Dement's rendition of \"I Don't Want to Get Adjusted,\" Longstreth sings about getting to a better home sooner or later. In a similar vein, I encourage Cross-Eyed Rosie to persevere and not grow old and weary. In \"Great High Mountain,\" the band sings \"The higher I got the harder I climbed, I'm still climbing upward ÂŠ\" Hard work, determination and a little musical tightening will bring Cross-Eyed Rosie even greater success. While their music is building them a legion of young, exuberant fans, they just need to keep telling themselves that they are outstanding people capable of achieving their lofty goals. They don't need to settle for being runner up for Best Local Band in Willamette Week's Readers Poll. And, if they go to Telluride again, I hope they enter and win the band contest there. I admire Cross-Eyed Rosie for their positive and upbeat music that is full of optimism and cheerfulness. They have planted plenty of seeds for growth and opportunity. Remember, music is better when you have a good attitude. Already well above the mediocrity that marks many young bands, Cross-Eyed Rosie is climbing the musical ladder to magnificence. They have the tools. While this is a strong outing, look for them to reach even higher and get even better \"adjusted\" on future albums.

There are some pieces that start with whispering sentiments (\"Valsa em Si\"), while others convey much more heated and fiery exchanges (\"Desvairada\"). With a healthy portion of five original pieces (Egypt, Ham & Mike, New Words, Pra Sempre, Valsa em Si), this album also illustrates the exceptional songwriting abilities of the pair.\n\nMike Marshall's innovative playing has been well-documented in the past with such bands or artists as Psychograss, Chris Thile, Edgar Meyer, Darol Anger, Jovino Santos Neto and Choro Famoso. At the 2004 Lunel, France Mandolin Festival, another artist-in-residence was 30-year-old Brazilian music master Hamilton de Holanda. The collaborative communication of Mike's \"new words', with Ham's \"novas palavras\", illustrate a fluency that results in smoothly flowing, expressive music. Why, there's even some verbal scat to close \"Sao Jorge.\"\n\nMike adeptly plays mandolin on all but three tracks where he picks mandocello or tenor guitar to convey different moods. Hamilton plays the 10-string bandolim except on three tracks where he picks Irish bouzouki. Without any low end or percussion in the mix, it's hard to say how radio-friendly the dialogue is, and that may discourage some DJs from spinning such a disc. However, in such an artist collaboration, the sparsity of sound actually provides much of its spark. It allows us to focus on the masters bantering and hear all the new words clearly. Take \"Ham & Mike,\" for example, with the two voices having a rather sparkling discussion. It was perfect motivational background music for a busy day at work. At times, there are so many words (notes) being exchanged, that the conversations become a tad difficult to comprehend. The sheer extent of this body of music, that also includes a 3-track DVD recorded at the 2005 Savannah Music Festival, is somewhat mind-boggling. Being a good listener will allow you to appreciate how a standard fiddle tune like \"Blackberry Blossom\" can segue into Ernesto Nazareth's classic choro \"Apanhei-te Cavaquinho.\" It's a small world now, and taking a trip from Appalachia to Brazil is not that hard to fathom. But then throw in stops along the way in Mike Marshall's \"Egypt,\" Bela Fleck's \"Big Country,\" or on the beautiful Azorean island of \"Sao Jorge,\" and you'll appreciate both the worldy and wordy aspects of this album's healthy musical and innovative discourse. (Joe Ross)\n\nELLIS PAUL -\n\nEssentials\n\nPhilo 11671-1250-2\n\nOne Camp Street, Cambridge, MA. 02140\n\nInfo@rounder.com\n\nwww.rounder.com\n\nPlaying Time - 1:16:46 (CD#1), 1:07:30 (CD#2)\n\nWow, what a body of material to get an historical overview of Ellis Paul' songwriting for the past twenty years. He has many many kinds of songs over the years - folk, love, pop, story, rock, and even novelty songs. This 2-CD set with nearly two and one-half hours of music deserves close listening and analysis of melodies, lyrics, messages, and arrangements. He's worked with seven producers over the years and many more musicians.\n\nPaul attributes \"Conversation With A Ghost\" (released in 1992) as the first song that brought people out to the clubs of Boston to hear him play. Folksinger Bill Morrissey was producing his music back then. Most recently in 2006, his \"American Jukebox Fables\" album was produced by Flynn, and there are several cuts from that project on this compilation. There is some previously unreleased material on \"Essentials\" too, including some live material from some 2006 shows in Mass. and Maine. Reviewing this project a week before Christmas, I especially enjoyed \"Snow in Austin,\" a Texas Christmas song. Another unreleased song was an attention-grabber entitled \"Welcome Home To Maine,\" a writing assignment about his birthplace and its features for the Maine Governor. John Jennings produced some of the newest material for \"Essentials\" with The Best of Band that included Paul and Jennings, along with J. T. Brown, Dave Mattacks, Don Conoscenti, and Rachel Davis contributing background vocals on one cut.\n\nFrom the stock of Maine potato farmers, Ellis Paul moved to Boston, studied music, connected with the roots of the folk genre, then proceeded to develop a signature singer/songwriter sound that now incorporates pop, rock and contemporary sensibilities. Ellis Paul's wise perceptiveness and charisma have built him a strong fan base. He's also a hardworking, resilient touring artist who has garnered numerous awards for ten album releases and music, some of which has been featured in soundtracks for the films, Shallow Hal and Me, Myself, & Irene.\n\nEllis' voice has much character, and his songs understand the bond between land, life, heart and soul. Most are slower to moderate tempo'ed, and Ellis does particular well creating an intimate and familiar feeling with some songs. Keyboards and percussion provide the primary instrumental excitement that serve to increase the emotional impact of his later material. I would've enjoyed more vocal harmony in his arrangements.\n\nEllis possesses all the fundamental elements for success as a singer/songwriter. His messages are profound, and they make us think. For example, \"Home\" (from the American Jukebox Fables album) is a lover's tribute with the \"house being just an address, you're my home.\" \"Jukebox on my Grave\" leaves us with his simple wish to mark the music man's ultimate resting place. His influences are many -- Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Marvin Gaye, Johnny Cash, George Jones, Rolling Stones, Hank Williams, Buddy Holly, Patty Griffin and others. Interesting that \"Essentials\" tips his hat to Woody Guthrie tribute artists and even Woody himself \"in a sense.\" Ellis Paul's imagination and skill are both polished and fanciful all in one. He is a masterful singer/songwriter. (Joe Ross)\n\nEMMONS SISTERS -\n\nPossibilities\n\nNo label, no number\n\nhttp://www.theemmonssisters.com/\n\nPlaying Time - 51:07\n\nTomorrow's acoustic music is certainly in good hands with a group like the Oregon-based Emmons Sisters. When I first saw them perform at the 2006 Siskiyou Bluegrass Festival at Lake Selmac, Oregon, I thought to myself, \"Wow! What charisma, stage presence, and talent!\" I'm so glad that they've landed a gig at the 2007 Oregon Bluegrass Assn. Gospel Show in Roseburg. It will be a great opportunity for them to further showcase their talents. Now ranging in age from about 14-20, the four Emmons Sisters are demonstrating their growing proficiency on guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, bass and vocals. \"Possibilities\" is their third album and was recorded in 2004. The primary songwriter and lead vocalist of the bunch is Christina, and she tends to write in an introspective manner about her feelings, desires, memories, and love of God. Closer to singer/songwriter folk music than bluegrass, \"Possibilities\" will open some doors for the sisters Christina, Victoria, Natalie and Stephanie. Their songs' melodies, tempos, and arrangements suffer from some similarity, but you should certainly pick up a copy of this album. They deserve our support, encouragement, nurturing to fully achieve their great potential. I'm certain that their best is yet to come. (Joe Ross)\n\nEMMONS SISTERS -\n\nTurning Point\n\nNo label, no number\n\nhttp://www.theemmonssisters.com/\n\nPlaying Time - 40:18\n\nSince their 2004 release of \"Possibilities,\" the Oregon-based Emmons Sisters have gravitated even closer to the bluegrass idiom on their fourth album put out in 2006 called \"Turning Point.\" The liner notes begin with a strong declaration of \"Bluegrass is true music, and we've grown to love it!\" Their collaborative original, \"Here To Stay\" includes lyrics like \"People ask why we play like we do. So fast, it takes away the blues. Bluegrass music, with its lonesome sound. Just like it, we're here to stay.\" The girls only range in age from 14-20, and they exhibit a musical maturity well beyond your normal teenaged siblings today that may be more tuned into television, video games, or sports. The Emmons Sisters didn't even start performing as a band until about 2001. Their original songs incorporate standard bluegrass instruments, although the banjo is relegated to a minor role. Their energetic style has a typical formula that incorporates all of them singing in a carefully calibrated manner. While Christina did most of the songwriting and lead singing on their last album, \"Turning Point\" clearly shows the increased role that Victoria is playing in those areas. On two cuts (\"Here To Stay\" and \"Lullaby\"), Stephanie sings lead. Some eclectic variety is imparted to this album with two instrumentals, \"Dragonflies\"' and \"Braeden in the Briar.\"\n\nThe Emmons Sisters ask thoughtful questions in a number of their songs. All four girls share lead vocals in \"Joshua,\" about a friend stricken with cancer, and they inquire \"would I be as brave as he?\" In an arrangement that just has Christina singing, \"Scarlet Sins\" asks questions of a different nature such as \"where were you when He felt pain, abandonment and shame?\" The primary uncertainty of \"Waiting is All We Have\" revolves around knowing that everything is always in His perfect timing. Their title cut provides guidance when you fall down, when you break. The Emmons' inquisitive nature is one that translates easily to their singer/songwriter approach to acoustic music. They have some heart-tugging tributes like \"Tell The Whole World\" that could become the signature piece to symbolize their ministry. An a cappella \"Glory Land\" sings joyously onto the Lord, and the liner notes indicate it was arranged in the back seat of their family's car while enroute to Bible study each week. These talented, mountain songbirds kick up their heels, have some plain ol' fun, and reverently assume devout tones on this album that radiates with youthful exuberance, optimism and love of God. (Joe Ross)\n\nSILVERBIRCH -\n\nOut On A Limb\n\nNo label, No number\n\nwww.bluegrasscoot.com\n\nBluegrassCoot@aol.com\n\nTel. 705-228-8426\n\nPlaying Time - 33:33\n\nUntil recently making the acquaintance of Tom \"Ol' Coot\" McCreight, I'd never had the pleasure of hearing Silverbirch, a fine bluegrass band based in Ontario, Canada. Their 2005 album's title, \"Out On A Limb,\" represents the risk they took releasing an album of 100% all-original material. Their handpicked sound indicates that Ontario provides a fertile field for soulful bluegrass. Some of their own tunes work better than others, and I took an immediate liking to the up-tempo \"I Don't Miss You\" and evocative \"Red Creek Hill.\" It would've been nice if each songwriter provided a few sentences about their inspiration for each song. With its pro-environment message, I presume \"Red Creek Hill\" speaks to the potential environmental damage due to the $220 million Red Hill Creek Expressway's construction through 2007 that will primarily benefit long-distance truckers and land developers on Hamilton Mountain. As they sing, \"you won't hear the Red Hill Creek playing its song,\" I found it heartwarming that they were able to voice a position and take a stance about a controversial regional issue such as this in their Ontario region. Some of their other songs are just too generic to make much impact, but their two instrumentals (\"Chance of Rain\" and \"Stomp\") are excellent toe-tapping showcases, particularly for the driving banjo of Stefan VanHolten. The rest of the group includes Doug Moerschfelder (guitar), Gene Gouthro (mandolin), and Tom McCreight (bass). While no one stands out as an exceptional lead singer, Doug, Gene and Stefan share the honors. This tells me that they are working cohesively as a team, and everyone is contributing productively to the band's collective presentation. \"Follow the Son\" and \"The Pathway's End\" are gospel songs that serve both the music and their messages. When they record again, a hot guest fiddler or Dobro-player would enhance some of their material that has a traditionally-derived bluegrass cornerstone. (Joe Ross)\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS -\n\nNorth To Ontario\n\nNo label, No number\n\nwww.bluegrasscoot.com\n\nGMandogene@aol.com OR BluegrassCoot@aol.com\n\nTel. 705-435-1872 OR 705-228-8426\n\nPlaying Time - 1:03:46\n\nI wish that every State, Region, Country throughout the world would produce hour-long compilation samplers of their local bands. What a great way to get acquainted! The Canadian Province of Ontario has proven to be a hotbed of musical activity where folks have supported such collaborative ventures such as Jordy Sharp's \"Orchard Sessions\" and Tony deBoer's \"A Touch of Canada.\" Thus, guitarist/singer Gene Gouthro and bassist Tom McCreight decided it was time for a strong sampler of Ontario's bluegrass music. Gene, in fact, wrote the title cut which appears at track #7 of the twenty songs on this ambitious project. On his 2003 motorcycle trip south to the Blueridge Mountains, Gouthro realized how much his friends, family and home in Ontario meant to him.\n\nAll told, eighty musicians were involved in the making of \"North to Ontario.\" Every one of the songs is 100% Canadian original, and we even get to hear the songwriters as part of the bands in every case but one (Melissa Sherman's opening cut, \"Deal the Cards\" performed by Hard Ryde). Throughout the album, we hear many of the winners of the annual Central Canadian Bluegrass Awards presented each year in November by the Northern Bluegrass Committee. One example is Foxtail's tenor singer, Nora Galloway, who has won Best Female Vocalist in 2005 and 2006. Perhaps the best-known musician in the set is multi-instrumentalist Emory Lester who plays all instruments in a collaboration with guitarist/singer Laura Bird to close the album with Bird's \"Heavy Load.\" Lester also plays mandolin with The Project Band's title cut.\n\nThis album has sounds based in tradition. Some lead vocals and instrumental work is stronger than others, but that is to be expected. There are plenty of smooth harmonies. There are bands that sound very entertaining. For it sheer variety, it makes sense that this album was named \"Recording of the Year.\" Many of the featured bands can be seen live each year at such festivals as the River Valley Bluegrass Jamboree in August. Contact information and website links are also provided for all of the eclectic bands on \"North to Ontario.\" For a great overview of Ontario ÂŒgrass, this album is just the ticket. Ontario may have awe-inspiring natural wonders, but the region is also building a reputation for some phenomenal bluegrass music too. (Joe Ross)\n\nDUHKS -\n\nMigrations\n\nPlaying Time - 39:38\n\nThe Duhks' progressive \"neo-folk\" or \"cerebral folk\" music is best described as highly-arranged folk and Americana that draws inspiration from various genres such as old time string band, Celtic, soul, gospel, folk, and zydeco. The band was nominated for the 2005 Emerging Artist of the Year Award by the Americana Music Association. \"Migrations\" has about 2/3 of the music that their self-titled 2005 album did, but you'll find that the 11 tracks and 16-page CD jacket don't leave us feeling short-changed. In fact, the project took home the 2006 Juno Award for Roots & Traditional Album of the Year in the Group category.\n\nHailing from Winnipeg, the quintet likes to invite a few guest artists into their mix; in this case, Tim O'Brien (5 tracks), Luke Bulla (1 track), and Katie Herzig (1 track). \"Migrations\" were produced by Gary Paczosa and Tim O'Brien who suggested songs, contributed additional lyrics, and even played or sang along in Tim's case. In keeping with their successful personalized sound, we hear well-crafted, creative songs with soul-stirring vocals and striking guitar, banjo, bass, fiddle and percussion. Low whistle and Uilleann pipes also appear in their kettle of sound. Three of the five Duhks provide vocals, both lead and harmonies. Whether covering Tracy Chapman's \"Mountains O'Things\" or serving up a Zydeco-flavored \"Down to the River,\" they manage to find some novel material to infuse with their stamp. Tracy's song, of course, encourages us to \"renounce all those material things\" to save our souls. An instrumental medley of two originals with a Cape Breton tune illustrates how The Duhks blend tradition with their own individuality. Repertoire is also drawn from African-American spirituals (Turtle Dove, Moses Don't Get Lost) and Celtic-flared instrumentals (Three Fishers, The Fox And The Bee).\n\nThe band's affinity for reflective ballads with poignant lyrics capitalize on Havey's plaintive vocalizing (Heaven's My Home, Who Will Take My Place, Out of the Rain) to round out the set. \"Heaven's My Home\" provides a subtle vision for cautious optimism in a life full of trials, travails and adversity. \"Who Will Take My Place?\" was written by Dan Frechette about the Irish patriot Michael Collins but has more universal application for anyone fighting oppression. Penned by Jessee Havey, \"Out of the Rain\" provides sunny direction \"far from the pain of being tied to your back door.\"\n\nThe Duhks' are Scott Senior (percussion), Jessee Havey (vocals), Leonard Podolak (banjo, fiddle), Tania Elizabeth (fiddle, mandolin), and Jordan McConnell (guitar, whistle, pipes). Creative artistry is built around an ability to free one's own muse. The Duhks' approach allows for personal expression without belittling the very traditions that they're stretching. This successful and impressive effort was done right and with abundant rewards. Before reinventing tradition, The Duhks have obviously lived and breathed the tradition itself by knowing, respecting, and appreciating the natural graces and flowing rhythms of Celtic and folk music. It's an amazing feat for these twenty-somethings. With this strong foundation, The Duhks then incorporate their own life experience to arrange and create a signature sound. The musicians' sensory journey takes us along with joy, sorrow, inspiration, and even occasional humor.\n\nWhether serving up a beautiful, spiritual ballad or a rousing medley of reels, they manage to make each a part of greater Duhkville. With impressionistic and memorable material, this album continues presentation of The Duhks' earthy. Their music conveys an understanding of the bond between land and soul. Their compelling performance is one wrought with the emotional impact and virtuosity of soulful vocals, slapped skins, wailing fiddle, flowing guitar, and bouyant banjo. With a band vision to redefine both folk and pop music, The Duhks are well on their way to doing it with their acoustic tools of the trade. Thnks for not not relying on any electric instruments, synthesizers or drum machines.

The Grass Series boasts a total collection of 15 albums that tapped professional Nashville-based artists to cover music from other genres. Produced by Donald Marrow, their intent is to present rock, pop, gospel and kid's music in an acoustic bluegrass format. I recommend starting with the \"Best ÂŒuv Grass\" 14-song sampler (just over 40 minutes) that has hand-picked favorite tracks from each album in the collection. The \"Grassmasters\" hired for the session work have some impressive talent. There are also a few pickers who could've been more proficient in the bluegrass idiom. Tommy White (Dobro) is a master musician who appears on all 15 albums. On a majority are Billy Hullett (guitars), Tammy Rogers (fiddle, mandolin), Hoot Hester (fiddle, mandolin), Fred Newell (mandolin), Vic Jordan (banjo), Daniel O'Lannerghty or Charlie Chadwick (bass). Andrea Zonn fiddles on a third of them, and she provides some short-lived smooth vocalizing on two albums. Where there are multiple players of the same instrument or various vocalists, liner notes don't clearly indicate who is on what cut. Every once in awhile, the moon and stars align and a few special renditions jump out at you. More often, however, the goal of producing a large volume of material in a short period of time seems to have led to problematic issues with arrangement, instrumentation, or presentation. Occasionally sounding contrived and formulaic, the music loses some of its bluegrass spirit, energy and passion.\n\nThe earlier releases (StonesGrass, BeatlesGrass, EaglesGrass and FleetwoodGrass) have no vocals. These four (as well as AeroGrass) also include Bob Mater's drums. He's steady, but bluegrass aficionados may want this primarily instrumental music without percussion and just let the mandolin chop the backbeat. BeatlesGrass could've used some stronger banjo work. Interestingly, liner notes don't provide a credit for the banjo in the mix of the DeadGrass project. Most likely Vic Jordan, he must've been forgotten that day.\n\nWith the exception of the 15-song KidsGrass and 14-song Best'uvGrass, the other CDs each offer twelve selections. The albums range from a low of 28 minutes (ElvisGrass) to nearly 49 minutes (EaglesGrass). While the former includes some refrains courtesy of The Jordanaires, song arrangements are short and typically only about two minutes apiece. The latter has a number of 4- and 5-minute renditions of Eagles tunes, but there are no vocals. Where's the happy medium that provides for thoughtful, creative arrangements with both instrumental and vocal prowess? With their slogan of \"Please Keep on the Grass,\" this series is worth checking out if you're in search of passable instrumental bluegrass covers of the material. If you're into karaoke, it's fun to sing with bluegrass accompaniment. I commend Synergy Entertainment for realizing the market potential associated with bluegrass musicians tapping material from other genres. We can expect better and better music from them as they work out a few bugs, establish their reputation, and develop stronger credibility. (Joe Ross)\n\nComparing The Grass Series to the CMH Label's \"Pickin' On\" Series, it appears that the former stays closer to a traditional bluegrass sound with no electric instruments, and little percussion as noted above. Also, the \"Pickin' On\" series features musicians from a greater geographic area than just Nashville. Their consistency in quality may be more variable whereas the \"Grass Series\" has a constant of the same producer and core group of top Nashville session musicians (with special guests as needed for each production's specific needs).\n\nAll things considered, here are a few observations on this specific album, only one in the entire 15-CD Grass Series:\n\nBest ÂŒuv Grass\n\n(Playing Time 40:03) -\n\nFrom the opening salvo of \"We Can Work It Out\" (from BeatlesGrass) to \"Old MacDonald Had A Farm\" (from KidsGrass), you'll get a great tasting and overview of the entire catalog of budget-priced albums. You'll quickly realize that some songs you really want to hear the lyrics with have only been arranged as instrumentals. \"Salty Dog Blues\" has drive but no soulful tenor exclaiming \"Now looky here Sal, I know you, run down stockin' and a worn out shoe.\" A few other incorporate drums or harmonica, in addition to the standard traditional bluegrass instrumentation. They do fine instrumental jobs with songs like \"Dream On\" (AeroGrass), \"Stir It Up\" (MarleyGrass), and \"Take It Easy\" (EaglesGrass), but I sure miss the words. \"Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Teddy Bear\" (ElvisGrass), \"Ring of Fire\" (CashGrass), and even \"Old MacDonald Had A Farm\" are given rather syrupy Nashvillain renditions that might work for karaoke singers needing some schmaltzy bluegrass backup. When vocals do appear on the albums, they are often just choruses. I can't quite fathom why verses were dropped, unless the original intent was to record these songs for bluegrass karaoke accompaniment.\n\nKidsGrass\n\nAt 41 minutes provides 15 favorite traditional folk songs, and the five vocalists featured do a nice job serving up a set for children. This material works bluegrass style, and they arranged it properly for kids to sing along with!\n\nSimon&Grassfunkel\n\nHas 36 minutes is one of only two albums in the series (the other being GrassRoots) that pairs up vocalists Andrea Zonn and Darrin Vincent for two vocal offerings (e.g. \"Homeward Bound\" and \"The Boxer\"). Paul Simon is a brilliant songcrafter, but it was their sweet and delicate vocal harmonics that made them one of the most successful folk/pop duos of the sixties. We'll just have to imagine what Zonn & Vincent would have sounded like with \"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\" because that big hit isn't even included.\n\nGrassRoots\n\nOnly 32 minutes in length, and the renditions of the 12 classic war horses only span 2-3 minutes apiece. Many of the songs we're used to as hard-driving vocal numbers (e.g. Rollin' in my Sweet Baby's Arms, Salty Dog Blues) are only given instrumental treatment. Andrea Zonn and Darrin Vincent sing a few but not near enough to make this one an unqualified success. Who wants to listen to an exhausting \"Man of Constant Sorrow\" without vocalizing? Without singing, the GrassRoots songs (often with tedious I-IV-V chord progressions) sound completely unfinished.\n\nTaylorGrass\n\nRuns 40 minutes, and some vocals from Clara Adams and Darrin Vincent (\"Shower The People\") are complemented with top instrumental work. This is the only album in the series that features fiddler Andy Lewis. Because the lyrics are so important in James Taylor's songs, this album falls short by not giving us enough vocalizing, but don't be shy about belting out Taylor's big commercial breakthrough, \"Fire and Rain,\" right along with them. James' music isn't the same without a soothing voice reflecting on the sixties. The Grass Series would've earned top marks with a little more forethought on how to best cover this great singer/songwriter's material. The Grassmasters should have also considered recording some of Taylor's other hits, \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)\" (written by Marvin Gaye) and Jimmy Jones' \"Handy Man.\"\n\nAeroGrass\n\nRuns over 41 minutes with the established core group of musicians, John Morton (guitar), and vocals by Margie Cates, Gus Gatches, and Monty Lane Allen. The Boston rock band's biggest hits are covered, usually without vocals. Guest Jim Hoke's harmonica and jew's harp provide a nice flavoring, but pass on the second cut (\"The Train Kept A-Rollin'\") that has too much drumming for my taste. The bluegrassers capture the classic Aerosmith riffs, and it makes for a playful (even humorous) outing. While the bluegrass renditions are rather earthy, I think I'll stick with the edgy original versions with vocals on classic-rock FM stations.\n\nDeadGrass\n\nAt 41 minutes is the only project with Kenny Sears sawing his fiddle, and the group is supplemented with special guests on guitar, harmonica, bass, and dulcimer. Five vocalists provide a touch of singing (e.g. \"A Touch of Grey\"). There are no extended improvisational interludes, and the arrangements become quite formulaic with very even meter.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS -\n\nViva! Terlingua! Nuevo!

Gonzos Compadres - Gonzos de Casa\n\nFeaturing live music seven nights a week, the 120-yer-old Luckenbach dancehall in Fredericksburg, Texas hosted this January 19-20, 2006 live recording session with stalwarts of the Palo Duro record label. The place specializes in parties, and a 70ish admission price of $1 was set for the 400 attendees who were lucky enough to win tickets in a lottery (then proceeds went to Health Alliance for Austin Musicians). This guaranteed a large, jovial, and friendly crowd for this big event in the venue that gets its moniker and inspiration from an old hill country town where everybody is somebody according to Jerry Jeff Walker song \"Viva! Luckenbach!\"\n\nContinuing the gonzo spirit of the Texas Outlaw music movement, this album covers a total of seven of Walker's songs, as well as ones from Guy Clark, Gary P. Nunn, Ray Wylie Hubbard, and Michael Murphy. This album is a tribute to Jerry Jeff's landmark 1973 album Viva! Terlingua! that is recognized as a seminal contribution to the then blossoming Texas outlaw music scene. All nine of the songs that appeared on Walker's original 1973 album have been redone on this \"nuevo\" project.\n\nMore generically, this lone star twang and attitude today are referred to as alt-country, insurgent country, or simply Americana. Interestingly, Jerry Jeff had not been initially consulted about this album project, and he got lawyers involved and filed a lawsuit claiming copyright infringement. Walker also claimed false advertising and misappropriation of his identity.\n\nMusicians participating included Jimmy LaFave, Cory Morrow, John Arthur Martinez, Two Tons of Steel, Ed Burleson, Brian Burns, Gary P. Nunn, McKay Brothers, Morrison-Williams, Walt Wilkins, Tommy and Justin Alverson, The Derailers, and past and present members of Gonzos de Casa. At track 8, Kent Finlay even recites a 5-minute Hondo Crouch poem entitled \"Luckenbach Daylight.\" Consistent with their business plan and marketing strategy, the record label previewed the album at the 2006 Americana Music Conference in a special Luckenbach replica booth. Also, this is just the first in Palo Duro's Luckenbach Texas music series that will presumably offer more hour-long live samplers from the dancehall, the objective being to honor the historical significance of the tiny town west of Austin where many a musical career was launched.\n\nIf you're looking for some \"Nuevo!\" Texas country music in the spirit of Luckenbach, this album is worth checking out even though it's a tad loose in spots. It's still a fun ride! As a result of the pending litigation, all commercial distribution of the album was suspended. However, the Palo Duro record label intends to aggressively pursue its right to distribute the album. Let's hope the lawsuit is resolved in a timely manner so that this and future albums in the series can reach our CD players soon. Especially if your mind keeps roamin', and your heart keeps longin' to be home in a Texas bar.

Ricky Skaggs heard Cadillac Sky and has decided to take a chance on them and their fresh, progressive brand of bluegrass. Penning all of their own material, C-Sky clearly has some country, Celtic and even rock influences. Only in existence since late-2002, the band doesn't have a long-tenured track record of success, but it's very likely that their supercharged vocals and novel sound will touch a nerve with younger listeners. At least, Skaggs thinks so. What he probably heard was their ability to be both precise and reckless, controlled but spontaneous, happy yet lonesome, in other words, the perfect ingredients for a young, unique bluegrass group. I think you'll agree with me. They're a kick if prog-grass is your bag.\n\nBryan Simpson plays a pivotal role in the band's songwriting, lead singing, and mandolin playing. Simpson's songs have been recorded by George Strait, Martina McBride, Gretchen Wilson, Diamond Rio, Jo Dee Messina, Neal McCoy, and Kenny Rogers. He even bows fiddle on one track, \"Never Been So Blue.\" The other stellar band members are Mike Jump (guitar, vocals), Matt Menefee (banjo), Ross Holmes (fiddle, vocals), and Matt Blaize (bass, vocals). National championship fiddle and banjo wins at Winfield, Kansas only add to the mystery and romanticism of this group.\n\nThe band's creativity and wild, boyish exuberance are a product of their familiarity with traditional bluegrass. In the CD jacket, one photo shows Simpson proudly displaying his Monroe T-shirt. This 13-song debut is certain to draw comparisons to the ground-breaking directions of Nickel Creek, New Grass Revival, Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, and others. It's important that bands follow their inner muse. If band members can all share a common vision and have fun together while they're collaboratively moving ahead, then we'll have a strong purpose-driven group like C-Sky, what a fantastic futuristic name for such a band. But even if they're \"mountain boys\" at heart, they're motivated and eager to solidify their own musical persona. Already with this 13-song debut, I can tell you that it's characterized by considerable talent, maturity, and charisma. National press coverage, widespread airplay, extensive touring, a record contract, and a 2004 showcase at the IBMA World of Bluegrass Trade Show have people talking about an innovative progressive band that's easy to embrace. They're not out to reform bluegrass music but merely nudge it into the new century. They know about the lonesome soul of the genre, and in \"Never Been So Blue\" they eulogize Bill Monroe with \"the twin fiddles play and the whippoorwill sings, the bluegrass has never been so blue.\" Do you think they included this song, respectful of his music and legacy, just to appease those staunch traditionalists who think C-Sky is blasphemous? I doubt it.\n\nAnd thanks guys for not including percussion in the mixÂŠyou don't need it. Sonya Isaacs' guest vocals on \"Homesick Blues\" are a nice touch, as is Kenneth Soper's didgereedoo on the title cut. When asked a standard canned interview question once about their influences, the band's reply was something to the effect that their music is just something that feels necessary. If the bluegrass genre is going to continue to grow and prosper with younger folks, then I think you'll understand that C-Sky is on somewhat of a mission to fulfill a purpose and need.

Except for the spiritual \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,\" the tuneful songs (16 total) were written by the band members. From the state of Washington, Stay Tuned is characteristic of many Pacific Northwest groups - they incorporate a wide variety of regional themes and multi-genre influences from bluegrass, folk, country and western swing into their own original music. Acknowledging that they are more than just another bluegrass band, they prefer to be known for their \"refreshing original acoustic music.\" Although not born and raised in Appalachia, they embrace bluegrass instrumentation for their joyful and affable presentation. In fact, this quartet's members took rather circuitous routes to their current beguiling music.\n\nAlan Ehrlich (banjo, vocals) grew up in New York City and sang do-wop music in high school before heading westward to California, Colorado and Washington where he joined up with the band, Rainy Pass. He wrote six of the songs on this project, and his \"Highway 99\" tells an interesting swinging travelogue about stepping back in time the Alaska Way Viaduct. Fiddler Paul Elliott appears as a guest, and a few more songs on Stay Tuned's first album could've used that (or some Dobro) instrumental embellishment. Mandolinist/singer Pete Goodall was born in southern California, and I presume that his career in information technology brought him to the northwest. He hosts the \"Bluegrass Ramble\" weekly radio show on KBCS in Seattle. Pete wrote or co-wrote eight numbers on the CD. It's bad enough to be left all alone, but in \"My New Roommate is the Blues,\" Pete humorously says how she left - with an e-mail addressed \"to whom it may concern.\" High school teacher Terry O'Brien (guitar, mandolin, vocals) grew up in Seattle, played electric in high school, but has gravitated back to acoustic music. Inspired by the scenic beauty in their neck of the woods, \"Deception Pass\" is a crafty instrumental with dawg music overtones. Another native northwesterner, bassist Mary Sackmann has played piano, picked guitar, sang in choirs, and performed in an all-women band. Usually in more of a support role, Mary sings lead on three songs on the album.\n\nWhile this band doesn't have any knockout singers, they still offer up plenty of sheer creative audacity in a sparkling and friendly manner. In their down-home manner, mere enthusiasm enhances their appeal. At community events and regional festivals, they'd be well received. They epitomize some of the tantalizing bluegrass foundation of the northwest. And how can you not enjoy their enlightened original perspectives and comic expressions of affirmative spirit? A takeoff on \"Pig in a Pen,\" their rendition of \"Pig in a Can\" sounds more like Bill Monroe meets Cab Calloway. They should plug some of these songs to big names looking for new cheery material.

Smith sings with distinctive panache, and she goes with material from respected songcrafters who have given her winning compositions in the past -- Becky Buller, Lisa Aschmann and Mark Simos. They also cover a Louvin Brothers favorite, \"Make Him A Soldier,\" Claire Lynch and Cindy Greene's \"Wings To Fly\", and Sarah Majors' \"Soul Phone.\" Impressed by Valerie's work ethic and determination, this album was produced by Alan O'Bryant.\n\nValerie Smith and Liberty Pike were nominated for IBMA's Emerging Artist Awards of 1999 and 2000. She's also been recognized by midwest bluegrass fans when nominated as SPBGMA's \"Traditional Bluegrass Female Vocalist of the Year\" award in 1998, 1999, 2001 and 2002. \"Wash Away Your Troubles\" features Liberty Pike's current lineup -- Becky Buller (fiddle, viola, clawhammer banjo, vocals), Casey Grimes (bass, vocals), and Jonathan Maness (guitar, mandolin, vocals). On 2-3 tracks apiece, guests include Mike Compton (mandolin), Aaron Jackson (guitar), Matt Leadbetter (resophonic guitar, vocals), and Alan O'Bryant (banjo).\n\nThe group elegantly assumes a devout tone on songs where the messages are paramount. Although not uploaded yet, lyrics will soon be online at ValerieSmithOnline.com. \"Wash away your troubles, wash away your pain\" is the opening salvo in \"The Rain.\" The set then progresses through some first pew music before elegantly closing with the refrain, \"Lead us to your ocean, make us into water\" to epitomize the band's love and praise of God.\n\nSongwriting is both art and craft. Becky Buller had a hand in four composing songs on this CD, and she knows how to cultivate her creative ideas into blossoming works. With her lively old-time banjo, \"Getting Ready for Sunday,\" for example, is a call for each and every heart to prepare and make time for church. Only about six years ago (2001), Becky won the bluegrass category of the prestigious Chris Austin Songwriting Contest at MerleFest in Wilksboro, N.C. She's starting to see more and more bluegrass groups covering her expressive material.\n\nFive songs on this project exhibit the stylistic writing of Nashville-based Lisa Aschmann who has written thousands of songs in many genres, with more than 300 covered by country, bluegrass and acoustic artists. Lisa's perspectives, often in collaboration with co-writer Mark Simos or others, show innovation (\"God's Refrigerator\"), spirituality (\"Music To My Ears\"), and revelation (\"Blossoms on the Almond Tree\"). Much in the same manner that her songs take root and flourish, a song like \"Seeds\" asks a simple folksy question to guide one's journey in life that will hopefully result in an individual finding meaning, purpose and salvation. Claire Lynch's alluring song also offers an encouraging message to persevere \"I will walk ÂŒtil I have wings to fly.\"\n\nThere is excellent talent on this album, and the band presents some wonderful new material in spare settings that encourage intimacy with the lyrics. Valerie's direct messages reflect the eclectic sounds, influences, and textures of her Midwest home. With country, folk and bluegrass components, one primary goal of her music is to connect us all as human beings and relate evocative and inspirational messages from the depths of her heart and soul.

Their music is new bluegrass and gospel presented in a traditional style. Andy is a guitarist, and Alvin sings both lead and tenor vocals. Their albums also feature Alvin's two sons, Scott (bass vocals) and Bruce (guitar, baritone vocals). They take new fresh songs from Missouri songwriters and enlist the help of Bobby Clark (mandolin), Blake Williams (banjo, bass), and Arkansas fiddle champ Tim Crouch who even lays some twin fiddles into the mix on occasion. Previous albums have featured Jim Buchanan or Glen Duncan on fiddle. As always, The Bresslers give us uplifting albums of traditionally-inspired bluegrass from the Ozarks.\n\nThe four Bresslers don't seem to strive for a driving high, lonesome sound. Rather, their solid bluegrass twang includes some low-key and down-home folky earthiness on a well-crafted collection. Certainly, some songs work better than others in such a large body of material. Their high level of musical output in recent years doesn't seem to be impacting the consistent quality or intent of their albums. Repertoire is drawn from the pens of Darren Haverstick, Joy Gail Cox, Harlin Howerton, Frances Simpson, Leona Williams, James McDonugh, and Vernon & Virginia Long. Both art and craft, good songwriting requires the careful cultivation of idea seeds to express evocative messages. They cover common themes that we can all relate to - love of God, family, home and bluegrass music.\n\nI always enjoy hearing bands sing about their own region (\"Missouri\"), and my ears always pick up a tad at \"novelty\" tunes with catchy hooks like \"In That Monroe Tradition,\" \"Breaking Out Again,\" and \"Seed Tick Blues.\" Whether you view those as hooky or hokie may be a matter of personal perspective, but I fall into the former category because the Bresslers sing with enough emotional honesty to anchor their genial, good-time sound. Some other homespun and sincere songs are \"Daddy Showed Me,\" \"The Miracle,\" \"My Friends Are Waiting For Me,\" \"Next Time I See You,\" \"You'd Better Be Ready\" and \"When I Get Home.\" It's very earnest and affable music, but even the song titles indicate their shortcoming - most are commonplace and just aren't that memorable alongside all the great original bluegrass music being written today. Written and presented in an old-time way, one of my favorites is the _-time heartfelt tribute \"Granddaughter Remembers Grandma.\" Harlin Howerton also wrote \"Memories and Grass\" (title cut for the one album) and \"Memory and Friends\" (about the greatest treasures on earth). Lyrics are included in the CD jackets of both projects. Liner notes in \"40 Years of Memories and Grass\" are a little difficult to read easily due to their graphic layout, while Wayne Bledsoe's notes in \"Taste of Life\" are right on target.\n\nWhile the Bresslers' singing may not elicit a great deal of worldwide airplay. These albums illustrate their dedication to presenting new original bluegrass music in a traditional vein. It's challenging to find new songs that elicit the same sentiments as the seminal bluegrass music of yesteryear. With these two relaxed albums, the Bresslers show their commitment and enthusiasm. (Joe Ross)\n\nGEORGE McCLURE -\n\nPlayboy Swing\n\nJIP Records JIP-7007\n\nPO BOX 70403, Nashville, TN. 37207\n\nwww.jiprecords.com\n\nPlaying Time - 46:13\n\nGeorge McClure's \"Playboy Swing\" continues his signature calling to present contemporary western swing music that also incorporates elements of bluegrass, big band, and even bilingual Tex-Mex border music. George's talents are diverse and varied. Before embarking on a fully professional music career, he studied cognitive anthropology, business, computers, math and more. Obviously, he's a creative right-brain type of guy who also knows how to handily apply his aptitude and skill to playing, singing and producing music. In his younger days, he's played Arizona and New Mexico, performed in the pit for live theatre, and picked bluegrass and country with the Salt River Ramblers.\n\nNow, he's apparently in Nashville and following up on his second successful 1999 album \"Champagne Saturday\" that included the likes of Bobby Hicks, Judy Lynn, Joey Miskulin, Rick ÂŒL.D.' Money, Johnny B. I kind of miss the accordion on \"Playboy Swing,\" but George has arranged his music with plenty of other instrumentation to personalize his sound. Besides George's guitar, there are primarily trumpets, saxes, drums, bass, and piano. Sadly, John Heinrich's pedal steel only appears in William Young's \"Little Miss Santa Clause\" from his repertoire recorded in 2006. The bow work of fiddlers Jon Yudkin and Andrea Zonn is essential to this kind of material, and they all rise to the occasion without grandstanding.\n\nThe two bonus tracks offer selections recorded in 1992 (\"Mass Grass\") and 1998 \"Across the Alley from the Alamo\"), and they seem to illustrate McClure's musical evolution from playing banjo in more acoustic arrangements to the added instrumental dimensions he presents today. Stephen George Miler's \"Mass Grass\" is an instrumental with a relaxed sophistication that featured David Grier, Mark Howard, and Terry Eldredge. \"Across the Alley from the Alamo\" is a fun remake of the Bob Wills' classic, and it has Johnny Bellar's lap steel, Bobby Hicks' fiddle, and Mark Schatz' bass in the mix.\n\nMcClure's newest material has developed more into big band and jazz music. At track 2, an updated 2006 rendition of \"Mass Grass\" still has George picking banjo, but also has grand piano, violin, bass, drums, sax and electric guitar. The tune takes a completely different ambiance of relaxed, good-time vibe, as does \"Mood Time\" with its shimmering piano, sax and taste of banjo. McClure also remakes his own \"Champagne Saturday\" (with Kathy Chiavola's background vocals) into a grooving little number for the front-porch swing. In his songs like \"Texas Blues\" and \"Mis Pensamientos,\" George sings with warm, affable texture. I guess that's what he refers to as \"romantico\" music with tints of Mexican mariachi melodies. Jim Hoke's wailing trumpets really fill out the score for \"DÃ­a De Los Muertos (The Matador).\" McClure's music is a little enigmatic at times. For example, why does he begin the album with a 3-minute version of \"Playboy Swing,\" but revisits the song with a 5-minute version (entitled \"Playboy Loop\") at track 12? All in all, this CD's a one-of-a-kind offering from a unique right-brained individual. It's rather entertainingly off-beat. Hang loose, and enjoy it.

Little Bessie, 3. Rueben, 4. Bayou Bottle Blues, 5, Miners' Night Out, 6, El Cumbachero, 7. Rocket Man, 8. Prairie Song , 9. The Ballad of Osceola, 10. Gold Rush, 11. Orange Blossom Special\n\nFive-string bluegrass banjo is not an easy instrument to play. It requires plenty of intense right hand drive with various fingerpicked rolls, while the left hand uses such techniques as pull-offs, hammer-ons, and string bends to embellish melodies. The innovative Todd Taylor has it all down! Incorporating Scruggs, melodic, and single string styles, his repertoire pays tribute to Earl Scruggs, Bill Monroe, Ralph Stanley, John McEuen and even Elton John. Pretty diverse influences, but not as far-reaching as on previous projects. Taylor penned two impressive originals, \"3-FIVE-N\" and \"Bayou Bottle Blues,\" and he arranged a few others like the frenetic crowd-pleaser \"Orange Blossom Special.\" One can see why Todd's been nominated for a number of Grammies. John McEuen once told me that he wants to take the banjo into new, uncharted territory, and Taylor demonstrates his comfort with John's \"Miner's Night Out.\" A barn-burning rendition of \"El Cumbanchero\" also appeared previously on his \"Taylor Made\" album. Not sure why he includes it here again. \"Prairie Song\" and \"Little Bessie\" feature Steve Thorpe's languorous vocals.\n\nOn stage since age 6, Taylor and his twin brother (Allen) performed as the \"Taylor Twins\" with the likes of Bill Monroe, Carl Story, Roy Acuff and others. When Todd's five-string starts smoking, look beyond just the breakneck licks. He manages to find some stylistic footing by establishing a groove and expanding into non-bluegrass genres (Latin, new acoustic, and rock). While every banjo-player worth his salt cuts his teeth on fare like Reuben, Todd's spunk makes it his own. That's why Taylor's best material is built around his two originals or his renderings of \"El Cumbanchero\" or \"Rocket Man.\"\n\nThe band on \"3-FIVE-N\" comes off with even more instrumental proficiency and a better rehearsed sound than on his \"Taylor Made\" album. Primary accompanists include Bo Frazier (fiddle), Lamont Goff (mandolin), Robert Feathers (guitar), and Mike Moody (bass). Nathan Thorpe, Steve Thorpe, and Chuck Embry III appear to a minimal degree. Todd shows us that he's a very daring young man with a lot of skill, confidence, and vitality. On first listen, what may sound to an undiscerning ear as rather frantic and frenzied picking is really occurring in a very controlled bluegrass environment. Dare I say it but on his next album I'd like to hear him slow down and offer a small percentage of very evocative mood pieces - a whole ÂŒnuther and calmer side of the banjer! \"3-FIVE-N\" can be purchased at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/taylortodd8 (Joe Ross)\n\nJ.D. CROWE & THE NEW SOUTH -\n\nLefty's Old Guitar\n\nRounder Records 11661-0512-2\n\nOne Camp Street, Cambridge, MA 02140\n\nwww.rounder.com\n\nPlaying Time - 34:10\n\nSONGS - Mississippi River Raft, Lefty's Old Guitar, Just Loving You, Rovin' Gambler, In My Next Life, You Can Be A Millionaire With Me, I Only wish You Knew, Loneliness, I'm A Hobo, Too Often Left Alone, Blue Bonnet Lane, She Know When You're On My Mind Again\n\nFrom Kentucky, J.D. Crowe began his career as a member of Mac Wiseman's band in 1955. Thus, \"Lefty's Old Guitar\" is also somewhat of a half - century celebratory milestone for J.D. After an early stint with Jimmy Martin, he formed his own group in 1968, The Kentucky Mountain Boys (with Doyle Lawson and Red Allen). The New South first took the stage in 1974 with Tony Rice, Ricky Skaggs and Jerry Douglas. About 2002, Rounder Records re-released \"My Home Ain't in the Hall of Fame\" (the band's seminal 1978 album). Over the years, band alumni have included Keith Whitley, Jimmy Gaudreau, Paul Adkins, Wendy Miller, Gene Johnson (Diamond Rio), Tony King (Brooks and Dunn), and many others. In 1999, J.D. and The New South put out the album \"Come on Down to My World,\" that introduced us to Dwight McCall's singing and mandolin playing. A year later, however, some of their bandmates left to form another stellar group, Wildfire. That 1999 album was the band's last studio album until \"Lefty's Old Guitar\" hit the mark.\n\nToday, the award-winning banjo player's band is comprised of some masterful pickers and singers - Dwight McCall (mandolin, vocals), Rickey Wasson (guitar, vocals), Ron Stewart (fiddle), and Harold Nixon (bass). Crowe, of course, also typically sings a baritone harmony in choruses. Their vocal blends are resonant, full of joy or sung with pathos, when needed. For their highest, lonesomest sound, check out \"She Knows When You're On My Mind Again,\" that lays in Cia Cherryholmes' high baritone harmony on the very top. While Wasson does most of the lead vocalizing on \"Lefty's Old Guitar,\" McCall's sumptuous high voice belts out the verses' lyrics on his own self-penned \"I Only Wish You Knew,\" Larry Sparks' \"Just Loving You,\" and Cindy Walker's \"Blue Bonnet Lane.\"\n\nTheir contemporary repertoire is arranged with shared breaks and crafty instrumental fills. \"Lefty's Old Guitar\" has been a long time, about seven years, in coming. I guess that the band and record label felt that the current personnel had now solidified into a very cohesive unit of impeccability. Crowe has always been astute about incorporating some country feeling into his music. Doug Jernigan's pedal steel on two cuts doesn't bother me, and I appreciate their not feeling a need to put drums or percussion into the mix. Other producers (usually Nashville-based) feel that ÂŒpower' bluegrass music needs drums to present commercial, radio-friendly fare. J.D. Crowe proves that it just ain't so! One thing I did find missing from their successful formula, however, would be a hard-driving barnburner that really challenges the instrumental picking and bowing prowess of highly regarded award winners like Ronnie Stewart. However, the set still provides some eclectic ups and downs in tempos for songs that are as sure to become as classic and influential as some of J.D. Crowe's seminal works. (Joe Ross)\n\nJOHN STARLING & CAROLINA STAR -\n\nSlidin' Home\n\nRebel REB-CD-1820\n\nPO BOX 7405, Charlottesville, VA. 22906\n\nwww.rebelrecords.com\n\nEMAIL kissyblack@lotosnile.com\n\nPlaying Time - 33:06\n\nIt seems appropriate that John Starling, originally from Alabama, begins his first new album in more than a decade with another southerner's hit, \"Waiting for a Train,\"from Jimmie Rodgers. While Starling doesn't include the characteristic singing brakeman's yodel, he does impart his own remarkably distinctive voice to plenty of relaxed country hits with lilting melodies and thought-provoking lyrics. With a heart full of emotion, Starling milks the lyrics of their lament, love and hope.\n\nJohn's lead vocals and rhythm guitar grace all the tracks, as do Mike Auldridge's resophonic guitar and Tom Gray's bass. Friends for years, all three have the Seldom Scene connection. John left that seminal group in 1988 to concentrate full-time on his medical practice, before rejoining the band as its guitarist and lead singer for a second time from 1992-94. Starling's debut solo release (Waitin' on a Southern Train) showed his eclectic tastes for bluegrass, honky tonk, and classic country. He also put out highly-acclaimed albums in 1987 (Spring Training) and in 1990 (Long Time Gone).\n\nNow retired, John invited some of his best musical friends to collaborate on \"Slidin' Home.\"You may recall that Starling directed the award-winning \"Trio\"album with Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton. In a minor role, Emmylou sings with John on a song she co-wrote with Gram Parsons, \"In My Hour of Darkness.\"I'm sure that John sees some of himself and can personally relate to lines like \"But he was just a country boy, his simple tunes confess. And the music he had in him, so very few possess.Â”\n\nOther choices he made for this album tap the reservoirs of some crafty and profound writers. I've heard Missy Raines and Jim Hurst sing a beautiful \"Cold Hard Business\"(on their \"Synergy\"album), but Starling's rendition is done with Jon Randall. An oft-covered song of passion, Leon's Payne \"They'll Never Take Her Love From Me\"takes a great deal of courage to present. My goodness, Starling still manages to impart his seductive charm to the song sung by the likes of Hank Williams, George Jones, Marty Robbins, Emmylou Harris, and Waylon Jennings. I never tire of a good hard-hitting familiar favorite, and it has been ten years since Waylon did it. At ten cuts spanning 33 minutes, the album is just a tad short.\n\nInterspersed between the mellow offerings are a couple tuneful instrumentals, \"South Riding Tango\"and \"Irish Spring.\"Both feature the hot licks of two guests on the album -- Jimmy Gaudreau (mandolin) and Rickie Simpkins (fiddle). For added embellishment to some selection, other guest musicians include Jon Randall, Kent Ippolito, Jay Starling, Pete Wasner, and Larry Stephenson. Auldridge also lays in some tracks of Weissenborn guitar or lap steel. For example, the former instrument is used to impart bluesy twang to \"Those Two Blue Eyes,\"a song we may best remember as a driving bluegrass number that Keith Whitley released on the Rebel label about 1972. The lap steel and piano perfectly voice their genial moods in Lowell George's \"Willin',\"a favorite song of John's (and recorded by Linda Rondstadt). The sleepy score of a truck driver heading home declares a strong sentiment - \"Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet, and I'm still willin'.Â”\n\nJohn Starling closes \"Slidin' Home\"with one of his most tender sentiments that epitomizes the entire project. The sweet and endearing tune, \"Prayer For My Friends,\"comes from award-winning Tennessee songwriters Jeff Barbra and Sarah Pirkle. John acknowledges the wonderful people on whom he depends. \"Our pathways are different but I love them no less .... I'm so grateful for the people I have in my life, they help me to do what is right .... In my heart here tonight, they're dear to my heart for all time ....\"John's new album has laid-back textures, and he sings about life in a tender, kind and empathetic way.

At the time, it became very evident that Debbie is a prolific singer-songwriter whose expressive songs about relationships have a strong country feel. Now Debra Lyn has a new EP, \"I Can't Remember To Forget You,\"with seven new country songs that she wrote or co-wrote with her encouraging husband and the album's producer, Jeff Silverman of Nashville's Palette Studios. Debra's lead and harmony vocals convey an earthy sensuality. And their choice of instrumentation is much more country than bluegrass now, but they still realize the potential for acoustic instruments to convey certain moods in individual songs. The banjo and fiddle in \"So Long Since September,\"for example, impart a slight rustic mountain feel to a contemporary storyline. Jeff's guitar, bass and background vocals are solid in the multi-layered sound that also incorporates many other top session players -- Randy Kohrs (banjo, Dobro, vocals), Dave Pearlman (Dobro, steel guitar), Ken Lewis, Nate Morton or Jim Haydon (drums, percussion), James Mitchell (electric guitar), Mike Johnson (steel guitar), Gabriel Katona (piano), and Steve Stokes (fiddle, vocals). I would encourage artists looking for new material to closely peruse her lyrics and melodies on this rhythmically-enticing album. I'm sure you'll find some alluring songs that you can relate to. A song like \"I Know\"even has the accessible melody, bright lyricism and modulating arrangement that could make it a pop hit.

A consummate touring folksinger who plays guitar, banjo and mandolin, \"Evening Song\" features 13 originals from Johnathon (with the other two from Bob Dylan and Leroy Carr). We certainly know what Michael's favorite time of day is. His inspired eclecticism does have a common theme - all of the songs are either about, set in, or written in the evening. That's interesting because his last album (\"Homestead\") also included many similar reflective pieces in our about dimming light (\"Winter's Eve\" and \"The Homestead Suite\") with that album's title cut telling a story of a peaceful autumn evening at home.\n\nThe notes on Johnathon's eighth album quote Henry David Thoreau about becoming more pensive in the twilight of the year and the beauty of the last hour of the day. Most of his songs are peaceful and contemplative. Others, like \"Mandarin Mandolins\" and \"Go Laddy Go\" impart a little liveliness to the melodic step. The nearly hour-long set closes with \"Troubadour,\" a meandering and presumably autobiographical sketch about the poetry that lives in his guitar and the \"peaceful dreams in everything I sing.\" The clever singer-songwriter and radio host (WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour) enlists the support of 18 others for the \"Evening Song\" project. Noteable bluegrassers include Rob Ickes (Dobro), Don Rigsby (mandolin), and Andy Leftwich (mandolin). Although liner notes don't clarify who is playing when, Ickes' playing is immediately recognizable in the breaks and fills. But with five different mandolinists contributing, players should have been credited on a song-by-song basis, and some personal notes about the inspiration for each song would have bee helpful. Others in the patchwork of sound provide cello, bass, violin, viola, French horn, fluglehorn, trumpet, saxophone, drums, percussion, jew's harp and background vocals. His accompanists successfully dispense \"song conversation\" to the music. Evening Song's nicely-arranged, multi-instrumental tones and rhythms resemble a cozy quilt that warms you by the woodstove at dusk.

He's Living in You, 4. Lift Me a Little Higher, 5. Why Are You Waiting, 6. Dust On the Land, 7. Oh' What a Glorious Day, 8. Old Joe, 9. Angel Wings, 10. For the Love of God, 11. Talking to the Lord, 12. My Eyes Are Open\n\nPlaying Time - 37:14\n\nFormed in 2004, From The Heartland is an appropriate moniker for a group that plays in Oklahoma, Kansas and Iowa. They follow their first album, \"One Little Kiss,\" with \"Lift Me A Little Higher,\" an effervescent showcase of their songwriting, instrumental and vocal skills. With the exception of two spirited instrumentals (\"Ken-Caid\" and \"Old Joe\"), they raise their voices on high (and low) in the Spirit of God. The band includes Carl Brown (banjo, Dobro), Freddie Base (guitar), Kenny Terral (mandolin), Mary Mayhew (fiddle), and Janis Lindsey (bass). All hailing from the Sooner State (Oklahoma), Lindsey, Terral and Brown are the band's songsmiths. Their messages are direct and honest in praise of the Lord, and the band's shortcomings don't dampen our enthusiasm. Kenny Terral's low bass voice reverently assumes a devout tone on \"Why Are You Waiting,\" and in \"Talking To The Lord,\" he sings in a call-and-response style to Janis Lindsey's pleasant vocal presence.\n\nFrom The Heartland's members have years of experience playing regionally in groups such as the The Dixie Ramblers, Larry Ford Bluegrass Band, and Freddie Base and Highway 37 Boys. This album carries dedications to two family members, Kassandara Marie Lindsey and Joe Noel. A banjo-player and guitarist, Joe was the inspiration for Carl Brown's instrumental \"Old Joe.\" Kassandra was taken by angels in December, 2004 at age eighteen as the result of a tragic car accident. Janis Lindsey admits that life can throw us some sad curves. By writing and singing gospel music, she thanks the Lord for helping her and her family heal from their wounds of grief and sorrow. Somewhat unpolished, From The Heartland is not trying to win Grammy Awards. Rather, their music's central premise and vitality come directly from the heart as much as from America's and bluegrass music's heartland. The band's caring and compassionate attitude is their strength, and we hear that amply conveyed in their music. (Joe Ross)\n\nTANGLEWEED -\n\nWhere You Been So Long?\n\nSquatney Records 45001\n\nTangleweed.org\n\nPlaying Time - 37:35\n\nChicago-based Tangleweed is a \"foot stompin', moonshine drinkin'\" group that has an alluring je ne sais quoi that is sturdy and self-assured. Full of exuberance and energy, the quintet's rough edges are starting to smooth out since their live debut \"Just A Spoonful\" album. No personnel changes have definitely brought their strings tighter, and \"Where You Been Gone So Long?\" was wisely recorded in a more controlled studio environment. Timothy Ryan Fisher (banjo), Paul Wargaski (upright bass), Billy Oh (fiddle), Kenneth Rainey (mandolin), and Scott Judd (guitar) share chemistry that results in some good-time music inspired from old-time, bluegrass, jug band, swing, gypsyjazz and Irish airs.\n\nPlaying regularly since mid-2004, Tangleweed's strength is their infectious enthusiasm and varied repertoire. \"I've Found A New Baby\" is a carefully-cultivated classic 1930s jazz standard, and their medley of jigs and reels or \"Leaving of Liverpool\" convey hues of emerald green. A tune like \"Drunkard's Blues\" is presented with authentic grit. The band's original old-time protest song bewailing war and poverty, \"Hard Times,\" gives Tangleweed a sound not too dissimilar from the New Lost City Ramblers. Also written by all members of the band, the title cut speaks to \"being broke and hungry, sleepin' on the floor\" and \"twelve hours on a Trailways bus to sleep here by your side.\" That cut epitomizes Tangleweed's bluegrass spunk. This string band's eclectic repertoire has a little something for everyone in a big urban environment like the Windy City. In fact, their varied music is quite breezy and refreshing too. This mostly excitable, frenzied set ends with another face of Tangleweed - \"Last Call Waltz\" with its one minute of doleful yodeling recorded in the empty stairwell of an old Chicago building.

While solid if fairly standard, Windy Creek makes no claims that they are going to turn the bluegrass world upside down. Instead, they sing and play with honest feeling as they open with a heartfelt original \"Take Me Back to the Mountains\" that makes for a pleasant but predictable ride. In workmanlike fashion, they strum and pick their way through traditional bluegrass fare such as Teardrops In My Eyes, Love and Wealth, Thanks A Lot, and Ashes of Love.\n\nWindy Creek is an interesting combination of seasoned veterans and younger musicians still honing a few chops but doing a fine job. Robert Arsenault (guitar, mandolin) has been performing bluegrass and old-time country music for three decades. Marcel Cormier (guitar) has been playing since his teens. Arn Wickens played gospel and acoustic jazz on electric bass for 25 years before switching to the upright bass five years ago. The other two band members (Marc Brun on mandolin and Gh"
