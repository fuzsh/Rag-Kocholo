        "text": "USA TODAY's music staff offers a weekend tip sheet of sound recommendations spanning the media landscape.\n\nTICKETS: Green Day, Paul McCartney shows on sale this weekend\n\nPaul McCartney's On the Run tour, which launched in July 2011 with a pair of Yankee Stadium blowouts, returns to North America for four shows this fall. Tickets go on sale Friday for concerts Nov. 11 in St. Louis, Nov. 14 in Houston, Nov. 25 in Vancouver (his first there since The Beatles played Empire Stadium in 1964) and Nov. 28 in Edmonton (his first stop there ever). Green Day kicks off the first leg of its Uno! Dos! Tre! tour, named after the band's upcoming trio of albums, with a theater run starting Nov. 26 in Seattle and wrapping up Dec. 10 in Tempe, Ariz., followed by arenas from Jan. 7 in Green Bay, Wis., to Feb. 8 in Las Vegas. Most seats go on sale this weekend. -- Gundersen\n\nTV: Frank Ocean guests as 'Saturday Night Live' returns\n\nR&B singer Frank Ocean, fresh off his smoldering performance of Thinkin' Bout You last week on the MTV Video Music Awards, will be the musical guest on Saturday Night Live's 38th season premiere (NBC, 11:30 p.m. ET). Seth MacFarlane will host. Ocean has promised via Twitter that he'll be joined by John Mayer, who appeared on the song White on Ocean's channel ORANGE album. Ocean stirred controversy just before its July release by confessing that his first love was for a man. --Jones\n\nALBUMS: ' Fifty Shades' of classical music\n\n\"Music to tie up and whip your lover by\" is how The Philadelphia Inquirer cheekily described Fifty Shades of Grey -- The Classical Album, a new collection inspired by the hyper-erotic publishing sensation. EL James, author of the best-selling Fifty Shades novels, personally selected the 15 tracks, which are referenced in the trilogy. They include compositions by Bach, Verdi, Chopin and Rachmaninoff, and showcase artists such as Simon Rattle, Barbara Hendricks and the King's College Choir. -- Gardner\n\nSOUNDTRACK: Radiohead guitarist steps to forefront on 'The Master' soundtrack\n\nRadiohead's Jonny Greenwood reunites with There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson for the highly anticipated film The Master. The soundtrack features 11 of Greenwood's compositions, plus four songs from that film's era by Ella Fitzgerald, Jo Stafford, Helen Forrest and Madisen Beaty. The film paints a complex portrayal of the post-World War II America's secret world of drifters. Joaquin Phoenix stars as a disillusioned World War II veteran who finds himself enraptured by a faith-based organization, The Cause, and its hypnotic leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman). As the organization grows, he questions his mentor and his belief system. -- Lopez\n\nREISSUES: Welcome back, my friends, to the reissue that never ends"
