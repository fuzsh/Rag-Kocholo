        "text": "Song of the Day, August 20: You Belong to Me by Jo Stafford\n\nAugust 20, 2015\n\nToday’s song is a pop standard that Jo Stafford took to the top of the charts in 1952. Country/pop songwriter Chliton Price originally crafted a song called Hurry Home to Me, envisioned as a WWII plea from a stateside woman to her soldier sweetheart. She shared the song with Redd Stewart and Pee Wee King, who made minor changes to the arrangement. They also made the theme more universal, reflecting the circumstances of any separated lovers, and changed the title to You Belong to Me.\n\nKing and Stewart promoted the song, shopping it to the major labels in 1952. Mercury picked it up for Sue Thompson, who recorded the original Country version. Patti Page released the next version, but it was relegated to B-side status when DJs flipped it over to play I Went to Your Wedding.\n\nEnter singer extraordinaire Jo Stafford. Columbia picked up the song for her, and she recorded and released her version. It was a smash, lasting over six months on the charts and staying at #1 for an impressive 12 weeks. (Curiously, it vied for the top spot with I Went to Your Wedding, with the two songs moving in and out of #1 around each other.) It became the biggest hit in Stafford’s impressive career, even crossing over to the UK where it was the first #1 by a solo female singer.\n\nStafford delivers it with her usual casual brilliance. Singing with passion and precision, she captures the spirit of the lyrics flawlessly. You Belong to Me has been covered dozens of times, but Stafford’s lovely performance remains the finest rendition.\n\nEnjoy this classic song today.\n\nAlbum of the Week, June 30: The “Big Band” Sound by Jo Stafford\n\nJune 30, 2013\n\nJo Stafford was the biggest selling and most popular female vocalist from the start of World War II to the beginning of the Rock Era. Born in 1917 in Coalinga, CA, she demonstrated her musical talent at a young age. After briefly performing with her sisters, she helped form the pop vocal group the Pied Pipers. The group became regular singers for Tommy Dorsey, who also recorded with Stafford as a soloist. In 1944, she left Dorsey and the Pipers to strike out on her own. She racked up dozens of hits, including a handful of #1s. Many of these were arranged by Paul Weston, whom she married in 1952.\n\nStafford was known for the purity of her voice and for her flexibility as a vocalist. She sang pop, standards, jazz, big band, and country and recorded many duets, notably with Gordon MacRae. Stafford was also famous for her sense of humor. She assumed the identity of Cinderella G. Stump to sing a comic “hillbilly” version of Temptation. In the 60s she and Weston created the horrific lounge act Jonathan and Darlene Edwards; she sang off-key in a way that only a gifted vocalist can, and their recordings won a Grammy for best comedy album. She recorded for the better part of five decades, finally retiring in the late 80s. She died in 2008 at the age of 90, leaving behind an amazing legacy of music.\n\nTitle The “Big Band” Sound\n\nAct Jo Stafford Label Corinthian Release Date January 1970 Producer Paul Weston U.S. Chart n/c U.K. Chart n/c Tracks\n\n[U.S. Hot 100]\n\nLove For Sale\n\nI Got It Bad (and That Ain’t Good)\n\nTakin’ A Chance On Love\n\nEarly Autumn [#25]\n\nSpeak Low\n\nCandy\n\nAnyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home\n\nOld Devil Moon\n\nTeach Me Tonight [#15]\n\nThe Night We Called It A Day\n\nThe One I Love\n\nAnything Goes\n\nWhatcha Know Joe?\n\nTomorrow Mountain\n\nThere are many wonderful Stafford recordings. My favorite is The “Big Band” Sound. It presents 14 tracks recorded mostly in the 60s with three different arrangers and conductors: Paul Weston, Billy May, and Benny Carter. It’s a nice collection that shows of her flexibility and incredible voice all in a style that captures her most productive years. Stafford and Weston selected the tracks themselves and released the set on their own Corinthian label in 19993.\n\nStafford loved the songs of Cole Porter, so it’s fitting that this collection opens with his Love For Sale. Her delivery is flawless as she proves that even though her voice was pure, she could certainly get vocally raunchy when the lyrics demanded it. It’s a lovely performance that shows off her fun side and sets the stage nicely. Next she gets bluesy on Duke Ellington’s I Got It Bad and That Ain’t Good. Plumbing the lower range of her vocals, Stafford shows off just how soulful she could be, making the most of the yearning lyrics.\n\nTakin’ A Chance On Love is a happier song. Placing it next to I Got It Bad shows her emotional as well as vocal range. You can hear her smiling through the speakers. Johnny Mercer’s Early Autumn is one of the two selections that was also one of her many hits and a fine performance. Stafford’s sense of fun is displayed in Speak Low, with wordplay written by Ogden Nash set to the music of Kurt Weill. It’s a wonderful song of romance and one of the disc’s standouts.\n\nStafford’s first #1 was a recording of Candy with Mercer. This set includes her solo performance. It’s a pleasant song and a nice reminder of her early work. She gets bluesy again with Anyplace I Hang My Hat Is Home, a classic travelling song also written by Mercer with Harold Arlen. The way she stretches the notes fits the wanderlust of the song perfectly. Next up is Old Devil Moon, another song about romance delivered with vocal perfection.\n\nTeach Me Tonight is a wonderful song that has been recorded dozens of times. Stafford’s version was one of the most successful on the charts, and her soaring delivery makes that no surprise. After that celebration of love and hope, Stafford gets melancholy for a bit. The Night We Called It A Day is a slow, sad song. She follows it with the unrequited yearning of The One I Love, a jazzy delivery that belies the hopeless situation.\n\nCole Porter returns for a rousing version of Anything Goes. Written in 1934, just as she began her first musical steps, recorded in the 60s and released in 1993, it’s a perfect look at how society changes, in ways that even Porter could never have anticipated. Just naughty enough, it’s a perfect song to shock Stafford’s listeners in the early days and another reminder of how much she loved a good song. The disc wraps up with a fun — if throwaway — Whatcha Know Joe? featuring vocal tradeoffs with a male chorus and a bittersweet reading of Duke Ellington’s Tomorrow Mountain. In 14 solid songs, Stafford and Weston remind us just what a great talent she was and provide a single disc of nearly flawless listening.\n\nFURTHER LISTENING: With five decades of recordings on multiple labels and with many side projects and band as well as her rich solo catalog, Stafford leaves a lot to choose from. Given that her busiest period, 1941 – 1961, predated most of the albums as their own releases period, her work is mostly represented in compilations. Her work was consistent enough that it’s hard to go wrong, but most discs include lesser lights among the gems. The single best set is 1994’s The Portrait Edition, a three-disc, 76-song box set that covers the bulk of her career. It includes most of the hits, some rare gems, and a couple of Jonathan and Darlene Edwards treats. Fans should include this in their collections — along with The “Big Band” Sound — if nothing else."
