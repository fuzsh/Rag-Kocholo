        "text": "With apologies for the slightly blurred image today – I didn’t realise until looking at it for the purposes of this post that it wasn’t perfect.\n\nThe day didn’t get off to a great start. I had looked at the Scopitones website at lunchtime which gave the Saturday timings as doors opening at 3pm, so our arrival at 3.30 meant we missed all but the last song from Everett True, and it wasn’t even him singing The Fall. But then again, his take on Chaise Longue by Wet Leg was fun.\n\nOne of the things about this particular festival is the timings, with the thought process being that anyone going along can seamlessly catch every single act. The main part of Concorde 2 is badged as Le Bikini Stage, while an outdoor area takes the name of the Swim Stage.\n\nA couple of minutes after Everett True stepped off Swim, Cinerama walked onto Le Bikini. The four members of The Wedding Present augmented by Emily on flute and Charlotte on keyboards (apologies for not catching their surnames), while at one point Andrea from Melys joined to provide a co-vocal. It was a short and very enjoyable set:-\n\n146 Degrees\n\nClose Up\n\n7x\n\nEars\n\nSly Curl\n\nApres Ski\n\nCareless\n\nAs If\n\nJust eight songs over what should have been 40 minutes, but with David Gedge chatting away happily on stage, it meant it overran by a few minutes and led to Melys having already begun the acoustic set by the time we ventured outside into what was a blisteringly hot and sunny day. The space was rammed, and we couldn’t really see, so we went back inside to where it was a bit cooler and went down near the front to get ready for what Peter Solowka and Len Liggins from The Ukrainians were going to do.\n\nTurned out it was a mix of a Q&A with some live songs – the questions being asked by David Gedge (who also joined in on the songs on acoustic guitar) – as a way of promoting what looks like a fabulous new book ‘Taking Kyiv to the Kosmos’ which celebrates the now 35-year career of the band (a copy was bought and brought back with us). The talk and performance was a real joy, particularly when they played this\n\nmp3: The Ukranians – Batyar\n\nTheir manic and joyful take on Bigmouth Strikes Again from their 1992 EP, Pizni Iz The Smiths. I never thought I’d hear that played live, and it put a daft grin on my face.\n\nWe forsake watching Jar of Blind Flies, instead making our way just across the road to a beachside cafe for a snack, where we could easily hear the band’s take on noisy alt-rock. Listening in, we were a bit annoyed at ourselves at missing out, but as it was about to get a bit manic for the rest of the evening, a short break really had to be built in.\n\nHaving been sure Batyar would turn out to be my personal highlight of the festival, I was soon proved wrong when the Scottish contingent had their turns in the sun.\n\nClose Lobsters bounced on the main stage at 6pm and delivered a magnificent show. The songs covered their entire career, from the early material of the mid-late 80s right through to brand-new songs that came out on a new EP just last week, with everything in between. We stood near the back of the hall for this show as we were determined to get down the front for the next band on The Swim stage, and with things running marginally late, we had to, very sadly, leave just as Close Lobsters struck the opening notes of their last song:-\n\nmp3: Close Lobsters – Going To Heaven To See If It Rains\n\nAnd so we ended up right down the front for Spare Snare, who very cleverly waited until Close Lobsters had stopped playing before beginning their set. I knew from having a wee catch-up with frontman Jan Burnett a few weeks back that he was really looking forward to being part of the festival, and the plan was to blast out, loudly, fast and energetically, a 35-minute set of what the band was all about.\n\nThey were truly majestic, with a show that was worthy of headlining Glasgow Barrowlands and not the second and temporary stage at Concorde 2 in Brighton. Every song was given a rapturous response by an audience that was growing by the minute as word began to spread about the performance that was unfolding.\n\nI’m not too sure just how many folk at the festival knew of Spare Snare before last Saturday evening, but I’m certain that their name was put into loads of search engines once folk got back to their hotels or returned home. There was certainly quite a line-up at the merch stall the rest of the night, where new fans took the opportunity to press flesh with Jan and the rest of the band, while picking up CDs, t-shirts etc. Oh, at Gatwick Airport waiting patiently for a delayed flight back home, we overheard a group of people who were, by the sounds of things bound for Belfast, talking about the festival and saying that Spare Snare had been the support act they had been most enjoyed, especially as they had not known what to expect.\n\nmp3: Spare Snare – Action Hero (Marc Riley Session Version, 2018)\n\nIt took us a few moments to catch our breath, and by the time we got back inside to the main hall, the show by Miki Berenyi Trio was already underway. I’m sure that quite a few of the audience, the opportunity to hear a few Lush songs sprinkled throughout the set was a real highlight, but it kind of felt a bit ‘after the Lord Mayor’s show’ coming on the back of the two Scottish acts. Still, finishing off with Ladykillers was a nice populist touch that raised a loud cheer.\n\nAgain, it was time for another tough decision. Back out to the Swim stage to see Lande Hekt (who I had enjoyed in Glasgow a few months back) or stay put to ensure a good spot for the second performance of the weekend by The Wedding Present? The opportunity to lean against one of the columns holding up the venue’s roof, thus giving a bit of support to my increasingly stiff back and legs, made our minds up, and so we reluctantly missed out on what by all accounts was a fine show by the Bristol-based singer.\n\nAnd so to the end show. TWP Take II.\n\nAny worries or fear I had from the previous night were quickly allayed. The sound wasn’t nearly as vicious as it had been on Friday – maybe the more gentle performance as part of Cinerama earlier in the day had rubbed off on Vince Lammi on drums as he was way less violent this time around. Rachael Wood proved to be a very fine foil on lead guitar for David Gedge while Paul Blackwood very effectively and efficiently did his bit on bass, often over in the corner out where the stage lights were shining. It was quite the set that seemed to feature a fair-amount of duelling guitars, in which David and Rachael brought out the very best in one another.\n\nRachel\n\nA Million Miles\n\nYou Should Always Keep In Touch With Your Friends\n\nMomento Mori\n\nDalliance\n\nLoveslave\n\nCome Play With Me\n\nCrushed\n\nDon’t Talk, Just Kiss\n\nNobody’s Twisting Your Arm\n\nI Am Not Going To Fall In Love With You\n\nCorduroy\n\nScience Fiction\n\nMy Favourite Dress\n\nMake Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\n\nCrawl\n\nWhat Have I Said Now?\n\nI have avoided describing it as a career-spanning set. 17 songs, of which 13 were originally released between 1987 and 1992. One from 2016 and three from 2022. Nothing whatsoever from Take Fountain, El Rey and Valentina, the three albums that marked the second coming of the band in the 00s and 10s. Over the two nights, six out of nine songs from Bizzaro were played, along with a b-side from that particular era. There really is nothing to complain about.\n\n2025 will mark the fifteenth edition of At The Edge of The Sea and tickets have already gone on sale without knowing anything other than The Wedding Present show on the Friday night will centre around Mini, the six-track EP released in 1996, while Cinerama will play an extended set on the Saturday to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the album Disco Volante.\n\nDavid Gedge looked absolutely knackered at the end of it all. Three sets plus the appearance with The Ukrainians, and at other times doing interviews/chats for those watching a live stream of the event or hanging around the merch stall chatting away to anyone who stopped by. It would take a lot out of anyone half his age – he turns 65 next April – so we might be getting close to a time where it proves nigh on impossible for him to stage the festival. On that basis, there’s every chance we will go back again next year, but it’ll be hard-pressed to better the 2024 event.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Thanks\n\nOne they didn’t play from Bizarro!\n\nOh…..I nearly forgot about my wee postscript.\n\nSunday evening, at the aforementioned Gatwick Airport just waiting to be called to board and I spot various Close Lobsters along with friends and family members. Andrew (lead singer) sits a few seats along from me and Rach with his wife/partner.\n\nI take the opportunity to pass on my appreciation for what had been a great set and apologising for missing the last song. I also mentioned I was marginally disappointed that Foxheads hadn’t been part of the set. He smiled, said thanks and said that everyone in the band had thoroughly enjoyed the whole weekend. On the plane, I found myself in the same row (but across the aisle) from Bob (bass player) and as we get ready to exit having landed in Glasgow, I take another opportunity to repeat what I had said to Andrew, and received a similar reply as to how enjoyable the whole experience had been for the band.\n\nYour humble scribe…..rubbing shoulders with the cream of indie-pop!\n\nJC\n\nMyself and Rachel headed down to Brighton last weekend to take in the annual At The Edge of The Sea festival (aka Gedgefest) at the Concorde 2 venue down on the eastern side of the beachfront.\n\nThree acts on the Friday night and ten on Saturday afternoon/evening. We didn’t catch everyone on the Saturday – a mixture of having to take the occasional rest or getting ourselves into a prime spot inside the main indoor space (Le Bikini Stage) for the next scheduled act meant we didn’t always venture to the smaller outside space (the Swim stage).\n\nWhile I could easily write 20,000 words on everything, I’ll do my best to keep things brief, but it still means splitting things into two pieces.\n\nFriday night’s show had two support acts I knew nothing about beforehand. I could have sought out their music before going down south, but I felt that hearing things fresh on the night was a better way to go about it.\n\nTaffy turn out to be a four-piece band from Japan. Much like Butcher Boy did last week at the Glasgow Weekender, they prove to be the perfect opening act for the festival, evoking memories of the very best of that decade between 1986 and 1996 when indie-music was very much in vogue. Three blokes fronted by a female singer who was also very adept on guitar. My mind was wandering off to the Britpop era, and recalling that while there may well have been too much indie landfill associated with the ‘movement’, there were loads of radio-friendly poptastic tunes that have more than stood the test of time.\n\nmp3: Taffy – Tumbling\n\nA mental note was made to seek out Taffy’s back catalogue (turns out there’s been six albums going back to 2012).\n\nProjector are from Brighton, and are another four-piece band made up of three blokes and a female, but they prove to be quite different from Taffy, making more of a boisterous and noisy post-punk sound, with the set drawn from their debut album Now When We Talk It’s Violence that was released earlier this year. It was an okay show, which I don’t want to sound as if I’m damning it with faint praise because I did enjoy them, but Taffy were a tough act to follow.\n\nFriday night at The Edge of The Sea always closes with a set by The Wedding Present, with the audience knowing that Saturday night closes with a totally separate set by the band. Friday was billed as them performing Watusi in full plus other songs across a 90-minute show.\n\nI’ll cut to the chase – this turned out to be a show that, overall, felt a bit deflating for a few reasons. By bit deflating, I meant it only merited a 7/10 rating in my book.\n\nThe line-up of the band has changed almost beyond recognition from this time last year, with Jonathan Stewart (guitar), Melanie Howard (bass) and Nicholas Wellauer (drums) all departing rather suddenly without explanation, which I found really sad as I felt this particular unit was as good as TWP had sounded at any time since they had come back into being almost 20 years.\n\nDavid Gedge now has, again, a completely new set of musicians comprising Rachael Wood (guitar), Paul Blackburn (bass) and Vince Lammi (drums). The band have been out on the road a fair bit since last November, with many of the shows being centred around the 30th anniversary of Watusi, which was given the deluxe re-issue treatment on vinyl earlier this year across 2x LPs with b-sides from the era and a few alternative mixes being made available. As such, they were more than ready to take things up a notch.\n\nThey opened with Brassneck. It was loud, boisterous and quite manic, but it certainly got the audience going. We Interrupt This Programme, one of the highlights of the 24 Songs project from a couple of years back was next, followed by what can only be described as a blistering take on Dare, the closing moments of felt very much like an unsaid tribute to the late Steve Albini with the guitars cranked up to full volume and the drums pounded to the point where the skins must have been close to breaking.\n\nAnd then Watusi was played in full, from Track 1 to Track 12 in the same order as the album. The problem here is that Watusi is, and I’m being generous, a tad on the patchy side. Maybe inconsistent is a better description. Fair play to the band, the songs I’m not so keen on came across well in the live setting – with a special mention to Catwoman which was stretched out to its full seven-minute length at an ear-splitting volume that My Bloody Valentine would have given their approval to.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Catwoman\n\nBut there’s no doubt that the show lost all sorts of momentum, exemplified by what felt like a limp run-through of Hot Pants, the instrumental which closes the album. I suspect David Gedge was fully aware as he put the show together that he ran the risk of annoying a fair bit of the audience as there proved to be barely a half-second gap between the final note of Hot Pants and the opening and unmistakable riff of Kennedy, long-regarded by most TWP fans as their finest song.\n\nThe rest of the evening passed in a flurry of excitement and much moving of limbs in a moshpit of folk who really should be old enough to better, while the rest of us just swayed and moved a bit less energetically to Everyone Thinks He Looks Daft, Once More, Take Me! and Bewitched. Five closing songs that were just about all anyone could have asked for, although I still had a regret that this line-up didn’t quite do them justice in a way that Stewart, Howard and Wellauer would have.\n\nOutside into the still warm but breezy August evening for the 30-minute walk back through the city centre to our hotel close to the railway station and discovering that our ears were ringing, such was the sonic assault of the evening.\n\nYes, it had been The Wedding Present, and while Rachel had thought it was a magnificent show (she has a penchant for loud music belying her years!!) , I couldn’t help but think I missed the old line-up. I suppose, like Mark E Smith once famously said “If it’s me and your granny on bongos, it’s the Fall”, it’ll always be The Wedding Present when David Gedge is on stage with three other musicians on guitar, bass and drums.\n\nI was also already thinking ahead to the Saturday and wondering what sort of set would close the festival given what had been played on the Friday. OK, there would be nothing from Watusi which was a good thing, but four of the best from Bizzaro had been aired while just one song from the 21st century catalogue had been played. It was going to be intriguing.\n\nPart 2 of the review will appear tomorrow, again as a bonus post later in the day.\n\nJC\n\nEl Rey was released at the end of May 2008. It contained 11 tracks, but rather annoyingly, there was a 12th track made available but only through a download via the ITunes store.\n\nThe CD was purchased. And for the first time since The Wedding Present had ‘reconvened’, I found myself rather underwhelmed. Looking back, my expectations were far too high, thinking that El Rey, with the involvement of Steve Albini, was going to be Seamonsters Mark 2. It does have a number of more than very decent moments, but overall it doesn’t quite have the consistency of most other albums.\n\nAs mentioned last week, the album was preceded by a digital release of The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend. I was certainly anticipating a physical release for any future singles to be taken from the album, but that’s not how it turned out. I genuinely can’t recall if there was a digital download made available for this one, but there was a promo video put out for fans to enjoy\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Don’t Take Me Home Until I’m Drunk\n\nTrack 8 on El Rey, and one that was co-written by guitarist Chris McConville who had joined back in 2006 but was soon to leave again after the promotional activities around touring El Rey were completed at the end of 2009. It’s the sort of song you could imagine Cinerama writing and recording, not least for all the references to Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the song title being akin to a line spoken in that film by Holly Golightly, played memorably by Audrey Hepburn.\n\nLater in the year, a box set called How The West Was Won was issued by Vibrant Records. If you want to buy a second-hand copy via Discogs, it is listed under the singles section of music by The Wedding Present. If you head to the band’s website, it is listed under the albums section. No wonder it is proving awkward to keep track of what should be curated as a single for this particular series.\n\nMy rule of thumb is that EPs should be included. How The West Was Won contained four separate CDS, each being called as EP, and each with four tracks. The first of them saw the first physical non-promotional release of the ‘Girlfriend’ EP, while the second was called the Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk EP.\n\nIn addition to the album version of the song, there was an acoustic take and a remix, which was the work of the song’s co-writer, Chris McConville:-\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present -Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk (acoustic version)\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Don’t Take Me Home Till I’m Drunk (Team Wah Wah remix)\n\nThe former is, again, what you’d fully expect from its description. The latter has all sort of instrumentation and technical gadgetry thrown at it. It’s certainly different, but it really acts as a reminder that TWP songs don’t really benefit from any sort of radical type of remix.\n\nThe EP contained one entirely new song.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – Pinch, Twist, Pull, Release\n\nThere’s no production credits given within the box set, so I’m not sure if this was one that was worked up in the Chicago studio with Steve Albini or at a separate session – the band had been in a couple of studios prior to making the trip to Chicago. It’s kind of TWP by numbers, but I don’t mean that in a derogatory way. It’s a slow, brooding and sad number, with quiet and loud moments throughout, with the protagonist trying hard to explain why this particular relationship has come to an end. It wouldn’t have been out of place on many an album, and feels as if it was kind of wasted by being tucked away on this EP.\n\nI’ll return again to How The West Was Won next Sunday.\n\nJC\n\nThe summer job lasted six weeks and all too soon I was back at school, entering 5th Year, but with the consolation that lunchtimes and other short breaks could be spent sitting in a common room instead of outside in the inevitably pouring rain crowded underneath whatever shelter could be found. Music was allowed in the common room….usually through listening to BBC Radio 1, although as the weeks and months passed and after someone had brought in a spare machine, home-made cassettes became the order of the day.\n\nMy introduction to many of the songs which entered the charts in August 1979 will straddle the last couple of weeks at Halford’s and the first couple of weeks spent learning and gearing up for the inevitable exams that would, hopefully, lead to being deemed smart enough to go the uni in due course. Kind of makes this one appropriate\n\nmp3: Ian Dury & The Blockheads – Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3)\n\nA new entry, at #45, into the chart of 29 July – 4 August 1979. In some ways this demonstrates the differences in how differently music and musicians were marketed back then. Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick had gone to #1 in January 1979 but Stiff Records didn’t seek an immediate cash-in, waiting the best parts of six months to release the follow-up. Nowadays, it’s more likely to be a gap of six days. Reasons To Be Cheerful was great fun to listen to, and to try and decipher the lyrics. I imagine it was difficult enough if you were from Ian Dury‘s neck of the woods, but it was near impossible a few hundred miles to the north.\n\nI’m guessing this had something of a low-key release given it only came in at #45, but at the same time I think it’s fair to surmise there were all sorts of promotional activities happening as it charted, possibly involving TV appearances, as it jumped up all the way to #6 the following week, eventually peaking at #3. Not that any of us knew it, but it was the last time the band would make it into the Top 20.\n\nA new group experienced their first taste of success, thanks to their debut single coming in at #58.\n\nmp3: The Merton Parkas – You Need Wheels\n\nA mod revival was just getting into full swing, and a number of groups with such leanings were snapped up by different labels keen to offer ways for impressionable teenagers to part with their pocket money. Beggars Banquet signed The Merton Parkas, a four-piece from South London, two of whose members were brothers, Danny Talbot (vocals/guitars) and Mick Talbot (keyboards). Their debut single did go on to reach #40, but none of its follow-ups nor their debut album bothered the chart compilers. The band would break up in 1980, but Mick Talbot, after taking a phone call from Paul Weller a few years later, would become one of the most successful and recognisable pop starts of the early-mid 80s.\n\nmp3: Joe Jackson – Is She Really Going Out With Him (#66)\n\nJoe Jackson‘s debut single in late 1978 had flopped, much to the disappointment of all concerned at A&M Records who were convinced they had signed someone who was on a par, musically and lyrically, with Elvis Costello. The debut album, released in March 1979, had stalled while a further two singles had flopped miserably. Everyone involved was probably gearing up to cut their losses…..except that over in America, a few DJs and writers began to play and talk up Joe Jackson and his band as being worthy members of this emerging scene that had been dubbed ‘new wave’. Back in those days, if America was bigging you up, then the UK media took a bit of notice and the musician’s profile began to grow. The record label cashed in and re-released the flop debut single which this time round did chart. It would eventually spend 13 weeks in the Top 75, peaking at #13, paving the way for Joe Jackson to enjoy a fruitful year in 1980 with his second album. As it turned out, he never did shine quite as brightly as Costello, but he has more than maintained a successful career in music and composing for what isn’t now too far off 50 years.\n\nI hope that this series is demonstrating that 1979 was a fabulous year for chart singles, but it shouldn’t be forgotten that these competing and being outsold by a lot of dreadful singles. The top end of the charts in August was dominated by mainstays such Cliff Richard, Abba, Darts, Showaddydaddy and Boney M, which all too often got playted on Radio 1 – which is why the move to a cassette player in the 5th Year Common Room was inevitable.\n\nToo much of the above and not enough of this new entry at #52:-\n\nmp3 :The B52s – Rock Lobster\n\nThere was a small number of us in that common room who loved the sound of The B52s. There was one girl who adored their look and quietly began to incorporate some of it into her everyday dress without getting into bother for flouting rules around school uniforms. But given that the band, certainly for the early part of their career, rarely got above cult status, this was likely typical of how they were viewed across the country with very few people ‘getting’them. Rock Lobster eventually got to #37 in 1979. It was re-released in 1986 and reached #12.\n\nA couple other new entries from the 5-11 August chart worth mentioning in passing.\n\nmp3: Roxy Music – Angel Eyes (#32)\n\nThe Roxy Music of the early 70s was certainly no more. The glam/experimental nature of the early years was now being replaced by a more sophisticated disco-influenced sound, that it in turn would manifest into MOR. The music was now less of a ‘must have’ to the music snobs, but it was increasingly selling to the masses. Angel Eyes was one of eight Top 20 hits between 1979 and 1982, of which six went Top 10. Bryan Ferry had achieved his ambition of being a bona fide pop star.\n\nmp3: Sister Sledge – Lost In Music (#58)\n\nOne of a number of disco classics from 1979 that made Sister Sledge one of the year’s most popular and successful acts – they were in the singles chart for a total of 31 weeks while their debut album We Are Family peaked at #7 and spent 39 weeks in the chart. Included in this feature as anyone suggesting that The Fall would one day record a cover version of Lost In Music would have been taken away and locked in a darkened room for their own safety.\n\nThe chart of 12-18 August wasn’t all that different from the one of the previous week in that nothing new came into the Top 75 any higher than #48. But at least it was a good tune.\n\nmp3: The Stranglers – Duchess\n\nI know The Stranglers divide opinion. They alwways have. Back in the late 70s, there were many critics who accused them of being talentless bandwagon jumpers who were no more than grubby old pub rockers who had taken advantage of the emergence of punk to reinvent themselves. They were rightly accused of being sexist and misogynist through many of their lyrics, while the use of strippers at live shows caused many an NME journalist to froth at the mouth. But they were more than capbable of churning out the occasional pop/new wave classic. Duchess is one of their finest moments, eventually reaching #14, one of the fifteen times they would crack the Top 30, maling them regulars on Top of The Pops well into the 80s.\n\nI’ll mention in passing some of the other acts who entered the Top 75 this week, again to help illustrate the mediocre and mundane nature of most chart singles. The Crusaders (#54), Dollar (#59), Fat Larry’s Band (63) and Racey (#68). The new entry at #71 helped to make up for it\n\nmp3: The Rezillos – I Can’t Stand My Baby\n\nI’ll be honest and admit I had no idea that this, as part of a double-A side with a cover of I Wanna Be Your Man (a 19963 hit for The Rolling Stones that had been written by Lennon & McCartney), has sneaked into the chart for a 1-week stay in 1979. It was a re-release of the band’s debut single that had flopped back in 1977, but of course they had enjoyed a couple of subsequent hits with Top of The Pops (#17 in August 1978) and Destination Venus (#43 in November 1978).\n\nMoving quickly along to the chart of 19-25 August.\n\nThe highest new entry this week coincided with my return to school. The perfect anthem for any 16-year old desperate to take on the world and make an impression\n\nmp3: The Jam – When You’re Young (#25)\n\nThere was now absolutely no doubt that I had a favourite band whose music was really consuming me. Before the year was out, I’d get to see them at the Glasgow Apollo, the first of five such times at the famous old venue between 1979 and 1982. I’d also travel a couple of times over to Edinburgh, and for many years, The Jam were the band I could claim I’d seen more than any other. When You’re Young went onto reach #17. It would be a few more months before The Jam really first experienced superstardom in terms of chart singles.\n\nThe next highest new entry at #43 is another, like The Rezillos from the previous week, seeing this when doing the research caught me by surprise. It was none other than the Spiral Scratch EP, the debut effort by Buzzcocks that I’d long forgotten had been given a reissue and re-release in 1979, with a slighly different sleeve and label to differtiate it from the January 1977 version. The sleeve attributed the songs to Buzzcocks with Howard Devoto.\n\nmp3: Buzzcocks – Boredom\n\nI know this wasn’t the lead track on the EP, but it’s my favourite of the four. The re-release enjoyed a six-week stay in the charts, peaking at #31. Worth mentioning that Harmony In My Head was still in the singles chart that same week, sitting at #60 for what would be the last week of a six-week stay in the Top 75.\n\nThe final chart of the month covers August 26 – September 1.\n\nFor the second week running, the highest new entry of them all was a belter of a tune.\n\nmp3: Gary Numan – Cars (#20)\n\nTechnically, the follow-up to Are Friends Electric by the now disbanded Tubeway Army. This was Gary Numan‘s debut under his own name and would prove to be his most successful, going all the way to #1 during what was an 11-week stay in the Top 75. Say what you like about Gary Numan (and plenty of people have done so in a less than complimentary manner) but Cars still sounds fresh and invogorating 45 years after its initial hearing.\n\nAnd finally for the month of August 1979. A song creeping in at the foot of the singles almost unnoticed at #74. It was the seven-piece band’s debut single. It’s b-side was a cover version and had the same title as the name of the band.\n\nmp3 : Madness – The Prince\n\nAlong with The Specials whose own debut single had charted just a few weeks earlier (and was sitting at #6 this very week, Madness be at the forefront of a reinvigoration of ska music. Nobody could probably have imagined it at the time that the band would still be going strong 45 years on, maybe not quite getting the chart success of olden days, but they continue to be a top draw when it comes to live shows. National Treasures? I think it’s fair to suggest they are.\n\nJC\n\nSWC/Barry Stubbs over at No Badger Required is currently in the middle of a series about the Olympics. As you might expect, the posts are very well crafted, packed with personal anecdotes that will inevitably crack a smile from even the most stone-faced person on the planet, always accompanied by a selection of interesting tunes taken from all sorts of genres.\n\nHis post about swimming got me thinking that I probably had more than enough tunes on the hard drive to come up with some sort of half-decent ICA. Feel free to dive in and enjoy, while noting some of them did feature on the post over at NBD.\n\nSIDE A\n\n1. Swim – Madder Rose\n\nMadder Rose, from New York City, released four albums of decent enough indie-pop in the 90s and then, like so many of their peers, reformed a few decades later to take advantage of the fact that so many of their original fans had got to a stage in life when their circumstances meant they had a bit mote disposable income to spend on new music and going to see them play live again after such a long hiatus.\n\nSwim, which was also released as a single in 1993, can be found on the debut album Bring It Down. I am a bit of a sucker for the way Mary Lorson delivers her vocal in such a dreamy and understated way, and is something of a perfect fit for the tune written by the band’s guitarist, Billy Coté\n\n2. The Blue Line – Out of The Swim\n\nA four-piece band from Falkirk, an industrial town located halfway between Glasgow and Edinburgh with an uncanny ability to produce a ridiculous amount of talented musicians, writers and authors. This is the opening track from the album Rescue Therapy, released on Last Night From Glasgow in 2022.\n\n3. Swim Until You Can’t See Land – Frightened Rabbit\n\nThought long and hard about this. Still find it occasionally difficult to listen to some of the Frightened Rabbit songs in the aftermath of singer Scott Hutchison‘s suicide back in 2018, with this one being down to the fact that having last been seen walking towards a road bridge spanning the Firth of Forth, his body was found on the banks of the river.\n\nBut then again, this is not a song about death/suicide. Scott, in an interview at the time of the release of the album The Winter of Mixed Drinks (2010) said it was inspired by a Ben Kingsley film, The Wackness.\n\n“There’s a scene in it which Kingsley’s character goes down to the sea and starts swimming and swimming. I think he’s trying to kill himself, but he gets so far and realises he’d rather come back. ‘Swim Until You Can’t See Land’ was the title I had in my mind before I even started writing the album; I was becoming more and more interested in the idea of a rejection of the habits and behaviour most people see as normal, and in turn embracing a certain madness. It’s about losing your mind in order to reset the mind and the body. Forget what’s gone before and wash it out. This is not necessarily a geographical journey, as the ‘swim’ can involve any activity in which you can lose yourself. It’s a good introduction to the record, as the theme unravels therein.”\n\n4. Swimming Pools (Drank) – Kendrick Lamar\n\nFrom the 2012 album Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. As someone else has so eloquently said elsewhere on t’internet, ‘What sounds like a club anthem is actually an introspective take on the social pressure and self-defeating attitudes that drive people to drink.’\n\nIt’s an immense piece of music.\n\n5. Nightswimming – R.E.M.\n\nThe beautiful and haunting piano-led one from the multi-multi-multi million selling Automatic For The People (1992).\n\nIt’s a lovely piece of music.\n\nSIDE B\n\n1. Swimming Pool, Movie Stars – The Wedding Present\n\nI’m fully expecting to hear this played live this coming Friday night when myself and Rachel make our way down to Brighton to get ourselves along to the 2024 edition of ‘At The Edge Of The Sea’, the annual two-day festival curated by David Gedge at which both his bands will be performing. The Wedding Present live shows this year have been to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of Watusi….thus the levels of expectation!\n\n2. Let’s Go Swimming – Allo Darlin’\n\nSoft-centred indie-pop of the finest type. From the band’s eponymous debut album, released back in 2010. They’ve been away for along while, but a new album has been recorded and with a bit of luck it’ll see the light of day before the year is out.\n\n3. Sink Or Swim – The Delgados\n\nUniversal Audio was the fifth and final studio album to be released by The Delgados. It’s hard to believe that it was fully 20 years ago. I had hoped, when they reformed and played the live shows in 2022/23, that it might somehow lead to new material. But with two members of the band now immersed in making a living in occupations that have nothing to do with music, I have to accept it was always going to be a forlorn hope.\n\n4. Cloudbusting Lovesong – Swimmer One\n\nSwimmer One were an Edinburgh-based group, formed by Hamish Brown and Andrew Eaton-Lewis in 2002, with Laura Cameron Lewis joining the line-up in 2007, with their music really being an electronica take on indie. There were two albums and a handful of singles before they called it a day in 2013.\n\nThis is a one half of a double-A released in 2006 single – I don’t have said single, only discovering it years later via t’internet. It’s a very intriguing take on the Kate Bush song, which then segues into one by The Cure. Dating from 2006 means it was recorded prior to Laura joining the band, and the female vocal on this occasion is courtesy of Cora Bissett, who has been mentioned before, being the lead singer in Darlingheart and whose theatrical show What Girls Are Made Of was reviewed on the blog back in 2019.\n\n5. Swim For Health – Ballboy\n\nSide A of this ICA finished with a beautiful and haunting ballad…..and likewise Side B. If anything, this one is even more beautiful and haunting.\n\nThis was originally released on the Girls Are Better Than Boys EP in 2001, and later included on the album Club Anthems, released the same year.\n\nJC\n\nButcher Boy tend not to do things in a hurry, particularly in recent years as many members of the Glasgow-based indie/chamber pop band have concentrated on their family lives and careers.\n\nTheir most recent studio album was Helping Hands, released in 2011. There has since been one EP, Bad Things Happen When It’s Quiet (2017) and a truly essential compilation album You Had A Kind Face, released in 2022 on Needle Mythology, the label owned and run by the acclaimed music writer, Pete Paphides. The real bonus for fans with this compilation was the inclusion of an additional 7″ single, onto which three brand-new songs were pressed.\n\nThe last live show was back in Glasgow in April 2017 to coincide with the release of the above-mentioned EP. I’m very fortunate in being friendly with a few of the band members, and I’ve no doubt they’ve had their patience tested with how often I asked ‘any new songs or live shows in the offing?’ fully aware that the sad look on their faces and the shake of their heads would provide an answer I didn’t want to receive.\n\nBut earlier this year, it was whispered into my ear that Butcher Boy had been asked personally by Stuart Murdoch of Belle and Sebastian to be on the bill of the first ever staging of ‘The Glasgow Weekender’, a two-day festival that he and his band were organising and curating over the first weekend in August at the SWG3 complex in the west end of the city.\n\nCue excitement.\n\nButcher Boy were given the honour of being the first band to play, opening proceedings on the Friday early evening on the larger outdoor stage. Stuart, as part of his overall welcoming remarks to the audience, did the introductions, adding that Butcher Boy were one of his favourites and how happy he was they were making their live comeback after such a long time. He wasn’t alone in feeling that way.\n\nThe clock had ticked round to 5.25pm, and to rapturous applause from several hundred people who had made it along to the early start, John (acoustic guitar and vocals), Alison (keyboards), Basil (guitar), Garry (bass), Findlay (drums), Cat (violin) and Maya (cello), took to the stage all looking a shade on the nervous side and maybe even a touch overawed.\n\nA first show in seven years on the back of just a handful of recent rehearsals, as not everyone now lives in or close to Glasgow.\n\nIt was also in front of an audience who may have given them a great reception as they took to the stage, but would include a fair number who weren’t necessarily here to see them specifically, and indeed might not be fully familiar with their music.\n\nAdd in that it’s an outdoor gig for a band who have long specialised in playing intimate indoor venues best suited to their music, and so it’s no surprise that nerves are on show. I’ll own up, as a long-time fan, that I was shaking slightly, a mixture of excitement and anticipation alongside just wanting it to all go as well as possible.\n\nUp above, the clouds are growing darker and more menacing. Even worse, the wind is increasing in strength, and a sudden gust catches the score that Maya has in front of her in the centre of the stage and threatens to scatter the sheets of paper in all directions. Cat comes to the rescue and disaster is averted.\n\nJohn gives a reassuring glance to the string section and then offers what looks like a quiet smile to everyone else as he does a bit more tuning of his acoustic guitar and adjusts the height of his mic stand, both of which just give everyone a few extra seconds to further settle. He then takes one final look around, before giving a nod of the head to send a signal that it was showtime.\n\nAlison plays the gentle notes of a song that so often had opened previous live shows in years gone by. Findlay, Basil and Garry quietly join in. John sings the opening lines while Cat and Maya gaze at their scores, preparing for the moment in the song where their contributions take it to a higher and more emotional level. It is utterly mesmerising, and I’m not ashamed to admit that I find myself getting a bit emotional, maybe even teary. Seven years have made this moment a long wait.\n\nmp3: Butcher Boy – When I’m Asleep\n\nThe song ends and the audience erupts. The band go into their second song, an uptempo number from their debut album that was released back in 2007. There is dancing down at the front of the stage – possibly even further back, but I’m too busy being enchanted and mesmerised by the music to look behind me.\n\nBefore long, the heavens open and it is soon raining heavily. But that’s why festival goers in Glasgow always carry rain jackets, and those of us braving the elements simply add a layer of clothing and watch on in awe as the band deliver a set of what turns out to be just over 30 minutes in length, offering up all sorts of favourites from the back catalogue as well as giving a first ever performance of one of the new songs that had been made available with the Needle Mythology 7″ release:-\n\nmp3: Butcher Boy – Dear John\n\nThe rain and wind intensifies further to the extent that Cat and Maya for the final two songs have to retreat a bit on the stage as their precious and expensive instruments are in danger of getting soaked. Alison laughs, and occasionally giggles, her way through the set, clearly having a whale of a time. Findlay likewise never stops smiling, and at one time in a short gap between songs, he gets up from behind his drum kit to photograph the audience. Garry and Basil are proving to be the ultimate professionals, occasionally giving waves to friends and family members they spot in the audience, none of whom have shifted away despite the elements. John is fully concentrating on his singing and playing to the extent that I’m convinced he hasn’t even noticed the rain is falling. His performance, like the rest of the band is proving to be note-perfect and awe-inspiring. The nerves, if indeed there really were any, are nowhere to be seen and we, lucky audience that we are, are being treated to a show for the ages.\n\nThe only regret is that it was all over far too quickly, but the short set was the contractual agreement, with the stage having to be readied for the next band to come on at 6.30pm.\n\nWhen I’m Asleep\n\nProfit In Your Poetry\n\nCarve A Pattern\n\nSunday Bells\n\nI Know Who You Could Be\n\nDear John\n\nDays Like These Will Be The Death Of Me\n\nHelping Hands\n\nThere Is No One Who Can Tell You Where You’ve Been\n\nWord afterwards was that John has written quite a number of new songs and maybe, just maybe, there will be some studio activity in the hopefully not too distant future. If that does happen, the icing on the cake would be some live shows to help promote any new release.\n\nDreaming is free.\n\nJC\n\nSingle #35 was Ringway to Seatac, released on CD in October 2005.\n\nThe information on the official website for The Wedding Present and Cinerama doesn’t have any entries for singles between then and 2012……and yet, Discogs, the most popular ‘market’ for picking up second-hand copies of vinyl and CDs lists has three releases for 2008. Here’s the opening part of why…….\n\n2006 and 2007 were very busy years for the band in terms of going out on tour, firstly to further promote Take Fountain, while the following year saw shows which primarily celebrated the 20th anniversary of the release of debut album George Best.\n\n2008 began with everyone heading over to Chicago to the studio of Steve Albini to begin work on what was going to be the seventh studio album. Settling on the title of El Rey, the album was released in May 2008, initially in the USA on the LA-located indie Manifesto Records and a week or so later in the UK on a newly-established label, Vibrant Records, based in the south of England.\n\nThis was the era when digital, rather than physical, releases seemed to be all the rage. As such, the song issued as a precursor to the new album was a digital release only, albeit promo CDs were pressed up and sent out to radio stations. This was the info contained with the CDs:-\n\nThe obvious confusion is that Track 1, which most radio station producers/DJs would assume is the one to be aired is a remix, while the album version is tucked away as Track 4. I’m not sure if it actually got much in the way of airplay – the label was incredibly small and certainly wouldn’t have had the resources in terms of finance and personnel to make strong and direct pushes – but if it did, I can only assume it was this version that was aired\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend (Jet-Age Mix)\n\nThe unusual departure being that it’s of call and response number in places, while occasionally becoming a duet with Terry De Castro adding her fine vocal to that of David Gedge.\n\nIt’s a decent enough song without being truly outstanding. It’s actually a rather creepy lyric when you break it down, with David singing that he went to all sorts of boring things with his (male) friend in the hope that his mate’s girlfriend would be there too. For her part, Terry admits to having feelings in return, but states that her boyfriend would be devastated if she were to leave him for someone who is supposed to be a close friend.\n\nI did buy a download, and was particularly keen, being a huge fan of the Seamonsters album, to hear the Albini version as I was excited that he was working with The Wedding Present again.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend (Santa Monica and La Brea version)\n\nFirst thing to note…..it’s almost two minutes longer than the remix. It opens with a lengthy and initially downbeat instrumental section in which an automated voice repeats the word ‘WAIT’, before the Albini trademark of loud guitars break in after about a minute. These continue for the best part of another minute before the same automated voice goes into a countdown from 12 to 1, at which point the song lifts off. I immediately preferred this take to the remix, which got me quite excited about the forthcoming release of El Rey.\n\nHere’s the two other versions made available via the download:-\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend (acoustic version)\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – The Thing I Like Best About Him Is His Girlfriend (GR’s Man-Made Island Edition)\n\nThe former gets a nice touch from the inclusion of a quietly-played organ in the background, but otherwise is probably what you’d expect from its description. The latter is more experimental in nature and the production duties were undertaken by the band’s drummer Graeme Ramsay, who had joined in 2007 (and would, in later years, move to guitar). It’s one that I like a lot…..but that could probably be down to the fact I have an inherent bias to Graeme Ramsay’s work as he’s a Raith Rovers fan!\n\nJC\n\nSWC over at No Badger Required has a long-running series called ‘Near Perfect Albums’. #118 in the series appeared last month, and it looked at Anarachy by Chumbawamba, released in 1994 on One Little Indian Records.\n\nHis piece has actually provided me with a few of pieces of inspiration. Yesterday’s monthly mix included Give The Anarchist A Cigarette, the very first track to be found on the album.\n\nHe also made reference later in his piece to one of the gentler sounding tracks, on which the lead vocal was taken by the angelic-sounding Lou Watts.\n\nmp3: Chumbawamba – Georgina\n\nI remember on my first listen to the Chumbawamba record being totally enchanted by this one, partly as I picked up the references right away given the entire lyric is based on the story/plot of the 1989 film The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.\n\nThe film is a visual and sonic tour de force thanks to the direction of Peter Greenaway and the score by Michael Nyman.\n\nIt is not for the faint of heart, with gore and violence very much to the fore, much of it perpetrated by ‘The Thief’, a man called Albert Spica who was played to perfection by Michael Gambon. There’s also a fair amount of sex and nudity, almost all of involving ‘His Wife’ (Georgina Spica, played by Helen Mirren) and ‘Her Lover’ (Michael, played by Alan Howard). Oh, and ‘The Cook’, (Richard Boarst, played by Richard Bohringer) plays a key role in how the plot develops and unfolds.\n\nIt was one of the first films that myself and Rachel went to see together. It wasn’t maybe the wisest of choices given we were in the throes of just embarking on an affair while we were both married to other people, and the film does not have anything like a happy ending for the lovers. But then again, given we are still together 35 years later, you could say we passed some sort of test with flying colours.\n\nIncidentally, me mentioning the lack of happy ending shouldn’t really act as a spoiler alert given that the lyrics to the Chumbawamba song provide a full reveal.\n\nAfterwards, both of us couldn’t stop talking about the score that had accompanied the film. Neither of us would claim to be all that knowledgable about classical music, particularly the work of 20th century composers. Michael Nyman’s name was known to us, mainly from his association with Greenaway, for whom he provided cinematic scores that were lavished with praise in the broadsheet newspapers.\n\nA few days later, I bought a cassette copy of the soundtrack. It would have been difficult to explain to my then wife if I’d taken home a vinyl or a CD copy given that I couldn’t admit to having been at the film, far less why I was suddenly taking a liking to some classical music.\n\nI still have that cassette. There’s just five pieces of music on it, but with a total running time of some 40 minutes. The opening track on side one is the one that stuck mostly with myself and Rachel when talking about it all afterwards. It is more than 12 minutes long.\n\nmp3 : The Michael Nyman Band – Memorial\n\nNyman had actually written this piece of music some five years prior to the film being made.\n\nIt had been written as a much longer piece to commemorate the deaths of the 39 football fans at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, prior to the match between Liverpool and Juventus in the final of the European Cup. The piece in its entirety was performed just once, and what Nyman described as its fifth movement, was used as the centrepiece for the film soundtrack of The Cook etc…\n\nI know this isn’t the normal sort of thing you find at this little corner of t’internet, but I hope you’ll allow me to indulge myself on this occasion.\n\nJC\n\nA guest posting by flimflamfan\n\nAfter three unsuccessful attempts (London twice and Madrid) I, at last, saw the reformed Heavenly grace the live stage at Glas-Goes Pop.\n\nEven this gig-going venture was not without its drama. It was only on the morning of the gig that I realised I couldn’t find my ticket. I wasn’t even sure I could attend, but the mystery of the alleged ticket purchase proved to be unsolvable and vexatious. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nI decided to ask some folk ‘I know’ if they could assist but that proved fruitless. Lastly, I posted my plight on Twitter (yes, Twitter – X? Tsk!) a way of letting go of some frustration – lo and behold, a very kind Twitter pal got in touch to say he couldn’t make it and that I could have his ticket – gratis. This was amazing, generous news that took the pressure off what would have been a really crap day searching emails for the elusive ticket. Conversely, it put the nicest possible pressure on me, as I now felt somewhat obliged to attend.\n\nThe band would be on stage at 10.30-ish. I live just a 20-minute walk away from the venue. At 9.30 I made my decision to attend.. Soon after I made my way to the venue to meet a good friend and another with whom I haven’t seen in decades.\n\nI no sooner entered the building – only a few minutes really – before Heavenly was on stage. I found a corner and I stood in it. My friends joined me a few moments later.\n\nI won’t attempt a setlist rundown. Suffice to say, from opening to close, this gig was a thing of beauty. All my cares? All my worries? Where had they gone? Please excuse the colourful language to follow – in that moment I couldn’t give a flying fuck. This level of joy, of otherworldliness – wrapped in the familiar of comfort – was a feeling I’ve not experienced in the longest time. My last gig was in July 2014 and while it had its moments, it was not the musical behemoth before me.\n\nIn a set peppered with ‘hits’ there were some rather lovely little nuggets too, all played with, on occasion, a wide-eyed exuberance that a 1976 punk band would be adored for. Alas, this is Heavenly and Heavenly doesn’t ‘do’ punk – except, of course, when it pummel-stomps you into the ground with just the slightest hint of pop sensibility.\n\nAs for the vocal harmonies… well, I’ll respond to those in the stereotypical heterosexual manner required – swoon!\n\nMusically, Heavenly were as tight as a gnat’s chuff (as my granny used to say) albeit with one hiccup. We won’t mention the band member because that would be bass- shaming ;- )\n\nHonestly, how can a band be so incredibly together yet still having that wonderful sense of punk-ramshackle. It, at times, feels like a house of cards – and as an observer you’re watching to see which card topples first. It never happens. The house of cards is solid – possibly evo-sticked (look it up kidz).\n\nDoes the band project that sense of potential-shamble onto us, the audience, or do we project that onto them? Either way there seems to be some band-wide sleight of hand that makes Heavenly’s presence on stage all the more magical.\n\nHeavenly live is a tour de force. If ever you feel to need to enquire of yourself “what of significance happened after punk?” The answer is this. This, that went on to spawn not just riot grrrl but oh so many differing variations of pop-political noise and just count ‘em records labels all acknowledging a debt.\n\ninfectious and energising – a cohesive coming together of people who like music – band and fans. What’s not to like?\n\nHeavenly has to work harder than most due largely to a historical hostile music press that didn’t have the intelligence to quite understand, or the interest to explore, what the band were singing about nor their noise-nick cannon of songs. It was lazy, male dominated journalism that languishes unread in history.\n\nAs Heavenly announced the last song of the night I was all but sure it would be….\n\nIt was.\n\nA guest vocalist was invited onto the stage and I admit I gave a little internal wince. Bang! What an encore. A fan on stage singing one of the most popular of songs and I believe the term is ‘owned it’. There was so much fun on that stage it was infectious and energising – a cohesive coming together of people who like music – band and fans. What’s not to like?\n\nHeavenly? It was. They always will be.\n\nmp3: Heavenly – C Is The Heavenly Option\n\n© photo courtesy of Glas-Goes Pop\n\nJC\n\nI finished off last week by referring to the February 2005 release of Take Fountain, the so-called ‘comeback’ record by The Wedding Present, their sixth studio album all told, but their first since September 1996.\n\nIt was perhaps a bit disappointing for all concerned that the album only reached #68 in the UK charts, which was a much poorer performance than any of the previous five efforts. But then again, it performed way better than any of the three Cinerama albums that had been issued in the intervening years, as none of them cracked the Top 100.\n\nI think that what makes it all the more disappointing is the fact that Take Fountain is an excellent record, packed throughout with great songs. Sure, it is completely different in sound from the 80s and 90s ‘classics’, but David Gedge‘s songwriting skills and talents had matured considerably, and there was never really any chance of him churning out another set of tunes akin to George Best or Bizarro.\n\nThere is a (mostly) fine summary of the album over at allmusic, written by Andy Kelman:-\n\n“From the start, Cinerama was not a drastic diversion from the Wedding Present. David Gedge rounded off whatever remaining edges were left in the Weddoes’ sound and developed a crack chamber pop group. Softer songs off Watusi and Saturnalia, such as “Catwoman,” “2, 3 Go,” and “Real Thing,” dropped hints.\n\nGedge’s gruff yelps vanished, replaced by bedroom whispers; roaring electric guitars were swapped out for delicate acoustic strums, with extensive use of strings, brass, woodwinds, and keyboards. After Cinerama released their first album, they began to sound more and more like the Wedding Present, to the point where the two groups were virtually indistinguishable from one another.\n\nIn 2004, Gedge and his associates began recording the fourth Cinerama album with Watusi producer Steve Fisk and resurfaced instead with the sixth Wedding Present album. To no surprise, Take Fountain sounds just like Cinerama and the Wedding Present. Opener “Interstate 5” gets it across right off the bat, its first six minutes an effectively repetitive chugging groove that shifts into a drifting hybrid of Ennio Morricone and John Barry for the final two minutes — a bracing zip up the West Coast turns into a restful gondola ride alongside an Italian village.\n\nFrom then on, the album is populated by a range of three- to four-minute pop songs that you’re accustomed to hearing from Gedge. For every hushed, playful passage, there’s an explosive chorus, and for every verse dealing with some form of romantic frustration, there’s…a bunch of romantically frustrated verses. Most songs are of the standard that made Gedge one of the most loved indie figures of the ’80s and ’90s, though the bluntly sexual phrasings that repelled George Best/Tommy-era fans from Watusi, Saturnalia, and everything released by Cinerama remain. Take Fountain is a solid Wedding Present album, one that will satisfy those who have been following Gedge all along.”\n\nWhile I take umbrage at his assertion that after Cinerama released their first album they began to sound more and more like the Wedding Present (a point of view which could easily be dismissed by reading all that strangeways has offered up on this blog in recent months), Kelman’s overall take is quite sound.\n\nOne more single – a very low-key affair, was issued on CD, in October 2005:-\n\nmp3 : The Wedding Present – Ringway to Seatac\n\nRomantically frustrated indeed!!!\n\nI’m thinking that the single was issued partly as a vehicle to finally release the one last song recorded during the Take Fountain sessions that hadn’t yet seen the light of day:-\n\nmp3 : The Wedding Present – Shivers\n\nNo loud guitars or drums. A slow and very resigned vocal delivery over what is almost a music-box style accompaniment. More evidence that the musicians had gone into the Seattle studio prepared to make a Cinerama album. And while it was mostly possible to re-arrange things so that everything now sounded like a TWP song, it just wasn’t feasible with Shivers. It’s a real oddity, but one that has a certain amount of charm.\n\nOne other track was made available, but it was recorded separately and Dare Mason, who had been involved in all three Cinerama albums, is given a production credit.\n\nmp3: The Wedding Present – American Tan\n\nIt’s a strange one. There’s nothing remotely Cinerama-sounding about it, despite those involved in the production. It’s only 95 seconds long, and it comes to a rather sudden stop, despite there having been a continuous lyric. The lack of any instrumental break has me wondering if it was really a demo waiting to be worked up. Either way, it’s kind-of TWP by numbers and I have no real strong feelings about it.\n\nNext time around will see the series reach 2008….the year that the seventh studio album El Rey was released. It’s a period of time when the TWP website makes no mention of any singles being released, but there’s three such items from 2008 listed on Discogs. I’ll do my best to muddle through.\n\nJC"
