        "text": "She was nicknamed the Vamp of Savannah (not because she was any kind of temptress, but rather because that's where she was from, and maybe also because she sang the tune \"Hard-hearted Hannah\").\n\nI would say that she qualifies for inclusion in this thread. Her earliest albums, starting with the one pictured in your message, are from the 1960s, and filled with standards from the Great American Songbook. And that's not all. As illustrated by the YouTube clip that you posted, Irene sang with jazz legend Count Basie and his orchestra in 1961 and 1962. She was actually his regular solo vocalist (post-Joe Williams), thus traveling with the band domestically and abroad. A couple of Basie's LPs on Roulette include vocals by her ... Those are qualifications aplenty!\n\nPersonally, though, I think of her as more of a blues or r&b than a jazz singer. (The YouTube clip with Basie displays her ease with the blues. She does a pretty good, solid job on that one.) During her lifetime, Irene was sometimes compared to Dinah Washington, and it is not hard to hear a vocal/stylistic resemblance. However, I would say that Dinah could sing in a jazz vein as authentically as she could do a blues; to me, Irene's interpretations of jazz standards never fully sound as if they were being delivered in the \"jazz idiom.\" Generally, my feeling is that her style and sound are more reminiscent of r&b singers like Esther Phillips, Ruth Brown, Lavern Baker, etc., despite the fact that she sang standards and showtunes all too often.\n\nIrene Reid, Meditation, Single »\n\nIrene Reid - My Way »\n\nThat version of \"My Way\" (last clip) successfully recasts the Sinatra staple into a soul number.\n\nI can't say that her vocal timbre appeals to me greatly. Still, I have picked up a fair amount of her work -- about half of it. I have both the debut album on MGM and two of her three Verve albums (Room for One More, It's Too Late). The one that I don't have was released by that label last (1967). Its track listing suggests that she had begun to move away from a blues-jazz grab bag into a more contemporary soul/rhythm & blues milieu. Curiously, the front cover skips Irene's image altogether, choosing to concentrate instead on a depiction of the titular song's message:\n\nAlso curious are the covers of her next two LPs (which I don't have, either):\n\nFor a while in the late 1960s or a little later, Irene made it to Broadway, playing the wicked witch in The Whiz. But she was never really in the limelight. The little of a national profile afforded by the 1960s albums had faded by the 1970s. Fortunately, the late 1990s and early 2000s gave her a comeback through the release of about six CDs on a well-distributed label. I have three of those; here is one of them:\n\nSadly, the title of that CD did not reflect her reality in upcoming years. She did begin to do a bit bad, health-wise, in the 2000s. Here is an excerpt from a soulful account that was written (after Irene's passing) by someone called Wendy, and which was posted at the website AllAboutJazz:\n\nFirst time I went to see Irene Reid, was when her health first was failing (over 5 years ago) and she was only able to sing 3 tunes in a set. I was young in my job at the Jazz Foundation and some folks told me that Irene had not been feeling well so I went to hear her at “Smoke\" on Broadway and 106 St. and I introduced myself.\n\nI watched her perform 2 sets. You could see she was struggling with her breathing and the club owner Paul had asked her if she needs to go to the hospital but she didn't want to disappoint the crowd that had packed the place waiting in line to see what was becoming rare moments when she was feeling well enough to make the gig. At one point, she was so dizzy she nearly fainted but no one in the audience saw this going on as she had been experiencing this in a small corner that had been set aside for her to rest between tunes. Irene insisted she would not leave till she finished the second set.\n\nShe saved herself for the last tune of the set, a grand finale blues. That was when I first heard Irene Reid do what so few left on Earth can do anymore- I had to literally sit on my hands to keep from pulling out a harmonica and jumping on the stage- I had not heard blues like that in ages. For the length of that one tune, not one person in the crowd remembered that they were dealing with a divorce, or an illness or the sickness of a parent, or the heartbreak of having a teenage kid at home - no one in that room remembered they had to go to work on Monday to a job they didn't want, or their life was not what quite what they had expected- for one moment, we were all free- we were complete, we were all happy and shouting from the irreplaceable irresistible reach-your-soul abilities of Irene Reid -\n\nAfter she finished, and everyone was on their feet standing up for her, she made her way through the crowd and asked me to help her into the car service that was waiting and we went straight to the hospital. That was the first night I had met her.\n\nWe went to a hospital in the Bronx and when we got there, all they saw was an elderly person they assumed was poor, they said there were no beds and made us wait by the door, cold winds passing through us, surrounded by homeless people who were coughing and the staff had that attitude that many of us have experienced in situations like this one.\n\nSo I went up to the head nurse and said, “Do you know who this is? She's a very famous singer.\" Then I went outside for a minute and made a call to the emergency room as if I was the assistant of a very famous person who I wont name, (but who gave me permission to do this) and asked if Miss Irene Reid was in the emergency room and said that “Mr. So and so was worried about her and wanted to know if she was all right.\" We got a bed within 2 minutes and the head doctor came out and she was treated like the royalty she was.\n\nSuch dignity and beauty in contrast to the shamefull side . Wendy's account is quite staggering.\n\nAh, another interesting addition. Like Irene, Lizzy might be said to be a \"twilight case.\" On the plus side, all her LPs were recorded in the 1950s, and they are filled with jazz and pop standards. Those are her qualifications to be included in this 1930s-1960s jazz-pop thread.\n\nHowever ...\n\nTo my mind, and despite her 1950s work on vinyl, Lizzy Miles belongs to the 1910s and 1920s. This lady was already doing a whole lot of live performing all over the US back in the early 1910s, when she was still a teenager. Throughout the 1920s, she recorded a large number of 78-rpm cuts, which were more recently made available in a chronological CD series from Document Records, the Austrian label. Incidentally, she worked with famous names from that early 1900s period, like Jelly Roll Morton, King Oliver, and Fats Waller.\n\nLizzy was first and foremost a blues singer -- with a strain of vaudeville also running through her veins. Just about every tune that she tackled was sung in the typical manner of either one or the other genre. Moreover, she had the kind of potent, big and rough voice that is associated with some of the biggest names from the blues world (e.g., Besse Smith).\n\nBut Lizzy herself didn't like to be categorized as a blues singer, rightfully feeling that the description pigeonholed her, ignoring the fact that she sang many different types of songs. Here is rare live footage of the woman when she was over 60, guesting on a 1950s TV special hosted by the pair of Louis Armstrong and Rex Harrison:\n\nLa Rose Noire de Paris: that's how she was billed during parts of her long career. In the mid-1920s, she went to Paris and remained there, as a nightclub performer, for two years.\n\nAn even more prevalent name for her was The Creole Queen. That particular billing pointed to a key trait of her work: she liked to start out by singing in English, and to shift to Creole French halfway through. If you are listening to her and you are familiar with the given number that she is singing in its standard English version, the sudden outpour of French verbiage can be quite startling and interesting to hear. A good example is the clip posted by Rubberhead (\"A Good Man Is Hard to Find\"). Around the 1:00 mark, we suddenly have her moaning about how tough it is to \"trouver\" a \"bon homme.\"\n\nNowadays, this New Orleans singer is actually best remembered (if at all) for this one song. We have old-time jazz fan Woody Allen to thank for that. He included her version in his film Blue Jasmine, released three years ago.\n\nI like to search for interesting and off-beat tidbits about these singers' lives. In Lizzy Miles's case, there doesn't seem to be much of special interest out there. Although two marriages are reported, Lizzy's life (1895-1963) seems to have been primarily dedicated to \"secular\" singing until 1959, when she retired, devoting the remainder of her lifetime to help a congregation of African-American nuns (New Orleans' Sisters of the Holy Family) do their humanitarian work. The Creole Songbird was visiting a Catholic retirement community when she suffered the heart attack that led to her passing away.\n\nIt is one of her two \"your mamma\" albums. (Lizzy's mother was also a singer, back in the 19th century.)\n\nShe made at least five albums for Cook, a label founded in 1952 and specializing in folk, world and traditional music. Lizzy also has one 12\" LP on Capitol and another on Verve, both partially credited to her and partially credited to the musical accompaniment. (Then there are her aforementioned 78s from the 1920s, recorded for Victor and Columbia, among other labels ... She went around!)\n\nNPR posted an hour long program called Marilyn Maye: The Queen of Cabaret in their Jazz Night in America series late last month. It's hard to explain what it is, but Marilyn Maye definitely still has it at age 88. She's in good voice, funny, and has many stories to tell of how she got started in her career, singing on the Johnny Carson show, and her career in general. I saw another of her late 1960's RCA albums this weekend and will have to pick it up. A duet album with Tony Bennett would indeed be something.\n\nHere's the link to the show:\n\nMarilyn Maye: The Queen Of Cabaret"
