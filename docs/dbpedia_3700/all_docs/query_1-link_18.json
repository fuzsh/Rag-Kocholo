        "text": "1933 song by Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach\n\nThis article is about the song. For other uses, see Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (disambiguation).\n\n\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\"Single by Gertrude Niesen with Ray Sinatra and his OrchestraB-side\"Jealousy\"Released1933RecordedOctober 13, 1933LabelVictorComposer(s)Jerome KernLyricist(s)Otto HarbachProducer(s)Ray Sinatra\n\n\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" is a show tune written by American composer Jerome Kern and lyricist Otto Harbach for the 1933 musical comedy Roberta. The song was sung in the Broadway show by Tamara Drasin. Its first recorded performance was by Gertrude Niesen, who recorded the song with orchestral direction from Ray Sinatra, Frank Sinatra's second cousin,[1] on October 13, 1933. Niesen's recording of the song was released by Victor, with the B-side, \"Jealousy\", featuring Isham Jones and his Orchestra.[2] The line — When your heart's on fire, smoke gets in your eyes — apparently comes from a Russian proverb.[3]\n\nBy the time of Roberta in 1933, the tune had been composed for a tap dance in the 1927 musical Show Boat, but was not adopted; in 1932 it was retried as a march for a radio series theme tune.[3]\n\nThe song was also included in the 1952 remake of Roberta, Lovely to Look At, in which it was performed by Kathryn Grayson, and was a number 1 chart hit in 1959 for the Platters.\n\nRecording history\n\n[edit]\n\n1930s\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Whiteman had the first hit recording of the song on the record charts in 1934.[4]\n\nPaul Whiteman and his Orchestra performed the song with vocals by Bob Lawrence. This version of the song topped music charts in 1934.[5] The Tommy Dorsey orchestra released their version in 1938. The B-side to Dorsey's single was \"Night and Day\". During the mid-to-late 1930s, Larry Adler and Henry Hall recorded live radio performances of the song on BBC Radio. Adler's rendition was a syncopated, harmonica arrangement. Hall's was with the BBC orchestra with vocals by Dan Donovan. Hall's version was released as a 10\" single.[6] Pianist Art Tatum said in an introduction in 1955 that he performed \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" in the 1930s.\n\nThe song was reprised by Irene Dunne, who performed it in the 1935 film adaptation of the musical co-starring Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Randolph Scott.\n\n1940s\n\n[edit]\n\nAndre Kostelanetz recorded an easy listening arrangement of the song for Columbia Masterworks (4265-M) in 1941.[7]\n\nIn 1941, the Benny Goodman Orchestra played the song on the radio with Helen Forrest. Forrest left the ensemble during the early part of 1941.[8] Goodman replaced her with Peggy Lee.[9] Her recording for a Mutual broadcast was released on the album Benny and Sid Roll 'Em. Glenn Miller conducted his rendition of the song at Abbey Road Studios in 1944, but due to his death later that year, his version was unreleased until 1995.[10]\n\nOn October 30, 1946, Nat \"King\" Cole recorded the song in his trio with Oscar Moore on guitar and Johnny Miller on double bass, during a live broadcast from New York City.[11] Cole performed it on television in 1957 for The Nat King Cole Show.\n\nExternal audio You may hear Smoke Gets In Your Eyes performed by Andre Kostelanetz in 1941\n\nHere on Archive.org\n\nHarry Belafonte made a recording of the song in 1949 with jazz saxophonist Zoot Sims. This was one of Belafonte's first recordings. Sims' performance was parodied on December 10, 1977, on The Muppet Show by Zoot from Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem, the character he inspired.\n\n1950s and later\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1950, Charlie Parker and Jo Stafford each released versions of the song on their respective albums, Bird at St. Nick's and Autumn in New York. Eartha Kitt recorded the song for her 1954 album That Bad Eartha. Dinah Washington released the song in 1956 on her album Dinah!. Jeri Southern named her 1957 album When Your Heart's On Fire after a lyric from the song; the album features her version of the song. The same year as Nat King Cole's televised performance of the song, Polly Bergen performed the song during the series premiere of her variety show The Polly Bergen Show, originally airing September 21, 1957.[12] In 1958, Sarah Vaughan released her rendition on her album, No Count Sarah. Eartha Kitt recorded \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" with the Henri Rene Orchestra in 1952. These sessions also yielded her hit single \"Santa Baby\".\n\nJ. D. Souther covered the song for the soundtrack to director Steven Spielberg's 1989 film Always, and has a cameo appearance performing it at a dance with the main characters, played by Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter.\n\nThe Platters version\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\"Single by the Plattersfrom the album Remember When?

The group's version became a number one hit in the U.S. on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. In 1959 it peaked at No. 3 on the Rhythm and Blues chart.[14] The song spent 20 weeks on the UK charts, peaking at Number 1 for one week on March 20 of that same year.[15] Buck Ram, the producer, said that Harbach praised them \"for reviving his song with taste.\"[13] The widow of composer Jerome Kern disliked the recording so much she considered legal action to prevent its distribution.[16] However, she was informed that she was going to get huge royalties from the sales of the single.[3] It was expected to sell over a million copies, and she dropped her lawsuit.[17]\n\nIn 2019, the song by The Platters was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[18]\n\nChart history\n\n[edit]\n\nBlue Haze version\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnny Arthey's studio group Blue Haze released a version of \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\" as a single in 1972, and on the album Blue Haze the following year.
