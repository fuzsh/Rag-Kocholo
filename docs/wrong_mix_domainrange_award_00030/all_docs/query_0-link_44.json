        "text": "Charles Scott Sherrington was an English neurophysiologist who described the brain cortex as a set of connected neurons (\"the neuron doctrine\"). He named the connections between neurons \"synapses\" and described the strength of their connections as \"potentiated\" and \"depotentiated.\" Sherrington he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1932 (along with Edgar Adrian), for work summarized by Sherrington in his book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System (1906). This anticipate the work of Donald Hebb, that \"neurons that fire together wire together\" in what Hebb called \"cell assemblies\" and the later work of Eric Kandel whose work on the \"long-term potentiation of synapses won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Arvid Carlsson and Paul Greengard) for his research on the physiological basis of memory storage in neurons."
