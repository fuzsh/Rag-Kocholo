        "text": "Henri Bergson, French philosopher, 1859-1941\n\nHenri Bergson was a major French philosopher, influential especially in the first half of the 20th century. Bergson convinced many thinkers that the processes of immediate experience and intuition are more significant than abstract rationalism and science for understanding reality. He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his rich and vitalizing ideas and the brilliant skill with which they have been presented\". In 1930 France awarded him its highest honour, the Grand-Croix de la Legion dâ€™honneur."
