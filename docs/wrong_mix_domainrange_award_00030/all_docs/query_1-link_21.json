Furthermore, Bergson suggests that causation is not a unidirectional relationship, but rather a dynamic interaction where the effect inherently contains elements of its cause. Therefore, the quote emphasizes how the present is shaped and influenced by the unfolding of past events, and how the cause and effect are intricately intertwined in the course of time.",
