        "text": "On 27 November 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will and testament, giving the largest share of his fortune to a series of prizes, the Nobel Prizes. As described in Nobel’s will, one part was dedicated to “the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine”. Learn more about the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine from 1901 to 2023.\n\nNumber of Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine\n\n114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded since 1901. It was not awarded on nine occasions: in 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1925, 1940, 1941 and 1942.\n\nWhy were the medicine prizes not awarded in those years? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: “If none of the works under consideration is found to be of the importance indicated in the first paragraph, the prize money shall be reserved until the following year. If, even then, the prize cannot be awarded, the amount shall be added to the Foundation’s restricted funds.” During World War I and II, fewer Nobel Prizes were awarded.\n\nShared and unshared Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine\n\n40 medicine prizes have been given to one laureate only.\n\n35 medicine prizes have been shared by two laureates.\n\n39 medicine prizes have been shared between three laureates.\n\nWhy is that? In the statutes of the Nobel Foundation it says: A prize amount may be equally divided between two works, each of which is considered to merit a prize. If a work that is being rewarded has been produced by two or three persons, the prize shall be awarded to them jointly. In no case may a prize amount be divided between more than three persons.\n\nNumber of Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine\n\n227 individuals have been awarded 1901-2023.\n\nList of all Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicinene\n\nYoungest medicine laureate\n\nTo date, the youngest Nobel Prize laureate in physiology or medicine is Frederick G. Banting, who was 32 years old when he was awarded the medicine prize in 1923.\n\nOldest medicine laureate\n\nThe oldest Nobel Prize laureate in physiology or medicine to date is Peyton Rous, who was 87 years old when he was awarded the medicine prize in 1966.\n\nFemale Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine\n\nOf the 227 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women. Of these 13, Barabara McClintock is the only one who has received an unshared Nobel Prize.\n\nList of all female Nobel Prize laureates\n\nMultiple Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine\n\nNo one has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine more than once. Yet …\n\nList of multiple Nobel Prize laureates within other prize categories\n\nPosthumous Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine\n\nThere have been no posthumous Nobel Prizes in Chemistry. From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Before 1974, the Nobel Prize has only been awarded posthumously twice: to Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize 1961) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931).\n\nFollowing the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, it was discovered that one of the medicine laureates, Ralph Steinman, had passed away three days earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and an interpretation of the purpose of the rule above lead to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should to remain a Nobel Prize laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine without knowing of his death.\n\nFamily Nobel Prize laureates in physiology or medicine\n\nMarried couples\n\nGerty Theresa Cori, née Radnitz\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1947 for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\n\nCarl Ferdinand Cori\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1947 for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\n\nMay-Britt Moser\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014 for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.\n\nEdvard I. Moser\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2014 for their discoveries of cells that constitute a positioning system in the brain.\n\nFather & son\n\nHans Karl August Simon von Euler-Chelpin\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1929 for their investigations on the fermentation of sugar and fermentative enzymes.\n\nUlf von Euler\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1970 for their discoveries concerning the humoral transmitters in the nerve terminals and the mechanism for their storage, release and inactivation.\n\nSune K. Bergström\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1982 for their discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances.\n\nSvante Pääbo\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2022 for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution.\n\nBrothers\n\nJan Tinbergen\n\nThe Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969 for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes.\n\nNikolaas Tinbergen\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1973 for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns.\n\nForced to decline the Nobel Prize\n\nTwo Nobel Prize laureates in chemistry have been forced by authorities to decline the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade three German Nobel Prize laureates from receiving the Nobel Prize – two of whom were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Richard Kuhn in 1938 and Adolf Butenandt in 1939. The third person, Gerhard Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1939. All of them could receive the Nobel Prize diploma and medal later, but not the prize amount.\n\nNobel Prize laureate partnerships in biomedical science\n\nMany long scientific partnerships have resulted in Nobel Prizes:\n\nList compiled in 2012, courtesy of Joseph L. Goldstein.\n\nNominations for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nIn the nomination database, you can find interesting nomination trivia, for example, that the Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was nominated 32 times for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, but never awarded. In 1929, the Nobel Committee for Medicine engaged an expert who concluded that a further investigation in Freud was not necessary, since Freud’s work was of no proven scientific value. Freud was also nominated once for the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature by Nobel Prize laureate Romain Rolland, an acquaintance of Freud.\n\nThe nominations for the Nobel Prizes are kept secret for 50 years.\n\nExplore the nomination database for the Nobel Prizes\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal in physiology and medicine\n\nThe Nobel Prize medal in physiology and medicine was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents the Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl’s thirst.\n\nRead more about Nobel medal in Physiology and Medicine\n\nThe Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nEach Nobel Prize diploma is a unique work of art, created by foremost Swedish and Norwegian artists and calligraphers.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize diplomas\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount\n\nAlfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 1,702 million) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.” The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize amount for 2023 was set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11 million per full Nobel Prize.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize amount\n\nWhy are the individuals and organisations awarded a Nobel Prize called Nobel Prize laureates?\n\nThe word “laureate” refers to being signified by the laurel wreath. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is represented wearing a laurel wreath on his head. A laurel wreath is a circular crown made of branches and leaves of the bay laurel (in Latin: Laurus nobilis). In Ancient Greece, laurel wreaths were awarded to victors as a sign of honour – both in athletic competitions and in poetic meets.\n\nLinks to more facts on the Nobel Prizes\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine\n\nFacts on the Nobel Prize in Literature\n\nFacts on the Nobel Peace Prize\n\nFacts on the Prize in Economic Sciences\n\nFacts on all Nobel Prizes\n\nFirst published 5 October 2009."
