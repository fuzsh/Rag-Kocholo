        "text": "1901\n\nMedicine Emil von Behring (1854-1917), who was professor of Hygiene at the University of Marburg from 1895 until his death, was honored with the first Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1901 for his work in developing a cure for diphtheria. The discoverer of serum therapy invested the money from the Nobel Prize in an estate in Marburg-Marbach, which became the nucleus of the Behringwerke, founded in 1914. It still exists to this day as the “Behringwerke Marburg Industrial Park.” 1909\n\nPhysics Ferdinand Braun (1850-1918) studied to become a schoolteacher in Marburg and taught as a professor of mathematical physics at the University of Marburg from 1877 to 1880. The physicist and 1909 Nobel Prize winner developed the “Braun transmitter,” which was important for wireless telegraphy, and the cathode-ray tube, the most important component of the television set and the radar receiver. (Commemorative plaque, Hofstatt 2) 1910\n\nMedicine Albrecht Kossel (1853-1927): The physician and physiologist who received the 1910 Nobel Prize for Medicine, was director of the Physiological Institute in Marburg from 1895 to 1901. He conducted research on the cell nucleus and proteins and discovered the nucleic bases adenine, thymine, and cytosine. 1930\n\nChemistry Hans Fischer (1881-1945), the 1930 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, studied chemistry and medicine in Marburg from 1899 to 1904. Later professor at the Technical University of Munich, the Nobel Prize was awarded for his research on the chemistry of pyrrole and the synthesis of hemin. 1936\n\nMedicine Otto Loewi (1873-1961): pharmacologist, was an assistant at the University of Marburg from 1898 to 1905, where, in 1900, he also earned his Habilitation. Together with Sir Henry Hallett Dale (UK), this 1936 winner of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine discovered the transmission of nerve impulses by chemical means. 1939\n\nChemistry Adolf Butenandt (1903-1995) studied chemistry and biology at the University of Marburg from 1921 to 1925. This 1939 winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was one of the leading researchers in the field of sex hormones and the biochemical effect of hereditary factors. 1944\n\nChemistry Otto Hahn (1879-1968) studied and earned his doctorate in chemistry at the University of Marburg from 1897 to 1904. Hahn discovered nuclear fission and thus became the founder of the atomic age. (Commemorative plaque, Renthof 12) 1958\n\nLiterature Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) spent an exchange semester at the University of Marburg in 1912. The Russian writer (“Doctor Zhivago”) received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. He initially accepted the prize, but later rejected it due to political pressure from the Soviet government. 1963\n\nChemistry Karl Ziegler (1898-1973), who received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1963 (together with Giulio Natta) for his discoveries in the field of polymers, studied and worked at the University of Marburg from 1916 to 1925. 1979\n\nChemistry Georg Wittig (1897-1987): chemist, began studying in Marburg in 1920, subsequently worked as an assistant, and in 1932 became an Associate Professor at the University of Marburg. In 1979, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry."
