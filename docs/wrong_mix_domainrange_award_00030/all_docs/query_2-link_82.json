The stamps were designed by Victor Stabin of Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe stamps honor four American scientists: geneticist Barbara McClintock, mathematician John von Neumann, physicist Richard Feynman, and thermodynamicist Josiah Willard Gibbs.\n\nFor each stamp, artist Stabin created a collage featuring a portrait of the scientist and drawings that are associated with major contributions made by the scientist. Information about the specific elements in each collage is contained in the design briefs of the individual profiles on the back of each stamp. The Banknote Corporation of America, Inc., and Sennett Security Products printed 50 million stamps in the offset process with microprinting.\n\nReference:\n\nPostal Bulletin (March 3, 2005).\n\nunused\n\nPlace\n\nUnited States of America\n\nTopic\n\nContemporary (1990-present)\n\nScience\n\nWomen's Heritage\n\nU.S. Stamps\n\nSee more items in\n\nNational Postal Museum Collection\n\nCredit line\n\nCopyright United States Postal Service.
