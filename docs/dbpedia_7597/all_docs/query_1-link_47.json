        "text": "Pep Guardiola made his full Barcelona debut on 16th December 1990 in a league game against Cádiz.\n\nGuardiola played the full 90 minutes - receiving a yellow card in the 34th - in a match that the 'Blaugranas' ended up winning 2-0 thanks to goals by Txiki Begiristain and José Mari Bakero.\n\nIn addition to making his debut that day, Guardiola also left us with a soundbite before the game kicked off: \"I'm a player who plays in the middle of the pitch as a number 4 or 6. I'm more of a technical player and I try to play the easy ball, and not make life difficult for myself.\""
