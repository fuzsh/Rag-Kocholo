        "text": "Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-0 in the final of the 2022-23 Supercopa de Espana, claiming their first trophy with Xavi in charge of the club.\n\nThe first half hour saw chances for both sides, with each usually-prolific striker - Karim Benzema and Robert Lewandowski - failing to convert opportunities.\n\nGavi opened the scoring in the 33rd minute, slotting home a lovely pass from Lewandowski.\n\nThe Pole doubled Barca's lead just before half-time, punishing a Real turnover in midfield.\n\nPedri put the game out of reach with his team's third in the 69th minute, tapping in a cross from Gavi to cap a lethal counter-attack.\n\nBenzema scored a late consolation for Real in the 93rd minute, but it was far too late to change the outcome.\n\nThis is Barcelona's first Supercopa triumph since August 2018 and their 14th overall, the most all-time.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBoth sides progressed by winning their respective semi-finals on penalties. Real Madrid played out a 1-1 draw with Valencia in normal time, with Karim Benzema’s opener from the penalty spot being cancelled out by Lino’s equaliser just a minute after the half-time interval. Neither side could find a winner in extra time before Real Madrid won 4-3 on penalties. Benzema, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Marco Asensio all converted their spot kicks; Eray Comert and Jose Gaya both missed for Valencia.\n\nBarcelona’s semi-final against Real Betis also finished 1-1, with Robert Lewandowski and Nabil Fekir scoring in the 90 minutes. There were then two more goals in extra time thanks to strikes by Ansu Fati and Loren Moron before the tie had to be settled on penalties. Barcelona then won 4-2 in the shootout.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nCarlo Ancelotti is convinced his Real Madrid players are still motivated by silverware despite their glut of trophies over the last 10 years.\n\nReal have won the Champions League five times, La Liga three times, the Copa del Rey once, the Spanish Super Cup three times, the UEFA Super Cup four times and the Club World Cup four times since 2013.\n\nA number of players have been at the Santiago Bernabeu for all of those wins, including Karim Benzema, Luka Modric and Dani Carvajal.\n\nBut ahead of their Spanish Super Cup final against Barcelona on Sunday, Ancelotti is in no doubt that his players want more medals.\n\nAsked whether they were satisfied and could lack motivation, he said: “”It’s not true. We are talking about players that it’s not that they won last year, they started winning in 2013 and they are still winning.\n\n“They haven’t filled their bellies and I don’t think they’re ever going to fill their bellies because they have such a big mentality.”\n\nThe 63-year-old also said he would have Benzema available after his return to action earlier this month.\n\nHe continued: “Benzema is back. Although he is too important for us, the team did very well during his absence.”\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona today. The final of the Spanish Super Cup. El Clasico.\n\nYet the match will not be played at the Santiago Bernabeu or Camp Nou.\n\nInstead, it will be at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s hosting of the second Clasico of the season — Real won the first 3-1 — is predictably controversial, with supporters, journalists and human rights organisations criticising the choice of venue.\n\nThe match will no doubt be enthralling, with Xavi seeking his first silverware after returning to Barcelona, while Real are hunting their second of six trophies this season. But the location does beg the question: how and why?\n\nLuke Brown and Anthony Hay explain why today's game will be played in Saudi Arabia, the controversies and the latest team news. Check it out below.\n\nThe move makes plenty of sense for the RFEF. News outlets in Spain reported that Saudi Arabia has agreed to pay an annual fee in excess of €30million (£26.6m, $36.5million) per year until 2029.\n\nPrize money has also increased for the four teams involved, with the winners guaranteed payment in the region of €2million, with the runners-up receiving around half of that.\n\nThat does not make up for some of the disappointment. Last season, Athletic Bilbao’s midfielder Raul Garcia spoke out against the move, claiming that “football now is all about making money and finding sponsors”. He described the fixtures as “a complete nonsense”.\n\nThe match will be at at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nBefore the 2019-20 season, Spain’s football governing body, the RFEF, overhauled the Supercopa de Espana, which had been running since 1982 with a simple two-team format.\n\nIt decided to double the number of teams, inviting the runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga to participate as well as the winners.\n\nOh, and it decided to move the entire tournament from Spain to Saudi Arabia. This was good news for everybody’s coffers, but not as good a deal for Spanish football fans.\n\nThere is every chance Cristiano Ronaldo could be in attendance on Sunday given the fact it’s taking place in Saudi Arabia. The Portuguese forward attended Real Madrid’s training session on Friday and Ronaldo was seen laughing and joking with manager Carlo Ancelotti and former Madrid player Roberto Carlos.\n\nReal Madrid were training at Al Nassr’s training facility, which meant a brief reunion between Ronaldo and his former employers was always likely to happen. The King Fahd Stadium, which will host Sunday’s spectacle, is just a 30-minute drive away from Al Nassr’s home stadium, Mrsool Park.\n\nDon’t be surprised to see Ronaldo cheering on his former side against their arch-rivals from an executive box. Ronaldo, who won four Champions Leagues at Real Madrid, still has a good relationship with the club, having used their facilities to maintain his fitness after the World Cup and before signing his contract with Al Nassr.\n\nReal Madrid forward Karim Benzema says he is taking his future “year by year” as he enters the final six months of his contract with the Spanish giants.\n\nBenzema, 34, has been an integral part of Real’s success in recent years and last signed a contract extension in August 2021, with that deal expiring at the end of June.\n\nBenzema will captain Real in Sunday’s Supercopa de Espana final against Barcelona, and maintains he is still enjoying his time in the Spanish capital.\n\n“I’m here, enjoying every training session and every match,” Benzema said yesterday. “For me, it’s year by year.\n\n“I can’t tell you how long I’m going to stay, I can tell you that I enjoy every day in Madrid.\n\n“I’m at Real Madrid. Talking about renewal is another matter. I enjoy it, like any other player who can play for Madrid.\n\n“What happens in football we don’t know. I’m here and tomorrow we have another final.”\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nXavi believes the motivation of winning a first trophy will drive his Barcelona side to victory over Real Madrid on Sunday.\n\nBarcelona have not won a trophy since Xavi took charge of the club in November 2021. They have also brought in a number of players since he arrived, including Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde, Raphinha and Andreas Christensen.\n\nAnd Xavi believes that freshness can benefit Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final.\n\nHe said yesterday: “We have a lot of players who haven’t won’t a title. I see it as an advantage, we will have the hunger to win. It’s a terrific chance for all the young guys, and the more experienced players need to help.”\n\nThe 42-year-old was also asked what a trophy would mean and said: “(It would mean) a lot. We are really motivated by this chance.\n\n“A trophy would give us the confidence in ourselves to keep working and seeing the reason behind this process.\n\n“Whatever happens we’ll keep going the rest of the season, but when you have a trophy in your pockets, everything changes.”\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWelcome to The Athletic’s live coverage of this first Clasico of 2023.\n\nReal Madrid and Barcelona face off in the Supercopa de Espana final, which is taking place in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh.\n\nBoth semi-finals were also played in the Gulf state, which Real needing heroics from Thibaut Courtois and a penalty shootout to get past Valencia and book their spot in today’s match.
