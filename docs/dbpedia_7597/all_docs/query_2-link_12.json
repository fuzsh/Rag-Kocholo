        "text": "Barcelona and Real Madrid will play for the Spanish Super Cup this Sunday, at the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nBoth teams are not only the most popular and most followed teams in Spanish football, and they also have the most titles in this tournament.\n\nTheir domination of LaLiga Santander and the Copa del Rey means that both have had the opportunity to get their hands on the Spanish Super Cup many times.\n\nHow many Spanish Super Cup titles do Real Madrid and Barcelona have?\n\nBarcelona are the most prolific Spanish Super Cup winner with 13 titles, closely followed by Real Madrid with 12.\n\nThat record means that the team from the capital will be looking to catch up with the Blaugranas on Sunday and draw level on 13 trophies each.\n\nReal Madrid and Barcelona's total domination of the Spanish Super Cup\n\nBarcelona's 13 titles were won in 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2018.\n\nReal Madrid, defending champions of the Super Cup this year, have won in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2001, 2003, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe dominance of these two teams stands out from the rest of the Spanish teams, as the teams that come closest to them are Deportivo La Coruna and Athletic Club, with just three Super Cup titles each.\n\nThe tournament was first played in 1982, and won in that year by Real Sociedad with a 4-0 win over Real Madrid.\n\nNew format of the Spanish Super Cup\n\nSince 2020, the format for the Super Cup finalists is as follows: the top two finishers in the overall standings in LaLiga Santander face the two finalists of the Copa del Rey.\n\nThe LaLiga Santander champion plays in a semi-final against the runner-up from the Copa del Rey, while the second-placed team from the regular season plays against the Copa del Rey champion.\n\nIn this edition, Real Madrid overcame Valencia thanks to a brilliant performance by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the penalty shootout, which gave the Madridistas the win, while Barcelona overcame Real Betis in another penalty shootout.\n\nBarcelona lead Super Cup participations\n\nOf the 38 editions that have been played, on 24 occasions the LaLiga Santander champion has been the winner of the Super Cup."
