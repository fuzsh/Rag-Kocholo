        "text": "Vinícius Júnior was the star of the show as Real Madrid downed Barcelona to win the 2024 Spanish Super Cup, the third time they have won the tournament since it moved to Saudi Arabia and switched to a four-team format in 2019.\n\nVinícius hits first-half Clásico hat-trick\n\nThe Brazilian winger scored a first-half hat-trick - including two goals inside the opening 10 minutes and a penalty - as Los Blancos threatened to run riot early on. A potential big victory didn’t quite follow, although Carlo Ancelotti’s side did post a comfortable triumph, running out 4-1 winners.\n\nAlthough the Spanish Super Cup won’t be either side’s number one priority this season, LaLiga’s big two always relish the opportunity of getting one over on the other. Last year’s Super Cup win revitalised Barça, who ended up winning the league, which Madrid will expect to do this term, especially as they are already seven points clear of their Clásico rivals.\n\nReal Madrid draw level with Barça for Spanish Super Cup wins\n\nAn added bonus for Los Merengues is that they have now drawn back level with Barcelona when it comes to victories in this particular competition. The Catalans moved one clear with their victory in the 2023 edition, but Madrid’s win 12 months later means both clubs have now lifted the trophy on 13 occasions.\n\nFor the vast majority of its existence, the tournament was played as a two-legged affair between LaLiga and Copa del Rey winners from the previous campaign. However, the last five editions have taken place in Saudi Arabia with four participants - theoretically the winners and runners-up of both the domestic league and cup from the season before.\n\nReal Madrid’s Spanish Super Cup victories\n\nMadrid’s Spanish Super Cup record is as follows: 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2020, 2022, 2024."
