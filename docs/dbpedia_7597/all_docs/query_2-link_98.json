        "text": "Have a look at the Spanish Super Cup winners list and the team with the record for most trophies and more\n\nThe Supercopa de Espaa is a football competition with a long history in Spain that traditionally pits the League champion against the Copa del Rey winner. The format has changed since there has also been a four-way final, featuring the La Liga runner-up and the Cup finalist, over two legs (at home and away), as well as in a single format.\n\nSpanish Super Cup football winners list by year and winner prize money\n\nWhich team has the most Spanish Super Copa titles?\n\nThe champions of the Supercopa de Espana are numerous and diverse. FC Barcelona and Real Madrid have a significant amount of dominance. Atlético de Madrid is third in contention, but groups like Deportivo de La Corua, Athletic de Bilbao, Valencia, RCD Mallorca, Sevilla FC, Real Zaragoza, and Real Sociedad each have at least one championship to their names.\n\nThere is also €1 million up for grabs for the runners-up and €2 million for the champions in 2023 as the prize money. That means if Barcelona or Real Madrid win the tournament, they would receive €4.8 million in total.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nList of Spanish Super Copa winners\n\nClub Winners Runners-up Semi-finalists Years won Years runner-up Years semi-finalist Barcelona 13 11 2 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018 1985, 1988, 1990, 1993, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2020–21 2019–20, 2021–22 Real Madrid 12 5 1 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2019–20, 2021–22 1982, 1995, 2007, 2011, 2014 2020–21 Athletic Bilbao 3 3 – 1984, 2015, 2020–21 1983, 2009, 2021–22 – Deportivo La Coruña 3 – – 1995, 2000, 2002 – – Atlético Madrid 2 5 1 1985, 2014 1991, 1992, 1996, 2013, 2019–20 2021–22 Valencia 1 3 2 1999 2002, 2004, 2008 2019–20, 2022–23 Sevilla 1 3 – 2007 2010, 2016, 2018 – Zaragoza 1 2 – 2004 1994, 2001 – Mallorca 1 1 – 1998 2003 – Real Sociedad 1 – 1 1982 – 2020–21 Espanyol – 2 – – 2000, 2006 – Real Betis – 1 1 – 2005 2022–23\n\nTop goal scorer at the Spanish Super Copa\n\nThe player with the most goals scored in the Spanish Super Cup is Leo Messi, who has a significant advantage over Ral González Blanco. Compared to the Real Madrid striker’s seven goals, the Argentine star scored 14 goals while wearing the FC Barcelona uniform.\n\nReal Madrid vs Barcelona at Spanish Super Copa (El Clasico) leading the competition\n\nReal Madrid and FC Barcelona are the two groups that have won the vast majority of championships and finished second in the Supercopa de Espaa. There is a great deal of equality between them, just as there has been throughout the history of Spanish football, even in the Supercopa competition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBehind them are Athletic Bilbao, Atlético Madrid, and Deportivo La Corua. The Lions are a side with a strong Copa del Rey tradition in addition to their La Liga success, but with the implementation of the “Bosman Law,” they understandably lost a lot of strength because they only have players from the Basque Country or Navarre.\n\nOther prominent teams from the third stage, suchas Valencia, RCD Mallorca, Sevilla FC, Real Zaragoza, and Real Sociedad, have at least one championship in their trophy cases. Despite competing in the Spanish Super Cup, teams like Real Betis and RCD Espanyol did not take home the championship.\n\nALSO READ: PLAY FREE ONLINE GAMES"
