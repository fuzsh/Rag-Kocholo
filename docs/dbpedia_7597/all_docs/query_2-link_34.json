        "text": "Barcelona captain Sergio Busquets will lift the LaLiga trophy before his side’s matchday-35 clash with Real Sociedad on Saturday, after Xavi Hernández’s men secured the Spanish championship with a 4-2 Catalan derby win over Espanyol last weekend. Barça will also be given a guard of honour by La Real’s players when they take to the field at the Camp Nou.\n\nBarça’s title win, their first since 2018/19, is the 27th in the club’s history. Only arch rivals Real Madrid, with 35, have more LaLiga crowns.\n\nHow many points could Barcelona win in 2022/23?\n\nCurrently on 85 points, Barça will finish with a total of 97 points if they win their four remaining league games this season. Such a haul would be the third-highest by a LaLiga champion, and would be just three short of the division record of 100, set by Madrid and Barça in 2011/12 and 2012/13, respectively.\n\nBarça’s remaining LaLiga fixtures\n\nAfter facing La Real, Barcelona visit Real Valladolid on 23 May and host Real Mallorca five days later, before closing out their league campaign with an away clash against Celta Vigo on 4 June.\n\nBarcelona into double figures since 2000\n\nBarça’s title victory this term is their 10th this century; between them, the Blaugrana and Madrid have now won 19 of the 23 full Spanish league seasons since 2000. Atlético Madrid (2013/14 and 2020/21) and Valencia (2001/02 and 2003/04) are the only other clubs to have topped LaLiga in that time.\n\n*Then known as Madrid FC.\n\n**Then known as Athletic Aviación.\n\n***Then known as Atlético Aviación.\n\n****Then known as Atlético Bilbao."
