        "text": "Historia del Real Madrid. (Part 4)\n\n1991-2000\n\nHaving demonstrated his abilities at the helm of Tenerife, where his team played an attractive and efficient brand of football, Valdano returned to Real Madrid in 1994. With new signings Redondo, Laudrup, Amavisca and Cañizares, the Madrid side went on to win the league title. That same season, youth-academy player Raúl made his debut. On the 29th of October at 17 years of age, the young player from Madrid filled in for Martín Vázquez in La Romareda, where he would put in a stunning performance. A new legend was born.\n\nEarly in 1995, Valdano’s Real Madrid beat Johan Cruyff’s Barça 5-0 in the Santiago Bernabéu. It was a magical game that was televised and followed by more than 10 million viewers. But the bad results in the 95-96 season forced Lorenzo Sanz to bring in Fabio Capello, one of the most sought-after coaches in European football. The Italian had a dream squad. The signings of Seedorf, Suker, Mijatovic and Roberto Carlos, together with Raúl, Hierro and Redondo, took Madrid to a new league title.\n\nThe 20th of May 1998 was a historic day for the club. After 32 years, and under the orders of Jupp Heynckes, Real Madrid conquered Europe once more by beating Juventus in the final of the Champions League. A goal from Pedja Mijatovic in the 66th minute brought number Seven from the Amsterdam Arena to the Santiago Bernabéu trophy room. In December that year, this time at the hands of Guus Hiddink, Madrid won its second Intercontinental Cup.\n\nIn 1999, and after a lifetime connected to the club as a player, Vicente del Bosque returned as the first-team manager. The man from Salamanca managed to instil a philosophy in the team that made them the best in the continent. His first title came in 2000: the Eighth European Cup. In the same year, Florentino Pérez (enlazar ficha) took over the presidency and signed one of the best players on the planet, Luis Figo.\n\nAdios Juanito, a Real Madrid legend\n\nOn the 2nd of April 1992, a tragic traffic accident cut short the life of Juanito, a Madrid idol. The player from Malaga had been at the UEFA Cup match between Real Madrid and Torino in the Santiago Bernabéu. He was on his way back to Mérida, where he was the manager, when the sad event took place. Madrid’s siete was always well-loved in the Whites’ stadium, and he is the inspiration behind the song “Illa, illa, illa, Juanito Maravilla”, which is sung in the seventh minute of every match.\n\nFabio Capello (15/11/99): “He is a winner. He is the inheritance of Real Madrid”.\n\nJavier Clemente (01/04/00): “Raúl is the best forward in the world”.\n\nFranz Beckenbauer (09/05/00): “Raúl is one of the best of Europe. He is Real Madrid’s spirit. He is like Matthäus for us: indispensable, and with a bad haircut”.\n\nThierry Henry (25/06/00): “When he plays, in his mind there is only the goal; it’s the football essence. Every time they do something, you stand up over your seat”.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson (08/04/03): “I hope he doesn’t like travelling, Failing that we will stop him entering the country. Real buy these big players like Figo, Zidane and Ronaldo but I think the best player in the world is Raúl”.\n\nZinedine Zidane (12/02/04): “For me I would say my favourite players in Europe are Raúl and Figo.”\n\nOttmar Hitzfeld (16/02/07) – Days before the Bayern vs. Madrid Match: “I’d sign him right here and now, and I’d go wherever it takes to land a player like that, he’s a “Crack” (a “match changing” player) player and I’m a fan of everything that he does, and what’s more now is the prefect time to sign him as he’s got a wealth of experience and has reached full maturity”\n\nDavid Trézéguet (08/05/03): “We all know what Raúl represents, not only for his team, but also for football”.\n\nLuís Figo (11/06/05): “I think he is the greatest player to have ever played the game. He walks on the turf and astounds. It is utterly amazing.\n\nDavid Beckham in his last appearance at Real Madrid City’s press room (14/06/07): “I want to wish the captain good luck because he has been a tower of strength for many people and for the team, and he’s been a person that a lot of people should look up to because he is very dedicated to what he does and what he believes in. Thank you to him and the rest of the team, and good luck throughout the rest of their careers”.\n\nFernando Hierro (27/9/2007):”I once said that Raúl is like a Ferrari and now I think he is like a McLaren, Fernando Alonso’s car.”\n\nInternational Career\n\nRaúl began his Spain career at youth level and represented the nation at the FIFA U-20 World Cup 1995, scoring three goals from five matches. In total, he scored 17 goals at the various youth levels for Spain. With the senior team, Raúl went on for many years to score a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain. David Villa, however, later equaled Raúl’s record in 2010 and surpassed it on 25 March 2011 in a Euro 2012 qualifier. Of his 44 international goals, Raúl scored 32 goals in competitive games, six of which were in the finals of major tournaments and 12 others on friendly games.\n\nStyle of play\n\nA prolific goalscorer and a highly creative forward, Raúl is regarded as one of the greatest and most consistent strikers of his generation. Wearing the number 7 jersey for most of his club and international career, he was capable of playing anywhere along the front line, although he was primarily deployed as a centre-forward, or as a supporting striker. Raúl was a quick, left-footed player, who was capable of scoring both in and outside the penalty area with his accurate and powerful shot. He possessed excellent ball control and technical ability, and was effective in the air as well as with his feet.\n\nAlthough primarily renowned for prolific goal scoring, Raúl was also a highly creative and hardworking player, capable of playing off of his team mates, creating chances, and assisting goals. In addition to these characteristics, Raúl is remembered for his leadership and discipline; throughout his extensive career, he never received a red card, and he was rarely booked. For his technical skills, elegance and performances, he was nicknamed “El Ferrari,” or “The Ferrari,” by Fernando Hierro, another emblematic Madrid play.\n\nMedia\n\nRaúl has been sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas during his career, and has appeared in Adidas commercials. He has advertised Adidas Predator football boots, and in 2004 he starred in an Adidas commercial featuring a number of other stars on mopeds, including Zinedine Zidane, Michael Ballack, Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet.\n\nRaúl has featured in Pepsi commercials, including an advertisement for the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan where he lined up alongside players including David Beckham, Roberto Carlos and Gianluigi Buffon in taking on a team of Sumo players.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nEarly in his career, Raúl’s goal celebration consisted of kissing his wedding ring as an acknowledgment to his wife Mamen Sanz, whom he married in 1999 and with whom he has four sons and a daughter: Jorge, Hugo, twins Héctor and Mateo, and María.\n\nHONOURS:\n\nCLUB: Real Madrid\n\nIntercontinental Cup:

a Spanish retired footballer, and the current coach of Real Oviedo. He is mostly known for his spells with Real Madrid and Spain, appearing in more than 500 official games with the former and representing the latter on nearly 90 occasions, while appearing in four World Cups and two European Championships.\n\nEqually at ease as a central defender, sweeper or defensive midfielder, he had the ability, at his peak, to combine solid defensive play with a near-unlimited passing range and surprising goalscoring talent, which made him one of the world’s most sought-after players. With the Merengues (Real Madrid), he won five La Liga and three UEFA Champions League trophies over the course of nearly 15 years.\n\nEarly years / Real Madrid\n\nHierro was born in Vélez-Málaga, Province of Málaga. After beginning his football career at local club Vélez-Málaga he had a very brief youth spell with neighboring CD Málaga, where he was told he was not good enough for the sport, which prompted a return home. He eventually made his La Liga debuts with Real Valladolid, being bought by Real Madrid in the 1989 summer after two solid seasons.\n\nAt Real, Hierro scored seven goals in 37 games in his first season, and eventually had his position on the field advanced by coach Radomir Antić, continuing his good performances with the addition of goals – in three seasons combined he netted an astonishing 44 league goals, 21 alone in 1991–92, a career-best. During years, he often partnered club great Manolo Sanchís in the centre of the defense, being instrumental in the conquest of five leagues and three UEFA Champions League trophies and being named captain after the latter’s retirement.\n\nOn 24 March 2002, Hierro scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 home win against Real Zaragoza, although the ultimate leader would be Valencia CF. He was released at the end of the 2002–03 season alongside club manager Vicente del Bosque,under rather unceremonious circumstances; having appeared in 497 top division matches over the course of 16 seasons (105 goals), he then chose a lucrative move to the wealthy but developing Middle East football industry, joining Qatar’s Al Rayyan Sports Club.\n\nIn 2007, The Times placed Hierro at number 43 in their list of the 50 hardest footballers in history.\n\nInternational career:\n\nHierro was capped 89 times for Spain and scored 29 goals, being only surpassed by Raúl (who also took over his captain armband in June 2002, when he retired. He made his debut on 20 September 1989 – freshly signed by Madrid – in a 1–0 friendly win with Poland in A Coruña,[19] and appeared for the nation in the 1990 (although only as a squad member), 1994, 1998 and 2002 FIFA World Cups, as well as UEFA Euro 1996 (where he missed a penalty as Spain crashed out to hosts England in a shootout) and 2000.\n\nOne of Hierro’s most important goals came during the 1994 World Cup qualification, as he headed the winner against Denmark that allowed ten-men Spain to qualify for the final tournament in the United States. In the finals, he scored after an individual effort against Switzerland in the round-of-16,before his team was eliminated by Italy in the quarterfinals.\n\nAlthough he had already been in charge for a few weeks, Hierro was officially presented as sporting director of the Royal Spanish Football Federation in late September 2007.He remained four years in the position.\n\nClub performance League Cup League Cup Continental Total\n\nSeason\n\nClub\n\nLeague\n\nApps\n\nGoals\n\nApps\n\nGoals\n\nApps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Spain League Copa del Rey Supercopa de España Europe Total\n\n1987–88\n\nValladolid\n\nLa Liga 29 1 0 0 – – 29 1\n\n1988–89\n\n29 2 0 0 – – 29 2\n\n1989–90\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLa Liga 37 7 5 0 – 4 0 46 7\n\n1990–91\n\n35 7 3 0 2 0 5 1 45 8\n\n1991–92\n\n37 21 7 3 – 9 2 53 26\n\n1992–93\n\n33 13 8 0 – 6 5 47 18\n\n1993–94\n\n34 10 3 0 2 0 4 1 43 11\n\n1994–95\n\n33 7 2 0 – 5 0 40 7\n\n1995–96\n\n31 7 4 0 2 1 5 1 42 9\n\n1996–97\n\n39 6 6 2 – – 45 8\n\n1997–98\n\n28 3 2 0 1 0 10 3 41 6\n\n1998–99\n\n28 6 4 1 – 8 1 40 8\n\n1999–00\n\n20 5 2 0 – 14 2 36 7\n\n2000–01\n\n29 5 1 0 – 13 1 43 6\n\n2001–02\n\n30 5 5 0 2 0 14 0 51 5\n\n2002–03\n\n25 0 1 1 – 12 0 38 1 Qatar League Emir of Qatar Cup League Cup Asia Total\n\n2003–04\n\nAl Rayyan\n\nQatar Stars League\n\n19 3 – – – 19 3 England League FA Cup League Cup Europe Total\n\n2004–05\n\nBolton\n\nPremier League\n\n29 1 0 0 0 0 – 29 1 Total Spain 497 105 53 7 9 1 109 17 668 130 Qatar 19 3 – – – 19 3 England 29 1 0 0 0 0 – 29 1 Career total 545 109 53 7 9 1 109 17 716 134\n\nEurope matches includes UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup, UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, UEFA Super Cup, Intercontinental Cup and FIFA Club World Cup matches.\n\nINTERNATIONAL:\n\nSpain Year Apps Goals 1989 2 0 1990 1 1 1991 4 0 1992 6 3 1993 6 2 1994 13 2 1995 7 3 1996 9 2 1997 6 2 1998 7 3 1999 6 5 2000 9 2 2001 7 2 2002 6 2 Total 89 29\n\nHONOURS:\n\nCLUB: Real Madrid\n\nUEFA Champions League: 1997–98, 1999–2000, 2001–02\n\nIntercontinental Cup: 1998, 2002\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2002\n\nLa Liga: 1989–90, 1994–95, 1996–97, 2000–01, 2002–03\n\nCopa del Rey: 1992–93\n\nSupercopa de España: 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001\n\nCLUB: Al Rayyan\n\nEmir of Qatar Cup: 2003–04\n\nINDIVIDUAL:\n\nFIFA XI: 1996, 1997, 1998[29]\n\nUEFA Club Best Defender: 1997–98\n\nESM Team of the Year: 1996–97, 1997–98\n\nFIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 2002\n\nFERNANDO REDONDO\n\nFernando Carlos Redondo Neri (born 6 June 1969) is an Argentine retired footballer. A defensive midfielder with the ability to contribute both offensively and creatively, he played one full decade in La Liga, mainly for Real Madrid, then finished his career (curtailed by several injury problems) in Italy, with Milan.\n\nRedondo was a member of the Argentine national team in the 1990s, representing the nation in the 1994 World Cup, and also winning the 1992 King Fahd Cup and the 1993 Copa América.\n\nEarly years / Tenerife:\n\nBorn in Adrogué, Buenos Aires Province, Redondo played his first game in the Primera División at only 16 for Argentinos Juniors, and remained five years with the team before moving abroad to Spain.\n\nRedondo made his debut in La Liga with CD Tenerife, under the management of countryman Jorge Solari. During this period, Real Madrid twice lost the league title to arch-rivals FC Barcelona on the final day of the season, in matches against Tenerife who were managed by Jorge Valdano and, when the coach was appointed at Real Madrid in the summer of 1994, the player also made the move, for a fee of US$5 million.\n\nThe key years of Redondo’s career were spent at Real Madrid, where he won two league championships and the UEFA Champions League in 1998 and 2000. During the second victorious campaign in the latter competition, his performances won him the competition’s Most Valuable Player award, with new coach Vicente del Bosque utilising him in a midfield combination with Steve McManaman.\n\nIn the quarterfinals against Manchester United at Old Trafford, he was the author of a spectacular play in which he dribbled past Henning Berg by backheeling the ball around him, recovering it and assisting Raúl for Real Madrid’s third goal (3–2 win, 3–2 on aggregate); after the game, opposing manager Alex Ferguson said “What does this player have in his boots? A magnet?”\n\nDuring his time in Madrid, Redondo earned the nickname El Principe (“The Prince”). In April 2013, he was named by daily newspaper Marca as a member of the “Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid’s history”, and he amassed Spanish top division totals of 268 games and 12 goals over the course of one full decade.\n\nIn 2000 Redondo transferred to Serie A club A.C. Milan, in a controversial £11m move: he stated that he was not involved in transfer discussions and expressed his desire to stay at Madrid. In response, a section of Real Madrid supporters gathered outside the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium protesting the transfer.However, he suffered a serious knee injury in one of his first training sessions for his new team, and was unable to play for the next 2½ years; he suspended his £2.74m-a-year salary, and even tried to give back the house and car which the Milan board had given him.\n\nIn 2004, at the age of 34, Redondo retired from professional football following another knee injury.\n\nInternational Career:\n\nRedondo gained 29 caps for Argentina, the bulk of his appearances coming from 1992 to 1994 while Alfio Basile was the manager. His first appearance was on 18 June 1992, in a 2–0 friendly win over Australia.\n\nRedondo turned down a call-up to the national team just before the 1990 FIFA World Cup, when it was coached by Carlos Salvador Bilardo. The player excused himself on account of not wanting to interrupt his law studies, but it was also reported that he objected to Bilardo’s defensive strategy. Redondo later explained: “I was picked for Argentina’s World Cup squad in 1990 but I knew I wasn’t going to be in the starting line-up, I would just be another squad member, so I preferred to stay home.”\n\nIn the 1994 World Cup Redondo started in all of Argentina’s matches, but was unable to prevent the country from falling 2–3 to Romania in the round-of-16. Following the tournament in the United States he refused to play under Daniel Passarella who had banned long hair, earrings and homosexuals in his squad, leading to disputes with several players. The former refused the latter’s demand to cut his hair, and was left out of the national team, as even Diego Maradona and president Carlos Menem went on to take sides in the situation.\n\nPassarella excluded Redondo from his 1998 World Cup squad, stating: “Twice he was asked to play for the national team and twice he refused and gave a different reason each time. Then he announced publicly he did not want to play for the national team and I do not pick any player who does not want to play for Argentina.” The player later explained: “I was in great form. But he had particular ideas about discipline and wanted me to have my hair cut. I didn’t see what that had to do with playing football so I said no again.”\n\nIn 1999, when Argentina was managed by Marcelo Bielsa, Redondo was recalled to the national side for two exhibition matches with Brazil. Although he was chosen Man of the match in the 2–0 victory in Buenos Aires he refused any subsequent call-ups, preferring to focus on club football.\n\nSTYLE OF PLAY:\n\nAn elegant deep-lying playmaker who played in front of the defence, Redondo’s main attributes were his creative passing, vision, technique and close control with his left foot, his ability to control the tempo of his team’s play in midfield making him a key member of the Real Madrid side of the 90s. Despite not having a great deal of pace, he possessed good acceleration and was an efficient and aggressive tackler, who contributed defensively just as much as he did offensively.\n\nAlthough he is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, Redondo’s career was also largely marked by injuries, in particular during the final years of his career.\n\nClub Season League Cup Continental Other Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\n\nArgentinos Juniors\n\n1985–86\n\n1 0 0 0 0 0 — 1 0\n\n1986–87\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1987–88\n\n14 0 0 0 — — 14 0\n\n1988–89\n\n36 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 36 0\n\n1989–90\n\n14 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 14 1 Total 65 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 65 1\n\nTenerife\n\n1990–91\n\n23 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 23 1\n\n1991–92\n\n32 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 32 2\n\n1992–93\n\n20 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 20 4\n\n1993–94\n\n28 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 28 1 Total 103 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 103 8\n\nReal Madrid\n\n1994–95\n\n23 1 0 0 3 1 0 0 26 2\n\n1995–96\n\n23 2 2 0 4 0 1 0 30 2\n\n1996–97\n\n33 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 39 1\n\n1997–98\n\n33 0 2 0 11 0 0 0 46 0\n\n1998–99\n\n23 0 2 0 7 0 2 0 34 0\n\n1999–00\n\n30 0 5 0 15 0 3 0 53 0 Total 165 4 17 0 37 1 6 0 225 5\n\nMilan\n\n2000–01\n\n–\n\n2001–02\n\n–\n\n2002–03\n\n8 0 6 0 5 0 0 0 19 0\n\n2003–04\n\n8 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 14 0 Total 16 0 11 0 6 0 0 0 33 0 Career totals 349 13 28 0 43 1 6 0 426 14\n\nHONOURS:\n\nCLUB: Real Madrid\n\nUEFA Champions League: 1997–98, 1999–2000\n\nLa Liga: 1994–95, 1996–97\n\nIntercontinental Cup: 1998\n\nSupercopa de España: 1997; Runner-up 1995\n\nUEFA Super Cup: Runner-up 1998\n\nCLUB: Milan\n\nUEFA Champions League: 2002–03\n\nSerie A: 2003–04\n\nCoppa Italia: 2002–03\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2003\n\nCOUNTRY: Argentina\n\nSouth American Under-17 Football Championship: 1985\n\nFIFA Confederations Cup: 1992\n\nCopa América: 1993\n\nINDIVIDUAL:\n\nFIFA Confederations Cup: Golden Ball 1992\n\nFIFA XI: 1996\n\nTenerife Player of The Year: 1992–93, 1993–94\n\nReal Madrid Player of The Year: 1996–97, 1999–2000\n\nESM Team of the Year: 1997–98\n\nTrofeo EFE: Player of The Decade 1990–99\n\nUEFA Club Footballer of the Year: 1999–2000\n\nLuís Figo\n\nLuís Filipe Madeira Caeiro Figo, OIH (born 4 November 1972) is a retired Portuguese footballer. He played as a winger for Sporting CP, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Internazionale before retiring on 31 May 2009. He won 127 caps for the Portugal national team, second only to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nRenowned for his creativity and having the ability to get past defenders, Figo is regarded as one of the greatest wingers of his generation. He made 106 assists in La Liga, the second most in La Liga history, behind Lionel Messi. He won the 2000 Ballon d’Or, 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world’s greatest living players. Figo is one of the few football players to have played for both Spanish rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. His controversial transfer in 2000 from Barcelona to bitter rivals Real Madrid set a world record fee of £37 million (€62 million).\n\nFigo had a successful career highlighted by several trophy wins, including the Portuguese Cup, four La Liga titles, two Spanish Cups, three Spanish Super Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, one UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, two UEFA Super Cups, one Intercontinental Cup, four Serie A titles, one Italian Cup and three Italian Super Cups. On the international level, he scored 32 goals for Portugal, representing the nation at three European Championships and two World Cups, helping it finish runner-up at Euro 2004.\n\nEARLY LIFE:\n\nFigo grew up in the working-class district of Cova da Piedade, Almada. He began his career as a street footballer at U.F.C. Os Pastilhas, before joining Sporting Clube de Portugal at the age of 11.\n\nFigo started his career at Sporting CP, making his league debut on 1 April 1990 during the 1989–90 season as a substitute for Marlon Brandão in a 1–0 home win against Marítimo. His other two appearances were against Boavista 24 days later and Belenenses on 13 May, the former which Sporting were held in a 2–2 draw, and the latter a 1–0 defeat. On 7 December 1991, Figo scored his first goal against Torreense in the 1991–92 season, cancelling out Rosário’s opener as Sporting won 2–1. He won his first senior international cap in 1991. Prior to that, he won the Under-20 World Championships and Under-16 European Championships with Portugal junior sides alongside Rui Costa and João Pinto. He was also a significant part of Portugal’s “Golden Generation.” In his final season at Sporting he won the 1994–95 Portuguese Cup.\n\nBARCELONA:\n\nIn 1995, Figo looked poised to join one of the big clubs of Europe, but a dispute between Italian clubs Juventus and Parma, with Figo having signed contracts with both clubs, resulted in an Italian two-year transfer ban on him. Eventually, Figo made a move to Spanish giants Barcelona for a £2.25 million fee, being loaned back for the remainder of the season due to a rule prohibiting Portuguese players from signing for foreign clubs outside a fixed period. This rule had prevented Figo from joining English club Manchester City, where he had been recommended by his former Sporting manager Malcolm Allison for a fee of around £1.2 million.\n\nIt was with Barcelona that Figo’s career really took off, winning the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup, starring alongside Ronaldo, followed by successive Primera División titles where he was part of a formidable attack which included Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert. In total, Figo appeared 172 times in the league for Barcelona, scoring 30 goals. He was revered in Catalonia because his presence in a Barcelona shirt had given the region a sense of external approval. According to a club official, Figo’s support for Catalonia meant more to Barcelona than the service of a home grown hero in Pep Guardiola.\n\nREAL MADRID:\n\nIn July 2000, Figo made a surprising and controversial $60.1 million move to Barcelona’s bitter rivals Real Madrid. There had been a buy out clause in his contract at Barcelona, a new world record fee, which Real Madrid met, and his arrival at Madrid signalled the beginning of Florentino Pérez’s “Galáctico era” of global stars signed by the club every year. Figo became the new focus of the Barcelona–Real Madrid rivalry, with Barcelona fans feeling betrayed by his transfer and turned against him. His move to Madrid was significant due to his status as a star player at Barcelona, reliable and committed to the cause as a team leader.\n\nOne of his Barcelona teammates stated, “Our plan was simple: give the ball to Luís. He never, ever hid.” Although now wearing the white shirt of Real Madrid, he won the Ballon d’Or award in November 2000, largely for what he did for Barcelona where he became the best in the world.\n\nWhen Figo returned to Barcelona for the first time in a Real Madrid shirt on 21 October 2000, the noise at Camp Nou was deafening. There were banners hung around the stadium with words like “Traitor”, “Judas”, “Scum”, and “Mercenary”. Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout, and when he came out of the tunnel and ran on to the field the jeers of almost 98,000 Barcelona fans escalated, with a visibly shocked Figo putting his fingers to his ears. When El Clásico started, each time Figo got the ball the noise rose with insults and missiles flying such as oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters and mobile phones. The regular corner taker for Madrid, Figo did not take any corners at the Camp Nou to avoid being in close proximity to the fans. Barcelona were victorious, winning 2–0, and Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez stated after the match, “The atmosphere got to us all.”\n\nMadrid defender Iván Campo commented, “That night when Figo first went back was incredible. I’ve never heard anything like it. Luís didn’t deserve that. He’d given his all for Barcelona. It was built up before: ‘a traitor’s coming,’ the media said. No, Luís Figo is coming, one of the greats for you. That night hurt him, you could see. His head was bowed and he was thinking: ‘bloody hell, I was here last season …’ But my lasting emotion was admiration: you’ve got balls.”\n\nIn his first season with Madrid, Figo won the 2001 La Liga title, scoring 14 goals in all competitions. He received the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year. He would be joined at the club by Zinedine Zidane in the summer of 2001, and in the following season Madrid won the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League, Figo’s second major European trophy.\n\nFigo’s second game back at the Camp Nou, on 23 November 2002, produced one of the defining images of the Barcelona–Real Madrid rivalry. There was no sign of the hatred or the hurt subsiding, and every time he came within range of the Barcelona fans, beer cans, lighters, bottles and golf balls flew. Figo commented, “I was worried that some madman might lose his head.” This time, Figo had decided that he would take corners, as well as throw-ins, and midway through the second half Madrid won a corner. Amid a shower of flying objects, it took Figo two minutes to take it. Another corner followed on the other side, and as Figo walked across, he slowed to pick up the missiles and as he prepared to take the corner he moved away some of the debris, while giving an ironic thumbs-up and smiling. Every time he began his run-up to take the corner, another missile would land which was repeated over and over, until the referee Luis Medina Cantalejo suspended the game for almost 20 minutes. During the break in play, the defining image of the rivalry, a pig’s head, was picked up on camera, which was in among the debris near the corner flag.\n\nBy the second or third corner I turned to Luís Figo and said: ‘Forget it, mate. You’re on your own’. I used to offer Luís the chance to take the short corner, drawing up close to him near the touchline, but not this time. Missiles were raining down from the stands: coins, a knife, a glass whisky bottle. Johnnie Walker, I think. Or J&B. Best to keep away. Short corners? No thanks.\n\n“ —Real Madrid teammate Michel Salgado on the vitriol aimed at Figo from Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou, 23 November 2002.“\n\nFigo would spend five seasons at Madrid, with his final success being the 2003 La Liga title. In April 2013, Figo was named by the sports newspaper Marca as a member of the “Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid’s history.” The partnership of RAUL and FIGO is legendary. They were meant for each other in a football club. With a deadly assist from Luis Figo and goal scoring ability of Raul, Real Madrid were a POWER HOUSE. They were invicible. One minute you will see Figo dribbling past 3 to 4 players and setting up a nice pass to Raul and the next minute you will see him striking towards the goal with precision and style. Figo was the world’s best winger. Even to this day, no one matches his level of dribbling skills and the ability to delay the time with the ball especially during the final minutes of a football match. The man had a vision and a self driven motivation to be the best.\n\nFigo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in the summer of 2005 on a free transfer after his contract with Madrid had expired. On 16 May 2009, Figo announced his retirement from football, the same day Inter won the 2008–09 title, and re-confirmed this on 30 May; his final game was on 31 May against Atalanta at the San Siro. At Javier Zanetti’s insistence, Figo captained the side for his very last match. He received a standing ovation from the crowd as he was substituted by Davide Santon. The free-kick he scored in extra time against Roma during the Supercoppa Italiana was his most memorable moment in Italy. Figo is fluent in five languages: Portuguese, Spanish, English, Italian and French.\n\nSTYLE OF PLAY:\n\nFigo is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation, and one of the greatest Portuguese players of all time. At his physical peak, Figo was a quick, elegant, highly skilful player with a dribbling ability that allowed him to frequently take on and beat defenders in one on one situations. He would often employ feints to beat opponents, such as stepovers. Figo was usually deployed as a winger in his early career, where he was capable of providing several assists, due to his ability to provide curling crosses to teammates. He made the second most assists in La Liga history behind Lionel Messi.\n\nAs he lost pace and mobility with age as his career advanced, he was deployed in a playmaking role as an attacking midfielder, in particular during his time with Inter, where he excelled with his vision and varied passing ability. Although he primarily served as a creative player, he was also capable of contributing offensively with goals due to his powerful striking ability from distance, as well as his accuracy from free-kicks and penalties. In addition to his football ability, Figo was also highly regarded for his leadership throughout his career.\n\nCareer Statistics:\n\nCLUB:\n\nClub League Season League Cup Europe Total Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\n\nSporting CP\n\nPrimeira Liga\n\n1989–90\n\n3 0 — — 3 0\n\n1990–91\n\n3 0 — — 3 0\n\n1991–92\n\n34 1 7 0 2 0 43 1\n\n1992–93\n\n32 0 8 1 2 0 42 1\n\n1993–94\n\n31 8 1 0 3 0 35 8\n\n1994–95\n\n34 7 7 3 2 0 43 10 Total 137 16 23 4 9 0 169 20\n\nBarcelona\n\nLa Liga\n\n1995–96\n\n35 5 8 1 10 3 53 9\n\n1996–97\n\n36 4 9 2 8 1 53 7\n\n1997–98\n\n35 5 4 0 7 1 46 6\n\n1998–99\n\n34 7 10 1 6 1 50 9\n\n1999–2000\n\n32 9 2 0 13 5 47 14 Total 172 30 33 4 44 11 249 45\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLa Liga\n\n2000–01\n\n34 9 1 0 14 5 49 14\n\n2001–02\n\n28 7 6 1 10 3 44 11\n\n2002–03\n\n33 10 1 0 15 2 48 12\n\n2003–04\n\n36 9 8 3 11 1 55 13\n\n2004–05\n\n33 3 0 0 10 4 43 7 Total 164 38 16 4 60 15 239 57\n\nInter Milan\n\nSerie A\n\n2005–06\n\n34 5 2 0 8 1 45 6\n\n2006–07\n\n32 2 7 1 7 0 47 3\n\n2007–08\n\n17 1 2 0 3 0 21 1\n\n2008–09\n\n22 1 — 3 0 25 1 Total 105 9 11 1 21 1 138 11 Total Portugal 137 16 23 4 9 0 169 20 Spain 336 68 49 8 104 26 488 102 Italy 105 9 11 1 21 1 138 11 Career total 577 93 83 13 134 27 795 133\n\nINTERNATIONAL:\n\nPortugal national team Year Apps Goals 1991 3 0 1992 7 1 1993 5 0 1994 5 2 1995 6 1 1996 9 2 1997 7 2 1998 6 0 1999 9 4 2000 13 6 2001 9 9 2002 10 0 2003 10 3 2004 11 1 2005 7 0 2006 10 1 Total 127 32\n\nHONOURS:\n\nCLUB: Sporting CP\n\nTaça de Portugal: 1994–95\n\nCLUB: Barcelona\n\nLa Liga: 1997–98, 1998–99\n\nCopa del Rey: 1997, 1998\n\nSupercopa de España: 1996\n\nUEFA Cup Winners’ Cup: 1997\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 1997\n\nCLUB: Real Madrid\n\nLa Liga: 2000–01, 2002–03\n\nSupercopa de España: 2001, 2003\n\nUEFA Champions League: 2002\n\nUEFA Super Cup: 2002\n\nIntercontinental Cup: 2002\n\nCLUB: Internazionale\n\nSerie A: 2005–06, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09\n\nCoppa Italia: 2006\n\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2005, 2006, 2008\n\nINTERNATIONAL: Portugal\n\nUEFA European Football Championship Runner up: 2004\n\nFIFA U-20 World Cup: 1991\n\nUEFA European Under-17 Football Championship: 1989\n\nUEFA European Under-21 Football Championship Runner up: 1994\n\nINDIVIDUAL:\n\nFigo’s Ballon d’Or\n\nUEFA Under-21 Championship Golden Player: 1994\n\nPortuguese Golden Ball: 1994\n\nPortuguese Footballer of the Year: 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000\n\nESM Team of the Year: 1997–98, 1999-00\n\nLa Liga Foreign Player of the Year: 1999, 2000, 2001\n\nSporting CP Player of the Year: 1994\n\nInter Milan Player of the Year: 2006\n\nUEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament: 2000, 2004\n\nWorld Soccer (magazine) Player of the Year: 2000\n\nBallon d’Or: 2000\n\nFIFA World Player of the Year: 2001\n\nFIFA World Player of the Year – Silver Award: 2000\n\nUEFA Team of the Year: 2003\n\nFIFA World Cup All-Star Team: 2006\n\nFIFA 100\n\nGolden Foot: 2011, as football legend\n\nORDERS:\n\nPRT Order of Prince Henry – Officer of the Order of Prince Henry\n\nMedal of Merit, Order of the Immaculate Conception of Vila Viçosa (House of Braganza)\n\nWritten by Arwin John.\n\nClick To Read Part 5"
