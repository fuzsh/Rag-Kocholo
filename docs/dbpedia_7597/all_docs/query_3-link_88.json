        "text": "ALABAMA - Just as they have accustomed us, Real Madrid did what they do best and decided a dramatic game against Atlético Madrid by scoring at the correct moment. After 90 minutes, both teams remained even until a Stefan Savic own goal in the 116th minute gave Real Madrid the lead over their city rivals.\n\nSince the Supercopa de España changed its format in 2019, this was the 7th game to be decided in extra time or penalties. Real Madrid has been involved in four of those seven games, winning all of them (two over Atlético Madrid, including today's result).\n\nAfter a hard-fought game, it wasn't enough for an Atleti team that scored 3 goals against Real Madrid in consecutive games for the first time in the 21st Century (last time they did so was in 1999).\n\nAntoine Griezmann put the 'Colchoneros' back on level terms at the end of the first half. The Frenchman reached his 174th goal with the club, becoming the all-time scorer in Atlético Madrid history surpassing Atleti and Spain legend Luis Aragonés.\n\nThis was the 4th time with a Derbi Madrileño in this competition. The 'Colchoneros' won the title at the Santiago Bernabéu during the 2014-15 season, while Real Madrid did the same in 2019-20. With today's result, both teams now have a win each plus two draws.\n\nReal Madrid extended its unbeaten streak to 20 games. Carlo Ancelotti's side has been one of the best teams in Europe so far this season, only dropping one game (23-1-3 W-L-D all competitions this season). The only loss they suffered in 2023-24 came against Atlético Madrid in September.\n\nIt will be a very disappointing result for Diego Simeone's men, as they failed to beat Real Madrid in consecutive games for the first time since 2014-15. Since the start of last season, the 'Colchoneros' have only won one game against Real Madrid and it was their clash at the Estadio Metropolitano in September (1-3-1 W-L-D since the start of 2022-23).\n\nQuick Hitters\n\nReal Madrid: 12 Supercopa de España titles; only Barcelona (14) has won more. Winners of two of the three editions played in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAtlético Madrid: eliminated in the semifinals in their last two Supercopa de España appearances; have not reached the final since 2020.\n\nJude Bellingham (MAD): 17 goals in 23 games for Real Madid this season; he's scored 6 goals more than any other player (Vinícius Jr. – 11).\n\nAntoine Griezmann (ATM): 174 goals in all comps for Atlético Madrid; surpassed Luis Aragonés for the most goals in club history.\n\nReal Madrid: one of two teams to participate in all editions since the change of format in 2019-20 (Barcelona).\n\nDiego Simeone: 41 games managed vs Real Madrid as Atlético Madrid coach (most vs any rival); has a record of 11-16-14 W-L-D in all comps.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti (MAD): 9-5-8 W-L-D vs Diego Simeone; only lost more games against Luciano Spalletti (11) in his managerial career."
