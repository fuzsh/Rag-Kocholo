        "text": "The 31st Supercopa de España promises to be one of the most exciting in recent memory. Real Madrid CF, as champions of the 2013/14 Copa del Rey, and Club Atlético de Madrid, as champions of the 2013/14 Liga BBVA, will battle it out for the title in a first leg on Tuesday 19 August at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, followed by a second leg on Friday 22 at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Entertainment is guaranteed.\n\nA new challenge\n\nAfter conquering the UEFA Super Cup just a few days ago with a 2-0 victory over Sevilla FC, Real Madrid go into the event aiming to claim their second title of the season. Carlo Ancelotti’s men are bidding for six titles this campaign after conquering the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey last season, so they will attempt to keep intact their dream of making history by winning all the trophies they are in contention for.\n\nWhites and Rojiblancos face each other in a final again after Champions League in Lisbon\n\nSince the arrival of Diego Simeone to the Vicente Calderón dugout, the Argentine manager has managed to add the Liga BBVA, Copa del Rey, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Super Cup trophies to Atlético’s cabinet. Now Simeone faces the challenge of winning a title that has eluded the club for 29 years.\n\nA Supercopa of 'debutants'\n\nThough it is unlikely that all of them will have game time, up to eleven players will experience their first Supercopa de España and their first Madrid derby. For Atlético, Miguel Ángel Moyà, Antoine Griezmann, Mario Mandžukić, Jan Oblak, Guilherme Siqueira, Cristian Ansaldi, Raúl Jiménez and Jesús Gámez could make their debuts as new reinforcements for the 2014/15 campaign; for Madrid, three new signings come into the mix: Keylor Navas, James Rodríguez and Toni Kroos.\n\nMandžukić and Kroos, now opponents, won the equivalent title with Bayern"
