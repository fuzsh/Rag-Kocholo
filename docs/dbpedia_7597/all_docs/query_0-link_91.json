FC Barcelona come into the match against Real Madrid with a 3-2 advantage from the away leg of the Spanish Super Cup. Any result from the last Real Madrid v. Barça matches at the Bernabéu (five victories and two draws) would be enough for FC Barcelona to claim the title. Tito Vilanova may have to rule out Carles Puyol, who sustained a cheekbone fracture in this weekend’s game against Osasuna, even though the captain travelled with the team to Madrid.",

        "text": "Barcelona (FCB).- Three months after winning the Copa del Rey against Athletic Club, Barça return to Madrid in search of another title. The 2012 Spanish Super Cup is up for grabs and Tito Vilanova’s men come into the match with a 3-2 advantage from last week’s away leg at the Camp Nou. Tonight’s Clásico against Real Madrid will take place at the Santiago Bernabéu, a stadium that’s been kind to the Catalans - in terms of results- over recent years, and Tito Vilanova could claim his first title as FC Barcelona’s Head Manager."
