It was double disappointment for the Cheshire side as they were defeated 4-1 by Hibernian in the U14 decider.\n\nIn 1991, Martin Buchan brought his old team good fortune as he opened the tournament. The Red Devils were 2-0 winners against Hearts in front of a 10,000 crowd at the Showgrounds, which now had a state of the art new grandstand in place.\n\nThe names of Messers Beckham, Butt, Neville, Scholes and Gillespie were the names on the lips of everyone on the North Coast as Nobby Stiles’ U16s side triumphed. It was Bangor native Gillespie that played a starring role for United as he claimed the Player of the Tournament award.\n\nIn the U14 decider, Norwich City defeated tournament regulars Dundee United.\n\nIn 1992, Denis Law guested at the 10th anniversary dinner in Portrush and Glasgow giants Rangers claimed their second U16 title with victory over Nottingham Forest.

Sir Alex Ferguson unfurled the flag at the 1994 tournament, but it wasn’t to be for his U14 charges as Middlesbrough took the title in front of a capacity crowd.\n\nEverton boss Joe Royle was the guest of honour as the tournament welcomed a new Elite U20s section introduced. Wales took top spot in the inaugural Elite section, while Everton won their first U14 crown and Russia took top spot in the U16 competition, defeating Dutch giants Feyenoord on penalties.\n\nThere was double delight for London in 1996, with Spurs edging out Blackburn Rovers and West Hami United defeated Motherwell in the U16 and U14 section respectively.

Norwich City became one of the most successful club sides in the competition with their Junior success over Hearts (their third title).\n\nA James Milner inspired Leeds United hammered Greek side Panathinaikos in the 2002 Premier decider, while Everton took the Junior crown over Brazilian side Botafogo. Paraguay were the next South American side to etch their name on the Elite trophy, with a 1-0 win over Denmark in the final.\n\n2003 saw former Brazilian international Branco open the tournament, but he couldn’t inspire the Brazil U19s to victory in the Elite final as they lost 3-2 to Paraguay.

NI were narrowly edged out in the Elite final by Denmark, while the Aspire Academy from Qatar thumped Manchester United in the Premier decider. Aspire accumulated 24 goals in just five games and will go down in history as one of the greatest teams to ever grace the competition.\n\nCruz Azul were left to settle for the runners-up spot for the second year running as Everton won on spot-kicks.\n\n2012 saw the tournament celebrate its 30th anniversary and each of the home counties welcomed top class opposition to their local areas.

There was joy and despair for the County teams in the Premier and Junior sections as Tyrone and Antrim made it all the way to the finals.\n\nEverton led by skipper Tom Davies made up for the disappointment of 2012, as they defeated Antrim on penalties while a last gasp Oliver McBurnie goal saw Andreas Pereira lift the Premier crown against a plucky Tyrone side.\n\nThe 2014 Milk Cup saw former Leeds youngster and Westlife singer Nicky Byrne open the tournament and Northern Ireland secured their first Elite title since 2009 with a comprehensive win over Canada.\n\nManchester United made it two wins on the bounce in the Premier section, who had a certain lively striker called Marcus Rashford leading the line.\n\nCorinthians from Brazil made their debut at the competition in the Premier section in 2013, but the São Paulo youngsters made it double despair for Antrim in the Junior section as the local lads lost their second successive Junior final.\n\nMalaga and Real Sociedad added some Spanish flair to the 2015 tournament, which also saw the introduction of a women’s youth section with NI taking on the Republic of Ireland in two challenge games.\n\nThe boys from County Antrim had learnt their lessons from 2013 and 2014 as they created a major piece of history by becoming the first ever county to win the competition.

In the Premier decider County Down fought valiantly against a Serie B Italian select squad. The 2018 tournament also saw the introduction of an U13 age category, named the Minor section.

In the Premier decider there was a clash of European heavyweights with Valencia seeing off Newcastle United to claim top honours on their first visit. In the Minor decider NIFL side Glentoran saw off Dungannon Swifts to secure their first ever win at the tournament.\n\nPlans were afoot to continue to expand and attract top quality entrants from across the globe in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic put a swift end to any plans and the 2021 competition was also significantly impacted, but the organising committee worked diligently to attract a Manchester United U16 team to play three challenge matches against Coleraine FC, Ballymena United and Linfield FC.\n\n2022 saw the tournament become fully operational once again and it also heralded the introduction of a highly competitive Girls’ U16 and U13, which was one by Surf Select from the United States and Linfield.\n\nIn the male section, the organisers facilitated four competitive sections at U13 (Minor), U14 (Youth), Junior (U16) and Premier (U18).\n\nIn the Minor decider Glentoran pushed talented American side Surf Select all the way but it was the American outfit that secured victory by 3-1.\n\nIn the Youth showpiece, Charlton Athletic proved too strong for a talented Glenavon FC at the Coleraine Showgrounds.\n\nIn Ballymena, Manchester United claimed their first ever Junior crown as they saw off Rangers in front of a large crowd and in the Premier decider, Ipswich Town who were a late replacement in the Premier section won a six goal thriller by 4-2 to claim their first ever victory at the tournament, a success that will have no doubt pleased first team manager and tournament graduate Kieran McKenna from Fermanagh."
