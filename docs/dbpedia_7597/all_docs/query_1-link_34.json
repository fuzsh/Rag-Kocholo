Note: both clubs have won the Copa Eva Duarte and the Copa de la Liga, but weâ€™ve not included them as the competitions had a limited lifespan.\n\nAs the stats show, Madrid just come out on top and have lifted two more trophies than their rivals. They also hold the record for the most La Liga titles, the most Champions Leagues and the most FIFA Club World Cups.\n\nBarcelona still have a trophy haul that most clubs can only dream of and they hold the record for the most Copa del Reys, Supercopas de Espana, UEFA Cup Winnersâ€™ Cups and Inter-Cities Fairs Cups.\n\nBarcelona\n\nSpain\n\nâ€“ League titles: 26 (1929, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1959, 1960, 1974, 1985, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019)\n\nâ€“ Copa del Rey: 31 (1910, 1912, 1913, 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928, 1942, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1957, 1959, 1963, 1968, 1971, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1988, 1990, 1997, 1998, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2021)\n\nâ€“ Supercopa de Espana: 13 (1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2018)\n\nEurope\n\nâ€“ European Cup: 5 (1992, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2015)\n\nâ€“ UEFA Super Cup: 5 (1992, 1997, 2009, 2011, 2015)\n\nâ€“ UEFA Cup Winnersâ€™ Cup: 4 (1979, 1982, 1989, 1997)\n\nâ€“ Inter-Cities Fairs Cup: 3 (1958, 1960, 1966)\n\nWorld\n\nâ€“ FIFA Club World Cup: 3 (2009, 2011, 2015)\n\nTotal: 90 major trophies\n\nReal Madrid\n\nSpain\n\nâ€“ League titles: 35 (1932, 1933, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1972, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 19995, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2020, 2022)\n\nâ€“ Copa del Rey: 19 (1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1917, 1934, 1936, 1946, 1947, 1962, 1970, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1989, 1993, 2011, 2014)\n\nâ€“ Supercopa de Espana: 12 (1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2020, 2022)\n\nEurope\n\nâ€“ European Cup: 13 (1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018)\n\nâ€“ UEFA Cup: 2 (1985, 1986)\n\nâ€“ UEFA Super Cup: 4 (2002, 2014, 2016, 2017)\n\nREAD: How Carlo Ancelotti ended Real Madridâ€™s 12-year wait for La Decima\n\nWorld\n\nâ€“ Intercontinental Cup: 3 (1960, 1998, 2002)\n\nâ€“ FIFA Club World Cup: 4 (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018)\n\nTotal: 92 major trophies\n\nMore from Planet Football\n\nA tribute to Messiâ€™s 2017 El Clasico winner â€“ the goal of a true hard man\n\nâ€˜Weâ€™re the best, f*ck youâ€™: The story of Barca & Realâ€™s four Clasicos in 18 days"
