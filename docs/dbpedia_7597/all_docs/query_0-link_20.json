        "text": "Barcelona and Real Madrid will square off in this season's Supercopa de Espana, but it is not the first time these two giants of the Spanish game will meet in the season's curtain-raiser.\n\nThe two rivals have been doing battle in this competition since 1988 and there have been a number of memorable incidents during that time, with 10 of the most significant remembered below.\n\n1. The first Supercopa Clasico goal (1988)\n\nAlthough the competition was created in 1982, Barcelona and Real Madrid didn't meet until six years later, meaning that the first Supercopa Clasico goal was the one scored by current Malaga boss Michel in a 2-0 first-leg win for Los Blancos.\n\n2. Stoichkov's stamp (1990)\n\nHristo Stoichkov was handed a six-month suspension in 1990 after he stamped on the official Urizar Azpitarte in a moment of madness.\n\n3. Aragon's historic goal (1990)\n\nSanti Aragon scored a famous goal in that same 1990 Supercopa clash, netting from 42 metres out with a strike that was clocked at 72km/h.\n\n4. A controversial chant (1993)\n\nFollowing their win over Barcelona in the 1993 edition, Real Madrid returned to the capital and president Ramon Mendoza was greeted with shouts of \"whoever doesn't jump is a Catalan\".\n\n5. Stoichkov's forgotten goal (1993)\n\nThe Bulgarian striker didn't have a great experience of this competition, as his work of art in 1993 was deemed irrelevant by Real Madrid's eventual victory.\n\n6. The lighter thrown at Roberto Carlos (1997)\n\nRoberto Carlos was hit on the head in a 1997 meeting by a lighter which was thrown from the stands of the Camp Nou.\n\n7. Karanka's absurd handball (1997)\n\nReal Madrid's Aitor Karanka gave away a significant penalty during this match and was aware of how silly it has been after the game, saying that a fair punishment would have been for his hand to be cut off.\n\n8. Raul's Supercopa hat-trick (1997)\n\nOn their way to winning the 1997 Supercopa by an aggregate 5-3 scoreline, Raul scored three of Los Blancos' five goals across the two legs.\n\n9. Mourinho pokes Vilanova in the eye (2011)\n\nDuring a scuffle in the 2011 edition, Jose Mourinho poked Barcelona's assistant Tito Vilanova in the eye.\n\n10. Messi's recital (2011)\n\nAn 88th minute strike from Lionel Messi earned Supercopa glory for Barcelona during that 2011 game at the Camp Nou."
