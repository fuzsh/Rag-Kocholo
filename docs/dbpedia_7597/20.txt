In some days will play the Supercopa of Spain in Saudi Arabia, with the semifinal Real Madrid-Valencia of 8 January and the FC Barcelona-Athletic a day later, on 9 January. From here they will go out the teams that contest the final of the Sunday 12 January, with the first title of the season 2019-20 at stake. It will be an opportunity of gold so that the Barça follow expanding differences with his perseguidores in the list of winners of the tournament.

In total, the culés accumulate 13 trophies of Supercopa of Spain and are those that more times have won it, gone on down a Real Madrid that has done with the title in 10 occasions. The last time that the blaugrana won the Supercopa was the past season against the Seville (2-1) in Tangier. Besides, they did it also in 1983, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2016, whereas the Real Madrid has conquered his trophies of Supercopa in 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012 and 2017.

The Athletic of Madrid did it in 1985 and 2014, whereas the Valency so only has a title of Supercopa of Spain (1999). It treats of a relatively young competition, that plays from 1982 and whose list of winners has controversial points, because of the continuous changes of criterion according to the period, in addition to it it dejadez of the own sportive institutions that created it during his starts.

The Saragossa and the Real Sociedad, without going more far, still are expecting that somebody explain them why did not contest the editions of 1986 and 1987 in front of the Real Madrid, that argued then that it did not have available dates for the dispute of the tournament. The true is that, in that period, to the Real Madrid went out him more to account to economic level participate in the Trophy City of the Line, Teresa Herrera, the Ciutat of Barcelona, the Rayma of Palm and Santiago Bernabéu in time that the Supercopa of Spain, very little valued in his beginnings and without the reward of the income of TV.

Surprisingly, the title did not award to the two clubs that yes wanted to play it, but it declared empty. On the other hand, at the beginning it declared victorious of the Supercopa of Spain, automatically, to the club that won the doublet Ties and Glass of the previous campaign. Of this benefited Athletic (1984) and Real Madrid (1989), although later it determined the model of double party (in these cases the runner-up of Glass happened to play the Supercopa against the champion of the doublet) and the list of winners never corrected , by what Madrid and Athletic have this title.

To all this the FC Barcelona, champion of League, and Valencia, champion of Glass of Rey, had to have played the edition of this year to double party. But with the new format the Athletic of Madrid, second qualifier in the League 2018-19, and until the Real Madrid, third, opt to the title. For a lot of followers of unfair way, since the white team is again the big benefited when contesting the title without having done merits for this.

Like this it is the list of winners of the Supercopa of Spain:
