We take a look at all the winners of the Spanish super Copa throughout the years.

The Spanish Super Copa is an annual football competition, consisting of the most successful clubs in Spain, from the preceding season. The competition was first played in 1982 and has ever since been an integral part of Spanish Football.

Until 2018-19, only the winners of La Liga and Copa Del Rey contested for the title, but in 2019, a decision was made by the Spanish Football Federation, to expand the competition, to add an element of intrigue and excitement to the competition.

The competition now consists of 4 teams, which include the winners and runners-up of Copa Del Rey and La Liga.

With Real Madrid taking on Barcelona this weekend in the Super Copa final, it is rather the perfect time, to take a look at all previous winners of the competition.
