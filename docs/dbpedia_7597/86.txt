Supercopa de Espana or Spanish Super Cup is a super cup tournament in Spanish football.

Since the inception of the Supercopa de Espana in 1982, the club competition has been held annually, organised by the Royal Spanish Football Federation.

The Spanish Super Cup was founded as a two-team competition played between the winners of the La Liga and Copa del Rey.

Real Sociedad won the first edition of the Supercopa de Espana after beating Real Madrid 4-1 in a two-legged final.

Except for the 1983, 1988 and 1992 tournaments, the first leg match was played at the cup winner's stadium.

In 2018, the Supercopa was played for the first time as a single match hosted at a neutral venue.

From the 2019-20 season, the Supercopa was expanded to four teams which included the winners and runners-up of the Copa del Rey and La Liga.

Real Madrid are the defending champions of the Spanish Super Cup after defeating arch-rivals Barcelona 4-1 in the 2023-24 final.

Meanwhile, Barcelona are the most successful team in the competition with 14 titles, closely followed by Madrid who have clinched the trophy on 13 occasions. Get Spanish Super Cup winners list.
