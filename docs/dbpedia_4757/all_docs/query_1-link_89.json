        "text": "Will and Sandy are two architects working on a major urban renewal project in the King's Cross section of London. The area is unsafe and not ready for such a project and is best known as a place to pick up prostitutes or buy drugs. Will and Sandy move their offices into a nearby vacant warehouse. Will and his girlfriend Liv have to deal with her behaviorally challenged thirteen year old daughter. At the same time Will has to deal with constant burglaries at his new office. One night, he spots Miro trying to break into the building. He chases Miro to his run down apartment block and watches as he returns home to his mother, Amira. Soon, Will 'meets' Amira and they begin an affair. Amira quickly learns that Will holds the key to her son's future."
