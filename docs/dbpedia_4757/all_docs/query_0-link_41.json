        "text": "British actress Susannah York has died at the age of 72 after suffering from cancer, her son has said.\n\nShe appeared in film, TV and theatre during a career which began in the 1960s.\n\nShe was nominated for a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in the 1969 film They Shoot Horses, Don't They? and won a Bafta for the same role.\n\nHer son Orlando Wells told the Telegraph newspaper, external that she was \"an absolutely fantastic mother\".\n\n\"She loved nothing more than cooking a good Sunday roast and sitting around a fire of a winter's evening. In some sense, she was quite a home girl. Both Sasha [Orlando's sister] and I feel incredibly lucky to have her as a mother.''\n\nMP and former actress Glenda Jackson, who starred with York in the 1974 production of The Maids, paid tribute, saying her death \"came as a big shock\".\n\n\"She seemed too young to go,\" she added. \"We worked very well together.\n\n\"It was a very interesting production and she was very easy to work with.\"\n\nBritish film director Richard Bracewell, who worked with York in his first film, The Gigolos, in 2006, described her as \"a pussycat\".\n\n\"She was an absolute pleasure, a joy to work with, to prepare the film with,\" he said.\n\n\"But then, like a cat, the moment the camera was on her, the moment the film was turning, she leapt into life and she absolutely grabbed the screen, absolutely electrifying the moment the camera was turning over.\""
