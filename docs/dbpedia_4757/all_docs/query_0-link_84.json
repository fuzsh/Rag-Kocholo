        "text": "Frank Gehry may be the most famous architect at work today, but, like so many of his peers, he has found it nearly impossible to build in New York. Twenty years ago, he designed a tower for the site of Madison Square Garden which never got built, and in recent years a number of projects—a redesign of One Times Square, a downtown branch of the Guggenheim, a hotel for Ian Schrager—have all foundered. Now, at the age of seventy-seven, Gehry has completed his first freestanding New York building, a headquarters for Barry Diller’s InterActiveCorp, in Chelsea. It is only ten stories tall, but you can’t drive down the West Side Highway without seeing it—a white glass palazzo that looks less like a building than like a computer-generated image of one. On a cloudy day, it appears to fade into the mist. Gehry has likened the billowing forms of the façade to sails, and from a distance it seems to be made of some kind of plastic or fibreglass. All-glass buildings often feel stiff, but in Gehry’s hands even glass is relaxed.\n\nNo Gehry building is ordered in a traditional way, but this one comes closer than most. There is a broad, nearly symmetrical five-story base, with a façade that zigzags in and out, making five roughly equal sections. On top of this is a narrower five-story tower of Gehry’s swooping, rhythmic shapes. The façade, unusually for Gehry, is made of a single material: instead of a jumble of clashing forms, the glass is all you see, covering everything like a blanket. By Gehry’s standards, this is serene, but behind the placid exterior are some daring technical maneuvers, including a number of concrete structural columns set at angles. During construction, the Georgetown Company, Diller’s partner in the development, got calls from people who wondered if it knew that the building was going up crooked.\n\nThere are more than fifteen hundred panels of glass in the InterActiveCorp building, and almost every one is unique; they curve to fit the shape of the façade, gently concave one moment, convex the next. The white color is provided by ceramic dots, known as frits, bonded to the glass. Fritting is a common way of reducing glare in glass buildings, but Gehry has exploited its potential for drama. Each panel is densely fritted at the top and bottom but nearly clear at eye level. Viewed from the outside, the building exhibits dark, hazy horizontal stripes, as if the glass had been spray-painted. At night, when the offices are lit, the pattern will reverse, and the clear glass sections will appear lighter. “The whole building will glow like a lantern,” Gehry told me.\n\nThe description is characteristic of Gehry, who, for all his experimentation, is always more interested in emotional impact than in architectural dogma. This helps explain the scale of his current celebrity. Last year, he made a guest appearance on “The Simpsons,” and this year saw the release of a worshipful documentary, “Sketches of Frank Gehry,” by the director Sydney Pollack. In the “Simpsons” episode, Gehry designs a satirically Gehryesque concert hall that ends up being converted into a prison, and there are moments when it seems that Frank Gehry’s fame could be its own kind of prison, that his style will become mere shtick. Certainly Gehry is not good at saying no. He has designed watches for Fossil—his signature prominently displayed on the watch faces—and earlier this year Tiffany launched a line of his jewelry. (It features many of the twisting shapes familiar from his architecture, but what is revolutionary in a building is merely pleasant in a necklace.) The angst-filled artist we see in Pollack’s movie is unlikely to round out his days as a brand franchise, but he clearly needs commissions that spur new discoveries rather than clients who just want his name on their projects.\n\nBarry Diller is an ideal client for Gehry. He and his development partner Marshall Rose encouraged experiment, but Diller also has a company to run. Gehry has crafted interiors that balance architectural expression and practical concerns. Most of its offices will bear some hint of Gehry’s style—a tilted wall, or a view that, because of the zigzagging shape, looks back at the building’s own façade—but there is no space so oddly shaped that you can’t work in it. People talk about the theatrics of Gehry’s architecture, but he has an intuitive sense of when to express himself audaciously and when to be quiet.\n\nIt’s a shame that this quality hasn’t been more in evidence in Gehry’s other New York venture, the Atlantic Yards development, in Brooklyn. This cluster of skyscrapers extending twenty-two acres around a new basketball arena for the Nets is the biggest project he has ever undertaken, and it has been the subject of bitter controversy for months. (Last month, following recommendations from the City Planning Commission, the plans were scaled back by eight per cent, but the project remains enormous.) Opponents complain that the sixteen residential towers will create a wall between the neighborhoods of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights. So far, they have cast the developer, Bruce Ratner, as the villain, suggesting that he is cynically using Gehry’s name to add prestige to an ill-conceived scheme. In an open letter to Gehry published in Slate, the novelist Jonathan Lethem wrote, “I’ve been struggling to understand how someone of your sensibilities can have drifted into such an unfortunate alliance, with such potentially disastrous results.”\n\nYet Gehry’s design is a large part of the problem. He told me that he accepted the job in part because he has never taken on this kind of urban challenge, but his talents hardly seem suited to it. Gehry’s great success has come from architectural jewels that sparkle against the background of the rest of a city—the Bilbao Guggenheim; the Walt Disney Concert Hall, in Los Angeles. In Brooklyn, the task is to create a coherent cityscape that relates comfortably to its surroundings. Gehry tried to do this by grouping some understated towers around a few very elaborate ones. (The six-hundred-and-twenty-foot-high main tower, foolishly named Miss Brooklyn, is full of self-conscious Gehryisms.) Rather than giving a sense of foreground and background, the juxtaposition of plain and fancy just looks like a few Gehrys bought for full price next to several bought at discount.\n\nGehry has told me that he sees the project as a kind of homage to the old Manhattan sky line, but the romance of that vista is a happy accident of diverse buildings in a tight web of streets. Atlantic Yards, by contrast, involves eliminating streets, and has the look more of a single structure spanning multiple blocks than of a townscape that has grown organically. Gehry perhaps conceived of the whole thing as one huge object that could play off against the city—a gigantic version of one of his jewels. The problem with trying to do Bilbao on this scale is that it ceases to be an eccentric counterpoint to the context. It is the context.\n\nBuried within the construction is the building that was the catalyst for the entire project—an arena for the Nets, the basketball team purchased by Ratner and which he intends to move from New Jersey to Brooklyn. The arena is the best part of Gehry’s plan. Its glass-enclosed spaces bring vibrancy to the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, and it will contain lots of public areas, not just for spectators but for anyone passing through. Such exclamation points in a cityscape are something Gehry knows how to create better than anyone. That’s what Diller asked him to do, and it worked. Ratner’s exclamation point, however, unlike Diller’s, can’t pay for itself, and Ratner is using it as a loss leader to justify an enormous real-estate venture. Although the site cries out for development, neither Ratner nor Gehry has a convincing idea of how this should be done. Ratner seems to have been less interested in using Gehry’s architectural talent to best advantage than in trying to leverage his celebrity to make an unpopular development more palatable. Gehry, for his part, clearly loved the idea of taking on the biggest project in New York. But even the most famous architect in the world has limits. ♦"
