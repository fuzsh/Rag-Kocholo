        "text": "JOHN Lancken may have been awarded two Oscars but he finds it very difficult to enjoy a movie.\n\n“I’ve become critical of the sound quality in films,” Lancken said. “And I can’t listen to the television through TV speakers.”\n\nThe businessman pioneered digital sampling, music sequencing and was developing 3D sound as far back as 2006. He worked on The Matrix, Heat starring Robert De Niro and the Sydney Pollack thriller The Firm starring Tom Cruise.\n\nIn 2001 and again in 2004 Lancken and the research and development team of Frenchs Forest business Fairlight AU, were awarded Oscars for scientific work that enhanced feature films.\n\n“They were awarded not won,” Mr Lancken clarifies.\n\n“It was a rigorous process by a panel of highly regarded technicians. It was almost like getting a sainthood.”\n\nWithin days of receiving his first Academy Award in the US, Lancken flew back to Sydney and bought a house in Killarney Heights.\n\n“The only noise you hear from this property is from the kookaburras and lorikeets and you can’t be seen by any neighbours,” he said.\n\nThe five-bedroom house at 12 Athlone Cres is on the market for the first time in 16 years. It has a northeast aspect, walls of glass, views over Garigal National Park and a large solar-heated saltwater swimming pool.\n\n“I love the fact you roll out of the car and on to the back deck beside the pool. The kitchen, formal and casual living rooms, man cave and three bedrooms are all on one level,” he said.\n\nTwo bedrooms are upstairs but it is possible to live entirely on the main level.\n\nThe brick home goes to auction on March 11 through Raine and Horne Forestville.\n\nThe home has a price guide of 2 to $2.2 million."
