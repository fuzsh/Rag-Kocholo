        "text": ".By Scott Ross\n\nSee also: Part One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Three\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/11/the-magic-factory-part-three-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-screenwriters-screenwriting-and-screenplays/\n\nPart Four\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/the-magic-factory-part-four-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-individual-films-and-miscellaneous-titles/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nIII. Criticism\n\nOf (obvious) deep concern to the present writer, good movie criticism has never been exactly plentiful, although criticism generally has certainly been a hell of a lot healthier than it is today. On the other hand, so has everything else. Alas, in a land where either editors no longer know the rudiments of their jobs or writers for print and online publication simply do as they please without the nagging interference of the men and women who used routinely to turn poor writing into the acceptable and the good into the great, we can expect little better than what we get. (I’d love an editor to give my work the once-over before I post it — probably the fond wish of some of you as well — but since I get paid nothing for this and thus cannot afford to hire one…)\n\nGore Vidal famously noted that there can be no great writers without great readers, and not only was he correct but his aphorism has a corollary applicable to film criticism: There can be no great movie critics without great movies, and great movie audiences. It’s no accident, then, that most of the best-written movie criticism in America was of another era or focuses on the movies of the past.\n\n21. Agee on Film Volume 1: Essays and Reviews by James Agee (1958) (Library of America edition [#160]: James Agee: Film Writing and Selected Journalism: Agee on Film / Uncollected Film Writing / The Night of the Hunter / Journalism and Film Reviews, 2005)\n\nWhenever I want to remind myself what a great writer can do with material scarcely worthy of his notice (and to feel correspondingly wretched about my own, comparatively anemic, abilities) I re-read Agee’s reviews, written mostly for Time and The Nation. While he seldom got near a movie good enough to merit his attention, it’s safe to say that many if not most of the pictures he routinely critiqued during this period — roughly 1942 to 1948 — often in omnibus groupings, would be entirely forgotten except for his memorable reviews of them: His response to one standard B-musical olio (“Vaudeville is dead; I wish to God someone would bury it.”) inters any number of equally silly wastes of time. Yet however biting Agee’s wit could be, his open-heartedness is never far from the surface. I’m not sure what would possess a man, even the world’s most devoted Charlie Chaplin fan, to take three long columns to review Monsieur Verdoux, and then to complain that a three-part critique is not long enough to address it fully. But one would rather Agee’s very occasional folly than the sanest work of almost anyone else of the period. No writer of his generation had as much love for, and knowledge about, silent comedy than Agee, and his 1949 Life magazine essay “Comedy’s Greatest Era” is arguably the best overview of the pictures Agee loved as a boy and which were still fueling his ardor for movies 30 and more years later.\n\nIf you really want to feel like an inarticulate boob, read Dwight McDonald’s piece on Agee in which he quotes letters from his then 16 year-old friend, who not only had a fully worked-out philosophical attitude toward movies, a subject beneath the contempt of most of his contemporaries, but astonishingly sophisticated ideas on how they could be made better and with greater artistic and psychological license. It may be that Agee, who so badly wanted to direct movies from a young age, would, had he lived to try his hand at it, have made an arty mess of things. Perhaps he wouldn’t have. Maybe he would have made something astonishing. The great catastrophe of his largely self-foreshortened life is that neither we nor he ever got to find out. But his reviews will live on as long as there are at least a few great readers around to cherish them.\n\nSee also: Dwight MacDonald on Movies (1969) Speaking of MacDonald, this collection of his occasional reviews of the late 1950s and early-to-mid 1960s is a useful one, even if his tastes diverged from much of the movie-going public of the time and aligned, somewhat alarmingly, all too closely to those of John Simon, who whatever his gifts as a theatre critic, and his adoration of Ingmar Bergman, could nearly always be counted upon to get any English or American picture wrong. Anyone can commit a critical error now and then; for men this erudite to get so many now classic pictures (The Apartment, Psycho, One Two Three, Hud, Tom Jones) wrong is dismaying. MacDonald also, like Simon, got schoolmarmishly huffy about the 1962 Cape Fear. He should only have lived to see what Scorsese did with it.\n\n22. A Biographical Dictionary of Film David Thomson (1975; Revised and expanded numerous times)\n\nThomson is a troublesome writer: Part critic-part biographer, a sometimes-lazy researcher and a sort of celebrity voyeur, speculating on the private lives of personalities in a way that most of us indulge in privately but which becomes unseemly and even creepy when aired in print. He’s also an unrepentant auteurist; nowhere in the several revisions of his 1975 Biographical Dictionary will you see a single entry on a screenwriter unless he happens to be a director. (“Over 800 directors, actors, actresses, producers” reads the cover blurb.) Yet he’s fascinating to read, his opinions alternatively outrageous and insightful. In no other book, I think, will you read an entry on W.C. Fields written, appropriately, in the voice of Charles Dickens — appropriate not only for Fields’ own Dickensian character names and florid, circumlocuted Victorian dialogue (as well as his having starred as Micawber in the 1935 David Copperfield) but to his dying on Dickens’ special provenance: Christmas day.\n\n23. Canned Goods as Caviar: American Film Comedies of the 1930s Gerald Weales (1985)\n\nWeales illuminates the movie decade year by year, with a single picture presenting each, from City Lights in 1931 to Destry Rides Again in 1939 and taking in as well the Marx Bros., Mae West, W.C. Fields, Ben Hecht, William Wellman, Leo McCarey, John Ford, Morrie Ryskind, Gregory La Cava, Frank Capra, Robert Riskind and Howard Hawks. Although as another reader noted a better title might have been Caviar as Canned Goods, Weales’ is an eloquent analysis of the greatest decade for American comedy after the merging of picture and sound — a period in which a general literacy prevailed that is now unimaginable, and which permitted genuinely witty (as opposed to wise-ass) dialogue to be heard in the nation’s motion picture theaters on a regular basis. (We can obviously except Chaplin from that generalization.) My only cavil is that Weales has a tendency to over-emphasize directors when surely the writers of these pictures were often of at least equal if not greater importance.\n\nSee also: We’re in the Money: Depression America and Its Films Andrew Bergman (1971) Before becoming a published mystery novelist (the Jack LeVine series) and screenwriter (Tex X, which became Blazing Saddles; the original The In-Laws; The Freshman) Bergman was a doctoral student. This, his PhD thesis, is a bracing overview of early 1930s American movies, intelligent, knowledgeable and erudite. Bergman is especially good on the Warner “social problem” pictures and their frequent, now forgotten, star, the remarkable Richard Barthelmess.\n\n24. The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies Vito Russo (1981; Updated, 1987)\n\nWhen I discovered Russo’s book in 1981, it was with the force of revelation. For an avid movie lover and a young gay man of 20, The Celluloid Closet almost seemed to be the book I’d waited my adolescence for without knowing it. Parker Tyler’s 1972 Screening the Sexes: Homosexuality in the Movies got to the subject first, but I don’t know anyone who has ever been able to get through it, including me. Russo didn’t tag absolutely every gay (or implied) character who ever appeared in a movie, nor did he try to. But his scholarship is impeccable, and he airs his critiques with intelligence, enthusiasm and wit. The author had no idea (nor did the rest of us) that something eventually called AIDS was about to alter the existence of every gay man on the planet, a vulnerability that, rather surprisingly, did more to advance the cause of gay civil rights than Stonewall or Anita Bryant, and included greater — though not necessarily more positive — visibility in popular culture. Harlan Ellison was fond of quoting Pasteur’s dictum that “Chance favors the prepared mind.” Russo’s was one of the most prepared of his generation.\n\nSee also: Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969 William J. Mann (2001) and Screened Out: Playing Gay in Hollywood from Edison to Stonewall Richard Barrios (2002) Two entertaining surveys, the first of gay and bisexual Hollywood figures, the second of movies with overt or coded homosexual characters which is, perhaps surprisingly, not merely a Celluloid Closet re-tread.\n\n25. Warning Shadows: Home Alone with Classic Cinema Gary Giddins (2010)\n\nGiddins, arguably the finest critic and historian of American jazz, latterly turned his attentions to movies. This collection of pieces from The Sun, wedded to the DVD releases of a wide range of pictures both domestic and foreign, exhibits his customary taste, intelligence and wit, and one wishes Giddins would compile a compendium of capsule reviews which might, with Pauline Kael’s 5001 Nights at the Movies, more or less obliterate the need for Leonard Maltin’s middlebrow movie guides. (But then I’ve been wishing for decades that David Denby would put together a collection of his movie reviews and that’s never happened.)\n\nSee also: Natural Selection: Gary Giddins on Comedy, Film, Music and Books (2006)\n\n26. On the Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties Brandon French (1978)\n\nOne of the most graceful, beautifully written books of its kind, a knowing survey of ten movies from a transitional decade’s screen representation of women, from Sunset Boulevard (1950) to Some Like it Hot (1959). Far from a doctrinaire broadside, French’s exceptionally trenchant study benefits not only from its author’s thoughtful analyses but from her limpid prose, which reminds the reader of why, whatever its flaws or virtues (and its perhaps suspicious origins) the so-called second wave of feminism had to occur. Each time I return to its pages I find this book more lucid, and more charming, than I’ve remembered from my previous readings.\n\nSee also: The Runaway Bride: Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930s Elizabeth Kendall (1990) Kendall’s auteurist approach is unique: She pairs several important actresses (Stanwyck, Colbert, Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Jean Arthur, Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne) with the directors (Capra, Sturges, George Stevens, Gregory La Cava, Leo McCarey) of their great romantic/screwball comedies. Despite my aversion to the Auteur Theory as popularized by the idiotic Andrew Sarris, Kendall’s is a delightful study.\n\n27. Popcorn Venus: Women, Movies, and the American Dream Marjorie Rosen (1974)\n\nMolly Haskell’s sour, fag-baiting feminist broadside From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies got far more ink and sold many more copies — she knew what she was doing putting “rape” in her title — but Rosen’s is the finer achievement, elegant and witty. (And, unlike Haskell, Rosen doesn’t confuse an actress’s screen persona with the performer herself.) A bright, perceptive cultural critic, Rosen charts the development of women in American movies from the Victorianism of the ‘teens through the emergence in the 1920s of the independent “flapper” and the ’30s and ’40s working girl all the way to the Second Wave revolution of the early 1970s: From “Little Mary” Pickford to Jane Fonda in Klute.\n\n28. Reeling Pauline Kael (1977)\n\nReaders of these pages will know how highly I esteem Kael’s criticism, and had the 1970s never happened she still would have been an important and influential writer on the movies. But as great writers need great readers, they also need great subjects, and the era of adult, personal American filmmaking that ran from roughly 1967 to 1982 was Kael’s great subject. When the phenomenal receipts for the Star Wars series rang down the curtain on popular movies for mature adults Kael was as marooned as the writers, actors and directors she championed and about whose best work she wrote more urgently and enticingly than anyone else. John Simon, in his review of Reeling, sneered at Kael for asserting that “we [were] living though a classic period for movies,” but she was entirely correct, among the first to sense that something extraordinary, and exceptional, was going on, and that even those pictures about which she was less enthusiastic were a part of that.* I’m just slightly too young (a happy phrase I don’t get many opportunities to use) to have seen many when they were new, or to have read Kael’s critiques of them then, but I can well imagine the keenness with which avid moviegoers of the time, many of them of the so-called “Film Generation,” must have anticipated reading what Kael had to say about the newest release. Even her detractors —Renata Adler perhaps excepted — must admit that having such a lightning-rod of a movie critic at the center of popular discourse was a healthy thing, especially now that most critics function as little but public relations flacks for the dwindling pack of major studios, all of which will disappear up Disney’s asshole ere long.\n\nSee also: Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (1968), Going Steady (1970), Deeper Into Movies (1973) and When the Lights Go Down: Film Writings 1975 – 1980 (1980) Taken together with Reeling, these titles constitute a vest-pocket history of the last great period of American movies, and the last we are ever likely to get: Our best movie critic on our best decade and a half of popular entertainment.\n\n5001 Nights at the Movies (1982 / Updated, 1991) During the 1950s Kael contributed capsule reviews for the Berkeley revival house she managed, later publishing a clutch of them as “The Movie Past” in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. These eventually resurfaced in the movie listings of The New Yorker before Kael collected them, along with excerpts from many of her New Yorker reviews, into this compulsively readable compendium. Once you start poring over it, you may come to and realize you’ve been reading for hours.\n\nFollowing Kael’s death in 2001, the New Yorker began busily scrubbing these brief reviews of classic movies from its pages, replacing them with the mind-numbingly pretentious yawping of one Richard Brody. It almost seemed the magazine wished to erase any trace of Kael’s connection to it… and considering how many readers she brought to what (Seymour Hirsch’s reporting to one side) had become a moribund and largely irrelevant publication, that’s a real slap in the face. Even more puzzling, Brody’s stultifying academism is precisely the sort of cloistered, dead prose and mode of thought Kael’s jazzy approach was in opposition to. Exactly what message is the New Yorker sending?\n\n29. Toms Coons Mulattoes Mammies and Bucks: An Interpretive History of Blacks in American Film Donald Bogle (1973; revised and expanded numerous times)\n\nLike The Celluloid Closet years later, Bogle’s was a book whose timeliness, encyclopedic breadth and critical acumen were sorely needed. His analyses are sharp and genuinely witty (especially in the photo captions), evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the actors and personalities available to black audiences on their theater screens — always assuming they could see them, since in the South black performers, especially those in musicals, were often cut from the movies in which they appeared. Bogle is particularly perceptive on the acting limitations of a number of sacred cows as well as of those pictures whose good social intentions were overwhelmed by their earnestness and general mediocrity. The last edition of Toms etc. I read was the revision of 1994, in part because I got the feeling that the first book did not need updating or expansion; it was a product of its time, and brought needed discussion to a too-long neglected topic. But did the original criteria on which Bogle based his study still obtain in the 1990s, and beyond? I wish that, instead of grafting new material onto a splendid old book, its gifted author would create a new, perhaps encyclopedic, title specifically designed to explicate what has happened since 1973.\n\nSee also: The Devil Finds Work (James Baldwin) 1976 Baldwin’s book-length essay on race, politics and film is also a memoir of one Negro boy’s experience of American movies not made with him — or any black audience — in mind.\n\nIV. Filmmakers\n\nAs an unrepentant anti-auteurist, I tend to favor the work of writer-directors — or at least, those filmmakers (Ford, Cukor, Hitchcock, Hawks, Lumet, George Roy Hill, Peter Bogdanovich) who not only worked closely with their scenarists but had they so chosen could have taken a screenwriting credit on most of the movies they directed. Robert Altman, who could be a writer fucker, I except from this personal rule because, whoever wrote it, an Altman movie was an Altman movie. He was both a genuine innovator and a poet, and how many of these have there been in American movies?\n\n30. Billy Wilder in Hollywood Maurice Zolotow (1977; Updated in 1987)\n\nI feel quite sure Zolotow’s is by no means the finest book written about my favorite writer-director. However, because of a writing project I began long ago and have not been able to finish, I have deliberately not read any of the subsequent books published about him and his movies in the years since. Zolotow’s was the first biography of Wilder and while he was either a bit gullible, unwilling to challenge his subject’s self-devised mythology (and the myths devised by others) or unable to do the research necessary to debunk them — and also had a dismaying inability to retell an anecdote without somehow mucking up the punchline — his book is a great deal of fun and had the advantage of being authorized, so Wilder’s distinctive voice prevails throughout.\n\n31. Buster Keaton: Tempest in a Flat Hat Edward McPherson (2007)\n\nFollowing my introduction to silent comedy as a nine-year-old, via a children’s matinee of the Robert Youngson compilation 30 Years of Fun and (thanks to a New Year’s Eve PBS marathon of his Mutual comedies) I became an instant Charles Chaplin fan. Buster Keaton’s great shorts and features were tougher to see in those years, but the more of them I encountered the higher he rose in my estimation. Now, I happen to think that comparing these two short-statured giants is a waste of time, especially since the Keaton camp tends to look down its nose at Charlie for his sentimentality and I have no interest in starting an argument. But I must admit that as time has gone by I find Keaton, while ingenious and physically astonishing, a more limited performer and his movies, taken as a whole, surprisingly and at times almost depressingly gruesome. That doesn’t mean Keaton’s pictures are not funny; indeed, his 1924 The Navigator is the second-funniest movie I’ve ever seen (the first is Richard Pryor: Live in Concert) while The General (1927) manages to be beautiful, dramatic and hilarious and watching his two-reelers in order, as I did last year, is an exercise in genuine dazzlement. His life, unfortunately, was as disordered as his best work was controlled; in addition to being an alcoholic he seems to have been both hapless and alarmingly passive. He got a superb biographer in Edward McPherson, whose wonderfully titled volume was one of the most pleasant surprises of the early ‘aughts.\n\nSee also: Keaton: The Man Who Wouldn’t Lie Down Tom Dardis (1979) A good early biography detailing Buster’s travails and his achievements.\n\n32. Chaplin: His Life and Art David Robinson (1985)\n\nI wish I could adequately convey the excitement I experienced when this book was published in America, or the complete spell it wove over me as I read it over several completely satisfying weeks. The breadth of its author’s knowledge, and the extent of his research, were impeccable as he set about gently deflating the mythology that had accrued to Charles Spencer Chaplin, some of it generated by Charlie himself. Robinson’s was the first book of which I am aware to detail the painstaking manner in which Chaplin worked out his great comedies. (Much of this was also explicated in Kevin Brownlow and David Gill’s three-part 1983 documentary Unknown Chaplin.) He is also correct on the impact of Charlie’s pretentious, self-serving memoir My Autobiography (1964) and the hurt it generated among the many long-time Chaplin associates whom he slighted in it. Robinson’s remains the Chaplin book of Chaplin books.\n\nSee also: Chaplin: The Mirror of Opinion David Robinson (1984) The year before his biography of Chaplin was completed, Robinson published this fascinating volume which details what was written and said about Charlie during the various important periods of his life. It’s almost a Concordance to the biography, but fully able to stand on its own.\n\n33. Chasing the Light: Writing, Directing, [sic] and Surviving Platoon, Midnight Express, Scarface, Salvador, [sic] and the Movie Game Oliver Stone (2020)\n\nI don’t know how the proliferation of unnecessary commas before the conjunction “and” took hold, or why it affects even seasoned writers. That small cavil aside, this is the book Stone’s admirers have been waiting for, detailing his childhood and youth, his Viet Nam experience and the frustrating road he traversed from struggling screenwriter to Academy-honored writer and director. Stone spares no one, least of all himself, and as is so often the case with the most interesting movies what a friend and I used to call “the backstage stuff” is almost as interesting as the pictures themselves (and occasionally more so.) Stone’s prose is both graceful and unflinching, and his book a deep pleasure to read. Chasing the Light takes the reader up to the triumph of Platoon, so we can only hope that Stone will bring out a second volume on the years of his greatest daring and achievement.\n\n34. David Lean: A Biography Kevin Brownlow (1996)\n\nBrownlow’s biography honors Lean but also sees him plain, his follies as notable as his masterworks and his personal style that of a cold, shy autocrat with flashes of great decency. The author had enviable access to Lean, so we hear his voice throughout; Brownlow also interviewed as many of Lean’s old associates as he could, resulting in descriptions of the making of his movies that are remarkably thorough. Appropriately, he devotes three long chapters to Lawrence of Arabia, Lean’s magnum opus and, despite its somewhat muddled politics, one of the great glories of world cinema. Brownlow, whose subject has been the silent movie, judges Lean not merely as a great editor but a director whose eye missed little. Anyone who has seen his adaptation of Great Expectations remembers with a shiver up the spine the opening sequence in which Pip encounters Magwitch. Equally likely to sear themselves in the mind are the climax of Oliver Twist; the exquisite views of Venice in Summertime; the scene at the well, the train wreck, the hallucinogenic ship, the attack on Aqaba and the desert itself in Lawrence; the long train journey, the ice palace and Omar Sharif’s trek across the desert of snow in Doctor Zhivago; Judy Davis’ encounter with the monkeys and the death of Peggy Ashcroft in A Passage to India; and the many indelible sequences in Bridge on the River Kwai. Lean was a born filmmaker, and as Brownlow makes clear, the movies gave him a life that saved him from the despair that so often attends the misfit of genius.\n\nSee also: David Lean Stephen Silverman (1992) A through, beautiful coffee-table volume limning Lean’s filmography.\n\nLawrence of Arabia: The 20th Anniversary Pictorial History L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin (1992) A well-written celebration of Lean’s finest picture, with glorious color photographs throughout.\n\n35. The Hustons Lawrence Grobel (1989; Revised and updated, 2014)\n\nA revealing group biography of one of Hollywood’s great dynasties, and a disturbing critique of its center, the gifted but deeply troubled, sadistic, misogynist John. Grobel also points out that the writer-director’s best features were those based on second and third-rank material (The Maltese Falcon, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, The Night of the Iguana, The Kremlin Letter, The Man Who Would Be King, Prizzi’s Honor) and that it was only when he tackled the first-rate (The Red Badge of Courage, Moby-Dick, Wise Blood, Under the Volcano) that he floundered. (The single notable exception is Huston’s swansong, the beautifully observed The Dead, which somehow almost miraculously approximates in cinematic terms its universally well-regarded source.) Grobel chronicles the family from John’s actor father Walter to John’s children, the actress Angelica and his eventual actor/writer/director sons Tony and Danny. But it’s John who is the focal point of the book, and who, while endlessly fascinating, leaves the most unpleasant aftertaste.\n\n36. Making Movies Sidney Lumet (1996)\n\nAlthough there have been countless “how-to” books published on filmmaking, some dating back to the 1920s, Lumet’s is the only volume I know of in which an important movie director discusses the process at length, and covers every department. While the specific means by which Lumet achieved his considerable effects are, obviously, unique to him (few directors care to rehearse their actors as Lumet routinely did, for example) the anecdotes he offers as illustrations of each topic under discussion express a universality that I’m sure has resonated with filmmakers who’ve read his book. We were the poorer for the loss of this most humane filmmaker but Making Movies continues to shine with the same qualities that mark his work on film.\n\nSee also: Sidney Lumet: A Life Maura Spiegel (2019) A lovely first biography of Lumet, written with thoughtfulness and grace. Among other things, Spiegel had access to Lumet’s unfinished memoir, abandoned shortly after it was begun and in which the remembered pain of his childhood and youthful experience apparently overwhelmed their author. Spiegel also reveals that Lumet seldom looked back at his own work; his impatience to push forward was something Pauline Kael noted early on, when she observed the filming of The Group, and which she felt limited him as a director. Perhaps she might have been a bit more compassionate had she known about Sidney’s youthful traumas: His father, the Yiddish actor Baruch Lumet, exploited his young son as a child actor, his mother died when he was a boy and his sister was deeply troubled. No wonder he was always playing hurry-up.\n\n37. On Cukor Gavin Lambert (1972; Reprinted, 2000)\n\nIn the early 1970s Gavin Lambert, an excellent novelist, biographer and sometime screenwriter (with a special focus, in a time when it was definitely not the thing, on gay characters) conducted in-depth interviews with his friend George Cukor on the movies he’d directed. The result is a wonderful free-ranging discussion on some of the brightest and most entertaining pictures of the talkie era: Dinner at Eight, David Copperfield, Holiday, The Women, The Philadelphia Story, Adam’s Rib, Born Yesterday, The Marrying Kind, It Should Happen to You, the 1954 A Star is Born. Around the time of On Cukor Lambert also wrote GWTW, the first book-length account of the making of Gone with the Wind. It was a picture from which Cukor, its original director, had famously been fired, for reasons that remain murky but which may have been the result of Clark Gable’s discomfort with him. The 2000 edition of On Cukor was reimagined as a well-illustrated coffee-table book.\n\nSee also: A Double Life: George Cukor Patrick McGilligan (1992) The first biography of Cukor, by one of our best and most thorough writers on film.\n\n38. Mainly About Lindsay Anderson Gavin Lambert (2000)\n\nAlthough I had not seen any of Anderson’s pictures and only one video of a play he directed (David Storey’s Home) when I stumbled upon Lambert’s affectionate biography/memoir I found myself entranced by the book, its subject’s rigorous intelligence and its author’s reconstruction of his friendship with his one-time fellow cineaste co-founder and contributor to Sequence magazine.\n\nThe title is a nod to Anderson’s own influential study About John Ford.\n\nSee also: Inside Daisy Clover (1963), arguably the best novel ever written about Hollywood and Running Time (1982), the second-best.\n\n39. Orson Welles: A Biography Barbara Leaming (1985)\n\nLeaming, perhaps taking a leaf from Whitney Stein’s Bette Davis book Mother Goddam, wrote her fascinating authorized biography of Welles with Orson’s input. Due to his intimate involvement with it, and because he would die a few months after her book saw publication, Leaming’s biography became in a way a final portrait of the playwright, actor-manager, radio and theatre innovator and great, radical filmmaker whose work exerted a powerful influence over the medium of film. It was a harsh (and expensive) mistress, one that demanded of its devotee more time and attention than any other art form and which still reverberate, even among ignoramuses who’ve never seen a frame of Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Lady from Shanghai, MacBeth, Othello, Mr. Arkadin, Touch of Evil, Chimes at Midnight or F for Fake. In Welles’ case that meant taking on acting work in lesser pictures as a means of earning the funds to produce his own, and chasing after deals that were somehow never finalized. As a result, a great moviemaker left us with far fewer pictures than he intended. Leaming illuminates both Welles’ ardor and the decades-long frustrations which, along with his excessive weight, almost certainly led to his death at 70.\n\n40. Robert Altman: The Oral Biography Michael Zuckoff (2010)\n\nThe form Zuckoff employed for his Altman book is so perfect for its subject, one of the great innovators of motion picture soundtracks, and most of whose movies are essentially kaleidoscopic, I’m amazed no one came up with before. Inevitably with these things, there is occasionally a kind of Rashomon effect. There is also much agreement. The form seems to me eminently fair and gives a marvelous sense of perspective on the various movies Altman made, as well as on his personality.\n\nSee also: Robert Altman: Jumping Off the Cliff Patrick McGilligan (1991) McGilligan has for decades been quietly amassing a stack of fine, non-sensational biographies of important figures in American movies. This is one of his best.\n\n41. Searching for John Ford Joseph McBride (2001)\n\nMcBride is, like Patrick McGilligan, one of our best and most reliable writers on movies and their makers, especially on Orson Welles. Here he gives serious consideration (838 pages) to Welles’ favorite filmmaker. The result is, I suspect — and barring a fuller discussion of his possible bisexuality, hinted at elsewhere — essentially the definitive Ford biography. I do not believe that any biographer can fully explicate his subject, any more than any human being ever completely knows himself, and Ford was more complicated than most. Yet if McBride cannot reach into the man’s psyche and examine the threads that made Ford Ford, he comes awfully damned close.\n\nSee also: About John Ford Lindsay Anderson (1983) A superb study of Ford and his pictures, written with a director’s eye and the perspective of a prickly critic for whom “not quite” is never good enough.\n\nJohn Ford Peter Bogdanovich (Revised and Enlarged Edition, 1978) Bogdanovich’s Ford monograph, expanded and with extensive interviews with the deliberately crotchety director.\n\n42. A Splurch in the Kisser: The Movies of Blake Edwards Sam Wasson (2009)\n\nReaders of these pages may know that I have a great deal of difficulty with Wasson. While I respect the authoritative scope of his knowledge and understanding I find his work sloppy and limited (Fosse) and sometimes shockingly ignorant, even about the subjects of his own books (The Big Goodbye). In the case of Wasson’s wonderfully-titled examination of Blake Edwards my irritation lies with his occasional mind-numbing academic flights, seeking as is common with what Gore Vidal once called “scholar-squirrels,” to root out symbols, with stultifying persistence. When Wasson is good, however, he is very fine indeed, and among other things I am grateful to him for leading me to Ellen Barkin’s marvelous performance in Switch, which I missed in 1991 and which I now treasure.\n\nSee also: Blake Edwards Peter Lehman and William Luhr (1981) and Returning to the Scene: Blake Edwards, Volume 2 Peter Lehman and William Luhr (1989) Speaking of scholar-squirrels, these two volumes are both useful and annoying, in the rather typical academic style. But for many years they were all we had, so that usefulness must be acknowledged.\n\nBlake Edwards Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series) Gabriella Oldham (2017) A bit repetitious — Edwards tended to tell the same anecdotes repeatedly — but full of goodies.\n\n43. A Third Face: My Tale of Writing, Fighting, and Filmmaking Samuel Fuller (2004)\n\nI don’t know whether, post-stroke, Fuller dictated this superb memoir or not, although it sounds like his speech. Frankly I don’t care if Fuller spoke it, typed it, wrote it longhand or whether it appeared, fully formed, like Venus from his forehead. A Third Face is one of the finest autobiographies any movie writer or director has ever written, and it may be the best of all such books. Fuller brings everything he was and did into focus: From impossibly young cub reporter to novelist to screenwriter to soldier to writer-director, and from the lively crime scene of the 1920s through the heartbreaking dismissal of good work in the ’80s. He seemed, even after his debilitating stroke, to have total recall about his life and work, and it’s his unique voice, cigar firmly in place, you hear as you read his wonderful book.\n\nMartin Scorsese famously observed that, “If you don’t like the films of Samuel Fuller, then you just don’t like cinema.” If we ignore the pretentious use of the words “films” and “cinema” (Fuller would have rolled his eyes at both) Scorsese’s observation is entirely correct. If you can look down your nose at the subway sequence at the beginning of Pickup on South Street, or the devastating scene in which Thelma Ritter’s professional stool pigeon is murdered, or the brutal fight between Richard Widmark and Richard Kiley; if you can watch the opening of The Naked Kiss without astonishment; if the transformation of Mark Hamill, on Omaha beach and at the ovens at Falkenau, and the mute child Lee Marvin attempts to bring back to the world of the living in The Big Red One leave you un-moved; if you can watch White Dog and come to the conclusion that the movie is an expression, not of outrage but of racism… you are lost not only to Fuller but to what makes moviemaking special.\n\n44. This is Orson Welles edited by Jonathan Rosenbaum; with Peter Bogdanovich & Orson Welles (1992)\n\nWelles’ great friend Marlene Dietrich once said of him, “When I have seen him, and talked with him, I feel like a plant that has just been watered.” I have the same reaction to this book; re-reading it, which I do every couple of years, opens my senses and, despite the sadness of Welles’ unrealized projects, leaves me in something close to a state of wonder. (The tapes Random House released of some of Welles’ and Bogdanovich’s conversations conversations do likewise for me, although I wish they had been issued on CD as well as cassette.) While these wide-ranging talks were edited by Welles, who sometimes reduced his own words from poetry to prose — for example when he says “under the shadowed elms” on Bogdanovich’s tape but revises it on paper to read, “the shadows of the elms” — and he even added an event that didn’t happen, for flourish, reading their transcripts is such a pleasure that niggling doubts or critiques drift away like grains of sand in a breeze. If the later My Lunches with Orson is to be accepted and Henry Jaglom did not invent any of Welles’ comments or obnoxious attitudes (like many men who are sexually suspect, OW expresses repeated appalling viciousness about gay men), Bogdanovich may have smoothed things out a bit. Welles is at pains not to make critical remarks about other filmmakers, although the few that slipped through are instructive, and apt. As much a mythologist about himself and his movies as Hitchcock at his worst, there is much here that should be taken with skepticism, especially if you don’t know the truth of these matters. Yet everything I said in praise of the book still obtains. And as if the conversations were not sufficient, Jonathan Rosenbaum contributes a career chronology that is surely definitive, and staggering: Once you know how much Welles did, year by year and nearly day-to-day, and how busy his gifts kept him, it forever destroys the boring old “He couldn’t finish anything” critique.\n\nSee also: Citizen Welles: A Biography of Orson Welles Frank Brady (1989) The first biography of Welles following his death in 1985, Brady’s is marked by its intelligence, thoroughness and compassion.\n\nIn My Father’s Shadow: A Daughter Remembers Orson Welles Christopher Welles Feder (2009) A thoughtful, beautifully rendered memoir of her father by Welles’ eldest daughter. (She’s in MacBeth, as the foully murdered young son of McDuff, and the scream she lets out off-screen is chilling.) Although Feder has no axes to grind her portrait of Welles illustrates how manipulative he could be with his children as much as with the adults around him — and how distracted, playing Daddy as if it is a role, and not one in which he had a great deal of interest. Feder is revealing as well about her half-sisters, particularly the Dread Beatrice, who has fucked up everything of her father’s she’s touched, up to and including his funeral. There must be enormous unacknowledged rage at work there.\n\nMaking Movies with Orson Welles Gary Graver with Andrew J. Rausch (2008) As much as anyone other than Welles’ companion and collaborator Oja Kodar it is Graver we owe for everything from F for Fake to the end of Welles’ life. By making himself, as a cinematographer, constantly available to Welles he enabled him to shoot off the cuff, and at considerable cost to Graver’s own career. (Although Welles gave him his writing Oscar for Citizen Kane during the filming of The Other Side of the Wind in lieu of payment.) There I is something touchingly foolish about that, and rather heroic. Graver’s is a lovely book about a period he clearly regarded as the most interesting of his working life.\n\n45. When the Shooting Stops… The Cutting Begins: A Film Editor’s Story Ralph Rosenblum and Robert Karen (1980)\n\nRosenblum’s book is one of the key titles of my pivotal six year post-high school/pre-college period as an autodidact, when I absorbed like an especially thirsty sponge everything I could get my hands on about theatre and movies. In it the veteran editor recalls the ways in which several important pictures on which he worked evolved through his collaboration with their directors during the post-production process. And while we have only the author’s word to support this, it would seem that few movies of the period were more significantly altered in the editing than the adaptations of Herb Gardner’s play A Thousand Clowns and Rowland Barber’s delightful novel The Night They Raided Minsky’s. The most heartbreaking chapter in the book is Rosenblum’s recollection of how with cold-blooded logic Monroe Arnold’s performance of an excoriating monologue in Goodbye, Columbus (and which he was promised would win him an Academy Award) was ruthlessly and gradually trimmed away until his role existed as little more than a walk-on.\n\n46. Who the Devil Made It Peter Bogdanovich (1997) As a young writer and occasional critic, Bogdanovich published several monographs and interview books on movie directors, finally collecting many of them in this entrancing volume. And no, the title does not require a question mark; it’s part of an observation made by Howard Hawks about film directors whose pictures interested him.\n\nSee also: Conversations with The Great Moviemakers of Hollywood’s Golden Age at the American Film Institute George Stevens, Jr. (2006) and Conversations at the American Film Institute with the Great Moviemakers: The Next Generation, From the 1950s to Hollywood Today George Stevens, Jr. (2012) Two superb omnibus reprintings of the old “Dialogue on Film” segments from the late, lamented magazine American Film, in-depth and often revealing colloquies with movie and television actors, writers, directors, editors, cinematographers, designers, composers, critics and producers. Stevens, son of the director, was a co-founder of the American Film Institute, and its director during the first decade which, among other things, saw the creation of the Institute’s Life Achievement Award, once venerated and now, with the likes of George Clooney winning it, a very un-amusing joke. (Actually, the AFI self-dubbing its award “the highest honor in film” is itself hilarious. Sez who?) In any case, these two volumes fully capture the voices of, among others, Harold Lloyd, Raoul Walsh, King Vidor, Fritz Lang, Frank Capra, Ernest Lehman, Arthur Penn, Leonard Rosenman, Neil Simon, Howard Hawks, Robert Towne, Anne V. Coates, James Wong Howe, Roger Corman, William Wyler, Sidney Poitier, John Sayles, William Clothier, Steven Spielberg, David Lean, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Cortez, George Lucas, George Cukor, Gregory Peck, Jack Lemmon, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond, John Huston, Peter Bogdanovich, Ray Bradbury, Fred Zinnemann, Gene Kelly, Richard Brooks, Hal Wallis, Jean Renoir, Robert Altman, Larry Gelbart, Alan Pakula and François Truffaut.\n\n47. Young Orson: The Years of Luck and Genius on the Path to Citizen Kane Patrick McGilligan (2015)\n\nI have over the years read so many books on Orson Welles — my shelves are fairly sagging with volumes by and about him — that I have begun to approach new titles with an inner groan. Will this one merely repeat the many lazily resold myths about Welles? Will it tell me anything I don’t already know? Thankfully, Young Orson wipes away nearly everything we think we know about Welles’ early years, his theatrical triumphs and follies, and most especially about the making of Kane. In 832 meticulously researched, exhaustively sourced and utterly compelling pages, Patrick McGilligan portrays George Orson Welles in all his glory, his contradictions, his achievements, his cruelties and his kindnesses.† McGilligan has written terrific books on Robert Altman, George Cukor, Fritz Lang, Jack Nicholson, Oscar Michaux and Alfred Hitchcock. Young Orson is his chef d’oeuvre. Many biographies are called definitive, and few ever are. This one almost certainly is.‡\n\n*Among them, just taking in the years from 1970 to 1973: M*A*S*H, The Angel Levine, Bartleby, The Liberation of L.B. Jones, The Owl and the Pussycat, I Never Sang for My Father, The Landlord, The Boys in the Band, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx, Something for Everyone, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, The Traveling Executioner, Klute, Fiddler on the Roof, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Cold Turkey, A New Leaf, Bananas, They Might Be Giants, The French Connection, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Sunday Bloody Sunday, The Go-Between, Desperate Characters, The Skin Game, Born to Win, Harold and Maude, The Last Picture Show, The Hot Rock, Travels with My Aunt, What’s Up Doc?, The War Between Men and Women, Frenzy, The Candidate, The Ruling Class, Sleuth, Avanti!, Cabaret, The Godfather, Sounder, Across 110th Street, The Iceman Cometh, The Last Detail, Mean Streets, Oklahoma Crude, Serpico, A Delicate Balance, The Legend of Hell House, The Exorcist, The Last of Sheila, High Plains Drifter, Scorpio, Paper Moon, “Save the Tiger,” Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing, Slither, American Graffiti, Sleeper, The Three Musketeers, The Day of the Jackal, The Seven-Ups, The Sting. Kael would argue with me about the quality of some of those titles, just as I argue with her negative opinions of some of my favorites. But the fact that interesting, intelligent and largely adult movies were being released in this country on practically a weekly basis, for years, is something of a miracle… and one that will not be repeated.\n\n†The single aspect of Welles’ personality which remains underexplored is the one that is likely impossible to pin down, and may be forever elusive, although Joseph McBride has commented on it: His possible, even likely, bisexuality.\n\n‡There are in existence now three foul volumes of Welles biography by a pompous British character actor apparently bent on tearing the man’s reputation to shreds, and which are now routinely deemed “definitive.” Avoid them.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nBrigadier General Black (Dan O’Herlihy): You’re justifying murder.\n\nProfessor Groeteschele (Walter Matthau): Yes, to keep from being murdered.\n\nBlack: In the name of what? To preserve what? Even if we do survive, what are we? Better than what we say they are? What gives us the right to live, then? What makes us worth surviving, Groeteschele? That we are ruthless enough to strike first?\n\nGroeteschele: Yes! Those who can survive are the only ones worth surviving.\n\nA quietly terrifying adaptation of the remarkable Eugene Burdick and Harvey Wheeler nuclear-nightmare novel, Fail-Safe had the ill luck to come up against another movie’s hilariously comedic take on similar material, and to suffer accordingly. The Burdick/Wheeler book takes a dispassionate look at the events of a single day during which a tiny technical failure leads, with a sickening inevitability, to the destruction of Moscow and New York City; as the minutiae of numbing Defense Department procedures and arguments gradually accrue, the tension is slowly tightened, each successive potential solution to the growing crisis breaking down in its turn until it is nearly unbearable… and then it gets even worse. With very few exceptions, Walter Bernstein’s tight, well-judged screenplay follows the novel, and its dialogue, closely. Thought, and psychological revelations and implications, are of course, like prose itself, untranslatable, my chief objection to literary adaptation. But the original dialogue of the novel is so good, so sharp, so illuminating of character, and so judiciously and intelligently utilized by Bernstein, that it nearly carries the day by itself.\n\nThe word, in movies, is not the world, however; acting, photography, editing and direction are of equal and intrinsic importance. Despite a minimal independent budget which precluded elaborate sets, and a concentrated effort on the part of the Pentagon to block the filmmakers from getting their hands on any stock footage of modern U.S. bombers (including from commercial sources, which had pretty obviously received pressure from the DOD… What? You thought American fascism was a new phenomenon?) the director, Sidney Lumet, achieves something very close to the book’s terror, only once giving in to hysteria, and that in an understandable lapse. I’m referring to the scene near the end in which the lead bomber pilot’s wife is brought to his base in Omaha to plead with him not to unload his two nuclear bombs over the Russian capitol. The actress in the scene, Janet Ward, is not to blame; indeed, one doffs one’s hat in her direction for baring her emotions in so naked and concentrated a fashion. The scene is the only one, aside from that in which the technical glitch that sets off the holocaust is depicted, which doesn’t come directly from the novel, but what I’m getting at is that the pleading wife is a character Burdick and Wheeler quite rightly eschewed: They knew that by the story’s climax it was far too late for such melodramatics, however heartrending. The inclusion of the wife also violates the movie’s otherwise cool, almost journalistic bird’s eye view of events. I assume the scene was Bernstein’s, and if so Lumet is equally at fault for indulging him. It’s the only moment in Fail-Safe that smacks of cliché.\n\nThen there is the matter of how the fateful mechanical failure is explicated. In the novel, it’s merely one small fuse in a grid that burns itself out while the technicians were distracted by something trivial. Even with a constricted budget it seems to me that Lumet could have re-created this moment with minimal fuss. Instead, an elaborate-looking electronic box must be replaced, the only advantage of which is that the scene introduces the character played by an almost shockingly sober Dom De Luise, who will later have a memorable dramatic moment when he must violate every instinct that has been drummed into him by his government and military masters and which nearly causes him — as it ultimately does to the troubled Air Force colonel played by the remarkable Fritz Weaver — emotional collapse. That’s a minor cavil, I suppose, yet depicting the almost incredibly mundane cause of a world nuclear crisis, and its complete lack of note by the human beings assigned to safeguard against it, would, I argue, have added a layer of terrible, unnoticed and un-remarked upon irony to the picture, as it did to the book. Was this deemed too subtle for a mass audience? And even if its inclusion by Burdick and Wheeler smacks of dollar-book Freud, the enigmatic bullfight nightmare Brigadier General “Blackie” Black (Dan O’Herlihy) dreams at the beginning of the movie is specific (strips of the bull’s hide being torn away by an unseen matador) in a way that is beyond both the live-action and animation technologies of the early 1960s to suggest, especially on a reduced budget. This renders the mysterious imagery, which in the book has a certain poetry, entirely prosaic. Worse, in his dying moments, Black is made to gasp out his sudden realization that the bull in his dream was himself. Well, thanks for overstating the bleeding obvious, fellas. That, somehow, is more horrific to him than his just having annihilated the population of New York, including his beloved wife and sons, with two 20-megaton nuclear bombs?\n\nIn most other respects Fail-Safe is a representative Sidney Lumet movie, close in spirit and technical acumen to the great black-and-white pictures which both preceded (Long Day’s Journey into Night, The Pawnbroker) and succeeded it (The Hill) and effectively acted by its largely male cast.\n\nDespite his fealty to the original novel, Walter Bernstein had of necessity to elide over some of Burdick and Wheeler’s content, or to change aspects of it to suit the very different medium of film. Two omissions in particular alter the authors’ attempts to bring their narrative into line with the realities of the world of 1962, when their book was first published. The Cuban Missile Crisis had not occurred when they were writing Fail-Safe (weirdly, McGraw-Hill brought the book out on 22 October, the exact middle of the event) but I suspect the Missiles of October were largely responsible for it becoming such an enormous bestseller.* In the Fail-Safe novel, although it was set in the future (1967), the Soviet Premier is identified by name as Nikita Khrushchev and the American President, while un-named, is described by the authors in ways that indicate he was clearly meant to be perceived by the reader as Jack Kennedy, presumably in the last years of a projected second term. (By the time of the Fail-Safe movie, of course, Kennedy had been dealt with by Allen Dulles et al.)\n\nSimilarly, the icily intellectual yet strategically demented social scientist and born-again nuclear overkill preacher Groeteschele is pretty obviously based on Herman Kahn, whose book Thinking About the Unthinkable bequeathed a lasting phrase to the American lexicon. Burdick and Wheeler go further, both mentioning Henry Kissinger and describing Groeteschele’s German-Jewish identity in a way that makes a reader who, like myself, came into puberty during the Nixon Administration perceive the character’s ideologically extreme pronouncements as the very essence of Kissingerian thinking. But Bernstein was limited by the censorship of the period (and perhaps by Lumet’s needs) and so lost a telling aspect of Groeteschele’s character. In the movie, as in the book, after pontificating on nuclear matters at a Washington party, he (Walter Matthau) is picked up by a chilling sociopath (Nancy Berg) who commands him first to drive her home, then to stop in a secluded spot where, after coolly yet breathlessly expressing her erotic arousal at the prospect of total nuclear annihilation, she expects to be made love to. In the movie, after slapping her sharply across the face and snarling, “I am not your kind,” Groeteschele does drive the deranged harpy home. In the novel he does and says precisely the same to her… and fucks her anyway. This seems as true to life, and to Groeteschele’s character, as the fact that the professor’s glacially psychotic monologue at the party takes place in the wee hours of the morning and not, as Bernstein and Lumet have it, at dawn, does not. This, in a city whose professional class residents are known to retire early is pushing the “You Are There”/single-day documentary aspect of the picture well past its breaking point.\n\nFinally, Bernstein and Lumet are forced to abandon one of the book’s finest conceits. As the negotiations go on and the President realizes too much increasingly precious time is being wasted waiting for Krushchev’s interpreter to translate into English for him, and for his own translator to in turn transmute the Premier’s Russian into English, he requests that the Soviet leader rely solely on Buck, the President’s man. This is not merely expedient; the Premier agreeing to it indicates the level of trust developing between himself and the American president. However, the only way this intelligent solution could work in the more literal terms of a motion picture would have been for Lumet to have used an American actor who spoke fluent Russian. And how many of them were floating around in 1964? (How many are now?)\n\nGroeteschele is such a philosophical monster he would be unbelievable if we didn’t know Kahn and Kissinger were every bit as appalling, and as fanatic. Take these lines of his, when it becomes obvious the bombers will make it to Moscow and the professor urges the President to use the accident as a pretense for world conquest, arguing that Russians, being essentially ideological automatons, lack the qualities of other human beings:\n\nThese are Marxist fanatics, not normal people. They do not reason the way you reason, General Black. They’re not motivated by human emotions such as rage and pity. They are calculating machines. They will look at the balance sheet, and they will see they cannot win.\n\nIf that speech is not a perfect encapsulation of the insane mutually-assured destruction “defense” policies (quite appropriately abbreviated as “MAD”) that have governed America throughout my entire time on this planet, it’s a pretty close approximation. And of course it is one that is refuted by the filmmakers, especially in the scenes involving Henry Fonda’s president and the troubled SAC commander played by the splendid Frank Overton.† In the former, Fonda and the unseen Premier come to a hard-won (if unspeakably tardy) mutual realization that their nations have failed humanity, which in the American’s case is doubly tragic, resulting in the imminent death of his wife along with everyone else in New York. With Overton’s General Bogan the revelation is simpler, if no less emotional: The discovery between himself and his Soviet counterpart that despite a harrowing body-count brought about by nationalistic distrust, each is all too heartbreakingly human, and neither can hate the other for the sin of his geographic origins.\n\nIn spite of his personal coldness, as a movie persona Henry Fonda had become by 1964 not only the great actor he (like his best friend, James Stewart) had long since proven himself to be but in addition a figure of warmth and rectitude who could probably, had he so chosen, have been elected president. I don’t mean to suggest Fonda was nothing but a symbol — he was still an actor of great ability, and remained so to the end — merely that no one, seeing this movie when it was new, would have balked at Mister Roberts going to Washington. (Although he proved too good a man for the office in the splendid movie of Gore Vidal’s play The Best Man the same year.) His performance in Fail-Safe is very nearly, save for some pointed lines spoken to and with his Russian interpreter, a sustained monologue, like Peter Sellers’ conversation with the unseen (and unheard) Premier Kissoff in Dr. Strangelove but without the gallows laughter. The emotional cost of the bargain he makes with the Russian, never articulated, is staggering, and Fonda expresses the nearly unendurable psychic pain the president is experiencing without special pleading. That restraint makes it all the more moving.\n\nO’Herlihy too is affecting as a career soldier with deep misgivings about the madness piling up around him, and Matthau, on the cusp of stardom as Oscar Madison in The Odd Couple on Broadway and as “Whiplash Willie” for Billy Wilder in The Fortune Cookie, gives Groeteschele the frightening aspect of the True Believer who has so thoroughly fallen under the spell of his own convictions he can no longer admit to anyone else’s perspective having the least merit; for him, mass-extinction is a small price to pay if it proves his theses to his own satisfaction. William Hansen, familiar to lovers of 1776 as Caesar Rodney, gives a fine account of the Defense Secretary, and in the smaller roles Edward Binns, Russell Collins, Sorrell Booke, Hildy Parks and Frieda Altman are equally memorable. Best among the supporting cast, however, are Weaver and Larry Hagman. The former, one of our finest actors, his career largely confined to the stage, does small marvels as a young colonel who, already under personal stress from his brawling alcoholic parents and further distressed by the exceptional events which force collaboration between international enemies against all his prior training and indoctrination, cracks completely. There’s a scene between him and Frank Overton, who has just seen the people Weaver sprang from, in which neither can acknowledge the embarrassment each feels at this glimpse of private Hell that is wonderfully acted and directed, and the Colonel’s emotional and intellectual collapse is a precise, harrowing performance by Weaver in which what is unspoken is more powerful than what may be shouted. As Buck, the President’s interpreter, Hagman gives a performance that is so good it (and his subsequent appearance for Lumet in The Group) ought, had the weekly success of I Dream of Jeannie not intervened, have marked him as one of our most promising young dramatic actors. The way Hagman performs the interpretations, hesitating between the Premier’s silences and his words and phrases, contributes enormously to the documentary quality of the picture.\n\nGerald Hirschfeld’s black-and-white cinematography seems exactly right, for the material and for Lumet’s approach to it, capturing the tension of the events and emphasizing the photographic realism the filmmakers were working toward. There are more close-ups in Fail-Safe than was the norm for Lumet, which I suspect was only partly to do with his operating on a limited budget; the more urgent prerequisite seems to have been the story, and its effects on the people involved. It’s impossible to shoot a jet pilot effectively without getting in close, especially when for much of the picture his breathing apparatus obscures most of his face, leaving only the eyes for expression. John and Faith Hubley, animators who were among the founding members of UPA in the ’40s, were responsible for designing and animating the “Big Board” on which the off-screen action of the various fighter-planes and bombers is represented and it’s a tribute to the simplicity of their designs, and their skill in doing much with little, that what might have been seen as a budget liability became a positive asset; the Board dominates your memory of the picture, just as it physically dominates the available space. Ralph Rosenblum’s taut editing too contributes to the strong impact Fail-Safe still makes today. His and Lumet’s selection of a dozen images of New York, and their rapid freeze-frames of them, are as memorable, and as agonizing, as they are, in their insignificant significance, terrible. I first saw the picture on television 40 years ago, and those images have been with me since.\n\nFail-Safe was produced independently, and should have been in theatres months before Dr. Strangelove opened. Lumet always maintained that had his movie opened first, both it and the Kubrick picture might have been hits but that coming after, his own was predictably dead in the water. Alas, Peter George, who wrote the novel (Red Alert) on which Strangelove was based, and who was credited with Stanley Kubrick and Terry Southern on the screenplay, sued Lumet & Co. for copyright infringement. I wonder who put him up to it. Kubrick, I assume, since his name was also on the suit. It’s a question worth asking because, with Burdick and Wheeler’s novel a long-standing bestseller, George could have sued them for plagiarism, and did not; he (and Kubrick) waited until the movie based on the Fail-Safe novel was about to begin shooting. While it is possible that Burdick and Wheeler knew of George’s novel, it’s a) rather unlikely and b) a spurious claim on George’s behalf. I once saw an old 1958 Ace paperback of Red Alert, the volume in question, in a second-hand bookshop when I was a teenager, and it was obvious from my perusing of the cover that it was an obscure title in a cheap edition from a minor mass-market publishing house, most of whose original print-run was probably pulped six months after it hit the newsstands, at least in the United States. (George was Welsh and the hardcover, titled Two Hours to Doom, was published in the U.K. by Boardman… hardly a household name in America. Nor did it receive a hardbound printing here.) So much for “a.” As for “b,” it is hubris bordering on psychotic narcissism to maintain that you alone of the millions of people on the planet during the 1950s and early ’60s imagined a scenario in which a nuclear holocaust was brought about by either human or mechanical error. Besides, the precipitating act in Fail-Safe is the failure of a small computer component — an accident — while in Strangelove (and Red Alert) it’s the deliberate, paranoid act of a Curtis LeMay-type military madman. It is true that, in the George book, an American city is offered up in payment by the president for the potential bombing of Russia, but it’s Atlantic City, not New York. George might have had some grounds there against Burdick and Wheeler but otherwise, the scenarios in the two books, whatever their surface similarities, could not be further apart.\n\nMoreover, it’s telling that even when Ace, reprinting George’s novel in the ’60s, before Strangelove was released, made specific reference in their front-cover copy to the then-bestselling Fail-Safe, still their author did not sue Burdick and Wheeler. The lawsuit was pretty obviously a ploy to eliminate competition for Dr. Strangelove at the box-office, especially since Kubrick owned “the creative rights” to George’s novel. (Perhaps Ace’s phrase “the original” was meant to bolster the suit’s chances?) As a result of the out-of-court settlement, Columbia Pictures acquired Fail-Safe and was free to release it however it liked. And since the studio also financed and distributed Strangelove… Columbia, giving Fail-Safe a perfunctory release months after Kubrick’s comedy hit the screen, condemned it to oblivion. I’m not claiming Lumet’s picture is as great or as memorable as Strangelove. It isn’t, not least because, as horrific as the events Kubrick, George and Southern illuminate, their picture — while admittedly scoring off points similar to those Bernstein and Lumet made with a grim replication of reality — is also screamingly funny.‡\n\nBernstein, Lumet and Max Youngstein, who produced Fail-Safe, at least deserved a decent chance for their movie to be seen. They didn’t even get that much. But Peter George was, it is said, unhappy with the comedic/satirical thrust of Dr. Strangelove. Which makes him, I suppose, one of the sorest winners in movie history.\n\n*The book’s three-issue serialization in The Saturday Evening Post even more eerily brackets the Cuban Crisis: The magazine’s cover dates (13, 20 and 27 October) fit squarely within those of the Crisis (16 – 28 October). Burdick and Wheeler were hardly the first novelists to imagine a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, but the coincidence is a little unnerving.\n\n†Overton’s weary face and unforgettable vocal timbre are likewise indelible in his role as the essentially decent sheriff Tate in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).\n\n‡Interestingly, Peter George’s later novelization of Strangelove for Bantam bears the title “Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove,” with Kubrick’s name in a font several times larger than the author’s.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Ipcress File (1965) It was probably impossible, in a standard narrative movie of the period, to adequately film Len Deighton’s first novel featuring his literally anonymous MI6 agent, so the people involved in making this one didn’t bother. Some of the threads of Deighton’s book remain, including the capture and attempted brainwashing of the agent, called “Harry Palmer” in the three movies in which Michael Caine appeared, although even the contours of that event have been altered. (The filmmakers were also at rather extreme pains to have Palmer assert his heterosexuality lest his eyeglasses and penchant for >gasp!< cooking unnerve wary ticket buyers.) The long middle section of the novel, set on an island military enclave preparing for a missile test, was jettisoned but the central question of identifying the enemy agent remained. The brainwashing techniques are less physically brutal than in the book and more techno-psychological, with the viewer being made to wonder how, if those weird lights, images and sounds assailing Palmer are supposed to be altering his mind the people, seemingly unprotected in any way, who are inflicting them are spared the effects.\n\nI may be seeming to suggest The Ipcress File is a bad movie. It isn’t. In fact, it’s a rather good one. It’s simply not as good, or as satisfying, as Deighton’s novel. There is something to be said for fealty to the source material when adapting good books, although the producer, Harry Saltzman, and his partner “Cubby” Broccoli were at the time routinely going further and further away from the Ian Fleming novels on which their wildly popular James Bond franchise movies were ostensibly based, so perhaps he didn’t think it mattered. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that on the first day of filming the director, Sidney J. Furie, contemptuously tore up the screenplay in front of the cast and crew; he was then forced, sheepishly, to ask for someone to lend him a copy so filming could commence. Naturally, the auteurists swoon over his work. Again, I’m not knocking Furie’s direction of The Ipcress File, merely his arrogance. The picture has an unprepossessing look, achieved in part by the use of Techniscope, which gave the filmmakers fewer visual options but allowed for greater depth of field.\n\nSaltzman deserves real credit for taking a chance on the little-known Michael Caine, and the movie’s success established the young actor as a rising movie star. He’s splendid as Palmer; his underplaying perfectly captures the unnamed character of the Deighton novel in his cynical lack of ideological zeal. (As with John le Carré, the British spymasters in Deighton’s books have no particular anti-Soviet axes to grind; the leave that to their American cousins.) The excellent supporting cast includes Guy Doleman and Nigel Green as Palmer’s superiors and Gordon Jackson as a jovial Scots agent. The score by the Bond composer John Barry, emphasizing the cimbalom, essentially consists of a single theme and variations, and you can only carry that off when theme is a damn good one. Barry’s is.. The James Bond connection is maintained as well by the effective editing by Peter H. Hunt. The somewhat jumbled script was by Bill Canaway and James Doran with an un-credited “polish” by Jimmy Sangster, who allegedly was responsible for removing the novel’s ambiguity.\n\nThe Glass Bottomed Boat (1966) Occasionally when I was between the ages of eight and twelve and in my early phase of movie-love, the entire family would sit down to watch the television network premiere of a picture, usually one our parents had seen when it was new in the 1960s. This was one of them. Although we had been taken to the Doris Day/Brian Keith “family” comedy With Six You Get Eggroll in 1968, I knew Day best from her weirdly malleable television series and from the recording of “Que Sera Sera” in the collection of my mother’s EPs and 45s which she gave when I was seven and which I played incessantly, learning early the orphic glories of Frank Sinatra, Nelson Riddle and Nat “King” Cole. Being a child, I liked Day very much, and liked her especially in The Glass Bottom Boat. The biggest surprise to me in seeing this agreeable Frank Tashlin-directed space-age farce again for the first time in 50 years is that I still do.\n\nI know all the arguments against her: That she played the perpetual virgin, that she was puerile and aggressively wholesome, that her sunny optimism was at odds with realities of the national mood — or, indeed, anything human — that she supposedly had all the sex appeal of the faithful family dog, and that her comedies were mostly un-funny. (Some of her harsher critics even maintained, foolishly, that she was a mediocre singer.) Many of her pictures, particularly the later ones, are admittedly bad. But even insufficient fluff like Pillow Talk, The Thrill of it All, Move Over Darling and Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? have their moments. And if she could be shrill, particularly when her characters were outraged, or overwrought when they were in peril, as in the thrillers The Man Who Knew Too Much and Midnight Lace (in both of which she is otherwise quite good) she also projected an intelligence, a comic presence and an enviable gift for timing that are very appealing in screen comedy. And at least since she’s playing a widow there’s no virginity to guard in The Glass Bottom Boat, and no adorable kids to trigger your gag reflex. There is in fact no sentimentality in the picture, which I attribute both to Everett Freeman’s mildly satirical screenplay and to Tashlin’s live-action cartoon direction.\n\nSome of the comic set-pieces are labored, some too broad and the gags are occasionally more obvious than clever. But what works, works exceptionally well, and that includes the sparkling supporting cast: John McGiver, Edward Andrews, Dick Martin, Ellen Corby, Alice Pearce, George Tobias, Arthur Godfrey and Paul Lynde, who even gets a drag sequence… and God, what an ugly woman he makes! Rod Taylor, always likable, is the rocketship designer who sets his cap for Doris, Eric Fleming the meany posing as a government agent and Dom DeLuise, who is annoying in larger roles, has just the right sized one here. (Robert Vaughan also has a gag cameo at a party.) While the back-projection in a few scenes is poor, Leon Shamroy’s widescreen color photography is otherwise glorious. There are also a pair of charming musical sequences. In the first, Day and Godfrey perform a duet of the deliberately silly title song, whose melody is taken from Day’s recording of “Soft as the Starlight,” written by Joe Lubin and Jerome Howard (itself based on “Hush, Little Baby”); it feels entirely spontaneous, with Doris fluffing some of the lyrics as if she’s trying to remember a song learned from her father in childhood and which she hasn’t sung in years. The second is “Soft as the Starlight” itself, which she sings beguilingly while snuffing the candles on her father’s Catalina porch and which Tashlin films in a single, long take (at least until the end when he’s forced to make a cut due to the overhead beams.) It’s a lovely respite from the picture’s sometimes frenetic comedy — a breather, like the songs in Roman comedies.\n\nThe Love Bug (1969) This, and the “Dexter Reilly” series starring Kurt Russell, were the apogee of a certain type of comedy associated with the Walt Disney studios. Beginning with The Shaggy Dog in 1959 and running through the 1960s and into the ’70s, these were broad farces, often with science-fiction style special effects or supernatural elements, frequently written either by Bill Walsh or (as this one was) by Walsh and Don DaGradi. The gimmicks occasionally overwhelmed the humor, but in the cleverly-titled The Love Bug the elements are perfectly balanced. It was a movie I loved at eight, and which inspired in me an enduring ardor for the classic 1960s Volkswagen Beetle, an enthusiasm my father, knowing his car engines, did his best to dampen. (Of course, Dad didn’t apply that caution to himself, as his folly in falling in love with the 1970 Sunbeam Alpine attested.)\n\nI wouldn’t have known what it meant at the time, but I’m pretty sure my affection for the movie was related, at least in part, to a pre-pubescent crush on “Herbie”‘s driver: Dean Jones, a perennial presence in my childish Disney universe, dealing, in various shades of charm and frustration, with monkeys, great Danes, racehorses and the ghosts of pirates, his conviction as much as his good looks turning him into an ideal figure on whom to fasten my unfocused devotion. (You can imagine how much that fondness deepened in me when, at 15, I discovered the original cast album of Company and heard the extent of Jones’ vocal range. Has anyone since sung “Being Alive” as powerfully and yet with as much vulnerability as he did?) I don’t think Jones gets nearly the credit he deserves as an actor, probably because of the many Disney movies in which he appeared. He has, for example, a scene in the otherwise horribly misguided adaptation of Jerry Sterner’s wonderful play Other People’s Money that in its quietly guilt-racked way is one of the finest pieces of acting I’ve ever seen, and I seem to be almost alone in having seen it. That sense of conviction I mentioned is his acting bedrock. If you wish to sell a fantasy, or a far-fetched narrative of any kind, you’d better have stars who can convey belief or you’re just slumming and the audience will know it. Good screenwriting helps, of course; the pivotal moment when Jones’ likeable but undistinguished race-car driver realizes the extent of sentient feeling that exists in the little VW and goes chasing after him through the San Francisco fog sells the rest of the picture. We can believe in Herbie because Jones does.\n\nExcept for a rather ugly little throwaway joke involving a pair of overage hippies, one of whom calls the other “Guinevere,” the picture is the most amiable family comedy imaginable, and the tricks are so well done you seldom see the joins. (A sight-gag involving David Tomlinson and a black bear was pretty obviously done in part with an animatronic bruin, but it’s funny enough you don’t mind its slight air of artificiality.) Walsh and DaGradi keep things humming with well-defined comic characters, the director, Robert Stevenson, frames the comic set-pieces efficiently, and a terrific cast of comedians does the rest. Aside from Tomlinson, either smilingly unctuous or barking with irrationally self-serving rage, this includes the chipper Michelle Lee as the young woman with whom Jones meets-cute and with whom he bickers before the inevitable clinch; Buddy Hackett as the overage flower-child Tennessee Steinmetz whose lightly and absurdly philosophical bent is a tonic; Joe Flynn as Tomlinson’s toadying associate; Benson Fong as a savvy Chinese entrepreneur; Joe E. Ross as a smiling detective; Iris Adrian as a cranky car-hop (ask your mother); and Ned Glass as an exasperated toll-booth attendant. (Gary Owens, familiar to television viewers of the time from “Laugh-In,” also shows up as a race commentator.) The drivers and stunt men, one of whom was Bill Hicks, received a special credit in the main titles, and with good reason. And the score by George Bruns adds exactly the right touch, especially in the quirky, sunny little waltz theme he composed for Herbie. It’s the essence of the little car summed up in purely musical terms and it makes me smile every time I hear it.\n\nIt’s a rare and enchanting thing to re-encounter something which gave you special pleasure in childhood and that you find you’re not ashamed to bump into again years later.\n\n“They make ten thousand cars. They make them exactly the same way. And one or two of them turn out to be something special. Nobody knows why.” — Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) in The Love Bug\n\nZelig (1983) Technically, Zelig is Woody Allen’s most accomplished movie. But as he rightly pointed out when his cinematographer, the great Gordon Willis, got the first of his only two Academy Awards nomination for it, it’s a trick movie, not one of Willis’ demonstrable masterpieces of lighting like The Godfather, All the President’s Men or Manhattan. Still, it’s at least trick photography in support of something: A simultaneously funny and troubling faux documentary about a nebbish so devoid of a personality he assumes the characteristics of any man around him — a person Bruno Bettleheim, interviewed about him onscreen, describes as “the ultimate conformist.”\n\nSome reviewers in 1983 thought that in his use of interviewees Allen was taking off from Warren Beatty’s “Witnesses” in Reds, and I wondered at the time if they’d ever seen a documentary before. Talking heads are de rigeur in these things, especially on television, and Zelig has the flavor of a vintage BBC program. Besides, Beatty’s interviewees were all there. They’d lived through the first World War and the Russian Revolution. Allen’s interview subjects are mostly writers (Susan Sontag, Saul Bellow), historians (Irving Howe), academics and psychiatrists (Bettelheim) commenting on an historical phenomenon older than themselves. (The exceptions are people like the Parisian nightclub owner Bricktop, there to give a whiff of verisimilitude to the movie.) They go with the doctored 1920s and ’30s footage in which, well before Forrest Gump, the filmmaker places his fictional protagonist among contemporary figures from Babe Ruth to Adolph Hitler.\n\nThe absurdist vein of some of the picture’s narration sounds a little too like the jokes in Allen’s New Yorker pieces and his early movies for comfort; they’re the least successful things in those projects, and we’d thought by 1983 he’d outgrown them. I also don’t buy Mia Farrow as a psychiatrist, perhaps because she needs one of her own too badly. Eric Lundegaard in his 2011 review feels that Leonard Zelig shouldn’t have spoken because hearing Woody Allen’s voice ruins the idea of the “chameleon man,” and while I’m sympathetic I would argue that seeing Allen as Zelig is a spoiler as well. Full success of the gimmick would have involved an actor almost no one had ever seen or heard before. In any case, Allen is more subdued here than usual, hence less obnoxious, and his gift for physical comedy is best represented by the hilarious moment in which he gets into a shoving match with an aged psychiatrist, all the funnier for being shown in the distance so that when it begins we’re not quite sure what we’re seeing.\n\nThe best things in the movie, aside from Allen’s imaginative use of physical types for Zelig to morph into (including, in a photograph, the famous portrait of Caruso in Pagliacchio) are Willis’ work and the music. Dick Hyman not only arranged, in his (as they used to say) inimitable style, a program of period songs, but wrote several pastiche numbers of his own: “Leonard the Lizard,” “Doin’ the Chameleon,” “You May Be Six People, But I Love You,” “Reptile Eyes” (performed by Rose Marie Jun) and even some snippets of a “Changing Man Concerto.” The musical highlight, however, is the delicious “Chameleon Days,” performed, so we are told, by Helen Kane but actually by Mae Questel. Since Kane famously sued the Max Fleischer Studios over Betty Boop, for whom Questel provided the voice, this can legitimately be cited as irony.\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) A charming compilation of three Disney featurettes from the work of A.A. Milne: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968) and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too (1974).\n\nQ & A (1990) Sidney Lumet, acting as both writer and director, delivers a tough, visceral account of the equally striking novel by Edwin Torres, featuring a frightening performance by Nick Nolte as a psychopathic New York City cop.\n\nWill Penny (1967) The writer/director Tom Gries’ character study of an ageing cowboy is one of the few genuinely adult Westerns made in America, and one of the most satisfying.\n\nThe Odd Couple (1968) The funniest American play of the post-war era in its equally hilarious movie adaptation.\n\nThe Professionals (1966) Richard Brooks’ enormously engaging latter-day Western from the delicious Frank Rourke novel. It may not speak to the human condition the way Will Penny does, but it’s still one of the most entertaining movies of its era, and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross"
