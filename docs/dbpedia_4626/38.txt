When Božo Koprivica writes about soccer, he does it in the manner of a great poet, or a great prose writer, or even as someone would write about aesthetics or theory... This conundrum regarding the genre of his book, in his own words, is a consequence of a terrible laziness... He is an amalgam of a great poet and an old-school soccer fan.

Myth and cruel reality, winning and losing, a team and an individual, joy and sorrow, dream and awakening... these oppositions can be united only by a mind that sees art where nobody else sees it, and by a hand that knows how to describe everything indescribable and hitherto undescribed. Reading the book Only the Gods Can Make Promises opens an entirely new horizon in which literature and soccer, similar to a canoe double calmly peddling along a never-ending river, touch the shores of Loneliness, Solitude and Desolation.
