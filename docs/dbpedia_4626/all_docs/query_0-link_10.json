The case number IT-97-25-T, the\n\n8 Prosecutor versus Krnojelac.\n\n9 JUDGE HUNT: Witness, would you please take the solemn\n\n10 declaration.\n\n11 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I solemnly declare that I will speak\n\n12 the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Sit down, please, sir.\n\n14 WITNESS: WITNESS FWS-54\n\n15 [Witness answered through interpreter]\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: Your witness, Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff.\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: But before I start, I would introduce to my\n\n18 left Ms. Diane Dicklich, who will take over the case manager function from\n\n19 Ms. Butler.\n\n20 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you.\n\n21 Examined by Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff:\n\n22 Q. Good morning, Witness.\n\n23 A. Good morning.\n\n24 Q. Witness, you have in front of you a piece of paper and on this\n\n25 piece of paper you have there the number 54, and that is the number you\n\nPage 724\n\n1 are referred to in these proceedings.\n\n2 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I think everybody else in the courtroom has\n\n3 this sheet.\n\n4 Q. Witness, the name under this number, is that your name?\n\n5 A. Yes.\n\n6 Q. And the date under this name, is it your birth date?\n\n7 A. Yes.\n\n8 Q. And there are also two other names under your birth date, and if\n\n9 you, in these proceedings, like to refer to these people, just do not tell\n\n10 us the name but the numbers.\n\n11 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, the Prosecution would like to\n\n12 enter this sheet of paper as a new exhibit.\n\n13 JUDGE HUNT: Any objection, Mr. Bakrac?\n\n14 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] No, Your Honour.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: It will be Exhibit P398 and it will be under seal.\n\n16 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n17 Q. Witness, where were you born?\n\n18 A. I was born in a village near Foca.\n\n19 Q. And what is your ethnicity?\n\n20 A. Muslim.\n\n21 Q. Are you married?\n\n22 A. Yes.\n\n23 Q. And do you have children?\n\n24 A. I do, two.\n\n25 Q. Where did you live before the war?\n\nPage 725\n\n1 A. In Foca.\n\n2 Q. And in which neighbourhood did you live in Foca?\n\n3 A. The neighbourhood of Donje Polje.\n\n4 Q. Was this a Muslim neighbourhood?\n\n5 A. Well, the majority population was Muslim, but it was not\n\n6 ethnically pure.\n\n7 Q. What was your profession before the war?\n\n8 A. Worker. Actually, I am a skilled worker by profession, but I was\n\n9 in charge of a shift in a factory.\n\n10 Q. When did the war start in Foca?\n\n11 A. Well, as far as the date of the beginning of the war in Foca is\n\n12 concerned, we could talk about that a lot. However, I experienced my\n\n13 first shelling on the morning of the 6th of April, around 10.00 or 11.00.\n\n14 Q. And where were you when that happened?\n\n15 A. In the apartment. In my apartment where I lived.\n\n16 Q. Was it an apartment block or was it a small building you lived\n\n17 in?\n\n18 A. An apartment block with some 29 apartments.\n\n19 Q. And the people living in this apartment block, were they\n\n20 ethnically mixed?\n\n21 A. Yes.\n\n22 Q. What did you do when the fighting started? Where did you go?\n\n23 A. The basement, with all the other neighbours.\n\n24 Q. The people in the basement, what ethnicity did they have?\n\n25 A. Well, they belonged to different ethnic groups, but there were far\n\nPage 726\n\n1 more Muslims.\n\n2 Q. How many Serbs were among the people in the basement?\n\n3 A. Three or four persons.\n\n4 Q. Why so few?\n\n5 A. I don't know why so few. I really don't know the right answer to\n\n6 that. However, I imagine that knowing what would happen, they went away\n\n7 during the weekend. They went to stay with some relatives. They sent\n\n8 their families away.\n\n9 Q. Does that mean actually there were more people living in the --\n\n10 more Serb people living in the apartment block but they were gone when the\n\n11 war started?\n\n12 A. Well, yes. A lot of attention was paid to that before, that\n\n13 buildings should not be ethnically pure.\n\n14 Q. What do you mean by this?\n\n15 A. I mean the former Yugoslavia was well known for tensions that\n\n16 existed in the Second World War. Later on, the government paid attention\n\n17 that all ethnic groups be represented at all levels.\n\n18 Q. Thank you. Which part of the town was shelled? Was it all over\n\n19 the town the shelling or in particular parts? Could you see that?\n\n20 A. I know that all of Donje Polje was shelled. I cannot say what\n\n21 happened up there in town.\n\n22 Q. Were houses destroyed during the initial fighting?\n\n23 A. Yes. Yes, destroyed.\n\n24 Q. Were Serb houses among those destroyed?\n\n25 A. I didn't see any. There weren't any private Serb homes in that\n\nPage 727\n\n1 neighbourhood. Perhaps about ten in that part of the neighbourhood that I\n\n2 lived in.\n\n3 Q. Do you know if the house of the accused Krnojelac was destroyed at\n\n4 that time?\n\n5 A. I don't know. I know something that will be seen later. I know\n\n6 that some camp inmates went to repair the house of the mentioned person.\n\n7 Q. How long did the fighting last?\n\n8 A. Well, seven or eight days. I don't know exactly. I think it was\n\n9 from the 6th until the 14th or 15th of April, something like that, in\n\n10 1992.\n\n11 Q. Did the Muslims withdraw from Foca or flee from Foca at a point in\n\n12 time?\n\n13 A. A lot of people did. During the night, they went to Gorazde.\n\n14 Some remained, myself included.\n\n15 Q. After the Muslims had fled, did this take an end to the shelling\n\n16 or did it, nevertheless, continue?\n\n17 A. No. No. That was not an end to the shelling. On the contrary.\n\n18 The shelling was with some kind of inflammable shells. The shooting went\n\n19 on. So whatever was not destroyed at first was totally destroyed and\n\n20 burned down then.\n\n21 Q. When was that, this particular kind of shells?\n\n22 A. 14th, 15th, 16th of April, 1992.\n\n23 Q. Can you tell us what happened to the houses in Donje Polje\n\n24 neighbourhood in general?\n\n25 A. January?\n\nPage 728\n\n1 Q. Generally.\n\n2 A. I have no idea.\n\n3 Q. That was obviously a mistake in the interpretation. In general, I\n\n4 said, to the whole of the Muslim houses of Donje Polje.\n\n5 A. Well, what was not destroyed by the shelling was burned down\n\n6 later.\n\n7 Q. And how do you know that?\n\n8 A. I know that because I saw it. I could see it from my terrace.\n\n9 I'm talking about the part of the neighbourhood that I lived in.\n\n10 Q. What about the other Muslim neighbourhoods? Did you see what\n\n11 happened to these?\n\n12 A. No. I didn't even move about there.\n\n13 Q. What happened to the mosques? Do you know?\n\n14 A. I know only about two mosques for sure. I saw that they were no\n\n15 longer there. One is near the former kindergarten and the other one is\n\n16 near the former bus station. I don't know whether it's still a bus\n\n17 station.\n\n18 Q. When did you see these mosques being destroyed?\n\n19 A. I did not see these mosques being destroyed; I was in the KP Dom\n\n20 camp. However, when we travelled by bus, on the 30th of August, 1992, I\n\n21 saw this. These two mosques no longer existed; it was just empty.\n\n22 Q. You mentioned that many Muslims fled to Gorazde but you were among\n\n23 those who stayed. Did you stay in Donje Polje or did you go somewhere\n\n24 else within Foca?\n\n25 A. I stayed in Donje Polje for one night after that together with my\n\nPage 729\n\n1 neighbour - I don't know whether I should mention his name or not; he's a\n\n2 Serb - and then I went to a different part of the town of Foca.\n\n3 Q. Which part?\n\n4 A. Cohodar Mahala.\n\n5 Q. Is this a Muslim neighbourhood or a mixed neighbourhood?\n\n6 A. A mixed neighbourhood.\n\n7 Q. And why did you go there?\n\n8 A. My daughter lived there. We talked on the phone, and she told me\n\n9 the situation was much better there and that I would be much safer there.\n\n10 (redacted) and went to live there.\n\n11 Q. You mentioned that you were in KP Dom. When were you arrested?\n\n12 A. On the 16th of August -- oh, what am I saying? Sorry. On the\n\n13 16th of April, in Cohodar Mahala, that neighbourhood that I already\n\n14 mentioned.\n\n15 Q. What time of the day were you arrested; do you recall?\n\n16 A. Well, I think it was just before noon.\n\n17 Q. You said you were arrested in this Cohodar Mahala neighbourhood.\n\n18 In your daughter's home or where? Where?\n\n19 A. Yes, yes, I was taken out of the house, myself, her husband, and\n\n20 his uncle.\n\n21 Q. Who arrested you?\n\n22 A. Persons unknown to me.\n\n23 Q. Were they policemen or soldiers or civilian persons?\n\n24 A. They had some kind of olive-green/grey uniform that belonged to\n\n25 the JNA, that I used to wear before. They were in camouflage uniforms.\n\nPage 730\n\n1 Nobody wore civilian clothes or a police uniform.\n\n2 Q. You said you did not know them. Does that mean they were not from\n\n3 Foca?\n\n4 A. Those who arrested us were not from Foca for sure. However, I'm\n\n5 not claiming that I have to know all the people from the territory of the\n\n6 municipality of Foca, which is very big from a human and geographical\n\n7 point of view.\n\n8 Q. Did the soldiers tell you why you were arrested and what was going\n\n9 to happen?\n\n10 A. Well, my wife and daughter started to wail and they asked what\n\n11 would happen to us, and then they said they would return us after we make\n\n12 statements. And about 150 metres away, in the yard, there were already\n\n13 people gathered there and there were more and more people coming, and I\n\n14 saw, recognised, two men I knew. That was Ranko Pijano -- Ranko Pijano\n\n15 and Puko Mitrasinovic, Goran Mitrasinovic, called Puko.\n\n16 Q. Who were they?\n\n17 A. Goran Mitrasinovic was a worker, as far as I know. Perhaps he\n\n18 went to work elsewhere afterwards; he worked in Sipad Maglic before.\n\n19 Ranko Pijano was a lawyer in the former Focatrans, and then when the firm\n\n20 split up, then he was in the Viner firm and he worked in some of the\n\n21 services there. He was some kind of secretary or something. I don't\n\n22 know.\n\n23 Q. And when you saw them, were they also in uniform? And if so,\n\n24 which uniform?\n\n25 A. Yes, yes. SMB, olive-green/grey, military uniforms.\n\nPage 731\n\n1 Q. Did you ever find out what the charges against you were and why\n\n2 you were arrested?\n\n3 A. No, no, I never found out. I was not accused and I did not stand\n\n4 trial, ever.\n\n5 Q. You mentioned other people being gathered already in a yard. How\n\n6 many people were gathered?\n\n7 A. When I arrived, perhaps 50 people or even more; but finally, when\n\n8 they took us to the KP Dom, I think there were almost 200 people. Perhaps\n\n9 a bit more; perhaps a bit less. But you have to understand the situation\n\n10 as it was. Nobody counted them.\n\n11 Q. And were only male people being gathered there?\n\n12 A. Men.\n\n13 Q. And did you know what ethnicity these people had?\n\n14 A. Muslims.\n\n15 Q. All of them?\n\n16 A. All.\n\n17 Q. And what ages did these people have, between the youngest and the\n\n18 oldest?\n\n19 A. Well, from the age of 16 or 17 up to 80. How could I know? My\n\n20 son-in-law's uncle was 75, for example.\n\n21 Q. Did you have a weapon before the war or during the war?\n\n22 A. No, no, I never had any weapons.\n\n23 Q. Did you take part in the fighting in any way?\n\n24 A. No, never.\n\n25 Q. And of those people you knew among those gathered there in the\n\nPage 732\n\n1 yard, can you say if they were civilians, or were there fighters among\n\n2 you?\n\n3 A. Civilians. Civilians only.\n\n4 Q. Was there anything particular about you and these other men that\n\n5 you had in common that might have been a reason for the arrest?\n\n6 A. Well, probably the reason was because they were Muslims. I don't\n\n7 know what other reason there could be.\n\n8 Q. On this day when you were arrested, were you mistreated by the\n\n9 soldiers present?\n\n10 A. Not at that place, at least I did not notice over there at that\n\n11 place, as we were waiting for the buses to take us to the camp. However,\n\n12 in the camp, as we were entering the compound, we went in through the gate\n\n13 where the furniture was being taken out. Usually, we were beaten up a bit\n\n14 as we were getting out of the bus.\n\n15 Q. So you were taken there in a bus or several buses?\n\n16 A. There were two buses; one belonged to the National Park of\n\n17 Sutjeska and the other one to the Focatrans work organisation.\n\n18 Q. Did the buses drive into the KP Dom compound, or did you leave the\n\n19 buses in front of the building?\n\n20 A. Yes, they entered the compound of the KP Dom. I said a few\n\n21 minutes ago that this was at the gate which was a big gate, a sliding door\n\n22 as well, and I think that the furniture used to be taken out through\n\n23 there.\n\n24 Q. You mentioned that you were all beaten when you left the buses.\n\n25 Who beat you?\n\nPage 733\n\n1 A. In my opinion, those were persons from Serbia for the most part,\n\n2 because they spoke with the accent that people from there use. I didn't\n\n3 know anyone personally.\n\n4 Q. Those who beat, were they all soldiers, or did you see any regular\n\n5 guards present?\n\n6 A. No, no, at that time I did not see any guards, and I knew most of\n\n7 them.\n\n8 Q. Where were you taken within the KP Dom?\n\n9 A. Room 11.\n\n10 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n11 show the witness now Exhibit 18, photo 7512. This is the photo.\n\n12 Q. Witness, please look at the photo and please tell us if you can\n\n13 see --\n\n14 A. I see this.\n\n15 Q. And can you show us the Room number 11 on this photo? Is it in\n\n16 building number 1 or building number 2?\n\n17 A. The building marked number 1. But here, on this photograph, you\n\n18 can hardly see. It is mainly these windows there facing the garden, a bit\n\n19 further down here, yes. And then there are windows down here, facing\n\n20 administrative building.\n\n21 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is pointing at the building with\n\n22 the number 1 on top of it and it's actually the building we refer to\n\n23 as A.\n\n24 Q. Witness, for the rest of your testimony, please have in mind that\n\n25 for us it is building A. And the witness is pointing at the ground floor\n\nPage 734\n\n1 of this building.\n\n2 Witness, did you always stay in this Room 11 or were you\n\n3 transferred to another room at one point in time?\n\n4 A. I was in Room number 20 very briefly, for about three days, and\n\n5 then for three or four days in solitary confinement.\n\n6 Q. Can you show us the Room number 20 on this photo?\n\n7 A. [Indicates]\n\n8 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is also pointing to the second\n\n9 floor. To make it clear, the second floor also from the top, seen from\n\n10 the top.\n\n11 Q. Witness, while you were in Room number 20, could you see the Drina\n\n12 River and the bridge over the Drina in front of KP Dom?\n\n13 A. I think you can see it, although I did not look much at the time.\n\n14 I was given work assignments, and I was very tired, and I spent only three\n\n15 days there. I didn't look.\n\n16 Q. Yes. Thank you.\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n18 show the witness now the photo 7476.\n\n19 Q. Can you look at this photo? You can see the arrows on the photo.\n\n20 What room are they pointing at.\n\n21 A. Excuse me. Yes, you can. May I begin to answer?\n\n22 Q. Yes, please.\n\n23 A. These arrows are pointing for windows. The two to the right\n\n24 are -- belong to one dormitory and the other two to the other room --\n\n25 dormitory in Room 11, and below that is the storage space.\n\nPage 735\n\n1 Q. The storage space, did you ever look into it? Was it full or was\n\n2 it empty?\n\n3 A. While I was in the camp?\n\n4 Q. Yes.\n\n5 A. No. No. No. I had no access there.\n\n6 Q. And now I would like to show you another photo, and it's the photo\n\n7 7483. It's the top photo.\n\n8 You can see a door, and it's a little bit hard to see, but on the\n\n9 original you can see that there is a number 11 on the door. Did the\n\n10 door --\n\n11 A. I guess so, because all the rooms have such doors, identical\n\n12 doors. There is nothing to tell me whether this is a door to Room 11 or\n\n13 not. I think that on the opposite side, the door to Room 12 is the same.\n\n14 I can't see the number here. I cannot see the number. It doesn't help\n\n15 that you zoomed it in. I cannot see the number really. So it could be.\n\n16 Q. Thank you. And yet I would like to show you a floor plan that was\n\n17 made by a witness before you, and I would like to show you the floor plan\n\n18 6/2. Please have a look at the prisoners' building. Can you tell us\n\n19 where Room 11 is and if it is drawn in correctly?\n\n20 A. I think these two rooms here.\n\n21 Q. What do you mean? What are these two rooms there?\n\n22 A. Why, the two rooms here on this side are two dormitories.\n\n23 Q. The Room 11 --\n\n24 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff, there has been no dispute that\n\n25 that is Room 11, and it's been shown to a number of witnesses. They're\n\nPage 736\n\n1 obviously two dormitories. I think one of the witnesses described them as\n\n2 bedrooms that belonged to Room 11. There's been no dispute at all.\n\n3 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. That's right, Your Honour, but I would\n\n4 want the witness to discuss in which room he was.\n\n5 JUDGE HUNT: Yes, but you start off by looking at it from the\n\n6 outside, and then this. We'd get along a lot more quickly if you go\n\n7 straight to this and say, \"This is Room 11,\" and, \"Which room were you\n\n8 in?\"\n\n9 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n10 JUDGE HUNT: You don't have to worry about leading where there is\n\n11 something which is not in dispute.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Okay. Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n13 Q. Witness, you said two bedrooms, but actually, weren't there even\n\n14 four bedrooms?\n\n15 A. On this side. Listen, on this side towards the administrative\n\n16 part of the camp and two on that side. I slept here, for instance. But\n\n17 all this was an area which the inhabitants of Room 11 could use. This was\n\n18 used for leisure activities by former convicts who had normal living\n\n19 conditions, if we can put it that way. But this is the entrance here.\n\n20 This is a small entry, and here the wash basin and the WC.\n\n21 Q. Yes. Thank you, Witness. So you could move around in all four\n\n22 bedrooms --\n\n23 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, excuse me. The witness\n\n24 had just explained which dormitory he was in, and we cannot read --\n\n25 understand it through the transcript unless it is explained. He just\n\nPage 737\n\n1 pointed at the room.\n\n2 JUDGE HUNT: You're quite right, and you probably had a better\n\n3 view of it than we did because you would have heard it in the original\n\n4 B/C/S.\n\n5 He was moving the pointer at the time the translation came\n\n6 through, Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff. If you want to know which bedroom he's in,\n\n7 let's just ask that question and ask him to hold the pointer there.\n\n8 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n9 Q. Witness, in which bedroom did you sleep?\n\n10 A. Sleep. [Indicates]\n\n11 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is pointing at the bedroom going\n\n12 to the back side, and it's the left bedroom going to the back side.\n\n13 Q. But you also --\n\n14 JUDGE HUNT: In the corner of the building, I think, might be the\n\n15 best way to put it.\n\n16 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. In the corner of the building.\n\n17 Q. But you also went into the other two bedrooms who faced the\n\n18 administration building? Is that what you said?\n\n19 A. The remaining three. Yes, every day.\n\n20 Q. Yes. Thank you. Let me now show you two photos, actually. One\n\n21 photo is the photo 7495 and the other one is the photo 7503.\n\n22 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I would like to have the witness shown them\n\n23 next to each other. Only the bottom photos, please.\n\n24 Q. If you look at the bottom photos, and in relation to the windows,\n\n25 could you say which bedroom is which from the position of the windows?\n\nPage 738\n\n1 A. From the position of the windows, one cannot really conclude\n\n2 anything because they're identical in both rooms. This was -- these\n\n3 photographs were taken from within the rooms. If I were outside, perhaps\n\n4 I could identify them, but otherwise, they're identical. So I just don't\n\n5 know. You have windows here and you have windows there, even though I\n\n6 think that the one to the left -- that the one to the right was on the\n\n7 corner of the building. As a matter of fact, they all take the corner,\n\n8 either the left one or the right one. But such an inside look doesn't\n\n9 really help you identify because the windows are identical and all these\n\n10 beds, of course, can be positioned wherever at any time.\n\n11 Q. Witness --\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: Just a moment. It may be if we had a look at the\n\n13 photograph on the right a little bit more carefully, there appears to be a\n\n14 window on the right wall.\n\n15 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: That's what I just wanted to ask.\n\n16 Q. Witness, look at the photo 7495 first alone. Yes. Yes. Maybe\n\n17 this is better. Please have a look at the position of the windows. On\n\n18 the lower photo, do you see that there are windows on the right side?\n\n19 A. I see something here. This is the right-hand side if you look at\n\n20 it from inside the room. But if I looked at it from the administrative\n\n21 building, then this would be to the -- this would be on the left-hand\n\n22 side.\n\n23 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff, are we not having the\n\n24 photographer to tell us all of this? What is the necessity of getting it\n\n25 from this witness?\n\nPage 739\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: I would like the witness to point out where\n\n2 he was standing when a certain incident happened. I would like to, but\n\n3 okay, we can move on. I thought he would see it. Let's move on.\n\n4 A. This room which you see on the lower photograph, that is not my\n\n5 room because it did not have any windows on the right. From this angle,\n\n6 it had windows overlooking the compound, the park, and these here overlook\n\n7 the administrative building. The two windows on the left, they have a\n\n8 view of the park.\n\n9 Q. Thank you. We can move on. I would like to show you now the\n\n10 window -- not the window, sorry, the photo 7499. That's the lower one.\n\n11 Does this view look familiar to you?\n\n12 A. Yes. This is the ground floor and the upper floor, right below\n\n13 one of the dormitories, perhaps not more than ten metres as the crow\n\n14 flies. And to the left, you cannot see it on this photograph, but there\n\n15 is a door into the compound somewhere here; you cannot see it on this\n\n16 photograph. From the camp compound, that is how you enter the\n\n17 administrative part of the building here.\n\n18 Q. Yes. Would that be the view you had from one of the bedrooms in\n\n19 Room 11?\n\n20 A. Yes, this part is what you can see from both those bedrooms. But\n\n21 I was -- again, if we look from the administrative part towards the\n\n22 dormitory, when this incident happened about which I guess you want to ask\n\n23 me questions.\n\n24 Q. Yes. And another photo, I would like to show you another photo,\n\n25 and that's the photo 7479. Can you say which view it is? Did you have\n\nPage 740\n\n1 such a view from Room 11?\n\n2 A. Well, yes, this I could see. This is from one of the bedrooms in\n\n3 Room 11, which we just saw a moment ago. This is a view of the compound,\n\n4 and these stairs lead from -- below here are the stairs. This is the park\n\n5 with a path, and this is how we went up into the room. This is a view of\n\n6 the restaurant and factories. That was the factory. This is the -- to\n\n7 the right is the canteen, and then the rest of the buildings.\n\n8 Q. Yes, thank you.\n\n9 A. A diagonal view.\n\n10 Q. Yes, thank you. And you just mentioned a door that you could see\n\n11 from Room 11, and I would like to show you a last photo, and that's the\n\n12 photo 7473. That is the lower photo.\n\n13 On this photo, the door close to number 1, is that the door you\n\n14 spoke about?\n\n15 A. It is, yes.\n\n16 Q. Thank you. Witness, when you arrived in Room 11, were there\n\n17 already detainees in Room 11?\n\n18 A. Yes.\n\n19 Q. How many?\n\n20 A. Well, some 30, 40 people, and many of us were brought there, so at\n\n21 that particular moment there were more than 100 men there. Much more than\n\n22 100.\n\n23 Q. And what was the highest number of detainees that ever were in\n\n24 Room 11 at a time?\n\n25 A. I think that it was the first day when they brought us in, and\n\nPage 741\n\n1 then they began the very next day to move people to other rooms. But I\n\n2 stayed in that room. Well, there were over 100. One-hundred and fifty\n\n3 men could have been there that first day and the next day because it was\n\n4 really very crowded. But in a day or two or three, I don't know, people\n\n5 were then put in other rooms, and after that it was always around 60, 70\n\n6 men.\n\n7 Q. Do you know why you stayed in Room 11? Could you see a system in\n\n8 moving the people to rooms?\n\n9 A. I wouldn't know why I stayed in Room 11. I wasn't the only one;\n\n10 there were many others who stayed there. I don't know the reason. I\n\n11 guess because it was just too crowded, that there was no where to lie\n\n12 down.\n\n13 Q. The people in Room 11 who were there then for a longer time\n\n14 together with you, were they all Muslims, or were people of other\n\n15 ethnicity among you?\n\n16 A. In my room there was one Catholic, a Croat; Kruno Marinovic.\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: That's the person in Schedule C, number 17,\n\n18 Your Honour.\n\n19 Q. In what health state was Mr. Marinovic when you saw him?\n\n20 A. In a very poor state; beaten over, his cheekbone broken, many\n\n21 bruises on his body.\n\n22 Q. The other people in the room, what age did they have?\n\n23 A. They belonged to all age groups. The eldest ones were 70, 75 and\n\n24 the youngest, around 16, I think. There was a boy, Soro, who was 14.\n\n25 Q. What state of health did these other people have? Were there sick\n\nPage 742\n\n1 people among you, handicapped people?\n\n2 A. At that time there were no sick people there, I mean people who\n\n3 would have to lie down because of a fever or something. But afterwards\n\n4 people gradually lost strength, lost weight, and quite a number of them\n\n5 were beaten many times over.\n\n6 Q. You mentioned Mr. Marinovic. How old was he?\n\n7 A. Well, he could have been a year or two, maybe four or five younger\n\n8 than I am, but that is only my opinion. He could have been four or five\n\n9 years my junior, perhaps more -- no, not more. But he's younger than I\n\n10 am.\n\n11 Q. And who was he? What was his profession; do you know that?\n\n12 A. I think -- I know what he did of late. He was a mechanic; he\n\n13 repaired TV receivers and things like that. Before that he worked for\n\n14 Zenica TV, for Sarajevo TV, and he was a lighting master. I think that's\n\n15 what you call it but I'm not sure. I do not know whether this is the\n\n16 term, really, but he was responsible for lighting, when you work with\n\n17 lights, when you want to shoot something.\n\n18 He was also a journalist a little bit. He dabbled in journalism.\n\n19 As a matter of fact, I do not really know him. But one man, I think,\n\n20 threatened him, \"Uh-huh, you've written,\" and it was published in Zagreb\n\n21 or something. But whether he was a professional journalist or not, I\n\n22 really don't know.\n\n23 Q. You said that he was injured. Did he get medical care for his\n\n24 injuries?\n\n25 A. No.\n\nPage 743\n\n1 Q. Could you see how many detainees were in the other rooms? Could\n\n2 you estimate altogether?\n\n3 A. At that moment, no. At that moment, no, because people were being\n\n4 brought in or out all the time. But later, after perhaps 15, 20 days,\n\n5 perhaps a month, because of the position of Room 11, we tried to count\n\n6 people. Once we counted 700, 708, 705, but it does not mean that it was\n\n7 really very accurate. There could have been more men or a less, perhaps a\n\n8 few more or a few less.\n\n9 Q. As far as you knew those people you saw, did they all come from\n\n10 Foca and the surrounding villages, or did they also come from elsewhere?\n\n11 A. As far as I know, they were people from Foca and adjacent\n\n12 villages. But of course it is quite possible that they were -- oh, yes,\n\n13 yes, yes -- sorry, yes.\n\n14 A busful of people came with people from the Montenegrin coast,\n\n15 people who were from Gorazde, Cajnice, Srebrenica, Trebinje. As far as I\n\n16 can remember, those men had fled there and registered with the Red Cross,\n\n17 but somehow people went there and rounded up some 50 of them. And I know\n\n18 that there was one from Trebinje, four or five from Srebrenica, four or\n\n19 five, as far as I know, from Gorazde, and two, three from Cajnice.\n\n20 Q. When did these people arrive? When did these detainees arrive in\n\n21 KP Dom? Do you remember the month, maybe?\n\n22 A. Perhaps late May or early June. I wouldn't know; I really wasn't\n\n23 up to any statistics.\n\n24 Q. Were women ever detained in KP Dom?\n\n25 A. All I know is that one night a busload of women and children was\n\nPage 744\n\n1 brought there in late evening and so they spent the night in the compound,\n\n2 but they were not there after that.\n\n3 Q. You said that in the beginning there were these soldiers there.\n\n4 While these soldiers were there, did any beatings occur?\n\n5 A. It was a daily occurrence, in passing, yes, but they did not stay\n\n6 long. I mean, I don't claim it was a day or two more, a day or two less,\n\n7 or ten days, but they took over the -- but then the camp was taken over by\n\n8 policemen, that is, former policemen. There were not many. There were\n\n9 also some other people who were milling about, but they were, by and\n\n10 large -- the guards were, by and large, the former guards.\n\n11 Q. When did they take over?\n\n12 A. Well, say, for about ten days, seven, eight, ten days -- seven,\n\n13 eight days after the camp was established, and I think it began to be\n\n14 settled then. They were Serbs, and they used the dialect that is not\n\n15 spoken in Foca so I assumed that they came from Serbia, because that is\n\n16 where they use this dialect. Moreover, some of them talked.\n\n17 Q. Witness, let me interrupt you here. I was asking you about the\n\n18 guards who took over, and you said that they were the former guards you\n\n19 knew. What kind of uniforms did they wear, the former prison guard\n\n20 uniforms or military uniforms?\n\n21 A. Yes, they were in uniforms, except one or two who were in\n\n22 camouflage uniforms. But otherwise they were guards.\n\n23 Q. Were they police uniforms or --\n\n24 A. Blue police uniforms.\n\n25 Q. What kind of weapons did they have, if any?\n\nPage 745\n\n1 A. Do we begin with the knives or pistols or Kalashnikovs?\n\n2 Q. Just tell us what you saw on the guards as weapons.\n\n3 A. Well, say, they had, if you call it a weapon, the axe handles, for\n\n4 instance, and knives. Often they would throw knives at the acacias. And\n\n5 they had pistols and automatic weapons.\n\n6 Q. Were there any Serb prisoners in the KP Dom while you were there?\n\n7 A. Yes. Some men were singled out there. They did not mix with us.\n\n8 There were some people, and I knew two or three of them. One even cried\n\n9 to me as I was coming from the canteen. He said, \"Hey,\" and mentioned my\n\n10 name, and said, \"Look, I'm here too. They locked me because I wouldn't\n\n11 take up the rifle.\"\n\n12 Q. And where were these Serb prisoners kept, in which part of\n\n13 KP Dom? Do you know the room number or the wing?\n\n14 A. I don't know which room -- which number of the room. I know they\n\n15 were in the wing where these solitary confinement cells were, only above\n\n16 it, on the upper floor.\n\n17 Q. The solitary confinement cells, in which building were they, in\n\n18 the building A where Room 11 was or in the other wing?\n\n19 A. Neither in building A with Room 11 nor B with Room 20. There is a\n\n20 separate wing which is the transfers wing.\n\n21 Q. Have you ever been take taken to these isolation cells?\n\n22 A. Unfortunately, yes.\n\n23 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n24 show the witness the floor plan 6/2.\n\n25 Q. Please have a look at this floor plan. And can you show\n\nPage 746\n\n1 us --\n\n2 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: You have to move it a little bit. You have\n\n3 to move it to the left. Yes. No, the other way. Yes.\n\n4 Q. Can you show us -- do you recall in which isolation cell you\n\n5 were?\n\n6 A. I think the last one here, number 5.\n\n7 Q. Yes. And -- yes. Thank you. And now I would like to show you\n\n8 two photos, and it is 7525 and 7526. Please have a look at the photos and\n\n9 tell us if the isolation cell you were in looked kind of similar.\n\n10 A. This is solitary confinement, a solitary confinement cell, its\n\n11 inside. I think it is self-explanatory. You see how dirty the toilet\n\n12 is.\n\n13 You can't see it on this photograph here, but there should be a\n\n14 faucet here that can be opened, but you can't really see anything here.\n\n15 There is something black here and then this is the toilet. This is what\n\n16 it looked like in my cell at least.\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. Thank you, Mr. Usher.\n\n18 Q. Why were you taken there?\n\n19 A. Why? Well, I was supposed to work in the kitchen, and I worked on\n\n20 the distribution of food for three days. I felt sorry for person 115. I\n\n21 gave this person an extra slice of bread which was very small.\n\n22 Q. And what happened? Did someone see that?\n\n23 A. He saw it in his hands, and then he asked him, \"Where did you get\n\n24 this?\" Then he said he got it from the man who was distributing bread\n\n25 that day.\n\nPage 747\n\n1 That was Pilica Blagojevic. Pilica was his nickname. I can't\n\n2 remember his name any more. He was a guard. He came in there where the\n\n3 food was being distributed, and he asked who was handing out the bread,\n\n4 and I said, \"I am.\" I didn't even know why he asked me. He told me to\n\n5 take off that white shirt and those white trousers and to report to\n\n6 Maric. And I asked where, and he showed me the direction in which this\n\n7 was. That is where the solitary confinement cells were. I did not know\n\n8 what this was all about.\n\n9 I reported to Maric, and he said, \"What have you done?\" And I\n\n10 said, \"Nothing.\" \"What have you done?\" \"Nothing.\"\n\n11 In the meantime, Pilica arrived and said that I gave bread to this\n\n12 person. Maric put me in there, locked me up. Pilica hit me a few times,\n\n13 hit me really bad. There were bruises and a few teeth out, things like\n\n14 that.\n\n15 Q. Maric, who was that? Was that another guard in charge maybe of\n\n16 the cells or what? Who?\n\n17 A. I don't know whether he was in charge of the cells. I think it\n\n18 was Milomir Maric, nicknamed Mara. I don't know whether he was in charge\n\n19 of the cells, but at that moment when I was taken to the cell, he was\n\n20 there.\n\n21 Q. So he was a guard?\n\n22 A. He was a guard from before. He was a guard from before at the\n\n23 KP Dom, and he was there while I was at the camp.\n\n24 Q. And when did this happen, this incident in the isolation cell?\n\n25 A. I think on the 8th of August. I think. I think I started working\n\nPage 748\n\n1 at the kitchen on the 5th. I worked three days. It should have been then\n\n2 the 8th of August, 1992, of course.\n\n3 Everything that I'm talking about is the period between the 16th,\n\n4 17th of April and the 30th of August, 1992. So let us avoid any kind of\n\n5 confusion. If I don't mention the year, all of it has to do with 1992.\n\n6 That is the period that I spent in the camp.\n\n7 Q. Who gave you the kitchen job?\n\n8 A. Savo Todovic to me. But I don't know about the others. He was\n\n9 before also the officer for the division of labour in the KP Dom, and that\n\n10 is what he told us camp inmates to do.\n\n11 Q. Did you ask him to get the job in the kitchen or did he just call\n\n12 you out and order?\n\n13 A. I don't know exactly. He sent one of the guards, I don't know\n\n14 which one, and he told me that I should come with him to Savo Todovic. I\n\n15 came there. That was also where Maric was when I was going there. There\n\n16 are these officers there who could remember all of it now. And I when\n\n17 arrived, he said to me that he was appointing me to distribute food, but,\n\n18 unfortunately, this lasted only for three days.\n\n19 Q. While he appointed you doing this job, did he warn you? Did he\n\n20 give you a directive?\n\n21 A. Yes. He warned me that I should not do what I did, that I could\n\n22 lose my head if I were to give someone more food or an extra slice of\n\n23 bread. Yes. Yes, but that really didn't remain imprinted in my memory,\n\n24 so what happened, happened.\n\n25 Q. You said that you were beaten and that you lost some teeth and you\n\nPage 749\n\n1 had bruises. Was it -- were you only beaten this one time or were you\n\n2 beaten several times while in the isolation cell?\n\n3 A. I was only beaten then by Blagojevic, and nobody else ever beat\n\n4 me, because I did not stay in solitary confinement for long, three or four\n\n5 days.\n\n6 Q. And while you were in solitary confinement, were there other\n\n7 detainees as well in the adjacent cells?\n\n8 A. There were four or five cells there. They also say that also\n\n9 there were cells on the other side. Often beatings could be heard, but\n\n10 also conversations could be heard between cells, although people could not\n\n11 see each other.\n\n12 Q. Did you see that anybody was beaten at the same time as you or in\n\n13 these few days or could you only hear it?\n\n14 A. I could only hear it. I could not see it because there are no\n\n15 windows there. There is just a very small opening on the door with glass\n\n16 and also mesh. But when I was there, I don't think there was even any\n\n17 glass. There was just this metal mesh.\n\n18 Q. Who released you from the isolation cell?\n\n19 A. Mitar Rasevic, commander of the guard, commander of the security.\n\n20 I don't know. Commander of these police who guarded us.\n\n21 Q. And did he say anything to you when he released you?\n\n22 A. Well, he said, \"You know what? I'm going to let you go although\n\n23 you were supposed to be killed, liquidated,\" something like that. I don't\n\n24 know. Something like that, roughly.\n\n25 Q. Did he tell you more details about it, who told him that you were\n\nPage 750\n\n1 to be liquidated?\n\n2 A. No.\n\n3 Q. Witness, we have already heard other witnesses speaking about the\n\n4 conditions in the KP Dom, and we do not have to repeat it. Did you lose\n\n5 weight while you were in the KP Dom?\n\n6 A. To be precise, I lost 37 kilogrammes during my 136 days in the\n\n7 camp, at the KP Dom.\n\n8 Q. Why?\n\n9 A. Because of the poor food.\n\n10 Q. Was no food available because of the war or were the rations\n\n11 deliberately kept so low? Do you know that?\n\n12 A. Well, I don't know whether this was intentional or unintentional,\n\n13 but food was scarce. It would be wrong for me to say that it was\n\n14 intentional now. I don't know that there was a scarcity of food. I don't\n\n15 know whether it was because of the war or because they wanted to starve\n\n16 people. I cannot say that for sure.\n\n17 Q. Do you know if any person died due to the conditions in the\n\n18 KP Dom? I'm not referring to violent acts. I'm referring to the\n\n19 conditions.\n\n20 A. Not in my room. However, it is well known that Eso Hodzic, as he\n\n21 was called -- he was a taxi driver before -- died because his ulcer\n\n22 perforated and he was not adequately taken care of. I don't know about\n\n23 other cases.\n\n24 Q. Were you locked in the Room 11 all the time or were you taken out\n\n25 for walks in the yard while you were there?\n\nPage 751\n\n1 A. No. Only when we went to have meals, breakfast, lunch, and\n\n2 dinner, and sometimes when I went to unload flour. I went once. That's\n\n3 when I went out.\n\n4 Q. Did you have family visits at a point in time?\n\n5 A. Once. Once. I don't know exactly when this was. On the 9th of\n\n6 May, I think. I'm not sure of the date, but that was the first and last\n\n7 time my wife visited me. It was on the 9th of May, as far as I can\n\n8 remember. After that, visits were forbidden.\n\n9 Q. Did you request a visit or did your wife request permission to see\n\n10 you?\n\n11 A. Well, she probably did not request that. I didn't request that.\n\n12 However, this was an open visit in the part of the administrative\n\n13 building. It was very short, and a guard, a policeman, was present.\n\n14 Q. While you were in the KP Dom, were you ever interrogated?\n\n15 A. Yes. Yes, once.\n\n16 Q. When was that and where did it happen?\n\n17 A. Well, at the outset, I think, end of April, beginning of May\n\n18 perhaps. This was in the administrative part of the building.\n\n19 Q. And who interrogated you?\n\n20 A. Misa Koprivica, inspector of the SUP.\n\n21 Q. When you say \"SUP,\" do you mean the police in Foca?\n\n22 A. Yes. The Secretariat of the Interior. That's the police.\n\n23 Q. And what did he want to know from you?\n\n24 A. Well, I can tell you he treated me quite fairly. His task was to\n\n25 ask me where I was, what I was doing, whether I was organised in some\n\nPage 752\n\n1 fashion. He even treated me to a cup of coffee and a cigarette, the man\n\n2 did. He treated me very fairly.\n\n3 However, I heard later from some others, now to what extent you\n\n4 can believe this or not is different, that he beat them. I did not see\n\n5 that, but he really did not treat me that way.\n\n6 Q. You said that others were beaten by him or claimed to have been\n\n7 beaten by him. Do you recall who told you that?\n\n8 A. Well, the three Soro brothers were there and Cedic Elvedin, Dzemal\n\n9 Vahida. These are actually people who are from this neighbourhood of\n\n10 Cohodor Mahala. Now, whether he beat them, why he beat them, I don't\n\n11 know, but he did tell me as we were talking, \"Imagine, at this old man's\n\n12 place we found a radio transmitter.\" And I said, \"Oh, that's impossible.\n\n13 He doesn't even know how to turn on a regular radio to listen to the\n\n14 news. How could he know how to operate that?\" \"Oh, yes, he does,\" said\n\n15 he. \"They found it there. And also in somebody else's house, in the\n\n16 basement, they found 100 kilogrammes of explosive.\"\n\n17 I don't know whether that's true or not, but I suppose that this\n\n18 man whom he described to me does not even know how to turn on a radio to\n\n19 listen to the news.\n\n20 Q. When you say \"he\" told you, who do you mean?\n\n21 A. Misa Koprivica.\n\n22 Q. Let me clarify. When did he tell you that, while he was\n\n23 questioning you?\n\n24 A. Yes.\n\n25 Q. And to which old man do you refer? Can you give us the name of\n\nPage 753\n\n1 this old man who was supposed to have a radio transmitter?\n\n2 A. I can't say. It was the name of a man who I knew a very little\n\n3 bit. I don't know who it was, actually.\n\n4 Q. Yes. Did you see detainees being beaten in the prisoners'\n\n5 quarters, in the rooms?\n\n6 A. In the rooms, no. In Room 11, nobody was beaten in the room, but\n\n7 in the administrative building, yes.\n\n8 Q. Can you tell us who was taken out of your room and taken to the\n\n9 administration building?\n\n10 A. Dzemal Vahida; Elvedin Cedic, Ekinda; Hadzic; Sahinovic were taken\n\n11 out on several occasions.\n\n12 Q. Yes. And can you tell us, Dzemal Vahida - that's number C-27 -\n\n13 when he was --\n\n14 A. Dzemal Vahida, when he was taken out for beatings, I can't\n\n15 remember the date, but it was in May for sure.\n\n16 Q. You said that these people were taken out several times.\n\n17 A. Yes.\n\n18 Q. Did you see them return? Let's speak about --\n\n19 A. They returned. He, Dzemal Vahida, and Ekinda Cedic were returned,\n\n20 one after the other. One would be taken out and then the other one would\n\n21 be taken out when this one would be brought back, and that's the way it\n\n22 went.\n\n23 Q. Ekinda Cedic, does he have a different name as well? Ekinda\n\n24 sounds to me like a nickname.\n\n25 A. Ekinda is a nickname. Elvedin Cedic is his name.\n\nPage 754\n\n1 Q. That's the person C-5. Could you see what injuries they had when\n\n2 they returned?\n\n3 A. Disastrous. Cedic had bruises on his head. He's a young man but\n\n4 he's kind of bald, and you could see it on his head and all over his\n\n5 body. Vahida also had bruises. And also up here, I mean his teeth had\n\n6 completely gone through his skin and his teeth were all broken, and he had\n\n7 to use a straw for drinking tea and soup for several days.\n\n8 Q. Did they tell you where exactly they had been beaten, and who did\n\n9 it?\n\n10 A. In one of the offices of the administrative part of the KP Dom. I\n\n11 don't know whether I'm going to remember the name anymore. Radivoje Elez,\n\n12 son of Gavro, nicknamed Mento. I don't know the others, but Mento was\n\n13 there for sure, because he said that Mento sort of swirled and kicked him\n\n14 when his teeth were broken.\n\n15 Q. And you are talking about whom, Ekinda Cedic?\n\n16 A. No, Dzemal Vahida, when his teeth were broken and when his\n\n17 remaining teeth were protruding from the skin of his upper lip.\n\n18 Q. This Mento, was that a guard?\n\n19 A. No.\n\n20 Q. Who was it, then?\n\n21 A. He was a young man. I don't know exactly. I think he worked as a\n\n22 carpenter before the war. But he came to administer justice, I guess. I\n\n23 don't know.\n\n24 Q. You said this happened in May. Was it during the daytime or\n\n25 during the night-time?\n\nPage 755\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 756\n\n1 A. During the day. During the day. During the day they would be\n\n2 taken out several times. One would be taken out and then he would be\n\n3 brought back in, and then the other one would be taken out and then\n\n4 brought back, and then the other one again. So alternately during the\n\n5 course of the day.\n\n6 Q. Who took them out of the rooms to the administration building?\n\n7 Who was that?\n\n8 A. I don't know personally who did, but in most cases it was Slobodan\n\n9 Pejic/Boban Pejic, who took people out. He had a piece of paper with\n\n10 people's names on it. I think that in 90 per cent of all cases, as far as\n\n11 Room 11 is concerned, Boban Pejic/Slobodan Pejic took people from Room\n\n12 11. I think that he was the youngest guard there and that is probably why\n\n13 he was assigned this duty to go up and down, up and down, up and down.\n\n14 Q. Did you see any other detainee being taken in this manner and\n\n15 returned?\n\n16 A. People were taken many times. I saw Aziz Sahinovic, for example,\n\n17 and then this young Uzunovic. I can't remember his name right now;\n\n18 perhaps I'll think of it later. He is a medical worker. He was beaten up\n\n19 but ...\n\n20 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: This is the person C-26, and the witness is\n\n21 actually referring to incident 5.29 in the indictment.\n\n22 Q. Did you see Mr. Uzunovic come back, and did you see what injuries\n\n23 he had, if any?\n\n24 A. Well, primarily, these were bruises all over the body.\n\n25 Q. And Mr. Azinovic, you mentioned. What kind of injuries did you\n\nPage 757\n\n1 see on him?\n\n2 A. I did not mention Mr. Azinovic. I think that this is a slip of\n\n3 the tongue. I mentioned Mr. Sahinovic. This is Aziz Sahinovic. Perhaps\n\n4 this was a slip of the tongue.\n\n5 Q. It was my wrong pronunciation, I'm sorry. So what did you see on\n\n6 him?\n\n7 A. He was beaten up very badly; he was black and blue. But he\n\n8 complained about the area where the kidneys are.\n\n9 Q. Did he tell you who beat him up?\n\n10 A. Yes. He said it was the guard Burilo.\n\n11 Q. Did he tell you where it happened?\n\n12 A. In the administrative building, on the ground floor, somewhere\n\n13 where I had never been; where there were some kind of chains, where before\n\n14 they would tie up the detainees if they came in drunk, and they let them\n\n15 lie there on the concrete floor, chained, until they would get sober.\n\n16 Q. Did you see anyone else return from the beatings?\n\n17 A. Maybe I can't remember, but there were such cases, there really\n\n18 were.\n\n19 Q. Yes. Let us now speak about those -- let us speak about another\n\n20 incident. Did you ever hear shots in the KP Dom in relation to beatings?\n\n21 A. I don't know what you're getting at. There were lots of shots,\n\n22 shooting sort of into the air, in the evening when the guards would sit in\n\n23 front of the restaurant. But I know what you're getting at. I heard\n\n24 these shots. But there were shots, actually, when killings were\n\n25 committed.\n\nPage 758\n\n1 Q. Yes, and I would like -- yes, that is actually what I'm referring\n\n2 to. Can you tell us if you ever saw people being shot?\n\n3 A. Yes, on the 25th of June I saw this. From 9.30 until 10.30, I\n\n4 think it was more like 10.00, from my room they took four -- three -- four\n\n5 men, and one was brought in from somewhere else. I knew all of them.\n\n6 They were taken to the administrative part of the building where you can\n\n7 see the broken glass on the window, the one I showed you a few minutes\n\n8 ago.\n\n9 In that area, they were first beaten up; they were choked, kicked,\n\n10 hit with hands and feet. And then they were made to stand against the\n\n11 wall with their hands up and they were shot with firearms.\n\n12 I have to mention that it rained very hard outside then.\n\n13 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, before I go into the details of\n\n14 this incident, I see it's 11.00.\n\n15 JUDGE HUNT: It is by my watch, if not by the clock.\n\n16 Yes, we'll take our adjournment now and resume at 11.30.\n\n17 --- Recess taken at 11.00 a.m.\n\n18 --- On resuming at 11.30 a.m.\n\n19 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff.\n\n20 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you, Your Honour.\n\n21 Q. Witness, speaking about this incident on the 25th of June, 1992,\n\n22 who was taken out from your room? Do you recall?\n\n23 A. They took Munib Veiz, Mustafa Kuloglija, Professor and engineer\n\n24 Kemal Dzelilovic, and the little Uzunovic. I can't remember his first\n\n25 name, but he was a nurse. Enes, Enes Uzunovic. Sorry, I just\n\nPage 759\n\n1 remembered.\n\n2 Q. Munib Veiz, what was he by profession? Do you know?\n\n3 A. He was a salesman.\n\n4 Q. And Mr. Dzelilovic. You said professor?\n\n5 A. Yes.\n\n6 Q. He was an engineer and professor of mechanical engineering?\n\n7 A. Yes.\n\n8 Q. And Mustafa Kuloglija?\n\n9 A. Kuloglija is a teacher by profession, and I believe he was\n\n10 responsible for elementary education in the municipal administration in\n\n11 Foca. And the little Uzunovic was a nurse, and he worked in the\n\n12 hospital.\n\n13 And another man, Hamid Ramovic, was taken together with them, but\n\n14 he was not from our room. However, I knew him personally.\n\n15 Q. Did you see him being taken to the administration building?\n\n16 A. I did, yes.\n\n17 Q. And who was he? What was his profession?\n\n18 A. I believe he was a miner, a manual worker.\n\n19 Q. Who called them out? Who called them out from your room?\n\n20 A. Again, Slobodan Pejic, Boban. I don't know who took Ramovic, but\n\n21 Slobodan Pejic, nicknamed Boban, called out the names of those four from\n\n22 my room.\n\n23 Q. Could you see where they were taken?\n\n24 A. They were taken to the administrative part of the building, the\n\n25 ground floor that we saw awhile ago on that photograph, with that window\n\nPage 760\n\n1 on the ground floor.\n\n2 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n3 show the witness again, and it's the photograph 7499, the lower one.\n\n4 Q. Witness, can you show us where they were taken?\n\n5 A. Here.\n\n6 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is pointing to the second window\n\n7 on the ground floor, counted from the left.\n\n8 Q. How could you see that? Did you see them in this room?\n\n9 A. I saw them in that room, but they entered from somewhere here.\n\n10 The door is over here. You can't see it on the photograph. And there's a\n\n11 passage. And from that passage it goes through the administrative part of\n\n12 the building, from the street to the prison compound, and they were here\n\n13 in this, and that is where they were liquidated.\n\n14 Q. Could you actually see them, and how?\n\n15 A. I saw them and I saw them well.\n\n16 Q. Was the light on in this room?\n\n17 A. Yes.\n\n18 Q. Could you see anything else in the room which was maybe strange to\n\n19 you?\n\n20 A. In that room -- I do not know what the lady asking me questions\n\n21 means, but during the night when the lights are out, you can still see\n\n22 very well because there are some control lights, something that radiated\n\n23 lights, some control instrument or something, something that produced a\n\n24 red light but not very powerful. These are something like these control\n\n25 lamps when you switch off your TV set, for instance, and then you see the\n\nPage 761\n\n1 red light. Something like that.\n\n2 Q. Could you see who beat them in this room?\n\n3 A. Yes, but I'm afraid I won't be able to give you the names because\n\n4 it was eight and a half years ago. There was Dragomir Obrenovic,\n\n5 nicknamed Obren, guard; Burilo, guard; Zoran Matovic, guard; Rade Vukovic,\n\n6 guard; there was Predrag Stefanovic, Predo; and I can't remember others.\n\n7 Q. Can you clearly see them, these guards?\n\n8 A. Oh, yes, indeed, very clearly. Well, that was their night-shift.\n\n9 That day they were on duty, and I could see them very well against the\n\n10 light. I watched it through the window of Room 11 on the left. It's\n\n11 perhaps less than 8 -- not as many as 8 or 10 metres as the crow flies.\n\n12 Q. Were these guards you mentioned and these detainees you mentioned,\n\n13 were they in this room all at the same time or were the detainees beaten\n\n14 one after another, separately?\n\n15 A. All together they beat them. They were all together there. First\n\n16 they maltreated them and that was followed by what I've just told you.\n\n17 Q. And how did they beat them, with objects for with their fists\n\n18 only?\n\n19 A. Fists and feet. Fists and feet. They would grab them by the\n\n20 throat, and then when firing started, I saw Zoran Matovic move his head,\n\n21 turn over his head with his foot to see whether he was alive still, I\n\n22 guess.\n\n23 Q. Whose head?\n\n24 A. Kemal Dzelilovic's.\n\n25 Q. And how long did the beating last? Approximately.\n\nPage 762\n\n1 A. Some 10 minutes. It was all over in 10 minutes.\n\n2 Q. And could you hear the voices of the detainees or the guards?\n\n3 Could you hear what was said?\n\n4 A. Nobody said anything. At least one could not hear anything. Some\n\n5 sounds, yes, but nothing that one could identify. Perhaps a wail, a sob,\n\n6 but that is not speech, just a cry of pain.\n\n7 Q. And you said they were shot. Did one guard shoot them or did\n\n8 several guards shoot?\n\n9 A. One could hear several shots simultaneously.\n\n10 Q. Did you see the detainees fall down after the shots were heard?\n\n11 A. Yes. Yes, I did see that. There were no more people leaning\n\n12 against the wall; they were all on the floor.\n\n13 Q. Could you see -- when this happened, could you see the entire\n\n14 bodies of the detainees and the guards or parts of it?\n\n15 A. When they were lying down on the floor, when they were dead, I\n\n16 suppose, one could see the heads of those which were farther away from us,\n\n17 and that is how I could see Zoka Matovic push his -- push Dzelilovic's\n\n18 head with his foot to see if he was alive. That is what I could see. I\n\n19 don't know. And then Zoka left, because there are stairs leading\n\n20 upstairs, and he carried several -- he had several blankets over his arm,\n\n21 something like army blankets, down the stairs.\n\n22 And one could see it all very well, how they put them there and\n\n23 then carried them out somewhere, and then one could hear a vehicle come\n\n24 and then disappear shortly afterwards. So it's the position that they\n\n25 just took them away somewhere. And after awhile, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes\n\nPage 763\n\n1 later, men came with buckets and mops or something, in olive-green/grey\n\n2 uniforms, and cleaned that part.\n\n3 Q. Witness, you have shown us the window, and I would like you -- the\n\n4 window you looked through when this happened. I would like to show you\n\n5 again the floor plan, and this time it's Exhibit 6/1. I would like to ask\n\n6 you to look at the floor plan of the administration building. Are you\n\n7 able to point out the room? If not, it's ...\n\n8 A. I can't see much here, really.\n\n9 Q. Okay. Then that's fine.\n\n10 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you, Usher.\n\n11 Q. Maybe you can look actually on this drawing itself.\n\n12 A. Yes, this should be it. I kept looking here, but that's the\n\n13 canteen here, the restaurant. But it should be here.\n\n14 Q. Just put it on the ELMO again. Could you see --\n\n15 A. No, I can't see it once more. Now again I can't see it. Believe\n\n16 me, I can't find it.\n\n17 Q. Maybe when you look at --\n\n18 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: The witness is pointing --\n\n19 A. This should be it. This should be it. Yes, now it's slightly\n\n20 larger.\n\n21 Q. Are you pointing at the second room from the left or to the third,\n\n22 where there is this little \"TEL\"?\n\n23 A. From that photograph, through the window on that photograph you\n\n24 can see where this is very well. But here I just don't see any proper\n\n25 rooms. Well, you know, I'm really not accustomed to reading ground floor\n\nPage 764\n\n1 maps. On that photograph I can show you very well; however, on this plan,\n\n2 I really can't find my way around.\n\n3 JUDGE HUNT: Ms. Uertz-Retzlaff, do you have a photograph of the\n\n4 administrative building from the detainees' point of view which shows more\n\n5 than just what we see looking out that window, which is the photograph\n\n6 we've been operating on?\n\n7 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes.\n\n8 JUDGE HUNT: That may assist the witness to identify the room.\n\n9 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes. I think I have here the photo. That is\n\n10 the photo 7474 and 7475, and this may be of assistance.\n\n11 Q. Witness, if you look first on the upper photo --\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: For example, which is the window which appeared to\n\n13 have the broken glass?\n\n14 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: That is the third window from the left-hand\n\n15 side on the ground floor which is next to this water drain --\n\n16 JUDGE HUNT: To the right of the water pipe?\n\n17 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes, to the right of the water pipe.\n\n18 Q. Is that the window?\n\n19 A. That is the window.\n\n20 Q. Let's have a short look at the bottom photo. You see it's a\n\n21 little bit bigger. Is this the window left of the water pipe?\n\n22 A. Left of the water pipe, I think that's the window.\n\n23 Q. Thank you.\n\n24 A. It is opposite, it is directly opposite the window through which I\n\n25 watched.\n\nPage 765\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Thank you, Usher. You can put all the photos\n\n2 away.\n\n3 Q. Witness, you said that this was on the 25th of June.\n\n4 A. Yes.\n\n5 Q. How do you remember the date? Is there a particular reason?\n\n6 A. Well, there is a very good reason: because Munib Veiz (redacted)\n\n7 (redacted). So that is one of the main reasons why I remember the\n\n8 date.\n\n9 Q. Did any other detainee disappear in that same manner -- oh, wait a\n\n10 second. Did you ever see them again or hear of them again?\n\n11 A. Whom do you have in mind?\n\n12 Q. I mean these five people you have just talked about. Did you ever\n\n13 hear of them again?\n\n14 A. I don't know. That question seems somewhat out of place, really.\n\n15 How can I see men whom I saw being killed?\n\n16 Q. The bodies were never found?\n\n17 A. Perhaps they will never be found like many others, hundreds and\n\n18 hundreds of them.\n\n19 JUDGE HUNT: I think that the question could be asked in a\n\n20 slightly different way, perhaps explaining to the witness that whilst he\n\n21 believes they were dead, you have to prove that they were dead and you\n\n22 want to know whether he ever saw them anywhere in any form again.\n\n23 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n24 Q. Yes, Witness, you heard His Honour speak.\n\n25 A. I heard, I did hear. Unfortunately, my answer is no. I wish I\n\nPage 766\n\n1 could see them alive.\n\n2 Q. Witness, do you recall if any other detainees from your room were\n\n3 taken away before these five and had disappeared?\n\n4 A. Yes. A day before that, on the 24th, that was practically the\n\n5 first time that people were taken from my room that I registered. On the\n\n6 24th, Kruno Marinovic; Elvedin Cedic, Ekinda; Refik Cankusic, called Pepi;\n\n7 and a young man, Alija Altoka. I know his father was an electrician.\n\n8 Q. This person Elvedin \"Ekinda\" Cedic, did he also have the nickname\n\n9 Enko?\n\n10 A. Ekinda was his name -- Cedic, his last name, Elvedin, his first\n\n11 name, and Ekinda, his nickname.\n\n12 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, on the list this person is\n\n13 listed as number 5, but it says here \"Enko Cedic,\" and we think this is a\n\n14 mistake.\n\n15 Q. Witness, who took these four out?\n\n16 A. Boban Pejic. Slobodan Pejic, Boban.\n\n17 Q. After they were taken, did you hear the sounds of beatings again?\n\n18 A. No. They went to the administrative part of the building and I\n\n19 never saw them again. They did not come back to the camp.\n\n20 Q. Did you ever see any of them again or hear of them again?\n\n21 A. Unfortunately, no.\n\n22 Q. Was someone taken out from your room after this incident with your\n\n23 relative?\n\n24 A. Nail Hodzic, on the 26th, in the evening hours again. You're\n\n25 going to ask me if I saw him again. No, I never saw him again, and he\n\nPage 767\n\n1 never came back to the camp.\n\n2 Q. Was he taken away in a group of people from other rooms as well,\n\n3 or was he taken alone?\n\n4 A. He went to the administrative part of the building on his own. He\n\n5 had to pass there. I don't know where he went, but he went to the\n\n6 administrative part of the building alone. And it was again in the\n\n7 evening, perhaps around 10.00 or something.\n\n8 Q. Did you hear the sounds of beating after he had left Room 11?\n\n9 A. No.\n\n10 Q. And Mr. Hodzic, who was he?\n\n11 A. I know he was a driver all his professional life. I don't know if\n\n12 he did anything else. He was a driver by profession.\n\n13 Q. Yes. Do you recall if anyone else was taken out later? Do you\n\n14 recall any particular incident?\n\n15 A. Yes. On the 28th of June, a large group of people were taken\n\n16 away. I believe it was 37, if my memory serves me properly, and I knew\n\n17 some of them. They were taken out of the compound and none of them ever\n\n18 returned either.\n\n19 Nurko Nisic, a former policeman, was one of them; Mate Ivancic, a\n\n20 male nurse, a Catholic, a Croat; Zulfo Veiz; Fuad Mandzo; two Soro\n\n21 brothers. And I can't really go on. Perhaps I could remember a couple of\n\n22 names more, but it would take a lot of time. You must know that it\n\n23 happened seven and a half years ago.\n\n24 Q. On the 28th of June --\n\n25 A. What I have just told you happened on the 28th of June.\n\nPage 768\n\n1 Q. And did you hear beatings, the sound of beatings when these\n\n2 37 were taken?\n\n3 A. No. They did not stay there. They were taken away somewhere, but\n\n4 where ... I mean, they were not kept there because they were a large group\n\n5 of people. It was a large number, 37, as far as I could count. I believe\n\n6 there were 37. Perhaps one or two -- perhaps plus one or two -- plus or\n\n7 minus one or two, but that was roughly the figure.\n\n8 Q. Were they taken out in a big group all together or were they taken\n\n9 out in separate smaller groups?\n\n10 A. Gathered together. They all left together. They all went\n\n11 together through that passage that I've already shown, through that part\n\n12 of the administrative building.\n\n13 THE INTERPRETER: If the witness could speak into the microphone,\n\n14 please.\n\n15 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: With the help of the usher, I would like to\n\n16 show the witness the Schedule C list. That is Exhibit 55.\n\n17 JUDGE HUNT: Sir, would you mind moving closer to the\n\n18 microphones? The translators are having difficulty hearing you. Would\n\n19 you move your chair in closer to the microphones. Thank you very much.\n\n20 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF:\n\n21 Q. Witness, you have already mentioned many of the persons listed on\n\n22 the schedule, so we do not need to repeat their fate, but I would like to\n\n23 ask you about some people you have not yet mentioned, if you can tell us\n\n24 anything about them. That is, number 2 on the list, Salem Bico. Do you\n\n25 know him and do you know what happened to him?\n\nPage 769\n\n1 A. Well, do I know him. He was a policeman too. Whether retired or\n\n2 not, I don't know. He was a policeman in Foca. And as for what happened\n\n3 to him, well, lots of things happened to him. For a long time he was\n\n4 isolated somewhere on the ground floor. He and another one nicknamed\n\n5 Sporna Selimovic [phoen], I think. They spent there a long time, and\n\n6 after that they did not turn up in the camp again.\n\n7 Q. Did you see him being taken to the administration building?\n\n8 A. Yes. But he was there for a long time, and he never returned.\n\n9 Q. Can you recall when you saw him for the last time?\n\n10 A. No.\n\n11 Q. The next person, number 3, Abdurahman Cankusic?\n\n12 A. The next person, number 3, is Abdurahman Cankusic, brother of\n\n13 Refik Cankusic. And I think that on the 13th of July, with Adil Krajcin\n\n14 and one of the Soros, a big guy and an electrician, sometime around the\n\n15 13th of July they were taken away in the afternoon and did not come back.\n\n16 Q. And the person 6.\n\n17 A. Yes. And 24 you have Seval Soro. Under 24, Seval Soro.\n\n18 Q. And the person 6, Juso Dzamalija. What can you tell us about him?\n\n19 A. I personally know him. He's an elderly man. He worked in a\n\n20 shop. I did not see him in the camp. However, one of the guards told me\n\n21 that he hanged himself in one of the neighbouring rooms which was there\n\n22 for correction. I don't know whether it was a solitary confinement cell\n\n23 or not, but I was just told that they found him one morning and that he\n\n24 had hanged himself before that. One of the guards told me that, and I'm\n\n25 not going to mention his name. I would mention that man with pride, but I\n\nPage 770\n\n1 don't want him to have any problems.\n\n2 Q. Do you mean a guard who helped you, who was correct to you? Is\n\n3 that what you mean?\n\n4 A. I believe that he was a very fair person and a gleam of light in\n\n5 all this time that I spent there. A human being with utmost dignity.\n\n6 Q. Thank you, Witness. Let's now move on to the person number 8,\n\n7 Ramo Dzendusic. What can you tell about him?\n\n8 A. I saw Ramo Dzendusic in the camp. He was not in my room. I saw\n\n9 him for some time and then he was taken away. But I don't know by who or\n\n10 where or when exactly. After that, he was nowhere to be seen in the\n\n11 camp. Who took him, where, I have no idea.\n\n12 Q. And number 9, Adil Granov?\n\n13 A. Yes, Adil Granov. An engineer who worked in Zica. For some time\n\n14 he was in my room. I can't remember who took him away and where, but I\n\n15 think that he was taken away with a few other men. I can't remember this\n\n16 very well. He spent some time in our room. A quiet man like that.\n\n17 Q. Thank you. And number 12, Esad Kiselica?\n\n18 A. Esad Kiselica is an electrician, I know that. And I know his\n\n19 father. He was not in my room, although I would see him from the window\n\n20 and in passing when we went to the restaurant. He was not in my room.\n\n21 Q. Did he disappear from the KP Dom?\n\n22 A. He disappeared from the KP Dom. He was there for some time and\n\n23 then he did not appear.\n\n24 Q. And number 13, Halim Konjo.\n\n25 A. Number 13, Halim Konjo. He had a private catering establishment.\n\nPage 771\n\n1 Son of Ahmed Konjo and his mother Nusa. I don't know about him from\n\n2 before he was in the camp, but I found out -- I don't know whether I\n\n3 should mention the name. I found out from a man who Milorad Krnojelac\n\n4 told that he had found him dead one morning in his office, that he died as\n\n5 a result of beatings. Now, should I name this person or not? It is\n\n6 really up to the Court.\n\n7 Q. Yes, you can name this person who told you.\n\n8 A. It is Rasim Jusufovic, a colleague, a former colleague of Milorad\n\n9 Krnojelac. They used to work together in a school.\n\n10 Q. When did --\n\n11 A. What did I say? Did I say Rasim Kiselica? What did I say,\n\n12 Jusufovic? It's Jusufovic.\n\n13 Q. Yes. You said Jusufovic, yes.\n\n14 A. Then it's all right.\n\n15 Q. When did Mr. Jusufovic tell you this?\n\n16 A. On the 31st of August, 1992, since he was deported with me to the\n\n17 town of Rozaje in Montenegro, together with 35 other inmates.\n\n18 Q. What did Mr. Jusufovic tell you about his conversation with\n\n19 Mr. Krnojelac?\n\n20 A. Well, he told me, among other things, what I told you now about\n\n21 Konjo, and he also told me that Krnojelac had said to him, \"Well, had I\n\n22 known yesterday that this would happen -- had I known what would be\n\n23 happening, I wish I could have died a day before that.\" I mean, he was\n\n24 referring to the day before he became what he became.\n\n25 Q. And let's move on in the list. You have already mentioned Adil\n\nPage 772\n\n1 Krajcin. Therefore, we go now to number 18, Omer Mujezinovic. What can\n\n2 you tell us about him?\n\n3 A. I don't know the name of Omer Mujezinovic. I knew a man called\n\n4 Omer Mujezinovic, but I think that he was killed in a car accident a lot\n\n5 before the war broke out. So I don't really know the name of Omer\n\n6 Mujezinovic in this context.\n\n7 Q. When you look at the numbers 21 to 23, you have several Rikalos\n\n8 listed. What can you tell us about them?\n\n9 A. These are three brothers. I don't know which order you've put,\n\n10 but the one under number 21 is the oldest. I know that. He's an\n\n11 electrician. And now as far as 22 and 23 are concerned, they're brothers\n\n12 too. All three are brothers. But I don't know out of these remaining two\n\n13 which one is the middle one and which is the youngest one.\n\n14 One of them went on the 28th of June in that big group and the\n\n15 other one remain. I don't know which one is the younger one and which one\n\n16 is the older one out of these two. I just know that they were Rikalos and\n\n17 nothing else.\n\n18 Q. And all three of them disappeared or --\n\n19 A. I don't know about the middle one. One of them remained. I don't\n\n20 know which one it was. I don't know what happened to him. And 29 was in\n\n21 this group, Veiz Zulfo, unless I've mentioned him already; Nurko Nisic,\n\n22 all these names I mentioned.\n\n23 Q. You have not yet mentioned the person number 25, Kemal Tulek.\n\n24 A. I know who that is. I know he was in the camp. But he was not\n\n25 with me in my room. He was not with me in my room.\n\nPage 773\n\n1 Q. And you have already mentioned Mr. Dzemal Vahida, and you have\n\n2 described to us that he was beaten on several occasions. When did you see\n\n3 him for the last time in the KP Dom?\n\n4 A. Unfortunately, I saw him the last time on the 28th of June. He\n\n5 was also in this group. Dzemal Vahida is also a policeman. He also left\n\n6 in this group.\n\n7 Q. Witness, you have described to us and you have pointed out to us\n\n8 the room where you actually saw beatings happen. Could you hear the sound\n\n9 of beating or screaming from other parts of the administration building\n\n10 while you were detained?\n\n11 A. In this part that is in front of us, specifically Enes Uzunovic,\n\n12 he would be moaning so badly when he was beaten. I don't even know how to\n\n13 express myself. He sounded like an animal.\n\n14 Q. Yes, but my question was a different one. Did you hear beatings\n\n15 from other parts of the administration building other than the part you\n\n16 have pointed out to us already on the photos?\n\n17 A. Well, I could not hear. I did not hear. I only heard from the\n\n18 entrance and around the entrance because that was nearby. I could not\n\n19 hear from over there where the windows were closed. I mean, my answer is\n\n20 no.\n\n21 Q. Thank you. How did these beatings and this screaming affect you\n\n22 personally?\n\n23 A. It created a nervousness psychologically. Well, it is\n\n24 psychological. You know, every normal person is afraid for his own life.\n\n25 If you see that the person next to you was taken away, beaten up, and\n\nPage 774\n\n1 you're expecting to be the next one, you can imagine what it was like. It\n\n2 was awful; it was terrible; it was so sad; it was murderous.\n\n3 Q. Besides these beatings you have described to us, did you ever see\n\n4 a detainee being beaten in the yard or in the canteen or on the way to the\n\n5 canteen?\n\n6 A. Well, there were slaps, slight kicks or slight blows with a hand.\n\n7 But anything that would be prepared specifically, well, no. I mean, you'd\n\n8 walk by and he'd hit you or kick you, things like that.\n\n9 Q. When you say \"he,\" who do you mean? Anyone in particular?\n\n10 A. The guard. Any guard. Perhaps there are only a few honourable\n\n11 exceptions; one man for sure.\n\n12 Q. Were detainees taken out for exchanges while you were there,\n\n13 before you were taken, actually?\n\n14 A. They were taken out. All were taken out, in fact, under the\n\n15 pretext of being taken away for exchanges. Perhaps they never got there.\n\n16 Nobody was ever told that they were being taken out to be liquidated.\n\n17 Everybody was taken out -- I mean, these people would look very happy,\n\n18 they would be pleased to be going to be exchanged, but ...\n\n19 Q. How many detainees were taken out for exchange before you were\n\n20 exchanged? Do you recall the number, the approximate number?\n\n21 A. I mean, I can't remember. Quite a few were taken away, for sure.\n\n22 In August, quite a lot of men were taken out in groups; sometimes 10,\n\n23 sometimes 15 or 20. I did not keep any statistics; I mean, even in normal\n\n24 circumstances, I'm not a statistics expert so I would not keep statistical\n\n25 records. But I just know ...\n\nPage 775\n\n1 Q. Did you see these detainees later on or did some of them\n\n2 disappear?\n\n3 A. I never saw any of these men who were taken away before I was.\n\n4 Q. Did the Red Cross come to the KP Dom while you were there?\n\n5 A. Yes, once. I can't remember the date exactly when this happened.\n\n6 A woman came from the International Red Cross with an interpreter. I\n\n7 think it was a young girl from Foca; I did not recognise her but these\n\n8 younger ones did. She was a young girl.\n\n9 As soon as the woman walked in, Slavko Koroman showed up and said,\n\n10 \"You can't put any questions. You can't talk here. There is Serb\n\n11 authority here. We are here to approve what will be discussed and what\n\n12 will not be discussed.\"\n\n13 Outside there was a group of journalists, photographers, whatever\n\n14 there might have been. They didn't let them come in. They were between\n\n15 those two buildings, the area that I said looked like a park. They gave\n\n16 some cigarettes to those people, those inmates, who were at windows. So\n\n17 they didn't really complete the job they had set out to complete. They\n\n18 had never come again until I was released on the 30th of August. So I was\n\n19 not even registered as an inmate.\n\n20 Q. Mr. Koroman, who was that? What was his function?\n\n21 A. I don't know. I was not anyone who could give orders to Koroman,\n\n22 or I was not his employer. He was there all the time. He was a former\n\n23 guard in the KP Dom. I think he was a retiree. He lived near me. I\n\n24 don't know about these details, whether he had retired or not, but the\n\n25 fact remains that he was in the camp all the time.\n\nPage 776\n\n1 On one occasion I talked to him a bit. Actually, on that day I\n\n2 was taken to the transfusion department in hospital because I wanted to\n\n3 give blood for a man who needed blood. I had a blood group, B negative,\n\n4 which was very rare; at least in Foca it was rare. So I gave blood for\n\n5 this person.\n\n6 And then when I returned, I saw Koroman in the compound. He was\n\n7 taking Sacir Smajkan, holding him under the arm. He was a judge, this\n\n8 Sacir Smajkan, as far as I can remember. His T-shirt was bloody around\n\n9 the neck; he was barefoot, dirty. He was a sight to behold. He looked\n\n10 awful.\n\n11 When he put him up there, I was standing in front of the\n\n12 restaurant and he said, \"What's up?\" and I said, \"Well, I had been giving\n\n13 blood and now I'm waiting for the people from my room to come so that we\n\n14 can go and have lunch in the restaurant, and I want to take advantage of\n\n15 the sunshine now.\" He said to me, \"Go into the shade a bit. You won't\n\n16 feel well,\" and I said, \"What happened to Sacir?\" and he said, \"Well,\n\n17 leave this full alone. He got drunk. Look what he looks like.\"\n\n18 Afterwards I heard a completely different story. Sacir said that\n\n19 he was beaten up and then brought in the way he looked then and handed\n\n20 over to Koroman in the camp. That's what I know. I don't know any other\n\n21 details.\n\n22 Q. Witness, you said you donated blood. Did you do that voluntarily?\n\n23 A. Yes. Well, I mean, you can treat it any way you want to now. I\n\n24 did not refuse it; I gave it voluntarily. But then can you understand\n\n25 what would have happened to me if I said a resolute no? I mean, I don't\n\nPage 777\n\n1 even know myself what would have happened to me. But I didn't want\n\n2 anything bad to happen to me, so as a precaution I agreed to donate\n\n3 blood.\n\n4 Q. Does that mean you were asked specifically to donate blood because\n\n5 of your rare blood group?\n\n6 A. Well, perhaps that way. I don't know exactly who came to the door\n\n7 of our room and said, \"Who has blood group B negative?\" And then perhaps\n\n8 because I was afraid or whatever, I felt as if he were looking at me, as\n\n9 if he had fixed his gaze on me, so what else could I have done but said\n\n10 that I had that group?\n\n11 He drove me to hospital. There was another former inmate there of\n\n12 Serb ethnicity. Rade Baralic, I think his name was, from Banja Luka, from\n\n13 somewhere around Banja Luka. He also donated blood together with me.\n\n14 Q. Thank you. Now let's talk about the camp commander. Who was the\n\n15 warden of the camp during the war?\n\n16 A. I repeat once again: I'm only talking about the period that I\n\n17 spent in the camp. As for everything that was before that or after that,\n\n18 I'm not going to talk about that and I don't want to talk about that.\n\n19 While I was in the camp, the warden was Milorad Krnojelac.\n\n20 Q. How do you know this? How did you get this information that he\n\n21 was the warden?\n\n22 A. Well, I got this information -- I mean, I saw the man a few times,\n\n23 perhaps five or six times, as he was passing from the administrative\n\n24 building. Also there were his security people, and he wore an officer's\n\n25 uniform. I mean, it was no secret. His guards knew; those who were\n\nPage 778\n\n1 subordinated to him, they knew who their warden was. I mean, it's not any\n\n2 secret.\n\n3 Q. But who told you? Did the guards tell you?\n\n4 A. A guard told me --\n\n5 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Objection. Your Honours, I think\n\n6 that first he should be asked whether somebody had told him, and only\n\n7 then, who, and not putting this kind of leading question, \"Who was it who\n\n8 told you this? Was it a guard?\" It is a leading question. I think that\n\n9 first he should be asked whether anybody told him, who told him, and so\n\n10 on. The question contains an answer that is actually being elicited from\n\n11 the witness.\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: I think your point is a good one, Mr. Bakrac, but may\n\n13 I remind you again: It's not made better by repeating it twice.\n\n14 He hasn't actually said that he was told by the guards. What he\n\n15 has said was, \"I got this information,\" and then he doesn't go on to\n\n16 explain from where; and then some lines later, he says, \"His guards knew;\n\n17 those who were subordinated to him ...\"\n\n18 Now, you have drawn the conclusion that he had been told by the\n\n19 guards, but he really should give that evidence himself.\n\n20 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Yes, thank you, Your Honour.\n\n21 Q. So how did you get the information that he was the warden?\n\n22 A. I got this information -- I mean, it wasn't only I; everybody, we\n\n23 all got this information. After all, I mean, certain guards -- well,\n\n24 again, I'm saying I don't want to mention specific names. But we had\n\n25 pretty good contacts with some of the guards. I'm saying there were not\n\nPage 779\n\n1 very many of them, but there were some. Some would even give us\n\n2 cigarettes. Somebody was friends with one of them; some with the other.\n\n3 But I think that the real information is from the very opening of\n\n4 the camp, and I think it was precisely the guards who were saying this.\n\n5 And then as things developed, it was then established that that's the way\n\n6 it was.\n\n7 Q. Did you also hear from inmates, from other inmates that\n\n8 Mr. Krnojelac was the warden?\n\n9 A. Absolutely. Absolutely. Everybody. There's not a single\n\n10 detainee, a single inmate. I'm claiming that there's not a single one who\n\n11 had spent any amount of time in the camp without knowing who the warden\n\n12 was. It's absurd to ask that. But then, of course, this is a court, so\n\n13 the truth has to be established. And it's not for me to judge. It's up\n\n14 to me to say what I know, right?\n\n15 Q. Yes. Exactly. And did you know Mr. Krnojelac from before the\n\n16 war?\n\n17 A. I knew him.\n\n18 Q. Do you know who appointed him as the warden?\n\n19 A. I don't know, but probably the ruling party. I don't know who.\n\n20 Probably the SDS. Who else would? I don't know.\n\n21 Q. Why do you think that?\n\n22 A. Well, I know -- I know even in normal circumstances that a ruling\n\n23 party appoints persons to certain responsible posts. They don't appoint\n\n24 someone from a different party or somebody who is not a member of any\n\n25 party. That is my assumption. That is my personal opinion.\n\nPage 780\n\n1 Q. Do you know if Mr. Krnojelac had a position in the SDS; that he\n\n2 was a member?\n\n3 A. I'm not aware of that. I was not a member of the SDS or the SDA.\n\n4 I don't know how many there were. I was not a member of any party, so I\n\n5 cannot make any claims. I mean, I could only guess. But I guess, I\n\n6 guess, that he was a supporter of that party. I don't know. I'm not\n\n7 making any claims. Let me be quite clear on that.\n\n8 Q. Thank you, Witness. You said that you saw him several times.\n\n9 When did you see him? What time of the day was it?\n\n10 A. During the day. During the day. During the course of the day.\n\n11 Not during the night. During the day, within the compound. I would see\n\n12 him over there, for example, towards the restaurant or as he was going to\n\n13 the administrative building. Then there was always someone with him.\n\n14 Probably his subordinates, security people or something.\n\n15 Q. What was he wearing when you saw him?\n\n16 A. An olive-green/grey officer's uniform.\n\n17 Q. And could you see if he had a weapon?\n\n18 A. Perhaps a pistol but not any big weapons. He didn't have any big\n\n19 weapons in his hands like an automatic rifle when I saw him. I'm telling\n\n20 you about what I saw and about the time when I was in the camp.\n\n21 Q. And speaking of Mr. Krnojelac, is this the accused here in the\n\n22 courtroom?\n\n23 A. Yes.\n\n24 Q. Let me put to you at this point what the accused himself says\n\n25 about his position. He said that the KP Dom, during the war, had two\n\nPage 781\n\n1 separate sections, a military part and a civilian part. The Muslim\n\n2 detainees were in the military part and the normal convicts were in the\n\n3 civil part, and he had nothing to do with the military part.\n\n4 What do you say to this?\n\n5 A. If I understood this correctly, Muslim detainees were in the\n\n6 military part, in the military part of the prison.\n\n7 Q. Yes. That's what Mr. Krnojelac claims.\n\n8 A. For goodness sake. I'm a Muslim. I was there. Where was I taken\n\n9 prisoner? What kind of a soldier was I? What kind of a soldier was a\n\n10 14-year-old boy? What kind of a soldier was an 84-year-old man? I think\n\n11 it's not true, and such things simply do not hold.\n\n12 Q. Witness, Mr. Krnojelac doesn't claim that you were a prisoner of\n\n13 war, he only says the Muslims were kept in a military part that he had no\n\n14 dealings with.\n\n15 What I would like to know from you is was there this division, a\n\n16 division between a military part and a civilian part?\n\n17 A. No. No. I state with full responsibility that there were not any\n\n18 military prisoners while I was in the camp. While I was in the camp, I\n\n19 repeat, no military was brought into the camp nor were there any military\n\n20 persons there. All of these persons were civilians.\n\n21 Q. Witness, you have already mentioned Mr. Todovic. When you saw him\n\n22 in the prison, what was he wearing?\n\n23 A. Are you talking about his clothes?\n\n24 Q. Yes. Yes.\n\n25 A. He had military olive-green/grey uniform on.\n\nPage 782\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12 Blank page inserted to ensure pagination corresponds between the French and\n\n13 English transcripts.\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nPage 783\n\n1 Q. And did he have a weapon?\n\n2 A. I did not see one, really. I mean, I don't remember seeing one.\n\n3 Q. And how did Mr. Todovic behave towards the detainees?\n\n4 A. Well, I said already. He assigned me to work and then, as far as\n\n5 I'm concerned, I didn't have any other contacts with him. What happened\n\n6 happened after working in the kitchen for three days, and I went to\n\n7 solitary confinement, and after back to my Room 11.\n\n8 Well, for the most part, appointed people -- I mean, I think his\n\n9 role was to assign people to various kinds of work, I mean, convicts and\n\n10 inmates.\n\n11 Q. Thank you. Witness, when were you released?\n\n12 A. On the 30th of August, 1992.\n\n13 Q. And how many detainees were released with you?\n\n14 A. In the first attempt there were 55 men on the bus, but that bus\n\n15 got as far as Niksic, roughly, and a white Golf intercepted the bus. The\n\n16 bus stopped. Pero Elez then came onto the bus, looked around, look\n\n17 around, and told the driver to go back.\n\n18 Q. Let me interrupt you briefly. Pero Elez, who was that?\n\n19 A. Well, Pero Elez was another of the former guards in KP Dom, as far\n\n20 as I know, and who had been retired because of poor nerves or something.\n\n21 I did not see him either on the eve of the war or during the war or\n\n22 that -- I am told he was a Chetnik leader, but whether it's true or not, I\n\n23 don't know, but he must have been something if he had the authority to\n\n24 tell the bus with inmates to turn back.\n\n25 Q. And was this in Montenegro?\n\nPage 784\n\n1 A. Yes. Yes, in Montenegro.\n\n2 Q. Yes. Please continue with your narrative. What happened?\n\n3 A. Well, that bus went back and that car was in front of us and took\n\n4 us to the KP Dom. Meanwhile, he disappeared somewhere and we went back\n\n5 into the KP Dom. To repeat, it was 55 men.\n\n6 After we came back, they put us again in Room 11, that blasted\n\n7 Room 11 once again, but there was nobody else there. They must have\n\n8 distributed the others in other rooms to replenish them, but there was\n\n9 nobody there.\n\n10 Some 10 minutes or so later, Bozo Pejic comes with a list of paper\n\n11 and calls out 20 names out of those 55 men, and says, \"Get ready quickly.\n\n12 You're to be exchanged.\"\n\n13 That's how it was. He took them away and -- and the 35 of us\n\n14 stayed behind. Then again, after some 10, 15, 20 minutes, more or less -\n\n15 doesn't matter - we were told to get ready and go. So we went down to the\n\n16 administrative building and then out. There was a bus parked. And once\n\n17 again, Savo Todovic turned up again, called out our names. We got onto\n\n18 the bus. He drew out our attention that the bus had curtains inside, drew\n\n19 our attention -- warned us not to look through the windows or else\n\n20 something bad might happen. And we were driven away. We were taken away\n\n21 along the same route, and sometime in the evening hours, the night had\n\n22 already fallen, we arrived to Scepan Polje, which is the boundary between\n\n23 Montenegro and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the drivers then -- the bus drivers\n\n24 then went to a wooden shed which I suppose was the border authority or\n\n25 something, with that list of ours names, and uniformed individuals in\n\nPage 785\n\n1 military uniforms then came onto the bus, beat us - I suppose we shall be\n\n2 suffering the effects of that to the end of our lives - with automatic\n\n3 rifle butts, on the backs, all over the body, and there was about half an\n\n4 hour of that ill-treatment and they got off. And the drivers came back\n\n5 with the list in their hands and we went on.\n\n6 Q. Witness, let me interrupt you here. You said that 20 persons were\n\n7 singled out from your group as it was in the beginning?\n\n8 A. Yes.\n\n9 Q. What kind of people were singled out? Did they have anything in\n\n10 common?\n\n11 A. I wouldn't say anything. It was just like that. Or perhaps\n\n12 somebody knew those men for some reason. I mean, I don't know. I don't\n\n13 see anything there. There were two very old men. One was 84 and one\n\n14 60-something. But there were very young, in their 20s. So that -- I\n\n15 don't think anything -- there's anything that I might think that they were\n\n16 taken, singled out on the basis of some plan or something. Their names\n\n17 were just taken from the list. Why? I couldn't really ...\n\n18 Q. Can you tell us what happened to these people? Did you ever see\n\n19 any of them again?\n\n20 A. No, not -- unfortunately, never.\n\n21 Q. And when did you meet your family again and where?\n\n22 A. Well, you see that bus -- when you interrupted me -- so we went on\n\n23 with that bus. And in the morning, at daybreak or somewhere around 7.00,\n\n24 6.00, half past six thereabouts, Niksic, Titograd, Ivangrad called now\n\n25 Baronave [phoen], to a place called Rozaje. And slightly before Rozaje,\n\nPage 786\n\n1 we sort of were to go to Macedonia, and that is what Savo Todovic had\n\n2 said. But somewhere along the way between Baronave and Rozaje, Kunarac,\n\n3 the driver, because we knew one another, and he sort of showed to me to\n\n4 come to him, and I did so. And he said, \"I really don't know. I don't\n\n5 think that Macedonia will take you in. The best thing would be for me to\n\n6 leave you in Rozaje, because the Muslims are a majority then.\" And so I\n\n7 said, \"Well, do that. So leave us wherever.\" And that's how it was. The\n\n8 bus terminal in Rozaje, we stopped and --\n\n9 Q. Witness, we do not need all the details.\n\n10 A. Well, I was saying it because that is where I found my wife, who\n\n11 had arrived with a convoy -- left for Foca with a convoy 14 days before\n\n12 that.\n\n13 Q. Thank you. And you have already told us about your weight loss,\n\n14 and you have told us about your injuries you received during the beating.\n\n15 Did you suffer any permanent physical consequences as a result of the\n\n16 conditions or your beating in the KP Dom?\n\n17 A. Well, my mental health, psychologically, I'm not all right. And\n\n18 often -- now I know what my brother's name is, now I simply can't remember\n\n19 it. Yes, of course, there are consequences, but one has to live and go\n\n20 on.\n\n21 Q. What consequences? Do you mean -- these psychological\n\n22 consequences, what are they?\n\n23 A. Well, I have trouble sleeping; it's very seldom that I sleep more\n\n24 than two hours a night. I shake; my hands sweat; I'm very nervous.\n\n25 Q. Thank you, Witness.\n\nPage 787\n\n1 MS. UERTZ-RETZLAFF: Your Honour, these are the questions of the\n\n2 Prosecution.\n\n3 JUDGE HUNT: Thank you.\n\n4 Cross-examination?\n\n5 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honours.\n\n6 Cross-examined by Mr. Bakrac:\n\n7 Q. First, let me introduce myself to the witness and tell him that my\n\n8 name is Mihajlo Bakrac, and to wish him a good day. I represent here the\n\n9 accused Milorad Krnojelac. Good afternoon to you.\n\n10 In the beginning of your testimony, Witness, when asked by the\n\n11 Prosecutor, you said that in your building, some four or five Serbs had\n\n12 stayed in your building?\n\n13 A. Yes, I did say that.\n\n14 Q. Since you also said that Donje Polje was an area which was mostly\n\n15 Muslim, what was the ethnic ratio in your building?\n\n16 A. I think -- well, I need a little time to -- I believe it was\n\n17 half/half. There were 29 apartments, and there were 14 of one and 15 of\n\n18 the other, so I believe something like that. I do not know, but I think\n\n19 it was fairly -- fairly balanced, fairly even.\n\n20 JUDGE HUNT: May I point out that when you are both speaking the\n\n21 same language, you must pause before the answer is given and before the\n\n22 next question is asked so that the translators can keep up. Thank you.\n\n23 THE WITNESS: [Interpretation] I do apologise.\n\n24 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation]\n\n25 Q. Witness, will you be so kind and tell me if you remember an SDA\n\nPage 788\n\n1 rally in Foca.\n\n2 A. Yes, I remember that rally in Foca. Do I remember it. And\n\n3 (redacted), that rally.\n\n4 Q. Do you remember how many people attended the rally?\n\n5 A. I haven't finished my answer yet. I can tell you that I did not\n\n6 attend the rally, and at that time I was in my summer cottage, which is\n\n7 about 10 kilometres from my home.\n\n8 Believe me, if you mean my political option, I had none. I did\n\n9 not support any party, I never supported any party, and I am a\n\n10 peace-minded -- a passivist. So believe me, I did not attend it. I heard\n\n11 that very many people were there, that there was a rally and that very\n\n12 many people were there, but I was not present, neither I nor my family.\n\n13 Q. Witness, I want to be clear. I wasn't trying to intimate by my\n\n14 question that that was what I was driving at, whether you were a member.\n\n15 I do not doubt what you have just told us.\n\n16 What I want to know - and you have answered it in part, that you\n\n17 heard that very many people had been there - will you agree with me that\n\n18 it was said between 100.000 and 150.000, that is, those are the figures in\n\n19 the press and the rumour?\n\n20 A. I know only as much as you do. From the press, yes, the figure of\n\n21 100.000 was mentioned, but I did not see them. I mean, I did not.\n\n22 Q. Thank you. Do you remember if, in the statement that you made to\n\n23 the Prosecutor's Office in 1995, you spoke about the SDS rally which\n\n24 brought together 10.000 people?\n\n25 A. Again, I do not know how many people. Again, I can tell you that\n\nPage 789\n\n1 I wasn't there. It was in the football stadium. I know of the Sutjeska\n\n2 Club; that is what I do know. But again I was not there. I repeat: I\n\n3 was away. Because those rallies usually took place over the weekend, so\n\n4 that again I was out in my summer cottage and I wasn't in the town.\n\n5 Q. I agree. But I'm asking if it is correct that you said, \"I heard\n\n6 that there were some 10.000 people present\"?\n\n7 A. Well, I suppose so, I guess so. I don't remember anymore at all.\n\n8 You must know that it was a long time ago and I am of an advanced age. I\n\n9 may have said that I heard that. Just as I heard that there were about\n\n10 100.000 at that other rally, I may have heard that there were 10.000 at\n\n11 this one. But I wasn't at either of them, and you cannot say that I was\n\n12 present at a rally and I counted all those people present. That is what I\n\n13 heard.\n\n14 Q. Precisely, that is what I said, Witness. I did not say that you\n\n15 were there but --\n\n16 A. I know what you said. I know what you said.\n\n17 Q. Is it also true that in that statement you said that all the\n\n18 trouble started because of the aspiration of Serbs to come together, to be\n\n19 united in one state, and that includes that rally?\n\n20 A. Rally -- as a rally, I exclude, but I know what I heard around\n\n21 cafeterias and shops or at work. And even with my closest friends, I\n\n22 would have an argument. All Serbs in one state, that was the proclamation\n\n23 of the Serb Democratic Party, and you have to grant that. Well, you don't\n\n24 have to, but that was the proclamation of the Serb Democratic Party, of\n\n25 the SDS.\n\nPage 790\n\n1 So I'm not trying to underestimate, to understate, the\n\n2 proclamations of other parties, I'm not trying to do that, because I\n\n3 should say that on either side there were as many such things as you\n\n4 please.\n\n5 Q. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n6 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, my apologies. I'm\n\n7 trying to speed things up because I have a few questions on this subject,\n\n8 and I know how the Court wishes to learn about this subject. But certain\n\n9 things are important to me, and I'm simply trying to cut the answers\n\n10 short, just bearing in mind the time. I hope this is not being\n\n11 misinterpreted.\n\n12 JUDGE HUNT: You may get shorter answers if you ask different\n\n13 questions, if I may suggest that. But this business about the political\n\n14 rallies, surely, is of very minor importance. Whether there was an attack\n\n15 upon one or more civilian populations doesn't really matter. The\n\n16 Prosecution only has to prove that there was at least one, and the fact\n\n17 that there may have been an attack upon the Serb civilian population by\n\n18 the Muslims doesn't seem to affect that. So could we get on to what\n\n19 really is in issue here.\n\n20 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Your Honours, I understand this\n\n21 perfectly, but I think that the Prosecution also went into that. But I\n\n22 won't waste too much time. I only have two questions more on the\n\n23 subject.\n\n24 Q. So in line with what you just told us, didn't the Serbs already\n\n25 live in one state in the former Yugoslavia?\n\nPage 791\n\n1 A. Yes.\n\n2 Q. So why would they need another state, since they already had one\n\n3 state?\n\n4 A. Well, I wasn't in any political organisation so don't ask me that,\n\n5 please.\n\n6 Q. Now, my last question on the subject: In your view, in the area\n\n7 where the population distribution was roughly 50/50 and at a meeting of\n\n8 one ethnically-oriented party we have 100.000, 150.000, and the other one\n\n9 is attended by 10.000 people, doesn't that represent real grounds for fear\n\n10 of that side which could bring together only 10.000 people at a rally?\n\n11 A. Sir, this is again a political issue and I'm not a\n\n12 politically-minded person. Thank you for asking me those questions, and\n\n13 they are quite decent questions, but please don't try to embroil, to\n\n14 involve me in politics because I have nothing to --\n\n15 Q. Very well. Very well. Thank you. I shall move on to some\n\n16 specific matters that you mentioned in your testimony.\n\n17 Is it true that in your statement you told the investigators of\n\n18 The Hague Tribunal, on the 4th and 5th September of 1995 -- that you made\n\n19 a statement to them?\n\n20 A. Yes, yes, it is.\n\n21 Q. Did you make this statement of your own volition?\n\n22 A. I did.\n\n23 Q. Is it correct that to the investigators of The Hague Tribunal you\n\n24 gave yet another statement on the 14th of November, 1998?\n\n25 A. Yes.\n\nPage 792\n\n1 JUDGE HUNT: Mr. Bakrac, it may be a small point but it is an\n\n2 important one: The investigators are not the investigators of The Hague\n\n3 Tribunal, they are the investigators of the Office of the Prosecutor,\n\n4 which is completely independent of the Tribunal. It may be different in\n\n5 other countries, but in the system we work under, there is no relationship\n\n6 between the Prosecution and the Tribunal.\n\n7 MR. BAKRAC: [Interpretation] Thank you, Your Honours. My\n\n8 apologies. The legal system that I come from is somewhat different;\n\n9 hence, this.\n\n10 Q. So you made both those statements of your own free will.\n\n11 A. Yes.\n\n12 Q. So will you please explain: Did you, in 1995, remember better --\n\n13 did you have a better recollection of the events in 1995 than in 1998?\n\n14 A. Of course, 100 per cent. And I'm sure that this year I don't know\n\n15 what I knew in 1998. Senility, I think, is a natural phenomenon so that\n\n16 that's how things are.\n\n17 Q. Then how do you explain that -- I'm referring to the incident\n\n18 which, to say the least, was very unpleasant to you, that is, the incident\n\n19 of the 26th of June --\n\n20 A. I think it was the 25th.\n\n21 Q. Yes, I apologise, the 25th. That about the incident of the 25th\n\n22 of June which happened in the evening hours - you said about 10.00, half\n\n23 past - how is it possible that then, in 1995 - now you tell us that you\n\n24 remember that event best - how is it that, in 1995, you told the\n\n25 investigators of the Prosecutor's Office that what you saw was an incident\n\nPage 793\n\n1 which had taken place in the passage of the administrative building?\n\n2 A. Sir, that part of the administrative building is all passage to\n\n3 me, that ground floor, and windows also are part of that, because I went\n\n4 through that passage four or five times. Once I entered; secondly, I went\n\n5 for a visit; that is, when my wife came to visit me, I was again there and\n\n6 I had a guard standing beside me. And that did not look like an office to\n\n7 me. Once, when I went to load flour, I also went through it, and twice as\n\n8 they were escorting us through, and it simply looked like a passage to\n\n9 me. It doesn't look like a room, like a furnished room. It simply looked\n\n10 like a passage. I think that is the only misunderstanding. There can be\n\n11 no other misunderstanding about that.\n\n12 Q. Did the Prosecutor's investigators show you the photographs w"
