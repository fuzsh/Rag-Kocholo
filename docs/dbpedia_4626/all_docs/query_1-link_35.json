        "text": "Note from the dramaturge Božo Koprivica\n\nKANJOŠ MACEDONOVIC, WE WISH YOU LUCK IN THE NEW LIFE!\n\n(…) In all three dramas connected to the Paštrovićs - Kanjoš Macedonović, Jegor’s Road and Don Krsto, Vida Ognjenović captures the tone and dialect of Montenegrin seaside, in a way that represents a true rarity. In a way, dramas by Vida Ognjenović achieve a distance (everything has been elevated at one meter high from the ground), and then, everything seems authentic. There is sincerity, we believe in what a character says. I am confident that the language will provide for long stage lives of these plays. (...)\n\nWorld premiere of Vida Ognjenović’s Kanjoš Macedonović in Budva, in summer of 1989, was produced as an epoch, as the time of the legend of Kanjoš Macedonović. In environment, costumes and in rhythm. (...)\n\nIn the new production, Vida Ognjenović moves the plot in the period between the two world wars. Thus, the relationship between the Paštrovićs and Venetians, little ones and big ones, could be interpreted as stripping the coating of gold from epic understanding of history. From the lamenting concept of history. “Luka, it will be heroic and pride worthy! We will mourn after you beautifully! Each and every one of us will visit your grave when we come to Venice! Kanjoš: I’m afraid you wouldn’t be able to find it…” (...)\n\nIn the new life of Kanjoš Macedonović, from the opening scenes we witness claustrophobia, cruelty of confined society towards all those who try to play their game, to disobey parts of social and religious laws. (…) In the drama, we see a confrontation between characters who tend to overstep limits (Daskale, Vukac, Vidosava, Ivka, Stevan, Rade, Father Filimon) and those who stand guard to the rules with their status, tradition, rigidness, retaliation (Stijepo, Katna, Father Gerasim...). (...)\n\nKanjoš experiences love as shame, as uneasiness, as witchcraft, as melodrama and as eroticism. Love games are written with superb skill (Kanjoš would make an excellent screenplay for a film). (…) Unreturned, suppressed love leads to self-destruction, the wish for self-destruction comes from restraints to show emotion in an epic environment. The only defence from self-destruction is a carnival. The vortex of irrational, extraordinary, represents one of the most beautiful scenes in the new Kanjoš. Kanjoš, as a musical, as the midsummer’s night. (…)\n\nThis piece by Vida Ognjenović reveals its secret in the dialogue between Furlan and Kanjoš. The secret of a tragic misunderstanding between David and Goliath. Only, in this case, Kanjoš is David, a mercenary, hired assassin, while Furlan is Goliath, seasoned sailor who has “conquered cities by his spear” for the Doge, he is the one who recognizes the arrival and mechanism of upcoming fascism. (…)\n\nLove chorus: Ivka-Kanjoš and Furlan-Doge’s Daughter in 3rd act brings in the elements of melodrama, as in other Vida Ognjenović’s dramas. Nobility and melancholy. In such circumstances, fascism becomes even more obvious, it seems increasingly cruel and crude. Tremendous importance is in the story of lack of recognition, of indifference, regarding fascism that grows like a cancer. Moreover, it grinds our lives. New Kanjoš as the final warning. And defence and(or) last days. Time for new idols. The world has changed so much, it tilted towards evil, malice and wrong, that even tomorrow, everything could disappear if we do not stand tall. The language of fascism gaining momentum is squealing, mumbling and talking nonsense, belching while singing. A group consists of cashiers, conductors, literary classics, scholars. Behold the language, the richness of language in Kanjoš Macedonović by Vida Ognjenović! Therefore, at times, just close your eyes and listen. Listen and observe, because Kanjoš portrays certain disappearing concepts: victim, shame, friendship, love. Let us reinstate shame, as an aesthetic category and that will make an immense step forward. The first step. (…)\n\nLegend about Kanjoš and his achievement in new history, has been transformed into a legend about a pigeon breeder. Nowadays, it is a sign of Venetian charity and kindness. Fascism strives to represent death camps as places of mercy, or as places that never existed. New Kanjoš faces the fascism with humour, melody of language, beauty. Kanjoš set off for Venice and arrived just before Easter, at the most beautiful time of year.\n\nThe most beautiful time of year in Belgrade is October (…) and we wish you luck in your new life, Kanjoš Macedonović!
