        "text": "The minority cultural autonomy model, as firstly theorized by the eminent Austro Marxists Karl Renner and Otto Bauer, is said to guarantee, if properly implemented, minority protection and state stability. For a variety of reasons this model is clearly overrepresented in the region of the former \"Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\", mostly in Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. Its effectiveness, however, in minority protection in the area is under question. In some cases the right to self-proclamation in order to be registered in minority electoral catalogues is compromised (Slovenia e. g.) or partly violated (Serbia e. g.), in others the minority councils merely have a decorative 'advisory' role (Croatia, e. g.) and enjoy but an insufficient legitimacy due to their partial indirect election (Serbia e. g.), while in all cases they have no legislative or taxing powers and enjoy inadequate state funding. In such circumstances, if the model is to make any significant contribution to minority protection it has to be improved in the direction the Austro-Marxists proposed and the Advisory Committee of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities has recently opined. Otherwise, it would be better to abandon the term as an analytical tool since in its present forms it offers autonomy only by euphemism, serving more as a state strategy for minority patronage than as an effective device for minority protection.\n\nThe 2009 Law on National Councils of National Minorities (LNCNM) created a new system of self� governance for ethnic minorities, over onesixth of the population, in the Republic of Serbia. The law establishes the legal framework for and empowers national minority councils (NMCs) to legitimately represent members of their respective minorities in matters of culture, education, the media, and official use of language, as pertaining to each minority. The NMCs can create institutions, organizations, and forprofit companies to promote their interests. Ri ghts so granted vis�a�vis state organs are only con sultative in nature, but still significant enough to be considered a prototype of ethnic cultural autonomy. The councils receive budgetary funds for their work but can generate their own income and receive aid from foreign and international sources as well. The implementation, immediate consequences, and conflicts related to the LNCNM have a broad impact on ethnic politics in Serbia: th...\n\nThe 2009 Law on National Councils of National Minorities (LNCNM) created a new system of self-governance for ethnic minorities, over one-sixth of the population, in the Republic of Serbia. The law establishes the legal framework for and empowers national minority councils (NMCs) to legitimately represent members of their respective minorities in matters of culture, education, the media, and official use of language, as pertaining to each minority. The NMCs can create institutions, organizations, and for-profit companies to promote their interests. Rights so granted vis-à-vis state organs are only consultative in nature, but still significant enough to be considered a prototype of ethnic cultural autonomy. The councils receive budgetary funds for their work but can generate their own income and receive aid from foreign and international sources as well. The implementation, immediate consequences, and conflicts related to the LNCNM have a broad impact on ethnic politics in Serbia: they help determine how national minorities organize themselves to preserve their identity, what kind of relationships they develop, and how they relate to the Serbian state. This paper studies the precursors of the law and its implementation, the results and difficulties of the national minority councils, and suggests further research.\n\nThis paper examines opportunities and possibilities for national minority councils (NMC's) to serve as a channel for dialogue and cooperation between national minorities, governmental authorities and non-governmental organisations within the Republic of Serbia and across this state. The main objective of this paper is to review the constitutional and legal framework of trans-ethnic cooperation in Serbia. In order to achieve this, I am analysing the constitutional and legal status of NMC's, and their competences and role in the trans-ethnic cooperation in Serbia and across it. The model of trans-ethnic cooperation and its functioning in practice is analysed especially within the case study of the Slovak NMC in Serbia. The previous framework of cooperation was restricted by the decision of the Serbian Constitutional Court in 2014. Remaining opportunities and possibilities for NMC's in trans-ethnic cooperation are not fully used in practice. There is no systematic cooperation of the Slovak NMC with other organisations of ethnicities within and across Serbia. Trans-ethnic cooperation is not so common and is conducted usually on an ad hoc basis. Nevertheless, the existing institutional and legal model for trans-ethnic cooperation is relatively good. NMC's can and should be active agents fostering trans-ethnic cooperation in and beyond Serbia.\n\nThe article discusses the legal framework for establishing associations for minorities in Serbia. The Treaty on European Union (TEU) values the respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, and works to consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and the principles of international law. The Serbian Constitution allows for the formation of associations and organizations, including those created by minorities, that may have executive powers. Additionally, Serbia has ratified international and regional human rights instruments that provide for the protection of the rights of national minorities and freedom of association. If Serbia denies the right of minorities to create associations with executive powers, minorities can challenge Serbia's denial in domestic and international courts. Domestically, minorities in Serbia can challenge the constitutionality of any law or government action that limits their right to form associations with executive powers. In the international arena, minorities could potentially bring a case against Serbia before international human rights bodies."
