        "text": "Radionuclides and heavy metals in Borovac, Southern Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nPopovic, Dragana; Todorovic, Dragana; Frontasyeva, Marina; Ajtic, Jelena; Tasic, Mirjana; Rajsic, Slavica\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe paper presents the complex approach to the assessment of the state of the environment in Southern Serbia, surroundings of Bujanovac, the region which is of great concern as being exposed to contamination by depleted uranium (DU) ammunition during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) attacks in 1999. It includes studies on concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals in different environmental samples 5 years after the military actions. In October 2004, samples of soil, grass, lichen, moss, honey, and water were collected at two sites, in the immediate vicinity of the targeted area and 5 km away from it. Radionuclide ((7)Be, (40)K, (137)Cs, (210)Pb, (226)Ra, (232)Th, (235)U, (238)U) activities in solid samples were determined by standard gamma spectrometry and total alpha and beta activity in water was determined by proportional alpha-beta counting. Concentrations of 35 elements were determined in the samples of soil, moss, grass, and lichen by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The results are discussed in the context of a possible contamination by DU that reached the environment during the attacks as well as in the context of an environmental pollution by radionuclides and heavy metals in Southern Serbia. The results are compared to the state of environment in the region and other parts of the country both prior to and following the attacks. This is the first comprehensive study of the contents of radionuclides and heavy metals in Southern Serbia and consequently highly important for the assessment of the state of environment in this part of the country concerning possible effects of DU ammunition on the environment, as well as anthropogenic source of pollution by radionuclides and heavy metals and other elements. Also, the highly sensitive method of INAA was used for the first time to analyze the environmental samples from this area. The results of the study of radionuclides in the samples of soils, leaves, grass, moss, lichen\n\nEthnopharmacological uses of Sempervivum tectorum L. in southern Serbia: Scientific confirmation for the use against otitis linked bacteria.\n\nPubMed\n\nStojkoviÄ, Dejan; Barros, Lillian; PetroviÄ, Jovana; Glamoclija, Jasmina; Santos-Buelga, Celestino; Ferreira, Isabel C F R; SokoviÄ, Marina\n\n2015-12-24\n\nSempervivum tectorum L. (Crassulaceae), known as houseleek, is used in traditional medicine in the treatment of ear inflammation. It can be spread as a pack on wounds, sores, burns, and abscesses and also on painful areas attacked by gout as a refrigerant and astringent. Drinking tea prepared from leaves of S. tectorum is recommended for ulcer treatment. The present study was designed to investigate ethopharmacological use of S. tectorum in the southern Serbia and to further scientifically justify and confirm effectiveness of the leaf juice used in ethnomedicine for ear inflammation, against otitis linked bacteria. Ethnopharmacological survey on the use of S. tectorum in southern Serbia was performed using semi structured questionnaires via a face-to-face interview. Chemical composition of the leaf juice regarding phenolic compounds and organic acids was analyzed. Antimicrobial activity was tested on bacteria isolated from ear swabs of the patients suffering from the ear pain (otitis). Anti-quorum-sensing activities of the juice were further investigated on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethnopharmacological survey revealed the use of S. tectorum in southern Serbia for the treatment of ear pain, warts, cancer, stomachache, ulcer and high blood sugar level with the highest fidelity level (FL) for the ear pain. The phenolic composition of the S. tectorum leaf juice consisted of flavonol glycosides, with kaempferol-3-O-rhamnosyl-glucoside-7-O-rhamnoside as the majority compound. Organic acids composition revealed malic acid as the most dominant one. Antimicrobial and anti-quorum-sensing activities of the juice showed to be promising. Ethnopharmacological use of S. tectorum juice for treating ear pain is justified, since the juice possessed antimicrobial activity towards clinical isolates of bacteria linked to otitis.

Considering this fact, many human dirofilarial infections could be expected, however only about 30 cases in Serbia have been described until today. Aims of this survey were to assess the people reactivity to the antigens of D. repens and D. immitis and to identify risk factors for the contact exposure. Investigation included sera taken from 297 people (179 women and 118 men) living in different areas of Serbia (PanÄevo, Novi Sad, ZajeÄar, Leskovac, Vranje, NiÅ¡, Pirot). Sera were analysed by means of two indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) home-designed that use as antigens adult somatic/metabolic polyproteins of D. repens (DR) and D. immitis (DI), respectively. The results were elaborated using the statistical method of descriptive and quantitative analysis. Significant differences by area in the reactivity of human sera to dirofilarial antigens were not observed (p = 0.056). A high seroreactivity was demonstrated in people from the towns of northern Serbia (PanÄevo = 27,1%; Novi Sad = 16,3%), as well as in people from ZajeÄar (eastern Serbia = 15,8%) and Vranje (southern Serbia = 15,1%). No differences were evidenced between people reactivity to polyproteins of the two dirofilarial species, nor differences related to the gender of examinees. Factor risks evidenced were: i) place of residence; ii) spending work time outdoors during the mosquito season; iii) spending time outdoors and nearby rivers, lakes, swamps or canals; unespectedly, iv) cat owning. The findings emerging from this investigation indicate that clinicians and public health authorities should pay greater attention to this zoonosis. Continuing education and training of physicians will greatly contribute to the knowledge of the actual impact of filarial worms on animal and public health, and allow for the planning of suitable measures to prevent the infections.\n\nAstronomy development in Serbia in view of the IAU Strategic Plan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAtanackoviÄ, Olga\n\n2015-03-01\n\nAn overview of astronomy development in Serbia in view of the goals envisaged by the IAU Strategic Plan is given. Due attention is paid to the recent reform of education at all levels. In the primary schools several extra topics in astronomy are introduced in the physics course. Attempts are made to reintroduce astronomy as a separate subject in the secondary schools. Special emphasis is put to the role and activities of the Petnica Science Center the biggest center for informal education in SE Europe, and to a successful participation of the Serbian team in International astronomy olympiads. Astronomy topics are taught at all five state universities in Serbia. At the University of Belgrade and Novi Sad students can enroll in astronomy from the first study year. The students have the training at the Ondrejov Observatory (Czech Republic) and at the astronomical station on the mountain Vidojevica in southern Serbia. Astronomy research in Serbia is performed at the Astronomical Observatory, Belgrade and the Department of Astronomy, Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade. There are about 70 researchers in astronomy in Serbia (and about as many abroad) who participate in eight projects financed by the Ministry of Education and Science and in several international cooperations and projects: SREAC, VAMDC, Belissima (recruitment of experienced expatriate researchers), Astromundus (a 2-year joint master program with other four European universities), LSST. One of the goals in near future is twinning between universities in the SEE region and worldwide. The ever-increasing activities of 20 amateur astronomical societies are also given.\n\nScottish Women's Hospitals--the 90th anniversary of their work in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMikiÄ, Zelimir\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe Scottish Women's Hospitals (SWH), a unique health institution in the history of medicine, staffed entirely by women, was founded soon after the outbreak of the First World War, August 12, 1914 in Edinburgh, by the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. The founder and the main driving force behind this organisation was Dr. Elsie Inglis (1864-1917). Although her proposition to the British War Office had been rejected, she offered her services to the Allies (France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia). The first 200 bed SWH unit was sent to France in November 1914, and soon after followed other units, so at the end there were 13 very well equipped SWH units working in the various theatres of war in Belgium, Serbia, Russia, Rumania and Greece. The first unit of SWH came to Serbia in early January 1915, and was located at Kragujevac. Soon after, three other SWH units arrived to Serbia and were stationed at Mladenovac, Valjevo and Lazarevac. It was an enormous help to Serbia, full of wounded and sick people, due to the dreadful typhus epidemic which was devastating the country. A large SWH unit, attached to the Southern Slav Volunteer Division, had worked on the Dobrudja front, and there were three hospitals and a special transport unit on the Salonika Front, which were all engaged in the treatment of Serbian wounded soldiers until the end of the First World War. Two other SWH units, located in France, were treating the Serbian refugees. Serving bravely and honorably on the various theatres of war, the legendary Scottish Women's Hospitals made enormous contributions to the allied war efforts, and helped Serbian people a great deal.\n\nOn aging and aged care in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSevo, G; Davidovic, M; Erceg, P; Despotovic, N; Milosevic, D P; Tasic, M\n\n2015-06-01\n\nSerbia is a demographically old nation, with 17.4 % of its residents being aged 65 years and older in 2011. The previous two decades of turbulent history have significantly affected the demographic picture of this country, and their ramifications remain visible in Serbia's economic, political, cultural, and health spheres. Major demographic forces behind population aging in Serbia can be attributed to lower fertility rates, migrations, and declining mortality (reflecting improvements in overall health leading to a longer life expectancy). In Serbia, low fertility and migrations appear to play major roles, although the relative contribution of recent migrations cannot be measured with accuracy. Patterns of demographic aging vary considerably across different geographic, socioeconomic, and cultural settings. The common denominator throughout present day Serbia is extensive political and economic transition. One would expect that, given sufficient time, this process will result in improved population health, and yet, at this stage outcomes of major health care reform in Serbia are somewhat perplexing. For the second consecutive year, Serbia's health care system has been ranked at the very bottom of the scale among 34 European countries. It is then no surprise that the elderly represent particularly vulnerable population segment. This paper discusses some of the issues relevant to these demographic patterns of aging and aged care in contemporary Serbia, focusing on the period after 2000.\n\nRegional air pollution caused by a simultaneous destruction of major industrial sources in a war zone. The case of April Serbia in 1999\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVukmiroviÄ, Zorka B.; UnkaÅ¡eviÄ, Miroslava; LaziÄ, Lazar; ToÅ¡iÄ, Ivana\n\nDuring NATO's 78-day Kosovo war, 24 March-10 June 1999, almost daily attacks on major industrial sources have caused numerous industrial accidents in Serbia. These accidents resulted in releases of many hazardous chemical substances including the persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Detection of some important POPs in fine aerosol form took place at Xanthi in Greece and reported to the scientific world. The paper focuses on two pollution episodes: (a) 6-8 April; and (b) 18-20 April. Using the Eta model trajectory analysis, the regional pollutant transport from industrial sites in Northern Serbia (Novi Sad) and in the Belgrade vicinity (PanÄevo), respectively, almost simultaneously bombed at midnight between 17 and 18 April, corroborated measurements at Xanthi. At the same time the pollutant puff was picked up at about 3000 m and transported to Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Moldavia and the Black Sea. The low-level trajectories from PanÄevo below 1000 m show pollutant transport towards Belgrade area in the first 12 h. The POP washout in central and southern Serbia in the second episode was deemed to have constituted the principal removal mechanism. Maximum POP wet deposition was found in central Serbia and along the 850 hPa trajectory towards south-eastern Serbia and the Bulgarian border.\n\n31 CFR 586.308 - Government of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 31 Money and Finance: Treasury 3 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Government of the Republic of Serbia...

The northern Serbian region of Vojvodina is inhabited by Southern Slavic Serbian majority and, inter alia, Western Slavic (Slovak) and Eastern Slavic (Ruthenian) minorities. In the study, 15 autosomal STR markers were analysed in unrelated Slovaks, Ruthenians and Serbs from northern Serbia and western Slovakia. Additionally, Slovak males from Serbia were genotyped for 17 Y-chromosomal STR loci. The results were compared to data available for other Slavic populations. Genetic distances for autosomal markers revealed homogeneity between Serbs from northern Serbia and Slovaks from western Slovakia and distinctiveness of Serbian Slovaks and Ruthenians. Y-STR variation showed a clear genetic departure of the Slovaks and Ruthenians inhabiting Vojvodina from their Serbian neighbours and genetic similarity to the Northern Slavic populations of Slovakia and Ukraine. Admixture estimates revealed negligible Serbian paternal ancestry in both Northern Slavic minorities of Vojvodina, providing evidence for their genetic isolation from the Serbian majority population. No reduction of genetic diversity at autosomal and Y-chromosomal markers was found, excluding genetic drift as a reason for differences observed at autosomal STRs. Analysis of molecular variance detected significant population stratification of autosomal and Y-chromosomal microsatellites in the three Slavic populations of northern Serbia, indicating necessity for separate databases used for estimations of frequencies of autosomal and Y-chromosomal STR profiles in forensic casework. Our results demonstrate that regarding Y-STR haplotypes, Serbian Slovaks and Ruthenians fit in the Eastern European metapopulation defined in the Y chromosome haplotype reference database.

In accordance with the general definition of prevailing wind, two special definitions of this term are used. The seasonal wind roses in 16 directions at each station are analyzed. This study shows that the prevailing winds in Northern Serbia have northwestern and southeastern directions. Circulation weather types over Serbia are presented in order to determine the connections between the synoptic circulations and prevailing surface winds. Three controlling pressure centers, i.e., the Mediterranean cyclone, Siberian high, and the Azores anticyclone, appear as the most important large-scale factors that influence the creation of the prevailing winds over Northern Serbia. Beside the synoptic cause of the prevailing winds, it is noted that the orography of the eastern Balkans has a major influence on the winds from the second quadrant. It was found that the frequencies of circulation weather types are in agreement with those of the prevailing winds over Northern Serbia.\n\nSuicide in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nIlic, M; Ilic, I\n\n2016-03-15\n\nSuicide remains a significant public health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the mortality trend of suicide in Serbia for the years 1991-2014. Data on persons who died of suicide and self-inflicted injury (site codes E950-E959 revision 9 and X60-X84 revision 10 of the International Classification of Diseases to classify death, injury and cause of death) were obtained from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia. The age standardized rate was calculated by direct method (per 100,000 persons, using Segi's World population as standard population). Average annual percentage change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was computed for trend using the joinpoint regression analysis. Total 33,930 (24,016 men and 9914 women) suicide deaths occurred in Serbia during the observed period, with the average annual age-standardized mortality rate being 12.7 per 100,000 inhabitants (19.5 per 100,000 in men and 6.7 per 100,000 in women). Suicide mortality in all age groups was higher among men than women. In both genders, suicide rates were highest in the oldest age group. Significantly decreased trend in suicide mortality was recorded continuously from 1991 to 2014 (AAPC=-1.9%, 95%CI -2.2 to -1.6). The most frequently used suicide method in both genders was hanging, strangulation or suffocation with 61.2% off all suicides. Changes in mortality rates were significant both for suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives (AAPC=-1.5% (AAPC=-1.5% in men and -3.1%-3.1% in women) and for suicide by hanging, strangulation, and suffocation (AAPC=-1.2% (AAPC=-1.2% in men and -3.0%-3.0% in women). In men, nonsignificant increase in suicide by firearms, air guns and explosives observed during the period 1991-1997 (by +6.1% per year) was followed by a significant decrease until 2014 (by -3.1% per year). The significantly increased mortality in suicide by firearms, air guns, and explosives was observed in older men (aged 40-69 years and 80\n\n31 CFR 586.204 - Prohibited new investment within Serbia.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

In these areas, Upper Paleozoic terrigenous sediments are overlain by Lower Triassic siliciclastics and limestones and by Anisian shallow-water carbonates. A pronounced facies change to hemipelagic and distal turbiditic, cherty metalimestones (Kopaonik Formation) testifies a Late Anisian drowning of the former shallow-water carbonate shelf. Sedimentation of the Kopaonik Formation was contemporaneous with shallow-water carbonate production on nearby carbonate platforms that were the source areas of diluted turbidity currents reaching the depositional area of this formation. The Kopaonik Formation was dated by conodont faunas as Late Anisian to Norian and possibly extends into the Early Jurassic. It is therefore considered an equivalent of the grey Hallstatt facies of the Eastern Alps, the Western Carpathians, and the Albanides-Hellenides. The coeval carbonate platforms were generally situated in more proximal areas of the Adriatic margin, whereas the distal margin was dominated by hemipelagic/pelagic and distal turbiditic sedimentation, facing the evolving Neotethys Ocean to the east. A similar arrangement of Triassic facies belts can be recognized all along the evolving Meliata-Maliac-Vardar branch of Neotethys, which is in line with a âone-ocean-hypothesisâ for the Dinarides: all the ophiolites presently located southwest of the Drina-Ivanjica and Kopaonik thrust sheets are derived from an area to the east, and the Drina-Ivanjica and Kopaonik units emerge in tectonic windows from below this ophiolite nappe. On the base of the Triassic facies distribution we see neither argument for an independent Dinaridic Ocean nor evidence for isolated terranes or blocks.\n\nEndoparasitic fauna of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and golden jackals (Canis aureus) in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nIliÄ, Tamara; Becskei, Zsolt; PetroviÄ, TamaÅ¡; PolaÄek, Vladimir; RistiÄ, Bojan; MiliÄ, SiniÅ¡a; StepanoviÄ, Predrag; RadisavljeviÄ, Katarina; DimitrijeviÄ, Sanda\n\n2016-03-01\n\nWild canides have a high epizootiological - epidemiological significance, considering that they are hosts for some parasites which spread vector born diseases. Increased frequency of certain interactions between domestic and wild canides increases the risk of occurrence, spreading and maintaining the infection of parasitic etiology in domestic canides. The research was conducted in 232 wild canides (172 red foxes and 60 golden jackals). The examined material was sampled from foxes and jackals, which were hunted down between 2010 and 2014, from 8 epizootiological areas of Serbia (North-BaÄka, West-BaÄka, Southern-Banat, MoraviÄki, Zlatiborski, RaÅ¡ki, Rasinski and ZajeÄarski district). On completing the parasitological dissection and the coprological diagnostics, in wild canides protozoa from the genus Isospora were identified, 3 species of trematoda (Alaria alata, Pseudamphistomum truncatum and Metagonimus yokogawai), cestods from the genus Taenia and 5 species of nematodes (Toxocara canis, Ancylostomatidae, Trichuris vulpis and Capillaria aerophila). The finding of M. yokogawai in golden jackals were, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first diagnosed cases of metagonimosis in golden jackals in Serbia. The continued monitoring of the parasitic fauna of wild canides is needed to establish the widespread of the zoonoses in different regions of Serbia, because they present the reservoirs and/or sources of these infections.\n\nMenopausal transition in Southern Europe: comparative study of women in Serbia and Portugal.\n\nPubMed\n\nDotlic, Jelena; Pimenta, Filipa; Kovacevic, Nikolina; Leal, Isabel; Maroco, Joao; Utian, Wulf; Gazibara, Tatjana\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess and compare general menopausal quality of life in Serbia and Portugal. In all, 1,503 women aged between 40 and 65 years from Belgrade, Serbia, and Lisbon, Portugal, were included in the study. A sociodemographic questionnaire and the Utian Quality of Life (UQOL) scale were used in data collection. The average age of women was 50 (SDâ=â5.61) years. Serbian and Portuguese women differed in all sociodemographic characteristics except for body mass index (BMI) and relationship status. There were no significant differences in UQOL total score (Pâ=â0.629) or UQOL sexual score (Pâ=â0.396) between Serbian and Portuguese women. However, occupational (Pâ<â0.001) and health (Pâ=â0.003) scores were significantly higher in the Serbian sample, whereas Portuguese women had higher emotional scores (Pâ<â0.001). Based on the total study sample, women with an average UQOL score were more highly educated, employed, non-smokers, and physically active, and more likely to obtain medical assistance for climacteric symptoms compared with women who reported lower UQOL score. In addition to these characteristics, women with a higher UQOL score had higher annual income, no recent illnesses, and optimal BMI compared with women who reported a lower UQOL score. This study showed that diverse populations of midlife women can have similar perceptions of quality of life as it encompasses broad dimensions of menopausal somatic and psychosocial symptoms, as well as habits and lifestyle. Further comparative studies using the UQOL scale are warranted to offer more information on the delicate factors influencing well-being in climacteric women worldwide.\n\nAstronomy and public outreach in Serbia (1934-2009)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanic, N.\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe astronomical community in Serbia has grown significantly over the last few decades, despite the departure overseas of much home-grown talent. Serbia celebrates three important anniversaries in 2007 - 150 years since the birth of Milan Nedeljkovic, who introduced the first astronomical subjects to the Faculty of Mathematics in 1884, and founded the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade in 1887; 120 years of the Belgrade Astronomical Observatory and 75 years since the construction of the complex of buildings and telescopes at the Astronomical Observatory in Belgrade. The Astronomy Department at the Faculty of Mathematics in Belgrade has produced many excellent scientists working today at telescopes (Arecibo, Sidney, VLA, Hawaii etc.) and universities (California, Toronto, Sidney, Illinois, MIT etc.) around the world. Since 2005, students have also been able to study astronomy at the University of Novi Sad, Serbia (Faculty of Physics). Today there are more than 20 amateur astronomical societies in Serbia, two magazines of popular astronomy, one Youth Science Centre (Petnica), two Public Observatories and two Planetariums. If the social and media network formed in October 2007 can deliver even the minimum of the expected results, six million people in Serbia should easily be familiar with IYA2009 goals, related Cornerstone Projects and particular goals in Serbia for 2009.\n\nCanine Babesioses in Noninvestigated Areas of Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabrielli, Simona; OtaÅ¡eviÄ, Suzana; IgnjatoviÄ, Aleksandra; SaviÄ, Sara; Fraulo, Maurizio; ArsiÄ-ArsenijeviÄ, Valentina; MomÄiloviÄ, Stefan; Cancrini, Gabriella\n\n2015-09-01\n\nDuring the years 2012-2014, a total of 158 outdoor dogs from PanÄevo and ÄurÄevo (northern Serbia) and NiÅ¡ and Prokuplje (southern Serbia) were submitted to molecular analyses (PCR and sequencing) for canine babesioses. An overall prevalence of 21.5% was found, due to the species Babesia sp. 'spanish dog' (10.1%), B. gibsoni (5.7%), B. canis vogeli (1.9%), B. caballi (1.9%), and B. microti (1.9%). In addition, sequence analysis showed the presence of Hepatozoon canis in a dog from NiÅ¡. No significant difference between infected and noninfected dogs was found by age, sex, and place of residence, whereas there was difference regarding the presence of ticks (p<0.005) and application of preventive measures such as applying of antitick drugs/devices. Moreover, a significant difference was established by area: Dogs from Prokuplje showed infection rates (59.1%) higher than dogs from PanÄevo (11.9%), NiÅ¡ (4.5), and ÄurÄevo (where infected dogs were not found), and a different geographical distribution of the species was found. The presence of so many Babesia species and the first identification of H. canis will allow investigations on the pathogenic role played by each one and suggests entomological studies on the tick species that are more suitable vectors for each of them. Finally, the presence of so many infected dogs offers the opportunity of evaluating the hypothesis of a possible zoonotic role of babesial species affecting dogs.\n\nShortcomings of maternity care in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nArsenijevic, Jelena; Pavlova, Milena; Groot, Wim\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMaternity care in Serbia is an integrated part of the centralized health care system inherited from the former Yugoslavia. Childbirth is often perceived as a medical event instead of a physiological process. This paper examines quality and access indicators, and patient payments for maternity care in Serbia. We apply a method of triangulation using data collected through three sources: online questionnaires filled in by mothers who delivered in one of the maternity wards in Serbia in the period 2000-2008, research publications, and official guidelines. To compare the qualitative data from all three sources, we apply framework analysis. The results show a good network of maternity wards in Serbia. On the other hand, many women who gave birth in maternity wards in Serbia indicate problems with the treatment they received. The existence of informal patient payments and so-called \"special connections\" make the position of Serbian women in maternity wards vulnerable, especially when they have neither connections nor the ability to pay. Poor communication and bedside manner of medical staff (obstetricians, other physicians, midwives, and nurses) during the birth process are also frequently reported. Actions should be taken to improve bedside manners of medical staff. In addition, the government should consider the involvement of private practitioners paid by the national insurance fund to create competition and decrease the need for informal payments and \"connections.\" Â© 2014, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation Â© 2014, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n\nA checklist of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) of Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nIliÄ, Nastas; ÄurÄiÄ, SreÄko\n\n2015-09-30\n\nA checklist of all taxa of the family Cerambycidae (longhorn beetles) from Serbia is presented. The checklist is based on compilation of data gathered both from authors and available literature published up to now. A total of 265 species and 92 subspecies belonging to 109 genera, 48 tribes, and six subfamilies are recorded for Serbia. However, the presence of 28 species listed in Serbia may be questionable. Known distribution and biology of Serbian taxa are provided.

Nevertheless, more than 150 deposits and occurrences have been recorded and some of them preliminarily explored in the last 50 years. The majority of deposits and occurrences are located within the Serbo-Macedonian metallogenic province and the most significant metallogenic units at the existing level of knowledge are the Fruska Gora ore district, Cer ore district, Sumadija metallogenic zone, Kopaonik metallogenic zone and Lece-Halkidiki metallogenic zone. The most important genetic type of deposits is hydrothermal, particularly in case of serpentinite/peridotite as host/parent rock. Placer deposits are also economically important. The dominant gemstones are silica minerals: chalcedony (Chrysoprase, carnelian, bluish chalcedony etc.), jasper (picture, landscape, red etc.), common opal (dendritic, green, milky white etc.), silica masses (undivided), and quartz (rock crystal, amethyst etc.). Beside silica minerals significant gemstones in Serbia include also beryl (aquamarine), garnet (almandine and pyrope), tourmaline, fluorite, rhodochrosite, carbonate-silica breccia, carbonate-silica onyx, silicified wood, howlite, serpentinite, marble onyx, and kyanite. This paper aims to present an overview of Serbian gemstone deposits and occurrences and their position based on a simplified gemstone metallogenic map of Serbia, as well as genetic-industrial classification of gemstone deposits and gemstone varieties.\n\nAvailability of pediatric-evaluated formulations in Serbia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBoÅ¾iÄ, Bojana; Stupar, Sanja; Stupar, DuÅ¡ko; BabiÄ, UroÅ¡; BajÄetiÄ, Milica\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to analyze the availability and coverage by health insurance reimbursement of pediatric formulations labeled for children up to the age of 12 in Serbia. To provide good insight in general availability of pediatric medicines, results were compared with the World Health Organization's (WHO) âModel List of Essential Medicines for Childrenâ and with published evidence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sources of information about medicines are the Summary of Product Characteristics, National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) Drug Lists, WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines for Children, and Serbia's official drug registry (2013). RESULTS: Out of total number of medicines in Serbia, only 49% (496) were available for children. Of all available drugs for children, 66% were with license and majority were parenteral formulation (57%), followed by drugs for local use (28%) and formulations for oral use (23%). The lowest availability of medicines was for children 0â27 days. From the total number of licensed medicines for children up to 12 years old, NHIF covers 64% of drugs. The availability of the WHO essential medicines for children in Serbia was 51%, from which 92% were licensed for pediatric use. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated the alarming lack of pediatric suitable formulations in Serbia. Significant differences in the availability of drugs suitable for children exist worldwide. From global health point of view, the differences in the access to children formulations should, therefore, be of the highest priority.

In planning future national health policy actions, inter - regional assessments play an important role. The purpose of the study was to analyze similarities and differences in premature mortality between Serbia, EURO A, EURO B, and EURO C regions in 2000. Mortality and premature mortality patterns were analysed according to cause of death, by gender and seven age intervals. The study results are presented in relative (%) and absolute terms (age-specific and age-standardized death rates per 100,000 population, and age-standardized rates of years of life lost - YLL per 1,000). Direct standardization of rates was undertaken using the standard population of Europe. The inter-regional comparison was based on a calculation of differences in YLL structures and with a ratio of age-standardized YLL rates per 1,000. A multivariate generalized linear model was used to explore mortality of Serbia and Europe sub-regions with ln age-specific death rates. The dissimilarity was achieved with a p = 0.05. According to the mortality pattern, Serbia was similar to EURO B, but with a lower average YLL per death case. YLL patterns indicated similarities between Serbia and EURO A, while SRR YLL had similarities between Serbia and EURO B. Compared to all Europe sub-regions, Serbia had a major excess of premature mortality in neoplasms and diabetes mellitus. Serbia had lost more years of life than EURO A due to cardiovascular, genitourinary diseases, and intentional injuries. Yet, Serbia was not as burdened with communicable diseases and injuries as were EURO B and EURO C. With a premature mortality pattern, Serbia is placed in the middle position of the Europe triangle. The main excess of YLL in Serbia was due to cardiovascular, malignant diseases, and diabetes mellitus. The results may be used for assessment of unacceptable\n\nEpidemiological Characteristics of Brucellosis in Serbia, 1980-2008\n\nPubMed Central\n\nÄekanac, Radovan; MladenoviÄ, Jovan; RistanoviÄ, Elizabeta; LaziÄ, SrÄan\n\n2010-01-01\n\nAim To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of human brucellosis in Serbia from 1980 to 2008 and the most important factors affecting its emergence and spread. Methods Public sources of data on brucellosis were used, including official reports of infectious diseases and epidemics, as well as monthly and annual reports of the Serbia and Vojvodina Institutes of Public Health. Results From 1980 through 2008, there were 1521 human brucellosis cases in Serbia. The annual number ranged from 2 in 2000 to 324 in 1991. Infections occurred more often in men (67% of cases) than in women (odds ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.57-3.00; Ï2â=â24.52, Pâ<â0.001). The largest number of patients over the entire study period (1184) was recorded in Kosovo and Metohija, which accounted for 78% of the total number of patients. The maximum incidence rate in Kosovo and Metohija was 12 per 100â000 in 1991. In Vojvodina, the first autochthonous human cases of brucellosis were recorded in 1999, and 101 affected persons were registered by the end of 2008. During the period 1994-2008, the largest number of patients in Serbia was recorded from June to September (310 of 623 cases, 50%). The disease was most prevalent among people aged 30-49 years, accounting for 81 of 177 (46%) of the cases in Serbia from 1999 to 2008. Conclusion Brucellosis has been a significant public health concern in Serbia. This problem may be solved by joint efforts of all relevant factors, first of all human and veterinary medical services.

Two synoptic situations in May and September of 2014 were analysed, when extreme precipitation was recorded in western and eastern Serbia, respectively. The synoptic situation from 14 to 16 May 2014 remained nearly stationary over the western and central Serbia for the entire period. On 15 May 2014, the daily rainfall broke previous historical records in Belgrade (109.8 mm), Valjevo (108.2 mm) and Loznica (110 mm). Precipitation exceeded 200 mm in 72 h, producing the most catastrophic floods in the recent history of Serbia. In Negotin (eastern Serbia), daily precipitation of 161.3 mm was registered on 16 September 2014, which was the maximum value recorded during the period 1961-2014. The daily maximum in 2014 was registered at 6 out of 16 stations. The total annual precipitation for 2014 was the highest for the period 1961-2014 at almost all stations in Serbia. A non-significant positive trend was found for all precipitation indices: annual daily maximum precipitation, the total precipitation in consecutive 3 and 5 days, the total annual precipitation, and number of days with at least 10 and 20 mm of precipitation. The generalised extreme value distribution was fitted to the annual daily maximum precipitation. The estimated 100-year return levels were 123.4 and 147.4 mm for the annual daily maximum precipitation in Belgrade and Negotin, respectively.\n\nCancer mortality in central Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMarkovic-Denic, Ljiljana; Cirkovic, Andia; Zivkovic, Snezana; Stanic, Danica; Skodric-Trifunovic, Vesna\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCancer is the one of the leading cause of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to examine cancer mortality trends in the population of central Serbia in the period from 2002 to 2011. The descriptive epidemiological method was used. The mortality from all malignant tumors (code C00-C96 of the International Disease Classification) was registered. The source of mortality data was the published material of the Cancer Registry of Serbia. The source of population data was the census of 2002 and 2011 and the estimates for inter-census years. Non-standardized, age-adjusted and age-specific mortality rates were calculated. Age adjustment of mortality rates was performed by the direct method of standardization. Trend lines were estimated using linear regression. During 2002-2011, cancer caused about 20% of all deaths each year in central Serbia. More men (56.9%) than women (43.1%) died of cancer. The average mortality rate for men was 1.3 times higher compared to women. A significant trend of increase of the age-adjusted mortality rates was recorded both for males (p<0.001) and for females (p=0.02). Except gastric cancer, the age-adjusted mortality rates in men were significantly increased for lung cancer (p=0.02), colorectal cancer (p<0.05), prostate cancer (p=0.01) and pancreatic cancer (p=0.01). Age-adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer in females were remarkably increased (p=0.01), especially after 2007. In central Serbia during the period from 2002 to 2011, there was an increasing trend in mortality rates due to cancers in both sexes. Cancer mortality in males was 1.3-fold higher compared to females.\n\n31 CFR 585.313 - Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); FRY (S&M).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

However, incidence and prevalence of RTT are scarcely reported. A retrospective study included all patients with RTT diagnosed between 1981 and 2012 in Serbia. Estimation of incidence and prevalence was calculated on the basis of vital statistics reported by Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia. From 1981 to 2012, RTT has been diagnosed in 102 girls in Serbia. Incidence of RTT in Serbia is estimated at 0.586:10,000 female live births. We estimated the prevalence of RTT in population of females younger than 19 years at 1:8,439. Death occurred in 19 patients (18.63%), with pneumonia as the most common cause. The lethal outcome by the age of 12 years could be expected for 11% of patients. The mean age at diagnosis was 3.5 years and we have confirmed a significant trend towards earlier dianosis during studied period. Rett syndrome incidence in Serbia is in accordance with reports from other countries. Serbian RTT patients have increased risk for early death when compared to patients in more developed countries, most commonly due to pneumonia. There was significant trend towards early diagnosis of RTT in Serbia over recent decades. Â© 2015 S.

Apatite fission-track central ages, modelling combined with zircon central ages and additionally, local structural observations constrain the subsequent exhumation history of the magmatic rocks. They indicate rapid cooling from above 300Â°C to ca. 80Â°C between 16 and 10 Ma for both age groups, induced by extensional exhumation of the plutons located in the footwall of core complexes. Hence, Miocene magmatism and core-complex formation not only affected the Pannonian basin but also a part of the mountainous areas of the internal Dinarides. Based on an extensive set of existing age data combined with our own analyses, we propose a geodynamical model for the Balkan Peninsula: The Late Eocene to Oligocene magmatism, which affects the Adria-derived lower plate units of the internal Dinarides, was caused by delamination of the Adriatic mantle from the overlying crust, associated with post-collisional convergence that propagated outward into the external Dinarides. Miocene magmatism, on the other hand, is associated with core-complex formation along the southern margin of the Pannonian basin, probably associated with the W-directed subduction of the European lithosphere beneath the Carpathians and interfering with ongoing Dinaridic-Hellenic back-arc extension.\n\nWho Is Guarding Serbia’s Borders?

The Republic of Serbia is an endemic area for a large number of tick-borne diseases. However, current knowledge on these diseases in Serbia is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of new emerging tick-borne pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and the vegetation from different parts of Vojvodina, Serbia. A total of 187 ticks, including 124 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 45 Ixodes ricinus and 18 Dermacentor reticulatus were collected from dogs. In addition, 26 questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from the vegetation, using the flagging method, from 4 different localities in Vojvodina, Serbia. DNA was extracted from each tick individually and samples were tested by either conventional or real-time PCR assays for the presence of Rickettsia spp.-DNA (gltA and ompA gene fragments), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp.-DNA (16S rRNA gene fragment) and Hepatozoon spp./Babesia spp.-DNA (18S rRNA gene fragment). In addition, all I. ricinus DNA samples were tested for Bartonella spp.-DNA (ITS locus) by real-time PCR. In this study, the presence of novel emerging tick-borne pathogens including Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia massiliae, Babesia venatorum, Babesia microti, Hepatozoon canis and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was identified for the first time in Serbia. Our findings also confirmed the presence of Rickettsia monacensis, Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks from Serbia. The findings of the current study highlight the great diversity of tick-borne pathogens of human and animal importance in Serbia. Physicians, public health workers and veterinarians should increase alertness to the presence of these tick-borne pathogens in this country. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Increasing demand for goat meat is likely to promote the role of this animal for human toxoplasmosis. As there are virtually no data on toxoplasmosis in goats in Serbia, we undertook a cross-sectional serological study, including prediction modelling using geographical information systems (GIS). Sera from 431 goats reared in 143 households/farms throughout Serbia, sampled between January 2010 and September 2011, were examined for T. gondii antibodies by a modified agglutination test. Seroprevalence was 73.3% at the individual level and 84.6% at the farm level. Risk factor analysis showed above two-fold higher risk of infection for goats used for all purposes compared to dairy goats (P = 0.012), almost seven-fold higher risk for goats kept as sole species versus those kept with other animals (P = 0.001) and a two-fold lower risk for goats introduced from outside the farm compared to those raised on the farm (P = 0.027). Moreover, households/farms located in centre-eastern Serbia were found to be less often infected than those in northern Serbia (P = 0.004). The risk factor analysis was fully supported by spatial analysis based on a GIS database containing data on origin, serology, land cover, elevation, meteorology and a spatial prediction map based on kriging analysis, which showed western Serbia as the area most likely for finding goats positive for T. gondii and centre-eastern Serbia as the least likely. In addition, rainfall favoured seropositivity, whereas temperature, humidity and elevation did not.\n\n31 CFR 586.306 - Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-07-01\n\n...

This is the largest sub-discipline of the laboratory medicine in Serbia. It includes all aspects of clinical chemistry, and also laboratory hematology with coagulation, immunology, etc. Medical biochemistry laboratories in Serbia and medical biochemists as a profession are part of Health Care System and their activities are regulated through: the Health Care Law and rules issued by the Chamber of Medical Biochemists of Serbia. The first continuous and organized education for Medical Biochemists (Clinical Chemists) in Serbia dates from 1945, when the Department of Medical Biochemistry was established at the Pharmaceutical Faculty in Belgrade. In 1987 at the same Faculty a five years undergraduate study program was established, educating Medical Biochemists under a special program. Since the academic year 2006/2007 the new five year undergraduate (according to Bologna Declaration) and four-year postgraduate program according to EC4 European Syllabus for Postgraduate Training in Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine has been established. The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Public Health accredited these programs. There are four requirements for practicing medical biochemistry in the Health Care System: University Diploma of the Faculty of Pharmacy (Study of Medical Biochemistry), successful completion of the professional exam at the Ministry of Health after completion of one additional year of obligatory practical training in the medical biochemistry laboratories, membership in the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists and licence for skilled work issued by the Serbian Chamber of Medical Biochemists.

In Serbia, echinococcosis is mandatory reportable, and this review analyzes the officially reported data as well as the research data published between 1998 and 2010. Official data on human and animal infections were obtained from the Institute of Public Health of Serbia (IPHS, 2010), and from the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade, Forestry and Water Management (MATFWM) and the Statistical Office, respectively. Published data were obtained by searching the Medline, Scopus, and Google databases using \"echinococcosis,\" \"hydatidosis,\" and \"Serbia\" as key words. In addition, the search included national journals and doctoral theses, as well as conference proceedings. Only Echinococcus granulosus has been reported in Serbia, with a total of 409 cases of human infection officially reported during the observed period as opposed to 820 cases described in clinical studies. No trend in the incidence of infection was shown among adults, but the number of cases in children continuously decreased over the period. Patients were more frequently female and from rural areas. Differences in the geographic distribution of cases were noted, with a lower incidence in the central part of country. Liver disease was by far the most common presentation, but cases of unusual cyst locations have been described. Among domestic animals, sheep were the most highly infected species. A decreasing incidence of echinococcosis in animals has been noted as of the 1970s. Echinococcosis continues to be endemic in Serbia in the 21st century, but despite predictions, neither official data nor those from clinical studies indicate its re-emergence. However, there is gross underreporting. Public health authorities should actively work to increase reporting, as only valid reported data provide an accurate basis for future control plans.\n\nThe Interpretation and Implementation of the Bologna Process in Serbia\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDespotovic, Miomir\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThis paper neither attacks nor defends the Bologna Declaration; rather, it attempts a critical assessment of its implementation in Serbia.

At that time, however, a number of both foreign allied medical missions and individual volunteers, from various countries, mostly from Great Britain, came to Serbia to help. Among them mostly were women, and they were of enormous support to Serbia in that grave situation. It is estimated that there were more than 600 foreign women volunteers in Serbia at that time and that 22 of them died there. Dr. Elizabeth Ross was one of those brave volunteers who came to Serbia early in 1915. That noble Scottish lady doctor was born in 1878 and finished her medical studies at the University of Glasgow in 1901. After graduation she worked in various places in Great Britain until 1909, when she went to Persia (Iran), where she worked until the beginning of the so called Great War. When she heard of the urgent need in Serbia she left Persia as soon as she could and volunteered to serve in Serbia. She came to Kragujevac at the beginning of January 1915, where she worked at the First Military Reserve Hospital, which at that time was actually a typhus hospital. Working there intensively and devotedly for several weeks under shocking conditions she contracted typhus herself and died there on her 37th birthday on February 14th, 1915. She was buried in Kragujevac, next to two British ladies who also died in Serbia of typhus. Her grave was restored in 1980 when the town of Kragujevac started holding commemorations at the graveside every February 14th at noon to honor her and all other brave and noble women who lost their lives helping Serbia at that unfortunate time.\n\nEvidence of Aujeszky's disease in wild boar in Serbia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilicevic, V; Radojicic, S; Valcic, M; Ivovic, V; Radosavljevic, V\n\n2016-06-30\n\nAujeszky's disease is a viral disease of suids caused by Suid Herpesvirus 1. The disease has worldwide distribution with significant economic impact. In Serbia, there is neither an Aujeszky's disease eradication nor national vaccination programme of domestic pigs. Since clinical symptoms of Aujeszky's disease are not specific, it is important to establish a link between clinical signs and presence of ADV active infection in wild boars. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of active infection within wild boar showing signs of ADV and also to examine relationship between isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar. Having in mind that virus has not been previously isolated from wild boars in Serbia, we report the first isolation of Suid Herpesvirus 1 from this species in Serbia. Tissue and serum samples from 40 wild boars from eastern Serbia were examined for evidence of Aujeszky's disease (AD). Suid Herpesvirus 1 (SHV1), the cause of AD was isolated on PK15 cell line from three tissue samples, inducing cytopathic effect (CPE) with syncytia forming, and viral genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in eight samples. Genetic analysis of us4, us9 and ul49.5 partial sequences showed high homology between ADV isolates from wild boars and between isolates from wild boars and domestic animals. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected by virus neutralisation test (VNT) in sera from four out of eight PCR positive wild boars suggesting recent infection in those animals. This is the first demonstration of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) in the wild boar population in Serbia although seroconversion has been detected previously.\n\nTranssexualism in Serbia: a twenty-year follow-up study.\n\nPubMed\n\nVujovic, Svetlana; Popovic, Srdjan; Sbutega-Milosevic, Gorica; Djordjevic, Miroslav; Gooren, Louis\n\n2009-04-01\n\nGender dysphoria occurs in all societies and cultures. The prevailing social context has a strong impact on its manifestations as well as on applications by individuals with the condition for sex reassignment treatment. To describe a transsexual population seeking sex reassignment treatment in Serbia, part of former Yugoslavia. Data, collated over a period of 20 years, from subjects applying for sex reassignment to the only center in Serbia, were analyzed retrospectively. Age at the time of application, demographic data, family background, sex ratio, the prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) among female-to-male (FTM) transsexuals, and readiness to undergo surgical sex reassignment were tabulated. Applicants for sex reassignment in Serbia are relatively young. The sex ratio is close to 1:1. They often come from single-child families. More than 10% do not wish to undergo surgical sex reassignment. The prevalence of PCOS among FTM transsexuals was higher than in the general population but considerably lower than that reported in the literature from other populations. Of those who had undergone sex reassignment, none expressed regret for their decision. Although transsexualism is a universal phenomenon, the relatively young age of those applying for sex reassignment and the sex ratio of 1:1 distinguish the population in Serbia from others reported in the literature.\n\nCancer incidence and mortality in Serbia 1999-2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nMihajloviÄ, Jovan; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Miladinov-Mikov, Marica; ZivkoviÄ, SneÅ¾ana; Postma, Maarten J\n\n2013-01-15\n\nDespite the increase in cancer incidence in the last years in Serbia, no nation-wide, population-based cancer epidemiology data have been reported. In this study cancer incidence and mortality rates for Serbia are presented using nation-wide data from two population-based cancer registries. These rates are additionally compared to European and global cancer epidemiology estimates. Finally, predictions on Serbian cancer incidence and mortality rates are provided. Cancer incidence and mortality was collected from the cancer registries of Central Serbia and Vojvodina from 1999 to 2009. Using age-specific regression models, we estimated time trends and predictions for cancer incidence and mortality for the following five years (2010-2014). The comparison of Serbian with European and global cancer incidence/mortality rates, adjusted to the world population (ASR-W) was performed using Serbian population-based data and estimates from GLOBOCAN 2008. Increasing trends in both overall cancer incidence and mortality rates were identified for Serbia. In men, lung cancer showed the highest incidence (ASR-W 2009: 70.8/100,000), followed by colorectal (ASR-W 2009: 39.9/100,000), prostate (ASR-W 2009: 29.1/100,000) and bladder cancer (ASR-W 2009: 16.2/100,000). Breast cancer was the most common form of cancer in women (ASR-W 2009: 70.8/100,000) followed by cervical (ASR-W 2009: 25.5/100,000), colorectal (ASR-W 2009: 21.1/100,000) and lung cancer (ASR-W 2009: 19.4/100,000). Prostate and colorectal cancers have been significantly increasing over the last years in men, while this was also observed for breast cancer incidence and lung cancer mortality in women. In 2008 Serbia had the highest mortality rate from breast cancer (ASR-W 2008: 22.7/100,000), among all European countries while incidence and mortality of cervical, lung and colorectal cancer were well above European estimates.

Similarly to other south-eastern European countries, Serbia is not recovering any energy from MSW. Fifty percent of electricity in Serbia is produced in coal-fired power plants with emission control systems dating from the 1980s. In this article, the option of MSW incineration with energy recovery is proposed and examined for the city of Novi Sad. A sustainability analysis consisting of financial, economic and sensitivity analyses was done in the form of a cost-benefit analysis following recommendations from the European Commission. Positive and negative social and environmental effects of electricity generation through incineration were valuated partly using conversion factors and shadow prices, and partly using the results of previous studies. Public aversion to MSW incineration was considered. The results showed that the incineration project would require external financial assistance, and that an increase of the electricity and/or a waste treatment fee is needed to make the project financially positive. It is also more expensive than the landfilling option. However, the economic analysis showed that society would have net benefits from an incineration project. The feed-in tariff addition of only â¬0.03 (KWh)(-1) to the existing electricity price, which would enable the project to make a positive contribution to economic welfare, is lower than the actual external costs of electricity generation from coal in Serbia.\n\nHuman giardiasis in Serbia: asymptomatic vs symptomatic infection*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNikoliÄ, A.; Klun, I.; BobiÄ, B.; IvoviÄ, V.; VujaniÄ, M.; Å½ivkoviÄ, T.; DjurkoviÄ-DjakoviÄ, O.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nDespite the public health importance of giardiasis in all of Europe, reliable data on the incidence and prevalence in Western Balkan Countries (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and FYR Macedonia) are scarce, and the relative contribution of waterborne and food-borne, or person-to-person and/or animalto- person, transmission of human giardiasis is not yet clear. To provide baseline data for the estimation of the public health risk caused by Giardia, we here review the information available on the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic and symptomatic human infection in Serbia. Although asymptomatic cases of Giardia represent a major proportion of the total cases of infection, high rates of Giardia infection were found in both asymptomatic and symptomatic populations. No waterborne outbreaks of giardiasis have been reported, and it thus seems that giardiasis mostly occurs sporadically in our milieu. Under such circumstances, control measures to reduce the high prevalence of giardiasis in Serbia have focused on person-to-person transmission, encouraging proper hygiene, but for more targeted intervention measures, studies to identify other risk factors for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections are needed.

Our dataset consists of mean monthly surface air temperature (MMT) and mean monthly precipitation (MMP) for 26 meteorological stations during the period 1949-2015. MMT and MMP are used for calculating monthly, seasonal, and annual aridity indices for period of 66 years. According to the De Martonne climate classification, we determine five, three, and four types of climate on the monthly, seasonal, and annual basis, respectively. During the observed period, winter was extremely humid, spring and autumn were humid, and summer was semi-humid. Humid and semi-humid climate with Mediterranean vegetation are identified by the annual Pinna combinative index. We find that there is no change in aridity trend in Central Serbia for the period 1949-2015. Aridity indices are additionally compared with the North Atlantic Oscillation and El-NiÃ±o South Oscillation in order to establish a possible connection with the large-scale processes. Results are further compared with several earlier studies of aridity in Serbia. With this study, the analysis of aridity in whole Serbia has become complete.\n\nPhysician and nurse supply in Serbia using time-series data\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Unemployment among health professionals in Serbia has risen in the recent past and continues to increase. This highlights the need to understand how to change policies to meet real and projected needs. This study identified variables that were significantly related to physician and nurse employment rates in the public healthcare sector in Serbia from 1961 to 2008 and used these to develop parameters to model physician and nurse supply in the public healthcare sector through to 2015. Methods The relationships among six variables used for planning physician and nurse employment in public healthcare sector in Serbia were identified for two periods: 1961 to 1982 and 1983 to 2008. Those variables included: the annual total national population; gross domestic product adjusted to 1994 prices; inpatient care discharges; outpatient care visits; students enrolled in the first year of medical studies at public universities; and the annual number of graduated physicians. Based on historic trends, physician supply and nurse supply in the public healthcare sector by 2015 (with corresponding 95% confidence level) have been modeled using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) / Transfer function (TF) models. Results The ARIMA/TF modeling yielded stable and significant forecasts of physician supply (stationary R2 squared = 0.71) and nurse supply (stationary R2 squared = 0.92) in the public healthcare sector in Serbia through to 2015. The most significant predictors for physician employment were the population and GDP. The supply of nursing staff was, in turn, related to the number of physicians.

The aims of this research were to detect and characterize tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Ixodes ricinus ticks at presumed natural foci in Serbia, and to determine seroprevalence of TBEV IgG antibodies in humans and animals. A total of 500 I. ricinus ticks were examined for the presence of TBEV by real-time RT-PCR, and conventional nested PCR and sequencing. To determine TBEV seroprevalence, 267 human sera samples were collected, as were 200 sera samples from different animal species. All sera samples were examined by ELISA for the presence of anti-TBEV antibodies. To exclude cross-reactivity, all sera samples were tested for anti-West Nile virus (WNV) antibodies and all human sera samples were also tested for anti-Usutu virus antibodies by ELISA. Results of this preliminary study indicated TBEV activity in Serbia at two microfoci. Several decades after the previous documentation of TBEV in Serbia, we have demonstrated the presence of TBEV in I. ricinus questing nymphs (prevalence 2% and 6.6% at the two different localities) and anti-TBEV antibodies in humans (seroprevalence 0.37%). Moreover, we show for the first time TBEV seroprevalence in several animal species in Serbia, including dogs (seroprevalence 17.5%), horses (5%), wild boars (12.5%), cattle (2.5%), and roe deer (2.5%). None of the goats tested was positive for anti-TBEV IgG antibodies. TBEV isolate from I. ricinus tick in this study belonged to the Western European subtype. To understand the true public health concern in Serbia, detailed epidemiological, clinical, virological, and acarological research are required. This is important for implementation of effective control measures to reduce the incidence of TBE in Serbia.\n\nThe most important parasites in Serbia involving the foodborne route of transmission\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPetroviÄ, J.

Compared to other foodborne pathogens in Serbia, foodborne (or potentially foodborne) parasites do not get the attention they undoubtedly deserve. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the most important parasitic pathogens that can be transmitted by food, and that cause disease in humans: Echinococcus, Trichinella, Taenia solium and Toxoplasma gondii. For each of these pathogens, the severity of human diseases they cause, incidence, mortality and case fatality rate among humans in Serbia as well as their prevalence in animal species in Serbia are described. Some of the described foodborne parasites can induce severe disease symptoms in humans associated with high case fatality rates, while others can cause massive outbreaks. All of the aforementioned parasites occur throughout Serbia and cause both severe public health problems and substantial economic losses in livestock production. In conclusion, the control measures of foodborne parasites certainly need to include education of farmers and improvement of veterinary sanitary measures in animal farming and animal waste control.\n\nSerbia: coronary and structural heart interventions from 2010 to 2015.\n\nPubMed\n\nStojkovic, Sinisa; Milasinovic, Dejan; Bozinovic, Nenad; Davidovic, Aleksandar; Debeljacki, Dragan; Djenic, Nemanja; Hinic, Sasa; Jagic, Nikola; Micic, Olivera; Mitov, Vladimir; Neskovic, Aleksandar N; Nikolic, Milan; Sagic, Dragan; Stankovic, Goran\n\n2017-05-15\n\nSerbia's interventional community has been facing the multifaceted challenge of an ageing population with cardiovascular diseases as the primary cause of death nationwide, coronary artery disease (CAD) being the most prevalent subset.

These comprised resident and migratory birds, collected between January and September 2012 in the Vojvodina province. The birds belonged to 45 species within 27 families. Blood sera (n=92) and pooled tissues from respective birds (n=81) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). WNV antibodies were detected in seven (8%) sera: four from Mute Swans (Cygnus olor), two from White-tailed Eagles (Haliaeetus albicillas), and one from a Common Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus). Five sera neutralised WNV but not Usutu virus. For the first time in Serbia, WNV RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in pooled tissue samples of eight respective birds. WNV RNA was also derived from an additional bird, after a serum sample resulted infective in cell culture. The total nine WNV RNA positive birds included three Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), two White-tailed Eagles, one Legged Gull (Larus michahelis), one Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix), one Bearded Parrot-bill (Panarus biramicus), and one Common Pheasant. Phylogenetic analysis of partial E region sequences showed the presence of, at least, two lineage 2 Serbian clusters closely related to those responsible for recent human and animal outbreaks in Greece, Hungary and Italy. Full genomic sequence from a goshawk isolate corroborated this data. These results confirm WNV circulation in Serbia and highlight the risk of infection for humans and horses, pointing to the need for implementing WNV surveillance programmes.\n\nIschaemic heart disease mortality in Serbia, 1991-2013; a joinpoint analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIlic, Milena; Ilic, Irena\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground & objectives: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) has been one of the leading causes of mortality in the world. In many European countries the mortality rates due to IHD have been rising rapidly. This study was aimed to assess the IHD mortality trend in Serbia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study analyzing IHD mortality in Serbia in the period 1991-2013 was carried out based on official data. The age-standardized rates (ASRs, per 100,000) were calculated using the direct method, according to the European standard population. Joinpoint analysis was used to estimate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) with the corresponding 95 per cent confidence interval (CI). Results: More than 253,000 people (143,420 men and 110,276 women) died due to IHD in Serbia during the observed period, and most of them (over 160,000 people) were patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Average annual ASR for IHD was 113.6/100,000. There was no overall significant trend for mortality due to IHD (AAPC=+0.1%, 95% CI â0.8-1.0), but there was one joinpoint: the trend significantly increased by +2.3 per cent per year from 1991 to 2006 and then significantly decreased by â6.4 per cent from 2006 to onwards. Significantly decreased mortality trends for MI in both genders were observed: according to the comparability test, mortality trends in men and women were parallel (final selected model failed to reject parallelism, P=0.0567). Interpretation & conclusions: No significant trend for mortality due to IHD was observed in Serbia during the study period. The substantial decline of mortality from IHD seen in most developed countries during the past decades was not observed in Serbia. Further efforts are required to reduce mortality from IHD in Serbian population.

In the introduction, we present geographic, demographic, political and economic elements, which define more closely the position of Serbia in the Southeastern Europe. Further, the healthcare system of Serbia, organized in four levels, is presented: self-care, primary healthcare, secondary healthcare and tertiary healthcare, as well as the schedule of 20,157 physicians engaged in healthcare. In addition, we point out numerous problems, which the system is faced with. Special attention is paid to orthopaedic and trauma services active within the system, its development, current condition and personnel education. We have concluded that, despite this being a middle-income country, the healthcare system is well developed. With 524 orthopaedic surgeons, working in 56 specialized departments, musculoskeletal diseases and trauma management are covered at all three healthcare levels. Nevertheless, the authors also underline weaknesses"
