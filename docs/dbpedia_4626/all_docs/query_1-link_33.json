        "text": "Hello everybody. Welcome to our third episode about a very interesting webinar made by Bureau Members of European Aquatics for an event organized by the partner of LEN, SIGA Sport. In the first episode we found out what SIGA Sport is and what does that partnership and friendship mean for European Aquatics. We found out just how important and essential transparency and integrity are for European Aquatics and SIGA. In the second episode we found out that European Aquatics Communication Manager, and the moderator of the webinar, has some skeletons in his closet.\n\nHello everydoby. In the first part of the LEN – Entering the era of Integrity and Transparency series I started to write about a video that was posted on the official youtube page of Len – European Aquatics called „The Road to Better Sport Governance: A Case Study from European Aquatics”. The mentioned video was made for an event hosted by SIGA Sport. An organization for good governance and integrity. SIGA is big on integrity. Check the first part here. https://www.dance.hr/kolumne/gostujuce-kolumne/len-entering-the-era-of-integrity-and-transparency-part1.html . Today we will continue analyzing this conversation and its participants. If you found the first part a bit boring and dry, brace yourself. We about to get wet.\n\nGrowing up is an interesting concept that I’m still trying to fully grasp. Elegant brutality of life happens in front of our faces every day, but it remains hidden from the eyes of those who refuse to accept certain truths about life. Adults have this world which they don’t speak about. The older generation of adults doesn’t like to speak about how they come from an era where there was simply not enough for everyone, while the new generation of adults doesn’t like to speak about how they come from an era where there should be enough for everyone. Subtle changes are happening at those levels, invisible to those who don’t know exactly what to look for, but that’s something we don’t need to speak about. There are levels of functioning where an organization, or an industry, or a company, or even a whole sport is just a cleverly and elegantly positioned tool, or an asset, within a greater long term purpose.\n\nGreetings to all, and welcome to yet another one of my waterpolo recitations. By nature, I never really wanted to do these waterpolo recitations. I have always valued training more than speaking, but certain circumstances have almost forced me to do what I’m doing now, and it doesn’t make sense to stop, at least not as long as I’m active as an athlete in the pool. After my active career, I’ll see what and how I’ll proceed. There were times when I wanted to quit with this what you are reading now, but then it seemed as if everything I had written up to that point would somehow come crashing down on me. Have you ever had that feeling? That feeling that everything you’ve done up to a certain moment will come back to haunt you if you don’t see it through to the end. And that means that for the time being the whole waterpolo community can enjoy having me around. Besides, it looks good on my CV when I’m looking for a job. So, let’s continue with the article.\n\nGreetings everyone. It is now more than evident that the world before the coronavirus was hanging by a few small threads that have now snapped. We are all aware that the system has collapsed, and now we are all trying to create a new system while somehow maintaining the positions we held in the old system, whether in the market or in some social hierarchy. This is not the first time that systems have collapsed and new ones have been created."
