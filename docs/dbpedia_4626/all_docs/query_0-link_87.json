        "text": "After plannint to meet in December 2015, one entire year ago, it was such a privilege to finally get together with extraordinary Qin Shao! Dear Michael Perlin, thank you so much for introducing us to eath other! Qin is Professor of History at the College of New Jersey and former research fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, Harvard University (2007 – 2008), and at the International Research Center on Work and Lifecycle in Global History, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany (January – July 2013). Her recent work has focused on the human dimension of rapid urbanization in post- Mao China, especially on such issues as mental health, dignity, property rights, and grass-roots resistance. She is working on a new project about the impact of politically induced and imposed physical displacement under Mao.\n\nDear Qin, thank you so much for giving me your important book:\n\nShao, Qin (2013). Shanghai Gone: Domicide and Defiance in a Chinese Megacity. State and Society in East Asia. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. This is the summary of this book:\n\nShanghai has been demolished and rebuilt into a gleaming megacity in recent decades, now ranking with New York and London as a hub of global finance. But that transformation has come at a grave human cost. This compelling book is the first to apply the concept of domicide—the eradication of a home against the will of its dwellers—to the sweeping destruction of neighborhoods, families, and life patterns to make way for the new Shanghai. Here we find the holdouts and protesters, men and women who have stubbornly resisted domicide and demanded justice. Qin Shao follows, among others, a reticent kindergarten teacher turned diehard petitioner; a descendant of gangsters and squatters who has become an amateur lawyer for evictees; and a Chinese Muslim who has struggled to recover his ancestral home in Xintiandi, an infamous site of gentrification dominated by a well-connected Hong Kong real estate tycoon. Highlighting the wrenching changes spawned by China’s reform era, Shao vividly portrays the relentless pursuit of growth and profit by the combined forces of corrupt power and money, the personal wreckage it has left behind, and the enduring human spirit it has unleashed.\n\n• Please click on the photo above to see it larger.\n\nIn November 2016, my 1981 dress (see the photo on the left side) was copied in New York by dear May Cheng (see the photo in the middle)!\n\nIn 1981, I worked as a medical student in Bangkok, and was overjoyed to see the streets filled with silk shops. I bought some silk and designed and made the dress you see on the left photo (the photo was taken in 2014). In 2014, I was back in Thailand and was devastated to see that modern-day mass production has \"killed\" the local silk handicraft, as it has done with so many other handicrafts all around the world. Those with means, in all corners of the world, seem to be willing now to reduce themselves to crowding their wardrobes with clothes that lack true quality and diversity. The number of colors that is being used in these mass-produced materials, just to give one example, is disastrously low. And I watch the poor, in Africa, South America, and other parts of the world, I watch them being reduced to digging through heaps of second-hand clothes that people in the Global North have given to \"charity\" believing that this meant \"doing good,\" while these clothes are being sold off for profit, finally destroying also the local skill base among the poor.\n\nOn December 7, 2007, I was discussing this disaster with Zuzka Kurtz in New York. Zuzka confirmed that we need to educate people to respect the richness of knowledge and skill that flows into many handmade products, particularly those that honor long artistic traditions.\n\nI started to study local fashion styles back in 1974 and created \"cross-over\" clothes. Have a look at our World Clothes for Equal Dignity idea, for which I still look for support. Unfortunately, I no longer have time to be my own tailor, and the dress on the left side from 1981 is now very worn and in danger to fall apart and I repair it every year. Since I did not find the right material in Thailand in 2014 to make a good copy, I kept searching for it in other parts of the world. I was extremely happy to find the right material in the very last corner of the fashion street in New York in December 2015! (Foursquare Favorite, 224 West 40th Street.) I brought this material back with me to New York in 2016, and the lovely tailor May Cheng has now been so kind, in November, to make a copy of my 1981 dress! See the photo on the right side!\n\n• Please click on the photos above on the left side or here to see more pictures from 2014 in Thailand. Click on the photo above in the middle and on the right side or here to see more pictures of May's little atelier in Boweri Street in New York's China Town.\n\nOn 4th September 2016, I visited \"Fort Imperial,\" on top of Mount Srđ (412 metres), just behind the walled city of Dubrovnik, in Dalmatia, Croatia. The fort was built in 1806 – 1816 during the Napoleonic Wars and now houses the exhibition \"Dubrovnik during the Homeland War, 1991 – 1995.\" From the Fort Imperial, the view on Dubrovnik was particularly good, and I could take a good picture of the Inter-University Centre, see the second row of photos, on the right side.\n\nThe exhibition in the fort speaks about the suffering of Dubrovnik's population under attack, about the heroism and courage of the defenders of Dubrovnik, and about the bitter disappointment at the international community who failed to prevent this catastrophe (as I learned, the population of Dubrovnik was at least spared the snipers that the people of Sarajevo had to fear).\n\nIn a film that was shown in the exhibiliton, one man explained that Dubrovnik, being such a unique historical treasure, seems to have been used to force Croatia to cede territory so that Greater Serbia could come into being...\n\nAnother film was shown, created by the Croatian History Museum in Zagreb in 2015, about the timeline of events since 1945. The film ended with the Operation Storm, which, in 2015, has been called \"Croatia’s Triumph, Serbia’s Grief\": \"Croatia this week celebrates its defeat of Serb rebels during Operation Storm 20 years ago, but Serbia will mourn the hundreds killed and the 200,000 who became refugees.\"\n\nAt the bottom of the photos above, you see an advertisement of the very controversial Golf Park project. See A Dangerous Game, a 2014 film that narrates how the building of a luxury golf course on Mount Srđ overlooking Dubrovnik has been approved, while local residents are campaigning against it and a referendum was held which officials then ignored. The film also looks at luxury golf resorts in general, how they damage the natural environment because of high water and pesticide usage, and how they often only serve the super rich whilst bypassing local democracy to please the developers.\n\nSo many things can be learned here:\n\n1. how easily people can get divided along identity fault lines (see social psychology for the minimal group paradigm) and how easily leaders, to stay in power, can use this human propensity (see, among others, Dejan Jović's book \"Yugoslavia - A state that withered away,\" West Lafayette, IN: Purdue University Press, 2008)\n\n2. the two faces of war: on one side the soldier as savior, war as arena for heroism (see the mention of \"the enemy's lack of courage\" to take the fort; see also the Orlando statue in town further down, symbolizing nobility and freedom for Dubrovnik, and see the annual Sinjska alka competition also heralding knightly virtues), on the other side, war as atrocity and the soldier as perpetrator\n\n3. how potentially explosive a border region is, where once a war culture was cultivated and incentivized by its powerful rivaling neighbors, in this case, between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires\n\n4. how peripheral regions also can also carve out alternative paths (see Yugoslavia's neutrality after 1948, and becoming one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement)\n\n5. how onslaught still continues, now no longer in the form of military destruction but through economic and environmental poisoning (as one young man in Dubrovnik told me yesterday evening: since time immemorial, the best women chose the strongest hunter and warrior, now this means a man has to have money, so he dreams of ways to make millions...)\n\n6. the need to transcend and transform the idea of the nation-state in today's interconnected world\n\n7. the responsibility of the so-called international community to liberate the world from war, to liberate men from having to sacrifice their lives as \"courageous heros,\" and to liberate peoples from \"chosen traumas\" (Vamik Volkan) and resistance to persecution as major identity marker (see Anne Hanvør further down, and her words that all sides are victims and all feel as victims)\n\n8. Josip Broz Tito kept Yugoslavs from fighting each other: what are the best of his strategies that humankind could learn from now, and where did he go too far? (See, for instance, Richard West's book \"Tito and the rise and fall of Yugoslavia,\" London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1994). For a decent future for humankind, the aim would be a world of unity in diversity, rather than uniformity without diversity or division without unity. It seems that communism had become equated with uniformity when Yugoslavia dissolved, an oppressive uniformity that called for acknowledging national/ethnic diversity, which, however, descended into division and war: from one degradation of the motto of unity in diversity, namely, uniformity without diversity, it went to the other extreme of degradation, namely, division without unity. Anne Hanvør's words about the situation in Scandinavia and resistance to immigration: there must be a careful balance of not keeping the lid on diversity too much, but also not too little. Raif Dizdaravic told BBC reporter Martin Bell that he believes that \"the seeds of nationalism were sown in a new constitution in 1974, which loosened the federal structure without introducing necessary economic reforms. Politicians in the richer republics harvested votes by wondering aloud why they should subsidise the poorer ones. He told me: 'When we actually decided to move towards decentralisation, we were not giving time to the economy. Instead we were giving time to the republics.'\" Under Tito, the old flags and anthems were banned, while later, \"some of the fiercest battles of the war in Croatia were fought on the so-called Highway of Brotherhood and Unity. In the war in Bosnia, they were fought on the Bridge of Brotherhood and Unity in Sarajevo.\" Now, \"elections... means playing the nationalist card yet again.\"\n\n• Please click on the photos above, or here to see more pictures.\n\nOrlando, in the middle of Dubrovnik, visited on 2nd September 2016. During the war, he was boarded up.\n\n\"Dubrovnik Under Siege: Artists’ Interactions with the Old City During the Yugoslav Army Aggression,\" by Nensi Brailo, who conducted interviews in Croatia in summer 2005 with Ivo Grbić, Davor Lucijanović, and Mirjana Urban:\n\nOn the north side of the column is the statue of the medieval knight Orlando, erected in 1418. Orlando, in the Dubrovnik dialect, is Roland, the legendary eighth-century Frankish knight who was killed in battle and came to embody (in the “Song of Roland”) the qualities of nobility and freedom. By placing a statue of Orlando in this prominent city square, the officials of the Republic of Dubrovnik may also have been subtly reminding Dubrovnik’s Ottoman suzerains that the city would continue to identify with Christian Europe rather than Istanbul (formerly Constantinople). Over time, the statue became a symbol of freedom and free trade. On top of the mast of the Orlando statue, the white flag of Saint Blaise, patron saint of the Republic of Dubrovnik, waved for five centuries. After the abolishment of the Dubrovnik Republic by Napoleon in 1808, the flag of Saint Blaise was replaced by the Italian, then the Austrian, then the Austro-Hungarian, and finally the Yugoslav flag. In 1990, on the eve of Croatia’s independence, locals proudly replaced the Yugoslav flag with the flag of Libertas—the Latin word for freedom. In 1991, following the Croatian declaration of independence from the former Yugoslavia, the Libertas flag was replaced by the new Croatian flag. Red, white, and blue with the checkered red-and-white Croatian coat of arms in the middle, the new flag displayed five crests along the top, symbolizing Croatia’s five traditional provinces (Zagreb, Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Istria, and Slavonia).\n\nDuring the attacks on the city at the end of 1991, the statue of Orlando was boarded up for protection along with the shop windows on Stradun. Davor Lucijanović and Marija Koprivica, professional artists who participated in the collaborative public art project, painted the contours of Orlando on the boards covering the statue. Orlando was thus simultaneously concealed and revealed via these artistic renderings. Each artist painted two sides of the Orlando Column, resulting in four representations. The first showed a knight, symbolizing the soldier, defender of Croatia; the second a troubadour with a lute; the third a lover with a heart; and last, a peacekeeping member of the United Nations Protection Force, which brings humanitarian aid and food to populations impoverished by war. The painted Orlando Column and the new Croatian flag floating above symbolized two identities—one local and one national—now operating simultaneously. The local Dubrovnik identity celebrated the historic achievements of the Dubrovnik Republic, and the painting of Orlando took on a broader, national identity, as Orlando became the defender of Croatia. From this point on, Dubrovnik and its citizens identi- fied with the struggles for independence of the newly formed democratic Republic of Croatia. In yet another layer of symbolism, behind Orlando’s head one of the artists painted the flag of the European Union, blue with a circle of yellow stars in the middle, signifying the yearnings of the new democratic Croatia to become a part of the European Union, a part of the West. The circle of stars around Orlando’s head made him look like an angel with a halo, overseeing the city and serving as its protector.\n\n• Please click on the photos above, or here to see more pictures.\n\nOn 28th August 2016, I took the bus from Sarajevo to Dubrovnik. I was again amazed to see people smoking almost desperately; smoking seems to be a collective addiction. Is it perhaps an aftermath of war stress? I found this article: Smoking: An Endemic Problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina and read there that \"smoking is rife in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), where the price of a pack of cigarettes is one of the lowest in Europe and Central Asia. The country ranks number 8 in the world in terms of smokers per capita and the percentage of adolescent smokers is steadily increasing.\"\n\nAll over the world, I am told that for a man, smoking is part of being a male; male strength is proven by a man's willingness and ability to \"drink and smoke hard,\" and to \"know how to treat women\" (meaning to show them their rightful lowly place).\n\nAnd also women smoked with great intensity. Sigmund Freud's nephew, Edward Louis Bernays (1891–1995), who was one of the founders of the PR industry, is still successful. He took Freud’s psychoanalytical concepts and then looked at the work of Gustave LeBon on crowd psychology, and Wilfred Trotter’s ideas on the instincts of the “herd.” The results of his insights he offered to the tobacco industry who was interested to expand its market and did not know how to turn women into customers (at that time, women did not wish to smoke). Bernays manipulated women into becoming paying customers of the tobacco industry by hiring some women who marched at the front of the Easter Sunday Parade of 1929 to smoke, so that he could use their example to convince other women that smoking was a symbol of female freedom. Cigarettes became “torches of freedom.” Since then, women smoke and believe it is \"cool.\"\n\nIt is interesting how the culture with respect to smoking (both for men and women) has changed the further north one goes (Scandinavia, for instance), and the more one enters into the academic sphere. While smoking does not seem to damage one's standing in society further south, it increasingly does so further north. Many people I know will not entrust smokers with serious tasks, because they regard smokers as untrustworthy, since smokers cannot even attend to their own self-interest. Smokers may be seen as people who are helpless victims of a health-damaging addiction, unable of due self-care. In other words, as much as smoking is an accepted cohesion-building activity further south (as it was 20 or 30 years ago also further north), it now turns into a social and career handicap in the north.\n\nOn 26th August 2016, I went back to the Sevdah Art House in Sarajevo. I liked the voice of Nedžad Salković (January 6, 1941, Tuzla), one of the most famous Yugoslav and Bosnian sevdah singers. Later I found his song \"Do not rattle with sandals\" on YouTube, Nedžad Salković u Trebinju - Ne klepeći nanulama. Perhaps you would like also to listen to the legendary song at the festival \"Ilidza '68,\" Nedzad Salkovic - Ah,ljubav,ljubav.\n\nPlease read more about Sevdalinkas: \"Unlike most musical types, in Sevdalinkas the singer leads the song, while the accompaniment follows the singer. In many Sevdalinkas the concept of musical measure is secondary to the singer’s emotional free form interpretation of the lyrics. Sevdalinkas are a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences which sound significantly different from all neighbouring folk heritages. Many songs depict a unique form of melancholic feeling with slow, rubato tempo, while many are uplifting and of a happier tone. Most Sevdalinkas are love songs, depicting specific stories between a girl and a boy, while some are historical depictions of a significant event in Bosnian history. In this way, many Sevdalinkas are a unique remnant of Bosnian history and culture and are immensely significant to Bosnia and Bosnian people. Sevdalinka heritage During the rule of Ottoman Empire over Bosnia the heritage of Sevdalinkas in Bosnia grew to some 4000 known Sevdalinka texts of today! This immense heritage began to be culturally destroyed over the 19th and 20th century with arrival of Austro-Hugarians to Bosnia and through various wars that ripped through the country since (see ‘Cultural Genocide in Bosnia‘). The oral tradition of teaching Sevdalinkas in Bosnia today is virtually non-existent, while the song has been hijacked by various other forms of music in the era of ‘world music’ movements, where one could argue that ‘anything goes’ musically speaking. Only a handful of true Sevdalinka recording artists live today.\"\n\nSee also Helen Walasek (2016). Bosnia and the Destruction of Cultural Heritage. Abingdon: Routledge.\n\nIn August 2016, my 1981 dress (see the photo on the left side) was copied in Sarajevo by dear Senida (see the photo on the right side)!\n\nIn 1981, I worked as a medical student in Bangkok, and was overjoyed to see the streets filled with silk shops. I bought some silk and designed and made the dress you see on the left photo (the photo was taken in 2014). In 2014, I was back in Thailand and was devastated to see that modern-day mass production has \"killed\" the local silk handicraft, as it has done with so many other handicrafts all around the world. Those with means, in all corners of the world, seem to be willing now to reduce themselves to crowding their wardrobes with clothes that lack true quality and diversity. The number of colors that is being used in these mass-produced materials, just to give one example, is disastrously low. And I watch the poor, in Africa, South America, and other parts of the world, I watch them being reduced to digging through heaps of second-hand clothes that people in the Global North have given to \"charity\" believing that this meant \"doing good,\" while these clothes are being sold off for profit, finally destroying also the local skill base among the poor.\n\nOn December 7, 2007, I was discussing this disaster with Zuzka Kurtz in New York. Zuzka confirmed that we need to educate people to respect the richness of knowledge and skill that flows into many handmade products, particularly those that honor long artistic traditions.\n\nI started to study local fashion styles back in 1974 and created \"cross-over\" clothes. Have a look at our World Clothes for Equal Dignity idea, for which I still look for support. Unfortunately, I no longer have time to be my own tailor, and the dress on the left side from 1981 is now very worn and in danger to fall apart and I repair it every year. Since I did not find the right material in Thailand in 2014 to make a good copy, I kept searching for it in other parts of the world. I was extremely happy to find the right material in the very last corner of the fashion street in New York in December 2015! (Foursquare Favorite, 224 West 40th Street.) I brought this material with me to Sarajevo and the lovely tailor Senida has now been so kind, in August 2016, to make a copy of my 1981 dress! See the photo on the right side. Senida is originally from Italy and she became very proud of the \"unikat\" as she called my dress. She has proudly put a photo of it up on her Facebook page!\n\n• Please click on the photo above on the left side or here to see more pictures from 2014 in Thailand. Click on the photo above on the right side or here to see more pictures of Senida's little atelier in one of the backstreets in the center of Sarajevo.\n\nOn 9th August 2016, I once more explored Sarajevo. Sarajevo hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics and I had the privilege of living near the Olympic Tower. The games helped define the history of the city and remain a symbol of better tomorrow. What people shared with me was that Sarajevo was a wonderful place before the siege of Sarajevo (1992-1995), and that nobody would ever have expected that something as terrible could ever happen, almost out of the blue. Many talked about one Sarajevo before the Bosnian war, and another Sarajevo afterwards, a Sarajevo they no longer recognize and feel alienated from.\n\nThen I passed in front of one of the wonderful \"almond boutiques,\" which seem to have survived from \"before to afterwards.\" A few steps further I met the amazing legazi of Gazi Husrev-beg (1480–1541), a Bosniak Ottoman sanjak-bey (governor) of the Sanjak of Bosnia, known for his improvements of the structural development of the urban area of Sarajevo and the construction of many important buildings. You see me here in the Gazi Husrev-beg Mosque.\n\nAt the end of this day's journey, I saw a poster in English and Arabic that invites people from the Gulf States to buy \"units\" in the \"most luxurious resort in Bosnia-Herzegovina.\" I could not help shudder: here some wealthy investors from the Gulf States aim at making more money by selling out Bosnian scenery in the form of standardized \"units,\" which the investors themselves would never touch (they would go for individualized mansions). The investors count on fooling people into giving them their funds for believing that they can climb the ladder of status by buying into mass-produced \"luxury\" and that this \"ascend\" will improve their quality of life. In short, here traditionalism and capitalism combine and betray their foundational ideals. They are hijacked by elite interests that violate the egalitarianism of early Islam on one side, and on the other side also the ideals of one of capitalism's fathers, Adam Smith, whose larger worldview was grounded in community rather than competition for domination.\n\nI was thinking of the region being a border-region, always exposed to being used and abused when powerful neighbors fought. Historian Ibn Khaldun comes to mind, and historian Arnold Toynbee, as well as peace researcher Johan Galtung. Galtung speaks of the \"periphery\" (versus the center), and also Toynbee speaks of the periphery, and, in a way, also Khaldun. However, while Galtung speaks of the exploited periphery where a culture of obedience is engendered, but also alternative solutions may emerge, Toynbee focuses on the embattled border region and the \"hardened\" culture it may give rise to. Former Yugoslavia could perhaps be seen as both. It carved out considerable independence at the periphery of the big power blocks after WWII, while its border culture may represent a facilitating factor for possible in-fighting.\n\n• Please click on the photos above above or here to see more pictures."
