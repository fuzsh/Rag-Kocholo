        "text": "LOCAL PRESS\n\nVucic: Zeman demonstrated how great, courageous people make history (Tanjug/RTS/RTV/Politika)\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Monday what outgoing Czech President Milos Zeman had said two years ago was etched in the heart of every Serbian citizen, and noted that no European leader was as popular in Serbia as Zeman. Speaking to reporters after signing with Zeman a Serbian-Czech declaration on cooperation, Vucic noted that, at the time, Zeman had demonstrated courage that was unparalleled in Europe even though the move had only brought him criticism in some Czech media and some European countries. \"He demonstrated how great and courageous people can make history. The Serbs will never forget that. I thank him and the Czech people, who have elected him so many times,\" Vucic said, thanking Zeman for his sincere friendship. \"Emotions and feelings are important but, even more so, the rational elements show how much our relations have progressed,\" he said. Vucic said he had received wise advice from Zeman about how Serbia should act when under tough pressure, but noted that he would keep the advice to himself. \"Every meeting with President Zeman is a great lesson to everyone,\" he added. Speaking about Serbian-Czech economic ties, Vucic said the volume of trade between the two countries had tripled in the past two years to 1.7 billion Euros in 2022, and added that he hoped it would exceed 2 billion Euros as early as in 2023. He said Serbia was working on many projects with the Czech side and that there were plans for numerous other projects in various fields. \"There are factories that want to invest in our defence industry... We are not selling weapons to Ukraine or Russia, but we will to others. That is why cooperation with the Czech Republic is good for us,\" he said. \"We condemn the invasion by Russian forces, we respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We will take part in construction of Ukrainian cities - we have received a request from the Ukrainian ambassador. We are the only country that has not imposed sanctions on Russia, we have problems with defending our territorial integrity, and we know that sanctions have brought no good to anyone,\" Vucic also said.\n\nVucic: Why is only Serbia's territorial integrity not respected?\n\nSpeaking to reporters after a meeting with Zeman, Vucic said that, to a great extent, they were in agreement on the Ukraine war, and noted that Serbia respected the territorial integrity of Ukraine but that Serbia's own territorial integrity should be respected, too. \"We are not an EU member state yet, even though we are on the European path, but we are not a member of the North Atlantic alliance either, and 19 NATO countries bombed our country 24 years ago. Those memories are very vivid here - around 2,500 people, including 82 children, were killed then,\" Vucic said at a press conference with Zeman in response to a query by Czech reporters whether they agreed on the issue of Russia sanctions and on a solution to the Ukraine war. Vucic noted that Western media had run articles alleging that Serbia was set to attack someone in the region. A year after the start of the Ukraine war, Serbia has not attacked anyone, Vucic noted. \"No one has said 'sorry' to us, because the pattern of untruths about Serbia is ongoing, and someone must justify their unlawful moves from 1999,\" he said. He noted that Serbia respected the territorial integrity of Ukraine, UN resolutions and the UN order. \"Why do others not respect UN SC Resolution 1244?\" he asked. \"My question to representatives - the 'fives' the 'fours', the 'threes' and all those coming to Belgrade: How come you have respect for all UN resolutions, except for the one concerning Serbia's territorial integrity? Then what do you expect from the Serbs?\" Vucic added.\n\nZeman: We have not derecognised Kosovo, but we never sent ambassador to Pristina (Tanjug/RTV/RTS/Politika)\n\nCzech President Milos Zeman said on Monday in Belgrade he had tried to get his country to derecognise Kosovo and that the attempt had been unsuccessful, but that neither he nor his predecessor had consented to Prague sending an ambassador to Pristina. \"I tried to get the Czech Republic to derecognise Kosovo. I would like to remind you that the Czech parliament had called on the Czech government not to recognise Kosovo,\" Zeman told reporters at a joint press conference with Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic. Unfortunately, the political situation changed, he said. \"That is democracy, the forces that recognised Kosovo won, and I am not a dictator, but a democratically elected president,\" he said. Zeman recalled that neither he nor his predecessor Vaclav Havel had consented to sending an ambassador to Pristina. He also said he was very appreciative of the fact he would posthumously be honoured with a street in Belgrade and added that he was proud to have received Serbia's highest state honours. He said Vucic, too, had received the Order of the White Lion, the top state honour in the Czech Republic. \"We discussed bilateral cooperation, we have a successful business exchange, as well as international cooperation. I would like to remind you that, about two years ago, during Vucic's visit to Prague, I said I apologise for the Czech Republic's consent to the bombing of Serbia. I asked to be forgiven for having done that only once in my life. I deliberately said that in Prague because, had I said that in Belgrade, it would have looked different,\" Zeman said. \"I appreciate the fact Serbia has condemned the Russian aggression on Ukraine, because no country can be allowed to attack its neighbour for no reason,\" he said. He also congratulated Serbia on its successful economic results, including its budget surplus. Zeman thanked the Serbs for the friendship they showed to Czech refugees in 1938 and 1968. \"I am firmly convinced that the friendship will be continued,\" he said.\n\nDrecun: No continuation of dialogue and return of Serbs to Pristina institutions before formation of ZSO (RTS)\n\nThe Chair of the parliamentary committee for Kosovo and Metohija Milovan Drecun said before the session of the Serbian parliament on Kosovo and Metohija, that there is no room for other proposals for the ZSO because the Brussels agreement precisely defined what needs to be done to form the ZSO. “The first six-point Brussels agreement defines that there will be an association of municipalities in which Serbs form the majority in Kosovo. A community in which Serbs form the majority of the population, which means that there are also people of other nationalities. Membership will be open to any other municipality, if the members agree to that. Then it is defined that the two parties will form a management team for the formation of the Community and that it will be made up of the leaders of the four municipalities in the north of Kosovo and that they will draft the statute, which they drafted,” said Drecun. There is no continuation of the dialogue and the return of Serbs to the institutions of Pristina until the ZSO is formed, and then there is a discussion about the European proposal, Drecun told Radio and Television of Serbia (RTS). “This is an attempt at a political maneuver to adjust the appearance of the ZSO to Pristina’s view, although Kurti says that for him the Brussels agreements do not exist and that the ZSO will not be formed and that only minority rights should be discussed. He avoids using the terms used in the Brussels agreement,” noted Drecun. Drecun said that he considers the statute proposal made by the German non-governmental organization Friedrich Ebert to be an attempt by German politics to cheat the Brussels agreement when it comes to the ZSO. As he pointed out, the author’s text of American diplomats Derek Chollet and Gabriel Escobar is correct and “it is an interesting position that the ZSO is in accordance with the constitution and they see no reason why it should not be formed”. “The community would be an institutional mechanism, which Pristina would recognize, with the aim of protecting the Serb people, ensuring their safe life and economic development,” said Drecun. Drecun pointed out that there is no membership of Kosovo in the UN, nor do we accept to recognize the fake state of Kosovo. Drecun says that one can see a different concept of the US on the continuation of the dialogue than the one presented in the Franco-German plan. “The US has accepted the position of Belgrade. The position of the US is more correct because of the strong position of Belgrade, which said that there is no continuation of the dialogue before the formation of the ZSO and there is no return of Serbs to Pristina institutions,” said Drecun.\n\nDacic welcomes Croatian President’s “principled” statement on Kosovo (Tanjug)\n\nSerbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic welcomed Monday Croatian President Zoran Milanovic’s statement that Kosovo was snatched from Serbia, assessing that he showed principled respect for international law. What Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said, that Kosovo was snatched from Serbia, by force and illegally, is true, said Dacic. In the case of Serbia, international law, which everyone swears by, was most gravely violated, said Dacic, adding that international order, in which the sovereignty of states is untouchable and borders immutable, was destroyed in Kosovo. Dacic added that he is not getting into whether Milanovic has some internal political reasons for speaking this way about Serbia and Kosovo, but that what he said is the position of the president of a member state of the EU and NATO, which he welcomes.\n\nDeclaration of Saint Sava for salvation of Kosovo presented in Belgrade (Beta)\n\nA Declaration of Saint Sava for the Salvation of Kosovo was presented in Belgrade on Mondday, urging the authorities to “fully and without delay” reject the so-called German-French plan for Kosovo, because that was “vitally important for the survival of Serbia”. The signatories, including more than 200 intellectuals, public figures and politicians, warned that the purpose of “the ultimatum by the West is for us to renounce Kosovo and Metohija forever”. “The Declaration no longer serves to defend Kosovo and Metohija, but rather to save it. The essence of the plan is that Serbia should recognize the so-called Kosovo. President Aleksandar Vucic, only verbally for the time being, has committed himself to accepting the document by which Serbia recognizes the so-called Kosovo,” one of the signatories, a professor at the Faculty of Political Sciences and a representative of the Movement for the Defense of Kosovo and Metohija Caslav Koprivica explained. Also signing Saint Sava’s Declaration are the academicians Danilo Basta, Kosta Cavoski and Matija Beckovic, theater director Nikola Pejakovic Kolja, actor Viktor Savic, Dveri leader Bosko Obradovic, the president of the New Democratic Party of Serbia Milos Jovanovic, the president of the Oath Keepers Milica Djurdjevic Stamenkovski, and the president of the Movement for the Restoration of the Kingdom of Serbia Vojislav Mihailovic. The Declaration can be supported online as of Monday.\n\nGovernment submits proposal to parliament for special session on Kosovo (FoNet)\n\nThe Serbian government submitted a proposal to the parliament to convene a special session that would be addressed by Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic who would inform the MPs about the negotiating process with Pristina. At the same time, the Office for Kosovo and Metohija report on negotiations of 1 September 2022 and 15 January 2023 has been put in the parliamentary procedure. The proposal, signed by Prime Minister Ana Brnabic, was submitted to the Serbian parliament on 30 January. “Although the crisis in the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina has systematically developed and deepened since 2018, during this reporting period it undeniably reached its ultimate escalation point. The incumbent Provisional Institutions of Self-Government in Pristina, without a doubt, bear the sole responsibility for such developments, and since Albin Kurti’s coming to power, they have been intensifying the systemic discrimination of Serbs, with persistent refusal to implement almost all agreements and their violation,” reads the proposal. According to the announcements, the Serbian parliament session will be held on Thursday, 2 February. The documents forwarded to the parliament by the Serbian government make no mention of the Franco-German, that is, European proposal for resolving the Kosovo crisis.\n\nBilcik: EU often not treated fairly in Serbian public life (RTV/Beta)\n\nVladimir Bilcik, rapporteur for Serbia before the European Parliament, said on Monday that the EU was often not treated fairly in public life in Serbia, and that an abundance of myth and disinformation was one of the reasons for declining support to EU membership. \"It would be very helpful if the EU were treated fairly by politicians from different parties in public life in Serbia. When the time comes for hard decisions, the EU and politicians from the EU are always blamed, (it's) always the EU is exerting pressure. We don't pressure anyone. We are just working on the undertaking Serbia has signed on for (on joining the EU), Bilcik told Radio and Television Vojvodina (RTV). In response to Belgrade not joining sanctions against Moscow, Bilcik said Serbia \"must consider serious matters\", as \"without certain steps, progress toward the EU will be slow or nil\". Bilcik also announced that he would come to Belgrade in May or June with Matjaz Nemec, member of the Delegation to the EU-Serbia Stabilization and Association Parliamentary Committee, and launch a new round of parliamentary dialogue with a view to \"improving the quality of discussion and work of the parliament\".\n\nREGIONAL PRESS\n\nDodik says Serbs should seek solution to Serb national issue in Balkans again, in same way German people have addressed theirs before (RTRS)\n\nRepublika Srpska (RS) President and SNSD leader Milorad Dodik wrote in a column published at Dodik.net internet portal on Monday that Serbs should seek solution to the Serb national issue in the Balkans again in the same way German people have addressed theirs before, instead of waiting for “various mediators to mix us another pigwash.” “If someone fell asleep 30 years ago and woke up now, he would think he had only slept for one day. The main target of all perfidious anti-Serb operations was created in Washington, Brussels and Berlin. They are not tired of qualifying, disqualifying and sanctioning us. For them, the RS represents a problem of all problems, even when it conducts in line with the Constitution and Dayton and when it is functional, especially when having its own stance”, Dodik said. He reminded that the RS was formed on January 9 in order to protect the Serb people and to be an independent state, which was “the only realistic thing” during the breakdown of former Yugoslavia. Dodik warned that centers of power from the West attack the status and rights of the RS all the time. He also noted that pressure on Serbs in the region and Serbia as the biggest state in the Balkans has not stopped over the past 30 years. “The so-called German model for the issue of Serbian province of Kosovo is yet another fraud in the game of those with great power of influence who think that they can to anything”, Dodik assessed. He added that yet another question arises – “why the issue of the Serbian province of Kosovo is sui generis, while the issue of the RS is a matter of territorial integrity of B&H?” “Maybe we are not big enough to ask such questions, but we are that much responsible towards our ancestors and successors to ask and keep looking for answers”, Dodik concluded.\n\nSDP B&H Extended Collegium concludes that SDP B&H no longer wants ‘For New Generations’ as its coalition partner (BHT1)\n\nThe Extended Collegium of SDP Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) held a session in Sarajevo on Monday in order to discuss further steps after the situation in which SDP B&H has been left without a single delegate in the B&H House of Peoples (HoP). Namely, at last week’s session of the Federation of B&H (FB&H) House of Peoples (HoP), delegate Zlatko Miletic from ‘For New Generations’, which is also part of political bloc known as ‘The Eight’, was elected a delegate in the state parliament’s HoP although SDP B&H had its own candidate list. The Extended Collegium of SDP B&H concluded that it no longer wants ‘For New Generations’ as its coalition partners and this political party is set to discuss this issue with other coalition partners from ‘The Eight’ at a meeting planned for Tuesday. According to the Extended Collegium of SDP B&H, ‘For New Generations’ has betrayed SDP B&H as its coalition partner by nominating and electing Miletic in the B&H HoP. Addressing media after the session of the Extended Collegium of SDP B&H, SDP B&H Vice-President Vojin Mijatovic harshly noted: “For SDP B&H, ’For New Generations’ no longer exists.” Mijatovic announced that the Extended Collegium also concluded that cantonal organizations need to carry out talks on formation of cantonal governments as soon as possible “with the emphasis on Sarajevo Canton (SC), Una-Sana Canton (USC), and Tuzla Canton (TC)”. Mijatovic also pointed out that the Extended Collegium concluded that the process of formation of the FB&H government needs to be completed urgently, and the process of appointment to functions in B&H institutions will significantly slow down until the FB&H government is formed. Mijatovic explained that this will happen because, until the FB&H government is formed, SDP B&H’s ministers in the B&H Council of Ministers (CoM) will endorse only the appointment of officials to functions that are essential for the functioning of the B&H institutions. On the other hand, SDP B&H’s delegate in the FB&H HoP Irfan Cengic expressed concern that the process of the FB&H government formation will be hindered by SDA and that it will not go as easily as it is expected. Mijatovic also said that as far as it concerns SDP, there is no longer ‘The Eight’, but ‘The Seven’ coalition, because they do not consider ‘For New Generations’ a favorable partner for formation of the FB&H authorities. Mijatovic stated that they believe that ‘For New Generations’ is one of reasons why SDP lost an important position in the B&H HoP. Reacting to the news that SDP B&H no longer wants ‘For New Generations’ as its coalition partner, ‘For New Generations’ issued a press release noting that they found out about the information from media and they demand from other coalition partners from ‘The Eight’ to take a stance on it as soon as possible.\n\nEfendic reacts to SDP’s position on ‘The Eight’ coalition: Very strange and unexpected reaction from that party (O Kanal)\n\nSB&H leader Semir Efendic reacted to SDP's position on ‘The Eight’, i.e. that they were betrayed by their partners SB&H, NES and the party ‘For New Generations’ and the fact that SDP no longer considers party ‘For New Generations’ as part of negotiations. SB&H, along with NES, has already left ‘The Eight’ at the B&H level, and it seems that SB&H is not far from leaving ‘The Eight’ at all levels, commented the presenter. Efendic stated: “I must say that there was a very strange and unexpected reaction from that party after the election of delegates to the B&H House of Peoples on Friday. But I believe that it is caused by internal problems within that party, within SDP. Therefore, SDP has two Bosniaks in the FB&H House of Peoples. Their partner from ‘The Troika’, NiP (People and Justice), has five and I think that Our Party (NS) has none. So, those two parties have a total of seven delegates, in order to elect two state delegates, they would need a total of eight votes, but SDP gave priority and the possibility in four cantons for NiP to have their own delegates and thus actually gave all its strength from the cantonal assemblies to that party. And it is interesting why they did not ask for that vote from them, especially because it is known that SB&H and NES have not been part of the parliamentary majority at the B&H level for two weeks”. According to the information of O Kanal and Oslobodjenje, the meetings of individual leaders of ‘The Eight’ began immediately before the meeting announced for Tuesday. According to O Kanal’s sources, the coalition will probably survive, and an agreement of the partners will be reached.\n\nHR Schmidt addresses UK parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs responding to questions about formation of authorities and European path of B&H (BHT1)\n\nHigh Representative (HR) Christian Schmidt addressed the UK parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs via video link on Monday. Schmidt was asked by the Committee members about issues in B&H, including formation of authorities and the European path of B&H. Committee members were most interested to learn the reasons why the HR imposed amendments to the Election Law of B&H on October 2, 2022, in the night after the closing of polling stations within the general elections. In a one-hour long hearing before the Committee, Schmidt assessed that it has come to a shift in authorities in B&H and a new dynamic has been established since the return of RS’ representatives into the B&H institutions. Schmidt stressed that it was possible to hold elections in October 2022, and it was impossible to resolve all issues that would prevent electoral frauds, adding that the legislative and executive authorities at the state level have been formed. He assessed that forming a coalition authority at the level of the FB&H remains a challenge. UK parliament MP and Chairwoman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Alicia Kearns asked Schmidt why his decision to impose amendments to the Election Law of B&H only has influence on the processes in the FB&H and not the RS, and Schmidt responded: “This was a decision on functionality. You cannot expect for the HR to resolve all problems from the last 27 years.” Asked by UK parliament MP Chris Bryant about membership of B&H in the EU, the HR assessed that the EU candidate status, which has been granted to B&H, is a good thing and B&H still needs to work on harmonizing its legislation with the EU legislation. UK parliament MP Drew Henry asked the HR why he imposed the decision on amending the Election Law in the election night. In this regard, Schmidt responded that the amendments were not formalized at that time. Schmidt was also asked by the MPs whether he will use the Bonn powers against politicians from the RS, who are in authorities and are included in blacklists of the US and the UK, to which he replied that he wished this were the time like that of former HR Paddy Ashdown who had stronger support of the international community. “I will not exclude that option, but I would not use the Bonn powers yet. Instead, I would rather think about financial conditioning of the RS. The RS is one of the poorer parts of B&H and it needs money and support. Dodik’s decision to award recognition to Putin has slightly led us in a different direction”, he noted. Responding to the MPs’ questions about marking of 9 January as the RS Day, Schmidt promised that it will not be marked next year in the way it was this year. Schmidt called the RS parliament’s decision to adopt the Law on Immovable Property Used for Functioning of Public Authority in the RS as nonsense as it is contrary to the B&H Constitutional Court (CC)’s decisions. When it comes to Russian influence in B&H, the HR concluded that the international community would have to engage itself in case it proves that the Wagner group from Russia has been recruiting people from B&H to fight in Ukraine.\n\nNovakovic-Bursac: Schmidt’s statements remind me of attempt to revitalize colonial organization (RTRS)\n\nAddressing the UK parliament Foreign Affairs Committee on Monday, Christian Schmidt stated that he would like to be as (former High Representative) Paddy Ashdown, but that he will not use Bonn Powers against RS officials now. Asked by the UK MPs about possible removal of the RS politicians who are under the UK sanctions, Schmidt said that it is better tactics to financially condition the RS as it is not richer part of B&H, reminding that Germany and the EU have blocked funds for some of the projects in the RS. He also stressed that the marking of 9 January as the RS Day in 2024 will not be like this year’s. “January 9 was demonstration of the RS’ identity but the RS is a multi-ethnic entity and the next 9 January will not happen in the same way as this one. If the Wagner group starts recruiting young people like it was the case in Serbia, I will call for reaction of the international community”, Schmidt stated. Answering the questions of the UK MPs, Schmidt said that there is Russian influence in B&H. RTRS commented that Schmidt did not offer any explanation proving his claim, but it was suitable for anti-Russian mood in the UK to see now Schmidt spreads misinformation about the alleged Russian influence in B&H. At the beginning of his address, Schmidt accused RS President Milorad Dodik of political obstructions, but he praised the rapid formation of authority in B&H after the general elections. Reporter concluded that in his address that lasted for couple of hours, Schmidt was justifying his interventions on the Election Law of B&H, thus confirming that problems in B&H are not present in the RS but in the FB&H where the government structures have not been formed for more than eight years due to disordered relations between Bosniaks and Croats. Commenting on Schmidt’s statements regarding 9 January, the RS officials said that this is not a colony and that his plans will not be realized. SNSD’s Snjezana Novakovic-Bursac said that Schmidt’s statements remind her of attempt to revitalize colonial organization, having in mind that Schmidt as the illegitimate HR addressed the parliament of a country that is a symbol of colonialism. Analysts deem that there are many untrue facts and twisted theses Schmidt presented in his address before the UK Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, noting that it is indicative that he spoke about the EU candidate status and the EU path of B&H before the UK MPs whose country left the EU. The speaker of the RS parliament Nenad Stevandic said that the RS will be forced to declare the High Representative Christian Schmidt persona non grata, regardless of the fact that the RS does not recognize him, noted the presenter. Commenting on Schmidt's hearing before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the UK parliament and his advocating the introduction of economic sanctions against the RS, Stevandic stated that Schmidt overstepped the boundaries and that the people never trusted the occupier, as well as those who behave that way. He added that it is a fascist tendency and that it cannot be called anything else.\n\nPicula: Schmidt stands firmly on the ground and he has support of politicians within EU; Klokic: Schmidt is perhaps physically standing on the ground, but legally he is hovering in the air (ATV)\n\nATV reports that after being heard before the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET), Christian Schmidt Monday addressed the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the UK parliament about the situation in B&H. Croatian member of the European Parliament Tonino Picula also commented on Schmidt’s address before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the UK Parliament. Picula stated that Schmidt stands firmly on the ground and that within the EU he has the support of politicians who know the real political situation in B&H. Criticisms against High Representative are one-sided, he stands firmly on the ground’ not signed carried Picula who said he expect that the new authority in B&H gets serious in terms of resolving accumulated problems. Picula further said that the beginning of 2023 cause certain concern, foremost because of Milorad Dodik’s actions, who again marked 9 January as RS Day. Minister for European Integration and International Cooperation of RS Zlatan Klokic stated that Christian Schmidt can firmly stay on the ground in physical sense, but when it comes to the international law he (Schmidt) is hovering in the air because he was not legitimately appointed. Klokic’s statement came as reaction to statement of Picula. Klokic also stated that the RS was born on 9 January and that people in the RS said in a referendum they want to mark 9 January as the RS Day, no matter if the Constitutional Court of B&H declared it unconstitutional.\n\nPlenkovic meets with Covic in Zagreb; says after formation of authorities in B&H, key political issues need to be resolved in order to make step forward for all reforms on B&H's European path (AJB)\n\nCroatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic met with HDZ B&H leader Dragan Covic in Zagreb on Monday. Plenkovic said that after the formation of the authorities in B&H, key political issues need to be resolved in order to make a step forward for all reforms on B&H's European path. Covic and Plenkovic prioritized changes to the B&H Election Law, stating that this would give momentum to the establishment of better relations in B&H, as well as other economic reforms. Plenkovic and Covic said that they see Borjana Kristo’s (HDZ B&H) appointment as the Chairwoman of the B&H Council of Ministers (CoM) as an opportunity to improve the relations between B&H and Croatia on a bilateral level, but also around joint infrastructure projects. Covic and Plenkovic concluded that political dialogue of representatives of all three constituent peoples has no alternative in reaching agreement on the Election Law of B&H, which would give momentum in terms of consolidating internal relations and creating positive climate for the necessary reforms. Covic thanked PM Plenkovic on all the efforts aimed at helping the Croats in B&H. Plenkovic stressed the need for quick formation of authorities at all levels in B&H, especially in the FB&H, in order to secure functionality of institutions and the state. Covic also met with Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlic Radman and the meeting focused on the European path of B&H and transfer of Croatia’s experiences in the process. Covic also met with Croatian Finance Minister Marko Primorac and Minister of Health Vili Beros.\n\nMilanovic puts annexation of Crimea in regional context, saying that Kosovo has been taken from Serbia (HRT)\n\nCroatian President Zoran Milanovic commented on current political events today. He referred to the departure of Croatian soldiers as part of NATO's activities in Lithuania.\n\nHe also commented on the state of supplies in the Croatian army and the war in Ukraine. “We will not be brought to depend entirely on the will of others”. President Zoran Milanovic pointed out that Croatian soldiers go to Lithuania to train and warned that Lithuania is a member of NATO. “It wouldn't be fair not to go there. That would be a lack of solidarity,” said Milanovic. “We cannot and will not be led to completely depend on someone else's will over which we have no influence. I see that the head of NATO is in South Korea and Japan. I have known the man for twenty years, he does not represent me and my country there. It is not a NATO area, but it is in the neighborhood of China. It has nothing to do with Croatia. Things are being done over which we have no influence, and no one is asking us, and they can seriously oblige us tomorrow,” added the president. He added that Ukraine is a story that needs to be monitored 24 hours a day.\n\nOur inventory is miserable!\n\nPresident Milanovic commented on the state of supplies in the Croatian army. He emphasized that he acquired the howitzers and that soon after that he ceased to be the prime minister, and that in the meantime no ordinance was acquired. “We bought a BMW, we drive it in second gear, butcher it like a common last butcher. Who is responsible for that? I'm not. Otherwise, the stock situation is miserable. They go up with quality equipment that they cannot use in a serious way because we only have ammunition up to sixteen, seventeen kilometres. That's World War II level. And someone is responsible for that, as well as for empty warehouses,” said Milanovic. He said that five ships were ordered, there were terrible delays, and the company went bankrupt.\n\nOn the war in Ukraine: We and the Serbs did not hate each other so much\n\nPresident Milanovic also commented on the situation in Ukraine. “That should be taken out. In principle, I am against sending funds there. People are dying there, and there is no plan”, he said. He emphasized that some in the European Parliament are talking about \"tearing up Russia\", and that this is crazy. “We and the Serbs didn't hate each other that much. This madness, if you can't put an end to it, get away, because it will transfer to you,” he pointed out. “I mentally prepared myself for the fact that we will be brought to the status of clowns. The Croatian Democratic Union made us like that, but I won't let us become circus poodles, and that's what some are trying to do to us,” he said. He emphasized that in the war between Russia and Ukraine, the stakes were raised high and that neither of them can back down. “It is dangerous and I have been saying this since a year ago and the attack on Ukraine,” said Milanovic. “From 2014 to 2022, we are watching someone provoke Russia with the intention of starting this war. It broke out. It's been a year; we're just now talking about tanks. We will send all the German tanks there, the Russian ones have burned out. The same fate awaits these others,” added the Croatian president. “This is not a question of morality, where until yesterday people were playful pacifists in dresses and now they would tear people apart. The solution is not a change of government in Russia. German tanks in Kharkiv will bring them closer to the Chinese,” he pointed out. “This is not a good thing to do,” he warned. He said that this is about going for \"scorched earth\".\n\nAbout Kosovo\n\nPresident Zoran Milanovic, commented on the situation in Kosovo. “This is questioning the whole concept, in which someone thinks they have the right. The same with Crimea - Crimea will never be Ukraine again. This is what the leading German generals are saying,” Milanovic said. He warned that thousands of people are dying in Ukraine. “We are getting deeper and deeper into the conflict with a superpower. You know how they end up losing the war? They use nuclear weapons,” said Milanovic. “Serbia and Russia are not the same. Unfortunately, this is a painful fact and a danger. We annexed Kosovo. We and the international community. It was taken from Serbia. Who did it but us? Have we recognized Kosovo? It's not annexation, it's expropriation. What is it called? Extraction. This is not bringing Kosovo into the issue, but the whole concept,” he said. He added that he is trying to open the eyes of others because \"we are entering a war with a superpower\". He emphasized that Russia is a dangerous country. “You don't understand anything. You are comparing the Serbs, those peasants who rebelled here, with the world's nuclear superpower,\" he pointed out. “I see what is happening, how crazy emotions are leading Europe into something it will not be able to cope with,” he said. “Ukrainians pathologically hate Russians, that's a fact. The Croats did not hate the Serbs as much as they hate the Russians there,” he said. He pointed out that Russia will not allow a loss in the war, if necessary - it will resort to nuclear weapons. “German tanks in Russia? Good luck with that,” Milanovic added. He warned that Russia is a dark country. “Black is dark, that's not good. However, it has something it sees as its own interest, and we are going into conflict with them. You know who acts like that? The one who pays with other people's money,” he said. “The question is how much we will help Ukraine. This is not help, this is torture. They should have been forced to the negotiating table. Three hundred thousand Ukrainians must die. It hurts my heart to watch it. It's about those who force them to watch it from cities that are not at war. They know they are safe, their cities will not burn. This is Armageddon, I'm not a believer, but I'm well-read about it,” said Milanovic.\n\nOpposition parties in Croatia shocked by Milanovic statements; Argue that his statements benefit only Vucic and Dodik (Jutarnji list)\n\nJutarnji list comments that the newest statements of Croatian President Zoran Milanovic regarding Ukraine and Kosovo, caused eruption of enthusiasm in Russia and Serbia, while shocking major part of Croatian public. Croatian MP Arsen Bauk (SDP) commented Milanovic’s statement that Croatia, together with the international community annexed and took away Kosovo from Serbia, saying that he sees Milanovic’s statement as a metaphor which Milanovic used to underline the fact that four NATO member states and five EU member states, have not recognized Kosovo, because they have reservations toward the way in which Kosovo obtained independence. Bauk stressed that it is important that Milanovic said that he supports Kosovo and noted that SDP has no reservations. ‘Most’ leader Bozo Petrov stressed that there is no sense in comparing Kosovo and Ukraine, thus try to relativize the matters, adding that Russia is the aggressor and Ukraine is the victim. Stressing that he is bothered by any attempt of relativization, wondering why would President do this. Most’s Nikola Grmoja told daily that Milanovic should return to factory settings, reminding him that at the beginning of Russian invasion Milanovic called on Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic to thread carefully and that Croatia as small country should not push to the front line in this conflict. Hence, Grmoja noted, Milanovic should take his own advice, noting that his inflammatory statements mean that he is interfering in this matter and then Russia is using his statement to their propaganda purposes. Daily comments that majority of EU members recognized Kosovo and maintains good political relations with the country, the newest Milanovic’s statement shocked the part of opposition parties. Croatian MP Sandra Bencic (‘Mozemo!’) stated they do not agree with this statement, reminding that Croatia recognized Kosovo in 2008, they kept good relations with the country, even during the time when Milanovic was acting as a Prime Minister and they have good diplomatic relations, hence there is no need to undermine them with such statements. Secondly, Bencic noted, it is not good to give such statements during the uncertain situation caused by Russia’s attack on Ukraine, noting that this opens space for speculation about changing of borders in the Balkans and this is not good for keeping the peace in the region, which is priority for Croatia. She concluded that Milanovic’s newest statements benefit only “characters such as Aleksandar Vucic and Milorad Dodik”.\n\nRussian media, officials welcome Milanovic’s statements (Jutarnji list)\n\nJutarnji list reads that newest statements of Croatian President Zoran Milanovic were welcomed by Russian media and officials. Member of Duma’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Dimitry Belik said that Croatia experienced conversion because of Milanovic, and begun to comprehend consequences of anti-Russian politics. Belik reminded that Croatia took part in persecuting of Russian diplomats and sent weapons and other aid to Ukraine, noting that he is convinced that more and more politicians will accts Milanovic’s stances. Daily noted that lead Russian regime media also made a big deal about Milanovic’s statements, underlining that he is not anybody, but a president of EU member state. Daily reds that Milanovic’s statements are often cited by lead Russian warmongering journalists, such as Vladimir Solovyov who is known by statement that he would sink down the UK with a single rocket, or Margarita Simonyan who called for murdering of as much as possible Germans. Mentioning some other officials and journalists who welcome Milanovic statements, article concluded that Milanovic’s statements are serving the purpose of Vladimir Putin’s warmongering machinery, as they find here confirmation for their propaganda.\n\nDejan Vuksic, a candidate for president of Montenegro, aims to reconcile Montenegrins and Serbs (CdM)\n\nFormer director of the National Security Agency (ANB) and one of the leaders of the Democratic Christian Movement (DHP) Dejan Vuksic has confirmed today that he will be a candidate for the President of Montenegro. He has announced this at the press conference. “Our priority will be the Christian reconciliation of Serbs and Montenegrins. Our motherland is not another country but Montenegro, which is the most important to us. In ANB, I united Serbs and Montenegrins and national minorities, I had a dream team”, Vuksic has stressed. He has also said that he is ready to discuss the way of cooperation with the parties that are their natural allies, namely all those who sincerely supported the 42nd government whose prime minister was DHP leader Zdravko Krivokapic.\n\nAbazovic with Reinke: A functional Constitutional Court is the priority of all priorities, there must be no further delay and blocking of Montenegro's European path (CdM)\n\nPrime Minister in the technical mandate Dritan Abazovic met with the American Ambassador Judi Rising Reinke and on that occasion emphasized that the priority of all priorities is to vote for a functional and professional Constitutional Court. \"There must definitely be no further delay and blocking of Montenegro's European path,\" Abazovic said on Twitter.\n\nBecic: Montenegro has 100% compliance of its foreign policy with EU policy (CdM)\n\nThe president and deputy of the Democrats Aleksa Becic and the president of the Club of Deputies Boris Bogdanovic, in the continuation of their working visit to Washington, met in the United States of America with Admir Muzurovic, director for the Western Balkans in the National Security Council of the White House (NSC) and director of the Office for the European Union and regional affairs at the State Department, by Robert Lee. \"Becic told his interlocutors that Montenegro is one of the rare candidate countries whose foreign policy is 100 percent aligned with the foreign policy of the European Union, while the European Union in Montenegro enjoys the undivided support of more than 80 percent of the population, which is a record in the Balkans, according to all relevant public opinion surveys that are conducted in the country\", it was announced from Democratic Montenegro. Becic particularly emphasized that Montenegro has no open issues with its neighbours that can hinder it on its European path and added that Montenegro's membership in the EU and NATO is a key prerequisite for its economic development, safety, security, as well as further democratic development and overall progress. Whenever we were united with our European and Euro-Atlantic partners, all challenges were solvable, Becic told Lee and Muzurovic. \"The values that Democratic Montenegro stands for are absolutely compatible with the values of our EU and Western partners, and there is no compromise with them,\" said Becic. He particularly emphasized that the election of all four judges of the Constitutional Court is the only way to the full functionality of the Constitutional Court, where the Democrats will make their key contribution as before, because unblocking the Constitutional Court is a priority of all priorities. Director of the Office for EU and Regional Affairs in the State Department Robert Lee pointed out that the fight against organized crime and corruption and the fight for the rule of law are always complex and difficult processes, but they are also important for the European and Euro-Atlantic future of Montenegro. \"Thank you to Montenegro for supporting Ukraine. You have shown in crucial and difficult times that you are a reliable and credible NATO partner\", Lee said to Becic. The Director for the Western Balkans in the National Security Council of the White House, Admir Muzurovic, said that he was encouraged by the perseverance of our country in the process of making all the decisions resulting from Montenegro's membership in NATO, and emphasized that it is important that Montenegro continues to fulfil the resulting obligations. from the Stabilization and Association Agreement, in order to bring the EU accession process to an end as soon as possible. We expect Montenegro to resolve political and institutional challenges through dialogue in a democratic and responsible manner, said Muzurovic.\n\nMessages before 4 February: Goce Delcev’s commemoration should be peaceful and dignified, Skopje and Sofia to calm down the rhetoric (Republika/VoA/MIA)\n\nAfter Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski and his Bulgarian colleague Galab Donev in a phone call on Friday committed to a peaceful and safe celebration of the birth anniversary of Goce Delcev on 4 February, yesterday the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivan Demerdzhiev visited the country, and after the meeting with his Macedonian counterpart Oliver Spasovski said that no incident will be allowed at the commemoration set to be held on Saturday and that the Macedonian police is taking all the necessary measures in that direction. Meanwhile, the US urged Bulgaria and Macedonia to de-escalate their rhetoric and quickly resolve bilateral disputes. The US State Department told Voice of America when asked to comment on Bulgaria’s decision to withdraw the Bulgarian ambassador from Skopje. The future of Macedonia is in the EU. The US continues to support the country’s full-fledged Euro-Atlantic integration, the State Department said in a statement. Bulgaria withdrew its ambassador last week after the attack on the secretary of the Bulgarian club “Boris the Third” in Ohrid. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nikolay Milkov then announced that their ambassador will remain in Sofia until, as he said, progress is registered in relation to the treatment of Macedonian citizens with Bulgarian self-awareness in Macedonia. The Macedonian MFA, on the other hand, told MIA last night that the Bulgarian ambassador is, however, returning to his diplomatic duties in Skopje in full capacity. Currently, as Prime Minister Kovacevski says, there is no announcement for an official visit of a delegation from Bulgaria to celebrate the birth of Goce Delcev, but he points out that there is still time until Saturday. Kovacevski stressed that provocations by individuals, who have a name and a surname and who are sanctioned according to the laws in our country cannot be a basis and cannot represent a basis to consider that our entire country or our institutions have such a relationship. We are a country that has raised to the highest level the realization of the rights of citizens who self-determine in a different way than the Macedonians, who are the most numerous in the country. For that we have institutions, for that, we have a constitutional arrangement, for that, we have a series of laws that no country in Europe has. It is something we can be proud of, Kovacevski said. On the other hand, Kovacevski pointed out, Bulgaria is in the midst of elections and there are politicians who, with nationalism and populism, want to make a political profit, that is, to get more votes for the next elections in Bulgaria, the same thing happens in our country when we are in elections. However, they cannot be the basis for building relations between the two states. He said that the citizens can be calm and honour the birth anniversary of the hero and great man of the Macedonian revolutionary struggle Goce Delcev with dignity. Regarding the tensions, Kovacevski said that they were caused by individuals and groups who are against Macedonia’s European path and who are against the region’s integration into the EU. The ministers of internal affairs of Macedonia and Bulgaria, Oliver Spasovski and Ivan Demerdzhiev, promised that no incident would be allowed during the celebration of the birth anniversary of the Macedonian revolutionary Goce Delcev on February 4. This is in conditions of increased tensions and various announcements about the disruption of public order and peace. We want to send a clear message that no incident will be allowed, the Macedonian police are taking all actions and absolutely no incident must be allowed. That is to say, we will ensure the honouring that befits our great Goce Delcev. Thanks to my counterpart from Bulgaria for the clear and strong message that our friendship between the two countries and the two peoples will continue and we will jointly contribute to the stability of the two countries and the region, said Spasovski after the meeting. Demerdzhiev promised that he will make sure that the Bulgarian citizens who will arrive in Skopje will not cause provocations. We had a fruitful working meeting on all issues related to safe and peaceful honouring. Spasovski assured me that all security measures will be taken. I, on the other hand, confirmed that I will take all measures so that the people who will come from Bulgaria do not allow provocations or disturbance of the peace. We have come to an agreement that we have a duty not to allow some people to light a fire where there is none. The goal is to pay respect to a historical person like Goce Delcev and not to make it a ground for radical and pseudo-national calculations. Spasovski assured me that the case with Pendikov will be completely cleared up. The goal is to have prevention and not allow such cases in the future. Because such incidents disturb our relations which are at a high level. I handed over to my counterpart Spasovski documents from the case about the received threats on Pendikov’s life while he was in the hospital and the culprits will be held accountable before the law, said Demerdzhiev. The vice president of VMRO-DPMNE Aleksandar Nikoloski said that the party is for a dignified celebration of the birth anniversary of Goce Delcev. I expect that on 4 February there will be a dignified manifestation, a dignified celebration of the birth anniversary of Goce Delcev, said Nikoloski.\n\nDimitrov: We have become a Bulgarian province, every morning the government is apologizing to Bulgaria (Telma)\n\nThe government should not behave like a Bulgarian province and take measures against MEP Angel Dzhambazki if he plans provocations on February 4, former Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov said on a Telma. These are territorial claims and we must behave as a state, not as a Bulgarian province, and it is absolutely completely legitimate to take measures, but everything comes from the first – to face that there will be problems with Bulgaria if we pretend they don’t exist, commented Dimitrov. He criticizes the government for waking up every morning apologizing to Bulgaria. First of all, we need to escape from this panicked self-censorship, in which we will need to start the day by apologizing to Sofia. We need to calm down, sit back and see how to get out of this knot. We have no legal guarantee that this leads to the EU at all, let a European facilitator come in to sit down with the historians, if Bulgaria claims that we are artificial (an artificial nation), then let Berlin and Paris make their official statements that they are happy that one day the Macedonian language will become part of the EU. The thing with the amendments is tied to the negation, let’s discuss the Bulgarians in the Constitution, but to enter into force when we become a member in Brussels, Dimitrov argued. In his criticism of the government, he added that it is not trying to get any guarantees about what the Bulgarian conditions would end with. Our government behaves irresponsibly towards its people because it did not bother to get any guarantees that we have some kind of purpose. Europe has not delivered on its promises, and we have a responsibility to our people, that we have a package that will make some sense. We do not have such a package now. Have we started negotiations, or have we not started negotiations? The commission of historians will be a condition or not? he asks.\n\nBulgarian Ambassador Angelov to return to his diplomatic duties in N. Macedonia (MIA)\n\nBulgarian Ambassador Angel Angelov will return to his diplomatic duties in N. Macedonia in full capacity, after he was withdrawn by Sofia last week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has told MIA. After the session of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Bulgarian parliament on 25 January, the caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria, Nikolay Milkov, announced that their Ambassador, Angel Angelov, will be withdrawn from Skopje and will remain in Sofia until, as he said, progress is registered regarding the treatment of Macedonian citizens with Bulgarian self-awareness in the country.\n\nSantos: Time has come for the reform process to be accelerated (Radio Tirana)\n\nWithin 2023, Albania will start opening the first chapters of negotiations with the EU. The rapporteur for Albania in the European Parliament Isabel Santos said during a statement to the media that this is based on the progress of the \"screening\" process. \"I have a positive assessment of the way the screening process is going. I think that in September, this whole process will be completed. After that, we will start with the official negotiations of the two parties. Actually \"screening\" is a very bureaucratic process and at the same time it is not easy to deal with. But your country is responding well and I hope it continues in this way so that we can then continue with the reforms that are required during the opening of the chapters. I am confident that Albania can be a leader in the region as far as the membership process is concerned. I think that by the end of the year, the opening of the chapters will start, this is a reasonable time', Santos said.\n\nFiscal amnesty\n\nFurthermore, Ms. Santos also focused on the fact that the Albanian government has declared its determination to move forward with the criminal and fiscal amnesty. She has started a communication process with experts from the EU Office in Tirana to include their suggestions in the final draft, while the rapporteur Santos, when asked about this process, she explains that the consultation with the EU is important. \"Currently, the criminal and fiscal amnesty is only a project, it is not yet a law, nothing has finished. It is at the beginning of a process for any legislative initiative with importance and impact on the life of the country, during the negotiation process it must be done in very close consultation with the EU and of course respecting European standards. So I will wait for the results of the consultation and then give my opinion on this initiative. I know that the EU pays special attention to this issue and we are waiting for the final opinion of the experts\", she said. Also, Santos evaluates the position of all political parties regarding the issue of integration and based on this evaluation, she expresses the belief that the next local elections will be held in accordance with the standards required by European democracy. \"I see that all parties are seriously committed to moving the integration process forward. Therefore, I am confident that these elections will take place in full compliance with the norms required by democracy,\" she said.\n\nSantos: The government should respect media freedom\n\nMeanwhile, the rapporteur for Albania in the European Parliament Isabel Santos, while speaking about the freedom of the media, said that there should be tolerance for attacks against journalists as we have seen recently. \"Media freedom is a key value in the EU. The press plays a vital role in consolidation and must be strictly respected. We all have to be accountable in the media, it is one of the points of contact with citizens and allows us to deliver our messages. There should be tolerance for attacks against journalists as we have seen recently. We understand that you face problems from the past, but moving towards the future should not be oppressive. Property rights must be preserved,\" she added. On the other hand, Santos emphasized the great role that the Assembly of Albania will have in the future for the country's European path. She declared that the time has come for the reforms to be accelerated and not stopped. \"The time has come for the reforms and the reform process to be accelerated. Not to stop them, but to speed them up so that Albania becomes a leader in this process. I am very sure that Albania has the conditions to be a real vanguard in this process. There is a need to have a strategic vision for the path to be followed and a concrete plan for the steps to be taken. The role of the Assembly in the coming period will be very important. I understand all the steps you have taken to fully involve the assembly in this process. Now that you are moving forward, I believe that you can have a real step forward for the new legislation which will be drafted in accordance with the European one. The reform of the justice system is one such example. So a necessary reform which will strengthen Albania's progress in the field of the rule of law. The judicial system in Albania is on the right track to become healthier\", underlined the rapporteur for Albania in the European Parliament, Isabel Santos.\n\nIntegration in the EU, Albania in the meeting of the presidents of COSAC (Radio Tirana)"
