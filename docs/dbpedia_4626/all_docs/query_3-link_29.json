        "text": "The city of N. is cosmopolitan. I grew up in an environment where families of German, Italian, Russian, Jewish, Turkish and beautiful of gypsy origin. The only Greek Makridis family, Makrid, moved to our city in 1859 from Bitola, the consular city. Jovan and the brothers Spiro and Kosta were engaged in trade, and the youngest, Dimitrije, would come a little later and become the first permanent doctor in the city. In the letter of Pope Mašan Nikčević on April 25, 1885, to the Minister of Internal Affairs, Duke Masa Vrbica, it is written as follows: His Highness, the gracious Lord Zimus, was pleased to show favor to the Makrid brothers, local merchants, and gifted them a house, shop and heritage for their military virtues and loyalty during the uprising against the Turks.\n\nJovan and his brothers were successfully involved in catering in addition to trade. Jovan's son Filip went to Pečalba on September 23, 1907. In the port of Avr, he boarded the ship Brittany and traveled to America. His passport says: Philip Macready. Ethnicity: Montenegro, Montenegin. Filip returned from America with a serious fortune and registered the hotel Nikšić with 12 rooms, a bar, a restaurant and a billiard hall. I learned all this story, this information, from my best friend in the city of N., from Đorđe Makrid. Filip's grandson is a great connoisseur of blues and American jazz and has a distinct gift for storytelling. And about 15 years ago, he and his friend Voj Milović registered two elegant, European hotels, Yugoslavia and Trebjesa in the city of N.\n\nIn the courtyard of the hotel, the borders of the garden were still recognizable with paths lined with elegantly dug bricks. I spent my childhood in that yard and learned something about football, film, comics, Montenegrin history, mangupluk... The hotel was destroyed in the Second World War by the terrible Allied bombing. Half of the hotel was destroyed. A building with four apartments was built on the ruins. My uncle Jovan lived on the upper floor next to Makrida's house.\n\nĐorđe's father Blažo - Bato graduated from agronomy in Zagreb in the early 50s. Where he met Anka Pilić, who grew up in the old, left-wing part of Split. She studied history. She was born in Arapova street number 1. In Diocletian's city, the two got married and their son Đorđe was born. He brought the taste of salt and the sound of a song to our street: It's already the seventh night of unnecessary effort/because my dear is pretending to be crazy... Mrs. Anka Makrid taught me history at school. Her sister Blaga (I really liked her accent so I tried to imitate it) brought my sister Maria and me a selection of stories from Leo Tolstoy's New Alphabet. In the afternoon, while the sun slowly passes through the trees and the air blows through the pages of the book, my sister M. read me stories about dogs, Milton and Buljka. Buljka was a bulldog, completely black, only the ends of his front paws were white. He looked like an Arab. Milton was a birder, tall, thin, gray with freckles, long muzzle and ears, very strong and smart. Milton and Buljka did not fight. Young Tolstoy gave Milton to a Cossack hunter and took Bulgka with him to Pyatigorsk. He lived in the suburbs of the town.\n\nOne day Tolstoy returned from the spring and was drinking coffee in the garden. The noise was getting closer. Just like howling and barking dogs from the whole city. Tolstoy goes out to see what is happening and the landlady appears: Prisoners from the penitentiary are coming - dark dogs. Soldiers walked ahead, followed by four shackled prisoners. In front of the courtyard door, one of them caught a stray with a jackal, dragged him to the middle of the street, and another prisoner started hitting him with a club. The dog squealed terribly, and the prisoners shouted something and laughed. At that moment Buljka rushed headlong like he was chasing a bear and pounced on that prisoner. When the prisoner saw Buljka, he giggled, skillfully swung his club and pinched him in the thigh. Buljka slips away from him, but the prisoner pulls him close and shouts to the other: Strike! The others swung the club and Buljka would have remained dead in place, but he was torn, the skin on his side was torn and he, tucking his tail, with a red wound on his leg, ran through the kapijik, into the house, and crawled under the bed.\n\nMan's cruelty to animals repeats itself from century to century, from hour to hour, and that's why Mikloš Jančo made an ingenious film The white god, about the revenge of the dogs in the city of Budapest. Animals are gentlemen. Buljka and Milton finished almost at the same time. The old Cossack, instead of taking Milton only to birds, also took him to wild boars. And one fall, a cleaver, a wild boar tore it to pieces. Nobody knew how to sew it up and Milton was done.\n\nSix weeks after Buljka was bitten by a wolf, he began to lick young Tolstoy's hands, he felt the need to bite, but he didn't want to. He felt that Buljko was conquering him, as hunters say, a mild rage. Buljko ran away into the field, into the forest to look for medicinal herbs. He could not heal himself and went to some backwater to die without harming the young master.\n\nAnd we read the story, verbatim, The truth cannot be hidden. It was translated somewhere as a story God sees the truth, but he is not quick to tell it, and in the subtitle True event. In the city of Vladimirsk lived a young merchant Aksyonov. He had two shops and a house. He was good-looking, with light brown curly hair, handsome and a born jolly man. Once in the summer, a merchant in Njižnja went to the fair. Halfway there, a merchant acquaintance arrives and stops at an inn. Aksyonov preferred to travel in the shade, get up early, pay the boss and leave. After 40 species, he stops, has lunch in the inn's gazebo and plays the guitar some more. Suddenly, a trio entered the courtyard with flags. A bailiff with two cops came out of it. They searched the merchant's suitcase, and found a bloody knife in the bag. And the bailiff accused him of murdering that merchant acquaintance and robbing him of 20 rubles. His wife and children came to the city where Aksoynov was hiding in the beginning. Aksyonov was already gray. The woman told him that she had made a request to the king, stroked his hair: Vanya, my dear, tell the woman the truth, did you do it?\n\nWhen the woman also doubted, Aksyonov realized that he had only to pray to God. They sentenced him to whippings and prison labor. He spent 26 years in Siberia and gained a reputation as an ancient man. He went to the prison church, read the Apostle and sang in the choir. His voice was still pleasant. One night they brought new prisoners, and among them was Makar Semyonov from the city of Vladimirsk. It was the killer of that merchant. Aksyonov found him one night digging the ground under his soul, he was digging an escape tunnel. Makar threatened to kill him if he reported it, but also promised to take him with him. - You already killed me once, said Aksyonov. The guards noticed the dirt that someone had spilled while the prisoners were being led out to work. During the roll call, the warden asked Aksyonov if he knew who was digging the canal, so they could whip him to death. Aksyonov did not betray, and Makar came to Aksyonov one night and confessed everything to him. He begs him to forgive him, and that he will go to the manager and confess the crime. - May God forgive you, maybe I'm a hundred times worse than you. - And suddenly Aksyonov felt better. When Aksyonov was pardoned, he was no longer alive.\n\nAt the end of the story there was an almost childish drawing: a bird in a cage. Ink drawing on white background.\n\nThe two of us, sister and younger brother, read that story and cried like a clear stream, tear after tear.\n\nI neither knew nor suspected that that tear was the well and the source of what I do today. I scribble in blood. And schizophrenia footnotes. Pain is... Without emotion, without passion, there is no film, football, blues, literature. No play, no joy. Tool, form, figures, yes, content and other professorial and theoretical bullshit, that goes without saying.\n\nA tear falls on my volley.\n\nAnd Mijo Raičević's song Igra, from his first collection Emotional songs:\n\nbefore evening prayer\n\nyou snuck out\n\nfrom my bed naked\n\nthey flew after you\n\nall my stuff\n\nwhere you are playing now\n\nviolet bloom\n\ni know you are under the leaves\n\nand you wait for summer to come\n\nand you feel it\n\n(even though you won't say)\n\nhow are you\n\nbetween the knees\n\nthe softest shade\n\nit flows into the light"
