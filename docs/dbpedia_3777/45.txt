Human rights activist and publisher of Sahara Reporters, Omoyele Sowore on Tuesday said the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of Channels Television, Mr. John Momoh, as the acting chairman of UNILAG Governing Council is a sad day for the institution.

Describing Momoh as “incompetent”, Sowore in a tweet said he was rewarded with the appointment for being a media lackey of the country’s ruling All Progressives Congress Party (APC).

Momoh, a veteran journalist, is the President of the UNILAG Alumni Association.

Sowore, an alumnus of the institution, was President of the University of Lagos Student Union Government between 1992 and 1994 where he was involved in anti-cultism and anti-corruption advocacy.
