        "text": "We, the undersigned, stand in solidarity with members of the Columbia University community demanding that the University divest from Israel’s US-backed genocide in Gaza and the West Bank. We write to announce our initiation of an academic and cultural boycott of Columbia University and Barnard College.\n\nIsrael has undertaken a systematic campaign to destroy the Palestinian education system. Thousands of students, teachers and professors have been martyred, and 80% of educational facilities in Gaza have been partially or wholly destroyed, including every university, the Gaza Municipal Archive and hundreds of libraries, bookstores, and publishing houses.\n\nWe are appalled by the Columbia administration’s decision to call the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group onto campus, in full riot gear, to arrest over one hundred peacefully protesting students. At the time of the arrest, NYPD representatives stated that “students were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever” and that the assessment of “danger” was the University’s alone. We are appalled by the decision to summarily suspend these students at both Barnard and Columbia, and further, to evict Barnard students from their student housing. We reject the false language of “safety” President Shafik has invoked to justify these actions. Likewise, we reject as ludicrous the idea that the Columbia administration was forced to call in the NYPD because of the need to “protect students from rhetoric that amounts to harassment and discrimination.” Indeed, it is the University’s own decision to arrest, intimidate, criminalize, and punish students that has endangered their safety. If a university would rather arrest its own students than listen to their demands— if it would rather imitate the military tactics of a state that has destroyed every university in Gaza, burying students and colleagues under the rubble, than divest from it —then is it still a university? We see the administration’s actions for what they are: an embarrassing attempt to appease donors, trustees, and members of Congress by cracking down on students peacefully protesting the University’s complicity in genocide.\n\nTo this end, we are initiating a boycott of Columbia University and Barnard College until the following demands are met:\n\n1. Barnard College, Teacher’s College, and Columbia University must reverse and expunge all suspensions and charges from protesting students’ records, and immediately restore these students’ campus privileges. This includes reversing the suspension of the student groups Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine and Columbia Jewish Voices for Peace.\n\n2. University administration must remove police presence from campus and end the targeted repression of students involved in anti-genocide protesting, both on and off campus.\n\n3. Presidents Minouche Shafik (Columbia) and Laura Rosenbury (Barnard) must resign.\n\nWe call on academics of conscience worldwide to join us.\n\nUntil these demands are met, our boycott comprises the following actions, and will affect all non-clerical members of University administration, as well as tenure and tenure-track faculty.\n\n1. We will not participate in academic or other cultural events held at or officially sponsored by Columbia University or Barnard College.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to, workshops, conferences, talks, screenings, and invited lectures.\n\n2. We will not collaborate with Columbia or Barnard faculty who hold positions within the university administration in addition to their academic appointments.\n\nThis includes but is not limited to: invitations to academic events at our universities; collaboration on any new grants and workshops; co-authorship of papers.\n\n3. Some signatories may further engage in common sense boycotts of faculty independently of their administrative role based on faculty members’ particular complicity with Columbia and Barnard’s repression. Likewise, some signatories may engage in common sense boycotts of publications affiliated with Columbia University.\n\nWe endorse and reiteratethe demands of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment: divest all of Columbia’s finances, including the endowment, from companies and institutions that profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide and occupation in Palestine; and ensure accountability by increasing transparency around financial investments.\n\nWe stand in full solidarity with the brave students, clerical staff, graduate workers, post-doctoral workers, and faculty at Columbia, Barnard, and Teacher’s College resisting genocide, from Gaza, from Palestine, to Morningside Heights.\n\nTo sign please visit this link.\n\nSignatories\n\nMarc Lamont Hill, Presidential Professor of Anthropology and Urban Education, CUNY Graduate Center\n\nWendy Brown, UPS Professor of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study\n\nRobin D.
