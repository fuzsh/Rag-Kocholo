        "text": "PROFILE - AAZE THOMAS ADABA\n\nThe name Tom Adaba is synonymous with media and broadcasting in Nigeria. Beyond broadcasting, his mark as an outstanding Teacher, driven Leader, generous Philanthropist and loving Family Man has trailed his rich legacy. For over five decades, Tom Adaba has functioned in different capacities in the global media space. His influence on the next generation locally and internationally, is reflected in the many successful names in both private and public service, that continue to praise this mentorship.\n\nHis journey as a pioneer started at an early age. The first of six siblings born to a devout Catholic family of Joseph Abara and Mary Oniya Adaba in Asaba on Wednesday July 2, 1941, Thomas Aaze Adaba initially set out to become a priest. After a brief seminary stay at St. Peter Claver's Seminary, Okpala Imo State, that desire soon changed to joining the army. It was while training at the Advanced Teacher’s College (ATC) Kano in the 60s that he got his first feel of broadcasting, after successfully organising a debate among the students. That got the attention of the school authorities and he never looked back.\n\nOn completing his National Certificate in Education (NCE) in 1969, he moved to Ohio University on a US Agency for International Development (USAID) scholarship where he got his first degree in Mass Communications (cum laude). Adaba returned to Nigeria in 1971 to hold more teaching positions at his alma mater ATC Kano/Zaria. In 1974, he was a Senior Producer and Head of Presentation at the first television station to broadcast in colour in Nigeria, the Benue-Plateau Television BPTV (later Nigeria Television Authority, NTA NTA Jos).\n\nHis rich broadcast voice delivered the evening news with authentic authority, and educated the world at the second World Black & African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC ’77). As Controller of Programmes at NTA Jos, he created and hosted many original productions such as Quiz Time, Word Game, Family Time etc. In 1979, he took a 9-month break for his M.Sc programme in Educational/Media Technology in Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA.\n\nIn 1980, Tom Adaba was appointed the first Principal of the NTA Television College Jos, a training institution set up to meet manpower demands of the nation’s growing television industry. This gave recognition to the city of Jos as the creative production hub it is known as today; further giving rise to a new crop of programs that focused on government sector collaborations and on relatable social issues in Nigeria. Such include Cock Crow At Dawn, Behind The Clouds, working alongside players like the late Matt Dadzie, late Sonny Oti, Bongos Ikwue, Ene Oloja, late Sadiq Daba, and many more.\n\nWhile at the Television College, he pursued and acquired another Master’s Program M.Phil., and Ph.D. in Mass Communications and Theatre Arts from the University of Jos. On completion in 1989, he became the first Ph.D. holder in Mass Communications from any Nigerian University. Between 1990 and 1992 he continued to rise through the ranks within the industry serving as General Manager NTA Makurdi, Benue State and as Deputy Director Operations, NTA Headquarters Lagos.\n\nHis first-of-a-kind journey continued in 1992 with his appointment as the Pioneer Director General of the National Broadcasting Commission, the new regulatory body responsible for Nigeria’s broadcast license and codes. For the next seven years under his charge, the Nigerian broadcast industry changed the media landscape, birthing private media owners such as AIT/Raypower ((High Chief Raymond Dokpesi), Minaj TV (Senator Michael Ajegbo), STEAM Broadcasting and Communications Limited – owners of Cool FM, Nigeria Info, and Wazobia FM (Mr Amine Moussalli), Silverbird TV (Senator Ben Bruce), Channels TV (Mr John Momoh), Galaxy TV (Chief Steve Ojo), MiTV (Alhaji Murhi Gbada Busari); expanding new markets for pan-Africa satellite networks like Multichoice Africa (DStv); generating African-owned content that saw the influx of artistes, actors, producers, and technicians, thereby setting the stage for the Nollywood film industry.\n\nFollowing his retirement from public service in 1999, Tom Adaba has continued to consult and teach in the private sector through his Abuja-based media consulting firm, Trim Communications Ltd. He continues his public speaking roles, presenting papers on global subjects, and sits on some select boards. He is the proud recipient of numerous awards and accolades worldwide, including a National Honour: Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) and the Ohi Etohueyi of Ebiraland which means the Beacon of Light."
