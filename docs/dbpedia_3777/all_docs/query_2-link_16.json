        "text": "Bruce L. Miller, MD, holds the A.W. and Mary Margaret Clausen Distinguished Professorship in Neurology at the University of California, San Francisco, directs the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and is the founding director of the Global Brain Health Institute at UCSF. In addition, he helps lead the Tau Consortium and The Bluefield Foundation, precision medicine collaborations focused on developing treatments for tauopathies and progranulin-mediated forms of frontotemporal dementia.\n\nMiller is a behavioral neurologist who studies the underlying mechanisms of neurocognitive disorders and is a world-renowned expert in the diagnosis and management of dementia. Until recently, most cases of dementia were classified as Alzheimer’s disease with little awareness of the importance of non-Alzheimer dementias. Miller’s description of changes in behavior, language and emotion in the setting of aging have improved the separation of various neurodegenerative diseases from one another, in particular Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia. To support people after diagnosis, Miller has pioneered groundbreaking changes in the provision of care coordination for patients with dementia and their caregivers. His ongoing work includes overseeing a healthy aging program and an artist-in-residence program, both of which emphasize some strengths of aging.\n\nMiller has been featured in Fortune Magazine, The New York Times, 60 Minutes and the PBS Newshour. He has authored more than 1100 publications and written The Human Frontal Lobes, The Behavioral Neurology of Dementia, Frontotemporal Dementia, Genetics, Circuits and Pathways for Clinical Neuroscientists and Finding the Right Words, a book on Alzheimer’s disease from the perspective of a daughter written with Atlantic Fellow for Equity in Brain Health Cynthia Weinstein, PhD. He has received many awards including the Potamkin Award from the American Academy of Neurology, the Elliot Royer Award from the San Francisco Neurological community, the Robert A. Fishman Award and Lecture, the UCSF Lifetime Achievement in Mentoring Award, and the AAIC Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alzheimer’s Association. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine."
