He obtained his post-secondary education from some of the best institutions in the world, namely: Columbia University, New York, USA; St. John’s College, Cambridge University, UK; and London School of Economics & Political Science [LSE], University of London.\n\nAmong others, he holds a degree in Political Science [majoring in International Relations], Bachelor’s & Master’s in Law degrees from Cambridge University and LSE; and qualified as a Barrister in England and as a Barrister & Solicitor in Nigeria.\n\nGeoffrey Onyeama spent 29 years and 9 months at WIPO.\n\nHe started as an Assistant Program Officer and ended as Deputy Director-General, which is equivalent to Under Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nAt WIPO, Geoffrey Onyeama worked for many years in the Africa Bureau where he implemented programs promoting the use of intellectual property as a tool for economic, social, technological and cultural development in Africa, through policy development, strategic planning, legislative advice, institution strengthening and capacity building. In particular he played a crucial role in the elaboration of a road map for the development of a responsive intellectual property system in Nigeria. Nollywood and the music industry are direct beneficiaries and stakeholders of that intellectual property system and of course the Nigerian economy has grown substantially as a result.\n\nGeoffrey Onyeama, as an Assistant Director-General worked to promote the use of intellectual property as a tool for development in Asia, Arab Countries, Latin America and the Caribbean and worked to strengthen cooperation with industry and non-governmental organizations in Europe and North America and also to strengthen cooperation with the United Nations and United Nations agencies.\n\nGeoffrey Onyeama spent almost 30 years in WIPO promoting in our world, creativity, innovation, trade, culture and access to medicines through a flexible and responsive intellectual property system.\n\nAfter leaving WIPO in 2014, Geoffrey Onyeama returned to Nigeria and was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2015.\n\nHe served in that position until 2023 and was this one of the longest Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Nigeria’s history.\n\nAs a Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama pursued a policy of constructive engagement with all countries. In particular, he promoted democracy in West Africa and during his tenure, Nigeria played a crucial role in saving democracy in The Gambia and in guiding the successful democratic transition in Guinea Bissau as well as strengthening cooperation within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

There was also no serious industrial dispute in the University during his tenure that necessitated the truncating of the academic calendar. In the last year of his tenure (2007-2008) he served as the Chairman of, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities and concurrently served as a Board member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n\nOn completion of his tenure, he went on sabbatical as a visiting professor at the National Universities Commission, Abuja (NUC) 2008 – 2010, and served as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Private Universities, which processes applications for the establishment of private universities.

Her specialties are:\n\nCurriculum & Instruction, History, Social Studies and Girl-Child Education.\n\nThe First Female Professor from North-West Nigeria, our Celebrant had held quite a number of strategic public offices at the Federal and State levels. Among others, she served as Jigawa State Commissioner for Health and ater Commissioner for Education, Science & Technology. Both tenures witnessed tremendous progress in the two strategic sectors.\n\nAppointed Minister of Education of Nigeria in 2010, she had an eventful three-year tenure during which she was elected Chairperson, Conference of Education Ministers of the African Union [COMEDAF]. She initiated the One-Year Strategy and 4-Year Strategic Plan for the Development of the Education Sector which focused on key areas of Access, Quality, Teacher Education, Funding, Technical and Vocation Education. There were also boosts to Basic and Secondary Sector through the Almajiri Education and Boys Drop-Out Programmes. She similarly pursued the amendment of the Education Tax Act such that the Tertiary Education Trust Fund [TETFund] now focuses exclusively on the development and rehabilitation of infrastructure and human resources in the country’s higher education sub-sector.\n\nAs far back to her days as Education Commissioner in Jigawa State, Professor Ruqayyatu Ahmed Rufa’ has demonstrated deep passion for the education of the Girl-Child and often challenged the outdated notion that female children did not need to go to school as they will end up in the kitchen, as it were. That, of course, hardly endeared her to certain entrenched interests that tried to frustrate her efforts to provide access to girls to obtain a good education. In a media interview, she had bared her mind unequivocally: “‘I’m ashamed\n\nJigawa can’t enroll enough girls in schools”.\n\nOver the years, she has been dedicated to the cause of promoting access for the young girls and women to get a good education to improve their chances in life and make contributions to their full potentials.\n\nA woman of strong convictions – despite being relieved of her Ministerial appointment due to cracks in the then ruling political party — she returned quietly to her beloved classroom at Bayero University, Kano where she has been a Professor of Curriculum Studies since 2003. In her words, “..that is where I came from on secondment. We should know that a time like this would come because if it does not, death is surelv an end””\n\nIn the same vein, Professor Rugayyatu has been in the vanguard of the Kidney Care and Transplant Foundation Trust; vigorously mobilising support locally and internationally.\n\nWith over 30 publications in national and international journals and books, Professor Rugayyatu Ahmed Rufa’i has been severally acknowledged within and outside Nigeria.

By year two, there were 556 capital projects which included 194 on Education.\n\nAcknowledged as Borno State’s chief humanitarian officer, Professor Babagana Zulum is literally on ground all the time even at personal risk to ensure the delivery of good governance to his constituents many of who have been traumatised by security challenges.\n\nDeservedly, He has earned Fellowships from many high-end professional bodies, including: National Postgraduate College, Nigerian Institute of Agricultural Engineers, and Nigerian Institute of Architects, 2021.\n\nRecognition has also come from many other sources for this Performing Governor.

The first African to hold the post, he presided over an 18-Judge Court undeterred in their collective determination to discharge the mandate of humanity, despite serious political attacks directed at the Court by a most powerful government. With the unalloyed support of his colleagues, his leadership ensured that “the ICC became the principal pillar of the international rule of law; a key tool in the pursuit of international peace and the protection of humankind from unspeakable acts of inhumanity”.\n\nHighlights of his tenure at the helm of the ICC include: development of international law which made it clear that international law does not recognize immunity for heads of state accused of international crimes before an international court; judgments that underscored the importance of the ICC as a court of fair proceedings where everyone including accused persons would receive justice; a holistic systems review — the first of such an exercise in the Court’s history – to strengthen the ICC as an institution and maintain its independence as the cornerstone of its legitimacy.\n\nPrior to his appointment as a Judge of the ICC, Chile Eboe-Osuji had a brilliant career in legal practice and related assignments. As a Barrister, he appeared before trial courts in Nigeria and Canada as well as conducted appeals before the Court of Appeal for Ontario (Canada) and the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nAt the international level, he was also Legal Expert to Nigeria’s delegation to the ICC-ASP Special Working Group on the Definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n\nHe served as Legal Adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights — anchoring the High Commissioner’s interventions in cases involving human rights issues and leading the writing of amicus curiae submissions to the European Court of Human Rights and the United States Supreme Court.

He is the Editor-in-Chief of both the Nigerian Yearbook of International Law; and of the Canadian Review of International Law and Policy.\n\nJudge Dr. Chile Eboe-Osuji is the first official (incumbent or retired) from ICC to receive the prestigious Goler T Butcher Medal from the American Society of International Law.\n\nLadies & Gentlemen, we proudly invite His Excellency, Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji to receive the “Hallmarks of Labour-Emeka Anyaoku Life-Time Achievement Award to Nigeria’s Outstanding International Icon”.\n\nCongratulations Sir!\n\nA retired justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria and member, International Dispute Resolution Institute, Paul Adamu Galumje obtained Professional qualification in law from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and Nigerian Law School, Lagos; and was called to the Bar in July 1978.

In this capacity, he displayed tremendous courage, for example, in Suit no. TRSJ/56/2000 HON. ABU ISA AJIYA & 9 ORS V. HON. JOLLY B.C. YERIMA & 10 ORS. In this case, Speaker and his deputy were wrongfully suspended by the House of Assembly who was unable to convince two-third of the members to carry out their wish. They suspended both the speaker and his deputy and went on to appoint one of them a pro tempo.\n\nThe suspended Speaker and His Deputy went on to file a case in court and the said case was assigned to Honourable Justice Galumje. .\n\nA few days later pressure within and outside judiciary was exerted to persuade him to uphold the decision of the House of Assembly, but he did not succumb to the pressure.\n\nHowever, at the end of the case, Justice Galumje found out that the members who suspended the Speaker were wrong and he pronounced so in his judgment.\n\nFor this and many others, he was subjected to all sorts of maltreatment by the state. He lived with such conditions until 2005 when he was promoted to Federal Judiciary as a Justice of the Court of Appeal. Here again, the case of Alhaji M.M. Dingyadi & annor. V. INEC & Ors. Justice Galumje also displayed exemplary courage when the case came to the court of Appeal, and he was a member of the panel that took the appeal. Thereafter, intrigues set in when he and some members of the panel refused to be bribed to do the wrong thing. For this, they were subjected to queries. Indeed, this was the case that led to the suspension of his lordship, Hon Justice Ayo Isa Salami, the then president of the court of Appeal for no just cause. It is also important to note that Judgement in that appeal has not been delivered till date. Eleven years later, he was elevated to the highest court in the land – the Supreme Court of Nigeria where he retired from full-time service in April 2020.\n\nHonourable Justice Galumje has also served society in many other critical capacities. These include: Chairman of Commissions of Inquiry and of the Robbery & Firearms Tribunal, Taraba State.\n\nA member of the International Dispute Resolution Institute, Honourable Justice Galumje has presented papers at many learned fora across the country.\n\nHe is happily married with children to Mrs. Zeporah Galumje.\n\nLadies & Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to invite Honourable Justice Paul Adamu Galumje to receive the Hallmarks of Labour Life-Time Achievement Award for Exemplary/Courageous Service to the Advancement of our Legal System.\n\nCongratulations Sir.\n\nWe are here to pay tribute to Honourable Justice Andrews Otutu Obaseki, Bachelor of Science in Agriculture, Reading, United Kingdom; Bachelor of Laws, London & Barrister-at-Law of Lincoln’s Inn, London; quondam Chief Registrar, High Court of Midwest Nigeria; quondam Acting Chief Justice, Midwest Nigeria: Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria; Life Member, Body of Benchers; Fellow, Fellow, Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies; Commander of the Order of the Niger; accomplished Jurist; and The Obaseki of Benin Kingdom.

He thus had a varied and solid educational background which imbued him with a breadth of vision and high potential that were to yield good dividends in later years.\n\nIN his private legal practice spanning 1952 to 1958, Andrews Obaseki became a powerful advocate and brilliant solicitor. Observing his sterling qualities, Government invited him in 1958 to set up the legal department of the Nigerian Building Society where he also became the staff solicitor. The same year, he was appointed President, Benin Divisional Grade A Customary Court, which was a Court of first instance, and President, Customary Court of Appeal for Benin Division, which laid the foundation for his long association with the Bench. Though the remuneration from these customary court appointments was not comparable to the rewards from private legal practice, Andrews Obaseki, fired by a crusading zeal to reform the customary courts and bring justice to the people at all levels, accepted to serve.\n\nIn 1960, Andrews Obaseki was appointed the supervising authority for all customary courts in the then Benin Province – covering Benin, Esan, Afenmai and Asaba divisions at the time, visiting all courts, exchanging views with the members and reviewing cases as necessary. He organized training courses for customary court members to ensure that the courts developed as temples of Justice, and not into instruments of oppression or vendetta. This was to have a parallel at the Supreme Court. Reflecting on the Nigerian court system, Justice Andrews Obaseki asserts that “Justice in the courts is the same whether in the native courts, the High Courts or in the Supreme Court; the measure is the same and it is only when there is an error in the application of the substantive law that the different levels come in to make the necessary correction…” In the year 1963, he was appointed Chief Registrar of the high court of Midwestern Nigeria, with the tasks of setting up magisterial districts & judicial divisions and grading posts in the judiciary in the state. Barely a year later, in March 1964, he was appointed a Judge of the high court of the region; later acting Chief Judge, which he held twice. His career was laced not only with knowledge in the law but also sagacity and common sense. He was outstanding in his dealings with those he controlled and the litigants whose cases he sat upon. The big break came in September 1975 when he was elevated to the position of a Justice of the Supreme Court [JSC] of Nigeria. A highly visible and articulate member of the apex Court, Hon. Justice Obaseki soon established unambiguous traits: He became renowned in his judgements and writing. He fought his wars and he wrote Volumes. He philosophized, pontificated, laid down his rules and bestrode the Supreme Court like a Colossus. Hon. Justice Obaseki at all times maintained his integrity, contemplative dignity and far-sighted impartiality. From many of his judgements on the Supreme Court Bench, a flood of legal wisdom poured forth. When he spoke, it was in measured tones, soft but poignant, calm but deep. Few words were wasted as he enunciated principles, explained values and laid down rules. The inclinations of a teacher, historian, political scientist and sociologist were all reflected as he admonished erring lawyers, overruled illogical conclusions and canvassed a new and more liberal national judicial order. The height which he attained has been beautifully sketched by the Nigerian Law Publications Limited in their book Justice Obaseki, Supreme Court Years, 1975-1991: His Notable Pronouncements (1991). With some 658 judgements comprising 530 concurring judgements, 2 dissenting judgements and 126 lead judgements given over a period of 16 years, Hon. Justice Obaseki demonstrated his wide knowledge base – derived from extensive reading, intensive studies, meticulous research, deep reflections, writing skills and brilliant oratory. It is no wonder that his colleagues of the Supreme Court attributed to him the learning and wisdom of “Coke and Littleton” who for centuries have been recognized as the greatest of the English jurists. Indeed Hon. Justice Kayode Eso [of blessed memory] described Hon. Justice Andrews Otutu Obaseki as “a great man by any standard and any yardstick, indeed by any in the world one of the acknowledged jurists in contemporary common law jurisdiction, or without being immodest, certainly in the history of jurisprudence in this country”.\n\nDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here to celebrate a great Nigerian, a man of great intellect & wisdom, a Judge of Judges, among the finest and the best, a sage of liberal orientation, a philosopher, humanist and community developer. On the bases of his Exemplary and Courageous Service to the Advancement of our Legal System particularly in the area of Adjudication, it is with a sense of mission that we invite HIS LORDSHIP, HONOURABLE JUSTICE ANDREWS O. O. OBASEKI [JSC Rtd.] CFR, LL.D [Honoris Causa] a Great Nigerian, to step up and join the league of worthy recipients of the HALLMARKS OF LABOUR ROLE MODEL AWARD.\n\nCongratulations!!!\n\nProfessor Oyewale Tomori was born in Ilesa, Osun State on February 3, 1946.

He attended Ijebu-Ode Grammar School; Nigerian College of Arts, Science & Technology; and University of Ibadan. He holds the B.A. Honours degree in History and several other qualifications in international studies.\n\nA career diplomat with over four decades’ cognate experience, Ambassador Adeniji served Nigeria and the international community in many strategic capacities. He joined the Foreign Service in July 1960, and held positions in the Ministry’s headquarters and abroad. Among these, he was:\n\nMinister in Nigeria’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York.\n\nAmbassador to Austria.\n\nAmbassador to Switzerland.\n\nPermanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva.\n\nAmbassador to France.\n\nDirector-General [Permanent Secretary], Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nHe retired from full the Federal public service in 1994.\n\nBetween July 2003 and June 2006, Ambassador Adeniji served as Nigeria’s Minister of Foreign Affairs. The highly-respected ‘Negotiator par Excellence’ achieved a decent balance in the diplomatic postings of career & ‘non-career’ officers, and headed a number of delegations that helped restore Nigeria’s credibility in the comity of nations. He was actively involved in Nigeria’s de-listing from the financial blacklist countries; strengthening of ties with regional blocs; increasing concerted actions by ECOWAS member-States; and formation of the African Strategic Peace Research Group. Many Nigerians, who observed him direct the Executive Council of the 5th Session of the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, were overcome with a rare sense of national pride and dignity. He displayed the kind of soft power that is endearing to all, even as he acted firmly but sensitively against belligerent colleagues. He subsequently served as Minister of Interior.\n\nIn early March 2008, he was appointed Session Chair of the Eminent African Personalities Panel to oversee negotiations to resolve Kenya’s political crisis. In the same vein, he was Special Envoy of the African Union Chairperson for the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in Sudan.\n\nIn the United Nations system, Ambassador Adeniji served as the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative & Head of the UN Peacemaking Mission in the Central African Republic, with the rank of an Under-Secretary-General. He was the first Nigerian to head such a mission.\n\nHe was also the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative & Head of the Peacemaking Mission in Sierra Leone – thus heading the largest UN mission in history. He held that position for about four years; and at a critical stage in the peace-making & peace-keeping process in the war-ravaged country. Indeed, the success of that mission was worth the investment of the UN and the commitment of the accomplished diplomat and his team.\n\nAmbassador Adeniji also variously served as a:\n\nn Trustee, UNESCO Prize for Peace Education.\n\nn Member, UN Secretary-General’s Advisory Board on Disarmament.\n\nn Trustee, UN Institute for Disarmament.\n\nn Core Group Member, Nuclear Non-Proliferation programme.\n\nn Member, Expert Group on the African Union Conflict Resolution Mechanism.\n\nn Consultant to UNESCO.\n\nn Consultant to UNDP on Governance in Africa, which formed the basis of the Annual African Governance Conference.\n\nA highly-versatile diplomat and adept in multi-lateralism, he is widely-acknowledged as an expert in Disarmament and International Security.

He also chaired many international fora, including the 1st UN Conference on Inhumane Weapons and the UN General Assembly 2nd Special Session on Disarmament.\n\nThe author of the highly-acclaimed “Essay on Nigerian Foreign Policy, Governance & International Security” also served as Co-Chairman of an International Group of Diplomats and Academicians to study the burning issue of the global circulation of Conventional Weapons. In the same vein, he was Consultant to the international Peace Academy and a Senior Associate of the University of Lancaster, U.K and the Development Centre, Stadan.\n\nA Commander of the Order of the Niger and a recipient of the Nigerian National Productivity Award, Ambassador Adeniji has been honoured severally within and outside the country.\n\nHe is happily married, with children, to Mrs. Margaret Olubunmi Adeniji.\n\n***\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we present His Excellency, Ambassador Oluyemi Adeniji for the “HLF-Emeka Anyaoku Life-Time Award as Nigeria’s Outstanding International Icon”.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nAward Category: HLF-Emeka Anyaoku Life-Time Award as Nigeria’s Outstanding International Icon\n\nHonourable Justice George Adesola Oguntade was born in Epe, Lagos on March 10, 1940. He attended Holborn College of Law [University of London], UK (1961-1964); and the Nigerian Law School, Lagos in 1965. He was called to the Nigerian Bar on January 15, 1966. George Oguntade’s legal career commenced with a three-year stint as a Court Clerk at the High Court of Justice, Ibadan. After his call-to-bar, he engaged in private legal practice for 14 years and was appointed a Judge of the Lagos High Court in 1980, and then preferred to the Court of Appeal seven years later. On May 19, 2004, he was elevated to the nation’s apex court – the Supreme Court of Nigeria where he served meritoriously till March 10, 2010 having attained the mandatory retirement age of 70 years.\n\nUndoubtedly, Justice George Oguntade is one of the sharpest legal minds that ever sat on the Higher Bench in Nigeria. In his service on the Bench, he made his mark in the advancement of the nation’s legal system, even at great risk to his person. His many strategic postings included Chairman, Lagos State Armed Robbery & Firearms Tribunal; Justice of the Court of\n\nAppeal, Enugu; Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Ibadan; Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Jos; Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Lagos; and Presiding Justice, Court of Appeal, Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\nSuch were his sound judgments at the High Court that they were hardly over-turned by the Appellate Court. In the same vein, he worked very hard to clear back-logs of appeals at the four Appellate Courts over which he presided. Among the celebrated cases he presided over or co-handled were:\n\nJustice Anyebe Vs Benue [the Judge was sacked by the State Government, but the appeal court reinstated him after a reprimand.\n\nAmechi Vs Omehia/PDP [Amechi’s name was replaced by Omehia’s after the former was duly nominated. Omehia won the election, and the court ordered him to relinquish office to Amechi as the authentic candidate and winner of the Rivers state Governorship elections.\n\nJustice Oguntade’s tenure at the Supreme Court of Nigeria witnessed the delivery of many landmark judgments, which have impacted significantly on our legal system, particularly in the area of constitutional and administrative law. A fearless and courageous George, thorough and resolute in his reasoning, Justice Oguntade would not hesitate to disagree with his colleagues when the need arose.\n\nIn his dissenting judgment of the appeal by the Presidential candidate of the ANPP, General Muhammadu Buhari [Rtd.] against the declared winner, President Umaru Yar’Adua of the PDP, Hon. Justice Oguntade annulled the election and ordered a re-run. Interestingly, the President was to admit later that the election was flawed. So sound were his dissenting/minority judgments that rather than alienate him from his colleagues; they have set the tone for younger legal practitioners to explore other angles to similar cases.\n\nIndeed, his understanding of the law and the adjudicatory process as manifested in his judgments, are reference points to lawyers and law students alike. By his incisive and analytical pronouncements, he has contributed to the development of jurisprudence in Nigeria.\n\nJustice George Oguntade has over the years been invited to different fora to share his knowledge, experiences and perspectives on various aspects of law and jurisprudence.\n\nAmong his refreshing & illuminating presentations are:\n\nBarrier to Justice — The Nigerian Experience” [International Bar Association Conference, Chicago, USA];\n\nFighting Corruption and Money Laundering in Banking” [International Symposium on Economic Crimes, Cambridge, England];\n\nDissenting Judgments and Judicial Lawmaking” [Nigerian Institute of Advanced Legal Studies]; and\n\nSurely Justice is denied When Delayed” [Transcorp Hilton, Abuja]\n\n.Beyond the Judiciary, Justice Oguntade has also served society in many other roles.\n\nHe is Chairman, Customer Complaint Bureau, Nigerian Insurers Association and member, World Jurist Association.\n\nHe is Commander of the Order of the Niger and Commander of the Federal Republic.\n\nA God fearing man, he has been Chancellor of Anglican Diocese of Lagos since 1992 and the recipient of the First Anglican Communion National Award for Integrity & Excellence. Justice Oguntade is happily married to Mrs Modupeola Adewemimo with children and grand children.\n\n*****\n\nToday, Hallmarks of Labour Foundation is proud to invite Honourable Justice George Oguntade to receive the “HLF Life-time Achievement Award for Exemplary/Courageous Service to the Advancement of our Legal System, particularly in Adjudication”.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nAward Category: Hallmarks of Labour Foundation is proud to invite Honourable Justice George Oguntade to receive the “HLF Life-time Achievement Award for Exemplary/Courageous Service to the Advancement of our Legal System, particularly in Adjudication\n\nFemi Falana, lawyer and human rights activist was born 20th may, 1958 at Ilawe, Ekiti State. He was educated at the University of Ife now Obafemi Awolowo University Ile- Ife 1977-1981, and was called to Bar in 1982. After his youth service in 1983, Femi Falana joined the Chambers of Alao Aka Bashorun, a great Activist, and here Femi’s zeal for activistism was further nurtured. In 1991 however, Falana started his Chambers, Femi Falana , which later metamorphosed into Falana and Falana Chambers.\n\nA vociferous and dedicated voice in the fight for Human Rights and Justice for the common man, Femi Falana is also closely linked to many Civil Liberty Organizations. Example, the Civil Liberty Organization (CLO), the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC)……. He has fought several legal battles defending the right of citizens amongst which is the controversial dismissal of the Ilorin lecturers over their legitimate demands for justice. He also ably represented the Ogoni…………of the Niger Delta at the United Nations.\n\nHuman Right Violation Commission: A testament of his impressive performance at the commission is the directive to the Shell Petroleum Development Company to carry out clean-up operations of the Oil Spill in Ogoni Land.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the West African Bar Association under the leadership of Femi Falana amended the protocol, establishing the Court of Justice for Ecowas States whereby the court now allows individuals, as opposed to countries in the region alone, to have access to justice when their human rights is violated.\n\nMr Femi Falana is a member of numerous legal associations. These includes: The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), African Bar Association (ABA), Pan African Lawyers Union, Honorary member of the American Bar Association, etc.\n\nHe is an author of several publications among which are: Legal and Policy Framework of occupational health and safety in Nigeria titled “Working in Danger”; “Anti Labour Legislation in Nigeria Labour Rights’’; “Murder, plain murder in ken Saro- Wiwa and the crisis of the Niger Delta, and Fawehinmi verses Abacha: Where the Court of Appeal erred in social justice.\n\nMr Femi Falana ia a recipient of National and International Awards / Honour. some of which are: “Defender of the year Award” from the international league for Human Rights in 2000; The Ogoni merit award – 2002; Dr Kwame Nkrumah leadership award 2003; and Bernard Simon memorial award for the advancement of human rights- 2003;\n\nThis indefatigable human rights activist and defender of the poor upped the ante of his struggle by entering the foray of the murky waters of Nigerian Politics by contesting the 2007 governorship election in Ekiti State under the banner of the National Conscience Party (NCP) founded by the equally irrepressible senior Advocate of Nigeria, Gani Fawehinmi.\n\nIt is to promote and encourage patriotism, justice, good governance and to prove that if people are determined, change is indeed achievable. By his convictions, he has risked his life, position and freedom to stand against injustice. It is therefore because of his sacrifices and that of patriots like him that Nigeria has become a more humane place for all of us. Ladies and Gentlemen, Hallmarks of Labour Foundation is proud to present the 2011 Gani Fawehinmi life – time award to the most consistent Advocate for Human Rights and Civil Liberties in Nigeria, Mr Femi Falana.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nAward Category: HLF GANI FAWEHINMI LIFE-TIME Achievement Award to theMost Consistent Advocate for Human Rights and Civil Liberties in Nigeria\n\nJustice Bobakayode Eso was born on September 18, 1925 at Ilesa, in Osun State, Nigeria. He proceeded to Trinity College, Dublin where he graduated with a Bachelor of Law with Hons Degree in Legal Science in 1953 and a Masters in 1956.\n\nDescribed as the Father of Judicial Activism in Nigeria, Justice Kayode Eso is the greatest protagonist for an Independent Judiciary and very well known for his relentless efforts in maintaining discipline and protecting the integrity of his court.\n\nOn his retirement from the Bench, Hon. Justice Eugene Ubaezonu, JCA, described our Awardee as a strong protagonist of judicial activism and the Lord Denning of Nigeria who refuses to be tied to the apron string of bad statutes or bad decisions.\n\nAnother Supreme Court Judge, Justice Pius Aderemi tendered Justice Kayode Eso as a “permanent exhibit”. He also added and I quote “Eso’s decisions as a Judge is legendary and a delight to study”, “Full of erudite scholarship, well reasoned and replete with legal authorities, there are fine statements of law and veritable guides for all in the legal profession or concerned with law”. Justice Aderemi concluded.\n\nA fearless and Courageous Judge, some of Justice Eso’s celebrated landmark judgements speak for themselves, for example,\n\n The mystery gunman case, which is the trial of Wole Soyinka over his role in a broadcast which the government of the defunct western region of Nigeria termed offensive. Justice Eso returned a verdict of not guilty on Soyinka, and shortly after the judgement, he was transferred from Ibadan to Akure, then regarded as a rural station;\n\n The celebrated case of Chief Obafemi Awolowo Vs Alhaji Shehu Shagari, in 1979 will forever remain green in Nigeria’s jurisprudence. The Apex Court in deciding the law relating to election cases had by a majority of 6-1, affirmed the election of Alhaji Shagari as duly elected President. However, the courageous decision of Justice Eso in this case remains legendary. In his dissent opinion, Justice Eso held that at least two-third of 19 states could only be 13 and not 12 2/3\n\nHe has received several Awards and University honours too numerous to mention. He is Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON): 1979; He received LL.D honoris Causa, University of Ibadan: 1990, and University of Nigeria, Nsukka: 2001, respectively.\n\nHe is an author of several books, articles and he has delivered various papers at National and International Seminars.\n\nHe is married to Helen Aina Eso and they are blessed with 2 children and five grand children.\n\nDistinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, we present to you a distinguished Jurist, a Legal Luminary, a Great Protagonist of a free Judiciary, a fearless and Courageous fighter.

A Teacher, Administrator, Businessman and former Minister of Education and Youth Development, Professor Ben Nwabueze was born on December 22nd, 1932 in Atani, Ogbaru Local government Area of Anambra State.\n\nHis academic pursuit started at the CMS Central School Atani, from 1938 – 1945; C.M.S Central School, Onitsha (formerly, African College), 1947 – 1950. He later went to London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London, 1956 – 1961 and School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, 1961 – 1962. From 1962 – 1965, he was Senior Lecturer at Holborn College of Law, London, and Senior Lecturer, University of Nigeria Nsukka, between 1967 – 1970. In 1971, he was Dean, Faculty of Law, University of Zambia and Director, Law practice Institute, Zambia, 1973 – 1975\n\nAlthough, well supported by both father and uncle initially, the greater part of his Academic pursuits abroad were made possible by scholarship awarded to him for his academic excellence.\n\nProf. Nwabueze earned his Doctor of Laws (LL.D) at the University of London in 1978, based on his three outstanding books – Constitutionalism, Presidentialism, and Judicialism, thus entering the record books as the second (since the death of Dr. T.O. Elias), the only Nigerian and African holder of a higher doctorate degree in Law by published works.\n\nHe is also the first academic lawyer to be made a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in 1978 strictly on the basis of his published works.\n\nA seasoned Academician, he was member of Senate of the Universities of Lagos, Dar-es-salaam, Nairobi, Haile Selassie in Ethiopia, Lesotho, Botswana and Swaziland between 1971 – 1978.\n\nHe was appointed the University Assessor for Academic Appointments, Universities of Ghana, Lagos, Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) and Jos between 1978 – 1979.\n\nA firm believer in publishing, Prof. Ben Nwabueze is the proud author of over thirty books and treatises with an average extent of 400 pages. They include; The Machinery of Justice in Nigeria; Constitutional Law of the Nigerian Republic; Nigerian Land Law and Constitutionalism in the Emergent States. Others are Presidentialism in Commonwealth Africa, Judicialism in Commonwealth Africa; The Presidential Constitution of Nigeria; A Constitutional History of Nigeria; Federalism in Nigeria under the Presidential Constitution; and Nigeria’s Second Experiment in constitutional Democracy in Africa in Five Volumes.\n\nHe has written over 200 articles in academic journals and more than 100 keynotes at local and international Conferences.\n\nHe is a household name in the Legal Profession and hardly, any other author is as frequently quoted in court judgements as Ben Nwabueze. Although, well known for his teaching, research and writing; Nwabueze continued to participate in University administration.\n\nThis erudite Professor was appointed to Professorial Chairs in the following Universities; Zambia, 1970 – 75; Ahmadu Bello university, Zaria, 1974; University of Nigeria, Nsukka, 1975 – 76; Anambra State University of Technology; Nnamdi Azikiwe university, Awka 1989 – 1983 (visiting)\n\nProf. Ben Nwabueze is also a strong advocate for the Igbo cause. He, alongside other prominent Igbo sons like Akanu Ibiam, M.I. Okpara, K.O. Mbadiwe, Chief Ugochukwu, P.N. Okigbo and Udoji, co-founded Ohaneze Ndigbo in 1976. He served as Secretary – General, between 1978 to 2004, in which capacity he transformed the body into a formidable, highly regarded non-partisan Pan Igbo pressure group.\n\nThe recipient of several Chieftaincy titles, and The Nigerian Order of Merit (NNOM).\n\nProf. Ben Nwabueze is truly an academic giant in every sense of the term. Probably, more than any other Nigerian has, through his numerous books and articles contributed towards the application of constitutional law and the broader process of governance in Nigeria.\n\nIndeed, the Nigerian Constitutional Evolution and the evolution of the entire legal system of Nigeria would not be complete without the invaluable contribution of this noble Patriot. It is therefore in recognition of his immense contribution to the advancement of the Nigerian Legal System, particularly in the areas of Academics and publication that Hallmarks of Labour Foundation has called on Prof. Ben Nwabueze, a Great Nigerian to join the league of other worthy Patriots of Hallmarks of Labour Role Model recipients (HLR).\n\nCongratulations!\n\nAward Category: HLF LIFE-TIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD for Exemplary/Courageous Service to the advancement of our Legal system\n\nIn every field of human endeavour, every profession or calling, there are to be found a few men and women who dictate the pace, whose opinions, conduct and actions influence to a very large degree, the mode of practice in that particular field. These are the people who are able to combine talent with scholarship, backed up with a single minded determination to excel, invariably becoming leaders and pioneers.\n\nThus in the field of education, No other Nigerian better qualifies for the title of a teacher of teachers than our honoured guest, Professor Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa (CON) Statesman and erudite scholar who has dominated teachers’ education in Nigeria, like a colossus for almost five decades.\n\nBorn into the Onikoyi Chieftaincy family of Isale Eko, Lagos to Pa Sanusi Giwa Fafunwa and Madam Morinatu Fafunwa on Sept 23, 1923, his early beginnings were full of struggles, set – backs and successes. At a very tender age, young Aliu Fafunwa assisted his father in his trade as a fisherman and his mother, in petty trading while in Jebba, Niger state, where they had moved to, from their native Lagos, for economic reasons. Perhaps it was the memory of such happy childhood moments, that went through his mind, when he later wrote about the character forming nature of Traditional and informal African education. He had his primary education at Muslim training school Ebute – Elefun and Ahmadiyya Talimul School Elegbata Lagos, between 1932 and 1936. He proceeded to C.M.S. Grammar School, Lagos between 1937 and 1943 for his secondary education. Before leaving for Florida, United States of America in 1947, Prof. Fafunwa worked for a short while, at the Nigerian Railway Corporation. He was so dissatisfied and exasperated by the treatment of his British colonial bosses, at the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) that he was eager to further his studies and return to Nigeria to join in the task of nation building.\n\nHis time in the United States of America afforded him the opportunity of bagging three degrees, all cum laude. He was awarded his B. Sc in Social Science and English, his M.A in English Education at the New York University and his P.H.D. in Administration and Higher Education.\n\nThe Philosophy behind Prof. Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa’s life work has been, the de-emphasizing of formal, structured, examination-oriented, and Western-oriented education, for a more ‘holistic’, functional educational system that emphasizes flexibility and usefulness to the society. Prof. Fafunwa sees education as a means to an end, and not an end in itself. It was perhaps at Esso West Africa, where he worked from 1957 to 1961 as recorded by Aladejana and Alao in their book ‘Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa’, that Aliu Fafunwa was convinced that ‘paper qualification has its limits. There, he found out that most of the expatriate members of staff had little or no paper qualifications not withstanding, they had exposure and training on the job and were truly experts in their various fields’.\n\nIronically, a man with so many formal academic achievements became the arrowhead of so much change in the area of education.\n\nPerhaps Prof. Aliu Fafunwa will best be remembered for his advocacy of learning, in our ‘mother-tongue’ with English as a second language during the six years of primary education.\n\nThe use of the mother tongue, according to Fafunwa would;\n\n1. deliver the student from the shackles of colonialism.\n\n2. Allow for effective and meaningful communication between the teacher and student within and outside the classroom, and\n\n3. Promote the development of mature judgement by the pupils. Fafunwa’s belief is that ultimately Education must be relevant to 4. the needs of the society and be able to re-direct the society, if need be.\n\nHis second most important pioneering work is the introduction of primary science programme at the Primary education level in Nigeria.\n\nIncidentally, Professor Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa’s career in education began on a humble note on his return from the United States of America.\n\nHe started as a Senior tutor and later became Principal of the Ahmadiyyah College, Agege from Jan. to Dec. 1956\n\nThen he moved from education to take up employment as Public Relations Manager at Esso West Africa from 1957 to 1961,\n\nHe went back to the classroom as a Senior Lecturer and head of education and later Associate Professor and Dean of the Faculty of education, University of Nigeria Nsukka in the year 1964.\n\nBy 1965, he was Professor, Director of the Institute of Education and Head, Department of Education. And finally by 1966, he was acting Vice Chancellor of that University.\n\nFrom 1967 to 1972, he was a Senior Lecturer and later Deputy Vice Chancellor at the University of Ife.\n\nHe was appointed to the Ibadan University Council from 1972 to 1975 and was member, board of Lagos State teaching Service Commission between 1976 and 1979. Between 1985 and 1990, He was the Vice President and later President of the Nigerian Academy of Education and was appointed Honourable Federal Minister of Education and Youth Development where he served from 1990 to 1993.\n\nHe held numerous administrative and academic appointments, he was an external examiner on education to five Nigerian universities and a number of foreign universities have benefited from his wealth of experience for example, Makarere University in Uganda. University College Cape Coast Ghana, University of West Indies, Jamaica and the University of Sierra Leone.\n\nProfessor Fafunwa has also served in very crucial capacities and has been appointed to numerous organizations and commissions.\n\nHe was National President, Nigeria Experiment in International Living (1957-1980);\n\nMember, Editorial Advisory Board, Teachers College Record, Teachers College, Columbia University (1973-84);\n\nChairman of Council, Lagos State College of Education (1981-82).\n\nHe was also President, International Council on Education for Teaching (ICET) Headquarters, Arlington, Virginia, U.S.A.(1990-1994).\n\nProfessor Fafunwa is an author of international repute. He has authored about twenty-two books and has nearly fifty publications in National and International Journals, including one in Polish language titledProblemy Afrikan Instuki publishedin January 1964. Over the years, his contribution to education have attracted recognition including scholarships, awards, medals and appointments world-wide.\n\nHe won the Franklin Brook Award for outstanding contribution to Educational Development, New York, 1973;\n\nMedal for Distinguished Service in Education, Teacher’s College, Columbia University,1973;\n\nDistinguished Alumni Achievement Award, New York University School of Education,1982;\n\nDistinguished Fellow, International Council on Education for Teaching, Washington D.C., 1983.\n\nAliu Fafunwa was a powerful force behind the formation of the Nigerian Academy of Education which has today become the most credible assemblage of the who-is-who in the field of education. He also chaired what is now known as the Fafunwa “Study Group” on the funding of Primary Education. The report of the group spelt out how to stabilize education at the base (primary level); the role of each tier of government and of parents too. It was that report that led to the birth of the National Primary Education Commission by the Federal Government in 1987.\n\nApart from his contributions to education, Professor Fafunwa is a God – fearing man, his contribution to the cause of Islam dates back to over four decades. He is a sound member of the Shooting stars (1948) Islamic club as well as the Committee on Muslim Islamic Schools (COMIS) located in Iwo town, Osun State. Perhaps the best way to appreciate Fafunwa’s role is to examine his activities within Jama-al-ul- Islamiyya. Following his election into the executive Council in July 1988, Prof. Fafunwa became second Vice- President however with the passing on of the President Alhaji Oseni in 1994, a vacuum was created in the organization that only the appointment of Prof. Fafunwa could fill providing respite to a hitherto agitated Leadership in the Nigerian Muslim Community. Since he assumed office as president in 1995 a position he held until 2005, Prof. Fafunwa has injected charisma, unequalled vigour and intellectualism into the organization.\n\nProfessor Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa is a dedicated husband, father and grandfather. His wife Doris Elaine Jones who hails from North Bennington, Vermont U.S.A. has been a companion and a pillar of support for more than fifty – four years.\n\nTheir marriage is blessed with four children and several grandchildren.\n\nA role model and a trial blazer, in his private and professional life this man of letters has proved himself to be an icon to be identified with and an example to be emulated.\n\nHe is the recipient of three honorary doctorate degrees one from University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1986, another from the University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) in 1987 and the third from the Lagos State University in the year 2000.\n\nHe is a recipient of the Nigerian National Merit Award in 1989, Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON) in 2002.\n\nProfessor Aliu Babatunde Fafunwa is truly a teacher of teachers!\n\nDr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was born on June 13, 1954 in Ogwashi-uku, Delta State.
