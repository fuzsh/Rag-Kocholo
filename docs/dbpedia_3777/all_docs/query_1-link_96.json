        "text": "About IHSD\n\nThe Institute for Humanitarian Studies and Social Development endeavors to provide quality technical education in line with the requirements of today’s competitive industry and fast paced technological\n\nIt is imperative to state that in this part of the world, particularly in Nigeria, there is no institution dedicated to the training of non-profit and humanitarian services providers in the country either at the academic or professional level. For example, in the United States of America, there is the University of Connecticut where Humanitarian Services Administration is offered as a course even at the Post Graduate level. There is also the Humanitarian Resource Institute and the Humanitarian University in America; same is applicable in other advanced countries of the world, but regrettably this gap has continued to exist here in our own society prior to the birth of the Institute for Humanitarian Studies & Social Development (IHSD).\n\nOur Profile\n\nBackground Information\n\nof the Institute\n\nToday, the world faces humanitarian crisis of increasing complexities and severity and even as we anticipate our vulnerability to global events, the need for expertise and research dedicated to finding solutions to humanitarian challenges has never been more pertinent.\n\nTherefore, training institutions represent a large resource that can and should be harnessed to support humanitarian endeavors.\n\nHowever, the absence of a training and professional institution dedicated to the promotion of humanitarian services and quality capacity building on various developmental programs underpins a significant gap in our understanding of the sector as a whole which is one major factor militating against social development in Africa, particularly in Nigeria. We are talking about a sector where consistency cum ethical standard and international humanitarian best practices are almost non-existent; where several Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) have attempted to address their learning and capacity building needs based on their own interpretation and identified needs.\n\nfactor is responsible for poor programmatic cum managerial competence amongst Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) which has contributed to inadequate funding, poor project out-put, poor coordination and inadequate information sharing strategies regarding various activities in the non-profit sector; as highlighted in a foreword contained in the ‘Directory of NGOs/CSOs, 2002’ and written by “Dr. Christian Voumard, UNICEF-Nigeria Country Representative”.\n\nSome our people travel from here to Galilee Collage or the NGO Management School in Switzerland just to do a short course on NGO Management and related areas. Similarly, in Ghana there is the Civil Society Institute supported by Open Society Initiative for West Africa among other partners; they have been engaged in providing free and competitive training for people in West African Countries on Community Work and NGO Management related program. The above justifies the reason why the Institute was established to address the capacity needs of humanitarian and non-profit services providers in Nigeria as identified by the UNICEF boss.\n\nTraining and empowerment\n\nWhat We Do.\n\nThrough impactful training, we contribute to sustainable Social Development through manpower development and institutional capacity building in the social and non-profit sector.\n\nFOUNDED IN 2010\n\nWe have become one of the best humanitarian & capacity building services providers. Our team has decades of experience working specifically with competent experts as trainers, researchers and programmers.\n\nParticipants\n\nIndividuals Trained\n\nTraining batches\n\nNGOS & ORGANIZATIONS\n\nour identity\n\nOur Passion\n\nVision\n\nTo contribute to sustainable Social Development through manpower development and institutional capacity building in the social and non-profit sector.\n\nWe have worked very closely and enjoyed the support of the United Nations Institute for Training & Research, Nigeria office headed by Dr. Larry Boms. We equally partner the Hope for Children-CRC policy Center in Cyprus including the National Boundary Commission and Link International, owners of the Advance Community Education Service in Canada, while the Border Communities Development Agency in 2017 joined the National Boundary Commission to partner us in the area of Training.\n\nIt is important to re-emphasize the role played by the Abia State University in swiftly welcoming this noble initiative when it was newly formed in 2009, during the administration of Professor Mkpa Agu Mkpa as the Vice Chancellor of that University. The University management saw the initiative as a strategic innovative one that should be supported, hence, the University mobilized resources in order to add credence to the programs of the Institute especially by helping to revamp its proposed training materials and curriculum so as to meet international standard.\n\nFinally, we will not forget in a hurry the roles and contributions of the Federal Ministry of Education in ensuring that speedy approval was given during the registration of the Institute then. Even, to the extent that the former Ministers of this honourable Ministry (Prof. Rukayat Rufai and Barr. Kennet O. Gbagi) hosted us for a meeting and even went ahead to support us in developing a bill and sending to the Federal Ministry of Justice in order to have the Institute Chattered, though somewhere along the line we did not continue with that process. But, we must thank the Federal Ministry of Education for all the support enjoyed so far.\n\nWe have developed another very encompassing curriculum to start a National Innovative Diploma in Humanitarian Services and Social Development Studies once all conditions given by the National Board for Technical Education with the Support of the Tertiary Education Department of the Federal Ministry of Education.\n\nWho we are\n\nThe Institute for Humanitarian Studies and Social Development was established to complement the efforts of the Government and the United Nations by promoting professionalism, intellectualism, values and integrity in the humanitarian and Non-Profit sector in Nigeria.\n\nThe Institute was officially inaugurated on August 12th 2010 at Sheraton Hotel and Towers, Ikeja, Lagos where the certificate of registration was presented by Chief EmekaAnyaoku, Former Common Wealth Secretary General and Member of the Presidential Advisory Council who represented the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The occasion was also graced by the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), United Nations Fund for Population Activity (UNFPA) and other stakeholders\n\nMission Statement\n\nOur mission is to employ knowledge driven teaching, research and practical works to produce highly qualitative graduates as social development practitioners; social networkers; instructors and administrations of social and non-profit services.\n\nCore Values\n\nTo bring professionalism, efficiency, integrity, credibility and value to non-profit and social services.\n\nCapacity Statement\n\nThe Institute works with intellectually competent experts as trainers, researchers and programmers drawn from among members and volunteers and as well as associates staff from various recognized higher institutions and development sector.
