        "text": "The entire Victoria Island in Lagos Nigeria came to a halt on Friday October 13, 2017. On this day, the imposing Oriental Hotel was literarily shut down. It was indeed a day to remember. The day signified the icon which Unilag, the university of first choice and the nation’s pride, has become. It was the day the Alumni from far and wide had set aside to celebrate the university that made them. True, Unilag is not the first university in Nigeria. But through consistent high academic performance, it has grown to become, and by far, Nigeria’s numero uno. To celebrate this landmark attainment, the Otuba Seni Adetu led committee pull off “One in Town” show.\n\nAnd the night produced two outcomes. It was a great night for the Old boys and Girls of Unilag who converged to celebrate their Alma Mater. For the management of Orienta Hotel, it was a strange night. This night, food finished. Drinks finished. Yet, requests never stopped.\n\nThe University of Lagos Alumni Association came into existence in 1969, four years after the first 41 graduates were turned out and seven years after the establishment of Unilag. Since then, it has had 13 national presidents beginning from Mr. Kayode Anjorin and include names such as Chief Michael Olawale-Cole, late Chief Rufus Giwa, late Chief L.E.A Aimiuwu (The Osayuwanoba of Benin Kingdom), Professor Olaide Abass and of course, the Olor’ogun (Olori Ogun) of Ijebu, Dr. Sonny Kuku.\n\nThe hotel must have underrated Unilag and its Alumni. No doubt, the gathering of Unilag Big Boys and Girls shut down the entire Lagos. As the university that produced the current Vice President and several serving governors, you expect that it would be a great night. And it was! Professor Yemi Osinbajo was there with smile and pride. The Vice Chancellor, Professor Rahamon Bello was there. The Pro Chancellor, Dr Wale Babalakin was there. The President General of Unilag Alumni Association, Olor’ogun Sonny Kuku delivered a great speech. It was the night the Creme de la Creme of Nigeria’s society gathered for their university. Check the roll call of the Special Guests of Honour: Governors Udom Emmanuel, Willie Obiano, Ibrahim Dankwambo, former Gov. Gbenga Daniel, the Deputy Govs. Sir Ude Oko Chukwu and Otunba Titi Laoye-Tomori of Abia and Osun States respectively, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, wife of Ogun State Gov. Olufunsho Amosu and last but not the least,The Great Baba Ijebu, Sir Kesington Adebutu.\n\nEight prominent persons were honoured with the Distinguished Alumni Awards. They are: Dr. Wale Babalakin, Dr. John Abebe (Medicine, 1970–1975), Mr Mustafa Chike-Obi, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila (Law, 1980–1983), Senator Victor Ndoma Egba (Law, 1977), Mr. Godwin Obla (Law, ULSU Sec. Gen. 1981), Mrs. Winifred Ekanem Oyo-Ita (Accounting, 1984) and Mr. Mutiu Sunmonu (Mathematics and Computer Science, 1978). Professor Rahamon Bello received the Honorary Distinguished Alumnus Award. Akoka Axis, Engineering Alumni Set of 1969–1972 and Law Class of 1980–1983 received Sectoral Distinguished Alumni Award. Dr. D.K Olukoya received Special Recognition Award while Mr. Seun Badejo was honoured with Long Service Award.\n\nIf not for my doggedness, I would have missed the show due to Lagos traffic. My friend John Sonayon Oni insisted that he must follow me. I waited for him till 7pm before we left home. We got to the venue same time with the Vice President. But we did not miss anything as the programme wouldn’t have started without him. As usual, Mass Comm Department of the university was ably represented. Mr. John Momoh, Chairman of Channels TV, was there. Mr Lekan Sote, the Punch Columnist, was there. Mr Bola Saliu was there. John was there and so was I.\n\nEntering the venue was wow! The decoration was super. The drinks, particularly, the water, were nice. John settled for Red Wine. I was dragged to the Ijoko awon boys where Dr. Oloo (Oloyede Adeola), Olu People and Oluwo Ibikunle were sitted. John Sonayon Oni played a fast one on me. He deleted a picture of himself where he was carrying an empty plate about looking for food from my camera. I asked him why? He said Okewole Babatunde Josiah would kill him if he sees it.\n\nWell, for those who did not attend, you missed. But not to worry. Since Unilag will remain forever, there would be plenty of October 13 2017 night and you will have the chance to attend. A special appreciation goes to the committee that put a great show for the world to see. A locomotive applause (apology to Prof. Ralph Akinfeleye) for the committee members:\n\nOtunba Seni Adetu — Chairman\n\nBarr. Tunde Fadahunsi\n\nDr. Fassy Yusuf\n\nMr. Kola Kalejaiye\n\nDr. Aaron Akinloye\n\nHon. Gbenga Abdulai\n\nDr. Abdul Gbadamosi\n\nMr. Tajudeen Adeshina\n\nMr. Francis Shonubi (Manicongo)\n\nMr. Ladi Lawanson\n\nDr. Lukmon Adeoti\n\nMs. Florence Okeke\n\nDr. Ajibayo Adeyeye\n\nDr. U.A.C. Okafor\n\nMr. Lekan Sote\n\nProf. A.A. Osinubi\n\nProf. Virgy Onyene\n\nMr. Tajudeen Adebanjo\n\nUnilag appreciates you. The entire Unilag Alumni appreciate you.\n\nThree Gbosas for you: Gbosa! Gbosa!! Gbosa!!!"
