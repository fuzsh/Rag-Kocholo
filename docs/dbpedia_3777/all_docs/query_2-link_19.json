Below are annotated pointers to remaining still-available online resources (plus journal-published materials) that visitors might find useful for their work or of historical interest.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the mid-1990s the U.S. electric power industry has undergone substantial changes in both its structure (ownership and technology aspects) and its architecture (operational and oversight aspects). The industry has shifted away from highly regulated markets with administered cost-based pricing and towards competitive markets in which prices more fully reflect supply and demand forces.\n\nThe intended purpose of these changes has been to give U.S. electric power industry participants more incentive to control costs and to engage in innovative product development. These efforts have resulted in the formation of seven grid-supported wholesale electric power markets, centrally-managed by Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs).\n\nThe primary goal of this resource site, since its launch in 1999, has been to encourage researchers to tackle the restructuring of the U.S. electric power industry from a multi-disciplinary perspective that considers both economic and engineering concerns.\n\nThe U.S. electric power industry is now facing a major new challenge that dramatically increases the need for this multi-disciplinary perspective. In response to both private economic incentives and public policy initiatives, the industry is transitioning from its traditional heavy reliance on fossil-fuel based power to an increased reliance on renewable power -- e.g., wind and photovoltaic (PV) solar power.\n\nThis transition is resulting in more uncertain and volatile grid net load, i.e., customer power withdrawals and inadvertent power losses minus non-dispatched power injections by renewable power facilities not fully firmed by storage. In consequence, it is becoming harder for central managers to ensure the advance availability of dispatchable power resources with sufficient flexibility in their power-production capabilities to permit the continual real-time balancing of grid net load by means of centrally-dispatched power injections, a basic requirement for reliable grid operation.\n\nThis major new challenge is explained and analyzed with care in the following linked materials:\n\nThe Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) Project: ISU Homepage\n\nLeigh Tesfatsion (2023), \"Locational Marginal Pricing: When and Why Not?\" (WP,pdf), Economics Working Paper No. 23003 (13pp), ISU Digital Repository, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa.\n\nLeigh Tesfatsion (2023), \"Economics of Grid-Supported Electric Power Markets: A Fundamental Reconsideration\" (WP,pdf), (HandOutKeyPoints,pdf), (SlideSetShort,pdf), (YouTube FERC talk, 6/28/2023, Day 2, 7:34:00)\n\nResearch on possible resolutions to this major new challenge is now so extensive that no one resource site can do justice to the literature. However, it is hoped that the annotated linked/cited resources provided below will be of some use to those who wish to understand the motivation, ideas, and initiatives that have led the U.S. electric power industry to its current form and that continue to drive efforts for its further change.\n\nOnline Resource Sites\n\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes Annual Energy Outlook Reports that present projections and analysis of US energy supply, demand, and prices using an approximately twenty year planning horizon.\n\nThe International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE), founded in 1977, provides a forum for the exchange of ideas, experience, and issues among professionals interested in energy economics. As part of its varied activities, the IAEE sponsors the publication of The Energy Journal.\n\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA) provides a wide variety of links to news items, journal articles, and other types of publications focusing on the current state of energy resources worldwide.\n\nThe IEA also annually releases influential World Energy Outlook Reports. Each report presents up-to-date international energy projections for the next several decades, together with insights into what these projections imply for energy security, climate change, economic development, and universal access to modern energy services.\n\nResources for the Future (RFF) provides pointers to a wide variety of research articles and working papers on electricity restructuring by RFF researchers. Issues addressed include environmental protection, stranded costs, demand-side management, externality estimates, and political economy aspects.\n\nHistorical Background Materials\n\nEE/Econ 458 (Iowa State University), an introductory course on Economic Systems for Electric Power Planning, last team-taught by Leigh Tesfatsion (with Jim McCalley) in 2011.

Significant progress has been made on the wholesale competition front but major challenges must still be confronted.

(WP,pdf,162KB), (SlideSet,pdf,116KB).\n\nAbstract: This study reports experimental market power and efficiency outcomes for a computational wholesale electricity market operating in the short run under systematically varied concentration and capacity conditions. The pricing of electricity is determined by means of a clearinghouse double auction with discriminatory midpoint pricing. Buyers and sellers use a modified Roth-Erev individual reinforcement learning algorithm to determine their price and quantity offers in each auction round. It is shown that high market efficiency is generally attained, and that market microstructure is strongly predictive for the relative market power of buyers and sellers independently of the values set for the reinforcement learning parameters. Results are briefly compared against results from an earlier electricity study in which buyers and sellers instead engage in social mimicry learning via genetic algorithms.\n\nShmuel Oren, Pablo Spiller, Pravin Varaiya, and Felix Wu, \"Nodal Prices and Transmission Rights: A Critical Appraisal\" (pdf,3.6MB), The Electricity Journal, Vol. 8, No. 3, 1995, 24-35.\n\nAbstract: The authors argue that the pricing of transmission services and the compensation of transmission owners on the basis of nodal price differences will not produce the right incentives for transmission assets or rights in a decentralized ownership network. They assert that new methods to deal with transmission ownership compensation and expansion are needed if the move towards a competitive wholesale electricity market is not to be bogged down in a regulatory quagmire.\n\nStephen J.

Although the current literature hold more negative views about FTRs, this paper presents a simple illustrative 2-stage model to study the competitive behaviors of electricity generators and load serving entities (LSEs) and analyzes the welfare effects of FTRs in the restructuring U.S. wholesale power market framework. The analysis focuses on a competitive two-node electricity network model where there is one generator and one LSE in each node with linear marginal cost and demand function, supervised by an independent system operator (ISO). In the first-stage of modeling, a no-rights benchmark model is developed to solve for the optimal quantity of power production and consumption and derive the locational marginal price for each node, which serve as the building blocks to solve for the optimal FTR hedge positions in the second-stage model. Once a stochastic parameter shock is introduced, the second-stage model shows that the acquisition of optimal FTRs by the risk averse generators and LSEs increases and in general strictly increases the social welfare compared with the case where there is no FTRs available. This result provides a counterexample to the somewhat negative views about FTRs held by other economists in the literature and provides some economic explanations to the fact that FTRs are widely adopted as a financial hedge instrument in the major U.S. wholesale power markets.\n\nJunjie Sun and Leigh Tesfatsion, \"An Agent-Based Computational Laboratory for Wholesale Power Market Design\" (pdf,724KB), Proceedings, IEEE Power Engineering Systems General Meeting, Tampa, Florida, June 2007 (electronic).\n\nAbstract:This proceedings paper is an abridged version of ISU Economics Working Paper No. 06025 (below).

Versions of the WPMP have been implemented in New England, New York, the mid-Atlantic states, the Midwest, and the Southwest, and adopted for implementation in California. Strong opposition to the WPMP persists among some industry stakeholders, however, due largely to a perceived lack of adequate performance testing. This study reports on the model development and open-source implementation (in Java) of a computational wholesale power market organized in accordance with core WPMP features and operating over a realistically rendered transmission grid subject to congestion effects. The traders within this market model are strategic profit-seeking agents whose learning behaviors are based on data from human-subject experiments. Our key experimental focus is the complex interplay among structural conditions, market protocols, and learning behaviors in relation to short-term and longer-term market performance. Findings for a dynamic 5-node transmission grid test case are presented for concrete illustration.\n\nJunjie Sun and Leigh Tesfatsion, \"Open-Source Software for Power Industry Research, Teaching, and Training: A DC-OPF Illustration\" (pdf,115KB), Proceedings, IEEE Power Engineering Systems General Meeting, Tampa, Florida, June 2007 (electronic).\n\nAbstract: This proceedings paper is an abridged version of ISU Economics Working Paper No. 06014 (below). It reports on the development and implementation of a stand-alone open-source Java solver for DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problems suitable for research, teaching, and training purposes. The DC-OPF solver is shown to match or exceed the accuracy of BPMPD (a proprietary third-party QP solver highly recommended by MatPower) when tested on a public repository of small to medium-sized QP problems. The capabilities of the DC-OPF solver are illustrated for a 5-node DC-OPF test case commonly used for training purposes.\n\nJunjie Sun and Leigh Tesfatsion, DC Optimal Power Flow Formulation and Testing Using QuadProgJ (pdf,519KB), ISU Economics Working Paper No. 06014, Department of Economics, Iowa State University, Revised June 2006.\n\nAbstract: Nonlinear AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems are commonly approximated by linearized DC OPF problems to obtain real power solutions for restructured wholesale power markets. We first present a standard DC OPF problem, which has the numerically desirable form of a strictly convex quadratic programming (SCQP) problem when voltage angles are eliminated by substitution. We next augment this standard DC OPF problem in a physically meaningful way, still retaining an SCQP form, so that solution values for voltage angles and locational marginal prices are directly obtained along with real power injections and branch flows. We then show how this augmented DC OPF problem can be solved using QuadProgJ, an open-source Java SCQP solver newly developed by the authors that implements the well-known dual active-set SCQP algorithm by Goldfarb and Idnani (1983). To demonstrate the accuracy of QuadProgJ, comparative results are reported for a well-known suite of numerical QP test cases with up to 1500 decision variables plus constraints. Detailed QuadProgJ results are also reported for 3-node and 5-node DC OPF test cases taken from power systems texts and ISO-NE/MISO/PJM training manuals.\n\nGerald L.

After briefly reviewing definitions, strategies and methods of mitigating market power we examine the various methods of detecting market power that have been employed by academics and market monitors/regulators. These techniques include structural and behavioral indices and analysis as well as various simulation approaches. The applications of these tools range from spot market mitigation and congestion management through to long-term market design assessment and merger decisions. Various market-power monitoring units already track market behavior and produce indices. Our survey shows that these units collect a large amount of data from various market participants and we identify the crucial role of the transmission system operators with their access to dispatch and system information. Easily accessible and comprehensive data supports effective market power monitoring and facilitates market design evaluation. The discretion required for effective market monitoring is facilitated by institutional independence.\n\nJürgen Weiss, \"Market Power Issues in the Restructuring of the Electricity Industry: An Experimental Investigation\", Harvard Business School, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 1997.

More realistic modeling of the technological aspects of the industry reveals important additional incentives to exercise market power that are not seen in the simpler modelings underlying previous electricity industry studies.\n\nSteven Widergren, Junjie Sun, and Leigh Tesfatsion, Market Design Test Environments (Preprint,pdf,136KB), Proceedings, IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting, Montreal, June 2006 (electronic).

At the bulk electricity level, several organizations charged with regional system operation are implementing versions of a Wholesale Power Market Platform (WPMP) in response to U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission initiatives. Recently the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and several regional initiatives have been pressing the integration of demand response as a resource for system operations. These policy and regulatory pressures are driving the exploration of new market designs at the wholesale and retail levels. The complex interplay among structural conditions, market protocols, and learning behaviors in relation to short-term and longer-term market performance demand a flexible computational environment where designs can be tested and sensitivities to power system and market rule changes can be explored. This paper discusses the use of agent-based computational methods for the study of electricity markets at the wholesale and retail levels, and explores distinctions in problem formulation between these levels.\n\nAllen J.

Economic decisions are carried out by private multilateral trades among generators and consumers. The function of reliability is coordinated through the power system operator who provides publicly accessible data based upon which generators and consumers can determine profitable trades that meet the secure transmission loading limits.\n\nFelix Wu, Pravin Varaiya, Pablo Spiller, and Schmuel Oren, \"Folk Theorems on Transmission Access: Proofs and Counterexamples\" (pdf,2.9MB), Journal of Regulatory Economics Vol. 10, (1996), pp. 5-23.\n\nAbstract: Various proposals to restructure electric power transmission systems for an open and competitive market rely on concepts such as nodal prices, congestion revenues, transmission rights, etc. Implicit assertions are made concerning the regulation of transmission access, properties of economic dispatch, and the operation of competitive power markets. In this paper the authors formulate these \"folk theorems\" as explicit mathematical assertions, prove the ones that are true, and present counterexamples to those that are not. In particular, the authors argue that William Hogan's concept of a contract network - a centerpiece of his recent proposal for establishing a Poolco in the operation of a restructured electric utility that is based on nodal pricing and transmission capacity rights - is not compatible with the promotion of economic efficiency.\n\nFredrik Ygge, Market-Oriented Programming and its Application to Power Load Management, Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Science, Lund University, 1998.\n\nThis entire thesis, plus additional work by Ygge (EnerSearch AG, Gothenburg, Sweden) on applying the market-oriented programming approach of Michael Wellman (see below) to power load management issues, can be accessed at Ygge's website.

This study reviews the theory and practice of auction design as it relates specifically to U.S. restructured wholesale power markets, i.e., centrally-administered wholesale power markets with congestion managed by locational marginal prices. Basic auction concepts such as reservation value, net seller surplus, net buyer surplus, competitive market clearing, market efficiency, market pricing rules, supply offers, demand bids, strategic capacity withholding, and market power are explained and illustrated. Complicating factors specific to wholesale power markets are clarified, and recent advances in computational tools designed to address these complications are briefly noted.\n\nG. Thompson and S.

AMES models strategic traders with learning capabilities interacting within an ISO-managed wholesale power market operating over an AC transmission grid subject to congestion effects. Congestion on the grid is managed by means of locational marginal prices derived from bid/offer-based optimal power flow solutions. AMES is a free open-source tool suitable for research, teaching, and training applications. A graphical user interface permits the creation, modification, analysis and storage of scenarios, parameter initialization and editing, specification of behavioral rules (e.g. learning methods) for market participants, and output reports through table and chart displays. AMES is an acronym for Agent-based Modeling of Electricity Systems.\n\nOpen-Source Software for Electricity Market Research, Teaching, and Training\n\nAbstract: Many commercially available packages for power system analysis now incorporate components critical for the simulation of restructured electricity markets (e.g. optimal power flow solvers). However, lack of open-source access prevents users from gaining a complete and accurate understanding of what has been implemented, restricts the ability of users to experiment with new software features, and hinders users from tailoring software to specific needs. In addition, these packages can be cumbersome to use for research, teaching, and training purposes requiring intensive experimentation and sensitivity analyses. The goal of this resource site is to encourage the study of restructured electricity markets from a perspective that adequately addresses both economic and engineering concerns. Annotated pointers are provided to free open-source software facilitating the modeling of electricity markets as commercial networks of strategically interacting traders and regulatory agencies learning to operate through time over realistically rendered transmission grids. Suggestions regarding additional pertinent links for this resource site are most welcome.\n\nExamples of proprietary software incorporating both an electricity market simulation component and real-time dispatch with OPF calculations include: EMCAS (Argonne); Gridview (ABB); LMPSIM (Shaw PTI); MAPS (General Electric); Marketecture (Los Alamos National Laboratory); PROMOD IV (NewEnergyAssociates, a Siemens Company); PROSYM (Henwood); SEPIA (EPRI); and UPLAN (LCG). Examples of proprietary software incorporating real-time dispatch with OPF calculations but no electricity market simulation component include: TRACE (EPRI); SCOPE (Nexant/PCA); Simulator (PowerWorld); PSSE/E (PTI); and IPSA/LMP (UMIST). DOE/EIA's National Energy modeling System (NEMS) incorporates an Electricity Market Module (EMMB) but assumes unconstrained dispatch (no transmission costs).\n\nDisclaimer: This information was collected in September 2004.
