Most of his time there was spent figuring out how to make something unprecedented happen, with a full-fat, high-caffeine, all-in, nothing held back style.\n\nHe loves diving in, getting to the heart of the matter, trying things and getting as many people involved as possible. Collaboration is absolutely vital to Ije. This approach helps to find multiple solutions: some surprising, others wonderfully straightforward. This is done at a fizzing, energetic tempo but with one eye always on exactly what we’re trying to do, so he can keep the focus on the all-important objective at hand. As well as paying attention to people and figuring out how to help them achieve the things they want, he keeps a hands-on approach to design, which has shone through with clients such as Mercedes, Skype, EE and Expedia.\n\nJOHN MOMOH (VICE CHAIRMAN)\n\nJohn Momoh is a renowned broadcast journalist with vast industry experience spanning over three and half decades.
