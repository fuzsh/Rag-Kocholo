        "text": "By Adedapo Adesanya\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the appointment of Mr John Momoh as the Interim Chairman of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Governing Council following the recent tussle of power that ensued in the institution.\n\nMr John Momoh is the President of UNILAG Alumni Association Worldwide.\n\nIn his new role, Mr Momoh is expected to coordinate the affairs of the institution, as a representative of the federal government and his first task will be to ratify the election of the new Acting Vice-Chancellor, Mrs Folashade Ogunsola.\n\nThe Senate of the University of Lagos had named Mrs Folasade Ogunsola as Acting Vice-Chancellor of the institution.\n\nShe was chosen at the Senate meeting following an election, which was held between her and Prof Ben Oghojafor.\n\nThe meeting was attended by about 167 professors, who voted for either of the two candidates. After polling 135 votes (80.8 per cent), she broke UNILAG’s 58-year record to become the first female to be appointed as an acting VC of the institution since it was founded in 1962.\n\nReacting to the appointment of Mrs Ogunsola, a professor, as acting Vice-Chancellor, UNILAG ASUU President, Mr Dele Ashiru commended the federal government’s intervention.\n\nMr Ashiru appealed to the university community to support the new acting Vice-Chancellor in the discharge of her duties.\n\nRecall that President Buhari had last week asked the embattled and sacked Vice-Chancellor of UNILAG, Mr Toyin Ogundipe, to step aside. The Pro-Chancellor of the institution, Mr Wale Babalakin, was also asked to recuse himself from official duties."
