3. 2 Introduction India is currently the world’s second-largest telecommunications market with a subscriber base of 1.17 billion and has registered strong growth in the past decade and half. The Indian mobile economy is growing rapidly and will contribute substantially to India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), according to report prepared by GSM Association (GSMA) in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). App downloads in the country grew approximately 215 per cent between 2015 and 2017. The liberal and reformist policies of the Government of India have been instrumental along with strong consumer demand in the rapid growth in the Indian telecom sector. The government has enabled easy market access to telecom equipment and a fair and proactive regulatory framework that has ensured availability of telecom services to consumer at affordable prices. The deregulation of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) norms has made the sector one of the fastest growing and a top five employment opportunity generator in the country. Definitions: The telecommunications sector is made up of companies that make communication possible on a global scale, whether it is through the phone or the Internet, through airwaves or cables, through wires or wirelessly. These companies created the infrastructure that allows data in words, voice, audio or video to be sent anywhere in the world. ADVANTAGE INDIA Robust Demand India ranks second in terms of number of telecommunication subscriptions, internet subscribers and app downloads globally. Moreover, India is also one of the largest data consumers globally. Total mobile data usage in the country grew 144 per cent year-on-year to 2,360 PB per month in December 2017. Attractive Opportunity The government of India has introduced Digital India programme under which all the sectors such as healthcare, retail, etc. will be connected through internet. Also, with 70 per cent of the population staying in rural areas and a rapidly increasing rural telecom penetration, the rural market would be a key growth driver in the coming years.

4. 3 Policy Support The government has been proactive in its efforts to transform India into a global telecommunication hub. The Government of India unveiled the National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 in September 2018. The policy aims to attract US$ 100 billion worth of investments and generate 4 million jobs in the sector by 2022. As of January 2019, expenditure on telecom infrastructure and services by Government of India grew six fold to Rs. 60,000 crore (US$ 8.31 billion) between 2014-19. Increasing Rating Telecommunication ratings in the country are expected to start rising within the next two quarters (Q3 and Q4 2018-19), providing higher pricing power to incumbent players. Market Review With 512.26 million internet subscribers, as of June 2018, India ranks as the world’s second largest market in terms of total internet users. Further, India is also the world’s second largest telecommunications market with 1,191.40 million subscribers, as of September 2018. Moreover, in 2017, India surpassed USA to become the second largest market in terms of number of app downloads. Over the next five years, rise in mobile-phone penetration and decline in data costs will add 500 million new internet users in India, creating opportunities for new businesses.
