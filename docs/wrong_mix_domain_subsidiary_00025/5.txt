2. Personal Reflection On Officership Personal Reflection Who were you before entering as a Cadet in CFOT? I am a mother of a thirty year old daughter, was a wife, registrar and ambulance coder, administration assistant, medical biller/coder. Also, I was also the Sunday school teacher and Sunbeam troop leader in my home Corps. The journey to Officership was long and a disobedient one, I was called at the age of eighteen, but I did not want that kind of responsibilities. Growing up in the Salvation Army, I did not see anything positive being a Salvation Army officer due to the fact they wear many hats. It was not a glamorous career to choose, it a calling and you have to be willing and obedient. So I stay clear from the word Officership until I met an officer and his family that would change my life. My goals of becoming a singer took a back burner after becoming tangled with this family. The Lord also blinded me while I was driving to work, and take there without being in an accident. However, this was the push that gives me the motivation to say yes to Officership after twenty three years of disobedience. He showed me he could lead me blindly if I would just go and trust him. How did you change/grow in CFOT? College for Officer Training was not overwhelming for me because I was prepared to welcome all the challenges ahead of me. My heart and soul were into what lies ahead of me, I change and grow when I started trusting the Lord more. More so, I learn to be humble and to have patience with everything that comes my way. The things struck me most during the two years at College for Officer Training was, that individuals who supposed to be Christian and in training to become leaders lack integrity. I ask myself this question how could this be, and how are they going to lead people to Christ as an Officer and Pastor. This learning experience bothers me for a while, but I gave it to God in prayer and focused on why I was at CFOT. What are you learning now as you are in the field as a Salvation Army Officer? Working in the field as an officer is entirely different from what I was taught in Training College. More so, my appointment came without any type direction or someone there to help me transition. More so, I had to figure out ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...

3. The Management Of Chicago Bank Contents Abstract 2 Introduction 3 Proposal 4 Loan 4 Amortization 5 Balloon Payment 5 Loan to Value 6 Abstract Consortium Bank A subsidiary bank created by numerous banks. A consortium bank is created to fund a specific project (such as providing affordable homeownership for low and moderate income home buyers) or to execute a specific deal (such as selling loans in the loan syndication market) . (Investopedia, 2009) The Consortium generally strengthens the individual bank s assets to meet their objectives.

All these banks came together so as to invest in the Real Estate Sector that too in the East Lansing area. The main focus of our Consortium is to finance inner city and mixed used projects. Inner City Projects are basically for the redevelopment of the city so as to improve the urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, enhanced community capacity and improvements in public safety. (Jackson, 2015) Mixed Used Projects are any urban, suburban or village development, or even a single building, that blends a combination of residential, commercial, cultural, institutional, or industrial uses, where those functions are physically and functionally integrated, and that provides pedestrian connections. (Jackson, 2015) So basically we are interested in investing in any such project that is in the well fare of the city of East Lansing as well as its residents. It can be a hospital, a residential complex, a commercial office building, a school or any such project that enhances the real estate market of the city and should be for the wellness of the residents of the city. In this report further I am going to discuss about the Loan policies of the consortium for the Real Estate Developers. Why is a Consortium needed? A syndicate bank is formed by multiple banks, for a particular purpose of financing a specific project that is too big for an individual bank to finance on its own. Under this procedure the

The circulation is quite substantial for the city, but doesn t spread any further within that paper. It is one of the first tabloids within the area to have grown popularity, and in the chosen article suggests a more conservative lean, having a strong impact on the language used within the pages of the newspaper. It seems to be more likely to be focused on appealing for the middle class. In this article especially, there is the use of strong homophobic language, and refusal to correctly gender those taking part in the riot, including referring to the patrons of the bar as little girls (ref4).

7. Still Alice Analysis I decided to do my review on the movie Still Alice. The movie started off with Alice giving a speech in an auditorium to hundreds of people when all of a sudden she forgot part of her speech. At first, she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer s at the age of 50. But later on, things start to get worse, she began to forget things more and more; she was officially diagnosed from a doctor with dementia later on. The movie itself was very saddening and showed how Alzheimer s can affect one s family, friends, and everyday life traumatically. From the aspect of the caregiver, the symptoms of dementia are disheartening. Dementia itself is a progressive decline in memory, learning, and thinking abilities. In terms of education, people with Alzheimer s have the intelligence of people who are about 10 years old in grade school. For the sociological aspect of ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Some people view Alzheimer s patients in a negative way and don t treat of them as a normal thinking person. Many people believe people with this disease are confused. Some research indicated that traits like fun and happy were at the bottom of how someone would describe a person with dementia. In the movie, not everyone viewed people with dementia with respect, mostly loved ones gave the most respect to Alice throughout the movie. I think that the title of the movie Still Alice brings up a good point. When someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer s, how much of their identity do they still have left? It is disheartening to think about because this genetic disease affects so many families around the world. In spirit, Alice is still there throughout the movie. But her memory and social skills have slowly dismantled who she truly is as a person. Dementia takes over someone s life so rapidly it is frightening.

9. From Sandwich Shop to Subway Subway Report Subway was founded in 1965 by Fred DeLuca and Peter Buck. The duo opened their first sandwich shop when DeLuca was only seventeen years old. DeLuca s childhood dream was to become a prominent doctor. Therefore, he needed to find a way to pay for his medical career. On the other hand, Peter Buck was a family friend who offered DeLuca the possibility to become business partners. Their first store was opened in Bridgeport, Connecticut. It was called, Pete s Super Submarines. They sold over three hundred sandwiches on the opening day. The price range for each sandwich was between forty nine to sixty nine cents. Although they struggled for couple of years they were optimistic. Their goal at that time was to open over thirty stores in the next ten years. The pair wanted to create a success image. Later, Fred learned that good customer service, quality food and low prices were important to stay in business for a long time. In 1968, the little submarine shop changed their name to the trademark Subway. They made seven thousand dollars only on that year. However, the duo was too ambitious to settle with that. It was in 1974, and after sixteen stores in Wallingford, Connecticut that Subway grew into a franchise. In this way, becoming the first franchise in the United States. The mindset of DeLuca and Buck was to allow the now chain brand, to expand countrywide. But at this point they fell half way short on their original goal ten years ago. This ...

10. The Maternal Mortality Rate Of Afghanistan Essay Goal 5 The fifth goal is to increase maternal health in countries with a focus on reducing the maternal mortality rate by three fourths and universal access to reproductive health both by 2015. Despite a 43% reduction in maternal deaths since 1990, there are still a large number of women who die during childbirth from preventable causes such as hemorrhaging (United Nations, 2015, p. 38). In 2002 Afghanistan reported a baseline figure of 1,600 deaths per 100,000 with a 2015 targeted reduction to 315 (Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, 2013, p. 53). While Afghanistan was able to reach the original goal it had set for itself, new goals were created to combat the continuous high number of maternal deaths. Afghanistan has identified general lack of family planning, a limited supply of qualified midwives, and limited access to health care in general as contributing factors towards such high maternal death rates. The state has been working with UNICEF, WHO, and other international partners to implement its National Reproductive health strategy to help combat the conditions in which Afghanistan mothers find themselves. Goal 6 The sixth goal is to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, focusing on reversing their spread and providing universal access to treatment. We have seen progress made in most countries towards achieving this goal, with the statistics falling every day, however, we are far from the finish line as a little over 2 million people still contract AIDS/HIV.

11. The Economic Implications Of The Civilization Of India One of these complications was their Economic instability. Following the partition, the first consequence, was the uneven distribution of area and population. India was burdened with with 82% of the population and only procured 77% of the total area. The remaining 18% of population along with 23% of the total area went over to Pakistan. However, it is only when we look at the way in which the agricultural resources were distributed, that the real loss that India experiences become evident. Respective of the partition, 84% of the diffused area was handed to India, while the remaining 16% went to Pakistan. Although Pakistan got slightly less than what its population would demand, they more than made up for it, through the benefit of irrigation facilities. Out of the 70 million acres of irrigated land in the undivided country, 67% (48 million) went to India and 33% (22 million) went to Pakistan. Ergo, 45.2% of the total area Pakistan dominated, was made up of irrigation works, the reciprocal percentage in the Republic of India was only 18.9%. Pakistan, not only received a larger share of irrigated land, but also, India had the percentage of irrigated land that was only of protective nature (eg. they were only in place as last resort in times of famine conditions as opposed to feeding the entire population). This was especially so of the irrigation land in the South of India, notably in Bombay, Mysore and Madras. The partition, therefore, hauled India to have greater dependence on the whimsical of rainfall, reckoning for the their annual fluctuations in agricultural production. This was detrimental to India s well being as even before the partition, India had a shortcoming in food, more specifically grains. This partition only further aggravated the problem. This can be seen through India having 82% of the population, but only producing 65% of the total crops. This was not so for the Pakistani population as they produced about one million tonnes of surplus food. The partition was therefore conducive in precipitating a net loss of 700,000 800,000 of annual supply in the Indian union. Additionally, the partition also initiated a severe shortage of raw cotton and raw jute as well. This effected the Indian economy ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...

14. Main Elements of a Contract Main elements of a contract A contract is a written or verbal agreement made between two or more parties in which the exchange of goods and/or services is agreed upon through unilateral or bilateral exchange. A successful contract contains at least six key elements, which detail how this exchange or exchanges will take place. A contract can also include details of how breach will be handled or details about how the contract can be legally terminated. Furthermore, a contract can have several defenses that will make it unenforceable by law. The six major elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, objections, mutuality of obligation, and competency. In contracts, an offer specifies what goods and/or services are going to be exchanged. An order can be defined as an expression of willingness to contract on certain terms, made with the intention that [terms] shall become binding as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom it is addressed (Treitel, 2007). As stated in the definition of offer, the next step in creating a successful contract is acceptance. Acceptance can also be referred to as genuine assent and requires that all parties partaking in a contract agree to the terms outlined in the offer. Legally, all terms outlined in a contract cannot be transferred to a third party, nor can services be subcontracted out to a third party unless there is a provision included in the contract that addresses how these circumstances should be handled.

Is childhood obesity caused by a lack of exercise, an unhealthy diet, or both? Obese people, or more commonly referred to as fat people or overweight people, are defined as adults who s BMI (body mass index) is over 30 percent. There have always been overweight people in human society, but the rate of growth for this percentage of our population has been steadily rising in the last few decades. When it comes to the topic of obesity, most of us will readily agree that it is a problem. Where this agreement usually ends, however, is on the question of why it is happening. Whereas some are convinced that this trait is genetic, others maintain that people become obese simply due to diet and lack of exercise. In discussions of overweight children, one controversial issue has been who is at risk. On the one hand, A. Cattaneo argues that ...excess adiposity is a key risk factor for many chronic diseases.

The caracal is also known by the name desert lynx, African lynx, Persian lynx and Asian lynx; however they are not members of the lynx family, rather they are from the Felidae family. The name caracal translates to mean black ear, borrowed from the Turkish language. This is because the caracal has long hairy tufts on the ears, and it is longer than that of other cats.

Both groups have their unique characteristics, ranging from living in different elevations to having distinctive social organization patterns. Both Hmong and Lao have very idiosyncratic ethnic identities. Hmong are known for their diaspora from the mountainous region of southern China into Southeast Asia (Lecture, 02/07/17).

Hmong followed a patrilineal kinship system. Only men can inherit properties and belongings; the father holds title to family property. When couples are married, residence after marriage is either patrilocal or neolocal, but in the vicinity of paternal house (LeBar, 75). When daughters marry, they move out of the house. Hmong marriage is regarded as a bond between two clans, so they have strict exogamy practices. Hmong men remain members of their birth clan for life (Hein, 68). Each of the family clans have a leader, who is the eldest male of the line. Their society was male centered (Lecture, 01/26/17). On the other hand, Lao followed the Southeast Asian pattern, which was a bilateral kinship system. Kinship ties are felt to be equally strong on both sides, the mother and the father (LeBar, 217). Lao kinship is more laid back compared to Hmong. They pay little attention to genealogies, since tracing more than three generations is difficult for them (LeBar, 217). Both men and women can inherit in the family as well, so Lao women are less subordinate to Lao men. Unlike Hmong, Lao couples have freedom in choosing whether to live on their own or with either spouses family (Lecture, 01/26/17). Lao marriage does not ensue strict exogamy practices, and Lao, traditionally, have no family names. Lao are known by their given names, not family names.

25. The Maya Civilization During The Preclassic Period It was during the Paleo Indian period when early nomads crossed into the Americas over 15,000 years ago. These were the First People to inhabit the Americas. They d first crossed into North America until eventually splitting off from other groups and eventually migrating south through Mexico into the Yucatán Peninsula of Mesoamerica. These migrating First People in the Maya region developed their tool and hunting technologies and went from being nomadic hunter gatherers into forming more permanent settlements. These settled groups became more developed as they exploited the plentiful local resources. These now settled groups progressed into the Archaic period and began advancing into a more complex society. These archaic settlements developed culture and technology that was shared with neighboring settled groups. The exchange of ideas between these groups formed into a shared culture that began developing into a culturally distinct people. The Maya Civilization originated in the Yucatán region during the Preclassic Period at around 2000 BC. There is some argument as to when the Preclassic Period began for the Maya. It s argued to have began as late as 2600 BC, while there s claim that it s earlier because there are permanent Maya settlements along the Pacific coast that date to 1800 BC.

The book, Before the Melting Pot gives a great account of how much ethnicity factored into these ideas and how New York City was made into the melting pot of culture we see today. The book starts out in New Amsterdam, detailing the importance of The Dutch West India Company and its importance in trade; including the African slave trade. The citizens of New Amsterdam had little to no say in governmental decisions. At times, there were citizen advisory boards created, and a director general that made decisions, but for the most part even these issues were at the mercy of the Dutch West India Company s control. More specifically, the commander and ruler named Peter Stuyvesant was the director general that made all the Dutch West India Company s decisions in New Netherland, until the English took over power. The book goes into detail about the people over the courses of their lives, more specifically, three different generations of men starting with those present at the English acquisition of New Netherland in 1664, the sons of these men who stayed in New York City, and then their grandchildren.

Duffy uses this as a way to explore all the feelings and emotions of the character and could be interpreted as Duffy trying to make the audience have sympathy for Mrs Havisham. The Laboratory uses colours to create a superficial character who doesn t see the poison as dangerous or deadly, but as some sort of treasure. She refers to gold oozings and the exquisite blue as if to think of them as magical potions and not poisons. This is done to create an almost naivety to her character and suggests that she doesn t understand how dangerous her actions are.

In his painting, Diana and Her Nymphs Departing for the Hunt, Rubens positions Diana, a goddess in Roman mythology, at the forefront of the piece partially topless, reflecting her fertility and sexuality; meanwhile in the background a confrontation between a nymph and satyr display the conflict between nakedness and nudity, male and female, and obscene and control.

In the article, Erotic Ambiguities: The Female Nude in Art, Helen McDonald, graduate of fine arts at University of Melbourne, argues that the difference between nude and naked can be simplified to the difference between privilege form over matter, male over female, and art over obscenity (McDonald 61). In order for the naked body to survive as art, Rubens must discipline and regulate the body (McDonald 61). In the painting, Diana and her nymphs are nude as opposed to naked because they are bounded by clothes and their body movements seem controlled. However, the satyr is naked instead of nude because his motions appear erratic and forceful, not within bounds, and the nymph is trying to control him. Diana, the goddess of the hunt, epitomizes control in the photo not just through her body language but because she has the power to tame wild animals, which is illustrated with her interaction with the dogs in the painting. Additionally, Nicole Sault in The Savage Body claims that a savage can be distinguished through his nakedness and that savages are typically portrayed as males until they have been controlled, in which they are depicted as female (Sault 4).

For instance mountains have an influence on wind and wind is an important feature in rainfall, The windward sides of mountainous islands in the trade wind regime are among the rainiest places on earth, where rains exceed ...

This means that where the air is slowly descending the pressure is high and vice versa. So, as air descends, it warms, which inhibits the formation of clouds. This means that the air that descends in high pressure area has to get to high altitudes in some way which is why air actually rises in low pressure areas. Winds tend to blow into low pressure areas because are moves from higher pressure areas into lower pressure areas. When the wind moves into a low area the air moves up and eventually cools and rainfall comes about. Also the low pressure that causes the air to rise has to do with the Criolis Effect, which is the force caused by the Earth s spin that redirects moving air to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. According to meteorologist Tony Pann, who works with Coriolis Effect stated, With the Coriolis effect, air circulates in patterns that depend on latitude. At the mid latitudes of the USA, most weather systems move from west to east. However, systems tend to move from east to west near the poles and in the tropic (Pann).
