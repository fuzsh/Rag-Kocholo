        "text": "OpenAI may lose $5B this year & may run out of cash in 12 months, unless they raise more money.... As per analysis by The Information - \"OpenAI could lose $5 billion this year and might run out of cash within 12 months if it doesn't secure additional funding.\" What analysis say - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscribed to our Venture Daily Digest newsletter and join 20000+ founders, investors and tech people to get daily updates: https://lnkd.in/dQuvt5xR ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"OpenAI is projected to lose $5 billion this year, with significant expenses on Azure bills and training costs. This financial situation raises concerns about the company's profitability and its ability to compete with other tech giants like Meta, which offers similar technology for free. The company's strategy, including its focus on solving AGI and the lack of a clear profit model, is under scrutiny. The potential need for additional funding within the next 12 months highlights the financial challenges facing OpenAI.\" What's your thought on this? . #startups #genai #founder #ai #startup #founders #news #openai\n\nAnthropic Launches $100 Million AI fund Silicon Valley's venture capital scene just got a lot more interesting.... Menlo Ventures, a major player in the AI investment game, is teaming up with Anthropic to launch a $100 million initiative called \"the Anthology Fund.\" This move is set to shake up the early-stage AI startup landscape. Let's break it down: The Big Picture: ‚Üí Menlo Ventures and Anthropic are joining forces to invest in pre-seed, seed, and Series A AI companies ‚Üí The $100 million Anthology Fund aims to identify and support promising AI startups ‚Üí This collaboration leverages Menlo's VC expertise and Anthropic's AI model prowess Behind the Scenes: Menlo Ventures has been making some serious moves in the AI space. They recently became Anthropic's top backer, closing a massive (and still unannounced) funding round of over $750 million. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is! How It Works: ‚Üí Startups can apply online for funding ‚Üí Checks start at $100,000, plus $25,000 in Anthropic model credits ‚Üí Menlo will use its own ML tool to score and rank applications ‚Üí The diligence process will be \"lightweight\" compared to typical VC investments Tim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures, explained their thinking: \"We're huge fans of what Anthropic is doing. This is an opportunity for us to do something together, where we can see the ecosystem and find great companies building on Anthropic or AI more broadly.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscribed to our Venture Daily Digest newsletter and join 20000+ founders, investors and tech people to get daily updates: https://lnkd.in/dQuvt5xR ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Looking Ahead: Menlo isn't just stopping at initial investments. They're committed to backing promising Anthology Fund companies in future rounds. This could be a game-changer for AI startups looking for long-term support and guidance. Our take? This is a smart play by both Menlo and Anthropic. They're creating a pipeline of innovative AI startups while solidifying their positions in the competitive AI investment landscape. It'll be fascinating to see what kind of groundbreaking companies emerge from this initiative. What do you think about this new fund? Could it lead to the next big AI breakthrough? . #startups #ai #genai #founders #founder #startuptips #updates #news #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #update #new\n\nApple & Anthropic illegally Used 170,000 YouTube Videos to Train AI Models. The AI world is in a bit of hot water, and YouTube's at the center of it all. An investigation by Proof News and WIRED has uncovered a massive dataset of YouTube content being used to train AI systems without permission. We're talking big numbers here: ‚Üí Over 170,000 YouTube videos ‚Üí Content from more than 48,000 channels ‚Üí Subtitles only - no actual video footage Now, who's using this data? Some heavy hitters in the tech world: ‚Üí Apple ‚Üí Anthropic ‚Üí Nvidia ‚Üí Salesforce And they're not alone. This \"YouTube Subtitles\" dataset is part of a larger collection called The Pile, put together by EleutherAI. It's got all sorts of stuff - books, Wikipedia articles, you name it. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscribed to our Venture Daily Digest newsletter and join 20000+ founders, investors and tech people to get daily updates: https://lnkd.in/dQuvt5xR ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- But here's where it gets personal. Big names in the YouTube world are caught up in this mess: MrBeast, Marques Brownlee (MKBHD), The New York Times & The Verge etc. MKBHD's not taking this lying down. He tweeted about it, calling it \"an evolving problem\" that's gonna stick around for a while. And he's probably right. This whole situation is raising some big questions about AI training data. Remember that Books3 dataset controversy from last year? Same deal here. Authors are suing companies for using their work to train AI without permission. The real kicker? AI companies aren't exactly forthcoming about their training data. Take OpenAI's Mira Murati, for example. When asked about using YouTube videos for their Sora tool, she kept dodging the question. YouTube's stance is clear: ‚Üí CEO Neal Mohan says using video content or transcripts for AI training goes against their terms of service ‚Üí Google CEO Sundar Pichai backs this up, expecting companies to play by the rules So, what now? Well, if you're curious, there's a search tool to check if your favorite YouTuber's content was used. But this debate is far from over. It looks like we're just scratching the surface of the AI training data controversy.
