        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 9, 1996--KPMG's\n\nInformation, Communications and Entertainment (ICE(SM)) practice, helping navigate the volatile and complex digital universe, has worked with a leading industry publication to identify 250 \"shining stars\"-- companies that industry executives and investors should watch closely.\n\nProduced by the editors of The Red Herring -- the monthly magazine that covers financial and investment issues in the information, communications and entertainment industries -- \"The Red Herring Guide to the Digital Universe\" provides an overview of digital commerce and profiles 250 companies on the leading edge of the digital environment. The book will be released April 18 by Warner Books. The companies that appear in the profiles section which makes up the book's second half were chosen based on performance metrics and company nominations provided by KPMG ICE consultants, and on interviews with venture capitalists, investment bankers, industry analysts and high-tech executives from the U.S. and overseas.\n\nIn conducting its portion of the evaluation, KPMG ICE found that traditional measurements, such as earnings growth, market share, balance sheet strength and stock performance, were not adequate for identifying the best performers in the digital economy -- capitalization, marketing savvy, management vision and the ability to respond quickly to rapid, drastic shifts in the industrial landscape counted for more. \"Many of the most interesting companies are still private and in their early stages of development,\" Roger Siboni, national managing partner of KPMG's ICE practice, writes in the introduction to the book's company profile section. \"To evaluate these companies, we needed methods that better describe their master of the continually changing environment that characterizes the digital world. In essence, we needed to establish a new performance metric for the '90s.\"\n\nStarting with a pool of 1,000 companies, the list was narrowed to 250. To make the final selection, KPMG and The Red Herring looked at a range of characteristics within five main categories - assessing a company's ability to contribute to a paradigm shift (based on its technology, marketing, alliance activity and business model, among others); the quality of its management team (including vision, strategic thinking, ability to attract and retain talent, and grounding in reality); the strength of its financial resources (including cash flow, debt burden, proportion of revenues from recurring sources, and consistency of revenues and earnings); market dominance (ability to set the terms of competition and overall share or high ranking in main markets) and market potential (revenue from products introduced in the past five years, technology leadership, and ability to be first to market). Taken together, the new criteria provide a means for evaluating both large companies and young startups on an equitable basis, Siboni says.\n\nDespite the diversity of companies included, there were common elements among the companies that made the \"shining stars\" list. They tended to be:\n\no Younger (71.2 percent were established after 1979)\n\no Smaller, in terms of staff, capitalization and revenue (58.8 percent had under 1,000 employees and 79.2 percent had under 10,000; nearly half -- 42.8 percent -- were privately held; 19.2 percent had annual revenues under $10 million and another 32.4 percent had none or wouldn't disclose)\n\no From the West Coast (61 percent)\n\nForty percent were entertainment companies, 36.4 percent were from the computer industry (comprising hardware, software, networking and semiconductors, among others) and 23.6 percent were communications companies.\n\nSiboni expects readers to challenge some of the selections -- and to point out omissions. In general, he believes that the list is more significant for the success criteria, company characteristics and industry trends it identifies, than for the particular companies that are listed. \"In this technology business, things change fast. Today's bright star could be tomorrow's supernova. Whether these companies would appear in future versions of the list depends on whether they can adapt quickly, assess new opportunities and shift instantly to take advantage of them,\" he says.\n\n-0-\n\nOne of KPMG's five industry-focused lines of business, the Information, Communications and Entertainment (ICE(SM)) practice provides assurance and advisory services to clients who produce content, distribution and delivery systems for the information superhighway.
