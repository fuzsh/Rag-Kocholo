        "text": "This thesis explores the concepts of space and time in videogames. From the designer's monitor to the player's screen, spatiotemporal elements shape the player's experience of videogame spaces, expanding on her perceptions of everyday life. I draw on theories from art, architecture, geography and anthropology in order to understand how the spatiotemporal elements in videogames relate to contemporary approaches to space and time where the ideas of non- places and everyday life are paramount. My central argument is that spatiotemporal experiences in videogames occur within the context of everyday life, rather than residing within the realm of virtual reality, a simulation that evokes the construction of a space of representation that can be related -as if it were real, effecting a separation from the -really real. Everyday life happens within the context of non- places with unique characteristics and singular manipulations to which space and time are susceptible in videogames, thereby expanding on the player's field of everyday reality in particular ways. Henri Lefebvre suggested that every society produces a certain kind of space of its own and Marc Auge affirms that our supermodern times have spawned a new type of space: the non- place. Non- places are transient spaces, devoid of relational and historical elements and Auge argues that they are the opposite of anthropological places, where inscriptions of the social bond or collective story can be seen. Anthropological places are being lost to supermodern non- places, and by using gamic examples, I will extend the concept of supermodernism to the experience of space within the game realm. These transient passages through videogames challenge us to adapt to new paradigms of interaction in space and time.

Central to this is expanding upon Mark Fisher’s (2022a, 2022b)[1] and Simon Reynolds’ (2012) insights provided around hauntology in the context of popular music. Hauntology begins to provide an answer to the question surrounding the viability of the future, in that nostalgia is instead a symptom of hauntology, a byproduct of media’s increasing unwillingness to escape its past compounded by an inability to imagine a different future. This is where my concept of “Hauntological Form” is significant. It serves two core purposes; the first is to acknowledge contemporary videogames increasing dependence on past form and secondly that this can offer a solution to provide a version of newness, albeit at the cost of novelty. A distinction between newness and novelty is crucial in understanding the extent to which contemporary videogames are beholden to the past as well as what is available to provide something different enough to products that have come before. [1] Both Capitalist Realism (originally published 2009) and Ghosts of My Life (originally 2014) were republished as second editions in 2022.\n\nThis thesis examines gaming lifeworlds and seeks interventions into the hegemony of gaming culture tied to a persistent imaginary of ‘Gamers’ as young white heterosexual males. Despite attempts to cultivate diversity, most approaches to improving representation in videogames do not demand significant structural or environmental change, and thus generally continue to foster precarity. In thinking about precarity, I establish the concept of ‘(not)coping’ to challenge the assumed dichotomy by which every instance of ‘not coping’ designates a failure ‘to cope’. Rather than viewing ‘coping’ and ‘not coping’ as positive and negative binaries, I write ‘(not)coping’ to highlight the liminal zone in between these affective states. (Not)coping is thus used to further describe the transformative affective spaces necessary for the refusal to cope within and against hegemony. I use qualitative mixed methods, combining semi-structured interviews, ethnographic participant observation, and discourse analysis to examine everyday struggles and how people can become affectively (re)orientated towards and away from certain videogame assemblages – assemblages of objects, communities, and practices. My findings are presented as three main chapters, which investigate videogames in relationship conflicts, videogames in drunk spaces, and videogames in self-care discourses. In the field of game studies, methods of investigation are frequently configured around studying play, players, or the creation of play. However, this focus can ignore non-players, non-play relationship dynamics, and non-play-centric spaces that themselves also significantly shape videogame and play assemblages. Since the study of gaming lifeworlds crucially apprehends videogame assemblages as embedded in materiality, rather than separate from everyday life, I hope to demonstrate its use as a generative framework and model for feminist games, media, internet, cultural researchers to study videogames in culture."
