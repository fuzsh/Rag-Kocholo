In a series of groundbreaking articles and books, he has identified important new trends in the economy and described new business models for seizing the business opportunities they represent.

Chris will explain that free is the future of business and how to thrive through freeconomics — what business models look like when free has emerged as a full-fledge economy.\n\nChris worked at The Economist for seven years in various positions and served as an editor at the two premier science journals, Science and Nature. He has an education background in physics, including research at Los Alamos.\n\nSimon Andriesen\n\nSimon Andriesen is managing director of The Netherlands-based MediLingua, specializing in the localization of medical technology, biomedical, pharmaceutical, clinical trial and other health-related information.
