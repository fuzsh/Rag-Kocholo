FALL l986/WINTER 1956—37\n\nTwenty Years—Looking Back and Looking Forward\n\nWENTY YEARS have passed since, after a brief interruption. Warld Orrin resumed publication in the fall of 1966. During that fifth of a century the world has changed, and our magazine has changed with it. There have been gradual modifications in format and style. the circle of our intetests i115 widened, but the essence has ternained the same. Warld Order is more than ever committed to peace, the equality of races. the equality of sexes, univarsal education, the abolition of extremes of poverty and wealth, and all the onhet principles of the Baha'i Faith that are the indispensable prerequisites of a universal and spiritualized civiliution.\n\nLeafing through some eighty issues of the magazine, we not: first of all the diversity of subjects and issues dealt with in our pages: \"California Cont Redwoods\" by Richard Ste Bathe Baker, \"The Institutionalization of Rniigion\" by Juli] Mahmoudi, ”Anthropology and Education\" by Zde- nek Saizmann. ”Ann Frank: The Child and the Legend\" by Rosey E.

One such reader writes:\n\n. . , Do I detect in your Fall 1972 issue . . . a slight lack of balance?\n\nAs far as I can see, (his issu: is writ~ (en by University professors and far University professors nnlyi . . i When a rank-and-file Bahé'i (like myself), or a casual reader in the Public Library opens this dignified and beautifully made-up Bahé'i magazine (it is still a Bahé'i magazine?!), expemntly, and hopes to find some inspiration in its pages. he or she will be disappointed,\n\nThe leader goes on to make specific com- plaints about three 0f the articles on the\n\ngrounds of their being abstract. heavily documented. lacking in human interest, and devoid of Baha'i Content, Our articles, she implies, shauld be couched in simpler language and concern matters that would not be unfamiliar to a majority of Baha'i: or, indeed, of Amuicans.\n\nAlthough such letters comprise a marked minutity 0f the letters we rcceivc—lcttets ranging from simple expressions of opin- ion to requests for reprints (for example, we have received messages asking for large numbers of reprints of the ANISA articles along with Expressions of appreciation of the impact they are having in educational cirdesy—th: Editors have taken these lov- ing criticisms very seriously, in the spirit in which they have been oﬂ’eted. They con— firm us in our Iong-standing intention to state once again and more clearly than ever before the role of WORLD ORDER, {or it is important for Bahé'is, and useful for their friends, to know the orientation of this magazine. the leading public which it envisages, and the impact which it is ex- pected to make on the community of thinking Americans, not to mention the wider. woxld community to which the English language is accessiblei\n\nEvery issue of WORLD ORDER has, on the inside cover, the following statement: \"WORLD ORDER is intended to stimulate, inspire, and serve thinking people in their search to find relationships between con- temporary life and contemporary religious teachings and philosophy,\"\n\nThe firsr issue of the post-war WORLD\n\n[Page 5] INTERCHANGE\n\nORDER made an explicit Statement of its\n\npolicy: , . .WORLD ORDER . . t provides a for— um fat those who are convinced that only through unity can mankind escape desrtuttion and move resolutely toward a world civiliution, Out editorial policy may be deduced from the very title of out magazine 4 , but an explicit state- ment of this policy will be useful.\n\nWe are providing an opportunity for the discussion Of a vast number of prob- lems that mint be solved if the goal of a unified and peaceful humanity is ever to be achieved; whence out interest in the povetty question i . . ; in the social implications of racial and cultural dif- fetenees, and in the physiul and an- thtopological facts that undetlie such diﬂ'etenees; in linguisrics, as a clue bath (0 the nature of human thought and to cultural difi'erentiation—in short, in the whole range of social and ethical prob- lems.\n\nThe past, from which we seek instruc- tion and inspiration, will be dealt with, and we will publish from time to time historical matedals. t . . The eSthetic side of life will not be neglected, . i .\n\nBelieving that religion is the source of man's highest aspirations and ultimately the only forte capable of lead- ing mankind to peace and unity, we will deal with every aspect of the Bahé'i Faith, as well as with other religions of the wotldt . . .\n\nThus our magazine represents 3 dia-\n\nlogue among those, whether Bahé'i or net, whose efforts to understand and do samething about the human condition have btought them to a point at which the exchange of ideas and insights will be of common benefit.\n\nWe do nor believe that the suggestions made by some of our readers are directed to the modification of these aims; their criticism is. tathet, that these aims ate im— plemented in a way that excludes a certain number of potential tenders, 0t nlienates some of out present traders. In this con- nection we must take note of the following statement of the Universal House af )us— rice (the international governing body of the 311151 Faith), dated October 5]. 1967. and later published in WeIIJpring pf Guid- ance. p. 124;\n\nThe same presentation of the teach- ings will net appeal to everybody; the method of expression and the approach must be varied in accordance with the outlook and interests of the heater. An approach which is designed to appeal to everybody will usually result in atttact- ing the middle section, leaving both ex- tremes untouched. No effort must be spared to ensure that the healing Ward of God teaches the rich and the poet. the learned and the illiterate, the old and the young, the devout and the athe- iSt, the dweller in the remote hills and islands, the inhabitant of the teeming cities, the suburban businessman. the labatet in the slums, the nomadic ttibesman, the university student . . .\n\n[Page 6]\n\n6\n\nWORLD 01mm: FALL I986/WINTER |98H7\n\nClearly, the task of any Baha’i bringing the message of God to the people is to get to know those to whom he brings it, in tetrns of their \"outlook and intetests.“ It would appear, from the policy statement concerning the content of the magazine, that WORLD ORDER‘s reading public might fairly be described as \"intellectual,\" Now, what is an \"intelleCtual\"? In the fitst place, this is a term that neither praises not blamest It does not mean \"intelli— gent.\" and it does not mean \"pedantic\"; it does not necessatily even mean \"edu- cated\" or “wel.l<tead,\" although there is a certain positive correlation between the “intellectual\" and the “well—tead.\" It can conveniently be taken to refer to a social subgroup: “Intellectuals” are to be found in certain professions; they range typically Within a certain income group; they have, or claim to have—Which {tom the socio~ logical point of view is iust as impottant— roughly the same mm (literature, musit, an, and so on) and the same social atti- tudes. Like any othet social gtoup, intel- lectuals ate subjeu to superstitions. taboos, prejudices, blind spats, more or less pe- culiar to them, Intellectuals are important, from a purely practical point of view, be- cause they represent an inﬂuence on out destinies fat out of proportion to their numbers. They exert enormous inﬂuence in govetnment, in moral attitudes, in pop- ular taste; and they exert this inﬂuence quietly, in a way of Which the common man is mostly unaware.\n\nIf one examines the taboos, the “folk— motes” of the intellectual, what does he see? Ptimatily, a dedication to objxtive truth, as it is called. This has the conse~ quence that there ate certain cues 0t clues that arouse the instant suspicion of the weLl-indocttinated intellectual. It means that no statement can be confidently as- serted without objective proof. It also means that emotion and intuition are not constituents of proofmthat is, that proof\n\nmust carefully exclude appeals to intui- tion, to faith, to feeling; it must rest solely on objective (act,\n\nThe intellectual pwsition described here is defective in that it defeats its stated put- pase of seeking truth. The Editors hold that the exclusion of feeling, of faith, of intuition, is an impossibility. Those who claim to be capable of it ate simply fooling themselves. They are doing themselves two kinds of harm: First, they ate repressing the whole world of feeling and love, on which their mental and emotional health depends—they impose on theix lives a kind of battenness that leads to confusion and despair. Second, in hiding from themselves the emotional and intuitive basis of what- evet they claim to believe, they at: allow- ing free play to the disguised forces of pas- sion, of the very baneful interferences with truthful insights that they think they ate avoiding. Let them discover the richness of an honest emotional and spiritual life, and they will be much fortified in their search {or the truth.\n\nMany of those \"intellecmals\" wha in- dulge the illusion of mid objectivity know, deep down, that they are missing some- thing, They do not. perhaps, realize the gtavity of their loss. They have been trained in the ways of reptession, net only of the bestial instincts Freud makes so much of, but also in the repression of the best part of themselves, the operation of the spirit that enables them to sense clearly that God exists and that teligion is as real as thought, emotion, and esthetic experience. Many intellectuals have been so thoroughly in- docuinated that they react with suspicion to such words as :piritual, divine, God, mu], revelalim, prap/Iet; and tecently their mot» al life has become as eroded as their spit» itual iife—that is, having ruled out the di- vine as being obiecdvely nondemcnsttable, they are beginning to rule out the metal. One of the moral ptincipies left to them is that of tolerance, which is ptaisewotthy;\n\n[Page 7] INTERCHANGE\n\n7\n\nbut tolerance is being extended to the sin- ful, the immoral. the Criminal. and the de- prayed.\n\nSo it is evident that the intellectual to whom one tries to bring the message of Bahé'u'lléh must be apptonched, like any- one else, with sensitive understanding, He am only be reached by those means. those appeals. to which he has net been trained to react negatively. Once there is intro- duced a notion or even a method of tea— soning of whose intellectual respectability he has not been assured. he is alienated perhaps for gaod: the beater of the mes- sage has been discredited, and the word Bah“ is in danger of being, however un- justly. associated with something intellec- tually unacceptable.\n\nTa deal with people, intellectuals or not. one must opemte at first within the frame- work of their preconceptions One does not want to oﬂ'end an intellectual any more than one would want to ofiend, say, a Catholic One does net start oi? with a Oatholic by telling him everything that is wrong with Catholicism; rather one tells him what is right about the Baha'i Faith, preferably in tetrns that correspond to those deep truths it shares with Catholicism. Given the essential unity of religions, this approach to a Catholic is possible and in- deed the only proper one, Given the hat- mony of science and religion. the duty of {tee and independent investigation of the ttuth, the approach to the intellectual is similarly facilitated.\n\nJ05! as the Bahé'is have harmony among people of all religions, so that the Baha‘i community numbers among its members former Jews, Catholics, Protestants. Mus» lims, Buddhists, atheist humanists, and so forth. not through renunciation of what had been true in our previous faiths, but through the addition to those faiths of the precious new insights of Bahé’u'llfih, so the intellectual, too, has the tight to share in this ecumenismi Our perhaps unﬂattering\n\ndescription of some seif-styled intellecruals is really no worse than what one might say of a religious bigot. The intellectual, too. insofat as he is ptivileged to know any truth at all. shares to that degree in the Bah“ Faith. When we Bahé‘is talk about the harmony of science and religion, we must respect science, genuinely and whole- heartedly. just as we have been enjoined to respect Islam, )udaism, and Chtistianity. Science is a gift of God. If scientific meth- ods are used in suppott of spiritual truths. as has happened more than once in our pages. they must be considered with re specrful attention. A plain. serious pres- entation of the sociological and political adaptations of Eskimos to life in this new age. such as appeared in out Fall 1972 is- sue, tends, in addition to telling the mov- ing story of human beings in mmsition, tn underline the principle of the teconcilia- tion of science and religion This principle. a primordial article of Lhe Dahé'i Faith for more than a century now. has just been “discovered\" in the past decade under the name of ”relevance.\" In a similar manner, an attempt to place educational principles in their philosophical perspective is of enormous importance to those who feel that an honest stand on any issue must be taken on the ground of a philosophy. an ideology, a set of consciously held princi- ples. The series of articles on ANISA—a project that enjoys the collaboration of Bahé’i and non-Bahé'i educatots—ex- plains the philosophical basis of this new approach to education and compares it to essentially defective philosophies of the past, philosophies that continue to have powerful support from intellectuals of out time. What can be mote important than bringing to the attention of this commu— nity 0f educators the importance of loving and—this must not be umitted—énnwing God and, through God, our fellowman? With regard to WORLD ORDER's explo- ration of the past, the unity of mankind\n\n[Page 8] WORLD ORDER: FALL )9B6/WINTER I986—E7\n\nand of religion is as striking in the time dimension as in geographical and cultural space. The insights ofjoachim of Flora can help us to understand our own relationship to teJigion and to intellectual putsuits, whethet we ate Bahé'is at not.\n\nMembership in the socially defined group of intellectuals is a matter of choice; but if one chooses the role of anti- inteilectual, one chooses disum'ty, division. Ptejudice against the intellecmai is essen- tially no diferent from other kinds of ptej» udice; if a Baha’i should find himself sus- picious of or hostile to professots, let him tty to see through to the man, his brother, underneath the symbolic academic tube.\n\nThe Editors of WORLD ORDER are ttying to be loyal to the human family, not to any subgroup thereof; but they can best serve the Faith by using theit membership in the intellectual community as a means of esrablishing themselves as pioneers thetein.\n\nIt is with these considerations in view that the Editorial Boatd has decided not to make any essential change in the edi- totial policy of WORLD 011931, We shall continue to rty to make the Language of out magazine as clear, as easy to undet- stand, as the subject matter will allow. We will, however, make no compromise with standards of literary quality, of clear, te» sponsible reasoning, at of scrupulous doc- umentation of faCts. We will maintain to the best of our ability a standard like that\n\nof Shoghi Eﬂ'endi, of whom Rfihiyyih fistula: wrote that he \"set a standard that educates and raises the cultutal level of the teadet at the same time that it feeds his mind and soul with thoughts and truth.\"\n\nThe Bahé'i who does not think of him» self as an intellectual must make a decision as to his way of adjusting to his SHIKUS, Largely self-confetred, In a very positive way, every Baha'i has found his life im- measurably enriched by his feeling—a feeling teinfotced by knuwledgr—of kin- ship to all peoples: to the nomads, the ttibesmen, the people of distant lands and diEctent cultures. When this feeling is translated into acrion, the Baha'i finds that he can talk and interact With an enormous vuiety of people; he can explain the Faith to Catholics and Muslims. to Buddhists and to atheists; his new and intense in- terest in teligion has led him to examine religions of whose existence, very often, he was only dimly aware, before he betame an adherent to the Cause of God. Let him, therefore, inform himself about the pteoc- cupations, the ideals, the love of tmth that charsetetize the intellectual at his best, iust as he infutms himself about the teligion of the seeker with whom he is speaking; {or 'Ahdu'l-Bahé has said that the seeker musr first be confirmed in his own faith. The Editots feel that it is in the pages of WORLD ORDER that the noninteiiectual Bah‘a'i can learn how best to appeal to his intellectual brochet,\n\n[Page 9]\n\n[Page 10]\n\n[Page 11] The Spiritual Revolution\n\nBY DOUGLAS MARTIN\n\nAfter nth\" “rwolmiam“—ar gmzl Iorial, m;- namir, and paliliml \"arufirrnalium have been navml—u :pin'lnal nmltm'or/ i1 rww dawning that will attemplilb w/ml lb: nlbtn baa: only [minted IL Tbil 1974 ankle. in (unjunrlinn will) [bate by Haliber and Rama” (.m page; 29—41 and 75—87), bring! logtlber lb: :1:- rrmm of \"Man and inn'luali/j :Jnnlial In a tan: world 0rd”.\n\nGLOBAL REVOLUTION is the dominant fact\n\nof life in our age.

It is apparent that we in fact are witnessing a massive revulsion on the part of mankind againSt ways of life that, in their nature and their goal, are seen as anti-life, In so sweeping and ptofound a reaction violence is incidental The essential revolution advances quietly. often for a time unnoticed. in the heatts of millions of peeple who spiritually \"drop out\" of a world they have found meaningless The routine tasks may or may not be done; laws may be obeyed ot ﬂouted; but the mats of faith—without which no society can long enduu—imve been severed.\n\nThis is the first thing that can with con- fidence be said about the revolution of out times: it is in essence inritual.\n\nThe first voice to make this Statement, a century ago. was that of Baha’u'lléh, Founder of the Bahé'i Faith. In announcing Himself to be the Messenger of God awaited by all the world's religions. Bahé'u'lléh declared the unification of mankind in one people and one univetsal social order to he the Will of God in this age, He asserted that the revelation of this divine purpose had set in motion forces within bath man and society that would in time transform human existence:\n\nI testify that no sooner had the First Word\n\nproceeded, through the potency of Thy will\n\nand purpose, out of His mouth .

Now, almost overnight, in the wake of the universal Revelation of God promised in all the sacred scriptures of the past, people everywhere are awakening to the possibilities of human life, Something that can truly be called humanity is being born.\n\nOne thing only is lacking. \"The whole of mankind,” Shoghi EFFendi states, “i gman- ing, is dying to be led to unity, . . ['7 The achievement nf such a unity involves the building of a society fit for human beings to live in. That is where the revolution is going, However lung and bloody the process. man— kind is struggling blindly toward the creation of a world community.\n\nBahi‘is believe that the \"nucleus\" and \"pattern\" of that community already exisr, as the result of a hundred yeats of work by the spitit of Bahé'u'lléht8 Slowly, over the past century, as the Baha'i teachings have been carried (0 all parts of the world, people of every racial and national origin have em- btaced them As they have done so. they have sought to give these teachings effect not only in their personal lives. but also in their social relationships.\n\nBahé'u'lléh's conception of organic com- munity has been summed up in these words:\n\nIn the human body, every cell, every or-\n\n[Page 14] 14 WORLD ORDER: FALL l9xG/WINTER l9B6—B7\n\ngan, every nerve has its part to play.

In (ontmst to the deepening disorder ml\" the world around it, its original unity remains unbroken, as bath its expansion and diver- sification rapidly accelerate, 'Ahdu'l-Bahé's vision of world unity emerging from world- wide revolution begins to take on form and substance: In the contingent world there are many collective centers which are conducive to association and unity between the children of men.

Nevertheless, all the above institu- tions are in reality, the matter and not (h: substance, accidental and not eternal— temporary and not everlasting. With the appearance of great revolutions and up- heavals, all these collective centers are swept away. But the Collecu‘ve Center of the Kingdom, embodying the Institutions and Divine Teachings, is the eternal Collective Centen It establishes relationship between the East and the WeSt, organizes the ime- uess of the world of humanity, and de- su'oys the foundation of clilferenees.m\n\nFROM THE POREGOING it will be apparent why (hOSE who have recognized Bahé'u'lléh regard the well-beaten path of political action not metely as pointless, but as wasteful of UI- gently needed resources. That is not to den- igrate the metivation af others. It relates sole— Iy m m inescapable priorities imposed by [Ecognidon of God’s Messenger [0 our age and of the Missiun entrusted to Him. Again, in words written on behalf of Shoghi Eﬂendi:\n\nWhat we Bahé'i’s must face is the fact that\n\nsociety is disintegrating so rapidly that\n\nmoral issues which were clear a half cen- tury ago are now hopelessly confused and\n\n. mixed up with battling political in- terests, That is why the Baha'i: must tum all their forces into the channel of building up the Baha'i Cause and its administra- tion. They can neither change nor help the world in any athet way at present. If they become involved in the issues the govern- ments of the world are struggling over, they will be [05L But if they build up the Bahé‘i pattern they can oHet it as a remedy when all else has failed,\"\n\nThat pattern itself includes service to the material as well as the spixitual needs of man- kind. From whatever background an individ- ual may enter the Baha'i Cause, recognition of Bahé'u'llih must inevitably and intensely sharpen his social conscience, So it is that atound the world Bahé‘ls are found working\n\n[Page 15] in a wide range 00' nonpartisan humanitarian programs. 50 it is. too. that Baha'i youth are encouraged to pursue educational goals that will fit them to contribute practically to the relief of human suffering and Want, Collec- tively the Baha'i cammunity itself devotes great energy to serving the aims of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies. What the Baha'i teachings deny is that political action of a national or Other partisan nature holds answers for problems that ate in their very essence universal. In the spreading public dis- illusionment with politically oriented agen- cies, Buhfi'ls see a reﬂection of this fan of twentieth—century life‘\n\nThe challenge that Bahé'u'iléh places be— fore the individual who recognizes Him is to work for the realimtion of 1: new pattern of human life. As men of all backgrounds have responded in evet inciming numbers, the implimtions of the challenge to the individ— ual have steadily become clearer. Shoghi Ef» fendi, it is reported, has explained:\n\n, . . the object of life to a Bahé'i is to pro- mote the oneness of mankind The whole object of our lives is bound up with the Lives of all human beings; not a personal salvatian we are seeking, but a universal one. . 1 Our aim is to produce a world civilization which will in turn react on the character of the individual.

REVOLUTION 15\n\nThe pursuit of such an objective tequites a transformation in the individuals otdet of moral priorities that is as revolutionary as any other aspect of the modem condition.\n\nThe human virtue to which Bahé'u'lléh assigns the highest place is iustice. H: says: ”0 Sun of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; tum nut away therefrom if thou desirest Me. . . . By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of othets, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor.\"” This central moral ﬂrll’lbulQ Bahé'u'llfih sets in the (on- text of community growth: \"The putpose of juStite is the appearance 0f unity mung men.\"\"‘\n\nlntimately telated to iustice in building healthy social relationships is love, Going be yond “the golden rule\" of past revelations, Bahé'u'lléh teaches that the creation of a hue man community that incarnates the principle of unity in diversity requires that men leatn literally to prefer Others to themselves. '5 We do this when we focus on the good qualities of out fellowmen. and. as individuals. reso— lmely overlook those qualities we do not ad- mire. The efi’ett is to nourish the desirable Im’ibutes that are neticed and praised, just as th: cﬂ’ect of censure and coldness is to blight individual sense of self-worth and in- hibit spiritual growth\n\nDetachment becomes another moral at- tribute of prime importance in such a con- text. Freed {tom the ascetic connotations of the past, detachment serves a vital function in such areas as the ptocess of consultation on which Baha'i institutional life entirely de- pends Attachment to the self includes at- tachment to ideas that are \"mine,\" to the ego that can be bmised. to the desire for one‘s own wishes to be accepted, The central prin- ciple of consultation, however. is the struggle of the group to find a collective mind. through which the spirit of Bahé‘u’llih can commu» nicate with them. As in all other areas of moral efi‘ort. the group reacts upon the in» dividual by requiring a conscious effort at de< tachment. until this becomes a habit.\n\n[Page 16] 16 WORLD omen: FALL I9BE/WINTE‘R 1986—87\n\nMateovet, it is only by living in a com- munity that an individual can discover and gradually emdimte the universal disease of prejudice. The more one works with people Of varying backgrounds, the more he finds his ptejudices ate groundless This includes nut mete tacial differences, but the much- discussed \"generation gap\" between the ideals of youth and those of the adult, the vast dif- ferences between the \"haves\" and the \"have- nots,” the division between the well-educated and the illiterate, the discrimination against women, and the host of Other forms that this age-old enemy of sacial order assumes.\n\nHoneSty is a moral quality that assumes new significance in the deliberate attempt to build an organically united society. Man to- day lives in a hypocritiml society whetein each person tends to develop a mask to hide his own feelings We also tend to say those things that we think will please our listeners (and something else when we are away from them). This has become so much a pattern that we sometimes even leatn to hide out true feel» ings from ourselves, because we seek accep- tance and feel that we must conform to the generally accepted point of view. The whole basis of Baha'i consultation is quite opposite to this. \" . at the very toot of the Cause lies the principle of the undoubted tight of the indlvidual to self-exptession. . . \"Tmthfulness is the foundation of all the vit- tues of the world of humanity.

Back- blting, for example, Baha'u'lléh tells us, “quencheth the light of the heart, and ex- tinguisheth the life of the soul.\"‘7 The only other human falling condemned in these pat~ thulM terms is the use of narcotic and hal- lucincgenic drugs.“\n\njum'rz, law, dnadmem. Ilaneity. freea'um fmm preiudiu and barkbiting—these ate a few of the spiritual qualities that Bahé'u'llah has redefined and emphasized as the focus for the individuals lnnet battle. In laying particular stress on these and other human attributes that directly serve the development of com— munity life, therefore, Bahé‘u'uéh has created a new system of moral priorities. The ethical standards that man has inhetited {tom past religions and culmtes do not necessatily con- ttibute equally, at in some cases at all, to the emergence of a universal civilization that rep» resents the long-awaited establishment of the Kingdom of God on earth. That Kingdom has its own integrity and its own processes of organic growth, and those Who would serve it can do so only in harmony with this di— vinely ordained pattern.\n\n\"0 friends! Be not careless 0f the virtues with which ye have been endowed neither be neglectful of your high destiny. ‘Be- wate lest the powers of the earth alatrn you. or the might of the nations weaken you, at the tumult of the people of discord de‘ tet you. or the exponents of earthly glory sadden you.\" \"This Day a door is open wldet than bath heaven and earth.

It can tear every bond asunder, and hath the power to teStote the force that hath spent itself and vanished.\"9\n\n[Page 17] THE FORM of the global society toward which mankind is being impelled must match these ideals, must indeed arise from the same di~ vine impulse. The agevold issue of authority in the organization of human aﬂ'aits must find a solution that not only unites the divetse peoples of the world. but protects and nut- tutee their individual capacity.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Revelation of Baha'- u’llah lies in its response to this challenge Fundamental to its teachings is the assertion that the \"age of human maturity\" has dawned. and that mankind is capable of responding to divine order in its social life, The central thrust of Bahfi‘u'lléh's mission. therefore, was the establishment of His ”Covenant.\" Through this Covenant, fot the first time in history, a Manifestation of God has Himself founded the institutions for the organization of the community life of those who recognize Him. Acting on His assurance, democrati- cally elected Bahé'i Spiritual Assemblies have been farmed at both local and national levels. In all theit essentials these inStitutions ate faithful reﬂections of the Will of God as te< vealed in the comprehensive written state- ments of His Messenger. Today they form one otganically united administrative system em- bracing the whole mlht\n\nIn 1963. on the hundredth anniversary of Bahé’u'lléh's declaration of His mission, the crowning unit of His embryonic Watld Order was successfully raised. In April of that year some elected teptesentatives of Baha‘u'lhlh‘s followers in every part of the globe gathered at the Bahé'i World Center on the slopes of Mount Carmel in the Holy Land. Thete they carried out the first democratic worldwide election in history The intetnationa] admin- istrative body born that day had been tonA ceived a century either by Beha'u’llah‘ It as- sumed the name given it by Him: “The Uni- versal House of Justice.\"\n\nWith the emergence of this central otgan of Bahé'u'lléh's Cause. the social model He\n\n20.8hoghi Eﬂ'endi, World Order a/ Babd'u'lla'b l6}.\n\nTHE SPIRITUAL REVOLUTION l7\n\nconceived a century ago Stands essentially complete.

To his House ofjustice Baha'- u'llAh has assigned a wide range of discretion in adapting the institutions and ordinances of this community to the exigencies of an ”ever- advaneing civilizations\" The essential pattern however has been set, and its viability dearly demonstrated.\n\nFat ahead lies the ultimate objective of Baha'u'lléh's coming. the establishment of the global society toward which the universal tev- olution of our times is tesistlcssly impelling all mankind‘ The ptesent generation of Bahé'u'lléh's followers will not see the attain- ment of this goals What they know is that it is attainable; that theit individual and col~ lective efforts bring it daily nearer. and that in this lies the teal meaning of life.\n\nThe Revelation of Baha'u'llah. whose su—\n\npreme mission is none other but the\n\nachievement of this organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations. should. if we be faithful to its implications, be re» garded as signalizing through its advent the aiming of age 0/ lb: miire human rare.

The preven- tion of war, the production of quantities of food sufficient for mankind‘s sut~ vival, the ptotection of the physical environment. the Stabilization of the world's economy. the elimination of poverty, are only a few of the pressing needs that mnnot be ignoted without impetiling the very existence of civilization The most elaborate philosophical. politiul. economic. and sotiological theories seem insufficient to the needs of a harassed and (tightened humanity.\n\nYet the solutions, though they involve a complete recunsu'uction of society, ate simple. The dificulty of implementing them lies basically in the recalci- trance of man's will.

In many important ways the italian-Ametican has mate in common with his fellow citizen of East European Jewish extmuion than has the former with his Neapolitan fizrebcars at the latter with the Jewish inhabitant of ptewar Vilma, This phenomenon is known as the Ametican melb in; port\n\nit is a process thxt. at its worst. tends to reduce American culture to a stui~ tifying conformity. but that, at its best, results in a pluralistic society Without a creative awareness of the cultural freedom inherent in the Ametican tradition. the distinctiveness of the various ethnic Strains is blurted; our diet consists of hambutgets and hot dogs. Pluralism oﬂ’cts to each individual his choice of many options: thus we have become appreciative eaters of pizza. sukiynki. sauerkraut, and gefilte fish. and this without tefetenc: to the ethnic origins of the individual diner. In the same way, any person can choose his religious and political afiliations (unless he ptefets to be unafiliated), his music. and his games from the tick menu America oﬂ'ers him.\n\nBath the secure but mindless conformity of the melting pot and the engaging but chaotic Welter of choices offered by pluralism have given rise to disillu- sionment and to a quest for alternatives. Although the two stand at entemes,\n\n[Page 25] ON THE QUEST FOR WORLD ORDER\n\n25\n\nthe one of uniformity, the other of variety, they have in common a distressing fuzzing of the line between manners and morals. While the one condemns even moderate departures from expected modes of dress. language. and manners, the other tends to a permissiveness bordering on toleration of antisocial, dc- sttuctive behavior.\n\nOne alternative that has been gaining favor in the last fifteen years or so has been the return to the ethnic identity—if it can be found—of out ancesrors. Many American Indians would like to forget that the European (and African and Asian) invasion of their land evet happened; if they could only return to the point at which the first European settlers found them, their troubles— alcoholism, malnutri on, loss of moral orientation—would be solved. Blacks Want to return to Aftimn ways, without going back to Africa They say, \"The Italians have their heritage, their language, their practices, intact after several generations of living in America, and so do the Poles. and the Irish; we want to discover our African heritage and live in accordance with it.\" The European ethnic groups, often unaware that they have been serving as models to stimulate the Black Power movement, say, \"They have Black Power—how about (51] in the name of your favorite ethnic group) Powet, too? We cannot have it by losing our identity in the American mass The melting pot has left me many lumps— let us tetutn (0 our true identity.\n\nOne American Indian leader has observed that ttibaljsm is nox the sole pos- session of nonwhite groups—it is as accurately represented in the ethnic struc- ture of white America as it is in the “ttibes” of the American Indians. There fore. he says, we should recognize American ttibalism as a fact and adapt to it, rather than to the myth of the melting putt\n\nWe agree with his observation, to a certain degree, but net with his con- clusion. A resort to ttibaljsm would be based on gtaver misconceptions than that of the melting pct. And its consequences Would be most dire, American Indian ttiballsm is not in the interests of American Indian carried to its cus- tomaty extreme, it sets one tribe again.“ another and deprives them of the ability to unite in defense of Indian tights. Every Indian who tends this will remember some incident of diseriminatory treatment in relations between Na- vajos and Hopis, between Oneidas and Menominces. As for black Americans, there is net one African race, there is not one African heritage, and certainly there is no African tradition that has survived intacr in the culture of black Americans African traits, detached from tribal contexn have become part of the Great American Mix, in some instances more characteristic of black Amet- icans than of others, but not exdusively so,\n\nNo; the tribal solution, whether for red, black, white, or yellow, is no solution at all, It is reactionary, repressive, disunifying, destructive of harmony and pro— gress, and withering to the individual Who seeks Wider horizons. The insistence that a poet be a Black Poet, rather than a good poet, is destructive of com— petence and sensitivity in art; the demand that correct Standard English no longer be taught in elementary schools the majority of Whose children speak Spanish at \"Black English\" should have come, not from the champions and representatives of those minorities, but from the most avid racists, intent on the destruction of all their civil liberties.\n\n[Page 26] 26\n\nmm ORDER: FALL lvas/WINTER I956417\n\nThe Bahfi'i communiry in the Uniud States has mnsistently advocnlcd unity mhzt dun uniformity.

Yet there has no: been any marked tendency on the part of esrablixhed religious authorities to look with favor on this basic Bahé'i teaching. Because each ortho— doxy has been adamant in its claim to sue perictity over other orthoduxies, there has been no common willingness to accede to the \"leveling\" belief (hat a dc {acre unity un» derlies the various great religious systems, Of course, (here i: a contradiction berween the various rites and rixuals. dogmas and creeds to be found in the present form of these re— ligious orthodoxis. What the Bahé'i Faith afirms is that Khfie rites. crccds, and dogmas are largely irrelevanl m the fundamental teachings, the essential purpose and meaning of religion. These teachings have, without ex- ception, enjoined such qualities as humility, love, compassion, tolerance. Fanatics can find no sanction for their fanaticism in the re- corded KCBdIingS of their founder. Ptesent-day religious arrogance is thus seen to be a partly deliberate. partly unwitting perversion of the viewpoint which the venerated founder had originally hoped to engender in his followers. Add to this the further observation that these founders were largely venerated only after the fact and were the object of scorn, hatred, and rcjecrinn in their day, and we have a thumb- nail sketch 0f religious hisrory,\n\nl have chosen the conﬂict between ortho- doxies as an analogy to the religion-scicncc conﬂict because I suspect that it is Closer than either teligionisrs or scientists would like to admit. Orthodox leligionists would dislike\n\n[Page 30] 30 WORLD ORDER: FALL l986/WINTER mssm\n\nthe analogy because they have been forced to admit the value of science after an initial te» sistance, and the idea that they may one day be fotted to capitulate in a similar manner befote the pervasive value of anothex religion which they initially misjudged—this would be painfuL Scientists would tesiSt the analogy in that it tends to tompate science to the dogma of a religious orthodoxy, a comparison which they would regard as invidious. Fat if anyone is \"winning\" the so-ealled teligion- science conﬂict, it is clearly science. Yet. it is not a novel observation that scientists are in— creasingly assuming the function and role played by priests in eatliet societies. They are the initiated, those who explain the great mysteries to the unwashed masses.\n\nAnyone who has had the opportunity to work in a scientific field knows how often se~ tious scientific achievement is embellished with a liberal amount of sham and wordplay If these ate not rituals designed to charm the masses (or one's Dean ot the National Science Foundation), they come uncomfortably dose to it,\n\nOf course, a scientist would object that all of this is not true science. This, he would say, is the concession the true seeker after scien— tific truth must make to the ultraptagmatic wotld»at—latge. The many exigencies of life in the political and social market place force the scientist, as an individual, into compromises, subtle and nut so subtle. with the basic prin» ciples of scientific inquiry. But, one might contend, this does not compromise science it- self, for anyone can plainly see that its ptin- ciples are pure and lead to excellent results when applied correctly.\n\nDoes n0t all this sound strangely like the well-wotn apology for the failures of religious inStitutions? \"Our institution is divine,\" we ate told, \"but you must not judge it by the 'human element' within it ot by the cottup- tion of individual exponents who may be weak and unredeemed.\"\n\nThe point is that both science and religion are human, social aetivities. As such. they cannot claim to be purer or mote exalted than their ultimate inﬂuence on society. This does\n\nnot mean that such activities do not draw on invisible sources of inspiration and powel’ to produce their eEett. It means only that the evident: for the existence of such hidden well- springs of creativity can only be measured by the ultimate, realizable eHeCt which these ac- tivities or institutions do indeed produce.\n\nThe outline of the Baha‘i approach to the teligion-science conﬂict now heaves mote cleaxly into view. It is that, when the true purpose and nature of science are understood and when the true purpose and nature of te- ligion are understood, then there is, de facto. no conﬂiCt. An essential unity is discovered, a unity which had always been present but hidden by the aberrations in the articulation of the two viewpoints just as Baha'is make no attempt to reconcile the confusing and contmdictory dogmas of different tdigious otrhoduxies. so they make no attempt to rec- oncile nattow-minded pronouncements by dogmatit would-be apologists for either sci- ence or religion.\n\nA notable feature of the religion-scienee controversy as it has actually existed in out recent history is this: new science came into conﬂict with old religion This fact must be borne in mind by anyone honestly seeking to undetstand the dynamics of the problem. Modem science is, indeed. new in any his- torical sense of the term. Even to date it from the Renaissance is a mistake. The chief fen“ tutes of contemporary science appear only in the nineteenth century Ofcoutse, its roots go deep into the past, indeed to the dawn of human intellectual endeavor. But this is true of everything What is Certain is that such a profound transformation of science was ef— fected in the nineteenth and twentieth cen- turies that one can properly speak of a tev- olution, however revolutionary the original sixteenth-century advances may appear with respect to their prehistory.\n\nOf course, even to dare the ”scientific tev- olutian\" from the Renaissance does not ob» score the glaring fact that the religion with which it came into conﬂict was already past its prime, atrophied, and sterile Even though it possessed strong political and social pre-\n\n[Page 31] togatives, religion had long since assumed a position as champion of the Status quo, a dis- believer in the possibility of genuine social evolution and progress in this life. No wonder that \"religion\" seems to have been so much on the defensive and so easy an adversary to discredit in the eyes of thinking men. Such men simply had no example of a religion which was a dynamic, creative, evolutionary force There was nothing in their immediate experience, no analogy or example, which could easily allow them to view religion in any light other than that in which its rnosr volatile exponents chose to present it: a te- actiouary social force,\n\nBut the new science also suﬂ'eted from the decline of religion. Because man was socially and morally atrophied in so many respects. society tended to use science for prejudicial, unscientific, and irrational ends. Science tend» ed to become a tool to obtain desited (but net necessarily justified) social ends, rather than an attitude toward life as a whole which. from the Baha'i viewpoint. it should have been, Thus, we now see the specter of sci- entific achievements being used to deStroy nations, tender the eatth uninhabitable, elfect mass mutdet. disgorge a cornucopia of often useless gadgets. and even to balsa: dogmatic\n\nl.

Our the- ses are. quite simply: (1) that the basic unity of science lies in its method of inquiry or ep- istemology. and (2) that the Baha'i Faith (on— stiously accepts this epistemology as its 0W. accepting in its wake whatever tedefinitions of the terms \"religion\" and \"faith\" are con- sequent to in What, in the final analysis. is science any» way? To begin with. science is a collection of statements or aﬂirmations which are taken as truths about reality (or some portion there. of)‘| To say that a statement is true means that the sat: of affairs it afiirms to be the as: is, in fact, the case. To say that the state- ments of our science are \"taken\" as truths means that We deliberately include in science only statements which we have judged to be true as a result of a certain pmcesst2 We can thus see that science involves at least two as- pem, namely the process or method by which we judge statements to be mic, and the col- lection of Statements which tesults ftom this process. We will begin our discussion with a consideration of the (ollection of statements and then tum to a consideration of the pro— cess by which the collection is generated. The statements that comprise science (or any given scientific discipline) are subject to highly complex intetrelationships. These in- terrelationships serve to make some state- ments in the collection much more important than others. The two statements \"this paper is white\" and the highly pregnant “ =mt2” ate bath equally mu statements of physics.\n\n[Page 32] 32 womb ORDER: FALL I986/WINTER 1956-87\n\nbut these statements are not of equal impob tance. Let us try to make all of this a bit more precise,\n\nThe Murat! and [be Cantrete in Sriem'e THE STATEMENTS of science have two com- ponents, an experiential (or empirical) one and a logical or theoretical one. Statements may vary with regard to their empirical and the- oretital components, The theoretical compa- nent of a statement results in part from the use of abstract terms These are terms which tefet to entities at qualities not directly ac- cessible to human observation. \"Energy“ and \"mass\" are examples of absrtact terms while \"paper\" and \"white” are mimic terms, te- futing as they do ta observable entities and qualities,\n\nThe theoretical component of a statement also results from the relative complexity of the linguistic structuring of the statement and of the terms which occur in it. For example, terms such as \"velocity,\" “light.” “mass.\" and \"energy\" which otcut in the statement \"e= mez“ are complex when their mathematical definitions are spelled out.\n\nIn fact, the pregnant statement \"e=rn(2” has such a high theotedml component that it takes years of concentrated effort to assim- ilate its meaning. This statement is far re- moved from simple, direct physical obser- vations like the whiteness of paper. On the other hand, \"this paper is white\" has such a simple linguistic structure involving the use of concrete terms that its meaning might even be conveyed by the one word ”white\" accom- panied by appropriate gestures toward the physiml object in questions It is inconceivable to think ofconveying the meaning of a highly theoretical statement in this manner.\n\nOf course, even a statement like “this pa- pet is white\" has 1m: theoretical content It involves abstractions which are net innately given to us and which develop in normal children only after several yeats of life expe- rience. Also, a highly theoretical statement has some empirical component. When all of the abstmctions and definitions hidden in ”e=\n\nme” are spelled out. the result will be an affirmation which says something about hu— man experience on some levell We should thus be careful to view the experiential and the- otetitnl components of statements as being a matter of degree,\n\nA statement with a high empirical com- ponent and a low theoretical component tor- tesponds to the popular notion of a \"fact.\"\n\nTb: Implication Relation\n\nbetween Statement:\n\nOl-TIEN, but not always, the important state- meats of science are statements with a high theoretical component, However, what makes a statement important is net only its internal structure and meaning, but its relationship to other statements. The basic relationship be- tween Statements is that ol' \"implication.“ which means that if (ertain statements are admitted as ttue, than certain other state- ments must also be admitted as true, these latter being \"logically implied\" by the for- mer. The nature of the netessiry (the \"must\") involved in impliation has received detailed analysis. Avoiding such details as being be- yond the scope of this article, let us say that the necessity results primarily from the way in which we use words. To take a traditional example, we say that the two statements \"all men are mortal\" and \"Soetates is a man\" to- gethet imply that \"Socrates is mortal.\" We mean by this that the very signification of the first two statements is such that the last state» meat is true if the first two are, Another way of expressing this would be to say that the single statement \"if all men are mortal and if Socrates is a man. then Socrates is mortal\" is Iagimlly valid This Statement has a sort ofgeneral form: \"Ifall A is B and ifX is an A, then X is a B.\" We would call this a Iag~ icnlly mzlidﬂmn meaning that no matter what names we might subsritute for A, B, and X in the form. the resulting sentence would turn am to be true. For example. we would accept as true the statement \"if all dogs are cats, and if Descartes is a dog. then Descartes is a cat.\" Notice. dogs ate not cats, and Descartes is neither a dog not a cat. but rather what the\n\n[Page 33] statement asserts is that if certain conditions are fulfilled, then certain other conditions fol~ low, and this total statement is true. The truth of this whole statement. then, depends essentially an the way we use words like \"if. . . , then . . . .\" \"and.\" etc. The structure of a sentence in terms of these and athet such logical wmi: determines whethet or not a sentence has a logically valid form.\n\nBeyond this cursory analysis, we will have to trust the reader‘s intuitive understanding of the nation that a statement or statements may logically imply another statement (or statements).\n\nNow, the complex interrelationships be- tween the statements of a science result pte- eisely from the fact that the truth of a given statement may logically imply (he truth of ether statements. A given statement is thus rdated to many Other statements, both state- ments which the given statement implies‘ and statements by which the given statement is implied. The totality of this relationship de- termines the “position\" or \"impottance\" of the statement in the total contexr of science,\n\nWe might try to define the weight of a\n\n5.

The first concerns the way we have treated the individual statement as if it were an independent, meaning-beating entity. Ae- tually this is an oversimplificationi A state» ment, just like a woxd or phrase. depends on the (c(il context of its usage for its complete meaning. It is wrung to think of a statement as having a meaning in isolation from the context of its usage and its relationship to other statema'its.\n\nThe second point concerns the relationship between the statements of out science and the given phenomenon they seek to describe. It hes become increasingly clear from observa- tion of the practice of science rhar this rela- tionship is often mediated via certain abstract structures 0! model], A model is an image or chart which we have conceived with our minds and whose structure reﬂects in part the way we expect the world (or that portion of the wotld which constitutes the phenomenon being investigated) to behave.’ We say that the model is abrtmrml fmm reality and that the phenomenon in question is an interpre- lalian 0f the modeli To say that such a model is abstract means. among other things, that it does not attempt to capture all of the phe- nomenon as we experiente it.6 Whenever a model is involved in our study of a phenom~ enon, some of the Statements of our science will be directly true nor of reality but of the model. They become true of reality only when (and if) the model is properly interpreted in the phenomenon. Thus, whereas a given\n\n[Page 34] )4 WORLD ORDER. FALL |986/WXNTER [986—87\n\nstatement true of a model always remains so, it can be variously true or false of reality de- pending an the way the model is interpret- ed,7 Of course, relative to any model and/ot any interpretation of that model. a given statement will be either true or false and not both. A given science may be conveniently thought of as the statements whidi make it up plus the made] (or models) of reality they describe, but we do not insist on this as a comprehensive definition.\n\nAs sketchy as this analysis admittedly is, we have gorten some idea of why some Statce ments of a science are much more impottant than others, Generally speaking, statements with a high theoretical component and state merits with high weight are mote impottant than statements with a low theoretical com- ponent and with low weight. (Nothing ex» dudes the possibility that a statement could have a low theoretical component and still have high weight)\n\nAlthough it may seem surprising at first, it is quite possible for one statement to imply another statement without out being aware of itt This means that we actually discover te- lationships of implication by a process of ex- amining the logical connections between Srilemcnts. It also means that. contrary to popular conception, observation and expeti- rnentation ate not the only processes involved in discovering scientific truth. We often dis- covet new truths by discovering that a pte- viously doubtful statement is implied by some of out known and accepted truths Often this discavety takes place not as a result of any direct at immediate observation of the world but as a result of out intuition and subse- quent ptoof of the existence of a relationship of implication.\n\nIt follows that it is wrong to consider that\n\n7. Thus l+l=2 is eternally true of adding num- bets (our model). It is list) true of teality if we in- tetpret adding at \"physimlly putting together\" and the numbers as counting. say. stones or apples, but false if we intetpret the numbers as taunting piles of sand at dtops of watet (while keeping the same interplztution of adding).\n\nscience is a “collection of facts.\" though this is a frequently expressed populat view, We have alteady nated that \"factual\" statements are simply statements with a low theatetical component and these comprise only part of out scientific statements, and sometimes the least important part.\n\nThe Relativity of Knowledge WE CAN also see from out preceding analysis that scientific knowledge is relative Scientific inquiry brings into play a host of human fa» culties such as reason, intuition. and experi» ante. and these on different levels of pro- fundity and objectivity One mnnot, however, explain in any simple mannet the way in which these faculties interacr to produce a given statement of science. The statements of science are arrived M by a process of tepeatecl application of these human facilities, and by many diﬂ'etent human beings Yeats of ex— perimentation (otganized expetience), theo- tizing (conscious teamning and intuition). and discussion lie behind the one statement \"e= mcz.”\n\nIt would be a mistake to say that we hold such a statement to be true brawn of reason. at Lemme of intuition, or Lemme of experi- ence, In the final analysis. we hold something as true only because of everything else we ac- cept as true—that is, because this something is consistent with out experience and under- standing of life as a whole, No statement can be held absolutely to be true, for no state ment is independent of Other statements and facts that may come to out attention at some future date Not is it independent of the meaning of athet statements, a meaning that may be altered either by subtle shifts in the way we use wotds or by a change in explicit conventions and definitions. A combination of such [actots can result in a change in the implication relation and thus a change in the truth value of some statements. Out knowl- edge, then, is telative. It is relative not only to time but to the whole body of out present knowledge, which fotms the context in which the statement has meaning in the first plate,\n\nIn short, no scientific statement an ever\n\n[Page 35] be held to be immune fmm possible revision, forever beyond the possibility of modifica- tion. Insufficient appreciation by logical pos- itivism of this fact has been one cause of the lack of acceptance by the scientific commu- nity of this pseudo-epistemnlogy. A classic example is the case of Newton's laws of me~ chanits and his theory of gravitation, which were in fact considerably modified in later centuties. One of the confirmations of the modificanon came as a result of experiences (experiments with subatomic particles) which Newton could not possibly have induced in his lifetime This simple but dramatic ex- ample should serve us an object lesson to any- one disinclined to take seriously the relative nature of scientific knowledge which we have desctibed above\n\nBecause statements have matting only in the total contexr of their usage. thete is a tes- idue of subjectivity inherent in any smte- ment. Though pans of the total cantext of science may involve highly articulated objee- tifimtions, the ultimate mats of understand- ing ate always collective human subjectivity and so there is always \"room for argumenti\" Total objectivity is not possible Suppose, for example, that we try to eliminate the sub- jective dement of the notion ”ted\" by agree- ing that the term shall be applied only to those objects giving a reading of thus-and-so on a spectrosccpe. Once this agreement is made, we may still argue sometimes about whether or not the needle really is quite on thus-and-so, and the unbelievet will go away saying that the definition was all wrong in the fitst place.\n\nOut analysis of the nature of science and scientific statements has allowed us to appre- ciate several aspects of scientific knowledge. We have seen that science is much mote than a \"collection of facrs\" or an amassing of fat- tual statements. We have seen that scientific knowledge is relative. And we have seen that total obiectivity is impossible since man, the subject, is after all the developer of science.\n\nKnowledge. in short, is human knowledge, because it is human beings who ate the knowets. All of our discussion should be\n\nSCIENCE AND RELIGION is\n\nunderstood with this in mind, I emphasize this seemingly trivial point here, because fail— ute to understand it often leads to some un- fortunate emotional reactions to the Otherwise clear points which we have summarized above. Some people feel that to assert that knowl- edge is rooted in human subjectivity or that knowledge is relative is to argue that the world “out there\" is unreal or perhaps a figment of out imagination. Thete is, however, no such implication. Nothing we have said implies that thete is no reality which operates inde- pendently of out will and out subjeaivity, We have pointed out only that out understanding of this objective teality (whatever it ulti- mately turns out to be) is relative because out relationship to it is relative.\n\nTb: Prater: of Knowledge \"BUT How.\" one might ask. \"does a state- ment come to be accepted as true in view of this incredibly complex situation you have sketched out for us?\" Let us say that same» thing like me fnllawing is involved' our subr jectivity is bombarded with Stimuli. In otdet ta make sense out of this experience, we be- gin to make certain simplifying assumptions. These assumptions, if they are made uncon- sciously and without reﬂection. become em~ bodied in what we call \"common sense‘\" The child \"knows\" that getting hit by a cat will hurt, because he has fallen clown before and experienced the efl’eCts of sudden acceleration. This is clearly a learned and nut an innate response. But the child cannot articulate any principles of acceleration 0t velocity and \"prove\" that he will be hurt.\n\nNow if. on the othet hand, out simplifying assumptions are made explicitly and con- sciously (or if we make explicit those as- sumptions which were previously uncon- scious), then we have the beginnings of sci- ence We continue to build the science by ex- amining the logical relations between our assumptions and their consequences (math- emstiu. theorizing) and testing our assump» tions (experimentation. ie, the willful bring» ing about of experience). This leads us ulti» mately to a well-otganized \"body of knowl—\n\n[Page 36] 56 wonu) ORDER FALL Isss/WINTER 1986—87\n\ntdge\" whith describes a model of reality. or a portion theteof. The collection of state- ments which make up this body of knowl» edge are the statements of our science As we have already stressed. this body of knowledge and the model (or models) it describes will be continually tevised in the light of new ex- periences, new assumptions, and newly dis- covered logical relationships.\n\nSimply put, it is the conscious, explicit or- ganization of knowledge that makes it sci- entific, Science is organized knowledge, Or, to paraphrase the words of W. V. Quine, “sci- ence is common sense whidi has become self- conscious)\"i When we begin to organize out experience (experimentation). rather than simply profiting from fortuitous experiences, to direct out reasoning (mathematis and log- ic). rather than being satisfied with common- sense deduction, and to ttain our intuition (reﬂection and meditation). rather than te» lying on occasional ﬂashes of insight—then we are engaging in scientific inquiry as op- pused to common sense at unscientific (at. perhaps, ptescientific) inquiry.\n\nNotice that it is this conscious ditecrion and otganization of out inquiry which alone enables us to generate truths of high weight— that is. important statements Science is not just a matter of discovering ttue statements. {or every human being knows an unbounded number of trivially true statements: grass is gteen, fite burns, etc In sum, human thought is bound to go on in any case, and human thaught is bound to evolve (change as a func- tion of time» Sci"
