        "text": "Capricorns born on January 17 have incredible physical and emotional endurance and grasp the correlation between mental and physical energy. They trust their intuition more than their intellect. They continually put themselves \"out there\" to prove their abilities are undiminished.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriends and Lovers\n\nDespite their conservatism, January 17 people have an odd collection of friends. They enjoy looking outside of their realm of experience to find people who can show them life-lessons they may not otherwise learn. Romance is often unfulfilling; they demand loyalty, holding lovers to almost impossible standards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChildren and Family\n\nPeople born on this date may keep their feelings regarding their family a secret. Episodes from their childhood often become the building blocks of opportunity. They have a tendency to overindulge their youngsters to make up for what they did not have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHealth\n\nKeeping healthy is not just a matter of common sense for the people born on this date -- it's a spiritual quest. They want to be at the peak of conditioning, believing it affects every area of life, not only the physical aspects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCareer and Finances\n\nJanuary 17 people are career-oriented and often begin to plan professional goals when they are children. Secretly and systemically, they may spend years bending every effort toward a final goal. Money rarely plays a part in career choices for these people, but they have considerable ability to handle financial affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDreams and Goals\n\nJanuary 17 people need to adopt goals that help them deal with their desires. Understanding there is not just one path their life can take helps them deal more successfully with the possibility of failure. Once they achieve balance in their personal and professional lives, they are more likely to feel good about themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information about astrology, see:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nJill M.
