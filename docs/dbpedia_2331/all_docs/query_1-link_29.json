        "text": "Arianna Foster, known to a small but devoted legion of fans and followers as Ari Up, died last week at the age of 48. That she will forever be associated with a song called \"Typical Girls\" is irony at its most piquant. Over the course of her 34-year career, Up was anything but-- she was a ferocious, idiosyncratic, spirited, joyful force-of-nature who rewrote punk rock according to her own fantastically skewed rule book.\n\nHer career was atypical from the outset. Born into a well-to-do family in Munich, Germany-- her grandfather was the publisher of the German weekly Der Spiegel-- Up was raised in London under the more bohemian influence of her mother Nora, a band promoter and close friend of several prominent 1970s rock stars (\"I grew up with people like Jimi Hendrix walking through the living room,\" Up told Spin in an interview in 2009). She learned to play guitar from Joe Strummer and formed the Slits with drummer Paloma Romero-- quickly rechristened Palmolive-- when she was 14 years old.\n\nEven in its earliest stages, the group seemed hellbent on raising amateurism to high art. In his book Rip It Up and Start Again, Simon Reynolds describes their first shows as, \"Genuinely inept... The Slits really sounded cacophonous, with only the faintest subliminal skank indicating their punky-reggae intention.\" Indeed, the live compilation In the Beginning, recorded largely in 1977, finds them to be all jubilant white noise, sewn up by Up's piercing, animalistic shriek. Rocketing out of the gate with the two-fisted brawler \"Vindictive\", the group crashed, kicked and careened through their songs. They barely stayed in time, never mind on-key. It's sloppy, sure, but it's also breathtaking, rock distilled to a smoldering husk of volume and velocity. Before \"Slime\", complaining about a faulty monitor, Up can be heard howling a phrase that could have served as her mantra: \"I want to hear myself!\"\n\nOn stage, the group cut an imposing image: In Don Letts' 1978 film The Punk Rock Movie From England, Up is seen towering sky-high, all limbs and angles topped by a shock of black hair that she'd eventually grow into Medusa-like dreadlocks. She rocks back and forth ominously before crouching like a panther on the lip of the stage. Her cut-up fashion aesthetic, a combination of thrift store glamour and ripped-punk recklessness, would be mimicked-- knowingly or otherwise-- by everyone from Debbie Harry to Madonna. The group was invited to open for the Clash on their 1977 White Riot Tour, which resulted in them getting booed and pelted with garbage by a audience less-than-receptive to the group's wild, anarchic and proudly unpracticed approach. During one notorious gig in the mid 70s, Up squatted down in the center of the stage and urinated. Everything about them seemed specifically engineered to unnerve and to upend, a quartet of ferocious girls hellbent on setting fire to anything that got in their way.\n\nCelebrated reggae producer Dennis Bovell softened the group's approach significantly for their justifiably legendary 1979 debut, Cut, but what results is just as fascinating. Instead of big, blocky chords, guitarist Viv Albertine offers just a few chicken scratch riffs as Up pouts and hiccups and unleashes wild, womanly screams in the middle. It's a small miracle: Bovell managed to somehow clean up the group's sound (compare the version of \"Shoplifting\" on In the Beginning to the one on Cut, and it's hard to believe they're even the same song) without sacrificing their essence. \"Love and Romance\", which opens with Up sneering \"Babylon lovers! Babylon lovers,\" tumbles ass-over-teacup to its conclusion, Up affecting a dizzying array of voices and personalities whole decades before the arrival of Nicki Minaj; you can hear the entirety of early-90s D.C. indie rock being born in the twitching apostrophes of guitar that open \"Typical Girls\".\n\nUsing clattering, rickety, and often willfully atonal music as a method of confrontation is no novel idea, but Up's coy trick was constructing the Slits' songs so that they faked at the conventions of actual songwriting. They were close enough to traditional song structures to force an audience to try to make of sense of them, but were also wild and feral enough to prevent any kind of easy decoding. They were unfiltered missives from the deep subconscious, more sound than song. The Slits were loved by their punk peers-- the famously cantankerous Johnny Rotten, who, in a strange twist of fate, would end up being Up's stepfather, would say that the Slits were one of the only bands in the punk scene he could stand.\n\nRock history to that point had seen only a handful of strong, fiery, combative frontwomen, but what made Up even more remarkable was the way she was able to use her outrageousness and eccentricity as a vehicle to speak for those society had shoved to the margins. When I interviewed her in 2005 for a piece for Magnet, Up told me, \"What the Slits embarked on was to oppose all forms of segregation,\" and, indeed, her entire persona acted out in violent opposition to that isolationism-- resisting societal colonization by shoving the outcasts, with all of their tics, freakishness, and, yes, imperfections into the mainstream. That the Slits could barely play was the whole point: the more erratic Up was on stage, the more off-key her singing, the more unbridled her dancing, the \"crazier\" she behaved, the more pronounced her mission became. \"I have empathy for the underdog,\" she told the New Jersey newspaper Aquarian in an interview last year, \"whether societal, political, or money-wise.\"\n\nWhich says nothing of her deliberate assault on conventional depictions of women. For all its political posturing and feints toward social consciousness, the punk scene of the late 70s was still something of a boys' club, an anti-movement that, however subconsciously, adhered to the usual calcified gender roles. Up and the Slits detonated that, displaying a fierce and restless femininity that was brash, tough, caustic, commanding, and proudly undomesticated (indeed, the stuffy male voice in \"Love and Romance\" is heard haughtily romanticizing, \"We can get married and have a house in the country\"). The famously-controversial cover of Cut, which featured Up, Albertine, and bassist Tessa Pollitt naked and caked in mud, didn't scan as pornographic so much as political, an unabashed presentation of the female form, blown-up record-sleeve size, and just as revolutionary and potent than the image of Paul Simonon smashing his bass on the cover of London Calling. In Reynolds' book, Up says, \"We decided to cover ourselves in mud and show that women could be sexy without dressing in a prescribed way.\"\n\nShe also embodied the idea that popular culture was not something to be acquiesced to, but something to be questioned and something to be fought. In the group's song about the radio, \"FM\", Up redeploys those two letters to stand for \"frequent mutilation.\" \"Spend, Spend, Spend\" takes dead aim on consumer culture and \"Shoplifting\", with its triumphant chorus of \"Ten quid for the lot?/ We pay fuck all\" feels like a forerunner to M.I.A.'s \"What can I get for 10 dollar?/ Anything you want.\"\n\nIndeed, it's not hard to see similarities between Up and M.I.A. in general: Both utilize aggressive image-consciousness, harsh, sometimes abrasive, music, and stubborn political posturing to call attention to those occupying society's fringes. Both also evince a passion and voraciousness for music that falls outside the white, Western pop canon. Though their debut was reggae in a broad sense, the Slits' 1981 follow-up, Return of the Giant Slits, seemed to swallow the music of Jamaica and Africa whole. With only a slight reconfiguring, the weird, rubbery \"Earthbeat\" could have been on Kala: it's a bizarre fusion of dub and traditional Chinese music, one that find Up, using a hushed tone of voice that seems to dream up Björk whole cloth, raking over a ruined planet. The album was poorly received, seen as sacrificing the ragged charm of Cut, and the group disbanded. Up spent some time fronting the even-dubbier New Age Steppers before, as she described it, leaving to live naked with her husband among the indigenous tribes in the jungles of Belize and Indonesia.\n\nA version of the Slits relaunched in 2006 but their comeback would have felt more fitting a decade earlier, with the onset of the riot grrrl movement. The off-kilter tempos, ragged guitars, and impassioned vocals of bands like Bikini Kill and Sleater-Kinney felt directly inspired by Up. \"The Slits were mythic to me as a young punk,\" says Molly Neuman, drummer for Bratmobile and the Frumpies and co-founder of the legendary 'zine Girl Germs. \"Their records were impossible to find, so I only had their songs on mix tapes. I used to play them whenever I was at friends' houses who had them. The rhythms, the riffs, the lyrics and the vocals have the same power for me now that they did then.\" The movement's ferocity and acceptance-or-else ideology is a clear antecedent to Up's antic idiosyncracies. Listen to Cut back-to-back with Pussy Whipped or The Hot Rock and try to figure out which one came out first.\n\nThat later iteration of the Slits, which featured Up, Pollitt, and a number of hired hands, put out one album, the alarmingly polished electro-reggae Trapped Animal and turned in a number of typically-- and, often, charmingly-- disorganized and sloppy live shows. There was disappointed chatter surrounding their string of shows at South By Southwest in 2008, but much of it seemed built on the notion that Ari Up, three decades on, would somehow abandon her teenage recklessness and, to put it bluntly, \"behave.\" That she didn't is a better tribute than anyone could possibly compose. Erratic as ever, Ari Up remained to the end who she always was: a boisterous outsider-- proudly, noisily atypical."
