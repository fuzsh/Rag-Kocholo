        "text": "Ari Up – born Arianna Forster in Germany – was a founder member of the all-girl punk-reggae band The Slits.\n\nShe died on Wednesday from “a serious illness”. Her death was announced on Lydon’s website.\n\nIt is thought the 48-year-old, who had three sons, died from cancer.\n\nWIN A LUXURY LONG WEEKEND FOR TWO IN CAIRO!!! INCLUDES BA CLUB CLASS FLIGHTS, FIVE STAR ACCOMMODATION AND £1,000 SPENDING MONEY!\n\nShe had formed the band with Paloma Romero, otherwise known as Palmolive, and Viv Albertine.\n\nThey were best known for tracks such as Typical Girls and I Heard It Through The Grapevine.\n\nThe cover of their debut album in 1979, on which the band appeared topless and smeared with mud, became an enduring punk image.\n\nLydon, 54, who appeared on I’m A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! is married to Up’s mother Nora Forster, a German publishing heiress. They have been together for 30 years. Announcing the death on Johnlydon.com, a statement reads: “John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora’s daughter Arianna (aka Ari Up) died today after a serious illness.\n\n“She will be sadly missed.”"
