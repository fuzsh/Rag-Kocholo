        "text": "Age requirements vary depending on the path you choose:\n\nTo join the Air Force as an enlisted Airman, you must be between the ages of 17 and have not reached your 42nd birthday.\n\nTo join as a healthcare or ministry professional, you must be between 17 and 48 years of age.\n\nThe Air Force maintains height and weight requirements to ensure our Airmen are physically capable of carrying out their tasks. These vary slightly depending on your desired position.\n\nWe utilize a Body Mass Index (BMI) range of 17.5 to 27.5 to determine height-to-weight ratio for body composition. When a recruit is outside of this BMI range, recruiters will use a body fat measurement (BFM) with a maximum range of 26% for males and 36% for females.\n\nENLISTED:\n\nAll female applicants must be a minimum of six months postpartum to be eligible for enlistment.\n\nPlease check with your local recruiter for specific eligibility requirements regarding applicants with dependents.\n\nOFFICER:\n\nPregnant applicants are authorized to apply but must obtain a qualifying commissioning physical within 14.5 months postpartum before OTS scheduling.\n\nPlease check with your local recruiter for specific eligibility requirements regarding applicants with dependents.\n\nIf you wish to enlist as a non-citizen in the Air Force, you must be a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) with a valid Permanent Resident Card (INS Form I-551), commonly known as a “Green Card.” LPRs are immigrants admitted for permanent residence to live and work in the United States. The requirements for being an officer are a little more strict, and you must be a native-born or naturalized United States citizen.\n\nU.S. Residency Requirements\n\nEnlistment into the Air Force by non-U.S. citizens is limited to foreign nationals who are legally residing in the United States as a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). LPRs must possess a valid Permanent Resident Card (INS Form I-551), or “Green Card,” for two years (conditional) or 10 years (without conditions) and have at least six months or more remaining before expiration. Applicants must be between 17 and 42; meet the mental, moral and physical standards for enlistment; and speak, read and write English fluently.\n\nBecoming a U.S. Citizen\n\nAs a member of the Air Force, Lawful Permanent Residents may qualify for naturalization based on military service. Speak to your local recruiter to learn more about opportunities to become a U.S. citizen through military service.\n\nThere are multiple ways to become eligible for a career in the U.S. Air Force. You can enlist with a high school diploma, a GED, or 15 college semester hours.\n\nThe minimum Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) score for entrance depends on your current education level and ranges from 31 to 65. Alternatively, if you do not possess any of the education requirements you may enter with a minimum score of 65 on the ASVAB.\n\nHigh school seniors may start the enlistment process with a statement from their school showing that they have or will have enough acceptable credits to receive their high school diploma.\n\nUpon applying, all Air Force applicants must complete the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) entrance exam.\n\nTo join as an officer, you must have a four-year college degree or be within 365 days of attaining your bachelor’s degree when you apply. If you plan to attend college or are already in college and are looking for financial assistance, the Air Force can help.\n\nOfficer candidates are not required to take the ASVAB, but most must pass the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT). Similar to the SAT, this is in a multiple-choice format and covers topics ranging from verbal and math skills to pilot and navigation aptitude for those interested in flying. Scores are reported as percentiles ranging from 1 to 99."
