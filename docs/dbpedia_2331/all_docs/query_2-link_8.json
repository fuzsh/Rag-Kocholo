        "text": "While Baby New Year gets a lot of attention this month, all January babies are pretty special. If your little one is born in January, research suggests theyâ€™ve got a lot of working in their favor. Studies show that being born early in the year could be an advantage in school, sports, or in their careers! Keep reading to learn more about your January babyâ€™s birth month. ðŸŽ‰\n\nJanuary babiesâ€™ horoscope sign is Capricorn or Aquarius.\n\nIf your baby is born before January 20th theyâ€™ll be a Capricorn. January babies who make their debut January 20th or later will fall under Aquarius. (Read up on traits for every astrological sign!)\n\nMore About Your January Babyâ€™s Capricorn Zodiac Sign\n\nNeed a job done? Hand it to a Capricorn! This tenacious sign is represented by the goatâ€”an expert climber. Thatâ€™s because Capricorns are thought to be hard-working, ambitious, and practical. On the flip side, their discipline can sometimes lead them to lose themselves in their work (so make sure your Cap baby gets plenty of play, too!).\n\nMore About Your January Babyâ€™s Aquarius Zodiac Sign\n\nAquarian babies are thought to be intelligent, quirky, and independent. Though this sign is represented by the water-bearer, Aquarius is actually an air sign (as an element, air represents the mind, which explains why Aquarians tend to be curious and communicative). This free-spirited sign marches to the beat of its own drum (this may come through when they start mixing and matching their own outfits during the preschool yearsâ€”spots and stripes and florals, anyone?), but they still care deeply about community. (Check out nursery inspo for every zodiac sign!)\n\nJanuary babies have a fiery birthstone.\n\nWhile their birth month is all things snow and ice, January babiesâ€™ birthstone, the garnet, is a deep, fiery red. This stone is said to symbolize friendship and trust (two traits that hopefully your baby will inherit, too!). It doesnâ€™t hurt that garnets look fab with both silver and gold (in case you were planning on treating yourself to birthstone jewelry). Learn more about baby birthstones!\n\nJanuary babies have two flowers.\n\nBoth the carnation and snowdrop are considered January birth flowers. The delicate, white snowdropâ€”one of the first buds to poke its petals through the ground in the springâ€”seems like an apt pick for January. And carnations are a bright spot in an otherwise dreary time of year.\n\nJanuary babies may be fame-bound.\n\nIs Hollywood calling? Maybe! A small study found that more celebrities were born during Aquarius season than under other astrological signs. As proof, look no further thanâ€¦\n\nJanuary babies share a birth month with these celebs.\n\nYour little rising star will be in good company. A-listers born in January include mega-stars Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, Justin Timberlake, Bradley Cooper, Florence Pugh, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Mary J. Blige, Issa Rae, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Regina King, Dolly Parton, Alicia Keys, and Kerry Washington!\n\nJanuary babies may have a leg up on the sports field (or ice rink).\n\nIs it time to sign up for pee-wee soccer? Researchers in Australia found that there were 33% more January babies than expected playing in the Australian Football League. The studyâ€™s authors say these findings are consistent with other studies that have found a connection between babies born at the beginning of the year and the likelihood of becoming a professional athlete. In fact, another study found that 36% of the hockey players drafted by the NHL between 1980 and 2007 were born between January and March.\n\nJanuary babies have leadership potential.\n\nThat corner office is within reach of your babyâ€™s chubby little hands! Research published in the journal Economic Letters found that January is one of the top five CEO-producing months (March, April, November, and October are the other four).\n\nJanuary babies could be on the path to their MD.\n\nPaging Dr. January! The most common careers for January babies were general practitioner and debt collector, according to one British study that looked at the correlation between birth month and profession. (In other words, get your little one a toy stethoscope, stat!) Conversely, January babies tend not to pursue careers in real estate.\n\nJanuary babies are pretty chill.\n\nThe weather of their birth month isnâ€™t the only thing thatâ€™s cool! Babies born in winter months are less irritable than people born in other seasons, according to a European study. (That bodes well for the toddler years, doesnâ€™t it?)\n\nJanuary birthdays are super special.\n\nDespite the star power January has, chances are your little January babe wonâ€™t share a birthday with too many classmates. Only one January birthday lands among the top 200 most popular birthdaysâ€¦and thatâ€™s January 24th all the way down in spot 199! And January holds one of the rarest birthdays of all: January 1st, which falls in the 365th spot (itâ€™s safe to assume that not too many folks want to ring in the new year with a scheduled c-section or induction!).\n\nDid your January baby arrive early or late?\n\nFascinating Facts About December Babies\n\nFascinating Facts About February Babies\n\nSee All Birthday Month Facts\n\nView more posts tagged, birthday\n\nDisclaimer: The information on our site is NOT medical advice for any specific person or condition.
