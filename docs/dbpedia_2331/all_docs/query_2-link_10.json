It is also a reference to John Lasseter's birthday.\n\nRiley Andersen - January 22\n\nHer username when she video-chats with Meg is \"Riley0122\", meaning January 22. She also shares a birthday with Elie Docter, daughter of director Pete Docter, and whom the character of Riley is based off of.\n\nEbenezer Scrooge - February 7\n\nAlthough his birthday is not known in The Muppet Christmas Carol, it is shown on his tombstone in the 2009 version.\n\nIvan Vanko - February 7\n\nRevealed in his files in Iron Man 2.\n\nShort Round - February 8\n\nMentioned in the 2008 reference book Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide.\n\nSharon Davis - February 24\n\nRevealed in We Interrupt This Program.\n\nFerb Fletcher - February 29\n\nConfirmed by Dan Povenmire on Twitter.[1]\n\nLuther Waffles - February 29\n\nAs revealed in the episode \"Luther Turns Four\", Luther was born on a Leap Year day. While he is 16 in terms of age, he is technically 4 due to his actual birth date occurring every fourth year.\n\nTodd Davis - March 1\n\nRevealed in We Interrupt This Program.\n\nMirabel Madrigal - March 6\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[2]\n\nMarc Spector - March 9\n\nSeen on his passport in Moon Knight: Summon the Suit.\n\nBucky Barnes - March 10\n\nRevealed in his S.H.I.E.L.D. File on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled Blu-ray and on his memorial in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.\n\nHelena Shaw - March 12\n\nRevealed in her file in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.\n\nGiulia Marcovaldo - March 18\n\nConfirmed by Enrico Casarosa on Twitter.[3]\n\nGretchen Grundler - March 23\n\nMentioned in the episode \"Outcast Ashley\".\n\nMarion Ravenwood - March 23\n\nMentioned in the 2008 reference book Indiana Jones: The Ultimate Guide.\n\nMaria Hill - April 4\n\nRevealed on her S.H.I.E.L.D. badge in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Pilot.\n\nPeggy Carter - April 9\n\nMentioned in her S.H.I.E.L.D. File on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled Blu-ray and a newspaper article about her death in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Emancipation.\n\nHuey, Dewey, and Louie - April 15\n\nThis is revealed in the 2017 DuckTales episode \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\" and corresponds with the release date of their animated debut, Donald's Nephews. This, however, contradicts the 1953 comic story \"Donald Duck in Panama\" (originally printed in Walt Disney's Vacation Parade #4), in which they stated that they were Leos (which is associated with the period between July 23 and August 22).\n\nJohn Carteret - April 22[4]\n\nKermit the Frog - May 9\n\nWhile it is common knowledge that Kermit was born in a swamp, the precise date of his birth was largely uncertain, with different months and days specified over the years prior to his 50th anniversary in 2005, when the issue of assigning a specific date resurfaced. A National Public Radio Morning Edition report, broadcast on May 9, claimed that Kermit was born on that day; the actual broadcast focused on Kermit's \"birth\" as a puppet creation as opposed to an actual celebrity, and chose May 9 since that was the date Sam and Friends debuted. The May 9 date cropped up again in a Ford press release promoting the debut of Kermit's Ford commercial during the Super Bowl on February 6, 2006; it included a biography of Kermit, which stated his birth date as May 9, 1955. The Muppets 2008 Day-at-a-Time Calendar also states Kermit's birthday as May 9. Incidentally, in episode 106 of The Muppet Show, Kermit mentions that he is a Taurus, giving credence to May 9 as Kermit's birthday.\n\nWhitney Frost - May 9\n\nRevealed in Agent Carter: Better Angels.\n\nTyler Nguyen-Baker - May 17\n\nBefore confirming that the concert was on May 25, Mei and her friends were celebrating that the concert was the day after Tyler's birthday — May 18 specifically.\n\nAntonio Madrigal - May 21\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[5]\n\nGoofy - May 25\n\nConfirmed by Disney D23's Twitter account.[6]\n\nTony Stark - May 29\n\nRevealed in his S.H.I.E.L.D. File in The Avengers\n\nNeil Flores - June 3\n\nRevealed in the episode \"Bridge Over Troubled Daughter\".\n\nDonald Duck (and Della Duck) - June 9\n\nDonald's birthday occurs in The Three Caballeros, but it is stated to be happening on Friday the 13th, oddly not mentioning any particular month. This is also the case in the first two episodes of Legend of the Three Caballeros. The Disneyland episode \"The Donald Duck Story\" states that Donald was born on Friday the 13th of 1932, which would have been in May of that year, but the earlier cartoon short, Donald's Happy Birthday shows Donald's birthday being on March 13. However, later promotional material and comic stories, such as Don Rosa's \"The Duck Who Never Was\" instead give his birthday as June 9, the same day that The Wise Little Hen was originally released in 1934. According to Dave Smith's book Disney Trivia from the Vault, it was changed to June 9 to be consistent with Mickey's birthday being the date his debut cartoon was originally released.\n\nLogically, since Della Duck is sometimes depicted as being Donald's twin sister, the two would share the same birthday in whichever specific media Della is depicted as Donald's twin. However, unlike Donald, her official birthdate (June 9 or otherwise) has never been formally recognized by Disney, making it only-implied-yet-all-but-confirmed in such cases.\n\nMichelle Jones - June 10\n\nRevealed on her passport in Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nVanessa Doofenshmirtz - June 15\n\nRevealed in the episode \"Dude, We're Getting the Band Back Together\".\n\nAgustín Madrigal - June 19\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[7]\n\nAnna - June 21\n\nConfirmed by Jennifer Lee on Twitter.[8]\n\nIndiana Jones - July 1\n\nRevealed in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles.\n\nDaisy Louise Johnson - July 2\n\nRevealed in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Melinda.\n\nSteve Rogers - July 4\n\nRevealed in his denied Enlistment Form in Captain America: The First Avenger and in his file from a deleted scene of The Avengers\n\nNick Fury - July 4\n\nShown in his S.H.I.E.L.D. badge in Captain Marvel.\n\nPhil Coulson - July 8\n\nRevealed on his S.H.I.E.L.D. badge in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Pilot.\n\nCandace Flynn - July 11\n\nRevealed in the episode \"Candace Loses Her Head\".\n\nSoos Ramirez - July 13\n\nRevealed in the episode \"Blendin's Game\".\n\nRope Girl - July 18\n\nMentioned in the episode \"It's Crandall's Birthday - Bandit!\"\n\nCassie Lang - July 19\n\nRevealed in Ant-Man and Ant-Man and the Wasp.\n\nPony Head - August 4\n\nAs seen in the episode \"Bam Ui Pati!\"\n\nIsabela Madrigal - August 7\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[9]\n\nPeter Parker - August 10\n\nSeen on his passport in Spider-Man: Far From Home.\n\nHoward Stark - August 15\n\nSeen in his S.H.I.E.L.D. File on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled Blu-ray.\n\nLeo Fitz - August 19\n\nRevealed in a deleted scene of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Seeds and in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Inescapable.\n\nDoug Funnie - August 22\n\nShown on Doug's calendar in \"Doug's Last Birthday\". (It should be noted, though, that this conflicts with the episode \"Doug's Birthday Present\" from the original Nickelodeon series, in which it was stated that Doug's birthday occurred during the school year.)\n\nDipper and Mabel Pines - August 31\n\nAlex Hirsch confirmed that Dipper and Mabel's birthday coincides with the end of summer, thus putting their birthday around late August.[10] The date is given on a flier shown in \"Dipper and Mabel vs. the Future\". The series finale \"Weirdmageddon Part 3: Take Back the Falls\" has the twins celebrating their 13th birthday at the end.\n\nDolores Madrigal - August 31\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[11]\n\nPluto - September 5\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Toon Disney would run special \"Happy Birthday, Pluto!\" station IDs in commemoration of the day that Pluto's debut cartoon, The Chain Gang, was originally released in 1930.\n\nAbraham Erskine - September 14\n\nSeen in his S.H.I.E.L.D. File on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled Blu-ray.\n\nLaunchpad McQuack - September 18\n\nIn the 2017 DuckTales series, his birthday was shown on his driver's license in the episode \"Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!\" However, this contradicts him mentioning that he is an Aries in the original series episode \"A DuckTales Valentine\", possibly indicating that this does not apply to him in the original series.\n\nIan Lightfoot - September 18\n\nOn the calendar of his bedroom cork board, Ian's birthday is shown to be on the 18th of a month with 30 days, which fell on a Friday on his 16th birthday. Assuming the calendar, which lacks a named month, is similar to those in the real world, and that it is based on the calendar of the year Onward released (2020), then Ian's birthday is September 18th, as it is the only month in that year with 30 days and in which the 18th was a Friday. This is consistent with Dan Scanlon's claim that, although months in the film's universe are named differently than in the real world, it takes place early in the school year;[12] In the United States of America, high school typically begins in August or September.\n\nKing Ferdinand - September 23[13]\n\nHenry Pelham - September 25[14]\n\nAlberto Scorfano - September 25\n\nConfirmed by Enrico Casarosa on Twitter.[3]\n\nJames \"Rhodey\" Rhodes - October 6\n\nShown on his Department of Defense ID in Iron Man.\n\nPrincess Sofia - October 6\n\nConfirmed by Craig Gerber on Twitter.[15][16]\n\nWerner Reinhardt - October 9\n\nShown in his S.H.I.E.L.D. Person of Interest File in The Things We Bury.\n\nAlice Green - October 10\n\nShown on her driver's license in the episode \"Gramma's License\". Despite this, her birthday has been contradicted by Chris Houghton who said that collectively the Greens' zodiac sign is \"the fish one\".[citation needed]\n\nJulieta Madrigal, Pepa Madrigal, and Bruno Madrigal - October 17\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[17]\n\nEmma Swan - October 22\n\nStated in the \"Pilot\"\n\nKing George II - November 9[18]\n\nFélix Madrigal - November 11\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[19]\n\nLuisa Madrigal - November 14\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[20]\n\nFrancis David \"Frank\" Castle, Sr. - November 15\n\nRevealed in The Punisher: Kandahar.\n\nMickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse - November 18\n\nAlthough Mickey's birthday has always been linked with his public debut in Steamboat Willie, it was actually celebrated on different dates prior to the 1970s. Due to errors on the studio's early press releases, Mickey's fifth birthday was celebrated on September 30, 1933 (the day that the Film Pictorial magazine article that confirmed Mickey and Minnie's marriage was published), his seventh was celebrated on September 28, 1935, his tenth was celebrated on September 27, 1938, and his fortieth birthday was celebrated on October 28, 1968. Furthermore, his twentieth birthday was celebrated in 1947 and not 1948, to coincide with the release of Fun and Fancy Free. It wasn’t up until 1978, in preparation for Mickey's fiftieth anniversary, that Disney Archives founder Dave Smith officially confirmed that Steamboat Willie's original release date in 1928, and Mickey's official birthday, was November 18.\n\nDisney has officially stated November 18 is also Minnie Mouse's birthday, due to her having debuted alongside Mickey in Steamboat Willie. However, this doesn't seem to be the case in fiction, numerous productions that take place on Minnie's birthday do not mention it also being Mickey's birthday, and vice-versa. According to Disney.com's now-defunct \"frequently asked questions\" page, Mickey and Minnie's birthday and Donald's birthday are the only character birthdays that the company officially recognizes.[21]\n\nTinker Bell - November 19\n\nTinker Bell's arrival day is November 19, as evidenced by the Nintendo DS game of Tinker Bell. It appears that time passes differently in Pixie Hollow that it does on the Mainland. You can clearly see that the winter fairies are just returning home from the Mainland in groups a few hours after Tinker Bell's arrival. In the game, the starting date for Tinker Bell (though the player is supposed to put in his or her own birthday) is November 19 in the 1890s.\n\nLuca Paguro - November 20\n\nConfirmed by Enrico Casarosa on Twitter.[3]\n\nTarzan - November 22\n\nAccording to the books.\n\nJohann Fennhoff - November 27\n\nAccording to his file in Agent Carter: Valediction\n\nKronk - November 27[citation needed]\n\nHéctor - November 30\n\nConfirmed by Gael García Bernal on Twitter.[22]\n\nCol. Chester Phillips - December 3\n\nSeen in his S.H.I.E.L.D. File on the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled Blu-ray.\n\nNatasha Romanoff - December 3\n\nShown on her birth certificate in Black Widow.\n\nBruce Banner - December 18\n\nShown on his Culver University ID in The Incredible Hulk.\n\nElsa - December 22\n\nConfirmed by Jennifer Lee on Twitter.[8]\n\nCamilo Madrigal - December 28\n\nConfirmed by Jared Bush on Twitter.[23]\n\n[]\n\nZodiac signs[]\n\nThe following characters' birthdays have provided clues as to when their birthdays occur by mentioning their astrological signs in the zodiac.\n\nIn the 1953 comic \"Donald Duck in Panama\", Scrooge McDuck, checking his horoscope, mentions that he is a Gemini, which puts his birthday between May 21 and June 21.\n\nIn the Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers comic story \"Cobra Kadabra\", Snout mentions that he is a Pisces, which would put his birthday between February 19 and March 20.\n\nIn the Recess episode \"Outcast Ashley\", Ashley Quinlan states that she is a Leo, thus revealing that her birthday is between July 23 and August 22. In the same episode, Ashley Armbruster states that she is a Gemini, which indicates that her birthday is between May 21 and June 20.\n\nIn the Kim Possible episode \"The Ron Factor\", Ron mentions that he is a Virgo (\"Dude, I am Virgo, but what's your name?\"), which would put his birthday between August 23 and September 22. However, in the later \"Trading Faces\", he says \"I'm surprisingly nimble for an Aries,\" which would indicate his birthday is between March 21 and April 19.\n\nIn the American Dragon: Jake Long episode \"Shapeshifter\", Jake Long states that he is a Pisces, thus revealing his birthday is between February 19 and March 20.\n\nMajor Monogram mentions in the Phineas and Ferb episode \"Operation Crumb Cake\" that he is a Sagittarius, which would mean his birthday is between November 22 and December 21. However, this conflicts with his birthday being celebrated in the summer in \"Backyard Hodge Podge\" (see below).\n\nCraig Gerber mentioned that Princess Amber and Prince James were born in August under the zodiac sign Leo, putting their birthday between August 1 and August 22. He also mentioned that Cedric the Sorcerer's birthday is in January and that he was born under the Capricorn sign putting his birthday between January 1 and January 19.\n\nIn the Gravity Falls episode \"Carpet Diem\", Sheriff Blubs, reading his and Deputy Durland's horoscopes, mentions that the latter is a Gemini, which puts his birthday between May 21 and June 21.\n\nIn the Kirby Buckets episode \"Kirby's Choice\", Kirby states that he and Eli are Capricorns, placing their birthdays between December 22 to January 19.\n\nAccording to an internet promotional video for The Muppets (TV series), while accidentally reading his dating profile, Gonzo states that he's a Pisces, therefore his birthday lies somewhere between February 20th and March 20th.\n\nDisney Television Animation revealed that the characters Hailey Banks, Rapunzel, Kiff Chatterley, Kevin Grant-Gomez, Gus Porter, Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, and Bill Green are all Cancers, placing their birthdays between June 22nd and July 22nd.\n\nOther hints[]\n\nThe following characters have given clues about when their birthday occurs but did not give the specific date.\n\nDaisy Duck's birthday hasn't been officially stated by Disney, possibly due to her having two first appearances. Furthermore, various comics and TV shows have given their own different dates, such as May 16 in the 1955 Daisy Duck's Diary comic story \"Birthday Boo-Boo\", and December 1 in the 1989 comic story \"Forget Me Not\". In the Mickey Mouse Works short \"Whitewater Donald\", Daisy mentions that it is Valentine's Day and also her half-birthday, indicating her birthday to be approximately on August 14.\n\nIn The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh episode \"How Much is That Rabbit in the Window?\", it is shown that Rabbit's birthday is on the 30th of the unspecified month in which the episode takes place. This rules out February, as it has only 28 days (or 29 days in a leap year), and since the episode is not set in wintertime, that also likely rules out December and January.\n\nGoof Troop and its related media provide numerous (though, in some cases, conflicting) hints regarding Max Goof's birthday.\n\nIn both \"Midnight Movie Madness\" and \"You Camp Take It With You\", he claims to be 11½ years old. As these two episodes were the first two of the series ever produced, it is likely that the \"11½ years old\" claims in these episodes came directly from the series' production bible, and were meant to be taken as factually true for the events of both episodes. What's more is that, of these two episodes, the latter takes place on the first day of summer vacation, placing it anywhere from late in May to the middle of June. If he were to be merely at least 11½ in this episode, his birthday could theoretically come anywhere from June-to-November or July-to-December, so long as May or June were to be at least the sixth month after his birth month. Though, \"Midnight Movie Madness\" does feel like it might occur around Halloween, but that episode is vague enough in when it takes place that its events could just as well happen during Spring or Summer instead.\n\nAdditionally, while the Goof Troop spinoff film A Goofy Movie doesn't provide any information about Max's birth, its behind-the-scenes TV special The Making of A Goofy Movie does have director Kevin Lima declare Max to be 14 years old in the movie. Since the film takes place at the end of a high school year during the month of June,[24] Max's being 14 at the time would mean that the school grade he finishes in that movie is 9th Grade. Since 14 is the youngest a person can be when beginning high school at Grade 9 in the United States (without skipping any grades, that is), this means that Max's 14th birthday had to have come before the school year began in the previous calendar year. And with his still being 14 by the end of the same school year, then Max's 15th birthday would come later in that same calendar year, before the start of 10th Grade.\n\nThis would further align with the aforementioned notion of his birthday most likely coming somewhere during the span of either June-to-November or July-to-December, but which now narrows down the window to being somewhere between school years during the summer. And with this also matching up with Max's being 11½ in \"You Camp Take It With You\", then that would make the school grade he completed right before that episode be 6th Grade. This would also mean that, three years later, Max was more precisely 14½ years old in A Goofy Movie. And finally, certain pieces of officially-licensed merchandise declare the events of A Goofy Movie to take place in the year 1995. Therefore, if the 14½-year-old Max's 15th birthday were to come in the Summer of 1995, then the year of his birth would be none other than 1980!\n\nHOWEVER, the Goof Troop episode \"Take Me Out of the Ball Game\" actually features Max's birthday at the beginning of the episode, and places it right before the day of tryouts for Little League Baseball. The whole Little League season is then gone through in this episode, beginning a week after tryouts and is implied (but not stated outright) to span 20 weeks, which is just under five months. The season ends right as Football season is starting, which would be around the beginning of September. The 20 weeks of Little League Baseball subtracted from September 1, along with the one week before the Little League season on which the tryouts and Max's birthday occurred, would place both the tryouts date and Max's birthday on some date in April, contradicting both the established notion of Max being 11-and-a-half years old during May/June in \"You Camp Take It With You\" (since May/June would be too close to April for Max to be halfway through being 11 by that point), and the later notion of his still being 14 in June 1995 during A Goofy Movie (since an April birthday would have made him already 15 by the movie's point in time).\n\nMeanwhile, the October 1996 issue of Disney Adventures magazine includes a Goof Troop comic strip, titled \"Toy Tussle\", in which Max's birthday (a different one from the birthday seen in \"Take Me Out of the Ball Game\") is featured, but which is otherwise given no indication as to when, exactly, it takes place (besides it being in a snow-less, non-winter season).\n\nIn 2021, Kevin Lima stated on Twitter, \"In 1995, Max was 15.\"[25] While he had previously stated that Max was 14 in A Goofy Movie, this does align with the above notion that Max would have turned 15 later in 1995 at a point set after the movie's events.\n\nAdditionally, Goof Troop also provides vague hints regarding the birthday of Pete's daughter Pistol:\n\nThe episode \"Hot Air\" sees her stated multiple times to be 4½ years old. Neither she nor Max nor her brother P.J. attend school during this episode, while Pete does work at his used car lot. Pete's work schedule in the show typically has him working on weekdays with at least Saturdays off. Plus, since Max and P.J. attempt to make a jet-pack out of fireworks in the episode, and since the episode is clearly not set during Winter, it can be surmised that the episode takes place during summer, on a weekday, at some point prior to July 4 (hence the fireworks being available for the boys to already have), like in June. Like Max, were Pistol to be merely at least 4½ in this episode, her birthday could theoretically come anywhere from July to December.\n\nWhat's more is that the episode \"Three Ring Bind\" is stated by Pistol to take place three months before her next birthday. Of note is that both this episode and \"Hot Air\" also feature Giblet the Clown as a guest star. In \"Hot Air\", Pistol introduces herself to Giblet as though that moment had been her first time ever meeting him, while in \"Three Ring Bind\", she makes no such gesture and treats Giblet as if he's nobody new to her. Conversely, \"Three Ring Bind\" sees Max expressing a sense of unfamiliarity with Giblet upon hearing his name mentioned, while in \"Hot Air\" he is present for when Pistol introduces herself to Giblet in that episode, calling into question exactly when \"Three Ring Bind\" takes place in relation to \"Hot Air\", and how precise the repeated claims of Pistol being 4½ years old in \"Hot Air\" are when compared to her birthday being three months away from the time of \"Three Ring Bind\".\n\nThough, there is also Giblet's presence in Spoonerville at all to consider. If he is originally from out of town and visiting mainly because of the traveling circus that he works for in \"Three Ring Bind\" (seeking other work in \"Hot Air\" because of the circus's closing down in the other episode), then that could suggest all of his appearances (\"Hot Air\", \"Three Ring Bind\", and \"Buddy Building\") to take place in relatively close proximity to each other, possibly even within the same week or so. Were that to be the case, then \"Hot Air\" taking place before July 4 during June and \"Three Ring Bind\" being set three months before her birthday would, collectively, mean that Pistol was born in the month of September.\n\nMeanwhile, the episode \"Goofin' Up the Social Ladder\" has Pistol declare herself to be \"almost 5\", placing it both after and at least within the same year as \"Hot Air\", while the episode \"Fool's Gold\" has her claim to be 6 years old, showing that her birthdays do come and go even if their exact date is unknown (and even if the chronology of these episodes is a fair bit out of order from how they originally aired).\n\nBacking up to A Goofy Movie, Max's love interest from that movie, Roxanne, has her birthday mentioned in a 1997 French comic strip published in the 2330th issue of Le Journal de Mickey.\n\nSaid comic spans two days set in February, with the first set on a day preceding Valentine's Day. As there is also no snow to be found anywhere in the city during this first day, it must come as far from January as possible before February 14. The second day of this story is said to be Roxanne's birthday, but features no celebration of her birth. Instead, the school's theater workshop performs a play titled \"Je t'Aime\" (\"I Love You\" in French). This play is strongly implied to be a one-time performance, as though it were for a special occasion. Given the romantic nature of this play, and its single-day limited performance, it would make sense for it to be performed on Valentine's Day itself. So if the second day of this story is both Valentine's Day and Roxanne's birthday, then the date of Roxanne's birth would be none other than February 14.\n\nWhat's more, tie-in material for A Goofy Movie confirms that Roxanne and Max are classmates in the same grade. Max being in 9th Grade during the movie would also be true for Roxanne. So if she started high school at Age 14, then her birthday being in February would make her 15 by the movie's time, making her actually a little older than Max. And, with A Goofy Movie being set in June 1995, Roxanne having turned 15 earlier in that year would make her exact date of birth February 14, 1980.\n\nHowever, in The Making of A Goofy Movie, character designer Carole Holliday states that, when designing Roxanne, director Kevin Lima wanted \"a character who was 13 years old, and spunky and the most popular girl in the school.\" Setting aside the latter two points, it is unlikely for her to be 13 during the movie's time since, with its being set at the end of a high school year, the youngest age a high schooler (specifically, a ninth-grader) in the U.S. can be at the end of a school year is 14. Unless she was gifted enough to have skipped a grade, and even if she were, her birthday being in February would still make her turn 14 by the end of the school year. She would have had to have skipped two grades to be 13 during A Goofy Movie, needing to have started high school at age 12 instead. But, the final version of the movie itself gives no reason to consider this to be so, with 15 being a more reasonable age for her.\n\nIn Aladdin, Princess Jasmine's birthday may fall on late January or early February because when Aladdin and Jasmine fly on the magic carpet, Chinese New Year is being celebrated over in China. This holiday can fall anywhere from January 21 to February 20.\n\nAt the end of the Teamo Supremo episode \"Will You Be My Valentine Bandit?\", the Birthday Bandit asks Skate Lad, \"Isn't your birthday in about a month or so?\" This indicates that Skate Lad's birthday is in the middle of March.\n\nIn the W.I.T.C.H. episode \"Parent's Night\", Elyon Brown mentions that her birthday is March 13. (But in the comic book, her birthday is October 31.)\n\nPhineas and Ferb had episodes that took place on the birthdays of Dr. Doofenshmirtz (\"Raging Bully\"), Linda Flynn-Fletcher (\"Mom's Birthday\"), Hildegard Johnson (\"Run, Candace, Run\"), Phineas Flynn (\"Phineas' Birthday Clip-O-Rama!\"), Stacy Hirano (mentioned in \"Doofapus\"), Major Monogram (\"Backyard Hodge Podge\"), Isabella Garcia-Shapiro (\"Happy Birthday, Isabella\"), and Jeremy Johnson (\"Cheers for Fears\"). However, none of these episodes mention the exact dates, so all that is known about these characters' birthdays is that they occur between the end of May and the end of August.\n\nAccording to the 104 Days of Summer! board game, Baljeet Tjinder's birthday is on the 13th day of summer vacation. Though this does not give a specific date, it does imply that Baljeet's birthday is in June.\n\nAlso, Perry the Platypus has a birthday in the comic \"Happy Birthday, Perry!\"; thus, his birthday is likely also between these dates.\n\nOn a related note, Milo Murphy's birthday is celebrated in the Milo Murphy's Law episode \"Party of Peril\". Though no specific date is given in the episode, it appears to take place in autumn, as evidenced by the colored foliage.\n\nIn the Toy Story comic \"The Return of Buzz Lightyear\", Andy Davis receives a surprise gift from his grandmother during August, and his toys are surprised about this because Andy's birthday is not in August.\n\nVision is \"born\" during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron, which happens in May 2015, but no exact date is given.\n\nStar Butterfly's birthday happens to be on Stump Day, a holiday celebrated on Mewni that appears to be their equivalent to Christmas (she chooses not to celebrate it that day because it would anger the Stump). However, Mewni follows a different calendar, with the month in which Stump Day falls currently unidentified.\n\nThe Hamster & Gretel episode \"Birthday Besties\" takes place on Bailey Carter's birthday, which is on the 27th of an unidentified month, which does not appear to be in the wintertime.\n\nAssuming Henry Turner had a term birth, he was born between April 16 and June 21, as he was born 37-42 weeks after the battle of Calypso's maelstrom which occured in August.[26]\n\nBilly Russo's date of birth is given as \"11/19/1977\" on Marvel's The Punisher Online Auction Lot #144: Billy Russo's Tooth and Accessories, \"12/03/82\" on Marvel's The Punisher Online Auction Lot #218: Frank Castle's Hospital Gown with Three Billy Russo Hospital Bracelets, and \"09/10/83\" on Marvel's The Punisher Online Auction Lot #186: Billy Russo's Plain White Mask and Hospital File."
