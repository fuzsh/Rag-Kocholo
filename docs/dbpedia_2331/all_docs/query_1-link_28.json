        "text": "Nora Forster, a music promoter and mother of the late Slits frontwoman Ari Up who married John Lydon in 1979, has died after living with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nPublic Image Ltd. this month released a moving new single called “Hawaii,” described by the band as a “love letter” to frontman John Lydon’s wife Nora Forster.\n\nAlthough John Lydon has delayed work on a new Public Image Ltd. album over the death of stepdaughter Ari Up, the reunited band will continue performing in 2011, with two new summer festival dates announced this week in the U.K. and Slovakia.\n\nA day after Ari Up, iconic frontwoman of The Slits, succumbed to a long illness, her label Narnack Records has released what it bills as the band’s ‘final work’: a heretofore unreleased video for the song ‘Lazy Slam,’ off last year’s ‘Trapped Animal’ album.\n\nGerman-born punk pioneer Ari Up — the frontwoman of The Slits who learned guitar from Joe Strummer and was John Lydon’s stepdaughter — died today at age 48 following ‘a serious illness,’ Lydon and her mother, Nora Foster, announced via Public Image Ltd.’s website."
