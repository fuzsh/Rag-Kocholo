        "text": "Today, singer/songwriter, entrepreneur and best-selling music business author Ari Herstand releases his heartfelt single “Birthday.” With bittersweet nostalgia, the track immerses the listener in the ache of losing a relationship through a lens of optimism. “Birthday” is the latest release from Ari’s forthcoming album ‘Like Home,’ out April 9th.\n\nOpening with the lines “I got my tarot read from a friend crossed legged sitting on her bed / She told me things are looking up,” “Birthday” weaves a sincere narrative of wishing an ex-lover well on the first birthday apart from each other. Mixed feelings of reminiscence and the ever-present pain of loss and courage to face the future all blend together in this stirring piano ballad. As the song progresses, emotive chords are enhanced by a shimmering atmosphere with delicate touches of spacious percussion. “Happy Birthday,” Ari sings with an air of wistful finality. “I hope you’re not alone.”\n\n“Birthday,” a vulnerable window into Ari’s upcoming album ‘Like Home’, expresses a deeply personal sentiment about the aftermath of an 11-year relationship. “I wrote this on [my ex-girlfriend’s] birthday months after our breakup,” the singer says. “Her first birthday we hadn’t spent together in 12 years. There is no animosity for her. I only want the best for her. I want her to succeed. And I want her to be ok.”\n\nAri’s new album ‘Like Home,’ out April 9th, depicts the transformative time after his former relationship ended in a way that is both autobiographical and universally relatable. The six-song project, pared down from 40 raw demos, questions the concept of “home” and where it can be found when stable foundations have been destroyed. Previous singles “Like Home” and “Drifting” were introductory statements of this intimate truth from Ari, who has made a name for himself teaching independent artists how to succeed in the music business through his blog Ari’s Take and the subsequent book and podcast series.\n\nREAD more about Ari and ‘Like Home’ via Authority Magazine: https://medium.com/authority-magazine/music-stars-making-a-social-impact-why-how-ari-herstand-of-aris-take-academy-is-helping-to-dcac51680232\n\n‘LIKE HOME’ TRACKLIST\n\n1.

Annabel Lee)\n\nABOUT ARI HERSTAND\n\nDescribed by Forbes as “the poster child of DIY music,” the LA-via-Minneapolis Ari Herstand is an entrepreneur, musician, best-selling author, educator, advocate and authority on how to succeed as an independent musician.

At the helm of his blog Ari’s Take, Ari empowers musicians through the Ari’s Take Academy online music business school and the New Music Business podcast. He also hosts a weekly music industry forum on Clubhouse on Monday nights.\n\nARI HERSTAND ON THE WEB\n\nhttps://ariherstand.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ariherstand/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ariherstand/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ariherstand/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ariherstand/\n\nhttps://aristake.com/"
