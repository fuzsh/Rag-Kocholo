        "text": "The punk pioneer passed away on Wednesday (20Oct10) after suffering a \"serious illness\", according to her stepfather, Sex Pistols rocker John Lydon.\n\nNo further details of her cause of death were given as WENN went to press.\n\nLydon, who is married to Up's mother Nora, confirmed the sad news in a post on his official website.\n\nThe message reads, \"John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora's daughter Arianna (aka Ari-Up) died today after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed. Everyone at JohnLydon.com and PiLofficial.Com would like to pass on their heartfelt condolences to John, Nora and family. Rest in peace.\"\n\nThe singer, who was born Arianna Forster, formed the rock band in 1976 when she was just 14 years old and they went on to release three albums and tour with The Clash before disbanding in 1982.\n\nUp later worked on solo projects and notably joined collaborative music group the New Age Steppers before she reunited the band with new members in 2005. They continued to release new music and tour up until this summer (10) when the band cancelled an appearance at The Great Escape music festival without giving a reason."
