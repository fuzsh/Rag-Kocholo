        "text": "Days between two dates\n\nThe date calculator calculates the difference between the 'Start Date' and 'End Date' and displays it in terms of the number of years, months, weeks and days between them.\n\nAs per the methodology used in this date calculator, a week starts on 'Monday' and ends on 'Sunday'.\n\nAdd to or subtract from a date\n\nThe date calculator below calculates how far behind or how further ahead will be the date as per the input provided in the 'Start Date' field and the fields below it. The result displayed is a particular date and the day on which it falls.\n\nWhat is a date calculator?\n\nA date calculator lets you make various kinds of date calculations such as calculating the number of days between two particular dates, knowing how many days have passed since your birth or since you started a job, calculating how many days are left for the next Cricket world cup to begin or for the next Lok Sabha elections, and many more such calculations.\n\nHow do the above calculators work?\n\nWorking methodology of the 1st calculator\n\nThe 1st calculator lets you calculate the difference between two dates, wherein, the first date is termed as 'Start Date' and the latter as 'End Date'. By default, initially, the current date appears in both fields.\n\nA user can either enter a past date as the 'Start Date' and calculate the difference between that particular date and the present date or enter a date in the future as the 'End Date' and calculate how far it is from the current date. Alternately, users can also enter both dates as per their choice and check the difference between both dates.\n\nThe result displayed is in terms of calendar days, which is shown according to the duration of the difference. Additionally, users can choose to include the last day which adds 1 day to the difference by checking the 'Include End Day (add 1 day)' option.\n\nAs per the methodology used in this date calculator, a week starts on 'Monday' and ends on 'Sunday'.\n\nWorking methodology of the 2nd calculator\n\nThis calculator can be used to add or subtract some particular number of years, months, weeks or days, individually or combined, from a particular date which is represented by the field 'Start Date' in this calculator. Initially, the 'Start Date' field shows the current date. If need be, users can enter a date of their choice in that field.\n\nNow, users need to enter the number of years, months, weeks and days or the number of any individual attribute, as per their choice, in the respective input fields. Next, users need to specify whether to add or subtract that duration from the date by choosing either 'Add +' or 'Subtract -' from the corresponding menu and click on 'Calculate' to get the result.\n\nThe result displayed is a date and day which is either before or after the 'Start Date' as per the data provided on the input page.\n\nAs per the methodology used in this date calculator, a week starts on 'Monday' and ends on 'Sunday'.\n\nVarious types of Calendars used in India\n\nIndia, being a hotbed of cultures, is home to people belonging to various ethnicities and following many different religions. This has resulted in Indians following various types of calendars for religious, cultural and official purposes. Though there are numerous, some of the most common types of calendars used in India include the Saka Samvat, Vikram Samvat, the Hijri calendar and the Georgian calendar.\n\nThe Saka Samvat lunisolar Hindu calendar is believed to have been introduced by the rulers of the Satavahana dynasty. Quite similar to those used for official purposes, this calendar also has 365 days and 12 months, and in 1957, it was adopted as the 'Indian National Calendar'. However, unlike the official new year's eve, according to the system followed by the Saka Samvat calendar, a new year begins with the onset of the 'Chaitra' month whose first day coincides with March 22 in a conventional calendar or with March 21 if its a leap year.\n\nSimilarly, there are some unconventional factors that accompany the Vikram Samvat and the Hijri calendar as well. The Vikram Samvat is a Hindu lunar calendar that is based on the movement of the moon. It has 354 days and 12 months in a year. The months in this calendar are further divided into two phases: 'Shukla Paksha' which begins with a new moon and 'Krishna Paksha' which starts with a full moon. The Hijri calendar is a lunar Islamic calendar that also has 354 days. Followed worldwide, this calendar is used to determine the dates for various Islamic rituals including Ramadan and Hajj.\n\nThe calendar used for official purposes\n\nAn improvised version of the Julian calendar, the Georgian calendar is used in India as well as various other countries around the world for official purposes. In this calendar, a year is divided into 365 days, with the exception of a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year are categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except the month of February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year."
