Born Ariane Daniele Forster to a wealthy German family, she was raised in England from age eight and was exposed to rock early on through her music publisher mother, though she received essentially no formal training. In 1976 Ari joined with drummer Palmolive to form The Slits, who initially worked as an opening act for The Clash and had a cameo in their 1980 film \"Rude Boy\". The group began touring on their own and in 1979 released their debut album \"Cut\" which featured Ari as one of three semi-attired girls on the cover and had titles like \"Shoplifting\" and \"Ping Pong Affair\". The Slits broke-up after publishing their 1981 recording \"Return of the Giant Slits\" and Ari lived in a variety of places including New York, Indonesia, and Jamaica, continuing to perform punk and reggae, first as part of the New Age Steppers, then on her own using such names as Ari Up, Madussa, and Baby Ari. Ari cut her first solo album, \"Dread More Dan Dead\", in 2005 and in 2006 joined with bassist and original member Tessa Pollitt to re-start The Slits. She toured with the ensemble in Asia, Europe, and America and appeared on their 2009 record \"Trapped Animal\". She also played solo concerts with her back-up band The True Warriors and can be heard as a guest artist on a number of groups' recordings. Ari died of cancer. Always claiming that her original band had been an early influence on Madonna, she said: \"I'm p****d-off that she's never worn a T-shirt with \"THE SLITS\" written in sequins. She owes us\"."
