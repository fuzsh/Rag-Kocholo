        "text": "Free Screening of Boy to Showcase Institute’s Spectrum of Support for Native and Indigenous Filmmaking at Santa Fe’s Lensic Performing Arts Center on May 22\n\nLos Angeles, CA – Sundance Institute today announced four fellows and projects selected for the 2010 Sundance Institute-Ford Foundation Fellowship. The Sundance Institute’s Native American and Indigenous Program created the fellowship with support from the Ford Foundation to provide direct support to emerging Native American and Indigenous film artists working in the U.S. The 2010 Native American and Indigenous Fellows are: Yolanda Cruz (Chatino) – La Raya, Ramona Emerson (Diné) – Opal, Randi LeClair (Pawnee Nation) – The Other Side of the Bridge, and Kaherawaks Thompson (Mohawk) – Close to Death.\n\nThe Sundance Institute-Ford Foundation Fellowship is a two-stage development opportunity for filmmakers with film projects at the early stages of development. The first stage of support is an intensive five-day workshop to be held May 24-28, 2010 on the Ancestral lands of the Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico. The workshop is designed to support filmmakers in strengthening their craft, developing their voice as writers, and advancing their current projects closer towards production. Fellows receive feedback on their projects from established screenwriters and filmmakers who serve as Creative Advisors all within a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nThe second stage of the Fellowship is intended to advance the careers of the Fellows by providing networking opportunities with film professionals who can advise them on both the craft and business of cinema. Fellows will attend the 2011 Sundance Film Festival where they can network with established screenwriters, producers, and other industry professionals.\n\nNew for 2010, leading up to the Lab and as part of its mission to support and share the work of Native American and Indigenous artists, Sundance Institute and Milagro at Los Luceros will showcase award-winning New Zealand director Taika Waititi’s Boy on May 22 at The Lensic Performing Arts Center, 211 West San Francisco Street, Santa Fe, New Mexico. Milagro at Los Luceros is a collaboration that includes Robert Redford, the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New Mexico Film Office. Its mission is to create and expand training programs in film, arts, and the environment, concentrating on Hispanic, Native American, African American and other underrepresented voices.\n\nBoy had its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, and tells the story of 11-year-old Boy and his little brother Rocky reconciling reality with fantasy as their dad returns after many years away. Following a successful theatrical release in New Zealand, the May 22 screening will be the film’s New Mexico premiere. The screening will begin at noon and is free and open to the public. Theater lobby opens at 11:00 a.m., and house seating begins at 11:30 a.m.\n\nUnder the guidance of Bird Runningwater, Associate Director, Sundance Institute Native American and Indigenous Program, the Native Filmmakers Lab provides an opportunity for Native artists to workshop their early-stage work in an environment that explores innovation, risk-taking, and the intersection of filmmaking and centuries-old storytelling. At the Lab begins a relationship with the Institute that continues through each filmmaker’s creative journey, with the hope the finished film will return to native and indigenous communities and inspire new generations of storytellers. The Fellows will work with an accomplished group of Creative Advisors including Merata Mita (Mauri; Spooked), Tyger Williams (Menace II Society), and Rachel Perkins (One Night the Moon; Bran Nue Dae).\n\n“Last year, we reinvigorated our lab by hosting it on native land — we were reoriented to the communities we serve and the potential native cinema has,” said Runningwater. “The place, the advisors, and the filmmakers create an environment in which culture is a central part of the conversation – how culture is portrayed in filmic storytelling and how central it is to the development of unique, powerful voices. We are excited to bring these four women, with backgrounds and stories that span the Americas, and provide the continued support and guidance needed to cultivate impactful storytelling.”\n\nThe projects and participants selected for the Sundance Institute-Ford Foundation Film Fellowship are:\n\nLa Raya / Yolanda Cruz (Chatino), Writer/Director: Destined to follow in the footsteps of other men in his village, 11 year old Papio has his eyes set on emigrating to the US, one day he finds an abandoned refrigerator which could finance his journey, but is he willing to leave behind his family and his village forever?\n\nYolanda Cruz (Chatino) is an indigenous Chatino from Oaxaca, Mexico, and the producer-director of seven award-winning documentaries.
