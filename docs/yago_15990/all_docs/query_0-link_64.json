Responses to the film by Rotuman and nonRotuman audiences, and by critics, are presented. A number of issues associated with indigenous filmmaking are also discussed.\n\nWebsites as Vehicles for Repatriation (2008) Download PDF\n\nAn account of the creation and maintenance of the Rotuma Website and the ways in which it serves as a vehicle for repatriation of Rotuma-related materials and as an accessible archive for the Rotuman people.\n\nLand Issues on Rotuma (2011) Download PDF\n\nA discussion of the history of land tenure on Rotuma, including the complications that have arisen as a result of the introduction of a commercial economy and ill-conceived legislative acts by the Fiji Government.\n\nIndigeneity-The Case of Rotumans in Fiji (2012) Download PDF\n\nIn the Blueprint for the protection of Fijian & Rotuman rights and interests proposed by the Prime Minister of Fiji to the Great Council of Chiefs in 2000, Rotumans were included as indigenous to Fiji.
