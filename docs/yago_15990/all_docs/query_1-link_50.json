The recorded conversations between members of the local industry aim to create an open space for dialogue where new opportunities for the sector might be identified.\n\nFilm Fiji chief executive officer, Ramiro Tenorio, said: “We are very excited about these panel discussion series.\n\n“It is an opportunity to bring people together in the industry, to join the dots and think outside the box.”\n\nThe panel series which will showcase conversations with educators, producers, actors, crew and filmmakers. Fijian director Vilsoni Hereniko is also among panellists.\n\nMr Hereniko in 2004 released the film, The Land Has Eyes.
