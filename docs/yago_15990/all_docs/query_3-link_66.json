        "text": "32 THE OCEANIA DANCE THEATRE IN CONTEXT Introduction / The <strong>Oceania</strong> Dance Theatre, based at the <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture at the <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> the South Pacific (USP) in Suva, Fiji, is creating waves in the Pacific and beyond. Its success is due to: an atmosphere that encourages the freedom <strong>of</strong> the artist to create without boundaries; a visionary leader; a talented choreographer and a cadre <strong>of</strong> multicultural dancers rooted in their own cultures, but not bound <strong>by</strong> them; and an audience hungry for original and innovative works. The success <strong>of</strong> this initiative suggests that contemporary dance in the Pacific — in contrast to traditional dance — is less concerned with the purity <strong>of</strong> dance traditions or the ethnicity or race <strong>of</strong> its dancers than with creative fusions <strong>of</strong> dance forms that reflect urban experiences and connect us to a global community. 1 As contemporary dance groups become established and accepted widely in the Pacific, they begin to destabilise deep-seated notions that Pacific Islanders should only concern themselves with the dance forms <strong>of</strong> their specific cultures and refrain from venturing into dance traditions that are not theirs. 2 The result <strong>of</strong> this progressive ideology is that the focus is now shifting away from ethnicity or race; boundaries that have separated Pacific Islanders and other kin in the past are now crumbling. A new <strong>Oceania</strong> is emerging — one in which we are all connected — and the dance program at the <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture is at the forefront <strong>of</strong> this development. Freedom to dance / In a moving speech <strong>by</strong> Moana Jackson <strong>of</strong> Aotearoa New Zealand at a United Nations Global Seminar at the <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> Hawai‘i in 2004, he reminded his audience <strong>of</strong> pr<strong>of</strong>essors and students that DANCING OCEANIA VILSONI HERENIKO <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture, <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> the South Pacific, Fiji, 2005 Queensland Art Gallery Image Archive the terms ‘Polynesia’, ‘Micronesia’, and ‘Melanesia’ are divisive categories imposed on the Pacific region <strong>by</strong> the French navigator Jules Dumont d’Urville (1790–1842). By putting the people <strong>of</strong> <strong>Oceania</strong> into three different boxes, he ‘broke down, weakened and, in some cases, destroyed the long traditions and histories which had joined us together’. 3 Jackson also said that as a result <strong>of</strong> a history <strong>of</strong> colonisation in <strong>Oceania</strong>, Pacific Islanders have been preoccupied with a culture <strong>of</strong> survival as they adapted to realities imposed on them <strong>by</strong> their oppressors. The time has come, he exhorted, for Pacific Islanders to work towards a culture <strong>of</strong> freedom so they can define and represent who they are rather than have foreign powers continue to do so for them. Epeli Hau’<strong>of</strong>a, Director <strong>of</strong> the <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture, concurred with Jackson’s assertion in his keynote address at the first academic conference on dance in <strong>Oceania</strong>, held at the Museum <strong>of</strong> New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, in Wellington, New Zealand, in 2005. Like Jackson, he sees the carving up <strong>of</strong> the Pacific into three different areas as responsible for severing our historical, social and cultural ties. According to Hau’<strong>of</strong>a, the time has come for Pacific Islanders to find their lost relatives. 4 Both Jackson and Hau’<strong>of</strong>a clearly recognise the importance <strong>of</strong> Pacific Islanders taking charge <strong>of</strong> their present as well as their future. Both also advocate the need for the peoples <strong>of</strong> <strong>Oceania</strong> to be free from the shackles <strong>of</strong> colonialism and to recognise their common history and heritage. But free to do what? In the context <strong>of</strong> this paper, free to dance any way we want, free to produce original dances that dazzle the eye, move the heart and speak to our human experience. Free to perform each other’s Performance <strong>of</strong> Fenua (a contemporary interpretation <strong>of</strong> Tahitian traditional dance) <strong>by</strong> <strong>Oceania</strong> Dance Theatre at the <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture, <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> the South Pacific, Fiji, September 2006 Choreographer: Allan Alo / Image courtesy: <strong>Oceania</strong> Centre for Arts and Culture, <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> the South Pacific, Fiji / Photograph: Ann Tarte"
