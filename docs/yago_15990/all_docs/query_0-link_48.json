Vilsoni went to Malhaha School for his primary and part of his secondary education before leaving for Fiji, where he attended Queen Victoria School for two years. From there he went to the University of the South Pacific where he graduated in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Graduate Certificate in Education.
