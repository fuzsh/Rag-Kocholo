This award is given to the one the audience votes as the best. We are hoping that Rotumans will show up and support our nomination.\n\nFrom Jeannette Hereniko in Brisbane (1 August 2004, posted 25 August)\n\nWe had such a fabulous screening yesterday (Sunday, 1 August) at the Brisbane Film Festival, with about 50 Rotumans plus some Fijians and several Torres Straight islanders who tell me that they have Rotuman blood, in attendance. I could definitely hear and feel their influence during the sceening and after-film discussion, making it very lively indeed!\n\nJeannette Hereniko (center) with members of the Rotuman community in Brisbane, Australia\n\nFrom Fiji Times Online (24 August 2004)\n\nPierre Tomoniko finds his vocation\n\nThis item has been transferred to the Life Stories section of the website\n\nFrom Alan Howard in Honolulu (22 August 2004)\n\nThe Fiji contingent to the 9th Pacific Arts Festival, which included a number of Rotuman performers, has returned home with a great sense of accomplishment. The festival was held in the Republic of Palau from 22-31 July.\n\nRotuman dancer wearing woven mat\n\nAn interview with Letila Mitchell, who was the artistic director for the Fiji delegation, was featured in a Sunday Post article on 15 August. Among other things, Letila reported that:\n\n\"This is also the first time that Fiji ever showcased Rotuma’s culture on the international arena.\n\n\"It has always being the case of Viti kei Rotuma and little emphasis has been put on the saying itself.\n\n\"This trip saw fourteen Rotumans travelling with the delegation, headed by Reverend Emotama Pene.\"\n\nVilsoni Hereniko, who showed his film, The Land has Eyes at the Festival, reported that the Rotuman dance performances were exciting and well-received. In addition to the usual costumes of shirts and sulus, the dancers wore costumes made entirely of finely woven mats.\n\nAnd according to a Fiji Times Online account (7 August):\n\nRatu Naiqama, who recently led Fiji's delegation to the 9th Festival of Pacific Arts in Palau, commended the dynamic effort of all the performers.\n\n\"The level of performance by our youth groups was certainly very high and professional,\" he said.\n\nRatu Naiqama said the locally produced movie Land Has Eyes attracted full houses and everyone admired the talent of the young actress Sapeta Taito even though she had no professional training.\n\nRatu Naiqama said the movie produced by Vilisoni Hereniko should be submitted for the world famous Academy Awards in Los Angeles next year.\n\nThe 90-minute film is the story of Viki, whose father is falsely accused of a crime, and her fight for justice on his behalf.\n\nHe said to qualify for the foreign language category at the Oscars, the movie that was shot on digital video, must be converted to print before the end of next month.\n\nRatu Naiqama said converting to print would cost $US40,000 ($FJ70,984.92) and the filmmakers had secured $US20,000 ($F35,492.46) from a willing donor but needed the other half.\n\nHe suggested Government fund the remaining $US20,000 because it would benefit the country as it would be screened in several countries.\n\nFrom Fiji Times Online (19 August 2004)\n\nISLANDERS travelling from as far as Rotuma have arrived for the annual Methodist Conference that begins with the choir competition this weekend.\n\nMalhaha circuit's Reverend Irava Fatiaki said from the island yesterday the church members, including the choir, left on Monday.\n\n\"Some have come for the conference, while the 22 members of the choir will compete in the singing competition. We will have our reps to the meeting on Cicia,\" Mr Fatiaki.\n\nHe said church members had been fundraising from the beginning of the year for the conference trip.\n\n\"We had our own fundraising activities among our circuits but last month we wrapped up our fundraising with a mini-bazaar where we raised $15,000.\"\n\nFrom The Council of Rotuma (posted 7 August 2004)"
