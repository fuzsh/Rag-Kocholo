Reza De Wet

Reza de Wet (1953-2012), South African actress and playwright, has established herself as one of the most prominent voices in contemporary South African drama, winning more literary awards than any other playwright from her country, including the widely renowned Athol Fugard. Writing primarily in Afrikaans, de Wet is principally concerned with issues of hypocrisy and repression as they manifest themselves within the Afrikaner community. Her work represents a radical departure from earlier forms of Afrikaans theatre (which dates back to the 1930s), which were highly insular and propagandistic in their promotion of Afrikaner national ethnic identity -- characterised by the conspicuous non-acknowledgement of the Black majority in South Africa and antagonistic in their stance toward the more liberal, educated, urban Anglo population.
