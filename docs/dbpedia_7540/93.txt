Come to the Delaware colony, where we have the most amazing Government you can think of! We have so many rights and freedoms here! Peter Minuit was the governor of Delaware. The people that could vote were only males. The democratic rule in our colony is the assembly line. By the year of 1775 Delaware was known as a Proprietary colony.

William Penn was granted land of Delaware in 1682 and then he gave that to Peter Minuit. Delaware shared Government with Pennsylvania which is located in the middle colonies. Delaware and Pennsylvania shared their government because for a long time Delaware was a part of Pennsylvania. Then in 1703 Delaware created its own legislature. Our Government is great because you had the right to vote for the governor. Even though it may not seem like much, trust me there is a lot going on!
