        "text": "Archaeologists don’t agree on when the first humans came to the area we now call Pennsylvania, but they’ve found artifacts that are at least 19,400 years old. Native American tribes including the Lenape, Susquehannocks, Erie, Seneca, and Oneida, lived on the land that’s now Pennsylvania thousands of years later.\n\nIn 1681 Englishman William Penn, a member of a Christian group called the Quakers, founded the British colony of Pennsylvania. Because Penn’s colony offered settlers religious freedom, it attracted people of other denominations. A wave of German immigrants including Quakers, Mennonites, and Amish moved to the area. These settlers eventually developed their own dialect and their descendants are now called the Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nThe French and English fought for control of the land during the French and Indian War, which lasted from 1754 to 1763. The English won but ended up in debt from fighting. To make back the money, they taxed the colonists—something many people didn’t think was fair. Anger over this action helped lead to the Revolutionary War, which started in 1775.\n\nIn 1775 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, held the second Continental Congress. This was when representatives from each of the colonies met for the second time after deciding to go to war with Britain. And it was during this time that Thomas Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence. That same year George Washington led the colonial forces known as the Continental Army across the Delaware River—and to an important victory—in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In 1787, after the war ended, Pennsylvania became the second U.S. state.\n\nPennsylvania supported the Union during the Civil War. One of the most important battles took place at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, in 1863. The Union won the battle, marking a turning point toward eventual victory in the war.\n\nPennsylvania is bordered by New York and Lake Erie in the north; New York and New Jersey in the east; Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia in the south; and West Virginia and Ohio in the west. The land can be divided into six regions.\n\nThe Atlantic Coastal Plain Province in the extreme southeast is a flat, low region with narrow valleys that were cut by streams. It contains Tinicum Marsh, the first urban wildlife refuge in the United States.\n\nWest of the Atlantic Coastal Plain is the Piedmont Province, with rolling hills, ridges, tower-shaped rocks, caves, and sinkholes.\n\nThe New England Province is northeast of the Piedmont Province, and contains steeply sloped hills and ridges.\n\nFarther west is the Ridge and Valley Province, which contains part of the Appalachian Mountains. About half of the region is forested.\n\nThe Appalachian Plateaus Province sweeps across the central and western part of the state. It’s a heavily forested area that includes Allegheny National Forest and the Pocono and Catskill Mountains.\n\nThe Central Lowland Province is in the extreme northeast and has low ridges that were created by glaciers."
