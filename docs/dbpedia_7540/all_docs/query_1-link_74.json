The apiary consistently houses between 30-100 colonies during the peak season. A unique and special result of the increase in the number of colonies has been the production, harvest and marketing of UD’s own honey, featured in the UD Creamery throughout the year. This honey is not only delicious but is produced by University bees and generates revenue that can be used to sustain the apiary."
