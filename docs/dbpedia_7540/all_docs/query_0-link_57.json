        "text": "The original 13 colonies of what became the United States of America can be divided geographically into the New England, Middle, and Southern colonies. The Southern colonies were Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. They were located south of both the New England colonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and the Middle colonies (New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware). The Southern colonies were noted for plantations, or large farms, and for the use of slaves to work on them.\n\nThe English were the first Europeans to settle the Southern colonies. In 1606 an expedition of colonists sailed from England to the New World. The next year they established Jamestown Colony in what is now the state of Virginia. It was the first permanent English settlement in America. Roman Catholics founded Maryland in 1634 as a religious refuge. Virginians eventually moved south, into the Carolinas, and settled there about 1653. Charles Town (now Charleston, South Carolina), founded in 1670, was the first permanent English settlement in the province of Carolina. (North Carolina and South Carolina did not become separate provinces until 1712.)\n\nGeorgia was the last of the 13 colonies to be settled. British general James Oglethorpe founded the colony in 1733 as a haven for imprisoned debtors and the poor. The colony was also open to persecuted Protestants from Germany and Austria. Oglethorpe envisioned the Georgia colony as a buffer separating the English colonies from the Spaniards in Florida and the French in Louisiana.\n\nAlthough most people of the Southern colonies were English, there were small groups of Scots, Scotch-Irish, Germans, and others. The official religion of Virginia and the Carolinas was the Church of England (the Anglican church). Religion, though, never strongly swayed the people in the Southern colonies. As Baptist, Quaker, and Presbyterian immigrants arrived, they freely established their own churches. Although Roman Catholics founded Maryland, they welcomed Protestants as well. Even after the English crown made Anglicanism Maryland’s official religion in 1692, the colony remained tolerant of other religions. In Georgia, everyone but Roman Catholics had religious freedom from the start.\n\nThe Southern colonies had a warm climate. Although the warm weather helped spread disease, it also made for ideal farming conditions. Southerners found that their economic success was tied to agriculture. South Carolina’s land, for example, was suitable for rice and indigo. Virginia and Maryland specialized in tobacco. Southerners not only sold the crops throughout the colonies but also made a large profit exporting them to England.\n\nWhile most Southerners lived on small farms, some of the wealthier people established plantations for large-scale farming. Indentured servants and slaves did much of the work on the plantations. Indentured servants had their passage paid to the New World but then had to work for a certain period of time to pay off that debt. They generally worked from four to seven years, after which they became free. A large percentage of the white settlers in North America were indentured servants. Some owners of smaller farms also used indentured servants and slaves. However, those owners typically worked alongside their help while plantation owners did not.\n\nThe first Africans in the Americas arrived in Virginia in 1619. They had been on a Portuguese slave ship heading to Mexico. Two English privateers attacked the Portuguese ship and captured about 50 African men, women, and children. One of the English ships brought the Africans to Jamestown, where colonists purchased them. Records are limited, but historians assume that the Africans were put to work on the tobacco harvest. It is possible that they were treated at first as indentured servants rather than as slaves.\n\nMeanwhile, the plantation owners were becoming dissatisfied with the indentured servant system. It was getting harder to find people who would willingly choose to become indentured. In addition, the loss of indentured servants as they fulfilled their contracts caused worker shortages. Plantation owners soon turned to slavery, which guaranteed permanent workers. Virginia legalized the practice in 1661 and began relying on Africans for slave labor. As the plantations prospered, the demand for slaves increased. The import of enslaved Africans vastly increased the population of the Southern colonies. (See also Atlantic slave trade.)"
