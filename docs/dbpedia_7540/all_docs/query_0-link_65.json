        "text": "New Netherland\n\nNew Netherland was founded in 1614 as the first Dutch colony in North America. As we can see on the map, it extended from Delaware into New York, covering much of the territory that would become under English control. Nevertheless, it was relatively small compared to English colonies in the North and South, such as the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Colony of Virginia.\n\nIn 1621, the Dutch government founded the Dutch West India Company in an attempt to stimulate economic growth in the region. However, the company was much more focused on its conflicts with Spain and Portugal by attacking its colonies. The colony, therefore, did not receive significant investment and combined with sparse Dutch immigration, this limited the strength of New Netherland.\n\nWhat exactly was the immigration issue?\n\nDutch migrants were not as affected by the cultural and religious turmoil that caused many English to migrate to North America.\n\nEven a 1629 company policy promising a large land grant to anyone who would bring fifty settlers to the province failed to attract settlers.\n\nBy the 1660s, New Netherland still only had around 5,000 white and African inhabitants.\n\nBy that time, the population of Virginia had reached 40,000.\n\nNew Netherland and the Iroquois Confederacy\n\nNew Netherland's main export was furs, which settlers obtained from trading with Indigenous Peoples on the Hudson River. The Dutch traded with the local Iroquois tribes, but their trade created competition between the tribes in question. By 1629 the Mohawk Nation were the chief suppliers of furs to the Dutch traders.\n\nThe Haudenosaunee Confederacy, also known as the Iroquois Confederacy, was made up of five Nations at the time, of which the Mohawk Nation was the easternmost. The Nations were allied to defend their lands from the spreading influence of white settlers and other tribes.\n\nIn the 1640s, the Haudenosaunee went to war with the Wyandot people, also known as the Hurons. Using weapons they had obtained from trading with the Dutch, the Haudenosaunee defeated the Wyandot who fled far south. This allowed the Haudenosaunee to dominate the area from the Great Lakes to the Hudson River.\n\nThe relationship between the Dutch and the Indigenous tribes was generally peaceful as both groups benefited from the trade arrangements. However, farmers of New Amsterdam, the settlement at the mouth of the Hudson River, clashed many times with the local tribes as they expanded their territory. In 1655, the Indigenous people attacked New Amsterdam itself but failed to push back the Dutch.\n\nThe English take control of New Netherland\n\nAs early as the 1640s, English Puritans had begun to settle on Long Island. Then in March of 1664, ignoring all Dutch claims to the area, the English King Charles II gave the entire region between the Connecticut and Delaware rivers to his brother James, Duke of York. When the English brought an invasion fleet to New Amsterdam, the Dutch gave up the territory without a fight.\n\nThe agreement made gave James (who would become King of England in 1685) complete control over the territory. The English and Dutch settlers accounted for most of the population of the new colony, now called New York.\n\nIt also included sizeable populations of Germans, French, Scandinavians, and Africans. Recognizing the diversity of the population, the Duke of York's officials were cautious in their efforts to enforce English authority. The English maintained Dutch forms of local government, and Dutch land titles were upheld.\n\nThe English guaranteed religious tolerance by allowing each town to decide their religious or church affiliation with their taxes. The Dutch were also allowed to keep their legal practices and laws.\n\nThe colony was governed by a single governor until, in 1683, the Duke allowed for an elected legislature. This approach meant the English takeover had minimal effect on the colony. Its population grew slowly, reaching 18,000 by 1698.\n\nIn 1664, when the Duke of York gained control of New Netherland, he also regranted a large portion of land between the Hudson and Delaware rivers to Sir George Carteret and John Lord Berkeley, who founded the colony of New Jersey.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSir Carteret’s shares in the New Jersey colony were all purchased by Quakers seeking refuge from persecution in England. Who were the Quakers and what did they believe?\n\nQuakers are members of a Christian movement called the Religious Society of Friends, which was founded around 1650.\n\nQuakers believe there is no need for an intermediary between the individual and God.\n\nThey have no formally trained clergy and allow both men and women to discuss God’s word openly.\n\nThese two facts made the Quakers, compared to most other religions in England at the time, religious radicals.\n\nThe Quakers obtained their colony in 1681 when King Charles II granted the region between Maryland and New York to William Penn, one of the group’s most influential members. William Penn held the colony as an individual proprietorship, meaning he had sole authority over the territory and profit of all land sales. The vast property holdings earned profits for his descendants until the American Revolution.\n\nPenn offered land grants to all peoples, tolerance for all religions, guaranteed a right to bail, a right to a trial by jury, and pledged to establish a legislative assembly. His offer was attractive, and the population there boomed.\n\nThe city of Philadelphia drew merchants and artisans from all over Europe. Pennsylvania’s lands were plentiful and fertile, and the colony soon began exporting flour and other foodstuffs to the Caribbean and Europe.\n\nDelaware\n\nThe territory that would become the colony of Delaware was originally inhabited by the Indigenous people of the Leni Lenape, Nanticoke, and Assateague tribes.\n\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to attempt to settle in the region in 1631 but were unsuccessful due to conflicts with the Indigenous tribes. By 1638, both the Dutch and the Swedes had successfully established settlements along the Delaware River and Bay. In 1655, the Dutch took control of the Swedish settlements in the southern areas of the territory. When the Dutch ceded control of New Netherland to the English in 1664, they also ceded control of the Delaware territory.\n\nNew Sweden: The colonial experiment that failed\n\nIn 1637, Sweden, seeing how fur trade and tobacco cultivation in the New World began to benefit England economically, formed the New Sweden Company. Its aim was to establish a settlement in the New World to make Sweden a dominant world power.\n\nThe New Sweden Company hired Peter Minuit, who had established New Netherland: he had the experience to navigate the territories on the east coast to establish a colony between New Netherland and the English claims in Virginia.\n\nThe Swedish settlers landed in the New World near the mouth of the Delaware River in the spring of 1638 and constructed Fort Christina. They were able to develop friendly relations with the local Algonquin Peoples and traded for corn, beans, wild game, and other commodities to assist them through their first year in the New World.\n\nEarly attempts to expand caused friction with the Dutch in the area, but neither settlement had enough soldiers to act. For a while in 1641, they even joined together to forcibly remove a small colony of English out of the area.\n\nThere was close to a decade of stability under the Governorship of Johan Printz, but by 1651, Swedish control began to decline as the colony was not producing the revenue Sweden expected. Between 1648 and 1653, Sweden sent no supply ships to the territory due to a war between Sweden and the Netherlands in Europe.\n\nIn 1647, the Dutch sent a governor to the colony: Peter Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant and Printz clashed over control of the colony, and the Swedes eventually abandoned their northern claims to the colony and retreated to Fort Christina.\n\nIn 1655, Stuyvesant attacked the remaining Swedes with a force of more than three hundred soldiers and ships. This conquest ended New Sweden and Sweden did not attempt any new claims in the New World.\n\nIn 1682, the land was given to William Penn as a part of the land grant for the colony of Pennsylvania, and became known as the “three lower counties of Pennsylvania.” The counties did however have a separate colonial legislature than that of Pennsylvania, allowing them to send delegates to the First and Second Continental Congresses during the American Revolution.\n\nThe counties remained a part of Pennsylvania until 1776 when governmental control of Pennsylvania over the three counties was removed, and the colony of Delaware was established."
