        "text": "Georgia\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1732\n\nFounded By:\n\nJames Oglethorpe\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIn 1732, James Oglethorpe was given a charter from King George II to create a new colony which he would name Georgia. This was located between South Carolina and Florida. It had two main purposes: to serve as a place where debtors in prison could go to start anew and it served as a barrier against Indian raids from Florida.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nIn 1733, a group of settlers joined Oglethorpe to found Savannah, Georgia (the largest city).\n\nGeorgia began with the intention to have no slavery. However, when it became a royal colony in 1752, plantations and slavery became a major part of the Georgian economy.\n\nGeorgia was in the first group of states to ratify the new Constitution after the Revolutionary War ended. However, Georgia was the last of the 13 original colonies to be created!\n\nImportant People:\n\nKing George II\n\nJames Oglethorpe\n\nDelaware\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1638\n\nFounded By:\n\nPeter Minuit\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nPeter Minuit was Dutch and formed New Sweden as part of New Netherland. King Charles II of England gave his brother James New Netherland as a gift. James demanded and received its surrender. James renamed New Sweden to Delaware in honor of Virginia's first governor Lord De La Warr. Early settlers were Dutch traders.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nDelaware was a part of the Pennsylvania Colony until 1703.\n\nThe colony was governed by Pennsylvania until the Revolutionary War.\n\nWilmington is the county seat of New Castle County and one of the major cities in the Delaware Valley metropolitan area. Wilmington, Delaware’s largest city, was named by Proprietor Thomas Penn after his friend Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, who was prime minister in the reign of George II of Great Britain.​​\n\nImportant People:\n\nPeter Minuit\n\nJames, the Duke of York\n\nCharles II, King of England\n\nRhode Island\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1636\n\nFounded By:\n\nRoger Williams\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nRoger Williams was banished by the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his beliefs in separation of church and state. He fled and lived with the Narragansett Indians and formed Providence in 1636.\n\nAnne Hutchinson was also banished for speaking out against the Church in Massachusetts Bay. She formed Portsmouth.\n\nTwo other settlements arose, and all four joined together with permission from England to form Providence Plantations – later called Rhode Island.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nOfficially the name is The State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. Rhode Island is the smallest state in area, the eighth least populated state, but the second most densely populated state of the 50 US states behind New Jersey.\n\nProvidence is the capital and most populous city in Rhode Island.\n\nImportant People:\n\nRoger Williams\n\nAnne Hutchinson\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Colony Founded:\n\n1653\n\nFounded By:\n\n8 nobles from Virginia\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIn 1653, some Virginians settled in what would become North Carolina. In 1663, King Charles II issued a royal charter to eight nobles to settle the area south of Virginia mainly for tobacco farms. They created Carolina and included the previous settlement. However, because of internal problems, the crown took over the colony and formed North and South Carolina out of it in 1729.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nThis was a collection of disparate settlers which often led to internal problems and disputes.\n\nThe colony was one of the last hold outs to ratify the Constitution – after it had already gone into effect, and the government had been established.\n\nThe lost colony of Roanoke was located in what is now North Carolina.\n\nThe capital of North Carolina is Raleigh and its largest city is Charlotte.\n\nNew York\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1664\n\nFounded By:\n\nDuke of York\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIn 1664, James, the Duke of York, received control of New Netherland, a trading post at the mouth of the Hudson River. The name of the colony was changed to New York in honor of the Duke.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nThe Albany Congress occurred at Albany, New York in 1754 to help unite the colonies for defense against the Iroquois Confederacy.\n\nThe Federalist Papers were published in New York newspapers to sway voters to accept the new constitution.\n\nNew York was the eleventh state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nNew York City has been the most populous city in the United States since 1790. New York City was always the most populous city in the colony of New York.\n\nImportant People:\n\nJames, Duke of York\n\nThomas Dongan\n\nAlexander Hamilton\n\nPeter Minuit\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1682\n\nFounded By:\n\nWilliam Penn\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nWilliam Penn founded Pennsylvania with a land grant that was owed to his deceased Father. His goal was to create a colony that allowed for freedom of religion due to his desire to protect himself and fellow Quakers from persecution.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nThe colony was well-advertised and by 1700 was the third biggest and richest colony in the New World.\n\nThe capital is Harrisburg. The largest city is Philadelphia.\n\nPenn allowed for a representative assembly elected by landowners.\n\nFreedom of worship and religion was granted to all citizens.\n\nVirginia\n\nYear Founded:\n\nJamestown was founded in 1607 but in 1624 Virginia was created as a royal colony that included the original Jamestown settlement.\n\nFounded By:\n\nThe London Company founded Virginia during the reign of James I (1566-1625).\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nJamestown, colonial Virginia’s largest city, was originally founded mainly from a desire to gain wealth and to a lesser extent to convert the natives to Christianity. Virginia became a royal colony in 1624 when King James I revoked the charter of the bankrupt Virginia Company. He felt threatened by the representative assembly known as the House of Burgesses. His timely death in 1625 ended his plans of disbanding the assembly.\n\nSignificance:\n\nFirst permanent English settlement in the New World at Jamestown.\n\nIt provided a source of fertile land and great wealth to England in the form of the cash crop, tobacco.\n\nWith the House of Burgesses, America saw the first institutional representative self-government.\n\nImportant People:\n\nCaptain John Smith\n\nPocahontas\n\nChief Powhatan\n\nJohn Rolfe\n\nNathaniel Bacon\n\nMaryland\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1634\n\nFounded By:\n\nLord Baltimore (Cecil Calvert)\n\nMotivation for Founding the Maryland Colony:\n\nLord Baltimore (the largest city was named in his honor) was motivated both by the desire to create a refuge for Catholics who were still being persecuted in England. Lord Baltimore also wanted to make money from his gift from the king.\n\n​\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nMaryland was a proprietorship which means that the proprietor had executive authority.\n\nTobacco was very profitable for the colony.\n\nReligious freedom for different sects of Christianity was widespread, especially after the passage of the Act of Toleration in 1649 which allowed for toleration to all Christians. Maryland eventually became known as a 'haven for Catholics'.\n\nImportant People:\n\nLord Baltimore\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1623\n\nFounded By:\n\nJohn Mason\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nNew Hampshire was a planned colony. The land in the New World was granted to Captain John Mason who lived in Hampshire County, England. He sent settlers to the new territory to create a fishing colony. However, John Mason died before ever seeing where he had spent a considerable amount of money building towns and defenses.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nThis colony was part of Massachusetts at one time until England granted Massachusetts a royal charter in 1679.\n\nTheir ratification (they were the ninth) of the Constitution assured its passage.\n\nManchester is the largest city in New Hampshire, the tenth largest city in New England, and the largest city in northern New England.\n\nImportant People:\n\nCaptain John Mason\n\nGovernor Sir John Wentworth\n\nConnecticut\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1636.\n\nFounded By:\n\nThomas Hooker and a group of Massachusetts colonists.\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIndividuals from the Massachusetts colony moved to what would become Connecticut because they were looking for more freedom and financial opportunities.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nPequot War - 1636-1637 - This 'war' was fought between the settlers in Connecticut and the Pequot Indians. By the end of the war, the Pequot Indians were decimated.\n\nBridgeport is the most populous (largest) city but Hartford is the state capital.\n\nThe Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were created in 1639. Many believe that this written Constitution would become the basis for the later United States Constitution.\n\nImportant People:\n\nThomas Hooker\n\nJonathan Trumbell\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1663\n\nFounded By:\n\nEight nobles from Virginia.\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIn 1663, King Charles II issued a royal charter to eight nobles to settle the area south of North Carolina mainly for growing rice and indigo. They created Carolina and included the previous settlement. However, because of internal problems, the crown took over the colony and formed North Carolina and South Carolina out of it in 1729. Colonial South Carolina’s largest city was Charleston, a port city in the south.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nOne of the wealthiest colonies.\n\nThe first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation.\n\nMore Revolutionary War battles were fought in this colony than any other colony.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nYear Founded:\n\n1664\n\nFounded By:\n\nLord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nIn 1664, James, the Duke of York, received control of New Netherland. He granted land to two of his friends, Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, that would become New Jersey. The two advertised and promised settlers many benefits for colonizing including representative government and freedom of religion. The colony quickly grew.\n\nQuakers eventually purchased both of their charters and created East and West Jersey which were joined by the crown in 1702.\n\nSignificant Events:\n\nNew Jersey was the third state to ratify the Constitution.\n\nTrenton is the state capital. Newark is the state’s largest city.\n\nNew Jersey was the first to ratify the Bill of Rights.\n\nNew Jersey was the last northern state to ban slavery.\n\nImportant People:\n\nJames, Duke of York\n\nLord Berkeley\n\nSir George Carteret\n\nMassachusetts\n\nYear Founded: 1630\n\nFounded By: John Winthrop and other Puritans\n\nMotivation for Founding:\n\nThe Puritans wanted to create a colony where they would be free to practice their religion. In 1629, King Charles I began to take action against the Puritans. John Winthrop, who had previously not been associated with the company decided to join and help colonize the Massachusetts Bay colony. He would later become its governor.\n\nSignificance:\n\nJohn Winthrop gave a speech while aboard the Arbella in which he said, \"For we must Consider that we shall be as a City upon a Hill, the eyes of all people are upon us; so that if we shall deal falsely with our god in this work we have undertaken and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world, we shall open the mouths of enemies to speak evil of the ways of god and all professors for God’s sake....\"\n\nThese words embody the spirit of the Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. While they immigrated to the New World to be able to freely practice their religion, they did not espouse freedom of religion for other settlers.\n\nIn 1691, Plymouth Colony would become part of the larger Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nImportant People:\n\nJohn Endecott - First Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Was governor for 16 years. Endecott was a staunch Puritan who persecuted those who held opposing views.\n\nJohn Winthrop - Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony for 12 years. His 'City Upon a Hill' speech (given in Boston, the state’s largest city) has inspired many politicians throughout the years including John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan."
