        "text": "The 13 colonies of what became the United States of America can be divided into three geographic areas: the New England, Middle, and Southern colonies. The New England colonies were the northernmost of the colonies: New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. The other nine colonies were New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware (the Middle colonies) and Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia (the Southern colonies). Areas of the New England colonies were among the first that Europeans settled.\n\nThe Pilgrims were the early settlers of New England. They founded Plymouth, in what is now Massachusetts, in 1620. The Pilgrims were fleeing religious persecution in England. Many of them wanted to “separate” from England’s official church, the Church of England (the Anglican church). In 1630 the Puritans founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony. The Puritans also had differences with the Church of England. However, they wanted to make reforms to the church rather than to separate from it.\n\nThe Pilgrims found life in the colonies challenging. In the first year of settlement at Plymouth, nearly half of them died. They were not skilled at hunting and fishing, and they suffered from malnutrition and disease. Over time, however, the colonists learned to live off the land. Some received help from Indian tribes. By the 1700s the colonists had established towns and small cities.\n\nThe Puritans followed strict moral and religious rules. If people did not live according to the rules, they were treated harshly or expelled from the settlement. Some Puritans disagreed with these policies, so they left Massachusetts to found new settlements. The Reverend Thomas Hooker and his followers left Massachusetts and founded Hartford, Connecticut, in 1636. That same year Roger Williams founded the town of Providence and the colony of Rhode Island. The Puritans had banished him in 1635 in part for his religious beliefs. Providence hence became a place for Baptists, Quakers, and others to express publicly their religious beliefs.\n\nIn the New England colonies families often kept small farms to provide food for themselves. All the members of each family shared in the work. The men planted crops, built fences, and butchered livestock. They also often hunted and fished to feed their families. The women milked the cows, gathered eggs, and preserved food for winter. They raised the children and did household chores such as cooking, sewing clothes, and making candles and soap. Boys worked with their fathers, and girls helped their mothers.\n\nThe area’s cold climate and rocky landscape made large-scale farming difficult. Many New Englanders therefore made a living through trade, seafaring, or fishing. They used lumber from the abundant forests to build ships. The colonists used the ships for fishing and for trade with Europe, Africa, and the West Indies. New Englanders eventually gave up on agricultural pursuits and began raising livestock. Meat products, fish, and lumber were among the valuable exports."
