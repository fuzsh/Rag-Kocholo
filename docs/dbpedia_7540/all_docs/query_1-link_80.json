        "text": "The Great Seal of 1751\n\nIn the year of George II., A.D. 1751, an act was passed which provides that a certain silver seal in the then Governors custody, with the arms of the King of Great Britain engraved thereon and the inscription Delaware around it, was, by an act establishing a Great Seal for this government, directed to be the Great Seal of Government in these Counties and Territories- and whereas upon receiving the said Seal it is found that the inscription Dellovvare is thereon cut around the same instead of the word Delaware, in the said act mentioned; therefore for presenting any doubt or controversaries that may arise by reason thereof; it was enacted by the Hon. James Hamilton Esqr.; with his Majestys Royal approbabtion Lieut. Governor and Commander in Chief of Counties of New Castle, Kent and Sussex, upon Delaware, and province of Pennsylvania, by and with the advice and consent of the Representatives of the freemen of the Said Counties in General Assembly met; and by the authority of the same it was directed that Jehu Curtis, Benjamn Chew and Abraham Wyncoops, Gentlemen, or any two of them are hereby authorized to provide at the expense of this Government, with all possible speed, a silver Seal, to be made of the diameter of two inches, to be engraved with the Arms of the King of Great Bitain and an inscription of words, COUNTIES ON DELAWARE, and the figures 1751, around the same; which shall be the Great Seal of this Government; and any two of the above named persons shall cause the Great Seal now in use to be broken and defaced in their presence.\n\nIt would appear, then, that in the year 1751 the first great seal of the Three Counties on Delaware was provided.\n\nThe Great Seal of 1776\n\nThis seal remained unchanged until In the Constitution or System of Government agreed to and resolved upon by the Representatives of te Delaware State in full Convention, which state was formerly styled, the Government of the Counties of New Castle, Kent and Susses upon Delaware, the said Representatives being chosen by the freemen of the said State for that express purpose (Article XIX), it is declared\n\nthat the Legislative Council and Assembly shall have the power of making the Great Seal of this State, which shall be kept by the President, or in his absence by the Vice-President, to be used by them as occasion may require. It shall be called the Great Seal of the Delaware State, and it shall be affixed to all Laws and Commissions[6]\n\nThis was the constitution adopted September 20, 1776.\n\nThe proceedings connected with the adoption of the device for the Great Seal of the State of Delaware were as follows:\n\n October 30th, 1776. The House Assembly requested the Council to appoint a committee to confer with the committee of the House on the subject matter of making a Great Seal of the State; and withdrew.\n\nThe Council, taking the same into consideration, resolved, that Messrs. Sykes and Von Dyke be appointed a Committee to confer with a committee of the House of Assembly on the subject of forming a device and making a Great Seal of State. Nov. 2nd. 1776. The Report of the Committee on a device for a Great Seal, was read in the House, and reported to the Council as follows:\n\nResolved, that a committee of one member from each House be apponted to procure, as soon as possible a silver Seal of the Diameter of three inches, and of a cicular form, and that there be engraved, Britania upon the Right side thereof, and upon the left side opposite to her, Liberty in the usual shape, with a label proceeding from Britaniato Liberty in these words, Go to America; and there be engraven on the top, the shape of a book, having these words thereon, The Bill of Rights; and at the bottom another Book, having these words thereon, The System of Government, and that there shall be an inscription around the same, near the edge or extremity thereof in the followng Capital letters, THE GREAT SEAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, with the figures 1776. That Mr McKean be appointed on the part of this House, for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nOn motion, Resoved, that Mr. Sykes be appointed on the part of the Council to procure a Great Seal of the State as aforesaid.\n\nJanuary 16th , 1777. Mr Sykes, the Committee appointed on the part of the Council to procure a Great Seal, agreeably to the Resolution of this House of November 2nd 1776, made the following Report; The Committee to get a skillful engraver to make a Great Seal for this State, which was agreed upon by both Houses, now Report, that they could procure no person capable of executing the work at this time, being engaged in other very important business for the safety of the Country. That upon consulting an ingenious gentleman in the Art of Heraldry, your Committee are of the opinion that the Great Seal agreed upon would be more suitable for a medal, than the Seal of State; and therefore submit the same to the consideration of both Houses; which having been considered to the satisfaction of the Council, the Committee was discharged, this was agreed to by the House.\n\nJanuary 13th, 1777. In the House of Assembly Messrs. Robinson and McKean were appointed a Committee to confer with a Committee of the Council on the subject of a device for a Great Seal of the State; and also to fix upon a seal which shall be used pro tempore, until the Great Seal of the State be agreed upon by both Houses, shall be made.\n\nThe seal of New Castle County was decided upon and used as a Great Seal after the Declaration of Independence. This seal was afterwards captured and carried away by the British; and not having been recovere at the time of the meeting of the Legislature, in 1777, it was resolved that the ancient seal of the County of Kent, dated 1683, be the Great Seal of the State, pro tempore, until the New Seal be prepared and delivered to the Commander-in-Chief of the State; JohnMcKinley, President of the State, being held a prisoner by theBritish, Messrs. Cantwell and Wiltbank were appointed a Committee of the Council to confer with a Committee of the House of Assembly on the subject of forming a seal.\n\nJanuary 17th 1777. The above Committee brought in their Report; which was accepted and adopted; and it was Resolved N.C.D. that Mr. McKean be a committee to employ a skillful workman to make a silver seal of the Diameter of three inches, and of circular form, and that an Ox of full stature in a shield, with a river dividing the wheat sheaf and ear of Indian Corn from that which is to be cut on the nether part of the shield below the River; that the supporters be an American Soldier under arms, on the right, and a husbandman with a hoe in his hand on the left; and that a ship be the Crest; and that there shall be an inscription around the same near te edge or extremity thereof in the words following, in Capital letters: THE GREAT SEAL OF THE DELAWARE STATE with the figure 1777, which shall, from and after the delivery thereof to the President and Commander in Chief, be the Great Seal and deemed the Arms of of this State.\n\nResolved, That the Seal of the County of New Castle shall be deemed and held to be the Great Seal of this State pro tempore until the above described Great Seal is made and delivered to the President and Commander-in-Chief, and no longer.\n\nThe Constitution of 1792 recognizes a Great Seal (and consequently the achievement too) as then existing.\n\nGreat Seal of 1793\n\nIn 1793 it was enacted that the seal heretofore used (to wit, the seal decided in the Constitution of 1776) shall be, and is hereby declared to be the Great Seal of the State, and it was also enacted, February 2, 1793, That the Secretary of State shall cause a Great Seal to be made of such device as the Governor shall approve, which shall hereafter be used for the same purpose for which the said seal, herein first mentioned is directed to be used; and when such New Great Seal shall be made, the seal first mentioned aforesaid shall be broken, and no longer used.\n\nOn this seal the arms and crest as adopted in 1777 was engraved within a garland and the date MDCCXCIII. The legend read: GREAT SEAL OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE. At the same time the farmer and the soldier wee eliminated from the seal.\n\nThis seal was used until the adoption of the seal of 1847; it was enacted that the Secretary of State be empowered to procure a New Seal, to be used as the Great Seal.\n\nGreat Seal of 1847\n\nThe seal of 1847 was to be emblazoned like the seal of 1777. Its legend however was the same as on the seal of 1793.\n\nWhen it was adopted it was stipulated:\n\nWhen produced the Secretary shall break and destroy the Seal now used (to wit the Seal of 1793) as the Great Seal of the State of Delaware.\n\nFrom: Dictionnaire encyclopédique Trousset, Paris, 1886 - 1891\n\nThe Great Seal of 1907 [7]\n\nAn act of the Delaware legislature, approved on February 25, 1907, says:\n\nSection 1. That the Secretary of State be, and he is hereby authorized to procure a new seal and press, to be used as the Great Seal of the State of Delaware, which said seal shall not exeed three inches in diameter, and shall be emblazoned as follows: Party per fess, or and argent, the first charged with a Garb (wheat sheaf) in bend dexter; and an ear of maize in bend sinister; both proper; the second charged with an ox statant ruminating, proper, Fess, wavy azure. Supporters, on the dexter a husbandman with hilling hoe, on the sinister a rifleman armed and accoutred, at ease; Crest, on a wreath azure and argent, a ship under full sail, proper; with the words, Great Seal of the State of Delaware and also the words Liberty and Independence, engraved thereon. [8]\n\nAs far as can be ascertained, the first Great Seal of this State (then called the Three Counties on Delaware) was provided by enactment in 1751. The next Great Seal was provided by Constitution of September 20, 1776. The third Great Seal was ordered in 1793 and the fourth and last, in 1847.\n\nInscription\n\nThe surrounding inscription reads: \"Great Seal of the State of Delaware\" and the dates 1704, 1776 and 1787.\n\n1704:The Lower Counties on the Delaware established their own General Assembly in 1704;\n\n1776:Separation Day, June 15, 1776, was the day the colonial General Assembly declared Delaware an independent state;\n\n1787:Delaware Day, December 7, 1787, was the day Delaware ratified the United States Constitution, being the first state to do so.\n\nHistory of Changes\n\nThe seal was originally adopted in 1777 with minor changes made in 1793, 1847, and 1907. The current version was adopted in 2004.\n\n1793:The figures of the farmer and the soldier were eliminated from the seal.\n\n1847:The farmer and the soldier were restored and the motto ,Liberty and Independence, was added on a ribbon at their feet. The motto was provided by the Society of the Cincinnati, a hereditary organization of Revolutionary War officers formed in 1783.\n\n1907: The seal was \"modernized\" and \"THE DELAWARE STATE\" was changed to \"THE STATE OF DELAWARE\".\n\nDelaware House Bill 128\n\nOn April 9, 2003, Representative Wayne Smith introduced House Bill No. 128 in to the Delaware House of Representatives. This bill suggested that the dates representing the physical changes to the seal be replaced by dates \"...that have more substantial historic significance.\n\n\" House Bill No. 128 proposed that the years 1704, 1776 and 1787 should replace the current dates on the seal and indicated the historical significance of the replacement dates.\n\n1704 - The year that Delaware established its First General Assembly.\n\n1776 - The year that the colonies declared independence from Great Britain.\n\n1787 - The year that Delaware became \"The First State\" to ratify the United States Constitution.\n\nThe bill was approved by the Delaware House of Representatives on April 29, 2004.\n\nOn June 17, 2004, sixth grader Yaxier Torres and seven of his classmates from Bayard Elementary School in Wilmington, entered Legislative Hall in Dover. They were there to speak on behalf of the date changes proposed by House Bill No. 128, explaining why the current dates on the seal were not relevant to Delaware history and confused them\n\nThe Delaware House of Representatives and the Delaware Senate had both approved House Bill No. 128\n\nOn June 28, 2004, Governor Ruth Ann Minner signed the legislation that changed the dates on the Great Seal of the State of Delaware.\n\nDelaware Law\n\nTITLE 29\n\nState Government\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\nCHAPTER 3.
