They are found in the Special: namespace, a virtual namespace whose pages lack corresponding talk pages. They are not written in wikitext and cannot be directly edited but elements of their pages can sometimes be edited through corresponding pages in the MediaWiki namespace. If you make a normal redirect to a special page, the redirect will not be immediately followed (though special pages can be targets of soft redirects), and directly creating any pages beginning with the Special: prefix is also not possible.\n\nSpecial pages often take parameters. Sometimes these can be supplied after a slash (as in Special:Log/block); in other cases an index.php call is used; for example https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:RecentChanges&days=3&limit=10. Also, the content of most special pages depends on preferences that have been set by the user, e.g. classic or enhanced Recent Changes, the number of titles in Recent Changes and the watchlist, etc.\n\nA directory of special pages available for the current user can be accessed from Special:SpecialPages, which is found in the sidebar of every page on Wikipedia in the Tools section.\n\nAlthough special pages are not themselves editable, they generally contain standard text which is modifiable (although only by administrators). To find the right portion of text, append ?uselang=qqx to the special page URL, or append &uselang=qqx instead if the URL already contains a ?. This will reveal message names in parentheses. Then, go to that name in the MediaWiki namespace. For example, reveals \"(booksources-summary)\", so MediaWiki:Booksources-summary is used on that page. To propose a modification, leave an {{edit fully-protected}} request on the talk page of the relevant MediaWiki page. An administrator will make the change if it seems appropriate.\n\nBy function\n\nGeneral information\n\nSpecial:AllMessages (System messages): displays all pages in the MediaWiki namespace.

A starting point can be given as a parameter, e.g. Special:AllPages/T (pages in the main namespace, from \"T\"), Special:AllPages/Template: (pages in the Template: namespace, from the start). For the order in which pages are listed, see Help:Alphabetical order.\n\nSpecial:Categories: shows an alphabetical list of categories, with numbers of members.\n\nSpecial:CategoryTree: displays categories in a tree structure.\n\nSpecial:ListFiles (File list): list of images and other files uploaded; can be sorted by size or date.
