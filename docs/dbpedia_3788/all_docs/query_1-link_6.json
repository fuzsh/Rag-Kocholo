        "text": "In this topic you will learn about the Performance report that is provided as part of the Analytics module.\n\nAnalytics data is sent automatically by the Brightcove Players, including those provided by the Native Player SDKs. If you are not using a Brightcove Player to deliver Video Cloud videos, you need to instrument the player you are using to send the data to the Data Collector. See the Overview: Data Collection API topic for more details.\n\nTo view the Performance report, open the Analytics module and select Performance from the left side navigation. The report will display a graph showing total video views per day for the time period selected. The dropdown list can be used to select another metric:\n\nVideo Views - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers; for videos with pre-roll ads, a view is not recorded until the video starts to play\n\nVideo Impressions - Number of times a video was loaded and ready for interaction\n\nPlay Requests - The number of times playback was requested - play requests are generated by:\n\nthe viewer initially clicking the play button\n\nthe viewer pausing the video and clicking play to resume playback\n\nan autoplay event\n\nthe viewer scrubbing or clicking on the playback timeline (which pauses and restarts the video automatically)\n\nPlay Rate - The percentage of videos that were loaded that were actually played (video views / video impressions)\n\nViewed Minutes - Number of minutes the video was watched\n\nEngagement Score - The average percent watched per video view (calculated by adding all the percentage watched divided by the number of video views)\n\nDaily Unique Viewers - Calculated using the IP address and user agent of viewers. Brightcove made the decision not to use a 3rd party cookie because cookies are increasingly being blocked by browsers. Daily Unique Viewers is available at the account or video level; this metric is not available when filtering by a video (or anything else). Brightcove also provides the ability to base unique viewers on the value you provide instead of their IP address. For more information, see the Analytics Event Tracking developer document.\n\nVideo Bandwidth - Includes bandwidth for the content delivered including video, images, text and audio tracks. Note that bandwidth data is delayed by 3-5 days.\n\nTotal Bandwidth - Includes Video Bandwidth and the bandwidth generated by player loads. Note that bandwidth data is delayed by 3-5 days.\n\nBy default, the report will display performance data for all stream types. If your account is enabled for Brightcove Live, you can choose to view performance data for all videos, VOD assets or live assets. Click the Stream type pill to make a selection.\n\nThe report switcher below the chart can be used to quickly switch to another report.\n\nThe dropdown list to the right of the report switcher can be used to select a report dimension. The bottom of the report has controls which let you select how many rows should be displayed and for navigating to other pages.\n\nThe following dimensions are available with the Performance Report:[1-1]\n\nVideo\n\nPlayer\n\nSource of Traffic\n\nDisplay Domain\n\nCountry\n\nDevice\n\nDevice Type\n\nDevice OS\n\nDevice Manufacturer\n\nBrowser Type\n\nDay\n\nViewer[1-2]\n\nNotes:\n\n[1-1] The available dimensions will change based upon the report that is selected.\n\n[1-2] If the Viewer dimension has been enabled for the account. Also note that for the dimension Viewer, Today is not supported as a date range.\n\nCompare to previous period\n\nSelecting the Compare to previous period checkbox will add an overlay dashed line graph representing the data for the previous period.\n\nThe previous period is based upon what is currently selected for the report date range. For example, if you select a date range of last 7 days, the previous period will be 2 weeks ago. When comparing trends over weeks, it is best to select date ranges that cover complete weeks. For example, if you select a date starting on a Monday, set the end date to a Sunday. If the start date is on a Friday, set the end date to a Thursday. You can also mouse over both the bars and dashed line to see the date and corresponding values.\n\nPerformance report details\n\nThe first column that appears in the body of the report will vary based upon the report dimension that is selected (video name, player name, country, device type, etc.). All reports will display the following data:\n\nVideo Views - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers\n\nVideo Impressions - The number of times the video was loaded into a player and ready for interaction\n\nPlay Requests - The number of times playback was requested either by a user pressing the play button or an auto-play event\n\nPlay Rate - The percentage of users that played the video after it was loaded (Video Views divided by Video Impressions)\n\nViewed Minutes - Total number of minutes the video was viewed\n\nEngagement Score - The average percent watched per video view (calculated by adding all the percentage watched divided by the number of Video Views)\n\nThe Video and Day dimensions will also display the Daily Unique Viewers which is the average daily unique viewers for the time period selected. This is calculated using the IP address and user agent of viewers.\n\nThe Viewer dimension will display the Total Time Watched, the number of Videos Completed (number of videos where the viewer watched at least 90%) and the Last Viewed date.\n\nTraffic Sources\n\nWhen viewing the Performance by Source of Traffic, possible traffic sources are:\n\nReferral - User followed a link to the video\n\nDirect - User typed the link directly or the referrer was not able to be determined\n\nSecure search - User logged in with a Google account, performed a search and clicked on a result (either paid or organic; search information is not included in this case)\n\nOrganic search - User performed a search and clicked on a result to get to the video\n\nPaid search - User performed a search and clicked on a paid result to get to the video\n\nDevice Types\n\nSeveral of the Performance reports allow viewing by device type.

The body of the report will display the performance data for each country where videos were viewed. Only countries which have data within the time period selected will be displayed.\n\nClicking the link for any of the countries will display the performance by region or city for the selected country, if you are viewing analytics for the account, not an individual video.\n\nViewing device analytics\n\nWhen the Device dimension is selected, a graph will display the number of video views per day for the time period selected. The body of the report will display the performance data for each Device Type - Device Operating System combination that was used to view a video. Only devices which have data within the time period selected will be displayed.\n\nClicking the link for any of the device types will display the performance by device operating system.\n\nViewing device type analytics\n\nWhen the Device Type dimension is selected, a graph will display the number of video views per day for the time period selected.

Viewer analytics are most useful if you have logged in viewers and therefore can identify them reliably. For information on sending a viewer ID, see theÂ Analytics API documentation.\n\nClicking on a viewer will display the details for the viewer.\n\nExporting report data\n\nReport data can be downloaded as both comma separated values and Excel formats. Note that the export feature saves the data directly from an Analytics API call. The exported data is not manipulated the way the UI data is, and currently contains all of the underlying data in the report, not just the subset of fields the UI shows. Some of the differences between what is shown in the UI vs. the exported data:\n\nDifferent units (minutes vs seconds)\n\nRounding of numbers\n\nThe data export contains both the performance and engagement metrics regardless of where you are in the UI\n\nThe Other/Third Party entry will be exported with no associated video ID or video name\n\nHaving all of the data in the original format from the API allows you to manipulate the data in ways other than what is provided in the UI.\n\nThe export buttons above the graph will export the graph data. Note that the reports support print-friendly style sheets so printing a report or saving to PDF will generate a printer-friendly page."
