        "text": "Types of cards\n\nAdaptive, hero, list, connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, receipt, sign in, and thumbnail cards and card collections are supported in bots for Microsoft Teams. They're based on cards defined by the Bot Framework, but Teams doesn't support all Bot Framework cards and has added some of its own.\n\nBefore you identify the different card types, understand how to create a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card.\n\nCreate a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card\n\nTo create a hero card, thumbnail card, or Adaptive Card from Developer Portal for Teams:\n\nGo to Developer Portal for Teams.\n\nSelect Design and build Adaptive Cards.\n\nSelect New card.\n\nEnter card name and select Save.\n\nSelect one of the cards from Hero Card, Thumbnail Card, or Adaptive Card.\n\nSelect Save.\n\nSelect Send me this card. The card is sent to you as a chat message.\n\nCard examples\n\nYou can find additional information on how to use cards in the documentation for the Bot Builder SDK v3. Code samples are also available in the Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples repository on GitHub. Following are a few card examples:\n\n.NET\n\nAdd cards as attachments to messages.\n\nCards sample code Bot Builder v4.\n\nNode.js\n\nAdd cards as attachments to messages.\n\nCards sample code Bot Builder v4.\n\nCard types\n\nYou can identify and use different types of cards based on your application requirements. The following table shows the types of cards available to you:\n\nCard type Description Adaptive Card This card is highly customizable and can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. Hero card This card typically contains a single large image, one or more buttons, and a small amount of text. List card This card contains a scrolling list of items. Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups This card has a flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images, and actions. Receipt card This card provides a receipt to the user. Signin card This card enables a bot to request that a user signs in. Thumbnail card This card typically contains a single thumbnail image, some short text, and one or more buttons. Card collections This card collection is used to return multiple items in a single response.\n\nFeatures that support different card types\n\nCard type Bots Message extension previews Message extension results Dialogs (referred as task modules in TeamsJS v1.x) Outgoing Webhooks Incoming Webhooks Connectors for Microsoft 365 Groups Adaptive Card âï¸ â âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ â Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups âï¸ â âï¸ â âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ Hero card âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ â âï¸ âï¸ â Thumbnail card âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ â âï¸ âï¸ â List card âï¸ â â â âï¸ âï¸ â Receipt card âï¸ â â â â âï¸ â Sign in card âï¸ â â â â â â\n\nCommon properties for all cards\n\nYou can go through some common properties that are applicable to all cards.\n\nNote\n\nHero and thumbnail cards with multiple actions are automatically split into multiple cards in a carousel layout.\n\nInline card images\n\nThe card can contain an inline image by including a link to the publicly available image. For performance purposes, it's highly recommended you host the image on a public Content Delivery Network (CDN).\n\nImages are scaled up or down in size to maintain the aspect ratio for covering the image area. Images are then cropped from center to achieve the appropriate aspect ratio for the card.\n\nImages must be at most 1024 Ã 1024 and in PNG, JPEG, or GIF format. Animated GIF isn't supported.\n\nThe following table provides the properties of inline card images:\n\nProperty Type Description url URL HTTPS URL to the image. alt String Accessible description of the image.\n\nNote\n\nIf a card includes an image URL that is redirected before the final image, the redirect in image URL is not supported. This occurs for images shared on the public cloud.\n\nButtons\n\nButtons are shown stacked at the bottom of the card. Button text is always on a single line and is truncated if the text exceeds the button width. Any additional buttons beyond the maximum number supported by the card aren't shown.\n\nFor more information, see card actions.\n\nCard formatting\n\nFor more information on text formatting in cards, see card formatting.\n\nAfter identifying the common properties for all cards, you can now work with Adaptive Cards, which help you increase engagement and efficiency by adding your actionable content directly into the apps you use.\n\nAdaptive Card\n\nAn Adaptive Card is a customizable card that can contain any combination of text, speech, images, buttons, and input fields. For more information, see Adaptive Cards.\n\nSupport for Adaptive Cards\n\nThe following table provides the features that support Adaptive Cards:\n\nBots in Teams Message extensions Connectors Bot Framework âï¸ âï¸ â âï¸\n\nExample of Adaptive Card\n\nThe following code shows an example of an Adaptive Card:\n\n{ \"contentType\": \"application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive\", \"content\": { \"$schema\": \"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json\", \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"body\": [ { \"type\": \"Container\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"Publish Adaptive Card schema\", \"weight\": \"bolder\", \"size\": \"medium\" }, { \"type\": \"ColumnSet\", \"columns\": [ { \"type\": \"Column\", \"width\": \"auto\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"Image\", \"url\": \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3647943215/d7f12830b3c17a5a9e4afcc370e3a37e_400x400.jpeg\", \"size\": \"small\", \"style\": \"person\" } ] }, { \"type\": \"Column\", \"width\": \"stretch\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"Matt Hidinger\", \"weight\": \"bolder\", \"wrap\": true }, { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"spacing\": \"none\", \"text\": \"Created {{DATE(2017-02-14T06:08:39Z, SHORT)}}\", \"isSubtle\": true, \"wrap\": true } ] } ] } ] }, { \"type\": \"Container\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"Now that we have defined the main rules and features of the format, we need to produce a schema and publish it to GitHub. The schema will be the starting point of our reference documentation.\", \"wrap\": true }, { \"type\": \"FactSet\", \"facts\": [ { \"title\": \"Board:\", \"value\": \"Adaptive Card\" }, { \"title\": \"List:\", \"value\": \"Backlog\" }, { \"title\": \"Assigned to:\", \"value\": \"Matt Hidinger\" }, { \"title\": \"Due date:\", \"value\": \"Not set\" } ] } ] } ], \"actions\": [ { \"type\": \"Action.ShowCard\", \"title\": \"Set due date\", \"card\": { \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\", \"body\": [ { \"type\": \"Input.Date\", \"id\": \"dueDate\" } ], \"actions\": [ { \"type\": \"Action.Submit\", \"title\": \"OK\" } ] } }, { \"type\": \"Action.ShowCard\", \"title\": \"Comment\", \"card\": { \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\", \"body\": [ { \"type\": \"Input.Text\", \"id\": \"comment\", \"isMultiline\": true, \"placeholder\": \"Enter your comment\" } ], \"actions\": [ { \"type\": \"Action.Submit\", \"title\": \"OK\" } ] } } ] } }\n\nAdaptive Cards best practices\n\nAdaptive Cards must not display a horizontal scroll. To avoid horizontal scrolls, donât specify a fixed width.\n\nColumnSets\n\nAvoid defining ColumnSets with more than three columns.\n\nDonât use explicit pixel width on more than one column in the set.\n\nWhen using an explicit width, donât specify a value that would make the column use more than 1/4 of the narrowest possible card width (for example, the width of a card in the meeting chat pane or in Copilot).\n\nIn general, 48 pixels is about the maximum explicit width youâd want to use, although there may be exceptions depending on the scenario.\n\nSizing images\n\nWhen using an image inside a ColumnSet with more than one Column, prefer specifying the size of the column that contains the image rather than the image itself (set the imageâs size to âautoâ or âstretchâ).\n\nIf your image isnât in a ColumnSet, itâs generally advisable to set its size to âautoâ or âstretchâ.\n\nIf using an explicit width in pixels, make sure it doesnât exceed 3/4 of the narrowest card width.\n\nWhen using explicit sizing in pixels, either set the width or the height, but not both. Setting only one will ensure your image has the proper aspect ratio.\n\nIn general, only set the width of the image, not the height, although there may be exceptions depending on the scenario.\n\nAdditional information on Adaptive Cards\n\nYou can pass dynamic values in an Adaptive Card using the dollar symbol ($) and curly braces. For more information, see Adaptive Cards Templating.\n\nExample:\n\n{ \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"${titleText}\", \"size\": \"default\", \"weight\": \"bolder\" }\n\nBot Framework reference:\n\nAdaptive Cards Node\n\nAdaptive Card C#\n\nTo know more about Adaptive Cards, see Adaptive Cards.\n\nYou can now work with a hero card, which is a multipurpose card used to visually highlight a potential user selection.\n\nYour bot can mention tags in an Adaptive Card posted into channels. For more information, see Tag mention.\n\nHero card\n\nA card that typically contains a single large image, one or more buttons, and text.\n\nSupport for hero cards\n\nThe following table provides the features that support hero cards:\n\nBots in Teams Message extensions Connectors Bot Framework âï¸ âï¸ â âï¸\n\nProperties of a hero card\n\nThe following table provides the properties of a hero card:\n\nProperty Type Description title Rich text Title of the card.

The list card provides a scrolling list of items.\n\nSupport for list cards\n\nThe following table provides the features that support list cards:\n\nBots in Teams Message extensions Connectors Bot Framework âï¸ â â âï¸\n\nProperties of a list card\n\nThe following table provides the properties of a list card:\n\nProperty Type Description title Rich text Title of the card. Maximum two lines. items Array of list items Set of items applicable to the card. buttons Array of action objects Set of actions applicable to the current card. Maximum 6.\n\nExample of a list card\n\nThe following code shows an example of a list card:\n\n{ \"contentType\": \"application/vnd.microsoft.teams.card.list\", \"content\": { \"title\": \"Card title\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"file\", \"id\": \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/teams/new/Shared%20Documents/Report.xlsx\", \"title\": \"Report\", \"subtitle\": \"teams > new > design\", \"tap\": { \"type\": \"imBack\", \"value\": \"editOnline https://contoso.sharepoint.com/teams/new/Shared%20Documents/Report.xlsx\" } }, { \"type\": \"resultItem\", \"icon\": \"https://cdn2.iconfinder.com/data/icons/social-icons-33/128/Trello-128.png\", \"title\": \"Trello title\", \"subtitle\": \"A Trello subtitle\", \"tap\": { \"type\": \"openUrl\", \"value\": \"http://trello.com\" } }, { \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Manager\" }, { \"type\": \"person\", \"id\": \"JohnDoe@contoso.com\", \"title\": \"John Doe\", \"subtitle\": \"Manager\", \"tap\": { \"type\": \"imBack\", \"value\": \"whois JohnDoe@contoso.com\" } } ], \"buttons\": [ { \"type\": \"imBack\", \"title\": \"Select\", \"value\": \"whois\" } ] } }\n\nConnector card for Microsoft 365 Groups\n\nYou can work with an connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups that provides a flexible layout and is a great way to get useful information. The connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups is supported in Teams, not in Bot Framework. This card provides a flexible layout with multiple sections, fields, images, and actions. This card contains a connector card so that it can be used by bots. For differences between connector cards and the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, see Connector card for Microsoft 365 Groupsd.\n\nSupport for connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups\n\nThe following table provides the features that support connector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups:\n\nBots in Teams Message extensions Connectors Bot Framework âï¸ âï¸ âï¸ â\n\nProperties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups\n\nThe following table provides the properties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups:\n\nProperty Type Description title Rich text Title of the card. Maximum two lines. summary Rich text Required if the card does not contain a text property, otherwise optional. The summary property is typically displayed in the notification pop-up in Teams, as a way to quickly determine what the card is all about.\n\nDo always include a summary.\n\nDon't include the details in the summary. For example, for a Twitter post, a summary might simply read **New tweet from @someuser** without mentioning the content of the tweet itself. text Rich text Text appears under the subtitle. For formatting options, see card formatting. themeColor HEX string Color that overrides the accentColor provided from the application manifest.\n\nFor more information on the properties of the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups, see card fields.\n\nAdditional information on the connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups\n\nConnector cards for Microsoft 365 Groups function properly in Microsoft Teams, including ActionCard actions.\n\nThe important difference between using connector cards from a connector and using connector cards in your bot is the handling of card actions. The following table lists the difference:\n\nConnector Bot The endpoint receives the card payload through HTTP POST. The HttpPOST action triggers an invoke activity that sends only the action ID and body to the bot.\n\nEach connector card can display a maximum of 10 sections, and each section can contain a maximum of five images and five actions.\n\nNote\n\nAny additional sections, images, or actions in a message do not appear.\n\nAll text fields support Markdown and HTML. You can control which sections use Markdown or HTML by setting the markdown property in a message. By default, markdown is set to true. If you want to use HTML instead, set markdown to false.\n\nIf you specify the themeColor property, it overrides the accentColor property in the app manifest.\n\nTo specify the rendering style for activityImage, you can set activityImageType as shown in the following table:\n\nValue Description avatar Default, activityImage is cropped as a circle. article activityImage is displayed as a rectangle and retains its aspect ratio.\n\nFor all other details about connector card properties, see actionable message card reference. The only connector card properties that Teams doesn't support are as follows:\n\nheroImage\n\nhideOriginalBody\n\nstartGroup always treated as true in Teams\n\noriginator\n\ncorrelationId\n\nExample of a connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups\n\nThe following code shows an example of a connector card for Microsoft 365 Groups:\n\n{ \"contentType\": \"application/vnd.microsoft.teams.card.o365connector\", \"content\": { \"@type\": \"MessageCard\", \"@context\": \"http://schema.org/extensions\", \"summary\": \"John Doe commented on Trello\", \"title\": \"Project Tango\", \"sections\": [ { \"activityTitle\": \"John Doe commented\", \"activitySubtitle\": \"On Project Tango\", \"activityText\": \"\\\"Here are the designs\\\"\", \"activityImage\": \"http://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/MSC12_Oscar_002.jpg\" }, { \"title\": \"Details\", \"facts\": [ { \"name\": \"Labels\", \"value\": \"Designs, redlines\" }, { \"name\": \"Due date\", \"value\": \"Dec 7, 2016\" }, { \"name\": \"Attachments\", \"value\": \"[final.jpg](http://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/WIN14_Jan_04.jpg)\" } ] }, { \"title\": \"Images\", \"images\": [ { \"image\":\"http://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/MicrosoftSurface_024_Cafe_OH-06315_VS_R1c.jpg\" }, { \"image\":\"http://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/WIN12_Scene_01.jpg\" }, { \"image\":\"http://connectorsdemo.azurewebsites.net/images/WIN12_Anthony_02.jpg\" } ] } ], \"potentialAction\": [ { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ViewAction\", \"name\": \"View in Trello\", \"target\": [ \"https://trello.com/c/1101/\" ] } ] } }\n\nReceipt card\n\nTeams supports receipt card, which enables a bot to provide a receipt to the user.
