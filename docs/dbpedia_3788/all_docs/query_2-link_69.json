Nowadays, that means including an image or video in your post. According to Social Media Examiner’s Social Media Marketing Industry Report, 80% of marketers use visual images, and 63% use video. You need to upload visual content with your posts, and it needs to be high quality and the right image size for the medium you are using.\n\nThe problem is that changing image sizes for different platforms can be fiddly, particularly if you are design-challenged. Every platform seems to want different sized images. Some prefer horizontal images, others vertical, and some even prefer square images. To help you with your posting, we present our guide to the best image sizes for social media. We cover all the leading social media networks in this guide.\n\nTry our Free Social media Image Resizer Tool\n\nOur Guide to Best Social Media Image Sizes for 2024:\n\nBest Image Sizes for Facebook\n\nFacebook is by far the world’s largest and most active social network. It may no longer be “cool” for teenagers, but it has followers ranging the full gamut of social users. It is also well set up, with a sophisticated advertising system.\n\nWhen you create posts on Facebook, make sure you check how they will look at a user’s feed. You want all your images to look clear and at an appropriate specification for the feed. We’ve all probably seen somebody upload a wrongly sized photo, and the results car often not pretty. Moreover, if you're running campaigns on Facebook, you want to make sure that you're following the best practices and guidelines for Facebook Ad sizes.\n\nFacebook has released official guidelines and for the most important images you’ll upload.\n\nFacebook Profile Picture\n\nYour profile picture is your most essential image. You don’t want to be left as the default silhouette – the person seen as too lazy to upload a profile picture.\n\nYour profile image displays as square, so you should upload a 1:1 square photograph that represents your brand. This should be a photo of yourself for a personal account, but for a business, you want something that clearly represents your business – perhaps your business logo. However, remember that Facebook doesn’t like text to take up more than 20% of an image, so you must be careful if you intend uploading a large text logo.\n\nThe profile image for business pages now sits at the top left of the page – which helps Business Pages stand out from normal personal account profiles.\n\nThe formal image sizes and specifications for Facebook profile pictures are:\n\nMinimum image size: 180 x 180 pixels\n\nActual size used depends on device and usage: 176 x 176 (desktop), 196 x 196 (smartphones), 36 x 36 (feature phones), 32 x 32 (thumbnail)\n\nYour profile picture is located 16 pixels from the left and 176 pixels from the top of your cover photo (on desktop). This is important if you want to create an integrated profile picture/cover photo\n\nCover Photos\n\nA blank cover page is another sign of a Facebook amateur. Another common mistake is trying to shoehorn a photo of the wrong dimensions into acting as your cover page, which either distorts the contents of the image or requires you to crop it undesirably.\n\nThis is the large image that appears at the top of your timeline. Its size gives you creative opportunities. You should use this space to depict something that gives an idea of what you’re like as a person or brand.\n\nThe formal sizes and specifications for Facebook cover photos are:\n\nMinimum size of 400 x 150 pixels, but anything less than 820 x 312 pixels will appear stretched\n\nDisplay size: 820 x 312 pixels (desktop), 640 x 360 pixels (smartphones)\n\nDoesn’t show at all on feature phones\n\nLoads fastest as an sRGB JPG file that's 851 pixels wide, 315 pixels tall and less than 100 kilobytes\n\nFor profile pictures and cover photos with your logo or text, you may get a better result by using a PNG file\n\nSizes and specifications are identical for both business pages and personal profiles\n\nShared Facebook Image\n\nWe all share images on Facebook at some time. These appear on your timeline, and depending on Facebook’s algorithm, they also appear in a selection of your followers’ News Feeds.\n\nObviously, if somebody has already uploaded an image that you want to share you won’t have much control over its essential size and specifications (although you may be able to edit it in photo editing software if it is significantly different from the recommended sizes).\n\nIf you choose to upload the photo yourself, then you should first try and ensure that it meets Facebook’s image guidelines.\n\nThe formal sizes and specifications for shared Facebook images are:\n\nRecommended upload size of 1,200 x 630 pixels\n\nWill appear in feed at a maximum width of 470 pixels (and scale to a max of 1:1)\n\nWill appear on page at a maximum width of 504 pixels (and scale to a max of 1:1)\n\nShared Facebook Link\n\nThis is like the Shared Facebook Image, except the image relates to whatever you are linking to.

Indeed, many users will delete followers on Twitter without a profile picture – it’s an obvious sign on a spam account.\n\nYour profile picture represents you – it is the first thing that people see about you, and it appears beside each tweet you make. An individual should show a picture of him or herself (or something that strongly represents him/her). A business should use its logo (or again a highly representative image).\n\nThe Picture appears at different sizes in different places, so you need to upload an image that works at a range of (square) sizes.\n\nThe formal sizes and specifications for Twitter profile pictures are:\n\nRecommended upload size: 400 x 400 pixels\n\nDisplays: 200 x 200\n\nMaximum file size: 2MB\n\nPermitted image types include .JPG, .GIF, or .PNG\n\nTwitter Header Photo\n\nYour Twitter Header photo is another place where you can show your individuality.

If you want to ensure that everybody sees the most essential parts of your image, horizontally center your content.\n\nWhen you share a link on Twitter, you can set things so that Twitter display’s a Twitter Card (there are quite a few different varieties).

LinkedIn is a professional network for industry leaders, so you are less likely to find images of funny cats or pranks.\n\nLinkedIn Personal Profile Image\n\nLinkedIn also serves a role as a centralized resume for the world’s workers, so profile pictures are more important here than any of the other networks.

The two types of mages appear in similar places (although the logo is square on the Company’s Profile Page).\n\nYou should upload two versions of your logo. The larger one is your standard company logo that appears in the header of your company profile page, and in the “Companies You May Want to Follow” section. The smaller logo is the brand image that shows up when your company is searched.\n\nThe formal sizes and specifications for LinkedIn company logos are:\n\nRecommended upload size: 300 x 300 pixels (large logo), 60 x 60 pixels (small logo)\n\nAspect Ratio: 1:1\n\nMaximum file size: 4MB (large logo), 2MB (small logo)\n\nFile types: .JPG, .GIF, .PNG\n\nLinkedIn Company Cover Images\n\nThe LinkedIn Company Cover image covers an even longer skinnier area than that of a personal profile – it covers the full width of the page.

It’s home to over 518 million blogs and over 166 billion blog posts. It’s also a little different from most other platforms. Its customizable nature makes it attractive, giving users the option of setting their own color scheme and, of course, using images. Tumblr allows you to update three types of images. These include a profile photo, a profile cover image, and a post image. Here are dimensions for each:\n\nTumblr Profile Picture Size\n\nTumblr profile photos appear alongside all posts and comments you make. Recommended image size is 128 x 128 pixels and you use JPG, GIF, PNG or BMP file types.\n\nTumblr Cover Image Size\n\nCover images are common across social media platforms.

Because boards are designed to show a collection of pins, there isn’t a limit to the length of your pin image, but image width must stay 600 pixels at most. This makes Pinterest a great place to share infographics and other lengthier images. Pins all appear as 236 pixel graphics on your Main page and boards, with both instances being scaled to look uniform across the platform. For a quality look, Pinterest recommends an aspect ratio 2:3.\n\nBoard Display Image Size\n\nPinterst boards are what really bring the platform together.
