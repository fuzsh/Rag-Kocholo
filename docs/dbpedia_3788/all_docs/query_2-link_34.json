        "text": "Lights, camera, upload!\n\nWith all the new ways to post photos and videos on Instagram, creating unique visual content can make you feel like you‚Äôre on a production set.\n\nGone are the days of being limited to the 1:1 Instagram aspect ratio ‚Äî aka the traditional square. Now there‚Äôs portrait and landscape photo options, and Instagram Stories and Reels. Not to mention IGTV, which was designed with vertical in mind.\n\nBut as any good producer knows, the quality on the screen can only truly shine when the technical aspects are met. (Imagine if Rose told Jack she‚Äôd never let go‚Ä¶except the infamous raft was cropped out of the Titanic scene.)\n\nGood visuals are powerful. (That‚Äôs why over two decades later, we‚Äôre still talking about the fact that Jack could have totally fit on that raft.) And knowing the ideal Instagram sizes and dimensions is the key to making your images, and ultimately your brand, stand out.\n\nRead on for our complete guide on everything you need to know about Instagram sizes and dimensions. Or you can jump straight down to our cheat sheet. We‚Äôve snuck some Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Pinterest image sizes on there too. ü§´\n\nInstagram sizes and dimensions for photos\n\nThere‚Äôs two main things to keep in mind when it comes to Instagram dimensions: aspect ratios and size.\n\nAn aspect ratio refers to the width of an image in relation to its height. Just like its name, it‚Äôs expressed as a ratio ‚Äî think 1:1 for square photos.\n\nSize, also known as resolution, is the number of pixels that make up the width and height of an image. It‚Äôs also expressed as two numbers ‚Äî like 1080 x 1080 pixels.\n\nInstagram post dimensions for photos\n\nBack in the early days of Instagram, photos could only be posted in a 1:1 aspect ratio. This meant gorgeous mountain landscapes and cute pup portraits had to be cropped into an exact square.\n\nWhile there‚Äôs more size options these days, with vertical landscape and portrait photos, there‚Äôs still limitations.\n\nSticking to Instagram‚Äôs guidelines for both aspect ratio and size will help you avoid unwanted cropping and keep the quality of your images sharp. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the Instagram dimensions for each photo and video type.\n\nInstagram profile photo dimensions\n\nIdeal profile photo size: 320 x 320 pixels, 1:1 aspect ratio.\n\nYour Instagram bio helps customers quickly recognize your brand. And with 90% of Instagram users following at least one business, it makes sense to make your profile photo pop.\n\nWhen selecting the resolution for your profile photo, make sure to hit at least 320 x 320 pixels. That way your image stands out on both the mobile and desktop browser.\n\nInstagram thumbnail photo dimensions\n\nIdeal thumbnail size: 161 x 161 pixels, 1:1 aspect ratio.\n\nFirst impressions matter. And thumbnails are what Instagram users will most likely notice when they first land on your profile ‚Äî ultimately determining whether or not they‚Äôll dive deeper into your content.\n\nSince Instagram stores versions of thumbnails as large as 1080 x 1080 pixels, you‚Äôll want to upload images that are as large as possible to prevent pixelation.\n\nInstagram square photo size\n\nIdeal square photo size: 1080 x 1080 pixels; 1:1 aspect ratio.\n\nSquare photos, the OG of Instagram, are still popular ‚Äî particularly since their display is the same as the profile grid. They‚Äôre also usually pretty easy to edit. Instagram‚Äôs auto-cropping function makes it a snap to get the sizes and dimensions right. And nearly all smartphone cameras let you take the photo directly on the platform.\n\nAim to size your photos between 320 x 320 pixels and 1080 x 1080 pixels. Uploading photos above or below these parameters may cause your images to blur and pixelate.\n\nIf you‚Äôre struggling with the compression on your mobile device, try using your desktop. You may have better luck with Instagram‚Äôs web version since it conserves photo quality better than the mobile app.\n\nInstagram portrait photo size\n\nIdeal portrait photo size: 1080 x 1350 pixels, 4:5 aspect ratio.\n\nPortrait photos are one of the ways to post full pictures on Instagram without cropping them. They‚Äôre also pretty easy to edit as well. Simply use Instagram‚Äôs full-size button to auto-adjust your photo into the perfect vertical post.\n\nJust make sure to stay within Instagram‚Äôs size and aspect ratio requirements. Otherwise, you‚Äôll be prompted to crop a part of your photo to make it fit.\n\nYou‚Äôll also want to stick closely to 1080 x 1350 pixels to avoid automatic compression.\n\nInstagram landscape photo size\n\nIdeal landscape photo size: 1080 x 566 pixels, 1.91:1 aspect ratio.\n\nPerfect for group shots and scenery snaps, landscape photos are another method for uploading full-size photos. Getting the right horizontal photo dimensions, however, can be a bit of a challenge. That‚Äôs because the ideal aspect ratio is a tricky 1.91:1.\n\nBut if you hit the aspect ratio perfectly, your horizontal photo will display beautifully on Instagram without a border ‚Äî chef‚Äôs kiss! (Instagram automatically adds a border to images that don‚Äôt fit the correct dimensions.)\n\nInstagram sizes and dimensions for videos\n\nIf using videos to connect and engage with your followers is more your speed, you‚Äôll also want to stay on top of the correct size and dimensions. Similar to photos, you can take your pick between square, horizontal, and landscape videos in your feed. The ideal dimensions for each are:\n\nSquare and carousel: 1080 x 1080 pixels, 1:1 aspect ratio\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 pixels, 4:5 aspect ratio\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 608 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio\n\nInstagram Stories and Reels dimensions\n\nIdeal Instagram Stories size: 1080 x 1920 pixels, 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nFrom hosting Instagram live streams to uploading text and remarkable photos, Instagram Stories are an excellent tool to connect your followers with your brand. Especially since more than 500 million Instagram users watch Instagram Stories on a daily basis.\n\nWhen it comes to sizing, you‚Äôll want to use portrait photos and videos. They‚Äôre what Instagram initially intended for Stories. While you can use landscape sizes, visuals that fill up the entire Stories screen are more likely to capture attention.\n\nFor Instagram Reels, you‚Äôll use the exact dimensions as Instagram Stories. Two things to note ‚Äî the preview of your Instagram Reel will show up in your feed at a 4:5 portrait size, and the caption will be displayed in the bottom corner of the video.\n\nIGTV dimensions\n\nAlso known as ‚ÄúYouTube for Instagram,‚Äù IGTV is a fantastic way to keep your audience returning to your profile.\n\nInitially debuting with only portrait videos, Instagram has since expanded the feature to allow landscape options ‚Äî opening up a ton of new ways to create IGTV content.\n\nHere‚Äôs a few ideal post dimensions to keep in mind:\n\nPortrait IGTV: 1080 x 1920 pixels, 9:16 aspect ratio\n\nLandscape IGTV: 1920 x 1080 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio\n\nIGTV cover photo: 420 x 654 pixels, 1:1.55 aspect ratio\n\nSocial media image size cheat sheet\n\nAchieving Instagram benchmarks one visually engaging post at a time\n\nAnd, that‚Äôs a wrap! You‚Äôre now up-to-speed on the latest Instagram sizes and dimension requirements.\n\nBy keeping these parameters top-of-mind, you‚Äôll not only increase the quality of your visuals but also the credibility of your brand ‚Äî helping achieve your Instagram benchmarks one visually engaging post at a time. Now you know the right Instagram sizing, see which Instagram metrics you should be using."
