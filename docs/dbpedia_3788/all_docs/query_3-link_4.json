        "text": "A query of the transclusion table might find file description pages like this, using {{Category:....}} instead of [[Category:....]]\n\nThe result could then easily be fixed by bot. -- Docu at\n\nUser:Bryan has just changed the behavior of User:FlickreviewR. It know provides dates of reivew in ISOformat. If this is possible to do it along with other internationalization work, it would be nice to convert parameters 3 of transclusions of User:FlickreviewR/reviewed-pass to ISO format.--Zolo (talk)\n\nThis should do the trick. Multichill (talk)\n\nAh yes it works thanks. As a long term solution I think converting to ISOdate would make it more consistent with other dates like those in the date field of {{Information}}, but clearly there is nothing urgent.Sorry for my having broken the English template, it was because of a typo, not because of ISOdate itself. --Zolo (talk)\n\nHi. A user Babel Autocreate bot created 500 or more babel categories that are uncategorised. The result is that Special:UncategorizedCategories is filled up with empty uncategorised categories, so it becomes unmanageable. Could a bot either categorise them all or delete them ? --Foroa (talk)\n\nI threw them for time being into Category:Incomplete users by language categories - they are not properly formatted like for example Category:User de. We should probably ask User:Babel_AutoCreate to correct them. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI am not sure who is controlling this bot. I asked User:SPQRobin, the only person who edited bot's userpage. I think we should keep those categories since they will be added automatically to userpages that use {{#babel:...}}. Most likely we will have to format them ourselves. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThe userpage explains it. It's not a bot, it's part of the Babel extension. The software adds the categories when a user uses it via {{#babel}} and adds them as if Babel AutoCreate added it. SPQRobin (talk)\n\nIt might be worth filing a report on Bugzilla. -- Docu at\n\nThis is intended software behaviour. You can customize MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main. I added the possibility to use respectively $3 and $2 as the language code, it will be available next week. If you want to disable categories for {{#babel:}} altogether, then you would need to file a bug. SPQRobin (talk)\n\nI think Babel categories are fine, the problem is with formatting and categorization of the text in those categories. Are there going to be more of them? If so than may be software can be fixed to format & categorize the way other categories are done. Also do you think current categories can be fixed somehow, or shall we ask users and bot operators here to fix them? --Jarekt (talk)\n\nIf unblocked, it will certainly add more categories. I referenced the relevant MediaWiki pages where you can customize the format. Categories added by Babel AutoCreate have to be fixed manually or by bot. SPQRobin (talk)\n\nI will see if I can convince MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main to use {{UsersSpeak}}. Extra language parameter will be useful. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI don't think it should be run anywhere before MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels has been customized. A template would indeed be a good idea to do that. You might even want to include that by default. (Templates can also be in MediaWiki namespace. This might make it easier to package it with the extension. -- Docu at\n\nI fixed already created categories, and added {{UsersSpeak}} template to MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main. the template requires language code which SPQRobin promised next week. We should unblock Babel Autocreate then and see if it works properly. SPQRobin, is there any way to configure the software to create new categories only when needed. Unlike current behavior that creates mostly empty categories, see for example Category:User kri. Babel extension seems to support over 7k languages and creates 7 categories for each. I do not think we need 50k mostly empty categories. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI do not think there is a way to configure it to create categories only when needed. I was myself quite surprised to see it creating dozens of unneeded categories. I will see if I can improve this in the code. SPQRobin (talk)\n\nHello bots, could you replace text description in Category:Netřebská slaniska as folows:\n\n\"nature reserve\" to \"natural monument\" in English description\n\nThank you!--Juandev (talk)\n\nTryphon is inactive for more than five month now. Would someone skilled be so kind and update those three lists? --Leyo\n\nI have upload almost 700 files that needs author, permission & category changes. Can someone please run bot for them. Please, replace author Makele-90 by Markus Rantala (Makele-90). Add Permission {{User:Makele-90/Credit}} and all files to category Category:Files by User:Makele-90. Like this. I have changed 48 files manually, but that is way too slow to do. Thank you! --–Makele-90 (talk)\n\nMany PD-art licensed images do not have a source. A source is interesting but not really needed for such files. Beside, while the PD-art status should be checked, this is no different from files with a source. So a bot could add the strict parameter (simply \"strict=\") parameter to artworks using template:artwork with a PD-art tag. This would relieve category:images without source and would file descriptions look better.--Zolo (talk)\n\n\"strict\" option was mostly meant for derivative templates based on {{Artwork}} not for images using {{Artwork}} template. I think a better option would be to provide source=Unknown. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nYes actully unknown may be better (and possibly even changing the few \"strict\" directly added to files)--Zolo (talk)\n\nDone I found over 3k files in category:images without source that had {{PD-Art}}. I am adding {{Unknown|source}} and should be done soon. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nGood thanks.--Zolo (talk)\n\nAs noted on VP, there are many galleries with just a single image, which is rather confusing. It would be nice if we could get rid of some of them. What could be done could be:\n\nif it does not already exist, create Category:PAGENAME\n\nmove all categories and interwikis to Category:PAGENAME\n\neither:\n\nput the gallery in a special subcat category:other speedy deletions so that they can be sampled to check that everything is okay and then deleted.\n\nturn the gallery into a redirect to the cat. I think this is the most convenient solution but some people do not like cross-namespace redirects.\n\nWe could begin with those in category:People by name, they should be rather straightforward.--Zolo (talk)\n\nbonjour afin qu'il est une meilleure compréhension il faudrait remplacer dans la partie description, la phrase suivante pour toutes les communes de la Category:Cities and villages in Indre et de faire la modif en anglais aussi.\n\navant\n\nest une commune du département de l'Indre et de la région Centre en France.\n\naprès\n\nest une commune française, située dans le département de l'Indre, en région Centre.\n\nmerci\n\n--Parisdreux (d)\n\nTranslation: replace a rather awkward phrase in all depth 0 subcats of Category:Cities and villages in Indre\n\n{{en|XXXX is a municipality in the french departement Indre and the region Centre.}} {{fr|XXXX est une commune du département de l'Indre et de la région Centre en France.}}\n\nwith\n\n{{en|XXXX is a municipality in the french departement Indre, région Centre.}} {{fr|XXXX est une commune du département de l'Indre, en région Centre en France.}}\n\nAlternatively, the previous text could be replaced with {{Category definition: French commune|XXXX|36}}. The template would really require some clean up, but it does its job, and is a convenient for adding new tools like {{GeoGroupTemplate}}.--Zolo (talk) <aside>\n\nje ne comprends pas l'anglais. --Parisdreux (d)\n\nEt les maîtres-bots ne parlent pas français :). Je faisais juste l'intermédiaire. Enfin je disais aussi qu'à la place d'écrire le texte sur chaque fichier il pourrait être plus commode d'utiliser un modèle, par exemple {{Category definition: French commune|Châteauroux|36}} donne en français \"Cette page contient des fichiers en rapport avec la commune française de Châteauroux, dans le département de l’Indre, en région Centre.\" Dans cette manière le texte peut ultérieurement être modifié ou traduit facilement dans d'autres langues.--Zolo (talk) </aside>\n\nDone manuellement. --Parisdreux (d)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Rd232 (talk)\n\nPlease replace all data formated as XXXX-XX-XX (original upload date) with {{Original upload date|XXXX-XX-XX}}. --ŠJů (talk)\n\nDone? I searched file descriptions for \"original upload date\", found 1.4k and replaced them all. However there might be more I did not found. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Rd232 (talk)\n\nHi. I noticed that many jpg, png and gif files include Template:LOC-music instead of Template:LOC-image. Those music-related images are then misscategorized as audio fragments in Category:Music from the Library of Congress. I think a bot can search in Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:LOC-music for those file extensions and then change template tag. Thanks, Gustronico (talk)\n\nDone I found only 56 such files. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Rd232 (talk)\n\nWould it be possible to replace in all images containing {{Onroerend erfgoed|Unidentified locations in}} or {{Onroerend erfgoed|ID}} the template by the name of the file. Those things are rather difficult with standard tools. Thank you. --Foroa (talk)\n\nI created Category:Onroerend erfgoed without known IDs with non-numeric IDs, however I do not see any clear patterns of how to get proper ID from the filename. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nPart 2: remove \"ID\" in all images using {{Onroerend erfgoed|IDxxxx}} to {{Onroerend erfgoed|xxxx}}. Thank you. --Foroa (talk)\n\nDone --Jarekt (talk)\n\nGreat cleanup, thank you, but there remains about 800 invalid ones in Category:Onroerend erfgoed without known IDs. Since all images there are pretty well categorised (in the cats with the proper ID), and the real manual correction would take several days of work, I would propose to comment out there the template invocation. Many of them should use instead other templates for the Brussels or Walloon area, but this is too complex for a bot. --Foroa (talk)\n\nThe pattern is quite easy for a human, but not easy for a bot. I still feel that the template can be removed /commented out with /nowiki as all images are in a proper category, most of them having the correct erfgoed ID.\n\nthe ones with full text, such are unidentified ID: most of them are not a real erfgoed item, so should be removed anyway.\n\nthe ones with a pattern like \"83034-CLT-0001\", \"83034-CLT-0001-01\" so \"xxxxx-CLT-xxx\" in the ID and most of the time in the file name too, should use another template being {{WLM-identifier|be-wal|xxxxx-CLT-xxx}}.\n\nthe ones with a numeric pattern, like \"2043-0003-0\" and \"2043-0155-0\" (most of the time, they have Brussel in the file name, I believe they all begin with a 2), should become {{WLM-identifier|be-bru|2043-0155/0}}\n\nThank you anyway. --Foroa (talk)\n\nDone There are 23 files left in Category:Onroerend erfgoed without known IDs. Can you fix them by hand?--Jarekt (talk)\n\nGreat job, thousand or so improvements. I was not precise enough; {{WLM-identifier|be-wal|xxxxx-CLT-xxx}} should have specified {{WLM-identifier|be-wal|xxxxx-CLT-xxx-xx}}, but no real problem. --Foroa (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Rd232 (talk)\n\nHi, I am not suere if this is an appropriate request.

It is improving however. --Foroa (talk)\n\nIt seems to be adding nowiki-tags that are not needed. See Category:User pfl-N. It should be possible to fix that in the corresponding MW message. I suppose it's MediaWiki:Babel-autocreate-text-levels. -- Docu at\n\nThe category pages are only uncategorised because of the nowiki in that MediaWiki message - the template in it does the categorisation, if the nowiki tags are removed. I did some removals from categories a few days ago, and I've now removed it from the MediaWiki message. Special:UncategorizedCategories shows there are cases that need fixing by removing the nowiki, but any new creations should be fine. Rd232 (talk)\n\nGood thanks. The person running the extension should attempt to monitor what it does. -- Docu at\n\nI didn't think extensions normally had a person responsible for running them, like bots do. Am I wrong? Rd232 (talk)\n\nAs far as I know there is nobody is running user:Babel AutoCreate. It is part of the software. The edits of the bot are controlled by MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main messages and can be edited by any admin. I tried to alter them but I guess they do not work properly yet. I will try to run a bot to fix already created categories. As for the messages, here is the problem: what we want for the user:Babel AutoCreate to add is a template with some parameters provided by the extension software, but the template was being expanded at MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and what was being added to the categories was no longer a template. I tried <nowiki></nowiki> around the template to see what will happen, but that did not work either. I will try to use {{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE}}|Category|....}} and see if that helps. If anybody has an idea about how to fix it please give it a try. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI changed some users and deleted to babel categories. When I restored the user babel switches, Babel AutoCreate recreated the categories again, but empty this time. --Foroa (talk)\n\nForoa, That was because my {{#ifeq:{{NAMESPACE}}|Category|....}} experiment (see above) - I guess it did not work. I undid my changes to MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main and fixed text of those 2 categories. the content of those 2 messages still does not work properly. The edits will look like this. Any ideas how to fix it? I am running out of ideas.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nIt seems like a lot of new categories were created thanks to users like User:Zuma11.

It seems like at least EN wikipedians thought the same. But most other Wikipedias use them (see interwiki at de:Kategorie:User_en-0). I wonder if there is a way to configure the extension not to create them. We can easily modify templates not to add them. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nHey I think I found what we need to fix MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-levels and MediaWiki:babel-autocreate-text-main messages at {{Tlx}}.

On the other hand I have to say that I find {{NYPL-image-full}} rather confusing, undocumented, and hard to manipulate. It is also used in 78k files what makes changes changing individual files very time consuming (I know since I was fixing licenses of most of the files in the collection).

Yes substituting the template with artwork sounds like a good idea to me. It could be an the occasion to do something about the date field too.

It is confusing to users and very hard to undo or modify. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nAs discussed a few times (eg Commons:Village_pump#Image_orientation), MediaWiki 1.18 started respecting EXIF rotation data (where present) in the generation of thumbnails. But files have often been rotated without the correction of this EXIF data, so that the software rotates the image again. This is a request for a maintenance category to be created, and populated with all image files with EXIF rotation data other than 0 degrees (presuming that where it's 0 degrees, the image would only very rarely have been rotated). For the avoidance of doubt, files without EXIF rotation data should be ignored.\n\nIs this possible? If so, who can do it? Thanks. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI think this is badly needed. I was looking at File:MediaWiki database schema 1-19 (r102798).png to figure out how EXIF data is stored, but did not figure it out yet. I think a new toolserver bot will have to be written to do the job. A good starting point would be User:DschwenBot/source which already analyses image EXIF data, looking for GPS coordinates. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nde:Benutzer:Umherirrender made a list of all files which contain EXIF rotation info (yes, there may be some correct ones included but we do not have many at all): de:Wikipedia_Diskussion:WikiProjekt_Commons-Transfer#Gedrehte_Bilder_wieder_richtig_drehen. I left him a message to join here.\n\n@Rd232: 1: I think we only do need to look at files uploaded before the 1.18 switch-over date (5 October 2011). 2: before we make big categorizing requests here - what will be the process of dealing with the cat (Should files be decatted if they look okay or have been rotated (maybe Rotatebot should get a minor update to remove this cat if found))? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nIf 1. is true, that's good. But I don't understand why it would be - can you explain? 2. Yes, that should be agreed as part of the setup of this. I think it's straight forward though, isn't it? If the thumbnail looks OK, the cat can be removed - there shouldn't be thumbnails that look OK when actually the EXIF contradicts the file rotation; and when rotatebot is fixing EXIFs, it should remove the cat at the same time. Rd232 (talk)\n\n1: Well, images uploaded after 1.18 switchover may have correct EXIF and display correctly. And if not they did show up directly wrong after upload - so the uploader directly noticed it and could act accordingly. Maybe we should include all files until the RotateLink was displayed (17 October 2011) because before that date it was hard for all users except regulars to fix those images.\n\n2: Just another thought: A categorizing would be a massive page history and watchlist \"spam\". But, yes, I agree that this is easiest for the expected massive amount of files. A list/gallery page like we have it now in dewp probably would create too much overhead work (removing the checked/fixed files from the list).\n\n3: Needs to be thought of: in the cat gallery not all files which have wrong EXIF will show up wrong since the thumbnails could be old ones. So all files in this cat would need a purge to get fresh thumbs. Downside: all article uses would be instantaneously wrong (even if they had correct (old) thumbs until now). If there would be a way to set a unusual thumbnailsize for the cat gallery the purge would not be needed.\n\n4: name of the cat to be added? Category:Images with EXIF-based rotation to be checked? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\n1. OK. Probably should extend to the RotateLink date then. 2. \"spam\" will be an issue. At least the categorising step can be a \"bot\" edit, hopefully many of the fixings as well. 3. ...ideally we'd have some reasonably efficient way to do a batch of files: in one step, purge the thumbs of the batch, select all that need rotating and how, and tell Rotatebot - and have Rotatebot act on those immediately. it would need a custom script, but then thumbs would be only wrong for a few minutes. 4. name seems fine. And hopefully it won't live very long so it doesn't matter much! :) Rd232 (talk)\n\nMediaWiki stores the metadata of a image in the database field img_metadata in database table image as a serialized php object. I have download the sql dump of that table from dumps.wikimedia.org. Than I have searched inside the database field with the regulare expression \"Orientation\";i:[836];. MediaWiki is only rotated the orientation of 3, 6 or 8 (See ExifBitmap.php). I checked each match with the api, if the image is not deleted or moved to commons or rotated in the meantime. The sql dump for dewiki is 30.7 MB big, that is easy to download and process. The sql dump for commonswiki is 5.2 GB (!) big, that is many to download. If possible, it is better, when a user with toolserver account can search over the database and find the images, when the database field is available on the toolserver and mysql allows regex. When not, I can try to download the sql dump at next weekend and find the images. Der Umherirrende\n\nEin falscher Freund ist da reingerutscht: wenn = if, wann = when. Rd232 (talk)\n\nDanke, ich bin in englisch nicht gerade gut, hoffe aber, das man mich versteht. Der Umherirrende\n\nThat's a big dump - is at least up to date? Well, whatever works, if there's no better way to get this done. Thanks for the offer. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI have download the dump and run my program over the dump. I have found wrong orientation by 0.5% of all files, but from 11 milion files this are 54637 (!) files. I have copy 2000 files to User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation. Have a look. Is tagging with bot better, or manually work on that page? Der Umherirrende\n\nHm, I see you've got next to each file what the EXIF rotation is. Can you split the files by rotation, so that you have User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation3, User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation6, User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation8? Because then COM:AWB can be used to append a rotatebot command on all those files, no? You just need to check each page for images like this File:1.p1430447.jpg, and remove them before loading the list into AWB. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI do not think that thats work, because sometimes the file is already rotated, but the exif data is not changed and in other places the images is rotated, but in the wrong way or other examples. Having the files sorted by the rotation is there not very helpful. But you can do it yourself for a block and try it. Der Umherirrende\n\nOK, here's an example: User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation6. There's a handful of files that can easily be identified from looking at the page as exceptions which need removing. Do that, and then the page is ready to go into AWB, and add the same rotatebot instruction (90 degrees left) to all of them. The only problem I can see is if (a) the thumbnail for a file is outdated (b) the rotation of a file has been corrected without changing the EXIF data. Then rotatebot will rotate the image again. Perhaps the only solution for this is to open each file and check that the file rotation matches the thumbnail, and handle it as an exception if it doesn't. But this process (feeding into AWB) should still be more efficient than examining each file and using RotateLink on it. Rd232 (talk)\n\nYes, it is really important to look at a fresh thumb when issuing a rotation request. We do not want to mess up many images, right? ;-) If the rotation tag is applied by the rotatelink gadget the small thumb in the popup will be (in 99%) a fresh one (since the gadget purges and requests a unusual thumbnail size. Maybe we need should think about increasing rotatebot's speed (of course this will put more load on the TS then). But I suggest not to do so if possible. Changes could lead to problems. ;) It is nice and running at the moment. I will watch the Rotatebot log for error reports (easy by looking in the history of the log page) and very quickly visually scan the thumbnails in the log for wrong rotations. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\n\"it is really important to look at a fresh thumb when issuing a rotation request. \" - or else to ignore the thumb and look at the file page itself, yes? ... in theory, we could use RotateLink's approach and purge and use an unusual thumbnail size, but that could mean breaking existing transclusions some time before Rotatebot gets round to a file. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI am using a unusual thumbnail size on the list, so that what you see is right in the most cases. Der Umherirrende\n\nExcellent - then I have more confidence in my AWB approach. The missing element, perhaps, is to go back to the block of processed images after rotatebot has actually done the rotation, and check that they all look right, using a slightly different unusual thumbnail size. Rd232 (talk)\n\n\"ignore the thumb and look at the file page itself\" - I am not sure what you mean. Could you please explain? Take my word please: look at fresh thumbs. That is important because Rotatebot takes the EXIF Orientation into account. See the code: search for Saibo2. I do not understand your AWB approach so I cannot tell you if it works. RotateLink (or careful manual template setting and reading the text of the template) works. ;-) Btw: I am in IRC chat when I am at the PC - for quick questions. Btw: I have included this \"User:Rotatebot/approx wait time incl text\" on the cat page now. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI've assumed that the file page preview is always correct. And, the AWB approach is just mass-tagging files with {{Rotate}}, by selecting files with a certain rotation in a list, and then manually removing from the list files which don't need rotating. Rd232 (talk)\n\nThanks for the explanation. No, the file page preview (standard: 800px thumbnail) is not always correct since it could be still generated by the old MW version. A Purge is needed to force a new thumbnail (although sometimes, as you know, purging has no effect - due to buggy MW). And at which thumbnail do you look with AWB? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nOh... um. Purge required! ... AWB is text only - it's just for processing the list after all visual analysis has been done on Commons. But with the backlog issue, AWB is not an appealing route now anyway. Rd232 (talk)\n\nI want to note (again?) that not all files which have a EXIF rotation specified need to be corrected some (especially new uploads) may be correct (which is the intention of this MediaWiki feature ;-) ). Btw: 54637 files would need at current Rotatebot speed 151 days of bot action. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nYes, a few are in Umherirrender's listing which have EXIF rotation but display correctly, so don't need any action. Rd232 (talk)\n\nAlso per User_talk:Luxo#Any_chance_of_Rotatebot_handling_more_rotates.3F: Could we please stop mass tagging for now? Otherwise the Rotatebot is unable to process other requests which may be important (at least in the eyes of the user who requested). Maybe we should try to keep the backlog under about 18 hours? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI agree. If we can't massively increase Rotatebot's processing power, then we should try to reserve it for images that are actually in use. One way to identify those is to wait for people to complain... The other one, of course, once the backlog is down, is to check global usage on the file page, and skip it if not used in a significant way (eg ignore userspace). Alternatively, if we had something like {{rotate|notinuse}} then those could go in a different category, and that category be given a lesser priority. Rd232 (talk)\n\nWe could simply add such a additional param to the rotate template. According to Rotatebot's code (\"//Template erkennen\") it could be processed. However, I think that simply creates too much overhead and error possibilities. I would rather KISS and just do not flood Rotatebot more than it can process. If someone wants to do changes (which work!), feel free. I do not have the time. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nThe list now contains only images which are used global. When all 20000 global used files are rotated, the other 35000 files where listed piece by piece. Der Umherirrende\n\nUmherirrender, danke dass du so viel mithilfst, aber, wie ich oben schrieb, wäre es möglich vorerst keine neuen Drehaufträge zu geben? Es bringt nichts einen Mega-Rückstand für den Bot aufzubauen - schneller geht's dadurch eh nicht. Für die Normaluser scheint sonst der Rotatebot völlig unbenutzbar zu sein. Sind denn bei allen Dateien, die du markierst die Thumbs auch in den Artikeln schon falsch (vor dem Drehauftrag)? --Saibo (Δ)\n\nJa, es war in den Artikeln das gedrehte Bild sichtbar. Ich habe die Liste mal geleert und warte, bis der Rückstand des Bots wieder geschrumpft ist und schau dann, wie viel noch übrig bleibt und davon noch gedreht werden müssen. Der Umherirrende\n\nIt just came to my mind - do not know if it is helpful as I do not know how you do the tagging: the rotate parameter {{rotate|resetexif}} is also available. Rotatebot then just deleted the EXIF-Orientation. So if you know that the image is physically correct this could be used (due to the more difficult task to determine if the physical orientation is correct this option is not available to the average user with RotateLink) --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI do not know if someone continues mass tagging.. however: if a image is still right in articles: PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST ROTATION. People really get fucked up due to many images are wrong now (due to a purge) bit not fast fixing by rotatebot. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nOkay, I really do not know why this started now but it seems (from looking at a sample of some recent rotate requests) that the servers started to refresh thumbs and people are simply (and correctly) tagging wrong files. CommonGood apparently did a mass tagging. The temporal relation to this section here is very strange. Does someone has an explanation? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nNote: Rotatebot's speed is now 300% of the previous (if everything keeps to run smoothly). → 86 hours backlog currently. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nExcellent - well done everyone involved in making that happen. Rd232 (talk)\n\nInfo As I also had posted at User_talk:Rotatebot#Huge_Queue: Just had a chat in IRC #wikimedia-tech with apergos: They run a thumb cleaner because they run out of HDD space on the thumb servers. → LOL sorry... He tried to only purge thumbs of files which are not in article use.\n\nIn case it is useful to somebody: Apergos uploaded the full list to http://www.sendspace.com/file/cuufj4 \"this is the entire job. we've done up through /export/thumbs/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Gregorian_chant_clefs.gif \"\n\nI further discussed with him if it is possible to exclude the files with \"Orientation\" from the purge. He will look at it - seems to be possible. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nInfo2: We are at 20 hours backlog currently. So .. if someone wants to continue mass tagging - I think it can be started slowly. Would be nice we we stay below 1 day. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI have start the list with 1000 images. Some of the listed images are already rotated by RotateBot but they have orientation of 3, 6 or 8, so I cannot filter them out. Please remove that images manually or should I ignore images with lastUploader = RotateBot? Der Umherirrende\n\nYes, you can do that as I had gone through the uploads of RotateBot and fixed almost all that needed repair. -- Docu at\n\nDid you notice that the image.sql database file was dumped today? Are you using the new dump or an old one? I tried downloading a previous dump but gave up after MySQL on my computer had been importing it without finishing within 24 hours, so I guess you haven't had the time to import the new one yet.\n\nI think that we really need some maintenance categories: \"Unchecked EXIF rotation 3\", \"Unchecked EXIF rotation 6\" and \"Unchecked EXIF rotation 8\". To be used if EXIF rotation is set but no one has checked the image. When checked, ask for rotation or delete the category if rotation isn't needed. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nI am using the API to update the list and remove the already tagged or already by RotateBot rotated images. I am also check the new images, before adding to the page. My java program parsed the SQL dump and I have not to import it in MySQL, that is not easy, because it is hugh. Der Umherirrende\n\nSystematic fix\n\nI resume:\n\nWe have a list of all files having Exif-orientation that we can filter.\n\nIs it possible to filter those files that's latest upload-date is before the MW-Update? If it isn't in the MySQL-Dump, I could write an API-query (but only in VB(A) e.g. Microsoft Access or JavaScript (e.g. somewhere a list on Commons that is fetched by the script and script removes files uploaded later)). -- RE rillke questions?\n\nUser:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation\n\nI am going to write a JavaScript: \"reset exif and remove from list\". I assume the thumbs are always right on this page. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nMy list only contains images, which last version was uploaded before 2011-10-17T00:00:00Z. The dump contains all database columns, so that was easy to filter. Der Umherirrende\n\nSome images on that page already have a {{Rotate}} template. What happens if your script adds an additional one? {{rotate|270}} first and then {{rotate|resetexif}} is innocent (the second rotation does nothing) but {{rotate|resetexif}} first and then {{rotate|270}} would be a problem. Don't forget to check that there isn't already a {{Rotate}} template. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nMy script is clever :-) If first removes all {{Rotate}}-templates and then adds a reset-exif tag.\n\nif(\"User:Umherirrender/EXIF_rotation\"===wgPageName)importScript(\"User:Rillke/RotateIt.js\");\n\nParsing the page takes some time and may freeze your browser for 30s. Then, there are 2 links beyond each thumb: One for tagging&removing and one only removing the image from the list. Tagging is done immediately (dispays working... and then, if successfully done removes the link), removal is queued. If there are 26 images in the removal-queue, script will remove these images from the page. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nI tried that script and it seems very useful! --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nMaybe increase the number of items in that queue from 26 to 40? That avoids to many saves on the list. Der Umherirrende\n\nUser:Meneerke bloem complained on my talk page because I apparently requested rotation of some image for which he had already requested rotation. Unfortunately, Rillke's script does not tell if rotation already has been requested, so other people's rotation requests might be deleted at other places for the same reason. The end result should still be the same, but people might be upset about it. Feel free to comment on the topic on my talk page. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nI am checking each file for Template:Rotate, when I update the list and add new images to the list. The user add the template in the period between my last check and your tagging. That is possible and the script of Rillke is replacing the old template by the new one. Maybe it is better to stop tagging that image instead of override the template. Der Umherirrende\n\nAgreed. Working on a fix. People are really easy upset and we are the victims. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nVisit User:Umherirrender/EXIF rotation and Please purge your browser’s cache or enable JavaScript in your Browser's settings.

It needs to be turned 90 clockwise, but I don't understand what Template:Rotate is trying to tell me. Is it requesting that I do something, or is it notifying me that the rotation is on queue and will be completed three and a half days from now, thus needs no further action? Jim.henderson (talk)\n\nFor me it reads\n\nRotatebot will reset the EXIF orientation. This is useful for old images, which display wrong now due to upgrade to MediaWiki 1.18. Instead of this option (except if the file has duplicate IFD0:Orientation tags) the correct degree number would work, too.\n\nSo you don't have to do anything. Wait 3 days and it is done. Regards -- RE rillke questions?\n\nCould be, but half a day later it still indicates three days and a half to go, and as in file:mskcc.jpg it says \"Consequently, the degree parameter needs to be specified based on the thumbnail you see here below. The next issued rotation request would take approximately 3 days, 11:36 hours to be processed\" in which \"would\" suggests a hypothetical specification of rotation rather than one that is already queued. All this suggests to me that the process is not being applied to these pictures, and all such pictures should be removed from the various Wikipedias until someone figures out what has to be specified and how, or at least when. Jim.henderson (talk)\n\nAh. Lehman Brothers flipped a few minutes ago. I am contented that the right things are happening; it's just that the template provides unclear wording. Jim.henderson (talk)\n\nConsequently, the degree parameter needs to be specified\n\nis there because some people think putting {{Rotate}} (without any parameters) will solve the problem. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nThe next issued rotation request [...]\n\nonly indicates what it says: If you request a new rotation or change the template, it will take 3 days to be processed. From my side, this could be dropped from the template as it is more confusing than helpful. Or we invent something more complicated, which exactly calculates how many time is required. But is it really worth? -- RE rillke questions?\n\nAll right; the degree question can be clarified by making it hypothetical, even if it requres more words like \"If an actual raster rotation is required, the degree parameter must be specified; otherwise only the EXIF rotate flag will be adjusted.\" This is long, and in part obscure since some readers won't understand a term like \"raster rotation\" or \"physically rotate\" but I'm guessing those are the readers who don't need to know.\n\nThe timetable sentence should be clarified by shortening and dehypothesising: \"Current rotate backlog is approximately [Days, Hours].\" The meaning is vague, but vagueness is precisely what we want here if we cannot actually say how soon it will happen. Jim.henderson (talk)\n\nI have changed the wording of the rotate template. --Saibo (Δ)\n\nAbout 1,000 images within Category:Artgate Fondazione Cariplo are missing {{PD-Art}}. Please add this template to each of the files. Thanks, --Mattes (talk)\n\nI agree that files in that category are missing most of the expected metadata. They could use {{Artwork}}, {{Creator}}, {{Institution}}, related categories, etc. However a bot can not just add {{PD-Art}} to all the files, since it is unclear that all the artworks are from artists who died more than 70 year ago, see for example File:Borra Pompeo - Volto.jpg. Also all the sculptures should use {{PD-old}} instead. If you or someone else create category or gallery of the images that qualify, than I can add the template. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI added {{Artwork}} to all the files. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nNot done since bot can not make proper decisions about which files to add the templates. However, It would be great is someone fix metadata in that category. Will be happy to assist in better defined tasks in the future, like lists of specific files to add templates to. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nA file is not guaranteed to have a file information page. For example, File:Portón de Maderuelo.jpg didn't have any file information page until I created one about half an hour ago. If there is no file information page, there is no source and no licence specified. The file I found was added to Commons in 2008, so it seems that the usual bots which search for files without licences or sources only find files with file information pages. It would be nice to search for all files without file information pages so that they can be tagged with no licence and no source. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nWhile this should be detected, this seems to be a software-bug: Sometimes image-description-pages disappear or are not created. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nI occasionally run into files that have been on commons for years and never had any license. Unfortunately it is not easy to find them. I started looking into that problem a while ago. I added empty {{License template tag}} to most valid templates. At the moment the template is used at 4.8 million files, out of 11.8 present. If we embed it in all valid licenses than all files without it should be inspected for either unorthodox license (to which this template can be added) or for lack of license. So far I occasionally use it to test for files with no license in a small category. For example I just used CatScan2 to find files in Category:Photographs_by_Jarek_Tuszynski that do not have {{License template tag}} and found that File:Desert Queen Ranch - crane.jpg was missing a license. Unfortunately the method still finds a lot of \"false alarms\" do to the fact that {{License template tag}} did not \"propagate\" yet (since early September) to all the files that use it, so although the file is transcluding a template that transcludes {{License template tag}}, the file claims that it does not have that template. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nHello. Cann one bot change licencens of my files? The new licence is {{User:Der Buckesfelder/licence}} and at following files the licence should be change: [2] and [3] Greets --Der Buckesfelder Talk Evaluation E-Mail\n\nI have multiple issues with this one. The catscan calls are not working for me, but I assume that you are looking for images like File:Advent wreath in the church Maria Königin, Lüdenscheid, Germany - 2011.jpg which are uploaded by you but use User:Raboe001/licence. Shell we just intersect Category:Files by Der Buckesfelder with use of that template? If so than there are only 21 such images and it might be faster to do by hand, otherwise it may be the easiest way would be to just save a list of those somewhere. Also I do not want to change to {{User:Der Buckesfelder/licence}}. If we are going to change it we should change to {{self|cc-by-sa-3.0|author=.....}} so each image has an actual license, which can be check in edit history to see if it changed, etc. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nAt all images in this category without this, this and this the licence shall be change to {{User:Der Buckesfelder/licence}}. If no one want to do this, I will do this by hand. Merry Christmas wish you --Der Buckesfelder Talk Evaluation E-Mail 13:46, 24 December 2011 (UTC)\n\nAgain, you should not use a license template like {{User:Der Buckesfelder/licence}}. Instead put the actual license tag directly on the image. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI have suggest why, but I'll change the licence in the next time again and then I can edit {{User:Der Buckesfelder/licence}}. It will be easier for me. --Der Buckesfelder Talk Evaluation E-Mail 15:52, 24 December 2011 (UTC)\n\nLicense changes will happen only seldom. And be aware: you cannot remove a license once you have applied it. That is a reason to put the license tag directly on the file page - what do you plan to change? Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nLike the Suggestbot used on wikipedia, would it be possible to have one for commons based on the categorys that a user works in/maintainence tags that are used(eg{{SVG}}), etc.\n\nJust an idea- Gauravjuvekar (talk)\n\nI need a bot for a license change, from {{PD-Italy}} to {{PD-scan|PD-old}}:\n\nThank you in advance.--Trixt (talk)\n\nDone I think we should also crate {{Book}} and {{Creator}} for this set of files.

Ach ja mein \"en\" ist nicht so berauschend, von daher wäre \"de\" von Vorteil für mich. :)\n\nWenn es <300 Bilder sind, kannst Du es per VisualFileChage (action: append text) selbst machen.

Yes, of course a good idea but a lot of work (and you may violate law by automatically fetching their pages). -- RE rillke questions?\n\nFor all of the images in Category:Photos by JJ Harrison, I need to add the category \"<month> <year> in Australia\" where <month> and <year> comes from the date in the Information template on each image. For example, File:Petroica boodang male - Knocklofty.jpg would be placed into Category:July 2011 in Australia. I've no knowledge, but I believe that the dates are all in a consistent format, so it shouldn't be difficult to do. A crude, but effective approach in pseudo-code might be:\n\nif image description page contains \"|Date=2012-01\" then append [[:Category:January 2012 in Australia]] if image description page contains \"|Date=2011-12\" then append [[:Category:December 2011 in Australia]] if image description page contains \"|Date=2011-11\" then append [[:Category:November 2011 in Australia]]\n\n... and so on (this could obviously be automated quite a bit)\n\nI joined commons 6 April 2008, so no need to go back earlier than that. There will be a handful of photos taken outside Australia, but I will deal with those after the bot has been through. Oh, a few of those categories might need to be created.

I'm not sure how many categories there are, but I'd like to nominate all of them specifically because of their titles; the capitalisation is not consistent (there are many \"Gothic revival\" categories and many \"Gothic Revival\" categories, for example), so I'm nominating everything for renaming to a consistent standard.

Many thanks if you can help. :) Anna Frodesiak (talk)\n\nDone by User:Huntster? --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jarekt (talk)\n\nOK, I have a request that I believe can be specified precisely enough to be done by a bot:\n\nScope: For all category pages linking to templates {{Us states}} (sample here) and {{States of Austria Navi}} (sample here) with a name starting by <nnth>-century (presence of the dash mandatory, nnth taking values from 1st to 21st)\n\nAction requested: look for text \"prefix=:Category:<nnth> century\" and substitute it with \"prefix=:Category:<nnth>-century\" i.e. replace the space character with a dash, as in this example diff\n\nThis change is made necessary by the renaming of a great number of century categories. I already fixed by hand a few hundred category pages linked to {{States of Germany Navi}} and it can be quite tedious. Place Clichy\n\nI think this should be handled by adding {{Category redirect}} to all renamed categories and let bots clean up Category:Non-empty category redirects. That also leaves redirect so people who got used to the old names, or wikis that might link there can still find new categories. Bots can assist with adding {{Category redirect}} to categories, if assistance is needed. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nMaking redirects to those 6500 renamed and never (externally) linked categories makes no sense (besides the bad training). Anyway, those changes are requested for the navigation templates; navigation through stumbling in category redirects defeats the purpose of navigation templates. All deletion edit summaries contain a clickable destination directory. This is a typical problem when using \"horizontal\" references in navigation templates. --Foroa (talk)\n\nThe list could be first filtered as it should contain in the name \"century\". --Foroa (talk)\n\nYou are right. I should have read the original request more carefully, I did not catch the part that those are template parameters. I think I found 305 such categories, and I will change them. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nDone --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThank you very much to User:Place Clichy and Jarekt; this should conclude the bulk of the \"migration of the century\". --Foroa (talk)\n\nWow, I wish I had asked earlier, it would have saved me a few hundreds manual edits! About tasks remaining in the \"migration\", I still find some templates with links to moved categories, such as [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. Most of these templates are found under Category navigational templates or by a search on the template namespace. The redlinks tool may also be very useful: http://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/redlinks.py?page=20th_century&namespace=14&dbname=commonswiki will display all links to pages beginning with \"20th century\" in the category namespace. Place Clichy\n\nI found the following templates which are based on the same principle and need the same text substitution by a bot: {{Districts of Rhineland-Palatinate}}, {{Regions of Italy}}, {{Romania County}}, {{Counties of England}}.

Place Clichy\n\nI know it can be done with mw:Manual:Pywikipediabot/touch.py but making no-change edits to the page, but I am not that familiar with that code. I do a lot or template editing and it usually takes few days for them to propagate to all the pages, so perhaps it might no longer be necessary, or will not be necessary in a day or two. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI did a dummy edit on related templates. Could you check if by chance, it is updated by now ? --Foroa (talk)\n\nI found all pages purged after a night of sleep.

Anyways, thanks for the hint, I'll try using the script again next time. 88.196.241.249\n\nSince it is too difficult for me to figure out but if you can remember, you can use the action \"prepend any text\" (from the select on the top), fill in the delte-tag, then scoll down as long as no new files appear, click on select all (next to the action-select) and then remove the selection from the files that are not in the DR and hit execute. Yes, this is also some work, I have to admit. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nIt allowed to tag 9 files at once. I think I got it right now. Taking back my bot request. 88.196.241.249\n\nSorry for this.

Category: Wikipedia Loves Art at the Brooklyn Museum files started with quite poor metadata formatting and they meed some help. User:JarektBot is doing some simple regular expression based changes, proposed above, to the files still in original format. However all the resulting files could use further metadata reformatting, since all the text now in \"description\" field can be moved to appropriate fields. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nDone --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThanks, it is already better. Yet some other requsests about the Brooklyn Museum:\n\nA museum vounteer has uploaded some wallpapers by Morris & Co., but has also put them in Category:William Morris. They should be removed from there (William Morris was already dead at the time). Creator:Morris & Co. should also be added to them.\n\nAnother thing is about formatting internationalization. Source and accession number provided by the museum could be cleaned up and internationalized through something like: that. I have provided link to the photograph rather than to the database entry in the source field because the link was redundant with the accession number link and I found it a bit confusing. Linking to the image also sounds a bit more consistent with the text. But on the other hand, a link to an isolated image may not be that useful, so it can be changed. The link to the database could perhaps be added in the reference field too. --Zolo (talk)\n\nMany images in Category:Images from NOAA have information templates with descriptions like the one in File:Corp1138 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg:\n\ndescription = {{en|Float plane at Point Lay.

In Category:Category navigational templates (Works) and its parent and subcats, there are many templates to be adapted for conversion of \"nth century\" to \"nth-century\" such as this one.

Any ideas to create a generic template that simplifies all the others ? --Foroa (talk)\n\nThere are apparently about 1255 \"by century\" templates, many of them in need of link updating such as this one. Bot help would be a great idea! Are you able to build a flat list of all category names before the renaming? We may this way be able to look for all pages (probably mostly in the Category and Template namespaces) with links to any deleted page. I tried to create a {{Subject by century}} template, but then again placing it on top of all relevant categories might need a bit work, or bot help. Place Clichy\n\nGreat job with {{Subject by century}} template. Simplifies many templates. --Foroa (talk)\n\n2. There are in many categories constructs like {{Us states|prefix=:Category:20th century architecture in |suffix=}} that should be changed to {{Us states|prefix=:Category:20th-century architecture in |suffix=}}.

As disussed on User talk:Bundesarchiv-B6, I have created a {{BArch-image}} that is somewhat similar to {{NARA-image-full}} and could replace the current {{Information}} + {[tl|BArch-description}} combination. It is quite a big task, but I think it would be substantial improvement.\n\nNecessary changes are:\n\nchange name of some parameters of {{BArch-description}} to match the archive's website\n\n1 -> original title\n\ncaption -> original title (these two ones are apparently the same, if both are used in the same file, there is probably something wrong)\n\ncomment -> wiki description\n\nheadline -> short title\n\nextra -> archive title\n\nin what is currently out of the {{tl|BArch-description\n\nmove the content of {{BArch-link}} to a new ID field\n\nadd a \"medium\" field with {{technique|photograph}}\n\nrename \"author\" to \"photographer\"\n\nadd a {{BArch-cooperation}} and (we currently have the source in {{BArch-License}}, but it is not very neat to have it in a license template). The least redundant solution would be to add it in in \"source\" field, in place of the current \"Deutsches Bundesarchiv (German Federal Archive), {{BArch-link}}\"\n\nIt would be great if everything could be organized in such a way as to make the Archive-provided could and the user-editable content clearly distinct, like in here--Zolo (talk)\n\nThis would be a big job, but I agree we can probably do a better job with Bundesarchiv descriptions. However I am afraid that a lot of people edited those file descriptions in last few years, and many people did it a little differently, so I would like to make sure that we do not loose those edits and even is someone's bot do a fine job modifying the original description, it does not mean it will do fine modifying descriptions with a lot of extra wikiuser content. The bot should be very conservative while doing changes and not do them (for time being) if there are any irregularities. Once we think we are happy with the new templates and file descriptions, we should also make sure we announce our intentions on proper talk pages and possibly Village Pump. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nCan we use {{Artwork}}'s \"ID\" field instead of new field \"Image ID\"? Also I think we should use {{Artwork}}'s \"description\" field for \"wiki description\" and call \"short title\" -> \"original title\". Sometimes those titles are completely wrong. See for example this image from Warsaw uprising with the church in the background which Wikiuser identified as his church in Hrodna, Belarus. I also like you clear marking in wikicode of which parts can and can not be modified. I often found it hard to figure out where the boundaries lay. I would however move date out of the restricted area, see for example my modification of the date in this image again. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nYes, If we can change date by ourselves, yes, let's put it in the user-editable part - just like \"people\".\n\nThe bot is not supposed to change anything to the user-added addition. Potentially problematic cases are:\n\nif there are both a \"1\" and a \"caption\" parameter\".\n\nif there is a description outside of the {{BArch-description}}.\n\nThe bot should probably leave out these files for manual sorting.\n\n\"Short title\" should not be renamed to \"original title\" because \"original title\" is used on the archive's website for the full original description. I agree that their calling everything title is a bit confusing, but it will be worse if we use the same words here for something different. Beside, the \"short title\" is not really \"original\" in that it can apparently be changed by the archives (they have not done it in your example but I guess they should). Personnally I think the clearest rendering would be \"title\" for the short title\" and \"description (Bundesarcharchiv)\" for the \"archive title\". It would also be easier to translate. The main problem is that it does not match the archive's website.\n\nAbout the \"wiki description\" field: User:Raymond was keen on keeping the mouse-over tips, to provide additional information, which makes sense for several fields. The tooltip could be move out of the header, and into the description itself but it would not look so good. We could also get rid of the tooltip altogether but I think it makes it easier to see what is from the archive and what it not without looking into the code.\n\nAbout \"image ID\": \"accession number\" does not seem to be the most natural word for archives (NARA uses \"record ID\"). But if it really makes things simpler I guess it is okay.--Zolo (talk)\n\nZolo, unless someone else beats me to it, I will be happy to assist after I am done with the current run. Unfortunately, current run is interwiki sweep through all categories and after several days I am now at, letter E (see Special:Contributions/JarektBot). --Jarekt (talk)\n\nOk thanks. It is not very urgent. Interwikis are obviously useful but your bot is of great help for many other things too, couldn't its edit rate be raised a bit ?--Zolo (talk)\n\nI will check if there is a way to make it a little faster, but it is already going at pretty fast pace and most of the time is spent on following all the links on all the wikipedias. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI had requested that a bot to periodically clean the sandbox (à la en.wp or Meta), but unfortunately the user who initially agreed to create that bot has now apparently retired. Is anyone else willing to create this bot? It Is Me Here t / c\n\nThe user retired on en.wp. Just ask him/ her to join Commons. I am sure the user will create it. I don't like to bother with sandboxcleaning but why not always having a clean sandbox; I would not oppose. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nIt sounds a bit like a non issue.\n\nAnyways, you could ask User:O to add it to the cron job of his bot. -- Docu at\n\nI've now messaged him. It Is Me Here t / c\n\nSandbox cleaning will run once a day, just like the Village Pump operation. --O (谈 • висчвын) 02:06, 19 February 2012 (GMT)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jarekt (talk)\n\nHi, is here someone, who can be requested to run a bot on Czech Wikiversity? --Juandev (talk)\n\nThe SVG images of User:Loisajb do not display correctly when rendered in Firefox. The problem is the missing unit: font-size:200px. The following should fix the problems:\n\nsed -i '/font-size:[0-9.]*px/q;s/font-size:[0-9.]*/&px/g' filename.svg\n\nMy manual correction of File:HexabenzocoroneneRXN.svg worked fine. Could this task be performed by a bot? --Leyo\n\nProbably. I have created a list at User:Faebot/Sandbox, could you double check these are the files you mean? Feel free to trim the list if that is easy to do.\n\nAs I understand it, the job would be to open each of these SVG files, make the style changes in the file and create a new upload. There seems to be around 50 files. Beyond my experience, but someone else might fancy it. --Fæ (talk)\n\nThanks. I made a few changes to the list.\n\nYes, the procedure would be exactly as you described. --Leyo\n\nDone--DieBuche (talk)\n\nThank you. BTW: You missed one file. --Leyo\n\nI uploaded the source for the Bot here: https://github.com/DieBuche/WikipediaSvgScour . It's not exactly beautiful, but it does the job. You need to have Perl and Python installed. Then just run it like \"perl UploadFixedSVG.pl -f ListWithFilenamesWithoutFile:Prefix.txt\". In the beginning it is a good idea to use the -c flag, then you have a chance to inspect the new file before uploading it.--DieBuche (talk)\n\nThank you. Unfortunately, I have no experience with Perl or Python. The source code might however be helpful for others.\n\nThe new version does not seem to solve the problem here. --Leyo\n\nThe task is to go through all my uploads, and replace every instance of 'Ephemeronium' with 'Jynto', namely where the text is part of a link. That includes links to my user page, talk page and personal category. Thanks in advance. Jynto (talk)\n\nYou may use VisualFileChange for this task. Click here to start. I recommend you make some test edits or use the examine-function, type in a file-number and compare whether the right side looks like it should. Replace e.g. /[Ee]phemeronium/g (would match all occurrences of ephemeronium and Ephemeronium) with Jynto. Read the help-page linked and explore the options to save time before starting. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nDone, and moved your category to Category:Images by Jynto as well. Courcelles (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jarekt (talk)\n\nCould somebody run through Category:Blue plaques and its sub-categories, and remove {{Check categories-Geograph}} from every occurrence, please? I think this should be fairly trivial with AWB. They've all had their categorisation sorted or are in the process of having it sorted, so the tag can come off, it's just a pain to do it manually. HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?\n\nDone There was only 81 if those. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThank you! HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts?\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jarekt (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nwould it be possible to replace:\n\n{{Third year of the Czech Municipalities Photographs grant}} --> {{Mediagrant|Foto českých obcí}} in file description of this page: User:Juandev/gallery/archive 17?--Juandev (talk)\n\nDone There were 89 such files. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: Jarekt (talk)\n\nImages on Special:Search/Fæbot author=Ruslan (currently 305) including \"Ruslan\" as author need to have this replaced with {{Unknown}}.\n\nThe date on these images can be removed as well. -- Docu at\n\nIf the original burndown category is re-added, I am quite happy to change the author to unknown using Faebot, as well as make other corrections as was my original plan after mass uploading these images. I'll happily leave these to others to sort out if having a simple hidden burndown category is a major issue. I would prefer it if the original Flickr information was preserved on the image page, knowing the details of the Flickr user and their upload date is potentially useful, especially considering our experience with such Flickr accounts disappearing along with the source history. Thanks --Fæ (talk)\n\nQuestion Already taken care of?--Jarekt (talk)\n\nNo. Looking at File:Herson Cathedral.jpg one could probably also include this change diff. -- Docu at\n\nQuestion I note that the Flickr information is being put in collapsed boxes and so hidden from view. Although collapsed boxes are used in some templates for repeated information (such as the address of the British Museum) I am less certain that this is a good idea for information unique to the image. Such collapsed boxes may introduce problems in some browsers or make the pages harder to use on mobile devices or pages formatted for tablets. Thanks --Fæ (talk)\n\nI halted the edits for time being. Collapsible template seemed like the best option to me, see example [9]. Most of Flickr metadata is not particularly useful, but it should be kept. Collapsible templates are standard here: there are 456k uses of collapsible Category:Creator templates and almost as much of Institution templates. The solution proposed by user:Docu (see example) is harder to do by bot, and is equivalent to commenting it out. Should I just comment out this section? Are there other ideas? --Jarekt (talk)\n\nYes, I have an idea, leave it as is. You seem to have a solution looking for a problem as the original request here was not to blank out Flickr data from view but to improve the Author field. --Fæ (talk)\n\nI don't think the stuff should be in the description field. It can made visible with my original suggestion if we add a field to the other template. For an initial cleanup, I think the solution by Jarekt is fine as well. Thanks for helping us cleanup these entries. -- Docu at , 13:46, 4 February 2012 (UTC) (edited)\n\nI am still bothered by the license. I think most of those images are PD. A lot of them even say \"Public Domain\" in flickr description. However I am not sure on what basis: {{PD-old}}, {{Anonymous-EU}}, some Russia specific PD? Probably each one would have to be reviewed individually.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nHi, could you set this template {{Mediagrant|Události}} to the files from category:Rogar.--Juandev (talk)\n\nWhere should the template be added.\n\nReason/Justification (for the edit-summary) -- RE rillke questions?\n\nI would be grateful if somebody could generate list of images:\n\nFrom subcategory of Category:Featured pictures or Category:Quality images\n\nUsed in mainspace on Wikipedia, in article with interwiki link to plwiki ([[pl:article]])\n\nLinked to article on plwiki that is without images (list A - may be placed here ) or without images featured on commons (list B - may go here)\n\nList should use following (or similar) format (like en:User:Bulwersator/Echo/Images/Animals):\n\n==[[<title of article on plwiki>]]==\n\n[{{fullurl:<title of article on plwiki>|action=edit}} (edit)] #[[:pl:<title of article on plwiki>]]: <filename> [[File:<filename>|thumb|link=commons:<filename>|[[:<code of wiki where image was used>:<title of article on wiki where image was used>:<filename>|plwiki]]]]<br style=\"clear:both;\" />\n\nBulwersator (talk)\n\nAccording to glamorous [10] tool french 3885 featured pictures are used 13,349 times on FR wikipedia and 2,633 on Polish. 24,686 Quality images are used in 19,761 French articles and 3,016 Polish. Unfortunately I am to not sure how to find out more. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nIf you just want to illustrate articles without images, you could try https://toolserver.org/~magnus/fist.php\n\nSample: Images for articles in Category Jeziora at pl.wikipedia without images (1 level)\n\nCheers. -- Docu at\n\nInteresting and useful, thanks. Bulwersator (talk)\n\nFIST is interesting but I am interested also in search limited to featured pictures Bulwersator (talk)\n\nI didn't have any answer about my former request, that is why I make a new request here.\n\nI would like that a bot make this type of correction :\n\nput this Artwork template : the folio number (indicated in the filename) changes at each file in the title and in the accession number\n\ninclude a booknavibar\n\na defaultsort with the number of the folio or just add sort to category if it is easier\n\nIf it is impossible to make the 3 corrections, the first one would be just fine. Thanks a lot. Mel22 (talk)\n\nI was going through my watchlist and found Commons:Deletion requests/File:Anchoragecathedral.jpg, still open from 2009. The tag on the image was removed, but the discussion was never closed. Would it be possible for a bot to search for cases like this and perform some function? Possibly it would notice when images had deletion tags removed and replace them if the discussion isn't also closed? ▫ JohnnyMrNinja (talk / en)\n\nI looked into it, and there does not seem to be an easy way to do it that I can see. As a test I uploaded 25k DRs and removed all the already-cloased-ones and recent ones. I was left with ~1000k oddballs like files with non-matching closing tags, files with unusual closing tags, DRs for files already deleted but not closed and open DRs for files which are still around (or reuploaded). After some more manual cleanup I closed many of them, but there are still ~170 DRs left. In some cases nominator removed DR tag from the image but nobody closed DR, or DR was never started properly. You can find the current list at Commons:Deletion requests/2012-02-20 Old oddballs. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nThere is a problem with Template:OTRS that occurs in many pages: If the ticket number is parameter 1, parameter 2 (usually the date or a user) is taken for the link. Hence, such links do not lead to the correct tickets. Examples: File:Benz-Motorspritze Typ 1 CS.jpg, File:Marbach-Stanzform.JPG, File:Uwe Böden-1 retouched.jpg. Could such cases be fixed by a bot? --Leyo\n\nActually, couldn't it be fixed by syncing the local template with the German one to make them both read the variables correctly? Magog the Ogre (talk)\n\nThere is now a suggested fix on Template talk:OTRS. --Leyo\n\nHi! Can you add this category to all files uploaded by me? (Where it's not added, of course). Kobac (talk)\n\nYou may use VisualFileChange for this task. Click here to start. Action: Append text. You can filter out those uploads without your category using cute selection: First select all, then deselect those with your cat. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nCat-a-lot combined with Search might be easier. -- Docu at\n\nI know this methods, but I was uploaded up to 10000-15000 files. Can you find my latest files via simple search? There is no \"Kobac\" word in descriptions, because most of them are from Flickr. So I can't use the Cat-a-lot. VisualFileChange is not useful for so many contribs too. (( Kobac (talk)\n\nI understand why people want to have categories of files created by them, but I am not sure why would it be useful to you or anybody else to group 15k files uploaded by you in a single category. If you want to keep track of them you can use a user namespace gallery, if it is more convenient than Special:ListFiles/Kobac. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nOK, do you know a simple tool for creating the list of my files on a one page? Kobac (talk)\n\nAre you aware of the fact that VisualFileChange has advanced settings now allowing to increase the number of files loaded with each click on more/scroll down? And did you know that if you executed an operation and relaunch VisualFileChange on the same target, it allows you to continue after the last loaded file? (A yellow message box will appear in the target-selection dialogue). Clicking the link will a) load the next files, b) fill-in the last action and options. Dependent on you RAM you can load 400-4000 images into the dialogue.\n\nWith Gallery tool, you can export a list of currently loaded files. But this also requires some clicks/ restarts if you do not have a super-computer.\n\nWikisense gallery has some output options (not as flexible as Gallery-Tool) but may be faster\n\nFinally, you can query the API (list=logevents, leaction=upload/upload) directly. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nWould it be possible to generate (on a regular basis) a list of Category:Meta categories that contain other items than categories ? This looks pretty much complicated to do with templates such as for Category:Non-empty category redirects. Thank you. --Foroa (talk)\n\nI do not think we can do it using templates, but you should vote for bugzilla:14237 and we might. --Jarekt (talk)\n\nI think that you underestimate the complexity to move from one global counter to 20+ separate counters. Maybe that could be possible with database queries. --Foroa (talk)\n\nIs it really impossible to do with templates? {{Category redirect}} contains the following bit of code:\n\n{{#ifexpr:{{PAGESINCAT:{{PAGENAME}}|R}}>0|[[Category:Non-empty category redirects]]}}\n\nCan this not be amended into something similar that would work? I have to say I did not look into it deeply but it seems feasible. Place Clichy\n\nYou have the right idea but unfortunately that template relies on {{PAGESINCAT}} parser function, and there is no equivalent function that can count separately files and categories. bugzilla:14237 requests such functionality. The only way I can see is to write a bot that queries the toolserver but than I am not sure how to do it \"on a regular basis\". --Jarekt (talk)\n\nDone\n\nTo add information templates to most files in Frederic Logghe Maritime photo collection, this conversion could be applied to them. Categories would remain as is.\n\nCurrently, there are 1332 of 1377 images without {{Information}}: CatScan2\n\nBTW, there is also a batch uploading request for the remaining images in the collection (Commons:Batch uploading/Maritime photo collection). -- Docu at\n\n10 of them obviously didn't match my 3 regexps.

I want to ask about possible help in future.\n\nI'm planning to upload a lot of signatures of politicians from HAVEL'S HOUSE OF HISTORY. I can download and upload them with Commonist, but I can't put the different titles and provide direct links in descriptions. Could you make these changes?\n\nFor example, we have File:Stoltenberg, Gerhard signature.jpg.\n\n|Description=Signature of... ==> |Description=Signature of Stoltenberg, Gerhard |Source=[http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/germanpoliticalleadersSTO-STRA.htm HAVEL'S HOUSE OF HISTORY] ==> |Source=[http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/germanpoliticalleadersSTO-STRA.htm HAVEL'S HOUSE OF HISTORY] ([http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/Stoltenberg, Gerhard signature.jpg (direct link)].\n\nKobac (talk)\n\nI would use the Commonist tool for the upload that would allow you to add a different description for each file, although it would not let you add different sources. Also in the past I found CSVLoader Plugin to AutoWikiBrowser to be a useful tool for adding info from a spreadsheet to a list of files. One can also use Pywikipediabot, although that one is harder to use for one time jobs. And if you can not get those to work for you me or someone else can probably help out.--Jarekt (talk)\n\nCommonist helps to upload files with different descriptions, but you need to put them manually that not actual for several hundreds of files, so I need the bot who will put a part of filename to description as a title and will put full filename as a part of source URL. Kobac (talk)\n\nI could improve VisualFileChange to allow replacing with variables like %TITLE% or %SIZE%.
