        "text": "Whether you’re hitting the road for a weekend getaway, navigating a new city to track down that must-try food truck, or trying to avoid traffic on your way to school, Google Maps and Waze show you the information you need to get to your destination in the best way possible. Today, we're launching even more helpful information to keep you safer and informed while on-the-go.\n\nMore easily report incidents in Maps to help your community\n\nSay you’re driving and traffic suddenly comes to a halt. To help keep your fellow drivers informed on the road, Maps is making it easier to report incidents and helpful information, like nearby construction, lane closures, objects and police presence — these reports come from the Maps and Waze communities, and you can even see which app a report came from. You'll see larger reporting icons that are easier to tap so you can more quickly share updates — like that closed lane that backed up traffic on your way to work. Other drivers can then confirm the incident with just a tap to help drivers passing by. This improved way to report incidents on Maps is rolling out globally now on Android and iOS, cars with Google built-in, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.\n\nTake the stress out of getting to your destination with new guidance in Maps\n\nNavigating to new buildings — like a friend's large apartment complex — can be confusing when you don’t know where to enter or park once you arrive. Now, when you’re driving to a place, Maps’ new destination guidance will automatically light up your building and its entrance as you approach it, in addition to showing you nearby parking lots. This can be especially helpful if you’re heading to an unfamiliar place when it’s dark out or late at night. Destination guidance in Maps starts rolling out globally on Android and iOS, cars with Google Built-in, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay in the coming weeks.\n\nBe aware during your drive with new camera alerts in Waze\n\nSome cities around the world are adding cameras to enforce things like speed limits or carpool lanes. To help you be more aware during your drive and comply with local laws, we’re adding the ability to see new camera types on Waze. These alerts are added by Waze community members, who use a combination of real world road information and publicly available data from local authorities to update the map. For example, you’ll now see an alert if you’re approaching a camera that snaps pictures for things like speeding, running a red light, using the wrong lane (like bus, HOV or carpool), not wearing a seatbelt, or using phones while driving. These alerts serve as a helpful reminder about an area’s traffic rules, so you can make any necessary adjustments. New camera types on Waze are rolling out globally on Android and iOS.\n\nShare real-time traffic information with friends in Waze\n\nEvents like parades, concerts and sporting events are fun, but they can result in congestion on the road. With Waze’s new traffic events feature, you'll get a better understanding of how these events are impacting nearby traffic. If you’ve recently driven through an impacted area or have places saved near the area in Waze, you’ll get a notification once the event has started. We’ll show you helpful details like the cause of the event, if there are road closures and real-time traffic conditions. And to help your friends and family, you’ll be able to easily share these details with them so they can be more prepared for their own ride. The new traffic events feature in Waze is rolling out globally on Android and iOS now.\n\nNavigate while your screen is locked with Waze\n\nTo help you navigate more conveniently, Waze drivers can now get navigation guidance — like turn-by-turn directions, real-time traffic updates or hazard alerts — all while their phone remains securely locked. Lock screen navigation launches globally on Waze on Android this month, and will come to iOS this fall.\n\nThese new features and helpful alerts on Google Maps and Waze will help keep you informed on all of your travels."
