        "text": "As global communities responded to COVID-19, we heard from public health officials that the same type of aggregated, anonymized insights we use in products such as Google Maps would be helpful as they made critical decisions to combat COVID-19.\n\nThese Community Mobility Reports aimed to provide insights into what changed in response to policies aimed at combating COVID-19. The reports charted movement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential.\n\nPreserving privacy\n\nThe Community Mobility Reports were developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and protecting peopleâs privacy. No personally identifiable information, such as an individualâs location, contacts or movement, was made available at any point.\n\nInsights in these reports were created with aggregated, anonymized sets of data from users who had turned on the Location History setting, which is off by default. People who have Location History turned on can choose to turn it off at any time from their Google Account and can always delete Location History data directly from their Timeline.\n\nWe also used the same world-class anonymization technology used in our products every day to keep your activity data private and secure. This includes differential privacy, which adds artificial noise to our datasets, enabling us to generate insights while preventing the identification of any individual person.\n\nVisit Google's Privacy Policy to learn more about how we keep your data private, safe and secure."
