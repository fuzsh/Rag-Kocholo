        "text": "Market the blog posts, events, or products included on your site with a compelling image.\n\nSquarespace uses featured images to represent individual collection items — like blog posts, events, and products — in different areas of your site. For example, you can use a summary block to display posts from your blog page that include the featured image from each post.\n\nIf your site is on version 7.0, you can also add page featured images to appear on index pages and create per-page banner images in some templates.\n\nWe recommend always adding featured images when the option is available to create a great visual experience on your site. For help formatting images before uploading, visit Formatting your images for display on the web.\n\nTip: When you share a link from your site on social media, your social sharing image may display instead of the item or page featured image. To learn more about what displays, visit How content displays in social posts.\n\nCollection item featured images\n\nCollection item featured image represent individual blog posts, events, and products across your site. They may also display when the items are shared on social media.\n\nOn version 7.0, some templates use collection item featured images to create a banner image.\n\nHow you add a collection item featured image depends on which version of Squarespace your site is on.\n\nPage featured images (version 7.0)\n\nVersion 7.1 doesn't use page featured images. To create a banner image, add a section background image to a page section instead. To represent the page on social media, add an Alternate Social Sharing Image.\n\nPage featured images appear on index pages and create per-page banner images in some templates. Some templates also support adding videos.\n\nTroubleshooting gallery page featured images\n\nIn most templates, if the gallery page doesn't have a featured image, it automatically creates one from the first image in the gallery. Use the steps above to replace this with a different image, or delete it altogether.\n\nIn some templates, if you delete the page featured image, the gallery's first image automatically becomes the featured image when you make any change to the gallery. This is most noticeable in templates where the featured image creates a page banner.\n\nIn these instances, you can delete the new featured image from page settings to remove it after each change. Note that if you manually add a featured image in page settings, the featured image won't automatically update when you make changes to the gallery. To mimic the look of no banner, upload a featured image of a solid color that matches your background.\n\nHow featured images display"
