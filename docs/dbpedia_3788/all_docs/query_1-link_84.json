It's really easy and quick to set up and requires no extra changes to your website.\n\n@marckohlbrugge, maker of BetaList.com, StartUp.jobs and others\n\nWe strive for minimal downtime, but if something goes wrong UptimeRobot makes sure that we know about it quickly. We switched to using UptimeRobot years ago as they offered the same services we were getting from a different provider but at a fraction of the cost.\n\nI've been using UptimeRobot for years as a cost-effective way to quickly alert me when my sites were down - and when they were back up.\n\n~ Steve \"ardalis\" Smith, Software Architect"
