        "text": "The average person can spend up to eight hours a day on internet applications. Whether for work, school, communications, or education, apps have become integral to our way of life. For service providers, this means that the application quality of experience (App QoE) you deliver is inextricably linked to your customers’ satisfaction.\n\nAs the App QoE company, Sandvine solutions continuously monitor, detect, and troubleshoot application quality so that service providers can ensure the best possible application experience and resolve network issues before they become customer issues.\n\nRead our latest report on application usage, growth, and trends and see how important applications are to your customers, your network, and your business.\n\nDownload Report\n\nIn this report, we offer a greater understanding about the impact of apps and mashups, multiplexing and new transport and security protocols in order to help service providers plan for future service and capacity growth, and optimize QoE, while also securing networks.\n\nWe want service providers to be in the driver’s seat, and we’ve leveraged enriched “application and network intelligence” to dig up the trends that will help them analyze, optimize, and monetize applications to deliver high quality customer experiences.\n\nDownload Report\n\nThis edition is solely focused on mobile data in order to provide a targeted model that mobile operators can draw from to begin their planning process. The Mobile Internet Phenomena Report ranks applications based on their “traffic share.” The fascinating data that fuels the report illustrates the disconnect between “market share” for companies defined by subscriber counts and how often subscribers use a service.\n\nTraffic share is defined as the percentage of network resources used by a specific application relative to other applications.\n\nDownload Report\n\nThe COVID-19 worldwide pandemic has drastically affected network usage around the world, with many operators experiencing 100% growth in traffic volume as usage shifts from enterprise and education networks to primarily consumer broadband networks.\n\nWe at Sandvine want to ensure that network operators can continue to deliver high quality internet services that consumers depend on during these times, and this report is our contribution to the network industry during these times of change.\n\nDownload Report\n\nStreaming video is over 65% of all mobile traffic by volume\n\nYouTube is more than 25% of total worldwide mobile traffic by volume\n\nFacebook Video has grown substantially over the past year to #2 worldwide at over 17% of total traffic volume\n\nView Mobile Webinar\n\nDownload Report\n\nDownload Webinar PDF\n\nbut the content sources for this video are fragmenting from the convenience of Netflix as the aggregator to many brands with unique original offerings. This has a big effect on overall internet traffic patterns, as it has also resulted in an increase in file sharing as users seek to avoid spending more money on subscriptions.\n\nView Webinar\n\nDownload Report\n\nDownload Webinar PDF"
