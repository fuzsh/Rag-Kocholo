Twitter), Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, and more.\n\nKarin Olafson, Tony Tran August 1, 2024 12 min read\n\nSocial media image sizes seem to change constantly.\n\nOne moment you have the perfect cover page for your account. The next, it’s been resized and looks all pixelated and wrong.\n\nIt doesn’t help that information about official dimensions and image sizes is harder to find than a civil discussion on politics on Facebook.\n\nBut, it’s not difficult if you consult this guide to social media image sizes on all important social media platforms!\n\nBelow are the most recent social media image dimensions, as of August 2024.\n\n#1 Social Media Tool\n\nCreate. Schedule. Publish. Engage. Measure. Win.\n\nFree 30-Day Trial\n\nQuick social media image sizes\n\nWe go into more detail for every single network below, but this image includes the social media image sizes you probably look up most often.\n\nBasic Instagram image sizes\n\nProfile photo: 320 x 320 px\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 px\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 px\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080\n\nStories and Reels: 1080 x 1920\n\nBasic Facebook image sizes\n\nProfile photo: 170 x 170 px\n\nLandscape: 1200 x 630 px\n\nPortrait: 630 x 1200 px\n\nSquare: 1200 x 1200 px\n\nStories and Reels: 1080 x 1920 px\n\nCover photo: 851 x 315 px\n\nBasic X (formerly Twitter) image sizes\n\nProfile photo: 400 x 400 px\n\nLandscape: 1600 x 900 px\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 px\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 px\n\nCover photo: 1500 x 500 px\n\nBasic LinkedIn image sizes\n\nProfile photo: 400 x 400 px\n\nLandscape: 1200 x 627 px\n\nPortrait: 627 x 1200 px\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 px\n\nCover photo: 1128 x 191 px\n\nBasic TikTok image sizes\n\nProfile photo: 200 x 200 px\n\nLandscape: 1920 x 1080 px\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1920 px\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 px\n\nStories: 1080 x 1920 px\n\nBonus: Get the always-up-to-date social media image size cheat sheet. The free resource includes recommended photo dimensions for every type of image on every major network.\n\nInstagram image sizes\n\nInstagram supports horizontally and vertically oriented images. It also still supports square images, which was what the platform was known for when it first launched.\n\nThis increases your brand’s options. But it also makes image dimensions a little trickier to get right. Follow these guidelines to make sure your images end up looking their best.\n\nInstagram profile picture size: 320 x 320 pixels\n\nInstagram profile photos are displayed at 110 x 100 pixels, but the image files are stored at 320 x 320 pixels, so make sure to upload an image that’s least that big.\n\nEven though the dimensions are in a square format, Instagram profile photos are displayed as a circle. Make sure any elements you want to focus on in the photo are centered so they don’t get cropped out.\n\nInstagram post sizes (feed photos):\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 pixels\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nSupported aspect ratios: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nRecommended image size: Width of 1080 pixels, height between 566 and 1350 pixels (depending on whether the image is landscape or portrait)\n\nTips:\n\nIf you want your images to look their best on Instagram, aim to upload an image that is 1080 pixels wide.\n\nWhen you share an Instagram image that’s sized over 1080 pixels, Instagram will size it down to 1080 pixels.\n\nIf you share a photo that has a resolution lower than 320 pixels, Instagram will size it up to 320 pixels.\n\nIf your image is between 320 and 1080 pixels wide, Instagram will keep that photo at its original resolution, “as long as the photo’s aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4:5 (a height between 566 and 1350 pixels with a width of 1080 pixels).”\n\nIf your uploaded Instagram image is a different ratio, the platform will automatically crop your photo to fit a supported ratio.\n\nResource: Learn how to edit Instagram photos like a pro.\n\nInstagram photo thumbnail sizes:\n\nDisplay size: 161 x 161 pixels\n\nRecommended upload size: 1080 pixels wide\n\nTips:\n\nRemember that Instagram stores versions of these thumbnails that are as large as 1080 x 1080.\n\nTo future-proof your Instagram feed and avoid pixelation, upload images that are as large as possible.\n\nInstagram Stories image size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nTips:\n\nThis is an aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nUploading an image with a smaller pixel size (but the same aspect ratio) means the Story will buffer quickly.\n\nIf you don’t use this ratio, the Story might show with strange cropping, zooming, or leave large sections of the screen blank.\n\nInstagram Reels use this same sizing.\n\nResource: Take your Instagram Stories to the next level with these free templates.\n\nInstagram carousel image sizes:\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080 x 1350 pixels\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: landscape (1.91:1), square (1:1), vertical (4:5)\n\nRecommended image size: Width of 1080 pixels, height between 566 and 1350 pixels (depending on whether the image is landscape or portrait)\n\nInstagram Reels sizes:\n\n1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nThis is an aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nCover photo: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nKeep in mind that Reels are cropped to a 1:1 image in your profile feed and a 4:5 image in the home feed.\n\nInstagram ads image sizes:\n\nLandscape: 1080 x 566 pixels\n\nSquare: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nMinimum width: 320 pixels\n\nMaximum width: 1080 pixels\n\nSupported aspect ratios: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nTips:\n\nRemember: Instagram ads appearing in users’ feeds cannot have more than 30 hashtags.\n\nThere are also recommendations for the number of characters included in an ad’s primary text and headline.\n\nImage sizes for Instagram Stories ads: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nTips:\n\nInstagram recommends leaving roughly “14% (250 pixels) of the top and bottom of the image free from text and logos” to prevent them from being covered.\n\nAs of September 2020, Facebook and Instagram ads are no longer penalized if more than 20% of the ad space is text.\n\nThe formula for going viral\n\nEverything you need to make engaging content. AI support for captions, an AI hashtag generator, and access to Canva in Hootsuite.\n\nGet 30 days for $0\n\nTweets that include images consistently get more click-throughs, more likes, and more Retweets than non-image Tweets. In fact, Tweets with visual content are three times more likely to get engagement.\n\nSo, choosing the right images and creating great visual content for X (formerly Twitter) matters.
