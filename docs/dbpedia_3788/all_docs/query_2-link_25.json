Although LinkedIn is traditionally about words, not so much about pictures, it is still important to post images on LinkedIn.\n\nYou may attract a different audience or a wider audience if you add images to your LinkedIn posts. Also, please bear in mind, there are many areas of LinkedIn where it is almost REQUIRED to add an image. In several places on LinkedIn – in posts as well as in profiles – LinkedIn provide a ‘place holder’ image for you to add your own.\n\nIt is not compulsory to add your own image in these places but if you don’t, you’ll be displaying LinkedIn’s default image. Not only does this not look very attractive but, by not adding your own image, you are missing out on a fantastic marketing opportunity.\n\nYou can add your logo, your photo or any other image you like to highlight your authority or offer your audience another way to get to know you better.\n\nIn order to save you some time I’ve put together a complete guide to image sizes you may need to use across LinkedIn. I’ve separated them into categories to make your life easier too. Please remember that personal profiles have different image sizes from company pages!\n\nIf you like this handy guide, I would really appreciate you doing me a favour back.
