        "text": "Reports that a given region of the image has been updated. The application might choose to redisplay the specified area, for example, in order to provide a progressive display effect, or perform other incremental processing.\n\nNote that different image format readers may produce decoded pixels in a variety of different orders. Many readers will produce pixels in a simple top-to-bottom, left-to-right-order, but others may use multiple passes of interlacing, tiling, etc. The sequence of updates may even differ from call to call depending on network speeds, for example. A call to this method does not guarantee that all the specified pixels have actually been updated, only that some activity has taken place within some subregion of the one specified.\n\nThe particular ImageReader implementation may choose how often to provide updates. Each update specifies that a given region of the image has been updated since the last update. A region is described by its spatial bounding box (minX, minY, width, and height); X and Y subsampling factors (periodX and periodY); and a set of updated bands (bands). For example, the update:\n\nminX = 10 minY = 20 width = 3 height = 4 periodX = 2 periodY = 3 bands = { 1, 3 }\n\nwould indicate that bands 1 and 3 of the following pixels were updated:\n\n(10, 20) (12, 20) (14, 20) (10, 23) (12, 23) (14, 23) (10, 26) (12, 26) (14, 26) (10, 29) (12, 29) (14, 29)"
