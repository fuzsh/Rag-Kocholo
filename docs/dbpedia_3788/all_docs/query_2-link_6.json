        "text": "Let's face it; you only have one chance to grab someone’s attention on social media.\n\nThese days, getting someone to stop scrolling and take a closer look at your client’s post is easier said than done. Your best bet is to show users an eye-catching visual that immediately stands out from everything else in their feed.\n\nIf your social media marketing is to work, your images must be the correct size. Otherwise, it will be a distorted mess that pushes people away instead of pulling them in.\n\nThis guide will give you an up-to-date cheat sheet of social media image sizes in 2024.\n\nWhy Is it Important to Use the Correct Image Size?\n\nAs a marketing agency, you know that time is of the essence. It may be tempting to repurpose social media images across platforms, but you also risk cutting out visuals, copy, and other vital parts of your client’s artwork.\n\nNot only does it negatively affect your client’s brand reputation, but it can also affect your agency’s credibility. Going with the recommended social media image sizes may take a bit more time to develop, but it’s always worth it in the long run.\n\nFor effective display on platforms like Twitter, ensure that your images meet the minimum image size requirements, such as 400x400 pixels for profile pictures and 440x220 pixels for in-stream/post images.\n\nQuit wasting billable time and start reporting in 11 seconds flat. Access the social media monthly report template built for marketing agencies.\n\nBest Social Media Image Sizes Your Agency Should Know\n\nThere’s no shortage of social media platforms, so we understand the struggle of remembering all those dimension sizes. Thankfully, we’ve created this cheat sheet that you can easily reference and bookmark for later!\n\nHere are the nine social media platforms that you should know image sizes for:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nVimeo\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nBest Social Media Image Sizes Guide Infographic\n\nThis handy infographic gives you all of the details you need for social media image sizes in 2024.\n\nFacebook Image Sizes\n\nAs you probably know, Facebook is the world’s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users.\n\nIn the United States alone, there was a whopping 246 million users in 2023, an increase of over 6 million users from 2021.\n\nSo if your client’s target audience is located in the United States, there's an excellent chance of reaching them on Facebook. And it’s probably safe to assume that the same applies to European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.\n\nBecause users are so bombarded with content, creating fantastic content is more important than ever, so you can’t afford to have poor-quality images. Make sure to use a photo editor to get the best out of your existing images while maintaining quality.\n\nProfile Photo\n\nYour client’s Facebook profile picture is displayed as 170x170 pixels on your Facebook page on desktop computers, 128x128 pixels on smartphones, and 36x36 on feature phones.\n\nNote that this square picture will be cropped into a circular image when displayed next to ads and posts, so make sure it looks good in that shape as well. Also, if your profile picture has text in it, a PNG file format may work best.\n\nCover Photo\n\nA Facebook cover photo is the background image that appears at the top of a personal profile or a business page behind the profile picture.\n\nIt is displayed at 820x312 pixels on your page on desktop and 640x360 on smartphones (it doesn’t display on feature phones).\n\nThe minimum cover photo size is 400x150 pixels.\n\nIt will load fastest as an sRGB JPG file with dimensions of 851x315 and a file size of less than 100kb.\n\nLike profile pictures, if your cover photo has text, you may want to consider the PNG file format.\n\nShared Image\n\nThe recommended image upload size for a shared image post is 1200x630 pixels.\n\nNote that it will appear in the feed at a max width of 470 pixels and on a page at a max width of 504 pixels.\n\nIt will scale to the maximum aspect ratio of 1:1.\n\nShared Link\n\nThe recommended size for a shared link post image is 1200x630 pixels.\n\nThe minimum size for square images is 154x154 pixels in feed and 116x116 on your page.\n\nThe minimum size for rectangular images is 470x246 pixels in feed and 484x252 on your page.\n\nKeep in mind that if you use images under these minimum dimensions, Facebook will scale them accordingly.\n\nFacebook Event Cover Image\n\nThe recommended image upload size for the event image is 1920x1005 pixels.\n\nHighlighted Image\n\nThe recommended image upload size for a highlighted image is 1200x717 pixels.\n\nIt will be displayed on your page at 843x504 pixels.\n\nInstagram Image Sizes\n\nInstagram has over 2 billion monthly active users, and 61.1% of Instagram’s global audience is aged 18-34.\n\nSo, if your client wants to reach a younger demographic, Instagram is where they are at.\n\nInstagram is probably the most competitive platform when it comes to image quality. The Instagram feed consists solely of images, so if you want your client’s content to stand out, you’ll need to take your visual content to the next level.\n\nAfter all, social media influencers who post professional-quality photos have set the bar high, so ordinary users are now spoiled because they expect stunning visuals on their feed 24/7.\n\nLow-quality, poorly edited, blurry images won’t fly on any major social network, but on Instagram, they are especially crippling to your client’s brand image.\n\nSo be prepared to go the extra mile to produce beautiful images if you are serious about driving growth in your client's Instagram metrics.\n\nProfile Picture\n\nThe Instagram profile picture is displayed at 110x110 pixels and stored at 320x320 pixels.\n\nKeep in mind that this square photo will be cropped into a circular image and shown as such.\n\nPhoto Thumbnails\n\nPhoto thumbnails are displayed at 161x161 pixels.\n\nImage Posts\n\nInstagram keeps images with a width between 320 and 1080 pixels in their original resolution as long as the aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4.5.\n\nIdeally, square images should be 1080 x 1080 pixels, landscape images should be 1080 x 566 pixels, and portrait images should be 1080 x 1350 pixels.\n\nImages with a lower resolution will be enlarged to a width of 320 pixels, and images with a higher resolution will be scaled down to a width of 1080 pixels.\n\nAlso, if you upload an image with an aspect ratio that Instagram doesn’t support, it will crop the image to fit it into a supported ratio.\n\nInstagram offers tips to those who want to make sure that their image is shared with a width of 1080 pixels:\n\nDownload the most recent version of the Instagram app\n\nUpload a photo with a width of at least 1080 pixels with an aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4.5\n\nUse a phone with a high-quality camera when taking the photo\n\nOnce again, Instagram is probably the most competitive social network in terms of image quality, so it makes sense to follow these guidelines to maximize image resolution.\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nUsing a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels with an aspect ratio of 9:16 for Instagram Stories is recommended.\n\nThe maximum file size is 4GB.\n\nTikTok Image Sizes\n\nThere are an astounding 1 billion TikTok users, with 43.7% of those users aged 18 to 24. It’s the place to be if you’re a Gen Z!\n\nTikTok has even surpassed the number of users on Instagram. With its video editing capabilities, catchy challenges, and a wide array of music options, TikTok is an engaging platform with the potential for a tremendous reach.\n\nIt’s important to shoot fun, vibrant videos to create engaging TikTok content that is personable and easy to digest.\n\nProfile Picture\n\nThe minimum size for a TikTok profile photo is 20x20 pixels.\n\nVideo Size\n\nBecause TikTok is a video-based platform, it’s important to note that the recommended size is 1080x1920 pixels with a 9:16 aspect ratio.\n\nTwitter Image Sizes\n\nTwitter has over 436 million monthly active users. It’s where people go to see what various public figures (politicians, entrepreneurs, journalists, etc.) have to say. Although Twitter is a text-dominant platform, attaching images to tweets has become increasingly common since it helps tweets stand out in the feed.\n\nProfile Photo\n\nThe recommended image upload size for a Twitter profile photo is 400x400 pixels.\n\nThe maximum file size for profile photos is 2MB.\n\nNote that this square image will be cropped and displayed as a circular image.\n\nHeader Photo\n\nThe recommended image upload size for the header photo is 1500x500 pixels.\n\nThe maximum file size for the header image is 2MB.\n\nIn-Stream Photos\n\nYou can also attach a GIF or up to four images to a tweet.\n\nThe recommended aspect ratio for an image is 16:9, or an image size of 1200x675 pixels.\n\nImages have a maximum file size limit of 5MB. Meanwhile, animated GIFs have a maximum file size limit of 5MB on mobile and 15MB on the web application.\n\nNote: Twitter only supports looping animated GIFs, so if your GIF doesn’t loop and only plays once, it will be displayed as a static image.\n\nYouTube Image Sizes\n\nYouTube is the second largest social network with over 2.5 billion monthly active users. The U.S. alone has 247 million users, so YouTube is an excellent platform to reach an American audience.\n\nHowever, like Instagram, YouTube is another social network that is highly competitive in terms of visual content, most notably videos and video thumbnails. That's why standing out in YouTube search results is critical.\n\nAfter all, your client can have the greatest video in the world, but if the thumbnail is not enticing, no one will click on it.\n\nChannel Profile Photo\n\nThe recommended YouTube channel profile photo size is 800x800 pixels. It will be displayed at 98x98 pixels.\n\nRemember that this square image will be cropped into and displayed as a circular image.\n\nChannel Cover Photo\n\nThe recommended image size for YouTube channel cover photos, also known as channel art, is 2560x1440 pixels.\n\nThe maximum file size limit is 6MB.\n\nVideo Thumbnail\n\nThe minimum width for a YouTube video thumbnail is 640 pixels.\n\nHowever, the recommended image size is 1280x720 pixels, with a maximum file size of 2MB.\n\nThe ideal aspect ratio is 16:9.\n\nYou can use a different aspect ratio, but then YouTube will add black space either to the sides of the image or to the bottom and to the top of the image to make it fit the thumbnail.\n\nVimeo Image Sizes\n\nVimeo is a video-sharing platform that offers both free and subscription-based services. Its customer and viewing bases are geared toward artistic creators who value high-quality content.\n\nWhile the platform may not be as mainstream as YouTube, Vimeo’s worldwide quarterly revenue was $108 million in the first quarter of 2022 which was a 20% increase from 2021. It’s a consideration for creators with a very specific target market.\n\nProfile Photo\n\nThe minimum profile image size is 600x600 pixels. It’s recommended to have a resolution of 120 x1200 pixels for that high-quality finish.\n\nVideo Thumbnail\n\nVimeo recommends uploading a video thumbnail that’s the same dimensions as the actual video. The maximum thumbnail size is 9600x5400 pixels.\n\nIt’s also recommended to have an image that’s high-resolution and attention-grabbing (without being clickbait).
