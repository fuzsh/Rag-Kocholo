Is the Wikibase part of the page indeed under full (sysop) protection? --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nThat is weird. The text This page is currently protected, and can be edited only by administrators. comes from Template:Protectedpagetext/PageProtected, but the expected text is at Template:Protectedpagetext/PageAutopatrolProtected. Both of these are transcluded by MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext depending on its first parameter $1. Here's the wikitext:\n\n{{#switch: {{{1|$1}}} | editprotected = {{Protectedpagetext/PageProtected}} <!-- Fully protected --> | templateeditor = {{Protectedpagetext/PageTemplateProtected}} <!-- Template protected --> | editautopatrolprotected = {{Protectedpagetext/PageAutopatrolProtected}} <!-- editautopatrolprotected --> | #default = {{Protectedpagetext/PageSemiProtected}} <!-- Semi-protected --> }}\n\nPer mw:Manual:Interface/Protectedpagetext: $1 - the raw name of the right which is needed to edit the page. Special:ExpandTemplates for page File:Kalocsaizsuzsa.jpg and wikitext {{PROTECTIONLEVEL:edit}} gives editautopatrolprotected, as expected, but \"protection level\" and \"name of the right\" might not be the same. —⁠andrybak (talk)\n\neditautopatrolprotected was added to MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext in Special:Diff/853065284 by User:GPSLeo, who is also the author of Template:Protectedpagetext/PageAutopatrolProtected. Perhaps they can check what went wrong. —⁠andrybak (talk)\n\nThis is the relevant code, I guess. There are editprotected and editsemiprotected hardcoded as the only options there. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nSo, if MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext depended on {{PROTECTIONLEVEL:edit}} rather than the proper parametre, it would be a quick fix at least. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nHmm. For reference, English Wikipedia's en:MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext has a similar #switch, with protect, editprotected, templateeditor, and extendedconfirmed.\n\nSearching the code of MediaWiki,[1] I also found mentions of Protectedpagetext in PermissionManager.php,[2] which passes as the first parameter $1 either the string protect or a variable $right, which comes from function getRestrictions of RestrictionStore. My knowledge of PHP is limited, but I'd guess that possible values for restrictions come from $wgRestrictionLevels, hence templateeditor and editautopatrolprotected in Commons' version and templateeditor and extendedconfirmed in enwiki's version. —⁠andrybak (talk)\n\n{{MediaWiki:Protectedpagetext|{{PROTECTIONLEVEL:edit}}}} on File:Kalocsaizsuzsa.jpg would display Template:Protectedpagetext/PageAutopatrolProtected.\n\nWonder if it works correctly on enwiki, w:Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Protected_page_text/extendedconfirmed has no uses.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kalocsaizsuzsa.jpg?uselang=qqx shows (protectedpagetext: editprotected, edit)\n\nNot sure what {{CASCADINGSOURCES}} is meant to do.\n\nMaybe we could insert a switch based on Protectionlevel after \"|editprotected =\". Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI tried to look into this at test.wikipedia.org, but the settings there are different.\n\nHere what is displayed on a file description page comes from javascript var \"wbmiProtectionMsg\". This might be filled with the actual protection level of the javascript source. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI tried it out on Commons Beta Wiki [1][2] and it seems to work if you use {{PROTECTIONLEVEL:edit}}. —Matrix(!) {user - talk? - uselesscontributions}\n\nPlease make an edit request if you think you have a working solution.

Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI've made the edit, it should work now (give some time for cache to update) —Matrix(!) {user - talk? - uselesscontributions}\n\nI think CASCADINGSOURCES means sources of cascade protection. Alfa-ketosav (talk)\n\nJust wondering, is there a technical difference in the backend between the following ways:\n\n1. Special:Upload\n\n2. https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=\n\n3. Special:UploadWizard (the actual upload step, not the steps before and afterwards)\n\n4. Cross-wiki media upload tool\n\n5. pybot upload function\n\nSome observations:\n\nI'd expect #1 and #2 to be the same, but somehow uploads are less likely to fail if one creates the file description page first and then uses the \"upload\" link there (#2).\n\nThe documentation for #4 mentions the api. Presumably this is the same being used by #5. The test I did with #4 seemed to work better than #3 usually does.\n\nIf ask for ranking the reliability of these tools, I'd say #5/#4, #2, #1, #3. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nStill curious about this. Maybe #2 works better than #1 as it doesn't involve creating the page. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\n1 and 2 are exactly the same. But indeed if there is no page yet, more operations are involved. And if you upload a new version of the same file, there will also be more operations that are involved and all need to succeed (archiving the old file).\n\n3 uses Chunked uploading, which is a lot more complex than 1 and 2, but can also support much larger files\n\n4 uses JS to upload to the api. This is another entry point into 1/2, but behind the entry point it works identical.\n\n5 uses the same apis as 4 and 3 (and can do both chunked and non-chunked)\n\nThe backend is not the full story however. Each frontend/entrypoint has to implement multiple 'recovery' procedures that may improved reliability of uploading. Session expiration, dropped connection, token refreshing etc. all can be handled by each entrypoint (or not). —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nsomehow coord of File:Ccmhj.jpg from an iphone 14 pro was not detected by commons. a bot to check metadata and fill the coords into sdc would be nice.

Gestumblindi (talk)\n\nDelReqHandler links appear for requests from April 18 and newer, but not for older April requests. I suppose something around April 18 went wrong?

They used to be rendered and shown correctly. Since the graphic hasn't changed sind March 2023, it appears something with the SVG renderer ist broken. Does anyone know what happened? --DeWikiMan (talk)\n\nPossibly the use of fill:currentColor and stroke:currentColor. WMF supports SVG 1.1. File claims to be SVG 1.1 (which uses a subset of CSS 2), but currentColor is from CSS 3. The value is supposed to select the current value of the color property. GNUPlot is not emitting SVG 1.1. The WMF renderer was changed (April 2024?) to a version that is a few years behind the latest release. Maybe a more recent version of librsvg (the WMF renderer) supports the property. Glrx (talk)\n\nThank you Glrx for the suggestion.\n\nI substituted all occurences of \"currentColor\" with \"black\". The SVG 1.1 validator basically says that it is correct now (except for the RDF metadata and inkscape elements, see |validator.nu. I also tried to save it as \"plain svg\" from Inkscape. Uploaded both to Commons. Neither did help.\n\nI ran rsvg-convert (version 2.52.5) on it and it gave a \"rendering error: InvalidMatrix\", whatever that means...\n\nDo you have any further suggestions? I'd really appreciate it.\n\n--DeWikiMan (talk)\n\nCreating \"optimized SVG\" from Inkscape did the trick. I don't know exactly why. I believe, the problem could be related to this librsvg problem [3]. Probably, one of the transform matrices was not invertible. In such a case, the librsvg version which is now used on Commons, possibly does no longer ignore the transform, but fails and stops rendering.\n\n--DeWikiMan (talk)\n\n@DeWikiMan: Looks like you found the answer 30 minutes later.

Hisyam Athaya (WMID) (talk)\n\nIt still needs to be fixed. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nAFAIK there are several tickets on Phabricator on the topic, so it is a known bug.

Clicking 'Original file' gives a 'XML Parsing Error: prefix not bound to a namespace' error, while clicking any of the resolution PNG previews gives a 429 error. This error doesn't seem to be something on my end as I asked someone else on a different computer from a different internet connection to take a look and they confirmed that it's broken for them as well. Apologies if this is a known issue that's being worked on or something a-la graphs extension - I don't frequent Commons. Waxworker (talk)\n\n@Waxworker: File:LGBTCannabis_white.svg is not a valid XML file. The Commons SVG renderer librsvg was recently upgraded from 2.44 to 2.50, which uses a stricter XML parser, resulting in this error.

Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nFor Category:Images by text that could be helpful too. Ideally one could choose\n\na word, group of words, or category tree\n\ndefine a maximum number of words or characters that should be on an image (sample: less than 5 words). This to avoid doing OCR on lengthy texts.\n\nThen confirm suggestions made by OCR. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI do not know about gadgets.\n\nThere is an OCR tool.\n\nhttps://ocr.wmcloud.org/api.php\n\nSee https://ocr.wmcloud.org/ for direct interface and API documentation.\n\nIt will work with PNG files but not SVG files (which can be converted to PNG and then OCR'd).\n\nOne can get the URL for a PNG rendering of an SVG file. Here's a conversion that is 887 pixels wide\n\n{{filepath:Tulejki zaciskowe.svg|887}} →\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Tulejki_zaciskowe.svg/887px-Tulejki_zaciskowe.svg.png\n\nHere's a Polish OCR run on that PNG:\n\n[https://tools.wmflabs.org/ws-google-ocr/api.php?image={{filepath:Tulejki zaciskowe.svg|887}}&lang=pl Tulejki zaciskowe.svg] →\n\nTulejki zaciskowe.svg →\n\nhttps://ocr.wmcloud.org/api.php?engine=google&image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Tulejki_zaciskowe.svg/887px-Tulejki_zaciskowe.svg.png&lang=pl →\n\n{\"engine\":\"google\",\"langs\":[\"pl\"],\"psm\":3,\"crop\":[],\"image_hosts\":[\"upload.wikimedia.org\",\"upload.wikimedia.beta.wmflabs.org\"],\"text\":\"Typ \\u015bci\\u0105gaj\\u0105cy\\nTyp naciskaj\\u0105cy\\nTyp obustronny\"}\n\nSo the Polish text is (converting Unicode code points to Unicode)\n\nTyp ściągający\n\nTyp naciskający\n\nTyp obustronny\n\nBut why OCR an SVG file? The PetScan query shows SVG files that have text elements.\n\nWith JavaScript, read the SVG file with the Fetch API, grab the text elements with getElementsByTagNS(nsSVG, \"text\"), ask for the .textContent of each text element, and then search that string for the years or terms you want.\n\nI do not know about the rest of the task.\n\nGlrx (talk)\n\nWow great so around 70% of this already exists! Thanks a lot for this info. Now it basically only needs a way to make it scan files in petscan results.\n\nSVG files always have a PNG file linked beneath them so they don't need to be converted again.\n\nHowever, SVG files already have the text as plain text in them so rather than OCRing them it would be better if they the text contained in them was read somehow. However, that (which you also described in your bottom paragraph) is not needed here:\n\nI tested it like so with a PNG render underneath File:Death-rate-smoking,1996.svg and it worked very well.\n\nIf there was a tool where one can e.g. enter a petscan ID and it makes these requests the other thing needed would be\n\nthe small code that checks for the latest plausible year-number (and either in the first few lines / title or not in the same line as Data source)\n\na bot that adds the categories to the files accordingly.\n\nIs there a developer here who is interested in building these three missing parts assuming they don't also exist already? Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nhttps://ocr.wmcloud.org/ interesting tool. Quite surprising what OCR on photos actually gives.

Possibly, as structured data so it's editable. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nAbout SVG: ideally the text would be rendered on the file description page separately. Maybe that's something that can be added through LUA directly on Template:Information Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI added a request for that at Template_talk:Information#Output_SVG_text. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nPrototyperspective, you stated \"I'd like to categorize Our World in Data maps by the year of the data into Category:Maps of the world by year\".

However, I'd like to prevent you from going overboard once you finished with the OWiD maps: Please do not categorize old maps by year, including old maps of the world. Reprints, republications, entry errors and the natural delay between surveying and publishing the final maps, means that almost all older maps (before ~1990s) should preferably get organized/categorized by decade as the finest granularity.

I am not exactly sure where this error lives (I can see that it is on the pages now, inside the PD|self template). I see it as very irritating and kind of disrespectful towards the creators to missspell their names this way adding a random \"I\" to their name. Does anyone have a good approach to fix thse instances and check the template? Thanks, I saw this in the Dutch translation template.

Not sure what it actually is though. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nHello! I wanted to created some map. I got free baselayer in PNG, opened Inkscape and made import of PNG file in software. After that I've added several lines and symbols and saved the result in SVG. If I try to upload the result to Commons, I see \"The XML in the uploaded file could not be parsed\". One hypothesis is that problem is in embedded PNG-layer, but, as I remember, there are SVG-files in Commons, which contain raster layers. Size of file is 12 Mb. Microsoft Edge opens file normally. What does cause the uploading error? It is possible to download the file for its checking. Perhaps, there is some web service, which cand repair structure of document, if it is broken? But, indeed, I'm not sure, that there file is broken: it is simple (raster layer, a few lines and symbols) and is not huge. Dinamik (talk)\n\nWe do not allow uploads of svgs with images inside of them. Its is often misused and it creates potential security problems because our filescanners do not work on those embedded images. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nDid such limitation exist in Commons always? I believe, that, for example, first versions of this file have embedded baselayer. Dinamik (talk)\n\nProbably not, see Category:Fake SVG. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nCommons has always allowed files to have embedded bitmaps, but those bitmaps must use the data: scheme. Files with external URLs are now blocked from uploading. Furthermore, the Commons rasterizer will not fetch external URLs, so such a base layer would no longer display. All the versions of the St. Petersburg map display, so there would not be an external URL. Glrx (talk)\n\nThe file is over 10 MB. At one point, SVG uploads were limited to 10 MB, but I do not believe the is still the case.\n\nThe file is mostly an embedded PNG. Following that, there are some path and flowRoot elements. The path elements should be OK, but the flowRoot is not supported. It was described in an SVG 1.2 draft, but that draft was not accepted. The element does not exist in the SVG 2.0 spec.\n\nWMF supports SVG 1.1. Even if you could upload the file, it would not display as you would expect.\n\nI do not see a reason for the XML error. W3's validator finds 67 errors, but they only involve normal Inkscape, sodipodi, and RDF extensions or the bogus flowRoot elements.\n\nGlrx (talk)\n\nRunning rsvg-convert (latest version, 2.58) on that SVG gives an error without the --unlimited option, which is described as \"The XML parser has some guards designed to mitigate large CPU or memory consumption in the face of malicious documents. It may also refuse to resolve data: URIs used to embed image data in SVG documents.\" Dexxor (talk)\n\nAny idea how to filter search results for photos that are not of persons? Is it currently possible or what would need to be added to make it possible? Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nYes: append -deepcategory:\"People\" or a similar category more specific to your search like \"People climbing\" (concrete example). It doesn't work with the two examples and with any other categories that don't just have a few subcats. The way to change that is phab code issue: phab:T369808 Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nThanks, but that assumes that the images already have a people category. Also, I doubt deepcat will ever be changed to include all subcategories of Category:People.\n\nMaybe I should have explained my question differently: The idea is to find non-people images without having to categorize all people first.\n\nSample search: Special:Search/incategory:\"Independence_Day_2019_in_Brasília\".\n\nThis includes plenty of images of people, but a few other photos, such as buildings.\n\nThis is similar for other files from that Flickrstream. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nYes, it doesn't work another way and they should be in that cat. Are you asking about machine vision filters? That would be more than difficult to add. It is not about that particular cat but how well that search operator works and it doesn't scan the whole cat tree anew, it uses some cached data or could do so if it currently does scan things anew for every search request. This is what the categories are for and the user should not be required to do categorization first, that's another issue. I don't know what the point of your question is, how do you think this could be possible if not as described or similar (such as excluding terms commonly in the file descriptions of images of people)? Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nThe point is to find images of buildings and cityscape included in these searches/Flickrstreams (and skip all politicians, I'm not interested in).\n\nThere was some AI done on images that added suggestions to every image. One could just skip all those images where the suggestion is people/faces or similar. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nBasically it is that images with suggestions for containing people (I thought people not faces), need to be located in the People category. For example with a subcategory \"Images likely depicting people to check\". Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nBTW, your phab ticket seems to be repurposed to add the missing error message on MediaSearch, not to make deepcategory:\"People\" possible. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nNo, that's a misunderstanding then: it's not about showing the error message also in MediaSearch but getting it deepcat to work reliably always (except for newly-created categories). Also to add to my prior point a subcat like \"People by activity\" may be more appropriate and the \"Images likely depicting people to check\" doesn't need to be in the People cat, one could just add a second deepcat search operator phrase. Other than that I don't think there's a feasible way given that not even any other image search engines have such features and WMC is unlikely to be able to be the first to offer machine vision supported image search. Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nMy oldish phone can do some of it, so Commons should be able to offer it as well. Search engines for the general public tend to have some other constraints: like always provide the same results and not output anything problematic.\n\nCommons was almost there a while back .. so it shouldn't be too complicated to make it work.\n\nBTW let's be optimistic about your ticket, but in any case, I don't think it wouldn't solve my usecase. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nOk good point, still that is not a public Web or Website search engine. I don't think it would be very useful but maybe I'm wrong or it would be simple to add. I guess you could check if there is a readily available open source package for this that could be used and check if there is a related phab ticket and if not propose it somewhere. Also keep in mind that WMC has far more files than your phone (however maybe that only means the initial scan takes a bit longer). I think generally it suffices to just change the search terms so either some things are excluded or it's more specific to what you're searching for such as searching \"animals climbing\" instead of just \"climbing\" or going to the subcategories about e.g. \"buildings\". Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nWhy wouldn't it be useful to be able to search images by what is actually visible?\n\nYour other suggestions implies that the file description text includes that information or was already categorized, but File:Comemoração da Independência do Brasil (48700486098).jpg is somewhat representative in that not being the case. The entire point of the search is to find images and add more detailed categories. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nI didn't say that, I wrote \"very useful\" that means that it's about the magnitude/degree.\n\nThe other things were just alternatives that don't necessarily always work or work for all files depending on what you intend to do which you didn't specify and can vary.\n\nAdding/integrating machine vision would be useful; see this. Prototyperspective (talk)\n\nHello, per Template talk:GPLv3, GPLv3 will soon be redirected to GPLv3 only. It currently has no transclusions and has been deprecated for two weeks. Considering the potential legal implications, I want to proceed with caution. Are there any tools that still have the GPLv3 template hardcoded inside? —Matrix(!) {user - talk? - uselesscontributions}\n\nConsider the following pages:\n\n(Deleted and redirected after file format conversion) (Orphaned talk page) File:Blue dot 7px.png (Live page) File talk:Blue dot 7px.png (Non-existent until just now)\n\nI suspect many more orphaned talk pages exist like this one. Until just now, there was no way for an editor looking at File:Blue dot 7px.png to see that there were relevant discussions at File talk:Blue dot 7px.gif. I fixed the problem by moving File talk:Blue dot 7px.gif to File talk:Blue dot 7px.png. I propose that all such pages leftover from file format conversions similarly be moved to match the name of the page in the new format. This seems like a bot task, something like this:\n\nFor all pages in the File talk namespace:\n\nSkip if the page is a redirect\n\nSkip if {{SUBJECTPAGENAME}} is not a redirect.\n\nSkip if the {{PAGENAME}} don't end in \".gif\"\n\nSkip if {{SUBJECTPAGENAME}} doesn't redirect to SUBJECTPAGENAME.sub(/.gif$/, \".png\")\n\nLog and skip if a page already exists named PAGENAME.sub(/.gif$/, \".png\")\n\nMove to PAGENAME.sub(/.gif$/, \".png\")\n\nAn analogous procedure could be followed for other file format conversions.\n\nQuestions:\n\nIs there consensus for these moves? Should a talk page persist through file format conversions and associated renaming? To me, the answer is clearly yes, as I regard these as essentially versions of the same file even if the two files co-existed on Commons at one point. Any discussion on the old file format is highly likely to be relevant to the converted file.\n\nWould someone volunteer write a script to perform this task?\n\nDaask (talk)\n\nHi, We should not have redirects from one file extension to another. This is a source for problems. Yann (talk)\n\n@Yann: isn't there \"not\" missing in your sentence? Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nYes, thanks. Yann (talk)\n\n@Yann: I'm confused by your comments. If you are suggesting that the redirect page at File:Blue dot 7px.gif should be deleted, then that doesn't seem to address my concern or solve any problems. Further, it would make it much more difficult to fix the problem I was concerned with, as it would make my proposed script no longer work. Daask (talk)\n\nI don't think the redirect at File:Blue dot 7px.gif is good practice either. Maybe it had been when it was created. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nMediaWiki message delivery\n\nSeems like this gallery uses some way of showing translated versions of the headers depending on which ?uselang= is set: Deutschland\n\nThe headers display fine in the gallery itself but are bugged in the TOC. Why is that / how can this be fixed – is there some issue about this? (I don't think galleries are very useful, e.g. even large ones are barely viewed or well-populated, but as long as they are used and displayed in search results, they should work properly.)\n\nPrototyperspective (talk)\n\nI changed Template:Bad AI/i18n to use an .svg icon instead of a .png one yesterday, but the edit hasn't propagated to Template:Bad AI (where it's embedded), nor to any of the localised versions such as Template:Bad AI/i18n/en (which I cannot edit directly). What have I done wrong here? Belbury (talk)\n\nNo, you did nothing wrong. The edit has to be now accepted by COM:translation administrators before it gets propagated. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nThanks, I'll wait for that, then. From the This page contains changes which are not marked for translation message I assumed nothing was pending. Belbury (talk)\n\nHello, I didn't know which noticeboard this would be more suited to, but you might want to change out COM:VPP#More appropriate MediaWiki translation structure for protectedpagetext templates. —Matrix(!) {user - talk? - uselesscontributions}\n\nIs there way to determine how many edits had been done on file description pages in Category:TIFF images with categorized JPGs and its two subcategories? Ideally\n\nhow many edits were not done by the uploader\n\nand how many different users were involved?\n\nhow this spreads of years, possibly 3-month-periods\n\nIdeally curation on this duplicates wouldn't be needed, but I don't think this is what happened. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nis it possible to have a list view of categories? without thumbnails, filenames arranged in a compact list.\n\ni know one way to do it is by adding NOGALLERY, but let's say i want to view Category:All media needing categories as of 2024, so i dont want to edit the page which will change the view for all users. RZuo (talk)\n\nPetScan? Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nThe past few days I have tried to clean up Special:UncategorizedPages. For the real gallery pages that is not a problem. But the vast majority of the pages in this list have the format \"File:\" (at the moment about 95%). That seems not OK to me. There are three types of files here:\n\nEmbedded files (term made up by me): Files that do not contain any image or other medium, but only text, a table or a program; there is a link in another file (main file) to the embedded file. Sometimes the creator could move the text to the main file and ask for deletion of the embedded file. Question Can this be solved, can the content of the embedded files be moved to the main files or does another solution exist? Examples:\n\nCommons:Deletion requests/Files found with File:Wikipedia on GLAM-Tour Kulturkooperationen für lokale Wikipedia-Gruppen.webm; see also: Commons:Translators'_noticeboard#A_handful_of_File:_namespace_timed_text_translations_still_exist + Commons:Village_pump/Archive/2016/09#What_are_these_files? (so this is an eight year old problem) + Meta:Community Wishlist/Wishes/A tool for auto-transcription to speed up the creation of TimedTexts subtitles for videos on Commons (which can perhaps be a solution?)\n\nFile:Alignment chart.png/author + File:Alignment chart.png/source; both used in File:Alignment chart.png\n\nFile:GFDL (English).ogg/Warning 1\n\nFile:LGBT rights world map.svg/description; used in File:World laws pertaining to homosexual relationships and expression (duplicate).svg\n\nThe vast majority of the \"Files\" on this list contain a request for deletion or a note that probably copyright violation is the case. They obviously do not belong here. Question How do these files end up here? How can they be removed from this list?\n\nThe rest of the files look correct: they have an image or other medium, categories and are not nominated for deletion. But I cannot find them in the categories mentioned in the files. So I think something is wrong with this files, but I do not know what. Question Why are these files on this list? How can they be removed from it? Examples:\n\nFile:\"Principes_de_composition_de_Mr_Bernier,_ancien_Maitre_de_Musique_de_la_S.te_Chapelle,_à_Paris\"_-_btv1b10868810x_(45_of_57).jpg\n\nFile:2024-06-13_Archiv_des_Deutschen_Museums_30.jpg\n\nFile:2024 Save the Core - Talco - by 2eight - 9SC1171.jpg\n\nFile:Lettre_de_Jean_Baptiste_Victor_Mohr_à_Monsieur_Achille_Gouffé,_10_Février_1857_(manuscrit_autographe)_-_btv1b108806264_(3_of_3).jpg\n\nFile:Parque_Estadual_da_Pedra_Branca_X_Diego_Monsores_(02).jpg\n\nFile:Parque_Estadual_da_Pedra_Branca_X_Diego_Monsores_(03).jpg\n\nFile:Séismes._Iles_Lipari_(dossier_239)_-_btv1b10875214q_(065_of_233).jpg\n\nFile:Uni8F29_NotoSansSC-Light.svg\n\nFile:Finnish_Transport_Safety_Agency.png\n\nFiles starting with File:GCE Kannur\n\nFile:High_School_-_geograph.org.uk_-_6526491.jpg\n\nFile:Willoughby_St_Jul_2024_68.jpg\n\nFile:Xenia - Hub District (BAP) - 8516245531.jpg\n\nJopkeB (talk)\n\nIn your list, #1 seem to be fake subpages. Subpages because they use the \"/\" format, fake because file namespace doesn't allow for subpages.\n\nCould be that pages with #3 need a null edit for the categories to be added completely. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nThanks @Enhancing999: for your remarks.\n\n@1 I understand. But they cannot be just deleted because the filenames have a wrong format. One way or another they should be replaced by something else. I hope someone has a solution.\n\n@2 I hope someone else can shed some light on that.\n\n@3 I carried out a null edit in some files and after that at least they were in the categories. I'll wait a few days and then will check wether these files are not in the refreshed list anymore. If that is so, I'll give the rest the same threatment. But it is strange that they need such a threatment at all; can we not just prevent it?\n\nJopkeB (talk)\n\nFor #3 a bot could do that on a regular basis. Do pages appear there if they are only in hidden category? #2 may be the same. Isn't there a separate process for uncategorized images? Maybe this special page isn't needed for that.\n\nAbout #1: if there is no associated file, the content should be moved to the appropriate place. This can be the actual file description page, template namespace or timedtext namespace. Once moved, this should be deleted. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nIsn't there a separate process for uncategorized images? Yes, Special:UncategorizedImages exists. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nAnd there are Category:Uncategorized files, Category:Files needing categories and their subcategories, files are also put there in automated processes. And what is the difference with Special:UncategorizedImages? JopkeB (talk)\n\nThe main difference is that the special page is populated by the wiki software itself. Or what you meant to ask? I don’t think I quite understood. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nYes, thanks, this is the answer to my question. JopkeB (talk)\n\nA bot is fine. But shouldn't it be investigated why these files appear in the list? Then it may be possible to solve the problem and then we do not need a bot. There are many, many more files with hidden categories and files that are nominated for deletion which do not appear in the list. JopkeB (talk)\n\nI tried the null edit on the (non-deleted) pages. Let's see if it works. Also I fixed #1.2. above. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nAlso, I made a deletion request for #1.3 Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nAlso, a rename request for #1.4 (move to template namespace). Enhancing999 (talk)\n\n@Enhancing999: I've tried to rename File:LGBT rights world map.svg/description, but I get an error: \"Cannot move file to non-file namespace.\" I'm only a filemover, though; maybe an admin can do better. If not you may need to copy it (with proper attribution) and then get the current page deleted. --bjh21 (talk)\n\nI did some testing at testwiki: it's not possible to move directly, even for admins. A workaround seems to be Special:Import. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nDidn't work, but it's moved now. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nFor a better overview, I propose an update to the introductions of the special pages, see MediaWiki talk:Uncategorizedpages-summary and MediaWiki talk:Uncategorizedimages-summary. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nUntil #1.1 is solved, I made Category:Timed Text in file namespace to get them categorized (someone needs to mark them for translation for the category to appear in all other subpages). Enhancing999 (talk)\n\n(@2) It's a old MediaWiki file cache error/bug. It occurs sometimes when using mass deletion tools like AjaxQuickDelete, Bad Old Ones, Twinkle, etc. One or two files' deletions remain incomplete, deleting admin sees the red link, so unless they refresh the page or check the deletion log, they are unaware. The files have categories but not appear in them, and eventually show up as uncategorized, they may also end up with corrupt thumbnails. Basically it's a state of partial deletion, lol. Purging doesn't help, but the issue can be easily fixed by just manually deleting the files. One can also add the deletion template again to make them appear in the deletion category for admin attention. For the current report, I have deleted all except those I was unsure about. -- CptViraj (talk)\n\nThanks @CptViraj: for the explanation and deleting many files. I have still some questions:\n\nSince I have no rights to delete files manually, next time it is best that I add the deletion template again?\n\nWhat about the files with a Template:No permission since, like File:Logo-thanh-pho-Sa-Dec.webp? Can they get off the list too? Would the solution also be adding the template again?\n\nSolving the bug(s) is not an option?\n\nJopkeB (talk)\n\nNo need to add a new deletion template. A null edit is enough to get the file categorized again. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\nNull edits will only be useful when the file has a speedy deletion template (SD, copyvio, G10, F10, etc.) used, so it will be categorized in a speedy deletion category. But when the file has a DR template, it doesn't help as the DR request is already closed, there is no category for them, it will still go unnoticed. Same for any F5 (no license/source/permission) file, the respective maintenance category is already deleted, so it will too go unnoticed. Therefore in these two cases, it's better to just add {{SD}} mentioning the error to have admin attention. -- CptViraj (talk)\n\nWould you have a sample file? Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nJust a nitpick: old {{Npd}} cases are perfectly visible as they appear directly in Category:Media missing permission. --Geohakkeri (talk)\n\n@JopkeB:\n\n(1) Yes, but no need to add the same deletion template, just use a simple speedy template ({{SD}}) mentioning the error and original deletion reason, also see my above message regarding null edits.\n\n(2) The same applies here; just use the SD template as I said above. I think you are asking this because you noticed that all (or most) of the files left by me are these F5 ones, but it is not related, I have deleted many of these files, too.\n\n(3) Solving a bug is always a option. This isn't a Commons-only issue. Devs might already be aware of the bug; maybe there is already a Phabricator task, maybe there isn't. I don't know as I never tried digging into this as there always have been some sort of cache issues with deleting in MediaWiki, maybe I'm just lazy to deal with it as this isn't a major issue and is easily workable 😅, and these files are deleted most of the time on every maintenance report by some admin, this time it just got pilled up for a month or two. -- CptViraj (talk)\n\nThanks, all of you, for the help. The list has been refreshed and there are now only 16 pages left. For the files about Wikipedia on GLAM-Tour Kulturkooperationen is a process going on to delete them (see Commons:Deletion requests/Files found with File:Wikipedia on GLAM-Tour Kulturkooperationen für lokale Wikipedia-Gruppen.webm). The rest looks business as usual. JopkeB (talk)\n\nImpressive from 181 to 16! The translation subpages would also disappear if someone marked the main one for translation (I made request at Commons:Translators'_noticeboard#A_handful_of_File:_namespace_timed_text_translations_still_exist).\n\nUser talk:Test919,733,084 leaves me puzzled. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nDid an edit on that .. maybe it works. Also an edit request for Motd. Enhancing999 (talk)\n\nIt got updated, but there are still 12. \"User_talk:Test919,733,084\" is still there. I tried moving it around: [10].

I've dealt with several hundred of those, and would really like to have a more updated report to work from. As far as I can tell, there is no reasonable way to find uncategorized categories other than this report, and except for the rare false positive, every single uncategorized category genuinely represents a task to be done. - Jmabel ! talk\n\nMediaWiki message delivery\n\nHey there!
