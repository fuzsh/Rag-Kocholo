        "text": "Save as PDF\n\nTranslatable\n\nReturn to menu\n\nSee Managing Citations for more configuration options for Leganto (Adding Citation Tags, Additional Resource Information, Disable Resolving, Public Note, Managing a Citation's Digital Representations).\n\nAlso see Enabling Instructor Rollover and Configuring Citation and Section Tags.\n\nEnabling or Disabling Individual Guided Videos (Classic UI Only)\n\nYou can enable or disable individual guided videos in the Getting Started Videos section, using the Guided Videos table, found in Leganto Configuration > Features > Guided Videos. In this table you can enable/disable the display of a video link in the guided videos section, change the name of the link, change the URL of the link, and change the order of the link in the displayed list.\n\nConfiguring Translations of Guided Videos (Classic UI Only)\n\nYou can configure translations of the label of any new video you add to the Guided Videos section, using the Customer Labels table (found in Leganto Configuration > General > Customer Labels).\n\nWhen a value in the Code column of the Customer Labels table matches a value in the Guided Video column of the Guided Videos table, and you select a language in Leganto, the corresponding copyright option in the Guided Videos area of Leganto appears with the value in the matching Translation column of the Customer Labels table for that language.\n\nFor instance, if you add a video called Creating_a_list_video in the Guided Videos table, and you want to translate the video name into French, then in the Customer Labels table, you can select French from the Filter dropdown, and add a row to the Customer Labels table whose Code value matches the Creating_a_list_video value from the Guided videos table. In the Translation field, you can then enter the translated name of the video.\n\nWhen French is selected as the language in Leganto, the guided video appears with the translation you entered into the Translation field of the Customer Labels table.\n\nEnabling or Disabling Individual Guided Tours (Classic UI Only)\n\nYou can enable or disable individual guided tours in the Guided Tours section, using the Guided Tours table, found in Leganto Configuration > Features > Guided Tours.\n\nEnabling or Disabling the Welcome Screen (Classic UI Only)\n\nLeganto offers a series of welcome screens for students, displayed once a day upon student login until the student dismisses the screens. The welcome screens give the student a quick overview of how to use Leganto to view and access the learning materials.\n\nAfter the welcome screen is dismissed, the welcome screens can still be accessed from the Leganto Settings > Help.\n\nTo enable or disable the Welcome (help) screen from appearing when a student first logs in to Leganto:\n\nSet welcome_screen_help to true or false in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nHiding/Showing Onboarding Wizard Screens (Classic UI Only)\n\nLeganto offers a series of onboarding screens for instructors, displayed when Instructors log in for the first time. The onboarding screens include GIFs that portray the general concepts underlying Leganto and how it can be used, then point instructors to where they can go for more information when they need it. There is minimal text per screen, which can be customized. The screens explain the following:\n\nLeganto is a tool that can be used to gather resources from different sources and organize them\n\nResources can be added from the entire library collection\n\nResources can be added from the web, using CiteIt!\n\nSocial Reading\n\nWhere to go when you need help\n\nInstalling CiteIt!\n\nThe onboarding screen is enabled by default (parameter: welcome_screen_instructors in Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nThe welcome screen is disabled for instructors who have already seen and used Leganto before.\n\nYou can configure which Onboarding wizard screens to show/hide to instructors, by setting the Display option in the Configuration > Leganto > UI > Onboarding to Yes/No. The default Display setting for each screen is Yes.\n\nYou also have the option to add a Custom GIF URL to present your own GIF for each screen. By default, the out-of-the-box gif appears.\n\nConfiguring the General Message for Lists and Citations\n\nYou can configure the general message that displays above all lists and citations. The message may include HTML markup to enable you to add formatting to the message. In addition, you may customize the message's title, which is set to Important message out of the box.\n\nWhen both the general message and the tip of the day are enabled, the tip of the day will not appear until the user selects the Stop showing this message checkbox under the general message and opens a new session.\n\nSelecting the Stop showing this message checkbox hides the general message until the message is changed.\n\nSelecting the X icon message hides the general message until the user's next session.\n\nTo enable the general message:\n\nOpen the Customer Labels code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Customer Labels).\n\nSelect Add Row and specify the following information in the dialog box:\n\nCode – Specify a unique code for your general message. You will need this code later when you enable the general message in Leganto.\n\nDescription – Specify the message's text (which may include HTML markup).\n\nSave your changes to the table.\n\nOpen the Leganto Features mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nEdit the general_message parameter and set the Parameter Value field to the code that you assigned to your general message.\n\nLeaving the Parameter Value field empty disables the general message. The general_message_role parameter enables you to specify that the value in the general_message parameter only appears for the user role indicated. Possible values are instructor, student, librarian, guest, or leave empty for the general message to appear for all users. Multiple roles can be entered, separated by commas. All of these parameters are found in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nUse the general_message_dates parameter to specify a date range when the value in the general_message parameter displays.\n\nSave your changes to the table.\n\nIf you want to customize your general message's title, open the UI Leganto Labels code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Labels).\n\nEdit the row containing the lists.general.message code and set the Description field to the new title.\n\nSave your changes to the table.\n\nDisplaying Leganto in a New Tab\n\nWhen Leganto is embedded in an iFrame, it may be helpful to open Leganto in a new tab so that users can enlarge it for better viewing. By default, the Open New Tab icon appears in Leganto when Leganto is embedded in an iFrame. Selecting the icon opens Leganto in a new tab so that users can work in Leganto independently.\n\nTo disable the Open New Tab icon, set the display_open_new_tab parameter to false in the Leganto Features mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nWhen accessing Leganto from an LMS, if browser settings are set to block third-party cookies, the OPEN NEW TAB button is now only displayed until it is selected. After selecting the button, the page must be refreshed for the button to be available again.\n\nThe display_logout_in_embedded parameter key (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Leganto Features) determines whether to show (true) or hide (false) the Logout menu item. The default is true.\n\nConfiguring Leganto Branding/Customization\n\nClassic UI\n\nYou can configure various Leganto branding or customization options on the Branding Management page (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Branding) or the Leganto Customization mapping table. For more information about mapping tables, see Mapping Tables.\n\nTo configure Leganto branding:\n\nOn the Branding Management page:\n\nClassic UI — In the Load Leganto header logo field, browse for a logo to show in Leganto. The maximum height for the logo is 33px. There is no maximum width.\n\nClassic UI — In the Leganto Header Color field, optionally enter a six-digit hexadecimal color for the Leganto header. This configures the separator bar between the Leganto header and the main Leganto panes.\n\nClassic UI — In the Leganto Left Panel Color field, optionally enter a six-digit hexadecimal color for the reading list left panel color.\n\nClassic UI — In the Leganto Top Panel field, optionally enter a six-digit hexadecimal color for the reading list top panel color.\n\nIn the Page Title Prefix field, optionally enter a prefix title for the Leganto browser tab that you would like to appear, instead of the default prefix Resource List.\n\nYou may optionally use Load Leganto Favicon to upload a favicon for your site.\n\nWhen you are done, select Save to upload the logo and/or save your changes.\n\nTo configure Leganto customization:\n\nAny settings you save in the Customization mapping table will override the settings saved in the Branding Management page.\n\nClassic UI — On the Leganto Customization mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Customization):\n\nSet enabled to true to enable the following two customization options.\n\nSet leganto_color to a six digit hex value (preceded by \"#\") to set the primary color of Leganto's main panes. For example, #cccccc.\n\nSet leganto_left_sidebar_color to a six digit hex value (preceded by \"#\") to set the primary color of Leganto's left pane.\n\nSet leganto_link_color to a six digit hex value (preceded by \"#\") to set the color of links in Leganto.\n\nAlso see Configuring Headings and Text in Leganto.\n\nWhen you are done, select Customize.\n\nNew UI\n\nYou can configure the color scheme for Leganto's new UI (Configuration > Leganto > UI > Branding) from the Branding Management Color Theme section. When you choose the primary color, the secondary color is auto-selected. The two colors are designed to match each other and to meet accessibility standards. You can view a preview of the color scheme before selecting Save.\n\nConfiguring the Default CSS for Holdings from Primo\n\nThe holdings_default_leganto_css field in the Leganto Customer Settings mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Settings) enables you to use the same CSS that you are using to display holdings for Primo's Get It. To use Primo's CSS, set this field to false. Otherwise, the system uses Leganto's CSS.\n\nThis feature does not apply to Primo VE.\n\nConfiguring the Holdings from Primo\n\nLeganto supports the Primo new mashup UI. The following parameters are included in the Primo Settings table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings):\n\nholdings_new_ui enables the new Primo out-of-the-box mashup UI.\n\nholdings_skin enables your own skins for the mashup that you have customized yourself.\n\nConfiguring Language Settings\n\nTo set the default language, in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings), set the parameter default_language to one of the following country codes:\n\nen - English\n\nde - German\n\nko - Korean\n\nit - Italian\n\nfr - French\n\nzh - Chinese\n\nnl - Dutch; Flemish\n\nes - Spanish\n\nTo configure whether small flag icons appear next to the language options in Leganto, in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings), set the parameter language_flags to true (display flag icons) or false.\n\nConfiguring Leganto Institution Language Capitalization\n\nThe disable_capitalization_languages flag can be set to correct incorrect capitalization as it appears on Leganto UI labels (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features). You can set which language to affect by inserting its language code (such as en for English) and can insert multiple language codes by using the comma-separated format (en, he, fr). Leaving this flag blank (default setting) retains capitalization unchanged.\n\nConfiguring Headings and Text in Leganto (Classic UI Only)\n\nTo configure the fonts for reading list names and general text:\n\nSet enabled to true and configure leganto_font in the Leganto Customization mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Customization).\n\nWhen left empty, the fonts are Volkorn (header) and Source Sans Pro (content).\n\nWhen set to a, the fonts are Rokkitt (header) and Barlow (content).\n\nWhen set to b, the fonts are Zilla Slab (header) and Nunito (content).\n\nWhen set to c, the fonts are Josefin Slab (header) and Open Sans (content).\n\nTo configure the default header and message that appears on the Find List page:\n\nConfigure the parameters guest_search_page_header and guest_search_page_message in the Declaration Texts code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Declaration Texts). Enter the texts you would like as the default.\n\nguest_search_page_header can contain HTML.\n\nTo configure the default headers when an instructor fills out a copyright clearance and/or digitization request:\n\nConfigure the parameters copyright_clearance_header and digitization_request_header in the Declaration Texts code table. Enter the texts you would like as the default.\n\nTo configure all other labels:\n\nYou can configure any text in Leganto in the UI Leganto Labels code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Labels). For more information about code tables, see Code Tables.\n\nThe label welcome.title.description (which refers to the header on the Quick Start Welcome screen that appears when an instructor enters Leganto from the CMS using a course link to a course that exists but does not contain any reading lists) can contain HTML. All other labels can contain only text.\n\nIf you cannot locate the label that you want to change, contact Ex Libris customer support for assistance.\n\nEnabling SSO When Accessing Find Lists Shareable Link\n\nYou can configure whether a logged-in user remains logged in when accessing Leganto using any shareable link or is redirected to the login page. For this feature to work, your IDP (SAML) must support passive mode.\n\nTo enable logged in users to remain logged in when accessing Leganto using any shareable link:\n\nIn the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings), set the parameter find_list_sso to true. Your IDP (SAML) must support passive mode. The default is false.\n\nConfiguring Course Behavior\n\nYou can configure how courses appear in Leganto. You can also configure whether instructors can create or modify courses, and whether lists can be associated to multiple courses.\n\nConfiguring How Courses Appear in Leganto\n\nWhen course names are displayed instead of course codes, the course code continues to appear in a tooltip.\n\nTo configure whether course appear as their course name or course code in Leganto:\n\nSet the parameter course_display to name or code (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings).\n\nIf you set display_cms_id to true, and you are using searchable IDs (CMS course IDs), you can additionally configure whether Leganto displays the Alma course code or the searchable ID. This configuration applies only when a user arrives at Leganto from the CMS using the searchable ID.\n\nTo configure whether to display course code or searchable ID (when relevant):\n\nSet the parameter display_cms_id to true (display searchable ID when arriving from the CMS; display the course code when logging in to Leganto directly or from Alma) or false (display course code in all cases) (Configuration Menu > Leganto > LTI > Settings).\n\nConfiguring Whether Instructors Can Create or Modify Courses\n\nWhen coming from an LMS, instructors are presented with a special course-directed login page. When enabled, instructors are offered the option to create the course if it does not already exist in Alma.\n\nTo configure whether instructors can create undefined courses on the course-directed welcome page:\n\nSet the parameter cms_entry_actions to all or include the value course (Configuration Menu > Leganto > LTI > Settings). This parameter accepts multiple values, separated by commas. The option to create an undefined course appears on the course-directed welcome page. If set to any other value or left empty, the option to create a course does not appear on this page.\n\nWhen the parameter value for the parameter cms_entry_actions is enabled (disabled by default) and is set to all, list, or link and rollover, the Link course to this list button is included as an option for reusing lists. When a combination of one or more parameter values (course, file, rollover, list) excludes the value link, the Link course to this list button is not presented as an option for reusing lists.\n\nConfigure the default processing department: Enter the department code in the parameter default_processing_department (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings) in the Customer Settings table. For information on processing departments, see Configuring Processing Departments. Instructors enter the start and end dates for the course and the number of participants and select the academic department.\n\nTo configure whether instructors can modify course information:\n\nSet the parameter modify_course_details to true or false (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features). When true, instructors are presented with fields to modify course information (dates and number of participants) when they are associating a list with a course. The default is false.\n\nCreating Courses Automatically from an LTI Link\n\nAfter selecting an LTI link for a course that has not been created yet in Leganto, you must first create the course before you can create a reading list. You must enable this functionality if you want the course created automatically when an LTI link is selected.\n\nTo create courses automatically from an LTI link:\n\nSet the create_course_automatically field to true in the Leganto Customer Settings mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > LTI > Settings). When set to true, the code and name fields automatically populate using the default processing department and default start and end date parameters.\n\nConfigure the default_processing_department field in the Leganto Customer Settings mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings).\n\nThe steps below are only relevant for LTI 1.1. For LTI 1.3, see Canvas and Moodle.\n\nEdit your LTI tool's integration profile for your CMS (Configuration Menu > Leganto > LTI > Integration Profiles). The new Course Name Field Name field appears in the Actions tab under the LTI Definitions section.\n\nSpecify the parameter that holds the course name in the LTI tool.\n\nSave your changes to the integration profile.\n\nCreating Courses Manually from an LTI Link (New UI Only)\n\nThe new UI supports manually creating courses from LTI. When the cms_entry_actions (Configuration > Leganto > LTI > Settings) parameter value is set to all or course, and the parameter create_course_automatically (Configuration > Leganto > LTI > Settings) is set to false, and the parameter default_processing_department (Configuration > Leganto > General > Settings) is set, instructors accessing an LTI link for a course that does not yet exist in Alma can create the course manually in the new UI. When logging in to your LMS, instructors are prompted to create a list from scratch or from an existing list, according to configuration. After making a selection, instructors are then prompted to fill in or confirm the course details. After the course information is entered, the course is created in Alma and the instructor moves to the next screen.\n\nManaging Multiple Courses for Reading Lists\n\nYou can enable reading lists to be associated with multiple courses. When enabled, instructors can associate reading lists to multiple courses in Leganto. In Alma, librarians can do the same.\n\nWhen enabled, all associated courses appear in a reading list's Course Code and Course Name fields, in any other place in Alma that lists the course(s) associated with the list. If the list is too long to display, the full list appears in a tooltip. The total number of participants for a reading list is the total for all courses associated with the list.\n\nSelecting Associate this list with a course on the Course's Reading List or Reading Lists Task List pages opens the Courses tab on the Edit Reading List page (see below).\n\nSelecting Remove associated course on these pages opens the Courses tab on the Edit Reading List page ONLY if there are multiple courses associated with the list (so that you can select which one to remove). If there is only one course associated with the list when you select this option, that course is simply disassociated with the reading list, as usual.\n\nEnabling Multiple Courses for Reading Lists\n\nWhen configured, you can associate multiple courses with a reading list.\n\nTo enable multiple courses for reading lists:\n\nSet the parameter multicourse_lists in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings) to enabled.\n\nAdding and Removing Courses from a Reading List\n\nTo add and remove courses from a reading list:\n\nYou manage the courses associated with reading lists in the Courses tab on the Edit Reading List page (see Managing Reading Lists).\n\nIn this tab:\n\nTo associate a course to the reading list, select Associate Course, select the course and select Associate Course.\n\nTo remove a course association, select Remove Association in the row actions list for the course.\n\nConfiguring Working with Reading Lists\n\nOther options on this page also affect how an instructor works with reading lists, but these options are specific to the reading list configuration workflow.\n\nEnabling Reading List Syllabuses\n\nYou can enable instructors to add a link and/or file to the top of the reading list. This link or file is intended to be a syllabus and appears to the student with the prefix Syllabus and the option to select the link or download the file.\n\nTo enable syllabuses for reading lists:\n\nSet the parameter syllabus in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true. When true, instructors see the option to add a syllabus. Note that, regardless of this setting, librarians always see this option.\n\nConfiguring Reading List Publication Options\n\nWhen a reading list is published, the course's students can a) view the reading list and its citations and also b) view the list's course materials (electronic resources and uploaded files). The library can configure additional publishing options for instructors. Access to a published reading list, section, or citation is available by browsing the Leganto user interface or by navigating to the relevant shareable link. When trying to access a reading list, section, or citation that is not publicly available, and the user is not already logged in, Leganto tries to log the user in.\n\nYou can use the customer parameters in Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Publishing to set the publishing options that appear in Leganto. An explanation of the parameters appears after the list.\n\nNo publishing options — Set the parameter auto_publish_default_mode to Yes and configure the parameter publish_default_mode.\n\nBasic publishing options — Set the parameter auto_publish_default_mode to No, set advanced_publish_options to No, and configure the parameters student_visibility_default_materials_option and public_visibility_default_materials_option.\n\nFull publishing options (Classic UI Only) — Set the parameter auto_publish_default_mode to No, set advanced_publish_options to Yes, and configure the parameter publish_default_mode.\n\nExplanation:\n\nWhen auto_publish_default_mode is No and advanced_publish_options is No, the instructor's options for publishing are:\n\nCourse students — Course students (only) can view the reading list and view the course materials.\n\nAll students at the institution — All students at the institution can view the reading list. Set student_visibility_default_materials_option to configure whether all students or only course students, can view the course materials.\n\nAnyone — Anyone with the course shareable link can view the reading list. Set public_visibility_default_materials_option to configure whether anyone, all students, or only course students can view the course materials. You can also configure how shareable links are created so that they conform to the login method you are using: CAS, SAML, LDAP, or local login (see below).\n\n(Classic UI Only) When auto_publish_default_mode is No and advanced_publishing_options is Yes, the same options are available to the instructors. However, when selecting either of the two less restrictive options (all students or everyone), the instructor can also select to whom to make the course materials available:\n\nIf the instructor selects list access for all students, the instructor can select whether to make the course materials available to all students or leave them available only to course students.\n\nIf the instructor selects list access for everyone, the instructor can select whether to make the course materials available to everyone, to all students, or just course students.\n\nYou can configure the default selected options using publish_default_mode. If you set auto_publish_default_mode to Yes, the instructor is not given any publishing options; the list is immediately published according to its default selection as configured in publish_default_mode.\n\nThe complete list of parameters and values is as follows:\n\nPublishing Parameters Parameter Value Note\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure whether the Library Review and Publish actions appear as buttons, in addition to menu items:\n\nSet the parameters publish_as_button and/or send_list_as_button (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Settings) to true.\n\nTo configure the structure of the shareable link created for a publicly accessible reading list:\n\nConfigure the parameter authentication_method (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings) to one of the following values:\n\nCAS - If a login is required, use CAS. See CAS-Based Single Sign-On/Sign-Off.\n\nSAML - If a login is required, use SAML. See SAML-Based Single Sign-On/Sign-Off.\n\nLDAP - If a login is required, use LDAP. See Supporting LDAP.\n\nLOCAL - If a login is required, the shareable ink opens the Leganto login screen.\n\nMultiple - If a login is required, you can choose from multiple authentication methods. See Enabling Multiple Authentication Profiles.\n\nTo configure a task notification in Alma when a list is published:\n\nSet the parameter create_task_for_published_list (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Settings) to true (default).\n\nBy default, Leganto updates a reading list and its citations' statuses from Being Prepared to Ready for Processing when a list is published.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To not change a list and its citations statuses from Being Prepared to Ready for Processing when a list is published:\n\nSet the parameter send_list_on_publish (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Settings) to false. This also prevents Leganto from updating the reading list's date for review.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To update the Current Request for Review date:\n\nWhen a reading list is published, and the parameter send_list_on_published (Configuration > Leganto > List Management > Settings) is set to true, the Current Request for Review date in Alma updates to the current date regardless of the reading list citation status.\n\n(Classic UI) The citation status only updates to Ready for Processing when the current status is set to Being Prepared. Reading lists that are already marked as Complete remain with a Complete status.\n\nEnabling Multiple Authentication Profiles\n\nYou can configure multiple authentication profiles for logging in to Leganto.\n\nTo enable multiple authentication profiles:\n\nVerify that you have multiple authentication profiles set up by entering the Integration Profiles table under Leganto Configuration > LTI > Integration Profiles and searching for the authentication profiles. These may be some variation of Local, SAML and/or CAS (e.g. \"saml\"and \"saml2\").\n\nIn the authentication_method parameter in the Settings table under Leganto Configuration > General > Settings, enter a value of multiple and select Save.\n\nOnce you have saved a value of multiple in the authentication_method parameter, the Multiple Login mapping table appears under Leganto Configuration > General. Enter the table and add a new row for each authentication profile that you wish to use. Ensure that the profile type and profile code matches that of the authentication profiles you wish to use, and that each profile code is unique.\n\nSelect Customize to save the authentication profiles into the Multiple Login table.\n\nNow, when you log into Leganto, the multiple authentication profiles appear, and you can select one of them to proceed with the login.\n\nYou can also customize the display name of each authentication profile. To do this:\n\nNavigate to the Leganto Configuration > General > Customer Labels table and add a row for each authentication profile. Ensure that the Code field contains multiple.login.[profile code], and that the Description field contains the name of the profile you want to appear in the login.\n\nSelect Customize to register the new labels. When you log in again, these labels appear:\n\nConfiguring the Default Creative Commons Value for a Reading List\n\nTo configure the default creative commons value for a reading list:\n\nSet the parameter reading_list_creative_commons_default_value (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Settings) to the creative commons code. If not set, no option is initially selected in the dropdown list. The following codes are available:\n\nCreative Commons Codes Country Code Description International WW_CC_BY CC BY (Attribution) WW_CC_BY_SA CC BY-SA (Attribution-Share Alike) WW_CC_BY_ND CC BY-ND (Attribution-No Derivatives) WW_CC_BY_NC CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial) WW_CC_BY_NC_SA CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike) WW_CC_BY_NC_ND CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives) AU AU_CC_BY CC BY (Attribution) AU AU_CC_BY_SA CC BY-SA (Attribution-Share Alike) AU AU_CC_BY_ND CC BY-ND (Attribution-No Derivatives) AU AU_CC_BY_NC CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial) AU AU_CC_BY_NC_SA CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-Share Alike) AU AU_CC_BY_NC_ND CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives) AU\n\nTo configure whether instructors can edit the creative commons value in Leganto:\n\nSet the parameter instructor_CC_editing (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true or false.\n\nDisabling Reading List Subjects\n\nYou can disable reading list subjects, if they are not relevant for your institution. When disabled, the Subjects tab does not appear on the Edit Reading List page; see Editing a Reading List.\n\nTo disable reading list subjects:\n\nConfigure the parameter subject_tags in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to false. The Subjects tab is removed from the Edit Reading List page and the ability to add or view subjects is removed from Leganto.\n\nConfiguring Reading List Templates (Classic UI Only)\n\nAn instructor can select a reading list template when creating a new reading list to pre-populate the list with sections.\n\nLeganto comes with a single out-of-the-box template, Blank Template, which contains no sections. A librarian (not an instructor) can save any existing reading list to create a new reading list template.\n\nReading list templates are configured in Leganto:\n\nTo create a template: while working with a list, in the reading list main menu select Save list structure as a template and confirm.\n\nTo delete a template: while viewing a list of templates to attach to a new list, select the X in the template tile and confirm.\n\nConfiguring What Happens to Deleted Lists\n\nYou can configure whether deleted lists are purged from Alma or remain in Alma so that they can be restored. Deleted lists are similar to archived lists, but they cannot be unarchived by simply changing the status. See Managing Reading Lists.\n\nTo configure whether deleted reading lists are saved or purged:\n\nConfigure the parameter delete_reading_list in the customer parameters table (Configuration > Leganto > General > Settings). When set to true (default), deleted reading lists are purged from Alma. When set to logical, deleted reading lists can be restored.\n\nWhen set to logical, deleted reading lists enter the Recently Deleted lists group. Reading lists in the Recently Deleted lists group are automatically purged from the system once they have spent more than 30 consecutive days in the group. This removal is permanent and is performed by a job that runs in the background. In addition, for each reading list in the Recently Deleted lists group, an indicator tells you how many days are left before the system purges the reading list.\n\nDeleting Reading Lists and Citations\n\nCitations that you delete from Alma or Leganto are automatically purged and cannot be restored. Courses that you delete from Alma are deleted along with any citations and associated reading lists, and are also automatically purged and cannot be restored.\n\nWhen a citation is deleted, its usage analytics are retained even though the details belonging to that citation are deleted. For example, a reading list's total usage retains all analytics related to the deleted citation even though the citation has been deleted and cannot be viewed.\n\nFor more information, see Reading Lists (Reading List Deleted).\n\nArchiving Reading Lists\n\nArchiving a reading list makes it inaccessible to students, and also hides it from the My Lists view for instructors. Archived lists remain indefinitely in the system, pending further action, and can be later unarchived to make them fully visible. You can archive reading lists in the following ways:\n\nFrom an individual reading list's Edit page\n\nFrom the Task List\n\nUsing the Reading List Bulk Update job\n\nArchiving Individual Reading Lists\n\nYou can archive an individual reading list from its Edit Reading List page and setting its Publication Status to Archived.\n\nArchiving Reading Lists from the Task List\n\nYou can archive multiple reading lists from the Reading Lists Task List by selecting them and setting their Publication Status to Archived.\n\nArchiving Reading Lists Using the Reading List Bulk Update Job\n\nYou can archive reading lists in bulk using the Reading List Bulk Update job and setting the Reading list publication status to Archived.\n\nViewing Archived Reading Lists\n\nInstructors can view and access archived reading lists by selecting the Filter and selecting Archived.\n\nInstructors can only see archived reading lists of which they are list owners.\n\nTo view the archived reading lists in Leganto, you must set the archived_lists flag to true (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nBy default, the archived_lists parameter is set to false.\n\nUnarchiving Reading Lists\n\nYou can unarchive a reading list in Leganto or from within Alma. Unarchiving a reading list puts it in Draft mode.\n\nTo unarchive a reading list in Leganto:\n\nFilter the list by Archived lists, and then select Unarchive on the list you want to unarchive.\n\nTo unarchive a reading list from Alma:\n\nIn the list menu for an archived list, select Unarchive.\n\nYou must set the archived_lists flag to true to enable the unarchiving feature (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features).\n\nBy default, the archived_lists flag is set to false.\n\nConfiguring List, Section, and Citation Menus\n\nThe following mapping tables enable you to configure which options appear in each of the associated menus. By default, all options are enabled in each table.\n\nIf either the Enabled toggle or the Enable field are set to false/No, the action is not displayed in the list. Both options must be set to true/Yes for the action to be displayed in the list.\n\nList Menu (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > List Menu) – Configures the options that appear in the reading list's main menu.\n\nSection Menu (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Section Menu) – Configures the options that appear in the reading list's section menus.\n\nCitation Menu (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Citation Menu) – Configures the options that appear in the reading list's citation item menus.\n\nConfiguring the Student View Error Message for Canvas\n\nWhen using a learning management system (LMS) such as Canvas, some functionality provided within reading lists may not be accessible if instructors have enabled the LMS's student view. To make sure that instructors are aware of this, you can configure the following message when they access a reading list while the LMS's Student View is enabled:\n\nWhile using your learning management system’s student view, some functionality may not be supported in the reading list. Please exit the student view and then open the reading list’s student view (Reading List’s main menu > View list as a student).\n\nIf instructors want access to a reading list's full functionality, they need to disable the LMS's student view and enable the reading list's student view.\n\nTo enable the error message for Student View in Canvas:\n\nEdit the external app and add the following custom field: canvas_masq=$Canvas.masqueradingUser.id. For more details, see Add Custom Field to the External App.\n\nTo customize the error message:\n\nEdit the Description and Translation fields for the new lti.user.error.studentView code that has been added to the UI Leganto Labels code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Labels).\n\nConfiguring the Right Panel (Classic UI Only)\n\nFrom the right panel, users can do the following:\n\nShow and hide the collaborator's panel.\n\nView the list advisor.\n\nView a course's instructor.\n\nRead student and library discussions.\n\nSee suggestions.\n\nWatch video recommendations.\n\nIn Alma, you can configure the collaborator's pane by setting the display_collaborators flag (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true.\n\nThe collaborator's panel is displayed in Leganto.\n\nConfiguring Links for Electronic Citations\n\nSee also Managing a Citation's Attachment to an Inventory Item.\n\nBy default, a link Check Availability appears on the reading list page for each citation. When the user selects this link, the citation details page appears in the Links & Availability section. You can configure the View Online link to appear instead of Check Availability. Selecting this link opens the first electronic version in the list of available links. This also applies to digital citations. The reason that some sites may wish to avoid this is that this link may trigger the popup blocker on some browsers. View online and Check availability links are available in the brief display only when links exist on a citation. If, for instance, you hide all digital presentations, the link is not presented.\n\nYou can also configure what happens to the source URL with a citation added using Cite It!. By default, the source URL from Cite It! is saved and any source URL in the resource is ignored. You can instead copy the source URL from Cite It! to the Notes field, remove the source URL and replace it with the source URL from the resource (if any). This only happens if the resource is located in the repository. See Configuring Repository Locate Workflow.\n\nYou can also configure how the location appears for an availability link.\n\nTo enable the View Online link:\n\nConfigure the parameter force_direct_uresolver in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true. The View Online link appears for each electronic and digital citation when viewing the reading list in Leganto. New for June! When the parameter set to false, rather than presenting the user with several links, when selecting View online, the More options button is hidden and the Full display is presented for the item.\n\nWhen you select View Online, the first available non-hidden link opens in a new tab. If all links are hidden, the citation page appears instead.\n\nTo copy the Cite It! source URL to the Notes field and remove it:\n\nConfigure the parameter move_source_url in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings). If you would like to have the source URL copied to the Notes field and removed as a source, set the parameter to one of the following:\n\non_locate – to move the source URL when the citation is matched to a repository item\n\nresolving – to move the source URL when the citation matches to library inventory via the link resolver\n\nall – both on_locate and resolving\n\nIf you do not want to move the source URL, leave the parameter blank.\n\nTo configure how the location appears for an availability link:\n\nConfigure the parameter citation_availability_format in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings) to one of the following:\n\nDisplay first available location and library.\n\nDisplay institution name, only.\n\nDisplay library and institution if there is only one availability option, otherwise display institution name, only.\n\nConfiguring Repository Locate Workflow\n\nTo configure whether a citation's information is overridden by any conflicting repository information after Alma finds a match in the repository, configure the customer parameter on_locate (Configuration Menu > Fulfillment > General > Other Settings). After a match is found: when set to overlay, Alma overrides citation information with information in the repository (if the information is missing in the repository, the information in the citation remains as is); when set to merge, Alma merges the information in the citation with the information in the repository (in other words, only missing citation information is filled in using information from the repository); when set to ignore, Alma ignores the information in the repository; when set to overlay_no_type, Alma overrides the citation information with information in the repository but the type remains as is.\n\nWe recommend using the overlay_no_type value rather than the overlay value.\n\nAlso see the parameters resource_locate_multiple_matches and resource_locate_multiple_matches_priority in Configuring Other Settings, citation_resource_located in Configuring Default Statuses for Citations/Reading Lists, and move_source_url above.\n\nEnabling Broken Link Reporting\n\nTo remove alerts about broken links, see Removing Alerts from Citations. For information about debugging an item's uResolver (OpenURL) link, see Debugging Citation uResolver Links.\n\nTo enable Leganto users to report broken links:\n\nSet the parameter mark_as_broken in the Leganto Features table (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to links to enable Leganto users to report broken links when there is at least one available link to a resource (electronic, digital, URL, or uploaded file, but not physical). Set to all to enable Leganto users to report broken links also when there is no availability. In both cases, the ability to mark as broken does not appear when there is physical availability and no other links. Leave blank to disable the ability to mark links as broken. The Mark as Broken action appears beside resource links in Leganto.\n\nWhen the mark_as_broken (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) is set to all, the Mark as broken link also appears when a citation only contains hidden links, so that students can report when links are missing.\n\nLeganto also includes the parameter mark_as_broken_comment_mandatory (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to require users to include a comment when reporting a broken link. When set to true, users must enter a comment when reporting a broken link. When set to false, comments are optional. The default for the parameter is false.\n\nWhen marking a link as broken, when the parameter mark_as_broken_file_upload (Configuration > Leganto > General > Settings) is set to true, users also have the option to include a file when reporting a broken link. The default for the parameter is true.\n\nSupported file types:\n\npdf\n\npng\n\njpg\n\njpeg\n\nimg\n\ngif\n\ntxt\n\nmp3\n\nThe maximum file size when uploading files is 50 MB.\n\nWhen a link is marked as broken, an alert is added to Alma.\n\nSelecting the reporter's name opens the Leganto Broken Links Report.\n\nThe library can then view the file by downloading it from the Leganto Broken Links Report.\n\nTo configure that email notifications are sent to Alma users :\n\nConfigure the mark_as_broken_email_notification (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) parameter, using a comma to enter multiple entries. If the mark_as_broken_user_notification parameter is populated, a copy of the letter is also available in the user's Attachments list.\n\nTo configure that email notifications are sent to specific email addresses (such as a generic helpdesk), configure the mark_as_broken_email_notification parameter, using a comma to enter multiple entries.\n\nIt is possible to have email notifications sent to both specific users and specific email addresses. When either the mark_as_broken_email_notification parameter or the mark_as_broken_user_notification parameter is configured, an email is sent to that address each time a link or file is marked as broken. When multiple users report the same link as broken, a counter is added in the Alerts tab indicating how many users have marked the link as broken.\n\nThe Leganto Link Marked As Broken Letter (enabled by default) can be customized under General > Letters > Letter Configuration.\n\nNotifying Users When Broken Links are Resolved\n\nYou can send notifications to users who have reported broken links when the library staff has resolved the issue. Upon selecting Remove to remove a broken link alert in Alma, the staff member is prompted to Confirm that they do want to remove the broken link alert. Additionally, the confirmation message now includes the option to send a notification to the user about the resolved link. To send the broken link notification, keep the Notify user checkbox checked and select the relevant notification template (configured from (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Broken Link Notification Template Name)) for the fixed link. The text from the template displays in the Note to user box, and can be customized if needed. There is one out-of-the-box template which reads \"We have resolved the issue. You can now access the item using the link below.\"\n\nIf no template is enabled in Configuration > Leganto > Features > Broken Link Notification Template Name, the Leganto Marked As Broken Resolved Letter is sent without the Note to user text.\n\nWhen the library staff member chooses Confirm, each user who reported the broken link receives the Leganto Marked As Broken Resolved Letter (Configuration > General > Letters > Letters Configuration). This letter is enabled by default.\n\nThe default text for the Note to user per template is customized in the Note to User (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Broken Link Notification) field. Library staff can override this text when sending the user notification.\n\nChanges to the Note to user text in the alert are sent in the language in which they are inputted, not the user's configured language.\n\nConfiguring Whether Instructors Can Disable Availability Links\n\nYou can configure whether instructors can disable links from appearing to students in the Links and Availability section for a citation. An instructor can independently disable or enable (when available):\n\nEach electronic link\n\nThe uploaded file\n\nThe source URL, which is the citation's website\n\nEach digital representation\n\nAll physical availability as a group; you cannot disable or enable specific holdings.\n\nTo configure whether instructors can disable links from appearing to students in the Links and Availability section:\n\nSet the parameter instructor_manage_citation_available_link in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true or false.\n\nConfiguring Availability for Citations Grouped in Leganto and Primo\n\nAlma considers availability based on related records. Primo typically runs a DEDUP process, and so the availability of the records is often different than it is in Alma. You can configure whether Leganto uses Alma or Primo availability when displaying citations added using a Primo search scope. Citations added using the Alma search scope or using Cite It! always use Alma availability.\n\nIf you are a Primo VE customer, you can force the physical availability request pane on the Citation page to look more closely at how it does in Primo VE.\n\nYou can also configure whether Primo availability restrictions appear in Leganto search results when searching for items to add as citations.\n\nTwo parameters control the availability in Leganto:\n\nrelated_records: If this parameter is on, and a citation has two related records grouped together in Alma (i.e. one electronic and one physical), and you added availability for one of these to a citation in Leganto, the availability for both items displays in Leganto. The availability can also come from two or more different items if they are related in Alma.\n\nprimo_availability_for_citations: In Alma, you may have two items, one electronic and one physical, which are not grouped together but are grouped together in Primo (as DEDUP). If the primo_availability_for_citations_added_from_primo parameter is set to true, Leganto displays the merged availability of the two items. If you have a group in Primo and the second parameter is set to false, and you add one item (i.e. electronic) from the group from Primo, it is not grouped in Leganto.\n\nTo configure whether record inventory related in Alma appears for a citation in Leganto:\n\nSet the related_records parameter to true or false (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings). When set to true, record inventory-related in Alma appears for citations in Leganto. For more information on the inventory of related records, see Configuring Related Records for Physical Inventory and Configuring Related Records for Electronic Services).\n\nTo configure whether record inventory related in Primo appears for a citation in Leganto:\n\nConfigure the parameter primo_availability_for_citations_added_from_primo in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings). When set to true (default), availability is considered as it is in Primo (after the DEDUP process, if configured). When set to false, availability for citations added using a Primo search scope is considered as it is in Alma (using related records, if configured).\n\nWhen both parameters are on, if an item is added from Primo, the related_records parameter is not used. Thus, if two items are related in Alma but not in Primo, and both parameters are on, if you add an item from Primo, it is not related to the other item.\n\nTo enable Primo VE availability format:\n\nSelect Enable silent login on the Primo VE User Authentication page; see Configuring the Login Links.\n\nSet the parameter primove_getit to true (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings) to force the physical availability request pane on the Citation page to look more closely at how it does in Primo VE.\n\nTo hide the Primo sign in banner and only display the Leganto sign in link:\n\nConfigure the parameter display_primo_ve_login (Configuration > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings) to false (default true) to hide the Primo VE login banner so that only the Leganto sign in option is displayed.\n\nTo display Primo availability restrictions in Leganto:\n\nConfigure the parameter display_primo_restriction_label in the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings) to true or false. The labels (access restricted, not restricted, and so forth.) appear in Leganto.\n\nTo hide digitization requests from Primo in Leganto:\n\nConfigure the parameter hide_primo_digitization on the Primo Settings page (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Discovery > Primo Settings) to true to exclude the ability to submit a digitization request. The default setting for the parameter is false. Note that Primo VE is not supported. See Leganto Customer Settings Mapping Table Parameters.\n\nConfiguring Display Options\n\nConfiguring Citation Information Appearing in Citation Lists\n\nYou can configure how citations appear on a) the reading list page, b) My Collection/Favorites, and c) search results in Leganto in the Brief Citation Format mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Brief Citation Format). For more information about mapping tables, see Mapping Tables.\n\nYou can configure one or two rows for each material type. Two rows for Book, Article, and Book Chapter material types are defined by default, as well as two rows for Default material type, which is used if the citation's material type is not defined. Note you can edit the entries for Default but you cannot remove them.\n\nYou can add, edit, and delete rows in the table, and you can disable or enable rows.\n\nWhen adding or editing a row:\n\nIn the Type column, select the material type.\n\nIn the Row column, select First or Second for the row that you are configuring. Citation information is typically split between two rows. When a user views a reading list in compact format, only the first row appears.\n\nIn the Fields Order column, enter the row format, using the following guidelines:\n\nCitation field. In addition to the fields in the Citation Field Code column of the Primo Mapping mapping table (see Field Mapping from Primo PNX to Leganto Citations), you can use the fields part, pmid, rlterms_callNumber, rlterms_chapter. rlterms_volumePartNumber, series_title_number, and source.\n\nThe format is in JSON. Each row contains an array in square brackets [].\n\nSimple field format: {\"n\":\"field_name\"} is replaced by the contents of the field value, if it exists. Otherwise it is skipped. For example, {\"n\":\"title\"} might be replaced with History of the Middle Ages.\n\nPrefix/suffix format: {\"n\": \"field_name\", \"p\": \"prefix\", \"s\": \"suffix\"} is replaced by the contents of the field value, prefixed by the text string in prefix and suffixed by the text string in suffix, if the value exists. If prefix or suffix is a valid label name, the label's value is used (see configuring labels in Configuring Headings and Text in Leganto). For example, {\"n\": \"issue\", \"p\": \"(\", \"s\": \")\"} might be replaced with (22). You can define a prefix, a suffix, or both.\n\nField range format: {\"fields\": [{\"n\": \"field_1\"}, {\"n\": \"field_2\"}], \"delimiter\": \"delimiter\"} groups two fields together, separated by a delimiter. The delimiter is only used if both fields have value. For example, {\"fields\": [{\"n\": \"start_page\"}, {\"n\": \"end_page\"}], \"delimiter\": \"-\"} might be replaced with 1-10.\n\nThe out-of-the-box values are:\n\nBook, first row: Just the book title.\n\n[{\"n\":\"title\"}]\n\nBook, second row: Creator, Additional Person Name. Edition. Place of Publication. Publisher. Volume. Publication Date. Total Pages Total Pages.\n\n[{\"n\":\"creator\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_additionalPersonName\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_edition\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_placeOfPublication\"},{\"n\":\"publisher\"},{\"n\":\"volume\"},{\"n\":\"date\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_pages\", \"p\":\"citation.brief.totalPages \"}]\n\nArticle, first row: Just the article title.\n\n[{\"n\":\"title\"}]\n\nArticle, Second row: Creator. Additional Person Name. Journal Title. Edition. Volume(Issue). Date, Start Page-End Page.\n\n[{\"n\":\"creator\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_additionalPersonName\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_journalTitle\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_edition\"},{\"fields\": [{\"n\": \"rlterms_volumePartNumber\"}, {\"n\": \"rlterms_issue\",\"p\": \"(\", \"s\": \")\" }], \"delimiter\": \"\"},{\"n\":\"date\"},{\"fields\": [{\"n\": \"start_page\"}, {\"n\": \"end_page\"}], \"delimiter\": \" - \"}]\n\nBook Chapter, first row: Just the chapter title.\n\n[{\"n\":\"rlterms_chapter_title\"}]\n\nBook Chapter, second row: Chapter Author. In Book Title. By Creator. Additional Person Name. Edited by Editor. Edition. Place of Publication. Publisher. Date. Start Page – End Page. Note that In, By, and Edited by are labels that you can configure.\n\n[{\"n\":\"rlterms_chapter_author\"},{\"n\":\"title\", \"p\":\"citation.brief.bookChapter.inBook \"},{\"n\":\"creator\", \"p\":\"citation.brief.bookChapter.byCreator \"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_additionalPersonName\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_editor\", \"p\":\"citation.brief.bookChapter.editedBy \"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_edition\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_placeOfPublication\"},{\"n\":\"publisher\"},{\"n\":\"date\"},{\"fields\": [{\"n\": \"start_page\"}, {\"n\": \"end_page\"}], \"delimiter\": \" - \"}]\n\nDefault, first row: Just the title.\n\n[{\"n\":\"title\"}]\n\nDefault, second row: Creator. Additional Person Name. Edition. Place of Publication. Publisher. Volume. Publication Date. Total Pages Total Pages. Note that Total Pages is a label.\n\n[{\"n\":\"creator\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_additionalPersonName\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_edition\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_placeOfPublication\"},{\"n\":\"publisher\"},{\"n\":\"volume\"},{\"n\":\"date\"},{\"n\":\"rlterms_pages\", \"p\":\"citation.brief.totalPages \"}]\n\nIf a line containing an author field is too long, the author value is truncated and followed by ellipses (...). Note that any value (other than the title value) is truncated if the screen is too long to display the entire field.\n\nThe creator field is not truncated when it is part of a prefix/suffix or field range format.\n\nPreventing Users from Viewing Thumbnail Images\n\nNew for August! To prevent users from viewing thumbnail images, when the parameter show_image_as_thumbnail (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) is set to false (default), all thumbnails for manually added images are now hidden. When set to true, the default thumbnail image is displayed.\n\nChanges to the parameter are not applied retroactively.\n\nConfiguring Quick Edit Options (New UI)\n\nQuick edit can be customized to show/hide the Hide from students checkbox, Due date or Note for Students. The parameter quick_edit_options (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) can be left blank to hide all options, set to all to display all options, or hide/date/note to display the Hide from students checkbox, Due date or Note for Students. Regardless of the parameter configuration, all options remain visible in the Full display.\n\nShowing Complete Status on Brief View (New UI)\n\nUsers can configure whether to show/hide the Complete status for items from the brief view. When the parameter complete_citation_status (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) is set (default blank), items with a status of Complete will have their status display in the brief view. The parameter can be configured for both librarians and instructors (all), just librarians (librarian), or just instructors (instructor). When left blank, the status is not displayed.\n\nAdding/Editing Citation Field Mappings\n\nYou can configure which fields to include in the citation full display and the citation Add/Edit form. The fields are configured per citation type in the Citation Field Mapping Table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI). Types not configured in this table are mapped as Type Other.\n\nThe order of the fields can be defined in the Order field, and fields can be marked as Mandatory or not.\n\nIf you reuse a number, the order of those fields is added randomly to the form,\n\nSelect Edit item to display the information in the Edit item form.\n\nWhen removing a mapping from this table ensure you also remove this field from the Brief Citation Format mapping table.\n\nFor more information, watch Leganto Add/Edit Citation Fields. (1:32 minutes).\n\nCitation Field Mapping\n\nEach field can be defined for all types.\n\nCitation Field Name Comment Additional Author Additional Person Name Additional Title Author Author initials Barcode Call Number Chapter Author Chapter Number Chapter Title Day DOI Edition Editor Tag End Page End Page2 ISBN ISSN Issue Book/Journal Title When added to a Journal, it appears in the UI as a Journal Title LCCN Number Month Note OCLC Number Other Standard Id Pages Part Place of Publication PMID Publication Date Publisher Remote record ID Series Title Number Source Start Page Start Page2 Title* The Title is mandatory for each type. For Book Chapter, the field is called Book title. Volume Volume Part Number Year\n\nExporting Filtered Lists from Leganto\n\nYou can export a filtered list from Leganto showing only specific fields. Set your filters by selecting the filter icon and selecting your filter(s).\n\nOnce you have made a filter selection, you can export the list using the Export list action in the List actions menu.\n\nChoose the Export to file type, how to sort the file, and which fields to export.\n\nFor more information on exporting filtered reading lists, see Exporting a Filtered Reading List.\n\nEnabling Instructor Information in Leganto\n\nThe instructors_in_leganto parameter in the Leganto Features mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) allows you to display instructor information: a list of instructors in course tooltips and a pane beside a course-related reading list (Classic UI) or in the list information (New UI) containing the course's instructors. The following options are valid:\n\nauthenticated – Instructor names appear only for authenticated Leganto users.\n\ntrue – Instructor names appear for all Leganto users.\n\nfalse – Instructor names do not appear for Leganto users.\n\nInstructor names can be turned on and off for each instructor; see Adding a Course.\n\nEnabling Reading List / Citation Analytics Information (List Analysis)\n\nYou can configure whether to display Analytics information about reading lists and citations in Leganto. This feature is known as List Analysis. For more information on List Analysis, see Working With Reading Lists (Classic UI) and Viewing Student Usage (New UI).\n\nTo enable Analytics information for instructors and/or students:\n\nConfigure the parameter list_analysis in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features). When set to all, Analytics is enabled for all users. When set to instructors, Analytics is enabled for instructors (and librarians) only. When left blank, Analytics is disabled for all users.\n\nConfiguring Digital Representation Display Options\n\nThe following parameters in the Leganto Customer Settings mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings) enables you to control how digital representations appear in Leganto:\n\ndisplay_digital_representations — When set to true, digital representations always appear in Leganto. When set to false (default), the action Manage Digital Representations appears for each digital citation on the Edit Reading List page. See Managing a Citation's Digital Representations.\n\ndisplay_inactive_digital_representations — When set to true (default), Leganto displays digital representations that are inactive in Alma. When set to false, Leganto only displays digital representations that are active in Alma\n\ndisplay_digital_in_collection — When set to true (default), Leganto allows students to copy digital representations to their collection. When set to false, Leganto only allows students to view the metadata.\n\nConfiguring PDFs to Open in a New Tab\n\nYou can configure PDFs to open in a new tab by default by setting the pdf_use_leganto_viewer (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) parameter to true. When set to true, the PDF opens in a new tab and is downloadable. If the parameter is left blank or set to false, the PDF does not open in a new tab by default. If the parameter is set to readonly, then the PDF opens in a new tab by default but is not downloadable in the brief or full citation views.\n\nCreating Private Annotations\n\nUsers can add annotations and highlights to PDFs that are embedded in citations.\n\nWhen allow_citation_public_annotation (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) is set to true (default), a toggle appears on the Course Materials and you have the option to enable or disable Public Annotations on a per case basis. If Publication Annotations are enabled on the Course Materials, and a comment is added, the comment remains Private (default) and is only visible to the user who added the comment. If a comment is set to Public, the name of the person who wrote the comment, and the date and time of the comment are visible in the annotation menu. Public comments are searchable in the annotations menu. Each student's name appears in a different color above their comment, and instructor comments appear with an instructor icon next to their name. Instructors can delete public comments.\n\nIf allow_citation_public_annotation is set to false, the toggle is hidden on the Course Materials.\n\nPrivate/public annotations are only copied when selecting Move item to the same list.\n\nBelow are the rules for when private/public annotations are not copied:\n\nDuplicating a list\n\nSelecting Copy to my collection\n\n(Classic UI only) Selecting rollover\n\nCopying a section/citation to another list\n\nCopying a section/citation to a current list\n\nSelecting Move item to a different list\n\nYou can create a shape without adding a comment.\n\nSelect an icon to apply an action to the PDF. Select the icon a second time to cancel the operation.\n\nIcon\n\nFunctionality\n\nAdd a comment.\n\nAdd shape around a marked text with the selected color.\n\nOpen the side panel. The panel can also be opened by selecting text in the file that has a comment.\n\nOpen the PDF in full screen (or a new tab).\n\nOpen a floating menu that includes highlighting and commenting. This option also allows selecting text in the PDF without using the selection icon in the menu.\n\nHide/show page annotations. When annotations are on the page, click the eye icon to hide the annotations. Click the icon again to display the annotations.\n\nThe side panel includes an option to search existing comments for public annotations. Comments can be Set as Private, edited, or deleted.\n\nSocial Reading: Public Annotations on Course Materials\n\nStudents and instructors can share their annotations with each other. When allow_citation_public_annotation (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) is set to true (default), a toggle appears on citations with embedded PDFs, giving instructors the option to enable or disable Public Annotations on a per PDF/Citation basis.\n\nIf allow_citation_public_annotation is set to false, the Public/Private toggle is hidden on the PDF header.\n\nIf Public Annotations are enabled on the PDF header, the user can select whether their annotation should be public or private. The default is Private, in which case the annotation is only visible to the user who added the annotation.\n\nIf an annotation is Set to Public, the name of the person who wrote the comment, and the date and time of the comment are visible in the annotation menu. Public comments are searchable in the annotations menu. Each student's name appears in a different color above their comment, and instructor comments appear with an instructor icon next to their name. Instructors can Set as Private, Edit, or Delete public annotations.\n\nUsers can also change their own comments from Public to Private, or from Private to Public.\n\nAdditionally, Instructors can use the Edit Multiple Items tool in Leganto to enable or disable public annotations.\n\nAnnotations are stored as a separate layer on the file, visible only in Leganto and within the context of the reading list. They will not be added to printed or downloaded versions of the file, and private/public annotations are only copied when selecting Move item to the same list.\n\nBelow are the rules for when private/public annotations are not copied:\n\nDuplicating a list\n\nSelecting Copy to my collection\n\n(Classic UI only) Selecting rollover\n\nCopying a section/citation to another list\n\nCopying a section/citation to the current list\n\nSelecting Move item to a different list\n\nFor more information, watch Creating Private Annotations.\n\nConfiguring Discussions in Leganto\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure whether student discussions are enabled or disabled:\n\nIn the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features), set the parameter student_discussions to true, false, or instructor_enabled. When set to instructor_enabled, the instructor can enable or disable the student discussion for each list and its citations.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure the default header that appears in the student discussion panels:\n\nTo enable/disable student discussion headers in all reading lists, in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features), configure the parameter discussion_header_enabled (true/false).\n\nTo set the default value of the student discussion header for all reading lists, configure the parameter discussion_header_default_text (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features). Enter the text you would like as the default.\n\nTo configure whether library discussions are enabled or disabled:\n\nIn the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features), set the parameter library_discussions to all or citation to enable the Library discussions tab.\n\nConfiguring Whether Students Can \"Like\" Citations (Classic UI Only)\n\nTo configure whether students can like citations:\n\nIn the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features), configure the parameter like (true/false).\n\nConfiguring Reading List Suggestions\n\nTo configure who can suggest citations for reading lists:\n\nIn the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features), configure the parameter suggestions to all or library (only librarians can suggest citations), or leave blank to disable all suggestions from users.\n\nConfiguring the Display of Other Formats and Editions of Citations\n\nThis feature requires the field search:addsrcrecordid in Primo PNX. If you modify the normalization rules and have removed this field, the feature does not work.\n\nThis feature requires you to set primo_default_search_scope to a Primo/Primo VE search scope. For more information on this parameter, see Configuring Search Repository. If primo_default_search_scope is not set, this feature does not work.\n\nYou can enable the display of alternate (physical) editions and alternate (electronic) formats of a citation linked to a repository resource. When enabled, the suggested alternatives appear in Leganto, and the ability to view them appears in Alma on the Edit Citations and Edit Reading List pages (see Managing Citations). Suggestions for electronic resources come from the uResolver. Suggestions for alternate physical editions come from the Primo API if FRBR is configured.\n\nThe display of alternate physical editions is not supported for Summon customers. Alternate electronic formats are supported.\n\nConfigure the parameter other_formats_and_editions in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features). The available options are:\n\nno value - Do not display other formats or editions\n\nformats - Display electronic formats\n\neditions - Display other physical editions\n\nall - Display formats and editions\n\nWhen this parameter is not empty, Other Formats and Editions appear as a row action on the Edit Citations and Edit Reading List pages. Select this action to view the suggested alternatives on the Other Resources page.\n\nTo add one of the suggested resources as a new citation in the list, select Add to List in the row actions list.\n\nTo add one of the suggested resources to the citation, select Add to Citation in the row actions list.\n\nAdd to Citation only merges the availability of different types such as P + E or P + D. Trying to merge two physical items, for example, results in a single physical availability.\n\nConfiguring Whether the Total Pages of All Citations in a Section or Reading List Appears\n\nYou can configure that the total number of pages for all citations in a reading list or section appears at the top of the reading list or section. When enabled, the total also appears on the Edit Reading List page in Alma (see Managing Citations).\n\nTo enable page counts in Leganto (and Alma):\n\nSet the parameter page_count in the Leganto Features table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true.\n\nConfiguring Copyright Expiration Warnings\n\nYou can configure whether students see warnings in Leganto about citations whose copyrights will soon expire.\n\nTo enable copyright expiration warnings for students:\n\nIn the customer parameters table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > Settings), set the parameter course_materials_expiration_warning to the number of days before the copyright expiration from which Leganto displays the message to students.\n\nManaging Bibliographic Styles\n\nOn the Bibliographic Styles mapping table (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Bibliographic Styles) you can manage bibliographic styles that are available when Leganto users export to Microsoft Word (See Quick Cite: Export a Single Citation in a Specific Reference Format). For more information about mapping tables, see Mapping Tables.\n\nYou can enable and disable styles, and you can change the display name of a style. You can also delete styles.\n\nYou can add styles if they have a valid code. Valid codes are items ending with .csl (without the .csl) on the page https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles. For example, acm-siggraph.\n\nHiding Incomplete Citations from Students\n\nBy default, Leganto displays incomplete citations (which are citations that are not marked Complete), but hides the following from students:\n\nThe option to download a file if one exists.\n\nThe links of the citation if the citation requires a copyright.\n\nIf you set the hide_uncompleted_citations parameter to true in the Leganto Features mapping table (Configuration Menu > Fulfillment > Leganto > Leganto Features), you can hide the entire citation if it has not been marked Complete. When set to false, the citation appears regardless of its status.\n\nIf you set the hide_uncompleted_citations to a specific status or combined status (BeingPrepared, Complete, Declined, Inactive, InProcess, ReadyForProcessing, or a code from the Additional Reading List Citation Statuses code table), citations with those specified statuses are hidden from students.\n\nFor example, Leganto does not display the highlighted citation to students since it has not been marked Complete:\n\nConfiguring File Upload in Leganto\n\nYou can configure the following:\n\nWhether instructors can upload files to the blank form. See Adding a Citation Manually.\n\nWhether instructors can upload a syllabus file for a reading list. See Enabling Reading List Syllabuses.\n\nWhether instructors can upload files that contain an entire reading list. (This is instead of creating a reading list using the standard Leganto workflow. The option appears on the landing page when entering Leganto using a link from a CMS.) See Configuring Whether Instructors Can Upload Files that Contain Reading Lists.\n\nThe maximum file size and default copyright status when uploading a file as a citation, and whether the instructor can delete the file after uploading it. See Configuring File Upload for My Collection or as Citations.\n\nThe following are supported file types for uploads:\n\napplication/pdf\n\nimage/png\n\nimage/jpeg\n\nimage/jpeg\n\nimage/png\n\nimage/gif\n\ntext/plain\n\naudio/mpeg\n\naudio/ogg\n\nvideo/mp4\n\nvideo/webm\n\naudio/wav\n\napplication/x-navistyle\n\nConfiguring Whether Instructors Can Upload Files that Contain Reading Lists\n\nWhen coming from a CMS, instructors are presented with a special course-directed login page. When enabled, instructors are offered the option of uploading a file containing all of their reading list information so that librarians can create the reading lists for them. This file is not processed in any way by Leganto; it is simply sent to the librarians. It is assumed that this file is a manually created text, PDF, or Word document of some kind.\n\nTo configure whether instructors can upload a reading list file on the course-directed welcome page:\n\nSet the parameter cms_entry_actions to all or include the value file (Configuration Menu > Leganto > LTI > Settings). This parameter accepts multiple values, separated by commas. The option to upload a reading list file appears on the course-directed welcome page. If set to any other value or left empty, the option to upload a reading list file does not appear on this page.\n\nConfiguring File Upload for My Collection/Favorites or as Citations\n\nYou can configure the maximum size for any file uploads (including course reading material or My Collection/Favorites items) by instructors or students. You can also configure whether the instructor can delete the file after uploading it.\n\nTo configure the maximum size for uploaded files (including thumbnails) for items/citations:\n\nConfigure the parameters max_file_size_allowed_cms_entry_MB, max_file_size_allowed_faculty_MB, and max_file_size_allowed_students_MB (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Settings). If left empty, the default for instructors (faculty) is 50 MB. The default for students is 2 MB. Enter 0 to disable uploading for the relevant user type. When set to 0, file upload is disabled for the user type.\n\nYou can configure the copyright options presented to an instructor when the instructor uploads a file while creating a citation.\n\nTo configure copyright status options when uploading files as citations:\n\nAdd or edit the rows in the File Upload Copyright Options mapping table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > List Management > File Upload Copyright Options).\n\nYou can also set the order of copyright options and enable the default setting for the File Upload Copyright Options (Configuration > Leganto > List Management > File Upload Copyright Options).\n\nFor more information about mapping tables, see Mapping Tables; however, note that this mapping table behaves differently than most mapping tables, as described in the note, below.\n\nThe options are presented to the instructor after the instructor uploads a file while manually creating a citation. For each option, you can manually select the copyright status to which the option maps:\n\nApproved\n\nDeclined\n\nFair Use\n\nNot Determined\n\nNot Required\n\nRequired\n\nSelf Declared\n\nWaiting for Approval\n\nWaiting for CC\n\nThe copyright statuses cannot be configured. For more information on these statuses, see Managing a Citation's Copyright Status.\n\nThe labels that appear in the UI can be translated using the Customer Labels code table, as explained here.\n\nThe toggle switch in the Enabled column on this page does not enable or disable the row. Instead, enable the row that you would like to be the default selected value in Leganto and disable all other rows. If you do not enable any rows, the first row is the default selected option (Classic UI) or no default is selected (New UI). If you enable more than one row, one of these rows (essentially a random one) is the default selected option.\n\nThe parameter citation_uploaded_file must have a value for this table to have any effect. See Configuring Default Statuses for Citations/Reading Lists. If no value is assigned to citation_uploaded_file, the options in this table do not appear in Leganto.\n\nAlma only assigns the status defined in citation_uploaded_file to a citation if (in Leganto) the instructor selects an option from this table with a value of Self Declared or Fair Use. If the instructor selects an option with any other value, the value in citation_uploaded_file is not assigned to the citation.\n\nTo configure whether instructors can delete files after they were uploaded:\n\nConfigure the parameter instructor_remove_file (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to true (enable instructors to delete uploaded files) or false.\n\nConfiguring Sections Behavior\n\nYou can configure the following for sections:\n\nWhether sections are expanded or collapsed by default when opening the reading list.\n\n(Classic UI only) Whether opening Leganto using a section link, the other sections are collapsed or the relevant section is pre-selected using a filter. This applies whether you arrive using an LTI link or a shareable link.\n\n(Classic UI only) Enable Leganto users to view reading lists in compact format. When enabled, users can toggle between standard and compact view.\n\n(Classic UI only) Where newly created sections appear (top or bottom of reading list).\n\nTo configure whether sections are collapsed or expanded by default:\n\nSet the parameter sections_collapsed in the customer parameters table (Configuration > Leganto > UI > Settings) to true or false. If there is only one section, it will appear expanded, regardless of the setting of this parameter.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure whether, when opening Leganto using a section link, the other sections are collapsed or the relevant section is pre-selected using a filter:\n\nSet the parameter on_section_shareable link_use_filter in the customer parameters table to true or false.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure whether compact view is enabled:\n\nSet the parameter list_compact_view in the customer parameters table to true. When enabled, compact view is the default view.\n\n(Classic UI Only) To configure where newly created sections appear in a reading list:\n\nConfigure the parameter new_section_last in the customer parameters table. When set to false (default), new sections appear at the top of the reading list. When set to true, new sections appear at the bottom of the list. Note that new sections created by duplicating a section always appear directly below the duplicated section.\n\nConfiguring Find Lists Settings (Classic UI Only)\n\nFor the new UI, see Searching Lists and Items.\n\nThe Find List Settings mapping table (Configuration > Leganto > Features > Find List Settings) enables you to configure the search fields in Find Lists.\n\nFrom this page, you can configure the following:\n\nEnable/disable a search field.\n\nSpecify whether a search field will appear on the advanced Find Lists page or on both the simple and advanced Find Lists pages\n\nSpecify a default value for a search field.\n\nAdd another search field. Select Add Row.\n\nTo configure a search field:\n\nFor each mapping row (which defines each search field in Find Lists), specify the following fields:\n\nEnabled – Select this option to enable a search field in Find Lists.\n\nName – Specify the name for one or more of the following search fields:\n\ncourse_status\n\nacademic_department\n\nsubject\n\npublication\n\nlist_title\n\ncourse_code\n\ncourse_title\n\ncourse_instructors\n\ndescription\n\ncourse_year\n\ncourse_term\n\nparent_reading_list\n\nType – Specify a search type: Simple (fields appear in both simple and advanced searches) or Advanced (fields appear in advanced searches only).\n\nDefault – (optional) Specify the default status for the search field. For search fields other than the following fields, you can specify a free-text value:\n\ncourse_status – Select active or inactive.\n\nacademic department – Select all or a code from the (Configuration > Fulfillment > Courses > Academic Departments).\n\nsubject – Select all or a code from the (Configuration > Fulfillment > Courses > List Subjects or Additional List Subjects).\n\npublication – Select published or draft.\n\nCustomizing the Leganto Login Page\n\nThe UI Leganto Labels page (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Labels) enables you to configure the labels on the Leganto login page, including a title. To customize the login page, modify the following codes:\n\nlogin.description – If not left blank, this code displays text above the login fields.\n\nlogin.error.message – Upon login failure, the following message appears: Invalid UserID and/or Password. Please re-enter\n\nlogin.userid – User Name\n\nlogin.password – Password\n\nCustomizing the Leganto Login Error Page\n\nIn some cases, Leganto displays an error page and message when users fail to sign in to Leganto.\n\nThe UI Leganto Labels code table (Configuration Menu > Leganto > General > Labels) enables you to configure separate messages for the following error scenarios:\n\nFor users who have signed in via SAML and do not exist in Alma, configure the following codes:\n\nlogin.error.page.title_1 – Defines the title of the error page for this scenario.\n\nlogin.error.page.body_1 – Defines the error message displayed on this error page.\n\nFor Alma users who have not been assigned either a Patron or Instructor role, configure the following codes:\n\nlogin.error.page.title_2 – Defines the title of the error page for this scenario.\n\nlogin.error.page.body_2 – Defines the error message displayed on this error page.\n\nAdding Indentation to Sections in Reading Lists (Classic UI Only)\n\nLeganto allows you to add indentation to reading list sections (Configuration Menu > Leganto > Features > Leganto Features) to show up to four hierarchical levels within reading lists. You can do this by setting the display_section_indentation parameter value to true.\n\nTo add indentation to a section:\n\nOpen the reading list.\n\nSelect the Toggle Section View icon to collapse the sections.\n\nSelect the right/left arrows to add/remove the section's indentation.\n\nConfiguring Citation Default Thumbnails\n\nYou can use URLs for default thumbnails (those that do not come from Syndetics). This is configured in Citation Default Thumbnails (Configuration Menu > Leganto > UI > Citation default thumbnails).\n\nSelect the citation type and enter the Thumbnail URL to be used as the new default thumbnail. The supported size is 100 width * 160 height."
