        "text": "Social media marketing is constantly evolving. From new features to algorithm changes, keeping up with the latest platform requirements has never been more important.\n\nSocial media image sizes tend to be one of the most overlooked aspects of marketing your business on social media. But using the wrong dimensions can mean your assets are blurry, distorted and unengaging.\n\nBut getting image sizes right on social media doesnât have to be hard: you just need the latest up-to-date cheat sheet for what dimensions you should be using and why.\n\nWeâre covering all the most important social media platforms youâre probably using every day like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, and more.\n\nWhat are the best image sizes for social media in 2024?\n\nStaying up to date with recommended image sizes on social media is a non-negotiable for brands, businesses and creators in 2024. Thatâs why weâve compiled your ultimate guide to every image and asset size you need to know about across all the key social media platforms.Â\n\nWith this complete guide, youâll be in the best position to produce visual content thatâs optimized for each platform (and able to be easily repurposed across multiple networks).\n\nâ\n\nRecommended Instagram image size in 2024\n\nInstagram image sizes have changed over the years and theyâve moved away from your standard square image posts to include vertical images, Instagram stories, and Reels.\n\nInstagram has also moved to an eCommerce powerhouse where your Instagram profile acts as a digital storefront with the expansion of Instagram Shopping. Since people can not only learn more about your brand through your Instagram profile but also shop for your products your images always have to be high-resolution and in the right image dimensions to boost engagement and drive sales.\n\nInstagram profile picture size\n\nInstagram profile pictures are 110 x 110 pixels. But, this image file size is only made to be seen from a mobile phone, so youâll want to ensure you upload an image that is stored at least 320 x 320 pixels to make sure itâs great quality on the desktop app and on the web.\n\nItâs also important to note that although the Instagram profile photo size is in square format, theyâre displayed as a circle so make sure you choose a great image (like a professional photo of yourself or a high-quality logo) and all the important elements are in the center of the image so nothing is cropped out.\n\nInstagram feed photos sizes\n\nInstagram feed photos are the type of content that is predominately shared on the platform from static posts to carousel posts. Hereâs a quick cheat sheet to nail your feed posts on Instagram.\n\nSquare posts: 1080 x 1080 pixels. 1:1 aspect ratio\n\nPortrait posts: 1080 x 1350 pixels. 4:5 aspect ratio\n\nLandscape posts: 1080 x 566 pixels. 1.91: 1 aspect ratio\n\nThumbnail images: 161 x 161 pixels\n\nHelpful tips:\n\nSquare posts are the traditional posts youâve seen on Instagram since the beginning and are the best-suited feed photo type to make sure nothing is cropped in the Instagram grid.\n\nInstagram supports an aspect ratio of anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5\n\nInstagram will automatically crop your photo to support their aspect ratio if your image is in a different ratio.\n\nIf you upload a photo with a resolution lower than 320 pixels, Instagram will size it up to 320 pixels.\n\nCarousel posts for landscape, portrait, and square posts are the same as a static Instagram photo size.\n\nInstagram stories photos sizes\n\nInstagram stories have become one of their most popular features and are a great way to connect with your audience beyond just sharing images. Theyâre an interactive content format that boosts engagement by allowing brands to run polls, share BTS content, ask questions, and more.\n\nInstagram storiesâ photo sizes are 1080 x 1920 pixels with an aspect ratio of 9:16.Â\n\nNot using the 9:16 ratio size can leave some sections of your story blank or you end up with unexpected cropping.\n\nInstagram Reels sizes\n\nSince Instagram has made a big push for video content in the last few years with the launch of Reels, itâs never been more essential to nail your Reels sizing.\n\nInstagram Reels sizes: 1080 x 1920 pixels (the same as Instagram stories).\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16.\n\nInstagram Reels cover photo: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nItâs important to note that Reels cover photos are cropped into a 1:1 image in your profile feed and 4:5 in the home feed.\n\nA helpful tip for getting the sizing right for your Reels (and Stories) videos is to not include text with important information at the very top or bottom of your video to make sure nothing is covered up by the caption.\n\nInstagram ads image sizes\n\nInstagram ads image sizes are the same as feed posts with landscape photos being 1080 x 566 pixels and square posts being 1080 x 1080 pixels.\n\nThe minimum width for Instagram ads is 320 pixels and the maximum width is 1080 pixels with supported aspect ratios ranging between 1.91:1 and 4:5.\n\nRecommended Facebook image sizes in 2024\n\nFacebook is the largest social media platform with over 3 billion monthly active users, and more than 200 million businesses and 7 million advertisers worldwide use Meta appsÂ to promote their businesses, products, and services.\n\nWith Facebookâs enormous audience reach, itâs important to nail your visual content with the right photo sizes to make sure your audience is always seeing high-quality content from your brand.\n\nFacebook profile picture sizes\n\nWhether youâre running a personal profile or a business profile, your profile picture can oftentimes be what people see first so itâs essential to get your brand logo image or profile photo right.\n\nFor computers: 176 x 176 pixels\n\nFor smartphones: 196 x 196 pixels\n\nJust like Instagram profile pictures, Facebook profile photos are displayed as a circle so remember to get the most important information in the very center so nothing is cropped out.\n\nFacebook cover photo sizes\n\nYour Facebook cover photo allows you to get a little creative and show off your brand personality and voice a little more because itâs far bigger than your profile photo. For the best image quality, these are the recommended image sizes.\n\nItâs the perfect placement to share a team photo, your latest product release or even a snapshot of the services you offer.\n\nFor desktop: 851 x 315 pixels\n\nFor smartphones: 640 x 360 pixelsÂ\n\nFor the best results upload your file as a JPG or PNG file less than 100KB and 851 pixels wide and 315 pixels tall. Itâs also important to note that the left-hand side of your cover photo will be covered slightly by your profile picture so keep the most important information in the center and right-hand side.\n\nFacebook timeline photo and post sizes\n\nFacebook timeline and post photos are the most commonly shared photos and will appear in your audienceâs news feeds.\n\nRecommended Facebook timeline photo size: 1200 x 630 pixels\n\nMinimum size: 600 x 315 pixels\n\nCarousel posts: 1200 x 1200 pixels\n\nFacebook event cover photo sizes\n\nFacebook events are a great way to build awareness for an in-person or virtual event like a Live Shopping event where you can showcase the date and time, event location, sponsors, and more.\n\nFacebook event cover photo size: 1200 x 628 pixels. About a 2:1 aspect ratio\n\nFacebook wonât allow you to change the event cover photo size once itâs been uploaded so make sure you stick to the recommended image sizes for the best results.\n\nFacebook Panorama/360 photos sizes\n\nA 360 image can be used by brands to give audiences a highly engaging and immersive experience with their advertisements and give an in-depth insight into the brandâs personality and voice.\n\n360 image sizes: 30,000 pixels in any dimension and less than 135,000,000 pixels in total size.\n\nAspect ratio: 2:1\n\nImage file size: For JPEG images, a maximum of 45MB (20-30 MB recommended) and 60MB for PNG images.\n\nFacebook Stories sizes\n\nFacebook stories are pretty similar to Instagram stories, taking up the full screen of your mobile phone. That means you should have all your important information towards the center of the screen so no elements are hard to view at the top and bottom of the screen.\n\nFacebook story size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nFacebook Ads\n\nThere are a bunch of different Facebook ad types from feed ads to story ads and right-column ads so itâs important to nail the right ad size for each type of format youâre going for.\n\nFacebook feed ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1 to 1:1. Maximum file size of 30MB.\n\nFacebook carousel ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio is 1:1. Maximum file size of 30MB.\n\nFacebook right-column ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1:1. Minimum size 254 x 133 pixels.\n\nFacebook sponsored message: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1 to 1:1. Maximum file size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook Messenger ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1 to 1:1. Maximum file size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook Messenger inbox ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1:1. Maximum file size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook Messenger stories ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 9:16.\n\nFacebook marketplace ads: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1:1. Maximum size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook search: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1 to 1:1. Maximum file size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook instant articles: At least 1080 x 1080 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1 to 1:1. Maximum file size of 30 MB.\n\nFacebook in-stream video ads: Highest resolution possible. Aspect ratio 9:16 to 16:9. Recommended video formats are MP4 and MOV. Maximum video file size of 4GB.\n\nLinkedIn image sizes\n\nLinkedIn is an essential platform for businesses and industry leaders to find professional networks and potential clients.\n\nAlthough images arenât the main focus of LinkedIn, with mainly text-based communication, when you do upload images theyâve got to be as high resolution as possible because you always want to put your best foot forward to potential clients and industry leaders on the platform.\n\nLinkedIn profile photo image size\n\nLinkedIn profile photos are recommended to be 400 x 400 pixels with an aspect ratio of 1:1 and file sizes can be up to 8MB to allow your company logo or profile photo to be as high-quality as possible.\n\nLinkedIn cover photo image size\n\nLinkedIn recommends cover photos be 1128 (w) x 191 (h) pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:1 and a file size of under 8MB. LinkedIn recommends uploading images as either JPEG or PNG for all file types.\n\nLinkedIn post image sizes\n\nLinkedInâs post image sizes differ depending on the content youâre putting out. For example, static posts will differ from story image sizes to article banner sizes. Hereâs a cheat sheet for your LinkedIn post image sizes:\n\nSquare image: 1080 x 1080 pixels\n\nPortrait image:1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nLandscape image:1200 x 627 pixels\n\nArticle featured image: 1200 x 644 pixels\n\nArticle banner image: 600 x 322 pixels\n\nVideo sizes: minimum 256 x 144 pixels to maximum 4096 x 2304 pixels\n\nVideo file size: 75KB to 5GB\n\nMaximum video length: 10 minutes from mobile, 15 from desktop\n\nLinkedIn Stories image size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nLinkedIn company page image sizes\n\nOn your LinkedIn company page, there is a bunch of visual content that appears from your large company logo to your smaller square logo, so itâs important to upload two versions of your logos so that people who are landing on your company page and searching for your company are seeing high-quality images.\n\nCompany logo size: 300 x 300 pixels\n\nSquare logo: 60 x 60 pixels\n\nPage cover image size: 1128 x 191 pixels\n\nLife tab main image size: 1128 x 376 pixels\n\nLife tab custom modules image size: 502 x 282 pixels\n\nLife tab company photos image sizes: 900 x 600 pixels\n\nLinkedIn shared image sizes\n\nIf youâre sharing links like blog posts with a link image, LinkedIn recommends uploading them at 1200 x 627 (recommended aspect ratio 191:1) with file types as either JPG, PNG, or GIFs.\n\nLinkedIn ads image sizes\n\nLike Facebook, LinkedIn has various ad sizes and ad formats, and running LinkedIn ads can drive traffic and boost engagement.\n\nCompany logo size for ads: 100 x 100 pixels\n\nSponsored content posts: 1200 x 627 pixels. Aspect ratio 1.91:1\n\nSpotlight ads custom background image: 300 x 250 pixels\n\nX/Twitter image sizes\n\nWhen people think of X (formerly Twitter), they tend to assume itâs mainly for text-based content. But, in reality, X has plenty of visual and video content on the platform, and postsÂ with visual content produce significantly more engagement than posts without an accompanying visual asset.\n\nSo, if youâre using X/Twitter for brand awareness, to drive sales, and boost engagement, nailing your X image sizes is essential to give your audience the best social media experience possible.\n\nX/Twitter profile photo image size\n\nLike with all profile photos, your X/Twitter profile photo is essential for boosting brand or personal recognition and constantly appears next to your in-feed Tweets. Twitter recommends these image sizes for profile photos:\n\nDimension: 400 by 400 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMaximum image size: 2 MB\n\nX/Twitter header/cover photo image size\n\nYour X/Twitter header photo can be used for free advertising and allows you to get more creative with your brandâs personality, giving people a deeper insight into who you are.\n\nKeep in mind that the lower left-hand side of your X/Twitter header is slightly blocked by your profile photo so keep your most important information in the center or the right-hand side of the header.\n\nX/Twitter recommends these image sizes for headers:\n\nDimension: 1500 by 500 pixelsÂ\n\nAspect ratio: 3:1\n\nMaximum image size: 5 MB\n\nX/Twitter in-stream image size\n\nIn-stream images on X/Twitter are the posts that appear in peopleâs feeds so these are super important to nail. Plus, X/Twitter automatically resizes in-stream images before showing them in the in-stream preview.\n\nTo avoid X/Twitter cropping out important parts of your images, use these recommended sizes:\n\nImage Dimension: Â 1600 x 900 Landscape, 1080 x 1080 Square,Â or 1080 x 1350 Portrait\n\nAspect ratio: For desktop use 2:1 or 1:1 and for mobile use 2:1, 3:4 or 16:9\n\nMaximum file size: 5 MB for photos and GIFS on a smartphone and 15MB on a desktop.\n\nSupported image formats: JPG, PNG, and GIF\n\nX/Twitter cards image size\n\nIf youâre sharing a link via X/Twitter, it automatically pulls a relevant image from the website which is then shown in the newsfeed and youâre redirected to the website if you click that image.\n\nKeep in mind that the X/Twitter card image size has to be correct for the image to display properly so make sure youâre following these image sizes:\n\nDimension: minimum size of 144 x 144 (or 300 x 157 pixels for a large card image) and maximum size of 4096 x 4096 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 2:1\n\nMaximum file size: 5MBÂ\n\nSupported image formats: JPG, PNG, WEBP, and GIF. Only the first frame of an animated GIF will be used.\n\nX/Twitter ads image sizes\n\nX/Twitter ad image sizes vary depending on the type of ad, whether youâre using website cards, carousels, direct message cards, and more.\n\nTwitterâs recommended image sizing for your X/Twitter ads:\n\nWebsite card: 800 x 418 pixels. 1.91:1 aspect ratio. Maximum file size of 20MB.\n\nApp card image: 800 x 800 pixels. 1:1 aspect ratio. Maximum file size of 3MB.\n\nCarousels: 800 x 418 pixels is recommended for 1.91:1 aspect ratio. 800 x 800 pixels is recommended for 1:1 aspect ratio.\n\nVideo Carousels: 800 x 450 pixels is recommended for 16:9 aspect ratio. 800 x 800 pixels is recommended for 1:1 aspect ratio.\n\nDirect Message card: 800 x 418 pixels. 1.91:1 aspect ratio. Maximum file size of 3MB.\n\nConversation card: 800 x 418 pixels. 1.91:1 aspect ratio. Maximum file size of 3MB.\n\nStandalone video ads: 1200 x 1200 pixels for a 1:1 aspect ratio. 1920 x 1080 pixels for a 16.9 aspect ratio.
