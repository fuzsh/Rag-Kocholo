The options available depend on the type of file.\n\nInsert a file, image, or video into your page\n\nImages and videos\n\nInserting a file or image into the page also adds it as an attachment.\n\nTo insert an image or video into a page while editing:\n\nDrag the file directly onto the page.\n\nSelect the Add image, video, or file button from the main toolbar.\n\nType /files or /images, select Image, video, or file.\n\nAfter an image or video is inserted, you can:\n\nResize it by dragging the handles on either side.\n\nSet its width or height in pixels by entering a value in the toolbar.\n\nWhen you select an uploaded image or video, a floating toolbar appears.\n\nYou can use this toolbar to:\n\nAdd a caption — Add more information about the image or video. The text size and alignment can't be changed, but you can apply other formatting.\n\nBorder options — Add borders and change their color and size.\n\nImage alignment — Determine how the image or video is aligned on the page and how the text should flow around your image or video.\n\nInline (images only) — Display the image or video within the text.\n\nOriginal size (images only) — Display the image as a separate block element.\n\nWidth and Height — Set the width or height of an image or video.\n\nAdd/view comment — Add or view comments on an image or video.\n\nLink (images only) — Add a link to a Confluence page or an external URL.\n\nPreview (images only) — Preview the image full size while editing.\n\nEdit alt text — Add supplemental text accompanying an image or video for all users. Alt text can help add more context and meaning to the image or video and can be very effective in assisting people of all types to understand the image or video better.\n\nFiles\n\nWhen you insert a file into a page, it will appear as an inline tile or a thumbnail. You can use the floating toolbar to control the following:\n\nChange view — Display the file inline or as a thumbnail.\n\nPreview — Open the file in viewer mode.\n\nDownload — Download the file to your computer or device.\n\nDelete files from your page\n\nYou can delete a file in a few ways when editing a page:\n\nSelect the icon in the floating toolbar for an image\n\nSelect the X icon or the Delete key when focused on a file\n\nIf you delete a file or image in the editor, the attached file isn't deleted.\n\nTo completely remove the file from a page:"
