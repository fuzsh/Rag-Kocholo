        "text": "Table of Content\n\nLogo sizes for social platforms\n\nLogo sizes for your website\n\nFavicon sizes for a website\n\nLogo sizes for print\n\nHow do I change the size of my logo?\n\nA logo is not a brand, but a brand without a logo certainly cannot create a memory in their customer's mind. A logo is a symbol that represents the company, the brand, the small business when it is in operation. You can create a logo by yourself using simple tool like Canva.\n\nIn this blog, we will cover the dimension of your logo and how you can effectively apply your logo to different design with different size across all major social media platforms, your website, and print.\n\n1. Logo sizes for social platforms\n\nFirst of all, letâs clear up why itâs so important to use the optimal logo size on your social media pages. If your emblem is smaller than the recommended size, itâll stretch and become grainy (i.e. illegible). If, on the contrary, your logo is too large, itâll be automatically compressed which will affect its quality in a negative way. Whichever the case, your customers will have trouble discerning what your corporate image is saying.\n\nâ\n\nHere are the image dimension that you should be aware of before you post anything on social media to optimize your user experience:\n\nFacebook:\n\nImage posts: 1200 x 630 px\n\nCover image: 820 Ñ 312 px\n\nProfile image: 170 Ñ 170 px\n\nInstagram:\n\nSquare image post: 1080 x 1080 px\n\nPortrait image post: 1080 x 1350 px\n\nProfile image: 110 x 110 px\n\nStories: 1080 x 1920 px\n\nReel: 1080 x 1920 px\n\nTwitter:\n\nImage posts: 1024 x 675 px\n\nCover image: 1500 Ñ 500 px\n\nProfile image: 400 x 400 px\n\nYouTube:\n\nThumbnail image: 1280 x 720 px\n\nCover image: 2560 x 1440 px\n\nProfile image: 800 x 800 px\n\nPinterest:\n\nImage posts: 1000 x 1500 px\n\nPin: 236 px width\n\nProfile image: 165 x 165 px\n\nLinkedIn:\n\nLink posts: 1200 Ñ 628 px\n\nImage posts: 1200 x 1200 px\n\nCover image: 1536 x 768 px\n\nProfile image: 300 Ñ 300 px\n\nTik Tok:\n\nProfile photo: 200 x 200 px\n\nVideo length: 1080 x 1920 px\n\n2. Logo sizes for your website\n\nMost of the time you will be using a transparent background logo (.PNG extension). For the most part, 250 px (width) x 100 px (height) are the optimal logo dimensions for a web page. We have listed a few logo dimensions for the two most common layouts.\n\nâ\n\nFor horizontal layout:\n\n250 px x 150 px\n\n350 px x 75 px\n\n400 px x 100 px\n\nFor vertical (square) layout:\n\n160 px x 160 px\n\n3. Favicon sizes for a website\n\nA favicon is a small icon that features your brand. It is a logo mark that will be displayed on the browser's tab. You can employ favicons in the following sizes:\n\n16 px x 16 px\n\n32 px x 32 px\n\n48 px x 48 px\n\nThe size is relatively small, however, you can always export a bigger dimension for better resolution. We often use 128 x 128 px for better resolution but not too big in size.\n\n4. Logo sizes for print\n\nWhen it comes to printing your corporate image across different surfaces, the main thing is not the size but the format of your logo. The best vector formats are PDF, SVG, and EPS. Why use vector and not raster? The reason is that a vector logo (both an entire image and its separate parts) is easy-to-edit. In addition, a vector logo retains its quality when scaled up multiple times, which is very important in printing.\n\nIf you have your emblem saved in a vector format, you donât need to worry which size to choose before taking your design to a printing office.\n\nIf youâre using a raster image (read here about the difference between the raster and vector formats), the bigger your image, the better.\n\nFor this reason, we recommend that you use a 500ÑÑ (or more) logo for small print (e.g., souvenirs) and a 1024px logo (or more) for large print.\n\n5. How do I change the size of my logo?\n\nYour logo represents your business and there are many different logo size you should know to make it fit to different platforms such as a website, social platforms, printed matter, etc.\n\nIf you don't know how to use Photoshop, you can try the online tool to edit the size of your logo such as LogoMaker or Canva. They are free and super easy to use."
