Recommended size is (300 x 184 pixels). Images that are not 300 x 184 pixels may be stretched, shrunk, or cropped to fit the width of the thumbnail. In addition, they must be added at the end of the project description and be enclosed in ! (exclamation marks), otherwise they will not be displayed as the thumbnail."
