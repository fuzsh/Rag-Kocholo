        "text": "Overview\n\nTo start configuring the monitor, complete the following:\n\nDefine the search query: Construct a query to count events, measure metrics, group by one or several dimensions, and more.\n\nSet alert conditions: Define alert and warning thresholds , evaluation time frames, and configure advanced alert options.\n\nConfigure notifications and automations: Write a custom notification title and message with variables. Choose how notifications are sent to your teams (email, Slack, or PagerDuty). Include workflow automations or cases in the alert notification.\n\nDefine permissions and audit notifications: Configure granular access controls and designate specific roles and users who can edit a monitor. Enable audit notifications to alert if a monitor is modified.\n\nDefine the search query\n\nTo learn how to construct the search query, see the individual monitor types pages. As you define the search query, the preview graph above the search fields updates.\n\nSet alert conditions\n\nThe alert conditions vary based on the monitor type. Configure monitors to trigger if the query value crosses a threshold, or if a certain number of consecutive checks failed.\n\nAdvanced alert conditions\n\nNo data\n\nNotifications for missing data are useful if you expect a metric to always be reporting data under normal circumstances. For example, if a host with the Agent must be up continuously, you can expect the system.cpu.idle metric to always report data.\n\nIn this case, you should enable notifications for missing data. The sections below explain how to accomplish this with each option.\n\nNote: The monitor must be able to evaluate data before alerting on missing data. For example, if you create a monitor for service:abc and data from that service is not reporting, the monitor does not send alerts.\n\nAuto resolve\n\n[Never], After 1 hour, After 2 hours and so on. automatically resolve this event from a triggered state.\n\nAuto-resolve works when data is no longer being submitted. Monitors do not auto-resolve from an ALERT or WARN state if data is still reporting. If data is still being submitted, the renotify feature can be utilized to let your team know when an issue is not resolved.\n\nFor some metrics that report periodically, it may make sense for triggered alerts to auto-resolve after a certain time period. For example, if you have a counter that reports only when an error is logged, the alert never resolves because the metric never reports 0 as the number of errors. In this case, set your alert to resolve after a certain time of inactivity on the metric. Note: If a monitor auto-resolves and the value of the query does not meet the recovery threshold at the next evaluation, the monitor triggers an alert again.\n\nIn most cases this setting is not useful because you only want an alert to resolve after it is actually fixed. So, in general, it makes sense to leave this as [Never] so alerts only resolve when the metric is above or below the set threshold.\n\nGroup retention time\n\nYou can drop the group from the monitor status after N hours of missing data. The length of time can be at minimum 1 hour, and at maximum 72 hours. For multi alert monitors, select Remove the non-reporting group after N (length of time).\n\nSimilar to the Auto-resolve option, the group retention works when data is no longer being submitted. This option controls how long the group is kept in the monitorâ€™s status once data stops reporting. By default, a group keeps the status for 24 hours before it is dropped. The start time of the group retention and the Auto-resolve option are identical as soon as the monitor query returns no data.\n\nSome use cases to define a group retention time include:\n\nWhen you would like to drop the group immediately or shortly after data stops reporting\n\nWhen you would like to keep the group in the status for as long as you usually take for troubleshooting\n\nNote: The group retention time option requires a multi alert monitor that supports the On missing data option. These monitor types are APM Trace Analytics, Audit Logs, CI Pipelines, Error Tracking, Events, Logs, and RUM monitors.\n\nNew group delay\n\nDelay the evaluation start by N seconds for new groups.\n\nThe time (in seconds) to wait before starting alerting, to allow newly created groups to boot and applications to fully start. This should be a non-negative integer.\n\nFor example, if you are using containerized architecture, setting a group delay prevents monitor groups scoped on containers from triggering due to high resource usage or high latency when a new container is created. The delay is applied to every new group (which has not been seen in the last 24 hours) and defaults to 60 seconds.\n\nThe option is available with multi alert mode.\n\nEvaluation delay\n\nDatadog recommends a 15-minute delay for cloud metrics, which are backfilled by service providers. Additionally, when using a division formula, a 60-second delay is helpful to ensure your monitor evaluates on complete values. See the Cloud Metric Delay page for estimated delay times.\n\nDelay evaluation by N seconds.\n\nThe time (in seconds) to delay evaluation. This should be a non-negative integer. So, if the delay is set to 900 seconds (15 minutes), the monitor evaluation is during the last 5 minutes, and the time is 7:00, the monitor evaluates data from 6:40 to 6:45. The maximum configurable evaluation delay is 86400 seconds (24 hours).\n\nConfigure notifications and automations\n\nConfigure your notification messages to include the information you are most interested in. Specify which teams to send these alerts to as well as which attributes to trigger alerts for.\n\nMessage\n\nUse this section to configure notifications to your team and configure how to send these alerts:\n\nConfigure your notification with Template Variables\n\nSend notifications to your team through email, Slack, or PagerDuty\n\nFor more information on the configuration options for the notification message, see Alerting Notifications.\n\nAdd metadata\n\nMonitor tags are independent of tags sent by the Agent or integrations. See the Manage Monitors documentation.\n\nUse the Tags dropdown to associate tags with your monitor.\n\nUse the Teams dropdown to associate teams with your monitor.\n\nChoose a Priority.\n\nSet alert aggregation\n\nAlerts are grouped automatically based on your selection of the group by step when defining your query. If the query has no grouping, it defaults to Simple Alert. If the query is grouped by any dimension, grouping changes to Multi Alert.\n\nSimple alert\n\nSimple Alert mode triggers a notification by aggregating over all reporting sources. You receive one alert when the aggregated value meets the set conditions. For example, you might set up a monitor to notify you if the average CPU usage of all servers exceeds a certain threshold. If that threshold is met, youâ€™ll receive a single notification, regardless of the number of individual servers that met the threshold. This can be useful for monitoring broad system trends or behaviors.\n\nMulti alert\n\nA Multi Alert monitor triggers individual notifications for each entity in a monitor that meets the alert threshold.\n\nFor example, when setting up a monitor to notify you if the P99 latency, aggregated by service, exceeds a certain threshold, you would receive a separate alert for each individual service whose P99 latency exceeded the alert threshold. This can be useful for identifying and addressing specific instances of system or application issues. It allows you to track problems on a more granular level.\n\nWhen monitoring a large group of entities, multi alerts can lead to noisy monitors. To mitigate this, customize which dimensions trigger alerts. This reduces the noise and allows you to focus on the alerts that matter most. For instance, you are monitoring the average CPU usage of all your hosts. If you group your query by service and host but only want alerts to be sent once for each service attribute meeting the threshold, remove the host attribute from your multi alert options and reduce the number of notifications that are sent.\n\nWhen aggregating notifications in Multi Alert mode, the dimensions that are not aggregated on become Sub Groups in the UI.\n\nNote: If your metric is only reporting by host with no service tag, it is not detected by the monitor. Metrics with both host and service tags are detected by the monitor.\n\nIf you configure tags or dimensions in your query, these values are available for every group evaluated in the multi alert to dynamically fill in notifications with useful context. See Attribute and tag variables to learn how to reference tag values in the notification message.\n\nPermissions\n\nAll users can view all monitors, regardless of the team or role they are associated with. By default, only users attached to roles with the Monitors Write permission can edit monitors. Datadog Admin Role and Datadog Standard Role have the Monitors Write permission by default. If your organization uses Custom Roles, other custom roles may have the Monitors Write permission. For more information on setting up RBAC for Monitors and migrating monitors from the locked setting to using role restrictions, see the guide on How to set up RBAC for Monitors.\n\nYou can further restrict your monitor by specifying a list of teams, roles, or users allowed to edit it. The monitorâ€™s creator has edit rights on the monitor by default. Editing includes any updates to the monitor configuration, deleting the monitor, and muting the monitor for any amount of time.\n\nNote: The limitations are applied both in the UI and API.\n\nGranular access controls\n\nUse granular access controls to limit the teams, roles, or users that can edit a monitor:\n\nWhile editing or configuring a monitor, find the Define permissions and audit notifications section.\n\nClick Edit Access.\n\nClick Restrict Access.\n\nThe dialog box updates to show that members of your organization have Viewer access by default.\n\nUse the dropdown to select one or more teams, roles, or users that may edit the monitor.\n\nClick Add.\n\nThe dialog box updates to show that the role you selected has the Editor permission.\n\nClick Done.\n\nNote: To maintain your edit access to the monitor, the system requires you to include at least one role or team that you are a member of before saving.\n\nTo restore general access to a monitor with restricted access, follow the steps below:\n\nWhile viewing a monitor, click the More dropdown menu.\n\nSelect Permissions.\n\nClick Restore Full Access.\n\nClick Save.\n\nFurther reading"
