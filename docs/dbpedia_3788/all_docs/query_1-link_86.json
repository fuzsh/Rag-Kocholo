        "text": "Alt text provides context for humans\n\nThere are many excellent reasons for investing the time in writing alt text for the images on your website, but the primary goal is to ensure that visitors with different abilities are being served well. Alt attributes enable screen readers to read the information about on-page images for the benefit of a person with visual impairments, low vision, different learning abilities, and for people who cannot otherwise view an image online.\n\nThe necessity of this becomes very apparent when you consider the following statistics shared by respected SEO conference speaker, Miracle Inameti-Archibong in a presentation at MozCon:\n\n12 million Internet users have a visual impairment or low vision\n\nPeople with a visual impairment or low vision consistently report having advanced internet proficiency.\n\nWorking-age people with disabilities cumulatively possess $490 billion in after-tax disposable income.\n\n83% of people with accessibility needs shop on sites with high accessibility standards, even if prices are higher.\n\n97.4% of homepages have accessibility errors.\n\nMissing alt text accounts for 61% of all homepage accessibility errors.\n\nIn 2021, there were 10 lawsuits per day in the US related to accessibility issues.\n\nPeople with a visual impairment, low vision, or different learning abilities are part of your audience, and like all Internet users, may turn to the web for vital needs such as managing finances, seeking medical help, navigating towns and cities, shopping, and countless day-to-day tasks. By investing in the implementation of alt text for all the most important images on your web site, you’ll be ensuring that no visitor is excluded from interacting with your organization. You’ll also be maximizing your potential for transactions and protecting your brand from litigation.\n\nAlt text provides context for image search\n\nAnother excellent reason is that it can help search engines like Google better understand and rank your photos in the image-based results which have become so prevalent.\n\nYou’ll see image packs show up in the search search when Google interprets the query to be best supported by visual accompaniment. Visual search makes it easier when you don't know what you're looking for or when you’re seeking visual guidance for inspiration or to refine your search further.\n\nWhile accessibility is the primary reason for including alt text, providing search engines with context clues is a close second. When optimizing for image search you should prioritize helping images to surface when users enter text based queries.\n\nTo do this, follow image SEO best practices like:\n\nModern file formats\n\nAlt text\n\nRelevant file names\n\nSchema markup\n\nIn recent years, Google has become remarkably good at “reading” image content with computer vision technology and algorithms. They can read text inside of images, like a logo on a wall at the back of a conference hall. They can identify multiple entities within images, such as a person vs. a lamp vs. a tree. In fact, they have become so skilled at this that you might wonder if you even need to write alt text at this point as part of your SEO. There’s a two part answer to this question:\n\nRemember that image recognition technology isn’t really seeing the same way as sighted people see. Alt text gives you the chance to fill in details about the elements in a photo that you want to emphasize.\n\nGoogle’s documentation states that they use both computer vision and alt text (as well as contextual page content) to understand imagery, as captured in this screenshot:\n\nOkay:\n\n<img src=\"pancakes.png\" alt=\"pancakes\">\n\nThis alt text is only \"okay\" because it's not very descriptive. Yes, this is an image of a stack of pancakes. But, there's more to be said about this image.\n\nGood:\n\n<img src=\"pancakes.png\" alt=\"Stack of blueberry pancakes with powdered sugar\">\n\nThis alt text is a better alternative because it is far more descriptive of what's in the image, while remaining concise. This isn't just a stack of \"pancakes\" (as the first alt text example demonstrated); it's a stack of blueberry pancakes with a dusting of powdered sugar!\n\nNot recommended:\n\n<img src=\"pancakes.png\" alt=\"\">\n\nor\n\n<img src=\"pancakes.png\" alt=\"pancake pancakes pan cake hotcakes hotcake breakfast food best breakfast top breakfasts breakfast recipes pancake recipe\">\n\nNeither of these last two examples are recommended. The first line of code actually doesn't contain any alt text at all (notice the quotes are empty), while the second example demonstrates keyword stuffing in alt text, which is a low quality and rather useless pursuit.\n\nIf you’re studying SEO, you will run into a lot of different opinions on what the right length is for alt text. You’ll see people suggesting keeping it to 100 characters, 120 characters, 140 characters, or to specific word counts like 16 words. It’s important to know that all of these figures are speculative. Google’s John Mueller has clarified:\n\n“...the important part here is we don’t have any guidelines with regards to how long your alt text can be. So from a Google Search point of view, you can put a lot of things in the alt text for an image, if that is relevant for that particular image.”\n\nBecause Google has no official guidelines on alt text length, it's an element that calls for common sense. Write alt text that briefly but thoroughly describes an image while being a great help, not a boring burden, to people using screen readers.\n\nAccording to Google’s John Mueller, alt text is an image search ranking factor. For general organic search, Google treats alt text like any other text on the page. Obviously, since the text on your page contributes to overall rankings, alt text will be part of that big picture, but it’s good to have this confirmation from a Google representative that your investment in alt text will be of greatest assistance to your image search ranking goals.\n\nAlong with implementing image title and file naming best practices, including alt text is critically important for computer surfers with a range of abilities. It also gives context clues to bots programmed to understand your website content.\n\nAlt text offers you another opportunity to include your target keyword. With on-page keyword usage still pulling weight as a search engine ranking factor, it's in your best interest to create alt text that both describes the image and, if possible, includes a keyword or keyword phrase you're targeting.\n\nAdditionally if traffic from image search is a key part of your SEO strategy then giving Google the right information about your images is a good way to communicate topic relevance. You can do this by correctly using modern file formats, alt text, relevant file names and schema markup\n\nSpecificity is Key: Alt text should form a clear mental image of what the content is. Describe the image as specifically as possible. If alt text forms a strong mental picture of image content, it’s likely doing its job.\n\nDecorative Images: Use CSS for purely decorative images, not HTML. If an image truly doesn't convey any meaning/value and is just there for design purposes, also known as decorative images, it should live within the CSS of your site, rather than your HTML.\n\nKeyword Integration: Incorporate relevant keywords from research in alt text for better search relevance.\n\nDo include the findings of your keyword research in your alt text. Use them to reflect the language people use when talking about and searching for an image like yours while providing a strong description of image content.\n\nAvoid Overstuffing: Keyword stuffing can detract from user experience and search engine perception and is burdensome to people who use screen readers and will not impress search engines.\n\nSkip Redundant Phrases: No need for “image of” or “picture of”; contextually specify for screenshots or video stills if necessary. It's already assumed that alt text is describing an image or picture. However, there may be some cases in which specifying the media type can help. For example, you might want to describe that an image is a screenshot of a technical dashboard, or a video still, or a capture of a social media post.\n\nComplex Images: For intricate visuals like maps or charts, follow W3C Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines.\n\nWhen images are complex (like maps, charts, diagrams, or infographics) follow the best practices outlined by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative .\n\nAlt Text for Buttons: Ensure image buttons like “submit” have descriptive alt text that explains their function. Don’t neglect to write alt text for form buttons. If a form on your website uses an image as its “submit” button, give it an alt attribute. Image buttons should have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button like \"search\", \"apply now\", “sign up”, etc\n\nFor website owners, success depends on welcoming visitors to an environment that really works for them. Web accessibility standards, including the creation of alt text, ensure that your welcome is more inclusive. Investing the time in writing helpful, optimized alt text is both a good business practice and the right thing to do."
