        "text": "Open Graph in short\n\nOpen Graph gives you full control over how your content looks when it's shared on social media platforms. By adding Open Graph markup code to your HTML, you can easily set an appealing visual, title and description.\n\nOpen Graph helps you make your content look better, leading to a higher click-through-rate.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is Open Graph?\n\nThe Open Graph Protocol, or \"Open Graph\" for short, is structured markup that you can add to your HTML documents to explain your content's context and gain control of the snippets that are shown when your URLs are shared through social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and apps like Slack, WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nHere's an example of KLM taking control of how their blog post is shown on Facebook, using Open Graph:\n\nWhy you should care about Open Graph\n\nHaving an appealing image that catches attention, and a great title and description to entice people to click on your snippet, is a game changer if you're looking to leverage social-media traffic.\n\nOpen Graph markup lets you gain control over how your URLs' snippets are shown on social media. In SEO we're obsessed with optimizing our titles and meta descriptions to get the highest possible click-through rate (CTR), but when it comes to social media, this is often forgotten. That's a shame, because the battle for attention on social media is just as fierce.\n\nDoes Open Graph increase my rankingsRankings\n\nRankings in SEO refers to a website’s position in the search engine results page.\n\nLearn more?\n\nNo, Open Graph does not directly increase your rankings. We do think, though, that Open Graph helps search engines determine the context of your content, similar to Schema.org. So in a way, your SEO performance does benefit from Open Graph.\n\nAs we pointed out in the previous section, if you want to drive more traffic from social media, it's highly recommended that you implement Open Graph.\n\nAfter all, it doesn't cost much extra time to also fill in an Open Graph title, description, and image when you're fine-tuning your title and meta descriptionMeta Description\n\nThe meta description is one of a web page’s meta tags. With this meta information, webmasters can briefly sketch out the content and quality of a web page.\n\nLearn more.\n\nDon’t miss out on potential traffic\n\nBe alerted to any Open Graph issues in real-time. With 24/7 monitoring, ContentKing detects issues and alerts you in real-time.\n\nWhat platforms support Open Graph\n\nThe obvious one is Facebook, as they're Open Graph's developer.\n\nOpen Graph is also supported by at least these platforms:\n\nLinkedIn\n\nSlack\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTelegram\n\nPlease note that Twitter has developed their own version, called 'Twitter Cards'. But if there are no Twitter Cards present, they fall back to Open Graph to generate snippets for URLs.\n\nHow to implement Open Graph\n\nOpen Graph implementation is done by adding Open Graph markup to your HTML documents, in the <head> section of your pages. You can do this manually, or if your website's driven by a CMS, it's likely there's functionality or plugins available for this job. If not, go talk to your developers. It's not hard to build functionality for this.\n\nThere are four required Open Graph properties:\n\nog:url\n\nog:title\n\nog:description\n\nog:image\n\nThere are also two recommended properties; use these to provide even more context about the content:\n\nog:type\n\nog:locale\n\nLet's look at an Open Graph example\n\nOur Schema.org article looks like this when it's shared on Facebook:\n\nWhen we pull up the source code, this is what the Open Graph implementation looks like:\n\nog:locale\n\nThe og:locale property describes the locale that the page is targeting. In this case it's the default value, en_US. You could say that og:locale is similar to the hreflang attribute in SEO in its intended use—targeting an audience.\n\nIf you have the content available for other locales, you can define alternative versions using og:locale:alternate.\n\nExample code snippet\n\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nThe value used consists of a two-letter language code, an underscore, and then a two-letter country code.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nIf the og:locale is not filled in or defined, it defaults to en_US.\n\nMore info on og:locale\n\nFacebook for Developers documentation.\n\nog:type\n\nThe og:type property describes the type of content—in this case article. This tag influences how your page shows up Facebook's feed. There are many types to choose from, such as for example: product, book, place, profile, and video.movie. The og:type is comparable to Schema types.\n\nExample code snippet\n\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nOnly one type can be defined per page.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nIf you don't define the og:type, it defaults to website.\n\nMore info on og:types\n\nFacebook for Developers documentation.\n\nog:title\n\nThe og:title property stands for Open Graph title, which states the title of a page. The og:title is similar to the <title> tag in SEO.\n\nExample code snippet\n\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Structured dataStructured Data\n\nStructured data is the term used to describe schema markup on websites. With the help of this code, search engines can understand the content of URLs more easily, resulting in enhanced results in the search engine results page known as rich results. Typical examples of this are ratings, events and much more. The Searchmetrics glossary below contains everything you need to know about structured data.\n\nLearn more using Schema.org: the Ultimate Guide\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nThe title shouldn't include any branding. It should describe your content's title. Furthermore, keep these things in mind when optimizing your snippet for Facebook:\n\nYour title will not fit on one line if it's longer than 55–60 characters.\n\nYour og:description will not show if your title is spread across two lines.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nSocial media platforms will use your <title> tag or your twitter:title as a fallback.\n\nog:description\n\nThe og:description stands for the Open Graph description. It's a short description what the page is about, similar to the meta description.\n\nExample code snippet\n\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Get more clicks and outsmart your competitors with Schema.org!\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nWhen optimizing your snippet for Facebook, keep in mind that the description will not fit on one line if it's longer than 55–60 characters.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nSocial media platforms will use your meta description or your twitter:description as a fallback.\n\nog:url\n\nThe og:url property describes the canonical version of the URL, meaning: the version without parameters.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"https://www.contentkingapp.com/academy/schema/\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nIt's essential that you define the canonical version of the URL here, as Likes and Shares are attributed to this URL instead of the non-canonical version.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nYour Open Graph implementation will not pass validation, as this is a required property.\n\nog:site_name\n\nThe og:site_name property describes the website's name—but it is no longer a supported property.\n\nExample code snippet\n\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Real-time SEO Auditing and Content Tracking\" />\n\narticle:section\n\nThe article:section property is a property of the og:type, which describes which part of your website this page belongs to. In our case, the article:section is the category that our Academy articles are in.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\n<meta property=\"article:section\" content=\"Structured Data\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nNone.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nSocial media platforms won't be able to understand what section of your website this page belongs to.\n\nMore info on article:section\n\nFacebook for Developers documentation.\n\nDo you have control over your social media posts?\n\nRun a quick check with ContentKing to see what can be improved.\n\nog:image\n\nThe og:image property defines the image that should be shown in your snippet. Make sure to carefully select these images, because size, quality, and dimensions do matter.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"https://www.contentkingapp.com/media/social-cards/[email protected]\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nWhen it comes to og:image, keep the following requirements in mind:\n\nIf you want a large-sized image to be shown in your snippet, make sure it has at least 600 x 315 pixels—but ideally at least 1,200 x 630 pixels for use on screens with a high pixel density (such as Apple's Retina screens).\n\nIf an image smaller than 600 x 315 is defined, you'll see that your snippet contains a smaller image too.\n\nThe absolute minimum image size is 200 x 20 pixels. Smaller images won't pass validation.\n\nThe maximum supported file size is 8 MB per image.\n\nTo make sure that your images don't get cropped, stick to a 1.91:1 aspect ratio.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nYour Open Graph implementation won't validate, and social media platforms will search through your page looking for an image to show. There's a strong chance that this will look… not great, as we've seen that there are quite strict requirements around images.\n\nOptional extra fields for og:image\n\nThere are optional, extra fields available for the og:image that can provide more information about the image:\n\nog:image:url: this is an alternative to og:image\n\nog:image:width and og:image:height: specifies the width and height of the image, enabling the image to load properly right when it's first shared.\n\nog:image:type: lets you define the image type. Values supported:\n\nimage/jpeg\n\nimage/gif\n\nimage/png\n\nog:image:secure_url\n\nThe og:image:secure_url defines the HTTPS version of the og:image.\n\nExample code snippet:\n\n<meta property=\"og:image:secure_url\" content=\"https://www.contentkingapp.com/media/social-cards/[email protected]\" />\n\nRequirements\n\nThe image URL needs to be served over HTTPS.\n\nWhat happens if you don't define it\n\nIt's unclear what happens then.\n\nOther Open Graph properties\n\nThere are many more Open Graph properties available. Here are a few worth mentioning:\n\nog:video: used to specify a video. See the Facebook for developer documentation for more information on this.\n\nog:updated_time: states when the page was last updated.\n\nog:ttl: states the number of seconds before the page may be re-scraped by Facebook. This is a way to rate-limit Facebook's crawlersCrawlers\n\nA crawler is a program used by search engines to collect data from the internet.\n\nLearn more.\n\nYou can use Facebook's Open Graph debugger to validate your Open Graph implementation.\n\nHowever, this only lets you check one URL at a time, so it makes sense to have a scalable solution in place for checking pages in bulk. That's where ContentKing comes in: it lets you audit your Open Graph implementation across your entire website, in real time:\n\nBest practices for Open Graph\n\nKeep in mind the following best practices when dealing with Open Graph:\n\nMake sure that you define at least all the required Open Graph properties—but ideally the recommended ones as well.\n\nKeep your og:title under 55-60 characters.\n\nKeep your og:description under 60-65 characters.\n\nFor og:image, use high-quality images with dimensions of at least 1,200 x 630 pixels, while keeping the file size under 8 MB.\n\nWhen you're preparing the Open Graph markup for a page, always run it through the Open Graph debugger to preview your snippet, and to make sure all data is filled in. Tweak and tune it until you get it right. An added benefit is that you'll pre-cache the snippet too, meaning that your snippet will already be shown correctly the first time it's shared.\n\nIf you've made any mistakes, you've fixed them, and you want Facebook to generate a new snippet: go to the Open Graph debugger and click \"Fetch new scrape information\". This refreshes the cache. However, it doesn't automatically refresh the image as well—for that you need to define a new og:image URL and only then request \"Fetch new scrape information.\"\n\nUse og:image:width and og:image:height to enable Facebook, etc. to load the image properly right after it's first shared.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nOpen Graph can make or break your success on social media. It doesn't just apply to URLs you share on social media yourselves, its impact multiplies when others share your content.\n\nHaving control over the appearance of your snippets is crucial. Among others, it allows you to test what visuals, titles, and descriptions resonate most with your audience.\n\nAt the end of the day, setting up Open Graph properly brings you more valuable traffic and increases your click-through-rate!"
