        "text": "The need to have a strong social media presence has grown over recent years, especially when it comes to visual content dominating much of the social media landscape that we know of in today's age. With this, however, comes optimizing your brand and personal profiles with high-quality content.\n\nSo, whether you design your social media images through applications like Canva or PhotoShop, use free stock photos or take your own photos using a camera, social media images are key to engaging with your audience, getting your brand message across and ultimately standing out visually.\n\nFrom profile pictures, X/Twitter headers, to cover photos and thumbnails, it has become important for brands and people to effectively convey themselves through the use of good quality images. No two platforms are the same though, so when it comes to using images across different platforms, here is your ultimate guide to social media picture sizes for 2024 with the specific dimensions and tips to help you choose the right image to boost your social media management strategy.\n\nLooking for social media video sizes in 2024? This way!\n\nThe following social media channels will be covered:\n\nFacebook Image Sizes for 2024\n\nLinkedIn Image Sizes for 2024\n\nTwitter Image Sizes for 2024\n\nYouTube Image Sizes for 2024\n\nInstagram Image Sizes for 2024\n\nPinterest Image Sizes for 2024\n\nFacebook Image Sizes for 2024\n\nAs the world's largest social media platform, Facebook is a channel where you can reach and engage large audiences if you are sharing high-quality, relevant content.\n\nHowever, before you share anything, you need to verify the image sizes on Facebook to make sure that the aspect ratio is correct and you're optimizing for viewing across multiple devices.\n\nHead to our blog to see the full list of Facebook image sizes, including how you should be sizing your ads!\n\nFacebook Business Page Profile Photo size: 360x360 pixels\n\nFacebook Cover Photo Image size: 820x312 pixels\n\nFacebook Shared Image size: 1200x630 pixels\n\nFacebook Shared Link Image size: 1200x628 pixels\n\nFacebook Event Image size: 1920x1080 pixels\n\nFacebook Stories Image Size: 1080 x 1920 pixels\n\nLinkedIn Image Sizes for 2024\n\nAs the world's largest professional social media network (with over 700 million users), LinkedIn has become a great platform to not only find jobs and employment but to connect with thought leaders, gain expert insights and create B2B Marketing campaigns. If you don't have the time or resources to create your own images for LinkedIn, use stock photography sites, like Unsplash, to get free social media images that you can use as part of your B2B content marketing strategy.\n\nLinkedIn Personal Profile Photo size\n\nPersonal Profile Photo: 400x400 pixels\n\nThis is the main image that represents you on your personal LinkedIn account so whenever someone is viewing your profile, this is one of the first images they will see so you want to get this one right.\n\nIt is recommended to have a profile picture at least 300x300, ideally 400x400 px.\n\nThe maximum file size is 10MB.\n\nPersonal image types are limited to JPG, GIF or PNG.\n\nLinkedIn Personal Background Image size\n\nPersonal Background Image: 1,584x396 pixels\n\nSimilar to the cover photo that appears behind your profile picture on your Facebook feed, this personal background or header image will also appear behind your personal profile image.\n\nThe recommended background image size is 1584x396 px.\n\nThe maximum file size is 4MB.\n\nPersonal background image types are limited to JPG, PNG or GIF.\n\nLinkedIn Shared Image or Link Image size\n\nShared Image or Link: 1,200x627 pixels\n\nThis image resolution works for LinkedIn posts that share a photo or contain a link to a blog post or news article that has a photo.\n\nThe recommended size for images or links is 1,200x627 px.\n\nThis image or link will appear at 552x289 px.\n\nShared image or link photo types are limited to PNG, JPG or GIF.\n\nLinkedIn Company Profile Photo size\n\nCompany Profile Photo: 300x300 pixels\n\nThis image will appear right next to your company or brand name on your LinkedIn homepage. This image also appears in the “Companies you may want to follow” section, so the more enticing and high quality this image is, the better to attract audiences to your page.\n\nThe recommended image size is 300x300 px.\n\nThe minimum image size is 300x300 px.\n\nThe maximum file size is 4MB (Square layout).\n\nCompany profile image types are limited to PNG, JPG or GIF.\n\nLinkedIn Company Page Cover Image size\n\nCompany Cover Image: 1,128x191 pixels\n\nThis image differs from your personal profile company photo because company covers will take up the entire top space of the page. The cover, or header image, will appear larger than the personal dimensions, which gives companies a bit more space to showcase themselves.\n\nThe recommended image size is 1,128x191 px.\n\nThe maximum file size is 4MB.\n\nCompany cover image types are PNG, JPG or GIF\n\nLinkedIn Company Page Hero Image size\n\nHero Image: 1,128x376 pixels\n\nThis photo is where you can provide a more in-depth look at the day-to-day experiences of your company’s employees. The hero photo also sits as a banner at the top of your company page and is usually larger than other LinkedIn photos.\n\nThe minimum image size is 1,128x376 px.\n\nThe maximum file size is 2MB.\n\nUsually set to a landscape layout\n\nImage file types are limited to PNG, JPG or GIF.\n\nLinkedIn Square Logo Image size\n\nSquare Logo: 60x60 pixels\n\nThis is the company or brand image that appears when you are being searched, and because it is so smaller in photo size, you want to make sure that the photo you use is still recognizable and eye-catching to your audience or potential job candidates.\n\nThe image size is 60x60 px (which is resized to fit).\n\nThe maximum file size is 2MB.\n\nImage file types are limited to PNG, JPG or GIF.\n\nLinkedIn Business Page Banner Image size\n\nBusiness Banner Image: 646x220 pixels\n\nThese types of images are more prominent to use because they appear whenever a user visits your company or brand page.
