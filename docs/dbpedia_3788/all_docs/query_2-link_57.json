        "text": "Files can be displayed on a page as a thumbnail or as a link. There are a few different ways to Upload Files.\n\nYou can control how the file appears on your page. The options available depend on the type of file.\n\nInsert a file into your page\n\nThere's a few ways to insert a file into your page:\n\nGo to Insert > Files on the editor toolbar and select any of the previously uploaded files, or\n\nDrag the file directly into the editor (this will upload and insert the file in one step), or\n\nType ! and choose an attached file from the autocomplete drop down.\n\nYour file will appear on your page as a thumbnail. Click the thumbnail to resize it or to switch to showing the file as a link.\n\nOn this page:\n\nRelated pages:\n\nLinks\n\nManage Files\n\nEdit Files\n\nInsert a file attached to another page\n\nYou can display a file that's attached to a different page of the same Confluence site, if you know the name of the file.\n\nTo display an image attached to a different page:\n\nGo to Insert > Files and choose the Search on other pages.\n\nEnter the name of the file.\n\nChoose whether to search the current space or All Spaces and choose Search.\n\nSelect the file from the search results and choose Insert.\n\nInsert an image file from the web\n\nYou can display an image from a remote web page on your Confluence page, without needing to attach it to your page. You need to know the URL for the image, not for the web page it appears on. This is only available for image files, not other types of files (like documents).\n\nTo display an image from a web page:\n\nWhile editing the page, position the cursor where you want to place the image.\n\nChoose Insert > Files and choose Images from the web.\n\nEnter a URL for the image. (example: http://atlassian.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/AtlassianBushRegeneration-12January2012-083-trunc.jpg\n\nChoose Preview to check that the URL and image are correct.\n\nChoose Insert.\n\nDelete files from your page\n\nIf you delete a file or image in the editor, the attached file will not be deleted. Go to\n\n> Attachments to delete the attachment completely from the page.\n\nSeeing an 'unknown attachment' placeholder on your page? This means that the attached file has been deleted from the page (or another page).\n\nPreview a file\n\nClick an image, file thumbnail or link when viewing a page to launch the preview.\n\nThe preview includes images from the web that are displayed on the page and files that are attached to the page (even if they are not currently displayed on the page).\n\nIn the preview you can:\n\ndownload the image file\n\nupload a new version of the file (attached files only)\n\ncomment on the file\n\nchoose to edit the file with a desktop application\n\nzoom in, out or fit the image to the width of your browser\n\nbrowse like a slideshow using the next and back buttons\n\nsee other files attached to the page and select a thumbnail to preview that file\n\nswitch to a full screen presentation mode\n\nSeveral file types can be previewed, including Office files, PDFs and many image types.\n\nSee more files: see other files also attached to this page.\n\nManage this file: download the file, upload a new version or share with your team.\n\nAdd a comment: drag the pin to comment on the file.\n\nOffice and PDF files\n\nInserting a file in a page is a great way to make useful documents, spreadsheets, presentations and other files available to your team.\n\nAs with all file types, you can choose to insert the file as a link, or as a thumbnail. The thumbnail shows a preview of the document's contents, and can be resized.\n\nTo view an Office or PDF file, click the link or thumbnail to see the full preview (no need to have Excel, Word or PowerPoint installed). Alternatively, use the Download button in the preview to download the file and view offline.\n\nYou can even edit and comment on Office and PDF files.\n\nCustomize your image file display\n\nWhen editing the page, select an image to show the image properties panel. The panel allows you to set the display size, add a border, and effects, link the image to other pages, and provide a caption.\n\nFrom the image properties panel you can:\n\nenter a width for the image (between 16px and 900px)\n\nset a preset size for the image\n\nadd a border around the image\n\nadd a link to the image\n\nadd effects to the image such as drop shadow or snapshot (go to Properties > Effects)\n\nprovide alt text used by screen readers and when the image can't be shown (go to Properties > Description)\n\ngive the image a caption by typing it into the caption field (also available in Properties > Description)\n\nIn the editor, image captions are indicated by a label icon and grey strip below the image.\n\nWhen viewing a page, image captions are displayed.\n\nTo add a caption to an image using the Instant Camera effect:\n\nSelect Effects in the image properties panel and choose the Instant Camera image effect.\n\nSave the page.\n\nGo to\n\nMore options\n\n> Attachments to go to the 'Attachments' view of the page.\n\nChoose Properties next to the image file.\n\nAdd a comment to the attachment. The text in your comment will appear as the image caption.\n\nYou'll need to re-enter the comment each time you upload a new version of the image.\n\nNote: The Instant Camera effect only works with Latin character languages, due to a lack of handwriting style fonts in multi-byte languages.\n\nA note on using Image Effects\n\nDisplaying image effects can be resource intensive. Confluence will prevent users from applying an image effect if the image is very large (based on data size and dimensions in pixels).\n\nConfluence also limits the threads that are dedicated to displaying image effects so that it does not impact your whole instance. If a thread is not available, Confluence will display the image without the effect. See Image effects are not displayed in Confluence 5.5 or later if you need to adjust the number of threads.\n\nResize an image through dragging\n\nYou can resize an image by dragging one of the handles that will appear on either side of the image when you select it. This is a more visual alternative to using the options available in the image properties panel.\n\nClick on an image to select it.\n\nHover your mouse on the right border of the image to display the drag handle (a vertical line)\n\nHold down your mouse and move it to the left to enlarge your image, or to the right to make it smaller.\n\nThe width and height will remain in proportion to each other.\n\nClick away from the image to confirm the new size.\n\nWrap text around an image\n\nYou can change the way text appears around an image via the editor toolbar at the top of your screen.\n\nSelect the image.\n\nUse the left and right align buttons in the editor toolbar to text wrap around the image.\n\nDouble click on the same align button to remove text alignment (this will align the image without text wrap).\n\nSave your page.\n\nMultimedia files\n\nThe file preview also supports MP3 audio and MP4 video files. It uses HTML5 to play attached audio and video files. This means the file types people can play in the preview depends on the audio and video formats their browser supports.\n\nYou can also display a wider range of multimedia files (video, audio and animation) using the Multimedia Macro.\n\nDisplay online video (such as YouTube or Vimeo videos) using the Widget Connector Macro.\n\nShow a list of files on a page\n\nThere are several ways you can display a list of files on a page. You can:\n\nUse the Attachments Macro to show files attached to the current page.\n\nUse the Space Attachments Macro to show all files in a space.\n\nUse the Gallery Macro to show thumbnails of images attached to a page."
