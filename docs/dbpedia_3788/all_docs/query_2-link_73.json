        "text": "Photo Gallery\n\nThe NASA Orbital Debris Program Office has gathered pictures and graphics that are found here in the photo gallery section and throughout the site. These pictures are considered open to the public and may be freely viewed or downloaded, unless they are included with permission of the copyright owner, and so noted. The pictures and graphics provide a visual insight into the depth of orbital debris research.\n\nClick on the small thumbnail image to view it in its full size. To download an image, right click on the desired image and select Save Picture As... from the menu option of your browser.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe following graphics are computer generated images of objects in Earth orbit that are currently being tracked. Approximately 95% of the objects in this illustration are orbital debris, i.e., not functional satellites. The dots represent the current location of each item.\n\nThe orbital debris dots are scaled according to the image size of the graphic to optimize their visibility and are not scaled to Earth. These images provide a good visualization of where the greatest orbital debris populations exist.\n\nBelow are the graphics generated from different observation points, as of January 1, 2019. Choose from small, medium, large, and extra large file sizes. To see the debris in motion, check out our video:\n\nLEO stands for low Earth orbit and is the region of space within 2,000 km of the Earth's surface. It is the most concentrated area for orbital debris. Credit: NASA ODPO.\n\nThe GEO images are images generated from a distant oblique vantage point to provide a good view of the object population in the geosynchronous region (~35,785 km altitude). Credit: NASA ODPO.\n\nThe GEO Polar images are generated from a vantage point above the north pole, showing the concentrations of objects in LEO and in the geosynchronous region.

This phased array radar can detect and track objects as small as 5 cm and is a contributing sensor to the U.S. satellite catalog. Credit: AFRL.\n\n70-m Goldstone antenna located near Barstow, CA. When operated as a bi-static radar, Goldstone is capable of detecting 2 mm debris at altitudes below 1,000 km.

Credit: NASA ODPO.\n\nHaystack and HAX radars located in Tyngsboro, MA. These radars collect 600 hrs of orbital debris data each per year. They are NASA's primary source of data on centimeter sized orbital debris.
