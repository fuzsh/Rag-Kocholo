        "text": "Listing products on eBay is an important sales strategy for many online retailers. After all, eBay is the 38th most popular website in the world. It is the sixth most popular in both the UK and Germany.\n\nWith over 185 million users worldwide, eBay is an online marketplace with huge opportunity for global sales.\n\nPartly as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, over 2020, the gross value of eBay goods sold grew 22.1% to $37.53 billion. In many ways, there has never been a better time to sell on eBay.\n\nHowever, with more competition than ever before on the platform, without the right eBay images, your products are likely to get lost.\n\nAnd without adhering to eBay’s strict image requirements, your listings might never get approved in the first place… Even something as simple as eBay image size can be fundamental to your success on the platform.\n\nThe quality of your data feed is what will determine success and one of the most important parts of your data feed is how well you optimise your eBay images.\n\nIn this guide, we’re going to explain everything you need to know when creating and uploading your eBay images.\n\nAdhere To eBay Image Policy\n\nTo ensure good user experience, eBay have implemented a number of image requirements. To get your listings approved and your products seen, you need to ensure that your eBay images meet eBay guidelines and image policy.\n\neBay Image Policy\n\nEBay Image Policy ensures that all images used belong to the person using them. Current eBay Image Policy rules are:\n\n1. All images must comply with eBay image size rules and technical requirements (more about these requirements in the next section).\n\n2. You must have rights to use the image and the image cannot infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third-party.\n\n3. You must include a minimum of one image per product. The maximum number of free images you can have is 12, but we talk about how to add more than 12 photos to ebay listing later in the article.\n\n4. The images must be of the product and they must show a real representation of that product. To meet eBay Image Policy, make sure you don’t crop out any key details.\n\n5.The images should not show anything other than the product that is in the listing and should not include:\n\nborders,\n\nsuperimposed logos,\n\nbarcodes or copyright marks.\n\nSome users’ eBay feeds are filled with placeholder images that convey messages - for example, that an item is out of stock. However, this is banned in eBay Image Policy so including information on delivery, item condition, and other seller information within an eBay image is not advised.\n\neBay watermark policy dictates that watermarks of any type are not allowed.\n\n6.You should only use stock photos for items that are new or in impeccable condition. We talk more about using stock photos on eBay later in the article.\n\nPrimary Image eBay Guidelines\n\nThere are slightly different rules to follow when it comes to primary eBay images and general eBay image guidelines. Primary images should:\n\nShowcase only the product and nothing else.\n\nShow as many details of the product as possible.\n\nNot include a box or packaging, unless the detail on the packaging is essential.\n\nBundles: eBay Image Guidelines\n\nBundles can be a great way to drive sales on eBay. However, eBay image guidelines dictate that images of bundles should show all products included and not include seller details such as how many bundles are on offer.\n\nThe technical requirements for eBay product images include\n\nTake Note Of Technical Requirements:\n\nThe minimum size for images on eBay is 500x500 pixels;\n\nThe maximum image size is 9,000 x 9,000 pixels;\n\nThe maximum file size is 12MB;\n\nDon't scale up thumbnail images to the required size as they will look pixelated and distorted;\n\nImages must be in one of the following formats: PNG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, or GIF;\n\nIf the photo is a JPEG, it should be 90 or higher on the JPEG quality scale.\n\neBay Image Size Requirements 2021\n\nWhile general eBay image size guidelines dictate that images should be a minimum size of 500x500 pixels and a maximum of 9,000 x 9,000 pixels, the best size for eBay photos will differ slightly depending where on the page it will be included.\n\nThe best size for eBay photos is that which facilitates quick page load times. The best eBay image sizes are as follows:\n\nImages in eBay descriptions should be no larger than 480 pixels wide. To learn how to add pictures to ebay descriptions, read this section.\n\nProfile images should be 150 x 150 pixels.\n\nWhen it comes to eBay cover photo size, dimensions are 1200 x 700 pixels\n\nThe best size for eBay product photos is 800-1600 pixels on one side. This allows users to use the zoom in function to see product details.\n\nHow To Resize Pictures For eBay\n\nYou can use an eBay picture size tool to resize pictures for eBay, but it’s important to remember that the more compression you put into an image, the less sharp it’ll appear.\n\nFor this reason, minimal resizing is advised. You should try to attain the best size for image photos upon photo upload.\n\nIf you do need to resize pictures for eBay, however, a great eBay picture size tool can be found here.\n\neBay Images Set Up\n\nBeyond eBay watermark policy and eBay image guidelines, there are a few less talked about but equally important things to bear in mind when setting up to take photos for eBay.\n\nIf you are taking photos for eBay that include clothes or jewelry, be careful to avoid nudity.\n\nYou can only include people or body parts where necessary- for example, when selling watches or wearable tech.\n\nDo not include props. Keep your images clear and don’t include distracting items.\n\nSet up a white background and use natural lighting so as to avoid reflections and hot spots.\n\nHow To Take Pictures For eBay With White Background\n\nThe answer to the question of how to take pictures for eBay with a white background is a lot simpler than it first may appear. Most of us will have a white or cream background at home, but if not a screen can be ordered cheaply online.\n\nLamps or camera lighting should be used as a backlight to ensure that there are no product shadows. Whilst it is not necessary to edit eBay photos, the results can be touched up simply using iPhone or desktop software and increasing exposure.\n\nHow To Take eBay Pictures- The Quality Requirements\n\nWhen you start actually taking photos for eBay, be sure to consider the quality requirements; these are:\n\n1. You cannot use placeholder images.\n\n2. Images should have a white or light grey background. This means you should not include images that have black backgrounds or backgrounds of any other colour.\n\n3. One of the images should be a primary image – this is the first image on your listing. This should be a front view of the product, either straight on or at a slight angle. It should also be an image that is as close-up to the product as possible. This ensures maximum visibility of the product's details. On listings for multipacks, the primary image must clearly show the main product.\n\n4. While primary images must be of the front of the product, secondary images can show the product from different angles.\n\n5. You can use images that include two representations of the product. When you do so, it must be clear that both representations are of the same product with each representation being different. For example, showing the product from the front and the back in the same image is okay, but simply having two mirrored representations of the product on the one image is not.\n\n6. You can crop images, so long as the cropping does not remove important product details.\n\nHow To Take Good eBay Photos\n\nThere is a difference between the question of how to take eBay pictures and that of how to take good eBay pictures. To fully optimise the images on your eBay listings, use the following tips:\n\nMake sure you clean the product before you take a photo\n\nMake sure you set the camera to the highest resolution possible\n\nMake sure the product fills the frame of the image as much as possible\n\neBay images should be taken from multiple angles;\n\nDon't use filters as natural colours are better at showing the buyer what they can expect.\n\nTake a variety of images for each product listing, including close-ups\n\nKeep your image style consistent to build a brand\n\nBuy a tripod for extra stability\n\nAnother important thing to remember when optimising eBay images relates to changing or updating images.\n\nTo add product images to your eBay data feed, you will need to upload them to a location on the internet. Often, this is the location of the image on your own website.\n\nWhen you want to update an image, however, you will need to upload the updated image to a new URL.\n\nCommon eBay Image Mistakes to Avoid\n\nMistakes in your listings slow down your sales efforts and can create problems with your workflow. How can you prevent this from happening?\n\nOnly uploading one or two images per listing;\n\nUploading low-resolution images;\n\nUsing images that are poor quality. Examples include images with cluttered backgrounds or poor lighting;\n\nAdding additional elements to the image such as borders, copyright watermarks, logos, or promotional text.\n\neBay Product Images in Practice – Good and Bad Examples\n\nLet's take a quick look below at some listing examples for the same product. The difference in how the two adhere to eBay image guidelines is what sets them apart.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 Listing - the bad\n\nWhat’s wrong with it:\n\nText on the image\n\nWarranty logo on the image\n\nMultiple representations of the same product\n\nSamsung Galaxy S8 Listing – the good:\n\nWhat’s right with it:\n\nNothing added to the image, including text or logos\n\nFills the frame\n\nClear representation of the product\n\nCasio Men Watch – the bad:\n\nWhat’s wrong with it:\n\nIncludes packaging\n\nCluttered background\n\nHard to properly see the product\n\nCasio Men Watch – the good:\n\nWhat’s right with it:\n\nNo packaging or other unnecessary items\n\nWhite, clear background\n\nProduct fills the image and is easy to see properly\n\nNike Air Sneakers – the bad:\n\nWhat’s wrong with it:\n\nNot well lit\n\nBackground is poor\n\nIncludes packaging\n\nOnly four images uploaded\n\nNike Air Sneakers – the good:\n\nWhat’s right with it:\n\nShows the product in use\n\nMaximum number of images uploaded\n\nWell-lit images with white backgrounds on product-only images\n\nNo packaging\n\nKettle – the bad:\n\nWhat’s wrong with it:\n\nIncludes a watermark\n\nOnly two images uploaded\n\nDoesn’t show the product in use\n\nKettle – the good:\n\nWhat’s right with it:\n\nNothing added to the image – it is only the product\n\nShows the product being used\n\nMaximum number of images used\n\neBay Images FAQ\n\nCan you use stock photos on eBay?\n\nYes, but you should only use stock photos that you get from your product vendor. Using generic stock photos means that you are likely to get flagged by the eBay image policy, but manufacturer photos are fine as long as you are selling a new and undamaged product.\n\nHow do you add pictures to an eBay description?\n\nMany users look to add images within their descriptions to provide clarity to their listings. When considering how to add pictures to ebay description, the easiest method is to copy and paste images having uploaded them to the Internet- for example, in your Dropbox or Google Drive.\n\nHow do you add more than 12 photos to an eBay listing?\n\nTo add more than 12 photos to an eBay listing, you traditionally had to join eBay’s paid listing service. However, by adding photos to the image description as we outlined earlier in the guide, you are able to work around this.\n\nConclusion\n\nYou only have to look at eBay guidelines to understand the importance that eBay places on images. Images are key to making sales and skyrocketing your e-commerce business on eBay\n\nChecking and updating the images in your eBay data feed is an administrative exercise, but it will help increase your sales on the platform… As well as following the tips in our eBay images guide, be sure to check back on your page to see which types of images perform well.\n\nTo optimize your eBay feed and watch your sales grow, check out our feed marketing solution."
