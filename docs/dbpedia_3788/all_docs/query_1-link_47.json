        "text": "Last Updated: January 29, 2024\n\nWhether it’s a brand promotion, video, news update or even a meme, visual content rules the social media landscape. What has become so important is effectively conveying your brand on social media through images and video.\n\nThe visual face of your brand is oftentimes the first thing your audience sees and possibly the one thing they remember. It’s difficult to reuse the same image across all social networks unless you have a free social media image resizing tool like Landscape.\n\nSprout Social’s very own tool is free to use to resize, crop and scale social media image sizes. And along with our resizing tool, we’ve provided all the specific dimensions and a few quick tips to help you decide which image best fits each position.\n\nBefore we get into it, here are some additional resources:\n\nEasily reference this social media image sizes list in our always up-to-date Google Doc.\n\nBookmark our social media video specs and ad guide!\n\nDownload free social media images that are already optimized!\n\nEasily manage multimedia content with Sprout\n\nSprout’s Asset Library simplifies publishing and asset management by providing you with a centralized location to store images, videos and text.\n\nQuickly create, organize, edit and publish assets directly from the Asset Library to deliver on-brand, visually engaging posts for any connected social network.\n\nStart Your Free Trial\n\nSocial Media Image Sizes Per Network\n\nThese links will make it easier for you to navigate to the specific social media image sizes per network:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nYouTube\n\nGoogle My Business\n\nFacebook Image Sizes\n\nWith 2.96 billion monthly active users, Facebook is the world’s largest social network. For that reason alone, it’s important to have attractive and engaging images that are optimized for the platform.\n\nRemember that different devices, whether it’s mobile or desktop, render differently. Make sure that you are choosing dimensions based on where you want the majority of viewers to see your image.\n\nLearn more about Facebook image sizes\n\nGet specs and tips for implementing the best visual content on Facebook with these guides:\n\nAlways up-to-date list of Facebook ad sizes & specs\n\nThe Picture-Perfect Facebook Cover Photo Size\n\nFacebook Event Photo Size & Dimensions Guide\n\nFacebook Profile Picture\n\nSay cheese: your profile picture represents you or your brand on Facebook. This is the round photo that appears on your timeline layered over your cover photo. Your profile picture will also appear when you post to other walls, comment on posts or when your profile is searched.\n\nFacebook profile picture image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 320×320 pixels\n\nMinimum file size: 180×60 pixels\n\nDisplays:\n\n176×176 pixels (desktop)\n\n196×196 pixels (smartphones)\n\n36×36 pixels (most feature phones)\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, PNG\n\nProfile pictures are cropped to a circle\n\nFacebook Business Page Profile Picture\n\nFacebook changed its Profile image for Business Pages to appear to the left side of the screen. The new look helps Facebook Business Pages follow a similar appearance as personal accounts. However, the dimensions are the same, but the photo appears on the page slightly different.\n\nFacebook Business Page profile image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 320×320 pixels\n\nMinimum file size: 180×60 pixels\n\nDisplays:\n\n176×176 pixels (desktop)\n\n196×196 pixels (smartphones)\n\n36×36 pixels (most feature phones)\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, PNG\n\nProfile pictures are cropped to a circle\n\nFacebook Profile and Business Page Cover Photo\n\nYour Facebook cover photo will only appear on your Facebook timeline, and it stretches across the entire screen, which gives you more freedom to choose something creative or supplement your profile picture. Where your profile picture might be a good choice for a picture of you or a brand logo, use this space to post something that speaks more toward you as an individual or as a brand.\n\nFacebook profile and Business Page cover photo image guidelines\n\nRatio: 16:9\n\nMinimum required size: 400×150 pixels\n\nRecommended image size: 851×315 pixels\n\nMobile display size: 640×260 pixels\n\nMax file size: 100kb\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, PNG\n\nNotes:\n\nThe left side of your cover photo will be covered by your profile picture. On mobile, it could be 75% of your profile picture will overlap into the cover photo.\n\nImages with a logo or text may be best as a PNG file\n\nBusiness Page dimensions are exactly the same as personal accounts.\n\nFacebook Shared Image\n\nA shared image is one of the most common forms of sharing on Facebook. These images will always appear on your timeline, and ideally they will show up in most of your followers’ News Feeds — though with the Facebook algorithm determining which content will be served, it’s unlikely that everyone will see your post. The more people engage with your post, the more likely it is that the rest of your followers and their followers will see that activity.\n\nFacebook shared image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1080×1350 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 8MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, PNG, GIF\n\nAppears in feed at a max width of 470 pixels (will scale to a max of 1:1)\n\nAppears on page at a max width of 504 pixels (will scale to a max of 1:1)\n\nFacebook Shared Link\n\nAnother great tool in your Facebook belt is the ability to share a link. It’s very similar to posting a shared image, but it gives you even more fields to work with. You can choose to create a shared link with a small square image to the left and text on the right, or with a larger rectangular image on top with text underneath.\n\nFacebook shared link image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1080×1350 pixels\n\nDisplays:\n\n479×246 pixels (desktop)\n\n320 pixel width (mobile)\n\nMinimum size: 200×200 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 8MB\n\nFacebook will scale photos under the minimum dimensions. For better results, increase image resolution at the same scale as the minimum size.\n\nFacebook Event Image\n\nFacebook Events help capture the attention of users and cut through the noise on Facebook. Reminders are sent to your audience and having a good space with an even better image is important. Make sure you have the right dimensions down for a Facebook Event cover photo.\n\nFacebook Event image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1920×1005\n\nFacebook will scale down to minimum dimensions: 400×150 pixels\n\nFacebook recommends for best results, choose photos that are 400×150 pixels.\n\nFacebook Fundraiser image\n\nFacebook has added the ability to create a fundraiser for charitable organizations or personal causes. The cover photo for these fundraisers slightly varies from a typical Facebook cover photo, with a minimum size of 400×150. The best experience across many display types will come from a higher resolution image, though.\n\nLooking for Facebook ad sizes?\n\nFacebook ad formatting can be even more complex than organic posts, so for more guidelines, check out our complete guide to every Facebook ad size!\n\nFind more information on the image sizes for Facebook, visit the Facebook Help Center.\n\nTwitter Image Sizes\n\nWith 436 million monthly active users, Twitter is one of the social media networks that your customers will most often use to discuss your brand.\n\nX (fka Twitter) Profile Photo\n\nYour X profile photo is the main image that represents you or your brand across the network. It’s going to be seen across the site in a number of places by a number of people so make sure it’s of the highest quality. Here’s the places your profile photo will be visible on the site.\n\nOn your page: The largest display of your profile picture is on your homepage and can be viewed by your followers as well as individuals who stumble upon your page.\n\nIn-stream: A smaller version of your profile picture appears in a follower’s X stream every time you Post or are Reposted.\n\nWho to follow: Your profile picture is also going to appear next to a link to your page in the “Who to follow” box. This is located directly to the right of your X stream on desktop. Choose a recognizable image here.\n\nX (fka Twitter) profile photo image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 400×400 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 5MB\n\nImage types include: JPG, GIF or PNG\n\nX (fka Twitter) Header Photo\n\nYour header photo is the image that spans the top of your X profile page. It’s quite a bit larger than your profile photo so make sure to save it at the highest resolution possible. Because you have more room to be creative with this picture and it will likely be the first thing your visitors see, make it something captivating.\n\nX (fka Twitter) header image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1500×500 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 5MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, GIF or PNG\n\nX (fka Twitter) In-Stream Photos and Shared Links\n\nX users can attach photos to any of their Posts. Depending on whether you’re attaching one or many photos or sharing a link, the way photos crop and display in stream will vary slightly.\n\nFortunately, in 2021, X made waves with #TwitterCropIsGone, eliminating the sometimes-unfavorable automated cropping for vertical images that had often become the subject of memes and in-jokes among users of the platform. Extremely wide or tall images with unusual dimensions may still get cropped, but for most images in standard 4:3 or 16:9 dimensions, you won’t have to worry as much about centering subjects around automated cropping.\n\nThe following are some best practices to get an optimal result, and you can also preview the end result in Sprout’s Compose window before you publish.\n\nRecommended sizes for images by types of Posts:\n\nRecommended image sizes:\n\nMinimum: 600×335 pixels\n\nLandscape: 1024×512 pixels (minimum) and 1600×900 pixels (recommended)\n\nSquare: 1080×1080 pixels\n\nPortrait: 1080×1350 pixels\n\nRecommended aspect ratio: 16:9\n\nMaximum file size:\n\n5 MB for JPG, PNG on mobile and desktop\n\n5 MB for GIFs on mobile\n\n15 MB for GIFs on desktop\n\nMaximum number of images per post: 4 images\n\nFind more information on in-stream photos at the X Help Center.\n\nInstagram Image Sizes\n\nInstagram is one of the most popular photo-sharing social networks. It’s the best place to showcase your visual creativity, even down to making a compelling grid out of the way your photos’ thumbnails display in sequence.\n\nInstagram Profile Picture\n\nInstagram is based on visuals, which should be an indication of how important it is to follow these image size guidelines. Ensure your profile image is recognizable so users can find you even easier through search or explore.\n\nInstagram profile picture image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 110×110 pixels\n\nRecommended aspect ratio: 1:1, 4:5\n\nInstagram Photo Size (Feed & Ad)\n\nBecause Instagram is all about sharing visual content – both images and videos – that appear in your followers’ feeds, it’s important to use higher resolution photos. Whether you’re posting natively in the app, via desktop or through a social media management tool, these guidelines below will help you put your best foot forward.\n\nInstagram photo size (feed & ad) image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1080×1080 pixels or 1080×1350 pixels\n\nRecommended minimum width: 1080 pixels\n\nImages with a width between 320 and 1080 pixels will be kept at the original resolution as long as it fits the recommended aspect ratio listed below\n\nIf images are a lower resolution, Instagram will enlarge to a width of 320 pixels\n\nIf images are a higher resolution, Instagram will shrink it to a width of 1080 pixels\n\nRecommended aspect ratio: 1.91:1 or 4:5\n\nImages will be cropped to fit a supported ratio\n\nMaximum file size: 8MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG and PNG\n\nMaximum number of images per post: 10 images\n\nInstagram Photo Thumbnails\n\nWhen someone goes to your page, they’ll be presented with all of your content arranged in rows of thumbnails. These smaller renditions of your images and videos will expand when clicked and include a place for people to comment.\n\nInstagram photo thumbnails image guidelines\n\nThumbnails will appear at 161×161 pixels\n\nRecommended image width: 1080 pixel\n\nFeed aspect ratio: 1:1\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nInstagram Stories are a popular source of visuals on the app. There are both video and image options available to publish. And while this feature was originally meant to be ephemeral, it’s possible to upload your own content and build a strategy around Stories engagement.\n\nInstagram Story image guidelines\n\nRecommended resolution: 1080×1920\n\nMinimum resolution: 150×150\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nAspect ratio for Instagram Story images published through Sprout: 4:5 to 1.91:1\n\nFor those looking for more info on Instagram ad sizes, including video specs, check out this guide!\n\nTikTok Image Sizes\n\nWith 1 billion monthly active users, TikTok has grown considerably over the last few years.

Where other social networks may be good drivers of traffic and customers, LinkedIn is a great place for you to source great employees and to connect with other industry leaders.\n\nLinkedIn Personal Profile Image\n\nLinkedIn started using a new layout for personal profiles and kept the box logo with company pages (more on that below). However, the personal profile dimensions for LinkedIn is very straightforward. This is the main image that represents you on your personal profile. So anytime someone takes a look at your profile for some quick info, this is the prominent image that represents you. It’s important to get the size right.\n\nLinkedIn personal profile image guidelines\n\nMinimum image size: 268×268 pixels\n\nRecommended image size: 400×400 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 3MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG or PNG\n\nLinkedIn Cover Image\n\nLinkedIn’s background image is a newer feature for your personal profile. It’s a little bit trickier to find something that really fits that space well, but if you get it right, your profile will look great.\n\nLinkedIn cover image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 1128×191 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 3MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG or PNG\n\nLinkedIn Company Logo Image\n\nOne of the two brand logos that you should be uploading to LinkedIn is the standard company logo. This is the bigger of the two and is going to show up right next to your brand name on your LinkedIn homepage. This image also appears in the “Companies you may want to follow” section. The more enticing the photo, the more likely you’ll gain followers.\n\nLinkedIn Company logo image guidelines\n\nMinimum image size: 268×268 pixels\n\nRecommended image size: 400×400 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 3MB\n\nRecommended file type: JPG or PNG\n\nLinkedIn Company Cover Image\n\nUnlike the personal background image, the company or standard business background image covers the entire top of the page.

Currently, the two types of images you can upload here are the main image, which serves as a hero and highlight to your page, and the horizontal scrolling gallery of other company photos beneath.\n\nLinkedIn Life tab image guidelines\n\nRecommended size for main image: 1128×376\n\nRecommended size for company photos: 900×600\n\nRecommended file type: JPG or PNG\n\nThe Life tab only appears on the mobile app, and not the mobile web version of LinkedIn, so exact display sizes will vary by device. Upload the recommended size for the best experience.\n\nFind more information in the LinkedIn Help Center.\n\nLinkedIn Carousel Ads\n\nA LinkedIn carousel is a slideshow-style post that allows readers to “swipe” across slides and read content. This LinkedIn ad type supports images for users to swipe through. Posts can include up to 10 slides and each image can have a link attached.\n\nLinkedIn Carousel ad guidelines\n\nRecommend file size: 10MB\n\nMax image size: 4320×4320 pixels\n\nRecommended individual image size: 1080×1080\n\nRecommended individual image aspect ratio: 1:1\n\nRecommended image type: JPG, PNG, GIF (non-animated only)\n\nPinterest Image Sizes\n\nPinterest Profile Picture\n\nWhen setting up your Pinterest account you have the option to do so using Facebook, Google or email. If you choose Facebook or Google, Pinterest will pull in the profile image that you have set there.\n\nIf you’re using email, or would prefer to use a different photo, you can do that too: just upload a square photograph (the larger the better) and Pinterest will resize it to fit. Like other social sites your profile picture on Pinterest should be something closely tied to you or your brand.\n\nPinterest profile picture image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 165×165 pixels\n\nMaximum file size: 10MB\n\nRecommended image type: JPG and PNG\n\nPinterest Pin Sizes\n\nWhen adding a pin to your board, it’s important to remember that Pinterest puts a limit on the width of the image but not the length. This gives you the opportunity to add a photo that’s square or one that will scale to be even taller. Just remember to make sure you’re creating large images because they add more value, not just because you can.\n\nPinterest Pin sizes image guidelines\n\nRecommended image size: 735×1102 pixels\n\nRecommended ratio: 2:3\n\nRecommended file size: 20MB max, but only 10 MB when publishing via Sprout\n\nRecommended file type: JPG, PNG, GIF\n\nNote: Larger are resized to display at a width of 238 pixels with scaled height in feeds.\n\nText Guidelines\n\nTitle character count: 100 characters max\n\nTextbox character count: 250 characters max\n\nPinterest Board Display\n\nCreating boards is one of the most important things that you can do on Pinterest.

Millions of brands have already realized that YouTube is a great opportunity to reach their fan-base.\n\nYouTube Channel Profile Image\n\nYouTube allows you to select different profile image borders, but the dimensions stay the same.
