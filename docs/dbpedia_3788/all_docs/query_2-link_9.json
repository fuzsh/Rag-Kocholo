With the appropriate image dimensions at your fingertips, you can display pictures as intended without awkward crops or loss of quality.\n\nThink about it – each social media platform has its unique set of rules, especially regarding visuals.\n\nAnd guess what?\n\nWhether you’re a savvy marketer, a creative content maker, or just starting out, mastering these dimensions is key.\n\nSo, what’s the secret sauce?\n\nStay tuned as we’re about to unveil the ins and outs of image sizing that will keep your social media content looking sharp and engaging across all platforms.\n\nA Quick Social Media Image Size Cheat Sheet\n\nHere’s a quick look at the image dimensions for different social media platforms:\n\nLet’s look at them one by one, shall we?\n\n1. Facebook Image Sizes\n\nThe Facebook cover photo should be all about your business. So, why not use one of your product photos representing your company?\n\nMeaningful Facebook conversations begin with great content. Keep in mind that the Facebook algorithm plays a significant role in deciding what content gets seen, so use your Facebook cover photo and newsfeed images strategically to promote engagement. Make sure that you use images that are in tune with your audience’s interests.\n\nWhen it comes to the right sizes for Facebook images, the list just doesn’t seem to end. But to make it easy for you, we have categorized it into 6 common ones:\n\nProfile picture\n\nCover photo\n\nEvent cover photo\n\nGroup cover photos\n\nStories\n\nAds\n\nBut before we go any further, it’s important to understand why there are many Facebook image size variations.\n\nRest assured, Facebook doesn’t just have these many variations to make things difficult for designers. Instead, these variations arise because of the differences in devices.\n\nThink about it.\n\nWhile browsing on a laptop or PC, the screen is horizontal (wide), while mobile screens are vertical (tall). Hence, the size of the device calls for different dimensions.\n\nAnother important point to note: Facebook doesn’t stretch out your creatives; instead, it crops them!\n\nFacebook Image Size: Profile Picture\n\nThe dimensions of the Facebook profile picture size vary from device to device.\n\nFor desktop: Your Facebook profile picture is displayed at 170 x 170 pixels\n\nFor mobile: The Facebook profile picture is displayed at 128 x 128 pixels\n\nFacebook Image Size: Cover Photo\n\nThe dimensions for desktop are 820 x 312 pixels and 640 x 360 pixels for mobile. The recommended dimension for a Facebook cover photo is 851 x 315 pixels.\n\nResource: Know the best practices for creating a striking Facebook cover image.\n\nFacebook Image Size: Event Cover Photo\n\nFor a Facebook cover image, the recommended dimensions are 1200 x 628 pixels, about a 2:1 aspect ratio.\n\nThe size of your event cover photo can’t be changed after being added to an event.\n\nFacebook Image Size: Group Cover Photo\n\nThe ideal size for a perfect Facebook Group cover photo is 1640 x 856 pixels or an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.\n\nFor best results and minimum auto-cropping of your Group cover photo, you can use this image size.\n\nFacebook Image Size: Stories\n\nThe recommended image dimensions for Facebook Stories are 1080 x 1920 pixels with an aspect ratio of 9:16. Stories are designed to cover the entire screen of a smartphone.\n\nFacebook Image Size: Ads\n\nFacebook Ads have various formats, and each format has different design specifications.\n\nFor Facebook Feed Ads, the recommended image size is at least 1080 x 1080 pixels with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1 to 1:1. Minimum size should be 600 x 600 pixels.\n\nFor Right Column Facebook Ads, the minimum image size is 254 x 133 pixels, while the recommended image dimension is 1200 x 1200 pixels. (Note: This is a desktop-only ad type).\n\nFor Facebook Marketplace Ads, the recommended image size is 1080 x 1080 pixels with a ratio of 1:1.\n\nFor Facebook Search, the minimum size is 600 x 600 pixels.

Instagram Image Sizes\n\nMastering Instagram means more than just capturing the perfect shot; it’s about ensuring every pixel is in its place. From your profile picture to your Story uploads, selecting the right Instagram post size can be the difference between ‘just another post’ and a scroll-stopping masterpiece.\n\nInstagram Image Size: Profile Photo\n\nAn Instagram profile picture is displayed at 110 x 110 pixels. However, the upload size is 320 x 320 pixels.\n\nInstagram Image Size: Story\n\nSince the feature’s inception, Instagram Stories have entirely dominated the platform. With over 500 million monthly active users, Stories has become the most popular ephemeral feature for people to discover and interact with your brand.\n\nUse the guidelines below to make your audience interaction successful with the perfect Story image size.\n\nThe recommended resolution for Instagram Stories is 1080 x 1920 pixels with an aspect ratio of 9:16.\n\nInstagram Image Size: Feed Photos\n\nInstagram Feed photos come with multiple orientations.

Your Twitter cover photo is the billboard of your digital persona, while your Twitter profile picture acts as a welcoming handshake. They’re the first things users notice—it’s where eyes land, and judgments are made.\n\nWith the Twitter algorithm influencing what people see, putting effort into these visuals is essential to make sure your content gets noticed and sparks engagement.\n\nBut here’s the thing: if they’re not the right size, they can become a blurry mess or an awkward crop job. That’s why nailing those dimensions is crucial.\n\nTip: Consider a Twitter scheduling tool to get maximum traction with fewer efforts.\n\nJust like your cover photo on other social networks, your Twitter header image is your branding opportunity.
