Sign in to a site on Tableau Server. In the list of Top-level Projects you have access to, select or navigate to the project you want to update. In this example, we'll add an image to the Statistics project folder.

If you're not sure where to find a child project, use the Explore drop-down list and select All Projects.

In the About field, you can enter a description for your project (optional), for example "Global and US statistics." At the end of the project description, add the URL for your image using the following syntax:

!http://www.example.com/image.png!

Select Show formatting hints to see how you can format description text.

Note: Images embedded in project descriptions cannot be resized or positioned. Recommended size is (300 x 184 pixels). Images that are not 300 x 184 pixels may be stretched, shrunk, or cropped to fit the width of the thumbnail. In addition, they must be added at the end of the project description and be enclosed in ! (exclamation marks), otherwise they will not be displayed as the thumbnail.
