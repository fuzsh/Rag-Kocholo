Una Stubbs is single and has been married twice, with an adopted son, Jason, from her first marriage to actor Peter Gilmore, and two sons, composer Christian Henson and musician-composer Joe Henson, from her second marriage to actor Nicky Henson. She has six grandchildren ranging in age from three to 30. She plays Mrs Hudson, landlady to Sherlock Holmes, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, in the BAFTA award-winning series, Sherlock, which returns to our screens in the New Year.

When I was offered my role in Sherlock six years ago, I admit I thought I was just doing another pilot. In fact, my actor friends said to me, “Gosh, it’s a very small part you know.” I don’t think any of us imagined what a success it would be back then.
