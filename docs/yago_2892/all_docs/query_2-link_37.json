        "text": "Former Fawlty Towers actor Nicky Henson has died at the age of 74 after battling cancer for almost twenty years.\n\nHe was best known for playing Mr. Johnson in The Psychiatrist episode of the popular comedy.\n\nHenson once joked that despite his 50 years of professional acting experience, his tombstone will probably read: \"Here lies Nicky Henson – he was in one episode of Fawlty Towers\".\n\nBut the London born star enjoyed a wealth of acting roles. In 2006 he joined the cast of EastEnders, playing Honey Edwards' dad Jack but left the same year due to health problems.\n\nIn an interview with the Mirror last year, Henson said: \"I've been fighting cancer for 18 years now so it’s just part of my life. Whatever happens, happens. It’s not so much fighting it, it’s keeping a sense of humour.\"\n\nConfirming news of Henson's death on Monday, friend Ian Oglivy posted to Facebook: \"After an illness which started twenty years ago, and which was born with great fortitude and good humour, my oldest and dearest friend, my mate Nicky Henson, has gone.\"\n\nTen years before joining EastEnders, Henson also made a brief cameo in rival soap Coronation Street .\n\nHe played dashing French count Henri de Vence in a one-hour special to mark the show's 35th anniversary. As lusty Henri he wooed mousy Mavis Wilton as she enjoyed a Med cruise.\n\nHenson also had roles in dramas Boon, The Bill and Heartbeat during his long-serving acting career.\n\nIn real life, Henson married actress Una Stubbs - who played his sister-in-law Caroline Bishop in EastEnders - in 1969.\n\nThe couple went on to have two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers.\n\nThe marriage ended after Henson began an affair with the actress Susan Hampshire, who he starred with in several stage productions.\n\nAfter his divorce, Henson married ballerina Marguerite Porter in 1986, by whom he has third son Keaton.\n\nIn the last two decades before he died, Henson endured a long and gruelling battle with cancer - but said he still considered himself lucky.\n\nIn an interview last year, Henson said: \"For the last 18 years, I’ve regarded myself as ‘being in extra time’, which I never expected to have, so I’m very thankful for it.\"\n\nHe was first diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Day 19 years ago and underwent an operation to have a tumour removed.\n\n\"To get rid of the first tumour, I had to have half my colon and a third of my stomach removed,\" he explained.\n\n\"I was fine, but a routine scan a few years later revealed I had another tumour. I was prescribed a drug, Gleevac, for six months, to reduce it to an operable size.\n\n\"During that time, I got my dream part as Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night at the RSC, but the physical strain of the part and the side effects of the drug meant I had to give it up. I knew then I’d never act on stage again, which broke my heart,\" he said.\n\n“A further operation found I had two tumours, and not one. One had shrunk, but it was attached to my spleen and had to be removed. So altogether I’ve had three gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTS) which are pretty rare. They grow on their own and attach themselves to organs.\"\n\nTen years later, Henson was diagnosed with prostate cancer and endured 21 medical procedures in over 12 months including intense radiation therapy.\n\nRevealing how he coped with his dark days, Henson said: ' Having a sense of humour helps.'\n\nHe continued: \"Also, it’s incredible what treatment they can offer now. For my generation the ‘c’ word used to mean that was the end. But my three sons looked it up on the internet and told me, ‘Listen dad, it’s not like the old days, you’ll be OK.'\"\n\nHenson remained good friends with his former Fawlty Towers co-star John Cleese.\n\nCleese flew Henson and his wife Marguerite out to St Kitts last year.\n\n\"We rented a house and had a good laugh for 10 days. We’ve known each other for over 50 years now, since The Frost Report.\n\n\"I think my episode of Fawlty Towers, The Psychiatrist, is John’s favourite, which is lovely. I watch them every time they’re repeated,\" said Henson."
