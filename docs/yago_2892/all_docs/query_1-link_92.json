        "text": "TV star Una Stubbs has died at the age of 84.\n\nThe Sherlock and Worzel Gummidge actress, who also had roles in Till Death Us Do Part and EastEnders, passed away at her home in Edinburgh.\n\nHer agent confirmed the news this afternoon said she had been ill for a few months before she died.\n\nHer sons Joe and Christian Henson and Jason Gilmore have released a statement, which reads: \"Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh.\n\nREAD MORE: Heatwave to return to Yorkshire just in time for scorching bank holiday\n\n\"We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.\"\n\nHer agent Rebecca Blond, who represented Una for more than 20 years, said she would \"miss her enormously and remember her always\", the Mirror reports.\n\nBlond said: \"We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n\"She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist.\"\n\nUna became widely known for appearing in the film Summer Holiday alongside Cliff Richard in 1963.\n\nIn more recent years, Una was known for playing Sherlock Holmes' landlady Mrs. Hudson in the BAFTA award-winning television series Sherlock. She also starred in six episodes of EastEnders as Caroline Bishop in 2006.\n\nUna also played Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge during its original run from 1979 to 1981, and Miss Bat in the children's show The Worst Witch.\n\nThe TV star also starred in several films, including Swingers' Paradise, Three Hats for Lisa and Till Death Do Us Part.\n\nUna was also a regular on the game shows Don't Say A Word and its follow-up Give us a Clue.\n\nUna's family had Yorkshire roots - the star discovered while making Who Do You Think You Are? that her grandmother had once lived in the York workhouse and Una’s grandfather, Arthur, worked at the Rowntree factory 30 years before Una became the face of Rowntrees Dairy Box in the 1950s.\n\nTributes have been pouring out across social media for the beloved actor.\n\nJoanna Lumley wrote: \"Devastated to hear about the passing of the brilliant Una Stubbs.\n\n\"My thoughts go out to her family & friends at this very sad time.\"\n\nGyles Brandreth said: \"Oh, this is so sad. Such a funny, lovely, gifted lady - a marvellous actress with a special style & a great (and impish) sense of humour.\n\n\"I first met her when she was in Cowardy Custard in 1972 & last saw her at Nicky Henson's funeral last year. A sad day.\"\n\nSherlock was one of Una's last roles, and she starred alongside Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Sherlock and Watson's landlady.\n\nThe last episode of the BBC series aired in January 2017.\n\nUna's last TV appearance came later that year when she starred in Murder on the Blackpool Express.\n\nThe TV film also starred Johnny Vegas, Sian Gibson and Sheila Reid."
