        "text": "Nicky Henson, best known for his roles in Fawlty Towers and EastEnders, has died of cancer aged 74.\n\nThe actor played Mr Johnson in “The Psychiatrist” episode of the beloved sitcom in 1979. His character becomes something of an obsession for John Cleese’s Basil Fawlty, who is determined to catch Johnson breaking hotel policy by having a woman in his room.\n\nHenson also appeared in Eastenders in 2006 – as Honey Edwards’s father Jack – as well as The Bill, Boon and Heartbeat, but he once joked that his tombstone would read: “Here lies Nicky Henson – he was in one episode of Fawlty Towers.”\n\nHenson was first diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Day 19 years ago, and said last year, “For the last 18 years, I’ve regarded myself as ‘being in extra time’, which I never expected to have, so I’m very thankful for it.”\n\nConfirming news of the actor’s death, friend Ian Oglivy wrote on Facebook: ”After an illness which started 20 years ago, and which was born with great fortitude and good humour, my oldest and dearest friend, my mate Nicky Henson, has gone.”\n\nHenson married Una Stubbs, his co-star in EastEnders, in 1969. The couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers. Henson later married ballerina Marguerite Porter, and the pair had a son, Keaton."
