        "text": "Rushed out a review of Spitfire Symphonic Brass from Spitfire Audio since the intro price ends Oct 1. All the great sounding BML Brass samples packed up in one library at a great price point make this library very tempting. But, there are a few things you must know before making the purchase.\n\nWritten Review, demos and more: https://bit.ly/ReviewSpitfireSymphincBrass\n\nSpitfire Symphony Brass sells from https://www.SpitfireAudio.com\n\nThank you for your honest review, my friend. It's simply amazing though and pretty awesome that the collection sells for only 500 pounds especially since I originally spent over 200 pounds I believe on just Bones Volume 1!\n\nYou are welcome Rodney and thanks for the support. You are absolutely right, It is great to be able to get this library at this price!\n\nThere is a very good reason why Spitfire locks their legato patches, at the very least. There is a greater chance of messing things up than fixing them by the user, considering the complexity of those patches, most likely, so let's just leave it to SF to fix it. It's the only right thing. (BTW it is only certain patches, and quickfix is available to people who send in a support ticket!)\n\nAlso, Christian Thomsen? Did you perhaps mean Paul Thompson? He's the one usually doing SF walkthrough videos.\n\nThere is a very good reason why Spitfire locks their legato patches, at the very least.

He's the one usually doing SF walkthrough videos.\n\nI agree EvilDragon most users have no business trying to get into the back and trying to fix it themselves.\n\nI was unaware spitfire was sending out a quickfix. Thank you for the information I will pass it along! And . . . yes! Looks like I got Christian Henson/Paul Thomson mixed together.\n\nPlus I was informed that was a script bug rather than something that would be sortable in Kontakt's edit mode... So even if patches were unlocked, chances are the fix would not be possible to be done by the user (since release triggers are handled by the script as opposed to Kontakt's built in options, I presume).\n\nPlus I was informed that was a script bug rather than something that would be sortable in Kontakt's edit mode...

Great to know!\n\nActually, I might have been thinking of Jim Hensen lol\n\nNot many people know this but Christian Henson is the son of an actor called Nicky Henson and his mum is Una Stubbs (who played Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge and is perhaps lately better known as Mrs Hudson in Sherlock).\n\nJust something I stumbled on once while looking up a piece of music that he composed for a film called Triangle."
