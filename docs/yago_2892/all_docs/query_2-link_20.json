        "text": "Nicky Henson appears in Fawlty Towers episode in 1979\n\nNicky Henson was an English actor best known for his television roles in Minder, Boon and Heartbeat. He was also best known for playing Mr Johnson in The Psychiatrist episode of Fawlty Towers. The 74-year-old actor died on Monday, December 16. But how exactly did he die?\n\nWho was Nicky Henson?\n\nNicky Henson was an actor who first began his career in 1963.\n\nDuring his career which spanned more than 50 years, he appeared on television, in films and on the stage.\n\nHe was nominated for a 1998 Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Supporting Performance in a Musical of 1997 for his role in Enter the Guardsman.\n\nREAD MORE: Una Stubbs: Five things I can't live without\n\nMr Henson joined BBC One soap opera Eastenders in 2006, playing Jack Edwards.\n\nBut was forced to leave the production towards the end of the year due to health problems.\n\nHe also starred in The Bill and period drama Downton Abbey.\n\nHis film credits included The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones, No. 1 of the Secret Service, Vera Drake and George Clooney's Syriana.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Read our Privacy Policy\n\nIn his personal life, Mr Henson was married twice.\n\nHe married actress Una Stubbs, who played his sister-in-law Caroline Bishop in Eastenders, in 1969.\n\nDuring their six-year marriage, the couple had two children before the relationship broke down in 1974.\n\nThe actor then went on to marry ballerina Marguerite Porter in 1986.\n\nThe couple went on to have a son, Keaton, who became a musician and illustrator, and they remained married up to his death.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nUna Stubbs talks about her love of seaside holidays [INSIGHT]\n\nActress Una Stubbs - I can’t describe how lucky I feel to be in Sherlock [INTERVIEW]\n\nUna Stubbs: 'The Big Painting Challenge is a brilliant series' [PICTURES]\n\nHow did Nicky Henson die?\n\nNicky Henson was diagnosed with cancer in 2003.\n\nDoctors removed tumours from around his spleen, but a routine check-up in 2006 showed that other tumours had grown and it would be dangerous to remove them.\n\nMr Henson was put on a regimen of chemotherapy, and worked regularly to raise funds for cancer charities, especially Marie Curie Cancer Care.\n\nHowever, after battling cancer for 20 years, he was pronounced as dead on Monday, December 16.\n\nConfirming news of Henson's death on Monday, friend Ian Oglivy posted to Facebook: \"After an illness which started twenty years ago, and which was born with great fortitude and good humour, my oldest and dearest friend, my mate Nicky Henson, has gone.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Mirror in 2018, Mr Henson said: \"I've been fighting cancer for 18 years now so it’s just part of my life.\n\n\"Whatever happens, happens. It’s not so much fighting it, it’s keeping a sense of humour.\"\n\nHe told The Sun: \"For the last 18 years, I've regarded myself as 'being in extra time', which I never expected to have, so I'm very thankful for it.\n\n\"I got my first cancer on Christmas day 18 years ago and didn't think I was going to survive, after I was told I had a large tumour and would have to be operated on.\n\n\"To get rid of the first tumour, I had to have half my colon and a third of my stomach removed. I was fine, but a routine scan a few years later revealed I had another tumour.\n\n\"During that time, I got my dream part as Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night at the RSC, but the physical strain of the part and the side effects of the drug meant I had to give it up. I knew then I’d never act on stage again, which broke my heart.\n\n\"A further operation found I had two tumours, and not one.\n\n\"Ten years ago, they found I also had prostate cancer. I’ve had radiation for it but I developed really bad kidney stones, which are agony and have been the worst part of the whole thing.\n\n\"I had around 21 medical procedures over 12 months.\""
