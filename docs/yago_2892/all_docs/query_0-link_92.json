        "text": "Post by Lou on\n\nNicky Henson will be joining the show to play the character of Jack Edwards. Henson will appear on screen at the end of February. He will play the father of Honey Edwards, part-time bar maid in the Vic and full time girlfriend of Billy Mitchell.\n\nHenson takes over the role of Jack Edwards that was originally due to be played by David Essex. Essex was replaced once it had been decided that the character of Jack would be staying in Walford for longer than had originally been planned and longer than Essex was able to be on the show.\n\nHenson said: \"I'm really looking forward to joining EastEnders. Jack gets stuck in from the minute he arrives. He's your typical over-protective dad and seems intent on giving Billy a hard time from the start.\"\n\nNicky Henson has been a regular of the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company as well as starring in a string of television and film roles over 30 years.\n\nPost by Lou on\n\nEXCLUSIVE: ENDERS NICK IN STREET\n\nEASTENDERS newcomer Nicky Henson has a secret soap past with rival Corrie.\n\nThe 60-year-old, who has also appeared in The Bill, Boon and Heartbeat, is about to arrive in Walford as Honey Edwards' dad Jack after learning she's having loser Billy Mitchell's baby.\n\nBut 10 years ago he played dashing French count Henri de Vence in a one-hour Coronation Street video special to mark the show's 35th anniversary.\n\nThen he wooed mousy Mavis as she enjoyed a Med cruise.\n\nBut Henri was really a Brummy called Sid paid to chat up the older ladies.\n\nA TV source said: \"The BBC have told us all about Nicky being a top Shakespearean actor - but they left out his Corrie debut. Someone will remember his face.\""
