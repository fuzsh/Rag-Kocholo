His film credits included Vera Drake and Syriana, which starred George Clooney.\n\nHe also enjoyed a host of stage roles at the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre, and was a founder member of the Young Vic.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
