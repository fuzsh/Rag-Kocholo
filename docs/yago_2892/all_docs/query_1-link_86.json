        "text": "Actress Una Stubbs who became well-known for her roles in Sherlock, Worzel Gummidge and EastEnders has died at the age of 84.\n\nThe star who shot to fame in film Summer Holiday, alongside Cliff Richard, died surrounded by her family at her Edinburgh home, her agent said.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the actress had been ill for some months.\n\nREAD MORE:Natalie Cassidy's life off screen with cameraman husband she met on EastEnders\n\nUna performed lots of roles during her career and played the part of Caroline Bishop, in 2006 on EastEnders.\n\nFans will also recognise her from Sherlock and she took on the role of Mrs Hudson, the landlady of flat 221B Baker Street, in the BBC drama inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, alongside Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nBorn in 1937 in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, after getting her first big film break in Summer Holiday, she went on to appear in Wonderful Life before acting in Till Death Us Do Part, In Sickness and in Health and Worzel Gummidge.\n\nShe also featured in Fawlty Towers, Keeping Up Appearances, Midsomer Murders Call The Midwife and Casualty.\n\nA statement from her family said: “Mum passed away quietly today with her family around her, in Edinburgh. We ask for privacy and understanding at this most difficult and sad of times.”\n\nHer agent Rebecca Blond said: “We are desperately sad to have lost not only a wonderful actress, whose screen and stage career, spanning over 50 years, was so extraordinarily varied, from Till Death Us Do Part to Sherlock, as well as memorable performances in the West End, at the Old Vic, Donmar Warehouse, Sheffield Crucible and National Theatre, but also a wickedly funny, elegant, stylish, graceful, gracious and kind and constant friend.\n\n“She was also a highly respected and exhibited artist. We will miss her enormously and remember her always.”\n\nIn addition to her work as an actress, Stubbs was also a keen amateur painter who had her work displayed at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nStubbs was married to actor Peter Gilmore from 1958 to 1969, with whom she adopted son Jason, and then married Nicky Henson in 1969, before they split in 1975.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers.\n\nChristian wrote on Twitter: “Some of you may have known her as Rita, as Sally as Bat or Hudson but to my two brothers and I she was known as Mum.\n\n“Thanks for everything Mum RIP.”\n\nSherlock creator Steven Moffat remembered Una Stubbs as “the loveliest light on Baker Street” as he paid tribute to her.\n\nWriting on Instagram, he said: “The loveliest light on Baker Street has gone out. What a woman, what a talent, what a star – and just about the kindest, nicest, funniest person you could meet.\n\n\"I don’t know how anyone even starts summing up that career – Till Death Us Do Part, Fawlty Towers, the incomparable Aunt Sally in Worzel Gummidge… and, of course, the irreplaceable heart and soul of Sherlock”."
