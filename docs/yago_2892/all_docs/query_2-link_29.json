        "text": "FORMER EastEnders and Downton Abbey actor Nicky Henson has died at the age of 74 after a 19 year battle with cancer.\n\nThe actor also appeared in Fawlty Towers and a host of theatre roles at the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre.\n\nConfirming news of Henson's death on Monday, friend Ian Oglivy posted to Facebook: \"After an illness which started twenty years ago, and which was born with great fortitude and good humour, my oldest and dearest friend, my mate Nicky Henson, has gone.\"\n\nA statement from his family added: \"Nicky Henson has died after a long disagreement with cancer.\"\n\nHe was best known for playing Mr Johnson in the episode of Fawlty Towers called The Psychiatrist, in which John Cleese's Basil Fawlty becomes obsessed with catching his character breaking hotel policy by having a woman in his room.\n\nHe joked that despite his 50 years of acting, his tombstone would probably read: \"Here lies Nicky Henson - he was in one episode of Fawlty Towers\".\n\nHenson carried on working long after his diagnosis and played Honey Edwards' father Jack in EastEnders in 2006 and Charles Grigg in Downton Abbey. He also made numerous appearances in The Bill.\n\nHe also appeared in more than 30 films, including Witchfinder General, Psychomania, Vera Drake and Syriana.\n\nHe recorded his first single in 1961 and had a three-year contract writing songs for The Shadows and Cliff Richard.\n\nHenson's most recent acting credit was as Latham in the crime drama Tango One in 2018.\n\nCANCER BATTLE\n\nDiscussing his cancer battle last year, Henson said: \"For the last 18 years, I've regarded myself as 'being in extra time', which I never expected to have, so I'm very thankful for it.\n\n\"I got my first cancer on Christmas day 18 years ago and didn't think I was going to survive, after I was told I had a large tumour and would have to be operated on.\n\n\"To get rid of the first tumour, I had to have half my colon and a third of my stomach removed. I was fine, but a routine scan a few years later revealed I had another tumour.\n\n\"During that time, I got my dream part as Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night at the RSC, but the physical strain of the part and the side effects of the drug meant I had to give it up. I knew then I’d never act on stage again, which broke my heart.\n\n\"A further operation found I had two tumours, and not one.\n\n\"Ten years ago, they found I also had prostate cancer. I’ve had radiation for it but I developed really bad kidney stones, which are agony and have been the worst part of the whole thing. I had around 21 medical procedures over 12 months.\"\n\nThe actor, who went swimming every day, said it was a \"job staying on top of it all\", adding how a \"sense of humour helps\".\n\nHe said: \"It’s incredible what treatment they can offer now. For my generation the ‘c’ word used to mean that was the end. But my three sons looked it up on the internet and told me, 'Listen dad, it's not like the old days, you’ll be OK.'\"\n\nHe said work had been his \"saviour\" and that his \"wonderful\" family had got him through the tough times.\n\nGranddad-of-four Henson married Una Stubbs, his co-star in EastEnders, in 1969, but they divorced six years later.\n\nThe couple had two sons, Joe and Christian, both of whom are composers.\n\nHenson later married ballerina Marguerite Porter, for whom he was married for 32 years, and the pair had a son, Keaton, who is also a composer.\n\nDiscussing that he said: \"It was love at first sight when I met her, but I couldn’t get up the nerve to ask her out. In the end a friend got us together.\"\n\nWhen asked about his regrets, he said: “Not about my career – I’ve done pretty well for someone with no ambition. The only regrets are the upsets I’ve given people in my life, particularly ladies, when I was young. I’ve said sorry to Una [Henson was married to Sherlock actress Una Stubbs]. I was always very, very immature – in fact, I’ve only grown up recently.”\n\nPaying tribute to Henson, EastEnders actor Stuart Antony tweeted: \"RIP the wonderful Nicky Henson - the man with million stories all of them funny. A true gent x\"\n\nActor Stephen Mangan tweeted: \"RIP Nicky Henson, fine actor and the first ever Garry Lejeune in Noises Off. I will salute you today by falling backwards down a flight of stairs.\"\n\nWriter Gyles Brandreth said: \"Sad news. Nicky Henson was the just the loveliest & most brilliant guy, an actor of such energy & style. He’s been ill for too long & was so courageous. RIP\""
