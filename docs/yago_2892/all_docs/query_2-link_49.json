        "text": "The Liverpool Echo writes several stories a day on well known personalities or popular TV shows for instance.\n\nThey are often on subjects that get people talking on social media about a specific moment they've seen or heard, which is why we call them trending stories.\n\nWhile we know they are among the most popular stories we produce, they can also receive negative feedback in our comments so we have created this Factbox to respond to some of the most common points raised.\n\nThis isn't real news / real journalism\n\nTrending news is as real as any other subject we cover. Our stories are written by trained and experienced journalists, responding quickly to events.\n\nWe understand they are not for everyone and we have lots of stories on other topics for our audience to read.\n\nIt's nothing to do with Liverpool\n\nA lot of stories we do have nothing to do with Liverpool on the face of it. However that does not mean people from Liverpool are not interested in the subject, TV show or person and enjoy reading about them.\n\nNo-one reads this type of story\n\nWe use data to help us decide what to write about. Our data shows us how popular trending stories are. What's more, they are very popular among our most loyal audience - people who visit our website more than 15 times a month.\n\nThanks for reading. If you want to ask us any more questions about what the Liverpool Echo does, please email neil.macdonald01@reachplc.com"
