I was fine, but a routine scan a few years later revealed I had another tumour.”\n\nTen years later, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and endured 21 medical procedures over the course of a year.\n\nTributes have already flooded into Twitter, with actor Stuart Anthony Antony writing: “RIP the wonderful Nicky Henson - The man with million stories all of them funny. A true gent x.”\n\nProducer Jonathan Sothcott tweeted: “A cornerstone of British films & TV for half a century. It was a privilege to work with him on the 2 @WSKTOW films & call him my mate. Had the best time with him in Marbella #NickyHenson.”"
