        "text": "Arno Penzias (born April 26, 1933, Munich, Germany—died January 22, 2024, San Francisco, California, U.S.) was a German American astrophysicist who shared one-half of the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics with Robert Woodrow Wilson for their discovery of a faint electromagnetic radiation throughout the universe. Their detection of this radiation lent strong support to the big-bang model of cosmic evolution. (The other half of the Nobel Prize was awarded to the Soviet physicist Pyotr Kapitsa for unrelated work.)\n\nEducated at City College of New York in New York City and Columbia University, where he received a doctorate in 1962, Penzias joined Bell Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey. In collaboration with Wilson he began monitoring radio emissions from a ring of gas encircling the Milky Way Galaxy. Unexpectedly, the two scientists detected a uniform microwave radiation that suggested a residual thermal energy throughout the universe of about 3 K. Most scientists now agree that this is the residual background radiation stemming from the primordial explosion billions of years ago from which the universe was created. From 1976 to 1979 Penzias was director of the Bell Radio Research Laboratory. He later served as vice president of research (1981–95) and as vice president and chief scientist (1995–98) at Bell Laboratories, which was spun off as part of Lucent Technologies in 1996."
