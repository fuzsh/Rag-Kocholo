        "text": "(1933–2024). German-American astrophysicist Arno Penzias shared one-half of the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics with Robert Woodrow Wilson. The pair had discovered a faint electromagnetic radiation throughout the universe, which lent strong support to the big-bang model of cosmic evolution. (The other half of the Nobel Prize was awarded to the Soviet physicist Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa for unrelated work.)\n\nArno Allan Penzias was born on April 26, 1933, in Munich, Germany. He was educated at City College of New York and Columbia University, where he received his doctorate in 1962. He then joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey.\n\nIn collaboration with Wilson he began monitoring radio emissions from a ring of gas encircling the Milky Way Galaxy. Unexpectedly, the two scientists detected a uniform microwave radiation that suggested a residual thermal energy throughout the universe. Most scientists now agree that this is the residual background radiation stemming from the primordial explosion billions of years ago from which the universe was created."
