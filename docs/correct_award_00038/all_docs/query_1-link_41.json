        "text": "Wilson tells the story in his Nobel lecture of 1978:\n\nThus we seemed to be left with the antenna as the source of our extra noise. We calculated a contribution of $0.9 \\text{K}$ from its resistive loss using standard waveguide theory. The most lossy part of the antenna was its small diameter throat, which was made of electroformed copper. We had measured similar waveguides in the lab and corrected the loss calculations for the imperfect surface conditions we had found in those waveguides. The remainder of the antenna was made of riveted aluminum sheets, and although we did not expect any trouble there, we had no way to evaluate the loss in the riveted joints. A pair of pigeons was roosting up in the small part of the horn where it enters the warm cab. They had covered the inside with a white material familiar to all city dwellers. We evicted the pigeons and cleaned up their mess, but obtained only a small reduction in antenna temperature.\n\nWith this help I found this old chat discussion from which I relocated the YouTube video Arno Penzias & Robert Wilson from BBC movie \"Hawking\" (2004) in which they recount the story, including both the dielectric euphemism and more literal (guttural) term.\n\nNote that these are actors, this is historical fiction, so it's not a primary answer to your question, but let's assume the BBC at least tried to reflect some aspects of reality.\n\nThe reenactment is quite humorous in the telling and then quite compelling (closed captions available)\n\nI still think that The Pigeons Were Innocent would be a great title for a film, but they'd probably use that for the working title and call it The His Was Still There upon release."
