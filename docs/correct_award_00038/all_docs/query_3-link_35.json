        "text": "AKA Arno Allan Penzias\n\nBorn: 26-Apr-1933\n\nBirthplace: Munich, Bavaria, Germany\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Jewish\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Astronomer\n\nParty Affiliation: Democratic\n\nNationality: United States\n\nExecutive summary: Detected primordial radiation\n\nMilitary service: US Army Signal Corps (radar officer, 1954-57)\n\nArno Penzias was testing a directional radio antenna intended for satellite communications in 1964 when he noticed an unusual pattern in the background static. At first Penzias and his colleague at Bell Laboratories, Robert Woodrow Wilson, assumed that they had encountered interference caused from terrestrial broadcasts or even bird droppings on their equipment, but analysis showed that the microwave radiation was coming uniformly from all directions.\n\nIn consultation with physicist Robert H. Dicke, they came to understand that this stable pattern must be residual cosmic background radiation, a lingering aftereffect of the \"big bang\" that created the universe many billions of years ago. Their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation is considered among the 20th century's most important findings in astrophysics, earning Penzias and Wilson the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1978. Penzias also conducted important research in interstellar chemistry, analyzing millimeter-wave radiation from space to determine the chemical content of molecules in the vast space between stars.\n\nHe was born in Germany, but Jewish, when that was grounds for extermination. His family fled to England in 1938 and settled in America, where his parents worked at menial jobs and he attended City College of New York, because that school offered free tuition when he could not afford to pay. In Stockholm to receive his Nobel honors, Penzias says he took great pleasure in seeking out every German reporter he could find, to tell them the story of his childhood escape from the Nazi government.\n\nFather: Karl Penzias (carpenter)\n\nMother: Justine Eisenreich Penzias (factory worker)\n\nBrother: Gunther\n\nWife: Anne\n\nHigh School: Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, NY\n\nUniversity: BS Physics, City College of New York (1954)\n\nUniversity: MA Physics, Columbia University (1958)\n\nUniversity: PhD Physics, Columbia University (1962)\n\nScholar: Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University (1972-82)\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1978 (with Robert Woodrow Wilson and Pyotr Kapitsa)\n\nHenry Draper Medal 1977 (with Robert Woodrow Wilson)\n\nLucent Spokesman and Scientific Advisor (1997-)\n\nBell Laboratories VP Research (1981-97)\n\nBell Laboratories Executive Director of Research (1979-81)\n\nBell Laboratories Director of Research (1976-79)\n\nBell Laboratories Director, Radio Physics Research Department (1972-76)\n\nBell Laboratories Research Staff (1962-72)\n\nMember of the Board of Arthur D.
