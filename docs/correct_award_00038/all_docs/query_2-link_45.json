        "text": "Abstract\n\nA survey of the radio radiation at 960 Mc/s from the part of the plane of the Galaxy with declination above 48Â° has been made. 112 discrete sources were found in the region studied. The positions, intensities, and sizes of these sources have been catalogued, and a search for optical identifications made. The broadly distributed radiation is interpreted in terms of a space distribution of ionized hydrogen and of emissivity from synchrotron emission."
