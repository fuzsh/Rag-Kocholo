        "text": "This Indian scientist laid the foundation for modern statistics in India... Dr. C.R. Rao is a statistical genius, teacher, and institution-builder, whose work more than 75 years ago continues to exert a profound influence on science. Undoubtedly, he is a living legend, contributing vastly to statistical theories. He was born in Karnataka and was the eighth child in the family. His father, a police inspector, always encouraged him to solve mathematical problems. Rao joined Mrs. A.V.N College at Visakhapatnam for his Bachelor's and completed his M.A. with first rank at Andhra University. He also did an M.S. degree from Calcutta University. Dr. Rao started his career working at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta as a research scholar. P.C Mahalanobis, ISI's founder, and the lead architect of India's statistical system asked Rao to lead ISI's research and training wing, making him a professor at the young age of 29. Rao made sure that statistical practitioners received training through practical examples rather than through the derivation of statistical theorems, thus playing an important role in realising Mahalanobis' mission. He then moved to Cambridge University to acquire his Ph.D. under R.A. Fisher, the father of modern statistics. He worked at the University of Pittsburgh for eight years and then moved to Pennsylvania State University, where he continues to work as the Director of the Center for Multivariate Analysis (CMA). In his remarkable paper published in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society, Rao demonstrated three fundamental results that paved the way for the modern field of Statistics and provided statistical tools heavily under science today. Rao has always been an excellent communicator, and his 1997 book Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work remains one of the most accessible introductions to the subject. Dr. Rao is a fellow of the Royal Society. Recognizing his contributions to the field of statistics, he was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2001. The International Prize in Statistics is awarded to him this year for his revolutionising statistical thinking in its time and influencing human understanding of science across a wide spectrum of the discipline.

A proud moment for India, for the nation witnessed an Indian Physicist honored with the prestigious Boltzmann Medal for his work in the field of statistical physics. From being an elected fellow of all the major Indian Sciences for the prestigious award, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune's Emeritus Prof Deepak Dhar continues to enrich the field of physics with his great contribution to the scientific community. Deepak's interest in science was cultivated by his father, who would bring home popular science books and persuade him to read. He was a National Science Talent Search (NSTS) Scholar and joined the BSc course at Allahabad University (AU). His NSTS advisor Vipin Kumar Agrawal would encourage him to read science outside the textbooks. The 'summer camps' conducted by NSTS benefitted him in a great way as he would get to hear specially designed lectures from eminent scientists and professors. Prof. Dhar moved to Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to pursue a master's degree in Physics, where he met several fellow Indians who were keen to pursue academic careers. He went to the California Institute of Technology, USA, for his Ph.D. He worked on a model of 3D solid melting, which he later discovered was not particularly applicable. Nevertheless, the insight he gained from this project was exceptional. While working as a teaching assistant with Prof Richard Feynman, he had to perform the task of grading students. Though he would follow the standard marking scheme, Prof Feynman didn't approve. He asked him to come up with a system that distinguishes between students who get 9 vs 9.5 vs 10. Prof Dhar says, even students who score 9.5 should feel that they can do better. 15 students getting 100/100 is not desirable and gives a wrong message to students. Dhar returned to India and joined the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research as a postdoctoral fellow. In a four-decade-long career, he witnessed several changes to scientific research. Currently, Prof. Dhar is teaching undergraduates at IISER, Pune. He wishes the students to perceive statistical physics as a different way of looking at multi-component systems that possess multiple degrees of freedom. He thinks that recognition of his research may motivate students to explore statistical physics as a research career option.

This is the story of Shri Padmabhusan awardee Prof. Satish Dhawan. He is the man behind the country's first supersonic wind tunnel at IISc. He is the man behind SLV3. And he is the man behind the soaring success of ISRO - Indian Space Research Organization. Prof. Satish had a Bachelor's degree in physics, mathematics, and mechanical engineering, a Master's degree in English literature and aerospace engineering, and a double Ph.D. in mathematics. He joined Bengaluru-based IISc's Department of Aerospace Engineering, and in 1962, he was appointed the Director of the Institute, making him the youngest in this position at just 42 years old. Not only that, he went on to remain the institution's longest-serving, and undoubtedly most distinguished Director. After the tragic death of Vikram Sarabhai, Prof.Dhawan took over as the Chairman of ISRO at the request of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and spearheaded the organisation in 1984 while balancing the demanding role of IISc's Director till 1981. His contributions include setting up the first supersonic wind tunnel in India at IISc. He also led to the development of operational systems like INSAT- a telecommunications satellite, IRS- an Indian Remote Sensing satellite and ISRO's workhorse Polar Satellite Launch vehicle (PSLV rocket). He was responsible for hand-picking young, bright, and dedicated professionals for ISRO, such as APJ Abdul Kalam, who led the project that developed SLV-3. It was under his chairmanship that India successfully developed an indigenous launch vehicle SLV3. When the mission was doomed, Dhawan himself faced the fire, defending his team. When they triumphed, he stepped back and sent his team out to receive the laurels. His behaviour was so contrary to normal human conduct; a person likes to take credit for success and disown any association with failure. Kalam was so deeply affected by this incident that he would often narrate it to public audiences. Owing to his relentless efforts in bringing India into the space race, ISRO renamed the Indian satellite launch centre Satish Dhawan Space Center. His great human qualities, deep commitment to social values, and extraordinary objectivity in management have led several generations of students to efforts that they would otherwise have not taken. If Vikram Sarabhai nurtured ISRO during its infancy and provided a vision, then it was Satish Dhawan who took over to the pinnacle of success.

During a time when the only socially acceptable job for a woman was to look after her family and children, she was the first Indian woman to complete her studies in western medicine from the United States of America in the 1880s. Dr. Anandibai Gopalrao Joshi, a woman to take as an inspiration, was the first female doctor of India. She fought a decade-long war with the 18th-century Indian society and won. Anandibai was born as Yamuna in 1865 and was married to Gopalrao Joshi, who was 20 years elder. She was just nine years old. Gopalrao was a progressive man who supported women's education and thus encouraged his wife to educate. Anandibai was just 14 when she gave birth to her first child. However, the baby died only 10 days after being born due to a lack of medical facilities. This incident pushed Anandi to learn medicine and help other women who were in the same situation as her. Gopalrao tried enrolling her in missionary schools, but it did not work out. They moved to Calcutta, where she learned to read and speak English and Sanskrit. Upon learning of Anandibai's plans to pursue higher education, orthodox Indian society highly criticised her. Many Christians supported her decision but wanted her to convert to Christianity. Anandi, in a speech at Serampore College, discussed the persecution she endured and stressed the need for Hindu female doctors in India. She also pledged that she would never convert to Christianity. Her speech received publicity, and financial contributions started pouring in. She applied to the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania and was granted admission. When she returned to India, she got a grand welcome. Kolhapur appointed her as the physician in charge of the female ward. Her tenure as the chief medical officer of Bombay Municipal Corporation's Department of health was very significant as she strived hard to improve sanitation facilities in the city. Her vision of working towards the social upliftment of women has helped many women gain confidence in public life. She was an active participant at the International Council of women, where she addressed issues concerning women's education and health care. Anandibai's conviction to dedicate herself to society and be involved in the socio-cultural development of women is an example for all young girls.

From paddy farms to the top of ISRO, his career is a pure example of perseverance, determination, and how dreams become a reality. Dr. K Sivan- the rocket scientist who spearheaded India's moon mission, did not get to wear sandals until he was in college. His legacy remains undefeated, the ‘rocket man’, a dream of every eye.. Sivan spent his childhood years studying and helping his father in the fields. He was a bright boy and brilliant in mathematics. Sivan could not pursue engineering as his father was not able to pay the high fees for engineering courses. So, Sivan went on to pursue a bachelor's in mathematics at ST Hindu College in Nagercoil. However, his exceptional success helped him to get a scholarship at the Madras Institute of Technology. His father sold a part of his agricultural land to fund his education at MIT. Sivan took aeronautical engineering and went on to complete his ME in aerospace engineering from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). He joined the ISRO - Indian Space Research Organization in 1982. He was a man of immense calibre, grit, and devotion, who has completely and thoroughly invested himself in every space project that India has undertaken over the past 37 years. He has had major contributions to end-to-end mission planning, mission design, mission integration, and analysis with ISRO. He developed and implemented the day-of-launch wind biassing strategy, due to which India can launch a rocket on any day, under any weather or wind conditions. A mastermind behind satellite technicalities, Dr. Sivan made it possible for ISRO to create history in February 2017 by sending out 104 satellites in a single mission. Sivan's cost-effective strategy made the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) launch a grand success. Chandrayaan-2, a highly anticipated Lunar exploration mission, was also launched successfully and inserted into Lunar orbit during his tenure. However, it faced a setback when the Vikram lander lost the link with the ISRO's scientist barely 2.1 km away from the lunar surface. It is believed that it was Sivan's leadership that made India achieve global recognition in the field of space technology. His award cabinet is a sight to behold, including some of ISRO's most prestigious awards for research and merit. To a query from a 10th-standard student on how scientists coped with failures, Dr. Sivan said the biggest lessons in life are often derived when the plans go astray.

This story is about Dr. Prem Mohan Mishra- an eminent physician, former Professor and Head of the Department of Medicine at Darbhanga Medical College & Hospital, who has been recently praised by prime minister Narendra Modi. Prof. Prem Mohan Mishra belonged to a very poor family in Koilakh village in the Madhubani district. His family's condition began to deteriorate after the death of his father. However, Prof. Mishra completed his matric from BSEB, Patna, in 1976, which was 5 kms away from his house. He did not even have the money to buy a bicycle and travelled 10 km daily by foot. It was his brother, who pushed him to complete his Bsc from LNMU, Darbhanga. But his struggle did not end there. He did not have money for accommodation in Darbhanga. So, every day he used to travel from Jhanjharpur to Darbhanga daily. He completed his Ph.D. in Physio Inorganic from LNMU and joined as a professor in MLSM College. He has completed two research projects, submitted 3 thesis, worked on 45 journals, is the author of 21 books and has organised various seminars, conferences and workshops so far. Prof. Mishra has an experience of more than 30 years of mentoring and has been teaching chemistry to thousands of students. Professor Mishra was praised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his Mann ki Baat program and told the teachers to take inspiration from him. He was one of the first to start his online classes on various platforms of internet media for the students of the college which was closed due to Corona. After his initiative to continue classes amidst the hard times of the pandemic, universities of Bihar made online classes mandatory for every subject. Prof. Mishra was also successful in establishing centres for Mathematics Olympiad and KVPY exams in Darbhanga at a time when students had to travel to Patna for giving their exams. He also established the Institute of Foreign Languages and is the Director of the same. Prof. Mishra has been the representative of Maithili in the Sahitya Academy of the Government of India. He has also received the 2016 Sahitya Akademi Award for Children's Literature in the Maithili language.

Obaid Siddiqi was among a daring few who defined a new intellectual quest and whose leadership created a culture of research. His foresight, determination, and courage have transformed research in molecular biology in the country. He was born in 1932 in the Basti district of Uttar Pradesh and started his education at Aligarh Muslim University. Later, he earned his Ph.D. from the University of Glasgow, where he studied microbial genetics with Guido Pontecorvo. After that, he did further research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Alan Garen. In 1962, Dr. Siddiqi received an invitation from Homi Bhabha and established the Molecular Biology Unit at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in Mumbai. This was a big moment for biology research in India. Thirty years later, he became the founding director of the TIFR National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore. During his career, Dr. Siddiqi made some groundbreaking discoveries. He worked with Dr. Alan Garen at MIT on \"nonsense\" codons, which are signals that tell cells to stop making proteins. In the early 1970s, he collaborated with Professor Benzer of the California Institute of Technology to identify genes controlling nerve conduction and synaptic transmission. In the 1980s, Dr. Siddiqi and his team at TIFR, Mumbai, made significant strides in understanding the genetic basis of taste and smell in fruit flies. Their work laid the groundwork for how our brains detect and interpret sensory information like taste and smell. Siddiqi was an elected member of the Royal Society, London (FRS), the US National Academy of Sciences, The World Academy of Sciences, Trieste, the Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore (President 1986-89), National Academy of Sciences (India), Allahabad, and Maharashtra Academy of Sciences. He has been honored with Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, Bhatnagar Prize, INSA Golden Jubilee Medal, Birla Samarak Kosh National Award, Goyal Foundation Prize, Aryabhatta Medal by INSA, Bhasin Foundation Prize, Science Congress Plaque of Honours, BC Roy Award for Biomedical Research and Firodia Award for Basic Sciences.

Meet Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy, whose unwavering commitment to improving healthcare, innovative spirit, and dedication to social causes is a testament to extraordinary leadership. He founded and chaired, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, India's first company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001, and his only goal was to provide affordable and innovative medicines for healthier lives. Born in a turmeric farmer’s family in Tadepalli of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh, Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy completed his B.Sc in Pharmaceuticals and Fine Chemicals from Bombay University and later obtained his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the National Chemical Laboratory at Pune in 1969. His inspiration goes to his father as he grew up watching him make herbal pills and distribute them without charging any penny to the needy ones. After completing his Ph.D., he worked in the state-run Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Ltd from 1969 to 1975. Inspired to make affordable medicines, he turned entrepreneur and established Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in 1984, which eventually became a prominent pharmaceutical company in India. The company started with methyldopa, a hypertension drug, in 1985. Its success was followed by an initial public offering in 1986 that raised ₹ 2.46 crore. In 1993, it became the first company to take up drug discovery research in India. He also founded Dr. Reddy's Foundation in 1996, which aimed to provide access to quality education and develop skills for young disadvantaged individuals to meet modern-day challenges. A significant portion of the funds allocated by Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy and his company has been dedicated to supporting initiatives that address crucial social issues such as hunger alleviation, livelihood creation, education, and access to safe drinking water. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is actively funding an initiative that promotes the study of pure sciences in India. The aim of this initiative is to foster scientific education and research in the country, with the ultimate goal of producing a Nobel laureate in one of the pure sciences. For his contributions to the Indian pharmaceutical industry, the Indian Government honored him with the Padma Shri in 2001 and the Padma Bhushan in 2011.

How? Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee was the first student to be awarded a dual degree (MA in Mathematics and Physics) from University of Calcutta and today's story is about his contribution to science and education in India. Asutosh Mookerjee was born on June 29, 1864. His dad, Gangaprasad, was a well-known doctor, and his mom, Jagattarini Devi, was a homemaker. Brought up in an atmosphere of science & literature at home, young Asutosh went to the Sisu Vidyalaya at Chakraberia, Bhowanipore, and showed an early aptitude for mathematics. In 1879, Asutosh passed the entrance exam and got the second position. He then joined Presidency College (now Presidency University, Kolkata) in Kolkata in the F.A. class. One of his classmates was Narendranath Dutta, who later became known as Swami Vivekananda. In 1881, he passed the F.A. examination and ranked third. In 1884, he came in first in the B.A. examination, earning scholarships and prizes. He also excelled in the M.A. examinations in both mathematics and physics in 1885 and 1886. Asutosh was the first student at Calcutta University to pass the M.A. examination in more than one subject. During his time in the F.A. class, Asutosh wrote a paper about a mathematical concept known as the 25th proposition in the first volume of Euclid’s Elements. Asutosh focused on geometry and elliptic functions in his research, publishing several papers between 1887 and 1889, mainly on differential equations of conics. In 1888, Dr. Mahendralal Sarkar, the founder of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), invited Asutosh to give lectures on scientific topics to post-graduate students. Asutosh continued this until 1891 when he got busier with his work in law. He established the University Law College in Kolkata in 1909. Then, in 1914, he founded the The Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA) to promote scientific research in India. Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee was responsible for the foundation of the @Bengal Technical Institute in 1906 and the College of Science of Calcutta University in 1914. The Calcutta Mathematical Society was also founded by Mukherjee in 1908 and he served as the president of the Society from 1908 to 1923. He also established Asutosh College in 1916. In 1910, he became the President of the Imperial (now National) Library Council. He generously donated his personal collection of 80,000 books, which are now organized in a dedicated section.

He traveled to over 3000 schools, demonstrating captivating science experiments to bring out the scientists of tomorrow. Today's story is about Arvind Gupta, who uses everyday garbage as the building blocks of these experiments to make science fun. He takes trash and creates unforgettable experiments and experiences for children. His goal is to show that science isn't about memorizing definitions and formulas, but about understanding and creativity. He has created 6,200 short films on toy-making in the last 35 years. These films are available on his website and YouTube in 18 languages. He also distributes CD’s packed with a massive collection of ebooks and videos to the schools he visits. Arvind Gupta was born in Bareilly to a simple business family, with parents who didn't have the opportunity to attend school. Despite this, he excelled in school and was later admitted to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, where he spent five years gaining knowledge from both his studies and his peers. During his time at IIT, he and his friends engaged in the construction of various working models. Although Gupta initially worked for two years at TELCO after completing his education at IIT, he found the work unsatisfactory. This led him to join the Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme (HSTP) in Madhya Pradesh for six months. The program focused on reinvigorating science education by encouraging a discovery-based approach. Gupta has often stressed the misconception that science is exclusively confined to high-tech laboratories, emphasizing the importance of demonstrating scientific concepts through everyday objects. His website showcases an array of toys crafted from readily available materials, serving both as entertainment and educational tools for children. Gupta has authored several books in thirteen Indian languages, focusing on science education and children's literature. Currently, he is actively involved in various educational initiatives, including the Muktangan Science Exploratorium at @IUCAA, encouraging children to engage in hands-on experiments and exploration. Arvind Gupta firmly believes that every child has an inner scientist waiting to be unleashed. Give them an idea, and watch as they transform and elevate it to greater heights. Gupta has been recognized by organizations such as UNESCO, UNICEF, International Toy Research Association, Boston Science Centre, Walt Disney Imagineering and Research.
