It is full of fascinating and enlightening stories told brilliantly by a Nobel laureate who not only excels as a scientist but also is outstanding as a research manager.” —Hiroshi Inose, Director General, National Center for Science Information System, Tokyo, Japan In one short human generation, the primary work of the world has moved from the use of muscle to the use of machines, machines that move information rather than goods. We live in the age of the information revolution. That revolution centers upon the computer, a machine of unquestioned power but questionable intelligence and competence. At heart, after all, computers are nothing more than souped-up pocket calculators which can push their own buttons. As such, they provide an electronic means for speeding up the basic operations of arithmetic—simple operations which enough pencils and paper could handle. Speed makes all the difference. And yet this speed has altered the world. Arno Penzias has written this book to demystify the computer and to explain the relationship of human beings and the human brain to the new electronic world.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393333213/?tag=2022091-20"
