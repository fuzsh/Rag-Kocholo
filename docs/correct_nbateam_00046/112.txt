Gerald Wallace was a fan favorite and the best player from the Charlotte Bobcats’ short-lived tenure. The Bobcats had some rough times, but Wallace helped lead them to one of their only postseason appearances. He was also the franchise’s only All-Star, and made an All-Defensive team as well. His high energy, hard-playing, and incredible athleticism made him a beloved figure. Let’s make sure he’s honored appropriately by hanging his jersey in the rafters.
