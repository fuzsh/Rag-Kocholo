CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Gerald Wallace scored 26 points, set a franchise record with 17 free throws made and had a key steal late as the Charlotte Bobcats rallied to beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 113-110 on Monday night.

The Bobcats, who at 0-4 entered as the NBA's only winless team at home, appeared finished when they trailed 107-99 with 2:08 left. But Wallace and Stephen Jackson, who also scored 26 points, led Charlotte's comeback.

Wallace's two free throws with 31.6 seconds left put Charlotte ahead to stay.

Wesley Johnson missed two free throws with 3.5 seconds and Minnesota trailing.

Michael Beasley scored 28 points, but had two key turnovers in the closing minutes. Kevin Love had 20 points and nine rebounds, returning to the game late after a scary fall.

It was a much-needed win for Charlotte, with owner Michael Jordan squirming in his courtside seat in the frantic final minute before his top players came through.

Wallace didn't get his first field goal until midway through the third quarter, but hit 17-of-19 free throws to set a team record.
