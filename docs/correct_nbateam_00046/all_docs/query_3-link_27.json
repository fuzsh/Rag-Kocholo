        "text": "Brooklyn Nets small forward Gerald Wallace has been fined $5,000 by the NBA for committing his second violation of the league's anti-flopping rules, the league announced Wednesday. He is the second NBA player to receive a flopping fine this season, following in the footsteps of trail-blazing teammate Reggie Evans, who two weeks ago became the first victim of the league's new method of penalizing players who exaggerate or simulate contact in an attempt to draw phantom fouls against their opponents.\n\nWallace received his first warning from the NBA's disciplinary office last Thursday, stemming from this play against Carmelo Anthony late in overtime during the Nets' 96-89 win over the New York Knicks on Nov. 26:\n\nThe second violation — which, in accordance with the NBA's newly instituted anti-flopping policy, triggers an automatic $5,000 fine — came as a result of this defensive play against LeBron James near the end of the third quarter of Brooklyn's 102-89 loss to the Miami Heat on Dec. 1:\n\nNow that he's been dinged twice and compelled to cough up $5,000, Wallace faces escalating penalties for any future flops. A third violation would cost him $10,000, a fourth $15,000 and a fifth $30,000.\n\n\"If a player violates the anti-flopping rule six times or more, he will be subject to discipline that is reasonable under the circumstances, including an increased fine and/or suspension,\" according to an Oct. 3 NBA press release detailing the disciplinary structure of the new anti-flopping policy.\n\nEvans and Wallace are the only two players to date who have been identified as repeat offenders by the NBA. Five others — Donald Sloan of the Cleveland Cavaliers and J.J. Barea of the Minnesota Timberwolves (whom you might remember as the first players called out officially), Kevin Martin of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Patrick Patterson of the Houston Rockets and Chauncey Billups of the Los Angeles Clippers — have received warnings from the league.\n\nWednesday's penalty marks the second fine in less than a week for the Nets' 30-year-old swingman. He received a $35,000 fine last Thursday for his role in the Nov. 28 scuffle between his Nets and the Boston Celtics. Wallace and teammate Kris Humphries were ejected for their roles in that altercation, as was the Celtics' Rajon Rondo, who also received a two-game suspension from the league.\n\nWallace is averaging 9.9 points, 4.4 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.9 steals in 31.5 minutes per game for the 11-6 Nets. He was named to the NBA's All-Defensive First Team in 2010 while a member of the Charlotte Bobcats."
