        "text": "16.1 points, 12.3 rebounds (leading the NBA from the SF position) and 1.6 steals. The Bobcats are 9-11, which is good for 7th in the East as of today. Is he an All-Star reserve if the team keeps winning and he keeps putting up these numbers?\n\nNot necesarily… If anything, Jackson has helped Wallace. He no longer has to be the team’s top offensive option. He plays well off of Jackson on offensive, plus he can focus on doing all the dirty work like rebounding and playing D.\n\nI think he’s on the outside looking in. I think Josh Smith should have the SF spot as a backup. Smith has been more impressive than Wallace from what I’ve seen this year. But Wallace has been a good player for Charlotte this year..\n\nPersonal opinion? Yes, easily. But the NBA All-Star game isn’t the top players from each conference it’s more or less a popularity contest for the fan voting aspect and then a prestige thing when the coaches pick…I hope he makes it though. If he does it will be because of his hustle and the rebounds hes pulling down for his position. I think people are beginning to take notice\n\nWallace is one of those players who won’t really need a lot of offensive touches to score… That’s the good thing about him. He’s sort of like Shawn Marion. He can give you 15+ points without having too many plays ran for him.\n\nTo me he’s a better, more efficient young Marion. I think with the year he’s having on top of the games he had against James and Anthony he’ll sneak in as a reserve. He certainly deserves it.\n\nthe fans that vote are brain-dead pieces of garbage…they have tracy mcgrady being an all-star and the guy hasnt played at all this year, heres how horrible NBA fans are (besides the guys on this site that actually know what theyre talking about)\n\nEast will be:\n\nG-Wade\n\nG-Iverson\n\nC-Shaq\n\nF-Garnett\n\nF-LeBron\n\nwest:\n\nG-Kobe\n\nG-McGrady\n\nC-Yao\n\nF-Duncan\n\nF-Melo\n\ncoach will vote in iggy and wallace we should all vote for them to because there having better years then any forwards in the east\n\nso come on vote for andre and gerald\n\nlets get players who deserve it into the all star game\n\nYou all have made good points. Here’s my assessment……….. Steven Jackson will make the all-star if the Bobcats continue winning instead of Wallace.\n\nDhamp2…the greatest basketball mind in the world. Next to Hubie Brown anyway.\n\nAndy Rautins may be drafted after all….very late in the second round\n\nBring back the Fab 5\n\nSteve Lavin please coach again"
