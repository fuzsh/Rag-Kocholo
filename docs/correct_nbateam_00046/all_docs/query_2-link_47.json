        "text": "WALTHAM — Gerald Wallace was relaxing home at Alabama, playing cards and watching the NBA Draft, when his trade from Brooklyn to Boston was announced on television.\n\nWallace was shocked to say the least. When the Celtics held a press conference in Waltham to introduce the players acquired from Brooklyn, Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks and Keith Bogans showed up, but Wallace did not. He insisted he skipped the press conference because he felt obligated to be at his summer camp. The 6-foot-7 forward didn't speak to Danny Ainge all summer and didn't come to Boston until late last week.\n\n\"I think the main thing,\" Wallace said Monday during Celtics media day at HealthPoint, \"that a lot of people have taken out of this is that I didn't want to come, I didn't want to be here, I didn't want to be a part of it. That's so far from the truth.\"\n\nBut he did admit it took him a while to get used to the trade.\n\n\"This trade kind of caught me off guard,\" he said. \"I didn't see it coming.\"\n\nEntering his 13th NBA season, Wallace wasn't thrilled about leaving Brooklyn, which is expected to contend for the championship with the additions of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Jason Terry from Boston.\n\n\"It's very hard,\" Wallace admitted. \"At 13 years, you never want to go to a team that's starting the rebuilding process. Your main focus is to trying to get somewhere where you can end your career on a championship note. At the same point, I'm here. I'm happy to be here.\"\n\nWallace, 31, has $30 million worth of reasons to be happy. That's what he's owed in salary over the next three seasons.\n\n\"A championship is what I would want to go out with,\" he said, \"but I've never won a championship in my life. So my life isn't based on championships, it's based on having a successful career, having fun and enjoying the game.\"\n\nWallace insisted his shock over the trade had nothing to do with going to Boston, just that he had been traded for the third time in 16 months.\n\n\"I'm actually happy to be here in Boston,\" Wallace said. \"I've always loved the city of Boston and besides I'm a Red Sox and Patriots fan, so I'm closer to my teams.\"\n\nWallace's home state of Alabama has no professional teams so he began rooting for the Patriots because he likes Tom Brady and Bill Belichick and for the Sox because he's a fan of David Ortiz.\n\nWallace even has a room back home filled with Patriots and Red Sox memorabilia, including a couple of Brady jerseys, Super Bowl photos and an autographed bat from Ortiz along with memorabilia from his own NBA career.\n\nLast season with the Nets, Wallace averaged only 7.7 points, far below the 13.8 he averaged the previous year and the first time he averaged less than 11 since he played only 9.1 minutes a game for Sacramento in 2003-04. Wallace attributed his drop-off to playing with Joe Johnson, Deron Williams and Brook Lopez, three All-Stars who averaged a lot of points and minutes.\n\n\"My role on that team wasn't to score,\" he said. \"I think it was to go out every night and guard the opposing team's best player.\"\n\nWallace thinks it would be too much to expect this Celtics team to defend as well as the Celtics did with Garnett.\n\n\"We're still young in the process and on top of that they had a system here,\" Wallace said. \"Doc Rivers had a system. We're coming in with Coach (Brad) Stevens, a new coaching staff and new players and we're all new.\"\n\nWallace was part of not even a rebuilding process, but a building process with Charlotte after he was selected in the 2004 expansion draft.\n\n\"The hardest thing about it,\" he recalled, \"is getting everybody to buy into the team system. You come in with a bunch of young guys who are fresh into the league. They're kind of into their own game. A lot of the guys kind of play for themselves, play for their next contract instead of buying into the team system.\"\n\nWallace kept insisting he was happy to be in Boston, but he wasn't very convincing.\n\nContact Bill Doyle at wdoyle@telegram.com.
