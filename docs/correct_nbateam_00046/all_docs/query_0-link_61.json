        "text": "TRAIL BLAZERS ACQUIRE GERALD WALLACE IN EXCHANGE FOR PRZYBILLA, CUNNINGHAM AND MARKS\n\nPortland also sends two conditional first round picks to Charlotte\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. - The Portland Trail Blazers have acquired forward Gerald Wallace from the Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for center Joel Przybilla, forward Dante Cunningham, forward/center Sean Marks, a 2011 conditional first round pick acquired from New Orleans and a conditional 2013 first round pick, it was announced today by General Manager Rich Cho.\n\n\"I want to welcome Gerald to the Trail Blazers,\" said Trail Blazers Owner Paul Allen . \"He is just the sort of talent we were looking for. I'm sure our fans will embrace him and hopefully he can help us make some noise in the playoffs.\n\n\"I also want to thank Joel, Dante and Sean. Joel has been a warrior for this franchise over the past six and 1/2 seasons and Dante has played an important role in the success this team has had this season.\"\n\nWallace, 28, posted averages of 15.6 points, 8.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.23 steals, 1.00 blocked shots and 39.0 minutes in 48 games (all starts) with the Bobcats this season. He scored 20 points or more 17 times and recorded 14 double-doubles.\n\n\"I'd like to thank Joel, Dante and Sean for their hard work and professionalism while in Portland,\" said Cho. \"We are very excited to add a player of Gerald Wallace's caliber to the roster and feel that his athletic, defensive-minded style of play will be a great fit for us.\"\n\nWallace (6-7, 220) was named to the 2010 Eastern Conference All-Star Team and the 2009-10 All-Defensive First Team. In nine-plus seasons with Charlotte and Sacramento, Wallace holds career averages of 13.4 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.49 steals, 0.96 blocks and 30.5 minutes in 592 games (453 starts).\n\nWallace was originally selected with the 25th overall pick by the Sacramento Kings in the 2001 NBA Draft after his freshman season at the University of Alabama. Charlotte acquired Wallace during its expansion draft in 2004.\n\n\"Gerald is one of the top defenders in our league, and a player who brings energy and effort to the floor every night,\" said Trail Blazers Head Coach Nate McMillan. \"I also want to acknowledge how great Joel, Dante and Sean have been for us, and I wish them all the best moving forward.\n\n\"Joel has been in Portland with me during my entire time here, and he really helped guide the organization in a new direction. He brought heart and a toughness that resonated with our fans and was a great example for our younger players.\"\n\nPrzybilla returned this season on Dec. 3 after recovering from double-right knee surgery and averaged 1.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and 14.4 minutes in 31 games (nine starts). In 395 games over seven seasons with the Trail Blazers, Przybilla averaged 4.8 points (57.8 FG), 7.3 rebounds and 1.54 blocks per game. He ranks fifth on Portland's all-time list with 606 career blocked shots.\n\nDante Cunningham played in 119 games (11 starts) for the Trail Blazers from 2009-11, averaging 4.4 points and 3.0 rebounds in 15.3 minutes. He posted averages of 5.1 points, 3.4 rebounds and 19.8 minutes in 56 games for Portland this season.\n\nSean Marks averaged 1.6 points, 1.4 rebounds and 7.2 minutes in 29 games for the Trail Blazers this season, his first in Portland.\n\nThe move brings Portland's roster to 13 players. Wallace will wear No. 3 with the Trail Blazers."
