        "text": "Gerald Wallace media day.jpg\n\nA camera records video of Boston Celtics forward Gerald Wallace while speaking to reporters during the team's NBA basketball media day in Waltham, Mass., Monday, Sept. 30, 2013.\n\n(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nBOSTON – When Boston Celtics head coach Brad Stevens informed Gerald Wallace he would not be starting Wednesday night, the 31-year old forward did not know exactly how to feel.\n\n“I wouldn’t say not happy, I’d just say kind of confused,” said Wallace. “It’s the first time since I was traded to Portland (in Feb. of 2011) and came off the bench two or three games for them that I’ve actually come off the bench. I was trying to figure it out; it’s a new experience for me.”\n\nWallace actually came off the bench eight times in Portland. But entering Wednesday night’s meeting with the Utah Jazz, he had still started 590 of his previous 608 games. So it was only natural for him to be surprised by Stevens’ move, especially after leading the Celtics in minutes over the first four games – all of which he started.\n\n“(Stevens) said he was going to try Jordan (Crawford) at the point guard and see how that goes,” explained Wallace after scoring nine points with nine rebounds and three assists. \"(He said) to come off the bench and try to bring some energy, play with the second unit with Kelly (Olynyk) and (Jared Sullinger), and hopefully things would work out.”\n\nThings worked out well. The Celtics quickly fell behind 16-3 – “we came out with our feet in concrete,” explained Wallace – but, midway through the first quarter, launched a 53-18 barrage spurred largely by the second unit. Despite another uneven fourth quarter, Boston (1-4) prevailed 97-87 for its first win of the season.\n\nThe Wallace-Olynyk-Sullinger trio, which Stevens has touted as a powerful combination since the very first preseason game, had only played 11 minutes over the first four games. But with all three coming off the bench in the first quarter, they just about matched that total in one night. Over 10 minutes, according to NBA.com, they outscored the Jazz by 14 points – actually doubling up their opponents, 28-14.\n\n“I told Gerald this … I thought (Sullinger and Olynyk), with their ability to pass and stretch the floor, would open up some driving lanes for him and some plays for him,” said Stevens. “I thought those three guys complement each other pretty well, so I kind of made up my mind (before the game) that we were going to go with Gerald off the bench and go from there.”\n\n“It gives us more opportunities to run up and down the court,” said Wallace, who had eight points and seven rebounds in the first half, quickly making his mark. “Those guys are more going to the basket. They like to play with their backs to the basket and they run the court pretty well, and they’re also great passers. Playing with those guys is always fun.”\n\nThe veteran said he did not know anything about the famous sixth men in Celtics franchise history, which include John Havlicek, Bill Walton and Kevin McHale.\n\n“I’m more like the seventh man, though,” he quipped.\n\nAnd for now, at least, he’s okay with that. Maybe in the past he would have argued with Stevens – but after sounding a little, well, confused, during a pregame interview with the Boston Globe, Wallace was nothing but positive after the 10-point win.\n\n“My main thing is trying to figure out where I fit in and my role and my situation, but I think I pretty much know that now,” he said. “I’ll move forward, continue to play and do my role. Coming off the bench, especially for me this late in my career, is pretty good. I don’t think I can average 30, 35, 40 minutes anymore. I think those days are gone, but coming in, playing a hard 25 minutes is good for me. I’m able to help my teammates out, and I played pretty good with the second unit. It helps our team a whole lot bringing energy off the bench.”\n\n“You can’t be mad after (a win),\" he added. \"We got our first win with (the new lineup). I think the whole shocking part about it was that it’s new to me. This is my 13th season. Other than being on the bench my first three years in Sacramento, I’ve always been a starter. I’ve busted my butt to be a starter, to try to be productive in that starting unit. This is the first year I have to come off the bench, so it’s a new process. It’s often confusing when something new is thrown at you in the start, but who knows? This might be the best thing for my career.”\n\nStevens, who also singled out Phil Pressey for his energy off the bench, thinks it could help too.\n\n“The best teams that I’ve been a part of have had sparks off the bench,” said the coach. “The energy level has actually gone up or at least on a really good night stayed the same. And I think that’s what happened.”\n\nWallace has been vocal at times in criticizing his team so far this season, calling for more effort and unselfishness. But two of the longer-tenured Celtics – Avery Bradley and Jeff Green – said they want to follow his lead.\n\n\"True professional,\" said Green. \"He still came to work, the minutes he played were big. The defense that he had and the energy he gave us, he was the reason we got the lead that we got. For him to be told probably ... that he wasn't going to start, and then came out and play the way he did, he's just a true professional. We have to try to feed off what he does. He's one of our leaders and he shows a lot of heart when he's playing.\"\n\nStarter or otherwise, Wallace only knows how to play full speed.\n\n“You can’t change the way I play,” he said. “I’m going to play that way if I’m at home playing with my kids.”\n\nDear young children, don't play basketball against the man they call Crash. Even if he becomes a very valuable seventh man."
