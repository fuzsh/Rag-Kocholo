        "text": "Chris Chambers/Getty Images\n\nWhy is it important for NBA players to remain professional at all times?\n\nBeing professional might allow for a longer professional basketball career, and one may get a better reputation for being able to remain positive no matter the situation at hand.\n\nThe NBA has shown that it is a business first. Players can be traded, waived and/or released at almost any time, so being able to make the best out of any situation is a great attribute to have.\n\nThe NBA should show their fans more examples of how being able to adjust into different situations is something that not all players can do.\n\nOne name that comes to mind is veteran forward Gerald Wallace of the New Jersey Nets.\n\nWallace started the season with the Portland Trail Blazers but was dealt to the Nets at the trade deadline in exchange for the contracts of Shawne Williams and Mehmet Okur (since waived) along with a 2012 protected first-round draft pick.\n\nWallace is averaging 15.5 points to go along with 6.7 rebounds per game with New Jersey in his 11th NBA season.\n\nWallace has a player option for next season (worth around $11.4 million), which brings up the question of whether he is going to hang around in New Jersey/Brooklyn next season, or take less money to sign with a contender.\n\nWallace has been on the rebuilding platform before when he was with the Bobcats for almost six-and-a-half years, where he became an all-around leader on a young team searching for their identity.\n\nWallace may be willing to do it once again with the Nets and would be a great role model for the younger players on the team."
