        "text": "Chris Chambers/Getty Images\n\nGerald Wallace has reportedly made up his mind to decline his $9.5 million player option and become a free agent.\n\nThe explosive small forward started the season with the Portland Trail Blazers before being traded to the Brooklyn Nets before the deadline in exchange for a 2012 protected first-round draft pick, Shawne Williams and Mehmet Okur, who was later waived.\n\nWallace was a key member of the Trail Blazers, averaging 13.3 points and 6.1 rebounds in 42 games, but was moved when the team decided to rebuild.\n\nWith the Nets, Wallace appeared in 16 games and upped his averages to 15.2 points and 6.8 rebounds per game while providing a veteran presence on the floor and in the locker room.\n\nAlthough injuries have been a big part of his NBA career thus far (most notably concussions), Wallace has found a way to continue playing hard every night.\n\nIt appears that Wallace is ready to explore all of his options come free agency and will likely make a push for a multi-year contract. Without the concerns of an expiring contract, he would be able to dedicate all of his focus to the game of basketball.\n\nWallace would be a great fit on a veteran team trying to make a run at a championship or on a young team in need of leadership in the locker room. Any team seeking a scoring boost and a versatile defender would be lucky to have him."
