        "text": "The Nets have won their past 4 of 5 games. I might be slightly biased as Gerald Wallace is my fav current nba player.\n\nBasketball is more than just stats – the intangibles. Heart / big motor, team work, defence, sacrificing your body, making that extra pass, setting that screen, positive leadership both on and off the court.\n\n1 good player can make a difference, scoring and stats don’t count for everything – just ask melo and the knicks…..\n\nI caught the end of the Warriors Nets game (3-30-12) and the Nets defense was very very impressive. Shout out to the Avery. I remember it was a 1pt game in the final minute and the Nets really locked up on D. I think they had a block, forced a TO and got a steal in the warriors final 3 possessions.\n\nI haven’t watched them all year until a few days ago but I actually like this team. Deshawn Stevenson plays so hard on D, it’s contagious, I like how he takes matchups personally. Gerald Wallace is the same way. Humphries is a bundle of energy crashing boards, blocking shots, doin the dirty work. Then you have Gerald Green who has a chip on his shoulder playing as hard and as focused as he possibly can. His O has been suprisingly nice. Deron had 20 asts the other night…smh. I credit them for playing the right way even though they won’t make the playoffs.\n\nI think his attitude and hard work has def brought a fresh positive vibe, but will it last? Especially with that weak roster, dunno. Nets could be very very bad next year with Williams gone, and Lopez still somewhat of an enigma as far as how good is he and if he can stay on the court. Not to mention they may not have a pick this year, lol they might want to stop winning games if they want to get better.\n\nI don’t think they’re in a position to tank right now. They have a legit superstar, and everytime you have one, you do everything you can to keep him. That’s the whole reason they traded away their pick in the first place. That’s why despite them having relatively low odds to make the playoffs this season, they’re trying to win as much as possible to convince D Will that this team is capable of winning.\n\nbecause if you are paying Wallace (a free agent) and DWill then you dont have enough money for Dwight anyway. They still have other contracts like Farmers that arent going anywhere. I would have made Portland or whoever take a non expiring contract also. They have ample cap so they could have signed him in the offseason while keeping potentially Thomas Robinson at 4 or 5. It seems idiotic to keep winning with such a high pick on the line. You have to sit DWill but he probably wont because he wants to finish the season healthy for the first time in a while. It only made sense if they tank this year, I m talking like two wins after all star break at most. Then gave Portland a 18th pick next year because they would be solid with DWill, Brooks, Wallace, Humpries/Robinson and or Drummonds/ Lopez. If they kept pick then picked Drummond or Robison then Orlando would be more inclined next year to do a locked up Lopez between 7 and 9 million for 4 years, Robinson (a athletic David West and great kid), Brooks and another pick. Who else was trading Orlando a starting 2, 4 and 5 all at rookie deals and a you-signed-after-a-injury plagued-season-so-we-got-a-discount-Lopez-deal.\n\nA lot of people thought that Wallace trade was bad for NJ. I was not one of those. Wallace brings his a-game and winning attitude. Hell, he was sooo instrumental in the Bobcats getting in the playoffs. I dont know why, but it just seems like Thomas Robinson is the perfect fit for this team. Maybe its because of all the guys yall mentioned that are playing with heart and intensity. T-Rob is not the most talented guy in the draft, but he plays hard with a ton of heart.\n\nI dont know how good Brooks will be on defense but offensively, he’s got the package. He is a pretty good passer….something that may be overlooked.\n\nGerald Wallace was a good trade for the nets. people seem to forget he was a allstar 2 years ago and The Great Michael Jordan traded him away! The nets can sneak into the oplayoffs next year if we keep wallace and williams stay. i think they should draft Andre Drummond cuz who knows if Humphries will stey he should get a good offer this summer with his play this year.They also gotta keep Gerald Green next year this guy has also been a very good pick up for the Nets. I am almost certian if we let him walk a team will pick him up asap! Billy King sign Gerald Green to that 2 year deal you have been talking about!!"
