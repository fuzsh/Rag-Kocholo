        "text": "KSRCollege.com’s John Michael Holzapfel discusses the best comparison for MKG’s NBA career:\n\nGrantland.com’s Bill Simmons compared Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s NBA potential as a hybrid between Scottie Pippen and Gerald Wallace. My question is simple…. Is he on to something?\n\nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist demonstrated an above-average basketball IQ while playing as a freshman in John Calipari’s drive and kick offense. He can pass, penetrate and play above the rim. His competitive nature sets him apart from other players. In fact, I don’t remember the last time anyone associated with the Kidd didn’t mention his ability to compete at an almost super-human level. Which begs the question, how high is the ceiling for this 6’7” defensive mastermind? He has already proven to be a big-time player in the clutch situations (See the late 3 he hit vs. my Tennessee Vols for reference) and he’s won championships at both the high school and college levels.\n\nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist’s defensive tenacity is second to none. He does everything necessary to get wins. Gerald Wallace is the kind of player capable of scoring 15, doling out 4-5 assists, grabbing 8-9 rebounds all the while picking a few pockets along the way. This mode of stat-sheet stuffing is what UK fans should expect from MKG at the NBA level.\n\nAnother aspect of Kidd-Gilchrist’s game is his ability to get up the court in transition. There are few players with the instincts and athleticism to turn a defensive rebound into a transition bucket as quickly as the Kidd. A skill that will be heavily utilized in the NBA.\n\nWhy do you think the ultra-competitive MJ took him second overall? (Sincere apologies to Rich Cho, the GM who will get the least amount of credit for making the right pick in this draft.)\n\nBut where exactly is the Scottie Pippen aspect in all of this?\n\nFirst, we need to discuss Scottie Pippen the basketball player. Why is he a Hall of Famer?\n\nQuite simply, he was the ideal wingman in MJ’s dominant reign. He was a 6’8” SF with vision, athleticism, high IQ and the ability to run the point (for all intents and purposes) in Phil Jackson’s triangle offense in Chicago.\n\nHe’d knock down shots if teams left him open. He could beat you off the dribble. Even shut down your second best perimeter scorer. Basically, this man was a super-sized classical point guard playing small forward. Whereas he wasn’t likely to put up 30 points in the system, he was able to do the “little things” Chicago needed. He was a box score machine in his own right.\n\nCan Kidd-Gilchrist be that in the league? The jury is still out. While in Lexington, the Kidd showed his ability to be one BMFer (channeling Samuel L. Jackson), but sometimes it was hard to put your finger on exactly what he was doing to change the game. Yes, there were the obvious things, from him eating his opponent alive on the defensive end to his ability to get into the lane on offense. But really, he just seemed to come up with the right play at the perfect time game after game.\n\nMichael Kidd-Gilchrist will probably prove Simmons’ hybrid analogy correct. It’s hard not to see the Kidd becoming a more refined version of Gerald Wallace at the next level."
