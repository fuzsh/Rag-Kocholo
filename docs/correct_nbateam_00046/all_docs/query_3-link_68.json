He started 63 games last season, averaging 6.1 points and 6.5 rebounds. He became a Sixer, technically, July 9, along with Nik Stauskas and Carl Landry in a complicated trade that sent prospects Arturas Gudaitis and Luca Mitrovic to the Kings. In that deal, the Sixers also secured the right to swap first-round drafting position with Sacramento in either 2016 or 2017.\n\nWallace has averaged 12 points and six rebounds in his 832-game NBA career. He was a 2001 first-round draft choice of the Kings, the 25th pick overall. In 2010, the Alabama product was an NBA All-Star. He appeared in three of the Celtics’ final 11 games last season, when he averaged 1.1 points and 1.8 rebounds.\n\nWhether he plays for the Sixers or is cut, Wallace will be on the final year of a four-year contract that is still due $10.1 million. Thompson was signed through the 2017 season at $6.5 million per year.\n\nOriginally Published: July 31, 2015 at 6:23 p.m."
