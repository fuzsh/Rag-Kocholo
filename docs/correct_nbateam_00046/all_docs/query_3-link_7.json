        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A tremendous athlete who is one of the Leagues premier perimeter defenders. Plays multiple positions for Charlotte, sometimes as a Shawn Marion-esqe power forward even. Possesses great strength, quickness, and leaping ability and shows a true dedication on the defense end. Uses his athleticism to make an impact on the offensive end. Won the Naismith Player of the Year Award as a senior at Childersburg HS. Spent only one season at Alabama before going pro. Still developing on the offensive end. Does the little things as well as anyone in the game.\n\nOffense: Gets a quarter of his offense from spot up situations, with a combined thirty percent coming from isolation and transition opportunities. Uses his athleticism extremely well on the offensive end, elevating over defenders when he attacks the rim. Seldom pulls up for jumpers off the dribble, partially due to his ball-handling skills but also because of how easy it is for him to beat his man to the basket. Doesnt have bad form on his jumper, but he doesnt always set his feet as well as he should. Shoots the ball from the opposite shoulder, but puts good touch on the ball from the outside. Has improved in the aspect of the game significantly since entering the League. An average shot-creator, but sometimes gets too aggressive attacking the rim. A little turnover prone. Shows good court vision and passing, and needs to keep his head up at all times to avoid dribbling into traffic.\n\nDefense: Simply one of the best defensive players in the League. Works extremely hard, and doesnt take plays off. Leaping ability makes him one of the best weak-side shot blocking guards in the game, and he has the speed and quickness to play in passing lanes. Can create turnovers, but doesnt take unnecessary risks, and gets his steals and blocks in the flow of the game. Thats what makes him such an impressive player."
