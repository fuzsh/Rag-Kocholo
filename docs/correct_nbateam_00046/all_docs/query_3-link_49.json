        "text": "Bob Myers pulled off a good deal when he managed to shed David Lee for alowersalary player — Gerald Wallace — without giving up any other Warriors assets. On Friday, Myers made that deal even sweeter by flipping Wallace to a 76ers team still searching for ways to reach the League salary medium. In return, the Warriors get Jason Thompson — a player who, unlike Wallace, should be able to carve out a role in the rotation. It won’t be a big role; the team effectively upgraded their 11th man (or 12th, depending on how highly you value James Michael McAdoo). But in a Western Conference where the best teams got a lot better this off-season, it’s nice to see the Warriors not simply standing around admiring their championship hardware.\n\nNo analysis of the Lee to Wallace to Thompson transition is complete without following the money. The Warriors’ luxury tax bill is the instigating force in the transactions, but Myers has shown off his Executive of the Year chops by simultaneously saving his boss money and improving the team. The Warriors’ luxury tax bill with Lee on the roster was roughly $38 million. The Wallace trade (assuming he wasn’t stretched) dropped that amount down to $24 million. Flipping Wallace for Thompson leaves the current bill at around $16 million. In addition to saving Joe Lacob and his co-owners around $22 million, the deals also spun off trade exceptions of around $5 million and $3 million. The Warriors may not use them given their financial shape, but it never hurts to stockpile potentially useful resources.\n\nThe only salary concern in the Thompson deal is whether the 2016-17 commitment will hamstring the Warriors’ flexibility next off-season. Fortunately, of Thompson’s $6.8 million final year, only $2 million and change is guaranteed, giving the Warriors as much flexibility next year as if they had stretched Wallace’s contract (although not quite as much as if they had simply let Wallace’s deal expire). Thompson’s extra year — beyond what Lee or Wallace were owed — may cause armchair GMs a bit of heartburn in their hypothetical Durant-to-the-Warriors scenarios. But giving up $2 million in cap flexibility next off-season for a $22 million savings this season is a no-brainer for those actually footing the bill.\n\nMoney aside, I like the basketball aspects of the trade. I was working off the assumption that Wallace’s body was done, so anything Thompson can provide will be an upgrade over nothing. But even in comparison with Lee, Thompson may be a better fit for the Warriors’ current needs.\n\nUltimately, the Warriors’ trade for Thompson feels a lot like last season’s signing of Leandro Barbosa. The Warriors are getting an end-of-the-rotation player with a far-from-perfectgame, but also some distinctive skills that fit obvious needs. Thompson isn’t as good at any one thing as Barbosa is at penetrating. But Thompson — like Barbosa — brings a veteran’s sense of knowing his role, and a few offensive skills that others on the Warriors’ roster lack. Thompson — like Barbosa — won’t be a player who contributes every night, but I expect there will be several games this season when Kerr and his coaching staff will be very happy to have him as an option. As the Warriors’ learned last season, depth isn’t so much about having the most talent possible on paper, but about having interchangeable piecescapable of sharing the load across the 82-game slog of the regular season. Every productive minute Thompson logs will be a minute where someone higher up the depth chart — Bogut, Ezeli, Green, Barnes, Speights — is able to stay healthy and rested. Come June, as the Warriors learned, all of those minutes add up."
