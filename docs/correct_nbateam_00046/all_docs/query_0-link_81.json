        "text": "But ask the veterans on a team that has been tagged to lose, and the subject is grating, going against the way most professional athletes are wired. “I don’t know about that,” said Celtics forward Gerald Wallace, who has played in this kind of environment before, specifically as part of the 2004-05 Bobcats. “We only won (18) games, and there was talk of losing to get higher up in the draft, but we wanted to win every game, play hard every game, and try to prove ourselves in this league. Nobody wants to lose, regardless of what the coach or the organization wants to do.” That hasn’t changed, even if Wallace has often been withering in criticism of his new Celtics teammates. “Nah. These guys don’t want to lose,” he said.\n\nPrior to Monday night’s game against the Orlando Magic at TD Garden, Wallace seemed relieved that his worst fears about this season were not being realized after all. “Guys are understanding what it takes to win as a team,” he said amid a three-game win streak entering Monday night’s action. “I think the atmosphere of winning is becoming more and more in the locker room. We’re playing great ball. Guys are understanding what they need to do out on the court, individually and as a team, to win. It’s sharing the ball and helping each other defensively. I think we’re doing a great job of that now.”\n\n“I told Gerald this … I thought (Sullinger and Olynyk), with their ability to pass and stretch the floor, would open up some driving lanes for him and some plays for him,” said Stevens. “I thought those three guys complement each other pretty well, so I kind of made up my mind (before the game) that we were going to go with Gerald off the bench and go from there.”"
