        "text": "BOSTON - They had been trying to deal away Gerald Wallace almost since the day he was acquired in the summer of 2013.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the Celtics were finally able to make that happen, cutting ties with a veteran who has a hefty contract and rarely played.\n\nThey found a taker for Wallace, who was paid $10.1 million last season while playing only 32 games and scoring a grand total of 35 points.\n\nThe NBA champion Golden State Warriors sent forward David Lee and his $15.5 million contract to the Celtics for Wallace.\n\nWhile the Warriors have trimmed their payroll by more than $5 million to help with the luxury tax, the Celtics have picked up a 32-year-old forward who can take care of a glaring weakness – rebounding.\n\nLee has averaged 14.7 points and 9.5 rebounds in 695 games over 10 seasons. He is a capable outside shooter who can score inside as well.\n\nIn his first four seasons with the Warriors after leaving the New York Knicks for a six-year, $79.5 million contract, Lee put up some impressive numbers.\n\nHe averaged 16.5 points and 9.8 rebounds, 20.1 points and 9.6 rebounds, 18.5 points and 11.2 rebounds and 18.2 points and 9.3 rebounds.\n\nLast season, however, things changed dramatically for Lee.\n\nHe suffered a left hamstring injury in the final preseason game and sat out 24 of the first 25 games. Draymond Green replaced Lee in the starting lineup and never left.\n\nThe Warriors found success with a smaller lineup that featured outside shooting. Lee averaged 18.4 minutes, 7.9 points and 5.2 rebounds in 49 games, mostly off the bench.\n\nLee was effective in two games against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. He had nine points and five rebounds, providing a spark in a Game 5 victory.\n\nPresident of basketball operations Danny Ainge is likely not done with trades. His frontcourt has become crowded, just like the backcourt.\n\nThe Celtics have agreed to terms with Toronto Raptors free agent Amir Johnson, and he joins Lee, Kelly Olynyk, Jared Sullinger, Tyler Zeller and Jonas Jerebko at the power forward or center spots.\n\nSomething has got to give, and Ainge will be trying to make more moves that should also involve the backcourt.\n\nWallace, who turns 33 this month, joined the Celtics as part of the deal that sent Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett to the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nGiven the fact the Celtics were getting three first-round draft picks from the Nets, they had to take Wallace off Brooklyn’s hands. He had three years remaining on a contract that was still worth $30 million at the time.\n\nWallace played 90 games in two seasons for the Celtics, making 16 starts, and he averaged 3.7 points.\n\nThe Warriors will be the seventh team for Wallace, who became a well-respected mentor for the Celtics’ players during his two seasons.\n\nWallace rarely complained about his lack of playing time, dealing with his role as a true professional.\n\nThe Celtics had to carry his contract for two years, but now the Warriors will be paying Wallace.\n\nIn return, the Celtics get a player who won a championship last month and is certainly hungry for an increased role after being squeezed out of the Warriors’ starting lineup.\n\nLee is playing for his next and perhaps final contract with free agency looming next summer, and the Celtics should be getting some solid production out of the former NBA All-Star."
