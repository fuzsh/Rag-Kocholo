        "text": "David Lee, a former All-Star for the Warriors who accepted a bench role on their NBA championship team, is reportedly headed to the Boston Celtics in a trade for Gerald Wallace that was agreed upon Tuesday.\n\nThe swap of 32-year-old forwards was a cost-cutting move for the Warriors, who unloaded their highest-paid player. The Warriors are expected to exceed the luxury tax threshold next season when Lee was owed $15.5 million in the final year of his contract.\n\nWallace, who averaged 8.9 minutes in only 32 games last season, will make $10.1 million in the last year of his contract and could be waived.\n\nThe deal also could allow Lee to play more minutes after his career low in starts came last season.\n\n“Bob Myers worked very hard with me to try and get David to a place he wanted to be,” Mark Bartlestein, Lee’s agent, told TNT’s David Aldridge. “Boston is a great basketball town, great history with that franchise. It’s an up-and-coming team.\n\n“Every player wants to go where they can have a huge impact on a team’s success.”\n\nOn Instagram Lee wrote, “Much Love for the Bay and for the Warriors and I’m truly blessed to have been a part of it.”\n\nLee, one of the first major free agents to land with the Warriors in recent years, became the first to depart their championship team. In recent days, the Warriors agreed to deals to bring back Draymond Green, Marreese Speights and Leandro Barbosa.\n\nThe sign-and-trade deal with the New York Knicks in 2010 brought Lee to the Bay Area with six-year, $80 million contract. In five seasons with the Warriors, he averaged 16.7 points and 9.3 rebounds and went to the All-Star game in 2013. Lee wrote that they were the best five years of his life.\n\n“The journey from a 23 win team to NBA Champs is one I’ll never forget,” Lee wrote. “Thanks to the most loyal fans in basketball for supporting me the entire way!”\n\nThe championship season marked a time for Lee to step aside. When he missed time at the start of the season because of a hamstring injury, Green stepped into the lineup and proved to be indispensable.\n\nLee never publicly complained about losing his spot in the lineup and rotation, drawing praise from coach Steve Kerr for the example that was set. He ultimately played key minutes in the final four games of the NBA Finals.\n\nKnowing his days as a Warrior were likely over, Lee even treated his teammates to a celebratory trip to Las Vegas after the championship was won.\n\n“Wish my big bro @Dlee042 nothing but the best and I appreciate you showing me the way Champ!!!” Green tweeted. “Much love.”"
