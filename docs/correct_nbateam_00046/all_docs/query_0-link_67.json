Randy Foye scored 19 points in his hometown, but the Clippers' four-game winning streak was snapped.\n\nRaptors 108, Pacers 98\n\nTORONTO -- Leandro Barbosa scored a season-high 29 points, Ed Davis had 12 points and 13 rebounds and the Toronto Raptors beat the Pacers.\n\nThe Pacers lost their sixth straight overall and dropped into a tie with Charlotte for the final playoff spot in the East after the Bobcats beat Portland.\n\nDeMar DeRozan scored 16 points and James Johnson had 13 for the Raptors, who had lost three straight and 23 of 27.\n\n76ers 89, Celtics 86\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Spencer Hawes had 14 points and 10 rebounds, Elton Brand scored 14 points and the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Boston Celtics.\n\nThe Sixers led by 10 points and controlled the Eastern Conference-leading Celtics for most of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Celtics missed eight straight baskets over a 6-minute span late in the fourth to lose only their eighth conference game of the season."
