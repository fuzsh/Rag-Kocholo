        "text": "Gerald Wallace, about to enter his 13th season with a fifth team, is the senior member of the Celtics in terms of experience in the league, so he has plenty of insight to offer a rebuilding team.\n\nOn Sunday night, after watching the Celtics fall to 1-6 with a lackluster preseason loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves, the 31-year-old Wallace spoke up, criticizing the lack of effort his team had put forth.\n\nWallace didn’t back away from those comments following practice Tuesday afternoon, even after the coaching staff asked him to “ease up.’’\n\n“I’m getting fussed at by the coaches,’’ said Wallace. “They’re trying to tell me to relax and ease up, but the main thing is, I want the guys to compete.\n\n“If we lose every game, if we lose all 82 games, but we lose them going down fighting and competing hard, then I can live with that. I just can’t live with losing if we didn’t compete (like Sunday), we didn’t give our best effort and we just gave the game away.\n\n“I don’t want that for these guys and this team. I want us to come out and compete and whatever happens, happens at the end of the day.’’\n\nThe Celtics have had a rocky month blending in seven new players with a new head coach in Brad Stevens and without a rehabbing Rajon Rondo. The only win came against a New York Knicks team that didn’t use its key players.\n\nThe preseason ends tonight when the Celtics face the Brooklyn Nets at the TD Garden (7 p.m.: TV, Comcast SportsNet and ESPN). Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett are going to skip the game – as will everyone else since the Red Sox are opening the World Series.\n\nWallace did not like what he saw in the loss to the Timberwolves and sent a message that Stevens said translated into one of the best practices of the month Tuesday.\n\n“I think we’re laid back at times,’’ said Wallace, who leads the team with an 11-point scoring average. “We don’t put forth the effort offensively and defensively.\n\n“We’ve got to understand we’ve got to do things hard for 48 minutes. We don’t have the luxury of being able to take a quarter off or take five minutes off. We’ve got to continue to play and continue playing hard for 48 minutes.\n\n“At the end of the day, when they keep looking up at the scoreboard and we’re getting our (butts) kicked every night, some response has got to come. The effort is something that everybody can control. It doesn’t take talent or skill to just bring effort, to come out every night and compete and just give the will to win. It’s not that hard.’’\n\nStevens, who turned 37 on Tuesday, said he appreciated the observations made by Wallace.\n\n“Those guys have been in the league, and whatever those guys see, I’m comfortable with them saying that,’’ said Stevens. “The biggest key is we’re all together in moving forward and today’s practice was going to be our first challenge. I thought it was if not our best practice it was definitely in our top two or three.’’"
