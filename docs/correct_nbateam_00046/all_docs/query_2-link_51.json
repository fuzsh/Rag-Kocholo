For example, if Player A played 56 games and scored 1,590 points (28.4 ppg), Player A could still qualify for the league lead if his average (27.4) with that same point total (1,590) over 58 games was higher than any other player.\n\nA past example: Gerald Wallace collected 138 steals in 55 games (2.51 spg) during the 2005-06 season. Wallace would have still led the league in steals because his average with 58 games (2.38 spg) would have been greater than the 2.28 spg of Brevin Knight, the leader among players who met the 58-game qualifier.\n\n** MINIMUMS FOR NBA ROOKIE LEADERS\n\n(half of the overall-requirement)\n\n*** In order to qualify for the Per 48 Minutes Official Leaders, the player must have played in 2,000 minutes of an 82-game season. If a teamâ€™s season happens to be other than 82 games, their minutes minimum is calculated with the following formula: (2,000 / 82) * Team Games Played.\n\nGame-By-Game Statistical Minimums\n\nFollowing is a chart which shows the statistical minimums a player needs to achieve to be listed among the league leaders at any given point in the season. When checking a player's status, find the number of games the player's TEAM has played in the first column. Then read the number to the right in the second column and check to see if the PLAYER has played in at least that many games. If he has, he is eligible to be among the league leaders in scoring, rebounding, assists, steals, blocked shots and minutes. Players qualify for the league leaders in shooting percentage based only on the number of shots made, not games played.\n\nCategory:All Non-Shooting%Field Goal%Free Throw%3-Point%Rule:70% of team's games300 field goals made125 free throws made82 3-point field goals madeGame #Minimum # of GamesMinimum # of MakesMinimum # of MakesMinimum # of Makes1142122842331153431574541985652210675261178630138973314910737161011841171112944191213104820131410522214151155231516125925161712632617181366281819147029192014743120211577332122168134222317853623241788372425189239252619964026271999422728201034328292110745293021110463031221144831322311849323324121513334241255234352512954353626132553637261365737382714058383928143603940281476140412915063414230154654243311586643443116168444532165694546331697146473317272474834176744849351807549503518377505136187785152371918052533819481535438198835455392028455564020586565740209875758412138958594221690596042220926061432249361624422795626345231976364452359864654623810065664724210166674724610367684824910468694925310669704925710770715026010971725126411072735226811273745227111374755327511575765427911676775428211877785528611978795629012179805629312280815729712481825830012582"
