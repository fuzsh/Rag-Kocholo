        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. | Gerald Wallace and the Bobcats reached an agreement in principle that would keep the team’s leading scorer in Charlotte, executive vice president of basketball operations Bernie Bickerstaff said Wednesday.\n\n“There’s still some paperwork issues to work out before we can get everything signed, but we’re happy,” Bickerstaff told The Associated Press. “It’s been a collaborative effort on both sides.”\n\nWallace, a former Alabama player who turns 25 later this month, led the Bobcats with 18.1 points per game last season. He also averaged 7.2 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 2.0 steals in 72 games.\n\nWallace became an unrestricted free agent last month, and the Bobcats faced heavy competition in their efforts to re-sign the forward. But Bobcats part-owner Michael Jordan had said keeping Wallace was one of the team’s top offseason priorities.\n\n“Gerald’s excited to go back to Charlotte and be a part of a young, athletic team with an ownership group committed to building a winning team,” Wallace’s agent, Rob Pelinka, said late Wednesday.\n\nBickerstaff and Pelinka declined to disclose any details of Wallace’s contract."
