        "text": "Either get Iggy or Wallace and we will definitely get better as long as we don't give up to much for one of them. Wallace has the better contract btw.\n\nI have been pushing for this ever since we lost Ron. This team definitely is missing some swag. We got to many butterfly chasers and not enough ass kickers.\n\nWallace was Terrence Williams'ed because he was 18, even Gerald has said he wasn't really ready maturity wise. Wallace is actually the type of defender Adelman is most likes, naturally elite defenders he doesn't have to coach defense too.\n\nAs the saying goes, you can't teach an old dog new tricks. that JVG defense style had us mired in in complete mediocrity, whereas injuries are really all that robbed Rick of a chance to challenge for the title.\n\nYou can teach them defensive sets for given plays, but for the most part, the keys to defense (man to man, and in Gerald's case, blind side shotblocking) are mostly natural abilities, the timing for such things, especially the latter isn't something you can teach, and most don't (wing players with exceptional blind side shotblocking abilities are very very rare).\n\nYeah, I know. Not getting after you, just trying to get a feel for the contracts they'd look to dump. I don't have a problem with the last two, but Diop should cause some worry.\n\nI dislike the Mavericks but they are one of the best run franchises in the NBA. Cuban has kept that team competitive for a long time now. And he's not going to stop until they get a ring.\n\nIts frustrating having the Spurs/Mavs be competitive every year while we struggle to even have a .500 season.\n\nBoth of those clubs do whatever it takes to stay a contending team.\n\nThe main reason for this is Dallas has had a healthy superstar for the last decade while ours broke down. Quite simple, actually.\n\nAs for the Mavs going after Nene, how many big guys can a team have? With Chandler, Nowitzki, and Haywood, whats the need for Nene?"
