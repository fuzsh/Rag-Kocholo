        "text": "CHARLOTTE – Until earlier this month, Gerald Wallace held a historic distinction in Charlotte Hornets history.\n\nBut the franchise's last All-Star is happy to have company as Kemba Walker will join him and five others as part of that select group in team history.\n\n\"The things he does on the court, the energy he brings, is kind of amazing,\" Wallace said last week when talking about Walker's selection to Sunday's 2017 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans. \"He had a great year last (season). So he’s much deserving.\"\n\nWallace spent seven seasons in Charlotte after the Hornets made him their initial expansion draft pick in the summer of 2004. He embodied the hustling spirit of the franchise, then named the Bobcats, during his tenure in Charlotte and was easily one of the team's most popular players.\n\nWallace still considers his selection to the 2010 NBA All-Star game in Arlington, Tex., at the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium as one of his career highlights.\n\n\"To basically start from ground zero here in Charlotte, building it up, it meant a lot,\" said Wallace, who spent three years in Sacramento before coming to Charlotte. \"To see the organization moving in the direction it did was amazing to me. I had great teammates around me with Raymond (Felton) and Jack (Stephen Jackson).\"\n\nFor Charlotte, Wallace averaged 16.4 points, 7.5 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.8 steals in 454 games before the Hornets traded him away to Portland in February 2011.\n\n\"We were an expansion team filled with players who you could say no one else in the league wanted,\" Wallace said of his Charlotte career. \"To go from there to where we were (a playoff team), that’s what makes it special.\n\n\"I think the league saw me only as an athletic guy who was talented but couldn’t shoot much. I turned myself into a defensive player, and everything else went from there. I turned myself into one of the top defensive players in the league at that time.\"\n\nIn the 2010 All-Star game in which Wallace played, the crowd was a basketball-record of 108,713.\n\nWallace came off the bench for the winning East team and played 16 points minutes two points, three rebounds and one assist. The East won 141-139 with the Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade getting MVP honors.\n\nWallace's appearance was the ninth time a Hornets player had participated in an All-Star game. Here are the others:\n\nIn 1993 in Salt Lake City, Larry Johnson was voted in as the Hornets' first All-Star starter. Johnson played 16 minutes and had four points and four rebounds in the West's 135-132 victory in which the hometown Utah Jazz dueo of Karl Malone and John Stockton were named co-MVPs.\n\nIn 1994 in Minneapolis, Alonzo Mourning was added to the roster as a reserve for a game he didn't play due to a torn left calf muscle. The East team won 127-118 as the Chicago Bulls' Scottie Pippen was named MVP.\n\nIn 1995 in Phoenix, Johnson was a reserve who played 20 minutes and had seven points and four rebounds. The West won 139-112 as the Sacramento Kings' Mitch Richmond was named MVP.\n\nIn 1996 in San Antonio, Glen Rice was a reserve who played 15 minutes and had seven points, one rebound and two assists. The East won 129-118 as the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan (now the Hornets' owner) was named MVP.\n\nIn 1997 in Cleveland, Rice was again a reserve who played 25 minutes and had 26 points to earn MVP honors in the East's 132-120 victory. The halftime of the contest featured the honoring of the 50 greatest NBA players in history during a celebration of the 50th year of the league.\n\nIn 1998 in New York, Rice was a reserve who played 16 minutes and had 16 points and one rebound. The East won 135-114 as Jordan won his third and final All-Star Game MVP award.\n\nIn 2000 in Oakland, Eddie Jones was voted in as the Hornets' second All-Star starter. Jones played 21 minutes and had 10 points, four rebounds and three assists in the West's 137-126 victory in which the San Antonio Spurs' Tim Duncan and Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal were named co-MVPs.\n\nAnd in 2002 in Philadelphia, Baron Davis was a reserve who played 13 minutes and had two points, one rebound and five assists. The West won 135-120 as the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant won the first of his now-record four All-Star Game MVPs.\n\nRichard Walker: 704-869-1841; twitter.com/jrwalk22"
