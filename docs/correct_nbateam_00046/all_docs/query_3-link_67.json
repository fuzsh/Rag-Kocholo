        "text": "Gerald Wallace can play on our team anytime, anywhere, even if he is likely to suit up with a twisted ankle, a thigh contusion, a chip fracture in his wrist, a cracked rib, and a dented cranium -- which, come to think of it, is a circumstance he usually refers to as “Tuesday.”\n\nThere is no better hustle player in the league, period -- he is scary-fearless, absolutely demented in desire to pursue the ball, disruptive at every defensive station, and nothing stops him from his appointed rounds, not even the absurd abuse he takes to that Gumby body.\n\nHe is the crash-test dummy of small forwards. Once he entered the locker room in Charlotte to find an orange sign taped to his stall. “No diving,” it said. Trainer humor. Rick Adelman, who had him in Sacramento, once said that Gerald “falls on the floor harder than anyone I’ve ever seen.”\n\nIt’s what makes him uncommonly lovable, even though it will probably shorten his career by a few hundred games. He’s the most selfless guy you can have on your team, and he always somehow manages to get his 15 and 8 even though nobody ever runs a play for him.\n\nYes, it’s a risk. If the pick the Nets just gave up lands at 4, and Wallace breaks something -- knock wood -- they’ll have fumbled another building block. But we’ll take a chance on heart anytime.\n\n-- So Dwight Howard is staying in Orlando for 2012-13? Our long national Dwightmare is over.\n\nOK, not for everybody: If we’re Stan Van Gundy, we walk away after the playoffs, because it only means the same carnival is coming through town next fall.\n\nOr maybe Stan will be spared the decision anyway. His franchise center, after all, will be given the license to hire the next coach anyway.\n\n-- The obvious deal that never came off?\n\nIf you blinked, you might have missed the icy hand of Stern the Meddlesome at work again: We were told by several GM types that the Pacers were just about ready to lock up Chris Kaman -- a perfect fit for Indiana, which believes it was one big away from competing with the beasts of the East.\n\nThat’s a bit of a stretch, but if you can rent a starting-quality center for price of draft pick (and fold his $14M salary right into your payroll), you dive in -- especially now that the Pacers have lost four straight to Eastern playoff teams.\n\nBut, alas, Kaman’s stuck inside of N’Awlins with the Hornets blues again. Seems like a shame that a 10-33 team would hold a potential 15-and-10 guy hostage like that -- unless they buy him out, which gives him a shot at signing wherever he wants.\n\n-- Priorities, priorities: The Cavs are two games out of a playoff spot, yet they gave away one of the best backup point guards in the league for a draft pick, mindful that he’ll opt out next year. But short term? Does not compute. Ramon Sessions averaged 10 and 5 off the bench while providing great relief for Jersey guy Kyrie Irving. He’ll help the Lakers. But it’s disappointing to see ninth-place Cleveland all but give up its pursuit of the Bucks and Knicks, who aren’t exactly showing signs of pulling away."
