But Wallace and Stephen Jackson, who also scored 26 points, led Charlotte's comeback.\n\nWallace's two free throws with 31.6 seconds left put Charlotte ahead to stay.\n\nWesley Johnson missed two free throws with 3.5 seconds and Minnesota trailing.\n\nMichael Beasley scored 28 points, but had two key turnovers in the closing minutes. Kevin Love had 20 points and nine rebounds, returning to the game late after a scary fall.\n\nIt was a much-needed win for Charlotte, with owner Michael Jordan squirming in his courtside seat in the frantic final minute before his top players came through.\n\nWallace didn't get his first field goal until midway through the third quarter, but hit 17-of-19 free throws to set a team record."
