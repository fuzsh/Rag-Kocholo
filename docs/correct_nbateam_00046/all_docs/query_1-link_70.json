        "text": "When\n\n, he received a text message from his mother, Alice Castleberry.\n\nLike she often does, Castleberry sent her youngest son a Bible scripture. On Thursday, it was Philippians 4:13.\n\nI can do everything through him who gives me strength.\n\n\"It's basically, 'Through God you can do all things,'\" Castleberry said.\n\nIt's ironic, though, because these days it's not Wallace who needs the strength, but Castleberry.\n\nWallace, 28, is in the prime of his career, having established himself as one of the toughest and hardest playing forwards in the NBA.\n\nCastleberry, 51, is getting back on her feet after a grueling battle with multiple myeloma, a blood disease that attacks the bones. Last December she had a bone marrow transplant and underwent chemotherapy. The cancer is in remission, but her kidneys are operating at 15 percent capacity.\n\n\"She's everything to me,\" Wallace said. \"She raised me and my brother by herself. She was always there for us, she made sacrifices for us. Growing up, she put us in a position to better ourselves as men.\"\n\nFor Wallace, that included instilling a work ethic that separates himself from many in the NBA.\n\n\"It's like my mom always said: You won't always be the tallest player. You won't always be the quickest player. You won't always be the best shooter, or the best defender,\" Wallace said. \"But the one thing you can do to separate yourself is to compete hard and give all your effort. Everything else will fall into place.\"\n\nLike always, Castleberry, who still lives in the small Alabama town where Wallace grew up, was right.\n\nFew in the NBA, if any, play harder than Wallace and few, if any, throw their bodies around the court in pursuit of victory as much as the 6-foot-7, 220-pounder. It's why he was a 2010 All-Star, an All-Defensive team selection and is the owner of a contract that pays him $10.5 million a year for the next two seasons.\n\nBut there is more to Wallace than just floor-burns and muscle.\n\nHe is a humble and generous star who is still ingrained in the fabric of his hometown of\n\n. (pop. 4,579). He is a father of four children with a wife he met as a freshman in high school. He is convinced he has a future as an FBI agent, and is enraptured by any crime/mystery television show. And he has a personal assistant, which he feels the NBA should make mandatory for all players.\n\nMore than anything, though, Wallace is his mama's boy.\n\n\"He does what he does because of his mother, and he is who he is because of his mother,\" said Jodi Hopkins, his personal assistant. \"We always tease him when he acts up: 'We are going to call mom!'\n\n\"He has a genuine appreciation knowing that she raised two sons and fought hard to make sure they had a better life. He wants to make her proud,\" Hopkins said. \"And when he talks about stepping on the court and giving everything he has, it's because of his mom.\"\n\n****\n\nGerald Wallace\n\nAge:\n\n28\n\nHometown:\n\nChildersburg, Ala.\n\nCollege:\n\nAlabama\n\nCareer statistics:\n\n13.4 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.0 apg\n\nThis season:\n\n15.6 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 2.4 apg\n\nBest season (2009-10):\n\n18.2 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 2.1 apg\n\nUp until last December, there was always one constant for shoppers at the Winn Dixie grocery store in Childersburg: Five days a week, eight hours a day, Alice Castleberry would be there to scan and bag their groceries.\n\nNever mind that the youngest of her two sons has been a millionaire many times over since the Sacramento Kings chose him in the first round of the 2001 draft out of Alabama.\n\n\"I always tried to teach my sons that anything in life worth having, you have to work hard for,\" Castleberry said. \"Plus, I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed dealing with people. I didn't see no need for me to just quit and sit at home. I wanted to be self-supporting as long as I could be.\"\n\nIt wasn't until the chemotherapy treatments weakened her, and the bone marrow transplant hospitalized her that Castleberry gave up her job.\n\nQuitting her job was a hard thing for Castleberry, but not as hard as it was the year before to keep a secret from Gerald.\n\nShe had been feeling ill, but would never let on during her daily phone conversations with Gerald. He was having such a good season for Charlotte that Castleberry figured she would wait until the summer.\n\n\"She wanted me to concentrate on basketball and not be focused on it,\" Wallace said. \"But when I got the call at home in Charlotte ... whooo, I mean, when you hear cancer, you want to know what's going on. You don't understand.\"\n\nHopkins said Wallace approached the news like an unclaimed rebound.\n\n\"Instantly, it was 'We are going to fight this, Mom,\" Hopkins said. \"It had an immediate impact on him. I think it helped him focus for the upcoming year. That was his\n\n; he took all the energy of watching what she was going through and channeled that into the best year of his career.\"\n\nIndeed, in 2010, Wallace became the first Bobcats player selected for the All-Star Game. When he was named to the team, Castleberry was in a Birmingham hospital recovering from the bone marrow transplant.\n\nWhen it came time for him to play in the All-Star Game, Wallace pleaded with doctors to let his mother travel to Dallas to see him in person. Wallace said he fought and pleaded for days to convince the doctors. For some reason, her strength improved in the days before the game.\n\nThe doctors relented and Castleberry went to Dallas.\n\n\"I was overjoyed with tears,\" she said. \"At that point, I was very sick, but God was good. I was able to see him play. It was the thrill of my life.\"\n\n****\n\nWith all the money and all the fame Wallace has achieved during his 10-year career, he has never forgotten Childersburg.\n\nAnd he never will.\n\n\"I don't like big cities; big cities make me nervous,\" Wallace said. \"After the season, I'm going back to my small town, back to the country.\"\n\nChildersburg has one stop light and one main road, Highway 280, which runs from Auburn to Birmingham.\n\nWallace says he likes to fish and watch his son play baseball during the summer, as well as mingle with the hometown folks. After all, everybody knows everybody.\n\n\"We call it a 'community town' because everybody is basically family,\" Wallace said. \"It's a community knitted in raising everybody together. Like as kids, just because my mom was working, my next door neighbor could give me a whoopin' just like my mom can. So the best thing to do was to stay humble and cool, because if you got into trouble by the next door neighbor or someone down the street, you get a whoopin' from there, then you gotta go home and wait on mom to come home and you are going to get another one. You don't want to push that envelope.\"\n\nHis parents divorced when he was 5, and his father stayed in Childersburg, where Gerald maintained a relationship. His father passed away two years ago.\n\nWallace recently refurbished the abandoned elementary school gym, and annually puts on the town's Fourth of July fireworks display. He also hosts cookouts at the playground, complete with steaks and pork chops.\n\nIn Charlotte, the Gerald Wallace Foundation recently awarded gift cards at the local community center, arriving unannounced.\n\n\"I want to tell people about the things he is doing in the community, but often times he won't let me,\" said Hopkins, who also heads his foundation. \"He says, 'This is what I'm supposed to do. I have the ability to help people and this is what I want to do.'\"\n\nHe says he also wants to explore law enforcement when his career is over.\n\n\"I'm stuck on being an FBI agent,\" Wallace said, his intimidating baritone offset by an easy smile. \"I watch all these crime shows, and it's the detective work. I like that. The mystery of trying to figure out crimes and the way people think. I'm big on that.\"\n\nAnd like most everything he tries, he's good at it too, Hopkins said.\n\n\"'Law and Order,' 'CSI' -- you name the show, he watches it,\" Hopkins said. \"And within 10 or 15 minutes of the show, he is telling you who did it.\"\n\n****\n\nFor now, there won't be many family gatherings to watch television. His wife, who served in the Air Force for six and a half years and is attending school, will stay in Charlotte with their four children, who range in age from 6 to 12, until school is out.\n\nAnd his mother, whom he could drive 5 hours to see in a pinch, will now be limited to daily phone calls.\n\n\"We are all still kind of in shock,\" Hopkins said. \"But I think it's a great opportunity for him. We hear the fans there are just crazy, and Gerald feeds off that. He thrives on energy.\"\n\nIf that doesn't help, he will have the scripture his mom sent as a reminder.\n\nI can do everything through him who gives me strength.\n\nIn the meantime, his mom asks one favor from Portland.\n\n\"You all be good to my baby, because he is my baby,\" Castleberry said. \"I'm gonna get out there one of these days, but in the meantime, you all take care of my baby.\"\n\n--"
