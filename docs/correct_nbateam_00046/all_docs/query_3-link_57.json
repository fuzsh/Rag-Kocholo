        "text": "Welcome to Buzz City Beat, Swarm and Sting’s daily dose of the best news and articles surrounding the Charlotte Hornets from around the web.\n\nAfter losing to the Houston Rockets last time out, the Charlotte Hornets look to bounce back against the Los Angeles Clippers at home. In this edition of Buzz City Beat, we look at the importance of Cody Zeller, a chat with Gerald Wallace and the team partners with McDonald’s Coffee.\n\nThe Importance of Cody Zeller\n\n“Make no mistake, playing hard and being engaged mentally every single night is a skill, one that Zeller possesses in spades. The Hornets’ margin for error is smaller than many teams, and Zeller helps tighten the strings when things begin to get loose. Those kind of contributions have always been overlooked, but don’t minimize their importance. Zeller’s contract is money well spent when he helps win games.” (HoopsHabit.com)\n\nCody is clearly one of the Hornets most important players. He is their best and most consistent big man and his importance have been magnified as he has missed a number of games this season. With Zeller out, Charlotte only has a 2-12 record. At a glance, he may not seem like a wildly important player but when you watch the team play with and without him, his impact is clear.\n\nMore from Swarm and Sting\n\nTalk With Gerald Wallace\n\n“What do you think of Kemba Walker making the All-Star Game?\n\nThe things he does on the court, the energy he brings, is kind of amazing. He had a great year last (season). So he’s much deserving.” (CharlotteObserver.com)\n\nFormer Charlotte Bobcat, Gerald Wallace, talk to Rick Bonnell about playing in the Queen City, the Super Bowl and the all-star game. Crash praised Kemba and recalled his experience in the all-star game. The most interesting part of the short interview was Wallace talking about the Bobcats’ team that he played for and how he made a name for himself as a defensive/ hard worker in this league.\n\nHornets Partner With McDonald’s for Coffee\n\n“The Charlotte Hornets today announced that McDonald’s coffee will be sold at five Spectrum Center concession stands beginning with tomorrow’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers. McDonald’s coffee, which is already the Official Coffee of the Charlotte Hornets, will now be sold in the arena in the same Hornets-branded cups that are currently available at Charlotte-area McDonald’s locations.” (NBA.com)\n\nNot sure that this deal matters much but maybe it makes the organization some more money down the line. I guess it’s pretty cool that there will be branded cups with the Charlotte Hornets’ logo on them. I guess if you’re a big fan of coffee, this news would suit you."
