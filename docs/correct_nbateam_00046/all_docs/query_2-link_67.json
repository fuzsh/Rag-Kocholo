        "text": "This article is part of a series of top North Carolina athletes and teams. As North Carolina sports betting launched in March, take a look at the top athletes across North Carolina college and professional sports.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets joined the NBA ranks as an expansion team in 1988 and despite never playing in the NBA Finals, the franchise has had some solid players along the way. Also, it has had a confusing franchise history going from Charlotte to New Orleans to restarting in Charlotte. For this list, we will focus on players who played for the Charlotte Hornets or Bobcats in their careers.\n\nWho is the best Hornet ever? Check out the 10 best Charlotte Hornets players of all time.\n\n10. LaMelo Ball – PG\n\nYears in Charlotte: 2020-present\n\nYou might think I’m crazy and falling for the classic recency bias, but LaMelo Ball has put up solid numbers in his short career in Charlotte. Yes, he’s played less than 200 games in his career, but that’s not terrible considering the all-time leader in games played for the franchise is just 701.\n\nIn his first four seasons, Ball has made an All-Star team and was the 2020-21 Rookie of the Year while he made the All-Rookie team. In 2021-22, Ball played 75 games and averaged 20.1 points, 7.6 assists, and 6.7 rebounds. He was named an Eastern Conference All-Star that season.\n\nAlso, Ball has the most triple-doubles in franchise history. Check out his career stats.\n\nWant some great Hornets gear?

Jamal Mashburn – SF\n\nYears in Charlotte: 2000-04 (kinda)\n\nMashburn played for the Charlotte Hornets from 2000-02 and stayed with the team for the next two years as it became the New Orleans Hornets before a knee injury ended his career. He averaged 21 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5 assists in his four years with the Charlotte/New Orleans Hornets.\n\nMashburn was an All-Star in the 2002-03 season as well as an All-NBA selection as he averaged 21.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 5.6 assists.

Gerald Wallace – SF\n\nYears in Charlotte: 2004-11\n\nGerald Wallace was one of the few consistent things about the Charlotte Bobcats as he spent just under seven seasons with the team and played 445 games. He made the All-Star team in 2010, was the steals champ in 2005-06, and was All-Defensive in 2009-10.\n\nWith the Bobcats, Wallace’s stat line was an average of 16.4 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks. His best season came in 2009-10 when he averaged 18.2 points, 10.0 rebounds, 1.5 steals, and 1.1 blocks as the Bobcats picked up their first winning season since re-entering the league in 2004.\n\nSee Wallace’s career stats.\n\n7. Baron Davis – PG\n\nYears in Charlotte: 1999-2004 (kinda)\n\nThe Hornets took Baron Davis at number three overall in 1999 and he exploded onto the scene a few years later as he averaged 18.1 points, 8.5 assists, 4.3 rebounds, and 2.1 steals in 2001-02. He made the All-Star team that season and the squad moved to New Orleans the next season where Davis played until 2005 when was traded to the Warriors.\n\nDavis made an All-Star team in New Orleans in 2004 when he averaged 22.9 points per game and at the end of the season, he was named All-NBA.
