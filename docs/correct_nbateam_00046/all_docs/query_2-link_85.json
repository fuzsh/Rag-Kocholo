        "text": "The Alabama-LSU football game was on the locker room television after Saturday night’s win over the Bulls, and one of the Crimson Tide’s better basketball alumni, the Celtics’ Gerald Wallace, sat watching the game with his left foot planted in a bucket of ice and a balloon-sized ice bag strapped to his left knee.\n\nHe spread his arms wide and gestured during an animated talk with Evan Turner, who Wallace had summoned across the room. Turner, filling in for Rajon Rondo as starting point guard, had just played his finest game as a Celtic. No time like then for Wallace to go over some fine points.\n\nBack home, Wallace’s locker is next to Marcus Smart, and the 32-year-old veteran can always been seen sharing his knowledge with the attentive rookie.\n\nBrad Stevens has singled out Wallace for embracing the mentor’s role in lieu of a more involved role on the floor. The Celtics coach has predicted that Wallace will become one of his “all-time favorites” because of the way he has checked his ego at the door.\n\nBut that’s fine with Wallace. It’s like he has a second set of kids in this locker room.\n\n“Absolutely. I talk to ’em and listen to ’em and their situations,” he said. “It’s kind of hard at times, because I know the process they’re in and where they’re going. Depending on how you look at it, sometimes it’s selfish and sometimes not, but everyone is competing and wanting to win. We have to play together as a team, and I think we’re doing a great job of that this year. For me to be able to mentor them is important.”\n\nWallace’s selflessness is also connected to that surgically repaired knee. He remarkably made it through 13 seasons without once requiring surgery, and his recovery from last summer’s clean-out procedure has been slow.\n\nIt’s easier to embrace mentorship and a reduced on-court role when your body isn’t right.\n\n“For me right now it’s not as bad, because I’m still struggling with trying to get myself back to 100 percent where I feel comfortable playing,” he said of taking a back seat now. “So the minutes right now aren’t as important as doing my strengthening and rehabbing.”\n\nThese admissions are hard for a player who sacrificed his body so relentlessly over 13 seasons that he earned the nickname “Crash.”\n\nA healthy Wallace may not have been so amenable to Stevens’ requests. But Wallace isn’t healthy enough to protest.\n\n“I don’t feel mentally or physically like I can go out and play 40 or 45 minutes a game,” said Wallace. “That would totally destroy my body as it is right now. The main thing is to get focused and healthy, try to get stronger.”\n\nBut Wallace sounds like he was caught off guard by the after-effects of surgery.\n\n“I’ve never had surgery, ever, on anything,” he said. “This is probably the worst thing I’ve ever dealt with in my career because it affects my strength. . . . It’s all a new process for me to start over. I have a hard time doing it, but I understand it’s a process I have to get through.”\n\nWallace also understands that his time is running down. His career has been predicated on slashing offense and all-out commitment to getting stops.\n\n“I’m not a knock-down shooter or a spot-up shooter,” he said. “I have to use my athleticism, and when I don’t have that, I’m kind of grounded. I’m not able to be effective the way I want to be effective.\n\n“It’s mental and physical,” said Wallace. “Mentally you want to be able to go out and play, and do the things you’re used to doing — things I know I can do.”\n\nUntil then, though, he’s teaching quite a lesson to his younger teammates about buying in and accepting a role.\n\n“I know that Gerald Wallace on other teams could play 40 minutes, but he’s on our team and he’s not playing,” Phil Pressey said. “If he’s not going to complain, then I have no reason to complain. Just stay ready.”"
