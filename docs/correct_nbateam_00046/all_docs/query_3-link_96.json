        "text": "With a flurry of baseball trades flying at the MLB trade deadline, the Sixers were not to be outdone.\n\nThe Sixers on Friday sent Jason Thompson to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Gerald Wallace, cash and draft considerations, the team announced.\n\nWith this deal, the Sixers get an expiring contract in Wallace, while the Warriors add valuable size in the post in Thompson. Wallace is slated to make $10.1 million in 2015-16, the final year of a four-year, $40 million deal, according to spotrac.com.\n\nAs for the draft considerations, a league source has told CSNPhilly.com's John Finger it's another pick swap. The Sixers received the right to swap the lesser of their first-round picks from the Miami Heat and Oklahoma City Thunder with Golden State's first-round pick next year. Miami's pick is top-10 protected in 2016 and unprotected in 2017. OKC's is top-15 protected the next two years and if not transferred by then becomes a second-round pick in 2017 and another in 2018.\n\nKeith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer was the first to report the pick swap.\n\nIt was a short homecoming back east for Thompson. The Sixers acquired the Rider University product from the Kings on July 9 along with Stauskas, Carl Landry and a first-round pick for 2015 second-round picks Arturas Gudaitis and Luka Mitrovic. They also received the rights to swap picks with the Kings in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThompson was the Kings’ 2008 first-round pick (12th overall) and appeared in the most games of any player in Sacramento history. The 29-year-old averaged 6.1 points and 6.5 rebounds in 24.6 minutes per game last season with the Kings.\n\nNBA\n\nWallace had spent only four days with the Warriors before getting dealt to the Sixers. The 33-year-old forward was traded from the Celtics to the Warriors on Monday along with Chris Babb in exchange for David Lee.\n\nWallace appeared in 32 games for the Celtics last season, averaging 1.1 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.9 minutes per game. He’s averaged 11.9 points per game over career that has spanned 14 years and five franchises (Charlotte, Sacramento, Boston, New Jersey/Brooklyn and Portland)."
