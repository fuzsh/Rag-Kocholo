        "text": "Paul Haynes grew up in Auburn Hills, Michigan and attended Pontiac Northern High School (now Pontiac High School). He went on to play basketball at Grambling State University on a full-ride athletic scholarship.\n\nAt Grambling State, Paul was awarded SWAC Conference Freshman of the Year, SWAC Conference Player of the Year, 3-time SWAC Conference 1st Team, Associated Press All-American Honorable Mention, and ESPN Academic All-American. Paul scored a career-high 46 points in a game during his time there.\n\nAfter being a projected NBA draft pick, Paul worked out with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Toronto Raptors, and Utah Jazz, but ended up getting paid to play professionally for 5 years in Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Paul was a captain on each team every year and he averaged 17.8 points and 7.1 rebounds per game at the small forward position.\n\nThroughout his playing career, Paul learned a lot about the struggles that professional athletes can face: loneliness away from home or in another country, being taken advantage of by agents and financial advisors, along with the various other difficulties that come with trying to keep the professional sports dream alive.\n\nUpon “retiring” from professional basketball, Paul worked as a financial advisor before deciding to return to what he loves most: basketball. A few kids had asked for training, so Paul accepted as a way to help them improve and to give him a chance to slowly get back into the game of basketball. As the demand for his services grew, he was pressed to find time to help more individuals – from elementary age to the professional level.\n\nPaul has personally trained with Lindsey Hunter, Rick Mahorn, Isiah Thomas, Voshon Lenard, and Vince Carter. He has played against Dwyane Wade, Vince Carter, Gerald Wallace, Jalen Rose, along with many other current & former NBA players. Since beginning his training career, he has personally trained and developed over 50 collegiate and professional athletes. He considers himself fortunate to have had the opportunity to train and help many people accomplish their personal goals, no matter how big or small they are: from making a middle school basketball team to playing in college and at the professional level."
