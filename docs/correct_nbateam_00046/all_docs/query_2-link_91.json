        "text": "Man… It hurts me that this former Indiana Mr. Basketball hasn’t played up to his potential. Injuries due to poor conditioning have really hurt his career.\n\nIt’s hard to say if he’ll live up to his potential after having the kinds of knee problems he’s had. They say microfracture surgery is a two year thing, so this is his year to make an impact. I’ve heard that he’s 100% healthy and playing without pain. I’d like to see him get down to around 245 lbs, which will take pressure off of his knee. If he’s really healthy, then I feel he can be a very solid contributor off the bench.\n\nI’m not sure what to expect from May this year, but players like him kinda frustrate me. It’s obvious that he needs to lose weight and his former team was constantly asking him to lose some pounds, especially becuase of his injuries. But he never did. How can professional athletes who are being paid millions and have their career on the line not lose weight. Maybe he has now, so we’ll see.\n\nIn order to lose weight, you have to run. If you’re knees are injured, you can’t really run and condition yourself the ways you’d like. That’s been May’s issue. Microfracture surgery really limits what you can do. This past summer he was able to run and condition himself without pain. He just needs to keep it up and regain his confidence. Hopefully he can do that in Sacramento.\n\nI had an ankle injury two years ago that ended my basketball playing days and I can’t even jog or anything anymore. I started putting on a lot of weight. So Now I lift weights, ride the bycicle, swim and use other cardio machines that don’t put pressure on your ankle. It is hard as hell to keep the weight off, but I go to the gym 5 days a week and I manage. I can’t feel bad for a professional athlete who can’t do the same.\n\nYou’re also not in the NBA. I’m sure that even while May was injured, he was in ten times better condition than what you call “in shape” right now. Let’s be real here… “Real Life” conditioned and “NBA” conditioned are two different things. I saw Sean May at the Indiana Classic (college football game held every year in Indianapolis) last year and even though he was “out of shape” in NBA terms, he looked slim to me standing every bit of 6′ 9″. I thought he looked great.\n\nI’m sure he has been working out and doing what he can while keeping pressure off the knees, but that still hasn’t been enough for him to be NBA fit or in game shape. It varies and just depends on the player, but sometimes riding the bike, swimming, yoga, weight lifting, etc aren’t enough to keep them in NBA game shape while out with a serious knee injury, especially microfracture surgery. Look at Greg Oden for example. The Blazers had him doing everything possible to stay in shape while injured and he still was significantly overweight and out of shape for majority of the season.\n\nno one was even talking about Boris Diaw. I would like to see May contribute because I feel like he can be a good bench player in the league. A guy who can come in, give u 20 solid minutes, and about 8-9ppg, 5rpg, and just overall smart-effective basketball. But I have to see him first to believe what is being said.\n\nI’m not a huge May fan, but he is a big body and has some quality fundamental post moves. I still think he can contribute and I saw on insider he had some monetary motivation, so that can’t hurt. Here is the what it said, he sounds committed.\n\nAccording to The Sacramento Bee, Wednesday was one of two deadlines for Kings forward Sean May to weigh 265 pounds or less and guarantee his entire salary this season. May weighed 261 pounds to fully guarantee his $884,881 salary for the season. He had until Wednesday or October 27 to meet the weight goal, or $100,000 of his deal was not guaranteed.\n\n“It’s a long way,” May said. “I’ve come a long way from there and want to stay a long ways from there. Glad I made it, happy I made it, glad it’s over. Want to keep moving.”\n\nA few of you guys aren’t fans of May, which is understandable considering how his NBA career has gone. I just still have memories of his high school days in Indiana. He was a BEAST lol. I’ll never forget when he and Jared Jeffries’ (another former Indiana Mr. Basketball who’s NBA career hasn’t gone as expected) team Bloomington North faced off against Zach Randolph’s team Marion in the Class 4A State Finals. That was one hell of a game! It had a lot of interesting sub plots lol. Jeffries and Randolph were All-Americans, McDonald All-Americans, Indiana All-Stars, Mr. Basketball candidates and going to opposite schools in the Big-Ten. May was a junior at the time and was a Junior Indiana All-Star and highly ranked nationally. Bloomington North was in a rich/classy part of Indiana, Marion from the hood lol. Randolph dominated and Marion won in an upset, but Jeffries still won Mr. Basketball that year. I guess I just remember those days and am still a fan of those three guys regardless of how their careers go."
