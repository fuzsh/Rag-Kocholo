        "text": "Gerald Wallace wasn't a Sixer for long.\n\nTo no surprise, the Sixers waived the 33-year-old Saturday night, a league source confirmed to CSNPhilly.com's John Finger. Per the source, the Sixers are on the hook to pay Wallace his guaranteed $10.1 million this season, the final year of his four-year deal originally signed with the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nESPN's Marc Stein first reported the news.\n\nWallace and his expiring contract were acquired by the Sixers — along with cash and draft considerations — on July 31 from the Warriors in exchange for Jason Thompson.\n\nWallace was on the Warriors for only four days, as he was dealt from the Celtics to Golden State before being traded to the Sixers.\n\nLast season, Wallace played in 32 games for the Celtics and averaged 1.1 points and 1.8 rebounds in 8.9 minutes of action."
