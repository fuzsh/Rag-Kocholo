Japan will hold a state funeral on June 8 for former prime minister Keizo Obuchi.

Obuchi died at a Tokyo hospital on Sunday, six weeks after suffering a stroke that left him in a coma. He was 62.

Japanese officials say that 5,000 guests will be invited to the funeral, including many foreign dignitaries.

Obuchi was largely credited with getting Japan's weakened economy back on its feet.

A graduate of Tokyo's prestigious Waseda University, Obuchi was elected to Japan's powerful lower house of Parliament in 1963 at the age of 26 inheriting, as is common in Japan, the seat held previously by his father.

He held that seat during his entire career.

Obuchi first served as a cabinet official in 1979 when he was selected to jointly head the Management and Coordination Agency and Okinawa Development Agency.

In 1993, he became the Liberal Democrats' secretary general, one of three key party posts, under prime minister Toshiki Kaifu. A year later, Obuchi took control of the biggest of several rival factions in the LDP, succeeding former prime minister Noboru Takeshita.

He became foreign minister in 1997. That post is considered a stepping stone to the premiership.

Obuchi took that office in July 1998. Some had doubts about his leadership ability, but his popularity rose as the economy improved. Voters grew to appreciate Obuchi's amiable manner.

He never publicly described himself as a big shot. Reportedly, he once compared himself to a "noodle shop between two skyscrapers," referring to two of his proteges, former prime ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and the late Takeo Fukuda.

That humble image was often cited as a key to his success. Instead of a hard-driving style, often frowned upon in Japan, Obuchi favoured low-key consensus-building.

Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori took office April 5 and promised to stick to Obuchi's policies. These include giving priority to economic recovery before tackling the nation's huge public debt.
