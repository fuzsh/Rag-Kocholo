        "text": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has brought five women into the cabinet in a reshuffle, while retaining ministers in key posts.\n\nThe move means women now hold seven of the 18 cabinet posts, equalling the previous high set by Junichiro Koizumi's cabinet in 2001.\n\nMr Abe says better use of women's skills will help economic revival.\n\nTaro Aso remains in place as deputy PM and finance minister, while Fumio Kishida stays as foreign minister.\n\nDefence Minister Itsunori Onodera will be replaced by Akinori Eto.\n\nThe new line-up was announced by Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, who also kept his post.\n\nMr Abe said in a press conference: \"Realising a society where women can shine is a challenge our cabinet has undertaken... I look forward to the wind of change these women will bring.\"\n\nHe said a \"positive economic cycle is kicking off\".\n\n\"We're only halfway through in reforms and we need to deal with new challenges. I reshuffled my cabinet so that we can tackle these challenges boldly and vigorously,\" he said, adding that the biggest issue was reviving some regions of Japan."
