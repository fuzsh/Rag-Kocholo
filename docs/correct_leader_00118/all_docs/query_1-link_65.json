        "text": "TOKYO, April 5 -- Within hours of his election as prime minister today, Yoshiro Mori moved to assure the world that the Japanese government has barely broken stride in the transfer of power to him from the critically ill Keizo Obuchi.\n\n\"We are going to maintain the policies of the previous administration; I think that's very important,\" Mori told reporters.\n\nMori, 62, followed his back-room-scripted election by parliament with the announcement that all of Obuchi's cabinet members had been reappointed to their posts. He then held a late-night news conference in which he pledged to forge ahead with the expanded government spending Obuchi had championed to try to recharge the economy, despite growing criticism of the country's soaring public debt.\n\n\"The Japanese economy is still struggling,\" Mori said. \"We have to tackle other issues [only] once we see the economy is on a full recovery track.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe indicated he will not call an immediate election for the lower house of parliament, as some aides had suggested, saying: \"I have other tasks to carry out. It's important that the parliament is functioning properly.\" By law, he must call an election by Oct. 19.\n\nMori also said he will travel to Russia on April 28, a visit Obuchi had intended to make to help mend a historic rift between Tokyo and Moscow. It will be the first meeting with a major head of state for acting Russian President Vladimir Putin since he was elected president in his own right last week--and now, also, for Mori.\n\nThe swift installation of Mori, a veteran member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, came just four days after Obuchi was hospitalized and fell into a coma following a stroke; he remains on life support. With no discernible objection, the ruling party concluded that Obuchi would not be able to resume his duties and should be replaced promptly to ensure government continuity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn quick succession, Obuchi's cabinet resigned as a whole Tuesday night, the Liberal Democrats elected Mori party leader by acclamation this morning, and both houses of parliament elected him prime minister this afternoon.\n\nThe moves left opposition parties spluttering helplessly. \"We demand the dissolution of the Diet\"--parliament--to hold an election, said Yukio Hatoyama, head of the opposition Democratic Party. \"This coalition has not been baptized by the Japanese people.\"\n\nAll sides are trying to guess how an election for the 500-seat lower house of parliament, the House of Representatives, would affect the majority now held by the Liberal Democrats in that key chamber. An election must be held within six months, but Mori suggested tonight that he will wait until after the July economic summit of eight world leaders in Okinawa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The summit will be a top priority,\" Mori said. Obuchi had hoped the summit would reverse his declining popularity in opinion polls; for Mori, appearing statesmanlike among world leaders may have the additional benefit of muting concerns about his lack of foreign policy experience.\n\nAlthough Mori has been elected to his legislative seat 10 times and has held three ministerial portfolios during his climb through the party ranks, he is known more for his party loyalty and political relationships than for any ideological stance. \"Whether or not somebody like this can all of a sudden show leadership, we don't know,\" said Tetsuzo Fuwa, president of the small Japan Communist Party.\n\nAt his first news conference as prime minister, Mori faced unusually blunt questions from the Japanese media and was put on the defensive about his involvement in scandals and some of his speaking gaffes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf a 1980s influence-peddling scandal in which Mori was implicated, he said, \"I had no intention of making profits\" from the bargain stocks offered by a businessman to virtually all the leaders of the party. Although news accounts at the time said Mori had made nearly $1 million from the stocks, prosecutors said they found no proof he was bribed.\n\nHe also complained about what he called the \"sensationalized media\" that has reported some of his embarrassing remarks. Earlier this year, for example, he said that as a young politician he was shunned \"like I had AIDS.\" Of the United States, he said recently: \"When there is a blackout, the murderers always come out. It's that type of society.\" He has remarked that the people of Osaka have a reputation for caring only about profits, and that the teachers' unions in Okinawa \"are under the control of communists.\"\n\nThese comments were printed without context, he insisted. \"You didn't hear those remarks directly from me,\" he said. But the news conference was a particularly bumpy start to Mori's term and a contrast with the reserved Obuchi, who rarely had a slip of the tongue.\n\nMori said he visited Obuchi's wife Tuesday at the hospital where she is keeping a vigil for her husband. Chizuko Obuchi \"asked if I would like to see Mr. Obuchi, but I refused,\" Mori said without explanation. \"I just hope Mr. Obuchi recovers as soon as possible.\""
