        "text": "[Unofficial Translation]\n\nBusiness leaders from Korea and Japan, I’m pleased to meet all of you. We have gathered here today to transform Korea and Japan’s tense relationship into one that is forward-looking and to create a new framework for business cooperation. To address the current polycrisis confronting the entire world, solidarity and cooperation among the countries that share such universal values as freedom, human rights and the rule of law are more important than ever before.\n\nYesterday, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and I met and discussed various ways that we could work together to normalize bilateral relations. We agreed on the need to develop a future-oriented Korea-Japan relationship. Our two countries will cooperate and jointly respond to a wide range of global agendas such as supply chain issues, climate change, advanced science and technology as well as economic security. I believe that there is tremendous potential for bilateral cooperation on the cutting-edge new industries of the future such as digital transformation, semiconductors, batteries and electric vehicles.\n\nKorean semiconductor manufacturers maintain tightly integrated supply chains with Japanese semiconductor materials and equipment makers, and Japanese automakers have announced planned investments in joint ventures with Korean battery makers recently. Our two governments will do everything in our power to help you, our business leaders, to engage freely in exchanges and create innovative business opportunities.\n\nFormer President Kim Dae-jung and former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi emphasized exchanges between the peoples of our two countries – especially the younger generations – in their Joint Declaration, “A New Korea-Japan Partnership towards the 21st Century.” To further advance bilateral cooperation, it is crucial that future generations play a role by engaging and participating in exchanges.\n\nIn this context, I would like to thank the Federation of Korean Industries and Keidanren, Japan’s business federation, for agreeing to establish a Korea-Japan Future Partnership Fund in a bid to jointly address pending issues between the two countries and build a forward-looking relationship. I am confident that this fund will pave the way for more frequent exchanges between future generations, fostering greater mutual understanding and cooperation, and ultimately contributing to strengthening the relationship between our two countries. I would like to request your special assistance at the business level going forward.\n\nDistinguished business leaders,\n\nThe unwavering trust and friendship between the business leaders of our two countries has provided a reliable foundation for our bilateral relations and served as a cornerstone for increased trade and economic development. I hope that the Korea-Japan Business Roundtable today will serve as a meaningful stepping stone toward upgrading our bilateral relations and opening a new chapter in the history of our renewed relations. Let’s join hands and move forward together toward a new future.\n\nThank you."
