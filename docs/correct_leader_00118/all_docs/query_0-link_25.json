        "text": "The Japanese prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, was in a coma last night after a severe stroke. Government officials, who had earlier played down the seriousness of his condition, said Mr Obuchi, 62, was on an artificial respirator in the intensive care unit of Juntendo hospital in Tokyo.\n\n\"We have heard that there is bleeding in part of his brain,\" said the acting prime minister, Mikio Aoki. \"His blood pressure has been maintained, but we have to watch the situation very closely.\"\n\nMr Obuchi, who has brought political and economic stability to Japan since taking office in July 1998, was taken to hospital at 1am on Sunday after he complained of feeling unwell.\n\nPrompting criticism of a Kremlinesque cover-up, the government did not confirm this until 22 hours later.\n\nEven then, officials would only say that the leader of the world's second largest economy was undergoing tests because he was suffering from exhaustion.\n\nMr Obuchi, who has a pacemaker, suffered the stroke after a taxing week in which he had to deal with the eruption of Mount Usu, the breakaway of prominent members of his coalition and a visit to the southern island of Kyushu to check on arrangements for this summer's G8 summit.\n\nWhether or not he recovers, analysts say Japan will soon have a new prime minister. \"A resignation is inevitable,\" said the Nihon Keizai business newspaper.\n\nThe process of appointing a replacement may prove difficult, since Japanese law makes no provision for a situation in which the prime minister is unable to utter his intention to stand down.\n\n\"Since he is in a coma, it is impossible for the prime minister himself to make his own decision about his resignation,\" said Mr Aoki, who was chosen by Mr Obuchi as a stand-in leader.\n\nHe said he would consider disbanding the cabinet if the prime minister's condition did not improve.\n\n\"It is natural for the government to start thinking about the post-Obuchi era,\" Yoshimi Watanabe, an MP of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, told reporters.\n\nHeading the list of most likely successors is Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the LDP, who is seen as being very much in the Obuchi mould. Other candidates include the foreign minister, Yohei Kono, one of the progressive members of the cabinet; Shizuka Kamei, head of the LDP's policy unit and the most vocal proponent of the government's huge public spending programme; and Koichi Kato, head of the party's second biggest faction and an advocate of fiscal restraint.\n\nMr Obuchi's shoes would not be easy to fill. Despite his low-key style - he once described himself as a \"little noodle shop between two skyscrapers\" - the prime minister has pushed through a raft of important legislation and used his knack for consensus-building to create the biggest coalition Japan has seen in decades.\n\nThe next general election must be called by October."
