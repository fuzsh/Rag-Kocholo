        "text": "TOKYO -- Japan's prime minister, on his way to a major regional economic conference, unveiled the largest stimulus package in the country's history Monday and promised it will turn the recession-bound economy around by next year.\n\nBut analysts said the 24 trillion yen ($196 billion) in new public spending and tax cuts will offer only temporary relief.\n\nThe package is aimed at stopping the economy from contracting for a third consecutive year - a pledge Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made after taking office in July.\n\n\"With this plan, our country can free itself from its current severe situation,'' Obuchi told reporters before flying to Malaysia for a summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.\n\nObuchi, who has been under intense international pressure to do more to ease Asia's economic woes, said the spending package also contains 1 trillion yen ($8 billion) in aid for the region.\n\nThe package surpasses the record 17 trillion yen ($139 billion) the government released last April and brings the total amount Tokyo has spent on stimulus since 1992 to 100 trillion yen ($820 billion).\n\nPrevious spending accomplished little more than keeping Japan's economy afloat and failed to end a stubborn downturn triggered by the collapse of land and stock prices in the early 1990s.\n\nEconomists said the results of the new package will likely be more of the same, restoring the economy to anemic growth without addressing the inefficiencies at the root of the problem.\n\n\"I'm not sure if they've put in place the mechanism'' for economic recovery, said Michael Naldrett, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia). He said the economy could expand by 1 percent next year with the package.\n\nJapanese officials said this package differs from previous ones because it follows a bill last month to help the nation's banks write off massive bad loans and clean up the financial system.\n\n\"By taking such bold and large-scale measures, I'm sure the Japanese financial system will recover,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning Agency.\n\nOne thing's for sure: Japan can use a shot in the arm. The economy has sunk into its longest recession since the government started keeping records after World War II.\n\nObuchi said the package would include more than 17.9 trillion yen ($147 billion) in spending, most of it on public works and steps to help smaller companies ride out a severe credit crunch as Japan's banks dispose of their massive bad loans.\n\nTax cuts of about 6 trillion yen ($49 billion) will bring Japanese income and corporate tax rates in line with those in major Western economies, Obuchi said.\n\nAnother feature of the package is an innovative plan to entice consumers to spend more by distributing 700 billion yen ($5.7 billion) in shopping vouchers.\n\nThe plan is expected to be passed later this month in a special session of parliament.\n\n… we have a small favor to ask.
