The site will stand above all other ham radio sites by employing the latest technology and professional design/programming standards, developed by a team of community programmers who contribute their skills to the effort. The site will be something of which everyone involved can be proud to say they were a part.\n\nWe welcome your comments.\n\nThe eHam.net Team, Revision 07/2020."
