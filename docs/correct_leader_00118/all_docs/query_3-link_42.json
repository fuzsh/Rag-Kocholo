Japanese Prime Minister Mori Yoshiro lauded his late predecessor, Obuchi Keizo, last week at a memorial service studded with world leaders. \"It was he who staked his very life on steering this nation, caught in a vortex of tribulations, to safety,\" Mori said. He recalled how close he was to his friend. \"Both Mr. Obuchi and I were born in 1937,\" he said. \"When we were Waseda University students, we joined the Yubenkai debating club because we wanted to become politicians.\" And he pledged to Obuchi that he would unite the country to carry on the late PM's unfinished work. \"We are determined to join forces, keeping fully in mind the 'constructive optimism with a firm will' that you advocated to the people,\" he said. Afterwards, all Japan agreed, Obuchi was a sincere leader, and that politically, Mori is a dead man walking.\n\nAs Japan heads toward the June 25 elections for the powerful lower house of the Diet or Parliament, Mori and his Lib-eral Democratic Party (LDP) are in trouble. The economy eked out a 0.5% expansion in the fiscal year ended in March after two years of contraction, but that is not helping. Obuchi's stroke in April and death on May 14 caused an outpouring of sympathy for him (more than he enjoyed while alive), but none of it is rubbing off on his successor. Mori has not helped himself either with his repeated verbal gaffes harking back to Japan's fascist past. \"I am so disappointed by the LDP's incompetence and stunned by Prime Minister Mori's stupidity, outdatedness and lack of leadership,\" says Matsuura Noriko, an Osaka school-teacher. \"I just cannot figure out how we ended up having him on top.\"\n\nAll of which should add up to happy days for the opposition. But no. Try as it might, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), the largest opposition group, can muster a public approval rating of just 10%, compared to 28% for the LDP. (Mori himself is worse off than his party at 19%.) The opposition is hobbled in that it has virtually no track record. The LDP has been in government for all but 10 months out of the last 45 years. And after the brief non-LDP administrations of 1993-94 disintegrated, opposition parties kept bickering, splitting, merging, disappearing and reforming. They even jumped into coalitions with the LDP, first the socialists, now the New Conservatives and the Buddhist-backed New Komeito, leaving voters distrustful of what they stand for.\n\nThe main issues of the election are the fragile economy, the huge public debt left over from repeated stimulus spending, crime, and much needed reforms of pensions, education and the police. But what the LDP and its partners are emphasizing on the stump is that they are not the opposition. \"Whether you choose us to lead the stable government that carries our reform platform or you choose an unstable chaotic government led by opposition parties is en-tirely up to you,\" Kanzaki Takenori, leader of the ruling coalition's New Komeito, told voters. The opposition counters that it is not the LDP. \"Let's bid farewell to old politics, in which money has recklessly been spent on public construction works, and bring about a new politics of democracy,\" said DPJ leader Hatoyama Yukio.\n\nMatsuda Kimio, a Tokyo civil servant, can only sigh. \"This is supposed to be a very important election because we will choose Dietmen who will make policies for Japan in the next century, but I'm frustrated because none of the parties or their leaders appear capable of addressing what they really want to do,\" he says. But if politicians bear a grave responsibility for the state of Japanese politics, so do voters who keep electing them. \"People call it the Millennium elections, but in reality we lack focus in these polls, with little substantial debate about specific policies except for the unfitness of Mori as a national leader,\" says Miyagawa Takayoshi, head of the Center of Political Public Relations in Tokyo. \"We are asking ourselves about the political fitness or unfitness of ourselves -- the Japanese and the Japanese political system -- in this election.\"\n\nOne of the most obvious signs of the problem with Japanese politics is the growing number of parliamentarians who inherit their seats. \"I am a total rookie. Please help me up with your warm support,\" said 26-year-old Obuchi Yuko when she opened her campaign in rural Gunma prefecture, 100 km north of Tokyo. Sounds like a dubious opening line for a politician appealing for votes. But it may be a winner since it emphasizes that she is a stand-in for her father Keizo, the late prime minister. And why not? Her father probably used a similar line during the first of his 12 successful campaigns to keep the seat that had been held by his father. The Obuchis are not alone. Over one-fourth of lawmakers in the outgoing Diet are sons and daughters of politicians. Analysts say it is a sign that politics in Japan is more dependent on personal ties between voters and candidates than on policy issues, especially in the rural districts that are the LDP's stronghold.\n\nThe traditional work of a politician is to win office by meeting all the people he or she can, and then to retain office by funneling pork-barrel projects toward home while attending as many weddings and funerals of constituents as possible. Once the support and fund-raising system is in place, it can take on a life of its own. \"Having a Diet member has become a pro-fitable family business in Japan, which the family and the election machine won't let go,\" says Miyagawa. That makes it difficult for new blood with new ideas to enter politics. The retirement of former PM and LDP kingmaker Takeshita Noboru, 76, is widely regarded as heralding a generational change in the hidebound party. It would be more of one if his brother Wataru, 53, were not the favorite to succeed him in the rural Shimane prefecture seat.\n\nSo who will win? The 500-seat Diet will shrink to 480 in the new session. The ruling coalition has set a target of 254 compared to the 336 places it now holds. The LDP, which has 267 seats on its own, wants to retain at least 229. The 96-seat DPJ only says it wants to win more seats than the LDP. The main determinant may be the weather. If rain keeps turnout below 60%, the ruling coalition should do well. If the weather is good and turnout climbs above 70%, the opposition may fare better. (Turn-out at the last polls in 1996 was 59.7%.) If the ruling coalition keeps a majority, Mori is likely to keep his job. But unless it does spectacularly, given his many missteps already, he is not expected to last much beyond the Group of Eight summit in July.\n\nThe one reason for hope in the up-coming elections is that a small but growing number of citizens are taking matters into their own hands. Activists like the Osaka-based Citizens' Union have come up with lists of candidates they deem unfit for office, borrowing an idea that proved effective in South Korea's parliamentary polls last April. Names like that of PM Mori himself were prominent. On a more positive note, citizens groups have held or are organizing more than 220 public fo-rums, nearly one for each of the 300 single-seat constituencies, where candidates are asked to explain their policy stances. Such meetings were almost unknown in the last polls. Perhaps not in this election, and despite the moribundity of the political system, voters may eventually be able to bring some life to Japanese democracy.\n\nWith reporting by Murakami Mutsuko/Tokyo\n\nWrite to Asiaweek at mail@web.asiaweek.com\n\nThis edition's table of contents | Asiaweek.com Home\n\nQuick Scroll: More stories from Asiaweek, TIME and CNN\n\nLATEST HEADLINES:\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nU.S. secretary of state says China should be 'tolerant'\n\nMANILA\n\nPhilippine government denies Estrada's claim to presidency\n\nALLAHABAD\n\nFaith, madness, magic mix at sacred Hindu festival\n\nCOLOMBO\n\nLand mine explosion kills 11 Sri Lankan soldiers\n\nTOKYO\n\nJapan claims StarLink found in U.S. corn sample\n\nBANGKOK\n\nThai party announces first coalition partner\n\nTIME:\n\nCOVER: President Joseph Estrada gives in to the chanting crowds on the streets of Manila and agrees to make room for his Vice President\n\nTHAILAND: Twin teenage warriors turn themselves in to Bangkok officials\n\nCHINA: Despite official vilification, hip Chinese dig Lamaist culture\n\nPHOTO ESSAY: Estrada Calls Snap Election\n\nWEB-ONLY INTERVIEW: Jimmy Lai on feeling lucky -- and why he's committed to the island state\n\nASIAWEEK:\n\nCOVER: The DoCoMo generation - Japan's leading mobile phone company goes global\n\nBandwidth Boom: Racing to wire - how underseas cable systems may yet fall short\n\nTAIWAN: Party intrigues add to Chen Shui-bian's woes\n\nJAPAN: Japan's ruling party crushes a rebel ì at a cost\n\nSINGAPORE: Singaporeans need to have more babies.
