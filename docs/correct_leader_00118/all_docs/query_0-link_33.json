        "text": "Prime Minister Fumio Kishida appointed a record-tying five women to ministerial posts in his Cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday, as well as one to a key position in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as he aims to increase the number of female executives in politics and business.\n\nFor longtime observers, some of them are familiar names. Or to be more precise, their fathers — who were political heavyweights in the 1990s and 2000s — are. Of the six female executives, four of them followed in their fathers' footsteps and became politicians.\n\nOne of the most notable is Yuko Obuchi, the new LDP election committee chairperson in charge of coordinating candidates."
