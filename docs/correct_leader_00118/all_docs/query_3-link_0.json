        "text": "Obuchi Keizo (born June 25, 1937, Nakanojō, Gumma prefecture, Japan—died May 14, 2000, Tokyo) was a Japanese politician who was prime minister from July 1998 to April 2000 and is credited with reversing Japan’s economic downturn.\n\nObuchi received a degree in English literature from Waseda University, Tokyo, in 1962. The following year, he won the seat his father had held in the House of Representatives, becoming the youngest person ever elected to the Diet (parliament). Although he was often said to be bland and undistinguished, his political career was successful. In 1973 he was appointed deputy director general in the prime minister’s office and in 1987 chief cabinet secretary. As he rose through the ranks of the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), he became known particularly for the ability to forge compromises among its factions. He became deputy secretary-general of the party in 1984 and secretary-general in 1993. In 1997 he was appointed foreign minister, and on July 24, 1998, following LDP election losses, he succeeded Hashimoto Ryūtarō as president of the party."
