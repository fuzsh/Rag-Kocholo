        "text": "CNN International World News\n\nMemorial Service Held For Former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi\n\nAired June 8, 2000 - 1:08 a.m. ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\nCOLLEEN MCEDWARDS, WORLD NEWS: World leaders are in Japan to pay their last respects to the late prime minister Keizo Obuchi. His funeral is getting under way in Tokyo, and CNN's Tokyo bureau chief Marina Kamimura joins us now.\n\nMarina?\n\nMARINA KAMIMURA, CNN TOKYO BUREAU CHIEF: Hi, Colleen. Well, former prime minister Keizo Obuchi's ashes have just been carried up to the altar at the Nippon Budokan. There you see them being placed there in a bed of orchids and chrysanthemums that have been arranged there.\n\nThe altar that you're seeing in this hall arranged to depict a scene from Okinawa, one of the places that Mr. Obuchi held very dear to his heart. There are some 6,000 people attending this event, including hundreds of foreign dignitaries - including world leaders such as U.S. president Bill Clinton, Indonesia's president Abdurrahman Wahid and Australia's prime minister John Howard.\n\nYou can also see the family there. That is Mrs. Obuchi, Chizuko Obuchi. Her son was the one who actually carried the ashes down that long aisle in the Nippon Budokan, which is one of Japan's largest halls for occasions both of the sad and happy kind, of course.\n\nColleen?\n\nMCEDWARDS: Marina, I know that Mr. Obuchi was known as a soft- spoken politician, a consensus-builder. How will he be remembered politically in Japan?\n\nKAMIMURA: Mostly we can say that it's likely that Prime Minister Obuchi will be remembered as the man who came into the office, who came into office and was able to effect a change in the economy here. As you can recall, the economy has been in a recession for the better part of a decade now, and he'll be remembered mostly for coming in at that moment of crisis and helping to turn the situation around there.\n\nColleen?\n\nMCEDWARDS: All right. CNN's Marina Kamimura. And Mr. Obuchi suffered a stroke. He died on May 14 at the age of 62.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (speaking Japanese)\n\nMCEDWARDS: You are watching a funeral ceremony for former prime minister Keizo Obuchi in Japan, a day of mourning there, a day when Mr. Obuchi is being honored and remembered by some 6,000 people, people of Japan and also dignitaries from around the world.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (speaking Japanese)\n\nMCEDWARDS: Former prime minister Keizo Obuchi suffered a stroke. He passed away on May 14 at the age of 62. You are watching a ceremony in remembrance of him. His ashes have been brought to the area. The ceremony is under way. A moment of silence will be held in tribute for former prime minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (speaking Japanese)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMCEDWARDS: You are watching live pictures, a day of mourning in Japan for former prime minister Keizo Obuchi, who passed away at the age of 62. He is being honored and remembered. The current Japanese prime minister Yoshiro Mori is chairing the funeral ceremony. Other world leaders have gathered in Tokyo for this service.\n\n(MUSIC)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE (speaking Japanese)\n\nMCEDWARDS: The ceremony continues. CNN's Marina Kamimura joins us now to talk more about Mr. Obuchi's legacy in Japan. Marina?\n\nKAMIMURA: Well, Colleen, you've just seen the guards of honor of the self-defense forces just walk out of the hall, followed by a minute of silence. And now you see dignitaries such as U.S. president Bill Clinton, also beside him there U.S. ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley. Standing by is a video on Mr. Obuchi is played before the audience.\n\n(VIDEOTAPE IN JAPANESE)\n\nMCEDWARDS: This is obviously a video that is being shown at the funeral service looking back at former prime minister Keizo Obuchi's life and his service to Japan. He was known as a soft-spoken politician who did take significant steps to try to revive Japan's economy. He has left Japan in the hands of the current prime minister, Yoshiro Mori.\n\nAnd you've been watching a memorial service to honor former prime minister Keizo Obuchi.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nEND\n\nTO ORDER VIDEOTAPES AND TRANSCRIPTS OF CNN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMMING, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE THE SECURE ONLINE ORDER FROM LOCATED AT www.fdch.com"
