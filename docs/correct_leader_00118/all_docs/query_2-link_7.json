        "text": "His period of stewardship was marked by the decision to put Japan on a huge public spending plan to pull it out of its worst recession for 50 years.\n\n\"He did what needed to be done - bringing stability and a sense of security to the Japanese economy,\" said Keith Henry, a public policy analyst for the Tokyo-based Asia Strategy.\n\nRegional importance\n\nThese efforts to stimulate the sluggish economy had the effect of at least halting the economy's decline.\n\nBut they have not proved enough to set Japan's economy roaring again - and have left his successors with a ballooning deficit to deal with.\n\nFollowing a drawn-out recession, Japan had seen its economy grow for the first six months of 1999.\n\nBut hopes for a recovery were quickly dashed when gross domestic product shrank again in the second half of the year.\n\nThe news of his death led to a series of tributes from other leaders in the region, many noting the role he played in helping the region recover speedily from the economic crisis of 1998.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the death of Mr Obuchi was a great loss to the region.\n\nHistory will judge\n\nJapan's relations with Singapore and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \"deepened under his leadership,\" said Mr Goh.\n\nHe said Mr Obuchi had \"extended a helping hand\" when the region was hit by the economic and financial crisis.\n\nHe said the Obuchi Plan, an economic package initiated to develop human resources in the region, \"would benefit many when implemented\".\n\nHis successor, Yoshiro Mori, said: \"He dealt decisively with important measures affecting this nation's economic revival as well as its internal and foreign policies\".\n\nStock market calmed\n\n\"The economy has been in a very serious condition and Obuchi's hard work brought brighter prospects,\" said Yoshiro Mori.\n\nPerhaps because his policy making was based on consensus, it has survived fairly smoothly his illness and death.\n\nJapan's stock markets shook off worries over the political and economic fallout.\n\nThe general view has been that economic policy was pretty much on auto-pilot given that parliament passed the massive spending package earlier this year.\n\nMr Obuchi had pledged when he became prime minister that he would everything necessary to get the economy growing again.\n\nFor a while it appeared to be working, but the recent downturn, with a slip back into a technical recession, means that only time will tell whether this unassuming politician had achieved his goal."
