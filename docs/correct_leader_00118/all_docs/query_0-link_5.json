        "text": "Solo tour of the world\n\nWhile in Berlin,\n\nObuchi earned money by working as\n\na TV camera crew assistant.\n\nAfter receiving his B.A. from Waseda in March 1962, Obuchi went on to pursue graduate studies in political science at the same university. But his desire to learn more about politics in the hope of becoming a politician himself was not satisfied by academic studies, and so at age 25 Obuchi set off on a trip around the world by himself to see conditions in various countries with his own eyes.\n\nObuchi departed in January 1963. His first destination was Okinawa, a Japanese territory that was then under the administration of the United States. From there he went on to Taiwan, Thailand, Pakistan, India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America, and South America. His solo travels, which lasted nine months, took him to 38 countries.\n\nThe world in 1963 was in the midst of the East-West cold war that pitted the United States against the Soviet Union. Japanese people still required special permission to travel overseas, and Obuchi's trip was more like an adventure than a tour. Carrying just one suitcase, he had to work as he traveled to help cover his expenses. He ran especially low on money while he was in Europe, and so he took on a variety of jobs, such as dishwasher and assistant aikido instructor. The most physically demanding was his work as a TV camera crew assistant in Berlin, which was then a focal point of the East-West confrontation. Obuchi's job was to run along with the TV crew lugging a heavy camera battery day after day; strong as he was, he could hardly stand by the time the day's work was done.\n\nThe young Obuchi's travels\n\ntook him from Asia to Africa,\n\nEurope, and the Americas.\n\n(The course shown here has\n\nbeen somewhat abbreviated\n\nfor simplicity.)\n\nMeeting with Robert Kennedy\n\nRobert Kennedy's address to Waseda University\n\nThe highlight of Obuchi's travels was his meeting with Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Obuchi did not have any special connection or letter of introduction to rely on. Instead he composed a letter of his own requesting the chance to have a meeting, and he carried it in person to Kennedy's secretary's office. In the letter he described how impressed he had been to hear the Attorney General speak at Waseda during his visit to Japan in February 1962.\n\nA week later, when Obuchi had half given up on being able to meet Kennedy, he got a call from the Attorney General's secretary telling him, \"The Attorney General says he will meet you.\" Going to the Department of Justice at the appointed time on the following day, Obuchi was greeted warmly by Kennedy, who thanked him for listening to his speech and encouraged him to pursue his dream of a political career: \"Tomorrow belongs to young people like you. Let's meet again in Washington after you become a politician,\" Kennedy said, and presented him a tie clasp commemorating the election of his brother John F. Kennedy as president.\n\nDeeply impressed by Kennedy's openness, the young Obuchi resolved that when he became a politician, he would maintain his accessibility and be ready to meet anybody.\n\nObuchi went on to visit South America, and in September 1963 he returned to Japan. In November of the same year he ran for election to the Japanese House of Representatives, and he won, becoming the youngest candidate elected.\n\nObuchi's nine-month trip around the world, marked by his meeting with Robert Kennedy and a wealth of other experiences, may be termed the starting point of his career as a politician, which started formally with his election to the Diet at age 26. | Top page | Chronology | Political Career | Personal Angles |\n\nPhotos courtesy of Munakata Satoshi, Kyodo News, and Kyusyu Asahi-Broadcasting."
