The government focused on economic revival, with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa recalled to the position of Finance Minister, and introduced policies designed to stimulate the economy through tax cuts and public spending increases.[2][3]\n\nObuchi reshuffled his cabinet twice, firstly in January 1999 after having negotiated a coalition agreement with the Liberal Party. This did not bring about any major change in personnel other than to bring Liberal Takeshi Noda into government as Home Minister, and reduce the number of ministers by doubling up portfolios.[4] The second reshuffle in October 1999 was a more substantial reconstruction, and took place following Obuchi's re-election as LDP president. At the same time, the coalition expanded again to include the New Komeito, beginning the long-running LDP-NKP partnership.[5] The coalition continued until April 2000 when Liberal Leader Ichirō Ozawa decided to withdraw from the arrangement, causing a section of the Liberal Party to break away and form the New Conservative Party, which remained in the government.[6]\n\nThe Obuchi cabinet ended in early April 2000 when Obuchi fell into a coma after suffering a serious, and ultimately fatal stroke. With the Prime Minister unable to discharge his duties, Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki served as Acting Prime Minister for several days, until the cabinet determined to resign and Yoshirō Mori was chosen to replace Obuchi.[7][8][9]\n\nObuchi's election demonstrated how the Diet was divided following the 1998 upper house election. In the House of Representatives, Obuchi was elected on the first ballot, however the first ballot in the House of Councillors did not produce a majority for any candidate. In the subsequent runoff vote, opposition leader Naoto Kan won with the support of all opposition parties allied against the LDP. This did not affect Obuchi's appointment as Prime Minister, as the constitution stipulates that in such a scenario, the will of the lower house prevails.[10]\n\n30 July 1998 House of Representatives\n\nAbsolute majority (251/500) required Choice First Vote Votes YKeizō Obuchi\n\n268 / 500\n\nNaoto Kan\n\n164 / 500\n\nOthers and Abstentions (Including Speaker and Deputy)\n\n68 / 500\n\nSource Diet Minutes -
