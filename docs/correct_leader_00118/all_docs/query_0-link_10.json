        "text": "Keizo Obuchi, who has died aged 62, of complications from a stroke, was the kind of Japanese politician about whom western commentators scratch their heads and wonder how he ever made it to high office. He was totally lacking in charisma, a poor public speaker and unimpressive in appearance. When people described him as \"ordinary\" and \"plodding\", he did not wholly disagree, and when the American media likened him to cold pizza, he confined himself to the mild-mannered response that pizza can be heated up.\n\nWith so much demonstrably not in his favour, how was it that Obuchi became leader of the most successful political party (in terms of years in office) in any postwar democracy, and prime minister of the country with the largest economy in the world after the US? The answers lie in his good fortune in possessing so many of the attributes which an effective politician needs in Japan, and against which the shortcomings mentioned above pale into insignificance.\n\nFirst, he was lucky enough to be born a male, in a political system where, typically, his first cabinet, in July 1998, contained the usual solitary token female. Second, he was fortunate enough to have a politician for a father, whose support network he could inherit. Third, he was affable, a good listener and so practised in consensus-building that it seemed like second nature. Fourth, he could hide his considerable abilities behind a mask of ordinariness and, hence, put people at their ease.\n\nObuchi was born in rural Gunma prefecture, a heartland of conservative politics in Japan. In 1958, he entered Waseda, a top private university in Tokyo, majoring in English literature. While there, he kept fit by taking aikido classes, and practised oratory in the speech club - though his later career removed all traces of these pursuits.\n\nAfter graduation in 1962, Obuchi was inclined to stay on at Waseda and take a higher degree in politics, but dropped out after a few months and went abroad to travel. In later life, he often recalled meeting Robert Kennedy on the American leg of his round-the-world trip, and claimed that this inspired him to become a politician. This was probably a rationalisation of a career choice that social pressures and family expectations made virtually unavoidable.\n\nObuchi returned to Japan in September 1963, and went straight into an election campaign in the Gunma third constituency. Although two formidable Liberal Democratic party politicians, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Takeo Fukuda (both of whom went on to become prime minister) were in the contest, the multi-member system allowed Obuchi to be elected along side his seniors - he once described himself as \"a noodle shop between two skyscrapers\". At 26, he became the youngest representative in the lower house of the Japanese national assembly.\n\nFrom then on, Obuchi's progress was impeccably conventional. The multi-member constituency system meant that he had to join a different LDP faction to Nakasone's and Fukuda's. The faction he ended up in was that of Kakuei Tanaka, who continued as godfather of the LDP even after being convicted in 1983 for his part in the Lockheed scandal. Tanaka's faction remained the largest and most powerful group within the LDP throughout successive changes of leadership, first to Noboru Takeshita and then to Obuchi himself.\n\nIn addition to working his way up in his faction, Obuchi met all the other requirements of a rising LDP politician. Consistent delivery of material benefits to his constituency meant that he was returned in 12 successive elections, and he occupied, in turn, all the key positions which together serve as apprenticeship for the top job. These included chief cabinet secretary in 1987, party secretary-general in 1991 and minister of foreign affairs in 1997.\n\nObuchi's turn eventually came in July 1998, when Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned after taking responsibility for the LDP's poor performance in the upper house election. Among the general public, Obuchi was the least popular candidate for the LDP presidency, but with the votes of the third largest faction, led by Kiichi Miyazawa, to add to his own support, the result was not in doubt. Obuchi repaid Miyazawa with the finance ministry, and the make-up of his cabinet dutifully reflected the factional balance within the party, his own faction and Miyazawa's getting five posts each.\n\nIn a sense, Obuchi wrote his own political obituary when he declared, in his first policy speech, that he was determined to set the Japanese economy on the path to recovery - this was the yardstick by which he invited judgment. Twenty months and two enormous emergency economic packages later, the economy remains on its knees, unemployment is higher than ever and government indebtedness stands at 125% of GDP.\n\nNone of this should be put down to Obuchi's inadequacy. He was a superlative practitioner of politics Japanese-style, and had considerable personal charm. But the qualities that brought him the top job ensured that he would be a link in a chain, not someone to sever the chain that binds Japan.\n\nHe and his wife Chizuko had a son and two daughters.\n\nKeizo Obuchi, politician, born June 25 1937; died May 14 2000"
