        "text": "Mr Aoki said he would decide whether to dissolve the cabinet, so that a new leader could be installed, once Mr Obuchi's prognosis became more clear.\n\nThe acting prime minister had previously said that he had held a conversation with the ailing prime minister on Sunday.\n\n\"Obuchi said we could not have any delay in our measures to cope with the volcanic eruption so he appointed me as acting prime minister,\" Mr Aoki said.\n\nAt that stage, Mr Obuchi was said to be \"calm\" and \"speaking clearly\".\n\nProlonged hospital stay\n\nReports from Tokyo say the prime minister's resignation is expected to come in the next day or two.\n\nLocal newspapers are already speculating on who might succeed Mr Obuchi, as Mr Aoki is seen as only a temporary replacement.\n\nTwo politicians named were Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and the secretary-general of Mr Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Yoshiro Mori.\n\nBBC Tokyo correspondent Juliet Hindell says the process of finding a new leader should be a smooth one, as other political parties are not rocking the boat at the moment.\n\nUnder pressure\n\nMr Obuchi, 62, suffers from a heart condition for which he has a pacemaker. He was taken to Juntendo Hospital at 0100 local time on Sunday (1600 GMT Saturday).\n\nWhen he became prime minister in July 1998, questions were raised about the state of his health, but there have been no reported problems since he took office.\n\nEarlier, NHK television reported that Mr Obuchi had become severely tired from handling the government's response to the volcano on the island of Hokkaido.\n\nMount Usu exploded into life on Wednesday for the first time in more than 20 years, forcing thousands of people to take shelter.\n\nOver the past few days, the prime minister has also had to deal with the break-up of his governing coalition.\n\nThe prime minister governs with a large majority in parliament because the LDP is allied with the Buddhist-backed Komeito Party and the smallest member, the Liberal Party.\n\nBut Mr Obuchi said on Saturday that the three-party coalition would break up after he rejected demands from Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa for a series of reforms.\n\nThe break-up led to opposition demands over the weekend for a snap election.\n\nThe Japanese Government is also preparing to host the G8 leaders' summit in July."
