ALBRIGHT\n\nJapan: Death of Former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi\n\nI was deeply saddened by the death of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Sunday, May 14.\n\nMr. Obuchi was committed both as prime minister and, earlier, as foreign minister to strengthening the U.S.-Japan relationship, and thanks largely to his efforts our ties have never been better. He also strengthened Japan's relations with the Republic of Korea, China and Russia and reopened a dialogue with North Korea. He worked tirelessly to restore health to the Japanese economy and joined with the US and others to resolve the Asian financial crisis. Mr. Obuchi achieved an impressive foreign policy and domestic record in a short period.\n\nI would like to note especially his strong personal interest in the G-8 Summit to be held in July in Okinawa. President Clinton and other world leaders will, I know, seek to make the Okinawa Summit a great success, in fond memory and admiration for a fine leader and good friend.\n\nHis passing is a great loss, not only for the people of Japan and the United States, but for the people of the world. Most of all, I offer my heartfelt sympathy to Mrs. Chizuko Obuchi and their family.\n\n(end text)\n\n(Distributed by the Office of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State.
