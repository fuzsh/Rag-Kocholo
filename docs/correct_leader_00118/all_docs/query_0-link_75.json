        "text": "TOKYO -- The Cabinet Office refused to release a document on the selection process for the previous Heisei era name in 1989, on the basis that publicizing it could adversely affect future era name selections, following a freedom-of-information request by the Mainichi Shimbun in May.\n\nThe office's General Affairs Division said its policy of not disclosing such information after a new era name has been announced remains unchanged. \"The question as to whether we should disclose the records has nothing to do with Japan's change of the era name to Reiwa. We can't tell you anything further at the working level,\" an official for the division explained. \"There is a possibility that our policy will change in the future.\"\n\nThe latest decision has highlighted again the government's reluctance to disclose information regarding era names.\n\nThe Mainichi Shimbun asked the Cabinet Office in May this year for access to documents on the administrative procedure for the era name change from Showa to Heisei in 1989.\n\nHowever, the office chose to withhold one document about the selection process. The document could mention who came up with the name and how candidate names were narrowed down.\n\nA notice sent to the Mainichi cited three reasons why the Cabinet Office decided not to disclose the information:\n\n1) Such information could unnecessarily influence those tasked with devising future era names, adversely affecting the neutrality of decision-making;\n\n2) Disclosure could hinder the process of selecting an era name;\n\n3) Personal information on those involved in devising the era name would identify them and allow the public to pry into what kind of names they proposed.\n\nThe Mainichi Shimbun had also asked for access to the same document last year, but the Cabinet Office did not disclose it for similar reasons.\n\nA disclosure last year could have affected the process of selecting the current Reiwa era name. However, the latest rejection can be interpreted as a refusal to disclose the information in the future as well.\n\nKazuhiro Hayakawa, professor of administrative law at Toyo University, pointed out that although it is understandable to withhold the personal information of those who devised the era name, some other details could be released.\n\nThe public can access documents on the \"Taisho\" (1912-1926) and \"Showa\" (1926-1989) era names' selection processes under the Public Records and Archives Management Act. The law stipulates that official documents whose retention period, limited to 30 years in principle, has expired should be disclosed.\n\nThirty years have passed since documents regarding the previous Heisei era name's selection were compiled. However, the Cabinet Office decided in March to extend its retention period under the law by five years until the end of March 2024.\n\nAs to the reason for the extension, officials cited work related to the new Reiwa era name, such as ceremonies to be held later this year related to the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito.\n\nHowever, the Cabinet Office has not ruled out disclosing documents relating to the selection of the previous era name before their transfer to the National Archives of Japan once the retention period ends.\n\n\"Whenever we receive a disclosure request, we make a judgment in accordance with the freedom-of-information system,\" a Cabinet Office representative told reporters when it decided in March to extend the retention period of the relevant documents.\n\n(Japanese original by Takenori Noguchi, Political News Department)"
