        "text": "Debsirin School, for many Thais, brings to mind excellent education and an outstanding soccer team.\n\nBut few people know that this 129-year-old school has been a living museum since 2012. Inside, the history of the school is told through various types of media under the theme of “From Love and Gratitude to Social Contribution”.\n\nStepping into the school’s red and yellow Gothic Choduek Laohasetthi Building, you will first meet volunteer student guides, then view the memorabilia displayed on the ground floor. While walking to the first floor, you will see a blackboard displaying the best students of the year since 1885. In the hallway, you will see an exhibition on the lives and photos of the school’s founders and supporters.\n\nKing Rama V, who gave the school its name, established Wat Depsirin in 1876 on his 25th birthday, in memory of his mother, Queen Debsirindra. In 1885, his half-brother, Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, founded a school in Wat Debsirin, as the king wished to have schools set up on temple grounds. The construction of the school’s first building, Maen Naruemit, began in 1895. It was followed by the Choduek Laohasetthi Building.\n\nHRH Prince Bhanurangsi Savangwongse Krom Phraya Bhanubandh Wongseworadej, a son of King Rama IV and Queen Debsirindra and the younger brother of King Rama V, had Maen Naruemit Building constructed in dedication to his late wife, Mon Maen Bhanubandh Na Ayudhya. The first building was ready for use in 1902. In 1924, Princess Nibha Nobhadol, one of King Rama V’s daughters, had the Nibha Nobhadol Building constructed to mark her 28th birthday — the age of Queen Debsirindra at the time of her death.\n\nTurning west and strolling on the balcony, past real classrooms where students are learning, you will take the “Path of Time” to view an exhibition on the development of education in Siam and Debsirin School. This school was among Siam’s first royally instituted schools for commoners. At the time, the temple’s sermon pavilion served as the classroom.\n\nThen comes a highlight. Through a video-mapping technique based on pre-World War II models of the school buildings, you can explore the history of the school and the support from the kings and royals which led to the Debsirin spirit. The Debsirin spirit is comprised of esprit de corps, gratitude and commitment to social contribution. After that, you can see old photos and memorabilia of royals who supported the institution, as well as artefacts they gave to the school. You will also see the school visit book which is signed by several monarchs and royals. A highlight is the signature of HM King Rama VIII, who was once a student of Debsirin School.\n\nThe next room simulates the atmosphere of a classroom from the past. You can sit on chairs in front of a blackboard in a mock-up of a real classroom. You will see school activities portrayed in old pictures and certificates and learn how the headmasters and teachers taught their students according to the Debsirin sprit and the school’s Pali motto, “Na Siya Lokavaddhano”, meaning “Be not a useless person”. In the same room, you will learn about the school emblem, its symbolic colours and the meaning of the school song, Aho Kumarn.\n\nNext is the alumni hall of fame, which includes cabinet members, senior officials, leading businessmen and national footballers. Among them are the late former prime ministers MR Seni Pramoj and Gen Chatichai Choonhavan, royal scholar Prof ML Jirayu Noppawong, leading biologist Prof Khloom Watcharobol, writers Kularb Saipradit (Sri Burapha), Malai Chuphinit (Riam Erng), Chote Phraephan (Yakhob), Prabda Yoon and race car driver Prince Bira.\n\nThere is also a display of old student uniforms, rings, badges and pins in a small adjacent room.\n\nUpon reaching the ground floor, you will enter the Famous Debsirin Room, reflecting the school’s excellence in academic performance, sports, literature, music and art. You can take pictures while wearing the school’s old and current uniforms through an augmented reality technique.\n\nWalking a few steps further, you will enter a big room displaying old and current curricula, old scientific equipment, sporting gear and trophies. The last section features the present day and future of the school, which still adheres to the spirit, love, gratitude and contribution to society."
