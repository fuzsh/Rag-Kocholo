        "text": "Anna Harriette Leonowens (born Nov. 6, 1831, Ahmadnagar, India—died Jan. 19, 1915, Montreal, Que., Can.) was a British writer and governess employed by King Mongkut (Rama IV) of Siam for the instruction of his children, including his son and successor, Prince Chulalongkorn.\n\nEdwards spent her childhood in India. She married Thomas Leon Owens, a clerk, in 1849; the two surnames were later merged to form “Leonowens.” Following the marriage, the couple spent several years in Australia. While living in Malaysia in 1859, Leonowens was widowed when her husband, who had been managing a hotel, succumbed to a stroke. She then settled in Singapore, where she supported her family by operating a school until 1862, when she was invited by King Mongkut to serve as governess to the royal children. For five years Leonowens was part of the royal household in Bangkok, and she both tutored Mongkut’s children and advised him on relations with the West.\n\nAfter leaving Siam, Leonowens wrote two books, The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870) and The Romance of the Harem (1872). According to Mongkut’s biographer Abbot Low Moffat (Mongkut, the King of Siam), Leonowens’s accounts of Siamese court life were greatly exaggerated, and her description of King Mongkut as a cruel tyrant was unfair. Later scholarship determined that Leonowens had falsified details of her early life, which included the claim that she was born in Wales in 1834 to an army captain and his wife. It was speculated that she had done so to conceal her mixed English and Indian heritage. Her lower-class background was suggested as another possible motivation for obscuring her origins."
