        "text": "British travel writer, governess, educator and social activist, Anna Leonowens was best known as the governess of King Mongkut of Siam (now Thailand). She taught his children, including his successor, Prince Chulalongkorn. Anna received an invitation from King Mongkut to serve as a tutor to his children and she became a part of the royal household in Bangkok. She also became an advisor for western relations. She became well-known for her memoirs chronicling her adventures. She is one of the most famous governesses in British history, but her story is complex. She reinvented her origin story to satisfy the strict Victorian code for employment as a governess and later embellished her stories with King Mongkut so much that in parts of Asia, her memoirs are still banned to this day. So just who was the real Anna? Why did she do what she did? And how should we remember her?\n\nThe Never-Ending Tragedies of Reinvention\n\nAnna Leonowens was born on November 5th, 1831 in Ahmednagar in India, three months after the death of her father Tom, a soldier. She spent her childhood in India. Anna’s stepfather was also in the service, meaning she often spent her days travelling from barrack to barrack. Her early years were doubtlessly difficult, yet those years helped to shape her moral and philosophical outlook on life. She learned a variety of languages, including Sanskrit, and developed a passion for education. Anna would later reinvent her birth and childhood for her memoirs, but none of what she wrote was true.\n\nThe truth of Anna’s early life is shrouded in mystery. We know she fell in love with an Irishman named Thomas, who had risen to the position of paymaster’s clerk. He was the only man Anna would ever love. However, Anna’s mother and stepfather objected to the union. They didn’t like the dashing Irishman. He had been downgraded from sergeant to private in his previous life as a soldier for an unspecified offence. Still, Anna defied her parents and married Thomas on Christmas Day 1849. They had their first child in the December of 1850, but their daughter died at just 17 months.\n\nFollowing the marriage, the couple spent several years in Australia. During this time Anna had a son, also named Thomas. Anna tried to establish a school for young ladies but tragedy struck again in 1854. Her second child died at just 13 months. Later that year, Anna had her third child, Avis Annie. A son, Louis, soon followed. The family left Australia abruptly in the April of 1857, sailing to Singapore, and then moving to Penang where Thomas found work as a hotel keeper. But tragedy would strike yet again. In the May of 1859, Anna lost Thomas. He died of a stroke. His death left Anna destitute and alone.\n\nHer solution? To return to Singapore to start afresh. Here, she would reinvent herself, completely changing her history, adopting a new identity as a Welsh-born lady of a British army major…\n\nThe Silenced Idyll and a Blessing from the King of Siam\n\nTo support her daughter Avis and her son Louis, her only two surviving children, Anna took up teaching and opened a school for the children of British officers in Singapore. It was not a huge success but it helped to establish Anna’s reputation as an educator. Anna was bereft. She was mourning the two children and husband she had lost. Her idyllic world had crumbled around her. But in Singapore, with a new, fictional backstory, Anna had a chance.\n\nThe truth was, Anna had never been to Wales. Or England. And probably not even Europe. She was no proper Englishwoman. She was more than familiar with her Asian surroundings. But all these stories she told gave her a new persona, status within the highest echelons of society. So many criticise her stories today, the lies she told. But look at what she lost. You can’t blame her. She had to survive and do whatever she could to support her two children as a widow. In those days, women in this situation had no help and no support. I think she’s a genius. A true survivor.\n\nIn 1862, something noteworthy happened. The Siamese consul approached Anna with an offer of work. She was to teach the wives and children of Mongkut, King of Siam. He wished to give his 39 wives and concubines, plus his 82 children, a modern, western education on scientific, secular lines. Anna sent her daughter Avis to school in England. Anna took her son with her to Bangkok.\n\nShe was now a teacher in the Siamese court.\n\nThe Elaborate Tales from the Siamese Court\n\nAnna’s relationship with the King is complex because quite a lot of what she wrote in her memoirs was embellished or even invented. What we do know and can prove is that Anna had a very strong relationship with the King’s harem. She also forged special relationships with the King’s children who were princes and princesses. All 82 of them. She promised not to impart Christianity on the family and she did not. Anna’s biographer described the teacher and the King as:\n\n[They were] both moral people, dedicated to walking the paths of virtue, though each had a different idea of what virtue entailed… but each had a firm belief in the divine, in the sacredness of life, and in the idea that a virtuous life required ceaseless effort to improve oneself and to serve the public good.\n\nAnna greatly admired and respected the culture of Siam. She was never critical or judgmental. She did, however, speak out against slavery that was common in the region. While she respected the King’s politics and intellectualism, she refused to accept his strongly ingrained dependence on slavery and misogyny. While her time in Siam was positive, it left an indelible mark on Anna. She successfully instructed the students she loved so much in humanities, language and science.\n\nAnna and her son lived in a small walled city of around 9,000 people named Nang Harm, which included the King’s enormous harem. Nang Harm had wide avenues, graceful houses, beautiful parks, rich flower gardens, shops and apartments. Those that lived here were members of the nobility as well as those who were needed to look after the city. Most women and children here were slaves. In this culture, that meant an obligation to another individual rather than servitude. While the standard of living was high, the harem was shackled. Anna was their salvation. That moment in the lives of the harem where they could learn all about the world around them. They called Anna ‘Mem’.\n\nShe was more than a governess. Far, far more.\n\nThe Unrivalled Access that Shocked Siam\n\nThis was an age when Siam was going international. Anna described part of her job as helping the King with his correspondence and serving as a sounding board on matters of international diplomacy. There is no reason to doubt her account. But the two were never on close terms. Anna taught the harem and children about the world but sometimes they refused to believe her. For example, they refused to believe that snow was real. In these instances, Anna would speak to the King as his word was never questioned. So the King would tell his harem and children, “Anna speaks the truth.” And that was that.\n\nThe respect Anna had was unique. There is evidence that Prince Chulalongkorn, heir apparent, was greatly influenced by Anna. In the future, as the new King, he would abolish slavery and enact great social reforms. We know that when Chulalongkorn met with Anna in London many years later, he told her that he had kept his promise to her that he would rule over a free Siam.\n\nThat said, some of what Anna wrote in her memoirs we know to be false. But Anna defended herself by saying that she never intended for her memoirs to be completely accurate, that her intentions for what she wrote was to document an inhumane social custom that degraded women. This point is completely ignored by her critics. Anna was right. The women in the harem were little more than playthings. She found this unbearable. Of course she would embellish. She aimed to shock and change society.\n\nThat she did.\n\nThe End of the Court and the Sensational Stories\n\nAnna served in court until 1867, a period of nearly six years. Although she carried a great deal of respect and a degree of political influence, she was not happy with the terms and conditions of her employment to her satisfaction. She left Siam in 1867 and wrote, ‘The Romance of the Harem’. She lectured widely and gained a modest income to support herself.\n\nIn 1868, King Mongkut fell ill and died. He made mention of Anna and his son in his will. Chulalongkorn succeeded his father at just 15. He wrote Anna a warm letter of gratitude for her services. She was not invited to resume her post but the two stayed close friends for many years. The King’s death was enough for Anna to move on to pasture’s new.\n\nShe sent Louis to boarding school and travelled with Avis to America. Here, Anna used her experiences to launch her successful writing and scholarly career. She wrote three books on her experiences in the King’s harem and she travelled America extensively lecturing on her experiences, as well as religion, feminism and why we should respect Asian cultures. She became a respected member of both the literary and scholarly communities. She even got to meet Harriet Beecher Stowe, one of Anna’s greatest sources of inspiration.\n\nAnna opened a school for girls in New York City in 1869 and began contributing travel articles to a Boston journal. She was accused of sensationalism in her writings and her portrayal of the royal courts drew great controversy in Asia. She heavily criticised King Mongkut, portraying him as cruel, eccentric and self-indulgent. But he spent 27 years as a Buddhist monk leading many to suspect that Anna was sensationalising her accounts.\n\nWhat people fail to realise is that slavery and other such cruelty was real. While Anna was embellishing and fabricating her accounts, as she said herself, it was never meant to be a historically accurate account. It was meant to highlight the barbaric nature of life under the King. As a feminist, Anna used elaborate language and fanciful tales to drive home her point, to make others listen. You can criticise Anna until the cows come home, but her plan worked.\n\nAnd Siam changed for the better.\n\nThe Last Tour of the Unmoved Critic\n\nAnna’s work was popular enough for her to live off and enter the lecture circuit. Her talks were popular. She was a vocal advocate for the rights of women and slaves, all in a time when most people in America could remember when slavery was legal. Women’s suffrage, too, was a heated debate. Her lectures struck close to home and that was by design.\n\nShe went on a tour of the world that took her as far away as Russia. She had offers of work but she decided to settle in Halifax in Canada. This is where Avis lived. And where Anna’s grandchildren were being born. She wanted a quiet family life after an eventful lifetime spent in Siam’s royal court and lecturing around the world. That said, she wasn’t ready to retire just yet. In Halifax, she helped establish a school of art and design, and she was active in the local and National Council of Women.\n\nAvis’s marriage to Thomas Fyshe, a Scottish banker and the cashier of the Bank of Nova Scotia, ended the family’s money woes. Anna returned to teaching and travelling the world. Along the way, she reunited with her son Louis, whom she had not seen in 19 years. When his wife died, he entrusted his children to Anna. Louis left the royal service in 1884 to start an import and export business: Louis T. Leonowens Ltd. It’s still going to this day.\n\nAnna met with King Chulalongkorn in London in 1897. During one speech, the new King thanked Anna in person. And then told her off for all her inaccuracies. Well, that’s awkward. He said to Anna, “Why did you write such a wicked book about my father… you know that you have made him utterly ridiculous.” Anna insisted she wrote ‘the whole truth’. She told Chulalongkorn:\n\n[Your father was] a ridiculous and a cruel, wicked man.\n\nThat’s brave. Would you say that to the King of Siam? Predictably, Anna never returned to Siam. She settled into family life in Canada, although she gave the occasional lecture here and there. She gave her last at the age of 78. And she died on January 19th, 1915 at the age of 83. She was interred in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. At the time of her death, she was an admired proponent of human rights and education. Wonderfully, on her headstone, it reads:\n\n‘Beloved Wife of Major Thomas Lorne Leonowens.’\n\nHer husband never rose beyond the rank of paymaster sergeant. Even in death, she was embellishing the truth…\n\nRemembrance of the Champion of a Free Siam\n\nHow should one remember Anna Leonowens? Today, historians ridicule her. The Thai hate her for what she said about their King. Many don’t believe a word she says. But here’s the thing: they’re all wrong. Yes, Anna elaborated. She embellished. She even made-up bits. But she did so to highlight the cruelty of slavery and the cruelty shown to women. So does it matter if it’s not historically accurate? Women were not treated well and slavery was very much real. Anna said herself she wrote what she wrote not to be historically accurate but to force people to act on genuine issues. I get why people are upset, but Anna made it clear from the start: what I write should not be taken as gospel truth. And if you accept that and are still mad, what then? Anna did not fabricate the situation in Siam. It was real.\n\nShe is one of the most famous human rights activists of her generation and there is no doubt that what she did had a profound impact. She was an adventurer whom history has not been kind to. But that should change. She helped free and build a modern nation. And she helped to change staunchly held conservative views. There is no denying that Anna is a legend and nothing less. Sometimes in life you have to take a radical approach to ensure radical change. That was Anna Leonowens.\n\nHer granddaughter, Anna Fyshe, said of Anna:\n\nHers was a spirit broad awake – to action, to literature, language, beauty in people and in scenes.\n\nToodle-Pip :}{:\n\nPost MQ: Comments, Likes & Follows Greatly Appreciated :)\n\nMy Other Blogs: The Indelible Life of Me | To Contrive & Jive"
