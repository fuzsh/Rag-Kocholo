        "text": "Read More\n\nKing Rama V is affectionately referred to as “The Royal Buddha” and is one of the most venerated monarchs in the history of Thailand. His Majesty is credited for his series of progressive reforms, later called the Chakri Reformation. His skilled diplomacy maintained his country’s independence, but perhaps most notable was his wholehearted love for his citizens and kingdom. Somdetch Phra Paramindr Maha Chulalongkorn was born on September 20, 1853, in Bangkok, Siam, to King Mongkut Rama IV and Queen Debsirindra. Adhering to royal Siam tradition, in 1866 Prince Chulalongkorn became a sāmaṇera (a novice monk) for a half-year at Wat Bawonniwet, a major Buddhist temple. The prince was first coronated on November 11, 1868. On November 16, 1873, the 20-year-old King Chulalongkorn was coronated for the second time and officially assumed his duties as king. He believed that reform was both right and necessary for the survival of his nation. His father had instilled in him the Theravada Buddhist concept of Dhammaraja, which is the principle that a king should be just and rule his people according to the Dharma and the Buddha’s teachings. His Majesty had also been taught by his European tutors about the Western principles of social justice and democracy, which he would model his developments upon. Following his coronation, King Chulalongkorn ordered the abolition of prostration, an ancient tradition that required all citizens to prostrate in the presence of Siamese royalty. The King also allowed his citizens to speak directly to him by holding public audiences. In 1878, the King declared that all subjects had the freedom to choose their own religion, including Christianity and Islam, without fearing persecution. One of the most notable orders of reform implemented by King Chulalongkorn was the abolition of slavery and the corvée (unpaid and unfree labor) system in Siam. The Slave Abolition Act in 1905 finally ended all forms of slavery in Siam. To commemorate this historic occasion, the current 100-baht monetary note depicts His Majesty King Chulalongkorn abolishing slavery."
