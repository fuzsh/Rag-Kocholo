        "text": "For further analysis, we broke down the data in the following ways:\n\nAdoption | Trends and Predictions | Industry\n\nThe Benefits of Agile Adoption\n\nClearly, there are some worthwhile benefits to adopting Agile. In this section, we’ll dive into those benefits in more detail, so you can get a picture of how Agile could work for your business. Here are the insights our research uncovered:\n\nOnly 9% of Agile projects fail.\n\nWhich is significant and impressive, especially when compared to the waterfall methodology. A considerable 29% of waterfall fail, which is over 3X more failures than Agile.\n\nAgile projects are nearly 1.5X more successful than waterfall projects.\n\nWhen it comes to success rate, Agile projects are successful 64% of the time, whereas waterfall projects are only successful 49% of the time.\n\nThe use of Full Scrum increases product quality by up to 250%.\n\nWhen teams create products using Full Scrum, defect density is significantly reduced. Those who did no estimates experienced over 20 defects, while those who used Full Scrum had less than ten defects.\n\nAgile teams are 25% more productive.\n\nIn fact, these teams are also 50 percent faster to market than non-agile teams, making them highly effective in the long run. Much of this can be attributed to Agile keeping teams more focused on the tasks at hand.\n\nAgile has helped 98% of companies become more successful.\n\nThis is why it’s no surprise that 71% of companies are implementing Agile, and several Fortune 500 companies have been drawn to Agile as well.\n\nAgile Adoption Statistics\n\nAdopting Agile comes with several benefits for companies, which is why so many companies are switching. For most, Agile comes with increased growth, productivity, quality, and more. Here are the facts:\n\nAfter adopting Agile, companies have experienced an average 60% growth in revenue and profit.\n\nHowever, of the 1,300 IT and business leaders surveyed worldwide, only a small portion could implement Agile fully and see these benefits. Therefore, Agile is best used when fully adopted and not only partially implemented.\n\nThe top 5 reasons teams switch to Agile include productivity, accountability, collaboration, prioritization, and feedback.\n\nWith the latter four contributing to increased productivity. In fact, increased communication and team focus contribute to a 25% increase in productivity on agile products.\n\nAround 80% of federal IT projects have chosen to adopt Agile.\n\nWhile not the root cause, this adoption likely coincides with the trend of shorter and less expensive IT projects. For instance, between 2004 and 2015, the duration of major federal IT projects decreased from nine years of average development time to less than two years.\n\nMore than any other factor, 44% of Agile projects fail due to a lack of experience with Agile methods.\n\nOther common reasons for failure include company culture clashing with Agile values (42%), lack of management (38%), and external pressure to continue older traditions like waterfall (37%). And this can have a huge cost, as the American government has lost a staggering $32 billion due to failed IT projects alone.\n\nAgile Trends and Predictions\n\nWhile it’s clear that Agile has become more popular over time, how fast has it actually grown? Further, it’s important to analyze where this methodology will go in the future. Our research shows that:\n\nThe number of companies adopting Agile has increased by up to 88% since 2002.\n\nIn 2002 the number of companies using Agile was around or just under 10%. However, over time that number has grown to 80% in some sectors. This is especially true for federal IT projects, which have seen a huge transition toward Agile methodology.\n\nAgile adoption ramped up in 2020, with 43 percent of organizations saying their momentum towards it has increased in the past 90 days.\n\nIn part, it could result from an increased number of remote workers, as these workers need to have more efficient communication with each other. In fact, 33% of organizations say they’re adopting Agile to help manage distributed teams.\n\nScrum is the most popular Agile framework, with 61% of respondents from 76 countries reporting that they use it.\n\nOne of Scrum’s main advantages is that development teams can work simultaneously rather than sequentially. However, other popular Agile frameworks include Kanban, Extreme Programming, Lean, Dynamic Systems Development Method, Crystal, Feature Driven Development, and more.\n\nJIRA software is the most popular software used in Agile management and development teams.\n\nJIRA software is popular due to its many capabilities. For example, Agile features in JIRA include issue types, including user stories and bugs, boards, workflows, backlog, roadmap, and multiple types of reporting charts.\n\nAgile by Industry Statistics\n\nWhile Agile adoption is growing ever more popular, there are also variations in popularity between different industries. According to our research:\n\n86% of international software developers use Agile.\n\nThis means the vast majority now use this methodology around the world. In fact, software development firms only plan to become more Agile as time goes on.\n\nOnly 27.4% of manufacturing companies rely entirely on Agile.\n\nWhile this number does seem much lower than other statistics mentioned, much of it can be attributed to a lack of full implementation. For example, 56.6% of manufacturing companies rely on a combination of methodologies, including Agile.\n\n88% of international workers and professionals believe Agile improves the quality of life.\n\nAnd this is coming from a wide range of respondents, representing 91 countries and 27 industries. With this in mind, a majority of people who work with Agile also approve of it.\n\nWhat companies use agile methodology?\n\nThe most well-known companies that use agile methodology are Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and Procter & Gamble. However, there are many other companies that use agile as well, to great effect. Here are some of those companies and how agile improved their business:\n\nCisco: defects were reduced by 40% when compared to waterfall\n\nBarclays: 300% increase in throughput\n\nPanera Bread: 25% increase in company sales\n\nPlayStation Network: Saved the company $30 million a year\n\nWhat is Agile project management?\n\nAgile project management is an iterative approach to building and managing software development projects. In general, some of Agile’s main focal points are creating continuous releases and using each iteration to implement customer feedback.\n\nOverall, on a basic level, Agile builds software over time from the start of the project instead of delivering a final project to the end of the cycle. If you’re unfamiliar, you might think of this in terms of game development, where a beta version is released to gather player feedback before the final product is released.\n\nHow widely used is Agile?\n\nAgile is widely used by at least 71% of U.S. companies. Additionally, Scrum is the most popular Agile framework, with 61% of respondents from 76 countries reporting that they use it.\n\nThis number is only increasing as well, as the number of companies adopting Agile has increased by up to 88% since 2002, where the number of companies using Agile was around or just under 10%. This is especially true for federal IT projects, where around 80% of federal IT projects have chosen to adopt Agile.\n\nWhat are Agile metrics?\n\nAgile metrics are standards that aid in monitoring a software development team throughout a software project’s development. The metrics mainly serve to inform the team on how productive they’ve been and also allow them to assess product quality. For these reasons, Agile metrics are an essential component of building software.\n\nWhat is so good about Agile?\n\nWhat’s so good about Agile is that it allows a team to critique, debug, and improve software more effectively during the development process. The system of testing prototypes and receiving customer feedback allows for highly tested products.\n\nFurther, this framework also supports prioritization and teamwork, as customer feedback and Agile metrics allow teams to assign tasks accurately.\n\nWhat percentage of projects use Agile methodology?\n\n80% of IT projects use Agile methodology. This is by far the majority, and since their widespread adoption of Agile, these federal IT projects have seen their average development time shrink from nine years to two years.\n\nAs far as the private sector goes, 71% of companies have or are implementing Agile, including several Fortune 500 companies, and 86% of software developers around the world use Agile methodology.\n\nIn 2020, as a significant number of companies moved to have the majority of their employees work remotely, 43% of organizations said they were moving more quickly in their efforts to adopt Agile, with 33% of companies saying they need it to help with managing teams whose members all work remotely.\n\nHow is success measured with Agile?\n\nSuccess is measured with Agile by measuring whether a project is completed on time or not. This is only one of many ways teams measure their success with Agile, but it’s the most common, with 58% of survey respondents saying they use this method.\n\nOn-time delivery doesn’t just mean finishing the project by a deadline; it also means meeting expectations about what is going to be delivered by that deadline.\n\nThe second-most common method of measuring success with Agile is through product quality, with 48% of those surveyed saying this is how they measure their success. With this method, meeting deadlines isn’t enough: The software also needs to have continuously positive testing results.\n\nOther common measures of success include customer/user satisfaction, productivity, and business value.\n\nWhat is the most popular Agile methodology?\n\nScrum is the most popular Agile methodology. 61% of survey respondents said they use it, the most of any other Agile framework. These respondents were spread out across 76 countries, showing that Scrum is the most popular choice around the world, not just in the U.S.\n\nMany people choose to use Scrum because teams can work simultaneously instead of only sequentially. This helps team members better coordinate on projects and complete them more efficiently – especially when they’re working remotely around the world.\n\nSome of the other popular Agile frameworks are Kanban, Extreme Programming, Lean, Dynamic Systems Development Method, Crystal, and Feature Driven Development."
