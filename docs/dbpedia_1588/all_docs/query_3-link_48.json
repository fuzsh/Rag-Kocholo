        "text": "Stemming from Toyota's lean manufacturing concept of the 1940s, software development teams have embraced agile methodologies to reduce waste and increase transparency, while quickly addressing their customers' ever-changing needs. A stark change from waterfall project management that focuses on \"big bang\" launches, agile helpsÂ software teams collaborate better and innovate faster than ever before.Â\n\nTraditional agileÂ project managementÂ can be categorized into two frameworks: scrum and kanban.Â While scrum is focused on fixed-length project iterations, kanban is focused on continuous releases. Upon completion, the team immediately moves on to the next.Â\n\nAgile project management framework 1: Scrum\n\nScrum is a framework for agile project management that usesÂ fixed-length iterations of work, called sprints. There are fourÂ ceremoniesÂ that bring structure to each sprint.\n\nIt all starts with theÂ backlog, or body of work that needs to be done. In scrum, there are two backlogs: one is the product backlog (owned by the product owner) which is a prioritized list of features, and the other is the sprint backlog which is filled by taking issues from the top of the product backlog until the capacity for the next sprint is reached. Scrum teams have unique roles specific to their stake in the process. Typically there's a scrum master, or champion of the scrum method for the team; the product owner, who's the voice of the product; and the scrum team, who are often cross-functional team members in charge of getting s@#$ done.\n\nThe four ceremonies of scrum\n\nAgile project management framework 2: Kanban\n\nKanbanÂ is a framework for agile project management that matches the work to the team's capacity.Â It's focused on getting things done as fast as possible, giving teams the ability to react to change even faster than scrum.\n\nUnlike scrum, kanban has no backlogs (usually). Instead, work sits in theÂ To DoÂ column. This enables kanban teams to focus on continuous releases, which can be done at any time. All work is visible, scoped, and ready to execute on so that when something is completed, the team immediately moves on to the next. The amount of work is matched to the team's capacity throughÂ WIP limits, which is a predefined limit of work that can be in a single column at one time (except theÂ To DoÂ column). The kanban framework includes the following four components:\n\nThe four components of kanban"
