        "text": "Agile is not a methodology, much less a project management methodology. Organisational agility is all about having a organisation that is responsive to change with empowered teams. The Agile Manifesto for Software Development is a set of ideas about how to do software development work, and various frameworks and management approaches have been devised that use some of those ideas. Examples: Scrum, SAFe, Scrumban, XP.\n\nThe waterfall \"model\" is not really a methodology either but it is a loose term used for any software development approach that emphasises predictive planning with a phased, sequential programme of work. There are various frameworks and methods that support some of those characteristics but those same frameworks and methods are not necessarily incompatible with working in an agile way. Examples: PRINCE2, V-Model and RAD.\n\nSad to say, but too many places are still using the \"walk around and guess\" methodology.\n\nThe main component is a deadline - decided upon by management, usually - and a hi-level concept of what needs to be done.\n\nIt consists of mainly guessing, bluffing your way and having random long-winded meetings that never create action items and have no follow up."
