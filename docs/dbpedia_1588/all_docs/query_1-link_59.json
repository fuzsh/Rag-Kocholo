        "text": "Kanban is a framework that falls under the Agile methodology. It was developed in the late 1940s by a Japanese engineer named Taiichi Ohno. Agile Kanban Framework focuses on visualizing the entire project on boards in order to increase project transparency and collaboration between team members.\n\nKanban is one of the simplest frameworks used as it allows project managers to efficiently manage and keep track of their projects. A distinguishing feature of the Kanban framework among different agile methodologies is its compatibility with the existing organizational setting.\n\nUnlike other popular frameworks, Kanban believes in introducing very small but meaningful changes in the existing setup. This is liked by more traditional organizations where hierarchy and roles of functional managers are considered important.\n\nWhat is Kanban Methodology?\n\nKanban methodology is an agile method that aims at continuous improvement, flexibility in task management, and enhanced workflow. With this illustrative approach, the progress of the whole project can be easily understood in a glance.\n\nKanban was used in manufacturing settings to control inventory throughout the supply chain, using a practice called just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing. In project management, the Kanban methodology adapts the same concept by ensuring that the amount of required work is the same as the work capabilities of the team.\n\nHow does Kanban work?\n\nKanban method revolves around the kanban board. It is a tool that visualizes the entire project to track the flow of their project. Through this graphical approach of Kanban boards, a new member or an external entity can understand what’s happening right now, tasks completed and future tasks.\n\nKanban board indicates\n\nthe current tasks that are being performed\n\nthe tasks to do in the future\n\nthe tasks that are completed\n\nThe divided columns are interconnected and tasks are gradually pulled from the leftmost column (future tasks) to the rightmost column (completed tasks). Kanban system measures the work cycle being completed through the principle of Work in Progress (WIP). WIP has certain limits and a pre-defined specific status.\n\nLimiting WIP in order to maintain consistent standards is one of the core principles that govern the Kanban methodology in Agile. It is extremely important for the team to complete the current tasks in the prescribed order.\n\nKanban is a pull system\n\nA pull system is a Lean technique that controls the flow of work by replacing what’s completed. A vending machine is a perfect example of a pull system–products will be restocked only when existing products have run out. Kanban precisely fits this definition.\n\nKanban is about work states unlike Scrum or Agile which focus on sprints and iterations. Kanban focuses on breaking down work into small tasks, visualizing them, and getting few items in any given work state. In the Kanban board, work always moves from left to right. And, you pick work from the column to your left when you have completed all your existing work items or when an urgent task surfaces. The work-in-progress limits help you enforce this.\n\nWhen should you use Kanban?\n\nThe versatility of Kanban lies in its simplicity. It fits into your current workflows and respects the existing roles and responsibilities. It can be used irrespective of the industry. A content editor could use it as well as an e-Commerce business.\n\nKanban can be used in any knowledge work setting and is particularly applicable in situations where work arrives in an unpredictable fashion and/or when you want to deploy work as soon as it is ready, rather than waiting for other work items.\n\nIf your priorities change on the fly, and ad hoc tasks can happen anytime, Kanban is best suited as you can add tasks to any work stage. It can also be used when there are no iterations.\n\nCore principles of kanban methodology\n\nKanban methodology stands on principles and practices. The core principles of Kanban method are as follows:\n\n1. Initiate with the existing workflow:\n\nKanban framework emphasizes on making small and gradual changes. Therefore, the team must start with the existing workflow and continuously improve the process.\n\n2. Limit the existing tasks:\n\nIt is important for the team to realize its own limits and cap the WIP accordingly. Taking on more than you can handle will only waste time and negatively affect the project.\n\n3. Respect existing roles and responsibilities:\n\nAn important reason for Kanban’s success is that it does not require organizations to completely overhaul the existing work culture. Many organizations resist modern methodologies because they don’t feel comfortable with change.\n\nWith Kanban, efficiency is improved while staying in the confines of the existing setup.\n\n4. Encourage leadership at all levels:\n\nProject management methodologies such as the traditional method require approval from the project manager for even the smallest tasks. Kanban gives the freedom of making decisions to the individual working on the task. This grooms future leaders who continuously learn from their mistakes and improve their work.\n\nCore practices of Kanban methodology\n\nAdditionally, using the above-mentioned core principles, the following practices have been established by organizations that use the Kanban methodology.\n\n1. Visualization of workflow:\n\nThe whole concept of Kanban revolves around proper visualization of the entire project. Kanban board software is used throughout the industry for this purpose. In the past, people used to get a whiteboard on wheels and use it with the help of different columns and Kanban cards.\n\nThis method has now become obsolete as advanced project management tools are now readily available in the market that can make your life much simpler.\n\n2. Reduction of WIP:\n\nWIP in the case of Kanban is supposed to be according to the capability of the team. Usually, a cap is applied to WIP in order to ensure maximum efficiency. On the Kanban board, a limit is applied to the number of tasks that can be performed at once.\n\nNo new task can be pulled as long as the limit is achieved, this ensures that the whole team works together and completes all related tasks around the same time.\n\n3. Efficient workflow management:\n\nMeasuring lead time and cycle time where lead time, the complete time spent on completing a task is an important parameter that project teams must reduce as much as possible.\n\n4. Explicit management policies:\n\nIt is important for the project team to know what they are trying to achieve. The reason behind is quite simple, when someone has a clear project goal in front of them, they’ll try harder to achieve it.\n\n5. Take feedback:\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important entity for any business is the client and implementing an effective feedback system is extremely important.\n\nOn the Kanban boards, a column can be assigned for feedback from either an external evaluator or the customers themselves. In this way, the quality of the delivered work can be constantly maintained.\n\nKanban vs Scrum: What’s the Difference?\n\nScrum and Kanban together are considered the cornerstones of the Agile implementation methodology. According to the ‘Pulse of Profession 2019’ report by PMI, over 57% of organizations used different Agile methodologies and the largest chunk belongs to Scrum and Kanban.\n\nBoth Kanban and Scrum focus on consistently delivering the product and keep iterating until perfection is achieved, however, their approach is different. Kanban and Scrum frameworks implement values and principles of Agile manifesto, the way they do that is entirely different.\n\nScrum revolves around a fixed-length ‘sprint’, and work is completed in small batches. In contrast to that, Kanban focuses on the continuous improvement process and tasks are performed in an orderly manner.\n\nSimilarly, changes can be easily made anytime in Kanban as it is task-based while Scrum requires the completion of a single sprint plan before any changes can be made. This makes Kanban a suitable option for projects that are extremely versatile while Scrum is better for projects that require work to be completed in batches.\n\nKanban also does not have any prescribed roles and no individual is responsible for the team or a task. Scrum, on the other hand, has pre-defined roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Team members.\n\nBenefits of Using Kanban Framework\n\nThe main selling point of the Kanban framework is the fact that it significantly improves the way you can handle your projects without changing the organizational structure.\n\nSome of the benefits Kanban methodology offers are:\n\nEnhanced flexibility\n\nContinuous improvement\n\nIncreased collaboration\n\nEmployee empowerment\n\nSmoother workflow\n\nBetter inventory management\n\nImproved quality control\n\nImplementing Kanban using Kissflow Project\n\nIf you find yourself in a position where you are responsible for handling an important project for your organization, don’t worry.
