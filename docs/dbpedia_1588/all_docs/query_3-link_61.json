        "text": "There is a good wikipedia article with a lot of resources. Also searching for \"UCM Workflows\" on IBM Rational web would lead to good examples, I'd rather not deep link into their page. The question is how far into detail you want to go into the process. Most resources available will only give you a rough overview of basic development processes.\n\nWhat you mean by examples is probably going into the details of specific implementation of such development process. For larger and established software development companies their development process will most likely not be readily reusable, because it will involve many custom made tools and configurations and the process itself could be in some cases considered proprietary, giving the company a competitive edge over others. Going into details about the process could also pose a security risk, because it would reveal a lot about the company infrastructure. So I don't think you would find much in form of examples from successful software development companies and what you find is either too general or written by theory-crafters.\n\nThis is a field of special interest for me for almost a decade now and I only ever found bits and pieces published about specific processes used by major software corporations. I would certainly welcome a forum to share experience with other professionals in this field.\n\nThere are merits in providing some sample templates which would assist someone getting started. The limitation is that it could force the user to adopt the templates without thinking about the application.\n\nMost methodologies adopt a 'guideline' approach with some tailoring. For example, the RUP system, promoted by Rational (now IBM) traditionally suffered from the assumption that it was only applicable to large scale projects. This prompted discussion on how RUP can be applied to a one person project. Of course it takes work and effort and if you are a small project team sometimes tailoring the methodology could overshadow the project; i.e are you trying to build a methodology or a product ?\n\nAs for samples some examples are:\n\nAgile Unified Process - gives good examples of both process, artifacts and also commentary on the process and it's application,\n\nOpen Unified Process - again samples, artifacts and easily navigated system.\n\nI do not know of such a \"process repository\". I only see general description like this one.\n\nNote: While the CMMI implementations I have come across are quite tailored for a specific enterprise/environment, I found them truly effective when evaluated/challenged.\n\nIn that regard, the study Six Sigma and CMMI interesting, not so much as a practical example of CMM, but rather as a way to put CMM in perspective."
