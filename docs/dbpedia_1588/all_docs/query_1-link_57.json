        "text": "Agile development and testing work hand in hand to streamline the development pipeline, ensuring efficient and punctual software releases. In agile development, projects are segmented into sprints. Similarly, in agile testing, larger feature developments are subdivided into smaller, manageable sprint-based projects and deliverables.\n\nWhat are the principles of agile testing?\n\nWhen testing within an agile framework, several principles guide the process:\n\nStart testing early\n\nTraditionally, software bugs in later development stages are deeply entwined with the backend—a legacy issue from the waterfall development cycle where testing occurred only after completing all development.\n\nAt this stage, bugs are infinitely harder to find and debug, so mitigate this by involving your testing team right from the brainstorming and planning phases. Agile software testing should seamlessly integrate and take place throughout the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).\n\nThat means that any time devs build and push any new or revised code, it should be tested. It should be impossible to integrate any new code into the project’s master Git without putting it through multiple tests.\n\nDeliver frequently\n\nIn agile testing, a sprint cycle’s duration varies depending on project requirements or team preferences, typically spanning a few weeks (each sprint within a project is the same duration).\n\nRegardless of cycle duration, testers should prepare test reports at the end of each sprint.\n\nEmbrace automation\n\nAutomation is integral to agile testing’s success. Running tests in every sprint while adhering to release deadlines is impractical without robust automation tools. While manual testing remains essential, an effective test automation strategy, employing concepts like Mike Cohn’s test automation pyramid, ensures efficiency without compromising quality.\n\nConsistent collaboration\n\nSustaining agile development hinges on unified collaboration among teams, facilitated by appropriate tools, training, and a supportive work culture. Daily stand-ups, weekly stakeholder meetings, and instant communication tools foster teamwork. Emphasize a whole team approach where every member—be it a developer, tester, or business analyst—shares responsibility for software quality, ensuring high-quality deliverables.\n\nInvolve customers\n\nIncorporating potential customers into agile testing is pivotal. As end-users, they offer invaluable insights into real-world software usability. Engage with them consistently and throughout the testing phase by using online platforms and invite them to participate in planning, review, and retrospective meetings. Encourage open communication, inviting feedback on showcased software after each sprint for iterative improvements.\n\nPrioritize quality and adaptability\n\nEvery team member in agile projects should prioritize quality throughout each stage. Adapting to modern user expectations demands a flexible mindset that is open to sudden shifts in software or customer requirements. This flexibility extends to the entire team, requiring collective readiness to address changes collaboratively and efficiently.\n\nThe agile testing life cycle\n\nBear in mind that these stages are iteratively run. Each sprint sees the team run through all these stages, and then they begin from Stage 1 again for the next sprint.\n\nImpact assessment\n\nTesters analyze user stories and get stakeholder insights to ensure the team is aligned on the requirements. Once this is done, testers can split user stories into individual, manageable tasks.\n\nTest planning\n\nStakeholders collaborate to create the test schedules, test plans, execution process, and expected results.\n\nAn agile test plan outlines the test approach, objectives, and scope. Plans must be flexible so that the team can adapt to changes in requirements. The plan must also include test automation and its specific applications in this project.\n\nWithin this stage, there are two important steps:\n\nTest design\n\nThe team builds test cases and scripts and designs tests based on requirements and data. They have to work with developers to understand how the application code works and what it’s expected to do.\n\nTest development\n\nTesters create and run manual and automated tests. Certain agile tests, such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), can be designed to run before the actual code is developed. Other tests, such as exploratory testing or session-based testing, follow the code developed during each sprint.\n\nDaily scrum\n\nEach day of the sprint, the whole team gets together for a short sync to discuss upcoming tasks, progress, and conflicts or confusion.\n\nRelease readiness\n\nIs the software ready for release? At this stage, tests are run, the results are reviewed, and bugs are removed. Oftentimes, software at this stage is sent back to previous development/testing phases because the software is not quite ready to ship.\n\nDeployment and monitoring\n\nOnce the software meets all acceptance criteria, it gets released to production. Depending on the team and company, deployment can be automated or need final human verification before release.\n\nTestable acceptance criteria: What is the definition of “ready/done” in agile testing?\n\nHow do you know if a feature has passed a test and is ready to go on to the next stage of development? How do you know if the software under development is actually good enough to be released to public users?\n\nYou use your acceptance criteria.\n\nAcceptance criteria serve as the defining conditions determining a software application’s readiness to progress through the SDLC stages. Particularly in the final SDLC phase, these criteria establish whether an application is ready for public release.\n\nThey outline the specific functionalities that the software must exhibit to gain acceptance from customers or even third-party systems. These criteria are unique to each software development project, typically derived from user stories, and depict desired behavior from the end-user’s perspective.\n\nFor instance, consider a scenario where, as a QA Lead, you and your team are tasked with testing a feature enabling users to search for products using ‘Categories’ in an online bookstore.\n\nAlthough developers have created a search bar allowing users to select ‘Categories’ and input keywords, it doesn’t align with the requirements documentation. The document stipulated that users should be able to view all categories before searching within them. In this case, users can choose a ‘Category’ but must search via a single keyword, unable to view all available ‘Categories.’\n\nDespite the functionality working, it fails to meet the requirements and the user story derived from them. Consequently, it falls short of meeting the acceptance criteria.\n\nIn this context, the acceptance criteria dictate that “users should access ‘Categories,’ view them in a single interface, and then perform searches.” As this expectation isn’t met, despite the ability to search ‘Categories,’ the acceptance criteria are not met.\n\nContinuous delivery and continuous deployment in agile testing\n\nAgile testing goes hand in hand with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).\n\nIn Continuous Delivery, code changes get thoroughly tested before they’re ready for release. But the actual release needs human approval—someone with the right access to release the code into production.\n\nContinuous Deployment does pretty much the same thing, except it skips the human part. The whole process is automated, meaning code verified by all tests in the CI/CD pipeline is automatically released to production.\n\nHow to create an agile testing strategy\n\nThe Agile Testing Quadrants can help your team choose a testing type depending on the context of project deliverables and resources. There are no strict rules about what belongs in each quadrant during release, theme, and iteration planning. Consider this a larger framework to start your agile test planning.\n\nQuadrant 1: This quadrant includes unit and component tests. These tests check that the code build is accurate and ensure integration with the existing codebase.\n\nQuadrant 2: This quadrant includes tests to check customer-facing and business-driven qualities. They are meant to help agile teams secure better results within business and customer value contexts.\n\nQuadrant 3: At this quadrant, tests don’t just verify code quality but also check the quality of user experience. Generally, these tests are manually performed by seasoned QA professionals. Tests at this level need human qualities like intuition, visual thinking, subjective analysis, and understanding of customer values.\n\nQuadrant 4: This quadrant entails running non-functional tests to check levels of security, performance, and user acceptance. This is where you check for software stability, data privacy, and overall security.\n\nImage: The Agile Testing Quadrants were developed by Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin, based on Brian Marick’s ‘Marick Test Matrix’\n\nYou can use the quadrants by following these three steps:\n\nDetermine if the work being produced is more business-facing or technology-facing\n\nDetermine if the testing is meant to guide development or critique the product based on the stage you are at in your development cycle or sprint\n\nThe quadrant you land in guides what type(s) of testing you should perform that sprint\n\nAn example of a scenario using the agile testing quadrants: Mobile banking app development\n\nQuadrant 1: Technology-Facing Tests (Supporting the Team)\n\nType of tests: Unit Tests\n\nPurpose: Ensure the functionality of individual code components.\n\nScenario: The development team is working on a new feature for a mobile banking app—an account balance update in real-time. Developers write unit tests to validate the accuracy of balance calculation methods, ensuring that deposits, withdrawals, and interest calculations are handled correctly. These tests are automated to run when new code is pushed, guaranteeing the integrity of the core functionalities.\n\nQuadrant 3: Business-Facing Tests (Supporting the Customer)\n\nType of tests: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)\n\nPurpose: Verify the system aligns with business requirements and user expectations.\n\nScenario: Before the app’s new feature launch, the product owner collaborates with end-users (bank customers) to conduct user acceptance testing. A group of selected customers uses a test version of the app, checking the balance updates in real-time. They validate the accuracy of the displayed balance against their transactions, ensuring it reflects the correct amounts and updates promptly. Feedback from UAT is collected to refine the feature before its official release.\n\nBy combining Quadrant 1’s unit tests with Quadrant 3’s user acceptance testing, the team ensures a robust technical foundation while also validating the feature’s usability and alignment with customer needs. This dual approach confirms the balance calculation’s accuracy and validates its real-world usability, enhancing the app’s overall quality.\n\nThe components of an agile testing strategy\n\nUnlike waterfall testing and test planning with all its documentation, agile testing focuses on delivery and an agile test strategy must focus on flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach, but here are a few essential elements in the mix:\n\nDocumentation in agile testing\n\nThe key to documentation in agile testing is striking the right balance of providing sufficient documentation to serve its purpose without overdoing it or leaving out essential details. An agile test plan’s content and structure will differ depending on the context in which it is used. Since the agile testing methodology is iterative, QAs must create and update a test plan for every new feature and sprint.\n\nHere is an example of a one-page, agile test plan template:\n\nThe intention of an agile test plan is to minimize extraneous information and capture the necessary information that your stakeholders and testers need to execute the plan.\n\nImage: A test management platform like TestRail can make it faster and easier to record, store, and reuse test documentation.\n\nPlanning sprints\n\nIn agile development, planning your team’s work within time-boxed sprints is essential. Time-boxed sprints create a rhythm for the team, ensuring consistent progress, adaptability, and a structured framework for iterative development while fostering a collaborative and responsive environment. Basically, it allows agile testing to keep up with agile development.\n\nSprint planning should take into account:\n\nTest objectives based on user stories\n\nScope and timeline of tests\n\nTest types, techniques, methods, data, and environments\n\nTest automation in agile testing\n\nTest automation is essential to agile testing—without it, agile testing teams would find it nearly impossible to keep up with the speed of agile development. Automation plays a key role by:\n\nCompleting and speeding up static regression testing\n\nEnsuring quicker feedback on code changes\n\nSupporting continuous integration and delivery\n\nReducing strain on human testing resources\n\nHelping to execute tests more efficiently\n\nFreeing up time for testers to focus on more complex scenarios or riskier areas of your application without sacrificing test coverage\n\nWhich tests should you automate first?\n\nEffective and scalable agile testing relies on automation, and it’s important to approach automation strategically. The first and most important task is deciding which tests to automate. Here are some questions to help you prioritize what you should automate next:\n\nIs the test going to be repeated?\n\nIs it a high-priority test or a high-priority feature?\n\nDo you need to run the test with multiple datasets or paths?\n\nIs it a regression or a smoke test?\n\nCan you automate this with your existing tech stack?\n\nIs the area of your app that this is testing prone to change?\n\nIs it a random negative test?\n\nCan these tests be executed in parallel or only in sequential order?\n\nHow expensive/complicated is the architecture required for this test?\n\nUnsure what tests or test suites to automate? Download our interactive automation scoring model to help you prioritize what to automate next and guide your test automation strategy.\n\nWhen should you automate tests during sprints?\n\nThere are two approaches to deciding when to automate tests during sprints:\n\nExecuting development and test automation tasks concurrently in a sprint.\n\nAlternating efforts: automating features in a subsequent sprint after their development in the current sprint.\n\nBoth approaches have their own advantages and considerations. The concurrent approach ensures that tests are ready when the feature is developed, facilitating quick feedback and bug identification. On the other hand, the alternating approach might allow the development team to work without distractions on new features but could potentially delay the availability of automated tests for those features.\n\nThe choice between these approaches often depends on various factors such as team dynamics, project timelines, the complexity of features, the skill sets within the team, and the project’s specific requirements. Agile teams might adopt one or the other or even a combination of both approaches depending on the context of the project.\n\nManaging risks\n\nHigh-speed software delivery within concise timelines requires QAs to prioritize certain tests over others, increasing potential risks. Tests with a higher potential for risks will need more attention, time, and effort from your QA team. Additionally, certain tests are more essential for specific features, which factor into priority levels when sprint planning.\n\nCheck out this video on What Agile Testing is NOT to clear up some common misconceptions about agile testing and get a practical understanding of how to apply agile testing within your team’s existing workflows.\n\nHow to manage agile testing with a test case management tool\n\nImage: Orchestrate your agile quality assurance process easily in one centralized platform.

Continuous testing\n\nContinuous testing is a very specific process within the agile SDLC that essentially sets up automated tests within a CI/CD pipeline. Every time new code is pushed by a dev, it must go through a series of automated tests to be accepted into the software’s larger codebase.\n\nContinuous testing has been a wildly successful technique, with noted success in reducing business risk and technical anomalies.\n\nContinuous testing requires collaboration between individuals, teams, systems, and services. These sets of tests stand as guardrails against bugs passing into the application, especially as it grows in size and features.\n\nShift-left testing Vs. Shift-right testing\n\nFirst, think of the software development lifecycle as a straight line. The steps in the SDLC start from the left and move towards the right.\n\nShift Left Testing\n\nShift Left Testing involves moving testing to the “left” of the SDLC line. In other words, testing starts earlier in the pipeline.\n\nTeams plan, build, and test software as early as possible. Testers are involved in brainstorming conversations to understand the requirements. Then, they start designing tests simultaneously with developers coding said features. Tests are created even before or along with actual coding.\n\nThe big advantage here is that teams can predict changes that show up during development. Consequently, they can course correct tests immediately, without waiting for all the code to be written first.\n\nShift left testing prioritizes verifying APIs, container configurations, and interactions between microservices. It has become increasingly popular because of its high efficacy levels.\n\nShift right testing\n\nShift right testing, on the other hand, involves testing software for quality & performance in real-world conditions.\n\nGenerally, “real-world conditions” refer to testing in production environments of some kind. The ideal practice is to test the software on real browsers and devices. If the software works well on an actual smartphone, for example, it’ll probably do well after release.\n\nWhen tests shift to the “right” of the SDLC, the priority is to test if the software can deal with real user traffic without messing with quality. Can the app serve 1000 users as well as it does for 100 users?\n\nShift right testing prioritizes performance, reliability, and resilience. It focuses on finding bugs, runtime issues, and anomalies that would usually not show up during development.\n\nThe test pyramid model\n\nThe test pyramid simplifies the scheme for agile testing by creating a visual metaphor for the different layers of testing. The test pyramid also helps QAs decide how much testing needs to be accomplished on each level.\n\nThe test pyramid is generally comprised of three layers:\n\nUnit Tests — at the bottom\n\nService Tests — in the middle\n\nUser Interface (UI) Tests — at the top\n\nWhile the traditional three-layer test pyramid might seem overly simplistic for modern SDLCs, the foundational concept of layering tests remains effective. Remember these actionable tips while designing tests using the pyramid:"
