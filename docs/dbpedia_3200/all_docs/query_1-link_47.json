Liden Films and Frontierworks will be handling production of the upcoming series. There is currently no scheduled release date for the series as of yet. More updates are expected to arrive through the official Twitter account. [Thanks, Dengeki Online!]\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nHowever, a short trailer did accompany the announcement of the upcoming series. This featured several key scenes from Saiyuki Reload, which will be present in Saiyuki Reload Zeroin.\n\nIn addition, all of the original voice actors from the previous production will reprise their roles. Liden Films, the studio that will animate the upcoming series, worked on other anime series such as Cells at Work! Code Black and an adaptation of The Heroic Legend of Arslan.\n\nThe Saiyuki manga first made its debut in February 1997 and ran until January 2002, with a total of over twenty-five million volumes sold. Saiyuki Reload originally ran from March 2002 to June 2009. Since its original release, the series has spawned several anime adaptations and even an animated film. The series follows the exploits of Genjyo Sanzo, an irate monk, the monkey king Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai as they attempt to stop the resurrection of the Ox Demon King. Saiyuki Reload Zeroin is in development."
