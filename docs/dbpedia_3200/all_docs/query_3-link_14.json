As someone who decided to watch this even without checking out the previous seasons beforehand, I thought the anime was good overall.\n\nI thought the story was simple enough so that even a newcomer wouldn't feel too lost. I also appreciate the fact that some episodes were set aside to animate some parts from earlier on in the series which gave some backstory to the main characters. The art was very good and the animation was good although the way the show ... went about using it's animation style made me feel like if maybe there was a limited budget available and they had to find ways to be clever with how they animated the fight scenes. The characters are very likable even though personally I don't have much of an attachment to them. Most of negative experience from watching Saiyuuki Reload Blast comes from the fact that trying to get through the episodes sometimes felt like a chore. This isn't really too much a fault of the show and I'd want to blame it on me being a newcomer. Even if I were to take away that fact, it would not have been enough to bump up the score too much higher than what it already is.\n\nI'll conclude by saying that watching Saiyuuki Reload Blast was a nice experience as a newcomer and I'd recommend it to other newcomers as well. Maybe if you really enjoyed it, consider giving the manga or the older anime seasons a chance.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nAs a long time Saiyuki fan, of course my review is going to be pretty biased but I thought I should at least put some good words into this latest season, especially since it’s been well over a decade since we last got to see our boys in fully animated action.\n\nThis anime was such a treat for me! The first two episodes had a pretty good start with the guys just being badass but super goofy at the same time. The punchline was pretty good and I was laughing all the way. Then, the upcoming episodes shifted into a more serious tone where we ... have the lore of our four main characters. I personally find this is a good attempt of a recap for newcomers to know more about the guys but still, I highly recommend you to watch the very first season. It spans about 50 episodes but I assure you, it will flew by quickly and by the time you’re finished with it, you’ll have a pretty good grasp on the charm of this series and its amazing characters.\n\nUnfortunately, this latest season covers only one arc as there are not enough material from the manga that they can use due to its inconsistent releases because of the author’s health. Look it up on Google. She seriously went through a lot! At one point, I almost thought that she was gonna abandon the series because she wasn’t able to use her hand at one point.\n\nBUT she managed to get back up and started drawing again and you can feel the same fighting spirits resonate with the characters as well. It’s quite inspiring!\n\nAnimation wise, you can tell that there’s some constraints as they had to use a lot of shaky camera movements during the fight scenes but it was still pretty decent and doesn’t affect the flow at all. The blood splattering on the screen was quite a nice touch too.\n\nArt is pretty good and mostly consistent considering how intricate Minekura-sensei’s line is. I think the designer did a pretty good job keeping it as close as possible to the manga work. I noticed that they used a lot of orange and brown hue in most scenes which gives out a rustic feel that definitely fit the vibe of the characters and the overall premise.\n\nSound-wise, nothing worth noting other than the OP and the ED that are definitely meant for this series. Anything sung by GRANRODEO are definitely hype-worthy and it does a pretty good job to make the viewer excited. The ED was surprisingly good as well. The rock vibe and the slightly rough but clear tone from the vocal was nice to listen to after every episode ends. The VAs for the four MCs are amazing as always and really brings the character to life. Their monologues especially will immediately put you in their shoes and successfully build the empathy for the characters.\n\nThe characters are the biggest drawer of the series. I love how each character has their eccentric traits that are polar opposites of each other and yet their friendship and chemistry still remains tight. Surprisingly, this season also features a well-rounded side characters who actually play a bigger role in the overall arc instead of just being the igniter for the plot to move.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Saiyuki Reload Blast. As a fan, it had things that I’ve been missing out from a long time ago. Characters that you can laugh and empathize with, backstory that will bring tears to your eyes, OP and ED you can sing along and fanservice that you can enjoy. While it may not gain the popularity of how the current generation of anime fans work right now, it certainly holds a special place to its fan.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\n[Spoiler Warning]\n\nI kinda feel bad that only a few enjoys this 3rd...or 4th sequel of Saiyuki, is it because there is no fanservice around? Is it because, there is no school uniform girls or young girls around? Is it because, there is no romance around????IMAO, I guess people just don't know when there is a good anime around, and since there is a saying among them rednecks in the south that anything taste better when fried, here anything looks good if there were young girls involves, and Sharak in a bikini just wouldn't cut it, tsk, tsk,tsk, tsk.....\n\nStory, Good 7.\n\nIt maybe the continuation of the ... Sanzo party to stop some sort of experiment, but then again , it was actually good that such sequel did happen. ok so there were some episode where there is a rerun of an OVA \"Saiyuki Gaiden\" you can't deny as how such rerun inclusion have added something to this sequel.\n\nArt. Mediocre 5.\n\nOk, so the art was simply where the party continues from where \"Saiyuki Reload\" ended.\n\nSound, Good 7.\n\nOk, so it was the same male seiyu's who did the cast of Sanzo Party, and yes they're on the mature side, what do you expect? The score was for the opening theme.\n\nCharacter, good 7.\n\nOk so it's the same Sanzo Genjo who smokes like a chimmy and drinks like a well, and has the patience's of a water heater that can blow up anytime, and shoot anybody who he sees like Gouyjo, Hakkai Cho who is the party's peace maker and mediator , Gouyjo Sha who is always the palyer , the party asshole and Sanzo's live target practice and Goku, who serves as the party's go to yokai for Sanzo and Gouyjo to take a swipe on........well regardless of it their petty quarrel often have a comedic purpose, but there were some development when Kougayjin dies in the hands of Nataku and that's one main villain out, so it's all good.\n\nEnjoyment, Good 7.\n\nWhen I last watch the last episode of Saiyuki Reload, I waskinda hoping for another sequel , and it did came....thought it took a little longer, but anyways it's over so..........\n\nOverall, Very Good 8.\n\nIt deserves another sequel, and **********, pardon my French, those who doesn't see this as good, cu'z there is no hot young girls in school uniform in it..........\n\nBANG!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nOne of my random picked up watch.\n\nAre you interested in chinese folk stories ? If yes it's the best choice to try this one.\n\nReload Blast is 3rd installment of the Saiyuuki series, even i got to know after finishing the show.\n\nIt's modified 'Journey to the west' story with Japanese names. As most people popularly know it as story of a monk's journey from China to India while getting accompany by few others.\n\nMost great part of the anime is it's art style animation, plot was fair and character were more of STILL with not character development.\n\nଚୀନ୍ ର ପୌରାଣିକ କଥା ଉପରେ ଆଧାରିତ ଏଇ କାହାଣୀ ।\n\nଚିତ୍ରପଟ ... ର ମୁଖ୍ୟ ବିଷୟ, ସତ୍ୟ ଘଟଣା ଉପରେ ଆଧାରିତ କାଳ୍ପନିକ ଗାଥା 'ପଶ୍ଚିମଭୂମି କୁ ଯାତ୍ରା' ଉପରେ ନିବେଶ କରାଯାଇଛି ।\n\nମୁଖ୍ୟ ଚରିତ୍ର ହେଲେ ୪ ଜଣ, ତାଙ୍କ ମଧ୍ୟରେ ସନ୍ୟାସୀ ହେଲା ଯାତ୍ରାପଥର ନିର୍ଣ୍ଣୟକର୍ତା ।\n\nଏହି ମାନରଞ୍ଜନ ମାଧ୍ୟମ ଟି ହେଲା ଭାଗର ତୃତୀୟ ଖଣ୍ଡ। ଆପଣ ଏଥିରୁ ଆରମ୍ଭ କଲେ ଭି, କାହାଣୀ ର ଗତିପଥ ଜାଣିପାରିବେ ।\n\nମତେ ସବୁଠୁ ଭଲ ଲାଗିଲା, ଏହାର ଚିତ୍ରାଙ୍କନ କିନ୍ତୁ ଚରିତ୍ର ଗୁଡିକର କଣସି ଦିଗରେ ଉତ୍ତୀର୍ଣ୍ଣ ହେଇପାରିଲାଣି ।\n\nଦେଖୁଛି, ସଂସ୍ଥା ମତେ କହୁଛି ଆହୁରି ଟିକେ ଲେଖିବାକୁ, କିନ୍ତୁ ମୁଁ ଯଦି ଲେଖିବା ଉପରେ ଆସିଯିବି, ପୁରା କାହାଣୀ ବର୍ଣନା କରିଦେବି, କିନ୍ତୁ ତାହା ଏହି ସଂସ୍ଥା ର ନିୟମ ଖଣ୍ଡନ କରେ । ଶେଷ ଥର ସେମିତି କରିଥିଲି, ସେମାନେ ମୋ ଅନୁଛେଦ କାଟିଦେଲେ ।\n\nभाई में और कितना लिखूं इस्पे अनुछेद, आखरी बार लिखा था कहानी की सम्पूर्ण घटना क्रम को बर्णना करते हुए, उन्होंने वो उड़ा दिया ।\n\nअब में चाहता हु की, में कम शब्द में कहानी की उपक्रम बताऊ तो यह भी उनको मंज़ूर नहीं ।\n\nऔर कितना लंबा लिखबाओगे ।\n\nअगर इस भाषा मे भी पेट न भरे, तो और एक भाषा मे लिखूं क्या !?\n\nᱪᱤᱞᱤ ᱦᱚᱲ ᱠᱚ ᱯᱮ ᱠᱟᱢᱤ ᱮᱫᱟ ᱱᱚᱣᱟ ᱢᱤᱰᱚᱭᱟᱢ ᱨᱮ. ᱟᱯᱮ ᱫᱚ ᱞᱟᱠᱤᱛᱤ ᱟᱨ ᱵᱟᱝ ᱞᱟᱹᱠᱛᱤ ᱢᱤᱫ ᱜᱤᱭᱟ. ᱟᱨ ᱛᱤᱱᱟᱹᱜ ᱤᱧ ᱚᱞᱚᱶᱚ.\n\nH\n\nO\n\nW\n\nL\n\nO\n\nN\n\nG\n\nD\n\nO\n\nI\n\nH\n\nA\n\nV\n\nE\n\nT\n\nO\n\nW\n\nR\n\nI\n\nT\n\nE\n\nT\n\nH\n\nE\n\nR\n\nE\n\nV\n\nI\n\nE\n\nW,\n\nL\n\nA\n\nS\n\nT\n\nT\n\nI\n\nM\n\nE\n\nI\n\nW\n\nR\n\nO\n\nT\n\nE\n\nW\n\nH\n\nO\n\nL\n\nE\n\nP\n\nL\n\nO\n\nT\n\nW\n\nI\n\nT\n\nH\n\nS\n\nP\n\nO\n\nI\n\nL\n\nE\n\nR,\n\nY\n\nO\n\nU\n\nM\n\nO\n\nD\n\nE\n\nR\n\nA\n\nT\n\nO\n\nR\n\nS\n\nR\n\nE\n\nM\n\nO\n\nV\n\nE\n\nD\n\nI\n\nT.\n\nKindly, do something about it.
