Please use it. . . http://forum.minitokyo.net/showthread/1073/.\n\nRemember to use the Search function so you don't make duplicate threads!\n\ns h i n s e n g u m i\n\nMinitokyo Policy, Forum, Review, and Category Maintenance Moderator Emeritus\n\nDo not expect to be applauded when you do the right thing, and do not expect to be forgiven when you err, but even your enemies will respect commitment, and a conscience at peace is worth a thousand tainted victories.\n\nWell, I wouldn't really consider this a dupe thread. *shrugs* Mods' call.\n\nI think the anime's cool - I'm just watching it now myself (borrowed the dvds from a friend). As usual, though, it leaves out a few details (such as kanan's real relationship with hakkai) though they're ultimately inconsequential. XD It's followed the manga closely so far.\n\nIf you're after a good story, go for it. :) If you're in it purely for the art though, buy the manga instead. Kazuya Minekura-sensei's art style is really unique - it sometimes shows where the anime's cel shading has fallen short of replicating her style.\n\nWell, you can take a look at the reviews.....\n\nFor me i'd say Saiyuki's a great anime. Watched it a long time ago, it's really hilarious, really recommend you should go watch it. :)\n\nhmm...I did watch it. The first season was better, the second was kind of stupid for some reason. The ending was much too corny for it's own good. I hear Saiyuki Reload is awesome...or maybe just good. I say skip the first and d/l Reload...unless DVD's are out for it already, then I say support the industry.\n\nhrm... i've got the first 2 dvds and it's pretty good so far, but i've also been reading the manga of it... and i like the manga better... but that's just personal preference. the only thing i have to warn you about are the filler episodes... they are terrible. usually filler episodes are pretty funny, but the ones for saiyuki were kinda lame.\n\nSaiyuki's one of the best anime I've ever seen, and I got the entire DVD set for the first 2 seasons, OVA and Requiem. I'm just waiting for a decent copy of Reload right now, and of course Gunlock. If you happen to like tons of humor, action and lots of angst, then this is the anime for you. (not to mention such cool bishounen) I just love that ill-behaved monk!\n\nsaiyuki for me is the best ever. its based on the legend 'jouney to the west' thats why the name saiyuki.. i know people that by seeing saiyuki found a new courage for life. it has some deep emotions and some ery nice phrases! XD its hilarious, as while as serious. i love it and love minekura sensei's works ^^. for me its worth to buy it ;).. but its a saiyuki total addict speaking.. so i might not make much sense XD hope i helped and not confused you more.. (not good in explanations and stuff... -__-) now ill shut up ^_^'\n\ncya!"
