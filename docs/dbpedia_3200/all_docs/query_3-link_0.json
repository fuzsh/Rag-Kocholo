He is ordered to assemble a team of his old companions, Son Goku , Cho Hakkai , and Sha Gojyo , all of whom are part youkai, to accompany him on his quest. Initially he feared that they might be susceptible to the plague as well, but after watching them in action, Sanzo is reminded that they are, after all, part human, and their wills are strong. His doubts dispelled, they begin their journey to the West.\n\nList of Manga Volumes and Chapters[]\n\nVolume 1[]\n\nVolume 1 Cover Japanese English Release date ISBN Release date ISBN October 1, 1997 GF\n\nOctober 26, 2002 ZS 4870255928 GF\n\n4758050074 ZS March 2, 2004 1591826519 TP Chapters:\n\nPrologue - Go to the West\n\nChapter 01 - First Game\n\nChapter 02 - Even\n\nChapter 03 - Get Square\n\nChapter 04 - His God\n\nChapter 05 - My God\n\nSummary:\n\nIt was a time of chaos, when Heaven and Earth were as one, and humans and demons - the youkai - lived together in peace.
