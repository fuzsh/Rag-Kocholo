        "text": "With the anime release of Saiyuki Reload Blast, and the rise of new fans, I’ve seen a lot of questions concerning what Saiyuki animes and OVAs came out before Saiyuki Reload Blast, and how best to watch them. Ergo, I’ve made 2 lists here, one list for the chronological order of the events in the animated series, and a second list for the viewing order in which I think it is best to watch Saiyuki.\n\nPlease keep in mind that the manga of Saiyuki is extraordinary, and well worth reading as well, if you are interested. I came across Gensomaden Saiyuki first, picked up the manga afterwards, and have never been able to put the series down since. That was in 2006.\n\nAlso, know that the animes Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock can be frustrating to watch, and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock in particular is riddled with “out of character” behavior. So, if you would like to skip Saiyuki Reload Gunlock, it will not be any great loss to you.\n\nFinally, if you are a fan of dubbing and do not care for subtitles, the dub cast for Gensomaden Saiyuki, Saiyuki Requiem, and Saiyuki Gaiden is excellent. However, Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock were both dubbed by a different set of actors, and to get a better experience, I would recommend watching those latter two shows with subtitles.\n\nChronological Order of Events in Saiyuki Animes:\n\nSaiyuki Gaiden: Tokubetsu-hen – Kouga no Shou [1 OVA]\n\nSaiyuki Gaiden [3 OVAs]\n\nSaiyuki Reload Burial [3 OVAs]\n\nGensomaden Saiyuki [50 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Premium [2 OVAs]\n\nSaiyuki: The Jade Pearl [1 OVA]\n\nSaiyuki Requiem [Movie]\n\nSaiyuki Reload [25 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Reload Gunlock [26 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast [12 Episodes]\n\nSuggested Order for Watching Saiyuki Animes:\n\nGensomaden Saiyuki [50 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Premium [2 OVAs]\n\nSaiyuki: The Jade Pearl [1 OVA]\n\nSaiyuki Requiem [Movie]\n\nSaiyuki Reload [25 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Gunlock [26 Episodes]\n\nSaiyuki Reload Burial [3 OVAs]\n\nSaiyuki Gaiden [3 OVAs]\n\nSaiyuki Gaiden: Tokubetsu-hen – Kouga no Shou [1 OVA]\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast [12 episodes]\n\nYou may notice that, in my Suggested Order list, I do not cite all the shows as they were released. Saiyuki Premium came out before Gensomaden Saiyuki. However, the reason for this order is that I believe a new viewer will have a more engaging time watching Gensomaden first, getting to know the characters there, and then going back to Premium. I also put Requiem after The Jade Pearl, even though it came out first. This is because Requiem is the more impactful and dramatic of the two, and a better sendoff to the artstyle of Gensomaden, The Jade Pearl, and Requiem."
