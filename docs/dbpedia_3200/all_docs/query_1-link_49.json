        "text": "Characters\n\nReviews\n\nOh, Saiyuki my bad babe, we've had a long and passionate relationship over the years and I still think you're one of the best.\n\nWhat can I say? Saiyuki by Minekura Kazuya was one of the first manga series I ever read and it has been my companion, inspiration and friend for a long time. Now it's time to spread the love.\n\n*This is a spoiler free review*\n\nThis is the first part of the long-running Saiyuki series and the point where you should start your reading. Originally published in a magazine aimed at boys it's a curious mix of material seemingly targeted towards catering female audience and ... the shounen-esque escalating structure of the story filled with action. If you're familiar with the old Chinese legend about The Journey to the West...this is not like it at all. The characters are based on it but their personalities, origins and motives are heavily altered to fit in this particular story. To cut to the chase, we have a bunch of anti-heroes, villains, megalomaniacs, psychopaths and knight templars and...wait, did I just describe our protagonists too? Good doesn't always have to be nice and vice versa. And who's to judge what's good or evil anyway, huh?\n\nAt this point of the story the plot is mostly about introduction to the world and characters and it's greatest function is to move our main guys to new places to kick some ass - and to give them some more reason to get snarky with each other. When we get to the sequels, Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Realod Blast, the story starts to unravel more. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. What we have in here is a straightforward road trip adventure mixing witty dialogue with action and mythology with past events heavily on the background. The episodic story arcs throw us in monster-of-the-week situations which usually trigger our main characters to have to deal with their own inner demons as well. The setting can be only described as \"schizo tech gone wild\" with it's weird and intriguing combination of magic and science.\n\nI've always loved the characterization and character dynamics in Saiyuki. There's many kind of relationships to discover, from loving to lethal to unconventional. The bickering and passive-aggressive attitudes are hilarious and there's also some of the best executed tense moments I've ever read in any manga. Both the strength and weakness of the characters lies in the fact that they stay true to themselves with their own moral codes and ideas of how to live. Saiyuki is also infamous for the angst: almost every single boy, girl, granny and their dog is in some way or another traumatized by their tragic past and we get a full set of psychological problems and other less pleasant topics do deal with. Hardships have an effect on us, be it something easily overcome or something more brutal. The past shapes you and can always be in your mind but it doesn't have to chain or define who you are right now and I love Saiyuki for showing that.\n\nMinekura's art is distinct and easily recognizable. And I adore it! I admit, the proportions are a a little off, especially at the start of the series and everybody is just so beautiful that it makes you sweat uncomfortably but I still look up to it because of it's uniqueness. Her art evolves along the way and the later parts of this first series is where I've always considered it to be at it's peak. The other thing I appreciate is the composition. Everything's in it's optimal place, the panels run smoothly and story flows as intended; dramatic and emotional moments have plenty of punch.\n\nThe greatest thing about Saiyuki is that it doesn't pretend to be anything else than it is: an action romp with badass bishounens on the wheel. You don't have to try to search anything deep from it, because the action and comedy are great, but there's also some interesting questions about self, identity and purpose of life to ponder. In this fascinating world there's great ambiguous characters to love, pretty art to enjoy and up to date best dialogue translation Tokyopop ever came up to.\n\nThis series can never get too much love. I've grown up with it and been even taught some life lessons along the way and it still feels fresh every time I start the journey again. I'd dare people to give it a chance and maybe get surprised. The story continues.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSaiyuki is an entertaining over the top adventure oozing with blood, hot guys and angst. If you're up to some action and mad one-liners I'd tell you to pack your Smith&Wesson and give it a shot.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nSaiyuki is a slow to start series. As I started, I was a little confused as to what the hell was going on, thinking that I'd missed something. Too much was happening with no proper character introductions, and no real story.\n\nThe story gets better as you go though. By the start of the second volume, I had regained my ground. I knew who the characters were and what they were doing.\n\nUnfortunately Saiyuki's story isn't up to scratch. It isn 't a bad story, it just doesn't go anywhere. By the end of it, realising that it hadn't been completed and that there was an entire ... series. Saiyuki Reload follows it. The problem is that the story wasn't enticing enough for me to even bother with the next series. I was just a little annoyed that I thought I was getting to the end of the series and in the end there was little to no plot development, with the characters basically ending up back where they were at the start.\n\nThe characters in the series are interesting but highly cliched. The second I saw them, I could guess practically everything about them. And generally, I was correct. They are see-through and unbelievable. The only redeeming parts are the stories of Hakkai and Gojyo, who have deep and interesting backstories.\n\nWhile the story and characters aren't amazing, the artwork is incredibly well done.The artstyle is a little hard to get used to, but once you have, it is the best thing about the series.\n\nOverall, the series is interesting, but not really worth your time. If you've really got nothing better to read, give it a go. It's not bad, but there are much better series out there.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nJust a shitty yaoi manga with a poor excuse of a storyline. Incest is involved too, so it appeals to a lot of people, heh. Shallow yaoi faingirls who are into the typical pretty boys, drama, scandal and incest will eat this up. The action sequences are so crap. I had no idea what they were doing. And the \"powers\" and \"abilities\" are so mediocre but the characters act like they're super awesome. For people looking for a good series, this is not for you. Turn back and stay well away from this pathetic excuse of a manga. Wish I could give it a zero ... overall. Need I really say more?\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for January\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for January Week 1: January 5 - 11 Anime Releases Black Bullet Blu-ray [2021 re-release] Conception Blu-ray [E...read more\n\nJan 5, 2021 2:08 PM by ImperfectBlue | Discuss (8 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for November\n\nHere are the North American anime & manga releases for November Week 1: November 3 - 9 Anime Releases Actors: Songs Connection Complete Collection Blu-ray Dragon...read more\n\nNov 2, 2020 6:44 PM by ImperfectBlue | Discuss (1 comment)\n\nRecent Forum Discussion\n\nPoll: Saiyuki Chapter 55 Discussion\n\nLunar191 - Oct 31, 2012 2 repliesby TitanInsane »»\n\nOct 7, 2021 2:45 AM Raws\n\npionelya - Mar 8, 2021 0 repliesby pionelya »»\n\nMar 8, 2021 11:28 PM Poll: Saiyuuki Chapter 37 Discussion\n\ntheshinsengumi - Sep 10, 2017 0 repliesby theshinsengumi »»\n\nSep 10, 2017 8:30 AM Poll: Saiyuki Chapter 3 Discussion\n\nDecadent - Apr 21, 2011 0 repliesby Decadent »»\n\nApr 21, 2011 2:41 AM Poll: Saiyuki Chapter 42 Discussion\n\nNaivette - Feb 25, 2011 0 repliesby Naivette »»\n\nFeb 25, 2011 6:55 PM\n\nRecent Featured Articles\n\nOur Picks for the 5 Best Shows (So Far) this Summer 2017 Season\n\nHave you been enjoying the anime shows this summer?
