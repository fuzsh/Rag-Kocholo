        "text": "Trigunette said:\n\nfenwick said:\n\nThanks for those recomendations. Yeah, Togari's ace! Only problem is they only released up to volume 8 in Japan with no solid ending (was supposed to be 10) so wonder what Viz will do...\n\n:cry: Whaat Togari was cut short? I lieb Togari, that sucks.\n\nIf you want gore Fenwick, have you checked out MPD Psycho?\n\nHow about Gantz, Vagabond, and I definately second The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service it's sort of... laconic gore haha, I really like it. Or if you're keen on it being a viz title how about Bastard!!\n\nIt's easy to see that Kazushi Hagiwara used to be an assistant in a hentai manga with his suggestive \"camera angles.\" A lot of people find it inferior to Berserk, but I find comparisons annoying and laugh my head off while reading.\n\nI love The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service. I find it just so funny how they set everything up to make money out of their talents, yet they always seem to end up out of pocket because once they have started something they just can't seem to bring themselves to stop.\n\nI've got vol 2 onwards of MPD Psycho sitting my draw at work waiting to be read as for some reason the vol 1 I had pre-ordered did not show up and when I tried picking it up I could not find it any where so I am having to wait for a re-stock. Pre-ordered Gantz the other day now the wait begins.\n\nDel Ray have some pretty good stuff out one I am getting is Dragon Eye.\n\nDracos said:\n\nI love The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service.

It's one of my current favorites.\n\nThat is the pits not finding volume one of MPD, I hope you find a copy soon, good ruck, it's a pain starting a new series without the beginning. Pretty engrossing and gruesome. I hope they keep it un-censored.\n\nOh you're getting Dragon Eye, how is it? I have the first three still waiting for me at the bottom of the second pile of unread manga. I read some comment somewhere that it was a poor man's Bleach. How's that hang?\n\nI'm always on the look out for something new and Del Ray are ones to watch out for. Off bat the Del Ray I have/am collecting are Mushishi, Genshiken, My Heavenly Hockey Club, ES, Parasyte, and Wallflower. Any recs?\n\nTrigunette said:\n\nYeah Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service should get a whole lotta more love is my thinking.

Any recs?\n\nJust getting to the end of Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service vol 6 things are looking bad for the guys as they really don't seem to be able to make any money and others are moving into their territory.\n\nI have pre-ordered a copy of MPD psycho vol 1 from the re-stock so just have to wait. I did not notice last time as I tend to order months ahead, when vol 2 turned up I thought whereâ€™s vol 1 and by then it was pretty much too late.\n\nI am pretty new to the Manga thing (about 2 years) even though I have been into anime for something like 18 years and western comics for 8-10 years. I tend to just pick up what I like the sound or look of, but I am starting to get a bit pickier now.\n\nI love Mushishi so different from anything else out there.\n\nI can see why some may say Dragon Eye is poor manâ€™s Bleach monster hunting and that, but I find it different enough. Though it is definitely in that shonen mould of the likes of Bleach and Naruto.\n\nIf you like general head **** try Line from ADV it is only one volume. It is about a girl that picks up a lost mobile, when it rings she answers which then starts the events that see her running around town trying to stop suicides. Alive is something else I have picked up thatâ€™s a pretty good head ****, virus going around causing people to commit suicide.\n\nFor some reason I am enjoying two titles about dolls at the moment, Rozen Maiden and Vampire Doll Guilt-Na-Zan.\n\nDracos said:\n\nJust getting to the end of Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service vol 6 things are looking bad for the guys as they really don't seem to be able to make any money and others are moving into their territory.\n\nI am pretty new to the Manga thing (about 2 years) even though I have been into anime for something like 18 years and western comics for 8-10 years.

It's by the same writer as TKCDS.\n\nTwo years ago is about the time I got into manga too. I used to read my share of comics and especially all the europeans, but then I went totally film freak and didn't read much comics for years. I know what you mean about getting picky. When I started reading manga there was so much to choose from, there still is to some extent, but at first it's like falling in love and you just can't get enough of it. So many really really good series. Still, there's a lot of rubbish and/or rather series I find myself being indifferent to. Then there's the continuous waiting for the next volumes of favorites and the series that come out so slow it feels like it takes a decade for them to pop out. Though that's where good one shots and shorties come in handy.\n\nYeah Line was not bad at all, I got it when it came out. Coincidently I'd just read an article about internet based suicide pacts in Japan prior to picking up Line, so it made reading it somewhat more driven and urgent than it maybe would've been otherwise. Hmm I'll check on Alive anyway, but it'll probably make me think of the 30 000 suicides a year in Japan, and that's a hellava lot of suicide.\n\nDolls eh I only read Dolls, which I didn't like the art of and the stories just didn't do it for me, maybe I'll give dolls another chance and check out those at some point.\n\nNow I'm reading Crying Freeman, honestly Kazuo Koike sure writes some entertainingly pulpy trash"
