        "text": "AnimeNext 2004\n\nby Margaret O'Connell\n\nI first noticed the Gravitation fan girls in the registration line on Friday, June 18th, the first day of the AnimeNext anime convention in Secaucus, New Jersey. They weren't dressed as the characters whose names they were using then  at least, there were no visual resemblances that I picked up on. But if you were at all familiar with the series, it was pretty difficult to miss the otherwise relatively ordinary-looking (in that frequently winged, kimonoed, and/or Cross Punisher-carrying crowd) young women loudly calling \"Shuichi!\" and \"Ryuichi!\" back and forth to each other across the crowded hotel lobby. Later I spotted somebody sitting in the audience at a panel with a small pink stuffed rabbit on her head  a reasonably good facsimile of childlike fictional rock star Ryuichi Sakuma's trademark plush toy Kumagoro  and figured she must be part of the same crowd.\n\nIt all seemed more or less unobtrusively amusing until about two forty-five Saturday afternoon, when a few members of the various Gravitation posses began filtering into the auditorium where the newly-released dubbed version of Gravitation was supposed to air forty-five minutes later. Apparently some of them had decided that it would be prudent to stake their claim to seats near the front in advance, during the last two scheduled episodes of Knight Hunters: Eternity, better known as Weiss Kreuz: Gluhen. Unfortunately, the female half of the couple who sat down right behind me (she was accompanied by one of the few identifiable male Gravi fans present) was evidently totally unfamiliar with Weiss Kreuz, and was inspired to giggling Mystery Science Theater-like outbursts by certain elements of the episode  more specifically, the formerly redheaded Aya's Gluhen-induced character redesign. Spotting the undercover Weiss operative's waist-length brown braid, the talkative Gravi fan (who was obviously also a Gundam Wing fan) laughingly exclaimed, \"It's Duo! Grown-up Duo! Duo with glasses!\" (These were part of Aya's disguise as a teacher at an exclusive private school which was a front for a clandestine organization's nefarious brainwashing scheme.) \"It's Duo's father!\" she went on  then, in mock Darth Vader tones: \"'Duo, I am your father!'\" (For the benefit of those who have never seen Gundam Wing, I should explain here that Duo is one of the five fifteen-year-old boy pilots of the title gundams, which are giant robotic mobile suits.) Since I'd already noticed the resemblance between Duo's distinctive hairstyle and Aya's new look myself, I actually found the first few of these comments somewhat entertaining. However, evidently other people in the vicinity were looking daggers at the source of the irreverent color commentary, because at this point the Gravi/Gundam fan's male companion shushingly muttered to her, \"I think the other people here really like Weiss Kreuz.\" After that she fell silent until the next fight scene, when she jokingly urged \"Duo\" to \"use your hair! Whip him with your braid!\" (Actually, it would probably have been more feasible for the villain to grab Aya by his yard-long braid and try to choke him with it, if the Weiss operative hadn't been slashing him with a samurai sword at the time. But I digress.)\n\nOnce the Weiss Kreuz episodes had concluded, an additional horde of Gravitation fans poured into the room. The members of the character-codenamed group I'd noticed the day before plunked themselves down in the row in front of me, and I found myself staring at the back of the purple-wigged head of someone who was obviously supposed to be Noriko, the keyboardist of Nittle Grasper, the second most important band featured in the series. Sitting next to her was Hiro, identifiable by her longish red-streaked (actual) dark hair and white shirt paired with a black vest. At the end of the row was someone who was either Ryuichi or Ryuichi's biggest fan, complete with a floppy two-foot-high Kumagoro which she waved at the screen before or during any scene having anything to do with Ryuichi once the showing began.\n\nThe other members of the party were less clearly visible in the darkened auditorium, although they apparently filled the entire row and spilled over onto the floor in front. One of them could be heard calling to the girl impersonating Yuki (the sarcastic romance novelist whom excitable fluff-ball protagonist Shuichi falls in love with), who may or may not have originally been part of their group, to \"come sit with the Gravi people!\" I'd spotted \"Yuki\" earlier in the audience at the Gravitation voice actors' panel, and would never have guessed that she was supposed to be one of the Gravitation characters at all if one of the more extroverted members of the Gravi-codenamed group (presumably Shuichi, although she wasn't wearing a pink wig or anything else which visually recalled that character's appearance) hadn't yelled \"Yuki!\" and run up the aisle to embrace the new arrival, whose costume consisted of a dark blue shirt, a black blazer and pants, and an inexpensive blond wig more reminiscent of Power Girl's early Beatles-type hairstyle than Yuki's messier artfully disheveled look.\n\nWith the appearance of the set-up screen for the Gravitation DVD  a shot of Shuichi and Yuki together  on the projection screen, the five minutes of fan girl screaming that followed made it disconcertingly obvious that this viewing of the English-language version of the show was all too likely to be a Rocky Horror Picture Show-level interactive experience. Sure enough, throughout the next ninety minutes there were frequent outbursts of screaming so loud and sustained that I longed for the real Yuki to materialize and, as he so often does to Shuichi in the manga, peremptorily order the overwrought fan girls to shut up. A number of similarly screaming-averse audience members actually did yell \"Shut up!\" and \"Quiet!\", but this had a sufficiently limited effect that one particular scene in which Shuichi's best friend/band mate Hiro apparently flirtatiously teases him about being in love with Yuki was almost entirely drowned out.\n\nAll in all, the convention personnel would have been well advised to leave the subtitles on in addition to the English-language soundtrack, as they accidentally did for the first ten minutes or so of the initial episode. At least that way those who had never seen the Gravitation TV series before would have been better able to follow what was being said even when the dialogue was inaudible over the over-enthusiastic audience response. We would also have been able to at least get some idea of what the various J-pop songs Shuichi and his fellow musicians perform actually say, since the musical sequences were left unchanged from the original Japanese version even though the spoken dialogue was dubbed. As Bill Rogers, who provided the English-language voice of record company executive/Nittle Grasper member Tohma Seguchi, had explained earlier at the voice actors' panel, this was done because redoing the music with English lyrics would have entailed purchasing an additional set of copyright rights not included with those for the non-musical portions of the series.\n\nThe crowd at AnimeNext in general skewed younger (\"What is this, a teenybopper convention?\" remarked one of the two twenty something guys standing in front of me on the registration line. \"Isn't there anyone here who's over eighteen?\"), more evenly divided between male and female, and even more cosplay (i.e., costume-wearing)-oriented than the attendees at the Labor Day weekend 2003 Big Apple Anime Fest, the last anime con I'd been to. Something like a third of those present seemed to be wearing at least some token semblance of a costume as they wandered through the halls. Many attendees had transformed themselves into quite elaborate recreations of various anime characters, including one vampire Alucard from Hellsing  whose ankle-length red cloth coat looked more incongruously cheerful than bloodily intimidating, at least in broad daylight  and two white-wigged young women costumed as Chi, the android heroine of Chobits, and her more somberly black-garbed identical twin sister (http://www.animenext.org/2004/cosplay2/pics/DSC_0171.jpg). There were also several people of both sexes dressed as Kenshin Himura, the redheaded samurai hero of Rurouni Kenshin, most of them wearing wigs with their pink and white kimonos. However, there was one young man who had simply tied his own naturally red hair back in a long ponytail, although the physical resemblance to Kenshin pretty much ended there, since he didn't have bangs and was nearly a foot taller than the five foot two height ascribed to the character in the manga. (I later heard him telling some other cosplayers that he had chosen this particular character because you couldn't really wear a wig with long hair, and he didn't want to cut his off.)\n\nBy far the most frequently-spotted character costume was that of Nicholas D. Wolfwood, the gun slinging-priest buddy/sidekick of Vash the Stampede, the outlaw protagonist of the science fiction Western Trigun, probably because in a pinch one could impersonate the unconventional clergyman simply by putting on a black suit and open-collared white shirt. Of course, the effect produced was much more recognizable if one also toted around some version of Wolfwood's Cross Punisher, a six-foot-high cross wrapped in white canvas which in the anime turns out to contain several dozen guns. One particularly clever cosplayer had come up with an ingenious variation on this, instead carrying around a large white canvas-wrapped Star of David which inevitably inspired delighted cries of \"A Jewish Wolfwood!\"  frequently accompanied by requests to take his photograph  wherever he went (http://www.animenext.org/2004/cosplay2/pics/DSC_1321.jpg). \"Rabbi Wolfowitz, at your service,\" was his standard line, along with \"Wherever there are priests, there are rabbis.\" He even looked a bit like Wolfwood (if Wolfwood had had a goatee), or at least a lot more like him than the rather chubby, bespectacled guy I'd seen lugging around a Cross Punisher at both the Big Apple Anime Fest and the I-Con comics, science fiction, and anime con at Stony Brook University on Long Island several months later. (On the latter occasion, the two teenage girls in Hogwarts uniforms standing on line behind me, who were evidently not anime fans, had had a protracted conversation about him based on the misapprehension that he was supposed to be Jesus, making various giggling remarks such as \"I didn't know Jesus wore glasses.\")\n\nIn addition to appearances by voice actors from various anime series, there were also a number of panels on topics like \"Foreigners in Anime/Manga\"  discussed by shoujo (girls' comics) manga scholar and former Animerica columnist Matt Thorn, whose very informative website (www.matt-thorn.com) is definitely worth checking out, and Animefringe (www.animefringe.com) writer Dillon Font, who had done an excellent presentation on the same topic at the 2003 Big Apple Anime Fest. Other interesting panels included one on Japanese history, in which the panelists pointed out that many aspects of what is now considered traditional Japanese culture, such as Kabuki Theater and much of the now-standard \"traditional\" Japanese diet were not established until sometime in the nineteenth century.\n\nAt a panel on myth, magic, and religion in anime and manga, moderated by Mari Morimoto, a freelance translator for Viz, among other companies, Morimoto and fellow-panelist Matt Thorn attempted to explain the more eclectic, non-exclusive Japanese spiritual worldview, in which it is considered perfectly normal and acceptable to utilize elements of Shinto, Buddhist, and Christian religious practices in turn as the occasion warrants. This has been known to lead to occasional culturally-based difficulties in handling anime and manga which may unintentionally offend some Western viewers by using idiosyncratically-interpreted Christian elements as decorative or dramatic motifs. (The native Japanese Morimoto provided a live demonstration of the differences between traditional Japanese and Christian attitudes toward certain topics by responding to one audience member's assertion that Miroku in Inu-Yasha was an example of a corrupt clergyman with a casual, \"Oh, he's just randy.\") A question about whether or not there is any Satan-like evildoer-in-chief in traditional Japanese religion or folklore (the answer was no) led to a discussion of the relative moral fluidity of supernatural characters like Inu-Yasha, kitsune (fox spirits) like his sidekick Shippo, and the youkai in Saiyuki. The official supernatural classifications of all of these characters have occasionally been translated into English using the morally-charged term \"demon\", even though these beings tend to be changeable or morally ambivalent in the style of Western faeries or certain gods of classical mythology, rather than automatically evil by definition like the supernatural troublemakers of Christian theology they are often inexactly compared to.\n\nOne particularly noteworthy aspect of AnimeNext which I haven't encountered at any other anime convention I've attended so far was the manga room. This was a sort of lending library where, in exchange for temporarily handing over your convention-goer's badge, you could borrow from a selection of several hundred manga and sit reading them in the manga room itself or in the hallway outside. As the weekend wore on, the manga room became more and more crowded with people taking advantage of this admirable opportunity to sample the initial volumes of unfamiliar manga without having to buy them first, or to catch up on further installments of series which they'd been interested enough to start reading, but were reluctant to pay full price for more volumes of. By the time I left for home late Sunday afternoon, I had managed to finish five manga by means of this method, in addition to watching five hours of Full Metal Panic! (an anime about an ultra-efficient, but occasionally comically rigid and literal-minded, teenage boy secret agent assigned to act as a sort of clandestine bodyguard to a feisty Japanese schoolgirl who may be the unwitting bearer of Area 51-type alien technology secrets) and two and a half episodes of Someday's Dreamers. The latter is a rather wistful, shoujo-style series about a teenage girl from the country who comes to Tokyo to train as a mage, whose manga I'd be much more interested in seeing translated than the more blatant Harry Potter clones like Negima and Psychic Academy currently available in English.\n\nAll in all, AnimeNext was one of the better anime cons I have attended, and I have every intention of going again next year."
