        "text": "This year's 38th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine published the final chapter of Daijirō Nonoue's The Last Saiyuki (Saigo no Saiyūki) manga on Monday. Shueisha will publish the manga's second compiled book volume on September 4, and the third and final volume in November.\n\nShueisha describes the manga:\n\nReturning from school, third-grader Ryunosuke is introduced to a young girl. His father tells him that she will be his little sister starting that day. Her name is Koharu. She is blind and her arms and legs are prosthetics. She holds within her a power beyond human understanding... A bizarre and fantastic Saiyuki story for a new generation!\n\nThe manga launched in this year's 14th issue of Shueisha's Weekly Shonen Jump magazine on March 4. Both Viz Media's Shonen Jump app and website, as well as Shueisha's MANGA Plus app and website published chapters of the manga in English as they were released in Japan.\n\nNonoue serialized the two-volume Mutō Black manga in Weekly Shonen Jump in 2013. Nonoue published the two-chapter \"Ikimono Seitai Kansatsu Variety: Bokura wa Minna\" short manga on the Shonen Jump+ app and website in May 2015. Nonoue's one-shots have also serialized in the Weekly Shonen Jump and Jump Next! magazines."
