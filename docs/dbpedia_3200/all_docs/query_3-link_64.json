        "text": "YEEEESSSSSSS!!!! They're going to continue the anime now that the manga is complete!\n\nI was really dissapointed with the ending of the first anime series! I understand that the manga was still ongoing at the time and they were running out of ideas for fillers, but after sitting through 167 episodes, I expected a little better of a conclusion. Had it have been like Claymore and only consisted of maybe 26 episodes, I think I would have found the open ending a little less frustrating.\n\nThe Final Act will cover volumes 36-56 of the manga. Eventhough I have to admit there were a lot of things I wasn't happy with as far as the way the manga ended, there were several arcs within those 20 volumes that I would LOVE to see animated on screen!! I'm really excited about this!\n\nThis information is coming from Crankitanime.com. They've got a complete list of the 2009 fall anime lineup for Japan! I seriously hope that Viz media will grab this Inuyasha installment when the oppurtunity arises! I also hope all the original cast for the ENG dub return! I was reallly pissed when another dubbing company decided to do the two sequels to Saiyuki. The original Saiyuki series was dubbed by ADV and it sounded great! A different company did the dubs for Reload and Gunlock and it was horrible! It's amazing how much a voice alone can define a character!\n\nBack to the original subject, Inuyasha: The Final Act airs in Japan in October. Bonzai!!\n\n*UPDATE* Viz announced at Comic Con back in July that they WILL be doing the english dub for this!!! Yay!!!\n\nmanga photo courtesy of adinuyasha.com\n\nTags:anime, inuyasha"
