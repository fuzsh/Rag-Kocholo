Shocked by the tragic death of Nataku, Goku's true raw power was released in the form of the \"Seiten Taisei\" when his youkai power limiter, his golden diadem, was broken. A massacre occurred and those in the area were overwhelmed by his destructive power. Kanzeon Bosatsu knocked the beast out, but Konzen Douji stepped in to stop her. However, for protecting Goku, Konzen, Kenren, and Tenpou were made enemies of Heaven. They took their commanding officer, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean, Goujun, hostage and they attempted to flee to the Lower World. The four of them--Konzen, Goku, Kenren and Tenpou--promised that “We'll always be together,” “Even if we get separated, we'll meet again beneath the sakura in the Lower World.” The four headed for the only path connecting Heaven and the Lower World: the Dimension Gate. They released Goujun as Tenpou and Kenren gave their report to him telling him that they will resign in their positions. The four of them entered the Heavenly Palace and encountered Enrai's unit, Western Army Second Unit, but thanks to the Western Army First Unit who barged in and fight to help their superiors escape. In Tenpou's last order, he ordered them to kill all Second Unit in the room and do not let a single person who'd seen them leave alive. After Tenpou and Kenren left, Rikuou encouraged his fellow First Unit that they will complete the mission and it will be their final battle.\n\n2\"Episode 2\"June 24, 2011 ( )\n\nTenpou and Kenren invited Konzen and Goku to have a picnic under the cherry blossoms. While they were having a picnic, Kenren challenge Goku to climb the tree. The conversation later on goes about the cherry blossoms. Kenren mentioned that Cherry Blossoms in lower world are different from those of Heaven. Different in the way they bloom they fall. This made Konzen curious and wanted to see how they bloom in the lower world. Goku didn't understand what Kenren was trying to say, Konzen's words made Goku's heart tighten for a moment. And without realizing, Goku's branch where he standing broke and fell on Konzen's head. Back to the present, at that time, Li Touten's comrade assassinated the Heavenly Emperor. The blame fell on Konzen and the rest, and they were attacked by the ‘Natakus’, the failed man-made weapons that didn't become ‘Prince Nataku.’ Kenren acted as bait, and let the other three escapes. Kenren struggled against the Natakus, but he was mortally wounded, and fell. The three managed to infiltrate into the lowest level of the Heavenly Palace. However, the Gate had been placed under heavy guard. There, Tenpou decided to draw the attack of the Gate guards himself in order to allow Konzen and Goku to go on ahead. Meanwhile, Kenren found himself bloody and suffering from fatal wounds. Goujun, his superior, found him among the carnage having a smoke. He asked Kenren about these beasts and he more or less told Goujun that he and Tenpou had been suspecting something similar to what he saw before him from the start. Goujun told Kenren to surrender, and Kenren, never being one to let sleeping dogs lie, challenged Goujun instead, even in his state. He planned to go down fighting. But it turns out that not all of the Natakus were dead. One was still alive. Kenren saved Goujun by pushing him down a shaft and told the beast that he felt pity for it and that it should eat him and make sure nothing of him was left. All the Nataku beast were suffering creatures. The crying beast killed Kenren as Goujun gave him a salute as a sign of his respect.\n\n3\"Episode 3\"November 25, 2011 ( )\n\nTenpou was enjoying the battle, the numbers were too uneven and he suffered a fatal wound. He took care of all the guards, but in a duel with the remaining Sho’u, Tenpou too, as though chasing after Kenren, met his end. Goku and Konzen reached the Dimension Gate. After surviving various hardships, they finally managed to open it. However, they came up against Li Touten's resistance, and Konzen sent Goku through first. Konzen tried desperately to make it through as the Gate rapidly began to close, but only Goku got out on the other side. Konzen promised Goku, “Next time I'll reach out my hands to you!” and disappeared into golden ashes that crushed in the Gate. Time went by, and Heaven sought to restore order. The Heavenly Emperor had died, the Heavenly Palace was destroyed, the Thousand-Year Cherry Blossom petals had scattered. The people and the army were all thrown into chaos. Amid all this, Kanzeon Bosatsu remained stolidly on the Lower World-side of the Dimension Gate, gently holding the despairing Goku, and sealed his memories away. All of his memories were erased except for his name ‘Goku’. The punishment imposed upon Goku was ‘500 years of loneliness.’ Deprived of his memories and shackled, Goku was sealed in a mountaintop stone prison, as countless seasons went by. And when 500 years have passed, a shining figure appears before Goku's eyes, and holds out a hand. Goku reaches a hand toward the light, Genjo Sanzo.\n\n4\"Saiyuki Gaiden: Kouga no Shou\"April 26, 2013 ( )\n\nKanzeon Bosatsu was wandering in the demolished private library of Tenpou when she found Goku's drawing of him with Tenpou, Konzen and Kenren under the cherry blossoms.
