        "text": "To begin the explanation on a somewhat low note, Japanese computer literacy is quite low (about a quarter of students have never even touched a computer), but mobile usage is incredibly high. That sounds a bit random, but it's important to consider because it shows that the internet is a relatively recent thing when it comes to discussing manga. This is relevant because it's one of the major reasons why Jump manga is much faster nowadays; retention time.\n\nYou may have read studies which state that the attention span of young people has been going down over time. There's varying validity to these studies, but it's directly relevant to the way new series are consumed because the discussion is far, far more connected in the present than in the past. Back in the 2000s, \"word of mouth\" was literal, most discussion was built on what one person said to their IRL friends about series they read in the latest issue, conversation is now shared almost instantly among hundreds of people in mere hours after the issue drops. The conversation is faster, hence, to gain interest, thou must be faster.\n\nIf I had to give the exact cutoff when a manga's fate is determined, that would simply be when the chapters making up Volume 1 are done, as that is when Jump starts properly judging them. Vol 1 will be, in the long term, the first impression, after all.\n\nSo, with that in mind, what happens in Vol 1 of The Last Saiyuki?\n\n...Not all that much, honestly. There's some establishing for the emotions of the characters, a few encounters with monster, a whole lot of exposition, and then, in the last 25 pages, a confrontation with an actual villain which isn't even finished. There isn't really much in the way of things which can warrant discussion or attention, not even many fights. This is made even more glaring by the little detail that not ONCE does the action leave Ryunosuke's house, the static location makes it feel like the manga is spinning its wheels.\n\nBy comparison, let's look at what I consider the perfect Vol 1 for the Modern Era, Jujutsu Kaisen. In the first volume of that series, we establish the main trio of characters, have the main conceit established, set-up for multiple plot threads, and then a major plot turn in the main cast being utterly annihilated on a mission, Itadori being forced to bring out Sukuna, and the knowledge that one of them isn't going to make it.\n\nThis works. It works, because, along with being good, it answers the feedback loop. The information level is high, but it's coherent and promotes discussion. It creates a fandom through pure interaction.\n\nSaiyuki doesn't have that. It doesn't have that, and it fails because of that, even though it accomplishes the purpose of being a high-quality manga."
