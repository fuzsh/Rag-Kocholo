        "text": "It has been more than three years since the fans last saw Saiyuki Reload Blast, and ever since then, they are waiting for Sayuki Reload Blast Season 2. It was the fourth and the most recent anime series of the Saiyuki franchise. The fans really liked its debut installment. However, they never got to see its following season. So, will the anime ever return? Here are all the latest details.\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast is a Japanese supernatural adventure anime series. It is an anime adaptation of the fourth manga series in the Saiyuki franchise by Kazuya Minekura. The anime series made its debut on July 5, 2017. It only ran for twelve episodes which ended on September 20, 2017. The fans are waiting for the following installment of the anime series ever since they watched the twelfth episode of the show.\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast Season 2: Renewal Status!\n\nHideaki Nakano helmed the anime series, which was produced by Platinum Vision animation studios. Its debut seasons served as a sequel to the Reload Gunlock. But the fans never saw the sequel of this series, and now they are eagerly waiting for it. They are quite surprised that the makers haven’t announced Saiyuki Reload Season 2 yet, even after its success. The makers neither canceled nor renewed the anime for its second season. And that means the future of the show is still uncertain.\n\nIs There Enough Source Material?\n\nAfter the third volume of the manga series, it went on a hiatus due to the poor health and surgery of its author. The fans saw its last chapter back in December 2014. It has been six years, and the fans are yet to see the new chapter of the manga. Unfortunately, Platinum Vision studio already exhausted all the source material in the debut season of the anime. Therefore, now they don’t have anything left to adapt in Saiyuki Reload Blast Season 2. And that is definitely not a good thing for the future of the anime series.\n\nSaiyuki Reload Blast Season 2: Will The Anime Return?\n\nSeveral factors decide the future of anime. And currently, all of them are not in favor of the show’s second season. The main reason that the anime series will not return is the lack of its source material. The ratings and the viewership of the previous season were fine enough to make it return. However, the Saiyuki Ibun manga series is yet to be adapted in anime. So it is likely that instead of Saiyuki Reload Blast Season 2, the fans might see the anime adaptation of Saiyuki Ibun."
