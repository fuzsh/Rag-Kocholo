The series has spawned a media franchise that includes five anime series. Pierrot produced a 50-episode anime television series titled Gensomaden Saiyuki that aired from April 2000 to March 2001, and won the twenty-third annual Animage Anime Grand Prix prize for best anime. The same studio developed an anime film adaptation and two anime sequel series titled Saiyuki Reload and Saiyuki Reload Gunlock, which were broadcast together in Japan from October 2003 to September 2004.

But now, someone is trying to bring the demon king Gyumao back to life generating waves of evil energy which flow throughout the territory, driving the Yokai crazy and awakening within them dark instincts that drive them to massacre humans. The Buddhist Trinity then urgently dispatches one of the five Sanzo, the sacred guardians of the five creative sutras of the world. Genjo Sanzo, the complete opposite of the image expected of such a high-ranking bronze, is entrusted with the mission of going to the west of Togenkyo in order to stop the resurrection of evil god named Gyumao. For this he will be accompanied by his faithful companion Son Goku, a 15-year-old child who looks like a little monkey and spends his time eating, Sha Gojyo, a great flirt and drinker before the eternal, and Cho Hakkai, always smiling and friendly but hiding a heavy past, the only ones who have not been affected a priori by this curse which affects the yokais. Along the way they will encounter many adversaries and face just as many journeys. Meanwhile, the black waves continue to spread. Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo and Hakkai during a short stopover in a village meet the beautiful Shunrei whose lover was a yokai. This forbidden romance came to a tragic end when the young yokai transformed into a monster. We also discover that Gojyo is looking for his half-brother, Jien, who disappeared after committing a crime to save him. Shortly after, while Sanzo and his gang are taking a well-deserved rest in a restaurant-bar, they are attacked by Yaone, the herbalist from Kogaiji, the son of the terrible bull demon Gyumao, who intervenes to save her. Four heroes are impressed by his power and charisma.\n\nA little further down the road, they discover a mountain of yokai corpses. It seems that the person responsible for this carnage is a monk nicknamed “the savior”. But in truth, the monk Rikudo, with his mutilated face and body covered with incantatory seals, is none other than Shuei, a specialist in incantations that Sanzo knew during his childhood... Sanzo's former friend turns out to be possessed by an evil incantatory seal. While he confronts Sanzo's gang with the intention of killing the gang's youkais, that is to say Goku, Hakkai and Gojyo, he pierces Sanzo with his Buddhist stick while the latter had interposed himself between Rikudo and Goku to save the boy. The minutes pass, interminable, and only the sound of falling rain resonates. When he sees his dying friend, Goku goes berserk and his yokai power controller breaks. His former power then released, Goku becomes violent and begins to destroy everything in his path. Meanwhile, at Hojo Castle, Lady Gyokumen, Gyumao's mistress who is trying by all means to resurrect him, is getting impatient: she wants the death of Sanzo and his gang. Ririn, Kogaiji's half-sister, decides to take on the challenge alone, but that's without counting on a new and mysterious enemy who seems to have a score to settle with Hakkai. As Genjyo Sanzo, Sha Gojyo, Cho Hakkai and Son Goku continue their pilgrimage west, they encounter a mysterious fortune teller, Chin Yi-So. This one is in fact a youkai who has the ability to summon Shikigami (creature summoned by such and such to serve him) and will not deprive himself of it to attack our friends. However, the youkai has a fierce hatred towards Cho Hakkai, whom he calls by his old first name, Cho Gono. To defeat him, he will have to face his most terrifying ghosts. Flashback to the meeting of the four outlaws on a mission to save the world! On a full moon night, Sha Gojyo finds a half-dead man in the middle of the path... And while the Buddhist Trinity sends Genjo Sanzo on the trail of a human who has become a youkai, Sanzo, accompanied by Goku, sets out on the trace of Cho Gono... The tortuous thread of destiny inexorably guides the four friends... Cho Gono committed a terrible crime in the name of revenge. Tortured by remorse, he seeks the answer to his questions. During their journey, Sanzo and his gang infiltrate the lair of a desert youkai believed to have stolen one of the sutras of the opening of Heaven and Earth. But during their fight, Sanzo collapses, struck down by the yokai's deadly fish.\n\nSanzo, poisoned by the venom of a yokai, oscillates between life and death. The sandcastle in which our four heroes were imprisoned begins to collapse in a shattering tumult. Fortunately, the Sanzo gang is saved at the last minute by Kogaiji. But he challenges Goku to a duel in order to recover the sacred sutra. Goku hesitates but his emotions, his desire not to lose a loved one, push him to make a terrible decision: he takes off his golden crown himself! But after Goku defeats Kogaiji, while Gojyo and Hakkai are really struggling to stop Goku's murderous madness, a gunshot rings out, Shortly after this terrible ordeal, the gang rested in a neighboring town. While out doing some shopping, Gojyo saves a little boy who is being mistreated by a group of thugs. Without knowing that his act will cause a new drama... Impossible but yet terribly real: Goku and Hakkai have fallen, defeated! Prisoners of the dimension contained in the jar of the young demon Kinkaku, they will have to demonstrate tenacity against the dark entities who hunt there, and in particular Kinkaku's own twin, Ginkaku. For their part, Sanzo and Gojyo will both have to learn to team up to help their friends, even if it means supporting each other for an indefinite period... Faced with the sad fate reserved for the twins Kinkaku and Ginkaku, Gojyo loses his cool and sets out alone in the footsteps of the one who calls himself \"God\". Whoever he may be, he is undoubtedly the most formidable adversary the gang has encountered so far, and our heroes already find themselves trapped in his hands, in a deadly game where the rules mean nothing. and where the disproportionate power of the enemy leaves no chance... The unthinkable has happened: defeated, injured and humiliated, the members of Sanzo's gang leave the domain of \"God\". The defeat rekindles tensions within the fine team, and it seems that this time their tenacity is undermined... The Sanzo Party are determined to take back the sutra stolen by God and take revenge for the humiliation he inflicted on them.\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nManga\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of Saiyuki volumes\n\nThe manga Saiyuki consists of five series whose release depends on the author's health.
