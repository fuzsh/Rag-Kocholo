Saiyuki was the first manga installment of Saiyuki serialized in G-Fantasy from 1996 to 2002.

Saiyuki consists of nine volumes. The covers of each volume feature each of the characters in turn. The rotation starts with Genjo Sanzo on the first cover, Son Goku on the second, Sha Gojyo on the third, and Cho Hakkai on the fourth. The cycle is repeated again and on the ninth volume all four of them are featured on the cover.

The first English translation was published in graphic novel form in March 2004 by Tokyopop. In 2020, Kodansha US released new translation in 4 omnibus volumes, titled Saiyuki: The Original Series Resurrected Edition[1].

最遊記 (Saiyuki) translated as: "Journey to the Extreme" is a pun of 西遊記 (also pronounced Saiyuki) which translates as: "Journey to the West".

Synopsis[]

Renegade priest Genjo Sanzo is assigned by the Sanbutsushin the mission of stopping the Minus Wave , a mystical plague that has afflicted the youkai of Shangri-La with madness. He is ordered to assemble a team of his old companions, Son Goku , Cho Hakkai , and Sha Gojyo , all of whom are part youkai, to accompany him on his quest. Initially he feared that they might be susceptible to the plague as well, but after watching them in action, Sanzo is reminded that they are, after all, part human, and their wills are strong. His doubts dispelled, they begin their journey to the West.
