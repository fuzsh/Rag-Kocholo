Allison and Alex found us through Pinterest, which I have to say made me very excited to hear that! As photographers and business owners, we try different forms of advertisement, with word of mouth being the most important of all of them. We also advertise with The Knot (which is great because we are able to collect all of our reviews there!). But Pinterest has had such a huge impact on photography, so it’s great when our couples pin their engagement photos!

A couple of weeks ago, I met up with Allison and Alex at Kraft Azalea Gardens for their engagement session. We started their session nice and early, and the weather was just beautiful! They looked gorgeous, and they were cuddly, loving, and giggly the entire time! <3 Perfection!

We can’t wait for their wedding this September at Lake Mary Events Center!
