Oh man! Forest engagement session is here! Sarah and Alex, two humans that fell madly in love on a canoe, were incredibly willing to explore one of my favorite fishing spots during their e-shoot! Bear Pond, a beautiful pond located in the Seminole Forest right outside of Orlando, served as a whimsical backdrop full of adventure and magical forest creatures. Enjoy the photos!
