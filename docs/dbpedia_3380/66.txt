For Maddie and Alex’s Winter Park engagement photo session, we had a couple of ideas in mind. Before we get to the location though, we always have a discovery call. It’s one of my favorite parts because not only do I get to learn about my couple, but I get to see their vision for our upcoming session.

Our discovery call was super fun, I learned that they had amazing personalities and I wanted those to shine through the photos. I also learned they wanted a family portrait of them and their dogs, Bo, Cash, and Howard. Continuing the conversation, they brought up the movie Mastermind with Zach Galifianakis, and yes, I’ve had to look up how to spell his last name numerous times. I’ve never seen the movie but I immediately knew the photos they were thinking of. Now that I had an understanding of the location, style, and vibe, we had our game plan.

The most important thing I tell all my couples is to make the session what they want. Imagine that you’re going to hang these on your wall, what do you envision? What outfits? What poses?

I’ll make another blog post helping out with engagement photos but enjoy scrolling through Maddie and Alex’s Kraft Azalea Engagement photos!
