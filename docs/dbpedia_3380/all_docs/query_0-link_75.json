        "text": "FC Cincinnati 2 and New England Revolution II battled to a scoreless draw Wednesday afternoon at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. The Orange and Blue (13-5-3, 43 points) ousted Revs II in the shootout, 6-5, earning their first shootout win of the season. Cincinnati remain top of the Eastern Conference table while Revs II (4-13-3, 17 points) take a point for the first time since June 14.\n\nThe two sides battled through a scoreless first half which saw Cincinnatiâs Kenji Mboma Dem hit the crossbar in the eighth minute of play. Mboma Dem finished the half with four attempts on goal, leading all players. New Englandâs Joshua Bolma struck the outside of the post in the 26th minute for Revs IIâs best chance of the first 45.\n\nThe stalemate continued through the second half with Hunter Morse and the Cincinnati defense stifling New Englandâs attack. Morse played a key role in preserving the shutout which now marks three consecutive matches that the Orange and Blue, and Morse, have not conceded a goal.\n\nThe Orange and Blue prevailed in the shootout to pick up an extra point from spot kicks. Cincinnati and New England converted on their first five attempts before Morse made a save against New Englandâs Luka Borovic in the sixth round. Yeiner Valoyes converted on Cincinnatiâs final attempt to earn two points.\n\nâI think Hunter has turned the corner this year,â said Head Coach Tyrone Marshall. âHeâs had the opportunity to see the game from the sideline over the last year and now he has a chance to be in goal this year, heâs doing well. Heâs calm, heâs making the right decisions and making some great saves. We are extremely confident when we have Morse in goal, and it takes some of that pressure off of our defenders.â\n\nFC Cincinnati 2 return home on Friday, August 16, to take on Carolina Core FC at 6 p.m. ET at Scudamore Field at NKU Soccer Stadium. Tickets can be claimed with a SeatGeek account through the FC Cincinnati App. Instructions on how to claim tickets on the app can be found here.\n\nFC CINCINNATI 2 GAME REPORT\n\nFC Cincinnati 2 at New England Revolution II\n\nDate: August 7, 2024\n\nCompetition: MLS NEXT Pro\n\nVenue: Gillette Stadium\n\nKickoff: 11:04 a.m. ET\n\nWeather: 63 degrees, cloudy\n\nSCORING SUMMARY: 1-2-F\n\nNE: 0-0-0\n\nCIN: 0-0-0\n\nNE â None\n\nCIN â None\n\nSHOOTOUT SUMMARY\n\nNE: Marcos Dias â MAKE\n\nCIN: Kenji Mboma Dem â MAKE\n\nNE: Patrick Leal â MAKE\n\nCIN: Nico Benalcazar â MAKE\n\nNE: Gevork Diarbian â MAKE\n\nCIN: Stefan Chirila â MAKE\n\nNE: Eric Klein â MAKE\n\nCIN: Yair Ramos â MAKE\n\nNE: Joshua Bolma â MAKE\n\nCIN: Moises Tablante â MAKE\n\nNE: Luka Borovic â SAVE\n\nCIN: Yeiner Valoyes â MAKE\n\nLINEUPS\n\nNE: Maxwell Weinstein, Moshtaba Al-Hasnawi (Hesron Barry 70â), Tiago, Giovanni CalderÃ³n (C) (Luka Borovic 17â), Colby Quinones, Patrick Leal, Eric Klein, Marcos Dias, Joshua Bolma, Liam Butts (Javaun Mussenden 70â), Alex Monis (Gevork Diarbian 70â)\n\nSubstitutes not used: Robert Nichols III, Brandonn Bueno, Andrej Bjelajac, Sage Kinner, Owen Beninga\n\nHead Coach: Richie Williams\n\nCIN: Hunter Morse, Juan Machado, Brian Schaefer, Nico Benalcazar (C), Moises Tablante, Yair Ramos, Peter Mangione (Justin Hylton 90â+3), Jesus Castellano, Kenji Mboma Dem, Ben Stitz (Yeiner Valoyes 77â), Stefan Chirila\n\nSubstitutes not used: Luke Broz, Will Kuisel, Lincoln Matuskiewicz, Nicholas Samways, Connor Stout\n\nHead Coach: Tyrone Marshall\n\nSTATS SUMMARY: NE/CIN\n\nShots: 16 / 17\n\nShots on Goal: 2 / 2\n\nSaves: 2 / 2\n\nCorner Kicks: 5 / 9\n\nFouls: 17 / 17\n\nOffside: 2 / 0\n\nMISCONDUCT SUMMARY\n\nNE â Giovanni Calderon (Yellow Card) 5â\n\nNE â Joshua Bolma (Yellow Card) 26â\n\nCIN â Yair Ramos (Yellow Card) 33â\n\nNE â Lulka Borovic (Yellow Card) 80â"
