Nearly as important, is the full C-Suite alignment. 2) Deployed via Professional Services/or via one or our approved partners with a concrete realistic time line for roll out stages. 3) Full account team engagement before/during/after roll out. Full accountability. No excuses. 4) Impeccable internal handover to Renewals 6-12 months from current subscription end date. Renewals then take over and this is where the team showcase not just commercial and relationship acumen, they treat people like human beings and respect is the key word. We take this very seriously at Okta and anyone who knows me understands I live and breathe renewals. It is not a job for me, it is a passion. WE do not settle for anything other than a world class renewals experience for all our customers and my team will go above and beyond to exceed expectations. Our No1 goal is to have happy and successful customers who WANT to renew as they see that Okta is transparent, ethical and clear in all communications while leading the way from a technological standpoint.
