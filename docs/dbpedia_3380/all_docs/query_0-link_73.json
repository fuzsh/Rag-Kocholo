        "text": "Orlando, Florida – United States Attorney Roger B. Handberg announces that Chadwick Lemaine (26, Orlando) has pleaded guilty to possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Lemaine faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in federal prison. His sentencing hearing is set on October 31, 2024.\n\nAccording to court records, Lemaine was convicted of felony offenses in 2018 and 2019 and was therefore prohibited from possessing firearms. On May 26, 2023, an officer with the Orlando Police Department conducted a traffic stop of Lemaine and discovered narcotics and a firearm inside the vehicle. A DNA analysis confirmed Lemaine was a contributor to the DNA discovered on the firearm.\n\nThis case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Orlando Police Department. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Adam J. Nate.\n\nThis case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and gun violence, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. On May 26, 2021, the Department launched a violent crime reduction strategy strengthening PSN based on these core principles: fostering trust and legitimacy in our communities, supporting community-based organizations that help prevent violence from occurring in the first place, setting focused and strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring the results."
