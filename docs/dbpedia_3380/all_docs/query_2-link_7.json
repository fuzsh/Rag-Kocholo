        "text": "Let’s Make Money Moves.\n\nListen, I know talking about finances is always a bit.. awkward. I’LL JUST NAME THESE COLLECTION’S WITH THE OFFICE (Yes the TV Show) REFERENCES SO IT MAKES YOU relax more about the $$ or just get a good laugh WHILE reading through them.\n\nBUT LET’S BE REAL FOR just a SECOND….\n\nThis is my full-time job. I devote my time to making sure my couples have all the best images from the best day of their lives. I always have the most updated EQUIPMENT with extra back up cameras so no moments are missed! I spend loads of money on software and backup programs to make sure your images are safe always, I even go as far as uploading your images as soon I get home from your wedding (NO MATTER WHAT TIME IT IS, I STAY UP AND LOAD THE WHOLE WEDDING) and start backing them up on to a hard drive then the memory cards go right into my two fire proof safes, yes I said “two” I don’t mess around, if there was a fire at my house I GOT YOU still. I also make sure your images start uploading on to an online backup software asap! So by the end of the night, I have your images backed up in 3-4 different locations. some call me crazy but your images are treasures and I will do whatever it takes to keep them safe.\n\nbut let’s chat more about the price tag…\n\nIn 50 years, you’re not going to be showing your grandkids the bill from your wedding, right? No – hanging in your home will be all of the irreplaceable moments. Like when you first saw yourself in the mirror, all glammed up and trying not to cry. And the ‘just married’ kiss with your person.\n\nOr maybe even the last dance you ever got with your dad ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE LAST PHOTO YOU GOT WITH GRANDMA.\n\nTrust me, you’re gonna be glad you invested in someone who captured it all the right way AKA ME!"
