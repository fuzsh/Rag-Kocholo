        "text": "On Wednesday, July 24, Grosse Pointe Woods Mayor Arthur Bryant once again made the plunge into the pool to celebrate a Lakefront Swimming Association championship.\n\n“I don’t know if any other mayor in the country does that,” Grosse Pointe Woods Warriors coach Greg Wolff said.\n\nBryant’s dive to join the swimmers and coaches in the pool at Windmill Pointe Park capped off a memorable day for the Woods Warriors, who captured the Lakefront title for a second year in a row. The Warriors won the championship with a total of 354 points — 36.5 points better than the second-place Grosse Pointe Park Mutants and 61 points ahead of the Grosse Pointe Farms Barracudas in third.\n\nWhile last year’s championship win might have come as a bit of a surprise to the Warriors’ coaches and swimmers alike, this year saw them take the pool deck with nothing but confidence.\n\n“Last year, I really didn’t believe it was happening while it was happening,” Wolff said. “… This year, we knew that everyone was gunning for us. We looked at every dual meet as a battle and I knew the championship was going to be tight.”\n\nThe Warriors’ championship came with solid performances throughout more than 60 events in various age groups. Avery Beal set a Lakefront record in the girls 17U 50 freestyle, taking first with a time of 24.41. She also set a record with her first-place finish in the girls 17U 100 IM medley at 1:01.48. Her sister, Hadley Beal, also was a strong contributor to the victory and took first in the girls 14U 50 breaststroke.\n\nThe Orlando family — Amelia, Milania, Isabella, Eliana and Santino — all made big contributions to the win as well. Everyone played a part in the win and the standout performances helped make this year’s finals even more memorable for some of the swimmers.\n\n“We had a lot of kids step up all around,” Wolff said. “Avery (Beal) set three league records in four swims between the prelims and finals. … We have James Gusmano who definitely stepped up for us. Logan Bogner got a league championship. James’ little brother, Peter (Gusmano), was the core of our 13 and 14 group. Ava Van Becelaere got first place in the fly after some disappointment of not making it to the finals in the backstroke. Sometimes, that’s hard for a kid to do, not to make it in one event and come back and perform in another. She’s been a developing leader all the way along.”\n\nThose swimmers and many others created highlights for the Warriors team to seal the title and every swimmer on the roster played a part in the victory. For Wolff, winning a second straight title for the Woods was sweet, but the best part for him is always taking in the atmosphere of the meets and seeing every swimmer, not just the ones on his team, succeed.\n\nWolff is a physical education teacher at Pierce Middle School and assistant coach for Grosse Pointe South High School’s boys varsity swim and dive team, so his own swimmers on the Warriors are not the only swimmers in the Pointes for whom he likes to cheer.\n\n“The Park and City teams have a lot of kids who I have in my classes as a physical education teacher,” he said. “Sometimes, it’s neat to sit back and watch the races and see the kids you know from different situations. Sometimes, I kind of find myself rooting subconsciously for the other teams because I see a kid that I know and I want to see them do well. Even though, of course, I want to win with the Woods team, I still want to see all those kids I know succeed and do well.”\n\nWolff got the best of both worlds at this year’s championships, getting to see many other swimmers he knows find success while also getting to raise the championship trophy with the Woods. While last year’s win was unexpected, this year the Warriors knew they had a shot.\n\nBack-to-back titles can put a target on a team’s back, especially in a competitive league like Lakefront. As his Warriors get ready for the fall to swim with their respective club or school teams, Wolff left them with a final message about preparing for being the hunted when next year’s Lakefront season rolls around.\n\n“It was the same thing we said last year, which was that you kicked the hornet’s nest a bit and now everyone’s coming for you,” Wolff said. “… You’re going to have to work harder now because everyone sees where you are. Nobody’s going to be surprised by us anymore and that’s a good thing.”"
