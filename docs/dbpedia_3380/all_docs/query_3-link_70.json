        "text": "Welcome! I'm Schuyler, but everyone calls me Sky!\n\nI'm the owner of Perfect Sky and have over 25 years of videography experience, primarily focused on Orlando Weddings and Events.\n\nPerfect Sky prides itself on storytelling. Every person and every event has a story and my team brings that to life for our clients to relive through cinematic montages, highlight reels, documentary coverage, teaser trailers and more.\n\nWith more than 1,000 happy clients, we are a professional and established Orlando videography team that our couples know they can trust.\n\n\"The Perfect Sky team was great from beginning to end with so much knowledge to share and we felt as ease with their portfolio, socials, and phone call meetings. Our wedding videos and footage is perfect! We love the edits, detail, options for music and everything in between. The day-off was easy, smooth and fun. It wasn’t fussy or weird but the team made us take in each moment of the day, and you can really see it in our videos. We love them and are so thrilled to have this to share with family and friends and to have it forever. Thank you Perfect Sky Productions!!\"\n\n\"We loved working with Sky and Maria. From our initial call we knew they were the group we wanted to have capture our special day. All the little details we asked them to capture during the wedding they did. The entire process with Sky was easy and stress free. Anyone getting married in Orlando should reach out to them and have them be apart of their special day.\"\n\n\"Our experience with Sky and his assistant was nothing short of incredible. The day of they were such a joy and the best hype crew, encouraging us to be our true selves. They were super flexible and let us add more time when the timeline started running late. Sky even surprised us by showing up to our Magic Kingdom park shoot when originally only his assistant was supposed to be with us. The final product is gorgeous and perfectly encapsulates our relationship as well as showcasing our most magical day. I’m so thankful for all the team’s hard work, their professionalism, and stunning final product. Would highly recommend.\"\n\n\"We had an amazing experience with Perfect Sky Productions for our wedding at Lake Mary Events Center. Schuyler and his team were great from our initial meeting all the way through delivering our final product. They were very professional, fun to work with and they delivered a wedding teaser, film and cinematographic recap that blew our expectations! The editing was amazing! Schuyler is incredibly talented. Brides, look no further! We have video that we will cherish forever to remember our special day. Best part was they caught so many moments that we missed that day. Such a treasure and worthwhile investment!\"\n\n\"Sky and his team provided the best experience I’ve ever had with a videographer. I cried when I saw my wedding video because he captured so many beautiful moments that we did not see. He took everything that was important to us and gave us a lifetime of memories on our most special day. Sky was so easy to work with, they were never intrusive or in the way and seamlessly captured every element of our day. We would choose Perfect Sky Productions a million times over. Thank you for capturing our special day and allowing us to re-live it. You are a master at what you do and we are blessed to have worked with you.\"\n\n\"Schuyler and his team shot our vow renewal week at Disney World and I truly cannot put into words how amazing they were! From our initial communication through our farewell party- every single interaction exceeded my expectations! One thing that stands out to me is that our 6 year old son was very interested in the video equipment... Schuyler took his time to teach him about the equipment and even let him use it a few times. Seemingly 'small' things like that mean the world to us... and that's just the tip of the iceberg of how the Perfect Sky team goes above and beyond. Hire them...you will NOT regret it!!\"\n\n\"We hired Perfect Sky for our wedding and they blew it out of the water! He was recommended by our photographer and did an outstanding job. We were on the fence about wanting a videographer, and I am so glad that we decided to. Run, do not walk, to hire him and his team for your wedding! I cry every time I watch the video and am speechless with how amazing his skills are. He delivered exactly what we asked for. If you value video, and want someone who is a master at their craft and a true professional all-around, look no further! I’m so happy we hired Perfect Sky Wedding films.\"\n\n\"Sky and his team are amazing. They are responsive in planning and when they show up on the day of they are prepared and just really easy to work with. Then they just blend right into the background and you totally forget they are there.... Until you're sitting at your desk at work and start sobbing because the video they create of your special day is just so perfectly captured. I would use Sky time and again. His work and work ethic are both excellent. Thank you for making my day so memorable!\"\n\n\"We first met Schuyler at one of John Michael Wedding tasting events in early 2015 and saw some of his work on both video and photo. His past work and current work continues to surpass customers expectations and the awards prove his experience is there so we chose him to video our wedding. Being nervous was an understatement as it was the year same-sex marriage was passed so we wanted this to be perfect and we can say our end result was nothing but perfect. We would highly recommend anyone use his services for any event, not just weddings.\"\n\n\"Where do we start, can we just take our hats off and say BRAVO! To Perfect Sky! Our wedding video is absolutely amazing, we are so impressed, we were moved to tears, the way our wedding day was captured, the emotions, the essence, the love, everything was captured, and we are so grateful to be able to see this, and relive that day each time we share this video with our loved ones. Our wedding video is such a beautiful work of art, thank you Schuyler for allowing us to have this memory to treasure forever. You are a true talent, thanks a million!\"\n\n\"I knew I wanted Perfect Sky for my wedding videographer. He was recommended by my bridesmaids. I saw his work, I was sold. It was beautiful and artistic. I didn’t want a plain, straight forward film; I wanted something more. When I sat down to meet Sky, I became even more convinced. He was pleasant and funny, while still professional. I felt he wanted to get a sense of who we were as a couple, our story, and how to best show that on film. My family and I love showing it off. He found one of my favorite songs by my favorite, and used that in one of the videos. I highly recommend Perfect Sky Productions. You won’t be disappointed.\"\n\n\"In my previous job, I was VERY involved in the Orlando wedding industry and know wedding vendors. For my Austin, TX wedding I chose Perfect Sky and couldn't be happier with my decision. Sky and his crew were there from the rehearsal to the send off and turned my wedding into a cinematic masterpiece. I cannot say enough about Sky... he is a master at his craft and brings professionalism, integrity and personality into every wedding. His attention to detail is reflected throughout every video (he also did my sisters) and brings a fresh, unique view to videography. If you are on the fence on a videographer... you want an amazing keepsake for you and your future kiddos.. book Perfect Sky!\"\n\n\"Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!! Our wedding was last year, and all that I'm left with are photos and video. Sure, I look at the photos that hang on our walls but when I'm really feeling nostalgic and missing everyone's smiling faces, I have Perfect Sky's AWESOME videos to bring me back in time. Schuyler's sense of humor made it easy to invite him in. He respects privacy but still manages to find those special moments with your parents, family and friends. An eye for detail but a nice concept of reality so your video stays grounded but beautiful. He is very reasonable for his skill and production. We are so thankful we chose Perfect Sky for our big day!!!!\"\n\n\"Schuyler had amazing artistic capability, a kind way of dealing with us (including our 2 children) and working to understand what exactly we wanted out of our day and our video. Wedding day, he was always a step ahead and made the day relaxing and fun. Our video, we saw all the things we wanted, but we also Schuyler's artistic side and experience to shine. We are SO very happy with our video, Schuyler's AMAZING work, and the great service we received. The editing, camera work/angles, music, and completeness were top notch!! Everyone that watched it so far has nothing but great things to say. We highly recommend Perfect Sky.\"\n\n\"Breathtaking! Perfect Sky masterfully captured our wedding memories in a way photos simply cannot… the sights, the sounds, the emotion. My husband and I thoroughly researched and met with numerous videographers before selecting. We found in Schuyler a videographer with proven experience, artistic talent, and importantly, someone that we would feel comfortable with. We are so pleased with our decision as Schuyler far exceeded our expectations. He really took the time to listen and understand our style. Calm, funny, and one step ahead of the rest of us so that he could capture everything. He made my husband and I, as well as our wedding party, feel comfortable in front of the camera…\"\n\n\"Our special day was not complete until we saw the wedding video made my Perfect Sky. Schuyler captivated our wedding in such a wonderful, thoughtful way that we cried more when we watched the video then we did at the ceremony. We couldn't believe all the special moments he was able to get on film. As my family and friends watch the video not only do they sit there in awe at how the video was so well put together, they often comment that they do not remember Schuyler being there. This is a true example of his professionalism. I am so happy with Perfect Sky Productions. Our wedding video is a precious treasure that we will cherish forever. Thank you Schuyler for everything you have done for us.\"\n\n\"Sky did an AMAZING job capturing our special day. We contemplated not hiring a videographer to cut costs, but he worked with us on the price. Looking back, I'm SO glad we didn't cut this from our budget because now we have this wonderful video montage of our wedding that we will forever cherish.\n\nAbout a week after our honeymoon, we were devastated with the loss of my husband's beloved grandmother. Sky rushed to get us video footage - Being able to comfort my grieving husband with footage of his grandmother looking so happy at our wedding is something for which I will be eternally grateful.\"\n\n\"To say we were impressed does not even cover it! We could not ask for a more awesome video to treasure for the rest of our lives. Our wedding planner suggested the number one thing brides regret is not having a wedding video and I totally agree with that now. Our photos turned out fabulous but nothing beats seeing a live video. We had a celebratory breakfast with both our parents to watch the video. My parents and in laws were also excited to each have a copy. You are in the correct business and your hard work is clearly evident. Would highly recommend your team!\"\n\n\"We can't stop raving about Perfect Sky! We had a grand affair featured on the front of the Orlando Sentinel! Our traditional Indian wedding lasted for 5 days and Perfect Sky was there every step of the way! We weren't sure if they’d be able to capture our culture with a true understanding of what every ritual and act meant. Boy were we rewarded! Perfect Sky captured the very essence of each event (total of 9) including the memories of our BIG day! We are proud to say we've been featured in our very own TRUE Bollywood Film! Perfect Sky takes 'learning the culture' seriously and will deliver more than can imagine!\""
