        "text": "Seamless Crowds: Twenty-Four Months of Portraiture” an exhibition dedicated to the series of portraits completed live at pop up events throughout Orlando within the past two years. Each black and white piece of work is a time capsule; having been created at locations within the area, Dawrby draws candid portraits of the audience in the rooms of bars, venues, and event spaces. His overstimulating approach to this desaturated series is by means of a visual riddle, meant to entice the viewer to identify a person which may be overlooked at first glance. The goal in this series is to iconify everyday people with simple linework, emphasizing contrasting features that will make anyone recognizable even in seamless crowds of unfamiliar faces.\n\nThe Familiar Faces collection by Dawrby depicts stylized portraits inspired by the Near Eastern and Ancient Egyptian art technique of “twisted perspective”. These multi-perspective portraits blend contemporary essentialism to identify facial traits, using linework and color to distill elemental profiles. By stimulating the part of the brain that recognizes faces, the fusiform gyrus, the viewer is invited to contemplate the intersection of heritage, abstraction, and modernity. In exploring portraiture, the collection becomes a platform to accentuate people for their effortless facial iconography that is their legacy.\n\nDawrby, formerly known as Anthony Darby, is a New York born/ Florida raised Visual Artist working in Illustration, public art, and graphic design. Inspired by people, history and everyday shenanigans; he exercises his creative juices by experimenting with multiple mediums to convey different messages. Within his journey, his contemporary work has been recognized for its unique yet familiar style that can be as sobering as it is playful. Dawrby is based in Orlando, FL with works having exhibited in The Orlando Museum of Art, Kissimmee City Hall, and Spectrum Art Basel Miami.\n\nThe exhibition is showcasing various paintings completed prior to the start of his residency in France, works created at Chateau Orquevaux, and also pieces post residency.\n\nAll paintings are impressionistic abstracts of fictional landscapes and naturalistic visions from the artist's imagination. Each image was created to engage the interplay of what is seen and what is thought to be seen. The tapestry of colors in each painting are meant to amuse the eye upon a deeper contemplation of the work. By using undefined and uncertain horizons the artist leaves the viewer to individually interpret exactly where the endless skies begin.\n\nThe meaning behind Into Endless Skies reflects the artist's approach toward his work since returning from France, and his renewed dedication to exploring the limitless potential of engaging in service of the arts. It is his exploration of the endless possibilities that living a life filled with creativity can bring.\n\nEnjoy the journey Into Endless Skies.\n\nCentered on themes of resilience, spiritual tradition, and collective consciousness, Durrett's compositions portray an otherworldly beauty while retaining raw emotional resonance. \"Eyedentity\" provides a meditative space to honor wisdom that only confronting trauma and systematic oppression can harvest, all while highlighting the possibilities ahead for emotional and spiritual liberation. Experimenting with various salts from table salt to sea salts to Himalayan salts, Durrett draws parallels to the mineral's symbolic meaning yet obscured labor origins with that of diasporic experiences. The mineral's essence preserves and subtly deepens cultural resilience and wisdom passed down generations.\n\nDurrett invites viewers to trace their own journeys across these healing visual narratives and find a piece of themselves within them. This exhibition has been made possible in part by the Individual Artist grant from United Arts of Central Florida.\n\nCatch the amazing KaoticBlaze live, along with complimentary cocktails!\n\nGet ready to be blown away by the vibrant and captivating artworks of the prolific Australia/Greek/ Kenyan international artist @alexandraspyratos through Going Wild. Take advantage of the chance to immerse yourself in Alexandra's world and experience her bold unique style. Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to witness the magic unfold before your eyes. Mark your calendars and be prepared to go wild!\n\nInfluenced by her colourful background, translating the heat and the exotic beauty of the African wildlife to canvas has become Spyratos’ passion and spiritual goal. Her paintings in rich and textured with variegated gold, copper leaf and pure coloured silver, recreate the physicality of the wild that inspires her.\n\nWith forty-two solo shows behind her (Sydney, Melbourne, Byron Bay, Gold Coast Australia, New York, London, Milan, Miami, Hong Kong, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Greece, Portugal, Spain, Venice, Vienna, Geneva, Zurich), Alexandra continues to expand her creative world, exploring and evolving in her individual contemporary style.\n\nThe Conduit Gallery x Steele Haus is thrilled to present Vanishing Point, a solo exhibition featuring the works of graffiti writer and artist Joel \"@teknyc\" Martinez. With his NYC subway train era graffiti style, Teknyc has brought back the feeling of the old with a refreshing new twist.\n\nAs a graffiti writer Teknyc is a member of the legendary Fame City Crew and has painted murals all over the world, from NYC, Paris, Japan, London, Holland, Dubai, Prague, Berlin, Portugal, Argentina and Brazil. His work has been published in several publications and books \"Burnerz Magazine, Fresh paint NYC, 12oz prophet, Style Kings and Burnerz Magazine.\"\n\nTeknyc hopes to preserve the essence of b-boying and graffiti by keeping the art forms true to their essence while still innovating within the context of these defined art forms.\n\nCome out and catch a vibe with DJ KaoticBlaze, along with complimentary cocktails.\n\nCollectors, artists, and enthusiasts join us at the Conduit Gallery, on August 5th from 6 PM - 8 PM for the opening reception of Windows & Mirrors, an exclusive collection by featured artist @kierra.davvon.\n\nBranker, a Trinidadian-American artist, delves deep into the lived experience and the transformative potential of photography and images. Her work explores the ways in which photographs can activate generational memory, history, and cultural traditions, offering a profound reflection on personal and communal identity.\n\nWindows and Mirrors promises to be a captivating immersive exhibition that invites viewers to engage in a profound exploration of identity, memory, and cultural heritage. Kierra Branker's artistic vision and her ability to convey complex narratives through photography makes this exhibition a must-see event for art enthusiasts and those passionate about the power of visual storytelling.\n\nJoin us for the opening reception of Windows & Mirrors, by Kierra Branker. Come out and catch a vibe with Orlando's favorite DJ, Julio Garcia along with complimentary cocktails."
