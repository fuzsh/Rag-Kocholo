A Toronto native, she is an international athlete advocate who has served on the Executive Committee of the Pan-American Sports Organisation (Panam Sports) for eight years, and currently sits on the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) Athletesâ€™ Commission as the representative from the Americas. She is also a member of the IOC Athlete Charter Steering Committee.\n\nCurrently, Orlando is the Marketing Director for Panam Sports, which includes brand marketing, broadcast, commercial activity and athlete relations.\n\nOrlando is a published author, a motivational speaker and marketing professional.\n\nUsing the unique power of sport to bring people together, the Olympism in Action Forum saw a range of global players, including Olympic Movement stakeholders, athletes, private and public sector leaders, NGO representatives, academics, artists and the media come together to talk on topical contemporary issues. Chosen because of their ability to effect change and their wide range of sometimes differing opinions, the speakers led lively debates and seeked to challenge received wisdom to inspire new ways of thinking."
