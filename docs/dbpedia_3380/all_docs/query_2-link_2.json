        "text": "Hey blogosphere, been a long time! I’ve been studying for my comprehensive exams and honestly miss the feeling of low stakes writing and something I highly recommend doing when one is immersed in a lot of reading. Let’s be honest, PhD students have to do a whole lot of writing after comps (a dissertation or something) and it just makes sense to keep up the habit now.\n\nNonetheless, I’ve been thinking a lot about figure collecting.\n\nI’ve been an avid collector of video game and anime figures for many years now often picking up ones of characters I’ve cosplayed (if available) or of some of my other favourite characters. I’ve even found a community of collectors at my institution since the amiibo craze started. We even recorded a podcast about the state of amiibo collecting and supplies (before the restocks). Now, I’m the type of person that after playing a game, will search online for figures of newly beloved characters. Most recently for me this has been Dragon Age: Inquisition and I was sure to find some figures easily online after all, Mass Effect has several lines of figures including these super adorable bishoujo figures of Shep and Liara:\n\nOr the PlayArts line including everyone’s favourite Garrus:\n\nAlong with these examples are the more “luxurious” statues offered on the Bioware store and a slew of Funkos which are steadily becoming my go-to for cute cheap figures. But despite all this, there seems to be very little in the way of Dragon Age figures that are not pricey statues. This appears to be because the Dragon Age figure license is owned by this company called Titan. Now you are probably wondering how this could be when I just linked you to two non-Titan places that sell Dragon Age figures. My guess is that Titan’s license includes making Funko-like Dragon Age figures but instead of cute large, round headed darlings like this: We get what appears to be made in a factory of demons, hell bent on making every fan recoil in terror and disgust at their products:"
