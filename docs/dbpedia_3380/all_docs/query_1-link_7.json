        "text": "So, a proud mama moment happened today! 🥲 Dropped my son off at University of Southern California for The LEAP Foundation, Inc. Leadership Week. Can't believe he received a full scholarship this year! 🙏🏾 This is his second time at LEAP, but last year's experience at that other campus (you know, the one with all the blue and gold 😉) 🤷🏾♀️ was just...meh. USC's campus and vibe are on another level. Major kudos to LEAP for making the switch! The Trojan spirit is infectious – from the moment you arrive on campus, you feel it. My son's words: \"Mom, this is a much bigger campus, it's like its own city.\" 🤯 If you're a parent looking to invest in your child's future, I can't recommend LEAP enough. Seriously, it was a game-changer for my son. His confidence, drive, and dedication went through the roof! 💯 This program is worth every penny for any parent who wants their child to become a future leader. I highly recommend this immersive program to any parent wanting to equip their child with the leadership skills needed to thrive in the global arena. 🗣️Calling all organizations and leaders: please consider sponsoring LEAP Foundation. They're doing amazing things for our next generation of leaders. We need more programs like this! 🙌🏾 #LEAPFoundation #USCLEAD #LeadershipDevelopment #ProudMama #FutureLeaders #TrojanFamily #FightOn\n\nReflecting on my Warwick Academy days, where I proudly served as a school prefect and embraced the 'goodie goodie' role with straight As and performances at the Premier’s concert on piano and violin. Those were defining moments, ones that shaped my drive for excellence. Confidence intertwined with feeling overwhelmed—my story was a testament to the aspirations of an overzealous mother. Her dreams for an Ivy League future for me fueled my achievements but also led to feeling overstretched. Life post that iconic high school picture wasn't a smooth sail. Failures struck hard, repeatedly. It took time to grasp the distinction between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset—a pivotal realization. Leadership isn't just about accolades; it's about resilience, adaptability, and the willingness to grow. Embracing a growth mindset transformed my path, allowing me to navigate setbacks with newfound strength. “The only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.\" - Michelle Obama Today, I urge you all to reflect on your mindset. Are you fixed or growth-oriented? Embrace the journey of learning and evolution. Let's cultivate a culture of growth for ourselves and those we lead. #LeadershipDevelopment #GrowthMindset #Resilience #ReflectAndGrow #EmbraceChange\n\nOn 11/2 of 2023, I had the chance to attend University of Cincinnati Carl H. Lindner College of Business Alumni Panel which was sponsored by UC’s Sigma Sigma Honorary (which I was tapped into last semester!) During this panel many great insights were shared from: ⭐️ Rob Richardson ⭐️ Richard Thornburgh (who was UC’s mascot in college!) ⭐️ Danielle Lewis Jones, MBA As I sat in my seat that night, I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect but afterward I was inspired, energized, and a bit more open-minded 🤩 So here are a few of my favorite takeaways: Empathy doesn’t equal agreement | We can all agree that empathy is essential to success but in teams we must understand the line between empathy AND agreement 👀 In life our VIEWS may change but our VALUES remain consistent | What values do you choose to live by ❔ Often times media isn’t for education rather entertainment & attention | Think about the ways in which the media you consume makes you feel ❓ History doesn’t repeat itself, but it does rhyme | Often times ideas from the past come to portray themselves in new forms & fashions in the present moment ⚠️ Lastly, is that power doesn’t equal leadership | Just because someone has power or is in charge doesn’t mean they are a leader ‼️ Knowledge is accessible in many mediums and through many platforms but an interactive panel with amazing speakers is one that will always 🔥 me up #fridayvibes #paneldiscussion #trends\n\n#FridayThoughts After a conversation with a colleague from UK Higher Education, I've been reflecting on the nature of success and self-worth in academia. The metrics we often chase [e.g., million-pound awards, the establishment of hubs and institutes, or contributing to the ever-evolving vision statements] can obscure what truly matters. These achievements are fleeting and often subject to the whims of time and policy. What endures is the respect we earn and the support we provide to our team members' life and career development. As academic leaders, our legacy isn’t in the transient accolades but in the lasting impact we have on the people we mentor and work with everyday. It’s crucial to maintain our sanity by focusing on these enduring values, fostering a respectful environment, and being respected in return.\n\nIn 2020, an invitation to join the Beta Gamma Sigma International business honor society felt surreal, considering my non-business background. I embarked on a dual MPH & MBA with a foundation in clinical medicine. ⇥ The only equation I had heard 👂 about business was ✔️ Assets = Liability + Equity 😁 My MBA experience was a steep learning curve at The Johns Hopkins University - Carey Business School. Subjects like accounting and microeconomics were intimidating. ✔️ It necessitated double, sometimes triple, the effort to understand these concepts I made significant trade-offs including spending less time on public health courses to dedicate more time to mastering business concepts. ——————————— Why this history 😒 ❓ ——————————— → My experience underscored a profound lesson. ↓ ✅ True potential is often discovered when we venture beyond our comfort zones. Despite the challenges My commitment to learning and adapting demonstrated that ✅ Excellence is not exclusively the domain of the naturally gifted but is accessible to anyone who approaches their goals with determination and persistence. My invitation to join the international business honor society taught me that ↓⏎ ✅ While finding excuses is easy, achieving excellence requires consistent effort and resilience, even when the odds seem stacked against you. ——————- Let's learn to approach our endeavors with the conviction that through perseverance, we can surpass our limitations and achieve excellence. Happy Sunday #ProfessionalGrowth #Resilience #Achievement #JohnsHopkins #graduateschool\n\n🚀 What an exciting month February has been🚀 1. We've dedicated a significant portion of February to refining our Curriculum and Assessment Framework. It's been fantastic to work closely together drawing inspiration from best practices across the trust and our own experiences. Together, we've crafted an example policy to guide leaders in defining excellence in the classroom and throughout the school. We presented this to leaders on Tuesday & I can't wait to dive into their ones and see the impact they'll have! 2. Feeling incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by fantastic primary science leaders. We've been hard at work codifying our objectives for the upcoming Summer term, culminating in the creation of our Primary go-to guides. These resources, have now been checked and uploaded onto our portal, are poised to elevate the science provision for our primary students. Excited to see the lessons come to life and witness the impact firsthand next term! 3. Our journey at the NPQEL has begun, and the timing couldn't be more perfect. The modules focusing on Implementation have been enlightening, and I'm thrilled to be connecting with fellow leaders. It's inspiring to exchange ideas and experiences, knowing that we're all committed to driving positive change in education. 4. Year 11 support remains a top priority across our secondary schools, and this month it has been on supporting foundation students in achieving a 4-4+. Team Science has been going above and beyond, and I'm hopeful that our efforts will be reflected in the outcomes. Together, we're empowering our students to reach their full potential. Exciting times ahead! Can't wait to see what March has in store. #Education #TeachingAndLearning #LeadershipDevelopment\n\nIt is not enough to be a technical expert. Last night was the first class for the CxO Forum spring semester class at the University of Cincinnati, where I had the pleasure of engaging with a group of 45 talented technology graduate students. Kicking off the session with a discussion on career success, I emphasized a crucial point: \"It is not enough to be a technical expert if you aspire to progress into an IT leadership position.\" In preparation for the class, I reach back into articles and books on career success and leadership. Beginning the class with a powerful quote from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, which asserts that \"85% of your financial success is due to your personality and ability to communicate,\" the class discussed the significance of attributes and activities that require little or no technical skill but are important to career success highlighting communication and networking. What I believe is meaningful for the students is weaving personal stories around nuggets of advice from leadership and career experts, connecting these insights to my own career journey. From successes and failures to pivotal moments and lessons learned, these narratives breathe life into the discussion. As the saying goes, \"if I only knew then what I know now.\" The students are fueled by the curiosity and energy of youth, and we are off to a promising start. I'm eagerly anticipating the upcoming weeks, where we'll delve into more stories from other leaders in the IT community. I am grateful that the Cincinnati IT community has many leaders that are willing to invest some time in the next generation. Here's to those leaders who will join the class and help unlock the attributes of IT leadership beyond technical expertise! #Leadership #CareerSuccess #ITLeadership #CxOForum #PersonalDevelopment #universityofcincinnati #cincinnati #ohio #nextgeneration https://www.uc.edu/\n\n🌍 Happy Earth Day! Today, at the Leder School of Business, we reflect on our responsibility to promote social and environmental sustainability. As we celebrate the beauty and bounty of creation, we are reminded of our mission to nurture and protect it. In my dual roles - both as Dean of Leder and an Au Sable Professor each summer - I've seen firsthand how integrating social justice with environmental stewardship can reshape the future of business education. At King’s, we're not just teaching students how to maximize profits but inspiring leaders to create positive, sustainable impacts that align with our faith-based commitment to care for the Earth. Our business program is designed to challenge students to think critically about their roles in the world, ensuring they're equipped to fulfill the university’s mission and vision and a greater global purpose. Whether through innovative courses, community partnerships, work-integrated learning, or international collaborations, we aim to develop leaders committed to ethical practices and care for the creation. Celebrating Earth Day, let's commit to continuous learning and action toward a sustainable world. How are you making an impact in your community?"
