        "text": "WACO, Texas (KWTX) - The McLennan County Emergency Management announced they issued a county wide burn ban due to extreme heat and insufficient rainfall.\n\nThe ban is effective immediately and is a precautionary measure to protect the community from the increased risk of wildfire. The ban means all open burning is prohibited throughout McLennan County, including within the city limits of Waco.\n\nThe McLennan County Emergency Management says open burning of leaves, brush or other materials are strictly prohibited.\n\nThose who violate the order will be subject to a fine that will be based on the severity of the violation and any resulting damages.\n\nThe McLennan County Emergency Management urges residents to follow the burn ban and to exercise caution.\n\nThe McLennan County Emergency Management shared safety tips to remember during extreme heat including:\n\n• Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if you don’t feel thirsty. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as they can dehydrate you.\n\n• Stay Cool: Limit outdoor activities during peak heat hours, typically between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. When possible, stay indoors in an air-conditioned environment. Use fans and cool compresses to help lower your body temperature.\n\n• Wear Appropriate Clothing: Light-colored, loose-fitting clothing helps keep your body cool. Avoid dark colors that absorb heat.\n\n• Check on Others: Make sure to check on family members, friends, and neighbors, especially the elderly and those with health conditions, to ensure they are coping well with the heat.\n\n• Recognize Heat-Related Illnesses: Be aware of the signs of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which can include heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea, and confusion. If you or someone you know shows symptoms, move to a cooler place and seek medical attention immediately.\n\nThe McLennan County Emergency Management says with these extreme heat conditions, it’s important to take precautions to protect your health and well-being.\n\nFor further information or to report violations, contact the Waco Fire Marshal’s Office at (254) 750-1740."
