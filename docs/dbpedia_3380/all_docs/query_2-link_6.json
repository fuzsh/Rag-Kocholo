        "text": "Answer\n\nCocktail, please! We want you to be comfortable and to enjoy yourself. We will be outdoors for most of the evening, so if it gets a little chilly at night, we recommend you bring a light jacket or shawl. For our ladies attending, you may want to rethink stilettos as there is some uneven ground throughout the castle. Think, Tuscan chic ;)\n\nAnswer\n\nWe love your kids - we really do. But we want our wedding to be your night off!\n\nAnswer\n\nYes, we will be coordinating transportation from the Hotel Plaza Lucchesi close to the city center at 5:00pm the day of the wedding. Please make sure to check our Travel page for more details closer to the big day.\n\nAnswer\n\nTaxis will be available at the venue from 12:00am - 1:30am. There will be a steward at the entrance to help coordinate your travel back to your hotel.\n\nAnswer\n\nWe wanted to gather our absolute closest family and friends to create an intimate atmosphere for our special day. We have personally invited everyone by name, so we would prefer if it was just you!"
