        "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL SPACE FORCE STATION â Despite brushing off the notion previously, NASA officials say they are now evaluating all options for bringing home the crew of the problem-plagued Boeing Starliner from the International Space Station â including the possibility of bringing the two astronauts home on business competitor SpaceXâs Dragon spacecraft.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nNASA officials say they are evaluating all options to get the two Starliner crew members home\n\nThey said sending the astronauts home in a SpaceX Dragon capsule is one option they are considering\n\nBoeing tells Spectrum News it still believes in Starliner; will work with NASA if there is an uncrewed return\n\nGet more space coverage here â¶\n\nDuring the NASA teleconference on Wednesday afternoon, officials stressed that they have a contingency plan for the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission, which saw the companyâs Starliner spacecraft take NASA astronauts Cmdr. Barry âButchâ Wilmore and pilot Sunita âSuniâ Williams to the International Space Station, thanks to United Launch Allianceâs Atlas V rocket.\n\nThe maiden crewed flight of the Starliner has suffered from five small helium leaks and five aft reaction control system thrusters on the service module failed as the spacecraft approached the space station on Thursday, June 6. One of the thrusters was turned off because it was not functioning correctly.\n\n(Scroll down to view an interactive timeline of events)\n\nAs of Wednesday, the crew's approximately 10-day mission has stretched to 63 days, and there is currently a set return time frame for the two.\n\nThe U.S. space agency stated that teams were analyzing the results of a recent space station-docked hot-fire testing of the thrusters and propulsion system of the Starliner spacecraft. The results have not been released, but officials say those results will help determine if the spacecraft is safe to return its crew back to Earth.\n\nBut NASAâs Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich said the issues with Starliner have caused team leaders to come up with a contingency plan to send two crew members on the SpaceX Crew-9 mission and have Wilmore and Williams joining them for the return of Crew-9 in February 2025.\n\nOriginally, the NASA and SpaceXâs Crew-9 mission was set to launch on Sunday, Aug. 18, 2024. But as of Tuesday, the new launch date is no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24.\n\nAnd it was going to include NASAâs Zena Cardman, Nick Hague and Stephanie Wilson, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov as crew members. NASA has not said which two would be cut from the mission if the contingency plan goes forward.\n\nInternational Space Station Program Manager Dana Weigel said the Dragon spacecraft would have to be reconfigured to accommodate the unusual return mission, such as the seating. SpaceX officials said the spacecraft's center of gravity would need to be adjusted.\n\nNASA reached out to SpaceX officials sometime in July to see what the options would look like to use a Dragon to return the Starliner crew, as concerns started to rise following a review of data about the spacecraft's thrusters, Stitch said.\n\nHe said that if Williams and Wilmore return with Crew-9, the Starliner spacecraft will return on its own without a human crew. That would require Starliner to be programmed with a new flight path, and flight controllers would need time to become familiar with the new plan, he said.\n\nKen Bowersox, NASAâs Space Operations Mission Directorate associate administrator, said the odds of an uncrewed Starliner returning have increased.\n\nStitch told Spectrum News that the problems Starliner is experiencing can be fixed.\n\nâI think the path forward for Starliner is to complete the rest of the test flight, to undock. I would like it to undock with a crew but if we don't end up getting there with the entire community, undock, execute the deorbit burn, return home and then make the corrections to the problems that we've found. These problems can be fixed,â he said.\n\nSpectrum News asked about what NASA thought about the future of Starliner, with Stich saying, \"So, I see a bright future for Starliner. Either way, we really need two crew transportation systems. There could be a day in the future where we're calling upon Starliner to do something for us like this and it's a great vehicle it's got great capability. And, you know, Boeing has done a tremendous job working on it in concert with commercial crew and so I really see that there's a viable path for Starliner either way that we go.\"\n\nHe also said that NASA does not need to change the testing requirements of spacecraft to make sure they are flight ready, saying there is no need for it.\n\nDuring a July teleconference, Spectrum News asked NASA officials about the possibility of using a different spacecraft to return the pair of astronauts, only to be told that Starliner would be the only craft used. But in a later July teleconference, officials admitted they were keeping their options on.\n\nMissing from Wednesdayâs teleconference was Mark Nappi, Boeingâs vice president and program manager at the companyâs Commercial Crew Program. He has been a familiar face in many press conferences since the launch attempts of Starliner and afterward.\n\nIn a statement to Spectrum News, Boeing stated, \"CFT is currently a crewed mission, and we still believe in Starlinerâs capability and its flight rationale. If NASA decides to change the mission, we will take the actions necessary to configure Starliner for an uncrewed return.\"\n\nSpaceX has not yet gotten back to Spectrum News with a comment about the announcement.\n\nStarliner mission timeline"
