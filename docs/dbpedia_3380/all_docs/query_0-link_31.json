        "text": "Going into the last year of high school, the thought of getting into college becomes progressively more surreal. Most ‘Early Decisions’ do not come out until at least November, but for seniors Jeremiah Reen, Molly Terraciano, and Alexandra Orlando, lacrosse has paved the path for their future.\n\nPlaying for Pelham teams since the 2nd grade, Alex Orlando has chosen to play Division III Lacrosse at Hamilton College in Clinton, NY. Playing on the Varsity team since freshman year, Orlando is a force to be reckoned with on the field playing mostly defense and midfield. Though she plays for Primetime, a club team based in Westchester, she’s always super fond of the memories she has made with her Pelham team. When asked about her favorite part about playing, Orlando said, “I consider everyone one of my teammates my best friends, which is probably why I love playing the sport so much. Before games, we blast music from the speakers and get super pumped which is something I am definitely going to miss the most”.\n\nThe Girls Lacrosse Team is also sending goalie Molly Terraciano to play Division I lacrosse at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Along with Alex, Terraciano has also been playing lacrosse since 2nd grade. Inspired by her mom who also played at the collegiate level, Molly picked Lafayette because of the ‘winning spirit’ the team displayed when visiting. Though there is a pressure relieved off her shoulders going into senior year, it doesn’t mean Terraciano’s work ethic is anywhere near being diminished. “It has definitely made me a little less stressed, but I still need to keep my grades up and work hard”.\n\nThough he just came to PMHS this year from Iona Prep, Jeremiah Reen grew up in Pelham and is very familiar with his teammates as he has known them since elementary school. Committed to one of the top 10 men’s teams in the nation, Jerry is playing the next level at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Also playing for a nationally ranked club team, 2way, Reen credits much of his success to his father. “He has done so much for me and given me tons of advice. He has sacrificed so much of his life to help me to become a great person and player. I owe everything to him”."
