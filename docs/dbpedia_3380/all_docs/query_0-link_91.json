        "text": "Alexandra Daddario’s super-rare video showed off how cool of a stepmom she is, and how she looks like a glowing Queen as she shows off her baby bump!\n\nOn Aug 4, the White Lotus alum shared a series of videos and photos showing off her family’s day out. She shared the post to her Instagram with the caption reading, “Thanks to the kindest rock stars @imaginedragons!! Such an amazing show.”\n\nMore from SheKnows\n\nAndy Cohen Reveals One Thing That Would Make Him 'Go Absolutely Mental' as a Parent on 'Real Housewives'\n\nIn the first video, we see Daddario dancing and singing to Imagine Dragon’s hit song “Radioactive,” which is really cool when you remember she starred in that song’s music video. She’s sporting a baseball cap and a white button-down, which shows off her growing baby bump!\n\nWe also get a video of Daddario’s stepsons looking at the show on a balcony, followed by pics of the crowd and another of her beloved stepsons. Then, we end the post with a video of a glowing Daddario singing and cheering on the band.\n\nNot only does this show that Daddario is living her best life, and she looks so good in casual maternity wear, but that her growing family clearly loves a good musical night!\n\nFor those who don’t know, Daddario and Andrew Form started dating in 2020, and by June 2022, they were married. Daddario then became the stepmother to Form’s two sons (whom he welcomed with ex-wife Jordana Brewster): Julian, born in 2013, and Rowan, born in 2016.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, Daddario announced that she and Form were expecting a child together, a rainbow baby!\n\n“I’m pregnant and it’s all successful and everything’s healthy,” Daddario said in an interview with Vogue. “I had been pregnant. Then I had a loss. It’s long and complicated, so I don’t want to be too specific. Those kinds of losses and trauma are very hard to explain unless you’ve been through them.”\n\nWe’re so happy to see her thriving!\n\nBefore you go, check out these celebrity parents who welcomed rainbow babies after experiencing pregnancy loss.\n\nBest of SheKnows\n\nThe Latest Royal Baby-Name Inspiration You Need for Your Future Princes & Princesses\n\nLuke Grimes & All the Other Celebrity Pregnancy Announcements of 2024\n\nThese Celebrity Moms Have Gotten Painfully Honest About Breastfeeding"
