        "text": "Foxborough, Mass. (August 6, 2024) â New England Revolution II (4-13-2; 16 pts.) return home to host FC Cincinnati 2 (13-5-2; 41 pts.) in a Wednesday morning matinee at Gillette Stadium. The midweek match kicks off at 11:00 a.m. ET, with James Hadnot calling the action on **MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app**.\n\nNew England heads into the Matchweek 21 contest following a 3-2 loss on the road at Atlanta United 2 on Saturday. Revolution II forward Alex Monis led New Englandâs attacking efforts with a goal-and-assist performance. After Atlanta recorded a three-goal opening half to take a commanding lead at the intermission, New England found its rhythm in the second half to chip back into the match. Forward Liam Butts converted on a chipped pass from Monis to put New England on the scoreboard. Buttsâ tally was his second goal of the 2024 MLS NEXT Pro season.\n\nMonis then found the back of the net in the 69th minute, netting his team-leading seventh goal of the 2024 campaign. The Filipino international converted on an assist from forward Marcos Dias, who leads Revolution II with a team-best five helpers this season. Monis finished the night with five shots, while Butts and Revolution Academy graduate Olger Escobar each collected four shots to round out the attack.\n\nAlongside Escobar, four additional Revolution Academy products featured in last weekendâs contest, with Eric Klein and Colby QuiÃ±ones earning starts, while Malcolm Fry and Gevork Diarbian entered the match as second-half substitutes. Diarbian, a Cranston, R.I. native, and Revolution II captain Patrick Leal, have both appeared in every match for New England this season.\n\nNew England and FC Cincinnati 2 will meet for the third and final time this season, with the Orange-and-Blue holding the all-time series lead at a 3-2-1 record. Cincinnati 2 has held the edge through the first two meetings of the 2024 MLS NEXT Pro campaign, recording a 2-1 win on April 10 and a 1-0 victory on June 30. Cincinnati 2 sits in first place in the Eastern Conference standings, owning a 7-1-1 record over its last nine matches.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH FOR AGAINST FC CINCINNATI 2"
