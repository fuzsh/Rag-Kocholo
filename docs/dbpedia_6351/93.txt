The Dutch Grand Prix returned to the Formula 1 calendar in the 2021 season amidst the rise of home hero, Max Verstappen. F1 first visited the Netherlands in 1952 but left it after 1985.

Formula 1 has visited Circuit Zandvoort for each of the series’ visits to the Netherlands so far in its history. But the track fell off the schedule from 1986 to 2019 as it failed to agree a new contract. F1’s long-sought return was also delayed to 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Ferrari enjoyed lavish success at Zandvoort during the circuit’s original run on the Formula 1 calendar. The Scuderia won eight times at the track with drivers including Alberto Ascari and Niki Lauda. Zandvoort later agreed to make changes to its track to return to the F1 schedule.

History of the F1 Dutch GP

Ascari won the maiden Formula 1 Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort in 1952 as Ferrari secured an all-Italian one-two-three podium finish. The 1952 and 1953 F1 drivers’ champion won in 1953, again from pole position, too. But Maserati denied Ferrari a second podium lock-out.

It was not until Juan Manuel Fangio won in 1955 for Mercedes that a non-Italian driver and team won the Dutch GP as a Formula 1 race. France’s Louis Rosier had won the Dutch GP in 1950 and 1951 driving for Talbot. But the race was not a part of the F1 world championship.

Budgetary issues forced Zandvoort to drop the Dutch GP in 1954 and again across 1956 and 1957. Finances again played a part in why there was not a Dutch GP in 1972 despite it initially making the calendar. But the key reason was that drivers refused to race on safety grounds.

Zandvoort proved to be a dangerous track upon making the Formula 1 calendar and quickly became outdated. The track eventually made an array of improvements to ensure its safety standards were up to scratch. Those changes ensured F1 continued to return through 1985.

Max Verstappen’s rise helped to revive the F1 Dutch GP

Formula 1, eventually, gave the Hungarian GP the spot on its calendar the Dutch GP held for the 1986 season. Circuit Exploitatie Nederlandse Autorensport Vereniging (CENAV) – which owned Zandvoort – hit financial troubles and ultimately went bankrupt at the start of 1986.

It would be 36 years before Formula 1 cars hit Circuit Zandvoort again after Verstappen’s rise helped to revive the Dutch GP. The Hasselt, Belgium-born driver races under a Dutch licence through his ex-F1 driver father, Jos. Verstappen also secured his first F1 drivers’ title in 2021.

Zandvoort, again, agreed to make significant changes to the circuit to secure the Dutch GP’s return to the Formula 1 calendar in 2021. The track had carried out significant work in 1972 to install Armco barriers around the track and added a chicane at the high-speed Bosuit bend.

The 1975 Dutch GP saw James Hunt win his first Formula 1 race driving for Hesketh. He also returned in 1976 to win for McLaren en route to the title. But the Briton would not secure a hat-trick in 1977. Mario Andretti took both drivers out of the race at the 180° Tarzan corner.

Yet after failing to finish due to the ambitious overtake in 1977, Andretti returned in 1978 to win from pole position at Zandvoort. It would be the Italian-American’s last of 12 Grand Prix victories. Yet it also came during the year in which Andretti won his F1 title driving for Lotus.

Zandvoort got creative to bring F1 back to the Netherlands

Tarzan remains one of the key corners at Zandvoort today but the circuit redesigned Turn 1 for Formula 1’s return. The track introduced positive camber to the corner as there is a lack of run-off following the pit straight. The length of the pit straight was also a problem for F1.

Formula 1 likes longer straights to encourage overtaking but Zandvoort’s measured in at just 700 metres. The circuit is also squashed between sand dunes and the local town. So, track manager Niek Oude Luttikhuis got creative adapting the last corner to extend the DRS Zone.

The previous design of Turn 14 would have led to centrifugal forces at the exit that exceeded what F1 specifications allowed. So, Zandvoort installed steep banking akin to Indianapolis. It also increased the banking degrees for Turn 3, Hugenholtz-Bocht, due to its lack of run-off.

What is Circuit Zandvoort like?

Zandvoort is very much a driver’s track but the circuit does not naturally lead to great racing for Formula 1 with the Dutch Grand Prix or for other series. The circuit is very narrow and is single-file for large portions. But the changes to Turns 1, 3 and 14 have helped to improve it.

Drivers can now utilise different lines through the steeped camber of Hugenholtz-Bocht. The racing line is generally along the top outer edge to carry speed throughout the middle of the lap. But drivers can also dive into the dip of Turn 3 and shoot back up to then block the exit.
