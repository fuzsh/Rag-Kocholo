        "text": "\"Hopefully [Lando] can harass Max, ideally get in front of him like he did at Silverstone,\" McLaren CEO Zak Brown told F1.tv. \"Their race pace is awesome, but if Max blinks or they have an issue, then we will see. Knowing Lando as I do, he is going to try and take the lead in Turn 1. If not, he will settle in otherwise, he is a very smart driver.\n\nJames Vowles told F1.tv that the team isn't concerned about Sargeant's crash in Q3 yesterday – the first Q3 appearance of his career – because he was \"starting to push the limit, as he should.\"\n\n\"There's a point, as they say, with his name on it today,\" Vowles said.\n\nThe Red Bull junior driver will make his Formula One grand prix debut with AlphaTauri this weekend, filling in for the injured Daniel Ricciardo.\n\nLawson, 21, has been competing in the Super Formula championship in Japan this season, and he's ranked second with just the doubleheader season finale at Suzuka to go. With Super Formula being on a break, Lawson is set to be the 10th New Zealand driver to compete in a race, the most recent being Brendon Hartley for none other than Toro Rosso (now known as AlphaTauri).\n\nThe Red Bull and AlphaTauri reserve driver has participated in an F1 race weekend before with the Faenza-based team during FP1 at the 2022 Belgian GP weekend.\n\nLawson starts from P20 on Sunday, having had very few laps during practice and qualifying to get a feel for the car.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say the Dutch Grand Prix would not exist without Max Verstappen. He’s become the Netherlands’ biggest sporting superstar since soccer player Johann Cruyff in the 1970s and is well on his way to a third world championship at record-breaking speed.\n\nVerstappen has always led the narrative surrounding the race at Zandvoort. The majority of the 90,000 fans turning up each day come decked in orange. Many of them took the ‘Max Express’ train to the track from Amsterdam. All are eager to see him repeat his victories from pole in 2021 and 2022.\n\nBut a win on Sunday would hold extra significance. It would be Verstappen’s ninth consecutive F1 win, matching the record currently held by Sebastian Vettel, who achieved the feat in 2013. Alberto Ascari also won nine in a row across 1952 and 1953, albeit interrupted by the Indianapolis 500 that he did not enter.\n\nVerstappen has never had much time for harping on records, simply focusing on doing the best job possible and soaking up the glory. Still, it’d be a massive landmark for him to reach, one that would only further speak to this being a domination unlike anything we have seen before in F1. Given how commanding the Red Bull car has been on Sundays this year, it would take something out of the norm for it not to happen and spark a big, big party tomorrow night among the home fans.\n\nTrack position is crucial given how the narrow Circuit Zandvoort limits overtaking opportunities, but passing is not impossible. Banked corners provide avenues for drivers to take different lines and battle.\n\n“Undulating” is a widely-used term to describe the nature of the circuit as the ebbs, flows, and banking creates a rollercoaster-type feel. The twisty track is hard on the tires, so it’s likely safe to expect a multi-stop race like last year’s grand prix (which, granted, featured a late safety car). Precision is required as drivers navigate around the banks and gravel traps that leave little room for error. And with it being a beachside town, sand and dirt will drift onto the track throughout the weekend, creating another obstacle for teams.\n\n“It’s really raw,” F1 Academy driver Abbi Pulling said to F1TV. “It’s motorsport to a T, really.”\n\nAnother question in from our live blog mailbag, this time from C. R.: “How's the mood around Sargeant with his first Q3 appearance marred so early?”\n\nIt was a real mixed bag of a day for Sargeant. He said after the race at Spa that he knew he had areas to clean up and be a bit more consistent to harness more of the raw pace that we’ve seen, especially in qualifying. It looked like that was in full flow through qualifying as he reached Q3 for the first time, only to then crash out early in the final session.\n\nSargeant was honest about his feelings afterward. “The biggest positive for me is delivering laps when I needed to,” he said. “That’s something I've lacked this year, and to be able to do that has been really nice today. But it’s all just shattered by a millimeter mistake.”\n\nThe overriding mood at Williams about Sargeant is still a positive one. The team is definitely feeling good about its chances today, and that goes for both cars. Sargeant has a great chance to get his first points on the board from 10th on the grid. To still have rookie errors more than halfway through a season is not ideal, naturally, but to reach Q3 is a really good step. Sargeant now needs to fully capitalize on that and bring home some points today.\n\nThis is the question I've been asking myself all weekend. Not only has the Dutch Grand Prix got the best paddock coffee of the year (yes, I genuinely rank them; it's gained its own following!) but there is also a stand that makes warm stroopwafels. Lots of people have stopped by to grab one, and I've not had a stroopwafel-less day since arriving in the Netherlands on Wednesday. If that's not living my best life, I don't know what is.\n\nThe paddock here at Zandvoort is quite small. Unlike many of the bigger tracks, the team trucks and garages are in a separate part of the track to the main paddock where the hospitality units are based. It's about a five-minute walk between them, but a recurring sight this weekend has been drivers zooming past on mini-scooters to get from A to B quicker."
