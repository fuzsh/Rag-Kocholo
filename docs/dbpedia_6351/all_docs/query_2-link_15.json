        "text": "It has more victories, poles and titles than any other team, though it has not won an F1 championship since taking the constructors' crown in 2008.\n\nEnzo Ferrari ran Alfa Romeos in grand prix racing before World War Two, then founded his own marque. Competition was a focus from the beginning and Ferrari started winning in F1 before the world championship began in 1950.\n\nThe statistics below include the 1952 and 1953 world championships, which were run to Formula 2 regulations. Ferrari dominated both seasons.\n\nWho has the most Ferrari F1 wins?\n\nWith 238 wins, Ferrari is 56 world championship race victories clear of McLaren in second. Williams is third, with Mercedes fourth.\n\nJose Froilan Gonzalez scored Ferrari's first pole and win at the 1951 British Grand Prix, ending five years of Alfa Romeo domination. Remarkably, 39 drivers have won world championship races for Ferrari, with Charles Leclerc the latest to join the list at the 2019 Belgian GP.\n\nMichael Schumacher has by far the most wins, having taken 72 for Ferrari between 1996 and 2006.\n\nTop 10: Michael Schumacher's top 10 F1 victories\n\nSchumacher also scored more wins in an F1 championship season than any other driver, having taken 13 victories on his way to the 2004 title. This has only been matched by Sebastian Vettel, who achieved the feat for Red Bull in 2013.\n\nWhich Ferrari driver has taken the most F1 pole positions?\n\nFerrari is 73 clear of McLaren when it comes to pole positions, with 228. Again, Williams is third and Mercedes fourth.\n\nSchumacher tops the Ferrari drivers' table from Niki Lauda, who scored all but one of his 24 F1 poles for the Italian team between 1974 and 1977.\n\nExcluding the Indianapolis 500, which ran to different rules, Ferrari took pole for every championship race in 1952, but its highest tally came in 2004. Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello racked up 12 poles from 18 races.\n\nWho has scored the most F1 podiums for Ferrari?\n\nFerrari drivers have finished on the podium 772 times in the world championship, at least one driver appearing in the top three in 584 races. McLaren and Williams are next on both lists, with McLaren having scored 488 podium finishes.\n\nSchumacher again tops this list and has more career podium finishes (155) than any driver except Lewis Hamilton.\n\nRubens Barrichello is second, having been part of the Ross Brawn/Rory Byrne/Jean Todt superteam alongside Schumacher from 2000 until 2005. Despite his sometimes troubled time at Ferrari, Sebastian Vettel is third.\n\nWho has the most F1 fastest laps for Ferrari?\n\nFerrari's tally of 254 fastest laps leaves it 98 clear of second-placed McLaren, with Williams on 133.\n\nBehind the inevitable Schumacher, popular Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen is second on the list. The Finn scored 16 fastest laps during his first stint with the team in 2007-09, then added seven more during his second spell in 2014-18.\n\nThe F2004 provided Ferrari's best season in terms of fastest laps, taking 14 from 18 races with Schumacher and Barrichello. Many of the car's lap records stood for several years.\n\nPLUS: The car so good it shocked Ferrari\n\nWhich driver has made the most F1 starts for Ferrari?\n\nStarts: 999 (correct prior to 2020 Tuscan GP)\n\nAlthough Ferrari did not contest the first world championship race, the 1950 British GP at Silverstone, it has started most of the events since then and is 128 clear of McLaren in second spot.\n\nBehind Schumacher and Raikkonen, Felipe Massa started 62 races for Ferrari prior to his crash in the 2009 Hungarian GP. He contested another 77 for the team after his recovery. Had he not missed eight 2009 races, his Ferrari tally would be 147.\n\nWho is the greatest Ferrari F1 driver?\n\nWhile the statistics indicate (probably correctly) that Schumacher is the greatest Ferrari F1 driver, having scored five drivers' titles with the team during its most successful era, the spots behind are less clear-cut.\n\nIn terms of impact, Lauda must be considered a strong candidate. Along with team manager Luca di Montezemolo and designer Mauro Forghieri, Lauda helped Ferrari out of the doldrums in the mid-1970s. Ferrari narrowly missed out on both titles in 1974, but Lauda was world champion in 1975 and 1977, with Ferrari winning the constructors' crown for three straight years.\n\nJohn Surtees also helped Ferrari recover from a difficult season, winning the 1963 German GP before leading the team to both titles the following year. They might have repeated the feat in 1966 had Surtees not left following a falling put with team manager Eugenio Dragoni.\n\nPLUS: John Surtees' 10 greatest F1 drives ranked\n\nAlberto Ascari was the first Ferrari driver to dominate the world championship. Arguably an equal of the great Juan Manuel Fangio, who won the title with Ferrari in 1956, Ascari won all but one of the points-paying GPs in 1952, missing out in Switzerland because he wasn't there!\n\nHe continued his winning streak into 1953, recording nine consecutive GP victories (six in 1952 and the first three of 1953) and securing his second world drivers' crown.\n\nAutosport 70: The rise and fall of Ferrari's first great champion\n\nIn terms of the greatest drivers who didn't win titles with Ferrari, Gilles Villeneuve put in some remarkable performances, particularly his two 1981 wins with the difficult 126CK, while Fernando Alonso twice (2010 and 2012) nearly took the championship with Ferraris that were not as quick as their rivals.\n\nHow many F1 titles has Ferrari won?\n\nDrivers' titles: 15 (1952-53, 1956, 1958, 1961, 1964, 1975, 1977, 1979, 2000-04, 2007)\n\nConstructors' titles: 16 (1961, 1964, 1975-77, 1979, 1982-83, 1999-2004, 2007-08)\n\nFerrari has more drivers' titles to its name than any other team - 15 to McLaren's 12 - while its constructors' title tally of 16 is seven clear of second-best Williams. McLaren has eight, Lotus seven and Mercedes six.\n\nFerrari racked up three drivers' titles before the constructors' championship was inaugurated in 1958, and lost that first title to Vanwall despite Ferrari's Mike Hawthorn winning the drivers' crown. But its constructors' tally is greater thanks to: Lauda's 1976 German GP crash, which prevented him from taking a near-certain title; the 1982-83 seasons in which Ferrari had competitive cars but no single driver, for different reasons, was able to sustain a championship challenge; the 1999 and 2008 seasons in which a McLaren pilot did enough to win the drivers' crown, but Ferrari won the constructors' contest.\n\nWho was Ferrari's most recent title winner?\n\nFerrari's last drivers' title came with Raikkonen in 2007, when he beat McLaren drivers Hamilton and Alonso by a single point. Massa lost to Hamilton by the same margin the following year, while the closest a Ferrari driver has been since then is Alonso, who lost to Red Bull's Vettel by three in 2012.\n\nThe last constructors' crown came in 2008, when Massa and Raikkonen amassed 172 points, to chief rival McLaren's 151.\n\nEven when not challenging for titles, Ferrari has usually been a race winner. Since it started winning in 1951, Ferrari has only failed to win at least one world championship race on 13 occasions: 1957, 1962, 1965, 1967, 1969, 1973, 1980, 1986, 1991-93, 2014 and 2016.\n\nIts most recent win was the 2019 Singapore GP, when Vettel led Leclerc in a Ferrari 1-2."
