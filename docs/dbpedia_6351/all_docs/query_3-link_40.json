        "text": "What is a Grand Slam F1?\n\nA Grand Slam is an unofficial title awarded to a driver after a race weekend when he or she:\n\nStarts the race from pole position\n\nLeads every racing lap\n\nSets the fastest lap time\n\nWins the Grand Prix\n\nIn short, to achieve a Grand Slam, also known as a Grand Chelem, a driver must be extremely dominant in both qualifying and the race.\n\nF1 Hat-trick\n\nA Grand Slam in Formula 1 is often confused with a Hat-trick. That makes sense, since they do not differ much from each other. For a Hat-trick, the driver must meet the following conditions:\n\nStarting from pole position;\n\nSetting the fastest race lap;\n\nWinning the Grand Prix.\n\nWhat is the difference between a Hat-trick and a Grand Slam?\n\nThe only difference between a Hat-trick and a Grand Slam is that scoring a Hat-trick does not require you to have been in the lead for all race laps.\n\nSo to make it easy: a Grand Slam is always a Hat-trick, but a Hat-trick is not yet a Grand Slam. Easy, right?\n\nDrivers with a Grand Slam to their name\n\nTo this day, only 26 drivers have managed to secure a Grand Slam. The first Formula 1 driver to achieve this feat was Argentinean Juan Manuel Fangio during the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix. Max Verstappen most recently scored a Grand Slam during the Spanish Grand Prix in 2023.\n\nF1 driver with the most Grand Slams\n\nWhen it comes to the most Grand Slams, the record holder is British driver Jim Clark. This Scottish driver claimed the prestigious title a remarkable eight times in just three years.\n\nConsecutive Grand Slams in Formula 1\n\nOnly Alberto Ascari, Jim Clark, and Sebastian Vettel have managed to score a Grand Slam in two consecutive race weekends. This occurred during the following events:\n\nGerman Grand Prix and Dutch Grand Prix (Ascari, 1952)\n\nDutch Grand Prix and French Grand Prix (Clark, 1963)\n\nSingapore Grand Prix and Korean Grand Prix (Vettel, 2013)."
