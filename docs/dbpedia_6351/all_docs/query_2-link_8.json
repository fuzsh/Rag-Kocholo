        "text": "In 1953, Alberto Ascari (Ferrari) won the first ever Argentine Grand Prix from pole, with fastest lap (picture above). Due to President Juan Perón decision to allow free access to the circuit, there was an excessive number of spectators, all wanting to cheer for their hero, local boy Juan Manuel Fangio, and they lined the […]\n\nMaurice Trintignant seems to struggle in his blue Gordini 16 (picture-above) at the 1953 French Grand Prix held on the fast Reims-Gueux circuit. Having not set a lap in practice, he started from the back, but was forced to retire on lap 14 with a broken transmission. The race was won by Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari), […]\n\nWe think of the usual pictures taken at the swimming pool in Monaco, but Jean-Pierre Jarier did just that, along the wall in Long Beach in 1981, (picture above), at the wheel of the Talbot-Ligier JS17, when he replaced Jean-Pierre Jabouille, still recovering from his accident in Canada, the year before. Less known is this […]\n\nThe Carrera Panamericana was a border-to-border sedan rallye event on open roads in Mexico, similar in concept to the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio in Italy. Running for five consecutive years, from 1950 to 1954, it was widely considered to be the most dangerous race of any type in the world. Picture above: French ace […]\n\nIn 1950, Jacques Swaters (picture above)), Paul Frère and André Pilette established Écurie Belgique, a banner in which they prepared cars for themselves and other Belgian racers, both in Grand Prix and sports car racing. Swaters (1926-2010) himself, raced a yellow Talbot-Lago in several events, including two World Championship events, the 1951 German and Italian […]\n\nHappy 102nd birthday to the world’s oldest living F1 driver, Kenneth McAlpine. Born into the British McAlpine civil engineering giant, he started seven Grand Prix in the ’50s for Connaught, which team he eventually financed. Picture above: en route to 13th in his Connaught Type-A at the Nürburgring in 1953.\n\nTwo confident Argentinians, Juan Manuel Fangio and José Froilán Gonzalez, seem ready for the battle, in their Maserati A6, at the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps (picture above). Fangio started the race from pole position (2 seconds faster than Ascari and González), but was forced to retire on lap 13 with a broken engine, […]\n\nThe 38th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday, May 31, 1954. American Bill Vukovich won the legendary race for the second consecutive time (picture above). Bill Vukovich had to work much harder in this race due to his car, a Kurtis Kraft Offenhauser, was now two years old. His team […]\n\nThe 1953 French Grand Prix was held at Reims-Gueux. It was race 5 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers, which was run to Formula 2 rules in 1952 and 1953, rather than the Formula One regulations normally used. It is popularly known as ‘The race of the Century’ because of the sixty […]\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio, born on this day, 24 June 1911 in Balcarce, Argentina and nicknamed El Maestro, was an Argentine race car driver. He dominated the first decade of Formula One racing, in the 50s, winning the World Drivers’ Championship five times. Fangio once said: “You need great passion, because everything you do with great […]"
