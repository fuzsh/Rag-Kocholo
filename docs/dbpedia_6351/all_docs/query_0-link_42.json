        "text": "Summer break is over and we are back with our Tech magazine. You can read an extract of my articles about Red Bull Racing & Red Bull Technology and Scuderia Ferrari written with Fulvio Conti. Red Bull: ''The same difficulties that Perez has experienced this weekend at Zandvoort are probably the same as those experienced by Max Verstappen. But what really made the difference was the way that they approached the weekend. Verstappen, who is for sure in a state of grace right now, is well aware of what his means are''. Ferrari: ''At Zandvoort, Ferrari decided to use a medium load spoilers, but on this track it is required a high load. This choice leads to the tires being torn apart. Firstly, when entering the corner you do not have enough load to be able to turn the car and make it enter correctly into the corner. As a result of this the front tires overheat''. #Tech #Ferrari #RedBull #DutchGP #Formula1\n\nAnddd another article for LastWordOnSports.com is outt! In the race in Austria with #GeorgeRussell's victory, #Mercedes confirmed its position as the third force, overtaking #Ferrari. Here's a preview: \"But what was a bit destabilizing was the step backwards taken by Ferrari in qualifying. It’s no longer a question of tyre management or temperatures. The problem is that there is no performance and with the updates, problems from two years ago have returned. That is the return of bouncing in high-speed corners. In interviews, the pilots spoke of an increase in load but a limited setup. This will lead the Maranello technicians to have to review the mechanical part to avoid lifting the car. Comparing Austria 2023 and 2024, Ferrari lost the pole last year by 48 thousandths of a second while this year the gap was half a second on a short track.\" Click the link below to read the full article: #F1 #motorsport #GeorgeRussell #LewisHamilton #ScuderiaFerrari #CharlesLeclerc #CarlosSainz #motorsport #FIA #formulaone https://lnkd.in/dxqpVAPU\n\nThoughts from the first morning of F1 Testing 2024 While it was may be a case as of 'as you were' in the driver market, with, for the first time in history, a completely unchanged driver line-up for all ten teams, thankfully there's plenty of change going in terms of the cars. Red Bull Racing & Red Bull Technology have switched to a Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team style zero sidepod approach, whilst Mercedes gone the other way and fully-adopted the Red Bull ramped sidepod. However, unlike Mercedes, Red Bull seem to have been able to make the layout work, having eliminated the compromised seating position which caused Lewis Hamilton so many problems in 2023 - intriguing! We also have plenty of new terminology to sink our teeth into, some highlights, which you'll no doubt hear all about when the season starts are The Overbite, Bunny Rabbit Ears (answers on a postcard as to what they are) and the snappily named Shark Inlet. As we've come to expect in #F1 in recent years, the Quality standards are simply unbelievable, given that many of the cars are almost completely new - Ferrari recon that 90% of the components are brand new - and yet there have been zero red flags and just one stoppage on track! From an Engineering point of view that is just staggering. In terms of lap times, with the usual caveat that testing times are largely meaningless, never-the-less Red Bull, Ferrari and Aston Martin dominate the times so far. Aesthetically the colour green is the star of the show, with Sauber's bold new colour scheme in full effect and lashings of green flow-vis paint adorning the majority of the cars. What is flow-vis I hear your cry? Well, essentially it is a low-tech Aero solution, essentially slapping paint onto the aero surfaces and watching how it spreads when the car is at speed. They say that Red Bull's Adrian Newey has the ability to visualise the same effect just by looking at an aerodynamic surface! If true, perhaps this provides a clue as to why Red Bull continue to be the team to beat going into 2024, although as the teams converge as the regulations remain largely stable, we can expect the competition will be much tighter this year than last. But as ever in F1, only the times will tell. #qualityengineering #motorsportjobs #automotivejobs #qualityassurancejobs #f1 Cubiq Recruitment\n\nAston Martin DB3S (1953) The Aston Martin DB3S, introduced in 1953, was designed specifically for racing. This car had a lightweight body and a powerful engine, which provided it with excellent racing performance. The DB3S successfully competed in the L-Man and Sebring races, cementing its reputation as one of the best racing cars of its time. Talbot-Lago T150C (1937) The Talbot-Lago T150C, introduced in 1937, became a racetrack icon thanks to its aerodynamic design and powerful engine. This car won victories in prestigious races such as the Mille Miglia and the French Grand Prix, proving its supremacy in the world of motorsport. Conclusion Antique cars have left an indelible mark in the history of motorsport. Not only were these cars cutting edge for their time, but they continue to inspire modern engineers and car enthusiasts. The racing achievements of such legendary cars as the Mercedes 35 HP, Bugatti Type 35, and Ferrari 250 GTO are prime examples of how innovation and passion for speed can create true masterpieces of the automotive world. #astonmartin #db3s #racinglegend #vintagecars #motorsport"
