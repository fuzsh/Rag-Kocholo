        "text": "The 1953 Swiss Grand Prix was the eighth race of the 1953 Formula One Season, held at the Circuit Bremgarten, Berne, on August 23, 1952. Alberto Ascari led a Ferrari 1-2-3, ahead of Giuseppe Farina and Mike Hawthorn.\n\nBackground[]\n\nAlthough Alberto Ascari had dominated the pace at the Nürburgring, he had failed to take the victory and therefore failed to take the World Championship victory. However Ascari appeared set to take the world title if neither his teammates, Mike Hawthorn or Giuseppe Farina were to win the final two races consecutively.\n\nHawthorn and Farina had been the only drivers' to manage to steal a victory from Ascari in 1953 and therefore remained the only two drivers' whom could potentially beat Ascari.\n\nHaving failed to win at the Nürburgring, the Maserati drivers' had lost their opportunity to take victory in the world title. José Froilán González whom was still recovering from his injuries in Portugal would be replaced by Hermann Lang, the disputed 1939 European Championship victor. The pre-war veteran whilst now at the late age of 45 was being considered for one of the works Mercedes drives for the follwing season.\n\nGordini had enjoyed success in the prelude to the Swiss Grand Prix when Maurice Trintignant had taken victory at the non-championship Sables d'Olonne Grand Prix. There was a slight change in their driver line-up for Bremgarten. Harry Schell had opted to compete in a sportscar event at Goodwood instead of the Grand Prix and therefore Gordini recalled Fred Wacker to partner Trintignant and Jean Behra in the French team.\n\nLike Schell, Peter Collins of HWM would also miss the Swiss Grand Prix for the Goodwood sportscar event. Paul Frère would therefore substitute his place in the team to race alongside Lance Macklin. HWM had also loaned out a car to Albert Scherrer, a wealthy Swiss driver whom was better known in Hillclimb racing.\n\nThe only other Swiss driver for the race was Baron Emmanuel de Graffenried in his privately entered Maserati. The other privateers included Ecurie Espadon which entered a Ferrari 500 for Peter Hirt and a Ferrari 166 for Max de Terra. Ecurie Francorchamps entered their Ferrari 500 for Jacques Swaters whilst Louis Rosier also entered a Ferrari 500 for his own racing team. Ken Wharton entered a Cooper whilst Élie Bayol and Louis Chiron continued to persevere with the troublesome OSCA.\n\nThe championship would come down to a showdown between Ascari, Farina and Hawthorn for the title at Bremgarten. Farina and Hawthorn needed to win the race to keep the championship going into the final race at Monza.\n\nFarina had previously been strong at this circuit. Having won the race in 1950, Farina was also set for another win in 1952, leading every lap of the race before his car failed him. Hawthorn meanwhile was making his first visit to the Bremgarten circuit.\n\nThe championship could however be claimed for Ascari if neither of these two drivers managed to win the race. Ascari had missed the previous year's race for his ill-fated Indianapolis 500 attempt. Having been forced to miss the race, Switzerland was the race on the European races that Ascari did not totally dominate.\n\nNonetheless, Ascari had been previously fortuitous on the circuit having won the race for Ferrari in 1949. Whilst Farina and Hawthorn remained his final threats, Ascari remained well poised to take the title. It would be a difficult task for Farina or Hawthorn to take the victory as throughout the season it had primarily been the Maserati's and Juan Manuel Fangio that appeared set to challenge Ascari.\n\nFangio whom had won the Swiss Grand Prix in 1951 was still hunting for Maserati's first championship victory in the season. If Fangio or any of the rest of the field were able to win the final two races then the championship would be decided in favour of Ascari.\n\nEntry list[]\n\nThe full entry list for the 1953 Swiss Grand Prix is outlined below:\n\nNo. Driver Entrant Constructor Chassis Engine Model Tyre 2 Jacques Swaters Ecurie Francorchamps Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 E 4 Chico Landi Escuderia Bandeirantes Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 6 Jean Behra Equipe Gordini Gordini Type 16 Gordini 20 2.0 L6 E 8 Maurice Trintignant Equipe Gordini Gordini Type 16 Gordini 20 2.0 L6 E 10 Louis Rosier Ecurie Rosier Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 E 12 Louis Chiron Louis Chiron OSCA 20 OSCA 2000 2.0 L6 P 14 Paul Frère HW Motors HWM 53 Alta Alta GP 2.5 L4 D 16 Lance Macklin HW Motors HWM 53 Alta Alta GP 2.5 L4 D 18 Albert Scherrer HW Motors HWM 53 Alta Alta GP 2.5 L4 D 20 Ken Wharton Ken Wharton Cooper T23 Bristol BS1 2.0 L6 D 22 Élie Bayol OSCA Automobili OSCA 20 OSCA 2000 2.0 L6 P 24 Giuseppe Farina Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 P 26 Mike Hawthorn Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 P 28 Luigi Villoresi Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 P 30 Felice Bonetto Officine Alfieri Maserati Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 32 Juan Manuel Fangio Officine Alfieri Maserati Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 34 Hermann Lang Officine Alfieri Maserati Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 36 Onofre Marimón Officine Alfieri Maserati Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 38 Peter Hirt Ecurie Espadon Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 P 40 Max de Terra Ecurie Espadon Ferrari 166C Ferrari 125 1.5 V12 P 42 Toulo de Graffenried Emmanuel de Graffenried Maserati A6GCM Maserati A6 2.0 L6 P 44 Fred Wacker Equipe Gordini Gordini Type 16 Gordini 20 2.0 L6 E 46 Alberto Ascari Scuderia Ferrari Ferrari 500 Ferrari 500 2.0 L4 P\n\nQualifying[]\n\nPractice would take place at Bremgarten in the unique evening practice sessions throughout the Friday and Saturday of the race weekend. There was a minor controversy surrounding the field when the race officials allocated Ascari with a race number for the weekend that was different to the official entry list.\n\nThe first practice session was held under good conditions to which it was described as \"fine and sunny\". There was continued criticism of the current Formula Two regulations. It was lamented that \"gone are the days when cars were fast enough to get into difficulties.\" The drivers' easily taking sections of the track in flat out power to which the cars in the Formula One era would have taken the cars \"to the limit of adhesion\" in the more powerful older cars.\n\nIn the qualifying battle it seemed to be a direct fight between Ascari and Fangio. Fangio was able to put in some magnificent flying laps to which he claimed Maserati's first pole position since his pole at the Belgian Grand Prix. Fangio had blitzed Ascari's best time, going six tenths faster than the Ferrari leader.\n\nFarina was doing his best to keep in the game, however his wild laps saw him described as \"never taking the same line twice\". At the end of the first day he was third fastest and was 2.5 seconds behind Fangio whom was topping the timesheets.\n\nHawthorn, however had an even more difficult time. Having been described as being unwell in arriving to the circuit, he failed to impress on the first day to which he could only manage a frustrating seventh on the grid. Hawthorn was behind teammate Villoresi whom had been described as \"not outstanding\" throughout the day.\n\nAlso ahead of Hawthorn was Marimón's Maserati to whom was described as getting \"lock to lock bounce\" through the corners. Trintignant meanwhile had put in another outstanding for Gordini putting his car fourth on the grid ahead of two Ferrari's and a Maserati.\n\nThese times would be set to determine the grid when the Saturday practice session was washed out with rain in the evening. Ascari now set for second on the grid conducted a number of laps in his spare car. It appeared Ascari remained the favoured man in Ferrari to which he had been befitted a spare car before taking teammate and title rival, Hawthorn's car for a run late in the session.\n\nHaving had his car returned to him, Hawthorn returned to track to which he set the fastest time of the session in which he went 0.1 seconds faster than the time Ascari had set in his own car. Whilst Hawthorn and Ascari had mastered the wet conditions, Fangio whom was set for pole was more cautious in the conditions.\n\nHis new teammate in Lang was having some difficulty in getting his Maserati up to speed in the conditions. Fangio thereafter commandeered his car as befit the team leader to which he immediately set a time for the car that was 2.5 seconds faster than Lang had managed. Nonetheless, the time was still 6.5 seconds slower than the time he had managed in his own race car.\n\nQualifying Results[]\n\nPos No Driver Constructor Time Gap 1 32 Juan Manuel Fangio Maserati 2:40.1 — 2 46 Alberto Ascari Ferrari 2:40.7 + 0.6 3 24 Nino Farina Ferrari 2:42.6 + 2.5 4 8 Maurice Trintignant Gordini 2:43.8 + 3.7 5 36 Onofre Marimón Maserati 2:44.5 + 4.4 6 28 Luigi Villoresi Ferrari 2:44.6 + 4.5 7 26 Mike Hawthorn Ferrari 2:48.1 + 8.0 8 42 Toulo de Graffenried Maserati 2:49.9 + 9.8 9 20 Ken Wharton Cooper-Bristol 2:51.5 + 11.4 10 30 Felice Bonetto Maserati 2:52.0 + 11.9 11 34 Hermann Lang Maserati 2:54.8 + 14.7 12 6 Jean Behra Gordini 2:55.0 + 14.9 13 2 Jacques Swaters Ferrari 2:55.1 + 15.0 14 10 Louis Rosier Ferrari 2:55.4 + 15.3 15 16 Lance Macklin HWM-Alta 2:57.1 + 17.0 16 14 Paul Frère HWM-Alta 2:57.9 + 17.8 17 38 Peter Hirt Ferrari 3:01.5 + 21.4 18 18 Albert Scherrer HWM-Alta 3:07.4 + 27.3 19 40 Max de Terra Ferrari 3:21.1 + 41.0 20 4 Chico Landi Maserati 3:29.1 + 49.0 DNA 12 Louis Chiron OSCA No time — DNA 22 Élie Bayol OSCA No time — DNA 44 Fred Wacker Gordini No time —\n\nGrid[]\n\nPos Pos Pos Driver Driver Driver ______________ ______________ 1 ______________ 2 Juan Manuel Fangio 3 Alberto Ascari Giuseppe Farina ______________ ______________ 4 5 Maurice Trintignant Onofre Marimón ______________ ______________ 6 ______________ 7 Luigi Villoresi 8 Mike Hawthorn Toulo de Graffenried ______________ ______________ 9 10 Ken Wharton Felice Bonetto ______________ ______________ 11 ______________ 12 Hermann Lang 13 Jean Behra Jacques Swaters ______________ ______________ 14 15 Louis Rosier Lance Macklin ______________ ______________ 16 ______________ 17 Paul Frère 18 Peter Hirt Albert Scherrer ______________ ______________ 19 20 Max de Terra Chico Landi\n\nRace[]\n\nResults[]\n\nPos.
