        "text": "Biography\n\nStirling Moss Biography\n\nSir Stirling Moss, born on September 17, 1929, in London, England, was a British racing legend who enjoyed an illustrious career in the world of motorsports. This British race legend is called the greatest driver that never won a world championship. Moss drove 7 seasons in Formula 1 and won 16 races.\n\nStirling is a son of a dentist who was an amateur race driver and finished P16 in the 1924 Indianapolis 500. Moss was educated well by several schools. When he told his father he wanted to be a racing driver he told him that he only was allowed to race if he wear a crash helmet. In those days racers used cloth helmets.\n\nDespite never winning a Formula 1 World Championship, Moss is widely regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport.\n\nMoss began his racing career in 1948, competing in various categories such as Formula 3, sports cars, and touring cars. His talent and skill quickly caught the attention of motorsport enthusiasts and, by 1951, he had made his debut in Formula 1 racing with HWM (Hersham and Walton Motors). Moss's first F1 victory came in 1955 at the British Grand Prix, driving for Mercedes-Benz. Throughout his career, he raced for several top teams, including Maserati, Vanwall, and Lotus. [Internal link hint: Stirling Moss's F1 teams and career highlights]\n\nAlthough Moss never won a World Championship, he achieved 16 Grand Prix wins and finished as the runner-up in the drivers' standings four times (1955-1958). Additionally, he won numerous non-championship F1 races and claimed victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1956. His versatility as a driver was evident in his success across different racing categories, including the famous 1955 Mille Miglia road race in Italy, where he set a record time that remains unbeaten.\n\nMoss's racing career came to an abrupt end in 1962 when he was involved in a severe crash at Goodwood Circuit during the Glover Trophy race. He sustained life-threatening injuries and was in a coma for a month. Although he eventually recovered and attempted a comeback, Moss decided to retire from professional racing in 1963, realizing he could no longer perform at his previous level.\n\nAfter his retirement, Moss remained active in the motorsports community as a commentator, journalist, and ambassador for the sport. He also participated in various historic racing events, delighting fans with his skill and charisma. In 2000, Moss was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to motorsports, and in 2006, he was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame.\n\nSir Stirling Moss passed away on April 12, 2020, at the age of 90, leaving behind a remarkable legacy in the world of motorsports. His incredible talent, sportsmanship, and determination continue to inspire generations of racing drivers and fans alike."
