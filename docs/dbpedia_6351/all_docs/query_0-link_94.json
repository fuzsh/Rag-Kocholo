RAM competed in the 1978-1982 seasons powered by Cosworth DFV V8 and 1.5 Cosworth BD Turbo engines.)\n\n- F1 teams that used non-turbocharged naturally aspirated engines were from 1980 onwards permitted a capacity increase from 3-litres to 3.5-litres later 4-litres from 1985 for V8s, with V10s and V12s remaining at 3.5-litres in the post-turbo era.\n\n- Stefan Johansson winning the 1987 German Grand Prix for McLaren (and later in an Onyx-Ford at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix)\n\n- Audi entering F1 in 1985 with a 5-cylinder turbo later a 3.5 V10 from 1989 that proved to be fairly unsuccessful yet not disastrous until 1990\n\n- After Osella switched to using Motori Moderni V6 turbos from 1985-1988, Minardi ended up being powered by Alfa Romeo engines from a 1.5 V8 turbo in 1985 to a 1.5 4-cylinder twin-turbo from 1986-1988 with Minardi establishing a two car team on its debut season with drivers Pierluigi Martini and Alessandro Nannini being teammates from 1985-1987.\n\n- Teo Fabi winning the 1985 German Grand Prix from Pole driving a Toleman-Hart\n\n- Keke Rosberg winning his last 2 races at the 1986 Canadian Grand Prix and 1986 French Grand Prix driving a McLaren-TAG\n\n- Johnny Dumfries winning his first and only race at the 1986 Hungarian Grand Prix driving a Lotus-Renault\n\n- Alan Jones and Patrick Tambay would finish in 1st and 2nd at the 1986 Austrian Grand Prix driving a Lola-Ford for Team Haas / Haas Lola and also the first win for the turbocharged Ford TEC V6 Turbo, Team Haas / Haas Lola would race in 1987 with an Adrien Newey designed car powered by a Ford V6 Turbo that produced competitive results (and would continue to use the Ford V6 Turbo in the 1988 season then later use the Ford DFR V8 and customer Ford HB V8 in its final five seasons until 1994 when it used Hart V10s it their final two seasons)\n\n- Thierry Boutsen wins the 1987 Australian Grand Prix for Benetton (in front of Jonathan Palmer’s Tyrrell-Ford as well as Roberto Moreno’s AGS-Ford – the latter subsequently meriting to race for more competitive F1 teams) and the 2nd victory for the Turbocharged Ford TEC V6 engine (with teammate Teo Fabi finishing 2nd behind Nigel Mansell at the 1987 Austrian Grand Prix)\n\n- Nigel Mansell beating Nelson Piquet in 1987 to become Champion\n\n- Ayrton Senna winning the 1988 Italian and Australian Grand Prix meaning McLaren wins every race that season\n\n- Gabriele Tarquini scoring the Coloni team’s only point at the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix by finishing 6th in a Coloni-Ford (and later finishing 6th driving an AGS-Ford at the 1991 United States Grand Prix)\n\n- Maurício Gugelmin winning the 1989 Brazilian Grand Prix in a March-Judd (followed by Derek Warwick in 2nd driving an Arrows-Ford and Ferrari’s Nigel Mansell in 3rd)\n\n- Stefano Modena winning the 1989 Monaco Grand Prix in a Brabham Judd (and later at the 1991 Canadian Grand Prix in a Tyrrell-Honda.

wins the 1989 French Grand Prix as well as the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix driving a Tyrrell-Ford the latter being notable for being the last victory of the Ford Cosworth DFV-to-DFR-powered naturally aspirated engines (with Larrousse team’s Lola-Ford picking up the last podium in the 1991 season) that unlike the real-world were slightly more competitive against the Turbo-powered Teams (mainly because the Tyrrell team’s exploit from 1984 remained undiscovered despite Tyrrell and a few others having to wait until 1985 before receiving the recently introduced 3.5-litre or 4-litre Cosworth DFZ V8 engines)\n\n- Reynard makes its F1 debut in 1989 initially powered by a 4.0 Mugen-Honda V8 for the first few seasons before switching to a Mitsubishi-badged V12 from 1992 (essentially a 3.5 V12 HKS

disowned by Subaru and dropped by Coloni mid-season, Andrea Moda ended up being banned for bringing the sport into disrepute before the 2nd to last race of the season though the team would later

before in 1984) would continue to use Yamaha engines for its final season in 1992 despite plans to use a 3.5 Alfa Romeo V10 alongside Alfa Romeo (also in its final season withdrawing as a constructor from F1 in 1990 instead of 1985 that from 1987-1988 produced an alternate successful 1.5 Alfa Romeo 415T 4-cylinder twin-turbo engine that was also supplied to Minardi prior to being replaced by the 3.5 Alfa Romeo V10 from 1989) as well as the Rial and Dallara teams (previously used by the EuroBrun and Coloni teams in the 1989 season)\n\n- Ivan Capelli won Leyton House-Judd’s (aka March-Judd) only GP at the 1990 French Grand Prix\n\n- Aguri Suzuki winning the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix in his Larrousse-Lamborghini becoming the second Japanese driver to win a race and notable for being the

season (acquiring it from De Tomaso until the end of the 1994 F1 season) instead of supplying engines to Footwork / Arrows with the disastrous Porsche 3.5 V12 (also known unofficially as the Onyx-Porsche V12) replaced in the 1992 with the much more competitive Porsche 3.5 V10 (or Onyx-Porsche V10 with the V10 later forming the basis of engines found in the competitive 1999-2000 Porsche LMP2000 Le Mans prototype and Porsche Carrera GT supercar)\n\n- Footwork / Arrows in turn had much more competitive 1990 and 1991 F1 seasons using a customer Ford HB V8 (a specification behind the de facto works Benetton team) instead of the Porsche V12 as in the real-world with Michele Alboreto winning the 1991 Italian Grand Prix driving a Footwork/Arrows-Ford as well as finishing 2nd in the 1991 Belgium Grand Prix and teammate Alex Caffi finishing 2nd in both the 1991 Monaco and 1991 Hungarian Grand Prix’s\n\n- Pierluigi Martini somehow managing to beat Ayrton Senna to win Minardi’s first and only GP at the 1991 Portuguese Grand Prix (until Sebastian Vettel won the 2008 Italian Grand Prix for Minardi Toro Rosso), which that since its F1 debut has notably managed to score at least one point per season.\n\n- JJ Lehto winning his first and Scuderia Italia’s 2nd victory at the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix in a Dallara-Judd (with the team’s first win being by Andrea De Cesaris at the 1989

first two races driving an unexpectedly competitive Brabham-Isuzu 3.5 V12 at the 1992 Brazilian Grand Prix and 1992 San Marino Grand Prix with teammate Damon Hill gaining his first points on his debut Grand Prix season as well as regularly finishing races (while engine supplier Isuzu would be renamed Chevrolet nearly 2 far less successful seasons later with the Brabham team using a competitive yet somewhat unreliable 750 + hp 3.5 Lamborghini V12 during the 1994 season driven by drivers David Brabham and Gary Brabham who began racing together from 1993)\n\n- TOM’S would make its F1 debut in 1994

Martin Brundle winning the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix\n\n- Luca Badoer winning his first and only point in the 1993 San Marino Grand Prix driving a Scuderia Italia Lola-Ferrari to 6th place (Lola would
