        "text": "Team name: Scuderia Ferrari Founding year: 1929 Factory location: Maranello, Italy Team principal: Frederic Vasseur Drivers: Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz Chassis SF-24\n\nScuderia Ferrari are the only team to contest every Formula 1 season since the 1950 maiden campaign. They have also won 16 constructors’ and 15 drivers’ titles to date.\n\nThe team are even the pride of a country with the whole of Italy backing the Prancing Horse from the house of Enzo Ferrari. He founded the team as a humble dream to compete with a crew of amateur racers. Yet Ferrari grew into the most successful Formula 1 team of all time.\n\nFerrari and F1 are inseparable as one is not the same without the other. From the era of the Scuderia triumphing with Alberto Ascari to the dominance of Michael Schumacher, their red paint is ingrained in the pinnacle of motorsport even despite their frequent threats to leave.\n\nScuderia Ferrari team name\n\nThe team’s name simply emanates from their founder, Enzo Ferrari, along with the addition of Scuderia to form Ferrari Stables in English. Ferrari is still a very common surname in Italy as it has routes in the word ferraro, meaning blacksmith, making it akin to Smith in England.\n\nScuderia Ferrari founding year\n\nEnzo Ferrari founded the original team after his family’s name when he set about designing the racing division of Alfa Romeo in 1929. But Ferrari as the team are today originated after World War II as Enzo sought to leave behind the world of wartime machine tool production.\n\nMORE F1 STORIES\n\nAlfa Romeo had also sacked Enzo from its racing division when the manufacturer took over the set-up in 1939. The Italian brand even prohibited Enzo from racing under his own name for the next four years. Yet Enzo continued to fuel his passion for motorsport through WW2.\n\nEnzo, ultimately, opened his own factory in Maranello, and Ferrari later hired most of his old Alfa Romeo team once the war finished. The new Scuderia Ferrari also won their first race at the Rome GP with the 125 S following on from its debut at the Piacenza Circuit in May 1947.\n\nScuderia Ferrari current team principal\n\nScuderia Ferrari appointed Frederic Vasseur as their latest team principal to replace Mattia Binotto from January 2023. The Frenchman moved to Maranello after acting as the CEO of Sauber for six years. Vasseur had also previously ran Renault F1’s team and ART Grand Prix.\n\nScuderia Ferrari current drivers\n\nFerrari currently employ Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz as their permanent race drivers in Formula 1. Leclerc joined the Scuderia in 2019 after just one season in Formula 1 at Sauber. While Sainz quit McLaren for the Prancing Horse in 2021 but he will leave Ferrari after 2024.\n\nSeven-time F1 drivers’ champion, Lewis Hamilton, triggered an escape clause in his contract with Mercedes in February 2024 to sign a multi-year deal with Ferrari. Sainz was already out of contract at the Scuderia beyond the 2024 season to leave a vacancy for Hamilton in 2025.\n\nWhat F1 engine do Scuderia Ferrari use?\n\nScuderia Ferrari produce their own Formula 1 engines, and also supply power units for Haas and Sauber among the 2024 grid. Ferrari currently make the 066/12 1.6 litre V6 turbo-hybrid engine in 2024. They last used a non-Ferrari engine with the Lancia DS50 2.5l V8 in 1955.\n\nTeam lineage\n\nFerrari’s team lineage only features one name – Ferrari – having been Scuderia Ferrari from the moment Enzo entered his team in the maiden Formula 1 season in 1950 to the present. But the squad have also adopted some title sponsors over the years and in other categories.\n\nAlongside their Formula 1 team, Ferrari also compete in the Hypercar class of the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). The Scuderia also support a raft of GT racing teams with factory-backed and non-factory teams in series like WEC, the DTM and GT World Challenge.\n\nScuderia Ferrari drivers’ championships\n\nScuderia Ferrari are the most successful Formula 1 team of all time with a record 15 drivers’ championships. Ascari won Ferrari their first drivers’ title in 1952 with six wins and five pole positions from seven entries. Schumacher also won five of his seven drivers’ titles at Ferrari.\n\n1952 – Alberto Ascari (36 points)\n\n1953 – Alberto Ascari (34.5 points)\n\n1956 – Juan Manuel Fangio (30 points)\n\n1958 – Mike Hawthorn (42 points)\n\n1961 – Phil Hill (34 points)\n\n1964 – John Surtees (40 points)\n\n1975 – Niki Lauda (64.5 points)\n\n1977 – Niki Lauda (72 points)\n\n1979 – Jody Scheckter (51 points)\n\n2000 – Michael Schumacher (108 points)\n\n2001 – Michael Schumacher (123 points)\n\n2002 – Michael Schumacher (144 points)\n\n2003 – Michael Schumacher (93 points)\n\n2004 – Michael Schumacher (148 points)\n\n2007 – Kimi Raikkonen (110 points)\n\nScuderia Ferrari constructors’ championships\n\nScuderia Ferrari have won a record 16 Formula 1 constructors’ championship since the first teams’ title was given in 1958. It was originally the International Cup for F1 Manufacturers until 1981. Ferrari sealed their first title in 1961 when only the best driver’s results counted.\n\n1961 (40 points) – Phil Hill (38 points), Wolfgang von Trips (33 points), Richie Ginther (16 points), Olivier Gendebien (3 points), Willy Mairesse (0 points), Ricardo Rodriguez (0 points)\n\n1964 (45 points) – John Surtees (40 points), Lorenzo Bandini (23 points), Ludovico Scarfiotti (0 points), Pedro Rodriguez (1 point)\n\n1975 (72.5 points) – Niki Lauda (64.5 points), Clay Regazzoni (25 points)\n\n1976 (83 points) – Niki Lauda (68 points), Clay Regazzoni (31 points), Carlos Reutemann (0 points)\n\n1977 (95 points) – Niki Lauda (72 points), Carlos Reutemann (42 points), Gilles Villeneuve (0 points)\n\n1979 (113 points) – Jody Scheckter (60 points), Gilles Villeneuve (53 points)\n\n1982 (74 points) – Didier Pironi (39 points), Patrick Tambay (25 points), Gilles Villeneuve (6 points), Mario Andretti (4 points)\n\n1983 (89 points) – Rene Arnoux (49 points), Patrick Tambay (40 points)\n\n1999 (128 points) – Eddie Irvine (74 points), Michael Schumacher (44 points), Mika Salo (10 points)\n\n2000 (170 points) – Michael Schumacher (108 points), Rubens Barrichello (62 points)\n\n2001 (179 points) – Michael Schumacher (123 points), Rubens Barrichello (56 points)\n\n2002 (221 points) – Michael Schumacher (144 points), Rubens Barrichello (77 points)\n\n2003 (158 points) – Michael Schumacher (93 points), Rubens Barrichello (65 points)\n\n2004 (262 points) – Michael Schumacher (148 points), Rubens Barrichello (114 points)\n\n2007 (204 points) – Kimi Raikkonen (110 points), Felipe Massa (94 points)\n\n2008 (172 points) – Felipe Massa (97 points), Kimi Raikkonen (75 points)\n\nScuderia Ferrari factory base\n\nScuderia Ferrari work out of the Italian powerhouse’s Maranello factory, which is a 165,000-square-metre facility. Ferrari employ approximately 130,000 people across the complex that houses their sports car production and motorsport operations all in a mecca for the brand.\n\nEnzo Ferrari initially started his operation in Modena, Italy in 1929 but had to leave the city in the Emilia-Romagna region due to WW2. He would settle on starting his new shop in the commune of Maranello in 1943. F1 now only has a small part of Ferrari’s Maranello factory.\n\nFactory tour\n\nScuderia fans can purchase Fiorano Track and Viale Enzo Ferrari Panoramic Tours that take in the buildings where all the Prancing Horse cars are built. It also includes the meticulously preserved factory entrance dating back to 1947. Any photographs and videos are prohibited.\n\nAttendees of the Fiorano Track and Viale Enzo Ferrari Panoramic Tour are also not allowed to leave the shuttle bus throughout its entirety. It also differs from any standard factory tour as Ferrari only offer clients or sponsors of the Formula 1 team tours of their Maranello factory.\n\nFerrari also offer guided tours of their museum that are available in nine languages, plus the Italian Sign Language. Tours last around one hour with a 20 person-per-tour capacity. Ferrari also offer private visits outside. Public tours cost €200 (£171) plus the ticket to the museum.\n\nFactory address\n\nScuderia Ferrari: Via Abetone Inferiore, 4, 41053 Maranello MO, Italy\n\nWebsite: ferrari.com/en-EN/formula1"
