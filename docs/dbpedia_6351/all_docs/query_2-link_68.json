        "text": "Imola Facts\n\nCircuit Name Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari (Imola) Race first held 1980 Track Length 4.909km Race Distance 309.049km (63 Laps) Lap Record 1:15.484, Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes), 2020 2022 Result 1st Max Verstappen (Red Bull) 1:32:07.986 2nd Sergio Perez (Red Bull) +16.527s 3rd Lando Norris (McLaren) +34.834s\n\nLocated 40 kilometers to the east of Bologna in the Emilia-Romagna region, the Imola circuit made its debut as a Formula 1 World Championship venue in 1980. Before establishing itself as a regular fixture on the F1 calendar by hosting the San Marino Grand Prix from 1981 to 2006, Imola had once served as the setting for the Italian Grand Prix. Following a hiatus of fourteen years, the circuit marked its return to the F1 circuit by hosting the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in 2020.\n\nThe Beginnings of Imola\n\nThe establishment of the Imola circuit dates back to the aftermath of World War II. In efforts to revitalize the local economy, a proposal was made to construct a new road that would connect to the existing network of public roads. Situated in an area dubbed ‘Motor Valley’, renowned for housing factories of several major Italian car manufacturers, the new road was envisioned to serve as a testing ground for their latest car prototypes.\n\nThe construction that kicked off in 1950 brought a significant reduction in the unemployment rates in the surrounding areas. In 1952, F1 World Champion Alberto Ascari made history by completing the first lap around the track in a Ferrari, paving the way for the Imola circuit to officially open as a semi-permanent racing venue in 1953.\n\nImola has hosted a total of 30 World Championship Formula 1 races. The track saw 27 consecutive seasons of racing from 1980 to 2006, before making a comeback in 2020 to stage the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix.\n\nThe Emilia Romagna Grand Prix was unexpectedly canceled in 2023 due to severe local flooding, with the cancellation announced just two days before the scheduled start of the race weekend.\n\nOut of the 30 World Championship races hosted here, 16 different drivers have claimed victory.\n\nMichael Schumacher is the standout achiever at Imola, securing seven victories – more than twice the number of wins compared to any other driver at this circuit.\n\nFrom the current 2023 roster, three drivers have tasted victory at Imola. Fernando Alonso clinched the 2005 San Marino Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton was triumphant in 2020, and Max Verstappen succeeded in winning the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nScuderia Ferrari and Williams share the record for the most constructor wins at Imola, each securing victory eight times. In terms of engine manufacturers, Ferrari and Renault are tied for the top spot, with engines from both manufacturers claiming eight wins at the circuit.\n\nOnly five teams—Brabham, Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, and Red Bull—have managed to achieve consecutive wins at Imola. Williams and Ferrari hold the joint record for the longest streak of consecutive wins, with Williams triumphing from 1995 to 1997 and Ferrari from 2002 to 2004.\n\nThe circuit has witnessed eight 1-2 finishes by teams. McLaren leads with the most 1-2 finishes at Imola, achieving this feat in 1988, 1989, and 1991.\n\nMichael Schumacher stands out as the only driver to win consecutively at Imola on more than one occasion and holds the record for the most consecutive wins, with victories in 2002, 2003, and 2004.\n\nFerrari, McLaren, Williams, and Mercedes are the exclusive teams to have accomplished 1-2 finishes at the track. McLaren tops the list with three 1-2 finishes. Mercedes marked a significant 1-2 finish at the 2020 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, the first team to do so at the circuit since Ferrari’s 1-2 in 2002.\n\nThe battle for pole position at the Imola circuit in Italy has been intensely close, with less than a tenth of a second separating the top qualifier on ten occasions, including in two of the most recent three Emilia Romagna Grands Prix. The tightest margin for pole position recorded here was in 1995, when Michael Schumacher secured the fastest lap by a mere 0.008 seconds."
