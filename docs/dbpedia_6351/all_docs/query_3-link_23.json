It's more that I'm interested as to why the Indy results should or should not be included in discussions of Formula 1 statistics and records.\n\nregards\n\nNeil\n\nOriginally posted by Don Capps\n\nI have to plead a certain sense of mischief and state that the AAA National Championhip cars were in essence \"Formula 1\" cars -- for the most part. During this period there were only a few exceptions that made the field that didn't meet the Formula 1 rule of of a maximum capacity of 4,500cc for unsupercharged engines.\n\nOriginally posted by Rob29\n\nDom't understand what you mean Roger;Only rules for the races at that time, other than the specification of the cars ,was that they should last for at least 500km or 3hrs.The Indy 500 qualified on both counts. Nowhere does it say it has to be called a Grand Prix only the main national race of the country \"Grande Epreurve\"\n\nAnd sorry Don, but the rules at Indianapolis were VERY different to F1 throughout the fifties. For 1950 to 1953 \"non-stock supercharged motors of 3000cc, non-stock non-supercharged motors of 4500cc, supercharged four-stroke Diesel engines of 6600cc and supercharged two-stroke Diesel engines of 4500cc\" were allowed, from 1954 on Diesel engines were restricted to 5500cc and unrestricted turbine motors were allowed in, and from 1957 racing engines were restricted to 2800cc (s/c) and 4200cc (u/s). In every year from 1950 to '53 there were supercharged 3000cc entries practicing, qualifying and racing at the 500, so none of these races can be regarded as an F1 event, but they were WC rounds just as much as the British, French or Italian GP.\n\nOriginally posted by Ray Bell\n\nShame the Spanish never happened... Moss might have won in a BRM?\n\nHow about we have a hypothetical about this race, starting with the circuit and the then-current drivers and their then-current contracts?\n\nFrom its inception in 1950....\n\n....The weird part of it is that Indy still counted toward WC points in 1959 and 1960 when the U.S. had a pukka points-paying Grand Prix of its own (Sebring in 59 and Riverside in 60, both having the full GP circus participate in 2.5 liter cars). Don's right, history is messy. The question is, since Indy never called itself a Grand Prix, does it have the right to exclude itself from the nomenclature?\n\nOriginally posted by Bjorn\n\n.. odd\n\nI checked the Forix sequence list a week ago or so, and I'm sure it said that Ascari had 9 consecutive wins then... Recent update or am I getting crosseyed?\n\nOriginally posted by Marcor\n\nSchumi has now won 6 in a row, after the Malaysian GP. I'm not sure his teammate (Barichello at home in Brazil) will stop the serie although Schumi has declared he doesn't care about records.\n\nDon't know if this commentary has his place here at TNF as it's just speculation but the figures about the Schumacher's career are impressive...\n\nOriginally posted by Rob29\n\nDom't understand what you mean Roger;Only rules for the races at that time, other than the specification of the cars ,was that they should last for at least 500km or 3hrs.The Indy 500 qualified on both counts.
