        "text": "Some kings who are the first of their regnal name (including Juan Carlos I of Spain) list themselves with the regnal number I, but none of the Belgian monarchs (including King Philippe) have been listed with the number I before there was a second monarch with the name.\n\nJuan Carlos I is a special case like King Umberto I of Italy and Tsar Paul I of Russia whom all used the ordinal I during their reign.\n\nWas it a mere coincidence that Philippe, unlike Laurent, was given a royal name? At the time he was born no one would have expected him to reign as King of the Belgians.\n\nWhen Philippe was born on April of 1960, it was his uncle Baudouin's 9th year reign and was set to marry the Spanish aristocrat Fabiola on December of that year.\n\nHaving been born to the Prince and Princess of Liège, it was unlikely for him to inherit the throne.\n\nHowever, as to what you are pointing out, Philippe might be a royal name but only Kings Leopold II and Leopold III has a middle name Philippe. Laurent has a third name Baudouin and Astrid has second name Josephine-Charlotte.\n\nJuan Carlos I is a special case like King Umberto I of Italy and Tsar Paul I of Russia whom all used the ordinal I during their reign.\n\nKing Luis I used the ordinal I as well and there is speculation that Leonor will reign as Queen Leonor I.\n\nWhen Philippe was born on April of 1960, it was his uncle Baudouin's 9th year reign and was set to marry the Spanish aristocrat Fabiola on December of that year.\n\nHaving been born to the Prince and Princess of Liège, it was unlikely for him to inherit the throne.\n\nHowever, as to what you are pointing out, Philippe might be a royal name but only Kings Leopold II and Leopold III has a middle name Philippe. Laurent has a third name Baudouin and Astrid has second name Josephine-Charlotte.\n\nTrue, but as the name of historical Belgian monarchs who reigned as Count of Flanders or Duke of Burgundy, the name of the brother of King Leopold II who in time became his heir, and the name of one of the family's patron saints, it is distinctly more of a Belgian royal name than Laurent's, and I wonder if he was given the name in case of an eventuality.\n\nJuan Carlos I is a special case like King Umberto I of Italy and Tsar Paul I of Russia whom all used the ordinal I during their reign.\n\nWhen Philippe was born on April of 1960, it was his uncle Baudouin's 9th year reign and was set to marry the Spanish aristocrat Fabiola on December of that year.\n\nHaving been born to the Prince and Princess of Liège, it was unlikely for him to inherit the throne.\n\nThere are rumors that Fabiola's gynaecological problems were actually known before her marriage to King Baudouin and led her to break off a previous engagement to a Spanish nobleman. I don't know if that is true or just malicious gossip, but it is not entirely implausible.\n\nKing Luis I used the ordinal I as well and there is speculation that Leonor will reign as Queen Leonor I.\n\nThis can be real since Spain has a tradition of following the regnal and ordinal number scheme.\n\nTrue, but as the name of historical Belgian monarchs who reigned as Count of Flanders or Duke of Burgundy, the name of the brother of King Leopold II who in time became his heir, and the name of one of the family's patron saints, it is distinctly more of a Belgian royal name than Laurent's, and I wonder if he was given the name in case of an eventuality.\n\nLaurent is a French diminutive form of Lorenzo (Spanish, Italian). I was thinking maybe Queen Paola named his second son after her Italian relatives but I couldn't find anything. But needless to say, Laurent is really an unlikely name for a Belgian royal. As for his own children, only Prince Aymeric has an unusual name like his.\n\nKing Philippe and Queen Mathilde also did not give popular royal names to their sons but did so to their daughters Elisabeth and Eléonore.\n\nThere are rumors that Fabiola's gynaecological problems were actually known before her marriage to King Baudouin and led her to break off a previous engagement to a Spanish nobleman. I don't know if that is true or just malicious gossip, but it is not entirely implausible.\n\nI am not certain about this rumor though but what's certain was her five pregnancies ended in miscarriage in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1966 and 1968.\n\nIt should be noted that in 1962, when her second baby ended in miscarriage, she was told by a Swiss Gynecologist that she only has 10 percent chance of carrying a baby to full term, and herself a five percent chance of surviving. That's why the King and Queen made pilgrimages to Assisi and Lourdes.\n\nThere are claims that it was indeed known that Fabiola had medical problems. Apparently it was Pss Lilian who tried to convince the king to change his marital plans for that reason. But Cardinal Suenens told the king that 'God will take care of it'.\n\nTatiana Maria said:\n\ntheir engagement was not formally announced until that autumn.\n\nThe original engagement announcement was set for July 21st but it was postponed due to difficulties in Belgian Congo. Of course Philippe was born in April. It was said that he was named for the Count of Flanders, father of King Albert I. At the time they certainly would not have known that Philippe would inherit the throne as Baudouin was very much expected to have children. In the interview of Albert II of a few years ago he continues to emphasize what a surprise it was for him to become King.\n\nHRH Prince Charles, Count of Flanders who's Regency last from 1944 until 1950 was possibly the most dangerous era for the Belgian monarchy with the 1950 Referendum on the Monarchy.\n\nYes, but during his regency happened a lot of social, economical, political and international relations endeavors.\n\n1 Benelux Customs Union Treaty signed in 1944 and was taken into effect in 1948.\n\n2 Belgium became a member state of the UN on December 1945\n\n3 Passage of Women's Suffrage of March 1948.\n\n4 Belgium managed to jump-start its economy under the Marshall plan.\n\nTo name a few.\n\nBut there's one thing that I would have wanted him to do otherwise;\n\n1 The bequest of The Leuchtenberg Fabergé Tiara to his younger sister Queen Marie José of Italy. (It might have another path if it was left in Belgium.)\n\nYes, but during his regency happened a lot of social, economical, political and international relations endeavors.\n\n1 Benelux Customs Union Treaty signed in 1944 and was taken into effect in 1948.\n\n2 Belgium became a member state of the UN on December 1945\n\n3 Passage of Women's Suffrage of March 1948.\n\n4 Belgium managed to jump-start its economy under the Marshall plan.\n\nTo name a few.\n\nBut there's one thing that I would have wanted him to do otherwise;\n\n1 The bequest of The Leuchtenberg Fabergé Tiara to his younger sister Queen Marie José of Italy. (It might have another path if it was left in Belgium.)\n\nKing Albert II could have bought back the Fabergé tiara from the Savoys, but he chose to buy a yatch instead. Ironically, the tiara ended up in the United States (a most unlikely place)."
