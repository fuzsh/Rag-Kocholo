        "text": "“I notice that my age and my health do not allow me to carry out my duty as I would like to,” the 79-year-old said in a televised address to the nation.\n\n“I would fail to live up to my duties and my concept of the royal function by wanting to remain ... at all cost, without being able to fully live up to my role,” he added. “After a 20-year reign, I feel that the time has come to pass on the torch to the next generation.”\n\nAlbert ascended to the throne in August 1993 following the death of his older brother, King Baudouin.\n\n“When he was born, Prince Albert was not destined to become king, but with his enthusiasm, his empathy, his humour and his intelligence, he became it fully,” Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said.\n\nDi Rupo was referring to the fact that, when Albert was younger, it had seemed more likely the crown would pass down through Baudouin’s side of the family.\n\nHowever, Baudouin died with no heirs.\n\n“(Albert’s) sincerity, his courage and his lucidity with regard to his decision deserve our admiration,” Di Rupo added.\n\nBelgium has had six kings since the creation of its monarchy in 1831.\n\nSome had hoped that Albert would remain king until Belgium holds federal elections next year. The royal family is seen as one of the few forces uniting the country’s fractious Dutch-speaking Flemish and French-speaking Walloon communities.\n\n“There are two things that keep the Belgians united: the king and the Red Devils (football team),” Brussels resident Matthieu Bruynseels, who joined a crowd of about 70 people gathered outside the royal palace, told DPA.\n\n“Over the years, with the Queen Paola, (Albert) won the hearts of the Belgians,” Di Rupo noted.\n\nAlbert met Paola, an Italian princess, at the coronation of pope John XXIII. But their marriage was not always happy, as the king himself has publicly admitted.\n\nHe recently has been embroiled in a court case involving a woman who claims to be his illegitimate daughter.\n\nDelphine Boel has demanded DNA evidence from the ruler and two of his children to establish her royal lineage.\n\nIt is the first time that a Belgian king has willingly abdicated. Albert said he would still hold his traditional address to the nation on July 20, the eve of the country’s National Day.\n\nAlbert, Paola and Philippe will take part in those ceremonies, the king said.\n\n“The end of my reign does not mean that our paths will now separate - on the contrary,” Albert told his compatriots.\n\nHis abdication is the second in Europe this year, after Dutch queen Beatrix left behind the throne after 33 years to “place the responsibility of the country in the hands of a new generation”.\n\nBelgium’s new king, Prince Philippe, is a qualified fighter pilot who graduated from Stanford University with a master’s degree in political science. He is married to Princess Mathilde, who is of Belgian and Polish noble lineage. They have four children.\n\nThe 53-year-old has represented Belgium in economic missions around the world, as chairman of the country’s trade board."
