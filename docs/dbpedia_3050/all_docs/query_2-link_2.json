The Sudden Loss Of Belgium's Golden Prince!\n\nThank you for the fascinating information as well as the sources.\n\nI never knew that Prince Baudouin showed signs of support of the Flemish movement – could the close contact with others at military school perhaps have brought him into the sphere of various political movements? In light of his massive popularity and position as the future king of the Belgians, it is understandable that both the Flemish and Francophone press were sensitive to the prospect of a \"Flemish prince\".\n\n--------\n\nRegarding the discussion of the dynastic titles of the Belgian royal family:\n\nAll conferrals of dynastic titles (Duke of Brabant in 1840, Count of Flanders in 1840 and 1910, Count of Hainaut in 1859 and 1930, and Prince of Liège in 1934) were ad personam, so that none of those titles were legally hereditary. Two of them were, however, automatic on the basis of birth order and gender: The oldest son of the reigning king was automatically Duke of Brabant from 1840 to 2001, and his oldest son was automatically Count of Hainaut from 1930 to 2001.\n\nThus, the royal decree of October 16, 2001 had to deal with the automatic titles (Brabant and Hainaut), but not the other two (Flanders and Liège). The title Count of Flanders reverted to the crown in 1983 on Prince Charles' death, and the title Prince of Liège merged with the crown in 1993 when Prince Albert succeeded as King.\n\nSee this link for the decrees creating the titles and a link to the decree of 2001: https://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/royalbelge.htm\n\nBy the way, as an addition to my earlier comment, the fact that Prince Baudouin (and the other members of the royal family prior to the 1891 decree) was not formally a \"Prince of (Name of country)\" was not unique to the Belgian royal family. Even in the present day, I believe the royal families of Britain and Norway are simply \"Princess/Prince\" rather than \"Princess/Prince of Great Britain\" or \"Princess/Prince of Norway\"."
