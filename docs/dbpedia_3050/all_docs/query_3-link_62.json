        "text": "Category Archives: Belgian Royals\n\nKing’s Day – November 15 – Belgium\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nEach November 15, King’s Day (in the three official languages of Belgium: Dutch: Koningsdag, French: Fête du Roi, German: Festtag des Königs) is celebrated. Although it is not a national public holiday, government institutions are closed.\n\nBackground\n\nDuring the reign of Belgium’s first monarch Leopold I, King of the Belgians, born Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who remained Protestant despite being the monarch of a Catholic country, the anniversary of his oath-taking which occurred on July 21, 1831, was celebrated on his birthday, December 16.\n\nDuring the reign of Leopold I’s Catholic son and successor, Leopold II, King of the Belgians, the name of the day was changed to the Name Day of His Majesty the King and was celebrated on November 15, Leopold II’s name day, the feast of his namesake saint, Leopold III, Margrave of Austria known as Saint Leopold the Good. July 21 was once again and still is celebrated when in 1890, Belgian National Day was changed to July 21, marking the anniversary of the investiture of Leopold I as the first King of the Belgians in 1831.\n\nAfter his accession in 1909, Albert I, King of the Belgians, the Name Day of His Majesty the King moved to November 26, the feast day of Albert I’s namesake Saint Albert of Oberaltaich. After the death of his mother Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Countess of Flanders on November 26, 1912, Albert I moved the date back to November 15, the feast day of Saint Albert the Great.\n\nDuring the regency of Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, Prince Regent of Belgium from 1944 to 1950, the Belgian government renamed the celebration the Feast of the Dynasty because there was no Belgian monarch. In 1952, during the reign of Baudouin I, King of the Belgians, the celebration was renamed King’s Day.\n\nHow is King’s Day celebrated?\n\nPrince Laurent with his parents former Queen Paola, former King Albert II, and his sister Princess Astrid at the Te Deum service on November 15, 2023\n\nThe Belgian monarch and his/her spouse do not attend any ceremonies on King’s Day. Protocol decrees that it would be inappropriate for them to honor themselves. Before 2000, King’s Day was only celebrated with a Te Deum, a religious service of blessing and thanks. A Te Deum service is still held in the morning at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels, attended by members of the Belgian royal family.\n\nPrince Laurent, former King Albert II, former Queen Paola, and Princess Astrid celebrating King’s Day at the Belgian Federal Parliament on November 15, 2023\n\nSince 2001, to secularize the celebrations, a noon civil ceremony has been held at the Palace of the Nation, the home of the Belgian Federal Parliament. Members of the Belgian royal family, government officials, and prominent guests are in attendance. The civil ceremony consists of speeches, testimonies, and presentations to deserving citizens of national orders – the Order of Leopold, the Order of the Crown, and the Order of Leopold II.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

International powers meeting in London agreed to support Belgian independence, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new country. On April 22, 1831, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (the uncle of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert) was asked by the Belgian National Congress if he wanted to be King of the Belgians and he accepted.\n\nOn July 21, 1831, Leopold swore allegiance to the new Belgian constitution and was invested as the first King of the Belgians on the steps of the Royal Palace in Brussels. Belgian National Day was originally celebrated on September 27, the date in 1830 that the Dutch forces were expelled from Brussels during the Belgian Revolution‘s “September Days”. In 1890, Belgian National Day was changed to July 21, marking the anniversary of the investiture of Leopold I as the first King of the Belgians in 1831.\n\nWhat happens on Belgian National Day?\n\nCelebrations occur throughout Belgium starting with church services where the Te Deum hymn is sung and people pray for the Belgian monarch. The service ends with the singing of the national anthem, La Brabançonne. Local communities have flea markets, public concerts, and other celebrations, and Belgian flags are displayed in shops and homes.\n\n2023 – The Belgian Royal Family on the steps of the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula where the Te Deum service was held. Left to Right: Prince Emmanuel, Princess Elisabeth, Queen Mathilde, King Philippe, King Albert, Queen Paola, Prince Gabriel, and Princess Eleonore\n\nThe main celebrations occur in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. In the morning, the Belgian royal family along with representatives from Belgium’s political institutions, foreign ambassadors, and representatives of European institutions attend a Te Deum, a religious service of blessing and thanks, at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels.\n\nThe Belgian Royal Family watching the military parade in 2023\n\nLater in the afternoon, the Belgian monarch reviews the Belgian Armed Forces and police who parade on the streets around the perimeter of Brussels Park, in front of the Royal Palace. Military groups from the European Union and Belgium’s NATO allies have also participated.\n\nPeople eat mussels and Belgian fries while listening to live music in Brussels Park during the Belgian National Day in 2023.\n\nIn Brussels Park, the public can enjoy refreshments and view displays by Belgium’s public and emergency services, armed forces, charities, and civic associations.\n\nThere is a flypast by the Belgian Air Force.\n\nKing Philippe made his 2019 National Day Speech in front of a portrait of Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians.\n\nThe Belgian monarch makes a televised speech.\n\nFireworks during the 2023 Belgian National Day\n\nIn the evening, there is a concert and a fireworks display.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

On February 17, 1934, while climbing alone on the Roche de Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche-les-Dames, in the Ardennes region of Belgium, 58-year-old Albert I fell to his death. A year later, on February 17, 1935, a Mass was celebrated in commemoration of the death of Albert I.\n\nIn August 1935, Albert I’s son and successor, Leopold III, King of the Belgians (reigned 1934 – 1951, abdicated), his wife Queen Astrid (born a Princess of Sweden), and their three children (the future Baudouin, King of the Belgians, the future Albert II, King of the Belgians, and Princess Joséphine Charlotte of Belgium, who married Grand Duke Jean of Luxembourg) were on holiday in Switzerland. On August 29, 1935, having sent the children ahead, Leopold II and Astrid decided to take one last outing before returning to Belgium. On a drive in the mountains near Lake Lucerne, Leopold III was driving and Astrid was beside him. Leopold III was distracted by something Astrid pointed out and lost control of the car. The convertible went off the road and down a steep slope, crashing into a tree. Both were thrown out of the car. Leopold III was not seriously injured, however, 29-year-old Astrid was thrown into another tree and died from her injuries.\n\nAfter the death of Queen Astrid, it was decided to commemorate all deceased members of the Belgian royal family. On or around February 17 each year, Belgian royal family members and extended family attend a Mass at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Laeken, Brussels, Belgium, the burial site of the Belgian Royal Family.\n\nQueen Mathilde, Princess Delphine, King Philippe, Princess Claire, former King Albert II, Prince Laurent, and former Queen Paola attend the annual Mass in memory of deceased members of the Belgian Royal Family at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken on February 20, 2024\n\nAfter the Mass, the family visits the Royal Crypt in the Church of Our Lady of Laeken where past monarchs, consorts, and other royal family members are interred.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In August 1830, the southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the Netherlands rebelled against Dutch rule. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new country. On April 22, 1831, the Belgian National Congress asked Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, uncle of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert, if he wanted to be King of the Belgians. Leopold I, King of the Belgians swore allegiance to the new Constitution of Belgium on July 21, 1831, and became the first King of the Belgians. Under the Constitution of Belgium, the Belgian monarch is styled “King/Queen of the Belgians” to reflect that the monarch is “of the Belgian people.” Since 1830, there have been seven Belgian monarchs.\n\nBelgium is the only current European monarchy in which the heir to the throne does not automatically ascend to the throne upon the death or abdication of his or her predecessor. In Belgium, there is an interregnum – a period when there is no ruler – between the monarch’s death or abdication and his/her successor’s accession. According to Article 90 and Article 91 of the Constitution of Belgium, the heir accedes to the throne only after taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The joint session must be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch.\n\nThe most recent accession to the Belgian throne is that of Philippe, King of the Belgians. In early July 2013, Albert II, King of the Belgians announced his intention to abdicate, citing health reasons. On July 21, 2013, Belgium’s National Day, he signed the formal document of abdication and his elder son Philippe became King of the Belgians after he took the Belgian constitutional oath before The United Chambers, the legislative body created when both chambers of the Belgian Federal Parliament – the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate – meet in joint session.\n\nThe Cathedral of Saint Michael and Gudula as guests arrive for the Te Deum Service\n\nThe events of July 21, 2013 started with a Te Deum, a short religious service held to give thanks, at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula in Brussels, Belgium led by André-Joseph Léonard, Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and Primate of Belgium from 2010 until he retired in 2015.\n\nThe formal abdication of Albert II, King of the Belgians in the Throne Room at the Royal Palace of Brussels\n\nAfter the Te Deum, the formal abdication of Albert II, King of the Belgians was held. At 10:20 AM, Queen Fabiola (the widow of Albert II’s childless elder brother and predecessor Baudouin, King of the Belgians), Princess Astrid (Albert II’s daughter) and her husband Prince Lorenz (born an Archduke of Austria-Este from the former reigning House of Austria-Este), Prince Laurent (King Albert II’s younger son) and his wife Princess Claire (born Claire Coombs) arrived in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace in Brussels. Shortly afterward, Albert II, King of the Belgians and Queen Paola (born Paola Ruffo di Calabria), Crown Prince Philippe and Crown Princess Mathilde (born Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz) arrived.\n\nThe abdication ceremony began with a speech by Albert II, King of the Belgians memorable for an unscripted, emotional tribute to his wife: “As for Queen Paola, who constantly supported me in my work during these twenty years, I just want to say thank you . . . and a big kiss.” The many dignitaries in attendance applauded the speech and a very emotional Queen Paola held back tears.\n\nAlbert II, King of the Belgians signs the Deed of Abdication as Prime Minister Elio di Rupo looks on\n\nAfter Prime Minister Elio di Rupo‘s speech, the Minister of Justice, Annemie Turtelboom, read the Deed of Abdication which Albert II, King of the Belgians and the witnesses then signed. After his abdication, the former king was styled King Albert II of Belgium.\n\nThe swearing-in of King Philippe took place the same day at noon in the presence of both chambers of the Belgian Federal Parliament at the nearby Palace of the Nation, a neoclassical palace in Brussels, Belgium, that houses the Belgian Federal Parliament.\n\nIn Belgium’s three official languages, French, Dutch, and German, King Philippe took the Belgian constitutional oath from Article 91 of the Constitution of Belgium: “I swear to respect the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to preserve the independence of the country and to safeguard the integrity of the national territory”, confirming the monarchy’s constitutional role. In his acceptance speech, King Philippe confirmed his commitment to continuing his father’s work, to preserve Belgium’s unity.\n\nAfterward, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde with their four children, the heir apparent Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, Prince Gabriel, Prince Emmanuel, and Princess Eléonore, along with King Albert, Queen Paola, and Queen Fabiola greeted the Belgian people from the Royal Palace balcony.\n\nIn the late afternoon, King Philippe, wearing his uniform as commander-in-chief of the Belgian Army, inspected the troops from an open vehicle.\n\nThen the entire Belgian royal family watched the military parade which included marching bands, military vehicles, the Red Cross, police cars, members of the Special Forces, fire services, and policemen on their bicycles.\n\nFighter jets flew over the center of Brussels, painting black, yellow, and red stripes in the sky. Later in the evening, there were fireworks.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Belgium changed its succession law in 1991 to absolute primogeniture where the succession passes to the eldest child of the sovereign regardless of gender. Males and females have equal succession rights. This means that Elisabeth is the heir apparent and comes first in the line of succession as the eldest child. She is expected to become the first Belgian Queen Regnant. When her father Philippe became King of the Belgians, Elisabeth automatically became Duchess of Brabant, the title used by the female heirs to the Belgian throne and the wives of male heirs.\n\nFrom her father Philippe, King of the Belgians, Elisabeth has the typical royal pedigree with Belgian, Danish, Portuguese, and Swedish monarchs among her ancestors, in addition to Dutch, Bavarian, and other German royalty. From Elisabeth’s paternal grandmother, there is a lot of Italian nobility with a smattering of Belgian and French ancestors. Adrienne Jenny Florimonde de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg, one of Philippe’s great-great-great-grandmothers, is the granddaughter of Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. Better known as just Lafayette in the United States, Philippe’s great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was a French aristocrat and military officer who fought in the American Revolutionary War, commanding American troops in several battles. After returning to France, he was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830. Lafayette is known as “The Hero of the Two Worlds” for his service to both France and the United States.\n\nElisabeth’s mother Queen Mathilde, born Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz, is the first native-born Belgian queen consort. Through her mother, Mathilde has Polish noble and Polish–Lithuanian princely ancestry. Mathilde’s father descends from Walloon (a French-speaking people who live in Belgium) nobles and was titled Jonkheer, the lowest title within the Belgian nobility system. When Mathilde married Philippe in 1999, her father was created Count d’Udekem d’Acoz by Albert II, King of the Belgians, Philippe’s father.\n\nParents, Grandparents, Great-Grandparents, Great-Great-Grandparents, and Great-Great-Great-Grandparents of Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, Duchess of Brabant (born October 25, 2001)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Elisabeth of Belgium, Duchess of Brabant\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Kingdom of Belgium Index\n\nThe links below are from Unofficial Royalty, Wikipedia, Leo’s Genealogics Website, The Peerage, or Geni.\n\nParents\n\nPhilippe, King of the Belgians (born 1960)\n\nMathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz (born 1973)\n\nGrandparents\n\nKing Albert II of the Belgians and Paola Ruffo di Calabria, paternal grandparents\n\nAlbert II, King of the Belgians (born 1934)\n\nPaola Ruffo di Calabria (born 1937)\n\nCount Patrick d’Udekem d’Acoz (1936 – 2008)\n\nAnna Maria Komorowska (born 1946)\n\nGreat-Grandparents\n\nLeopold III, King of the Belgians (1901 – 1983)\n\nPrincess Astrid of Sweden (1905 – 1935)\n\nFulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria (1884 – 1946)\n\nLuisa Gazelli dei Conti di Rossana e di Sebastiano (1896 – 1989) (link in Italian)\n\nBaron Charles d’Udekem d’Acoz (1885 – 1968)\n\nSuzanne Marie van Outryve d’Ydewalle (1898 – 1983)\n\nCount Leon Michał Komorowski (1907 – 1992)\n\nPrincess Zofia Sapieha (1919 – 1997)\n\nGreat-Great-Grandparents\n\nAlbert I, King of the Belgians (1875 – 1934)\n\nDuchess Elisabeth in Bavaria (1876 – 1965)\n\nPrince Carl of Sweden, Duke of Västergötland (1861 – 1951)\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Denmark (1878 – 1958)\n\nFulco VII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria (1848 – 1901)\n\nLaura Mosselman du Chenoy (1851 – 1925) (link in Dutch)\n\nAugusto Gazelli dei Conti di Rossana (1855 – 1937)\n\nMaria dei Conti Rignon (1858 – 1950)\n\nBaron Maximilien d’Udekem d’Acoz (1861 – 1921)\n\nMarie Jeanne van Eyll (1863 – 1935)\n\nClement van Outryve d’Ydewalle (1876 – 1942)\n\nMadeleine de Thibault de Boesinghe (1876 – 1931)\n\nMichał Leon Komorowski (1875 – 1950)\n\nMaria Zaborowska- Grzymała (1875 – 1953)\n\nPrince Adam Zygmunt Sapieha (1892 – 1970)\n\nTeresa Sobańska (1891 – 1975)\n\nGreat-Great-Great-Grandparents\n\nKing Frederik VIII of Denmark and Princess Louise of Sweden, great-great-great-grandparents\n\nPrince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders (1837 – 1905)\n\nPrincess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1845 – 1912)\n\nDuke Karl-Theodor in Bavaria (1839 – 1909)\n\nInfanta Maria Josepha of Portugal (1857 – 1943)\n\nKing Oscar II of Sweden (1829 – 1907)\n\nPrincess Sophia of Nassau (1836 – 1913)\n\nKing Frederik VIII of Denmark (1843 – 1912)\n\nPrincess Louise of Sweden (1851 – 1926)\n\nDon Fulco Antonio Ruffo di Calabria-Santapau (1801 – 1848)\n\nMaria Eleonora Galletti di San Cataldo (1810 – 1885)\n\nTheodore Mosselman du Chenoy (1804 – 1876) (link in Dutch)\n\nIsabelle Coghen (1822 – 1891)\n\nCalisto Gazelli, 3rd Conte di Rossana (1803 – 1875)\n\nFrancesca Cotti, dei Conti de Ceres (1821 – 1865)\n\nEnrico Vittore Felice, Conte Rignon (1828 – 1914)\n\nLuisa Perrone di San Martino (1838 – 1880)\n\nBaron Albert d’Udekem d’Acoz (1828 – 1900)\n\nAlice Marie de Kerchove (1838 – 1877)\n\nBaron Gustave Jean Casimir van Eyll (1830 – 1905)\n\nMarie Louise Caroline Ghislaine van Goethem (1834 – 1863)\n\nEugene Edouard Charles Bernard van Outryve d’Ydewalle (1830 – 1901)\n\nLaurence Caroline Joséphine Jeanne Marie de Serret (1836 – 1910)\n\nDésiré de Thibault de Boesinghe (1837 – 1909)\n\nMarie Isabelle Dorothé Frennelet (1843 – 1881)\n\nLeon Wilhelm Komorowski-Korczak (1849 – 1900)\n\nKrystyna Antonina Zbijewska-Rola (1850 – 1916)\n\nAmbroży Zaborowski-Grzymała (? – 1899)\n\nMichalina Miączyńska-Suchekomnaty (1848 – 1927)\n\nPrince Władysław Leon Adam Feliks Sapieha (1853 – 1920)\n\nElżbieta Konstancja Ewa Potulicka-Grzymała (1859 – 1947)\n\nMichał Maria Kamil Kazimierz Sobański Junosza (1858 – 1934)\n\nLudwika Maria Wodzicka (1857 – 1944)\n\nSources:\n\nFamily Tree and Family History at Geni\n\nLeo’s Genealogics Website\n\nThe Peerage\n\nWikipedia\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In August 1830, the southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands rebelled against Dutch rule. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new country. On April 22, 1831, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the uncle of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was asked by the Belgian National Congress if he wanted to be king of the new country. Leopold swore allegiance to the new Belgian constitution on July 21, 1831, and became the first King of the Belgians. Under the Belgian Constitution, the Belgian monarch is styled “King/Queen of the Belgians” to reflect that the monarch is “of the Belgian people.”\n\nAlthough the Belgian royal family is Roman Catholic, Leopold I was born a Lutheran and remained a Lutheran for his entire life. Before Leopold became King of the Belgians, he was first married to Princess Charlotte of Wales, the only child of King George IV of the United Kingdom, who tragically died in childbirth along with her son. Charlotte, who most likely would have been Queen of the United Kingdom, and her son are buried at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England.\n\nNo family burial site had been planned for the members of the new Belgian royal family. When King Leopold I’s infant son Crown Prince Louis Philippe died suddenly in 1834, he was buried at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula out of necessity.\n\nQueen Louise-Marie, born Princess Louise-Marie of Orléans, predeceased her husband King Leopold I, dying of tuberculosis at age 38 in 1850. She wanted to be buried in the old Church of Our Lady of Laeken built in 1275 and her remains were buried there. To honor the memory of his wife, Leopold I, King of the Belgians conceived the idea of a new and larger church at Laeken. There has been a house of worship on this site since around 800. In 1275, the original chapel was replaced by a church in the Gothic style called the Church of Our Lady of Laeken.\n\nBy royal decree on October 14, 1850, the government authorized the construction of the new church and organized a competition for the design of the new church. There were only two stipulations for the design, the church should be able to hold 2,000 people and its price should not exceed 800,000 francs. In 1852, the jury decided upon a neo-gothic design by Joseph Poelaert, a 34-year-old architect. The German architect Friedrich von Schmidt designed the portal and the 99-meter-high tower.\n\nKing Leopold I laid the foundation stone for the new church in 1854 and in 1872 the church was consecrated but it was not fully completed until 1909 because of a long interruption of work. In 1894, the old church was demolished due to its state of disrepair. However, the choir of the old church was preserved and has survived as a chapel in the center of the adjacent Laeken Cemetery.\n\nBoth Louise-Marie who died in 1850 and Leopold who died in 1865 were first buried at the old Church of Our Lady of Laeken. On April 20, 1876, their remains were interred in the royal crypt at the new Church of Our Lady of Laeken. All the monarchs, all their consorts, and some other members of the Belgian royal family have been buried at the neo-gothic Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels, Belgium, the burial church of the Belgian royal family, built in memory of Queen Louise-Marie, the second wife of Belgium’s first king Leopold I.\n\nThe Belgian Monarchy: Royal Crypt in Laeken\n\n*********************\n\nRoyal Burials\n\nThe crypt is located under the main altar. Two staircases on either side behind the main altar lead down to the crypt. At the foot of the stairs, just in front of the carved oak doors of the entrance to the crypt, is a mosaic depicting the nine coats of arms of the Belgian provinces.\n\nIn the center of the crypt is the large, white tomb of Leopold I, King of the Belgians and his second wife Queen Louise-Marie, topped by a royal crown with four mourning figures draped in black at the four corners.\n\nSurrounding the tomb of Leopold I and Louise-Marie are the tombs of Leopold I’s successors and their spouses. The niches in the wall house the coffins of other members of the royal family, such as Prince Charles, Duke of Flanders, Regent of Belgium, and other princes and princesses. A very nice touch that this writer observed was the framed photographs on the tombs.\n\n*********************\n\nThe management of the burial crypt at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken is under the direct authority of the Belgian monarch who manages the burial crypt on behalf of the members of the Belgian royal family. The Belgian government has no authority over the burial crypt. The Belgian monarch decides who will be allowed burial in the royal crypt and where they will be buried.\n\nIn 1927, Albert I, King of the Belgians allowed the burial of his aunt Empress Carlota of Mexico in the royal crypt. Empress Carlota was born Princess Charlotte of Belgium, the daughter of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, and the wife of Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who, as the ill-fated Emperor of Mexico, was executed by a firing squad. Under the laws of the Austrian House of Habsburg, Empress Carlota was to be buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna, Austria.\n\nAlthough the tombs are designed for two remains, the tomb of King Leopold III contains three remains. King Leopold III ordered that his second wife Princess Lilian would be buried in his tomb upon her death, and this order was carried out by his son Albert II, King of the Belgians.\n\nBaudouin, King of the Belgians allowed Prince Leopold of Liechtenstein, stillborn on May 20, 1984, in Brussels, Belgium, the son of his niece Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg and her husband Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein, to be buried in the royal crypt although he was not a member of the Belgian royal family.\n\nThe following are interred in the royal crypt at the Church of Our Lady of Laeken. Note that Leopold III was styled as Leopold III, King of the Belgians from 1934 – 1951. After his abdication in 1951, he was styled King Leopold III of Belgium and that is how he is referred to below.\n\n1869: Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant – eldest son and heir of Leopold II, King of the Belgians, fell into a pond, caught pneumonia, and died at age nine\n\n1871: Princess Joséphine Marie of Belgium – infant daughter of Prince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders\n\n1891: Prince Baudouin of Belgium – eldest son of Prince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders, was a potential King of the Belgians because his uncle Leopold II, King of the Belgians had no sons, died from influenza at age 21\n\n1876 (buried): Louise-Marie of Orléans, Queen Consort of the Belgians – the second wife of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, died 1850, originally buried at the old Church of Our Lady of Laeken, transferred to the new church in 1876\n\n1876 (buried): Leopold I, King of the Belgians – died 1865, originally buried at the old Church of Our Lady of Laeken, transferred to the new church in 1876\n\n1902: Marie Henriette of Austria, Queen Consort of the Belgians – wife of Leopold II, King of the Belgians\n\n1905: Prince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders – son of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, Philippe is an ancestor of the current Belgian royal family as his son succeeded to the Belgian throne as Albert I, King of the Belgians\n\n1909: Leopold II, King of the Belgians – son of Leopold I, King of the Belgians\n\n1912: Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Countess of Flanders – wife of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders, Marie is an ancestor of the current Belgian royal family as her son succeeded to the Belgian throne as Albert I, King of the Belgians\n\n1927: Princess Charlotte of Belgium, Empress Carlota of Mexico – daughter of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, wife of Archduke Maximilian of Austria, Emperor Maximilian of Mexico\n\n1934: Albert I, King of the Belgians – son of Prince Philippe of Belgium, Count of Flanders, killed in a mountain climbing accident\n\n1935: Astrid of Sweden, Queen Consort of the Belgians – first wife of King Leopold III of Belgium, killed in a car accident\n\n1965: Elisabeth of Bavaria, Queen Consort of the Belgians – wife of Albert I, King of the Belgians\n\n1983: Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, Regent of Belgium, son of Albert I, King of the Belgians\n\n1983: King Leopold III of Belgium – son of Albert I, King of the Belgians, abdicated in 1951\n\n1984 – Prince Leopold of Liechtenstein (stillborn May 20, 1984) – grandson of Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg who was born a Princess of Belgium, son of Princess Margaretha of Luxembourg and Prince Nikolaus of Liechtenstein\n\n1993 (buried): Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium – the infant son of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, died before his first birthday.

It is named for Saint James the Greater, one of the twelve Apostles, who is styled “the Greater” to distinguish him from another Apostle, James “the Less”, with greater meaning older or taller, rather than more important.\n\nIt is the church with the first connection to the Belgian royal family. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, stood on the cathedral steps when he took the oath that made him Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians on July 21, 1831. Since the reign of Albert I, King of the Belgians, most baptisms of monarchs’ children have occurred at the Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg. However, the christenings of the children of Philippe, King of the Belgians all took place in the chapel at Ciergnon Castle in Houyet, Namur, Belgium, one of the favorite summer residences of the Belgian royal family. Several funerals for members of the Belgian royal family have also taken place at the Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg. Located close to the Royal Palace of Brussels, the cathedral is the parish church of the Royal Palace.\n\nOriginally the Saint-Jacques-sur-Coudenberg Abbey, an Augustinian abbey, was on the site of the present cathedral. During the development of the Place Royale between 1776 and 1781, the abbey was demolished and the Cathedral of Saint-Jacques-sur-Coudenberg was built. Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, Governor of the Austrian Netherlands, laid the cornerstone on February 12, 1776. The Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg was the official church of the court of the Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands and served as an abbey church and a parish church.\n\nOfficial Website: Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg (in French)\n\n********************\n\nJuly 21, 1831: The Constitutional Oath of Leopold I, King of the Belgians\n\nBelgium has been a country only since 1830. In August 1830, the southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands rebelled against Dutch rule. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new country. On April 22, 1831, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the uncle of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was asked by the Belgian National Congress if he wanted to be king of the new country. Leopold swore allegiance to the new Belgian constitution on July 21, 1831, and became the first King of the Belgians. Each year July 21 is celebrated as Belgian National Day.\n\nThe accession ceremony took place at the Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg. A stand was erected on the cathedral steps surrounded by the names of revolutionaries who died in the Belgian Revolution. After remarks from government leaders and the reading of the entire Belgian Constitution, Leopold, dressed in the uniform of a Belgian lieutenant-general, took the constitutional oath, as stated at the time in Article 80 of the Belgian Constitution, in French: “Je jure d’observer la constitution et les lois du peuple belge, the maintenir l’indépendance nationale et l’intégrité du territoire.” (Translation: “I swear that I will abide by the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, maintain the country’s independence and preserve the integrity of the territory.”\n\n********************\n\nRoyal Baptisms\n\nThe future Albert II, King of the Belgians being carried into the Cathedral of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg for his baptism.

In August 1830, the southern provinces (modern-day Belgium) of the Kingdom of the Netherlands rebelled against Dutch rule. International powers meeting in London agreed to support the independence of Belgium, even though the Dutch refused to recognize the new country. On April 22, 1831, Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the uncle of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was asked by the Belgian National Congress if he wanted to be king of the new country. Leopold swore allegiance to the new Belgian constitution on July 21, 1831, and became the first King of the Belgians. Under the Belgian Constitution, the Belgian monarch is styled “King/Queen of the Belgians” to reflect that the monarch is “of the Belgian people.”\n\nThe various predecessor states of the Kingdom of Belgium whose royalty also used the cathedral will be noticed below in the listing of royal events that occurred at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula over the centuries. Before 1830, going back to the twelfth century, the predecessor states of Belgium were:\n\nDuchy of Brabant – a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the core of the historic Low Countries. It was part of the Burgundian Netherlands and the Habsburg Netherlands. Today, the title of Duke or Duchess of Brabant is the title of the heir apparent to the Belgium throne.\n\nBurgundian Netherlands (1384 – 1482) – Holy Roman Empire and French fiefs ruled in personal union by the Dukes of Burgundy of the House of Valois-Burgundy and later by their Habsburg heirs.\n\nHabsburg Netherlands (1482 – 1797) is the collective name of Renaissance period fiefs in the Low Countries held by the Holy Roman Empire’s House of Habsburg.\n\nSpanish Netherlands (1556 – 1714) – was the name for the Habsburg Netherlands ruled by the Spanish branch of the Habsburgs from 1556 to 1714\n\nAustrian Netherlands (1714 – 1797) – was the name for the Habsburg Netherlands ruled by Governors from the Austrian House of Habsburg. It existed from the end of the Spanish War of Succession in 1714 until the conquest by French revolutionary troops and the annexation to the French Republic in 1797.\n\nFrance (1797 – 1815) – France took over the Austrian Netherlands during the French Revolutionary Wars.\n\nKingdom of the Netherlands (1815 – 1830) – After the defeat of Napoleon, Willem V, Prince of Orange, urged on by the powers who met at the Congress of Vienna, proclaimed the Netherlands a monarchy on March 16, 1815. The new United Kingdom of the Netherlands consisted of territories that had belonged to the former Dutch Republic, Austrian Netherlands, and Prince-Bishopric of Liège\n\n********************\n\nOfficial Website: Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula\n\nThe current Belgian royal family has used the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula for weddings and funerals but not for burials. All the monarchs, all the consorts, and some other members of the Belgian royal family have been buried at the neo-gothic Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Laeken in Brussels, Belgium. The church was built in memory of Queen Louise-Marie, wife of Belgium’s first monarch King Leopold I. Since the reign of Albert I, King of the Belgians, most royal baptisms have been held at the Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels. Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld stood on the steps Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg when he took the oath that made him Leopold I, the first King of the Belgians on July 21, 1831.\n\nAbove: Statues of Saint Michael the Archangel and Saint Gudula in the Cathedral of Saint Michael and Saint Gudula; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nThe patron saints of the church, Saint Michael and Saint Gudula, are also the patron saints of the City of Brussels. Saint Michael is the familiar Saint Michael the Archangel. A local female saint, Saint Gudula of Brabant, was born circa 646 in Brabant in present-day Belgium and died between 680 and 714. The cathedral stands on what was Treurenberg Hill in Brussels where there was a crossroads of two important old roads – Flanders to Cologne and Antwerp to Brussels. A chapel to St. Michael was built on Treurenberg Hill in the ninth century and was replaced by a Romanesque church in the eleventh century. In 1047, Lambert II, Count of Louvain and his wife Oda of Verdun founded a canon, a community of non-monastic clergy, in honor of Saint Gudula. Lambert arranged for the relics of St. Gudula to be transferred from another church in Brussels. From that time, the church became known as the Collegiate Church of St. Michael and St. Gudula.\n\nIn 1200, under Henri I, Duke of Brabant, the church was restored and enlarged. However, in 1226, Henri II, Duke of Brabant decided to build a new Gothic-style church. The choir was constructed between 1226 – 1276. The nave and transept date from the 14th and 16th centuries. The façade and the two towers were built from 1470 – 1485. The new church was completed in 1519. Several chapels were added in the 16th and 17th centuries. Restoration work was carried out in the 19th century and further restoration occurred from 1983 – 1999.\n\nOn June 6, 1579, the church was pillaged by the Protestant Geuzen, a group of Calvinist Dutch nobles, and Saint Gudula’s relics were scattered and lost. In February 1962, the church was given cathedral status, and since then it has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels.\n\n********************\n\nPlease note, the lists below may not be complete.\n\nRoyal Baptisms\n\n1480: Margaret of Austria – daughter of Mary, Duchess of Burgundy in her own right (daughter of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy) and Maximilian of Austria, later Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor\n\n1498: Eleanor of Austria – daughter of Philip of Austria, Duke of Burgundy (son of Mary, Duchess of Burgundy and Maximilian of Austria, later Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor) and Juana I, Queen of Castile, Queen of Aragon\n\n1833: Louis Philippe, Crown Prince of Belgium – son of Leopold I, King of the Belgians, died before his first birthday\n\nRoyal Weddings\n\nWedding of the future Albert II, King of the Belgians and Paola Ruffo di Calabri\n\nAugust 22, 1853: Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant (the future Leopold II, King of the Belgians) and Marie-Henriette of Austria\n\nNovember 10, 1926: Prince Leopold, Duke of Brabant (the future Leopold III, King of the Belgians) and Princess Astrid of Sweden – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Leopold III and Princess Astrid of Sweden\n\nJuly 2, 1959: Prince Albert, Prince of Liège (the future Albert II, King of the Belgians) and Paola Ruffo di Calabri – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Albert II and Paola Ruffo di Calabria\n\nDecember 15, 1960: Baudouin, King of the Belgians and Fabiola de Mora y Aragón – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Baudouin I and Fabiola de Mora y Aragón\n\nDecember 4, 1999: Prince Philippe, Duke of Brabant (the future Philippe, King of the Belgians) and Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz – Unofficial Royalty: Wedding of King Philippe and Mathilde d’Udekem d’Acoz\n\nApril 12, 2003: Prince Laurent of Belgium and Claire Coombs\n\nRoyal Funerals\n\nThe royal families of Belgium and Luxembourg pray during the funeral mass for Baudouin, King of the Belgians.

After returning to France, he was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830.

Sybille and Albert had begun an affair in around 1964 which reportedly continued until 1982. At the time of Delphine’s birth, Sybille was married to Jacques Boël, who was listed on the birth certificate as the child’s father. Her parents divorced in 1978, and four years later, her mother remarried. At that time, Delphine and her mother moved to London.\n\nDelphine attended the Institut le Rosey – an exclusive boarding school in Switzerland – before enrolling at the Chelsea School of Art and Design in London, graduating with a degree in Fine Arts. She has worked as an artist for many years and has had numerous exhibitions of her work in Europe.\n\nIn 2003, Delphine married James O’Hare, an American, and the couple had two children, who are now a Prince and Princess of Belgium:\n\nPrincess Joséphine of Belgium (born 2003)\n\nPrince Oscar of Belgium (born 2008)\n\nHaving had several exhibitions of her work in Belgium already, Delphine and her family moved to Brussels in 2003. It was then that her public profile began to rise again – both because of her art and her alleged relationship to King Albert.\n\nIn 1999, in a biography of Queen Paola, the first public allegation was made of Sybille’s affair with King Albert and the subsequent birth of their daughter. The Belgian royal court quickly dismissed the report as “gossip”, but King Albert seemed to refer to the situation later that year. In his Christmas message, he spoke of a “crisis” in his marriage some thirty years earlier that they had overcome, but of which they had been recently reminded. That would be the last public statement on the matter for many years.\n\nIn May 2005, Delphine stated in an interview that she was King Albert’s daughter, having been told this by her mother when she reached the age of 18. She said that the future King had continued his relationship with her mother until around 1982 when he abruptly ended things and cut off all contact with them. She also alleged that when she and her mother moved to England, Albert thought about divorcing his wife and joining them, but Sybille was against the idea due to the impact it would have on Albert and his future role in the monarchy.\n\nIn June 2013, Delphine filed a lawsuit to prove, through DNA testing, that she was King Albert’s biological child. The King was named in the suit, however, he had complete immunity from prosecution at the time, so she also named two of his legitimate children – Philippe and Astrid. When the King abdicated in September of that year, she withdrew the suit against Philippe and Astrid, now being able to file against the former King. In 2017, her claim was initially rejected, but that was overturned in October 2018 by the Court of Appeal. Based on DNA testing, it was proven that Jacques Boël was not her father, thus furthering her claims. The former King was instructed to provide a DNA sample, but he appealed that ruling. Again, the Court of Appeal upheld the order in May 2019 and imposed a fine of €5,000 per day until King Albert complied. Within weeks, a DNA sample was provided for testing, and in January 2020, the former King finally acknowledged that he was Delphine’s biological father, as proven by the DNA testing.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Belgian Court of Appeal ruled that Delphine and her children are entitled to the style and title of HRH Prince/Princess of Belgium, and can use the former King’s surname of Saxe-Coburg. In addition, she is legally entitled to inherit one-quarter of the former King’s estate – a share equal to that of his three legitimate children. She is still considered illegitimate (born out of wedlock) and as such, Delphine and her descendants are not in the line of succession to the Belgian throne.\n\nOn October 9, 2020, Princess Delphine met her half-brother Philippe, King of the Belgians for the first time at Laeken Castle, the king’s residence. A common message from King Philippe and Princess Delphine was posted on Facebook: “This Friday, October 9th, we met for the first time at Laeken Castle. Our meeting was warm. We had the opportunity to get to know each other during a long and rich exchange that allowed us to talk about each other’s lives and shared interests. This bond will now develop in a family setting.”\n\nOn October 25, 2020, King Albert and his wife Queen Paola met with Princess Delphine for the first time since she was recognized as a royal at Belvédère Castle in Brussels. A joint statement by all three was released: “On Sunday, October 25, a new chapter began, filled with emotions, appeasement, understanding and also of hope. Our meeting took place at Belvédère Castle, a meeting during which each of us was able to express our feelings and experiences serenely and with empathy. After the turmoil, suffering, and hurt, it is time for forgiveness, healing, and reconciliation. Together we decided to take this new path. This will take patience and effort, but we are determined.”\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
