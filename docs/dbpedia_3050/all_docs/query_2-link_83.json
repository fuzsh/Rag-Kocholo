        "text": "Post by Gordon Lee on\n\nGreetings Fellow SB Boarders\n\n.\n\nWhat do you see when you look at a man's face on a stamp? Do you just recognize his name or know who he really was as a person? Do you feel his elated joys and his angst disappointments that he may have felt? Do you really know the person?\n\n.\n\nHere is a stamp picturing a man who split a country in half:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBELGIUM -- SCOTT 303 issued 1936\n\n.\n\nBorn 9 November 1901 to parents King Albert I of The Belgians and Duchess Elisabeth of Bavaria LÃ©opold Philippe Charles Albert Meinrad Hubertus Marie Miguel (I wonder what his mother called him when she was angry?) began a life in which he was an acclaimed brave hero king or an insidious traitor king. His teenage years where filled with enjoyment as a member of royalty as a crowned prince and he faced uncertainty as a private during World War I fighting with the 12th Belgian Regiment. Unscathed after the war, he began full-time training to become leader of his country as a student in a military academy and as an officer in the 1st Grenadiers.\n\n.\n\nIt was not all work for young Lennie. In 1926 the crown prince married Princess Astrid of Sweden, the youngest daughter of Prince Carl of Sweden and Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. Between 1927 and 1934 they produces three handsome children: Princess Josephine-Charlotte, Prince Baudouin, and little Albert. But just before little Albert's birth, his namesake, King Albert I, in a mountaineering accident, died. On 23 February, King Leopold III succeeded Albert I.\n\n.\n\nNow his father, Albert I, was a unexcitable king. He didn't push his authority around and he got along pleasantly with his ministers, advisors and regents. Upon obtaining the crown, Leopold III tend to push the envelope and tried to see how far he could get with his authority, often disagreeing with his advisors. Leopold maintained a difficult and contentious relationship with his ministers, acting independently of government influence whenever possible, and seeking to circumvent and even limit the ministers' powers, while expanding his own. However, he soon regretted his hands on management style and take charge attitude. Especially about not being chauffeured.\n\n.\n\nOn 29 August 1935, while the King and Queen were driving along the winding, narrow roads near their villa in KÃ¼ssnacht, Switzerland on the shores of Lake Lucerne, Leopold lost control of his car which plunged into the lake, killing the sweet and lovely Queen Astrid. A bleak day for the King and his country.\n\n.\n\nMeantime the realm marches on. Against his advisors recommendations, in 1936 King Leopold announced a neutrality policy for Belgium, which had until then been an explicit ally of France and the United Kingdom. The Sovereign hoped that this would spare Belgium from the imminent German threat. We all know how that turned out, don't we?\n\n.\n\nOn 10 May 1940, Germany invaded the Low Countries, which included Belgium, despite Belgian neutrality. The ministers urged the King to leave the country with the Government (first to France, and later to England). \"No,\" said Leopold, \"I am the Commander-in-Chief and I share my destiny with my troops.\" Like his father in 1914, Leopold III immediately took personal supreme command of the Belgian army. As we see, this turned out to be a no-win situation all away around.\n\n.\n\nThe German advancement employed insurmountable tactics (using gliders to land troops behind the lines, for example). They soon almost completely surrounded the combined Allied forces of Belgium, France and Britain. They would have prevented the total Allied escape from Dunkirk except the for the gallant, near suicidal efforts of the Belgium army to keep them at bay. As it was, if fighting continued, the entire Belgium army would have been annihilated if the Commander-in-Chief did not throw in the towel to avoid further needless bloodshed on 28 May.\n\n.\n\nThus, we have the first major fly-in-the-ointment bestowed upon the good King Leopold III by his subjects. His slow response to German aggression, his brief three week fight, and the abrupt surrender confirmed the impression to his fellow countrymen of his treasonous nature. It did not help that the French and British fully agreed. They expected King Leopold and his men to fight unto death while they escaped to fight again another day. They called him a snake and a coward. (Personally, I think they just didn't like the idea that King Leopold capitulated without direct input from the French and the British.)\n\n.\n\nKing Leopold III, now a prisoner of war, was kept under house arrest by the Germans. He refused acting as a mouth-piece for the Third Reich by conducting no business at all as Head of State. What he did do is get married again in 1941.\n\n.\n\nHe married the elegant Lilian Baels. She was a commoner (born in London) with uncommon good looks, head-strong ways, but not near the graciousness displayed by the deceased Astrid. She was declared Princesse de RÃ©thy (not Queen Lilian). Within seven months they had their first child. This union further damaged his reputation in the eyes of many of his subjects.\n\n.\n\nNow, let us skip to the end of World War Two. The surviving government returned from England to Belgium. But because of the controversy about his conduct during the war, Leopold III and his wife and children were unable to return to Belgium and his brother Prince Charles was made regency by the Legislature. Leopold III and Princesse de Rethy spent the next six years in exile in Switzerland.\n\n.\n\nDuring this time Leopold's popularity was hotly divided. The folks in Flanders liked the guy. Of course, they were not mistreated by the occupying German forces. On the other hand, the folks in Wallonia, where atrocities abound, King Leopold III was considered a cad. On 12 March 1950 the Belgians put it to a vote (the Royal Question) whether or not the King should return. He won by a narrow margin.\n\n.\n\nHowever, Leopoldâs arrival in Belgium was followed by unrest. The vocal minority held violent demonstrations. Labor Unions went on a massive strike. The whole country was in an uproar (in one way or another) and it seemed a civil war unavoidable. That is until King Leopold III transferred the royal powers to his eldest son, Baudouin. In July 1951, Leopold formally abdicated.\n\n.\n\nBeing king (and staying king) sure is difficult.\n\n.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGordon Lee"
