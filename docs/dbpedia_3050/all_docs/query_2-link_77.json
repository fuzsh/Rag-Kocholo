        "text": "Details\n\nRare signed letter embossed in gold with the Thai royal arms, dated 22nd October 1952 to King Badouin of Belgium informing him on the birth of Maha Vajiralongkorn, Crown Prince of Thailand (born 28th July 1952. The letter is signed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej (born 5 December 1927), the King of Thailand. He is also known as Rama IX, as he is the ninth monarch of the Chakri Dynasty. Having reigned since 9 June 1946, he is the world's longest-serving current head of state and the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history, serving for 69 years, 10 days.\n\nKing Bhumibol is respected and revered by most Thais. In 1957, the overthrow of his then government was justified with allegations of lÃ¨se majestÃ©, which is offence against the dignity of the monarch, punishable under Thai law. Although Bhumibol did invite public criticism in a 2005 speech, the lÃ¨se majestÃ© laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament.\n\nForbes estimated Bhumibol's fortuneâincluding property and investments managed by the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), a unique body that is neither private nor government-ownedâto be US$30 billion in 2010, and he was the leader of the magazine's list of \"The World's Richest Royals\" from 2008 to 2013. In May 2014, Bhumibol's wealth was once again listed as US$30 billion. Officially the assets managed by the CPB are owned by the crown as an institution, not Bhumibol Adulyadej as an individual.\n\nMaha Vajiralongkorn, Crown Prince of Thailand (born 28 July 1952) is the only son of Bhumibol Adulyadej, the King of Thailand, and Queen Sirikit. He is the current Crown Prince of Thailand and heir apparent to the throne.\n\nIn 1972, at the age of 20, the king gave him the title \"Somdech Phra Boroma Orasadhiraj Chao Fah Maha Vajiralongkorn Sayam Makutrajakuman\", making him the Crown Prince and heir apparent to the throne. He later graduated from the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia. An officer in the Thai military, he trained with the Australian, British and United States armed services. He is a qualified military pilot and helicopter pilot. He took an active part in military operations against the Communist Party of Thailand during the 1970s.\n\nSize: 25 x 21 cm approx"
