        "text": "BRUSSELS, June 28—Di vided Belgium needs the mon archy, as a former Socialist Premier, Achille van Acker, once observed, as it needs bread.\n\nIn Baudouin, fifth King of the Belgians, it has a sov ereign who has restored a sedate dignity to the office and has become a focal point of national loyalties. A constitutional monarch like Queen Juliana of the Netherlands or Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, he reigns without ruling. Yet with a certain acuity, and with a sense of where he can make a contribution, he is playing a prominent role in one of the most important sectors of Belgian foreign pol icy, relations with the Congo.\n\nMan in the News\n\nThe 39‐year‐old King and his wife, Queen Fabiola, have been given a rapturous wel come in the former colony, where they are on a state visit to help celebrate the 10th year of its independence on Tuesday.\n\nWhen not playing roles of state, Baudouin is a tinkerer who loves to take auto en gines apart, and an amateur pilot. A tall, gaunt, shy man who once wanted to be a Trappist monk, he is a sov ereign who shuns cultural events except for the gala oc casions but who brims with pleasure when Eddy Merckx, the bicycle‐racing champion, presents a gift of a sweat shirt.\n\nIn a country where French speaking Walloons and Dutch‐speaking Flemings are constantly at each other's throats, the King—himself member of the German house of Coburg—speaks both lan guages flawlessly and main tains the strictest impartiality.\n\nStrong Sense of Duty\n\nThe King's sense of duty has brought him some phy sical discomfort. Five years ago, before a state visit to Latin America, he decided that the glasses he had been wearing since childhood cre ated an obstacle between him and the public and ordered the fitting of contact lenses. It was a while before new photographs were taken be cause court officials were un sure of his determination to go through with it. But he is now a monarch without glasses.\n\nSome Belgians believe that perhaps his greatest achieve ment is the removal of the monarchy from politics. When he was crowned two dec ades ago, the dispute over his father, King Leopold HI, had the country in turmoil and the demonstrations ri valed current civil disturb ances in the United States.\n\nThe monarchy is free from all criticism now and 46 one complains about his pay. The Treasury gives him the gquiv alent of $1.2‐million a year, not only for personal expen ses but also for the charges arising from ceremonial du ties such as state dinners.\n\nThe Treasury also main tains palaces in midtown Brussels where he works— arriving between 9 and 10 in the morning like an ordinary businessman—and at Laeken, on the capital's northern fringes, where he lives. He also maintains retreats—a country house in Limbourg Province and another in Spain, the Queen's native land.\n\nDramatic Reconciliation\n\nThe King's trip to the Congo is typical of his ac tivities. He is visiting a couri try that has gone through an agonizing decade of inde pendence, marked by blood shed, expropriation and vili fication directed against its former colonial masters. Bel gium shares some of the re sponsibility for this, having trained few administrators to take over in the postcolonial period.\n\nDespite the scars, there has been a dramatic reconcilia tion of late, brought about both by economic forces and by the personal popularity of Baudouin in the Congo.\n\nHe has always taken an active interest there. He made two visits before indepen dence, was the man who an nounced the Government's decision to quit the colony and then on June 30, 1960— despite apprehensions in Brussels: over his safety— handed over sovereignty in ceremonies in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa).\n\nOn the way to the Parlia ment building, riding in an open Mercedes, the King had his ceremonial sword snatch ed from Its scabbard by one of the, more enthusiastic spectators, who was swiftly apprehended. He later teped unflinchingly to an in suiting speech‐ by the new Piemiet, Patrice Lurnumba.\n\nIt is often said that Presi det Joseph D. Mobutu pre fers dealing with Belgium through her King; to whom he can talk as one human being to another, rather than through the administrative hierarchy. They are the same age and are considered friends.\n\nWhen General Mobutu came to Belgium on a private visit MI 1968, the King invited him to stay at Laeken, an honor accorded few visiting dignitaries. When the gen eral's wife, Antoinette, gave birth to their seventh child here last month, Queen Fabi ola was the first well‐wisher.\n\nKing Baudouin's personal influence as a peacemaker, which has helped restore Bel gium's economic interest in the mineral‐rich former col ony, caps a career that be gan inauspiciously.\n\nWaiting for the Germans\n\n“Seldom has a monarch as sumed his responsibilities with less enthusiasm than did young King Baudouin. Seldom too has a monarch made this lack of enthusiasm more apparent.” Theo Aronson's words from the book “The Coburgs of Belgium” sum up the way things were after the abdication of Leopold III in 1951 as a result of contro versy over his wartime role.\n\nLeopold waited for the Germans at Laeken in 1940 And remained there until 1944 with his two sons and his daughter. During that pe riod he met and married his second‐ wife, a commoner, Liliane Baels, daughter of a wealthy Flemish shipowner. His first wife, Queen Astrid, Baudouin's mother, died in 1935 in an accident in which Leopold was the driver.\n\nBaudouin Albert Charles Leopold Axel Marie Gustave —the first name, the French for Baldwin, is pronounced bode‐WANN, to rhyme with bold man—was born at Brus sels on Sept. 7, 1930, and educated by private tutors and in private Swiss schools."
