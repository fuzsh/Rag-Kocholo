        "text": "In the Middle Ages, the accounting chambers originated from the curia regis, the king’s immediate entourage, which assisted him in managing his territory and ruling the kingdom. Because the questions to be dealt with became more and more complex, specialised bodies were gradually set up from the curia regis: the Prince’s Council, the Parliament and the Chamber of Audit.\n\nIn 1190, the French King Philip Augustus determined by ordinance that the public authorities’ accounts had to be submitted to the king. In 1256, Saint Louis confirmed the role of the king’s sovereign auditors who were given a separate room in the courthouse as from 1303: the Chamber of Audit. The Chamber of Audit was set up as a distinct royal institution for the first time in 1319-1320 by King Philip V the Tall (Ordinance of Vivier-en-Brie).\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the need for an institution supervising the State’s finances also arose in the County of Flanders, an economically important area. Louis of Nevers, Count of Flanders, called on masters of accounts around 1320. His successors continued this practice.\n\nThe location where the Court of Audit’s offices are situated today was inhabited in the Middle Ages. The area of the Place des Bailles with the palace of the Dukes of Brabant exerted a special attraction on the aristocracy, who came to settle in this region.\n\nIn 1407, Willem Blondeel’s dwelling house was located there. He was the counsellor and chamberlain of Antoine of Burgundy, whom Philip the Bold had entrusted with governing Brabant.\n\nUnder the inspiration of the governor-general Charles of Lorraine, the area was entirely rebuilt in neoclassical style from September 1774 following a plan by architect Barnabé Guimard de Larabe (1734-1805) and on the model of the Place Stanislas in Nancy.\n\nMadame de Templeuve, dowager and sister of the last Count of Tirimont, also contributed to this renovation work by having the Flemish style house (with staired gabels etc.) transformed into a neoclassical mansion in 1755-80 which, on the outside at least, has not changed to this day.\n\nIn 1796, as part of an inheritance, Tirimont House came into the possession of Marquis Paul Arconati-Visconti, the last Count of Tirimont’s nephew who became the Mayor of Brussels in 1800, and then of his nephew Joseph and finally of John Arconati, a descendant of another family branch. He rents it out to the city of Brussels which, from 1834 to 1839, makes it the Ministry of War, and from 1861 to 1866, the Royal Atheneum old humanities department.\n\nAfter the independence of Belgium, the Provisional Government held elections for a National Congress on 3 November 1830. One of the first measures taken by the Congress consisted in the creation of a Belgian Court of Audit by decree of 30 December 1830. A new institutional logic inspired this institution. The Court withdrew from the executive branch’s influence and essentially became a parliamentary body: parliament appointed the Court’s members who, in turn, carried out their audits on behalf of the parliament. The Court of Audit’s competences were enshrined in article 116 of the Constitution, promulgated on 7 February 1831.\n\nIn 1866, Leopold I’s younger son, Philip, Count of Flanders (1837-1905), bought Arconati-Visconti House on the eve of his marriage with Princess Mary von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1845-1912).\n\nThe princely couple undertook major alteration and extension works under the guidance of architects Gustave Saintenoy (1832-1892) and Clément Parent (1823-1884).\n\nThe interior of the north wing, which dated back to the 18th century, was altered and modernised; the central building and a south wing were added. For the interior decoration, the Count of Flanders took advice from the painter John Portaels (1818-1895)."
