For information concerning the period prior to that date, see history of the Low Countries.\n\nAfter the Burgundian regime in the Low Countries (1363–1477), the southern provinces (whose area roughly encompassed that of present-day Belgium and Luxembourg) as well as the northern provinces (whose area roughly corresponded to that of the present-day Kingdom of the Netherlands) had dynastic links with the Austrian Habsburgs and then with Spain and the Austrian Habsburgs together. Later, as a consequence of revolt in 1567, the southern provinces became subject to Spain (1579), then to the Austrian Habsburgs (1713), to France (1795), and finally in 1815 to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. While Luxembourg remained linked to the Netherlands until 1867, Belgium’s union with the Netherlands ended with the 1830 revolution. Belgian nationality is generally considered to date from this event. Throughout the long period of foreign rule, the southern part of the Low Countries generally preserved its institutions and traditions, and only for a short interval, under the First French Republic and Napoleon, could integration with an alien system be enforced.\n\nThe Burgundian period, from Philip II (the Bold) to Charles the Bold, was one of political prestige and economic and artistic splendour. The “Great Dukes of the West,” as the Burgundian princes were called, were effectively considered national sovereigns, their domains extending from the Zuiderzee to the Somme. The urban and other textile industries, which had developed in the Belgian territories since the 12th century, became under the Burgundians the economic mainstay of northwestern Europe.\n\nThe death of Charles the Bold (1477) and the marriage of his daughter Mary to the archduke Maximilian of Austria proved fatal to the independence of the Low Countries by bringing them increasingly under the sway of the Habsburg dynasty. Mary and Maximilian’s grandson Charles became king of Spain as Charles I in 1516 and Holy Roman emperor as Charles V in 1519. In Brussels on October 25, 1555, Charles V abdicated the Netherlands to his son, who in January 1556 assumed the throne of Spain as Philip II.\n\nThe Spanish Netherlands\n\nUnder Spanish rule, discontent increased in the Netherlands and revolution broke out in 1567, but the union between the south and the north could not be maintained after the first years of conflict.\n\nThe formation of the Union of Arras (January 6, 1579) by the conservative Catholic provinces of Artois and Hainaut (fearing the dominance of more urban, more commercial, and therefore more progressive provinces) enabled the Spanish commander Alessandro Farnese to resume war against the rebellious Protestants. William I (of Orange) emerged as the leader of the latter group, supported by the Union of Utrecht (January 23, 1579), and rallied the numerous provinces that opposed a return to Spanish rule. After a series of sieges, however, Farnese made himself master of many towns in the southern part of the country and finally, on August 17, 1585, recaptured Antwerp, which had closed its gates to rebels and government forces alike. Antwerp’s surrender incited the still resisting northern provinces to close the Schelde River to foreign shipping. From this time onward, the whole of the southern part of the Netherlands once more recognized Philip II as its sovereign. In 1598 Philip II granted the sovereignty of the Netherlands to his daughter Isabella Clara Eugenia and her husband, Archduke Albert VII of Austria.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nThe United Provinces of the north, also known as the Dutch Republic, were never recovered, and in 1609 Albert was even forced to join them in a 12-year truce. He died in 1621, the same year that the war was resumed. Isabella was, from that time on, nothing more than a governor-general. During the resumed course of the war (1621–48), the region to the east of the Meuse, northern Brabant, and Zeeland were lost. Philip IV of Spain agreed to the new northern boundary of the Spanish Netherlands in the Peace of Westphalia (1648). Hostilities between France and Spain persisted, marked by further losses of territory on the southern border (Artois in 1640 and parts of Flanders in the later 17th century).\n\nAdministration\n\nThe government of the Spanish Netherlands, though not independent, enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. A governor-general, usually a member of the Spanish royal family, represented the king in Brussels. Local leaders held most positions on the three councils that assisted the governor (the Council of State, the Privy Council, and the Council of Finances). The president of the Privy Council became a kind of prime minister; although holders of this office did not hesitate to show independence of Madrid in order to protect their interests, they remained supporters of absolutism, regularly asserting the authority of the royal government at the expense of regional and local rights. After 1664 the Council of Finances, under its chief official, the treasurer-general, began to function as a sort of ministry of economic affairs. The councils exercised considerable autonomy domestically. With respect to foreign policy, however, they were controlled less by the governor-general than by a Spanish official in Brussels called the secretary of state and war. In Madrid there was a council of state for the Netherlands made up of natives of the Belgian provinces.\n\nThe bishopric of Liège (in present-day eastern Belgium) was ruled as a separate principality by its prince-bishops, as had been the case since the Middle Ages. During the revolt against Spain, Liège maintained a strict neutrality and continued to do so through most of the 17th and 18th centuries. Its institutional development paralleled that of the neighbouring regions.\n\nThe most important of various representative bodies in the Spanish Netherlands were the provincial estates or assemblies. Their authority to levy and collect taxes enabled them to ensure that a considerable portion of the revenue was spent within the country. A permanent deputation drawn from the estates supervised public works. The States General, consisting of delegates from all the provincial estates, had enjoyed great influence before and during the revolt against Spain. From that time their role diminished, and after 1632 the States General no longer met. Regionalism, deep-rooted in the provinces during the 16th century, gave way in the 17th century to a wider unity. The aristocratic provincial governors revolted against the government’s centralizing policy in the early 1630s but were forced to flee the country for lack of urban support. By 1700 only Hainaut, Luxembourg, Namur, Limburg, and south Gelderland, all of which had proved their loyalty, still had provincial governors.\n\nThe supreme authority in judicial matters was the Great Council of Malines, founded in 1504. This body, however, had to defend its jurisdiction against the encroachments of the Privy Council. The provincial courts of justice were the councils of Flanders, Brabant, Namur, Luxembourg, southern Gelderland, Hainaut, and Artois (until 1659). The unique autonomy of the Council of Brabant had been granted by the king in conformity with the provincial liberties of that region. Nevertheless, after 1603 the king was represented in Brabant by financial officials under a procurer-general. In addition to their judicial duties, all these magistrates had increasing administrative functions.\n\nNearly constant warfare made the administration of the country increasingly difficult. Foreign troops manned the fortresses of Antwerp, Ghent, Ostend, and Charleroi, and other armed forces were raised locally. Government finances, weakened by the loss of revenues from the northern provinces, suffered still further from the enormous military expenditures.\n\nEconomic developments\n\nThe revolt against Spain in 1567 and the military campaigns it provoked in the following years were detrimental to industrial activity in the southern provinces. Moreover, the Spanish reconquest of the territory caused a major emigration of merchants and skilled artisans. Amsterdam replaced Antwerp as the chief trading centre of Europe. Many towns facing industrial decline reacted by restructuring their economic bases. Antwerp fostered new enterprises in silk weaving, diamond processing, and the production of fine linen, furniture, and lace; in addition, it resuscitated many old export products, such as musical instruments, tapestries, embroidery, and brass. Although English competition had crippled the Flemish woolen industry, Ghent developed a specialization in luxury fabrics, and Brugge in cloth for everyday use.\n\nFrom the end of the 16th century on, import and export duties provided a new source of revenue. Taxes on foreign trade originated from permits allowing commerce with the rebellious United Provinces of the north. By the middle of the 17th century, these taxes had become real customs tariffs. The financial problems of the government also made the sale of public offices a common practice.\n\nThe commercial revitalization of the southern Low Countries, particularly of Antwerp, was gradual, but it no doubt partly explains the flourishing artistic life during the period. This was chiefly evident in the works of the Flemish school of 17th-century painters—among them Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, and Jacob Jordaens. The ongoing Counter-Reformation stimulated demand for art in the triumphant Baroque style. Rubens, court painter to Isabella and Archduke Albert, made Antwerp one of the cultural capitals of Europe. In the area of scholarship, the Bollandists, a group of Antwerp Jesuits, made valuable contributions to historical methodology.\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia (1648), which ended the Eighty Years’ War between Spain and the Dutch and the German phase of the Thirty Years’ War, stimulated economic competition between the countries of northern Europe. As a result, Flemish textile manufacture once again shifted from the towns to the countryside, where production costs were lower. In addition, the burgeoning bureaucracies and new mercantilist policies of rival capitals attracted many Flemish artisans. Emerging fashions abroad, particularly the Enlightenment Classicism and colonial exoticism of France and England, were soon to overtake the Baroque style of the Spanish Netherlands.\n\nThe Austrian Netherlands\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish Habsburg dynasty died out with Charles II, and a new conflict with France arose. By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), ending the War of the Spanish Succession, the territory comprising present-day Belgium and Luxembourg (the independent principality of Liège not included) passed under the sovereignty of the Holy Roman emperor Charles VI, head of the Austrian branch of the house of Habsburg.\n\nUnder the Austrians, as under the Spanish Habsburgs, the southern Netherlands enjoyed political autonomy. The Austrian government initially modernized the Spanish institutions internally by introducing a new working spirit and more efficient administrative methods. To a greater degree than under Spanish rule, appointments to public offices depended upon competence and dedication. Apart from attempting to subject the provinces and the class-ridden society to absolute imperial power, the Austrian government focused in particular on rationalizing public finances at all levels, on the formation of a dynamic well-documented bureaucracy, and on the improvement of the country’s infrastructure.\n\nEmperor Charles VI attempted to relieve the economic distress in the southern Netherlands by founding the Ostend Company (1722) to trade with Asia, but England and the United Provinces forced him after a few years to abandon the project. At the death of Charles VI in 1740, the southern Netherlands passed to his daughter Maria Theresa. The War of the Austrian Succession, however, resulted in a new French occupation in 1744. Austrian rule was restored by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).\n\nThe regime of the empress Maria Theresa of Austria enjoyed popularity as the economic situation began to improve again toward the middle of the 18th century. As in contemporary England, an increase in agricultural productivity stimulated a population increase, especially in rural areas. This, in turn, spurred the development of various industries. The agricultural transformation occurred mainly on the small farms of Flanders; one of its main features was the spread of potato cultivation, which added an important element to the diet of the rural population. In addition, in the French-speaking part of the country, a number of landed proprietors invested in mining enterprises, notably in the area between the Sambre and the Meuse rivers, which belonged to the principality of Liège. In the southern Netherlands, urban merchants and manufacturers had more in common with the rural landowning class than was usual in continental European countries in the 18th century. As in the case of Britain, this created an atmosphere favourable to the development of industrial capitalism. During this period Ghent, Antwerp, and Tournai had factories with more than 100 workers; wages, however, were poor. Verviers, in the principality of Liège, was an important centre for woolen manufactures, Ghent for cotton goods.\n\nAfter 1750 the influence of the Enlightenment permeated government policy in the domains of demography, social relief, employment, public health, education, religion, culture, and art, mainly at the expense of the Roman Catholic Church. Religious suppression and administrative reforms, sponsored by Maria Theresa’s son and successor, the emperor Joseph II, caused great dissatisfaction among the upper classes. The Austrian government was no longer inclined to maintain the remnants of feudal privilege. Reforms deepened to include replacement of the traditional provinces and their aristocracies by districts and newly appointed intendants. The proposal to suppress simultaneously the central councils and the provincial courts of justice constituted a clear threat to provincial autonomy. The governor-general of the Austrian Netherlands was reluctant to enforce the edicts involved, but other leading members of the administration, including the emperor’s minister plenipotentiary, insisted upon the abolishment of the traditional bodies.\n\nIn 1789, stirred by the outbreak of revolution in neighbouring France, conservatives led by Henri van der Noot and progressives led by Jean-François Vonck united in opposition to the emperor and defeated an Austrian force at Turnhout. After their common victory, conservatives and progressives came into conflict. The conservatives, or Statists, in the end gained the upper hand and made a triumphant entry into Brussels. This “Brabant Revolution” (so called because most of its leaders came from Brabant) had widespread support in the towns. The peasants, on the other hand, had little in common with the middle-class revolutionaries and generally supported the Austrians. Thus, when Leopold II, successor to Joseph II, decided to reestablish imperial authority in 1790, he encountered no opposition from the mass of the people. On December 2, 1790, imperial troops reoccupied Brussels. The discontented Statists now looked to revolutionary France for support, but enthusiasm waned when it became clear that a French military victory was the prelude to annexation. On October 1, 1795, the French National Convention voted to annex the southern Netherlands and the principality of Liège, where a revolution against the prince-bishop had prepared the country for assimilation into the French Republic. Thenceforth, the territory of Liège was amalgamated with the Belgian provinces.\n\nFrench administration\n\nUnder French rule there was no autonomy as there had been under the Spanish and Austrian regimes. The administration was centralized, aristocratic privileges abolished, and the church persecuted. Military conscription measures provoked a peasants’ revolt (1798–99), but repression was extremely harsh. Under the Napoleonic consulate and empire (1799–1814), the position of the clergy was regulated by a concordat with the papacy. Further changes included introduction of the French civil code and the decimal metric system and the reopening of the Schelde River to maritime traffic to and from the harbour of Antwerp.\n\nThe period of the Napoleonic empire may be considered the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Belgium. Only at the very end of the 18th century, with the prospects of a wider market and under Napoleon’s encouragement, did mechanization (i.e., the Industrial Revolution in its strictest sense) begin in the textile sector. Mechanization quickly made Ghent, with its cotton mills, and Verviers, with its woolen industry, the leading textile centres of the country. The coal and metal industries of Hainaut (under French rule, the département of Jemappes) and Liège also flourished. From the beginning of the 18th century, the coal industry had expanded production with the help of the Newcomen pump and systematically extended its export markets to France. Annexation of the Belgian provinces by France opened the market still further, hastening the modernization process in which Belgium already led the continent.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon, the Allied powers were determined not to leave the Belgian territories in the hands of France. Under the influence of Great Britain, it was decided that the territories would be united in a single state with the old republic of the United Provinces, thus to constitute a better barrier against French expansion than that of 1715. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, the existence of which was confirmed by the Congress of Vienna (June 1815), was thus established for the convenience of Europe, regardless of the wishes of the Belgians and the Dutch. Prince William of Orange ascended the throne on March 16, 1815, under the title William I; he was crowned September 27.\n\nThe two parts of the Netherlands, which had been one country until the 16th century and were now reunited, had developed in markedly different ways during the two intervening centuries. The north was commercial and the south increasingly industrial; the north was Protestant and Flemish- (Dutch-) speaking and the south Roman Catholic and partly French-speaking (the elite was entirely French-speaking). Under the Dutch house of Orange, the north was to be predominant. Dutch, sometimes called Netherlandic, became the official language of the new kingdom; moreover, the fundamental law gave Belgium and Holland the same number of representatives in the States General, in spite of the fact that the population of Belgium was nearly twice that of the former United Provinces. Belgian representatives, members of the nobility, rejected the constitution, but it was promulgated by the king over their objections.\n\nWilliam I encouraged the industrialization of the south, commissioning the construction of new roads and canals and the establishment of new commercial and financial companies; he also extended subsidies to promising industrial enterprises, frequently from his own private fortune. In the beginning, the favourable economic situation reinforced the king’s popularity among the middle class. The mechanized textile industries of Ghent and Verviers continued their progress, while the modern coal mines and forges of Liège and Hainaut prospered. Antwerp’s role as an international port was expanding rapidly.\n\nKing William I also created three state universities: Ghent and Liège, which were new, and Louvain, which he put under state control to remove it from Catholic influence. Secular academies (athénées) were established at the secondary level, and state inspection was mandated for church-controlled schools. An attempt to interfere with the curriculum of the training schools for priests (1825) brought clerical dissatisfaction with the government to its height. In an effort to disengage the Protestant monarch from the religious affairs of the south, the clergy and traditional Catholic elite began clamouring for freedom of religion, education, and association. This remarkable shift in mentality within the ranks of the southern conservatives was welcomed by the more progressive merchants, who in their turn had grown more critical toward the north and the king’s policy.\n\nAfter 1821 the conflicting interests of north and south also created an economic split. The commercial north, having little industry, desired more free trade; the industrial south sought greater tariff protection in order to compete against falling British export prices. The king’s unwillingness to increase protection gave the industrialists a grievance against the government. Progressives and clericals now joined forces. Both groups wanted to curtail the personal power of the king in favour of a true parliamentary system, based on an expanded range of civil and political rights. In this new climate, Unionism came into being in 1827, merging young Catholics and liberals in the south into a strong antigovernment coalition. The king agreed to make concessions regarding matters of religion and language but refused to relinquish his ultimate authority. This refusal generated the “Belgian Revolution” of August–September 1830, in the tracks of the July Revolution in Paris the same year.\n\nThe revolutionaries at first demanded separate administrations for the northern and southern Netherlands. The actions of the radical patriots in Liège, however, soon aggravated the situation. The unyielding attitude of the king now led to a complete break. On September 25 a provisional Belgian government was established, and on October 4 it proclaimed the country’s independence, a move reaffirmed by the newly elected National Congress on November 10. William I prepared for war, but on December 20 the great powers intervened, imposing an armistice on both sides. On January 20, 1831, an international conference in London (under the influence of the new liberal governments in France and Britain) recognized Belgium as an independent, neutral state, its neutrality to be guaranteed by the European powers."
