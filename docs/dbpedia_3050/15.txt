Biography

Belgian royalty, the first born son of King Leopold III and Princess Astrid. His mom was killed in an auto accident just before he was five. At nine, he fled with his family to Portugal during the time of the German invasion, but returned to live under guard during the Nazi occupation. Post-war, he completed his schooling in Switzerland and returned to Belgium to assume his title. His coronation occurred on 17 July 1951 when his dad abdicated the throne.

Baudouin married Fabiola de Mora y Aragon, the daughter of a Spanish Count; they were childless.

Baudouin reigned for 42 years and was a reclusive monarch. He was shy, avoided the glitter and was seldom seen in public. He was not fond of politics, and had once wanted to be a Trappist monk. After two years of ill health, he died of a heart attack on 31 July 1993 while vacationing in Spain. His 59 year-old brother Albert took over the throne.
