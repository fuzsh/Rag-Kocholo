        "meta_description": "The Catholic Church’s teachings on Mary and the Eucharist are grounded in two statements made by Jesus in the final hours and moments before his death: “Behold your Mother” and “Do This in Memory of Me.” Each of these represent missions given on the Church by Christ, and they contribute to the nature and life of the Church in essential ways. This talk will reflect upon the gifts of Mary and the Eucharist in the life of the Church, considering especially how they are radical expressions of God’s love for us. The talk concludes with meditations upon several scriptural passages and works of art that communicate beautifully the interrelationship of Mary and the Eucharist in the heart of the Church.",
