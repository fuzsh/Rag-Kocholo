He is the patron saint of mountaineers, skiing, snowboarding, backpacking and the Alps. He also gave his name to the Saint Bernard breed of dog, originally bred for the cold environment of the hospice.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nSt. Bernard was born around 1020 in the Château de Menthon, near Annecy, in the County of Savoy, a part of the Kingdom of Burgundy. He was descended from a rich and noble family and received a thorough education in Paris. He decided to devote himself to the service of the Church and refused an honorable marriage proposed by his father. According to legend, he had to sneak out of the castle on the night before an arranged wedding, and was miraculously caught by angels when he jumped from his window.\n\nHe placed himself under the direction of Peter, the Archdeacon of Aosta, under whose guidance he rapidly progressed in learning and virtue. He was ordained a priest and worked as a missionary in the mountain villages. Later, he was appointed to succeed his mentor as archdeacon of the cathedral, giving him charge of the government of the diocese, directly under the bishop.\n\nMinistry and Miracles\n\nFor 42 years, he continued to preach the Gospel to these people and even into many cantons of Lombardy, effecting numerous conversions and working many miracles. He was known for his eloquence, charity, zeal and holiness. He also reconciled many feuds and disputes among the nobles and peasants.\n\nThe last act of St. Bernard’s life was the reconciliation of two noblemen whose strife threatened a fatal outcome. He died in June 1081 in Novara and was interred in the monastery of St. Lawrence.\n\nSt Bernard’s Passes and Hospice\n\nSince ancient times there has been a path across the Pennine Alps leading from the Aosta Valley to the Swiss canton of Valais. The traditional route of this pass is covered with perpetual snow and drifts, and is extremely dangerous, especially in the springtime on account of avalanches. It was often used by French and German pilgrims on their way to Rome.\n\nIn his office as archdeacon, St. Bernard had the charge of caring for the poor and travelers. For their convenience and protection, he founded a canonry and hostel at the highest point of the pass, 8,000 feet above sea-level, in 1050, at the site which has come to bear his name: The Great St Bernard Pass. He also founded another hospice at a lower altitude on another pass that connects Italy with Switzerland: The Little St Bernard Pass.\n\nThe hospices were staffed by canons regular who followed St. Augustine’s rule and dedicated themselves to hospitality and charity. They also rescued travelers who were lost or buried in snowstorms with the help of dogs trained to find them. These dogs became known as Saint Bernards.\n\nCanonization and Legacy\n\nSt. Bernard was venerated as a saint soon after his death by popular acclaim. He was officially canonized by Pope Innocent XI in 1681. His feast day is May 28 in most calendars, but June 15 in Switzerland.\n\nSt. Bernard is regarded as one of the most illustrious saints of Savoy and one of the greatest benefactors of humanity in history. His hospices have served millions of travelers for nearly a thousand years and still operate today under his name and patronage.\n\nPrayers to St. Bernard of Montjoux\n\nPrayer of Intercession to St. Bernard of Montjoux\n\nDear St. Bernard, you who were a man of deep faith and great intelligence, I ask for your intercession as I seek to grow in my own faith and understanding.
