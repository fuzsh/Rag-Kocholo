        "text": "While writing up the post about Jesus‚Äô genealogy the other day, I started wondering about Mary‚Äôs. I found this article, which sort of blew my mind: Why isn‚Äôt Joachim mentioned in Jesus‚Äô genealogy?\n\nBasically, the idea is that the genealogy as listed in the Gospel of Matthew (the one I referred to in my Jesus‚Äô genealogy post) is believed to be that of Joseph, which shows Jesus‚Äô legal lineage, and his claim to the throne of David through his legal father. The genealogy presented in the Gospel of Luke, however, which is different than Matthew‚Äôs, is argued by some to be that of Mary, which shows Jesus‚Äô natural lineage, and his claim to the throne of David through blood.\n\n!!!!\n\nOne of things I found most fascinating is that some of the Church‚Äôs Big Thinkers argue that Mary and Joseph may have been first cousins. I‚Äôd never heard that before!\n\n‚ÄúMany of the Fathers maintained that Jacob and Heli [see below for more on Heli ‚Äî he‚Äôs listed as Joseph‚Äôs father in Luke, as opposed to the Jacob listed in Matthew] were brothers and that, after Heli died childless (or, at least, without any sons), Jacob took Heli‚Äôs widow for his wife. Of her was born St. Joseph. Hence, according to the flesh, Joseph would be the son of Jacob only; but, according to legal right of inheritance, Joseph would be the son of Heli also. This explanation is certainly plausible, and enjoys the favor of many scholastic doctors as well (including St. Thomas Aquinas) ‚Ä¶\n\nIf Heli is Joachim [see below for more on that], then we may presume that Joachim died without any sons. Joachim‚Äôs widow (presumably, a second wife other than St. Anne) would have married Jacob and bore him St. Joseph.‚Äù\n\nSo to answer the question posed in the article title, and alluded to in the quote above, another theory is that the Heli that‚Äôs listed as Joseph‚Äôs father in Luke actually refers to his father-in-law, Joachim:\n\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ we may follow the opinion of other scholars who maintained that Jacob (Joseph‚Äôs father) had died young and that Joseph became a quasi-adopted son of Heli/Joachim through his marriage to the Virgin ‚Äì for this reason, then, Joseph is called son of Heli.\n\nWhatever the intricate details, the central claim of this theory is that Joachim was called Heli and that this ‚Äúnick-name‚Äù would have been common knowledge to those for whom St. Luke was writing. This opinion is said to have been held by St. Jerome, and is defended with great vigor by Fr. Cornelius a‚Äô Lapide. It was a common opinion that enjoyed the favor of many scholars from at least the 1400s up through the early 1900s ‚Ä¶\n\nWe argue that Heli and Joachim are linguistically related, such that it would be very natural for a single man to go by these two names. Joachim seems to be a variant form of Eliacim, which is abbreviated as Eli, a variant of Heli. Hence, though the two names may at first appear quite different, there is a great linguistic similarity between Heli and Joachim.\n\nIn any case, there are many persons in the New Testament who are called by multiple names: Nathanael is called Bartholomew, Thomas is called Didymus, Cleophas is called both Clepas and Alphaeus (though this last is more debatable), Salome is called Mary (her full name being Mary Salome), et c.‚Äù\n\nThis is the genealogy as listed in Luke 3:23-38:\n\n[God] (those in brackets were not listed in Matthew ‚Äî he starts with Abraham)\n\n[Adam]\n\n[Seth]\n\n[Enos]\n\n[Cainan]\n\n[Mahalaleel]\n\n[Jared]\n\n[Enoch]\n\n[Methuselah]\n\n[Lamech]\n\n[Noah]\n\n[Shem]\n\n[Arphaxad]\n\n[Cainan]\n\n[Shelah]\n\n[Eber]\n\n[Peleg]\n\n[Reu]\n\n[Serug]\n\n[Nahor]\n\n[Terah]\n\nAbraham\n\nIsaac\n\nJacob\n\nJudah\n\nPerez\n\nHezron\n\nArni (Ram in Matthew)\n\nAdmin (missing in Matthew ‚Äî maybe this was an admin mistake when transcribing? üòÄ )\n\nAmminadab\n\nNahshon\n\nSala (Salmon in Matthew)\n\nBoaz\n\nObed\n\nJesse\n\nDavid\n\nNathan (this is where the Lucan genealogy splits off from Matthew‚Äôs)\n\nMattatha\n\nMenna\n\nMelea\n\nEliakim\n\nJonam\n\nJoseph\n\nJudah\n\nSimeon\n\nLevi\n\nMatthat\n\nJorim\n\nEliezer\n\nJoshua\n\nEr\n\nElmadam\n\nCosam\n\nAddi\n\nMelchi\n\nNeri\n\nShealtiel (and picks it back up again)\n\nZerubbabel\n\nRhesa (and diverges again)\n\nJoanan\n\nJoda\n\nJosech\n\nSemein\n\nMattathias\n\nMaath\n\nNaggai\n\nEsli\n\nNahum\n\nAmos\n\nMattathias\n\nJoseph\n\nJannai\n\nMelchi\n\nLevi\n\nMatthat (despite the fact that Matthan is listed here in Matthew, and so I might have presumed it‚Äôs the same guy, the article I cite above says Matthan and Matthat are two different men)\n\nHeli (Jacob listed as Joseph‚Äôs father in Luke)\n\nJoseph\n\nAlso, St. Joseph is listed as eleven generations from Shealtiel in Matthew, while in Luke it‚Äôs twenty.\n\nSo interesting!"
