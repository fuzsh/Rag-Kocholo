        "text": "“All of you, who see yourselves amid the tides of the world, tossed by storms and tempests rather than walking on the land, do not turn your eyes away from this shining star, unless you want to be overwhelmed by the hurricane. If temptation storms, or you fall upon the rocks of tribulation, look to the star: Call upon Mary! If you are tossed by the waves of pride or ambition, detraction or envy, look to the star, call upon Mary. If anger or avarice or the desires of the flesh dash against the ship of your soul, turn your eyes to Mary. If troubled by the enormity of your crimes, ashamed of your guilty conscience, terrified by dread of the judgment, you begin to sink into the gulf of sadness or the abyss of despair, think of Mary. In dangers, in anguish, in doubt, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let her name be even on your lips, ever in your heart; and the better to obtain the help of her prayers, imitate the example of her life: “Following her, thou strayest not; invoking her, thou despairest not; thinking of her, thou wanderest not; upheld by her, thou fallest not; shielded by her, thou fearest not; guided by her, thou growest not weary; favored by her, thou reachest the goal. And thus dost thou experience in thyself how good is that saying: ‘And the Virgin’s name was Mary.’” ~ St. Bernard\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux (b. 1090- d. 1153) was a devotee of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and his words of advice (above) remain timely and pertinent: let us look to the star provided by God for us, our mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThen, we shall experience how good is that saying: “And the Virgin’s name was Mary.” (paraphrase, St. Bernard).\n\nAve Maria!\n\nMay you have a good day.\n\n~SCF\n\nTop image: Vision of St. Bernard with Saints Benedict and John the Baptist, source."
