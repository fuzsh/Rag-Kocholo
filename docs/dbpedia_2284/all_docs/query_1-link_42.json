The Auxiliary, this membership is open to Priest's, religious and lay people who wish to associate themselves with the Legion by undertaking a service of prayer in its name. The rosary is recited daily.\n\nThe Active member also includes the prayer life of the auxiliary membership but continues with work that includes door to door evangelization, parish visitation projects, weekly meetings and any other spiritual needs of the Parish and Community.\n\nAny Catholic, any race, single, married or retired who would like to draw closer to Jesus and His Mother is welcome to give it a try. With Mary ’ s example and prayer, we ’ ll grow as disciples ever faithful to Jesus and ever wanting to reveal him."
