        "text": "Eroticism is a fundamental feature of contemporary Western civilization. This is not clearly recognized by the majority and is thoroughly rejected by elite opinion. To attempt a serious discussion of the matter in the media or in academia would immediately eliminate one from serious consideration. So, today, this truth can only be approached in contexts where it is recognized, which is largely reduced to traditionally religious environments.\n\nThe reaction to the opening ceremonies at the Paris Olympic Games provides a somewhat rare opportunity to see how the theme of eroticism does and does not play out in the current cultural context.\n\nEroticism and culture\n\nFirst, however, some background is necessary in order to situate eroticism’s place in our culture.\n\nTo my mind, no one has explained the role of eroticism in the contemporary high-tech, materialist and consumerist culture better than the late Italian philosopher, Augusto Del Noce, so a brief summary of his thoughts on the subject will help here. For Del Noce, it was in “the decomposition of Marxism” that we find the stage for the culture that developed in the West in light of the deterioration of the Soviet Union.\n\nTwo trends worked simultaneously. On the one hand, the proletarian revolution largely faded out as a real political goal, with working classes everywhere opting for other possibilities. On the other hand, in a move that originally escaped many in the West, the entire notion of freedom was completely undermined by the relativism proclaimed by Marxism. Marxism did not fail so much as break up into two parts, one mostly a failure but the second an astonishing success. For Marxism gave the West the precise kind of relativism it came to adopt, that is, the belief that political and social ideas were mere byproducts of material (specifically economic) conditions; this is what made up Marx’s superstructure of ideas.\n\nSo, for example, bourgeois ideals were really just covers for the real interests, which were the interests of the property-owning class. The original idea was expanded over time to include the more expansive claim that ideas were the byproducts of a broader set of sociological and historical conditions. The further categories of race and gender were introduced in later years. Of course, all these factors were changing, which led to an interpretation of reality as a whole, as a constant state of flux mirrored by a dizzying “development” of corresponding ideas. This led us in the long run to where we are today, with the social sciences and history largely overrun by theories which reduce social reality to one or more members of what I call “the triumvirate”: class, race and gender. Today, you can a doctorate in the social sciences without ever questioning that society is essentially reducible to the current state of relations in these three areas.\n\nWhat happened to the culture in which this massive intellectual shift took place? In the relativist onslaught, class, race and gender replaced the true, the good, and the beautiful.\n\nDel Noce saw three dominant trends emerging: (1) secularization, which corresponded to the loss of belief in any transcendent truth, which clearly cannot exist in this universe of ever-changing flux. It is important to remember that this change was not simply a rejection of revealed religion, but just as importantly it was a rejection of that entire philosophical tradition going back to Plato and ancient Greece, crystallized in the Prologue to John’s Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word.” This belief in an ultimate transcendent source of truth issued in the entire moral tradition of the natural law, which rests on a permanent, transcendent reality. Natural law, too, was jettisoned by the relativist thrust as an alleged schema of class, race, and gender domination; (2) positivism. In the absence of philosophical truth or any philosophy of nature, the only claim to objectivity came to be the empirical, the hard sciences and mathematics. Only science could withstand the relativist battering ram.\n\n(3) Finally, there was eroticism. This was among Del Noce’s most distinctive moves intellectually. Many Christians, of course, noted and lamented the moral decline occasioned by the sexual revolution, but among philosophers Del Noce was perhaps unrivalled in his lifting up eroticism to be a pillar of the civilization as a whole. Even many Christians were influenced by the influences of rationalism and modernity here, particularly in the latter’s’ rejection of original sin and the belief in a fundamental flaw in human nature. Christianity had argued that sexuality was a particularly weak link here, and so subject to special vigilance. The moderns would miss this altogether and eventually scoff at the entire moral edifice Christianity had articulated as “puritanism’ and “repression,” a manifestation of psychopathology.\n\nThe worldviews were polar opposites. It was easy for the moderns to accept a life of sin in the name of the “new normalcy” created by the sexual revolution. Empirically, they were correct as behaviors formerly defined as serious sins indeed became the social norm, even expected. Yet, the old moralists were right all along. Sexuality really is the weakest link in human nature, and when the vigilance collapsed so did the entire moral edifice. So eroticism, the complete reversal of the Sixth Commandment, progressively became a pillar of the new Western culture, aligning perfectly with secularization and positivism. And today we see the inevitable refrains that traditional morality is no more than a series of non-rational taboos entirely unsupported by science.\n\nThe Paris Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThis is the context within which we can best see that what was going on at the Paris Olympics opening ceremony, which was in complete continuity with the eroticism that is already at the heart of Western culture. Most readers are already painfully aware of the details, so I will simply summarize a few points recognized even by the mainstream media. There was a prerecorded element featuring an “androgynous poly throuple” preparing to engage in acts of “casual polyamory,” which manifest a ”liberating queer polycule.” Then there was the widely discussed drag queen portrayal of a hypersexualized The Last Supper, amidst other novelties such as a bearded woman dancing provocatively and a naked smurf with an erection, all with child dancers nearby.\n\nI guess we can all ask when such a display might have landed the practitioners in Western jails. But the larger point is that all of this simply proceeds from philosophical premises already in place in the West: the old order of morality is repressive, particularly to “sexual minorities” who must now be liberated. All the old rules about sexuality are without foundation, even clear distinctions between male and female. Moreover, there is no reason to exclude children from seeing any of this.\n\nThe way the media “covered” the ensuing controversy merits a separate article, so I will be brief here. When people complained, the media immediately turned to those responsible and asked for an explanation. Much of what was said was outright lies. For example, although Thomas Jolly denied there was any attempt to suggest The Last Supper, some of the actors admitted the obvious truth that it was indeed the intended idea. We had the further absurdity that the intended portrayal of the Greek God Dionysius was an attempt to show the folly of violence, unaccompanied by any explanation of how such an interpretation might arise in the mind of a rational person.\n\nAnd of course there was the standard appeal to an undefined “diversity.” How the Greek God Dionysius, the god of frenzy and excess, would be linked in the average mind to civil peace in any context was left unexplained. The biggest takeaway from all of this is that it is now clear that the secular media accept with great seriousness the hypocritical claims of the art world that there really is no such thing as an objective interpretation of a work of art. Of course, this is belied by the obvious fact that the organizers had a very clear message to communicate, which they did. But this claim of relativist interpretation is always pulled out of the hat as the preferred, though dishonest, way of dealing with criticism.\n\nIn the eyes of the media, we were left with two competing interpretations of the parade, without a clear way to resolve the differences, yet the two interpretations were not really equal. If we look further, we see that there is the reading of the educated and sophisticated contemporary art world, which contends that the message is world peace and diversity. Then there are the right-wing, clearly artistically clueless band of angry and out-of-touch Christians who read what they want into things as part of their broader narrative of hate, reaction and frustration at the progress of enlightened France. This is what is left of what used to be called a fair and unbiased mass media.\n\nMoving away from the media discussion back to reality, we can see that what the parade was doing was best summarized by Del Noce in his discussion of eroticism, because here we get to the true intent of the people who organized these vignettes.\n\nThe attack on creation and nature\n\nAt the deepest level, they intend to attack creation itself, the entire notion that the universe indeed was created and that something we used to call nature was the result. These people understand, like their surrealist forebears, that the erotic revolution they propose still faces obstacles in popular culture and will not succeed so long as people maintain their beliefs in creation and nature. If we think of Satan as “the ape of God,” then eroticism is, in the final analysis, nothing less than the attempt to undo the Book of Genesis. There is no God, no creation, and no nature. Eroticism is all about “de-creation,” the undoing of the order God intended through the creation of human sexuality. The portrayal of man in the parade is not man made in the image and likeness of God. These people honor no God beyond their own desires.\n\nYet, as Del Noce says, if we do not believe in creation and do not believe in the order of nature, what can we do with the reality of nature that is in front of us and, frankly, inescapable? All that is left is to rebel against it, to attempt to dissolve it, an ultimately impossible and frustrating attempt covered over by the search to create the kind of frenzied “fusion” of bodies that eroticism proposes. But frenzied sex provides no basis for human happiness or community, as the practitioners always discover.\n\nWe should note here the intended separation of sex from both marriage and procreation. In a sense, the choice of Dionysius, the god of frenzy, was a good choice, because it underlines the proposal for man to find relief from his loneliness through temporary frenzy. The entire person is indeed engaged in an imitation of ecstasy for a moment. This is why, as Del Noce says, that the orgy has always been a “religious” exercise. Black masses have long been accompanied by nakedness and eroticism for a reason. Del Noce reminds us ominously that throughout history the decay of civilization has been accompanied by orgiastic cults. Which is why we must take a firmer stand when the media, the artistic and intellectual classes try to tell us that we have this all wrong, that eroticism is just some innocent fun designed to liberate us from our puritanical hangups, repressions and old patriarchal ideas about sex.\n\nDel Noce quotes Georges Bataille in summary:\n\nThe transition from the normal state to that of erotic desire presupposes a partial dissolution of the person as he exists. . . Paving the way for a fusion where both are mingled. . . The whole business of eroticism is to destroy the self-contained character of the participators, as they are in their normal lives. Stripping naked is the decisive action. Nakedness offers a contrast to self-possession. . . It is a state of communication revealing a quest for a possible continuance of being beyond the confines of the self. Bodies open up to a state of continuity through secret channels that give us a feeling of obscenity. Obscenity is our name for the uneasiness which upsets the physical state associated with self-possession, with the possession of recognized and stable individuality.\n\nBataille was no theologian, not even a Christian, but Del Noce credits him for capturing some important truths about eroticism here. Del Noce writes, by way of commentary:\n\nIf we think about the idea of the devil as simia Dei, it seems that these passages, which define perfectly the essence of eroticism, provide [an] interpretive key for the description of creation and of original sin presented in the first few chapters of the book of Genesis. Indeed, eroticism is the precise opposite: its principle is, so to speak, de-creation, as opposed to creation. Having denied every trace of the divine image within human individuality, the process moves toward dissolution, fusion with totality through the negation of individuality.”\n\nIt still may seem to some that we have here too much of an abstract discussion, with all of this emphasis on the theology of creation, human nature, and self-possession vs. fragmentation. But it is not. At the practical level, the goal of the Paris organizers is the same as that of the older surrealists and earlier proponents of the sexual revolution like Wilhelm Reich: the destruction of the family. Del Noce leaves no ambiguity on the point:\n\nAt the cost of repeating myself, I should insist on some truths that have been almost entirely forgotten. The idea of indissoluble monogamous marriage and other ideas related to it (modesty, purity continence) are linked to the idea of tradition, which in turn presupposes. . . the idea of an objective order of unchangeable and permanent truths (the Platonic True in itself and Good in itself).\n\nWhat is the practical core of this tradition other than the family? It is the family that makes tradition throughout history by passing on tradition from one generation to the next. Here we can see that our enemies are evil—but they are not stupid. They have long understood better than many Christians that the family is the battlefield where all of this is to be fought out. They know that their revolution will be limited if the traditional family stays intact. They know that the revolution they seek cannot co-exist with Christian morality. They have to attack and undermine the family in order to undermine tradition effectively. The family passes on traditional religion, moral codes, and a set of beliefs the opposite of eroticism.\n\nThis is the context in which we need to view what the French organizers are truly up to. They understand the family as the repressive social institution, and that it is inseparable from tradition. In their view, as Del Noce puts it, “Thus, the abolition of every meta-empirical order of truth requires that the family be dissolved.”\n\nFinally, it is interesting to note that a Frenchman who truly deserves to be recalled got bypassed in the kerfuffle: the Marquis de Sade. It was truly De Sade’s night! He would have been proud. De Sade is the father of at least modern eroticism, the particular movement designed to get to the root of things, delink sex from marriage and procreation, with a true aversion to childbirth. He must love France’s current statistics on natality. In De Sade’s universe, there is no God and no creation. Man has an absolute creative power but with no creation to work with, all he can do with his creativity is to attempt to destroy creation, which he and his current followers indeed set out to do. This always included violence for De Sade, but his contemporary followers seem to miss this central point.\n\nIn the final analysis, an attack on God, creation, and nature is what was going on at the Olympic’s opening ceremony, with the intent to further undermine the family and its foundations in the faith of Christians.\n\nEndnotes:\n\nIbid."
