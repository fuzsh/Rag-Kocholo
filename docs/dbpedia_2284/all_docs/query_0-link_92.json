        "text": "BRIDGEPORT – As the summer draws to a close, many parishes are gearing up for a productive school year where their youngest parishioners are concerned. But certain parishes didn’t slow down at all during the dog days of summer, thanks to Foundations in Faith’s mini grant program.\n\nThe mini grant program provides grants between $500 and $2,000 for parishes and programs demonstrating exceptional innovation or exceptional need. They were once only available through the St. John Paul II Fund for Religious Education and Faith Formation, but following a decision made by the foundation’s board of trustees last year, the opportunity opened up to all nine of the foundation’s funds.\n\nOnce the opportunity opened up to all nine funds, demand for mini grants skyrocketed, and 12 ministries applied for and received mini grants last fiscal year.\n\nToward the beginning of summer, Foundations in Faith made a push for religious education and faith formation programs to host engaging and fun new approaches to youth and young adult ministry. One of the mini grants supported St. Aloysius Parish in New Canaan and St. Matthew Church in Norwalk. The two parishes hosted a Summer Mission Day for their teen ministries on July 12, and were also joined by teenagers from St. Francis of Assisi Church in Weston and St. Michael and St. Paul Churches in Greenwich.\n\nAccording to Chris Otis, St. Aloysius’ youth minister, a Summer Mission Day was a wonderful opportunity for teenagers to engage in service and remain close to home. And she and St. Matthew’s youth group director Olivia Buisson were committed to making it happen.\n\n“We had a dream of engaging young people from various parishes together who might not be able to go away for a whole week of service on a summer mission trip,” she said. “Gathering teens together illustrates to them the power of prayer, love and service and that their love can make a huge difference in someone’s life, even if just for a moment.”\n\nThe Summer Mission Day centered on the theme “Love Makes the Difference.” And if that was the theme of the day, the prayer of the day was the Rosary, which the teens committed to praying one decade at a time throughout the day of service.\n\nFollowing morning Mass, icebreakers, a Gospel reflection and lunch, the teens departed St. Matthew for their first worksite: Filling in the Blanks, a non-profit in Norwalk seeking to end childhood hunger. Once they arrived, the group prepared over 1,000 weekend food bags for children eligible for free or reduced lunch.\n\nBut even with such an accomplishment, the day was far from over. Following a small group reflection on the corporal work of mercy they just performed, the group headed to Malta House, a transitional housing program for pregnant women.\n\nThe work at Malta House certainly combined faith and fun. The teenagers hosted a mini carnival and barbecue dinner for the mothers and children of Malta House’s Partnering Success alumni program and community outreach members. And while a carnival might be a commonplace scene during the summer, it meant something much more to Chris Otis, St. Aloysius’ youth minister.\n\n“As I stood back and watched the scene, all I saw was an outpouring of love,” she said. “The teens brought forth smiles and joy from the children as they splashed in water, found triumph in winning a game or had their face painted.”\n\nFollowing cleanup, Deacon William Santulli led an evening prayer in the Malta House chapel, when the teens were able to share their experiences and reflect on the day with their peers. But according to Otis, even if the day had ended, the teens’ mission to live out their faith continued.\n\n“When we ended evening prayer, our challenge to the group was to continue to listen to God’s call and to answer Him by putting their faith into action back at their individual parishes and in their own lives,” she said.\n\nOtis would love to see more mission days occur throughout the Diocese of Bridgeport, a sentiment she shares with Kelly Weldon, Foundations in Faith’s director. But in order to fund them, the foundation needs a bit of help.\n\n“Mini grants create what I like to call ‘Holy Spirit opportunities,’ but this year, all but $1,300 was distributed to pastoral ministries in our Diocese,” Weldon said. “That will only cover one mini grant ‘Holy Spirit opportunity.’ We hope that folks in the Diocese will be struck by the impact of our mini grant program and help fund future innovative and needed programs.”\n\nTo learn more about Foundations in Faith’s mini grant program, visit foundationsinfaith.org/current-opportunities.

The agreement to rent their school building to the Danbury school system was terminated and the parish lost that income. After consulting with the finance board, Father George “Chip” O’Neill said they still chose to send their extra funds from the appeal to help an inner-city parish, just as they did with the previous appeal.\n\n“We decided we had to continue to give sacrificially as a parish rather than use the money to help with our own shortfall,” he said. So, they will assist St. Ann Church in Bridgeport with the extra funds they raised. This year, despite the challenges and a troubled economy, St. Joseph is $16,000 over its goal of $116,000. Father said the setback over the terminated lease was a real reminder of the importance of helping others who face similar financial challenges…and to trust in God’s providence.\n\n“God always provides, and we recognize we already have what we need…and we trust,” he said. “The more we give away freely without strings attached, the more we receive in return. It always happens that way.” It also helps that his parish family is a close-knit group, which he describes as “a good solid community that rely on each other.” They are heavily involved in ministries in the Danbury area, including those funded by the appeal.\n\n“We are all about food and feeding people, and most of our ministries are reaching out to those in need,” Father said. Parishioners regularly help out at the Dorothy Day Hospitality House. St. Joseph’s provides from 70 to 100 meals a month, and the youth group makes 50 to 75 sandwiches. In addition, parishioners prepare 15 casseroles a month to feed the hungry at Pacific House, a Danbury homeless shelter. They are also active in the H.A.L. Bag Program—Helping Another Live—which is an ongoing drive that collects non-perishable food and personal care items for the Brookfield Food Pantry.\n\nThe parish’s success in the Bishop’s Appeal hinges on several factors, says Father, who has made the goal in his 14 years as pastor and during his previous service at St. Patrick’s. “On a weekly basis, it’s important to keep people informed of how we’re doing and setting the expectation of achieving the goal,” he said. “This is the way I’ve always done it. Communication helps, with updates in the bulletin and announcements at Mass on a regular basis.”\n\nTheir success also hinges on the diligent efforts of his staff. “They have been with me since I’ve been here and they want to keep helping in any way, shape or form they can,” he says. “They do things outside of their comfort zone and never say no…. I am very blessed.” The parishioners realize that after they reach their goal, the surplus can be used to offer financial support to an inner-city parish. “Last year was the first year we did it, and it went very well,” he said. “This year we used it as part of our marketing of the appeal.” St. Ann’s has a special place in Father’s heart because he served there for five years after his ordination.\n\nJoe Gallagher, chief development officer for the diocese, says he is grateful to Father O’Neill and other pastors who participated in the Parish Partnership Program, which is writing a new chapter in charity and fellowship between parishes. In addition to St. Joseph in Brookfield, several other parish partnerships include the following: St. Rose of Lima in Newtown is helping St. Mary, Bridgeport and Catholic Charities of Danbury, St. Jude in Monroe is reaching out to Blessed Sacrament, and St. Thomas More in Darien is working with St. Mary Parish in Stamford. There are also multiple parishes participating in the partnership.\n\n“Many pastors and parishioners are enthusiastically embracing the Parish Partnership program. It enables them to designate any funds over goal to support parishes that are pastorally vibrant but struggling financially, and it is uniting the diocese in faith and service,” says Gallagher. Gallagher said he realizes many parishes are not in a financial position to designate over goal funds, but for those that do, they have been blessed by the mutual sharing and deepening of relationships between parishes. “The sharing is not one way, but a genuine relationship between the two parishes where everyone is nurtured spiritually. It brings different parish communities together in a way that they grow in understanding and fellowship,” says Gallagher, who notes, as a result of the program, parishioners have prayed and worshipped together, socialized and developed new friendships.\n\nBishop’s Appeal at 90% of goal\n\nBRIDGEPORT—The 2022 Annual Bishop’s Appeal, A Bridge Home, has raised $7.3 million and is at 90 percent of goal, said Pam Rittman, director of the Bishop’s Appeal. “We’re so close, but it’s important to realize the goal is not just a number. As Bishop Frank J. Caggiano has taught us, it is a true bridge between our donors, people in need and our parish communities,” said Rittman.\n\nAs the Appeal nears its goal, Rittman said it’s time to thank pastors and donors who have put it within reach. It’s also time for others to pitch in and push the appeal over the finish line for the good of the entire diocese, she says. To date, 13,514 donors have made gifts and each gift makes a difference and responds to the bishop’s call to reach out to those in need.\n\nThere are 32 parishes over goal and the Development Office is working with the remaining parishes to help them reach their respective goals. “We’re very grateful to those who have given, whether stepping up with leadership gifts or stretching to give sacrificially in spite of their own financial challenges.” said Rittman.\n\nRittman said that during this difficult year for many, she is inspired and encouraged by the many small donations coming in from working families that have financial challenges but have still managed to make giving to the Bishop’s Appeal a priority in their lives. “We’re hoping that those who haven’t yet joined the Appeal can support their sacrifice by making a contribution. The Appeal not only funds key programs and ministries of the diocese, but it sends a strong message of how we care for one another as Catholics,” said Rittman.\n\n“In his writings and videos, Bishop Caggiano has reminded us that we all have an obligation to one another, particularly as we seek to be one family of faith in Fairfield County,” she said.\n\nRittman said that while most of the faithful understand that the Appeal funds much needed charitable works for those who are struggling, they may be surprised to learn that the Appeal touches the lives of all diocesan families through its support of vocations, faith formation programs, communications and other services that helps to make parishes more vital and welcoming. “The Bishop’s Appeal is an expression of all that we share and aspire to as the people of God. We’re so close to the finish line and we would love to see the campaign reach goal before the fall,” says Rittman.\n\nFunds from the Appeal support vital new initiatives while continuing to feed the hungry, reach out to the most vulnerable, promote faith in Fairfield County, and fund the ongoing ministries and services provided by the diocese. Rittman said she expects parishioner donations to continue to come in throughout the summer and fall.\n\n(To make your gift online, please visit, 2022BishopsAppeal.org or text the word, APPEAL, to 475.241.7849.

It went something like this: “If you take care of my family, I’ll do everything to spread your word.”\n\nThat was more than 25 years ago when her oldest daughter suffered a series of medical ailments and was in and out of the hospital with a condition the experts couldn’t diagnose.\n\nKathy was desperate and prayed for her daughter … and for personal direction.\n\n“I was working as a part-time bookkeeper at the time but told God I would work anywhere,” she recalls.\n\nTo fulfill her part of the bargain and spread the good news, she became somewhat of a traveling saleswoman with a cabinet of religious items she kept at the back of St. Anthony Parish in Ansonia. She took her little business on the road and would fill up Rubbermaid bins with prayer books, rosaries, medals and statues and set up tables at church events in the Diocese of Bridgeport and Archdiocese of Hartford.\n\nFrom those humble beginnings came St. Anthony’s Book & Gift Shop in Orange, which has been in operation almost 25 years. To Kathy, it’s more of a ministry than a business, and she has been diligently spreading the word to Catholics, Christians and anyone who walks through the door.\n\n“People need to know they’re not alone,” she says. “People need to know that God is with us all the time and that they have a guardian angel. Even though I never know who’s coming through that door, I always spread that message.”\n\nMany customers come in and confess, “I’m not really religious.” Kathy lets them look around and offers to help them find what they want. While there, they inevitably open a book, see a saying on a plaque, or read words from a psalm.\n\n“They go out different than when they came in,” she says. There are occasions, too, when people confronting a crisis find themselves drawn to St. Anthony’s because they see his large image outside the store.\n\n“Sometimes I meet them at the door. Maybe they just had a miscarriage or had a child die or be addicted to heroin or had a family member or friend commit suicide,” she says. “I’ve had people crying in my arms because of a tragedy they suffered, especially the death of a child. One woman was at the door and she cried and cried and cried, and I held her and told her I was so sorry.”\n\nMany of them are looking for God at critical moments in their lives, whether it’s recovery from an addiction or an unexpected pregnancy.\n\n“It’s a ministry,” she says. “Sometimes I joke that if the minimum wage keeps going up, I’ll go be a greeter at Walmart, but God always takes care of me, and I love what I do.”\n\nSherry Smarz of St. Joseph Church in Shelton often helps Kathy at St. Anthony’s and said, “I love this store. It’s my happy place, and I feel like I’m helping spread the word.”\n\nOn feasts of the Blessed Mother, they invite people to pray the rosary in front of the store, where there is a life-sized statue of Our Lady of Fatima on the porch.\n\n“Our Lady watches over the people going through this intersection, and some of them even pull in the driveway just to say a prayer to her,” Kathy said.\n\nOn a recent Saturday, more than a dozen people gathered to pray the rosary outside in view of the passing traffic on Route 34.\n\n“Afterward, a couple from Colombia came in and said, ‘This was a miracle. We were driving by and saw you praying the rosary, and we had to come back,’” she recalled.\n\nAnother couple from New Hampshire was passing by a few years ago and stopped to pray the rosary and have been online customers ever since they returned home.\n\nDuring these troubled times when Catholics are often under attack, Kathy says, “We have to give public witness. I tell people not to be afraid. I’m not afraid because I’ve got God on my side. When we leave this world, hopefully he will say to us, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’”\n\nShe believes Catholics must have hope and not succumb to fear. The mother of three children, who have helped her with the store over the years, she tells customers, “I sell everything but church wine and white shoes.” And if you don’t see it, she’ll get it.\n\nSt. Anthony’s has everything from “birth to death,” she says, including christening outfits, baby gifts, wedding gifts, items related to the Sacraments, and religious supplies for death and bereavement, such as urns and Catholic caskets. There are also Catholic and Christian books, materials for 12 Step recovery programs, medals, jewelry and holy cards.\n\nDuring the COVID lockdown, she enhanced her website to encourage online shopping at www.stanthonygift.com. The shop, at 461 Derby Avenue in Orange, is open Wednesday through Friday from noon to 6 p.m. and on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. She can be contacted by email at godatwork2000@gmail.com or by phone at (203) 888-3390.\n\nSt. Anthony’s is one of a few religious items stores left in the state.\n\n“People are always thrilled to find a Catholic store because there are hardly any more around,” she said. Her clientele includes parishes and customers from throughout the Diocese of Bridgeport.\n\n“Our Catholic heritage has so many really great and amazing things, and I love to tell people about them,” she says. “For instance, I’ve heard people say, ‘I didn’t know there were patron saints for lawyers or for this or that. They’re always amazed to learn more about their faith.”\n\nAlong the way, many people have helped her — most notably St. Anthony, whose relic is on display in the shop — and several other patrons who passed on.\n\nHer first location on Bank Street in Seymour was owned by the late Ted Rogal, known as “the mayor of Seymour,” who had a men’s shop downtown.\n\n“He showed me the rent, and he gave me the key on a handshake. He was a huge help to me when I needed it,” she recalled. “God put him in my path. I loved him dearly. One Christmas, he helped me set up the nativity in the window, and people saw this Jewish man and this Catholic girl working together.”\n\nFour years later, she moved around the block to Main Street to a place owned by the late Jimmy Principi, owner of Jimmy’s Place.\n\n“He was a wonderful man too. He knew my biggest seasons were Christmas and First Communion, so when I was behind on my rent, he understood,” she recalled. “He had such a big part in keeping these doors open.”\n\nAnother one of her guardian angels was Fr. Nick Pavia, who was assigned to St. Joseph Church in Shelton at the time and helped her move from Seymour to downtown Derby in 2013.\n\n“Father would always come in the store,” she recalled. “He even blessed it for me.”\n\nSeveral thousand friends and family members were there for her when she got caught in a planning and zoning dispute in Orange. Her parents helped with the mortgage on the new building, and her customers signed a petition and supported her when her application for a religious gift shop faced opposition.\n\n“It’s a miracle I’m here,” she says. “I never thought I’d be on the corner of Orange Center Road.”\n\nAnd then, there was that deal she made with God over her sick daughter, who today is the mother of three sons.\n\nFor a while, her daughter ran a satellite St. Anthony’s in Winsted, next door to a health food store that sold gluten-free products.\n\n“While she was working there, we learned that all those years her problem was actually celiac disease,” an autoimmune disorder caused by intolerance to gluten in foods, she said. “If we hadn’t had that store, we never would have found out.”\n\nSo Kathy kept her side of the bargain … and God kept his.\n\nBRIDGEPORT—The summary report on the 2021-2023 Global Synod on Synodality listening sessions held in parishes throughout the diocese has been submitted to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) as part of the diocesan participation in the global synod called for by Pope Francis.\n\nThe diocesan summary was submitted on July 11 by Deacon Stephen Hodson, who was appointed synod representative for the Diocese of Bridgeport by Bishop Frank J. Caggiano. The report reflects comments of over 1,300 men and women who participated in listening sessions in 42 percent of parishes in the diocese, Deacon Hodson said. “The process has deepened our understanding of who we are as a community in Christ, and helped to begin the healing process that needs to occur within the Church,” said Deacon Hodson, a member of the pastoral ministry team at St. Luke Parish in Westport.\n\nBishop Caggiano praised Deacon Hodson for leading the process and expressed his thanks to all who participated in the listening sessions and to those who assisted Deacon Hodson in compiling the synthesis. “I am very grateful to Deacon Hodson for taking on this monumental task in a spirit of listening and conciliation,” the bishop said, noting that the synthesis is a valuable document that bears further study in the coming months as the diocese discerns the comments and suggestions of the faithful.\n\nPope Francis launched the Global Synod on Synodality in October 2021, and since that time, delegates from parishes around the world have been working to effectively listen to and bring forward the concerns, questions and hopes of the faithful.\n\nDeacon Hodson said the report summarizes the insights, questions and suggestions provided by the parishioners of the Diocese Bridgeport over the past seven months in response to the request by Pope Francis to consult with the faithful. The faithful freely commented on a wide range of subjects including the liturgy, sacraments and spiritual practices including the Sacrament of Reconciliation, family life, the need to create more welcoming parishes, the importance of engaging youth, the diminished understanding of the true presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and the increasing role of the laity.\n\n“These faith stories, or lived experiences, come from God and enable us to witness how God has journeyed with us in the past and will continue to journey with all his adopted daughters and sons in the future. We are being guided to share true experiences of how God has brought us to himself, healed and consoled us, brought us joy and sustained us in sorrow,” Deacon Hodson said.\n\nThough the diocese has submitted the initial summary to the USCCB, it is encouraging parishes that have not completed their report to send it for inclusion in the regional report summary that will be submitted by the Archdiocese of Hartford at the end of July, he said. In addition to the “live” listening sessions, several parishes held Zoom sessions and several conducted surveys to allow those who could not attend live or Zoom sessions to respond via written responses submitted via email, online survey services or in-person drop boxes, Deacon Hodson said. Some parishes also held listening sessions with their active ministry groups which proved to very valuable as the participants were largely long-time parishioners with significant wisdom that was shared with love, along with honest critique, he said.\n\nDeacon Hodson said participants didn’t shy away from tough topics or areas of disagreement, but always managed to voice their concerns or disappointment along with a strong love for the Church and the role it plays in their lives. Some individuals commented on the need for more joy, passion and love in the Mass, the lack of inclusiveness in the Church’s messaging, gender issues and the need to expand the role of women in the Church. Others were concerned about the shortage of priests and the lingering wounds and sense of betrayal caused by the abuse scandal.\n\n“The goal was to let people speak about what was on their hearts—the more open-ended the questions, the better,” said Deacon Hodson, who believes the Holy Spirit inspired candid comments and reflections from the hearts of diocesan participants. “Sadness, struggle and frustration were expressed, as were love, hope and joy. Many suggestions were made in the hope that the Holy Spirit will nourish the seeds of new life for our Church, the beloved bride of our savior, Jesus Christ, who desires that all may be one.”\n\nWhile local dioceses across the country submit their reports, which will be included in larger regional summaries, the Vatican is preparing a process to review the documents and produce a final synthesis. Speaking as a guest on Bishop Caggiano’s weekly radio show and podcast, Sr. Nathalie Becquart, under-secretary for the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops and a member of the Vatican Dicastery for Communications, said she hopes to receive all of the synthesis of reports from the bishop’s conference by mid-August, and that the Vatican team has been working to prepare the methodology and the process to review all reports. “It’s not an academic synthesis—it’s an act of discernment,” she said. “So it has to be a process, through prayer land listening. We have imagined working as a group of many diverse people, because we will receive the synthesis from everywhere in different languages.”\n\nSuggestions made by the laity for renewing the Church are included in the diocesan report along with strategies for evangelization and engaging the faithful in the life of the Church.\n\n(The entire report and updates will be available online on the Institute for Catholic Formation website, at: formationreimagined.org.

Ranging from small, devotional images intended for the highly gendered spaces of the Renaissance home, to large altarpieces originally on display in churches, these artworks intertwine depictions of idealized beauty with messages of virtue and piety, presenting these women as models of virtue and devotion for emulation—and admiration—by their Renaissance viewers.\n\nOut of the Kress Vaults: Women in Sacred Renaissance Painting is the first exhibition to have been co-curated with undergraduate students. With the generous support of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, DiMarzo led an undergraduate seminar in Spring 2021 with the goal of developing an exhibition inspired by the museum’s own Samuel H. Kress Collection, a group of 10 mostly Italian Renaissance and Baroque paintings. The presence of two Italian paintings of the Madonna and Child inspired the exhibition’s theme; students then worked with DiMarzo and museum staff to develop an exhibition proposal and draft loan requests for paintings in Kress Collections at other museums and academic institutions. They focused on bringing works that are typically held in storage at their home institutions—the “Kress Vaults” of the title—into the galleries at Fairfield University.\n\nLenders to the exhibition include the National Gallery of Art, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the Harvard Art Museums, the Austin Art Center at Trinity College, the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, and the Lowe Art Museum, University of Miami.\n\nFairfield University Art Museum Executive Director Carey Weber noted, “We are very excited to be presenting our first exhibition co-curated with Fairfield students. It was such a unique opportunity for them to get a hands-on understanding of what goes into planning an exhibition, especially one featuring Old Master paintings!”\n\nGenerous support for the exhibition comes from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation and the Humanities Institute of Fairfield University.\n\nThe exhibition will open with a lecture by Michelle DiMarzo, PhD, on Thursday, September 15, 2022 in the Diffley Board Room of Bellarmine Hall.\n\nThe exhibition will be on view in the museum’s Bellarmine Hall Galleries, and will also be accessible through the museum’s website as a video tour, Matterport virtual tour, and audio guide. The written materials for the exhibition will be available bilingually in Spanish and English, with translations provided by Laura Gasca Jiménez (assistant professor, Spanish and translation studies).\n\nIn conjunction with the exhibition, the Fairfield University Art Museum has organized a full roster of public programs that will be presented in person and, where indicated, streaming online via thequicklive.com.\n\nExhibition Programming:\n\nThursday, September 15, 5 pm\n\nOpening Night Lecture: Out of the Kress Vaults\n\nCurator and Assistant Professor of Art History & Visual Culture Michelle DiMarzo, PhD\n\nBellarmine Hall, Diffley Board Room and streaming on thequicklive.com\n\nThursday, September 15, 6-8 pm\n\nExhibition Opening Night Reception\n\nBellarmine Hall Galleries and Great Hall\n\nMonday, September 19, 5 pm\n\nMusical Performance: Renaissance A cappella\n\nBellarmine Hall Great Hall\n\nThursday, September 22, 11 am (in person) and 12 noon (streaming)\n\nArt in Focus: El Greco, The Holy Family, ca. 1595-1600\n\nBellarmine Hall Galleries and streaming on thequicklive.com\n\nThursday, October 13, 5 pm\n\nLecture: The Paintings Conservation Program of the Samuel H.

From a Vacation Bible School centered around the Eucharist to Sports & Scripture nights each week, youth of all ages have had profound experiences in connecting with the Lord.\n\nForming relationships, playing games and spending time in adoration are what attracted a dozen or so teens to join Fr. Joseph Gill, pastor at St. Jude, on Monday evenings in the parish center. Through Frisbee, Gaga Ball and Capture the Flag, these middle and high schoolers have had the opportunity to meet others who enjoy having fun as well as sharing the Word of God. During last week’s heated game of handball, cheers rose up as one team scored a point while an opponent admitted, “It’s a battle out here!” Hannah Vu, a recent graduate of Masuk High School, said that’s part of building community.\n\n“This is a great way to make strong relationships with other kids and push us out of our comfort zone,” said Vu, who often attends with her brother Hansel, 13. “The activities and scripture together make it a good time.”\n\nChristopher Iturralde, an incoming 8th grader at Cardinal Kung Academy, agrees. “It’s interactive and open,” he said. “Reading the Bible and responding to questions help deepen my faith, especially when I hear others’ thoughts and think, ‘Hmm, I never thought about it that way before.’ You hear another interpretation.”\n\nFollowing a half hour of games, the teens and Fr. Gill, accompanied by assistant Katie Gray and seminarian Pablo Aca, gather for snacks and then read the upcoming Sunday Gospel, sitting in a circle to further a sense of community. Discussing the passages in ways that relate to teens helps put situations at their level and makes them easier to understand, said Vu. Fr. Gill prompts participants with questions such as “What do you think God wants for you?” which elicit comments like “get on the right path” and “make a connection with Him.”\n\n“It’s not catechesis. I want to make the readings life-applicable,” he said. “We’re talking about what God is saying to them as 8th graders. It’s a way to make the faith more palpable for these kids.”\n\nAnd at St. Jude, that starts long before they reach their teens. While the older kids have enjoyed Sports & Scripture, those in kindergarten through grade 5 had the opportunity to take part in the week-long Vacation Bible School “Camp Adore” in mid-July. With a theme of Jesus in the Eucharist, campers began each day with Mass, a youth-centered homily and adoration. They then rotated through stations such as crafts, games, praise and worship music and lessons about young saints such as Maria Goretti and Blessed Carlos Acutis – all while keeping the focus on the Eucharist.\n\n“The entire point of this camp is to introduce kids into a living relationship with Jesus in the Eucharist. I think the sparks of that relationship [were] lit this week!” said Fr. Gill.\n\nAccording to Jessica Iannotta, St. Jude’s Family Ministry Coordinator, through generous donations, each child received a Mass bag with a children’s Bible and prayer journals. “Campers had a great experience and shared their enthusiasm in wanting to come back day after day,” she added. “It is our hope that this will continue to draw them closer to the Lord and desire to worship Him at Mass and adoration more regularly.”\n\nFr. Gill recalled one morning after adoration when a third-grade boy knelt before the altar and proclaimed, “God, I won’t let you down!” For the children at St. Jude, it seems a relationship with their Lord and their faith have already taken root.\n\nBy Emily Clark\n\nLAC STE. ANNE, Alberta—Pope Francis joined Indigenous pilgrims at a lake known for miraculous healings and encouraged them to lay their burdens on the shore.\n\nSince the 1880s, the Cree and the Sioux, the Métis, the Blackfoot, the Dene and others from across Turtle Island—North America—have traveled to Lac Ste. Anne, about 45 miles west of Edmonton, for a pilgrimage around the July 26 feast of Sts. Joachim and Anne.\n\nLike most of the 40,000 pilgrims who make the journey each year, Pope Francis paused at a statue of St. Anne on his way to the water, paying tribute to Jesus’ grandmother.\n\nNear the lake, known for its healing properties, the pope stopped to pray facing the East, then the South, then the West. Finally, facing the North and overlooking the lake, he blessed the water, just as bishops have done for decades at the start of the pilgrimage each year.\n\nAn aide then pushed Pope Francis in his wheelchair to the very edge of the lake. The Alberta health department advised pilgrims not to go into the water because of a blue-green algae or cyanobacteria bloom.\n\nFather Cristino Bouvette, an Indigenous priest who helped plan the pope’s prayer, told Catholic News Service that Indigenous people face the four directions of the compass in prayer to remind themselves of “the omnipresence of the Creator and that all creation belongs to him.”\n\nOblate Father Garry LaBoucane said he has been organizing the pilgrimage for “20 or 30 years” and has been making the annual trip to the lake since he was a boy—about 70 years in total.\n\n“None of us ever dreamed that Pope Francis would come here,” he told CNS. “When we heard he would come to Canada, we knew he wouldn’t come here—there were just too many issues with access and security and facilities.”\n\nBut, he said, the “walking together” theme of the papal trip and the commitment to reconciliation has been seen in every preparation meeting and in every interaction between the pilgrims, the police, the clergy, the medics and the traditional healers.\n\nOrganizers said about 10,000 people were at the papal event. And, as on every stop during his visit to Canada July 24-29, Indigenous drummers accompanied Pope Francis’ visit to the lake and the Lac Ste. Anne Shrine — but the song Eugene Alexis played on the shore was special and ancient.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Stoney Nakoda people moved up to the area from the Dakotas because their chief received a vision of the lake in a dream; his people would know they had arrived at the right place when they heard the words of the song Alexis sang whispered on the treetops surrounding the lake.\n\nSaying that “all of us need the healing that comes from Jesus, the physician of souls and bodies,” Pope Francis prayed with thousands of pilgrims gathered on benches in the shrine.\n\n“Lord, as the people on the shores of the Sea of Galilee were not afraid to cry out to you with their needs, so we come to you this evening, with whatever pain we bear within us,” he said. “We bring to you our weariness and our struggles, the wounds of the violence suffered by our Indigenous brothers and sisters.”\n\n“In this blessed place, where harmony and peace reign, we present to you the disharmony of our experiences, the terrible effects of colonization, the indelible pain of so many families, grandparents and children,” he continued. “Help us to be healed of our wounds.”\n\nHe prayed to Jesus for “the intercession of your mother and your grandmother.”\n\nHe addressed the grandmothers present in the crowd, too, saying their hearts “are springs from which the living water of faith flowed.”\n\n“I am struck by the vital role of women in Indigenous communities,” the pope said. “They occupy a prominent place as blessed sources not only of physical but also of spiritual life.”\n\nThe 85-year-old pope, who has spoken often of the love and wisdom of his Grandmother Rosa, told the pilgrims that it was from her that “I first received the message of faith and learned that the Gospel is communicated through loving care and the wisdom of life.”\n\n“Faith rarely comes from reading a book alone in a corner; instead, it spreads within families, transmitted in the language of mothers, in the sweetly lyrical accents of grandmothers,” the pope said.\n\nWith the suffering of Canada’s First Nation, Inuit and Métis people never far from his mind, Pope Francis noted how the Lac Ste. Anne pilgrimage has brought different people together in peace and harmony for decades.\n\nSpeaking the day after solemnly apologizing for the role Catholics in Canada played in running residential schools, tearing Indigenous children from their families and cultures, Pope Francis presented another side of the church’s history with Indigenous people.\n\n“At the dramatic time of the conquest, Our Lady of Guadalupe transmitted the true faith to the Indigenous people, speaking their own language and clothed in their own garments, without violence or imposition,” he said.\n\nAnd many missionaries helped preserve Indigenous languages and cultures by making grammar books, dictionaries and catechisms in the local languages, he said.\n\n“Part of the painful legacy we are now confronting stems from the fact that Indigenous grandmothers were prevented from passing on the faith in their own language and culture,” the pope said.\n\nGathered on the lakeshore, “immersed in creation,” he said, “we can also sense another beating: the maternal heartbeat of the earth. Just as the hearts of babies in the womb beat in harmony with those of their mothers, so in order to grow as people, we need to harmonize our own rhythms of life with those of creation, which gives us life.”\n\nBy: Cindy Wooden | CNS"
