        "text": "A long forgotten painting of Blessed Bernard Mary Silvestrelli, C.P. is returned to the Passionists.\n\nRead the story –\n\nBlessed Bernard Mary Silvestrelli C.P.\n\nBlessed Bernard Mary Silvestrelli (7 November 1831 – 9 December 1911), born as Cesare Silvestrelli, was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Passionists. He entered the Novitiate for a brief period under a different religious name though ill health forced him to leave but did not hinder him from still training and living alongside the Passionists. He re-entered the order after his ordination and went on to hold several positions of leadership within his own order; he was even likened to Saint Paul of the Cross while Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X held him in high esteem.\n\nHis beatification was celebrated on 16 October 1988 in Saint Peter’s Square, Rome."
