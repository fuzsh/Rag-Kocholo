        "text": "I recently came across a raw and powerful poem on the internet which describes Mary’s experience of breastfeeding the Infant Jesus to illustrate how women are unfairly excluded from the pulpit. The poem was penned by Kaitlin Hardy Shetler who belongs to the evangelical group ‘Churches of Christ’ which prevents women from occupying positions of authority in the church and even from actively participating in worship services. The poem went viral as it struck a chord with many women all over the world. And I am one of those women:\n\nA Christmas Poem\n\nby Kaitlin Hardy Shetler\n\nsometimes I wonder\n\nif Mary breastfed Jesus.\n\nif she cried out when he bit her\n\nor if she sobbed when he would not latch.\n\nand sometimes I wonder\n\nif this is all too vulgar\n\nto ask in a church\n\nfull of men\n\nwithout milk stains on their shirts\n\nor coconut oil on their breasts\n\npreaching from pulpits off limits to the Mother of God.\n\nbut then i think of feeding Jesus,\n\nbirthing Jesus,\n\nthe expulsion of blood\n\nand smell of sweat,\n\nthe salt of a mother’s tears\n\nonto the soft head of the Salt of the Earth,\n\nfeeling lonely\n\nand tired\n\nhungry\n\nannoyed\n\noverwhelmed\n\nloving\n\nand i think,\n\nif the vulgarity of birth is not\n\nhonestly preached\n\nby men who carry power but not burden,\n\nwho carry privilege but not labor,\n\nwho carry authority but not submission,\n\nthen it should not be preached at all.\n\nbecause the real scandal of the Birth of God\n\nlies in the cracked nipples of a\n\n14 year old\n\nand not in the sermons of ministers\n\nwho say women\n\nare too delicate\n\nto lead.\n\nThe poem illustrates the absurdity of preventing women from occupying the pulpit. A woman is barred from priesthood because of her biology but it is her biology that makes her experience more meaningful and personal. A woman who had the visceral and moving experience of giving birth to the Lord would surely understand what faith is all about. And Mary, who experiences the discomfort and fatigue of childbirth and nursing, represents all women. Although Kaitlin Shetler describes an experience with a particular church, the exclusion of women from positions of religious authority is an issue that crosses over denominations and religions.\n\nWomen cannot be ordained to the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church. Women’s ordination is a controversial issue in Buddhist communities too. There is also a misogynistic belief that a woman is polluting because of her body. Menstrual taboos of Hinduism result in male only religious spaces and male specific religious duties. Traditionally, it is only a male priest who has had the right to conduct weddings and religious functions. Often the only reason cited is that there is no precedent and that it is divinely ordained. But the truth of the matter is that these are man made restrictions which have distorted the original teachings of all the major religions and reflect the oppressive structures of patriarchy. Many Hindu women are challenging the traditional notions of priesthood and some have begun officiating at ceremonies. Muslim women have also been fighting for the right to be appointed as imams. We have a growing number of women of all faiths who refuse to be held back from the full expression of their spirituality and are fighting for gender equity in religious matters.\n\nI was struck by the description of the nursing Madonna in the poem. It made me wonder why we hardly see images of Mary breastfeeding in art and that led me to conduct some research on the topic. After all, those were days before formula use and we would not have survived as a species without this natural function. I discovered that the motif of Maria Lactans or the Nursing Madonna was predominant in religious iconography in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\n\nMother Mary was even associated with lactation miracles. There is a belief that the floor of the Milk Grotto, a chapel in Bethlehem, changed its color to white when a drop of Mary’s milk fell on it. The shrine is visited to this day by women trying to conceive and new mothers who wish to increase the quantity of their milk. There is a lot of artwork dedicated to the lactation of St. Bernard of Clairvaux, a 12th century Cistercian monk and abbott. Legend has it that Mary squirted breastmilk into his mouth to reveal herself as the mother of mankind and to either cure him of an eye infection or to grant him spiritual wisdom, depending on the variant of the story. There was nothing scandalous about exposing a breast till the 18th century but later on as the breast became more and more sexualized, people became squeamish about it and the image of the lactating virgin fell out of fashion.\n\nChristmas is essentially a story about birth and the bond between a mother and child. Kaitlin Shetler, in this poem, humanizes the divine Virgin Mary who is doing what millions of women have been doing since time immemorial. I felt a connection with Mary and with all women across the world in the simple yet sacred acts of birthing and nurturing. We are part of this ancient sisterhood spanning millennia. And there is a primal priestess in every woman, buried under centuries of oppression, who needs to rightfully reclaim her place.\n\nAll pictures are from Wikimedia Commons and are in the public domain."
