        "text": "Simone Martini - Virgin and Child with Saints, about 1320\n\nSimone Martini - Virgin and Child with Saints, about 1320\n\n1 of 1\n\nClose\n\nThis altarpiece is made up of five separate vertical panels, each with a triangular pinnacle above. The center features the Virgin and Child with four saints on the panels and pinnacles. The frames on the panels have straight sides that curve in to meet at the top, and are flat at the bottom. With the exception of the figures, the panels and pinnacles are primarily gold. In the center panel, which is larger than the others, is the light-skinned Virgin Mary and the baby Jesus. Mary is wearing a red gown and blue hooded robe. Her head is tilted to our right and her eyes look slightly upward. She holds three white flowers in her right hand. The baby Jesus looks up at his mother and touches her face with his right hand. He wears a pink shirt and is partially wrapped in a red drape. Below the figure, a black rectangle with gold writing reads \"AUA. MARIA. GRATIA. PLENA.\" The pinnacle above the pair contains a light-skinned Christ partially wrapped in a red robe, displaying wounds on his body and hands. In the panel to our far left is a medium-light-skinned Saint Paul. He is balding with a long, thick, dark beard, and is dressed in lavender, turquoise, and red robes. His position is in toward center, and he carries a sword in his right hand and a book in his left. Below the figure, a blue rectangle with gold writing reads \"SCS. PAULUS. AP\". In the pinnacle above is a light-skinned angel in pink with blue wings. The next image to the right of Saint Paul is a light-skinned Saint Lucy. She is dressed in a red gown with a turquoise and gold robe, and a white scarf drapes over her head and shoulders. She holds a small jug or lamp in her right hand. Below the figure, a blue rectangle with gold writing reads \"SCA. LUCIA. V. ET. M.\" The angel in the pinnacle above wears turquoise and green and has pink wings. The figure to the right of the Virgin and Child is a light-skinned Saint Catherine. She is wearing a red robe with a white collar and lining and a gold and jeweled crown on her head. She is facing forward with an unfocused gaze, and holds a palm in her right hand and a book in her left. Below the figure, a blue rectangle with gold writing reads \"SCA. CATHARINA. ET. M.\" The angel in the pinnacle above appears to be holding a palm and cross. The image in the panel to your far right is a medium-light-skinned Saint John the Baptist. He is wearing a red robe over a brown garment tied at the waist. He is pointing the index finger of his right hand and holds the cross with his left. Below the figure, a blue rectangle with gold writing reads \"SCS. JOANNES. BAPTA.\" The angel in the pinnacle above wears a pink drape over a blue robe and appears to be blowing a horn.\n\nSimone Martini (Siena, about 1284 - 1344, Avignon)\n\nVirgin and Child with Saints, about 1320\n\nGold and tempera on panel , 131 x 274.3 cm (51 9/16 x 108 in.)\n\nObject details\n\nObject number\n\nP15e4.1-5\n\nCreator(s)\n\nSimone Martini (Siena, about 1284 - 1344, Avignon)\n\nTitle\n\nVirgin and Child with Saints\n\nDate\n\nabout 1320\n\nMedium\n\nGold and tempera on panel\n\nProvenance\n\nProbably painted as the high alter of Santa Maria dei Servi for the Servites of the church of Santa Maria dei Servi, Orvieto.Installed in the sacristy of Santa Maria dei Servi, Orvieto by 1671. Purchased by Leandro Mazzocchi from Santa Maria dei Servi, Orvieto in 1851.By descent in the Mazzocchi family and on loan to the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, Orvieto from about 1860-1899.Purchased by Isabella Stewart Gardner from the Mazzocchi family, Orvieto, April 1899 for £500 through Bernard Berenson (1865–1959), American art historian.\n\nDimensions\n\n131 x 274.3 cm (51 9/16 x 108 in.)\n\nAdditional Dimensions\n\nCenter panel: 99 x 60.7 cm (39 x 23 7/8 in.) without pinnacle Side panels: about 86.3 x 42.5 cm (34 x 16 3/4 in.) each Pinnacles: about 32 x 36 cm (12 5/8 x 14 3/16 in.) each\n\nCommentary\n\nSimone Martini achieved unprecedented fame in his own lifetime. This is his largest surviving work outside of Italy and one of the earliest altarpieces in the museum. Delicate and otherworldly, with its finely tooled gold background, this polyptych (a multi-paneled altarpiece) comes from the Church of the Servites in Orvieto, Italy. Above the Virgin and Child is a victorious and blessing Christ, displaying his wounds; the saints to either side carry identifying attributes. On the pinnacles above the saints, angels hold symbols of the Crucifixion and summon the Last Judgment with their trumpets. Once again, this acquisition showed that Gardner was ahead of the curve; it was one of two paintings by Simone Martini in her museum, the debut works by this artist to enter a United States collection.\n\nGallery\n\nEarly Italian Room\n\nBibliography\n\nF.
