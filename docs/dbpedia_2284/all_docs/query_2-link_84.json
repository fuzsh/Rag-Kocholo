Alleluia.\n\nHymn\n\nO God of truth, prepare our minds\n\nTo hear and heed your holy word;\n\nFill every heart that longs for you\n\nWith your mysterious presence, Lord.\n\nAlmighty Father, with your Son\n\nAnd blessed Spirit, hear our prayer:\n\nTeach us to love eternal truth\n\nAnd seek its freedom everywhere.\n\nStanbrook Abbey Hymnal\n\nPsalm 49 (50)\n\nTrue reverence for the Lord\n\nThe Lord, the God of gods has spoken:\n\nhe has summoned the whole earth, from east to west.\n\nGod has shone forth from Zion in her great beauty.\n\nOur God will come, and he will not be silent.\n\nBefore him, a devouring fire;\n\naround him, a tempest rages.\n\nHe will call upon the heavens above, and on the earth, to judge his people.\n\n“Bring together before me my chosen ones, who have sealed my covenant with sacrifice.”\n\nThe heavens will proclaim his justice; for God is the true judge.\n\nGlory be to the Father and to the Son\n\nand to the Holy Spirit,\n\nas it was in the beginning,\n\nis now, and ever shall be,\n\nworld without end.\n\nAmen.\n\nPsalm 49 (50)\n\nListen, my people, and I will speak;\n\nIsrael, I will testify against you.\n\nI am God, your God.\n\nI will not reproach you with your sacrifices,\n\nfor your burnt offerings are always before me.\n\nBut I will not accept calves from your houses,\n\nnor goats from your flocks.\n\nFor all the beasts of the forests are mine,\n\nand in the hills, a thousand animals.\n\nAll the birds of the air – I know them.\n\nWhatever moves in the fields – it is mine.\n\nIf I am hungry, I will not tell you;\n\nfor the whole world is mine, and all that is in it.\n\nAm I to eat the flesh of bulls,\n\nor drink the blood of goats?\n\nOffer a sacrifice to God – a sacrifice of praise;\n\nto the Most High, fulfil your vows.\n\nThen you may call upon me in the time of trouble:\n\nI will rescue you, and you will honour me.\n\nGlory be to the Father and to the Son\n\nand to the Holy Spirit,\n\nas it was in the beginning,\n\nis now, and ever shall be,\n\nworld without end.\n\nAmen.\n\nPsalm 49 (50)\n\nTo the sinner, God has said this:\n\nWhy do you recite my statutes?\n\nWhy do you dare to speak my covenant?\n\nFor you hate what I teach you,\n\nand reject what I tell you.\n\nThe moment you saw a thief, you joined him;\n\nyou threw in your lot with adulterers.\n\nYou spoke evil with your mouth,\n\nand your tongue made plans to deceive.\n\nSolemnly seated, you denounced your own brother;\n\nyou poured forth hatred against your own mother’s son.\n\nAll this you did, and I was silent;\n\nso you thought that I was just like you.\n\nBut I will reprove you –\n\nI will confront you with all you have done.\n\nUnderstand this, you who forget God;\n\nlest I tear you apart, with no-one there to save you.\n\nWhoever offers up a sacrifice of praise gives me true honour;\n\nwhoever follows a sinless path in life will be shown the salvation of God.\n\nGlory be to the Father and to the Son\n\nand to the Holy Spirit,\n\nas it was in the beginning,\n\nis now, and ever shall be,\n\nworld without end.\n\nAmen.\n\nFirst ReadingHosea 14:2-10\n\nA call to conversion and promise of safety\n\nThe Lord says this:\n\nIsrael, come back to the Lord your God;\n\nyour iniquity was the cause of your downfall.\n\nProvide yourself with words\n\nand come back to the Lord.\n\nSay to him, ‘Take all iniquity away\n\nso that we may have happiness again\n\nand offer you our words of praise.\n\nAssyria cannot save us,\n\nwe will not ride horses any more,\n\nor say, “Our God!” to what our own hands have made,\n\nfor you are the one in whom orphans find compassion.’\n\n– I will heal their disloyalty,\n\nI will love them with all my heart,\n\nfor my anger has turned from them.\n\nI will fall like dew on Israel.\n\nHe shall bloom like the lily,\n\nand thrust out roots like the poplar,\n\nhis shoots will spread far;\n\nhe will have the beauty of the olive\n\nand the fragrance of Lebanon.\n\nThey will come back to live in my shade;\n\nthey will grow corn that flourishes,\n\nthey will cultivate vines\n\nas renowned as the wine of Helbon.\n\nWhat has Ephraim to do with idols any more\n\nwhen it is I who hear his prayer and care for him?\n\nI am like a cypress ever green,\n\nall your fruitfulness comes from me.\n\nLet the wise man understand these words.\n\nLet the intelligent man grasp their meaning.\n\nFor the ways of the Lord are straight,\n\nand virtuous men walk in them,\n\nbut sinners stumble.\n\nResponsoryHo 14:4; Jl 3:21\n\nSecond ReadingFrom a treatise On the Incarnation of the Lord by Theodoret of Cyr, bishop\n\nI will heal their wounds\n\nJesus also wept over Jerusalem because by her unwillingness to believe she was bent on her own ruin, and upon the temple, once so renowned, he passed sentence of utter destruction. Patiently he put up with being struck in the face by a man who was doubly a slave, in body and in spirit. He allowed himself to be slapped, spat upon, insulted, tortured, scourged and finally crucified. He accepted two robbers as his companions in punishment, on his right and on his left. He endured being reckoned with murderers and criminals. He drank the vinegar and the bitter gall yielded by the unfaithful vineyard of Israel. He submitted to crowning with thorns instead of with vine twigs and grapes; he was ridiculed with the purple cloak, holes were dug in his hands and his feet, and at last he was carried to the grave.\n\nIn tasting the gall Jesus took on himself the bitterness and toil of man’s mortal, painful life. By drinking the vinegar he made his own the degradation men had suffered, and in the same act gave us the grace to better our condition. By the purple robe he signified his kingship, by the reed he hinted at the weakness and rottenness of the devil’s power. By taking the slap in the face, and thus suffering the violence, corrections and blows that were due to us, he proclaimed our freedom.\n\nHis side was pierced as Adam’s was; yet there came forth not a woman who, being beguiled, was to be the death-bearer, but a fountain of life that regenerates the world by its two streams: the one to renew us in the baptismal font and clothe us with the garment of immortality, the other to feed us, the reborn, at the table of God, just as babes are nourished with milk.\n\nResponsory\n\nAlmighty, ever-living God,\n\nwe confidently call you Father as well as Lord.\n\nRenew your Spirit in our hearts:\n\nmake us ever more perfectly your children,\n\nso that we may enter upon the inheritance you have promised us.\n\nThrough our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n\nwho lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n\nGod, for ever and ever.\n\nLet us praise the Lord.\n\nThe psalms and canticles here are our own translation from the Latin.
