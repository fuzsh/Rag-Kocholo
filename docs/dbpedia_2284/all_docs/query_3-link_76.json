        "text": "History and Tradition\n\nPlans for St. Bernard High School were begun in 1955 in response to the need for high schools in the Westchester-Playa del Rey area. St. Bernard was founded as a four-year, co-instructional school located at St. Anastasia School where classes were held for one year prior to the completion of the present campus. On December 4, 1957, the present land site was blessed at a simple ceremony. During 1957-1958 the Pioneer Class chose the school colors: blue, signifying loyalty; white, purity; and gold, nobility; their motto Noverim Te, Noverim Me; and their school mascot: Vikings. The first principal, Reverend Francis J. Cahill, headed the faculty consisting of the Brothers of Saint Patrick, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet. On September 22, 1958, the doors of the new St. Bernard High School opened for the first time. Joining the original faculty, replacing the Brothers of St. Patrick, were the Piarist Fathers and the Daughters of Mary and Joseph. On May 24, 1958, the original building was solemnly dedicated. September 10, 1957 is observed as Founders Day.\n\nSt. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nBernard, the founding abbot of Clairvaux Abbey in Burgundy, was one of the most commanding Church leaders in the first half of the twelfth century as well as one of the greatest spiritual masters of all times and the most powerful propagator of the Cistercian reform. He was born in Fontaines-les-Dijon in 1090 and entered the Abbey of Citeaux in 1112, bringing thirty of his relatives with him, including five of his brothers – his youngest brother and his widowed father followed later. After receiving a monastic formation, he was sent in 1115 to begin a new monastery near Aube: Clairvaux, the Valley of Light. As a young abbot he published a series of sermons on the Annunciation.\n\nBernard’s spiritual writing as well as his extraordinary personal magnetism began to attract many to Clairvaux and the other Cistercian monasteries, leading to many new foundations. Bernard’s dynamism soon reached far beyond monastic circles. He was sought as an advisor and mediator by the ruling powers of his age. More than any other he helped to bring about the healing of the papal schism which arose in 1130 with the election of the antipope Anacletus II. At the same time, he labored for peace and reconciliation between England and France and among many lesser nobles. Bernard died at Clairvaux on the 20th of August in 1153. He was canonized by Pope Alexander III on the 18th of January in 1174. Pope Pius VII declared him a Doctor of the Church in 1830.\n\nPatron: St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\nMotto: Noverim Te, Noverim Me “By knowing Him, I know myself.”\n\nCrest (as seen on cover): Three mitres, a book, and the school prayer\n\nThe school crest represents attributes of the school patron, St. Bernard. The miters symbolize his position as Abbot and recall his sanctity. The book signifies his vast knowledge, love of learning, and his valuable contribution to the theology of the Church. Memorare Maria recalls the opening words of the prayer to Our Lady attributed to St. Bernard.​​​​\n\nSchool Prayer: Memorare Maria\n\nRemember, O Most Gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to Your protection, implored Your help, or sought Your intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this confidence, I fly to You, O Virgin of Virgins, my Mother! To You I come; before You I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the Word Incarnate, despise not my petitions, but, in Your mercy, hear and answer me. Amen\n\nAlma Mater:\n\nLoyal Sons and Daughters, St. Bernard High to you.​\n\nPledge fore’er allegiance, loyalty strong and true.\n\nMary, our Queen leads us onward ‘neath gold, white, and blue.\n\nAlma Mater, great St. Bernard, Hail, all hail, to you!\n\n​"
