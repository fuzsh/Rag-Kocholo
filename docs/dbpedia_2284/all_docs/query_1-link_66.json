        "text": "The Tenth Sunday after Pentecost, 18 August 2019\n\nA Sermon on Luke 12:49-56 by Samuel Zumwalt, STS\n\nLuke 12:49-56 English Standard Version, © 2001 by Crossway Bibles, a division of Good News Publishers]\n\n49 “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled! 50 I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how great is my distress until it is accomplished! 51 Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. 52 For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.” 54 He also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so, it happens. 55 And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and it happens. 56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky, but why do you not know how to interpret the present time?\n\nHOLY LIVES: BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX\n\nGrace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nJesus brings division to families, not only to earthly families but even to church families. Jesus bring division long before Jesus brings peace. Jesus casts fire by His presence. Our translation is not the best translation in v. 49. For the fire that Jesus casts has already been lighted. Why is this so? Because Jesus is on the scene. He is God in human flesh, It matters who we think Jesus is. Those who don’t believe Jesus is God in human flesh are divided from those who do. It matters what we think Jesus is saying to us. When people say something like, “My Jesus would never bring division,” well, they are divided from those who take Him at His Word. It matters how we listen to Jesus. When people say, “I don’t think Jesus would ever cause division, because I think Jesus is all about tolerance and inclusion,” well, they are divided from those who take Jesus at His Word. Jesus tells us plainly: He brings division before He ever brings peace. Division is necessary, because God in human flesh has come into the world.\n\nOur gospel lesson is part of Luke’s travel narrative that began near the end of chapter nine. Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem for His Baptism. Since His water Baptism has taken place already, what does Jesus mean? There in Jerusalem, He will be crucified by those who rejected Him. All along Jesus’ journey to Jerusalem and His lonely cross, just by showing up, Jesus began bringing division to earthly families. Some listened and followed Jesus. Others didn’t.\n\nSo, please think of a time when you fell in love, or, if you are much younger, think of that time when you will fall in love. When someone has captured your heart, you want the feelings to be mutual. When you have decided that you are all in on a relationship, you want the person you love to be all in, too. The most terrible outcome to having fallen head over heels and then expressed your passionate love to another is to receive a tepid response such as: “Oh, that’s nice.” Or “I know you do.” Or, “I just want us to be friends.” Pardon me, while I go throw up.\n\nSo, is every division in a family or even in a church family caused by Jesus? No, sometimes the division in a family and, yes, even in a church family is caused by the old Adam or old Eve, the old sinner in each of us, who makes his or her own will to be more important than anything or anyone … including God’s will. But here’s the news flash. Everyone has an old Adam or an old Eve, and Jesus brings division to each one of us. He wants to put to death the old Adam and the old Eve that tries to remain in control of both the body and the Body of Christ! At the end of the day, the old Adam or Eve will die. God forbid that anyone should die apart from Christ!\n\nDividing Bernard, You, and Me\n\nBernard was born in 1090 to a prominent French noble family. He had a privileged childhood. His father was a highly regarded knight. Like the children of those who graduate from elite schools, like the children who grow up knowing there is no obstacle to their attaining the halls of power, Bernard had a future clearly teeming with worldly possibilities. But his mother died when he was a child, and Bernard was more like his mother than his father. He was not cut out for military life. So, despite opposition from his family, Bernard joined a Cistercian monastery taking with him 30 relatives and friends including his brothers.\n\nBernard rose rapidly in the order and was chosen to be the abbot (or leader) of a new monastery at what became known as Clairvaux. He became highly influential as a preacher and a writer especially of emotional texts like our Hymn of the Day, “O Jesus, King Most Wonderful.” He was very devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary, which seems unsurprising given that his mother died when he was a child. Bernard worked for several years to resolve the controversy when more than one man was elected pope. One of his proteges eventually became pope, and Bernard became highly influential in battling both heresy and intellectualized faith. For a man who chose to enter a religious order known for prayer, work, and much silence, Bernard certainly became the most influential religious leader of the early 12th century. He died in 1153.\n\nAs to Bernard, so does Jesus bring division to each person before and after Baptism. Even when one has been baptized into Jesus’ saving death and resurrection, an interior battle continues between the old sinner and the new child of God until death. The old sinner always has an amazing capacity for rationalization and self-justification. The old sinner’s stock in trade is resentment, and he or she seeks power for power’s sake. Jesus brings division to each one of us as He comes to call us to be crucified with Him in Baptism, not once, but day after day. So, then, the key to assessing Bernard’s witness is that he did not want to be a man of wealth nor did he want to be a bishop or pope. Yet, God used his gifts widely for the well-being of the medieval Church, and Bernard’s witness lives on particularly through beloved hymns of the Church.\n\nSo, then, how does Jesus bring not peace but division to you and me even today? First, He stands as truly God and truly human, the only Savior of the world, and He holds all power and authority in heaven and earth. There is a difference between power and authority. All power in the Church belongs to Christ, who is One with the Father and the Holy Spirit. All authority in the Church belongs to Christ, yet to some, He gives authority to speak and act in His name. When a pastor is ordained, he is given authority to speak and act in Christ’s name. The pastor has no power. All power belongs to Christ, who pours out the Holy Spirit from the Father. So, when the pastor preaches the Word of God, and not his own word, the Word of God causes division as sin is exposed and as sinners are convicted by the Word of God, so that troubled consciences will hasten to confess sins, hear the Word of forgiveness in Jesus’ name, and receive Jesus in Host and Cup. When we receive Jesus in Word and Sacrament, He continues to bring division in us as He strengthens the new child of God created in Baptism and drowns the old sinner within us.\n\nHow does Jesus bring not peace but division to you and me even today? As our Lord says clearly, when He shows up, families and even church families are divided. Simply put, when one member of a family practices his or her Baptism daily, Jesus will bring division between that person and those who do not practice Baptism daily. When persons in Christ’s Church seek power for themselves or for a congregational or even denominational entity, then Jesus brings division, because those who are faithful to Him, as was Bernard, will not bow the knee to those who seek earthly power and glory for themselves. All power and authority belong to Christ.\n\nHow does Jesus bring not peace but division even today? There are huge gatherings that happen week after week, that purport to be the Body of Christ, but when Christ Crucified is not preached as the only way to be saved from sin, death and Satan; when Baptism into Jesus’ death and resurrection is not considered both necessary and a way of life; and when the Lord’s Supper and apostolic teaching are not absolutely central to Sunday worship, then that is not the Body of Christ. They have divided themselves from what Acts 2 describes plainly. Baptism and repentance are necessary (2:38). Christ’s Church continues in apostolic teaching and fellowship, the Breaking of the Bread and the prayers (Acts 2:42). That’s the model for our worship and life.\n\nGod’s Appointed Time Is Now\n\nOur gospel lesson ends with the Lord Jesus’ warning that God’s appointed time is at hand (12:56). Someone who has never heard about Jesus cannot know what she or he doesn’t know. But we have gathered in Jesus’ name this day, and we do know that He is God’s Son, truly God and truly human. The mission of Christ’s Church is not to provide psychological comfort to those who feel bad about themselves or to offer power to those who want to be empowered. The mission of Christ’s Church is not to provide social services for those who do not have all that they need. The mission of Christ’s Church is not to lobby this world’s governments to act in particular ways. The mission of Christ’s Church is to proclaim salvation in no other name than Jesus and to preach that forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation comes only by His death on the cross for us sinners. The mission of Christ’s Church is to call every person to the waters of Baptism and to daily repentance in Jesus’ name. Jesus brings division and not peace when pastors, parishioners, churches, and denominations forget what the mission of Christ’s Church is!\n\nTo those who are baptized into Jesus’ death and resurrection, to those who confess their sins and hear Christ’s Word of forgiveness, and to those who hasten empty-handed to the altar to receive Christ’s true Body and most precious Blood, Jesus gives the peace that the world cannot give. He divides us from the unholy trio of sin, death, and Satan. That’s the peace Jesus brings!\n\nFreed from the need for earthly power or glory, freed from the need to be in control, freed from the need to make a worldly name for ourselves, we can joyfully go out to do as Bernard did. To offer our gifts to God’s glory and to be a blessing to our neighbors. Our acts of mercy in the world we do without need for fame or power, without need to reshape the world according to our own prophetic dreams. Jesus brings division before He brings peace, and anyone who follows Him will renounce everything for Jesus’ sake. Now is the appointed time. Our Lord’s question is before us. Who will die with Jesus now … today?\n\nIn the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\n©Samuel David Zumwalt\n\nszumwalt@bellsouth.net\n\nSt. Matthew’s Ev. Lutheran Church\n\nWilmington, North Carolina USA\n\nBulletin Insert\n\nHoly Lives: St. Bernard of Clairvaux\n\n“Almighty God, your Holy Spirit gives to one the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, and to another the word of faith. We praise you for the gift of grace imparted to your servant Bernard of Clairvaux, and we pray that by his teaching we may be led to a fuller knowledge of the truth which we have seen in your Son Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.” (The Daily Prayer of the Church).\n\nListening\n\nLuke 12:49 “I came to cast fire on the earth, and would that it were already kindled!”\n\nSt. Cyril [early 5th century Patriarch of Alexandria]: “We affirm that the fire that Christ sent out is for humanity’s salvation and profit. May God grant that all our hearts be full of this. The fire is the saving message of the gospel and the power of its commandments. We were cold and dead because of sin and in ignorance of him who by nature is truly God. The gospel ignites all of us on earth to a life of piety and makes us fervent in spirit, according to the expression of blessed Paul. Besides this, we are also made partakers of the Holy Spirit, who is like a fire within us. We have been baptized with fire and the Holy Spirit” (Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture: Luke, 217).\n\nLuke 12:51 “Do you think that I have come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.”\n\nSt. Ambrose [4th century Bishop of Milan, Italy]: “Spiritual understanding is at work in every passage of the Gospels. In the present case, fearing that the rigidity of a simple explanation may offend someone, the sequence of the sense is to be qualified by spiritual depth…We will believe that the Lord took care to advise reverence for the Godhead at the same time as the grace of piety. He said, ‘You will love the Lord you God, and you will love your neighbor.’ Is the present so changed as to erase the names of close kin and set affections at variance?” (218).\n\nLuke 12:52 “For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.”\n\nSt. Ambrose: “Are we to believe that He has commanded discord within families? How is He our peace, who has made both one? How does He himself say, ‘My peace I give to you, my peace I leave with you,’ if He has come to separate fathers from sons and sons from fathers by the division of households? How is he cursed who dishonors his father and devout who forsakes him? If we observe that the first is because of religion and the second through piety, we shall think this question is simple. It is necessary that we should esteem the human less than the divine. If honor is to be paid to parents, how much more to your parents’ Creator, to whom you owe gratitude for your parents?” (218).\n\nLuke 12:53 “They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”\n\nSt. Ambrose: “You are not forbidden to love your parents, but you are forbidden to prefer them to God. Natural children are true blessings from the Lord, and no one must love the blessing that he has received more than God by whom the blessing once received is preserved” (218).\n\nReflecting\n\n1. Do my prayers, worship, and study of God’s Word reflect my preference for God over all?\n\nLearning\n\n(Read this aloud daily until everyone in your home can say it from memory.)\n\nChristian Questions with Their Answers\n\nPrepared by Dr. Martin Luther for those who intend to go to the Sacrament.\n\nAfter confession and instruction in the Ten Commandments, the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Sacraments of Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper, the past may ask, or Christians may ask themselves these questions.\n\n15. What should we do when we eat His body and drink His blood, and in this way receive His pledge?\n\nWe should remember and proclaim His death and the shedding of His blood, as He taught us: This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\n\n16. Why should we remember and proclaim His death?\n\nFirst, so we may learn to believe that no creature could make satisfaction for our sins. Only Christ, true God and man, could do that. Second, so we may learn to be horrified by our sins, and to regard them as very serious. Third, so we may find joy and comfort in Christ alone, and through faith in Him be saved.\n\n17. What motivated Christ to die and make full payment for your sins?\n\nHis great love for His Father and for me and other sinners, as it is written in John 14; Romans 5; Galatians 2; and Ephesians 5.\n\n18. Finally, why do you wish to go to the Sacrament?\n\nThat I may learn to believe that Christ, out of great love, died for my sin, and also learn from Him to love God and my neighbor (Luther’s Small Catechism).\n\nDoing\n\n1. Pray for every unbaptized child and adult you know and for the child’s parents, too.\n\n2. Pray for your unchurched loved ones and friends. Invite one or more of them to worship.\n\n3. Join us at 9:45 a.m. in Room 117 for “The Benedict Option” discussion group. Mark the date for Rally Day on August 25 in your calendar!\n\n4. Hang a crucifix or cross opposite your pillow so that the last sight you see before turning out the light is your Lord’s cross and the first sight of the new day reminds you to pray.\n\nFor Husbands and Wives\n\nRepeat daily: “I (name) take you (name) to be my wedded wife (husband), to have and to hold from this day forward; for better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness and in health; to love and to cherish until death do us part, according to God’s holy ordinance, and thereto I pledge you my faith.”"
