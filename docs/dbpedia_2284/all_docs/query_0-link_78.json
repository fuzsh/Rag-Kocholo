        "text": "Image: Pope Francis walks with young people during his visit to the Sanctuary of the Holy House on the feast of the Annunciation in Loreto, Italy, March 25, 2019\n\nPhoto: CNS photo/Vatican Media\n\nFor Francis, the authority of the papacy does not rest on whether people kiss his ring but on faithfulness to the carpenter from Nazareth\n\nThere is no mention of it in the Gospels, nor is it a matter of Church doctrine or apostolic tradition. But the question of whether or not to kiss the ring of a Pope has been the subject of intense debate among Catholics after a video of Pope Francis awkwardly withdrawing his hand from some people greeting him at a shrine in Loreto went viral.\n\nThe custom of kissing the ring of the Pope, or any bishop, was developed as a way of showing respect for the office that individual held and is also linked to kissing the hands of a newly ordained priest as a sign of respect for the sacraments that he will now bring to the people.\n\nOne of the symbols of the papal office is the “Fisherman’s ring” (St Peter, the first Pope, was a fisherman) which dates back the 13th century as it was used to seal documents. Francis only wears the fisherman’s ring for special ceremonies and prefers to wear the one he had as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, in Argentina.\n\nThis kissing custom can seem strange to outsiders, but the Catholic faith takes symbolic gestures very seriously and is a sacramental religion which embraces the senses. During Mass the faithful consume Christ’s body and blood in the form of bread and wine; priests use water and oil when they baptise and, next month, on Good Friday, millions of believers will profess their faith by lining up to kiss a crucifix.\n\nThere is always a danger, however, of mixing up the essentials of faith with the accruements of the past, and in this case, the focus is over a ritual attached to a time when Popes operated as quasi-monarchs exercising secular power.\n\nA few caveats are needed before the Francis critics jump to the assumption that he is doing away with “yet another” tradition.\n\nIn response to the furore, the Vatican says that sometimes the Pope likes the custom and sometimes not, and there is no sign he is going to issue a ruling on the practice (in fact, it was Benedict XVI who told journalist Peter Seewald he had formally abolished the custom although “no-one followed the new protocol”). The shorter viral video from Loreto should also be watched with the longer version which shows a number of people kissing Francis’ ring.\n\nThere are also practical considerations. It is not uncommon for this Pope to try and individually meet several hundred people in a single day either in the Vatican or when traveling abroad. Waiting for people to bend down to kiss his ring is time-consuming, tiring and limits the number of individuals Francis can meet.\n\nNevertheless, it is clear that that the natural preference for this Pope is for people to greet him and to maintain eye contact rather than dropping to their knees to kiss his hands. One of the reasons is that he has repeatedly called for Church leaders to maintain a “closeness” to its people, and for the world to develop a culture of “encounter” – the ring kissing exercise places a barrier to both.\n\nWhile it is no doubt sincerely intended by those who do it, kissing the ring creates a certain distance and cuts off any chance of talking to the Pope or engaging with him. While defenders of the practice say they are showing respect to the Pontificate, the reality is that it has become a way of reverencing an “idea” of the papacy that is remote and ossified in the past.\n\nRead More: https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/11524/does-pope-francis-not-want-people-to-kiss-the-papal-ring-\n\nThe Holy See today announced that Pope Francis has appointed Bishop Robert Byrne as Bishop of the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle.\n\nBishop Byrne succeeds The Right Reverend Séamus Cunningham, who has been Bishop of the Diocese since 2009. Bishop Byrne will be the fourteenth Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle.\n\nBishop Byrne was born in Manchester on 22 September 1956. He was ordained priest in 1985 and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Birmingham on 13 May, 2014.\n\nSpeaking of his appointment, Bishop Byrne said: “I am deeply humbled by the trust Pope Francis has placed in me with this appointment as Bishop of Hexham & Newcastle.\n\n“I would like to thank the people and priests of the Archdiocese of Birmingham where I have served for the past five years and, in particular, Archbishop Bernard for his constant kindness and support.\n\n“I look forward to making my home in the North East, with its rich Christian heritage, and also getting to know and serve the people, deacons, religious and priests of the Diocese. I ask all of you to keep me in your prayers as I pray for you.”\n\nBishop Cunningham said: “I am delighted to welcome Bishop Byrne as my successor at a time of great challenge and hope in this Diocese. The Lord Jesus is leading us along a road of rich discernment for the future of the Church and its mission. I know that the priests, deacons, religious and people of the Diocese will warmly welcome him and assure him of our prayers. May the Lord bless his ministry among us. We commend him to Mary the Mother of God, St Cuthbert and all the saints of our Diocese.”\n\nThe Most Reverend Bernard Longley, Archbishop of Birmingham, said: “I am delighted for the Church in Northumbria and Durham and for Bishop Robert that he has been appointed Bishop of Hexham & Newcastle. Bishop Robert has spent his entire priestly ministry in the Archdiocese as an Oratorian in Birmingham and Oxford and we shall miss him very much.\n\n“Bishop Robert will carry his love and knowledge of Blessed John Henry Newman into his new ministry. Bishop Robert renews the bond of affection and faith between our two dioceses which the late Bishop Kevin Dunne had done so much to encourage. May St Chad and St Cuthbert inspire Bishop Robert as he prepares for his new ministry.”\n\nBishop Robert Byrne’s Episcopal Installation will be celebrated in St Mary’s Cathedral, Newcastle, on Monday 25 March. Full details will be confirmed closer to the date.\n\nhttp://catholicnews.org.uk/apostolic-appointment-040219\n\nFurther information available from: Monsignor Andrew Faley\n\nDiocesan Press Officer – 07971 875902 – pressofficer@rcdhn.org.uk\n\nAn initiative of Catholic bishops in cooperation with the “Bible Society” will support and fund new proposals. The project includes a Gospel for people with autism and the Gospel of Matthew in sign language for hearing-impaired persons. Initiatives include a work of art brought across all twenty-two Catholic dioceses of England and Wales to “initiate a conversation with God” and concerts of migrant choirs\n\nThe year 2020 is dedicated to the rediscovery of the Holy Scriptures, on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the “Verbum Domini”, the apostolic exhortation of Pope Benedict, and 1600 years since the death of Saint Jerome. The initiative is jointly promoted by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales and the “Bible society”, a charity that brings the Bible to over 200 Countries. Fleur Dorrell, coordinator of the activities, illustrated the program to SIR.\n\nFull immersion into the Scriptures. The ‘ Year of the God Who Speaks’ will begin next September 30th at the National Gallery with a recorded message by Catholic Primate Vincent Nichols. This is an initiative planned by Catholic bishops in cooperation with the “Bible Society”, that will support and fund the new activities of the Year. The project includes a Gospel for people with autism and the Gospel of Matthew in sign language for hearing-impaired persons. Initiatives include a work of art brought across all twenty-two Catholic dioceses of England and Wales to “initiate a conversation with God” and several concerts of migrant choirs.\n\nInspired by verbum Domini. Fleur Connell and the bishop of Wrexham Peter Brignall had the idea of dedicating twelve months to a full immersion into the Scriptures. “We are members of a study group on the Scriptures within the Evangelization and Catechesis department of the Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales”, said Fleur Dorrell.\n\n“We thought it would be a wonderful idea for the English Catholic Church to dedicate a full year to the Scriptures in an unprecedented manner. We were inspired by the tenth anniversary of Pope Benedict XVI’s Apostolic Exhortation “Verbum Domini” and by the year marking 1600 years since the death of Saint Jerome, the Father and Doctor of the Church who translated the Greek text of most of the Old Testament into Latin and all the Hebrew Bible.”Kickoff at the National Gallery. The “Year of the God Who Speaks” will begin at the National Gallery on September 30th, Feast Day of Saint Jerome. In a video message screened with a portrait of the Saint in Trafalgar square, in the heart of London, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Catholic Primate of England and Wales, will illustrate the figure of Saint Jerome and his import as pre-eminent Catholic Biblical scholar. “We wish to find new, unprecedented ways to promote the Bible “, said Fleur Dorrell. “Using creativity to communicate the message that the Bible is a thriving, dynamic way to speak of God.”\n\nActivities for everyone. During the “Year of the God Who Speaks” the Catholic Church of England and Wales will have the opportunity to listen to the voices of a wide range of groups, giving special relevance to migrants and political refugees. “The choirs that will tour the Country will provide this group of people with the opportunity to express themselves in their native language thereby involving many different people through their music”, Dorrell pointed out.\n\n“People with disabilities constitute another important group. We are reflecting on how to bring the Holy Scriptures to the visually-impaired or to people who are simply lacking the educational background to understand the Bible.” A truly ecumenical year. The coordinator of the “Year of the God Who Speaks” explained that organizations representing people with disabilities asked her to prepare a Gospel for visual learners addressed to individuals with autism, along with a Gospel of Matthew in sign language for people with hearing impairment.\n\nRead More: https://agensir.it/europa/2019/01/29/great-britain-2020-will-be-dedicated-to-the-rediscovery-of-the-holy-scriptures/\n\nPope Francis should write a post-synodal apostolic exhortation following the close of the 2018 Synod of Bishops on young people, the faith and vocational discernment.\n\nAt the Sept. 18, 2018, press conference announcing the pope’s apostolic constitution Episcopalis Communio on changes to the rules concerning voting members and the preparation for synods, Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri, secretary general of the Synod of Bishops, suggested that Francis might elect not to write a post-synodal exhortation. He might simply affirm that the final synod document is taught exercising his ordinary magisterium, according to Baldisseri.\n\nThe practice of writing an apostolic exhortation after a Synod of Bishops became a regular practice during the pontificate of John Paul II, something Benedict XVI and Francis have continued up to now. After the Oct. 3-28, 2018, synod on young people, it is not yet clear what path the Holy Father will choose: write an apostolic exhortation or simply accept the synod’s final document as is.\n\nHaving studied the major synod documents — the preparatory document from January 2017, the young people’s pre-synodal meeting document from March 2018, the instrumentum laboris from June 2018, and now the final document of the Synod of Bishops — and followed as closely as possible the daily briefings about interventions from the floor, I feel strongly that the final synod document is not enough. There are at least a few reasons it remains inadequate.\n\nIt is a compromise document, which required the majority of delegates to approve the text, paragraph by paragraph, in order for it to be finally accepted. The result of this laborious approval process is exactly what one might expect: The language was watered down, certain topics were qualified or removed all together, and what began with the potential for a bold, prophetic and inspiring message was reduced to a disappointing state of unremarkable generality.\n\nThere are also clues in the final document itself that the bishops anticipated readers might be less than thrilled with their text. In a telling move, they suggest in the introduction that readers of the final document also read the instrumentum laboris alongside it for, in their estimation, these documents are complementary. Some bishops admitted that readers would notice that several themes appearing in the earlier working document were absent from the final document and might criticize the document or the process.\n\nTheir solution was to give extra homework to readers: Read both texts together. This adds another layer of complication.\n\nWhat are readers to make of the mention of the themes or terms (e.g., use of acronym “LGBT”) found in the instrumentum laboris but absent in the final document? Which text takes precedence where there is a discrepancy? If the pope were not to write a post-synodal apostolic exhortation, then how would he account for this instruction to read the instrumentum laboris as the complement to the final document? Does he somehow bring these texts together?\n\nThere is currently no mechanism to resolve this novel tension.\n\nThere are also the issues of length, repetition and clarity. Insisting that readers of the final document must also read the pre-synodal working document only makes the material more cumbersome (the instrumentum laboris adds an additional 214 paragraphs to the final document’s already-lengthy 164 paragraphs) and confusing.\n\nBeyond the confusion around how to negotiate the two-text solution, there is the matter of the uninspiring and, at times, didactic tone of the final document. A question that regularly surfaced for me while reading it was: For whom was this written? What is the audience of this text?\n\nFrancis’ vision of the synodal process is one of accompaniment, dialogue and listening. This conversational and inviting style resulted in an honest, direct and insightful response from the young people who gathered in March 2018. To a lesser degree, though still better than the final document, the instrumentum laboris carries a feeling of “we’re in this together,” regularly citing the feedback from young people as well as input from dioceses and bishops’ conferences around the world.\n\nBut the final document notably lacks this feel. Its tenor is more closely aligned with a “father knows best” approach, which speaks more in the royal “we” (as in “we, the bishops”) and addresses young adults in the second or third person rather than as fellow and equal members of the church, which is at the heart of Lumen Gentium and any Vatican II ecclesiology.\n\nAn example of this dissonant ecclesiological tone appears at the outset of the document. In the “preamble” of the text, the bishops recount the story of the resurrected Jesus appearing to the two disciples journeying on the road to Emmaus as depicted at the end of Luke’s Gospel. According to published reports from the English-speaking working groups, this pericope was selected to illustrate the spirit of accompaniment the bishops wished to highlight as the governing theme of synodality in general and the text on young people in particular.\n\nBut as Jesuit Fr. Thomas Reese observed, it seems that the bishops may have misidentified just who is which character in the narrative.\n\nThis is a truly magnificent story, but if the bishops think they are Jesus and young people are the disciples, they missed the whole point Francis was trying to make. We are all disciples, and the disciples’ confusion before Jesus joins them is reflective of the entire church. Or to put it another way, sometimes Jesus may be the young explaining things to the bishops.\n\nThere are several clear and simple reasons why it makes sense for Francis to write a post-synodal exhortation on young people.\n\nFirst, young people deserve to be taken seriously and not just politely listened to and then treated with what might rightly be viewed as well-meaning paternalism (or, worse, condescension). A post-synodal apostolic exhortation could restate with directness and clarity the vision of synodality Francis signaled before and during the synod, a vision consistent throughout his pontificate. It calls for a disposition of accompaniment marked by mutuality, respect, humility, listening, openness to challenge, and good-faith understanding. Francis could address young people directly as his sisters and brothers, as the equal members of the body of Christ that they are, and not merely the ecclesiastical charges they appear to be in the eyes of some bishops.\n\nSecond, young people deserve assurance that their experiences matter and that, though confusing or even offensive to some synod participants, the diversity of their experiences is not a threat to authentic church life and communion but, as St. Paul once reminded the Corinthians, it is the very condition that makes the church possible in the first place.\n\nTo this end, Francis, who has not shied away from using the moniker “gay” and is known to have friends in same-sex relationships, could do a lot to build trust among LGBTQ persons by using the self-referential terms they prefer, thereby acknowledging their inherent dignity and value.\n\nThird, young people deserve more direct answers to their queries about the role of women in the church and society. When half the world’s population is in question, the issue of women in the church is not merely a “Western ploy” or the agenda of “radical feminists,” but a matter that calls for serious and concerted reflection, change and implementation.\n\nMore inclusive leadership does not necessarily mean changing who is admitted to holy orders — appointing more female parish administrators, diocesan chancellors and curial officials is an approach that can begin today. But with the conclusion of the pontifical commission on women and the diaconate’s work in hand, Francis might take this opportunity to address female leadership in the church with changes to the diaconate.\n\nRead More: https://www.ncronline.org/news/opinion/faith-seeking-understanding/young-people-deserve-hear-directly-pope-francis-synod\n\nThe Holy Land Coordination stands in solidarity with all Christians in Israel and Palestine. Our ongoing advocacy for a just peace is informed by an annual pilgrimage to meet with our sisters and brothers, listen to them, and witness the challenges they face. This year our focus has been those Christians who live in the state of Israel.\n\nStanding in solidarity with Israel’s Christians\n\nThroughout our visit we have experienced how there are Israeli citizens from many different backgrounds who coexist and work together for the Common Good of their society. We recognise that Israel was founded on the stated principles of equality between all its citizens. This urgently needs to become the lived reality.\n\nIsrael’s Christians wish to live as full citizens, with their rights recognised in a plural and democratic society. We have seen the vital contribution that they make especially through schools, hospitals, involvement in public life and attempting to build bridges between different faiths.\n\nYet it is clear that at the same time they face profound difficulties across all aspects of their lives. We have heard that, along with other Palestinian Arab citizens and migrants living in Israel, many Christians find themselves systematically discriminated against and marginalised.\n\nThose we met expressed particular concern about the Nation State Law that was passed since our last visit to the Holy Land. Local Christian leaders have warned that this creates a “constitutional and legal basis for discrimination” against minorities, undermining the ideals of equality, justice and democracy.[1] We stand with Israel’s Christians and all those challenging discrimination, in support of their call to protect the country’s pluralism.\n\nAs we approach this Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, we reaffirm our solidarity with all of the Churches here, and pray that Christians may work more closely together in the pursuit of justice and peace.\n\nHuman dignity under occupation\n\nOur delegation also travelled to Palestine, where despite the faith and resilience of those we met, the misery of occupation has been deepened by severe cuts to humanitarian funding by the US government.\n\nHealthcare, education and other basic services for refugees are being increasingly threatened, exacerbating the ongoing violations of their fundamental human dignity. This cannot be ignored or tolerated.\n\nWe call upon our own governments to help meet the funding gaps now faced by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and redouble their efforts towards a diplomatic solution, with two democratic sovereign states of Israel and Palestine existing in peace.\n\nHope for the future\n\nWe are a people who believe in the truth of the Resurrection and so we have hope for the future. As we return to our home countries we echo the words of Pope Francis:\n\n“Always know in your heart that God is by your side; he never abandons you! Let us never lose hope! Let us never allow it to die in our hearts!”[2]\n\nWe admire our sisters and brothers in the Holy Land for not losing hope and we commit ourselves through prayer, pilgrimage and practical solidarity, to helping keep that hope alive.\n\nBishop Declan Lang – England and Wales (Chair of the Holy Land Coordination)\n\nBishop Stephen Ackermann – Germany\n\nArchbishop Stephen Brislin – South Africa\n\nArchbishop Timothy Broglio – United States of America\n\nBishop Peter Bürcher – Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden\n\nBishop Rodolfo Cetoloni – Italy\n\nBishop Christopher Chessun – the Church of England\n\nBishop Michel Dubost – France\n\nBishop Lionel Gendron – Canada\n\nBishop Felix Gmur – Switzerland\n\nBishop William Kenney – England and Wales\n\nBishop Alan McGuckian – Ireland\n\nBishop William Nolan – Scotland\n\nBishop José Ornelas Carvalho – Portugal\n\nBishop Noel Treanor – Ireland\n\nPope Francis delivered a homily at Mass on New Year’s Day, the Solemnity of the Mother of God. On 1 January, the Church also observes the World Day of Peace.\n\nFull official English translation of Pope Francis’ homily for the Mass on New Year’s Day\n\nHomily of His Holiness Pope Francis\n\nSolemnity of Mary, Mother of God\n\n1 January 2018\n\nThe year opens in the name of the Mother. Mother of God is the most important title of Our Lady. But we might ask why we say Mother of God, and not Mother of Jesus. In the past some wanted to be content simply with the latter, but the Church has declared that Mary is the Mother of God. We should be grateful, because these words contain a magnificent truth about God and about ourselves. From the moment that our Lord became incarnate in Mary, and for all time, he took on our humanity. There is no longer God without man; the flesh Jesus took from his Mother is our own, now and for all eternity. To call Mary the Mother of God reminds us of this: God is close to humanity, even as a child is close to the mother who bears him in her womb.\n\nThe word mother (mater) is related to the word matter. In his Mother, the God of heaven, the infinite God, made himself small, he became matter, not only to be with us but also to be like us. This is the miracle, the great novelty! Man is no longer alone; no more an orphan, but forever a child. The year opens with this novelty. And we proclaim it by saying: Mother of God! Ours is the joy of knowing that our solitude has ended. It is the beauty of knowing that we are beloved children, of knowing that this childhood of ours can never be taken away from us. It is to see a reflection of ourselves in the frail and infant God resting in his mother’s arms, and to realize that humanity is precious and sacred to the Lord. Henceforth, to serve human life is to serve God. All life, from life in the mother’s womb to that of the elderly, the suffering and the sick, and to that of the troublesome and even repellent, is to be welcomed, loved and helped.\n\nLet us now be guided by today’s Gospel. Only one thing is said about the Mother of God: “Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart” (Lk 2:19). She kept them. She simply kept; Mary does not speak. The Gospel does not report a single word of hers in the entire account of Christmas. Here too, the Mother is one with her Son: Jesus is an “infant”, a child “unable to speak”. The Word of God, who “long ago spoke in many and various ways” (Heb 1:1), now, in the “fullness of time” (Gal 4:4), is silent. The God before whom all fall silent is himself a speechless child. His Majesty is without words; his mystery of love is revealed in lowliness. This silence and lowliness is the language of his kingship. His Mother joins her Son and keeps these things in silence.\n\nThat silence tells us that, if we would “keep” ourselves, we need silence. We need to remain silent as we gaze upon the crib. Pondering the crib, we discover anew that we are loved; we savour the real meaning of life. As we look on in silence, we let Jesus speak to our heart. His lowliness lays low our pride; his poverty challenges our outward display; his tender love touches our hardened hearts. To set aside a moment of silence each day to be with God is to “keep” our soul; it is to “keep” our freedom from being corroded by the banality of consumerism, the blare of commercials, the stream of empty words and the overpowering waves of empty chatter and loud shouting.\n\nRead More: https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2018-01/pope-homily-new-year-2018-mother-of-god-full-text.html\n\nEaster Vigil homily by His Grace, Archbishop Bernard Longley\n\nYou are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he has risen, he is not here.\n\nThree of our Lord’s disciples came together on the day after his death. The Gospel of St Mark tells us that they waited until the sabbath was over before preparing burial spices and then meeting together to plan what they would do. We can imagine what this particular sabbath day must have been like for these three women, Mary Magdalen, Mary the mother of James and Salome.\n\nIn common with all the Lord’s disciples they must have felt devastated that the Master should suddenly be arrested at dead of night and executed like a criminal. Every bereavement leaves us bereft, but for the disciples who had built their lives and their hopes on the promises of Christ, his death on the cross must have shattered their trust and left them dazed and uncertain what to do.\n\nAnd so these women did what they knew – they did what was familiar to them, just as the apostles would a few days later, when they returned to their fishing nets and boats. The three women planned to go to the tomb of Jesus and to anoint his body as a final gesture of love. It was all they could think of doing.\n\nTonight we accompany the two Marys and Salome as they keep vigil for the dawn, waiting for the light to enable them to set out across the city of Jerusalem before the busyness of the day would begin. As they waited they must have gone over the things that Jesus had told them, remembering his parables and his teachings, the deeds of kindness and the miracles, the way that people had reacted to him, the ways they had been changed.\n\nAs we have listened in the stillness to the story of creation and redemption we have also been recounting the deeds of the Son of God, pondering on all that he said and did and on how it has forever changed our lives. We have recalled these things not just for ourselves but especially for those who are going to be baptised and confirmed tonight. Dear friends, you have been waiting and longing for this moment when you will enter into the Paschal Mystery of the Lord’s dying and rising to new life.\n\nSt Mark’s Gospel account conveys the same sense of longing. We are drawn into the restlessness and longing that have kept the two Marys and Salome awake and waiting with their eyes peering through the darkness to see the first light of dawn: very early in the morning…they went to the tomb, just as the sun was rising. They were no to realise that nature’s beautiful gift of the dawn is only the palest reflection of the resurrection of the Son of God.\n\nEven though the darkness of fear and sadness had overshadowed them, when they looked they could see that the stone…had already been rolled back. We are often like the three women, on those occasions when we see the very first signs of something that is truly extraordinary but we are not yet sure what they can mean. These women were gradually prepared for the full truth to dawn upon them. They saw more than the stone and the empty tomb.\n\nThey did not immediately see the risen Lord himself but they saw a young man in a white robe, and their eyes must have looked in utter astonishment to where he was pointing as he said: See, here is the place where they laid him. With the best of intentions they had planned to anoint the lifeless body of Jesus. For them the embalming oil of sadness and loss became the oil of gladness as a new hope sprang up in their hearts. They received a new mission, bearing good news top Peter and the apostles: He is going before you to Galilee; it is there you will see him, just as he told you.\n\nTonight we welcome our new brothers and sisters in Christ as they prepare to receive the gifts of the risen Lord. You have also been given a new mission as the Lord’s disciples. Tonight you see the Lord in a new way and he gives you a lamp for your feet and a light on your path. You join us as fellow pilgrims on the Catholic Church’s long pilgrimage of faith. You will be anointed with the Oil of Chrism and you will receive the light of Christ to show you the path of life.\n\nAs we look up at the light of the Paschal candle tonight we realise that our sharing in the Lord’s resurrection is an outpouring of God’s mercy upon us. In a remarkable insight Pope St John Paul II described the resurrection itself as an act of a merciful Father towards his beloved Son. In his second Encyclical Letter Dives in Misericordia or Rich in Mercy, written in 1980, he said: In his resurrection the Son of God experienced in a radical way mercy shown to himself – that is to say, the love of the Father which is more powerful than death. What he has received from his Father our Lord freely shares with us.\n\nMay the light of the risen and merciful Christ continue to burn brightly within us throughout the coming fifty days of Eastertide and beyond.\n\nHis Grace, Archbishop Bernard Longley\n\nIt is accomplished.\n\nToday we meet each other at the foot of the cross. The arms of Jesus stretched out upon the cross draw us from all corners of the earth. It is the still centre of God’s creation and of human history where all our lives converge. All the pathways we have trodden meet at this point, under the sign of Jesus’ triumph over sin and death.\n\nWhen we come to the foot of the cross we are not alone with the crucified one. His mother is there beside him together with St John. We have just listened to St John’s Gospel proclaiming the events of the Passion in a way that touches our hearts because we know that he has recalled what he has witnessed – and what he witnessed changed his life completely.\n\nIt is accomplished. With those words our Lord’s earthly life and the torture of his terrible death come to an end – but they end with an meaning and purpose. What Jesus accomplished through the sacrifice of his own life is salvation for the world and this is what we celebrate at every Mass.\n\nAs we look up at the Lord upon his cross we hold in our minds the image of his Last Supper, when he took bread, broke it and gave it to his disciples saying This is my body. On Calvary he freely gave his body to the executioners, it was broken for our sins and the fruit of his death is shared with all humanity in the gift of new life, the life of the resurrection.\n\nWhen we approach the cross to venerate it today we hear the Reproaches from the Book of Lamentations: My people, what have I done to you? How have I offended you? Answer me. Here is another echo from St John’s Gospel, where our Lord speaks these words of reproof: You study the scriptures, believing that in them you have eternal life; now these same scriptures testify to me, and yet you refuse to come to me for life!\n\nToday, Lord, we do not refuse to come to you for life. We approach the foot of your cross, in sorrow for our own sins and for the sins of the world – yet also confident that you will raise us up with yourself to the new life of Easter. We adore thee, O Christ, and we praise thee. Because by thy holy cross thou hast redeemed the world.\n\nFor more images see: http://www.stchadscathedral.org.uk/gallery/\n\nCHRISM MASS – ST CHAD’S CATHEDRAL, BIRMINGHAM\n\nHomily preached by His Grace, Archbishop Bernard Longley\n\nHe made us…priests to serve his God and Father.\n\nA few weeks ago I was in conversation with one of our priests, reflecting on our experiences of ministry over the years. We went on to think about the different influences on our lives, the people and the events that had fostered our sense of vocation and the way that the years had shaped our expectations and our response to the Lord’s calling. At different times we had had to rely on a variety of skills, as well as help from others, depending on the demands or needs of the particular ministries we had been asked to fulfil.\n\nMy companion recalled the unforgettable day of his ordination by Archbishop Maurice. He told me how he had felt on approaching the moment of ordination in front of his parents, family members and friends from the parish and beyond – the overwhelming sense of joyful gratitude and the excitement about what lay before him in the parishes and chaplaincies where he imagined he would serve. At the heart of all this was his unquestioning trust in our Lord and his sense that, whatever challenges lay ahead, he was receiving grace sufficient to meet them with peace of mind.\n\nOur conversation reminded me of the first stirrings of curiosity that made me wonder as a young altar-server about the life of my parish priest at home. I remember the strong sense he conveyed of being part of a brotherhood of priests, his sense of belonging to the local diocese and his well-rehearsed stories of diocesan clergy that amused and intrigued me. It was evident to me as a child that he enjoyed being a priest and that he couldn’t imagine a more fulfilling way of life than this life of service at Christ’s bidding.\n\nWhen ordaining a priest the bishop will often refer to, and occasionally use in its entirety, the ordination homily in the Roman Pontifical. As we consider the gift of the priesthood, our daily invitation to be configured to Christ the anointed one, we do well to recall the model of priesthood which was set before us on the day of our ordination, as well as our own energy and zeal, making the prospect of priestly service so compelling and desirable.\n\nAt our ordination we were anointed to become teachers and witnesses. The homily invites us to focus on the people we are ordained to serve. Let the doctrine you teach be true nourishment for the people of God. Let the example of your life attract the followers of Christ, so that by word and action you may build up the house which is God’s Church.\n\nAt the Chrism Mass we celebrate our relationship with Christ and with one another as brother priests. This is one of the few occasions each year when we are called together by the Church from across the many communities of our widespread Archdiocese. Today we pray for each other and at the renewal of our priestly promises we also witness side-by-side to our fidelity to the irrevocable call we received from the Lord when we were ordained.\n\nBut one of the defining characteristics of our ministry which we also share is its focus on the community from which we have been drawn by our sense of calling and which we have been commissioned to serve. The ordination homily invites us to recognise what we owe to the people who have helped to shape our faith and the priorities that should shape our mission today. Remember that you are chosen from among God’s people and appointed to act for them in relation to God. Do your part in the work of Christ the Priest with genuine joy and love, and attend to the concerns of Christ before your own.\n\nThis year we will have special opportunities to reflect on our priesthood in the context of our service of God’s holy people. It may be through helping families or couples prepare for the World Gathering of Families in Dublin this August. As priests we are privileged with the opportunity to help couples to prepare for the sacrament of matrimony. We are also challenged by the unwillingness or unpreparedness of so many genuinely good people today to celebrate this sacrament before establishing their home and family together. We must try to enable them to see Jesus Christ more clearly and to see his abiding presence within the sacramental union to which he is continually calling them.\n\nThis year we also encourage our people to deepen in their devotion to Christ’s real presence in the Eucharist as we prepare for the Adoremus National Eucharistic Congress in September. Our response as priests to Adoremus will be seen through our manner of celebrating the Mass, for this is the gift of Christ’s presence that he has sent us to bring into the heart of each parish community. We shall be conscious of this most of all at the Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Maundy Thursday.\n\nAdoremus should also inspire us to speak of our love for the Lord’s presence in the Blessed Sacrament when we preach and to witness to it when we come together in Eucharistic adoration. At such times we hear another echo of the ordination homily: you must carry out your mission of sanctifying in the power of Christ. Your ministry will perfect the spiritual sacrifice of the faithful by uniting it to Christ’s sacrifice, the sacrifice which is offered sacramentally through your hands.\n\nI am looking forward to inaugurating a diocesan Year for Priests on the Feast of the Sacred Heart this June. There will be a number of opportunities for us to come together to reflect on the gift of the priesthood and to share our sense of vocation with our parishioners. As priests we try to foster a culture of vocation which enables all the baptised to hear and recognise the call of Christ in their lives. But, just as married couples are the best promoters of marriage, Religious brothers and sisters of the call to Religious life and deacons to the Permanent Diaconate, so priests have a unique gift to awaken within the hearts of others the call of Christ to share in his priesthood along with us.\n\nAs we prepare for the Renewal of Priestly Promises may these words of Archbishop Chaput of Philadelphia encourage you, as they have encouraged me, to be grateful to the Lord for calling us to be his priestly witnesses in the world today.\n\nWhile all Christians have the duty to preach the Gospel, priests are the Word’s special stewards. And, like the servants in the Parable of the Talents, we who are priests will be held more accountable in this missionary task than our people, for we are their shepherds. But second and more importantly, faith that is not shared dies. “Maintenance-mode” Christianity does not exist. Happiness for the priest depends on our bringing others to know Jesus Christ, and deepening the roots of the word in the hearts of those who already profess him. If priests do not live the ministry of the word ardently and actively, we cannot be happy, because we are made to be a model and sacrifice for others. We are made to witness.\n\nFor more photos see: http://www.stchadscathedral.org.uk/gallery/\n\nHomily by His Grace, Archbishop Bernard Longley\n\nBlessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord.\n\nThis morning, I am grateful that the staff and seminarians from Oscott are with us to begin Holy Week and that we shall be together for the liturgies of this week. We began our liturgy this morning by enacting the triumphal procession of our Lord into the city of Jerusalem. Our own procession, carrying our palm branches, symbolises the mission that we have received to witness to our faith within our cities and towns.\n\nOur Lord knew that he would face opposition and rejection as he entered the city. When we witness to our faith we also have to face up to the real challenges that lie before us in contemporary British society. One of those challenges is today’s widespread but simple ignorance of the basic facts of Christian belief. Many people have either forgotten the story of the life of Jesus, or they have never yet heard it, or they can only half-remember a few isolated episodes. We have to re-present this story for the people of our own day and in such a way that they can grasp and understand it.\n\nToday we have been re-telling the story of the dramatic events of the last week of our Lord’s life. In the first Gospel and the procession of palms we recalled liturgically how Jesus was recognised as the anointed one by the people of Jerusalem. They welcomed the coming of God’s Kingdom in his Messiah: Blessings on the coming kingdom of our father David! All of this takes on a particular poignancy when we view it in the light of everything that happened within a few days.\n\nWe have just narrated the story of the passion and it is a most compelling account, full of the best and the worst of which our human nature is capable. As a story it has the power to capture everyone’s imagination and to touch their emotions because it is the culmination of the Lord’s life-work, the final working out of God’s eternal plan of salvation. It contains many elements that we can readily recognise through our own experience.\n\nEverything that is negative, harmful or sinful in this story reflects the experience of our own lives – the misunderstandings and disagreements, the deceits and betrayals, the selfishness and fears, together with the Lord’s own painful sense of abandonment – all of these are swept up in Christ’s suffering on the Cross and they are transformed. And this is not a fictional dramas – this is real and it has the power to change us.\n\nThis is the story that we are part of and that we must tell again to others so that their lives can be transformed as well. In this morning’s Office of Readings there is a beautiful reflection by St Andrew of Crete which can be a guide for our journey through Holy Week:\n\nWe must spread ourselves under Christ’s feet, not coats or branches or lifeless shoots of trees, matter which wastes away and delights the eye only for a few brief hours. But we have clothed ourselves with Christ’s grace, or with the whole Christ – ‘for as many of you as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ’ – so let us spread ourselves like coats under his feet. As those who were formerly scarlet from sin but became white as wool through the purification of saving baptism, let us offer not palm branches but the prizes of victory to the conqueror of death.\n\nFor more images see: http://www.stchadscathedral.org.uk/gallery/\n\nA Time for Everything\n\nBy Veronica Nathan (Congregation of Mater Ecclesiae)\n\n“Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers and sisters dwell in unity”. (Psalm 133:1)\n\nThe Church celebrated the World Day of Consecrated Life, on the Feast of the Presentation of the Child Jesus, on 2 February 2018. The Holy Father, Pope Francis, presided Mass at St Peter’s Basilica, in thanksgiving and prayer for the gift of religious vocations.\n\nIndeed, the gathering of consecrated men and women in the Metropolitan Cathedral of St Chad, Birmingham on 3 February 2018 witnessed to the faithfulness of God to His Church. Over 100 people attended the noon Mass (highlight of the day), celebrated by the Most Reverend Bernard Longley, Archbishop of Birmingham and concelebrated by 14 priests.\n\nHis Grace, the Archbishop thanked all present for taking time to come together as he congratulated the 7 jubilarians present. He also highlighted the different charisms and gifts of the faithful and how coming together can further deepen relationships. The gospel needs to be experienced, as he so poignantly said. Sr Anna O’Connor and Father Stephen Wright, Vicars for Religious of the Archdiocese of Birmingham shared about the day’s event and upcoming events. “When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion” [Ethiopian Proverb], quipped Sr Anna.\n\nAfter a morning cuppa, there was an engaging yet challenging presentation by Ms Pat Gaffney from Pax Christi International on ‘The Call to Nonviolence: Renewing our commitment to peacemaking’. The presentation on non-violence was a timely call, a vocation for us all to be peacemakers. Pax Christi is a human, faith-based response to war, inspired by the gospels it was founded in 1945 by Ms Martha Dortel-Claudot who consulted Bishop Pierre Marie Theas. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nToday Pax Christi International is in over 60 countries and their emphasis is on human rights and many religious are often in the frontline of violence. As Pat shared, that there are no winners in war and we need to visualise a prophetic and creative imagination to resolve conflicts. Imagine the majority of the world agrees to a treaty to ban nuclear weapons and spend their millions, not on disarmament, but on trauma healing and other good works.\n\nAs we go about our daily lives, we are reminded of an invitation from Pope Francis, “to revitalise the tools of non-violence and active non-violence in particular”. Here in UK, a challenge of the culture of violence begins with a slogan, “Choose Life. Drop the Knife.”\n\nWe are called to IMAGINE! Imagine…non-violence…just peace…\n\nImagine the words of scriptures come to life, “…The infant will play near the cobra’s den, and the young child will put its hand into the viper’s nest. They will neither harm nor destroy on my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea…” (Isaiah 11:6-10).\n\nLet peace begin with me…in my heart, my home, my country, and extend to the whole world.\n\n‘Tonight we are caught up in a most extraordinary story – the longing for a Messiah that stretches back for thousands of years in the memory of the People of Israel – and the plan for our salvation that stretches back to the beginning of time in the mind of God. It is hard to imagine the truth that lies at the heart of what we celebrate tonight. The simple story of the birth of God’s Son at Bethlehem sets before us the mystery that surrounds us tonight…’\n\nThese are the opening words from His Grace’s homily as we embark once more on this most joyous of celebrations. ‘There were no cataclysmic battles as we see in the latest Star Wars film or in the epic film The Lord of the Rings’, he said. No, ‘God’s love enters into our human affairs quietly and in a hidden way – a way that only gradually unfolds in the story of a young woman expecting a child, a couple forced on an arduous journey by the demands of the law, anxiously looking for somewhere to stay, for Mary to give birth to her first-born child. God enters the world in a stable, as a tiny helpless baby.’\n\nGod longs for union with us, ‘The all-powerful, eternal and all-knowing God, the creator and lord of the entire universe, is not so remote that we cannot know or approach him. The most unsettling aspect of our relationship with our maker is that he longs for us so much that he has come to share our lives.’\n\nHis Grace reminds us that ‘On this great feast of the Incarnation we remember that this child didn’t only come for the believer, the faithful – he has come for everyone and especially for those whose lives are lived under a shadow today. He is here for those who are homeless in our city, for those whose lives are blighted by drugs or by debt, for those who are anxious about their health or their work, their family or their future.’\n\nThis message is not just for ourselves, we must first receive it ourselves but then, as His Grace points out, a challenge is put forth…, ‘The Christ-child beckons us to the crib to be close to him tonight. We should go and pray there in company with Mary and Joseph. But if we do he will want to send us out to show his love to others. He will challenge us to take his message of love to the people who walk in darkness in our own time, to lead them into his own wonderful light.’\n\nPolitics and economics, philosophy, science and technology can all be useful tools to assist the progress of humanity but only Christ ultimately fulfils. Ending his homily His Grace left us with the words, ‘only the light of Christ reveals the true meaning of our lives’.\n\nArchbishop Bernard’s homily in full: CHRISTMAS MIDNIGHT MASS 2017\n\nArchbishop Bernard Longley’s Chrism Mass homily draws inspiration from the words of Blessed John Henry Newman: Let us not ‘squander’ our gifts ‘on ourselves’ and ‘our own reputation’, but let us use them for the ‘good of His Church’\n\nAt the Chrism Mass on Wednesday 12 April which saw the gathering of the archdiocese; bishops, priests, deacons and lay faithful and saw Archbishop Bernard Longley blessing the holy oils, and priests and deacons renewing their promises to serve God and his people, the Archbishop invited those gathered to draw inspiration and courage from the words of Blessed John Henry Newman:\n\n‘Let us pray for each other, as well as for ourselves, that the gifts He has given us may not be squandered on ourselves, and used for our own gratification or our own reputation, but for His glory and for the good of His Church.’\n\nThe Archbishop spoke of the importance of the cross: ‘The cross lies at the centre of everything we believe as priests and it gives meaning to everything we teach.’\n\nHe said that: ‘Christ has always seen our capacity to shoulder his cross for the sake of others, lifting their burdens and lightening their hearts.’ Even though, ‘we may not recognise this fully or clearly within ourselves.’\n\nHe emphasised how it is important for all to come together for the Chrism Mass because ‘It is not good for us as priests to be isolated – it jars against the nature of our calling.’ Adding that the Chrism Mass is a time when, ‘we renew and refresh our relationship with the Lord as his priests in the midst of the Church – and where we also re-commit ourselves to take care of our brothers in the priesthood.’\n\nThe Archbishop prayed that friendships amongst priests ‘may be a source of encouragement and inspiration’ and called for ‘understanding and acceptance (of) our brother priests who may be struggling with their health, with physical or mental frailty, with discouragement or disappointment.’ He also spoke of his own need for prayers ‘in order to be faithful to (his) ministry.’\n\nArchbishop’s Homily\n\nEnds"
