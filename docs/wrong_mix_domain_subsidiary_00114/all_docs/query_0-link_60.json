This document discusses the rise of digital video recorders (DVRs) and their impact on television. It predicts that:\n1) DVRs like TiVo and ReplayTV will disrupt the television industry by enabling viewers to watch content on their own schedule and skip commercials. \n2) The core DVR technology of storing video on a hard drive will be incorporated into other common devices like PCs and set-top boxes, challenging standalone DVR companies.  \n3) As DVR adoption grows, it will significantly reduce viewership of commercials and threaten the traditional television advertising model.",
