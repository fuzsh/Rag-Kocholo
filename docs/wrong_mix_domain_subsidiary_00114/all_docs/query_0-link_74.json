TuneUp was born out of the personal frustration with the shortcomings of his own digital music library; too many songs titled ‘Track 01’, no cover art, and no easy means of accessing additional album, artist or concert information. Everything he loved about his vinyl & CD collection was lost in translation, as the digital music industry scrambled to catch up. TuneUp not only addresses these issues, but also taps the broader digital and social media universe to create an experience far beyond anything Adiv could have found in his liner notes. Additionally, Adiv has several entrepreneurial ventures under his belt, along with a variety of roles in sales, business development and marketing, including 5 years with Gracenote.

Del got his start rapping behind his cousin, Ice Cube, as a member of his back-up band and crew. After parting ways, Del ventured out as a solo artist, making music that immediately gained attention. Del’s music offered a fresh new outlook on an otherwise gangsta rap controlled California Hip-Hop scene. His viewpoint offered a more detached alternative style laced with humorous rhymes and funky beats. After securing a deal with Elektra Records, Del released two critically acclaimed albums, I Wish My Brother George Was Here (1991) and No Need for Alarm (1993). Despite record sales in the hundred of thousands, his third album, Future Development, was never commercially released. Fed up with the commercialized music industry, Del began working with his crew, the Hieroglyphics,, to create a massive independent network of Oakland based Hip-Hop. The crew began to successfully release projects under their own Hieroglyphics Emporium label. Del, joined by a talented coalition of emcees, including Pep Love, the Souls of Mischief, Casual, and Domino, went on to create a critically acclaimed album called 3rd Eye Vision (1998). With the release of the album, “Hiero” went on the road and toured incessantly, supporting the album for much of 1998. Since their inception, the Hieroglyphics crew has developed a cult like following, while giving each one of their artists the creative freedom to expand. For his next solo effort, Del demanded complete control and came out with 17 tracks of pure Del funkiness. He handled the majority of the production on the album but also collaborated with some of Hip-Hop’s finest including Prince Paul and El-P (Def Jux). The album, titled Both Sides of the Brain, again garnered excellent reviews. Rolling Stone magazine commented, “Del’s elastic language is the real star here. Rhyming about everything from The Hobbit to Joe Piscopo, he cements his status as rap’s staunchly independent lord of the underground and perhaps the best rapper you’ve never heard.”\n\nContinuing to grow in popularity, Del would soon solidify himself as one of Hip-Hop’s most versatile artists. Linking up with powerhouse producer Dan “the Automator” Nakamura and world-class turntablist Kid Koala, Del helped to create one of the most innovative Hip-Hop albums in recent history. Deltron 3030 received wonderful reviews (4.5 stars from RollingStone) and continued on to further secure Del’s place in Hip-Hop history. The ideas and concepts born with Deltron 3030 allowed for the creation of Del’s next project, the globally embraced “Gorillaz” collaboration. With Dan “the Automator” Nakamura, Blur’s Damon Albarn, Tom Tom Club’s Tona Weymouth, Buena Vista Social Club start Ibrahim Ferrer, and Kid Koala working together, the album was an immediate hit. Del’s lead vocals on the smash single “Clint Eastwood” helped the Gorillaz sell over 5 million records worldwide.\n\nDel has successfully released quality, critically acclaimed material for over 10 years. There seems to be no stopping him and as history has shown. Del’s lyrics and wordplay are the Midas touch to his wonderful taste in production. Del the Funky Homosapien has grown from the 17 year-old protege of Ice Cube, to a crafted artist, whose hypnotic voice has transcended the norm, taking underground Hip-Hop to an even deeper level.\n\nRick Farman\n\nSuperfly, Co-Founder\n\nRick Farman began promoting concerts at the age of 17 at small clubs in New York City.

Two years later John invented the Glyph, a low-distortion loudspeaker system, which attracted the attention of musicians including Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin and Frank Zappa, and led to a position as in-house loudspeaker designer at San Francisco’s McCune Sound Service. In the early 1970s, John helped establish an acoustics laboratory at the Institute for Advanced Musical Studies in Switzerland, where he conducted research on low-distortion horns and integrated, large-scale loudspeaker systems. In 1979, after returning to California, John and his wife, Helen Meyer, founded Meyer Sound Laboratories, Inc., where, to this day, he oversees research and development of new products at the company’s Berkeley headquarters.\n\nJohn and Meyer Sound have received 40 patents including for the revolutionary Trapezoidal Loudspeaker Cabinet, the MSL-4 Self-Powered Loudspeaker System, and the SB-1 Parabolic Long-Throw Sound Beam to name a few. Additionally, the company has issued many innovations that have defined and evolved sound reproduction in the areas of live sound with self-powered technology; in theatre where the UPA-1P loudspeaker has become ubiquitous on Broadway, the West End and in Cirque du Soleil productions. John has focused on utilizing digital technology to create extraordinary new tools for sound engineers, musicians and architects alike, such as the revolutionary Constellation acoustic system. Most recently, John’s interest in cinema sound has led to the development of the Cinema EXP line of products designed to bring power and clarity to the reproduction of movie soundtracks.\n\nJohn has worked closely with artists ranging from the Grateful Dead to the late Luciano Pavarotti, as well as with pioneering theatrical sound designers Abe Jacob and Jonathan Deans; and with such prestigious world-class venues as Carnegie Hall and Royal Albert Hall.

Hailed by 700,000 YouTube viewers as “The Godfather of Controllerism”, Moldover is a new breed of music icon. Combining the charisma of a rock star, the mad genius of a basement inventor, and the radical inclusiveness of the DIY internet generation, Moldover is “literally throwing away the rule book and reinventing the wheel” (Remix Magazine). Witness his balls-to-the-wall live show at a club, experience his multiplayer music installations at a festival, or pick up and play the light theramin packaging of his debut album and understand why the next paradigm for music is a one-man-brand called Moldover.\n\nSince the release of his long-awaited debut album in 2009, Moldover has become a viral internet phenomenon. This all-original compositional masterpiece lays a bed of electronic brain-dance and funk-infused rock, beneath lingering, soulfully melodies. His award winning album artwork redefines what it means to “play” an album- the packaging IS a musical instrument. Presenting an answer to declining record sales, industry icon Bob Lefsetz suggests “How about that guy Moldover, with the theremin built into his CD case?” Press the button and wave your hand in the air to create and endless array of giggle-inducing bleeps, bloops, and whomps. Sonic State’s Mark Tinley calls it “utterly brilliant” and Engadget senior editor Thomas Ricker simply says “you will believe”.\n\nMoldover’s success as a producer and performer comes only after years of work founding the principles of controllerism. This new cultural movement, now the most quickly growing force in electronic music, is an ingenious and accessible formula for live sound manipulation: Computer + Controller = The New Instrument. Moldover fuels this new craft by designing completely new kinds of music controllers. His multi-player music jamming station “The Octamasher“, tours to music festivals, college campuses and private parties, putting controllerism into the hands of everyone. His commercially available performance controller, “The Mojo” combines elements of traditional instruments, DJ hardware and video game controllers, offering unparalleled ergonomic tactility to other serious controllerists. Next on the horizon is a new multiplayer instrument called “The SyncoMasher” and a Do-It-Yourself version of Moldover’s hacked up performance monster, “The Frankentroller”.\n\nCurrently Moldover is touring the US and Europe in support of his self-titled album. Uniting his talents as a musician, artist, and inventor, he is an emissary of controllerism culture, and an evangelist for self expression and inclusiveness.
