The Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards are presented by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS), while the separate Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards are given by its sister organization the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS).\n\nA Technology and Engineering Emmy can be presented to an individual, a company, or to a scientific or technical organization for developments and/or standardization involved in engineering technologies which either represent so extensive an improvement on existing methods or are so innovative in nature that they materially have affected the transmission, recording, or reception of television. The award is determined by a special panel composed of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry.[1]\n\nThe 75th annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards were as follows.[2]\n\nPioneering Development of Inexpensive Video Technology for Animation\n\nLyon Lamb (Bruce Lyon and John Lamb)\n\nLarge Scale Deployment of Smart TV Operating Systems\n\nSamsung\n\nLG\n\nSony\n\nVizio\n\nPanasonic\n\nCreation and Implementation of HDR Static LUT, Single-Stream Live Production\n\nBBC\n\nNBC\n\nPioneering Technologies Enabling High Performance Communications Over Cable TV Systems\n\nBroadcom\n\nGeneral Instrument (CommScope)\n\nLANcity (CommScope)\n\n3COM (HP)\n\nPioneering Development of Manifest-based Playout for FAST (Free Ad-supported Streaming Television)\n\nAmagi\n\nPluto TV\n\nTurner\n\nTargeted Ad Messages Delivered Across Paused Media\n\nDirecTV\n\nPioneering Development of IP Address Geolocation Technologies to Protect Content Rights\n\nMLB\n\nQuova\n\nDevelopment of Stream Switching Technology between Satellite Broadcast and Internet to Improve Signal Reliability\n\nDirecTV\n\nDesign and Deployment of Efficient Hardware Video Accelerators for Cloud\n\nNetint\n\nAMD\n\nGoogle\n\nMeta\n\nSpectrum Auction Design\n\nFCC\n\nAuctionomics\n\nTV Pioneers – Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT)\n\nKarl Ferdinand Braun\n\nBoris Lvovich Rosing\n\nAlan Archibald Campbell Swinton\n\nTV Pioneers – Development of lighting, ventilation, and lens-coating technologies\n\nHertha Ayrton\n\nKatharine Burr Blodgett\n\nThe 74th annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards were as follows.[3]\n\nInvention and Development of the Pinned Photodiode Now Used in Most Image Sensors\n\nNobukazu Teranishi\n\nNEC\n\nExtraction of Granular Census Level Behavioral Data using ACR\n\nCognitive Networks\n\nEnswers\n\nTurner Media lab\n\nAI-ML curation of Sports Highlights\n\nWSC\n\nIBM\n\nComcast\n\nGoogle\n\nDigital Cinema Camera Mounted Video Extender for Live Audiences\n\nMultiDyne\n\nARRI\n\nPioneering Development and Deployment of Virtualized Cable Modem\n\nHarmonic\n\nComcast\n\nIntel\n\nTV Pioneer Hall of Fame\n\nLlewelyn Birchall Atkinson\n\nJean Lazare Weiller\n\nThomas Alva Edison\n\nJan Szczepanik\n\nConstantin Dmitrievich Perskyi\n\nThe 73rd annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards were as follows.[4]\n\nVideo & Audio Search based on Index Feeds coming from Multiple Sources\n\nShadow TV\n\nIn Camera Sensor and Software Stabilization\n\nGoPro\n\nSocionext\n\nCorrelated Double Sampling for Image Sensors\n\nMarvin H.
