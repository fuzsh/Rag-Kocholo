        "text": "The Cable TV Pioneers have made history again. For 50 years, the organization’s induction ceremony was held in conjunction with the annual NCTA–The Television & Internet Association convention. When that show folded its tent, the Pioneers induction moved to Denver, just before the start of the SCTE-ISBE Cable-Tec Expo in October. But like every other industry celebration this year, the Cable TV Pioneers 54th annual induction didn’t involve dinner in a convention center ballroom. Instead, the 2020 Pioneers were honored virtually, direct from Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nPioneers Dave Fellows and Yvette Kanouff hosted the televised and streamed ceremony from Spring Creek Ranch, a resort set in a 1,000-acre wildlife preserve with the Teton mountain range as the backdrop. With production support from New England Sports Network, the class of 2020’s induction was televised Dec. 4 by\n\nC-SPAN3 and C-SPAN.org.\n\nFellows and Kanouff welcomed 22 honorees, who joined the more than 700 colleagues inducted since 1966. And for those who didn’t catch the live telecast, the induction ceremony will be streamed on cabletvpioneers.com starting Monday, Dec. 7 .\n\nJeff Berenson\n\nAn early advocate of advanced video technology, Jeff Berenson’s expertise has been invaluable to small cable operators seeking to make the most of their DOCSIS networks.\n\nBerenson’s career has seen his involvement in a wide range of national and international projects, including video-on-demand, set-top box improvements and billing and provisioning technologies at Digital Equipment, Spyglass/OpenTV, Bearing Point and Vidiom, as well as consulting on integration of large acquisitions for Comcast and Charter Communications.
