        "text": "Cable360AM — News briefing for Friday, June 29 »\n\nApple head Steve Jobs and new AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson defend the iPhone’s use of AT&T’s slow Edge wireless data network in today’s New York Times and Wall Street Journal. The overly hyped handset, which finally goes on sale today, will use Wi-Fi networks to pick up the slack, although Jobs tells the NYT: \"Edge is good, but you’d like it to be faster.\" Jobs tells the WSJ, \"We started off thinking we should do an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) and in talking that through with AT&T, both of us came to the realization that would just be a big waste of energy. We’d be trying to duplicate a lot of things they were already doing at a much greater scale. And we came to this … simple partnership: Let AT&T be AT&T. They’ve forgotten more about running a network than we’ll ever know. And let Apple be Apple. We think we know how to design a great phone.\" Users will be the judge of that at 6pm.\n\nIf today is (Fr)iDay, Sunday is CableCards Day as the July 1st deadline looms for cable operators to comply with the FCC’s order to provide set-top boxes with removable security modules.
