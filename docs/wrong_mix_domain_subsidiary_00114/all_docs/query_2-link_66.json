        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 25, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Symphony Advanced Media (SymphonyAM), the technology leader in passively captured cross-platform media measurement, is announcing today a new partnership with TiVo Research and Analytics, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of TiVo Inc. [NASDAQ: TIVO]), the pioneer in delivering insights from single-source matching of TV-viewing and advertising exposure with purchase information. Together, SymphonyAM and TiVo Research will be creating the largest single-source, cross-media panel of opt-in participants in the market, designed to enable deep insights into consumers' media consumption and social media engagement across screens, coupled with detailed demo- and psychographics, advancing understanding of the interplay between media and marketing beyond what is currently available.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140325/NE89908LOGO )\n\nTiVo Research will license SymphonyAM's mobile and online app technology which passively captures media usage across television, mobile phone, tablet, and PC, including detailed social networking and search activity. This multi-year deal, effective April 1, 2014, will marry the largest source of cross-media opt-in panel insights with data from TiVo TV set-top boxes to develop the most comprehensive view of media consumption and its impact on purchase behavior.\n\nAs part of the deal, TiVo Research and SymphonyAM will recruit TiVo panel customers to opt into SymphonyAM's and TiVo Research's single-source, cross-platform panel. Data gleaned from the expanded panel will be available to the broad marketplace including agencies, advertisers, media companies and research firms, which all rely on consumer behavioral data across media platforms.\n\n\"Understanding how cross-media exposure is impacting the behavior of our target consumers is more critical than ever for us,\" said Aaron Fetters, director Insights and Analytics Solutions Center at Kellogg Company. \"The Symphony Advanced Media and TiVo Research collaboration offers us a potential path to greater levels of depth, accuracy and insights into cross media behavior.\"\n\n\"Mobile and social are transforming media consumption at an unprecedented pace, and the market is hungry for fresh insights into the ROI of cross media exposure,\" said Charles Buchwalter, president and CEO of SymphonyAM. \"This partnership brings the best from both companies and will allow for a novel perspective on how cross-platform exposure influences consumers' path-to-purchase.\"\n\n\"TiVo Research has committed to assemble the best in breed partners to offer cross-media insights. This new partnership with Symphony Advanced Media will expand our value proposition of set-top box and purchase data to provide our clients with deep insights in cross-media consumption, information that is key to our clients' businesses today,\" said TiVo Research president Bob Meyers.\n\nAbout Symphony Advanced Media\n\nSymphony Advanced Media, the pioneer in single-source cross-media passive measurement, is a leading technology and data provider that measures integrated media consumption and resulting behaviors, enabling advertisers, agencies and publishers to optimize media strategies and maximize advertising performance.
