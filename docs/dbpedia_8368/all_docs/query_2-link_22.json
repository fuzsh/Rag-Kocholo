        "text": "DVD and Blu-ray Releases for April 19th, 2011\n\nApril 18th, 2011\n\nThis year's big Oscar winner, The King's Speech, is hitting the home market this week. It leads the way in terms of quality and is likely to be the best-selling new release. It's certainly the Pick of the Week, with neither the DVD nor the Blu-ray being a substantially better deal than the other. The only other real contender is the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack, but that came out on Friday. More...\n\nDVD Releases for January 6, 2009\n\nJanuary 6th, 2009\n\nThe new year starts off like most on the home market, rather weak. There are few first run releases coming out this week, most of which are terrible. We do have one top-notch release though, Duckman - Season Three and Four, which is clearly the DVD Pick of the Week. More...\n\nContest - Perfect Ten\n\nJanuary 4th, 2008\n\nAs it will become very clear, very fast, the name of this week's contest, Perfect Ten, refers to the prizes and not the target film, which is In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale. A Dungeon Siege Tale is the widest release next week, but I can't imagine it will be the number one film. In fact, I think it will earn a negative box office. I'm not sure how, but it will... In order to win the contest, however, one must simply predict the film's opening weekend box office (no negative numbers allowed). Whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going over, will win a poster from In the Name of the King signed by director Uwe Bolle, plus a copy of The Ten on DVD. Meanwhile, whoever comes the closest to predicting the film's opening 3-day weekend box office (Friday to Sunday), without going under, will win a signed In the Name of the King poster, plus a copy of The Last Legion on DVD. Entries must be received by 10 a.m., Pacific Time on Friday to be eligible, so don't delay! More...\n\nDVD Rentals - No New Release can Top Ultimate\n\nDecember 31st, 2007\n\nThere were 12 new releases to chart this week, including 6 in the top ten alone; however, The Bourne Ultimatum remained in first place with $12.76 million in rentals for the week and $28.20 million in total. More...\n\nDVD Releases for December 18, 2007\n\nDecember 18th, 2007\n\nAnother deceptively weak week for DVDs. Sure, there appear to be plenty to choose from, but it feels like half the top 20 are Blade Runner releases. In fact, one of the two DVD Picks of the Week are for that movie. For those who are big fans of Blade Runner, grab the Four-Disc Collector's Edition - DVD, or 5-Disc Collector's Edition - Blu-Ray or 5-Disc Collector's Edition - HD-DVD if you can. (Given the choice between those last two, pick 5-Disc Collector's Edition - Blu-Ray.) For those who are huge fans of Blade Runner, and I mean stupid level fans of the movie, grab 5-Disc Ultimate Edition - DVD, 5-Disc Ultimate Edition - Blu-Ray, or 5-Disc Ultimate Edition - HD-DVD. But good luck, I pre-ordered mine months ago and there are reports they are sold out in many places. The second DVD Pick of the Week goes to The Simpsons Movie - Blu-Ray. The light extras are disappointing, but that transfer is immaculate. More...\n\nInternational Details - Rush Hour Just Misses Going Five by Five\n\nSeptember 23rd, 2007\n\nRush Hour 3 missed spending its fifth week in fifth place by less than $4000 at $5.69 million on 2443 screens in 31 markets for a total of $69.71 million. This weekend the film opened in first place in Russia with $2.28 million on 385 screens while it had to settle for second place in Denmark with $485,000 on 41 screens over the weekend and $517,000 in total. More...\n\nInternational Details - Harry Potter has 900 Million Reasons to Celebrate\n\nSeptember 9th, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix may have fallen out of the top five, but it was able to cross $900 million worldwide since last week making it only the tenth film to do so. Over the weekend the film added $7.08 million on 4486 screens in 53 markets for a total of $626.30 million internationally, which places the film sixth place on that chart just $16 million behind Dead Man's Chest. There's not much to report for individual markets with the film down 43% during its second weekend in Greece adding $612,000 on 129 screens for a total of $2.91 million. Its best market remains Japan at $1.67 million on 605 screens over the weekend for a total of $75.18 million after seven weeks. Meanwhile, the film continues to march towards $100 million in the U.K. and after earning $796,000 on 306 screens over the weekend it now sits at $97.89 million in total. More...\n\nInternational Details - Knocked Up Leaps Up\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2007\n\nKnocked Up went from barely making the top 30 to nearly hitting the top five after adding $6.89 million on 1628 screens in 19 markets. The film now has a total of $25.54 million internationally while its worldwide total hit $173.34 million. To put this into perspective, The 40-Year Old Virgin earned $177.34 million and Knocked Up has yet to open in France, Spain, Italy, and many other significant markets. This week it did open in two major markets, the U.K. and Germany. In the former it had to settle for second place with $3.08 million on 423 screens while in the later it topped the charts with $2.11 million on 597 screens. In both markets this represents a small drop-off from The 40-Year Old Virgin, but the movie has already covered its total cost, so there's little reason to complain. More...\n\nHoldovers were Super while New Releases were Bad\n\nAugust 27th, 2007\n\nHoldovers went one-two-three on the box office chart this week, which is not a completely uncommon event. However, with six wide or wide-ish releases, you would think at least one could finish in the top three. The collapse of the new releases helped keep the overall box office down to $108 million, which was 17% lower than last weekend. However, that is still 4% higher than the same weekend last year and keeps summer 2007 on a record-setting pace. In fact, it has hit $4 billion for the first time ever, so there's plenty of reasons to celebrate. More...\n\nSuperbad Extends Summer\n\nAugust 20th, 2007\n\nSummer abruptly ends during August, sometimes before the month even really begins. Even in the best years, you only get Summer-like openings during the first two weeks. However, this year we got a third Summer weekend, as Superbad opened with more than Evan Almighty's debut figure in late June. Granted, the overall box office dropped to $130 million, which was 15% decline from last weekend. However, that's still a softer decline than expected, an 18% improvement from last year, and enough to say it is still summertime. Enjoy it while it lasts. More...\n\nWeekend Estimates - Superbad has Supergood Opening\n\nAugust 19th, 2007\n\nThe Summer season might be winding down, but Superbad proved this weekend that there's still good money to be made by the right movie. It opened with an estimated $31.2 million, putting it on par with the opening of Evan Almighty back in June, while playing in 700 fewer theaters. With decent word of mouth, it should comfortably top $100 million at the box office. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for August 12 - August 18, 2007\n\nAugust 18th, 2007\n\nBusy week with more than 30 sites featured on the list. However, none really stand our as award-worthy; in fact, most only stand because of a lack of style. Hopefully as the fall season progresses and we near the holidays, we will get bigger and better sites launching. More...\n\nThe End of a Super Summer\n\nAugust 16th, 2007\n\nThis weekend we will have the weakest number one film since at least June 22nd when Evan Almighty opened, and mostly likely since before the summer started. But there are still some interesting stories to follow and possibly the last $100 million film to open until November. More...\n\n2007 Preview: August\n\nAugust 1st, 2007\n\nAugust marks the unofficial end of the lucrative summer box office season. The only question is when will it end. Studios usually hope for two summer-like weekends, and sometimes they can squeeze in three. Other times they can only get one, or none. Sadly, this year the August offerings are not particularly strong with only two that have a real shot at $100 million or more, and three or four others that should earn good reviews (and one of those has since been pulled from the schedule). Most of the rest are films that probably seemed like a good idea at the time but didn't work out and those that were a mistake from day one. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - July 29, 2007\n\nJuly 29th, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Hellboy 2, The Mummy 3, The Pink Panther 2 and more. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for July 15 - July 21, 2007\n\nJuly 21st, 2007\n\nBig list in terms of numbers, not so much in terms of quality. In fact, the best film in terms of updates this week was The Simpsons Movie - Official Site, which has already won the Weekly Website Award. Because of that, there are no new winners this week. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - July 22, 2007\n\nJuly 21st, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Big Stan, Valkyrie, Monsters vs. Aliens and more. More...\n\nInternational Details - Reaping the Rewards\n\nApril 29th, 2007\n\nThe Reaping climbed into sixth place this past weekend with $5.98 million on 2634 screens in 39 markets for a total of just $20.38 million. The film had a couple respectable openings including South Korea where it made $1.17 million on 129 screens over the weekend and $1.34 million in total while it took in $335,000 in Brazil. However, in most markets the film stumbled, like in France where is placed seventh with $684,000 or the the U.K. where it placed eighth with $622,000 on 282 screens. The film debuted in ninth place in Australia, ($405,000 on 133 screens); in Russia, ($261,000 on 111); and in Germany, ($247,000 on 201). Mexico became the film's best market as it has pulled in $4.45 million in three weeks, including $589,000 on 350 screens this past weekend; this is just ahead of the $4.25 million the film has earned in Spain, but it only managed $334,000 on 299 screens this past weekend and will quickly disappear there. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - March 11, 2007\n\nMarch 11th, 2007\n\nThis week's round of new movie release information contains release dates for Shooter. Pathfinder, Speed Racer and more.
