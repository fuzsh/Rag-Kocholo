        "text": "SYNOPSIS\n\nRome, 476AD. The Roman Empire is under threat. A mighty force for almost 500 years, at its height Rome’s power spread from Mesopotamia in the east to the Iberian peninsula in the west, from the Rhine and Danube in the north to Egypt in the south. This story follows the events surrounding the historical capture of Romulus Augustus and his imprisonment on the island of Capri.\n\nOn the eve of the ceremony to crown twelve-year-old Romulus Augustus (THOMAS SANGSTER) as the new emperor, the Barbarian general Odoacer (PETER MULLAN) arrives in Rome to make a deal with Orestes (IAIN GLEN),patrician and father of the young Caesar. Odoacer makes demands on the power of the Roman Empire , in fair exchange for his decade-long support of the Roman legions in the east. Orestes refuses.\n\nOn the day of the coronation, as the whole of Rome gathers to watch the proceedings, Ambrosinus (SIR BEN KINGSLEY), the shaman who is a mentor and tutor to Romulus , predicts danger. Orestes is worried for his son’s safety and appoints Aurelius (COLIN FIRTH), the tribune of the fourth legion, as his personal guard. That night Aurelius and his legionnaires are confronted by a real danger – Odoacer and his army of Goths have returned to the outskirts of Rome to conquer the city.\n\nWith a deafening roar, the Barbarian army storm the city. A terrible battle ensues, the brutal invaders show no mercy and blood flows through the streets.\n\nWith Orestes and his wife Julia slaughtered, Romulus is captured along with Ambrosinus and both are taken to the island fortress of Capri built by the emperor Tiberius. It is there that Romulus finds the mythical sword of Caesar that holds the prophecy ‘One edge to defend, one to defeat; In Britannia was I forged…to fit the hand of he…who is destined to rule’.\n\nBut not all the Roman legionnaires are dead. Aurelius is alive and when he learns that the Byzantine Empire will give Romulus sanctuary, he embarks on the journey to the coast accompanied by a small group of his men and a mysterious, black-clad Byzantine warrior. On the journey, Aurelius discovers what lies behind the black clothing – a young, beautiful woman called Mira (AISHWARYA RAI).\n\nThanks to the strategic cunning of Ambrosinus and the fighting skill of Aurelius and Mira, Romulus is freed. But when the group arrive on shore, they learn that the Byzantines have joined forces with the Goths. Faced with such betrayal, the only course of action is to reach the one legion still loyal to Rome – the ninth legion in Britannia.\n\nAs they set off on their dangerous trek North in search of the last legion, Romulus discovers a new father figure in his protector Aurelius and together they embark on a new beginning.
