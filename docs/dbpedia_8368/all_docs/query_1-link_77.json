        "text": "LOST LEGION, a band from Chicago‚Äôs underground music scene, blends dark, aggressive hardcore punk with elements of Oi, noise, and gloomy guitars, making a distinct mark in the local landscape. Their upcoming album, ‚ÄúBehind the Concrete Veil‚Äù, set for release in March on the Basque label Mendeku Diskak, promises to plunge listeners into the depths of mental health struggles and psychedelic revelations.\n\n‚ÄúI wrote the lyrics to 8 of the 10 songs on this record,‚Äù reveals the band‚Äôs lyricist, offering a window into a soul navigating the tumultuous seas of mental health and the enigmatic lessons of psychedelic journeys. The opening track, ‚ÄúWar Machine,‚Äù serves as a philosophical inquiry into consciousness, likened to a dog misunderstanding its reflection for another entity. It‚Äôs a metaphor for life‚Äôs quest: to recognize the mirror rather than the adversary it seems to present.\n\n-066- LOST LEGION ‚ÄúBehind The Concrete Veil‚Äù 12‚Ä≥ (Digital Advance) by Mendeku Diskak\n\n‚ÄúBehind the Concrete Veil‚Äù delves into the labyrinth of seeking mental health aid, only to emerge more entangled. The album‚Äôs narrative arc stretches from existential musings to critiques of societal constructs, with the artwork‚Äîa depiction of evolution and celestial aspiration‚Äîmirroring these themes. Songs like ‚ÄúThe Animals We Used to Be‚Äù explore the evolution beyond one‚Äôs subcultural roots, while ‚ÄúFangs‚Äù and ‚ÄúSilhouettes In Blue Light‚Äù confront street and police violence, respectively.\n\nDrummer Dave contributes his lyrical prowess to two tracks, ‚ÄúDisposed‚Äù and ‚ÄúStaring Down the Valley,‚Äù reflecting on the plight of low-wage essential workers during the COVID era and the ominous shadow of artificial intelligence.\n\nLOST LEGION draws inspiration from a spectrum of ancestors. ‚ÄúThe Effigies, an early Chicago punk band, are a huge influence on us,‚Äù they share, acknowledging the dark, aggressive, yet catchy essence of The Effigies‚Äô sound that permeates their own. The New York band the Templars and The Trouble from Boston also significantly shape their sonic identity, alongside the gloomy melodies of Masshysteri, the riff-driven His Hero Is Gone, and the inadvertently emulated Replacements.\n\nTheir local and broader music scene connections paint a picture of a band deeply embedded in the fabric of modern hardcore, Oi, and punk.\n\nFrom playing alongside bands like Claimed Choice and Poison Ruin to preparing for a tour with Soft Kill and GUMM, LOST LEGION is both a participant in and contributor to the vibrant tapestry of their musical community.\n\nThe band‚Äôs commentary on their musical influences and peers, coupled with their own lyrical and sonic explorations, sets the stage for ‚ÄúBehind the Concrete Veil‚Äù to be more than just an album. It is a manifesto, a shared experience of introspection, critique, and communal expression, resonating with the dark, reflective, and often tumultuous journey of our condition ad humans.\n\nAs LOST LEGION stands ready to unveil *Behind the Concrete Veil*, their narrative is one of confrontation and exploration, an invitation to look beyond the facade of existence and delve into the depths of personal and collective identity.\n\nChicago punk:\n\n‚ÄúChicago, Milwaukee, and Northwest Indiana (‚ÄúNWI‚Äù) are all close scenes and mix together. Fuerza Bruta is still active (though I‚Äôm not a member anymore), and there are other great bands going. These are some modern bands (active since 2020) that we are friends with and/or fans of.‚Äù ‚Äì comments the band.\n\nConsensus Madness\n\nConsensus Madness (LUNGS-249) by CONSENSUS MADNESS\n\nEarly LA punk as it was verging on HC (The Middle Class, Randoms, etc). Sharp and insightful lyrics over tight songs.\n\nExedo\n\nDemo 2020 by Exedo\n\nChristine, the singer, did vocals on our cover of the Go-Go‚Äôs song ‚ÄúTonite‚Äù, which we released on an EP called ‚ÄòBridging Eelectricity‚Äô. Obviously we are fans. Reminds me of when the Damned went dark, but with some dusty early LA vibes.\n\nMan-Eaters\n\nTwelve More Observations on Healthy Living by Man-eaters\n\nLike if R Crumb had been in a punk band. Do you remember the proto punk outfits The Shit Dogs or Rubber City Rebels? Man-Eaters do. (the guitarist of this band did the cover art for our LP)\n\nUseless Info\n\nREHEARSAL TAPE by USELESS INFO\n\nA frantic and loose take on USHC. I‚Äôve seen this band a couple times and they make me feel young again.\n\nInnuendo\n\nDemo by INNUENDO\n\nThe guitars are somehow catchy while also essentially being a rhythmic element. They do so much with so little, the mark of a good hardcore band.\n\nSplatter Pattern\n\nScum of the City ‚Äì 2020 demo by Splatter Pattern\n\nPitch perfect UK82 from a group of guys who could single-handedly out drink the entire United Kingdom.\n\nWorld in Action\n\nWorld In Action by World In Action\n\nMilwaukee peace punk. Music about how awful the world is that you can also dance to\n\nNecron-9\n\nNECRON 9 ‚Äì PEACE BY A ROPE DEMO by NECRON 9\n\nThese guys put out the coolest, most in-your-face cassette last year and then broke up. One of those bands that make you excited to still be into HC\n\nCoronary\n\nThe Future is Now by Coronary\n\nHeavy and fast. It‚Äôs hardcore from a punk mindset, but they‚Äôre all into good metal. Not a record in a hype genre, so they don‚Äôt get much attention, but they‚Äôre a killer band doing their own thing.\n\nJinksie\n\nJinksie by Jinksie\n\nJangley garage punk/power pop. Quick, snappy songs that get caught in your head.\n\nOur music scene outside our local scene:\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a part of the oi scene, a small but growing offshoot of punk. The Basque label Mendeku Diskak is the main label releasing stuff in our world, and are releasing this LP. They previously released a 7‚Äù reissue of our demo ‚ÄúAutoproduktion‚Äù and have released records for some of the best modern bands including The Chisel (UK), MESS (Mexico), Cuero (Spain), and Fuerza Bruta. There are other labels putting out great stuff (Longshot, Try and Stop Me, Rock n Roll Disgrace, Mr Face, Crossbar, Lionheart, Battle Scarred‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a small scene, but a lot of people in it want to support bands they love).‚Äù ‚Äì says the band.\n\n‚ÄúI used to run a label called Foreign Legion Records that attempted to bring together the more aggressive and fringe elements of punk/hardcore/oi and never quite got it working. It‚Äôs very cool to see other labels actually do it successfully.‚Äù\n\nHere are some bands from the band‚Äôs current scene to check out.\n\nCivilian\n\nDemo by Civilian\n\nBaltimore oi with heavy chorused-guitars and hardcore breakdowns. I met these guys when their other band, B.R.A.T., played with our other band, War Effort, and they were telling me about this project. The cassette just dropped and it‚Äôs three quick bursts of thoughtful and gloomy modern oi.\n\nThe Slads\n\nTough Times by The Slads\n\nMembers of Legion 76/New York Hounds turning in dirty, modern oi. As catchy as it is mean.\n\nSlugger CA\n\nSlugger by Slugger CA\n\nThese guys have put out two EPs of dirty and rough oi. Party music for outcasts. I love the samples and production.\n\nCollaps\n\nExecutor by Collaps\n\nFast, burly German oi-core. Their sound is big and their songs are direct, and I love their simple approach towards visual presentation.\n\nBad Terms\n\nBADTERMS by BADTERMS\n\nSharp, stripped-down rock n oi. The songs are a fun and energetic with take on pub rock and first wave oi. Did they steal from Golden Earring? I think they did, and I like it.\n\nCuero\n\n-045- CUERO / PURO ODIO ‚ÄúMorir En Vizcaya‚Äù Split 12‚Ä≥ by Mendeku Diskak\n\nOne of my favorite modern bands. Absolutely evil sounding. Their first EP blew me away and every other release keeps getting better\n\nBeton Arme\n\nSecond Souffle by B√©ton Arm√©\n\nThey‚Äôve been active for several years and have progressed into a creative force. Their most recent EP treads new ground while still using classics as the point of reference. Essential.\n\nConcrete Elite\n\nIron Rose by CONCRETE ELITE\n\nRoad dogs that have brought their brand of hardcore/oi to every corner of the US. One of the best live bands of modern times\n\nCastillo\n\nCastillo ‚Äì Pleasure & pain by Castillo\n\nLo-fi and authentic with melodic songs. They remind me of early Templars in fidelity, but the music has more influence from 90s west coast oi bands with a melodic bent. Killer art and throaty vocals.\n\nNo Guard\n\nDemonstration by No Guard\n\nSuper young kids playing American oi. I‚Äôve got a soft spot in my heart for kids that come into the scene hard and start bands. The songs are economic and well structured with clean vocals."
