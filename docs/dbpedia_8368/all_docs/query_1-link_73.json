        "text": "7\" Vinyl / Record\n\nSingel\n\nLabel: Mendeku Diskak\n\nGenre: Punk\n\nOne of the things we love most here at Mendeku HQ is discovering new exciting bands and sharing them with the rest of the world, that’s why we’ve been releasing many demos, debut recordings or vinyl version of demos. The freshness, the urgency, the rawness of the bands on their early recordings always attracted us and here we have another fine example. Around 6 years ago i stumbled upon a Youtube video with the demo recordings of LOST LEGION, at a first glance they might have fooled one or two with the fake 1974 year reference, including myself, but only few minutes of research until i realized that it wasn’t any 40+ obscure recording of a forgotten band but a current project with some familiar faces in it. Well, time passes by, bla bla bla, and here we are in spring 2023 and we have now in production the vinyl version of those amazing 4 tracks, originally released on tape, of crude Bovver Rock’n’Roll/Proto OI! (if you will) with Punk practice room vibes, full of infectious tunes with crispy bass sound and sharp guitars."
