        "text": "Say what you like about “The Last Legion” — and believe me, we’re about to — it does move along at a “rattling” clip.\n\nMuch of the rattle here has to do with the sound of swords striking swords or banging and clanging against metal shields and armor as the last vestiges of the Roman Empire struggle for survival circa 460 A.D.\n\nThere are plenty of sword fights and battles in “The Last Legion,” which might be the sort of stuff that can still appeal to schoolboys. Schoolboys, that is, who don’t care about getting history even remotely right and who readily go along with a tale that merrily distorts long-treasured myths. Schoolboys, as well, who don’t know much in the way of film history — as in the fact Sir Ben Kingsley once won an Academy Award for acting. Suffice it to say, he won’t get one for his efforts in “The Last Legion.”\n\nNo matter …\n\nActually, it does matter, since its cast (Kingsley, Colin Firth, Kevin McKidd) looks pretty good on paper. Also with regard to paper, the film is apparently based on a book by Valerio Massimo Manfredi that was supposedly well-received. One suspects that at the planning stages of “The Last Legion” anticipation may have been high among the producers and fans of the book alike.\n\nIf so, the film is a clanking disappointment. Yes, it is shaped like an adventure. Alas, the intelligence with which the scenes are put together is on a first-grade level. There is heavy handedness both in the way the characters are drawn (cartoon caricatures, really) and in the way all the fighting and battles have a tendency to look dreadfully clumsy.\n\nAs the film opens, young Romulus Augustus (played by Thomas Sangster, who is definitely of schoolboy age) is about to be crowned the new Roman Emperor. But all is not well in Rome. Blame it on those uppity Goths, who in this movie for some reason all seem to sound like Scots. Odacer (Peter Mullan), the leader of the Scots — I mean Goths — sounds something akin to a disgruntled Glasgow Rangers fan after Glasgow Celtic have thrashed them in soccer yet again at Ibrox Park.\n\nIn other words he’s mean and nasty, and in short order Odacer is leading a pillage of Rome.\n\nAll seems lost. But after a few plot twists too ridiculous to get into here, Romulus takes flight, aided and guarded by a small group of loyalists that include the dashing soldier Aurelius (Colin Firth), his teacher/philosopher Ambrosinius (Kingsley), and a mysterious woman/warrior named Mira (Aishwarya Rai).\n\nFirth is miscast for this gig. He’s supposed to be a James Bond in armor, but comes across as if he’s wearily pulled himself away from the all-you-can-eat buffet at his favorite pub in London. Who is Mira? Rai surely does look like a Bond girl in armor. She doesn’t say much, but doesn’t have to. She does, however, make her interest in Aurelius clear, but typically he does not seem to be all that interested.\n\nAnother interesting piece of casting is taking Kevin McKidd from the HBO series “Rome” and making him an anti-Roman Goth in “The Last Legion.” As Wulfila, McKidd is angry indeed. Maybe he found out at the beginning of shooting for “The Last Legion” that HBO had canceled “Rome.”\n\nKingsley’s man of profundity gets to tell the new emperor such nuggets of wisdom as “every creature has a destiny” and “have faith, there is a purpose.” (Thanks — we’re all a lot wiser now.) One of the puzzling aspects of Kingsley’s embarrassingly bad performance is that he changes accents quite a lot while uttering such dross. He can sound Scottish, Welsh, even Indian. (Memory lane, perhaps?) Maybe Kingsley is celebrating his knighthood by going on a vocal tour of the British Empire.\n\nIt is, in fact, to Britain that Romulus and his crew, pursued by Wulfila, go, and the film throws in Hadrian’s Wall, Excalibur, a new villain and wizardry into the mix.\n\nAurelius advises that they head to Britannia because he believes a last loyal contingent of Roman legionnaires might still be flying the flag there. But what if instead of meeting an old pal like Tony Blair he comes across a Gordon Brown?\n\nMeanwhile, the new villain wears a gold mask and covets a sword that Romulus had discovered and taken to Britain with him. A sword with special powers? Could this be the beginnings of Arthurian legend? As someone on this side of the Atlantic once memorably said, “Say it ain’t so.”\n\nAll in all, this is a lot of stuff to stuff into a movie, and a major problem with “The Last Legion” is that it can leave the best of movie-going-soldiers feeling lost. Often, when you try to do too much, you end up doing nothing particularly well, and such is the case in this instance.\n\nThere is so much potentially going on that you could almost see “The Last Legion” working better as a cable television mini-series or series. But sorry, McKidd. Not HBO. It’s not good enough for that. But perhaps the USA Network, or The Overgrown Schoolboy Channel, were there ever to be one.\n\nA Weinstein Company presentation\n\nRating: PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 41 minutes\n\n‘The Last Legion’"
