He was known for his roles as boxer Apollo Creed in the first four Rocky films (1976–1985), Colonel Al Dillon in Predator (1987), and Combat Carl in the Toy Story franchise. He also portrayed Det. Beaudreaux in the television series Street Justice (1991–1993) and a fictionalized version of himself in the comedy series Arrested Development (2004, 2013). He had a recurring role as Greef Karga in the Star Wars series The Mandalorian (2019–2023).\n\nWeathers began working as an extra while still playing football. He had his first significant roles in two blaxploitation films directed by his longtime friend Arthur Marks: Bucktown (1975) and Friday Foster (1975). Weathers also appeared in an early 1975 episode of the sitcom Good Times titled “The Nude”, portraying an angry husband who suspected his wife of cheating on him with J.J. He also guest-starred in a 1975 episode of Kung Fu titled “The Brothers Caine”, and in an episode of Cannon titled “The Hero”. In 1976, he appeared as a loan shark in an episode of the crime-drama Starsky and Hutch, and in the Barnaby Jones episode “The Bounty Hunter” as escaped convict Jack Hopper.\n\nWhile auditioning for the role of Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in Rocky, Weathers criticized Stallone’s acting, which led to him getting the role. He reprised the role of Apollo Creed in the next three Rocky films: Rocky II (1979), Rocky III (1982), and Rocky IV (1985).\n\nWeathers is briefly seen as an Army MP in one of the three released versions of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (originally released in 1977). In 1978, Weathers portrayed Vince Sullivan in a TV movie, Not This Time. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Weathers starred in a number of action films for the small and big screen, including Force 10 from Navarone (1978), Predator (1987), Action Jackson (1988), and Hurricane Smith (1992).\n\nWeathers died at his home in Los Angeles on February 1, 2024, at the age of 76. His family issued a statement saying he died “peacefully in his sleep.” — Wikipedia\n\n— You will be missed! \n\n#carlweathers\".",
