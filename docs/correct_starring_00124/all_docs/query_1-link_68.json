        "text": "Carl Weathers, best known for his work in the Rocky franchise, has died. He was 76.\n\nThe actor’s death was confirmed by his manager Matt Luber to Variety. A cause of death was not disclosed.\n\nBefore transitioning to acting, Weathers played college football for San Diego State. He went on to spend just over one season in the NFL as a member of the Oakland Raiders. Weathers then went to the Canadian Football League where he played for the BC Lions from 191-1973. He retired from football in 1974.\n\nWeathers’ early acting career consisted mainly of one-off appearances on television shows, including Good Times and The Six Million Dollar Man. However, he landed the role of Apollo Creed in 1976’s Rocky, which is arguably his most popular acting role. Weathers played Apollo Creed in 1979’s Rocky II, 1982’s Rocky III and 1985’s Rocky IV. The latter film is where his character met his tragic end at the hands of Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren).\n\nRELATED: Sylvester Stallone Pays Tribute to Late 'Rocky' Actor Burt Young\n\nAnother one of Weathers’ big roles came in the ’80s alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987’s Predator. Not only was the film a hit, it went on to birth one of the internet’s most iconic memes.\n\nIn the ’90s, Weathers had two significant television roles. For 44 episodes, he played Adam Beaudreaux in Street Justice from 1991-1993. Weathers then played Hampton Forbes for 28 episodes in In the Heat of the Night from 1993-1995.\n\nWeathers had a knack for comedy as well. He notably played Chubbs alongside Adam Sandler in 1996’s Happy Gilmore. (Weathers made an uncredited cameo as Chubbs in the 2000 Sandler movie Little Nicky.)\n\nHe notably played himself in the comedy series Arrested Development. Weathers’ character of himself was the acting coach for Tobias Fünke (David Cross). Who could forget, “Baby, you got a stew goin’!”\n\nIn recent years, Weathers played Mark Jefferies on Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D. and Chicago Justice. He also played Greef Karga in The Mandalorian.\n\nWeathers is survived by ex-wife, Mary Ann, and their two sons.\n\nCelebrity Deaths 2023: Musicians, Entertainers & Cultural Figures We Lost\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
