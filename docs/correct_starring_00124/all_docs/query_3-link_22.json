        "text": "Adam Sandler and more are paying tribute to veteran actor Carl Weathers following his death on Feb. 1 at the age of 76. Among many notable roles in “Happy Gilmore,” “The Mandalorian,” “Predator” and more, Weathers is known for playing boxer Apollo Creed in the “Rocky” franchise.\n\n“A true great man. Great dad. Great actor. Great athlete. So much fun to be around always,” Sandler wrote of his “Happy Gilmore” co-star on social media. “Smart as hell. Loyal as hell. Funny as hell. Loved his sons more than anything. What a guy!! Everyone loved him. My wife and I had the best times with him every time we saw him. Love to his entire family and Carl will always be known as a true legend.”\n\nWeathers starred as Chubbs Peterson opposite Adam Sandler in the 1996 sports comedy film.\n\nPedro Pascal, who acted alongside Weathers in “The Mandalorian,” shared a photo of the actor on social media with the caption, “words fail.”\n\n“The Mandalorian” creator Jon Favreau said in a statement, “I am heartbroken by this devastating loss. He was a hero from my childhood who I was lucky enough to meet and then had the amazing good fortune to work with. He had the energy and curiosity of a young man paired with the wisdom that his rich life and career afforded him. My heart goes out to his family and countless admirers.”\n\nDirector Robert Rodriguez, who worked with Weathers on “The Mandalorian,” wrote, “Will miss the great Carl Weathers who I was very fortunate to work with on several occasions. A very kind and generous person. His performances were always electrifying and he was also a terrific director of both stage and screen.”\n\nWeathers’ “Predator” co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote, “Carl Weathers will always be a legend. An extraordinary athlete, a fantastic actor, and a great person. We couldn’t have made Predator without him. And we certainly wouldn’t have had such a wonderful time making it. Every minute with him — on set and off — was pure joy. He was the type of friend who pushes you to be your best just to keep up with him. I’ll miss him, and my thoughts are with his family.”\n\nIn the 1989 action/sci-film, Weathers plays a Vietnam veteran and CIA agent working alongside Arnold Schwarzeneggers’ Dutch in the investigation of mysterious murders. Ventura plays Sgt. Blaine Cooper.\n\nWeathers starred as champion boxer Apollo Creed opposite Sylvester Stallone in the first four “Rocky” films, initially serving as the antagonist in the franchise. The competing athletes respect each other and begin training together in the third film.\n\nRead the tributes to Weathers and more below."
