        "text": "PhD Dissertation from The Norwegian School of Sport Sciences , 2015\n\nBy Nina Rones\n\nAs a result of dramatic changes in the arrangement and missions of the Norwegian Armed Forces, and consequently in competence, gender and identity politics, traditional thinking on what are considered to be valuable persons, skills, abilities and bodily characteristics is being challenged. Yet, what is challenged by some may be guarded by others. As such, a social struggle over what kind of skills and characteristics should be required from military personnel, and who should be allowed in the military profession has been observed. This dissertation investigates what is at stake in the struggles over who can take part in the military profession/field. This investigation is both important and necessary in order to understand how both men and women experience and perceive their own and others’ value in the organization, and to which interests the activities and struggles of different agents contribute. Theoretically, the study is based on Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual framework supplemented with Norbert Elias’ figurational perspective, as well as feminists’ development of Bourdieu’s theories. As a methodological consequence of this perspective, the military profession/field is approached from two analytical levels (macro- and micro-level), which are interpreted in an interactive perspective. Data was gathered through a multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork consisting of participant observation, interviews and collections of written material. Written material, such as management documents, previous debate and research literature, is used to provide insight into the macro-level. This includes the extensive changes in extra-local power relations and management ambitions which have followed the end of the Cold War, and which engage individuals at local military sites to act and struggle as they do. Social interactions at local military sites (micro-level) were investigated through 72 days of participant observation spread over 12 months including 65 interviews. The participant observation took place at different sites where selection, education and training of squad leaders to the Army and the Home Guard were the main concern. Twenty-five interviews were recorded from 22 officers, and 40 interviews recorded from 34 officer candidates at the Army’s Officer Candidate School. 32 interviews were with women, 33 with men. Two research questions were developed to fix the direction and limit the content of the micro-level investigation: 1. What is required from men and women respectively to do an officer role appropriately? 2. How do men and women with different forms of capital respond to different formal and informal requirements in the military field? The result shows that officer candidates are encouraged to become normative role models with “the right attitudes” for their subordinates to imitate. Doing the job as a normative role model (officer) appropriately is dependent on the ability to embody power resources and obey regulation impositions at the same time. Accordingly, the study supports Belkin’s (2012) claim that military masculinity is structured by contradiction, and that the military compels soldiers/officers to embody masculinity and femininity at the same time. This claim is based on an understanding, developed from Bourdieu (1998) and Skeggs (2004), where masculinity is seen as a belief system that comes with impositions of accumulating power resources and striving for dominance, victory, honor and recognition, through which one is classified as masculine. Femininity is understood as a form of regulation that is based on morals and shame, and used to establish control over women and troops through an emphasis on appropriate culture, attitudes and style. The contradictory requirements that apply to the officers are reflected in the culture being referred to as 1) a performance culture in which the “power of example” is used as a pedagogical method to encourage winning instinct and accumulation of power resources, such as physical fitness, and 2) a feedback culture in which buddy evaluations and buddy rankings are actively used as a pedagogical method to socialize the officer candidates into the norms accepted in the social fellowship. The requirement to embody power resources and become a winner and a leader results in internal competition and struggles for positions within the local hierarchy. Considering the requirement to obey regulation impositions, the field was characterized by a voluntary submission and adaption to the requirements, as well as a struggle to maintain (reproduce) the field’s traditional criteria for valuation, in particular physical prowess. It is concluded that systems of classification constitute a stake in the struggles that oppose individuals in the social interactions that take place in the field. It is argued that being classified as soldier/officer vs. murderer, civilized vs. uncivilized, appropriate vs. inappropriate, constitutes a stake in the struggle over soldiers’ culture, attitudes and style. Moreover, it is shown that women, in particular small-sized women who might join the military to disprove the stereotype of being “cute and petite”, jeopardize the belief system on which the military’s capacity for legitimating personal claims to authority and a powerful and masculine identity is based. Women, in particular the “cute and petite”, enter the military field with bodies that stand in direct contrast to skills and qualities associated with military requirements, and as a consequence they put the classification of the military profession as masculine, tough and physically demanding at stake. Accordingly, women also challenge the belief system on which the production of fighting spirit is based. ...Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nThe Palgrave International Handbook of Gender and the Military, 2017\n\nDownload\n\nExplores the power dynamics of genders within the military, which is biased in favor of men.

Given the various approaches to the gender perspective, a clarification of the meanings of the terms is needed, especially since they have lately been defined in terms of military acceptance as well. This content is part of the Military Gender Studies (MGS) Project, whose aim is to develop a model of gender perspective in the military, which will be taught in the European Military Institutions through an Army Handbook.\n\nDownload\n\n\"This paper aims to explore the condition of women in military institutions. In spite of the numerous reforms this has not improved, women continuing to have only a formal role in the army that is limited to office tasks. One can identify some theories regarding women’s role in the army: the feminist anti-militarist theories which reject the women’s entrance into the army, the militarism masculinised theories which also reject this option for women and also, the gender equality theories which supports the entrance of women in military. This paper focuses on the last type of theory, which argues that in contemporary society gender equality is an objective which should be attained. Under these circumstances, there is no basis on which women should be denied entrance to the military. International organizations like NATO and the EU, have adopted some directives which encourage national states to include and offer equal opportunities for their female personnel.\"\n\nDownload\n\nThis article is a response to Anthony King’s ‘‘Women Warriors: Female Accession to Ground Combat.’’ King rightly asserts that the accession of women to combat roles is a notable historical departure in warfighting. He critiques Brownson’s conceptual ideal of ‘‘equivalency’’ as a potentially profound force of transformation of gender relations in the military. While conceptually progressive, he errs in framing the potential transformation within the concept of ‘‘patriarchy.’’ Further, King is unable to recast binary gendered language to acknowledge fully the concept of ‘‘kinship.’’ For females to maximally succeed in the military, and particularly in combat roles, patriarchy as the defining explanation for male–female interaction must be discarded and the enabling concepts of equivalency and kinship must be embraced. The continued strength of military organizations and the individuals within them emerges from the reciprocity of these two concepts.\n\nDownload\n\nThe research applies a gender-perspective on three case-studies: the N.A.T.O., the U.S. Army and the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), in order to understand both the legislative framework and the reality of gender inclusion and discrimination in the three cases investigated.

The data is based on 60 in-depth, semi-structured, interviews that formed part of a major three-year longitudinal study (2008–11). The great majority of the recruits, were aged between 16–19 years old, and were in the infantry or other combat related units. The article explores the characteristics of the peer group culture, discusses the important function of role models, and considers the career point at which the trainees begin to regard themselves as being a “real” soldier. The idealised and hegemonic form of masculinity that the recruits aspired to was based on physicality and toughness and was encapsulated in the action image of the “warrior hero”. However, although the culture was highly competitive, the data shows there to be a more nuanced form of hegemonic military masculinity, which was also inclusive and egalitarian, and contained a number of more feminised associated qualities such ...\n\nDownload\n\nSexual assault has become pandemic and even a common occurrence among the ranks of all branches of the U.S. military. The Department of Defense estimates that in the year 2012 alone, 26,000 active duty soldiers were sexually assaulted. The military rape culture was thrust to the forefront of the media in 1991 as a result of the Tailhook Scandal. The military and Congress have not sat idly by, but twenty-three years and hundreds of thousands of assaults later, nothing has successfully alleviated the rates of sexual violence.This paper explores why such efforts have failed to produce the desired results and what must be done moving forward. It cannot be that the military is simply stubbornly anti-feminist. I offer that such past efforts fall flat because they fail to permeate the hyper-masculine military culture. In order to make real change, the military must rebrand itself in a way that encourages female leadership and moves beyond the inhibitions imposed by “hyper-masculinity.”\n\nDownload"
