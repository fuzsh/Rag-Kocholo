        "text": "Lathe of Heaven\n\n1980 Taurus Film, WNET\n\n++ reality drifting\n\ncolor: made for TV\n\nproduced,\n\ndirected David Loxton\n\nFred Barzyk based on Ursula K. Le Guin’s novel teleplay by Roger E. Swaybill,\n\nDiane English creative consultant Ursula K. Le Guin music Michael Small\n\nBruce Davison as George Orr Kevin Conway as Dr. William Haber Margaret Avery as Heather LeLache Niki Flacks as Penny Crouch Peyton Park as Mannie Ahrens\n\nPlace/Date: Portland, Oregon / the near future\n\nPost-apocalypse.\n\nNow, this is a proper science fiction story, albeit a far-fetched one, about dreams and reality.\n\nAs a made-for-TV video, it’s pretty limited in many ways, representing future architecture by contemporary architecture, for instance.\n\nGadget: “augmenter” a dream-recording machine.\n\nAliens: are modeled after a certain animal — it’s explained in the video.\n\nVehicle: aliens arrive in glowing saucers that don’t appear solid. A car appears to be electric.\n\nWeapons: an SR-71 and Nike Ajax missiles represent the human fight against aliens, the latter having already been decommissioned long before the video appeared. Ah well, they looked cool.\n\nCheck out the fancy future fashions. They have a lot to do with the plot.\n\nThe overall style is pretty solidly ’70s, as it would be in 1980. It’s a little hard to look at in places.\n\nA re-make in 2002 is in many ways superior… at least it brings the style into the new millennium. It loses the aliens altogether — they weren’t necessary for the plot, but the fashions, which do have to do with the plot, are much more lush. It doesn’t bother to explain stuff so much, which is also an improvement. On the other hand, the director had the dialog reduced to whispers, which needlessly detracts.\n\nLa Guerre du feu\n\n[Quest for Fire]\n\n1981 20th Century Fox\n\n++ cave-man action-adventure\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Jean-Jacques Annaud produced Jacques Dorfmann\n\nJohn Kemeny\n\nVéra Belmont\n\nDenis Héroux\n\nMichael Gruskoff screenplay Gérard Brach based on J.-H. Rosny’s\n\nLa Guerre du feu\n\nEverett McGill as Naoh Ron Perlman as Amouka Nameer El-Kadi as Gaw Rae Dawn Chong as Ika Antonio Barichievich a Kazamm\n\nIt relates a story of a time on Earth that we can only guess about, and the guesses come from scientific observation.\n\nThe setting is some time in the past, when there are multiple strains of humanoids occupying the planet. They are very different one from another, but maybe they can share something.\n\nIt is remarkable that long since the film appeared, it has been established that Homo Sapiens and Neanderthal were meeting and even breeding. Some stuff that they just imagined in this film, really happened.\n\nThe film features invented languages (there is a somewhat embarrassing story about certain words). Nobody speaks English or anything like that. Also, it has mammoths.\n\nThis was my favorite movie of the year. It’s the best cave man movie ever, for its attempt at realism, for the drama, for the filming, and for the acting.\n\nOutland\n\n1981 The Ladd Company\n\nOK western on Jupiter’s moon Io\n\ncolor\n\ndirected, wrote Peter Hyams produced Richard A. Roth,\n\nStanley O’Toole music Jerry Goldsmith production designer Philip Harrison dir. photo. Stephen Goldblatt\n\nSean Connery as Marshal William T. O’Niel Peter Boyle as Mark Sheppard Frances Sternhagen as Dr. Marian Lazarus James B. Sikking as Sgt. Montone Kika Markham as Carol O’Niel Clarke Peters as Ballard Steven Berkhoff as Sagan Nicholas Barnes as Paul O’Niel\n\nPlace: mining outpost CON-AM 27 on Jupiter’s moon Io. 2144 personnel. Mostly mining titanium.\n\nThe effect of the planet Jupiter very good — its clouds really churn, and it does manage to look big.\n\nThe mine’s sets are pretty extensive — greenhouse, bar, multiple rooms and corridors. The sets are made to look like they’re inside metal dwellings — all metal beams and air locks.\n\nVehicle: space transport, mostly seen when landing (reminiscent of the Moon landing in 2001: A Space Odyssey).\n\nThe miniatures are very elaborate, but even here, a sense of scale is lacking.\n\nNice space suits: lights conveniently light up the workers’ faces.\n\nFavorite means of suicide and killing: person exposed to vacuum, and they blow up. I lost count of how many times….\n\nThe technology is all decidedly 1980s, and looks pretty dated. (Let this be a warning of sci-fi cinematographers: do not use cutting-edge contemporary gadgets to represent future technology. The gadgets don’t have to really work, they just need to seem to work. You’re not fooling any tech people now — which are at best going to be your most vocal fans, if you have any.)\n\nNobody messes with any sissy beam weapons here. It’s good old firearms all around.\n\nThe film makes no attempt to represent the 1/6 Earth’s gravity (although it is mentioned) except outdoors. (Do they think gravity only applies out-of-doors? Or does their ’80s technology include artificial gravity generators? Sure, it would have been hard to have all the actors bounce-walk — besides being undignified for a cops-n-bad-guys movie.)\n\n(I feel obliged to mention some astronomical facts that had not yet been uncovered, at the time the film appeared. First, Io is constantly being resurfaced, with numerous active volcanoes spitting stuff hundreds of kilometers into the sky all the time. That would quickly wipe out anything you tried to build here. Second, Io is deep within Jupiter’s radiation belts, which fries electronics on spacecraft, even when encased in a thick metal box. It would give a human a lethal dose inside of a day. Io won’t be anyplace for people to be, any time soon, anyway. Mining titanium? Well, you gotta have some reason to be there… but titanium is a pretty common metal — our own Moon has plenty of titanium. What would one really go to Io for? Sulfur, maybe — it’s all over the surface.)\n\nThis is just a story of a good tough cop in a bad tough town — the town just happens to be on Io.\n\nThe acting is very strong overall. Connery is very much at his best, and all the other principal actors are engaging and believable.\n\nTaken as a straight cop film, it’s not bad. As sci-fi, the main thing is the space scenes and miniatures. As a cliffhanger, the cliffs are at least otherworldly.\n\nWhy is it in my list? What’s new about it, as a science fiction movie? The subgenre “western-in-space” was nothing new at the time, but this might be the best western-in-space up to that time. Also, it’s supposed to be on Io, which, although that has nothing to do with anything but the scenery, was something new in film.\n\nBlade Runner\n\n1982 The Ladd Company, Shaw Brothers\n\n++ dystopian future, cloned humans\n\ncolor\n\nproduced Michael Deeley\n\nDon Reynolds directed Ridley Scott based on Philip K. Dick’s\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? screenplayHampton Fancher\n\nDavid Peoples music Vangelis\n\nHarrison Ford as Rick Deckard Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty Sean Young as Rachael Darryl Hannah as Pris Morgan Paull as Holden Edward James Olmos as Gaff Joanna Cassidy as Zhora Brion James as Leon Kowalski James Hong as Hannibal Chew William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian M. Emmet Walsh as Byrant Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell\n\nVehicles: flying cars\n\nRobots: not exactly machines, rather, biological “replicants”, factory-cloned specialized humans and animals.\n\nThe famous cartoonist, Moebius, gets credit for the look and set design. The story line is that of a 1940s film noir, complete with cliffhangers and layers of deception.\n\nScience fiction is throughout this film, beneath the social backdrop of dripping polluted squalor and towering bastions of ultrarich, there’s the idea of black-market alleyway genetic engineering, and the big what-if of manufactured people.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this was the first film adaptation of a Philip K. Dick story. He died just months before its release. The next decades would see a flurry of major films based on his work.\n\nEverything about this movie is great — except the end, which gets hollywoody — but everything besides that is great. If you haven’t seen it, see it — preferably on a big screen. It is a very big production, and a work of art.\n\nE.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\n1982 Amblin Entertainment\n\n+ cute alien\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Steven Spielberg produced Kathleen Kennedy,\n\nSteven Spielberg wrote Melissa Mathison music John Williams director photographyAllen Daviau special effects - creator Carlo Rambaldi\n\nDee Wallace as Mary Henry Thomas as Elliott Peter Coyote as Keys Robert MacNaughton as Michael Drew Barrymore as Gertie K. C. Martel as Greg Sean Frye as Steve Tom Howell as Tyler Erika Eleniak a girl Pat Welsh voice of E.T.\n\nAlien: E.T. whose glowing finger does all sorts of magic tricks.\n\nVehicles: The E.T. spaceship, shaped like a barrel with bright lights all around. A flying bicycle.\n\nPremise: A space alien (with huge blue eyes, so everybody knows he’s friendly) gets stuck on Earth, has a lot of adventures, befriends a little kid, and learns some rudimentary English.\n\nIt’s another Spielberg spectacle! I am conflicted on this film, as often happens with his films. He’s brilliant, and has a very strong vision of how a picture should look. On the other hand, it’s not great sci-fi, and it’s a shameless tear-jerker, which I really hate.\n\nIt is what it is: great family viewing about a cute alien. Also, great marketing for all manner of placed products. That’s the way you do it!\n\nThe Thing\n\n1982 The Turman-Foster Company\n\n++ shape-shifter horror from space\n\ncolor\n\ndirector John Carpenter producers David Foster,\n\nLawrence Turman based on Who Goes There?\n\nby John W. Campbell, Jr. assist. director Wilbur Stark art director Henry Larrecq special visual effects Albert Whitlock special effects Roy Arbogast set decorator John Dwyer\n\nKurt Russell as MacReady A. Wilford Brimley as Blair T. K. Carter as Nauls David Clennon as Palmer Keith David as Childs Richard Dysart as Dr. Copper Charles Hallahan as Norris Peter Maloney as Bennings Richard Masur as Clark Donald Moffat as Garry Joel Polis as Fuchs Thomas Waites as Windows\n\nAlien: a body-incorporating shape-shifter.\n\nVehicle: a flying saucer appears coming into Earth’s atmosphere, evidently not well under control. We get to see the saucer again — they say it’s buried in ice at least 100,000 years old.\n\nThey’re in Antarctica this time.\n\nIt starts with a helicopter chasing a dog running in snow. They’re shooting it! Bastards!\n\nComputer: Kurt Russell is drinking J&B Whiskey, playing chess on a computer — he prefers to short the computer out.\n\nAs science fiction and as horror, this is a big improvement over the 1951 adaptation. The nature of the monster has everything to do with the plot and the action. The gore is only part of it — the suspense never lets up, and the script plays the sense of mutual mistrust for all it’s worth. Then, the monster itself is something we hadn’t seen before… it just keeps surprising us with horrors — a horror that just keeps horrifying.\n\nIt has those standard horror moments: the monster has already killed most of the guys, and they don’t know where it’s gone, so naturally they split up and all walk into dark rooms. It’s hard to break old habits.\n\nI was warned against this movie when it first came out. Too gruesome. Yea, it’s pretty gruesome. To be fair to the older film, scenes like these wouldn’t have been allowed on the screen twenty years before. This adaptation is closer to the story than the 1951 film, in that the monster is a shape-shifter, and the people can’t tell who’s who.\n\nA “prequel” to the film came out in 2011, with more gore and suspense; more ideas were not to be expected.\n\nLiquid Sky\n\n1983 indie\n\n+ aliens-n-drugs-n-artistes\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Slava Tsukerman produced Slava Tsukerman,\n\nNina V. Kerova,\n\nRobert E. Field wrote Slava Tsukerman,\n\nAnne Carlisle,\n\nNina V. Kerova music Slava Tsukerman,\n\nClive Smith\n\nAnna Carlsile as Margaret/Jimmy Paula E. Sheppard as Adrian Susan Doukas as Sylvia\n\nVehicle: small silver saucer\n\nAlien: one must be in there, but we never see it.\n\nWeapon: A crystal that appears in the brains of people who have sex with Sylvia… or most of them anyway. Sylvia thinks she’s doing it with her own body… but it’s really not very clear. Very little is very clear.\n\nHowever it is that people are dying, it is clear that heroin and sex are involved.\n\nDespite the apparently central role of the alien in the film, it’s not essentially a science fiction film. It’s much more about the hip, nihilistic, drug-n-sex lifestyle of models and actors.\n\nAs a movie overall, it holds together well stylistically, and although it leaves a lot to be desired by way of production values, acting and direction, it’s not so bad as to detract terribly from the story line.\n\nIt’s just so damned weird. The fact that an alien had such a lethal voyeuristic focus on this one lady was only icing on the cake. At the very least, the alien here is different from other sci-fi films.\n\nRepo Man\n\n1984 Edge City\n\n++ alien-assisted black comedy\n\ncolor\n\ndirected, wrote Alex Cox produced Peter McCarthy,\n\nMichael Nesmith,\n\nGerald T. Olson,\n\nJonathan Wacks music Tito Larriva,\n\nSteven Hufsteter cinematography Robby Miller\n\nHarry Dean Stanton as Bud Emilio Estevez as Otto Maddox Tracey Walter as Miller Olivia Barash as Leila Sy Richardson as Lite Susan Barnes as Agent Rogersz Fox Harris as J. Frank Parnell Tom Finnegan as Oly Del Zamora as Lagarto Rodriguez Eddie Velez as Napoleon “Napo” Rodriguez Zander Schloss as Kevin Jennifer Balgobin as Debbi Dick Rude as Duke Miguel Sandoval as Archie Vonetta McGee as Marlene Richard Foronjy as Plettschner Helen Martin as Mrs. Parks The Circle Jerks nightclub band\n\nIt starts out blazing hot and sweaty and horribly weird, and only gets weirder. Some guy is driving through the desert with something in the trunk of his car. As he keeps telling people, “you really don’t want to look in there.”\n\nThe young protagonist is the up-and-coming of down-and-out L.A. He aspires to be a “repo man”: a guy who, by whatever means, repossesses property from debtors. (The film is worth watching for the lessons in how to effect repossessions alone.)\n\nThe protagonist and his friends and some of his enemies are all part of the late punk culture. Some are psychopath druggies. Nothing good was going to come of this, anyway. Add to the mix a secret government agency who are after… something or other… but will stop at nothing whatever.\n\nThe sci-fi that we get to see only serves as a clarifying thread to the mad desolation of all the characters. The society is obviously insane, could the aliens be any worse?\n\nThe Terminator\n\n1984 Helmdale Film Corporation, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film funding, Cinema ’84\n\n++ monster future android\n\ncolor\n\ndirector James Cameron producer Gale Anne Hurd writers James Cameron,\n\nGale Anne Hurd music Brad Fiedel dir. photography Adam Greenberg\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger the Terminator Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor Paul Winfield as Lt. Ed Traxler Lance Henriksen as Det. Hal Vukovich Rick Rossovich as Matt Buchanan Bess Motta as Ginger Ventura Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman Dick Miller pawn shop clerk Shawn Schepps as Nancy Bruce M. Kerner desk sergeant Franco Columbu future terminator Bill Paxton punk leader Brad Rearden punk Brian Thompson punk\n\nDate (future): 2029;\n\nDate/Place: (present 1984) / Los Angeles\n\nWeapons: in the future, very excellent stop-action giant killer robots with death rays.\n\nRobots: the Terminator is a cyborg weapon. At first he resembles nothing so much as a naked bodybuilder, but he gradually exposes his inner metallic glory.\n\nComputers: the Terminator itself is a limited artificial intelligence. A future artificial intelligence called Skylink sends it back in time.\n\nGadgets: We don’t get to see it, but in the future they have a time machine with the limitation that it can only transport living flesh back in time.\n\nThe film lays the premise out at the start: in the future, evil robots, led by Skylink, are at war with the remainders of humanity. Humanity has a strong leader who’s putting up a good defense, so the robots send back in time one of their own, a “terminator” cyborg, to exterminate the leader’s mother, before he can be born. But then, the humans send one of their own back in time to stop it.\n\nMuch pool-cue-play, gun-play, car-play, motorcycle-play, truck-play, and hydraulic-press-play ensues. Also, obligatory romance with limited foreplay.\n\nThis is easily the best robot movie of the ’80s, and among the best sci-fi movies of the decade. Several scenes are rightly described as “iconic”.\n\nMost memorable quote:\n\n“I’ll be back.”\n\nAnd indeed, he was: the Terminator franchise consists, at the time of this writing, of five direct sequels (some of which aren’t bad themselves), and four or so spin-offs, besides video games and novels.\n\nDune\n\n1984 Dino De Laurentiis Corporation\n\n− big-budget space opera editing disaster\n\ncolor\n\ndirected David Lynch screenplay David Lynch produced Raffaella De Laurentiis based onFrank Herberts’s Dune music Toto; Brian Eno cinematography Freddie Francis\n\nKyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides /\n\nMuad’Dib Francesca Annis as Lady Jessica Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck Linda Hunt as Shadout Mapes Brad Dourif as mentat Piter De Vries Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho Everett McGill as Stilgar Kenneth McMillan as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen Sting as Feyd-Rautha Paul Smith as the Beast Rabbanutha José Ferrer as Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV Silvana Mangano as Bene-Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam Freddie Jones as mentat Thufir Hawat Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan Max von Sydow as Dr. Kynes Alicia Roanne Witt as Alia Atreides\n\nDate: 10191, so distant that people have lost all memory of Earth.\n\nPlaces: primarily the desert planet Arrakis (aka Dune), a water world Caladan (home of the House Atreides), Giedi Prime (home of the House Harkonnen, Kaitain (capital of the Imperium, home of the House Corrino).\n\nThe novel is a story of Byzantine intrigue on a galactic scale between powerful houses and some technological-religious orders, and the poor inhabitants of the planet Dune, and the spice that the sandworms of Dune produce, which is the basis for the galactic economy. It’s very complicated, and engrossing.\n\nAliens: Sandworms, native to planet Arrakis, grow to enormous size, and are quite dangerous. They are also responsible for “spice”. A desert mouse, “muad’dib”.\n\nThere are many kinds of humans, the product of selective breeding, mutation, cloning, and exposure to the spice: Spacing Guild Navigators, Bene Gesserit nuns (aka. “witches”), Mentats (human computers and psychics), Fremen, who dwell in the high desert.\n\nRobots and computers: one thing all groups in the story agree with is the prohibition of thinking machines, due to an ancient war between humans and machines — human mentats took their place. (Thus considerably simplifying the sci-fi.)\n\nVehicles: faster-than-light space transports called “heighliners”; aircraft are “ornithopter” or “’thopter”, have beating insectoidal wings.\n\nTechnologies special to the story: bioengineering of humans for a prophesied goal; travel in space faster than light by means of prescience brought about by the spice.\n\nGadgets: Crysknife: a knife made of the tooth of a sandworm. Hunter-seeker: assassin’s weapon — a floating poisonous syringe. Holtzman shield, a personal force-field that slows any object or particle. Lasgun: dangerous to use, because if they touch a Holtzman shield, a nuclear explosion occurs. Stilsuit: a full-body fluid-regeneration suit for survival on the surface of Dune.\n\nCould a movie really get around all that? In this case: no.\n\nThey made a valiant whack at it.\n\nMany of the special effects were pretty good: the personal shields, the huge heighliners, the desert world, and the sandworms were quite believable. The overall look of the film is rich and deeply textured.\n\nThe acting is mostly superb, given what the actors had to work with.\n\nBut no. It’s a confused, dismal failure at the end. I have read that the original cut was some three hours long, and, at the order of the producers, many important scenes were left on the cutting room floor. What is left was just too fragmented. Way too often, it resorts to narration to explain what the hell is going on, and way too often we hear the thoughts of the actors — sometimes expressing the bloody obvious.\n\nThe result is a story that is incomprehensible for those who haven’t read the book, and frustrating for those who have. It’s awful.\n\nDavid Lynch has been reluctant to even discuss the film in interviews.\n\nNote: in 2000 a TV miniseries appeared, Frank Herbert’s Dune, done much better. In 2021, another adaptation appeared, again, much better.\n\nSeksmisja\n\n[Sexmission]\n\n1984 Zespół Filmowy KADR\n\n− post-apocalypse sex farce\n\ncolor\n\nPolish\n\nproduced, directed Juliusz Machulski wrote Juliusz Machulski,\n\nJolanta Hartwig,\n\nPavel Hajný cinematography Jerzy Łukaszewicz edited Miroslawa Garlicka\n\nJerzy Stuhr as Maksymilian ‘Maks’ Paradys Olgierd Łukaszewicz as Albert Starski 1991 Dorota Stalińska TV reporter Janusz Michałowski as Prof. Wiktor Kuppelweiser Juliusz Lisowski as Albert’s father Zofia Plewińska as Maks’ wife 2044 Bożena Stryjkówna as Lamia Reno Bogusława Pawelec as Emma Dax Hanna Stankówna as Dr. Tekla Beata Tyszkiewicz as Dr. Berna Ryszarda Hanin as Dr. Jadwiga Yanda Barbara Ludwiżanka as Babcia Wiesław Michnikowski as Her Excellency Mirosława Marcheluk secretary to Her Excellency Ewa Szykulska instructor Hanna Mikuć as Linda Magdalena Kuta guard in blockhouse 1 Anna Wesołowska guard in blockhouse 2 Grazyna Trela guard in mine Małgorzata Rogacka asylum officer Alicja Zommer chief of radiolocation Beata Maj radiolocation officer Elzbieta Jasińska fake Maks Teresa Makarska fake Albert\n\nDates 1991, 2044\n\nPremise: A couple of guys get frozen, to be woken up 53 years later. They expect to be heroes, but life has gone all complicated. Instead, pretty young women imprison them. Somehow in the interim, the scientists have killed off all the men, and the women now reproduce by parthenogenesis.\n\nIt’s a comedy, with one guy being a clown, the other being the straight man, and the women serving basically to reiterate and emphasize conventional sexual conceptions.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense that the women have a belief system stating that men never existed, and that all historical figures were really women, and that they would let the men live, and even put them on public trial.\n\nBut a lot of this doesn’t make sense. Maybe it didn’t need to.\n\nI read that this film remains beloved in its home country. Audiences of its time would not have missed parallels between the regimented women’s society and the contemporary communist regime in power in Poland. For example, the man objecting to surveillance.\n\nScience-fiction-wise, it’s pretty thin. Besides the original premise, there are a lot of gadgets, nothing new. They spent some money on fancy sets, but again, nothing is really new.\n\nThe Dixieland jazz… come on. Do they think that is the only music for science-fiction comedy? (Think Sleeper.)\n\nThe film was generally badly in need of editing. It’s nearly two hours long. They had maybe one hour of material. It draws some scenes out pointlessly, and repeats some situations.\n\nAny linguistic or cultural jokes might be lost in translation, but I think most of the jokes are pretty obvious, and easily recognized. So many not-very-comically-thwarted escapes happened, I lost count. While I’m very happy to view perfectly-formed breasts by the dozen, by the end of this film, the undressing had become a drag.\n\nBrazil\n\n1985 Embassy International Pictures; Brazil Productions\n\n++ ducted dystopian future satire\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Terry Gilliam produced Arnon Milchan screenplay Terry Gilliam\n\nTom Stoppard\n\nCharles McKeown music Michael Kamen\n\nJonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry Kim Greist as Jill Layton Robert de Niero as Archibald Tuttle “Harry” Katherine Helmond as Mrs. Ida Lowry Ian Holm as Mr. Kurzmann Bob Hoskins as Spoor Michael Palin as Jack Lint Ian Richardson as Mr. Warrenn Peter Vaughan as Mr. Helpmann\n\nIt’s rich, confusing, gorgeous, horrifying, and funny as hell. The vision is very peculiar and still familiar. There’s not much to compare this film to, save other Gilliam films.\n\nIs it sci-fi? It has no sci-fi staples. But technology gone mad is a large part of the problem faced by the characters. The technology though is bits and pieces from the industrial revolution, the ’20s, the ’40s, the ’50s and ’60s, all bloated, overcharged, usually recalcitrant and often menacing. And ducts — ducts everywhere.\n\nThe food in the French restaurant alone would be worth a sci-fi movie.\n\nLowry: Give my regards to Alice and the twins! Lint: … Triplets! Lowry: Oh, god! How time flies!\n\nTuttle: Bloody paperwork. Huh!\n\nConfess! Quickly! If you hold out too long, you could jeopardize your credit rating!\n\nThe Quiet Earth\n\n1985 Pillsbury studios\n\n+ where-is-everybody\n\ncolor\n\nbased on Craig Harrison’s novel produced Sam Pillsbury\n\nDon Reynolds directed Geoffrey Murphy music John Charles\n\nBruno Lawrence as Zac Hobson Alison Routledge as Joanne Peter Smith as Api\n\nA guy wakes up in a motel, like maybe with a hangover — but it’s worse than that. There is nothing on the radio. The clock isn’t working. Etc. And there’s nobody around, anywhere.\n\nIt’s a typical paranoid nightmare situation. But this film takes it way farther than most do.\n\nThe acting is good, the production is good despite the low budget, and the idea is weird enough.\n\nIt’s an unexpectedly satisfying, odd little movie.\n\nCocoon\n\n1985 Zanuck/Brown Company\n\n++ aging, death, happiness, and space aliens\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Ron Howard produced Richard D.

They have some alien gadgets that make flashing lights and noises. We never find out quite what the gadgets do.\n\nVehicle: a spaceship, a very pretty flying saucer.\n\nAtlantis gets passing mention… well, things are getting fantastical, why not mix fantasies up a little? Dolphins are also somehow involved, but this isn’t emphasized.\n\nWe get some inter-alien sex action, kind of. But that’s the silly part of it.\n\nThe main story is about the realities of aging and death, separation and love. It manages to look at these in various ways, all the while doing some serious imagining about how different from us space aliens might be.\n\nBeyond being entertaining and massaging some emotions, this movie is thoughtful, and very inventive.\n\nBack to the Future\n\n1985 Amblin Entertainment, Universal Pictures\n\n++ time travel alla DeLorean\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Robert Zemeckis produced Bob Gale,\n\nNeil Canton wrote Robert Zemeckis,\n\nBill Gale exec. producers Steven Spielberg,\n\nKathleen Kennedy,\n\nFrank Marshall dir. photo.

Nov. 5, 1955\n\nThe main ingredient of the time machine is a “flux capacitor”. We learn that a DeLorean can take a lot of punishment. Maybe due to the stainless-steel construction, which also “improves the flux dispersal”. It needs plutonium as fuel, or else any other source of “1.21 gigawatts of power”, pronounced with a soft initial ‘g’.\n\nIt’s a nice little excursion into a fading past, as well as a study in the usual paradoxes.\n\nMichael J. Fox is the small-alpha male, loved by all the women of the town. In the past, the high school girls think he’s a “dream boat”.\n\nThere are lots of great performances, mostly washed out by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. McFly’s dad watches Science Fiction Theater and writes sci-fi! He’s one of the best characters — he works through some real severe personal problems.\n\nEnemy Mine\n\n1985 Kings Road Entertainment, SLM Production Group\n\n++ space aliens social commentary\n\ncolor\n\nproduced Stephen Friedman directed Wolfgang Petersen based on Barry Longyear’s story screenplay Edward Khmara dir. photo.

On the planet, various types of scary bugs.\n\nPlace: in space, nice views of planets. On the planet where they crash, there are lots of very lovely painted landscapes, with lots of planets and moons in the sky.\n\nVehicles: Several types of pretty spaceships, both human and alien, action is basic WWII dogfight stuff.\n\nThe alien’s language is pretty elaborate and imaginative.\n\nIt’s a little silly. Why should I expect more of science fiction? The message is a good one, though: basically, against slavery and bigotry.\n\nThe script develops some secondary characters and scenes poorly. I read there were very bad production problems making the movie. (There was a change of director.)\n\nBut the primary story holds together well, and the acting of the principals is strong, so that altogether it works.\n\nThis film is very much a moral and social commentary. It was maybe a bit beyond what could have been done in the 1950s, dominant social prejudices being what they were, and the powers that be, being what they were.\n\nStylistically, it is much nearer to the classic space films of the ’60s, than to the derivatives of the few big films of the ’70s. There is no fancy CGI in this — it could have been made in the ’60s. But it wasn’t. Why not? It is about what the studios wanted to sell, or maybe about what the Western public would pay for.\n\nHombre mirando al sudeste\n\n[Man Facing Southeast]\n\n1986 Cinequanon\n\n++ mental patient — space alien or not?\n\ncolor\n\nSpanish\n\ndirected,\n\nwrote Eliseo Subiela produced Luján Pflaum,\n\nHugo E.

We see some evidence that he is more than human. There are no special effects, although he seems to have some minor powers.\n\nThere are other film stories like this one.\n\nThe script mentions Morel’s Invention.\n\nThere is a controversy about the 2001 movie K-Pax, whose plot is suspiciously similar. Another film, Mr. Jones (1993), was expressly based on this movie.\n\nI only experienced one lapse in believability: toward the end, there is a romantic scene that didn’t work for me. But it sort of works in the story.\n\nThe execution of the movie is excellent — it is beautifully shot, and well directed and acted. Of the films like this that I have seen, it is the best.\n\nПисьма мёртвого человека\n\n[Dead Man’s Letters]\n\n1986 Lenfilm\n\n+ post nuclear apocalypse\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Konstantin Lopushansky wrote Konstantin Lopushansky,\n\nVyacheslav Rybakov,\n\nBoris Strugatsky dir. photography Nikolai Pokoptsev art direction Elena Amshinskaya,\n\nViktor Ivanov composed Aleksandr Zhurbin\n\nRolan Bykov as Prof. Larsen I.

I do not consider post-nuclear-apocalypse as being a strongly science fiction form. It’s science fiction of the engineering variety, where we engineer our own destruction. But… it’s not clear that such a thing isn’t about to come to pass.\n\nThis is purely a post-apocalypse film. As these things go, it is one of the better ones. It’s beautifully shot, and it’s all surprises — mostly not nice surprises, and the characters are richly portrayed. It manages to carry a message anyway.\n\nThe message is about tragedy. It does offer a glimmer of hope, but it is left to your imagination.\n\nIt ends with an excerpt from the Einstein-Russell Manifesto:\n\n“There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? We appeal as human beings to human beings: Remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, there lies before you the risk of universal death.”\n\nКин-дза-дза!\n\n[Kin-dza-dza!]\n\n1986 Mosfilm, Artistic Association of Comedy and Musical Films\n\n++ space travel comedy\n\ncolor\n\nRussian\n\ndirected Georgiy Daneliya wrote Georgiy Daneliya,\n\nRevaz Gabriadze music Gia Kancheli cinematography Pavel Lebeshev\n\nUncle Vova and Gedevan become unwilling visitors to various planets in the galaxy when they attempt to aid an apparently crazy guy in the street.\n\nTo describe how weird this is… the setting is mostly junk in the desert.\n\nMuch of the plot concerns the difficulties of people of different cultures getting along and doing business, and finding one another rude, stupid, dishonest and absurd. The Earthlings just want to get home. The aliens are just trying to scrape by, doing their best to be polite.\n\nThe aliens find that Vova has a box of matches, which they refer to as “kts”, and (for no reason that is ever explained) they regard as extremely valuable.\n\nSeen through the Earthling’s eyes, the aliens look very, very silly. Yet they manage to get some things done.\n\nPlaces: Moscow, planets Plyuk, Khanud, and Alpha in (or near) the Kin-dza-dza galaxy.\n\nAliens: people play the aliens from the different planets. What is important to them is social class. On Plyuk, the higher class are “Chatlan”, and the lower class are “Patsak”. This influences how they greet one another, and where they sit in public transportation. They find the Earthlings to be Patsak. The Alphans don’t care which class the aliens from Kin-dza-dza are, they reckon they would all be better off turned into cacti.\n\nVehicles: various flying vehicles called “pepelats”, roughly egg shaped, some apparently made of metal scrap, which in motion sound like rusty metal scraping. With a “gravitsappa”, they may be capable of intergalactic flight. Large, rapid-moving open carts with six wheels and no apparent engine.\n\nGadgets: instantaneous teleporters, telepathy device (“tsak”, a little bell worn under the nose), ray guns (called “tranklucators”), devices to determine one’s social status.\n\nIt’s wonderfully done. The acting and camera work are excellent. The scenery, albeit composed mostly of junk, is still weird enough that when it does something, that serves as good enough an explanation as any. The result is that the improbable is logically acceptable.\n\nAt the end, I was believing it. The absurdity had become natural. That is the biggest joke.\n\nMy DVD includes a glossary. It’s helpful, for talking about things in the movie.\n\nCherry 2000\n\n1987 ERP Productions\n\nOK post-apocalyptic robots-n-society\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Steve De Jarnatt produced Edward R.

He has to get her back, and he has her chip, and he has some bucks. But in this post-apocalyptic world, the robots are hard to come by. So out into the Zone 7 wasteland he goes!\n\nIt looks like cheese, and it has many cheese-like qualities. But there’s a lot going on here, and some really fun performances. Fortunately, the film never attempts to be something more than it is, or even real cheese, for that matter.\n\nGriffith especially plays her role with gusto, but in a voice that belongs to a server at a motorway diner. She’s also likable, as are other characters they meet on the way. The non-likables, too, are notable, especially Thomerson, as the insanely perverted utopian survivalist commander. (Compare with A Boy and His Dog.)\n\n“Yeah, Zone 7’s a tough place. You should see the way they carry on out there!

Alan “Dutch” Schaefer Carl Weathers as Al Dillon Elpidia Carrillo as Anna Gonsalves\n\nAlien: the Predator, an intelligent, brutal creature that stalks and kills for points or for kicks (not clarified in the movie).\n\nVehicle: an alien spacecraft appears entering Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nWeapons: The predator has a ray gun, but uses it sparingly. The humans have profuse supplies of badass weaponry that proves ineffective.\n\nGadgets: primarily, the Predator has a screen that renders it nearly invisible. It also has a med-kit, and a self-destruction gizmo.\n\nThis is basically a space monster movie, but a superior one. It doesn’t fit into the usual space vampire or monster-here-to-eat-us, because the monster is intelligent, and while it isn’t above snacking on peoples, its object is different from those of the usual evil alien.\n\nThe wee bits of real science fiction here are not exactly novel: the idea that an alien might kill for sport or something, and the way the protagonist avoids getting eaten.\n\nThe filming being done in real jungle, and the big, bad, sweaty actors play to a terrific sense of apprehension. And the monster, once we get a look at it, is one horrid surprise after another.\n\nThe human characters aren’t exactly sympathetic, either. It’s basically monster vs. monster. Either way, science will prevail!\n\nThis is the seminal film of a franchise including several sequels, some spin-offs, video games, etc.\n\nRoboCop\n\n1987 Orion Pictures\n\n+ bionic cop action in dystopian future\n\ncolor: stop-motion scenes, matte effects\n\ndirected Paul Verhoeven produced Edward Neumeier,\n\nMichael Miner music Basil Poledouris cinematography Jost Vacano\n\nPeter Weller as Alex Murphy Nancy Allen as Anne Lewis Daniel O’Herlihy the Old Man Ronny Cox as Dick Jones Kurtwood Smith as Clarence Boddicker Miguel Ferrer as Bob Morton Robert DoQui as Sgt.

Of course, nobody, except — subconsciously — a portion of the expected audience. It’s not a surprise that our hero is conflicted, or that a lot of frustrated guys flocked to the theaters. (I did.)\n\nIt’s a familiar theme. What’s new here is some really nice animation, a relatively good script, and some really bad bad guys. Some nice jokes on modern consumerism appear in the form of TV commercials.\n\nThe violence is constant and graphic, so much so, that the filmmakers cut some scenes to avoid an MPAA X-rating.\n\nThe first of a franchise of sequels, TV series and miniseries, a re-make, and video games.\n\nКонец Вечности\n\n[The End of Eternity]\n\n1987 Kinostudiya Mosfil’m\n\nOK action/mystery/suspense time travel\n\ncolor\n\nRussian\n\nbased on Isaac Asimov’s novel screenplay Budimir Metal’nikov,\n\nAndrei Yermash directed Andrei Yermash operator-scenes Naum Ardashnikov chief prod. designer Boris Blank production designer Vladimir Murzin composer Eduard Artem’ev directors Boris Vel’sher,\n\nLeonid Chertok photography V.

Unsa\n\nPremise: “Eternity” is the name of an organization of people who employ time travel for the betterment of humanity (as they judge it). That already sounds pretty dodgy, of course, and we quickly find out that not everything is congenial in Eternity.\n\n“Computers” here refer to high placed persons within Eternity. (Remember, at the time the novel appeared, the word “computer” still denoted a profession, not a kind of machine.)\n\nVehicles: we see a lot of “time capsule” devices, that travel like elevators within time “corridors”. Also, people transport themselves in time by means of a device they just step into… I’m not sure what the distinction is, or if, somehow, they’re the same thing.\n\nWeapons: an “annihilator”, a sort of ray gun.\n\nThey spent some money and effort on sets and special effects for this film. It partially succeeds in imparting ponderousness, a sense of levels-within-levels. (But it’s a bit heavy on red LED alphanumeric displays.)\n\nUnfortunately, the pace of the film is pretty choppy. The story involves multiple threads, but they often interact in a clumsy way. For instance, the principal activity of Eternity is changing the time-line. The dialog mentions it a lot, but… little happens with it. Well, there is the one thread where a guy, sent into the past, placed a newspaper ad, which is found and interpreted by Eternity as a message centuries later.\n\nFor all the traveling in time, besides the Eternity headquarters and the present time, we see only one other time period, and we meet only one new character there.\n\nNear the end of a film, there is a long contemporary scene of dirty water pouring under a deteriorating concrete bridge. Several scenes come directly from the 1979 film Stalker. They have nothing to do with this story. If you hadn’t seen the other film, you would have to wonder why you are looking at a lot of dirty water and post-industrial ruins. It’s as though a Tarkovski-esque insertion would improve their film, as though they were desperate to save a film they knew wasn’t working out.\n\nSpoiler: The ending is a let-down, just opening more loose ends. I have not read the book, but I read that the ending is a big departure from the book, which the film otherwise followed.\n\nSome of the acting is good, but this is inconsistent too. Enough went wrong here in the script and the editing and the direction to render it not thrilling, as a science fiction story or as a movie. This was after all produced for TV, where we don’t expect the greatest production values.\n\nAltogether, it is a fair stab at an Asimov story, which itself is inventive and gripping — some main elements are pretty well represented. It’s not bad to look at, if your expectations aren’t too high.\n\nThey Live\n\n1988 Alive Films, Larry Franco Productions\n\nOK social aliens-already-here shoot-em-up\n\ncolor\n\nRoddy Piper as Nada Kieth David as Frank Armitage Meg Foster as Holly Thompson George “Buck” Flower drifter Peter Jackson as Gilbert Raymond St. Jacques street preacher Jason Robards III family man John Lawrence bearded man Susan Barnes brown haired woman Sy Richardson black revolutionary Wendy Brainard family man’s daughter Lucille Meredith female interviewer Susan Blanchard ingénue Norman Alden foreman Dana Bratton black junkie John F.

It’s cool and it’s down.\n\nPremise: the aliens have been here a long time, and they are running everything, the ultimate capitalists, lulling the human populace into compliant consumerism and slavery by means of mind control.\n\nAliens: look like human corpses with the skin burned off, but with bulgy silver eyes — when you look at them the right way.\n\nGadgets: The main gadget is sunglasses, which allow people to see not only the aliens in their true form, but subliminal messages that aliens have posted on every sign, in every magazine.\n\nThe aliens have wristwatches with which they can communicate with all their own kind, and with which they can open portals to other places.\n\nThe aliens also teleport themselves in space.\n\nWeapons: he-man guns, and more guns. If you like the idea of bursting into a crowded area and blasting away all the (unarmed, unprepared) bad people in the crowd, this is your movie.\n\nThe direction of this movie is awfully sloppy. The dialog, particularly, is almost never natural.\n\nThe protagonist and his buddy are very straight macho he-man types; the main female character is a standard Jezebel.\n\nThe aliens, taken as space aliens, are only remarkable in that they’re just like us except scary ugly — certainly nothing new in bad sci-fi. Taken as a tongue-in-cheek parody on modern economic life, they’re not bad.\n\nNonetheless, the story has moments of real inventiveness. Also, gotta like: the good guys don’t always win, and waiting to the end for a partial nude scene.\n\nПосетитель музея\n\n[Visitor to a Museum]\n\n1989 Lenfil’m, третье творческое объединение, госкино СССР, CSM Filmproduktion Ag.

There has been a global environmental catastrophe. Some apparently nice people put him up; they are in an uneasy relationship with human “degenerates”, who have their own desperate culture and religion — maybe they’re onto something. The guy has a curiosity in the degenerates that he can barely conceal.\n\nWhy were the Soviet filmmakers so good at this sort of thing? Maybe something to do with Russian history. Whatever it is, the filming is great, the acting is great, the soundscape is ominous, the mood is crushing and relentless.\n\nThe only way in which this is science fiction is that a global environmental catastrophe could be viewed as a scientific possibility.\n\nDon’t expect the whole thing to make a lot of sense in the end — it’s not about logic, and it’s certainly not about happiness.\n\n鉄男\n\n[Tetsuo]\n\naka.
