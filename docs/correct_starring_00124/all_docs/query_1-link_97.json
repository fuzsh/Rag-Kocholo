        "text": "It is with great sadness that Hollywood legend Carl Weathers has passed away at the age of 76. He was a gifted actor who played several iconic roles throughout his career. His most memorable performances were those of Apollo Creed in the first four Rocky movies, Colonel Al Dillon in Predator, and Sgt./Lt. Jericho “Action” Jackson in Action Jackson. He also portrayed Det. Beaudreaux in the TV show Street Justice and a fictionalized version of himself in Arrested Development. Additionally, he lent his voice to Omnitraxus Prime in Star vs. the Forces of Evil. In recent years, he portrayed Greef Karga in the Star Wars series The Mandalorian, for which he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.\n\nA statement released by his family was published by Deadline a day later, on February 2. “We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Carl Weathers,” the statement read. “He died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday, February 1, 2024. Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life. Through his contributions to film, television, the arts, and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.”\n\nMany of Carl Weathers’ peers took to social media in the hours following the sad announcement to express their grief, including retired professional wrestler and actor Jesse Venture, who starred with Weathers in Predator, tweeted:\n\n“We lost an icon. Carl Weathers was a phenomenal talent, a true professional, and a dear friend. All my sympathies and love to his family. I loved working with him on Predator and then celebrating that film with him at various conventions in the ensuing years. Thank you, Carl.”\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump tweeted, “Carl Weathers, an actor best known as Apollo Creed in the Rocky film franchise, has died at 76. His dozens of movie and TV credits have left a lasting mark on American entertainment across generations. His legacy will live on! Rest In Power King!”\n\nDonnie Simpson, a longtime American radio DJ and television and movie personality, tweeted on X, “Sorry to hear that Carl Weathers has died. Of course, he did many things in TV and film, but his role as Apollo Creed made him a household name. He was awesome!! My deepest condolences to his family and friends around the world. RIP!”\n\nSylvester Stallone paid tribute to Carl Weathers following his tragic passing:\n\n“I give him incredible credit because when he walked into that room and saw him for the first time, I saw greatness, but I didn’t realize how great. I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him… Apollo, keep punching.”\n\nOriginally from New Orleans, Carl Weathers was a San Diego State University football star before becoming an actor. He later played in the NFL for the Raiders but only played in eight regular NFL season games before turning his attention to acting in 1974. He started his acting career in blaxploitation cinema with minor roles in Bucktown and Friday Foster.\n\nIn a 2023 interview, Carl Weathers said, “I caught the acting bug, as they say. Being on stage, making people laugh and applauding at the end — it’s pretty infectious. Once that bug gets inside you, it’s hard to give it up.”\n\nCarl Weathers had a significant cultural impact on Hollywood and the entertainment industry. He was a talented actor and a former professional football player, making him a unique and charismatic presence on both the big and small screen. His portrayal of Apollo Creed in the Rocky franchise was groundbreaking, as he became the first African American to play a prominent character in a major Hollywood film. He also played a pivotal role in the hit movie Predator, which became a cult classic and solidified his status as an action star. In addition to his film work, he had notable television roles, including Street Justice and The Mandalorian. His performances and contributions to the entertainment industry will continue to be remembered and celebrated for years.\n\nCarl Weathers leaves a lasting legacy as a talented actor, athlete, and cultural icon. He broke barriers for African American actors in Hollywood and paved the way for future generations. His performances in the Rocky franchise and Predator are regarded as some of the most iconic in action movie history, and his work on television was equally impressive. He was also a devoted family man, partner, and friend who was deeply respected and admired by his peers in the entertainment industry. Carl will be remembered for his contributions to film and television, his impact on the sports world, and his philanthropic endeavors. His legacy will continue to inspire and influence countless people for years.\n\nRest In Power, Carl Weathers! You will be deeply missed, but your legacy as a talented actor will live on. God bless!\n\nBy Shamarie Knight"
