        "text": "#10: Combat Carl\n\n“Toy Story of Terror!” (2013)\n\nCarl Weathers joined the “Toy Story” universe in 2013, playing Combat Carl in the TV movie “Toy Story of Terror!” A Halloween special, it follows the toys as they search for a missing Mr. Potato Head. Combat Carl plays a major role in the special, and it’s incredible how much character work is packed into such a short timeframe. In just twenty minutes, we get a rich backstory, a close emotional bond with Jessie, a possible reference to “Happy Gilmore,” and moments where Combat Carl plays the hero. The character allows Weathers to show his range, not to mention his fantastic talents as a voice actor.\n\n#9: Omnitraxus Prime\n\n“Star vs. the Forces of Evil” (2015-19)\n\nWeathers continued his voice acting talents with “Star vs. the Forces of Evil,” an animated Disney series following the magical princess Star Butterfly. Weathers joined the show in the second season, playing an enormous deity named Omnitraxus Prime. Omnitraxus is the master of spacetime, and at one point helps Star when she becomes trapped in a time loop. But despite his incredible power and fearful appearance, Omnitraxus is quite a friendly fellow, and the character allows Weathers to have some fun in the recording booth. He’s affable and warm, like a comforting grandfather, and we could listen to him speak all day.\n\n#8: Yarbro\n\n“Friday Foster” (1975)\n\nAfter retiring from professional football in 1974, Weathers tried his hand at acting and immediately found work thanks to his friend Arthur Marks. Marks was writing and directing a blaxploitation movie called “Friday Foster,” which was based on the then-popular comic strip. The film stars Pam Grier as the titular Friday, a magazine photographer who becomes embroiled in a racial conspiracy. Weathers plays a henchman named Yarbro, and while it isn’t a huge role, it’s still memorable thanks to his obvious star power. Weathers is stylish, creepy, imposing, and he even gets to fight Yaphet Kotto! Not bad for his first major role.\n\n#7: Adam Beaudreaux\n\n“Street Justice” (1991-93)\n\nWe’d be remiss not to mention “Street Justice,” a crime drama that aired in syndication in the early ‘90s. This was Weathers’s first starring role on television, playing soldier-turned-detective Adam Beaudreaux. Adam is severely wounded while serving in Vietnam but is ultimately saved by Grady Jameson, the young son of some local missionaries. Adam then reunites with an adult Grady, and the two enact some sweet street justice. Weathers is endlessly enjoyable, and the series won an award for its direction at the Chicago International Film Festival. While it has since fallen out of popularity, “Street Justice” is a great bit of early ‘90s TV, and we encourage all Weathers fans to check it out.\n\n#6: Jericho Jackson\n\n“Action Jackson” (1988)\n\nWhile it was trashed by critics, “Action Jackson” proved quite popular with the general public and allowed Weathers to continue his ‘80s dominance. Produced by Joel Silver, “Action Jackson” was influenced by the blaxploitation films of the ‘70s and follows a Detroit police detective who hunts a powerful auto magnate. The movie opened at #3 and went on to gross $65 million against a $7 million budget, making it one of Weathers’s most successful movies. He’s a commanding presence, and while he was often relegated to supporting roles, “Action Jackson” proves that he was more than capable as a leading man.\n\n#5: Greef Karga\n\n“The Mandalorian” (2019-)\n\nOne of Weathers’s final roles was also one of his most iconic. What a great way to finish an unbelievable career. He appears in “The Mandalorian” as Greef Karga, the bounty hunter who kicks the entire storyline into motion. The role was incredibly successful for Weathers, and it gave him a new legion of fans. Greef was only supposed to be in a couple of episodes, but Weathers impressed Jon Favreau so much that he had the role expanded. Weathers also directed several episodes and received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. Funnily enough, he directed himself to the nomination, having personally helmed “Chapter 12: The Siege.”\n\n#4: Chubbs Peterson\n\n“Happy Gilmore” (1996)\n\nWeathers is an icon of the action genre, but one of his most popular characters comes in the form of a goofy Adam Sandler comedy. “Happy Gilmore” is one of those movies that defines the ‘90s, following a violent hockey player who turns to golf and causes problems on the green. Happy is mentored by Chubbs Peterson, a former golfer who was forced to retire after an unfortunate accident. Weathers plays the straight man against Sandler but is still hilarious, often doing everything he can to conceal his rising frustration. He’s also warm and jovial, proving a genuine friend to Happy and helping him appear more professional.\n\n#3: Carl Weathers\n\n“Arrested Development” (2003-06; 2013-19)\n\nIt takes guts to poke fun at yourself. Luckily, Carl Weathers had those guts, and it resulted in what is, no exaggeration, one of the funniest characters in TV history. Weathers plays himself, having been hired by Tobias to serve as his acting coach. However, he doesn’t do much coaching and instead gives Tobias unwanted tips for saving money. Much of the humor comes from Carl’s extreme frugality, and he proves such a cheapskate that he makes Tobias look normal. Weathers pulls it off with unbelievable skill, delivering gut-busting lines with a deadpan expression and serious face. We’ll never make a stew again without thinking of Carl Weathers.\n\n#2: Al Dillon\n\n“Predator” (1987)\n\nIt’s an image that is burned into our collective minds - two hands grasping in brotherly unity, their biceps bulging like mountaintops. This beautiful, unforgettable image comes from “Predator,” which stars Carl Weathers at peak physical form. He plays CIA op Al Dillon, who accompanies Dutch Schaefer on a dangerous rescue mission in the South American jungle. While there, the team is hunted by the titular Predator, and pure ‘80s escapism ensues. Weathers holds his own against other screen icons like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura, and Bill Duke, and he perfectly embodies the machismo action figure of the 1980s.\n\n#1: Apollo Creed\n\n“Rocky” Franchise (1976-)\n\nApollo Creed was Carl Weathers’s most challenging acting job, but he pulled it off with effortless aplomb. Apollo is a very complex character, beautifully written and with many different layers. He’s arrogant and disgustingly pompous, but fun to watch. He’s sympathetic as his envy grows and his spotlight fades. He’s fun and playful as he takes Rock under his wing. Whatever he is, Carl Weathers is portraying it perfectly. He also has the talent to convey deep emotions without saying a single word - in the first film, you can pinpoint the exact moment that Apollo stops having fun and starts taking the fight seriously. It’s a brilliant performance from a brilliant actor, and we’ll miss him dearly.\n\nAre we missing anything? Let us know in the comments below!"
