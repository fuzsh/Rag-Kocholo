        "text": "Carl Weathers, the former professional football player turned actor who played Apollo Creed in the Rocky franchise and also had memorable roles in Predator and Happy Gilmore, has died at the age of 76.\n\n“We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Carl Weathers,” his family said in a statement released on Friday. “He died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday, February 1st, 2024.\n\n“Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life,” the statement continued. “Through his contributions to film, television, the arts and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.”\n\nRelated Video\n\nWeathers was a star defensive end for San Diego State who later played professionally for the Oakland Raiders. He received a masters in theatre arts while in college, and he put his degree to good use once his football career came to an end in 1974.\n\nWeathers appeared in a series of blaxploitation films before landing his breakout role as Apollo Creed in Rocky. Playing Rocky Balboa’s biggest rival turned best friend, Weathers portrayed Creed in four Rocky films between 1976 and 1985.\n\nFollowing news of Weathers’ passing, an emotional Stallone paid tribute to his co-star in a social media video, saying: “He was magic, and I was so fortunate to be part of his life. So, Apollo, keep punching!”\n\nThe success of Rocky earned Weathers starring roles in a number of action films throughout the 1980s, including 1987’s Predator.\n\nLater in his career, Weathers delivered memorable comedic performances as a one-handed golfing legend named Chubbs in Adam Sandler’s Happy Gilmore and as an exaggerated version of himself on Arrested Development.\n\nWeathers’ final major role came as Greef Karga, leader of the Bounty Hunters’ Guild, on Disney+’s The Mandalorian."
