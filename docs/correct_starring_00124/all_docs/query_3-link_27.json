        "text": "Carl Weathers, the actor whose credits include Rocky and Predator, has died at 76.\n\nHis family released a statement through his agent to announce that he died “peacefully in his sleep” on 1 February.\n\n“Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life,” the statement continued. “Through his contributions to film, television, the arts and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner and friend.”\n\nWeathers was best known for playing Apollo Creed alongside Sylvester Stallone in the first four Rocky films. Footage of Weathers was also used in the Creed films led by Michael B Jordan.\n\nAfter becoming a college football star in the 1960s and retiring from a professional career in the early 70s, Weathers began acting in blaxploitation cinema with small roles in Bucktown and Friday Foster.\n\n“I was bitten by the bug, as they say,” Weathers said in 2023. “On stage having people laugh at the good lines and applaud at the end – it’s pretty, pretty infectious. Once that bug gets inside you, it’s kind of hard to give it up.”\n\nHis breakout became in 1976’s Rocky taking on a role initially intended for the real-life boxer Ken Norton. He allegedly got the role after criticising Stallone’s acting in his audition. “Sometimes the mistakes are the ones that get you the gig,” he said in 2015.\n\nIn 2020 he said about playing a boxer: “It was hard to escape taking punches on set. There were times when intentionally we went at each other. I was always concerned that if I hit Sly, threw a punch right, it might hurt. And there was no reason for that. And I think he was pretty much the same way.”\n\nWeathers then took roles in the next three Rocky movies, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987’s Predator and the lead in 1988’s Action Jackson.\n\nSylvester Stallone described Carl Weathers as “an integral part” of his life. On Instagram, Stallone described himself as “torn up” at the news. “Carl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success … I give him incredible credit,” he said. “When he walked into that room and I saw him for the first time, I saw greatness but I didn’t realise how great. I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him. He was absolutely brilliant. Rest in power and keep punching.”\n\nIn a statement, Schwarzenegger wrote: “Carl Weathers will always be a legend. An extraordinary athlete, a fantastic actor, and a great person. We couldn’t have made Predator without him. And we certainly wouldn’t have had such a wonderful time making it. Every minute with him — on set and off — was pure joy. He was the type of friend who pushes you to be your best just to keep up with him. I’ll miss him, and my thoughts are with his family.”\n\nWeathers acted with Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore and went on to appear in Arrested Development as an acting coach and the voice of Combat Carl in Toy Story 4.\n\n“A true great man,” Sandler wrote on X. “Great dad. Great actor. Great athlete. So much fun to be around always. Smart as hell. Loyal as hell. Funny as hell. Loved his sons more than anything. What a guy!! Everyone loved him. My wife and I had the best times with him every time we saw him. Love to his entire family and Carl will always be known as a true legend.”\n\nHis most recent roles included Greef Karga in The Mandalorian which scored him an Emmy nomination for outstanding guest actor in a drama series. He also directed two episodes.\n\n“I’ve loved my time on the show; it has given me an opportunity to be creative in a much more complete way than I had been prior to in other projects,” he said in 2021. “It has been a great experience, and it couldn’t have come at a better time.”\n\nThe show’s creator Jon Favreau said in a statement: “I am heartbroken by this devastating loss. He was a hero from my childhood who I was lucky enough to meet and then had the amazing good fortune to work with. He had the energy and curiosity of a young man paired with the wisdom that his rich life and career afforded him. My heart goes out to his family and countless admirers.”\n\nRobert Rodriguez, who directed episodes of the show featuring Weathers, paid tribute. “Will miss the great Carl Weathers who I was very fortunate to work with on several occasions,” he wrote. “A very kind and generous person. His performances were always electrifying and he was also a terrific director of both stage and screen.”\n\nHe is survived by two sons."
