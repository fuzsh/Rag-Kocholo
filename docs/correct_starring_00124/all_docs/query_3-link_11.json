        "text": "NYFA mourns the loss of Carl Weathers, an acclaimed and accomplished actor, director, and producer. Beginning his career as a standout football player at San Diego State University later playing with the Oakland Raiders, Weathers transitioned to acting after his retirement from football in 1974. Known for his portrayal of Apollo Creed in Rocky and three subsequent Rocky films, Weathers solidified his star power by starring alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger in Predator.\n\nRemembering Actor, Director, and Producer Carl Weathers\n\nWeather appeared in recurring roles on hit television shows, including The Mandalorian, Chicago Justice, Chicago PD, and Chicago Fire, as well as In The Heat of the Night, Street Justice, and Colony. He had notable guest appearances on The Six Million Dollar Man, Starsky and Hutch, Law and Order SVU, Psych, ER, and Arrested Development, where he played a parody of himself.\n\nWeathers had an incredible comedic personality, demonstrated in Happy Gilmore, as well as animated films and television series such as Toy Story 4, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Regular Show, and Eight Crazy Nights. In 2021, his role in The Mandalorian earned him an Emmy nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama. In addition to his acting career, Weathers was a Director and Producer, directing two episodes of The Mandalorian and Chicago Med.

During the conversation, he spoke about his experience writing a screenplay for his one-man show and the lessons he’s learned from his time in Hollywood.\n\n“I don’t think anybody goes in saying I want to do a mediocre work,” Weathers said to the NYFA audience. “Everybody wants they want. You want to do the next Black Panther, you want to do the next Avengers. Something that just blows up in the world, right?”\n\nWe remember Weathers fondly and wish the best for his family, fans, and aspiring filmmakers and actors motivated by his work. As Apollo Creed said, “In the end, you know you’ll be the one standing. You know what you’ve gotta go. Do it. Do it!”"
