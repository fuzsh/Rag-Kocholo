        "text": "NEW YORK -- Carl Weathers, a former NFL linebacker who became a Hollywood action movie and comedy star, playing nemesis-turned-ally Apollo Creed in the \"Rocky\" movies, facing off against Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Predator\" and teaching golf in \"Happy Gilmore,\" has died. He was 76.\n\nMatt Luber, his manager, said Weathers died Thursday. His family issued a statement saying he died \"peacefully in his sleep.\"\n\nComfortable flexing his muscles on the big screen in \"Action Jackson\" as he was joking around on the small screen in such shows as \"Arrested Development,\" Weathers was perhaps most closely associated with Creed, who made his first appearance as the cocky, undisputed heavyweight world champion in 1976's \"Rocky,\" starring Sylvester Stallone.\n\n\"It puts you on the map and makes your career, so to speak. But that's a one-off, so you've got to follow it up with something. Fortunately those movies kept coming, and Apollo Creed became more and more in people's consciousness and welcome in their lives, and it was just the right guy at the right time,\" he told The Daily Beast in 2017.\n\nGrowing up in New Orleans, Weathers started performing in plays as early as grade school. In high school, athletics took him down another path but he would reunite with his first love later in life.\n\nWeathers played college football at San Diego State University -- he majored in theater -- and went on to play for one season in the NFL, for the Oakland Raiders, in 1970.\n\nAfter the Raiders, he joined the Canadian Football League, playing for two years while finishing up his studies during the offseason at San Francisco State University. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1974.\n\nAfter appearing in several films and TV shows, including \"Good Times,\" \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" \"In the Heat of the Night\" and \"Starsky & Hutch,\" as well as fighting Nazis alongside Harrison Ford in \"Force 10 From Navarone,\" Weathers landed his knockout role -- Creed.\n\nCreed memorably died in the ring of 1984's \"Rocky IV,\" going toe-to-toe with the hulking, steroid-using Soviet Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren, inevitably setting up a fight between Drago and Rocky. But while Creed is gone, his character's son, Michael B. Jordan's Adonis Creed, would lead his own boxing trilogy starting in 2015.\n\nLater in life, Weathers developed a passion for directing, helming episodes of \"Silk Stalkings\" and the Lorenzo Lamas vehicle \"Renegade.\" He directed a season three episode of \"The Mandalorian.\"\n\nWeathers introduced himself to another generation when he portrayed himself as an opportunistic and extremely thrifty actor who becomes involved with the dysfunctional clan at the heart of \"Arrested Development.\"\n\nWeathers is survived by two sons."
