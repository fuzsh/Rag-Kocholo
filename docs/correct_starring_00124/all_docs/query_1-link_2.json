        "text": "“ I woke up. Why don't you? You're an asset. An expendable asset. And I used you to get the job done, got it? „ ― Dillon to Dutch\n\nGeorge Dillon was played by Carl Weathers in Predator (film).\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nHe is from the CIA and has the rank of a colonel. He is covertly combating a rebel movement supported by the Russians in ValVerde. He was also a comrade of Dutch and fought with him in Vietnam, but his activities later inside the CIA have made him rusty regarding his former activity. Additionally he is a changed man, who now sees people as assets.\n\nMission in Valverde[]\n\nHe enlists Dutch and his team with the purpose of finding a team of his that was captured by the rebels and, secretly, find a team of his lead by Hopper to rescue them, a team that disappeared, and kill Russian advisors too, who are planning an invasion with the guerillas. He tricks Dutch for this mission knowing he wouldn´t accept it by making him believe he is there to save people, among them a minister.\n\nThey find Hopper and his team skinned alive. In retribution they kill the rebels later, while watching Dillon's men die. When he finds the Russian advisors with them, Dutch realises he was tricked into doing this and is angry with Dillon because of it. Still they go away from there afterwards as fast as possible because of coming rebel activity there.\n\nThe Predator´s appearance[]\n\nThis trick causes problems between him and the others, but they are forgotten, when they realise they are being hunted down by someone, who is butchering them like Hopper´s team. He is the last to believe that the creature hunting them is an alien, when it begins to kill Dutch's team despite of evidence that supports it. Still, he grudgingly helps Dutch´s attempts to stop it. He believes differently when he sees it decloaking and cloaking in front of his own eyes after a failed attempt to get it.\n\nShowdown with the Predator and death[]\n\nHe later tries to kill it and save what is left of Dutch and his team as penance for what he did and to avenge Hopper's death. He goes after it with Mac, a member of Dutch´s team, who wants to avenge Cooper's death.\n\nThey both find him and set up a trap for him. The Predator, however sees through it and he is killed by the creature in the attempt to kill it together with Mac, who dies first.\n\nCasting[]\n\nCarl Weathers was always the first choice to play Dillon."
