He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.”\n\nThe Mandalorian‘s Giancarlo Esposito, who portrays Moff Gideon in the series, also paid tribute to his friend and former castmate on Instagram.\n\n“I will sorely miss my dear friend and brother Carl Weathers,” Esposito wrote alongside a photo of the two. “You are truly one of the most wonderful human beings I have had the honor and pleasure of spending time with! I am grateful for your influence and support of all things good in my life. This is how I will always remember you. My dear friend and brother.”\n\nWeathers played Greef Karga, the head of the Bounty Hunters Guild, in nine episodes of the Disney+ Star Wars series The Mandalorian over its three seasons. The character became close to Pedro Pascal’s Mando as the series progressed. Weathers was a 2021 Emmy nominee for the role and also directed a pair of episodes in Season 2 and 3.\n\nRELATED: Adam Sandler Remembers Carl Weathers: ‘Happy Gilmore’ Co-Star Was “A True Legend”\n\nLast month, Lucasfilm confirmed a Mandalorian feature film, The Mandalorian & Grogu, was in the works, with series creator Jon Favreau to direct.

He appeared in four episodes across the Emmy-winning series’ first four seasons.\n\nRELATED: Hollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries\n\nWeathers also had a rising career as a TV director.
