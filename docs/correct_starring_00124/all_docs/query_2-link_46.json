Many of the films include jpegs of original reviews, advertisements and photographs showing journalists in action.\n\nIn Part Two: 1920-1929, a total of 1,514 films with each character and event identified and all of the table information encoded, were annotated and put into ten more appendices -- Appendix 12, 1920 (753 pages); Appendix 13, 1921 (702 pages); Appendix 14, 1922 789 pages); Appendix 15, 1923 (689 pages); Appendix 16, 1924 (538 pages); Appendix 17, 1925 (605 pages); Appendix 18, 1926 (573 pages); Appendix 19, 1927 (573 pages); Appendix 20, 1928 (620 pages); Appendix 21, 1929 (576 pages). Many of the films include jpegs of original reviews, advertisements and photographs showing journalists in action. In the endnotes, future researchers can also find a complete list of films dealing with specific journalists, such as cub reporters, female reporters or pack journalists.\n\nThis first comprehensive study is an analysis of of the beginning of cinema’s earliest depictions of the journalist, mostly newspaper reporters, editors and publishers. The articleas summarize the results of the study by decade, genre, gender, ethnicity, media category, job title, and the description of the journalist’s professional and personality traits. The discussion segment reviews the films in the context of specific kinds of journalists: male reporters, war correspondents, female reporters, columnists, cub reporters, editors, critics, cartoonists and illustrators, photojournalists and newsreel shooters, pack journalists, printers and other news employees, and publishers, owners and media barons. There are also sections dealing with the journalism as depicted in the early years of the silent films: romance in the newsroom; poverty, honesty and morality: newsboys and office boys; the importance of the newspapers in silent film and the unidentified news staff; depiction of journalism in silent films as analyzed by real journalists, and journalism and the new motion picture industry.\n\nIn addition to the major articles, there are 21 appendices that chronicle each of the 3,462 films by including the original reviews of the film in a variety of silent film periodicals. Most of the silent films included in the study were not available for viewing; They are either considered lost, whereabouts unknown or in special collections throughout the world. Most of the research relied on reviews in the many silent film periodicals that populated the early years of the 20th century.\n\nIn addition, there is now available The Image of the Journalist in Silent Film, 1890 to 1919, a 6:37:00 compilation with excepts from 56 movies tracing the origins of the image of the journalist in motion pictures and Part A: The Image of the Journalist in Silent Film, 1920-1929, a 11:45:00 compilation with excerpts from 79 movies and Part B: Celebrity Journalists, Newsboys, the Newspaper in Silent Films, Newsreels, 1920-1929, a 4:30:30 compilation with excerpts from 71 movies.\n\nA special two-hour video of six silent films that sums up the image of the journalist in silent film is also available.\n\nThe Future of the Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture\n\nWhen Howard Good (professor of journalism at SUNY, New Paltz) sent the editors of The IJPC Journal an essay on the future of the image of the journalist in popular culture, he posed an important question: what will that future be like? As Good writes, the image of the journalist “is, like the institution of journalism itself, in crisis. In fact, the image is in crisis because journalism is.” His conclusion that “it seems the journalist may have only a limited future as a figure in the panorama of popular culture” was a subject that we felt could benefit from further exploration.\n\nSo the editors decided to ask four prominent scholars to write their own predictions of what the future of the image of the journalist might be. They are Maurine Beasley, professor emerita of journalism at the University of Maryland College Park; Bonnie Brennen, professor emerita of journalism at Marquette University; Henry Jenkins, provost professor of communication, journalism, cinematic arts and education at the University of Southern California; and Paulette D. Kilmer, professor of communication at the University of Toledo. Some of the authors disagreed with Good, while others used his essay as a starting point for their own perspectives. The result is five essays that explore what the image of the journalist in popular culture may look like as the twenty-first century continues into an unknown future.\n\nThe essays are available in The IJPC Journal, Volume 9, Fall 2020 to Spring 2021\n\nThe 21st Century Image of the Journalist in Hallmark Films, 2000-2020\n\nThe landmark study, The 21st Century Image of the Journalist in Hallmark Films, 2000-2020 has been published in Volume 9 of the IJPC Journal.\n\nThe two-year study is included along with seven alphabetical appendices annotating each of the 360 films studied by gender, ethnicity, media category, job title, and description of major and minor characters plus still frames from the films featuring journalists.\n\nA number of surprises emerged in this first analysis of the 21st-century image of the journalist in Hallmark films.\n\nThe great majority of journalists depicted in 360 films were positive images and since a majority of Hallmark viewers get their concept of a journalist from news organizations and social media friendly to their belief system, these images contradicted most of what they have been told about mainstream newsgatherers.\n\nA large portion of the major characters were strong females and while White journalists made up the majority depicted, Black and Asian characters showed up in more frequent numbers than comparative films and TV programs featuring journalists. They were also as powerful and positive as their White counterparts. Hispanics, however, were disproportionally underrepresented.\n\nThe negative journalists – usually paparazzi and tabloid journalists – were usually minor characters found in mystery series and were either murdered, sent to prison, or tried to redeem themselves at the end of the film.\n\nSaltzman discovered that journalists’ depictions in those films are largely positive. That in turn contradicts what many Hallmark viewers (who tend to be socially and politically conservative) likely have been told about the so-called “mainstream media.”\n\nFinally, Joe Saltzman presents the first analysis of the image of the journalist in Hallmark films: that is, films airing on the television channels owned by the well-known greeting card company. Saltzman discovered that journalists’ depictions in those films are largely positive. That in turn contradicts what many Hallmark viewers (who tend to be socially and politically conservative) likely have been told about the so-called “mainstream media.”\n\nThe Heroes and Scoundrels Journalist in Popular Culture Project\n\nThe Heroes and Scoundrels Journalist in Popular Culture Project includes:\n\nHeroes and Scoundrels: The Image of the Journalist in Popular Culture by Matthew C.

The female journalist faces an ongoing dilemma: How to incorporate the masculine traits of journalism essential for success – being aggressive, self-reliant, curious, tough, ambitious, cynical, cocky, unsympathetic – while still being the woman society would like her to be – compassionate, caring, loving, maternal, sympathetic. Female reporters and editors in fiction have fought to overcome this central contradiction throughout the 20th century and are still fighting the battle today.\n\nUpdated: 5-2010\n\nAdditional Info »\n\nThe Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Popular Culture\n\nA special research report on “The Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Movies and Television 1901-2011” is featured in a special edition of The IJPC Journal (Volume 3, Fall 2011-Spring 2012) on public relations and popular culture. As the report’s introduction notes, it is the most ambitious study of its kind, analyzing the depiction of the PR practitioner in more than 300 movies and television programs over the past century. The report and its appendix find that popular culture’s portrayal of public relations professionals has been similar to that of news journalists in that it has varied widely over the years and has not always been so negative as some real-life professionals fear.\n\nA companion piece to the study is the 2011 IJPC Associates video:The Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Movies and Television, 1901 to 2011, 11:46:05 video compilation with 326 movie and television clips tracing the history of the public relations practitioner in the 20th and 21st centuries is now available to all new and sustaining IJPC Associates.\n\nThe Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Movies and TV\n\n1901 to 1959– 113 clips – 3:41:07\n\nThe Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Movies and TV\n\n1960 to 1996 – 120 clips – 4:02:49\n\nThe Image of the Public Relations Practitioner in Movies and TV\n\n1997 to 2011 – 93 clips – 4:02:39\n\nThe nearly 12-hour-plus video is invaluable for research into this new academic field and for teaching a class in the image of the public relations practitioner in popular culture.\n\nA Special Preview of the public relations video compilation running 13:30 and containing 64 clips is now available to all IJPC members.\n\nAlso included on the IJPC Website:\n\nA complete description of every film and television show included with selected photographs.\n\nNearly 1,300 entries in the IJPC Database feature public relations practitioners and publicity.\n\nA section on Public Relations research is included in the Resources section.\n\nClassroom lesson plans\n\nAdditional Info »\n\nTHE IMAGE OF THE GAY JOURNALIST IN POPULAR CULTURE\n\nThe IJPC Project is spearheading research on the image of the gay journalist in popular culture.\n\nThere has been virtually no research done in this field.
