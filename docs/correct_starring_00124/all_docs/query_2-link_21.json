        "text": "My first work experience was as an entrepreneur. Barely a teenager, I cut grass throughout my neighborhood. Business was great. I actually paid my mother to drive me to distant neighborhoods to serve more customers. I dreamed of being a millionaire by 21.\n\nAll of this ended when the Army transferred my father (and family) to Europe. I often think now, as I see numerous lawn companies with trucks and machinery driving around, what might have been had we not moved.\n\nWhen we returned, I got a more traditional job. I became a movie theater usher. One responsibility was to go into the theater periodically to make sure folks weren‚Äôt talking, or smoking (yes, that happened). It was natural to linger and watch a few minutes of the movie.\n\nRocky was a big hit when I started and it played continuously. Catching a few minutes throughout an eight-hour shift daily meant I learned the dialogue, became familiar with Philadelphia (where the story is set), and forever saw the actors as these characters.\n\nTalia Shire was no longer Micheal Corleone‚Äôs sister from the Godfather, she was Rocky‚Äôs love interest Andrian. Burgess Meredith wasn‚Äôt the Penguin on the old Batman tv show, he was Mickey. Carl Weathers became Apollo Creed forever ‚Äì as in ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs Apollo Creed doing with Arnold hunting the Predator?‚Äù\n\nBurt Young played Andrian‚Äôs brother Paulie. I had seen him in other movies but didn‚Äôt know much about him until I read about his passing last month and studied his obituary.\n\nBesides his acting accomplishments, I learned that Young had joined the Marines when he as 16 by lying about his age and with his father‚Äôs help. Ironically, in service he regularly boxed, winning 32 of 34 fights.\n\nAs a new Veteran, he bounced from job to job until he turned to acting. He told friends he turned to acting to impress a young lady friend. He was accepted into a prestigious training program and eventually appeared in more than 150 movies.\n\nIt was sad to see that another of my movie Rocky family had left us, but I was not surprised to learn he was a Marine. I like to think this influenced his portrayal of Paulie ‚Äì tough but trying to do the right thing. I will remember this when I watch the movie again and think of him on November 10th, when we celebrate the birthday of the Marine Corps!\n\nMy tops posts from last month are divided into these categories:\n\n1. Getting a Job\n\nHope White invites those interested in a career with the federal government to a presentation on the hiring process each Saturday in November.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/posts/hopefulspeaking_army-airforce-marines-activity-7124069832894910464-Ck7d?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop\n\nSadly, the federal government hiring process is complicated, but not impossible. Like much in life, it takes some effort to understand and navigate. You‚Äôll get this is just two hours from Hope. Many Veterans, still compelled by the mission and the desire to help other Veterans, pursue opportunities at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/department-of-veterans-affairs/\n\nHope ‚Äì do you have a special discussion about getting a job at the VA during your presentation?\n\n‚ú¨Matthew‚ú¨ Langseth‚ú¨ provided a list of opportunities in Tucson, AZ: See here.\n\nI still have found memories of living there as kid while my father taught ROTC at the University of Arizona.\n\nThe area features great weather, outdoor activities, and interesting sites such as the Aircraft Boneyard and Old Tucson.\n\nBoots to Books announced a hiring fair.\n\nIt features top companies, interesting keynote speaker, and scholarship opportunities for professional certifications. As you think about differentiation in the job market or at promotion time, check out a professional certification.\n\n2. How to Think About Getting a Job\n\nEric Horton presented an interesting Transition Hack about the Workforce.\n\nHe covers a lot of ground in the post, including the attractiveness of Tennessee for Veterans. Importantly, he also presents a five-step checklist for companies to determine why they need Veteran employees.\n\nACT Now Education presented a multi-part series on Winning an Interview. Here is Part 1.\n\nEven if you already have a great job, check out their interviewing tips. Interviewing skills are something everyone can improve.\n\n3. Let‚Äôs Hear it for Entrepreneurs\n\nCarrie C. provided valuable advice to those thinking about opening a business.\n\nVeteran entrepreneurs naturally focus what inspires them to want to run their own business ‚Äì the challenge, the problem and solution, the product or service, and the excitement. Carrie points out many of the behind the scenes items to think about ‚Äì your lawyer, accountant, bank and other associations. For Veteran entrepreneurs, it's not one or the other ‚Äì it‚Äôs both.\n\nErica Mannes recognized Military Spouse entrepreneurs in this post.\n\nThese companies conduct business, and also hire Military Spouses. Check out her top 10 list and see if one of these companies could meet a current need for your company or you personally.\n\n4. Education Insights\n\nMike Brown described interviewing Veteran alumni for the Voices of Villanova‚Äôs Veterans project.\n\nIf this isn‚Äôt a best practice for all university‚Äôs that want to be Veteran friendly, it should be. Too often schools pay lip service to alumni, unless it‚Äôs time to raise money. Great job on their part for engaging their Veteran alumni. The post also contains a link to an article about the program.\n\nSamantha Gassman shared insights into her personal education journey and how it related to her current position.\n\nNear the end of her post she makes a powerful observation about wishing she had used her GI Bill once she knew what she wanted to do. While hindsight is 20-20, this is great advice to all those thinking about using this benefit. Saving it for later ‚Äì graduate school or other advanced training ‚Äì often makes more sense than using it early, when your path is less clear.\n\n5. Valuable Resources\n\nMarina üå∏ Rabinek provided a strong list of books and podcasts with information for the Military and Veteran community.\n\nTake a look at her list. I bet you didn‚Äôt know them all. Also, if you have a good resource, send her DM so she can include it in a future list. Thanks also for including my book ‚Äì Veterans Benefits for You ‚Äì in your list. I continue to get notes from those who are giving a copy as a gift to an older Veterans in their life.\n\nHireMilitary put out its list of 10 can‚Äôt miss resources for your transition.\n\nA common feature of these resources is one-on-one attention and mentorship. If you‚Äôve successfully transitioned, save this list and share it with service member friends who are 18 months out from exiting so they get a head start. Thanks for including my book!\n\n6. Can‚Äôt We Do Better\n\nCorey Henderson shared a post describing the trend of service members receiving approval not to attend TAP.\n\nHis post contains an article that explains this in more detail. It also received tremendous engagement as folks debated what this trend really means. One prominent view in the comments was disappointment that the services weren‚Äôt sending their soon to be Veterans to receive this value information. The second was the classes weren‚Äôt that helpful and, therefore, missing them wasn‚Äôt that meaningful as nonprofits and others provide more relevant transition information.\n\nEither way, significant non-participation in TAP is a warning sign that we need to do better for exiting service members. I trust that those commenting are sending ideas to members of Congress on the House Veterans Affairs Committee who have been holding hearings on TAP.\n\nElizabeth OBrien described convening a group to think about the next phase of Skillbridge.\n\nWhile Skillbridge is clearly a success, the need for more careful screening of employers and transparency is being discussed. No doubt there are other opportunities for improvement. If you feel strongly about this, share your thoughts with Elizabeth and the other leaders called out in her post.\n\n7. See You There!\n\nYour Next Mission¬Æ reminded us of the Career in the Data Center Industry event on November 7th in the DMZ.\n\nThis industry is growing and has significant opportunities for Veterans and Military Spouses. There will be networking and a Show Floor where you can see cutting-edge technologies and innovations firsthand.\n\nI appreciate the shoutout as I will be a speaker, along with Jack Tilley and Lee Kirby:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/leekirby-datacenterservices-veteransprograms/\n\nStop by if you‚Äôre not too busy interviewing for a better job.\n\n8. Kudos\n\nTo Seth Eisenberg for being recognized among Ocean Drive‚Äôs 2023 Inspiring Business Leaders in Florida.\n\nAs the attached story points out ‚ÄúBy following their journeys and heeding their advice, you‚Äôll gain invaluable insights, practical strategies, and motivation needed to fuel your own success story.‚Äù\n\nThe others are lawyers, medical professionals, investment bankers and the like. Seth was recognized for his service to Veterans.\n\n9. Quick Takes\n\nDuring October, I spoke with these interesting Veteran Thought Leaders. William C. Gray discussed the challenges facing military recruiting.\n\nWe talked directly about whether we need to return to the Draft. He also shared his thoughts, as a former Marine recruiter, on what can be done to improve recruiting.\n\nS. Jamie Gayton PhD and I discussed credit scores.\n\nHe explained their importance and the five factors used to develop your score. His explanation is brief and clear and I recommend you share it with those in your life who are interested in improving their financial skills.\n\nSeth Eisenberg and I spoke with me about the power of words.\n\nIn particular, we focused on getting homeless Veterans into homes and reintegrating into the community instead of merely getting them housed. As he made clear in his remarks at recent conference, there are songs written about homes but not about housing. I hope those who work with our homeless Veterans share this perspective.\n\nJames Gfrerer described Veteran-focused observations from attending a recent healthcare conference.\n\nInteresting points about community care, duplicative tests, and pending technologies that can help medical professionals serve Veterans better.\n\nJerry Quinn detailed the difference between financial independence and financial wellness.\n\nWe talked candidly about the challenge of savings and he offered tips based on his experience. Again, great financial information to share with your buddy who is always short at the end of the month.\n\nRobyn J. Grable talked about a difference approach to translating military skills to the civilian world.\n\nShe advocates for companies to search for skills and match their needs with service members who list and describe their skills. She described how this changes resume development, the interview process, and the speed to hire.\n\nSheila Harmeyer talked to me about recent developments she is seeing while hiring from the Military and Veteran community.\n\nShe points out that storytelling during an interview can allow the hiring manager to better see the connection between individual‚Äôs skills and experiences and the company needs.\n\nPaul Lawrence"
