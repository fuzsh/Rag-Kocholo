        "text": "Pink Floyd’s rock opera The Wall is a bad trip, quite literally since it was partly inspired by the mental illness of Syd Barrett, an early member of the band who almost certainly experimented with LSD in the late 1960s. For members of Generation X, people born between 1965 and 1980, whether or not they took drugs, the whole post-war era might as well have been one big illusion inspired by a bad batch of acid. Our parents and grandparents, we were told, fought the Second World War, an epic battle of good versus evil where the “greatest generation” defeated the Nazis on the beaches of Normandy and in the Battle of the Bulge. But it was never explained to us why we then fell into a decades long nuclear stalemate with the Soviet Union, or that Joseph Stalin, who was supposedly worse than Hitler, was our ally in the fight against Hitler, or that the supposedly evil Red Army actually did the bulk of the fighting.\n\nSometime in the early 1960s, right before most of us were born, history changed for the better. Black people in the South won the right to vote. Elvis Presley and the Beatles invented a new form of music. Everybody suddenly started having sex, and the younger generation turned away from the military industrial complex President Eisenhower warned us about, and finally got us out of the war in Vietnam by levitating the Pentagon and smoking marijuana at Woodstock. Yet somehow as most of us entered our teens in the 1980s, a right-wing cold warrior named Ronald Reagan occupied the White House. Racism was getting worse. The world was still five minutes away from a nuclear Holocaust and everybody who ever had sex in the 1970s was dying of a mysterious new illness called AIDS. Well at least gay men were. The utopian dream of the 1960s wasn’t exactly over, but it had clearly gone insane, and joined the Republican Party. Rock n Roll, the new type of music invented by Elvis and the Beatles, had already been declared “dead,” but it was still the only thing anybody took seriously. Being a “rock star” was not only a sure fire way of “getting laid,” it was also the best path out of the working class into wealth and fame. In 1984, Reagan was reelected in the largest landslide in Presidential history, mostly on the promise that he would build a magical protective shield popularly known as “Star Wars,” an elaborate screen of lasers and guided missiles that would prevent us all from dying in the nuclear war that almost seemed inevitable. The Russians of course were still evil.\n\nBy 1982, The Wall, which had become one of the best selling rock albums of all time, had inspired a movie of the same name. Directed by Alan Parker and starring Boomtown Rats lead singer Bob Geldof. The Wall dramatized the mind fuck we had all been going through since the 1960s ended and all we got were AIDS and Ronald Reagan. Geldof plays “Pink,” a rock musician based on the above mentioned Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd’s lead singer and songwriter Roger Waters. The film opens with Pink lying miserably in his bed in an expensive but grim hotel room thinking about what happened to his father. Waters’ own father Eric Fletcher Waters, a former communist activist and conscientious objector, had been killed at age 30 at the Battle of Anzio, that horrifically mismanaged invasion of Italy that served as the dry run for the invasion of Normandy. After catching Hitler by surprise, and landing an army just south of Rome, instead of breaking out of his beachhead cutting off the German 10th Army, American general Mark Clark sat on the beach for days while the German high command brought in reinforcements. Eric Fletcher Waters’ unit was caught in a counterattack by heavy German armor.\n\n“There was frost in the ground,” Pink cries out in despair, “when the tigers broke free and no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company Z. They were all left behind, most of them dead, the rest of them dying, and that’s how the High Command, took my daddy from me.”\n\nRaised by a single mother, and without the protection of his father, Pink is flushed through a British educational system run by teachers and administrators so grotesque and authoritarian that you wonder why his father had given his life fighting the Nazis at all. Bright eyed innocent children go in at one end full of life, and come out wearing death masks. As Roger Waters wrote about his former bandmate Syd Barrett in his song Shine On You Crazy Diamond, “remember when you were young, you shone like the sun. Now there’s a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.” Like Roger Waters, Pink survives the British educational system, but like Syd Barrett after his experience with psychedelic drugs, his soul is profoundly damaged. What makes The Wall so revealing about the Cold War world of 1982 is how effectively it interweaves the various strands of crude authoritarianism and hedonistic decadence, of idealism and lost idealism, of ugly reaction and the cynical commodification of the utopian dream, of rebellion and repression.\n\nIndeed, The Wall was initially inspired by Waters’ disgust with his own fans and his urge to build a wall in front of the stage during his concerts. At times it’s difficult to know who is who. Out of control school children become out of control fans become soldiers under attack become sadistic riot police. A dark, repressive energy seems to take control of any group of people, however different they may be, once they form a crowd. A great live performer like Bruce Springsteen will feed off the energy of his audience, reflect it back transformed by his own artistic imagination. Pink, like Waters, once had that same ability, but, like Waters, he’s lost it. Where once he saw his fans as bright eyed children full of life, they now seem to be the walking dead with masks and eyes like black clouds. The dream of the 1960s has turned into the nightmare of the 1980s.\n\nThe sexual revolution has undergone the same dark transformation. Pink has more than enough ability to attract women — he’s a rock star after all — but his sex drive is dead. He ignored his wife, blocking her out of his life, building a wall between them so high she just said fuck it and started cheating on him. A beautiful, innocent, yet corrupted American groupie he brings back to his apartment fares little better. Obsessed with watching the classic British war movie Dam Busters on TV, Pink can’t even make a token attempt to engage the woman in conversation, or even tell her where the kitchen is so she can get a glass of water. Casual sex, for Pink, brings the same danger of connection to an other human being that marriage does. The closer the young American woman tries to get to him, the higher he builds his wall, lost in the fantasy of a classic war movie which was, not incidentally, an inspiration for Star Wars, and the memories of his father at Anzio. Finally, in a violent outburst that had almost become a cliché in the 1970s and 1980s, a rock star trashing his hotel room, he picks up the TV and throws it out the window. The groupie runs away in terror.\n\nOne of the biggest mindfucks of the mid-1980s was seeing Ronald Reagan go to Omaha Beach in Normandy for the 40th Anniversary of D-Day. There he gave a banal Peggy Noonan speech about the Boys of Pointe Du Hoc who liberated Europe from fascism. But then just the next year, in 1985, he planned a visit to a Waffen SS cemetery in Bitburg Germany. In a speech written by Pat Buchanan, he declared that anybody who served in the Waffen SS was as much a victim as someone who died in the Holocaust. What the fuck was going on? Did “we” fight the Nazis? Or were we the Nazis? Needless to say the media didn’t dig too deeply into the question. They declared the plan to visit Bitburg a “mistake” but continued to fawn over Peggy Noonan’s The Boys of Pointe Du Hoc speech at Normandy.\n\nThe Wall confronts this contradiction head on. After Pink trashes his hotel room, and destroys his TV, he goes into the shower and begins to mutilate himself, a blood ritual that eventually transforms him into a parody of Adolf Hitler. He comes out of the shower, no longer confused, or even tormented, but wearing his own special variety of death mask, not a broken man like Syd Barrett, or a cynical, disillusioned, “comfortably numb” man like Waters, but a cult leader and dictator who has sensed the dark violent energy of his fans, and now plans to lead it down a darker, more violent road yet, the second coming of Kristallnacht, a violent riot against racial minorities and other “undesirables.” What Roger Waters’ and Pink’s father died fighting against, Pink has become. The final scenes, alternating between animated marching hammers and Pink on stage, a Hitler figured saluted by his fans with raised arms. Sieg Heil, complete Pink’s spiritual destruction, giving us some insight into why perhaps Syd Barrett quit the music business. Did he lose his mind on bad acid? Or did he see deeply into the fascist undercurrent lurking beneath the utopian dream of the 1960s, and decide he wanted no part of it?\n\nRoger Waters, who continues to perform The Wall live, even at the age of 80, has not sold out to the establishment. Quite the contrary, a leftist who supports the Palestinians, and opposes the war in Ukraine, he has been continuously smeared by the Israel Lobby and the corporate media as an “anti-Semite.” The German police have even arrested him for wearing the same costume that Bob Geldof wears at the end of the film, charging him with promoting fascism instead of dramatizing it. Germans, of course, are famous for being humorless and rather thick, but there is perhaps something more to the whole thing than an AIPAC smear campaign. While Syd Barrett retreated into mental illness and social isolation, Roger Waters has embraced the contradictions between fascism and anti-fascism, utopia and dystopia, the dissolution of the individual into the violent energy of the mob and the man who builds a wall between himself and the mob. He has embraced those contradictions in order to stage them, put his own dark side on stage so that he can reflect back onto his audience their own dark side.\n\nThe Wall ends on, perhaps, a hopeful note. Pink imagines himself as a child, perhaps during the Blitz, perhaps during an imaginative recreation of the Blitz. They are cleaning up rubble, loading broken rocks into toy trucks. It’s not much, Waters seems to say, but it is something. The children are not wearing death masks. They have no brutal fascist teachers lording it over them. On the contrary, their labor is self-directed, earnest, communal. Perhaps, Waters is telling us, the generation that will come after his will clean up his generation’s mess. Then again, we didn’t.\n\nBack in the 1980s when I was an undergraduate at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, I was probably what the Millennial generation would call an “incel.” I had a genuinely rotten childhood. My mother couldn’t stand me. I graduated from one of the worst public high-schools in the state of New Jersey, and to be quite honest I was just a little afraid of girls. Most of the girls I knew in high school bullied me because I didn’t smoke pot or wear heavy metal T-shirts. My brother would spread rumors behind my back that I was gay.\n\nBetween the ages of 18 and 22, I spent most of my time in the Alexander Library on College Avenue, alone, in a metal stall, reading. My only companion was a homeless man, a 1970 graduate who had taken too many drugs during the 1960s to have gotten on any kind of a career path, and subsequently never left the campus. When it got cold, he would take shelter in the University media lab, watching French New Wave movies, and researching the Kennedy assassination. Occasionally he would come over and strike up a conversation.\n\n“Do you see this?” he said, pointing to a copy of Paris Match and a review of the Richard Gere movie Breathless. “Do you see this?”\n\n“I haven’t seen it yet,” I said, “but I’m hoping to watch it when they have it at Blockbuster Video.”\n\n“Don’t watch that crap,” he said. “See the original. Only see the original.”\n\n“There was an original?” I said. “Is there a book?”\n\n“No there isn’t a book,” he said. “Do you know the Zionists shot JFK,” he added before I could tear myself away. “Fucking de Gaulle was going to give them the bomb and Kennedy was going to stop it. So they sent the Mossad.”\n\n“Look,” I said. “I agree that there’s always been something a little suspicious about the Warren Commission but I’m going to follow you down this path. I’m not a Nazi and I’m not an anti-Semite and I’m not going to scapegoat the Jews.”\n\n“I bet you don’t know what Jack Ruby’s real name was, right?” he said, looking intently into my eyes, and shaking my chair. “Oh you don’t. Well color me surprised. Take a guess. It will seem obvious once I tell you. Ever hear of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission? Do the names Kissinger and Brzezinski ring a bell? Do some research. Think. Don’t just scapegoat the CIA like everybody else does. Go research the Lavon Affair. Use your head. Don’t be an unthinking fucking liberal.”\n\nOne day in my junior year, everything changed. I was sitting in Brower Commons, the University Dining Hall, alone with a copy of The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe, when I suddenly noticed I was surrounded by sorority girls, which was odd considering how I usually sat far off in the corner underneath the entrance ramp behind the tables used by the black frats. But it was unmistakable. It felt a bit like that scene at the schoolyard from The Birds by Hitchcock. Every few minutes I would look up and see another willowy blond beauty sit down at the table with her tray and begin eating. Even stranger, I noticed that when I looked up and down the table one or two of them would try to catch my eye. Finally a girl sat down next to me and tried to strike up a conversation. “Good book,” she said, except for the happy ending. I like my literature a bit darker.” Of course I didn’t say a word back, being so terrified that I could barely stop myself from running away but it didn’t matter. The next day the same thing happened. I was surrounded by beautiful woman. What the hell was going on?\n\nFinally, after one of the girls pushed a flier in my direction inviting me to the Annual Greek Blood Drive and Christmas Party, I figured it out. “You are coming, aren’t you Jonathan?” she said before handing me another pile of fliers. “We really need your help to get the word out.” As terrified as I was of engaging in conversation with a member of the opposite sex, I managed to to elicit from her the information that a young man named Jonathan Daimlerhoff had just been elected President of the Fraternity Council, that he was a popular and charming young man with a large trust fund and a late model German car who frequently took ski trips in Vermont and threw off campus parties where large amounts of alcohol were available to people of all ages, and where the cops never harassed people since Mr. Daimlerhoff’s father was a prominent lawyer no policeman would dare cross by arresting any of his son’s guests. I also learned that I was his spitting image, that we resembled each other so much that even the cheap ugly clothes my mother got me from K-Mart didn’t clue people in that I was Stanley the Incel Rogouski and not Jonathan the Chad Daimlerhoff. I never found out the young woman’s name but she answered my questions so politely that I briefly overcame my fear of women. She even invited me to the Christmas Party to give blood. I declined.\n\nSo why have I begun a film review with such a long autobiographical digression?\n\nIn 1946, William Wyler released The Best Years of Our Lives, a film that not only won Best Picture, but became an immediate classic, widely considered to be one of the greatest American movies ever made. Starring well-known Hollywood stars like Dana Andrews, Virginia Mayo, Frederick March, Myrna Loy, Virginia Wright, and non-professional actor Harold Russell, the film told the story of three American veterans of World War II, and their struggles to reintegrate themselves into civilian life. For March, who plays Sergeant Al Stephenson, it all goes fairly smoothly. Even though he served as an enlisted man in the infantry, he has inherited money, a good education, and a position as Vice President of a local bank. He soon establishes himself as a socially concerned progressive willing to extend credit to fellow veterans even though they may lack sufficient collateral. For Harold Russell, who plays Homer Parrish, a gravely wounded sailor who lost both his arms when a Japanese Kamikaze hit the aircraft carrier he was serving on, the challenges are far more severe. Yet he still has the advantage of a solid middle class family and a fiancée willing to stay with him even with his horrible disability. Then there’s Captain Fred Derry, an army air force veteran, and the film’s main protagonist.\n\nWhen we first meet Fred Derry he seems to have everything going for him. At 37, Dana Andrews was probably a bit too old to play the role of a young man who was at most in his mid-20s, but it’s easy to see why he was cast. Having already starred in the 1944 film The Purple Heart, where he played a bomber commander shot down over Japan during the Doolittle Raid who marched off to his execution by slow torture spitting defiance and patriotic fervor at his Japanese captors, Andrews was exactly the image most Americans had in their minds when they heard the phrase “war hero.” Andrews was of average height and build and not particularly handsome, but something about the way he carried himself makes you want to stand up and salute. Unlike the almost comically gigantic, macho John Wayne, Andrews came off like the kind of American everyman who rose to the occasion after Pearl Harbor and bravely volunteered to fight Hitler and the Nazis. When we first meet Derry, Parrish, and Stephenson, who immediately become friends on the trip back home to fictional Boone City (Cincinnati Ohio) Derry comes across as their leader, a commanding presence in his captain’s bars and collection of ribbons and medals.\n\nOnce back in Boone City, however, we realize that Derry is not all he seems to be. First of all, he’s homeless. Born into a lower working class family beaten down by the Great Depression, his parents live in a shack near the railroad. His mother is a sad, timid woman whose very manner seems to apologize for her existence. It’s early morning and his father is already drunk. Derry has no education. Immediately after graduating from high school, he got a job as a low wage “soda jerk” at a local drug store and stayed there for two years, unable to rise to anything but head clerk with a mousy little assistant he nicknames “stinky.” Probably born in 1921 or 1922, Fred Derry was still in grade school when the Great Depression hit and his formative years were spent in a country filled with poverty and despair. The New Deal and Franklin Roosevelt had made some progress in putting the economy back together but after the Republicans demanded more austerity and the Supreme Court ruled the NRA as unconstitutional, the country slid back down into a recession in 1936.\n\nThen a miracle happened. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the American economy roared back to life and to heights nobody had previously imagined. During World War II the United States was effectively a socialist country with a planned economy, full employment, and a socially progressive President who backed down in the face of a potential general strike led by black leaders like A. Phillip Randolph and opened up jobs in the defense industry to women and racial minorities. People who had previously been unable to use their talents or enter the American mainstream suddenly found themselves gainfully employed, with hopes for the future and dreams of a better life. Fred Derry, an athletic young man with real courage, was quickly singled out by his superiors, and sent to officer training school, after which he was assigned to a job as a bombardier in a B-17 over Germany, a horrifically dangerous position with a low survival rate that makes a young man live for the day and take risks. The no status soda jerk suddenly finds himself an officer and a gentleman, and in the eyes of women almost a rock star. One week on leave, he marries a glamorous young woman named Marie, played by the A-list beauty Virginia Mayo. It’s not a real marriage, only a brief fling, but if you fully expect to die, why not tie the knot and make it official. Why not take possession of some high quality wedding photos you can tape up in your B-17 like pinups to show off to your crewmates, who take one look at your wife, and after convincing themselves you’re telling the truth, bow down and declare themselves not worthy to be in your presence. Fred, you the man.\n\nOnce the war is over, however, you are faced with a much more difficult fate then dying. You have to live, not as a glamorous hero facing an almost certain death fighting Hitler, but as what you once were, a lower working-class nobody with no real skills or education. Marie, your wife, is somewhere in Boone City, but she’s long since forgotten you. You can get your old job at the drugstore back, but at a lower rate of pay and with Stinky as your boss. What’s more, your coworkers resent returning veterans as a threat to their jobs, and the customers have no idea what you were only a few months before. You try to make a go of it with Marie, and even try to pressure her into becoming a stay at home wife, but she has no interest in quitting her own job, at a nightclub, and you are no longer the man she was attracted to in the first place, an officer, a gentleman, and a hero. What’s more you realize that you and Marie don’t really like each other. All you and she saw in each other was a surface appearance, the glamorous babe and the dashing captain. You certainly don’t enjoy each other’s presence or conversation. You can’t spend an evening at home. You and she must go out every night and spend money just to keep busy. Slowing down would mean facing each other and the fact that you both entered into a hasty marriage that never should have happened in the first place.\n\nIn other words, thank God I was too afraid of those sorority girls to get involved with one when she thought I was something I wasn’t.\n\nMarie knows exactly what she wants in life, to go out on dates, drink, eat, party, be merry and have fun, to enjoy being a hot babe every man in the room wants to be seen with. In this she is not unsympathetic. Virginia Mayo was only 25 in 1946, young and movie star beautiful with the emphasis on young. The 37-year-old Dana Andrews comes off like a sour, unpleasant, middle-aged man exploiting a younger woman and trying to keep her under lock and key when she rebels against his controlling personality and abusive ways. It’s a pretty typical fate for a man who marries a woman a decade younger than he is. She still wants to go out and party. He wants to stay home and go to bed early. Hello Leo DiCaprio. But while Dana Andrews is 37-years-old, Fred Derry is still in his mid-20s, just a naïve young man who made a bad decision because he was thinking with the wrong head, something all young men do, and doesn’t deserve to be punished for the rest of his life just because he wanted a few weeks of good sex before going off to die over Berlin.\n\nEnter Peggy Stephenson, Al Stephenson’s daughter. While Marie is a hard, brassy, working-class woman who has to get by on her looks, Peggy is a proper upper-class young lady. Played by Teresa Wright of Maplewood, New Jersey, a posh socially progressive town where I once worked as a golf caddie in their local country club, Peggy is well-educated, sensitive, and patriotic. She accepts Fred not in spite of the fact that he’s a homeless veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, but because he’s a homeless veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Fred, who needs a mother to help him heal from the war, and Peggy, who loves being a healer and caretaker, may not love each other, but they need each other. What’s more, they genuinely enjoy each other’s company. Peggy visits Fred at the drug store, where he’s able to be himself and tell someone what he really thinks of the cheap cosmetics he has to sell. They go to lunch and almost forget the time. Peggy and her rich boyfriend go out on a double date with Fred and Marie and we known damn well that if it were the 1960s they’d immediately wife swap. Marie wants to date Peggy’s rich preppy date as much as Fred wants to date Peggy. Peggy not only knows Fred is poor and works at a low status job, she relishes the idea of helping him work his way up in the world. Quite simply, the proper young lady and the damaged war hero are meant to be together.\n\nIn 2024 of course divorce is no big deal. In 1946 it was. William Wyler’s brilliance is in showing us the dialectical nature of social change, how the war and the economic mobilization that accompanied it not only wiped out the Great Depression, but opened up the country to a kind of social liberalism that will eventually be crushed by the McCarthy years but for a brief moment let people of all classes and status find the place they deserve. Al Stephenson is initially outraged that his daughter has fallen for a “smooth operator” like Fred Derry but it doesn’t matter. Peggy is her own woman and is going to do what she wants anyway. Indeed, while Al’s transition to civilian life is far less jarring than Fred’s or Homers, the progressive liberalism of his two grown children is a challenge to his traditional WASP, bourgeoisie ways. After giving his son a samurai sword and a flag he took “from a dead Jap” the son is horrified by his father’s racism and instead wants to talk about Hiroshima. The younger man is not thrilled by Truman’s war crime. Indeed, there’s more regret about the bombing of Hiroshima in 5 minutes Wyler’s 1946 film than there is all of Christopher Nolan’s bloated, overrated Oppenheimer. In 1946 Americans were satisfied that they had beaten German and Japanese fascism, but they by no means believed they were completely innocent.\n\nAs Fred Derry continues to fall into a greater and greater sense of despair over his lack of prospects and unhappy marriage, he gets more and more abusive towards Marie. What’s more, after a halfhearted talking to by his future father in law Al Stephenson, he gets violent, not to Marie, but to a man who half invites it but certainly doesn’t deserve it. When Homer pays Fred a visit at work, he’s suddenly approached by a middle-aged man who notices the hooks where his hands used to be. We first expect him to say something like “thank you for your service” but instead the man, an America Firster who gives off hints he’s an actual Nazi, harangues Homer about how he lost his hands for nothing. “We fought the wrong people,” he rants, “just become some commie radicals in Washington got too big for their britches.” When Fred politely requests he leave, the harangues Fred and the idea of social mobility the war provided. “You see. Now every soda jerk in the country thinks he’s someone.” The man is not violent. He’s not really even abusive but he is an irritating pain in the ass harassing a gravely wounded veteran with no hands. When he goes to pay his bill, and Homer follows him, wanting to continue the discussion, he repeats what he had said before, that Homer lost his hands for nothing and that we shouldn’t have taken sides with the Soviet Union against the Nazis. Fred has heard enough. He leaps over the counter, punches the man in the face, then throws him into a glass cabinet, knocking him out.\n\nFred is once again an anti-fascist hero but this time he hasn’t returned from a suicide mission over Berlin. He’s beaten up a middle-aged man for expressing an opinion. Like a teenage anarchist in a black mask he’s gotten off on punching a Nazi. If we are perceptive and not blindly jingoistic, we realize watching this scene how we have been manipulated by our government and our media for the last few decades. The social mobility and economically progressive agenda of the New Deal are long gone and whatever Bernie Sanders tells you they’re not going to return. But the cheap high of punching a Nazi — or even just an isolationist with a few suspect right wing views — is still here to be dangled in front of us every time our rulers want to go to war. Every world leader or people the the American ruling class want to get rid of has become Hitler. The Soviet Union? “Totalitarian” like Hitler. North Korea? Hitler. The Serbs in the 1990s? Hitler. Saddam? Hitler. Assad? Hitler. The Islamic extremists the CIA used to stir up violence in Kosovo and destroy Syria and Libya? Hitler. The Palestinians in Gaza? You guessed it. Hitler.\n\nWilliam Wyler may have been a strong supporter of the war but he sees the danger that a lot of Americans like Fred were in. If a soldier doesn’t get his life together after the war, find some purpose, then he risks holding onto the war for the rest of his life. What’s worse, he might become a destructive influence on the country he supposedly fought to protect. The Frei Korps in Germany, the American Legion, the Black and Tans, Gladio, even the persistent urge in Russia to see the world through the lens of World War II, there are many examples of even a victorious war making it impossible for a people to move on with their lives and build a better society.\n\nFortunately, for Fred Derry, there is redemption. After getting fired from his job at the drug store, he decides to leave town so as not to cause Al Stephenson any more grief. Marie demands a divorce, something he gladly agrees to. He says goodbye to his parents, who suddenly realize what they are losing. But when he arrives at the airport — where he’s given a ticket by a clerk played by Sean Penn’s father — Fred notices hundreds of demobilized B-17s. Initially believing they’re going to be junked, he feels cynical and hopeless. I suppose the junk man gets everyone in the end, he says to a salvage foreman. But when the foreman informs Fred that the planes aren’t going to be junked but recycled into materials to make new houses, Fred suddenly realizes that he too might be recycled back into civilian life. When he realizes the foreman is a fellow veteran, he asks him for a job, and in spite of having no experience, he’s given one. Fred may not have found his calling, but at the very least he’s found a job he can stand working for a fellow veteran. At Homer’s wedding, he meets Peggy. She’s happy to see him, even more happy he’s found a job, and even happier yet that his wife has given him a divorce. Life is going to be tough for awhile, he says, but eventually it will get better. She expresses her wish to share Fred’s misery. She doesn’t care about money. He doesn’t care about glamor. They accept each other for who they are. We are confident they will be happy together, two members of what Tom Brokaw would call the greatest generation. It’s just too bad Fred and Peggy will probably end up voting for Nixon and supporting the war in Vietnam and eventually in their old age Reagan and George W. Bush.\n\nHomer Parrish, however, will probably stick to the progressive faith of the New Deal. Harold Russell, the young non-actor who played Homer, and who won two Oscars for his performance, did not continue as a professional actor. Instead he went to graduate school at Boston University and received a masters degree. Eventually he ended up heading an organization for disabled veterans. When President Truman fired Douglas MacArthur, Russell wrote a letter supporting him and affirming civilian control of the military. The American Legion denounced him, but he stood his ground.\n\nAs head of AMVETS, Russell wrote to President Truman in 1951 supporting his decision to dismiss General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. Russell’s telegram to Truman cited MacArthur’s “repeated insubordination in violation of basic American principles governing civil versus military authority.” His telegram asserted that those were “obvious grounds” to relieve MacArthur. Erle Cocke, Jr., commander of the American Legion, said that he was “shocked by the news” that AMVETS and the American Veterans Committee supported MacArthur’s firing.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Russell\n\nHarold Russell died in 2002 at the age of 88 after having spent almost 60 years with his horrific disability. Sadly he began to run out of money at the end of his life and had to sell his Best Supporting Actor statue to provide for his wife’s medical expenses. We live in that kind of a country. The New Deal is long gone, replaced by a voracious yet vacuous neoliberalism. Harold Russell was no John Wayne. He did not profit from the War that made him famous. He didn’t grandstand. He was not a glamorous hero, just an ordinary man who paid a heavy price to defeat Hitler and Japanese fascism and who later stood his ground supporting a democratically elected President against an egotist. For that he deserves to be remembered. What’s more the deep focus, black and white photography of The Best Years of Our Lives hint at a nobility that seems gone from the United States. Every frame could be a Life Magazine still photo, the Midwest — actually Southern California standing in for the Midwest — clean, sharp, full of promise, looking towards a future we no longer seem to believe in. Sadly our ruling class will still invoke the Harold Russells and Fred Derrys of the past to justify the rapacious, unjust wars of the present.\n\nIn recent years, western Europe has been so pacified by neoliberalism and the European Union that it’s sometimes hard to imagine how brutal “the troubles” and the deployment of the British Army to Northern Ireland (the first “war on terror”) really were. After all, aren’t the Irish just another dull, wealthy western European people like the French or the Dutch? They’re certainly not Serbs or Palestinians. But don’t take my word for it. The Troubles, an ethno-religious conflict between white, northern European Christians, is as recent as the childhood of most Millennials. Original documentary footage, real British soldiers on Patrol in Belfast, even made it onto MTV.\n\nIn 1990, Ken Loach, the leftist British filmmaker who had most the classic working class movie “Kes” in the 1960s, and who had spent most of the Thatcher years doing almost nothing at all, roared back to life in his mid-50s with Hidden Agenda, the first movie of the second act of his truly remarkable career. Loach is in fact not only still alive, but still so dangerous and relevant that he’s been “canceled” by respectable British public opinion for his support of Jeremy Corbyn and the Palestinians. In Hidden Agenda, he suggests that what happened in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, was more than an ethno-religious conflict between Protestant Anglo Saxons and Roman Catholic Celts. It was in fact the very destruction of British democracy.\n\nHidden Agenda opens at an “Orange Walk” in downtown Belfast in the late 1970s, an “Orange Walk” basically a gang of Protestants marching through the Catholic section of the city looking to pick fights. Paul Sullivan and Ingrid Jessner, two vaguely left wing American lawyers played by Brad Dourif and Frances McDormand, are giving a press conference. They have just concluded an investigation of human rights abuses committed by the British Army. Teresa Doyle, an Irish republican journalist, is not impressed. She has evidence of British soldiers committing extrajudicial executions. She confronts Jessner, accusing her of being used by the British government, and demands that Jessner meet her later to take possession of the photographs. While Jessner is chatting with Doyle, Sullivan walks outside to observe the parade, which he’s appalled by. “Tribalism” he whispers under his breath. Just then Captain Harris, a disgruntled British intelligence officer, slips a newspaper, which contains a cassette, into Sullivan’s hands.\n\nIf Doyle’s photographs of the British Army committing summary executions puts Jessner in grave danger, then Harris’s cassette, which contains evidence of a right wing faction in the British Conservative Party plotting not only to destabilize the Labor government but to discredit moderates inside the Tories, is a death sentence for Sullivan. Even though Sullivan and Jessner have experience in Chile during Pinochet’s coups, they have no idea how far out of their depth they really are. “What happened in Chile can’t happen here,” they reassure themselves. Teresa Doyle nor Captain Harris are not malicious or stupid. Both of them believe that since Sullivan and Jessner are prominent American human rights lawyers, the British security forces won’t touch either of them.\n\nIt is a grave mistake. Neither American nor white privilege means jack shit in Northern Ireland. It didn’t mean very much in Chile either, but both of them got lucky. Sullivan’s luck has run out. On the way to a meeting with Captain Harris to discuss the tape, a British Army death squad pulls up alongside of his car and machine guns him and his driver, a member of the IRA. The British soldiers then proceed to plant weapons in the car and switch Sullivan’s body to the passenger seat. They concoct a story that Sullivan’s driver tried to run a roadblock, where the guards had to return fire in self defense. The death squad it later turns out to have been a semi-independent anti-terrorist special operations unit empowered to fight the IRA by any means necessary. The authorities quickly accept their story at face value and declare the case closed.\n\nEnter Peter Kerrigan, a senior police inspector from the mainland played by Brian Cox. Kerrigan is an honest, well-respected official, one of the very few men in the United Kingdom with the the authority to poke around the incestuous senior command in Belfast without ending up machine gunned himself. Even so he’s relentlessly stonewalled and misled by men who resent the idea of someone from “the mainland” undermining their authority, and barging into a war he just doesn’t understand. Nevertheless, Paul Sullivan’s murder was so heavy handed and incompetent it’s almost impossible to keep it under wraps for very long, and eventually the authorities in Belfast are ready to throw the members of the death squad that killed Paul Sullivan under the bus.\n\nBut Kerrigan, who has already made contact with Ingrid Jessner and Captain Harris is getting closer and closer to the tape and right wing coup that put Thatcher and her extremist right wing ideology into power. We begin to notice that the British state is far more sinister, and powerful, than we could have imagined. Not only is Ingrid Jessner under constant surveillance and Kerrigan constantly watched, even Captain Harris, an inexperienced British intelligence officer, can barely shake the surveillance for more than a few minutes. Just about the only place Kerrigan can meet freely with witnesses and interrogate Harris about the tape is under the protection of the IRA, which he despises. Nevertheless, Teresa Doyle sets Kerrigan and Jessner up to meet Captain Harris in an IRA pub, shortly after which the security forces kick in her door and drag Doyle off to prison.\n\nThat the British Army knew exactly what Kerrigan was doing and where he was to meet Captain Harris demonstrates clearly that the security forces have thoroughly infiltrated the IRA. By 1980s the Troubles were besides the point. How easily they were shut down in the 1990s as Ireland was brought into the neoliberal world order indicates that they were anything but a true ethno-religious conflict. Nobody in the heavily secular UK cares who’s Protestant and who’s Catholic anymore. But Northern Ireland in the 1970s, like Guantanamo Bay, the occupied territories in Israel, or Iraq, was a laboratory for the implementation of a totalitarian state in the heart of the “free” world. Kerrigan not only figures out exactly what was going on with the rise of Margaret Thatcher, he goes right to the powerful men who organized the coup and confronts them. They are rattled but still defiant. They had never expected this meddlesome policeman to get so far, but still know they can crush him like a bug.\n\nSoon we begin to realize where their power comes from. Fascism isn’t conjured out of the ether by evil men. It’s made inevitable by the collaboration of good men. Inevitably Kerrigan realizes how far out of his depth he really is. The right wing coup plotters and the security forces have been watching him from the very beginning. They have photos of him meeting with known terrorists in an IRA pub. They have barely manipulated photos of him with Ingrid Jessner, who they inform Kerrigan has a long history of involvement with the Communist Party. They have already had their extensive contacts in the British media organize a complete smear campaign proving that he’s a terrorist sympathizer having an affair with an American communist. They make an offer. Prosecute the men who murdered Paul Sullivan and get out of the whole mess a hero who upheld the rule of law, or continue trying to investigate the coup, publish a story nobody’s going to believe anyway, and say goodbye to his marriage and his pension.\n\nKerrigan takes the offer.\n\nIngrid Jessner and Captain Harris make a valiant effort to expose the coup without Kerrigan but it’s hopeless. Another death squad grabs Harris in broad daylight right in the middle of Dublin, break both his legs, throw him in a van and put a bullet in his head. The IRA did it of course. Ingrid Jessner gets back to the United States with her life and the tape but without Harris or Kerrigan to cooperate her testify she’s only going to be dismissed as a loony conspiracy theorist and communist with two dead boyfriends in her past. Thatcher would eventually be gone, pushed out of office by poll tax riots. The United States would move in and negotiate an end to The Troubles. A few decades later, Ireland would be the richest country in Europe if measured by per capita income, and the Irish themselves be transformed into generic neoliberal western Europeans. But both Ireland and the UK would continue to live in the hell made by Thatcherism. Nothing can, or will ever change.\n\nIn 1959, the iconic American actor James Stewart starred in a movie called The FBI Story. Surprisingly long for the era at close to 3 hours, The FBI Story was more of a collection of short TV episodes than a feature length movie. A retelling of veteran FBI agent Chip Hardesty’s long career, which ran from the early 1920s to the late 1950s, each episode showed the bureau fighting racism, organized crime, Nazi infiltration of Latin America, and finally international communism. The movie was a patriotic ode to American state power. In the final FBI Story, Stewart, a conservative Republican and Air Force veteran who would later fly a few token bombing missions over Vietnam as an observer, leads a surveillance mission against two Communist Party spies in New York. The fact that the bureau had enough manpower to cover every subway stop from Yankee Stadium to Bowling Green was presented, not as a waste of taxpayer money, or a dangerous quasi-totalitarian excess, but as a testament to benevolent, can do technological efficiency. Not surprisingly, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover liked the movie so much he assigned director Mervyn LeRoy a permanent FBI escort.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the reputation of the FBI declined, severely. By the 1980s, most Americans began to see the bureau, not as an efficient organization of clean-cut, patriotic white collar Americans who made the world safe from bootlegging gangsters and international communism, but as a gang of thugs who harassed civil rights and antiwar activists, spied on artists and intellectuals, and had more criminals on the payroll than the mafia. J. Edgar Hoover was seen, not as a heroic crime busting public servant, but as a bizarre, racially obsessed pervert, who liked to try on women’s lingerie and appointed his boyfriend Deputy Director of the FBI. Most people on the left began to believe, not without reason, that he had a hand in the assassination of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X.\n\nNevertheless the FBI somehow managed to rehabilitate itself in the eyes of the American people. By that time Mervyn LeRoy, who died in 1986 was as an old-fashioned studio hack and Stewart, who died in 1997, an adorable old man who wrote bad poetry. But after a series of films directed by hip young auteurs like Brian De Palma, Jonathan Demme, and Alan Parker, the bureau made it into the 1990s almost as popular as it was in the 1950s. In The Untouchables, Kevin Costner, who more than superficially resembled a Boomer James Stewart, play Treasury agent Elliot Ness, the man who brought down Al Capone. A year later, Gene Hackman, the tough-guy cop from The French Connection, played a swaggering FBI agent who knew when to bend the rules, and torture Mississippi Klansmen. Finally, in Silence of the Lambs, Jodie Foster injected the FBI with a bit of feminist girl power, bringing down a transvestite serial murderers even as she was working through her daddy issues with brilliant serial killer Hannibal Lector.\n\nThe second episode of The FBI Story had Agent Chip Hardesty travel to Ute City in Wade County Oklahoma to investigate a series of murders of Osage Indians. Newly wealthy after the discovery of oil on their reservation, the Osage were being picked off one by one by racist predators who wanted to inherit the “head rights” on their estates after they died. In 1906, the brutally racist Burke Act had declared American Indians to be “incompetent” to manage their own financial affairs. As a result, Osage landowners were required to have a court appointed “white guardian” give permission before they could access their own oil money. Since Oklahoma’s anti-miscegenation law forbade marriages between whites and people of African descent but not between whites and American Indians, opportunistic white men would often marry wealthy Osage women, arrange for their deaths, and live happily ever after on the oil money. Local law enforcement was so corrupt and so racist that none of these murders was ever fully investigated. Sadly for the Oklahoma’s racist white criminal psychopaths, however, one man had his wife killed on federal property. That put the crime under the jurisdiction of the FBI, and Hardesty, who brought in a team of undercover agents, posing as a local cattle dealer, managed to trace one of the murders to a local banker, Dwight McCutcheon, by sending copies of various documents relating to the transfer of oil head rights from Indians to whites back to Washington, and discovering that almost all of them had been composed on the same typewriter at McCutcheon’s bank. Without firing a shot, and through the wonders of forensic technology, Agent Hardesty busted up the gang of racist psychopaths and put McCutcheon away for life.\n\nThe 1990s had been a golden age of Native American cinema. Since one of the activist groups targeted by the FBI had been the American Indian Movement — Leonard Peltier, an AIM activist framed by FBI Cointelpro, remains in prison to this day–the lone exception to the pro-FBI movies released in Hollywood in the late 1980s and early 1990s, had been Michael Apted’s Thunderheart. A thinly fictionalized retelling of the FBI occupation of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and the framing of Leonard Peltier, it reversed the narrative of The FBI Story. Where in The FBI Story Special Agent Hardesty liberated the Indians from a reign of terror by racist criminals in collusion with local law enforcement, in Thunderheart it was the FBI itself that maintained the reign of terror at Pine Ridge until it was driven off the reservation by an FBI agent of Indian descent played by Val Kilmer and a local tribal policemen played by Graham Greene.\n\nNevertheless, Thunderheart barely put a dent in the FBI’s reputation among mainstream Americans and in 2016, after Donald Trump won the Presidential election against Hillary Clinton, even the American left began to see the federal government in a positive light. Even though Donald Trump was in the White House, leftists and liberals no longer was the problem as federal government, and federal law enforcement, but as local racist police forces and a racist white culture. In his 2017 book on the Osage murders, David Grann completed the rehabilitation of the FBI’s reputation, portraying Agent Tom White, the real life figure who solved the Osage murders, as a clean cut patriotic all American hero in the vein of Stewart’s Chip Hardesty and Kevin Costner’s Elliot Ness. Indeed, Grann’s Tom White is the hero of Grann’s book, a real life Captain America who not only put racist criminals in prison, but spent his off duty hours campaigning against the death penalty.\n\nThat brings us at long last to the 80- year-old Martin Scorsese and his three and a half hour long epic Killers of the Flower Moon. If James Stewart has always been the iconic WASP American actor, and the FBI the iconic WASP federal agency, then Martin Scorsese is the iconic auteur of Catholic, white ethnic America. In a series of very good movies in the 1970s and 1980s, Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and of course Goodfellas, Scorsese gave us a series of unforgettable Irish and Italian American anti-heroes struggling with sin, depravity, and Christian rememption. Even though he cast a WASP, Willem Defoe, as Jesus in the Last Temptation of Christ, and another WASP, David Bowie, as Pontius Pilate, it was the Jewish Harvey Keitel as Judas who stole the movie out from under all of them.\n\nAfter Goodfellas, the quality of Scorsese’s films dropped off fairly dramatically. His attempt to reboot Goodfellas as Casino is well-regarded, but never quite reached the crisp narrative flow of his earlier movies. His attempt to portray Victorian WASP America in The Age of Innocence is a snooze fest, and in Gangs of New York, he cast a very bad actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, as the Irish American hero, and a very good actor, Daniel Day Lewis, as the nativist, Know Nothing WASP villain. Not surprisingly, everybody who saw Gangs of New York was rooting for the villain, even when he threw a meat cleaver into an Irish immigrant’s back and bashed in his skull with his own shillelagh. “Why don’t you burn him and see if his ashes turn green,” Lewis’s racist villain quipped, to the laughter of almost everybody including Irish Catholics.\n\nThe less said about Scorsese’s The Irishman, the better. It was such a dreary slog that by the time we got to see what really happened to Jimmy Hoffa, an anti-Italian German American bigot played by Al Pacino –yeah right– we just wanted the whole thing to be over. Nevertheless, The Irishman did present us with an example of, if not cross racial, then cross-ethnic bonding, with Robert De Niro’s Irish American thug being accepted as an honorary Italian by Joe Pesci’s mob boss.\n\nIn Killers of the Flower Moon, no such multicultural vision is remotely possible. Indeed, the movie is a good argument for anti-miscegenation laws, which might at least have protected Osage women from predatory white men. All interactions between the races in Killers of the Flower Moon, are grotesque, exploitative, transactional, and finally murderous. The onus, of course, is entirely on the white men, who are invariably dimwitted thugs, gargoyles, drunks, and criminal psychopaths. Indeed, Scorsese’s movie resembles nothing so much as a George Grosz caricature of American evil, a hellscape of demons so dark and so depraved that even Joe Pesci’s psychotic rage killer in Goodfellas or Daniel Day Lewis’s nativist bigot in Gangs of New York seem charming by comparison. If Killers of the Flower Moon is perhaps a bit racist against the Osage, portraying them as clueless, passive victims, then at least the Indians are human. There is nothing even remotely resembling a human white character in Scorsese’s movie. They are either criminal psychopaths or, in the case of the FBI agents, efficient machines. But more on that shortly.\n\nIf Killers of the Flower Moon doesn’t quite reach the heights of Scorsese’s early movies, it is nevertheless his best film since Goodfellas. Unlike Gangs of New York, the Last Temptation of Christ, or Age of Innocence, it is an effective period piece. Working closely with the Osage themselves, Scorsese recreates the world of 1920s Oklahoma. I don’t know what 1920s Oklahoma looked like myself, but I’m perfectly satisfied with the film’s re imagining of the time long past. In fact, I found the neat little suburban bungalows, the vital downtown, and the beautiful rural scenes so attractive, I began to ask myself how so much evil could have invaded such a lovely place. Where have these demonic white men come from? Why have they been allowed to despoil what could have been a happy and prosperous world for the Osage? Lily Gladstone’s performance as Molly Kyle lives up to all the hype. She really is an excellent actress, who manages to convey a life that was stolen for no reason, an innocent woman who fells into hands of an evil man simply because she was too innocent to suspect the depths of depravity and greed of which white men were capable. Too bad she hadn’t seen Goodfellas. Scorsese also manages to effectively dramatize the genocide of the American Indian by the white man on a miniaturist scale, elevating one abusive marriage to a world historical dimension. Indeed, he creates a world where evil is so banal, so normal, that not only do his white characters fail to behave any differently. They can’t even imagine behaving differently. Killers of the Flower Moon is at long last a movie about sin with no hope of redemption. It brings to mind the old Three Dog Night song. “I know there ain’t no heaven but I pray there ain’t no hell.” Well, the movie says, your prayers have been answered. There is a hell, and it’s the United States of America.\n\nMy biggest difficulty with the film was in believing that Gladstone’s Molly could have ever been fooled by DiCaprio’s Ernest Burkhart. I am of course not a heterosexual woman and I’m well aware that Leonardo DiCaprio is the iconic 1990s heartthrob who played the sensitive, angelic Jack Dawson in Titanic, who died to save the life of the girl he loved. But here the puffy, middle-aged DiCaprio is so obviously a toxic dimwit and a criminal psychopath that the only reason to believe that any woman would fall in love with him is the fact that the other white men in town are even worse. Personally if I had been an Osage woman in the 1920s, I would have fled in panic from even the sight of a white man and only married within the tribe. Why wealthy Osage women in Scorsese’s movie married white husbands is never quite explained, and sadly it makes them look like a white liberal’s caricature of a exploited non-white victim. Perhaps I just don’t understand Leonardo DiCaprio’s appeal. Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt I get. Of course women are attracted to that. But I just don’t see why DiCaprio has had such a rich, varied career.\n\nRobert De Niro’s performance, on the other hand, is a chilling, effective portrait of quiet, understated evil. De Niro, who I’d love to see as the 100-year-old Henry Kissinger or the 98-year-old Enrico Dandolo, the ancient, blind, Venetian doge who led the Fourth Crusade and destroyed Constantinople, gets more and more menacing the smaller and more frail he looks, the more he lowers his voice. He’s the apotheosis of the mobster who will say “take care of it” instead of “bash his skull in, chop up the body and feed him to the sharks.” Unlike DiCaprio’s dimwitted Burkhart, it doesn’t matter if we believe De Niro’s act or not. He’s so terrifying that no one would dare not believe it. His dominance over the younger man, his ability to tie up loose ends, arrange murders simply by the power of suggestion, is so vivid that perhaps film historians will look at it as the iconic expression of the American gerontocracy of 2023, as good an explanation as any of how a frail, elderly ruling class made up of figures like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell and even perhaps Vladimir Putin were able to squash any potential youthful rebellion and live into a ripe old age fully in charge of the American oligarchy.\n\nAs for the FBI, Scorsese portrays them, not as heroes, not as James Stewart or young Kevin Costner, but simply as agents of the machine that is the federal government. De Niro’s reign of terror is so overwhelmingly grim, that as blank and unappealing as Jesse Plemons is as agent Tom White, we’re still overjoyed when the feds finally arrive. At long last, we think, justice, even if it is administered by robots. Perhaps that’s the answer after all. If neither the Millennials nor the Zoomers have any fire in their souls, if revolution is impossible, maybe it’s just as well that we’re going to be destroyed by AI. Or perhaps AI is the final destination of J. Edgar Hoover’s efficient bureaucracy. After all, in the film The Matrix, wasn’t Agent Smith, who saw humans as a virus, basically an FBI man in a dark suit?\n\nIn every generation there is a movie. He was a man, but he was more than a man. While other kids were playing with toys, he was contemplating Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. While his classmates at middle-school were listening to the Backstreet Boys, he was writing grand operas for La Scala. By the time he was barely old enough to vote, he was already marked off as a man of destiny. Women desired him, but couldn’t understand him. Men tried to use him, but never really controlled him. In the end he was dragged down, not only by his personal demons, but by the vengeful mediocrities he barely deigned to notice, until they destroyed him. He is the sexy, misunderstood genius.\n\nFor late Boomers and early Gen Xers, he is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the raucous, fun-loving innocent of Milos Foreman’s 1984 movie Amadeus, the gifted composer driven to madness by his rival Antonio Salieri, who had no musical inspiration, but did possess a genius for evil. For late Gen Xers he is Will Hunting, a young working-class man from South Boston, who could solve complex mathematical equations beyond the ability of tenured MIT professors, but who not even Robin Williams could save from being a belligerent asshole. Early Millennials got the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a whole stable full of mutants and superheroes, Batman, Ironman and Captain America. Finally, in 2023, late millennials have gotten their own sexy, misunderstood genius, the man who made it possible for humanity to destroy itself, J. Robert Oppenheimer himself, the Prometheus who gave the secret of atomic fire to the American ruling class, but who in the end was done in by Tony Stark disguised as a Jewish shoe salesman turned politician.\n\nFar be it from me as an unintelligent Polish American — hell I can’t even screw in a lightbulb by myself — to pass judgement on history’s greatest minds, but if I had to choose one of the three, Mozart, Will Hunting, or Oppenheimer, I would of course chose Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart genuinely enriched humanity. By driving him to an early death the demonic Salieri deprived us of decades of opera, symphonies, string quartets and clarinet solos. Will Hunting of course is a fictional working-class Bostonian who does manage to humiliate an arrogant preppy in a “Hahvad Bah” and confidently informs his psychotherapist that he has “the wrong fucking books,” but in general shows few signs of being a world historical genius unless we take the movie’s word for it. Will Hunting does, however, have one moment of unimpeachable integrity. When a bureaucrat from the National Security Agency (NSA) temps him to prostitute himself to the government in exchange for a steady high paying job and access to cutting edge technology, Will tells him in no uncertain terms to go straight to hell.\n\nChristopher’s Nolan’s Oppenheimer, played to gaunt perfection by Cillian Murphy — the man actually looks like a genius — has no such working-class mistrust and contempt for the system. Why would he? He’s from a wealthy New York German Jewish family. His father was an art collector who decorated their palatial Riverside Drive apartment with original paintings by Van Gogh and Picasso. He’s gotten the best education money can buy, private schools in Manhattan, Harvard and Cambridge, a PHD from the University of Gottingen. But he’s no East Coast city slicker deprived of nature’s wonders. His family wealth has allowed him to spend extended periods of time hiking in the remote Southwest near a place called Los Alamos. True, he’s indulged in the fashionable left-wing politics of the 1930s. He sends money to Spanish refugees and passionately supports the republican side of the Spanish Civil War. But the Roosevelt administration doesn’t even have to ask him to sign onto the Manhattan Project. Quite the contrary, he never doubts the idea that the United States has to build its own atomic bomb to counter Hitler’s. Oppenheimer becomes the father of the nuclear arms race, not in spite of his left-wing politics, but because of them.\n\nThe ethical conflicts in Oppenheimer don’t present themselves in big dramatic moments. Instead they consist of little compromises made along the way so as not to derail the all important, ongoing project taking place at Los Alamos. Oppenheimer may not be a communist or even a socialist, but he is a good progressive liberal unwilling to enforce military discipline on scientists and their families. Even after he’s given clear instructions by his superiors, he won’t flat out order his subordinates not to organize unions sponsored by the Communist Party or hold cross departmental discussion groups that turn out to be a threat to the project’s security. Oppenheimer won’t join the Communist Party, even during the short lived American/Soviet alliance, but he has no problem socializing with communists, or even marrying them. It’s only later that those compromises, which in 1944 and 1945 feel like the acts of a good supervisor protecting his employees from meddling bureaucrats but a decade later during the McCarthy era look like treason, that his inability to confront trivial every day issues comes back to bite him. Ernest Lawrence, played by Josh Hartnett, is the voice of reason, and even a stand in for Christopher Nolan himself. “Tell your subordinates to keep their politics out of the workplace,” he implores his friend. “Why do college graduates need unions?” he adds speaking for every Silicon Valley tech CEO in despair over the idea that the employees at his latest startup have picked up one too many “woke” ideas from social media.\n\nThe social media controversy over the Irish Catholic Murphy playing a Jewish character was silly. Murphy nails Oppenheimer’s physical appearance so well I half want him to play every Jewish genius from 20th Century history. Someone cast him as Franz Kafka. He already looks the part. On the other hand, Nolan does not do full justice to the real moral conflict at the center of the film. The origin of the Manhattan Project was ultimately the 1939 letter Albert Einstein and Leo Szilard sent to Franklin Roosevelt warning him that Hitler was working on a German atomic bomb. The bomb detonated at Los Alamos was meant to be used as a defensive measure against a genocidal Nazi Germany, not as a genocidal act against the Japanese meant to intimidate the Soviet Union. Indeed, had Hitler gotten an atomic bomb before the Nazi regime fell he would have been far more likely to have used it at Stalingrad or Moscow than against Paris or London. The use of the bomb against Japanese civilians, and the later McCarthyite hysteria about communists in the American government was just the kind of fascist turn in the United States Oppenheimer wanted to prevent.\n\nNolan’s use of Lewis Strauss, therefore, an ambitious self-hating Jewish mediocrity, as the film’s main villain, therefore, distorts the real history of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s downfall. In the 1940s and 1950s history was moving at warp speed. It must have been indeed dismaying for progressive intellectuals like Oppenheimer to see the crowning achievement of his life’s work used by the American ruling class to intimidate China in North Korea or to develop a monopoly of destructive power over the global south. Indeed, Richard Nixon and John Foster Dulles lobbied Eisenhower to offer the French use of three small tactical nukes at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, but Eisenhower, who had felt the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki unnecessary, wisely refused. “You boys must be crazy,” Eisenhower told them. “We can’t use those awful things against Asians for a second time in less than ten years. My God!” When even a conservative, and racist, Republican President is reluctant to commit atomic war crimes against a non-European people, it must have been galling for Oppenheimer.\n\nThat Harry Truman, played by Gary Oldman, had no such scruples about ordering the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians, lays the basis for one of the film’s best scenes. As good as Robert Downy Jr.’s performance as Lewis Strauss may be, he’s no Antonio Salieri. We know exactly why Salieri wants to destroy Mozart. The pain the Italian mediocrity feels over Mozart’s ability to create beauty that he can understand but will never compose himself is real. We understand why he’s a damned soul. Strauss’s hatred for Oppenheimer, on the other hand, is ultimately based on one interaction at the Institute for Advanced Research at Princeton where he incorrectly believes Oppenheimer is responsible for a snub by Albert Einstein. It feels forced. Truman’s crude brutality — he offers Oppenheimer a tissue when Oppenheimer expresses his guilt over Hiroshima and Nagasaki — feels very real.\n\nIt also aligns perfectly with the right wing Nolan’s elitism. Nolan presents Oppenheimer as a hero, in spite of the scientist’s New Deal liberalism, because he sees him as a superior man, a superior man who was sadly too sympathetic to the left wing politics of his inferiors. He should have been more like Truman, Nolan seems to imply, or at least recognized the presence of a fellow superman above good and evil. His sincere confession that he “has blood on his hands” to such an crudely brutal and amoral politician feels degrading, weak. Similarly a tech CEO like Elon Musk, should feel no hesitation about breaking unions and letting his employees know who’s boss. Ultimately Oppenheimer is the tragedy of a superior man brought down by a misguided sympathy for democracy. J. Robert Oppenheimer, to paraphrase Will Hunting, has read “the wrong fucking books.” It should have been less Marx and more Nietzsche."
