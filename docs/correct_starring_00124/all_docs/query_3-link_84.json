        "text": "Legendary actor Carl Weathers, known for his iconic roles in the , Predator, The Mandalorian and Action Jackson, has died. He was 76.\n\nIn an official statement from his family, Deadline reports that he died on Thursday (February 1).\n\n“We are deeply saddened to announce the passing of Carl Weathers,” the family’s statement read. “He died peacefully in his sleep on Thursday, February 1st, 2024. … Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life. Through his contributions to film, television, the arts, and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.”\n\nBorn on January 14, 1948, in New Orleans, Weathers was athletic from the start and played numerous sports, including football, boxing, soccer, gymnastics, and wrestling. He played football in college at San Diego State University, helping to lead the Aztecs to a victory in the Pasadena Bowl in 1969. While in college, Weathers fell in love with acting and decided to pursue a degree in theater arts until he signed as a free agent with the Oakland Raiders in 1970. In just over two seasons, Weathers played in eight games as a linebacker in the NFL.\n\nFollowing the end of his football career, Weathers landed small film roles in the blaxploitation movies “Bucktown” and “Friday Foster” with Pam Grier. He made several appearances on popular TV series at the time, including \"Good Times,” “Kung Fu,” \"Cannon,” and “Starsky and Hutch.”\n\nHis big break came in 1976, when he was tapped to play Apollo Creed, the braggadocious heavyweight champion of the world, in the classic film Rocky,Awards, starring Sylvester Stallone. The film went on to win several Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Weathers would go on to reprise his role in Rocky II, Rocky III, and Rocky IV.\n\nMany actors would have found themselves pigeon holeed by such a memorable character, but Weathers went on to develop a remarkable career in Hollywood. He appeared in Predator, Action Jackson, and the cult-classic Happy Gilmore. He earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for his work in the ” where directed Episodes 12 and 20 of the series.\n\nIn an interview with British GQ, Weathers spoke about the difference between a \"movie star\" and an \"actor.\"\n\n“This label of movie star doesn't really have anything to do with being a really fine actor or artist,” Weathers said. “Enough promotion of any person, enough movies where that person gets to be shown in a particular light, can make them a movie star.”\n\nLife in Film: Carl Weathers\n\nCarl Weathers put down the football and started acting.
