Weathers was a star defensive end for San Diego State who later played professionally for the Oakland Raiders. He received a masters in theatre arts while in college, and he put his degree to good use once his football career came to an end in 1974.

Weathers appeared in a series of blaxploitation films before landing his breakout role as Apollo Creed in Rocky. Playing Rocky Balboa’s biggest rival turned best friend, Weathers portrayed Creed in four Rocky films between 1976 and 1985.

Following news of Weathers’ passing, an emotional Stallone paid tribute to his co-star in a social media video, saying: “He was magic, and I was so fortunate to be part of his life. So, Apollo, keep punching!”

The success of Rocky earned Weathers starring roles in a number of action films throughout the 1980s, including 1987’s Predator.

Later in his career, Weathers delivered memorable comedic performances as a one-handed golfing legend named Chubbs in Adam Sandler’s Happy Gilmore and as an exaggerated version of himself on Arrested Development.

Weathers’ final major role came as Greef Karga, leader of the Bounty Hunters’ Guild, on Disney+’s The Mandalorian.
