        "text": "Building on the excellent critical editions and studies by Russian scholars are recent translations of the most important early modern Russian law codes: Kaiser, Daniel H. (trans. and ed.), The Laws of Rus’ – Tenth to Fifteenth Centuries (Salt Lake City, UT: Charles Schlacks Jr, 1992); Dewey, Horace W. (comp., ed. and trans.), Muscovite Judicial Texts, 1488–1556, Michigan Slavic Materials 7 (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan, Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, 1966); Hellie, Richard (trans. and ed.), The Muscovite Law Code (Ulozhenie) of 1649. Part 1: Text and Translation (Irvine, CA Charles Schlacks Jr, 1988).\n\nSixteenth- and seventeenth-century Russian law is well served in English-language literature, and these articles are representative of the leading authors’ work: Dewey, Horace W., ‘The 1550 Sudebnik as an Instrument of Reform’, Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas 10.2 (1962), 161–80; Kleimola, Ann M., Justice in Medieval Russia: Muscovite Judgment Charters (pravye gramoty) of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries (Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1975); Hellie, Richard, ‘Early Modern Russian Law: The Ulozhenie of 1649’, Russian History 15.2–4 (1988), 155–80; Kaiser, Daniel H., The Growth of the Law in Medieval Russia (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1980); Weickhardt, George G., ‘Due Process and Equal Justice in the Muscovite Codes’, Russian Review 51.4 (1992), 463–80.\n\nFor the eighteenth century, Anisimov, Evgenii accents state violence in, for example, Dyba i knut. Politicheskii sysk i russkoe obshchestvo v XVIII veke (Rack and Knout. Political Trials and Russian Society in the Eighteenth Century) (Moscow: Novoe literaturnoe obozrenie, 1999); and Shrader, Abby explores the elimination of corporal punishment in Languages of the Lash: Corporal Punishment and Identity in Imperial Russia (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2002).\n\nStudies based on case law through the seventeenth century include Kollmann, Nancy S. on litigations over honour in By Honor Bound. State and Society in Early Modern Russia (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999) and on the criminal law in Crime and Punishment in Early Modern Russia (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012). Kivelson, Valerie A. explores witchcraft prosecutions and the role of torture in Desperate Magic: The Moral Economy of Witchcraft in Seventeenth-Century Russia (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2013). Local government is explored in Davies, Brian L., State Power and Community in Early Modern Russia (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004) and Glaz’ev, V. N., Vlast’ i obshchestvo na iuge Rossii v XVII veke: Protivodeistvie ugolovnoi prestupnosti (Power and Society in Southern Russia in the Seventeenth Century. Fighting Felony Crime) (Voronezh: Izd. Voronezhskogo gosud. universiteta, 2001).\n\nFor the eighteenth century, Golikova, N. B. explores political trials in Politicheskie protsessy pri Petre I: po materialam Preobrazhenskogo prikaza (Political Trials under Peter I: Based on the Materials of the Preobrazhenskii Chancery) (Moscow: Izd. Moskovskogo universiteta, 1957). Prosecutions of witchcraft and other spiritual crimes are the focus of Smilianskaia, Elena, Volshebniki. Bogokhul’niki. Eretiki (Magicians. Blasphemers. Heretics) (Moscow: Izd. Indrik, 2003) and Lavrov, A. S., Koldovstvo i religiiia v Rossii. 1700–1740 gg. (Witchcraft and Religion in Russia 1700–1740) (Moscow: Drevlekhranilishche, 2000). Schmidt, Christoph explores crime in Moscow in Sozialkontrolle in Moskau: Justiz, Kriminalität und Leibeigenschaft, 1649–1785 (Stuttgart: F. Steiner, 1996), while Gentes, Andrew A. examines the exile system in Exile to Siberia, 1590–1822 (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008). Hoch, Steven L. shows how peasant communes practised a tyranny of the old men over women and young men in Serfdom and Social Control in Russia. Petrovskoe, A Village in Tambov (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986).\n\nThe bureaucracy, so crucial to the functioning of the judicial system, is the focus of important studies. Representative of Brown, Peter B.’s many articles is ‘Neither Fish nor Fowl: Administrative Legality in Mid- and Late-Seventeenth-Century Russia’, Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas 50 (2002), 1–21, while Plavsic, Borivoj describes training and career paths in ‘Seventeenth-Century Chanceries and Their Staffs’, in Pintner, Walter M. and Karl Rowney, Don (eds.), Russian Officialdom: The Bureaucratization of Russian Society from the Seventeenth to the Twentieth Century (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1980), pp. 19–45. Troitskii, S. M. pioneered the collective prosopography of bureaucrats in Russkii absoliutizm i dvorianstvo v XVIII v. Formirovanie biurokratii (Russian Absolutism and Nobility in the Eighteenth Century. The Formation of the Bureaucracy) (Moscow: Nauka, 1974); Demidova, N. F. applied this approach to the earlier period in Sluzhilaia biurokratiia v Rossii XVII v. i ee rol’ v formirovanii absoliutizma (The Serving Bureaucracy in Russia in the Seventeenth Century and its Role in the Formation of Absolutism) (Moscow: Nauka, 1987). Pisar’kova, L. F., Gosudarstvennoe upravlenie Rossii s kontsa XVII do kontsa XVIII veka. Evoliutsiia biurokraticheskoi sistemy (State Administration in Russia from the End of the Seventeenth to the End of the Eighteenth Century. The Evolution of the Bureaucratic System) (Moscow: ROSSPEN, 2007) expands their findings.\n\nSome American scholars have construed Russia as a despotism or emphasised the brutality of public life: see Michels, Georg, ‘The Violent Old Belief: An Examination of Religious Dissent on the Karelian Frontier’, Russian History 19.1–4 (1992), 203–30; Poe, Marshall, ‘A People Born to Slavery’: Russia in Early Modern European Ethnography, 1476–1748 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000). Others argue that court politics was based on ‘consensus’ between ruler and the great clans and that overall governance followed a ‘politics of difference’: see Keenan, Edward L., ‘Muscovite Political Folkways’, Russian Review 45.2 (1986), 115–81; Kivelson, Valerie A., ‘The Devil Stole His Mind: The Tsar and the 1648 Moscow Uprising’, American Historical Review 98.3 (1993), 733–56; Kollmann, Nancy S., Kinship and Politics: The Making of the Muscovite Political System, 1345–1547 (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1987) and her The Russian Empire 1450–1801 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017).\n\nOn eighteenth-century moral philosophy and political views, see Wirtschafter, Elise Kimmerling, Religion and Enlightenment in Catherinian Russia: The Teachings of Metropolitan Platon (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2013) and Whittaker, Cynthia H., Russian Monarchy: Eighteenth-Century Rulers and Writers in Political Dialogue (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2003). Le Donne, John’s in-depth studies of Catherine II’s administrative and judicial reforms include Absolutism and Ruling Class: The Formation of the Russian Political Order, 1700–1825 (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991).\n\nThe best place to start on Chinese legal history is MacCormack, Geoffrey’s The Spirit of Traditional Chinese Law (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1996), which should be read along with his Traditional Chinese Penal Law (London: Wildy, Simmonds & Hill, 2013). To understand the ‘legislative turn’ in Qing governance see, Qin, Zheng, Guangyan, Zhou, trans., ‘Pursuing Perfection: Formation of the Qing Code’, Modern China 21.3 (1995), 310–44. Essential for understanding crime and punishment is Bourgon, Jerome, ‘The Principle of Legality and Legal Rules in the Chinese Legal Tradition’, in Delmas-Marty, Mirelle, Will, Pierre-Etienne and Norberg, Naomi (eds.), China, Democracy, and Law: A Historical and Contemporary Approach (Leiden: Brill, 2012), 169–88. On specific punishments see Meijer, Marinus, ‘The Autumn Assizes in Ch’ing Law’, Toung Pao 70 (1984), 1–17; Waley-Cohen, Joanna, Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang 1758–1820 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1991); and Brook, Timothy, Bourgon, Jerome and Blue, Gregory, Death by a Thousand Cuts (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2008). For social and economic changes in eighteenth-century China see Myers, Ramon and Wang, Yeh-chien, ‘Economic Developments, 1644–1800’, and William Rowe, ‘Social Stability and Social Change’, both in Peterson, Willard J. (ed.), The Cambridge History of China, vol. ix, The Chi’ing Dynasty to 1800, part 1 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 563–646 and 473–562 respectively.\n\nAn early study examining law and violent crime is Meijer, Marinus J., Murder and Adultery in Late imperial China: A Study of Law and Morality (Leiden: Brill, 1991). For an excellent case study of the politics of criminal justice and pioneering use of archival sources see Kuhn, Philip, Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of 1768 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990). For studies based on homicide case records see Buoye, Thomas, Manslaughter, Markets, and Moral Economy: Violent Disputes over Property Rights in Eighteenth-Century China (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), Theiss, Janet Disgraceful Matters: The Politics of Chastity in Eighteenth-Century China (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004), J. Neighbors, A Question of Intent: Homicide Law and Criminal Justice in Qing and Republican China (Leiden: Brill, 2018), and Sommer, Matthew, Sex, Law, and Society in Late Imperial China (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000). On the issue of ‘bare sticks’ see Buoye, Thomas, ‘Bare Sticks and Naked Pity: Rhetoric and Representation in Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) Capital Case Records’, Crime, History and Societies 18.2 (2014), 27–47. For translations of capital crime records see Hegel, Robert, True Crimes in Eighteenth-Century China: Twenty Case Histories (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2009).\n\nThe first effort to statistically analyse homicide based on the archival resources is Chen, Zhiwu, Peng, Kaixiang and Zhu, Lijun, ‘Social-Economic Change and its Impact on Violence: Homicide History of Qing China’, Explorations in Economic History 63 (2017), 8–25. Finally, an invaluable website for Qing law is Legalising Space in China, http://lsc.chineselegalculture.org/, the nexus of an ongoing project to translate the substatutes of the Qing Code, which has hundreds of historical works on Qing law, documents and other resources.\n\nThe definitive history of homicide in America is Roth, Randolph, American Homicide (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2009). An earlier and briefer treatment of homicide is Lane, Roger, Murder in America: A History (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1997). Very few histories contain statistical data on violence and other crimes in early America. Roth is exceptional for his systematic data. All the statistics on homicide rates in this chapter, except for those for Pennsylvania, are from Roth. The second exceptional history for supplying quantitative data on homicide as well as all other crimes is Marietta, Jack D. and Rowe, G. S., Troubled Experiment: Crime and Justice in Pennsylvania, 1682–1800 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006). Spindel, Donna J., Crime and Society in North Carolina, 1663–1776 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1989) also contains useful statistics.\n\nMost histories of crime and justice limit themselves to particular colonies, states or regions of Anglo-America. For Virginia and the Chesapeake region see Morgan, Edmund S., American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia (New York: W. W. Norton, 1975); Hart, Freeman H., The Valley of Virginia in the American Revolution, 1763–1789 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1942); Morgan, Gwenda, The Hegemony of the Law: Richmond County, Virginia, 1692–1776 (New York: Garland, 1989); Roeber, A. G., Faithful Magistrates and Republican Lawyers: Creators of Virginia Legal Culture, 1680–1810 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981); and Schwarz, Philip J., Twice Condemned: Slaves and the Criminal Laws of Virginia, 1705–1865 (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1988).\n\nFor the south outside the Chesapeake see Brown, Richard Maxwell, The South Carolina Regulators (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963); Butterfield, Fox, All God’s Children: The Bosket Family and the American Tradition of Violence (New York: Alfred A. Knopf/Random House, 1995); Ekirch, Roger, ‘Poor Carolina’: Politics and Society in Colonial North Carolina, 1729–1776 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981); Spindel, Crime and Society; and Wyatt-Brown, Bertram, Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982).\n\nFor New England see Dayton, Cornelia Hughes, Women before the Bar: Gender, Law, and Society in Connecticut, 1639–1789 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1995); Cave, Alfred A., The Pequot War (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1996); Nelson, William E., Dispute and Conflict Resolution in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, 1725–1825 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1981); Konig, David Thomas, Law and Society in Puritan Massachusetts: Essex County, 1629–1692 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1979); Hoerder, Dirk, Crowd Action in Revolutionary Massachusetts, 1765–1780 (New York: Academic Press, 1977); McManus, Edgar J., Law and Liberty in Early New England: Criminal Justice and Due Process, 1620–1692 (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1993); Richards, Leonard L., Shays’s Rebellion: The American Revolution’s Final Battle (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002); Karlsen, Carol F., The Devil in the Shape of a Woman: Witchcraft in Colonial New England (New York: W.

Norton, 1987); Bourne, Russell, The Red King’s Rebellion: Racial Politics in New England, 1675–1678 (New York: Atheneum, 1990); Drake, James D., King Philip’s War: Civil War in New England, 1675–1676 (Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 1999); Lepore, Jill, The Name of War: King Philip’s War and the Origins of American Identity (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1998); Philbrick, Nathaniel, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War (New York: Viking, 2006); and Salisbury, Neal, Manitou and Providence: Indians, Europeans, and the Making of New England, 1500–1643 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982).\n\nFor Pennsylvania and the Middle Colonies see Marietta and Rowe, Troubled Experiment; Bouton, Terry, Taming Democracy: ‘The People’, the Founders, and the Troubled Ending of the American Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007); Fox, Francis S., Sweet Land of Liberty: The Ordeal of the American Revolution in Northampton County, Pennsylvania (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000); Frantz, John B. and Pencak, William, Beyond Philadelphia: the American Revolution in the Pennsylvania Hinterland, ed. Frantz, John B. (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1998); Greenberg, Douglas, Crime and Law Enforcement in the Colony of New York, 1691–1776 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1976); Griffin, Patrick, The People with No Name: Ireland’s Ulster Scots, America’s Scots Irish, and the Creation of a British Atlantic World, 1689–1764 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2001); Knouff, Gregory T., The Soldiers’ Revolution: Pennsylvanians in Arms and the Forging of Early American Identity (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004); Merritt, Jane T., At the Crossroads: Indians and Empires on a Mid-Atlantic Frontier, 1700–1763 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003); Pencak, William A. and Richter, Daniel K., Friends and Enemies in Penn’s Woods: Indians, Colonists, and the Racial Construction of Pennsylvania (University Park: Penn State University Press, 2004); Salinger, Sharon V., ‘To Serve Well and Faithfully’: Labour and Indentured Servants in Pennsylvania, 1682–1800 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987); and Slaughter, Thomas P., The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution (New York: Oxford University Press, 1986).\n\nThe scholarship on medieval and early modern justice is vast.

On torture, the law of proofs and the use of evidence, see Peters, Edward, Torture (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1985); Langbein, John H., Torture and the Law of Proof: Europe and England in the Ancien Régime (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977); Durand, Bernard and Otis-Cour, Leah (eds.), La torture judiciaire, 2 vols.
