        "text": "Speakers Stress Urgency of Protecting Civilians, Unrestricted Aid Delivery, Avoiding Regional Conflagration, in Day-Long Debate\n\nThe situation in the Middle East grows more dire by the hour, with the war in Gaza raging and risking spiralling throughout the region, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned the Security Council today, calling for humanitarian aid without restrictions and an immediate ceasefire.\n\n“At a crucial moment like this, it is vital to be clear on principles — starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians,” Secretary-General Guterres said, during a day-long ministerial debate on the Palestinian question, amid an escalation of Israel’s military offensive in Gaza. “Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians — or the launching of rockets against civilian targets.”\n\nRecalling his unequivocal condemnation of the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel, he called for the immediate release of the hostages. As well, he stressed the need for humanitarian aid to be delivered without restrictions, adding: “To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages, I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.”\n\nThe attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum, he noted, with the Palestinian people being subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation, during which they saw their land devoured by settlements; their economy stifled; their homes demolished; and their hopes for a political solution vanishing. However, the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. “And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” he said, emphasizing: “Even war has rules.” At this critical hour, he appealed to everyone to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther.\n\nTor Wennesland, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Process, said that Hamas’ abhorrent 7 October attack and Israel’s ongoing military operation in Gaza have taken a staggering toll on civilians. In the “sickening killing spree” by Hamas and other Palestinian militant-groups, more than 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, and 220 civilians, including women and children, as well as soldiers, were taken into Gaza as hostages. On that day, Israel’s Security Cabinet declared a state of war, with its forces commencing a massive bombardment of what they said were Hamas sites throughout Gaza, targeting some 5,000 locations. On 8 October, Israel’s Minister for Defense announced a complete siege of Gaza, blocking all entry of goods, including electricity, water, food and fuel.\n\nHe outlined the devastating impact of Israel’s ongoing air strikes, with Gaza’s Ministry of Health reporting more than 5,000 Palestinians killed, including over 1,100 women and 2,000 children, as well as journalists, medical workers and first responders. One million Palestinians have been displaced, with entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble and United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools and hospitals — many sheltering displaced Palestinians — having been hit. Warning of a significant risk of a regional spillover with the already worrying violence in the occupied West Bank having increased since the outbreak of war, he stressed the need to advance a negotiated peace that fulfils the long-held vision of two States, in line with UN resolutions, international law and previous agreements.\n\nAlso briefing the Council was Lynn Hastings, Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, who said that nearly 1.4 million people were displaced in the Gaza Strip, nearly 600,000 of whom are sheltering in UNRWA facilities “in increasingly dire conditions”. “There is nowhere to seek refuge in Gaza. When it comes to decisions on whether and where to flee, civilians are damned if they do and damned if they don’t,” she said. Citing figures from the Gaza Ministry of Housing, she said that at least 42 per cent of all housing units in the Gaza Strip have been either destroyed or damaged since 7 October, calling into question the ability of people to return to their homes.\n\nGaza remains under a full electricity blackout and hospitals are on the brink of collapse. Deliveries into the besieged city via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, while welcome, amounted to no more than 4 per cent of the daily average volume of commodities entering Gaza prior to current hostilities and do not include fuel. “No fuel means no functioning hospitals, no desalination of water and no baking,” she said. Pointing out that people are drinking saline groundwater, increasing the risk of cholera and other health issues, she called on Israel to bring water and electricity supplies back to pre-conflict levels and work with her teams to find a secure way of bringing fuel into Gaza. “It will be important also that the Israeli crossings for the movement of people and goods are opened,” she added.\n\nDuring the day-long debate, over 80 Heads of State, ministers, Government officials and representatives voiced alarm at the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, stressing the need for water, fuel and medicine to enter the besieged enclave. Many delegates underscored the urgent need to avoid a regional conflagration and to recommit to a two-State solution. Speakers, however, varied in emphasis, with some full-throatedly asserting Israel’s right to defend itself against an existential terror threat, while others deplored the blockade and the seemingly indiscriminate nature of the strikes and called for international law to be respected.\n\nRiad Al-Maliki, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Palestine, urged the Council and the international community to put an end to the ongoing massacres perpetrated by the occupying Power, Israel, against the Palestinian civilian population. “The Security Council has a duty to stop them. Continued failure at this Council is inexcusable,” he emphasized, calling on the 15-member organ to call for a ceasefire, secure humanitarian access in all parts of Gaza, end the forced displacement, provide international protection for the Palestinian people, and achieve justice through accountability.\n\n“The fate of the Palestinian people cannot continue to be dispossession, displacement, denial of rights and death,” he said, pointing out that over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed in the past two weeks, almost all of them civilians. Over 2 million Palestinians are on a survival mission every day and every night. Calling for an urgent end to the bloodshed, the only way to avoid an even greater humanitarian catastrophe and a regional spillover, he stressed: “Peace and security cannot and will not be achieved by crushing the skulls of infants or through “wiping out Gaza” or “turning it into a hell” or “reducing its area”. Nor will it materialize by arming thousands of terrorist settlers and encouraging them to continue their attacks against the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank.\n\nEli Cohen, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel, held up a collage with pictures of the hostages held by Hamas, stressing: “These children and babies have not caused evil, but they are victims of evil.” On 7 October, more than 1,500 terrorists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad infiltrated Israel and killed over 1,400 men, women and children. They went from house to house, slaughtering entire families in their beds, people on their way to synagogues, raping women, burning them alive, he said, adding: “Hamas are the new Nazis”, and the civilized world must stand united behind Israel to defeat them. The international community should call on Qatar, which finances Hamas, to enable the immediate release of the hostages held by the terrorists.\n\nWhile Israel gave Palestinians Gaza down to the last millimetre, instead of building hospitals, office buildings and commercial centres, they took the money to dig tunnels and to build rocket factories. “Listen to these monsters — the West is next,” he said, stating that the ongoing war is “not just Israel’s war. It’s the war of the free world.” He thanked the United States for standing with Israel during its darkest hour, adding that if all nations do not stand with Israel to “eliminate these monsters from the face of the Earth” after the most brutal and vicious terror attack in modern history, the United Nations will “have no moral justification to exist”.\n\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State of the United States, asserting that Israel has “the right and indeed the obligation to defend itself” against terrorism, said: “Every one of us has a stake and responsibility in defeating terror.” Palestinian civilians must be protected, and Hamas must cease to use them as human shields. Food, medicine and water must flow into Gaza, and humanitarian pauses must be considered, he said, noting that his country has prepared a resolution containing practical steps to address the crisis, building on the text by Brazil. Noting Iran’s support for Hamas and Hizbullah, he stated that if the country or its proxies attack United States personnel, the United States “will defend our people and our security swiftly and decisively”.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation, observing that “the scale of the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip has exceeded all of our worst imaginations”, said that the world is expecting a call for a swift and unconditional ceasefire from the Council, which is not in the current draft resolution from the United States. “Therefore, we don’t see any point in it, and we cannot support it.” However, his delegation has prepared an alternative draft resolution based on humanitarian language with important elements from the United States, Brazil and the first Russian Federation drafts, which he has requested to be put to a vote straight after the United States draft.\n\nMeanwhile, the speaker for Iran pointed out that the Council has faced obstacles in taking decisive action on the situation mainly due to the United States, which has vetoed over 40 resolutions. “The United States’ unwavering support for occupation and aggression has rendered it an active part of the problem,” he said, adding that it and other Western States attempted to shift the blame from the wrongdoer to the victim. International law and the UN Charter recognize the legitimate right to self-determination, as well as the right to self-defence for Palestinian people, “including resistance groups like Hamas”, he emphasized.\n\nThe delegate of Jordan, speaking for the Arab Group, said that the international community’s common humanity is being put to the test today, pointing to a spiral of violence based on despair over decades of occupation, injustice and oppression and “a raging war that is razing Gaza to the ground”. Calling on the Council to adopt a resolution for a ceasefire to stop the war, he noted that the 15-member organ was established to apply international law and maintain that there is no State above the law, “but it seems that Israel is above the law.”\n\nEgypt’s representative, deploring that “the war machine continues indiscriminately to claim lives without any distinction”, asserted that, given that 2.5 million civilians are being killed, starved and forcibly displaced, “silence in this case is tantamount to giving blessings”. The solution to the Palestinian question is not military action or forced displacement but granting the Palestinians their legitimate rights and letting them live in peace and safety on their own territories, he said, adding: “Egypt will not accept for the Palestinian people to be forcibly displaced and we will not accept any liquidation of the Palestinian question at Egypt’s expense.”\n\nFor her part, Switzerland’s delegate said that, as the depositary of the Geneva Conventions, her country prioritizes the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law, adding: “We are committed to a Council that, even in times of emergency — and especially in times of emergency — makes respect for international humanitarian law a priority.” She called for an investigation to be carried out into the incident at Al Ahli Arab Hospital, and for all violations of international law to be investigated, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.\n\nTHE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST, INCLUDING THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION\n\nBriefings\n\nANTÓNIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, warned that the situation in the Middle East grew more dire by the hour, with the war in Gaza raging, and risking spiralling throughout the region. “At a crucial moment like this, it is vital to be clear on principles — starting with the fundamental principle of respecting and protecting civilians,” he stressed. Recalling his unequivocal condemnation of the horrifying and unprecedented 7 October acts of terror by Hamas in Israel, he stated, “nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring and kidnapping of civilians — or the launching of rockets against civilian targets.” All hostages must be treated humanely and released immediately and without conditions, he said, noting the presence of members of their families.\n\nThe attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum, with the Palestinian people being subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation, during which they saw their land devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced; their homes demolished, and their hopes for a political solution vanishing, he went on. However, the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. “And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people,” he said, emphasizing: “Even war has rules.” All parties must uphold and respect their obligations under international humanitarian law; take constant care in the conduct of military operations to spare civilians; and respect and protect hospitals and respect the inviolability of United Nations facilities which today are sheltering more than 600,000 Palestinians.\n\nHe went on to voice deep alarm over the relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties and the mounting destruction of entire neighbourhoods, underscoring the importance of protecting civilians in any armed conflict. “Protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields,” he said, adding: “Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than 1 million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.” Voicing concern over the clear violations of international humanitarian law being witnessed in Gaza, he said, “Let me be clear: No party to an armed conflict is above international humanitarian law.” While some humanitarian relief is finally getting into Gaza, it represented “a drop of aid in an ocean of need”. United Nations fuel supplies in Gaza will run out in a matter of days, he said, adding: “That would be another disaster.”\n\nThe people of Gaza need continuous aid delivery at a level that corresponds to the enormous needs, he continued, adding: “That aid must be delivered without restrictions.” He commended his United Nations colleagues and humanitarian partners in Gaza risking their lives to provide aid to those in need, stressing: “To ease epic suffering, make the delivery of aid easier and safer, and facilitate the release of hostages, I reiterate my appeal for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.” Even in “this moment of grave and immediate danger”, he emphasized that a two-State solution is the only realistic foundation for a true peace and stability. Israelis must see their legitimate needs for security materialized, and Palestinians must see their legitimate aspirations for an independent State realized, in line with United Nations resolutions, international law and previous agreements.\n\nFinally, he called for human dignity to be upheld. Observing that polarization and dehumanization are being fuelled by a tsunami of disinformation, he said, “we must stand up to the forces of antisemitism, anti-Muslim bigotry and all forms of hate.” He noted that today is United Nations Day, marking 78 years since the Charter of the United Nations entered into force, reflecting Members’ shared commitment to advance peace, sustainable development and human rights. At this critical hour, he appealed to all to pull back from the brink before the violence claims even more lives and spreads even farther.\n\nTOR WENNESLAND, Special Coordinator for the Middle East Process, expressed his most sincere condolences to the thousands of families — in Israel, Palestine and across the globe — including the families of 35 UN staff killed in Gaza. “The abhorrent attack launched by Hamas on 7 October and Israel’s devastating, ongoing military operation in Gaza have taken a staggering toll on civilians and deeply shaken Israelis and Palestinians alike,” he said, pointing to the unprecedented events which risk expanding to the wider region. He recounted that on the morning of 7 October, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched a large-scale, complex assault on Israel, with an estimated 1,500 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants from Gaza infiltrating some 20 Israeli communities and military facilities in the Gaza periphery by land, sea and air, while thousands of rockets were launched towards central Israel, including Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\n\n“Testimony and evidence emerging from that tragic day reveal a sickening killing spree, designed to terrorize, with appalling scenes of brutality, massacres and hostage-taking, including against infants and young children,” he said, reporting that in all, Hamas and other Palestinian militant-groups killed over 1,400 Israelis and foreign nationals — the bloodiest attack in Israel’s history. At least 220 civilians, including women and children, as well as soldiers, were abducted and taken into the Gaza Strip as hostages, he added, welcoming the release of four hostages and recognizing the important role of Qatar in that regard. Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups in Gaza have continued to launch indiscriminate rocket fire from there into Israel, and to date, according to Israeli sources, some 7,700 rockets have been launched. “On the day of the attack, Israel’s Security Cabinet declared a state of war for the first time in over 50 years, with the aim of ‘the destruction of the military and governing capabilities of Hamas and Islamic Jihad’,” he recalled, adding that that same day, Israeli forces began a massive bombardment of what they said were Hamas sites throughout Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s air assault in the Strip has continued to date, with some 5,000 such sites targeted, according to the Israel Defense Forces, he reported, further recalling that, on 8 October, Israel’s Minister for Defense announced a complete siege of Gaza, blocking all entry of goods, including electricity, water, food and fuel. The air strikes have been devastating, he stressed, noting that, thus far, the Ministry of Health in Gaza has reported over 5,000 Palestinians killed, including over 1,100 women, 2,000 children as well as journalists, medical workers and first responders, with more than 15,000 injured. Over 1 million Palestinians have been displaced, he added, noting that the level of physical destruction has left entire neighbourhoods in rubble and critical infrastructure destroyed or damaged. Schools, including United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) schools, and hospitals — many sheltering displaced Palestinians — have been hit. Underlining the immense humanitarian impact, he welcomed Egypt’s facilitation to open the Rafah border crossing on 21 October and echoed the Secretary-General’s appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire.\n\n“The risk of a significant further deterioration of the situation in the occupied West Bank or spillover of the conflict in the region remains significant,” he warned, emphasizing that the already worrying violence in the occupied West Bank has increased since the outbreak of war. Israeli authorities have imposed widespread movement restrictions and conducted extensive arrests. High numbers of daily clashes and armed exchanges between Palestinians and Israeli security forces and settlers have been recorded, as well as settler-related violence and Palestinian attacks against Israelis. “Meanwhile, across the Blue Line, and amid heightened rhetoric from actors on the ground, there have been daily intermittent but intense exchanges of fire since 8 October,” he said, reporting that Hizbullah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have launched rockets and anti-tank missiles towards Israel, while Israel Defense Forces responded with artillery fire and air strikes, leading to casualties on both sides. On the Golan, the Israel Defense Forces responded on 10 October with artillery and mortar shells towards what they said were a number of launches from Syria towards Israel. The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) continues to engage with both parties, urging them to exercise maximum restraint and respect their obligations under the 1974 Agreement on the Disengagement of Forces, he said.\n\nHe and the Secretary-General have been pursuing any and every opportunity to address the situation on the ground and to prevent further civilian death and misery, he said, stressing: “It is critical, that we, as a united international community, employ all our collective efforts to end the bloodletting and prevent any further expansion of hostilities — including in the region.” He appealed to all relevant actors to act responsibly as “any miscalculation could have immeasurable consequences”. Pointing to the unresolved conflict and continued occupation, he said: “For 15 years, the population has been living under militant rule and a strict closure regime, as the Palestinian divide hardened. For a generation, hope has been lost and despair has prevailed for those who see prospects for a more peaceful future pulling still further away.” Stressing that only a political solution will move the international community forward, he said: “The steps we take to address this crisis must be implemented in a way that ultimately advances a negotiated peace that fulfils the legitimate national aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis — the long-held vision of two-States, in line with UN resolutions, international law and previous agreements.”\n\nLYNN HASTINGS, Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, briefed the Council that violence is at historically high levels on both sides. In the Gaza Strip, there are nearly 1.4 million displaced people, nearly 600,000 of which are sheltering in UNRWA facilities “in increasingly dire conditions”, she said. The average number of internally displaced people has reached more than two and one half times the capacity. “There is nowhere to seek refuge in Gaza. When it comes to decisions on whether and where to flee, civilians are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.” She noted that displaced families are reportedly returning to north Gaza because they cannot meet their basic needs including safety in the south.\n\nAccording to the Gaza Ministry of Housing, at least 42 per cent of all housing units in the Gaza Strip have been either destroyed or damaged since 7 October, calling into question the ability of people to return to their homes. Gaza remains under a full electricity blackout. Hospitals are on the brink of collapse. Doctors are forced to operate without anaesthesia. Since 7 October, 16 health workers in Gaza have reportedly been killed and 30 injured while on duty, she said.\n\nShe said that the agreement to allow essential humanitarian supplies into Gaza via the Rafah crossing with Egypt, has provided a glimmer of hope to people living in appalling conditions. But she added that these deliveries are a drop in the bucket compared to the vast scale of needs. They amount to no more than 4 per cent of the daily average volume of commodities entering Gaza prior to these hostilities. “Needs are now, of course, significantly greater.” Most crucially, these deliveries do not include fuel that is essential for powering the services needed for people to survive. Without fuel our humanitarian operation will stop, she said: “No fuel means no functioning hospitals, no desalination of water and no baking. Many people are drinking on saline groundwater, increasing the risks of diarrhoea, cholera, and other health issues.”\n\nShe called on Israel to bring water and electricity supplies back to pre-conflict levels and work with her teams to find a secure way of bringing fuel into Gaza. While the UN negotiates with the Government of Israel, it has 400,000 litres of trucks ready to go, which would provide fuel for approximately two and a half more days, she noted. For Gazans to get access to adequate food, water, medical care and other essential supplies, we must be able to scale up deliveries of all goods, and we must be able to replenish fuel supplies, she said. “It will be important also that the Israeli crossings for the movement of people and goods are opened.” She urged the Member States to redouble funding to UNRWA and other humanitarian agencies on the ground without delay and called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire “to ease this epic human suffering”.\n\nStatements\n\nRIAD AL-MALIKI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the State of Palestine, urged to stop the killing and massacres being committed against his people. He said that the ongoing massacres perpetrated by Israel, the occupying Power, against the Palestinian civilian population under its illegal occupation must be stopped. “The Security Council has a duty to stop them. The international community is obliged under international law to stop them. It is our collective human duty to stop them — now. Continued failure at this Council is inexcusable,” he emphasized, praising the efforts of the UN agencies and humanitarian staff on the ground, particularly UNRWA, and mourning the senseless killing of UNRWA staff and other humanitarian workers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics who were directly targeted by the ongoing barbarous aggression.\n\nHe stressed that over 2 million Palestinians are on a survival mission every day and every night. “By the time representatives are done delivering their speeches today, 150 Palestinians will have been killed, including 60 children,” he said, adding that, in the last two weeks, over 5,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 2,300 children and 1,300 women. “Almost all those killed by Israel are civilians,” he underscored, also spotlighting over 1 million Palestinians displaced and 170,000 housing units destroyed. He went on to state that only international law and peace are worthy of unconditional support. “More injustice and more killing will not make Israel safer,” he stressed, adding that no amount of weapons and no alliance will bring to it security, but only peace with Palestine and its people will.\n\n“The fate of the Palestinian people cannot continue to be dispossession, displacement, denial of rights and death,” he emphasized, adding that the freedom of the Palestinians is the condition of shared peace and security. “For those actively engaged to avoid an even greater humanitarian catastrophe and regional spillover, it must be clear that this can only be achieved by putting an immediate end to the Israeli war launched against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip,” he said, urging to stop the bloodshed. “Peace and security cannot and will not be achieved by crushing the skulls of infants” or through “wiping out Gaza” or “turning it into a hell” or “reducing its area”, as has been announced repeatedly by everyone who carries out these killing and destruction. It will also not materialize by arming thousands of terrorist settlers and encouraging them to continue their terror attacks against the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank, he stated.\n\nHe stressed that the urgent solution required from the Council today is to call for a ceasefire, an immediate cessation of the Israeli aggression, to work urgently to secure humanitarian access in all parts of the Gaza Strip, to end the forced displacement, to provide international protection for the Palestinian people and to achieve justice through accountability. He also called for the necessary practical measures to address the root causes of the issue and end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory with Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State as per the Council’s resolutions and as per the peace process and international law, and also empowering the Palestinians to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the return of refugees and self-determination, as per General Assembly resolution 194 (III). “All eyes are fixed on Gaza, do not fail the test,” he concluded.\n\nELI COHEN, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel, said that young babies and children are held in Gaza, a situation beyond imagination. These children and babies have not caused evil, but they are victims of evil, he said, adding that Saturday, 7 October — when more than 1,500 terrorists from Hamas and Islamic Jihad infiltrated Israel and killed more than 1,400 men, women and children, wounding more than 4,000 — will go down in history as a brutal massacre and a wakeup call to the free world. They went from house to house, slaughtering entire families and individuals in their beds, people on their way to synagogues, raping women, burning them alive, he said. “Hamas are the new Nazis,” he said, and the civilized world must stand united behind Israel to defeat them. Qatar, which finances Hamas, could influence and enable the immediate and unconditional release of the more than 220 hostages held by the terrorists, he said, adding that members of the international community should demand that Qatar does just that.\n\nIsrael gave Palestinians Gaza down to the last millimetre — there is no dispute regarding the land of Gaza, he said. But they took the money they received from the world and instead of building hospitals, office buildings and commercial centres, they took the money to dig tunnels and to build rocket factories, he said. “Listen to these monsters — the West is next,” he said, adding that the war which was imposed on Israel is “not just Israel’s war. It’s the war of the free world.” As for calls for proportionality or a ceasefire, what is the proportional response to the killing of babies, for the raping and burning of women, for beheading a child, he asked, adding that the proportional response to the 7 October massacre is the total destruction of Hamas. The free world should remember and never forget what happened on 7 October. Today this barbaric terror happened in Israel; tomorrow it will be on everyone’s doorstep, he said. “We have not chosen this war. But have no doubt. We are going to win it,” he said.\n\nAs Iran’s proxy, Hamas had three objectives for its barbaric attack: the murder of Jews, the kidnapping of hostages and the derailment of peace, stability and normalization in the region, he said, adding that Israeli citizens are under heavy missile and rocket fire from Gaza. Meanwhile, there is a clear attempt to escalate and provoke a war on Israel’s northern border where the Iran proxy Hezbollah is targeting Israeli cities, he said. Last week, cruise missiles were launched at Israel from Yemen. Have no illusion who is behind it or what is the reason, he said. The international community must understand who is under threat and who is the aggressor, he added. “The world now faces a clear choice of moral clarity: one can either be part of the civilized world or surrender to the forces of evil and barbarism,” he said. “There is no middle ground. No room for moral ambiguity.”\n\nHe thanked Member States who had designated Hamas a terror organization and called on others to do so immediately. He also thanked United States President Joseph R. Biden and United States Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken for showing moral clarity and standing with Israel at this dark hour. He said if all nations do not stand decisively and clearly with Israel to \"eliminate these monsters from the face of the Earth” after the most brutal and vicious terror attack in modern history, this will be “the darkest hour of the UN” and the United Nations will “have no moral justification to exist”.\n\nMAURO VIEIRA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Brazil, and President of the Council for October, speaking in his national capacity and echoing his President’s appeal that “there needs to be a minimum of humanity in the insanity of war”, said the situation is both a hostage and humanitarian crisis. While the world mourns the passing of innocent people including Brazilians, he said, it cannot condone acts of terrorism, as violence only breeds more violence. Brazil therefore calls for an immediate and unconditional release of all civilian hostages, particularly women and children. He added that dealing with the situation must include respect for human rights, humanitarian law and refugee law. Highlighting the situation with regards to power supply, health facilities, and access to drinking water, he said the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality, humanity, necessity and precaution must guide and inform all actions and military operations and urged the Council to not lose sight of the root causes of the conflict.\n\nHe said achieving peace requires strict adherence to international law as well as working towards the two-State solution. Israel must stop all settlement activities in occupied Palestinian territories including East Jerusalem. He underscored the importance of preserving the historical status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem and urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint. Brazil is committed to UNRWA, and believes diplomacy and dialogue remain as the most powerful assets. Decrying the fact that the Security Council has not passed a resolution on the Israeli-Palestinian situation since 2016, he urged the Council to not shy away from its responsibility in the situation. “We need solutions, no matter how politically difficult they may be. A peaceful and prosperous Middle East is to the benefit of all of us,” he said.\n\nANTONY J. BLINKEN, Secretary of State of the United States, said he had put forth a resolution containing practical steps to address the crisis, building on elements of the text by Brazil. First, it recognizes the right and imperative of States to defend themselves against terrorism, and condemns Hamas’ terrorist attack against Israel, during which, he said, “young people were gunned down with glee, young people were beheaded, parents were executed in front of their parents, and children were executed in front of their parents, and so many were taken hostage.” In this context, he said, “it must be asked: where is the outrage? Where is the explicit condemnation of these horrors?” The Council must denounce Member States arming, funding or training Hamas. Noting that the violence had affected United Nations employees, and many Member States, including Council Members, he said: “Every one of us has a stake and responsibility in defeating terror.”\n\nWhile Israel has “the right and indeed the obligation to defend itself”, Palestinian civilians must be protected, and Hamas must cease to use them as human shields, he continued. Food, medicine and water must flow into Gaza, and humanitarian pauses must be considered. On that, he highlighted efforts by his Government’s recently appointed Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues, David Satterfield, and the United States’ additional $100 million aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, bringing the total aid provided this year to Palestinians to $1.6 billion. “A civilian is a civilian is a civilian, no matter their nationality, gender, or faith,” he said. He welcomed the release of four hostages and implored all Council members to use their leverage to secure the release of the 200 hostages still in the grip of Hamas. Member States must also send a united message to those considering opening another front to the conflict; “Don’t throw fuel on the fire,” he added.\n\nPointing to Iran’s support to Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, he stressed: “The United States does not seek conflict with Iran but if it or its proxies attack United States personnel, we will defend our people and our security swiftly and decisively.” The two-State solution is the only way to break out of the cycle of violence and achieve broader regional security, he said, adding: “Two paths lie before us — one path is offered by Hamas, and it leads to death, destruction, and darkness. The other is the path to greater peace, normalization and integration; the path to the Palestinians’ right to self-determination and a state of their own.” Hamas does not get to choose the path the world takes, he stressed.\n\nCATHERINE COLONNA, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, said: “It is our duty to condemn unambiguously Hamas’ terrorist attack and that of other terrorist groups against Israel.” Hamas’ 7 October attack also struck France, she said, noting that 30 French people died and another nine of its nationals are missing and reportedly being held hostage. She called once again for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. She affirmed her country’s solidarity with Israel and underscored its right to defend itself and protect its people, while noting that Israel must do so while respecting international law, in particular international humanitarian law. Hamas in no way represents the Palestinians, she emphasized, underscoring that it is the duty of the international community, including Israel, to guarantee the ongoing provision to civilians in Gaza of basic goods: water, food, medicine and fuel. She urged the international community to guarantee safe, swift, unimpeded and sustainable humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip, and uphold international humanitarian law and its principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.\n\nFrance, like the European Union, has increased its humanitarian assistance, she said, noting that, since the start of the crisis, it has mobilized an additional €20 million in supplementary humanitarian aid for the population of Gaza, through UNRWA, the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and non-governmental organizations. It has also chartered a special flight with emergency humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, to assist Egypt’s efforts, adding that her country’s total aid to the Palestinians will reach €100 million in 2023. Stressing that certain stakeholders must refrain from benefiting from the current situation, she cautioned them against any regional escalation that would drag the region into a downward spiral. Pointing to the well-known conditions for lasting peace, she stressed that the only viable solution is the two-State solution and called on the Council to fully exercise its responsibility to that end.\n\nRÉGIS MICHEL M. ONANGA NDIAYE, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Gabon, urged captors to release all hostages. He said the siege of Gaza “is pushing the levels human distress to an unbearable scale” and called for health facilities and personnel to be protected. The recent delivery of aid is “a glimmer of hope for the millions of people in Gaza clamped within the vice-like grip of the warring parties”, he said. He welcomed efforts by Egypt and the United States to this end and appealed for the continuous opening of the Rafah crossing point. He regretted that the Council had not reached consensus on resolutions on the conflict. “Gabon believes that it is high time for humanity to prevail over political and geopolitical alliances.”\n\nHe said the continued policy of expanding settlements, demolitions and expulsions — particularly in the occupied West Bank including East Jerusalem — the blockade of Gaza, religious provocations, terrorist attacks on Israeli soil, the recurrence of bellicose speech and the freezing of tax funds collected by Israel from the Palestinian Authority on its behalf, are major obstacles to building a just and lasting peace. The manifest violations of international law and Security Council resolutions, notably resolutions 1860 (2009) and 2334 (2016), must urgently cease. He reaffirmed his country’s commitment to the two-State solution.\n\nIGLI HASANI, Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of Albania, said that his country stands with Israel, like with every other nation under attack in its legitimate right to self-defence in accordance with international humanitarian law. “In such difficult and defining moments, Israel and its people need the support of the community of the free nations in responding to terrorists who have committed horrible crimes and continue to question its right to exist,” he stressed, adding that innocent lives matter equally, be they Israeli or Palestinian. Hamas, their leaders who live a comfortable life outside Gaza and their supporters knew very well what they were doing when they unleashed “the beasts to kill, burn, massacre and kidnap everyone they could,” he said, emphasizing that their hope and their win would be to make the world turn against Israel. There is only one party that is rejoicing with what is happening. It is the country known to sponsor of terrorism, in Gaza, in West Bank, in Yemen, in Lebanon, in Syria, anywhere they can, he said without naming the country.\n\nHe was worried by a frightening increase, to very dangerous levels, of antisemitism — fuelled by hatred, misinformation and disinformation — particularly through social media, urging the world to “not stay indifferent in face of calls and behaviours that come from the Nazi playbooks.” He welcomed arrangements made so far for humanitarian convoys into Gaza, stressing “efforts must continue and diplomacy must always prevail”, and commending the efforts of Egypt, United States, Israel and the UN Secretary-General in this regard. Welcoming the release of hostages with the assistance of Qatar, he said: “Israel needs and deserves security; Palestinians need and deserve their State.” Albania reiterates its support for two States for two peoples, he underscored.\n\nIAN BORG, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs and Trade of Malta, acknowledged Israel’s right to self-defence while also emphasizing that Israel must oblige by international humanitarian law. He welcomed the release of four hostages and called on Hamas to release the remaining captives safely and unconditionally without delay. He went on to express grave concern over the current humanitarian situation in Gaza. Thousands of Palestinians have been killed, he said, and condemned all attacks against civilians, medical and humanitarian workers, United Nations personnel as well as religious places and civilian infrastructure. He called for an independent investigation into the blast at Al Ahli Arab Hospital on 18 October. He expressed deep concern over Israel’s decision to cut off water, electricity, food and fuel to Gaza. This action is resulting in dire humanitarian consequences for the civilian population and will inevitably lead to a public health catastrophe, he said.\n\nHe stressed the need for unimpeded, sustained delivery of humanitarian aid through the Rafah crossing and the establishment of humanitarian corridors and commended efforts by the United Nations, Egypt and the United States, strongly reiterating a call for the establishment of an immediate humanitarian pause. “The legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people should not be confused with the extremist ideology of Hamas,” he said. “It is crucial that this distinction is made clear to all to avoid further inflammatory polarization and potentials of regional escalation.” He added that since 7 October, killing and forced displacement of Palestinians has sharply increased, including through settler violence and hundreds of arrests.\n\nMAYA TISSAFI, State Secretary of Switzerland, said that, as the depositary of the Geneva Conventions, her country prioritizes the protection of civilians and respect for international humanitarian law. “We are committed to a Council that, even in times of emergency — and especially in times of emergency — makes respect for international humanitarian law a priority,” she said. Switzerland calls for an immediate and unconditional release of all hostages in Gaza as it recognizes Israel’s legitimate concern for national defence and security. “We remind the parties of the binding nature of all its rules, without exception, in particular the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution in the conduct of hostilities. Joining the Secretary-General to unequivocally condemn the incident at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, she called for an investigation to be carried out so that the facts can be clarified, also stressing the need to protect civilians and investigate all violations of international law, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.\n\nShe said her country is rapidly mobilizing additional funds for ICRC and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. It is imperative that adequate volumes of aid enter Gaza and that rapid, full, safe and unhindered access is allowed and facilitated in line with international humanitarian law. Humanitarian pauses are also necessary. She further called on the Council to “exert our influence on the parties to prevent an even more serious escalation, or even a regionalisation of the conflict”.\n\nTOM TUGENDHAT, Minister of State for Security of the United Kingdom, observing that the events of the past 17 days have shocked all those who value the dignity of human life, said: “Israel is a nation in mourning. It is also a nation under attack.” The violence did not end on 7 October, he said, noting terrorist rockets still raining down on Israeli towns, and around 200 of its citizens are held hostage in Gaza, some of whom are British citizens. Palestinians are suffering, too, he said, noting that thousands have been killed in the conflict, while more than 1 million have been displaced. “We know that Hamas are using innocent Palestinian civilians as human shields; they have embedded themselves in civilian communities,” he said, adding that the group cares more about the opinions of their paymasters in Tehran than their fellow citizens. The United Kingdom stands with Israel in defending itself against terror.\n\nHe underscored the urgent need for sustained, unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza, for civilians to receive life-saving support. The recent opening of the Rafah crossing to aid trucks, while welcome, is not enough. He echoed the Secretary-General’s call for sustainable and adequate humanitarian access, observing the desperate need for “a constant stream” of water, fuel, medicine and food. The United Kingdom has committed $37 million of extra support for civilians in Gaza. The conflict must not engulf the wider region, he said, noting attacks by Hizbullah to the north of Israel and rising tensions in the West Bank, among other worrying signs. “Now is the time for dogged diplomacy that recognizes the hard realities on the ground and delivers help now,” he stressed. Voicing support for a negotiated settlement leading to a safe and secure Israel living alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian State, he stressed: “Hope and humanity must win out.”\n\nREEM EBRAHIM AL HASHIMY, Minister of State for International Cooperation of the United Arab Emirates, stressed that every diplomatic effort must be made, and all capabilities harnessed to achieve an immediate and sustainable ceasefire. Pointing to growing tensions in the region, including in southern Lebanon, the Red Sea and the occupied Syrian Golan, she warned that “an unchecked slide into regional war risks ominous outcomes” that will threaten regional security and affect stability around the world. As such, regional and international efforts must focus on de-escalation and restoring calm as soon as possible, she stressed, welcoming the 21 October Cairo Summit for Peace. Immediate, safe, sustainable and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid must be allowed to enter the Gaza Strip in a manner that meets the basic needs, she stressed, voicing appreciation for the support to aid delivery of Egypt and the UN. She pointed out, however, that the small number of trucks that have crossed into the Gaza Strip in recent days does not meet the massive needs on the ground and represent only 4 per cent of the volume of commodities that used to enter before the outbreak of this crisis.\n\nStressing that the attacks launched by Hamas on 7 October are barbaric and heinous, she demanded that the group release hostages immediately and unconditionally. Hamas’ crimes against civilians can never justify the policy of collective punishment towards the Gaza Strip, she underscored, stressing that Israel must respect its obligations under international humanitarian law and ensure the protection of civilians. She reiterated once again her country’s unequivocal rejection of Israel’s order to evacuate more than 1 million people from northern to southern Gaza and demanded that those orders be cancelled. Stressing that the Gaza Strip has been under siege for more than 17 years, she asked: “Should we leave the people of the region to live in a series of wars, violence and hatred accumulated from one generation to the next?” She urged the adoption of a resolution calling for an immediate and sustainable humanitarian ceasefire, and serious work after that to find a just, lasting and comprehensive solution to the conflict that allows both people to live in lasting peace and security.\n\nVASSILY A. NEBENZIA (Russian Federation) said “the scale of the humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip has exceeded all of our worst imaginations.” We all face the more urgent challenge to stop the violence and ensure the supply of humanitarian assistance to Gazans who face arbitrary strikes by Israel and violations of international humanitarian law. He noted that the Russian Federation draft resolution for a ceasefire was not passed earlier in October, with ongoing violence as the result. The world is expecting a call for a swift and unconditional ceasefire from the Council, which is not in the current draft resolution from the United States. “Therefore, we don’t see any point in it and we cannot support it.” For the Council to carry out its main purpose, the Russian Federation has prepared an alternative draft resolution based on humanitarian language with important elements from the United States, Brazil and the first Russian Federation drafts. He asked the Presidency of the Council to put it to a vote straight after the United States draft.\n\nHERNÁN PÉREZ LOOSE (Ecuador) praised the efforts of the Secretary-General and others who have made the delivery of humanitarian aid possible, as well as the release of some hostages, and demanded that all hostages taken by Hamas be released immediately and unconditionally. He noted that the situations in the West Bank and on the border between Lebanon and Israel are particularly disquieting. “This Security Council must not become an arena for rivalries, but rather, it must be a space for building peace, and peace in the Middle East is one of the principle pending questions that we have,” he said, underscoring that almost eight decades of conflict and thousands of deaths are the clearest evidence that violence is not the solution. He reiterated that the only way to end this conflict is through a peaceful, negotiated, definitive and just solution for the parties, with the existence of two States, Palestine and Israel, on the basis of the 1967 borders and the relevant resolutions.\n\nZHANG JUN (China) said more than 2 million lives in Gaza hang by a thread and called on the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire. Whatever the justification, if the fighting in Gaza is allowed to continue, the result will not be a military victory for either side but a catastrophe that consumes the entire region, he said. The Security Council must do everything in its power to achieve peace rather implicitly green-light further escalation, he said. He appreciated the efforts by Egypt, other countries and Secretary-General António Guterres to help open humanitarian corridors, though he warned that assistance is just a drop in the bucket. The Security Council must use its most unequivocal language to require the occupying Power to immediately lift the siege of Gaza, restore water, electricity and fuel supplies, and stop the collective punishment of the population in Gaza, he said, urging Israel to stop air strikes and ensure safe aid delivery and the lifting of the evacuation order for northern Gaza.\n\nISHIKANE KIMIHIRO (Japan), condemning the attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian militants, called for an immediate release of hostages and a redoubling of diplomatic efforts to contain the conflict and prevent a regional spillover. All parties must comply with international law and address the humanitarian situation in Gaza while also protecting medical and humanitarian personnel. Japan supports any diplomatic activities that can lead towards de‑escalation and an improvement of the humanitarian situation, including the Cairo Summit for Peace and ongoing negotiations to free hostages. He also called for humanitarian corridors to be set up to continue the delivery of life-saving assistance to the Palestinian people in Gaza. He urged the Council to act with unity, saying that its silence is unacceptable and emphasizing that the conflict demonstrates the importance of the two-State solution. “What we need now is to help innocent lives, not political gain,” he said.\n\nCAROLYN OPPONG-NTIRI (Ghana), noting that today is United Nations Day, said it is regrettable that the Council has failed to reach consensus on a comprehensive humanitarian response. She recalled that, after the 7 October attacks launched by Hamas in southern Israel and the abduction of Israeli citizens and nationals of other countries, Ghana condemned the actions of Hamas and called on the group to cease its attacks and release the hostages without condition. Commending the efforts of the Secretary-General, the leaders of Egypt, Israel and the United States, and the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator in negotiating the opening of the Rafah border crossing, she appealed to the Government of Israel to allow more humanitarian aid deliveries, especially fuel, which is badly needed to power Gaza’s health centres and water-treatment plants.\n\nPEDRO COMISSÁRIO AFONSO (Mozambique) said the situation in the Gaza Strip since 7 October has been concerning, and remains volatile and dangerous, adding: “It is a humanitarian crisis that has been ongoing for years, with many innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.” Associating himself with the Council’s efforts to protect civilians and respect international law, he underscored the urgent need to open humanitarian access corridors, and ensure access to water, electricity, food and medicine. All parties must de-escalate tension, halt the attacks, stop the suffering in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Gaza Strip and allow humanitarian access. “The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is unfolding before our eyes,” he said, reiterating the importance of protecting civilians and civilian infrastructure. The Council must work together to contain the conflict, end the cycle of violence and prevent a regional escalation. “We must support the strengthening of the Palestinian Authority, which represents the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people,” he added.\n\nAYMAN SAFADI, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of Jordan, speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, noted that the international community’s common humanity and moral values are being put to the test today, pointing to a spiral of violence based on despair over decades of occupation, injustice and oppression and “a raging war that is razing Gaza to the ground”. The Security Council was established for this moment, he said, to apply international law and stop the war and violence and maintain that there is no State above the law regardless of its might or its barbarism. “But it seems that Israel is above the law,” he emphasized. It is violating international law without deterrence and running roughshod over Council resolutions, building settlements without any consequences and confiscating Palestinian land without accountability. The Security Council did not even call for a ceasefire in the current war in Gaza, which is killing 14 Palestinian civilians every hour, he added.\n\n“Enough with the war,” he declared. Addressing those who think they are serving Israel in its war against Gaza, he said: “Your position that is supportive of Israel will not serve Israel and will not convince Palestinians.” Condemning the killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians and calling for liberty for everyone is a very important humanitarian position and one that his bloc has taken, he said. Any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians inside or outside their occupied land is a war crime, he stressed, warning that his bloc will confront any forced displacement to neighbouring countries. Detailing the death and destruction in Gaza, he stressed: “Israel will enjoy security when Palestinians enjoy security.” The Security Council must adopt a resolution for a ceasefire to stop the war, condemn the killing of civilians on both sides, and prevent the starvation of Palestinians and their collective punishment. Moreover, it must take a clear stand that reassures 2 billion Arabs and Muslims that international law will be applied.\n\nHe urged the international community to work together to return to a true peace process and serious negotiations based on international law and Council resolutions to end the occupation and achieve a comprehensive, durable and just peace on the basis of the two-State solution within a set time frame and with international guarantees for peace for Palestinians, Israelis and the whole region.\n\nSAMEH SHOUKRY, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, said the “Palestinian territories are going through horrific developments”, noting that more than 5,000 people had been killed there, including over 2,000 children. “The war machine continues indiscriminately to claim lives without any distinction,” he said. “It is shameful that some continue to justify what is happening, citing the right to self-defence and resisting terrorism,” he said, asking: “What right justifies not distinguishing between an enemy to be targeted and unarmed civilians destined to live for centuries in this particular part of their homeland and to be subjected to a blockade?” Two and a half million civilians are being killed, starved and forcibly displaced. He asserted that “silence in this case is tantamount to giving blessings,” not naming things by their names, and merely calling for respecting international humanitarian law without describing what is happening as a violation of the law, is tantamount to participating in the crimes.\n\nHe condemned the targeting of any unarmed civilians by any party or capturing them to use as a bargaining chip, adding that “humanity is indivisible and not selective”. Some want to play the blame game, but today’s situation did not come from nothing, rather from accumulated practices and policies with the goal of entrenching an illegal occupation, usurping the land from its rightful owners and imposing a new demographic reality. The solution to the Palestinian question is not military action or forced displacement, he said, rather the only solution is justice, by granting the Palestinians their legitimate rights and letting them live in peace and safety on their own territories. “Egypt will not accept for the Palestinian people to be forcibly displaced and we will not accept any liquidation of the Palestinian question at Egypt’s expense,” he said. What has the world gained as a result of deferring the solution — more tension and pain in occupied Palestine, in Israel, and in the whole region.\n\nHe regretted that the Council had not been able to adopt a resolution for a ceasefire and was surprised that its draft resolutions don’t include a ceasefire, without which the region might head to a dangerous juncture. Some of what’s being tabled amounts to a new attempt to justify the continuation of this war, he said, adding that this is not in line with the UN Charter and the Council’s mandate. He added that his country has tried to provide a platform in Cairo this month to contain the situation and offer a political framework, with a non-politicized approach taking into account the urgent humanitarian dimension of this catastrophe, aiming to achieve consensus on de-escalation to prevent more destruction and revive the peace process.\n\n“We will not rest until this war ends,” he said, regretting the double standards applied to the humanitarian dimensions. He called for a sustainable, immediate ceasefire without conditions; an end to practices aimed at forcibly displacing Palestinians either within or outside their lands; international protection for unarmed Palestinian people and ensuring safe, sustained humanitarian aid to Gaza. He also called for Israel bearing its responsibility as the occupying Power, a process for a Palestinian State, and the Council investigating violations of international law and international humanitarian law.\n\nPÉTER SZIJJÁRTÓ, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Hungary, said that global security has been in its worst shape since the cold war. There can be no excuse for launching thousands of rockets on the territory of a sovereign country and killing a large number of innocent people by such an attack, he stressed. “We do find unacceptable all kinds of attempts which aim at explaining this phenomenon or aim at putting it into any kind of context or aim at finding any excuse for such a barbarian attack,” he said, underscoring that Israel has the right to protect itself and that it is the interest of the entire international community that such an attack will never take place again. “What has to happen now is a fight against terror and fight against a terrorist organization”, he emphasized, calling for this fight against terror not to turn into a war between nations.\n\nCommending the United States, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for facilitating the Abraham Accords, he said that he is counting a lot on the Gulf countries and Arab countries in the region not to let all these achievements be lost. “It’s scary to see images from the streets and squares of some European countries and here in North America,” he said, adding that he saw terrorist organizations being praised on the streets and antisemitism on the rise. “This is a consequence of the massive illegal migratory flows which have hit Europe in the recent years and which have created parallel societies in many European countries,” he stated, stressing that it is unimaginable that any authority in Hungary would approve any rally to praise terror attacks or organizations.\n\nNALEDI PANDOR, Minister for International Relations of South Africa, said the ultimate solution to the conflict is to finalize the two-State solution and called for an immediate ceasefire, the opening of a humanitarian corridor and, most urgently, on all parties to desist from fuelling this patently unjust war and the suffering of innocents. She expressed condolences to the people of Palestine and Israel for the lives lost as well as horror at the blatant targeting of civilians, a clear violation of international humanitarian law, the Geneva Convention and its Protocols. Both Hamas and Israel have committed these violations, she said. The killing of civilians and destruction of civilian infrastructure in Gaza by Israeli forces goes against the tenets of international law. There is an added obligation on an occupying Power, including a prohibition against collective punishment, she said, adding South Africa was also concerned about the actions of Hamas, which also targeted non-combatants.\n\nFAISAL BIN FARHAN A.F. AL FURHAN AL-SAUD, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia, said that today’s meeting is being held under painful circumstances. Condemning the targeting of civilians, he called for an end of the escalation of military operations, adding that the blockade and hostilities are causing suffering for the Palestinians. The international community’s failure to end this collective punishment by the Israeli occupation forces on Gaza “will not bring us any closer to security and stability”. The Security Council’s silence is unacceptable, he said, adding that the organ bears responsibility for its complacency, given the cost of the conflict in lives and property as well as the threat to the security and stability of the region. The Council’s inability to carry out its role, delaying arrival at a resolution to the crisis, casts doubt on its credibility, he said.\n\nThe international community must take a firm stand to end the military operations, guarantee the protection of civilians and delivery of humanitarian assistance, and prevent an expansion of the cycle of conflict, he said. The policy of double standards and selectivity in abiding by United Nations laws and resolutions “has dangerous repercussions that go beyond the conflict”, impacting international law and the ability to maintain international peace and security. He warned that this ongoing escalation and a lack of accountability will lead to further violence, destruction and extremism — and this as a result of UN resolutions not being respected or implemented. Ignoring the reasons behind the conflict will not lead to a just solution, and therefore a credible peace process must be revived. Saudi Arabia hopes that the region will enjoy peace and guaranteed prosperity for succeeding generations, and a peace that guarantees a two-State solution and establishment of a Palestinian State, he said.\n\nJEAN ASSELBORN, Minister for Foreign and European Affairs for Luxembourg, stressing that nothing can justify the atrocities committed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists against Israeli civilians on 7 October, condemned these acts in the strongest terms, and supported Israel’s right to defend itself under the framework of international law. However, he quoted United States President Joseph R. Biden’s message to Israel to “not be guided by rage”. The population is not Hamas, and cannot be held responsible or collectively punished for crimes committed by terrorists. Noting the Secretary-General’s call for a ceasefire, he said that humanitarian pauses can be considered a first step, allowing for the delivery of humanitarian aid, and facilitating the immediate and unconditional release of hostages. He welcomed the first deliveries of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip in recent days, commending the United Nations, Egypt and the United States for facilitating the safe passage of shipments.\n\nHowever, these deliveries did not include fuel, which is essential for hospital and water desalination, he continued. United Nations facilities, hospitals and schools must never be targeted, and UNRWA, which is sheltering 600,000 Palestinian people, must urgently receive support. On that, he highlighted his country’s provision of an additional €2.5 million to UNRWA, ICRC and WFP, bringing its 2023 contribution to €12 million. Noting his visits to Gaza over his time as Minister, he described it as an “open-sky prison”, with Gazans doubly suffering from Israel’s blockade and bombing and Hamas using them as human shields. A regional conflagration must be avoided, he said, noting that an alarming uptick in violence by settlers in the West Bank was leading to the forced transfer of Palestinians. The Council and the General Assembly have a key responsibility in avoiding an escalation of the situation, he said, voicing support for a two-State solution with 1967 borders, in line with Council resolution 2334 (2016).\n\nRETNO LESTARI PRIANSARI MARSUDI, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, condemned the continued unprecedented aggression against civilians by Israel in Gaza. Pointing to the humanitarian catastrophe and crimes against humanity, she asked: “Are we going to stay idle?” She further asked the Council when it will exercise its responsibility to stop the war, create a ceasefire, open access to humanitarian assistance, call for the immediate release of civilians and stop the illegal occupation of Israel. Every second wasted due to political disagreement represents a humanitarian defeat for the Palestinians and creates further instability for the world, she stressed. Her country will not waste a single second in harnessing global support for immediate action through the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Group of Eight meetings, pushing for a united voice to urge the cessation of violence and focus on the urgent humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nShe urged the Council’s united call for an immediate ceasefire, noting that blanket support shown to one side so far has led to the disproportionate use of force, violations of international law and impunity. The Council must urge immediate, safe and unhindered humanitarian passage and respect for humanitarian law. She further called on the Council to move beyond politics and bring back humanity to the 15-member organ. “Please use your great power to be more human,” she urged, emphasizing that Palestinians deserve equal rights and treatment. The Council holds great responsibility and with it great responsibility to address the current situation in Gaza, address the root cause and ensure a path to the two-State solution, she added.\n\nFRANCISCO ANDRÉ, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Portugal, said he recognized Israel’s right to eliminate the threat posed by Hamas. But he added that Israel’s actions must strictly respect international humanitarian law. Hostages must be released immediately and without preconditions, he said, and added that the humanitarian consequences of the war must be addressed. “The death toll on both sides is staggering.” The increasing Palestinian civilian suffering is not acceptable, he said, noting that the basic tenets of international humanitarian law are not compatible with shutting off electricity, food, water and fuel from Gaza. “Collective punishment of civilian populations is contrary to international humanitarian law,” he said, and called for aid to reach Gaza.\n\n“This is a moment of tragedy and crisis, and we must transform it into a moment of hope and opportunity,” he said, adding that to do so we must recognize the nature of the complexity of the issues at stake. He noted that Palestine has still not been granted statehood and millions of Palestinians remain displaced. He urged for the non-violent political path to be followed and for the avoidance of a broader conflict. He welcomed international and bilateral involvement to avoid spillover. Once this crisis is over we cannot go back to the status quo, he said, calling for the two-State solution to be fulfilled.\n\nAHMED ATTAF, Minister for Foreign Affairs and National Community Abroad of Algeria, said that the current events are happening due to the complete marginalization and devaluation of the Palestinian cause and the unjustifiable tolerance and absolute immunity of the Israeli occupation. Since the 1990s the Palestinian cause has not seen any serious initiatives, he stressed, citing the paralysis of the international diplomacy and the dangerous illusion that peace, security and stability are being sought in the Middle East. Reminding about the annexation of the Palestinian land and control of over 78 per cent of the West Bank, he said this has negative effects on the two States project. “We would also recall that this immunity — according to Israel — has given rise to more racist policies that we reject, the policies that reach the occupied city of Jerusalem and seek to change the legal status quo,” he stated, adding that this immunity has led to more deaths, forced displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians and the destruction of their infrastructure and housing over the last two decades.\n\nThe Palestinian people face a difficult choice — either leaving the territory and their rights behind or ethnic cleansing and eradication of the national Palestinian State project, he stressed, adding that these events put the UN to a significant test. He called on the Council to lift the unjust blockade of the Gaza Strip because this is a war crime and a crime against humanity; to put an end to the senseless bombing that has led to thousands of innocent victims, also a war crime and a crime of genocide; end the forced displacement of the Palestinian people which can be seen as a crime of ethnic cleansing; and to allow humanitarian assistance to be delivered to Gaza.\n\nAHMET YILDIZ, Deputy Foreign Minister for Middle East and North Africa Affairs of Türkiye, said the 2.5 million people in Gaza are under constant and indiscriminate bombing. As of today, the Israeli military has killed close to 2,000 children, he said, emphasizing there can be no justification for the collective punishment of civilians in Gaza. “Some prefer to look the other way in the face of such atrocities. They prefer not to speak about crimes against humanity and war crimes. They prefer to pretend Palestinian people are just numbers and have no souls and no rights,” he said. “This is absolutely unacceptable. This is sheer hypocrisy and an embodiment of the double standards that constitute the very root causes of the problem we are facing today”. He called for an immediate, unconditional and lasting ceasefire and said unhindered humanitarian assistance to Gaza must be ensured, expressing hope the Security Council will continue to help keep the Rafah crossing open.\n\nHe said the two parties — Israel and Palestine — must be brought together to agree on a two-State solution. It is true that such a vision for a settlement has remained elusive, despite serious attempts, he said, adding that what is required now is a mechanism to monitor, verify and, when needed, enforce the obligations of the parties — otherwise what is written on paper runs the risk of remaining just that. The responsibility of stopping this bloodshed and starting a meaningful process for peace lies first and foremost with the Security Council, he said, adding that the last time the Security Council spoke with one voice on this issue was in January 2009 when resolution 1860 (2009) was adopted. He urged the Council to put aside its indifference to this carnage which can have no place in the twenty-first century.\n\nANNALENA BAERBOCK, Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said that to find a way out of this crisis, everyone must seek to understand each other’s pain. She speaks as the Foreign Minister of a country that bears historic responsibility for the worst imaginable crime, the crime committed by Nazi Germany: The systematic murder of 6 million Jews, with the aim of eradicating Jewish life from Europe. “Never again; to me as a German, that means that we will not rest knowing that the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors are now being held hostage by terrorists in Gaza,” she said. “For Germany, Israel’s security is non-negotiable.” Like any other State, Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism within the framework of international law. Addressing the plight of the Palestinians in no way contradicts this clear and unwavering stance.\n\nThe fight is against Hamas and not against civilians, and it must be carried out in line with humanitarian law, with the greatest possible consideration for civilians in Gaza, she said. Germany has increased its humanitarian aid to Gaza by €50 million and is advocating for the introduction of humanitarian windows so people in need can get help. “In doing so, we must not be fooled by Hamas’ playbook,” she said, pointing to their use of women and children in Gaza as human shields, and their hiding of weapons under supermarkets, apartment blocks and even hospitals. The rules of the Charter and international humanitarian law should guide the international community’s work for a new tomorrow. This means moving towards a meaningful peace process that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live side-by-side in peace and security, in two independent States.\n\nHANKE GERDINA JOHANNETTE BRUINS SLOT, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Netherlands, said the horrendous violence carried out by Hamas was an attempt to destroy people’s souls, a threat which is far from over. The international community therefore needs to stand united in supporting Israel and its right to self-defence. She noted that the use of force in self-defence must be necessary and proportionate with international humanitarian law, and respected by all parties. To achieve the protection of civilians, humanitarian workers and United Nations premises and personnel requires restraint on the part of Israel in the use of force. Highlighting the catastrophic situation in Gaza, she said “we cannot afford to lose more time”, as a sustained flow of humanitarian aid is needed, including fuel and an immediate restoration of water supplies. Humanitarian pauses and a permanent humanitarian corridor are crucial to not only allow free passage, but also to prevent the situation from getting much worse.\n\n“The Netherlands will step up its humanitarian response,” she said, and announced an additional commitment of €10 million for immediate humanitarian relief, of which €8 million is for UNRWA, aimed at improving the living conditions for Palestinian citizens, including mental health and psychosocial support. “We are also extremely concerned about the conflict spreading beyond the borders of Israel and Gaza,” she said, and called on all parties to prevent this from happening, including into the West Bank. Her country calls for an immediate and unconditional release of hostages. She recalled that at the United Nations’ founding, “the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was one of the first major crises calling for urgent attention. Today, more than 75 years later, the need to find a solution to this conflict is more pressing and crucial than ever.” Her country calls on the Security Council to provide the leadership required to manage and contain this crisis.\n\nELTAHER SALEM ELBAOUR, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation for Libya, condemned Israel’s brutal aggression against the Gaza Strip, which has claimed the lives of more than 5,000 people, in addition to the hundreds still trapped under rubble, whom first responders are unable to reach due to the shelling. “This is the objective of the Zionist occupation forces: the genocide of the residents of Gaza City,” he stressed. “No media in the world can falsify what happened in Gaza,” he said, alluding to the bombing of Al Ahli Arab hospital, which claimed 500 lives. To “so-called civilized nations” who voice support for the aggression, exposing the falsehood behind slogans about human rights, he asked: “What kind of message are you sending the world? The world is fully aware of what is happening in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Enough double standards; enough falsifying facts.”\n\nHis country cannot accept the pretence that what preceded the crisis on 7 October — violations against Palestinians and the desecration of holy sites in Jerusalem — were perpetrated by unknown individuals, he continued, adding: “You can’t ask us to stay silent or support the aggression against civilians.” International resolutions and humanitarian laws are binding moral agreements, he said, adding: “Double standards in identifying civilians who should be protected at the international level, or provided military support, is unacceptable and demeans civilian lives.” He called for an immediate end of Israel’s aggression under the pretext of protecting civilians, noting that he has seen, on the news, the occupying forces’ declarations of their wish to perpetrate genocide against Gazan residents. The international community should support Palestine’s right to establish an independent State, instead of a new geographic reality, he said, adding: “We should not talk about the borders of 2023.”\n\nSANJA ŠTIGLIC, State Secretary for Political and Multilateral Affairs and Development Cooperation of Slovenia, condemning in the strongest terms Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel, called on the group to stop its rocket fire into Israel and immediately and unconditionally release all hostages. She voiced support for Israel’s right to self-defence in accordance with international law, including the principle of proportionality. She called on all parties to fully respect international humanitarian law and humanitarian principles, including full, immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to and within Gaza. Noting that the situation in Gaza is turning into a human catastrophe, she joined the calls for an independent investigation of the attacks on Al Ahli Arab Hospital.\n\nStressing the urgent need for a humanitarian ceasefire or pause, she said her country will continue to support the indispensable work of UNRWA and has recently substantially increased its funding to the agency, she said. Voicing full support for the UN system and the broader humanitarian community, she called on all countries in the region and beyond to act responsibly and cooperate and engage in a constructive dialogue to de-escalate the conflict. “As a matter of urgency, we must recommit ourselves to resuming a meaningful peace process leading to a two-State solution that brings peace and security to both sides,” she added.\n\nGERARDO PEÑALVER PORTAL, First Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, associated himself with statements to come by the Non-Aligned Movement and Committee for the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and expressed deep concern about the escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine as a consequence of decades of Israeli practices of illegal occupation and colonization. He condemned the murders of civilians; indiscriminate bombings; destruction of homes, hospitals and civil infrastructure; and the deprivation of water, food, electricity and fuel services to Gazans. “Nothing can justify these actions, which constitute collective punishment”, serious violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said. He demanded an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and an end to the rhetoric of war.\n\nHe called it shameful that, once again, the Council has been unable to fulfil its mandate. The United States Government has been complicit and responsible for Israel’s impunity for its historical crimes by obstructing the action of the Council regarding the Palestinian question, undermining peace and stability in the Middle East. It is shameful that the United States has in this Council vetoed 46 resolutions related to the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question, the most recent just a few days ago. He demanded that the United States Government not continue to paralyse the Council using the undemocratic and obsolete veto power “in order to protect the excesses of the Israeli Government”. He advocated for negotiation to stop the escalation of violence and a lasting two-State solution. He called for UN-coordinated emergency humanitarian aid for Gaza.\n\nWOJCIECH GERWEL, Undersecretary for State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland, reminding that his country condemned the brutal attacks on civilians by Hamas, said that Israel has the right to defend itself and its citizens in compliance with international law. Calling for immediate release of all hostages by Hamas, he said that it is crucial to prevent regional escalation and achieve a diplomatic solution. “We call for allowing access for relevant United Nations agencies and their implementing partners,” he said, stressing that the security of all those providing humanitarian assistance is critical. “Especially now we should not leave Gaza Palestinians without support,” he emphasized, recalling that Poland knows very well the consequences of war, invasion and terror, which are felt for generations. “This is why we reiterate that escalation and spreading of the conflict will have devastating and long-lasting consequences,” he said, calling on all the parties not to succumb to the logic of violence and make every effort to reach the cessation of hostilities.\n\nELIZABETH TAYLOR JAY, Vice Minister for Multilateral Affairs of Colombia, said the conflict is of great concern and demands decisive and coordinated action by the United Nations, and in particular by the Security Council. Considering the loss of thousands of lives in recent days and the degradation of living conditions, she recalled the importance of respecting the principles of distinction, proportionality and protection of infrastructure essential for the survival of the civilian population. In this regard, she joined the UN Secretary-General, UN agencies and countless demonstrators around the world, she said. “The world is crying out for a guarantee of access for humanitarian aid aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population,” she said, adding that children, women, older people and the sick are worst affected by the violence.\n\nShe urgently called on the Security Council to take measures in the face of the blockade, which prevents humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, including fuel, hospital supplies, medicine and other indispensable resources. These supplies need to reach all areas, including the north of Gaza, she said, adding that humanitarian operations must be protected and facilitated as established in the Rome Statute. If not, she warned, it would mean a return to the worst times of human barbarity. “Today we are witness to the total disregard of international humanitarian law,” she said, adding that Colombia rejected such disregard. Violence only causes greater suffering, she said, reiterating a call for an immediate cessation of hostility and a resumption of peace negotiations to stabilize the situation. The international legal order must be preserved, she said, adding an international conference of peace must be convened immediately.\n\nAHMED ABOUL GHEIT, Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, said the credibility of the Council is at stake, as the “war of vengeance” in Gaza “only aims to collectively punish millions of people whose only crime is that they live in the Gaza Strip”. It is a violation of international law and international humanitarian law — pillars of the international order. The League condemns the targeting and killing of civilians on both sides because it is convinced of the need to respect international humanitarian law, a principle of which is the distinction between armed combatants and civilians. He called for an immediate stoppage of the hostilities on civilians in Gaza, describing it as the only way to prevent a major humanitarian disaster. Expressing surprise at the claim by some parties to the right of self-defence as a justification to the most serious atrocities, he said the League is concerned that Israeli forces are forcibly displacing the people of Gaza from their homes in the north to the south “as if the aim is to create a humanitarian disaster whether inside the Strip or along the borders with Egypt”.\n\nThis opens the door for a second wave of forced displacement for the people of Gaza, he stressed. The League therefore rejects this displacement — a systematic strategy Israel seeks to apply to liquidate the Palestinian cause. He affirmed that Palestinians and Arabs would not experience a second nakba, and hoped this is clear to the world and the Security Council. It is time for the world to address the root cause of the cycles of violence. He said the only formula to preserve the dignity and freedom of the Palestinian people and safety for the Israelis is the two-State solution, hoping that “the current developments will compel us to think about future generations without repeating the mistakes of the past”.\n\nALICIA GUADALUPE BUENROSTRO MASSIEU (Mexico) called for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages in Hamas’ custody, among them two Mexican nationals. Her country recognizes the right of Israel to protect its citizens and its territory, and to guarantee their security, but that must be done in strict adherence with international law, she stressed. She called for the immediate and lasting cessation of hostilities in all parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as well as the lifting of the siege suffered by the people of Gaza. “It is unacceptable that the United States used its veto on 18 October to prevent Security Council action,” she said, stressing that the draft resolution proposed by Brazil was a balanced text and humanitarian in nature. She once again called on Member States to join the France-Mexico initiative on the restriction on use of the veto, which already has 106 signatories.\n\nSANGJIN KIM (Republic of Korea), condemning the abhorrent and indiscriminate Hamas terrorist attacks, called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Until now, more than 6,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Israel and Gaza, he said, noting that those alive are suffering from acute shortages of necessities. Stressing that all civilian lives matter, he welcomed the Secretary-General’s announcement of the initial provision of humanitarian supplies to civilians in Gaza via the Rafah crossing with additional deliveries over the next couple of days. Noting the high levels of tension in the West Bank, he said that protecting civilians and preventing spillover violence must be the guiding priority at this fragile moment. However, to break the cycle of violence, efforts have to be renewed to establish a durable peaceful solution.\n\nCHRISTIAN WENAWESER (Liechtenstein) said that UN political organs should not be silent in “this tragic crisis of our collective obligation to protect civilian populations.” Condemning the terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians by Hamas and other groups as well as targeting of civilians, mass killings, abduction and hostage taking, he affirmed Israel’s right to defend itself in accordance with international law. Stressing that a “siege of Gaza” — as declared by Israeli military leaders — amounts to an act of collective punishment, he added: “The large numbers of civilian casualties, many of them children, that have resulted in Gaza to date are unacceptable.” States must see the protection of civilians as their highest priority, he said, and called for preventing further escalation of the war and ensuring humanitarian access to the population in Gaza.\n\nOMAR HILALE (Morocco), aligning himself with the Arab Group, warned that the conflict could become more dangerous with implications across the Middle East. Citing the Arab League’s reaffirming the need to stop the bloodshed and not target civilians, he called for the restoration of a genuine peace process aimed at a two-State solution. He also reported that Morocco will send humanitarian assistance to Palestinians, including food, medicine and water, and will coordinate its delivery with Egyptian and Palestinian authorities. Morocco remains on the side of the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, he emphasized, and he called for an end to any measures that jeopardize the status of Jerusalem, in order to prevent the conflict turning from a political one to a religious one. The city must be a place of peaceful coexistence for all three religions, he said.\n\nCAROLYN SCHWALGER (New Zealand) stressed that even as the Security Council convenes, “the deadly violence and bloodshed in Israel and Palestine persists.” Condemning Hamas’ terrorist attacks on Israel, she called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Voicing support for Israel’s right to defend itself, in full compliance with international law — including in respect of actions taken in Gaza — she further affirmed that, ultimately, there is no military solution that will bring a just and lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. The protection of civilians is the most urgent priority, and she joined calls for a humanitarian pause to provide neutral, impartial, and independent humanitarian organizations an opportunity to provide assistance and protection to those in Gaza who desperately need it. Expressing regret that the Council has been unable to adopt a resolution, she called on the international community to urgently advance the Middle East peace process. “We must act now,” she stressed.\n\nRENÉ ALFONSO RUIDÍAZ PÉREZ (Chile) said that his country promotes the two-State solution and the right of Israel and Palestine to live in harmony, within internationally secure and recognized borders, and with full respect for the human rights of all inhabitants. “Chile unreservedly condemns the actions of Hamas and all terrorist action, acts of violence and hostilities against the civilian population,” he said, calling for the unconditional release of all hostages in the hands of the terrorist organization. “The exercise of force as part of the legitimate defence of a State that has been attacked must be guided by the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution,” he urged, adding that these things are not being respected and the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip has prevented the entry of food, water, medical supplies and energy sources necessary for human existence.\n\nMUNIR AKRAM (Pakistan) conveyed Pakistan’s full support and solidarity with Pakistan’s Palestinian brothers and sisters in these tragic and challenging times. Israel’s relentless and indiscriminate bombardment of Gaza over the last 17 days has killed more than 5,000 people and injured another 15,000, he said, strongly and unequivocally condemning Israel’s airstrikes and military actions in Gaza, particularly attacks on schools, residential buildings and hospitals. These Israeli attacks on civilians, the blockade of water, food and fuel, and the forced transfer of people from the occupied territory are flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and amounts to war crimes, and those responsible of these atrocities must be held accountable, he said, calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, saying the continuation of the Israeli campaign will lead to further massive civilian causalities and could trigger a wider and more dangerous regional conflict. He regretted the Security Council has been unable to issue a call for a ceasefire. A heavy responsibility rests on those who contribute to the prolongation of this conflict, he said.\n\nSURIYA CHINDAWONGSE (Thailand) voiced his opposition to the withholding of access to basic necessities like water, food, electricity and fuel as weapons of war, and the targeting of critical civilian infrastructure. He also reported that his country, while it extends its deepest condolences to families that lost loved ones and its sympathy with everyone suffering, is also a victim, as Thai citizens have been killed, injured and taken hostage. He strongly appealed for their immediate release and safe return, condemning all forms of violence and attacks on civilians in conflict situations. He further urged all sides to respect and fulfil their obligations under international law and appealed to the international community to ensure access to humanitarian aid. He joined other speakers in calling for “all sides to take immediate steps to prevent the escalation of violence and implement an immediate ceasefire”, and he urged the Security Council do its utmost to restore peace and security in the region in line with the United Nations Charter.\n\nALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar), associating herself with the Arab Group, recalled that on many occasions, her country over recent months has expressed caution against the intensification of Israeli policies, including attempts to change the historic status quo and geographical status quo of the holy sites. Over the last two weeks, it has made appeals and tireless diplomatic efforts for mediation and dialogue toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict, she added, noting her country’s efforts for the release of hostages from the Gaza Strip. She said Qatar strongly rejects the words of Israel, who gave a false image of the mediation efforts of her country, which were welcomed by friendly countries, the UN and international partners. Support provided by Qatar to civilians in Gaza covers humanitarian and development support for UN channels, and is part of its humanitarian and moral obligation to the Palestinian people. Its support is also in response to appeals from international partners, who called on her country to play a leading role to achieve stability for Gaza and the region, she added.\n\nCHEIKH NIANG (Senegal), Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, noted that on 7 October, he issued a statement condemning the killing and wounding of hundreds of civilians in Israel, as well as the taking of hostages. Noting that Israel, the occupying Power, bears responsibility for protecting the civilian population and for the unfolding humanitarian disaster, he strongly condemned that State’s reprisal air strikes and bombardment of the densely populated Gaza Strip — killing, as of 23 October, over 4,651 Palestinians, including over 1,873 children, and injuring more than 14,245 Palestinians. Particularly abhorrent war crimes are attacks on medical facilities, like the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, where an air strike killed some 500 people, including medical personnel, or places of worship sheltering civilians, as the attack on the Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyries Church.\n\nNoting estimates that over 1.4 million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, he further condemned Israel’s military orders to “evacuate” to the south of the Strip. “There is nowhere safe to go in Gaza,” he stated. “Wars have rules,” he stressed, condemning collective punishment and calling for an immediate ceasefire and for Israel to immediately lift its total siege. Also reporting that UNRWA facilities are sheltering over 600,000 internally displaced persons, he urged Member States to provide urgent financial assistance. He further welcomed the decision by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel to collect evidence of war crimes committed by all sides. The current crisis has proved once again the need to “focus on our longstanding objectives: The end of the Israeli occupation and the fulfilment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including to self-determination and independence.”\n\nCARLA MARÍA RODRÍGUEZ MANCIA (Guatemala)"
