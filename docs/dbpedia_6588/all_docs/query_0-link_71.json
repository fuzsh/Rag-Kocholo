        "text": "The execution of Troy Anthony Davis on 21 September 2011 highlights the intertwining of race and inequality in the US justice system, exposing the deeply privileged nature of this system and its white supremacist foundations. More specifically, for those groups that are caught up in its apparatuses, those that have been constructed as outside of its bounds and are the focus of its repressive tendencies, the execution of Troy Davis is a moment to begin understanding the processes that render justice in the United States unresponsive and unhinged from the workings of the public it purports to protect. Using the execution of Troy Davis as a starting point we explore his execution and illuminate the inhumanity of the US system of justice and ultimately show how capital punishment is co- constitutive with capital relations and the law. Specifically we build upon the idea of \"collateral consequences\" to argue that once racialization processes become established, racialization becomes a self-perpetuating system.\n\nIn 1984, a study on race and the death penalty went to trial in Georgia, with expert testimony on both sides. The federal district judge found that the study did not show what its principal author, David Baldus, claimed. To the extent it showed anything, it showed just the opposite, that neither race of the perpetrator nor race of the victim played a significant role in capital sentencing decisions. Yet the Baldus study is routinely cited as proof of what the author claimed rather than what the court found. The public perception of race and the death penalty has been severely distorted by misleading claims and faulty reporting. The body of evidence, when critically examined, shows that the reality of race and capital sentencing in the United States today is quite different from what is commonly believed."
