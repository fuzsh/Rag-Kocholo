        "text": "§ VISCOUNT TEMPLEWOOD\n\nThe Royal Commission examined meticulously the evidence in all the abolitionist countries and compared it with the evidence from the retentionist countries. They examined the evidence in Scandinavia, in the Low Countries and in the United States of America, and they came to the unanimous conclusion that the presence or absence of the death penalty has no effect on the rate of murder.\n\nI come to my next condition, which also arises out of evidence collected by the Royal Commission. However the death penalty is carried out, an execution is a horrible and repulsive act that can be justified only if it is essential to the 'security of the State. I wonder whether noble Lords have read, for instance, the evidence of the Home Office and the public executioner. The public executioner gave the Royal Commission detailed evidence of the proceedings of an execution; and I notice that he has since been trying to publish his life story in one of the Sunday newspapers. I understand that that, fortunately, has been stopped. Let any noble Lord read this evidence and he must come to the conclusion that the whole business, whether it be necessary or not, is repulsive. The applications for the post of executioner, the training of the potential executioners with bags of 568 sand, the visit of the executioner the night before the execution to the prison, and his secret investigation of the weight of the murderer who is going to be executed the next day—all these things to me are absolutely repulsive and can be justified only if it is proved that these proceedings really check the rate of murder.\n\nI remember that in our last debate one of the right reverend Prelates mentioned an execution and spoke of the death penalty as upholding the majesty of the law. He went further and spoke of it as creating \"a quasi-religious sense of awe.\" I will not linger upon this part of the subject. I will merely ask noble Lords to read the public executioner's evidence before the Royal Commission, and I am convinced that three out of four of you will come to the conclusion that an execution is a horrible affair.\n\nI pass on to my fourth proposition. If the death penalty is abolished an effective deterrent exists in life imprisonment. The Home Office and the Prison Commission have categorically stated that there is no insuperable difficulty in dealing with the small number of very dangerous murderers who would now be reprieved, but who, under a system of abolition, would be condemned to life imprisonment. I do not stop to argue this case in detail. I say only that in spite of all the difficulties with which the Prison Commissioners have been faced in recent years, prison treatment has been substantially reformed, at least in the training and special prisons where these dangerous criminals would be interned. It has been reformed out of all recognition since the late Sir Alec Paterson declared that hanging was more humane than a life sentence. Let me add only that I was very much disturbed when I saw that in another place the Secretary of State was slowing down the building of the East Hubert prison, which would be essentially the prison to which we should send these dangerous criminals. I hope that after these debates he will think again of that decision, and will not, for a mere £190,000, stop building what is the very kind of institution that ought to be used for dealing with the really dangerous murderers whom it is not safe to release.\n\nLastly, the sentence of death being irreversible, there is always the chance of an irrevocable mistake. I see it is 569 said that the precautions are so great that it is practically humanly impossible for a mistake to be made. I have, myself, had a good deal of experience of these cases—not only when I was Home Secretary, for before that, on two occasions, I acted for the Home Secretary when I was Secretary of State for Air and Secretary of State for India. Noble Lords will remember that any one Secretary of State can carry out the duties of any other. I say at once that when I deputised for the Home Secretary, my action was little more than perfunctory. Papers were brought to me; I knew none of the background. It was quite obvious that what was wanted was my signature before the execution took place. That may be inevitable when the Home Secretary is away. I suggest, however, in passing, that it is a thoroughly bad plan, and ought to be brought to an end.\n\nWhen I was Home Secretary the position was different. I had the whole machine of the Government, of the Home Office, around me. I had an excellent permanent secretary in Sir Alexander Maxwell, who, in months of contact, had let me understand fully his mind in a way that I never could have known it if I had merely been brought in as Secretary of State for Air or Secretary of State for India. During the time, when I was Home Secretary I had forty-seven death sentences with which to deal. In twenty-four instances I advised reprieves. In four cases the persons concerned were found insane after the end of the trial. That means that out of forty-seven sentences nineteen resulted in execution. Did I make any mistake? I cannot say. I believe that on the evidence I had before me, and with the advice I had from my permanent officials, I made the light decisions in the circumstances. But what was to stop new circumstances arising after I had given my decision—new circumstances that seem to have influenced so impressively my successor Mr. Chuter Ede? Mr. Chuter Ede said in another place that in the Evans and Christie case he gave a decision based upon evidence at the time, but that subsequently evidence was available that he believed would inevitably have led him to decide upon a reprieve. Whatever care you take in this process, the possibility of these mistakes is bound to arise. It has arisen in 570 the past (I could quote to noble Lords several cases from past history) and it will arise again in the future. And the trouble is that the penalty is irremediable. Mistakes are irrevocable.\n\nNow I could end my speech at this point. I have stated my five propositions: first, that the present law is admittedly unsatisfactory; secondly, that the death penalty is not an essential deterrent; thirdly, that an execution is a horrible proceeding; fourthly, that life imprisonment is an equally effective deterrent fifthly, that the death penalty, being irrevocable, makes mistakes irremediable. As I say, I could end what I have to say at this point. But I feel that my case would be incomplete if I did not, at the end of my speech, say something about public opinion, the opinion of the police, the opinion of the prison officers and the opinion of the general public.\n\nLet me begin with the police. I admit that feeling against abolition is very strong among the police—indeed, I should be surprised if it were not. I have every sympathy with the police, especially now when almost everywhere, and particularly in the Metropolitan area, they are so short of men. But I must say—and I challenge anyone to controvert this statement—that there is no evidence to show that the police in abolitionist countries are any less safe than they are in retentionist countries. There has recently been a detailed inquiry into the experience in this matter in abolitionist and retentionist countries, which is forming the basis of evidence that is being given by the University of Pennsylvania to a Committee of the Canadian Chamber. And the results clearly show, statistically, that if there is any difference between experience in the two kinds of States in the United States, the advantage, so far as the police are concerned, is on the side of the police in the abolitionist States.\n\nWhat is needed for the police is not a special clause in a Bill. What is needed is not authority to arm them—the Home Secretary has himself said the arming of the police has no bearing upon this question. What is needed is the very simple thing of greater numbers. If the police could be brought up to their full establishment (at the present moment I put the shortage, in the Metropolitan area and in the provinces, at no less than 10,000), the 571 deterrent against murder—the great deterrent against murder being certainty of detection—would become far stronger. I do not apologise for alluding to this question of the shortage of men in the police. I have raised it, I think, every Session since the end of the war, and I am sorry to say that every Government in turn has looked the other way. I would draw the attention of the Government to-day, when they say that it is very difficult to find the right number of police in a country of full employment, to the state of affairs in New York, where, as I read only this morning in the New York Times, the authorities have never had such good recruiting of the police. Their numbers are higher than ever before and the standard is better than anything in the past. That is the way to deal with the police: more police and better conditions.\n\nI come now to the prison officers. There again, they feel very strongly that if the death penalty is abolished there will be no further penalty with which to deter a murderer already enduring a life sentence in prison. My Lords, I do not altogether accept this view. I believe—and my belief is founded upon some study—that, even with the most hardened criminals, the hope of liberty is a deterrent and that, though it may operate only many years hence, it will still have a restraining influence upon these dangerous murderers. But if that be not so. I say that there is other action that ought to be undertaken. I say that we ought to fill up the gaps in the ranks of the prison officers, and that will mean better conditions for them. They are one thousand men short at the present time. We ought to press on with our prison reforms, in specialising between one prison and another; and we ought to see that the conditions of the prison officers are a good deal better than they are now. But perhaps most important of all, we ought to see that there are three shifts of work in the prisons and that the prisoners are kept well employed. I do not apologise for having interjected those comments: they bear directly upon the central problem with which I am dealing.\n\nLastly, I come to the general public. I am aware that there is a very vocal opinion in the general public against abolition. The case is that they have never been consulted. When they have been asked a question, in a Gallup Poll, 572 whether they were in favour of capital punishment they have said. Yes. This Bill, therefore, so the argument goes, should not be pressed. My Lords, I do not accept this conception of the duties of Parliament. If it were applied to every controversial question, parliamentary government would become impossible. If it had been applied in the past to every important penal question there would have been none of the penal reforms of the last century that are now regarded as necessary and beneficial. Let us picture to ourselves what would have been the result in the 'sixties of a Gallup Poll upon public executions. An example like that shows the danger of accepting an opinion that is based principally upon emotion and applied to a question that I maintain depends for its right answer upon a very careful study of the ascertainable facts. How many of those who answered \"Yes\" had studied the details of this question? How many of them knew what is happening in other countries? How many knew what is the variation between one murderer and another? How many knew of the improved conditions in British prisons?\n\nI am much more impressed by the fact that in two Parliaments, the first under a Labour majority, the second with a Conservative majority, Members of the House of Commons have voted definitely in favour of abolition. This is a fact of far greater importance than the casual votes of any Gallup Poll. It is a significant fact, but it by no means completes the process of parliamentary government. Your Lordships' House has its constitutional part to play. Every Peer will vote as his mind and conscience direct him. So far as I am concerned, I would say nothing to detract from the full liberty of every individual Peer. I have always defended the powers of your Lordships' House, but I have never regarded them as simply a check on reforming legislation. To me, at least, they depend for their justification on the need of an opportunity to discuss and decide difficult questions in an atmosphere less disturbed and emotional than the atmosphere of another place—an opportunity, that is to say, in which the evidence can be carefully weighed and a decision reached unaffected by the fear of an Election or popular resentment.\n\nIt is in this spirit that I move the Second Reading of this Bill. It is in this 573 spirit that I ask the House to give a Second Reading to a Bill that abolishes a repulsive punishment, that upholds the standards of a civilised society and that endangers the security neither of the State nor of the private citizen. I beg to move.\n\n§ THE LORD CHANCELLOR (VISCOUNT KILMUIR)\n\nMy Lords, before I proceed to give my answer to the five main points which my noble friend Lord Templewood has put forward, there are one or two general observations which I would venture to put before your Lordships. After this debate your Lordships will decide whether this Bill should be given a Second Reading, and that decision will be taken, as a similar decision was taken in another place, on a free vote. It will be for every noble Lord to search his conscience and express by his vote his personal conviction of what is right. Nevertheless, it is proper that at this early stage in the debate your Lordships should know the views of Her Majesty's Government.\n\nHer Majesty's Government are clearly and unequivocally of the view that capital punishment must be retained. I endorse fully today what my right honourable and gallant friend the Home Secretary has said in another place about the dangers of this Bill. However, I have said that this will he a free vote and I do not withdraw from that statement in any way. The Government do not expect or wish that any noble Lord should speak or vote against this Bill out of a sense of loyalty to the Government and, least of 574 all, from Party feeling. At the same time, no Government with any sense of responsibility could abstain from expressing their own view on such an important matter. The view which I venture to express to your Lordships is the considered view of the Government, a view they have consistently expressed in debate in another place and which, after examining all the arguments and all the evidence, they still continue to hold.\n\nMy noble friend Lord Templewood proceeded for a short period in his speech to deal with the history of this matter. I shall try to emulate him in not going into it in detail, and endeavour to extract the important points which 1. believe your Lordships should have in mind. It is eight years ago since this very question was debated both in your Lordships' House and in another place. Those debates took place when, as now, crimes of violence were only too prevalent. What happened then will be so fresh in your Lordships' minds that again I need not go into detail. I shall content myself with reminding your Lordships of two points. In the first place, the clause by which it was sought in 1948 to suspend the death penalty for murder was inserted in the Criminal Justice Bill on a free vote, against the advice given in another place by the Government led by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. Secondly, the attempts made during the passage of that Bill to divide murder into capital and non-capital crimes proved totally unsuccessful.\n\nIt was as a result of these arguments, debates and discussions that the Royal Commission, which my noble friend has mentioned, was appointed in 1949 by the Government led by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. After a patient investigation of 4½ years—and I should like to pay my tribute to the thoroughness with which they did their work—the Commission reported in 1953. Again I would remind your Lordships that, although investigating almost every question connected with the death penalty, by their terms of reference they were precluded from going into the question which is before dour Lordships to-day. Therefore I will not examine the recommendation in detail. For the purpose of this debate it is sufficient for me to say that they, too, after exhaustive research, including, as my noble friend has said, inquiries into the 575 experiences of foreign countries, were unable to recommend any method of introducing what are sometimes called \"degrees\" of murder. If I understand my noble friend correctly, it is the report of that Commission which is the major change on which he relies for his argument.\n\nI do not say for a moment that it is impossible to distinguish those kinds of murder which are most dangerous to society—for example, those involving the use of poison or firearms, those striking at public order or those committed by professional armed criminals. Your Lordships will be well aware that since the Commission's Report was published these possibilities have been much canvassed, both in public and in the many debates that have taken place in another place, both before and during the passage of this Bill. Again I will not trouble your Lordships with details, but I agree with my noble friend that there are few questions that have received so much debate and so profound examination. But I believe that the question your Lordships have to decide in this debate is both narrower and more fundamental. That question is: Is capital punishment for murder to be retained at all in this country? That, I think, was the burden of my noble friend's speech. It is my task to set before your Lordships the conclusions which the Government have reached after long and anxious consideration.\n\nThat question must be considered without prejudice to the improvements in the law of murder which the Government have said they would be glad to consider, and which, indeed, dispose of much of the earlier part of my noble friend's speech. We have to look, as I say, at this narrow but fundamental question. I believe that the final object of criminal punishment, whether it takes the form of execution, imprisonment or a fine, is to reduce crime. It is commonly said, and I agree, that there are three elements of punishment: reformation, retribution and deterrence. I was reminded of these by the point made by my noble friend Lord Templewood in his evidence before the Royal Commission, when he said: The reforming element has come to predominate and the other two are carried incidentally to the reforming clement. The noble Viscount has developed something of that line in part of his speech 576 to-day. I agree with the noble Viscount that when treatment, such as imprisonment or probation in its various forms, is being considered, reform comes first. But the other two elements are not to be ignored. In some cases—and I believe that murder is one of them—they are of paramount importance.\n\nIn speaking of \"retribution\", I do not mean revenge. \"An eye for an eye\" should have no place in our criminal law. I mean, to use the Royal Commission's phrase in paragraph 52, — the State's marking its disapproval of the breaking of its laws by a penalty proportionate to the gravity of the offence. The State cannot ignore crime. Let me remind your Lordships of the words of the late Archbishop Temple, who was himself a convinced abolitionist. He said: …if when a crime has been committed, the community does nothing, it is condoning the act, and to that extent becomes a partner in the guilt of it. The State is bound to punish crime, quite apart from the possible effect of punishment on the criminal. I want to draw your Lordships' attention to the opinion expressed to the Royal Commission (your Lordships will find it in paragraph 53 of the Report) by Lord Justice Denning, when he said: The ultimate justification of any punishment is not that it is a deterrent, but that it is an emphatic denunciation by the community of a crime: and from this point of view, there are murders which, in the present state of public opinion, demand the most emphatic denunciation of all—namely, the death penalty. The paragraph continues with these words: The Archbishop of Canterbury, while expressing no opinion about the ethics of capital punishment, agreed with Lord Justice Denning's view about the ultimate justification of any punishment. That is an important start. I myself would go further. I believe that the \"emphatic denunciation\" of a crime does more than mark the State's disapproval. It causes individuals, and, indeed, the whole people, to regard that crime with detestation. I cannot put the point better than it was put in a leading article in The Times newspaper on February 16 of this year, which your Lordships have no doubt read, when it said: Rather do [the retentionists] think that a century and more during which … murder 577 has been practically the only offence punishable with death, has bred in the whole people a unique horror … of the guilt of this one most dreadful crime. I agree with the Royal Commission when they say, in paragraph 59, that the effect on the moral consciousness of society must itself play a part in deterring members of that society from committing murder. I have heard the abolitionists argue that the one person not concerned in this problem is the murdered man, for he cannot be brought to life. Is, my opinion, a mature community cannot escape from so grave a responsibility by so light a phrase.\n\nWhatever we may think about the relative importance of various elements of criminal punishment, I apprehend that to roost of your Lordships the real crux of the question at issue in this debate is whether capital punishment is, in erect, a uniquely effective deterrent. That is the challenge which my noble friend. Lord Templewood, put to me specifically, and which I gladly take up and will try to meet. I suppose there are some people to whom the issue is clear, and for whom there can be no argument; who believe that it is wrong for the State, in any circumstances, to take life. I respect that view, which I do not share, but I shall not attempt to enter on that discussion, which must in the end turn upon religious faith. Nor do I suggest to your Lordships that a decision taken solely on the issue of deterrence would be satisfactory to all minds. In that context a moral problem is raised, and, as I myself have suggested, other considerations are important. But I think most of your Lordships will agree with this view: that if it could be clearly shown either that capital punishment does, or that it does not, reduce murder, the number of those in favour of retention, or abolition, as the case may be, would be so great, and the argument that could be presented so powerful, that few would be in any doubt about the proper course to take. Therefore, the question whether capital punishment has a greater deterrent effect than life imprisonment, has assumed almost overwhelming importance. Indeed, the noble Viscount, Lord Templewood, has indicated that most clearly in the speech that he made this afternoon.\n\nThe Royal Commission, though they were not directly concerned with the question of abolition, did consider the evidence 578 about the deterrent effect of the death penalty, and surveyed with diligence and patience the information available over a wide field, including the experience of countries that have abolished capital punishment—and we are greatly indebted to them on this score. I funk it is an indication of the respect with which their work has been treated that no-one has sought to challenge their conclusions on this point, although varying interpretations have been placed on these conclusions. Therefore, I think it is important that your Lordships should have, at the beginning of the debate, what these conclusions are. I agree that in summarising them, there is an inevitable risk that one will give an over-emphasis or under-emphasis to certain points, and, while accepting that risk, I shall do my utmost to be fair. And I am sure I shall be corrected if I am wrong.\n\nI would summarise the conclusions as follows: first of all, prima facie one would expect the penalty of death to have a uniquely deterrent effect; arid there is some evidence, although no convincing statistical evidence, to this effect. But this effect does not operate universally or uniformly, and there are many offenders on whom it is limited and may often be negligible. Secondly, the Commission say that the statistics of murder in the countries which have abolished capital punishment neither prove nor disprove the uniquely deterrent effect of capital punishment, because the murder rate is conditioned by many factors, and we cannot isolate the effect of that one factor. In fact, as they say in paragraph 67, … the figures offer no reliable evidence one way or the other. Thirdly, they say that the statistics of murder in many foreign countries are not as reliable as our own statistics, because they are generally based on the number of prosecutions or convictions or on the registered cause of death; and this means that such factors as the efficiency of the police, the prosecuting authorities or of the registration officers may influence the figures. Your Lordships will see that statement in paragraph 65 and 27 of Appendix VI. We cannot assume that these factors are constants, and it follows that the statistics are riot as reliable as figures based (as are our own) on the number of murders known to the police. Our system reduces the possibility of error 579 to the minimum, although it does not eliminate it.\n\nFourthly, the Royal Commission say that, with the exception of Belgium, where, before the war, the convictions were, proportionately, five times those in this country, comparison between this country and most of the countries that have abolished capital punishment is vitiated by differences in social and industrial conditions and in density of population. Your Lordships will find that statement in paragraph 61 of the Commission's Report.\n\nThat is the fairest summary that I can make of the conclusions reached by the Royal Commission, and my noble friend Lord Templewood, and those who agree with him, have based their arguments largely on the inconclusive nature of these statistics. Beyond doubt they are entitled to say, as they do, that nowhere do these statistics prove that capital punishment is a unique deterrent. But it is in the nature of things that they should not. It is the murders which have not been committed that matter, and their number can never be shown in statistics. Again, let me put it in the words of the Royal Commission in paragraph 59.\n\nCapital punishment has obviously failed as a deterrent when a murder is committed. We can number its failures. But we cannot number its successes. No-one can ever know how many people have refrained from murder because of the fear of being hanged. The statistics, however, reveal one fact to which I think too little attention has been paid. I would ask your Lordships to study Table 46, on page 371, of the Report, where the Royal Commission have set out the comparative \"murder tables\" per head of population for the various countries for which figures are available. When every allowance is made for differences in the law, the inaccuracy of reports, varying standards of efficiency and conscientiousness in police forces, one most significant fact remains: the number of murders known to the police (not merely the number of convictions for murder) in England and Wales, and even more so in Scotland, has been consistently lower than in all the other countries. I know that it would be dangerous to make that a conclusive and sole ground of inference, and my noble friend Lord Templewood would point to other countries where capital punishment exists and 580 the murder rate is dreadfully high, or whether it does not exist and the rate is comparatively low. Nevertheless, the fact remains that we have the lowest murder rate, and I for one would hesitate a very long time before asserting that capital punishment has nothing to do with it.\n\nMy Lords, I believe that the death penalty is a uniquely effective deterrent, but I do not believe its effect is universal—obviously, it is not. No deterrent will deter the insane or those who kill in moments of blind rage or passion, without thought of the consequences. Some people do not count the cost to themselves of what they do. The ability not to count the cost may produce great acts of heroism in some fields or foolish recklessness in others. But the fact that human beings do sometimes act without thought of the consequences puts them at times—I repeat at times—beyond the reach of deterrents. But murder is not a thing that occurs to the human mind only in moments of passion or frenzy. The mind is capable of calculating the advantage to be gained by eliminating a particular person or by accepting the risk of killing in the course of a particular enterprise. It is here that the natural disinclination to take in cold blood a substantial risk of death may tip the balance against murder.\n\nIt is sometimes argued that the risk is not great because only some 12 per cent. of known murders result in the execution of the murderer. But this is not for this purpose the relevant figure. Some murderers commit suicide some are found insane on arraignment, some guilty but insane and some are reprieved on the ground of mitigating circumstances. But those who are not insane and can plead no mitigating circumstance—and, surely, the armed criminal and the deliberate killer for gain are among these—must have considerably more than an even chance of hanging. This represents a big risk for the man who counts the cost. For those who are capable of being deterred. I believe that capital punishment is on all counts—the terrifying nature of the thing risked and the likelihood first of detection and then of execution—a most powerful deterrent. I do not believe that the prospect of imprisonment, even with the same likelihood of detection and conviction is to be compared with it. A man who contemplates imprisonment contemplates something that has an end— 581 something that may go on for a long time, but from which he will, he supposes, eventually emerge. It is something known, often very well known, to him, a state the inconveniences of which, such as they are, he has experienced and knows he can endure. But death is final and unknown. Can there be any serious doubt which prospect is more likely to make a man pause and consider whether the risk is worth running?\n\nLet us turn for a moment to the armed criminal, since this is an aspect of the problem which causes the Government much worry and the public, I believe, great concern. What is the position to be if capital punishment is abolished? A man going out to commit a robbery, or it may be a burglary, perhaps with a long criminal record behind him, will know that if he is caught he is likely to be sentenced to from ten to fourteen years' preventive detention. If he arms himself and kills someone he will run the risk of a rather longer term of imprisonment. He cannot tell how much longer; I cannot tell how much longer; I did not understand my noble friend Lord Templewood to be able to tell how much longer. Let us say that it would be a few years longer. Is this difference in sentence, if he arms himself and commits a murder and is caught and convicted, a sufficient deterrent to prevent him from taking a revolver with him? My Lords, I believe it is not, because there are solid advantages for him if he arms himself. If lie takes a revolver, he increases the chances of success in the crime, because he can make other people do what he wants; he increases his chances of escaping apprehension if he is surprised at the scene of the crime, because he can shoot down policemen and others who try to arrest him; and he increases his chances of escaping conviction if he is caught at some later date, because he can shoot down eye-witnesses who may see him.\n\nFaced with these solid advantages, what will be the reactions of the criminal classes with whom we are concerned? We must remember that we are concerned with the possible deterrence on criminals, not on armchair critics considering it afterwards. I believe that they will arm themselves on a much more extensive scale than they do at present. In reply to this argument my noble friend has said—and it has been consistently argued—that where capital 582 punishment has been abolished overseas there has been no increase in murders by armed criminals. My Lords, the conditions are not comparable. I know of no country comparable with our own which has abolished capital punishment and which has an unarmed police force. Where the police are armed the considerations are quite different. There the penalty of death remains for the armed criminal, even if capital punishment is abolished; he knows that if he uses his weapon while committing a crime he may be shot dead on the spot. This may well be the most important factor in the criminal's mind; the prospect of being executed, if he is caught, and if he is convicted, may not assume as much weight as it does in a country where the police are not armed.\n\nIn this country, the criminal may normally shoot at the police, or at a householder, or at a witness, with impunity from immediate retaliation; and the existence of the death penalty is the only deterrent, other than the prospect of a rather longer term of imprisonment if he shoots but fails to kill any one, against such action. Arguments from countries which have armed police, or from countries with a sparse population, have no validity for us. I pause only to say this. My noble friend made an eloquent appeal for better recruitment for the police force. I have been Home Secretary for three years, and I know just how great the problem is. But it is the first time that I have heard that that problem would be nearer solution by making the job of the police so infinitely more dangerous than it is to-day.\n\nSome abolitionists are prepared to push the argument further and to say that if what I have said is a real danger, then the police should be armed. I hope your Lordships will not accept that point of, view. An unarmed police force is part of our tradition and our heritage. The Government would be most loath to see it otherwise, and any of us who has been at the Home Office would, I am sure, be most concerned at seeing something like that, which would lessen the good relationship between the police and the public. Nor is it an answer to say that the penalties for carrying arms can be increased and that this will be a sufficient deterrent. The penalties for committing offences while armed are already as high as can be justified. It is, for 583 example, punishable by life imprisonment to commit robbery while armed, or to shoot with intent to do grievous bodily harm or to resist arrest. In recent years Her Majesty's judges have imposed a number of very long sentences for armed robbery and similar crimes, and there is really no scope for providing for higher penalties in that regard.\n\nOn this aspect of the armed criminal—and how important an aspect it is!—this is a question on which each of us must form his own judgment. When all the statistics and all the arguments have been analysed and considered, that judgment will still be largely subjective and based on experience. Many of your Lordships have vast experience in the administration of the criminal law, not only in this country but throughout the British Commonwealth and Empire.\n\nMy Lords, I have no wish to obtrude upon your Lordships details of my own experience, but I have seen the criminal from the point of view of counsel, of judge and of Home Secretary; and I have had some opportunity of seeing how his mind works. With that experience behind me I can say that, in my opinion, to the professional criminal fear of execution is a very real deterrent—of that I am perfectly certain. I remind your Lordships again, and I hope you will bear with me in doing so, that it is the criminal we want to deter. Putting the question the other way, as the abolitionists wish, is the abolition of the death penalty likely to create a greater sense of the sanctity of life among the criminal classes? That is the question which must be asked.\n\nI pass to some of the other arguments which my noble friend adduced. One of them—and this has often been raised—was the possible bad effect of an execution on the prison staff, and the rather more unpleasant manifestations of public and journalistic sensationalism. There is no substantial evidence of any real harm being done to the staff, and I think that a candid reading of paragraph 781 of the Report bears that out. I leave it to your Lordships to judge. On the other point, I would remind my noble friend Lord Templewood that murder repulsive and very often sensational, and when people commit murder the fact of the murder appeals to that aspect of human nature. We have tried, as my 584 noble friend knows, by administrative means to get rid of some of the factors, but essentially this is a problem for those responsible for the morals, education and taste of the people. People buy the newspapers they like, and we must never get rid of the responsibility which we, as some of the leaders of the people, have on ourselves for the public taste that we see around us.\n\nThere is one argument—my noble friend advanced it, of course—which we must all face. He said, rightly, \"Death is final and a mistake can never be undone.\" That is true. But I do not believe—and I speak with full awareness of what has been said and written about recent cases—that within living memory a mistake has been made. It is possible that, after an execution, evidence comes to light which, if known earlier, might have prevented a conviction. That is a possibility that I accept. I also accept the theoretical possibility of an innocent man being hanged, but I do not for a moment believe that that is a practical possibility. The administration of the law and the government of this country have to be based on practical and not theoretical possibilities. I do not believe that it is a practical possibility, because, if any fresh evidence comes to light after the conviction, the most meticulous inquiries are made; and even if there is no fresh evidence the Home Secretary examines in the closest detail all information relating to the case, including the complete transcript of evidence. If, after this examination, there is in his mind a scintilla of doubt as to the rightness of the conviction, the convicted man is invariably reprieved. I can only say, with full knowledge of the genuine uneasiness that some people have felt, that I do not believe that any mistake has been, or is remotely likely to be, made.\n\nMy noble friend said there were occasions when, as Secretary of State for Air, he deputised for the Home Secretary. I was three years at the Home Office. I never let anyone deputise for me. The only time when I had to leave these shores, I arranged that I did not go until the middle of August and so dealt with all the cases which had come to the Court of Criminal Appeal after the Summer Recess. I do not believe that 585 that is a necessary danger if the Home Secretary sticks to his job.\n\nWith regard to other cases, I myself ordered inquiries in two, and the results of the inquiries have been published. In the only other case, where my predecessor had ordered an inquiry, I reconsidered all the facts. It is an unpleasant argument to have to advance that is based on one's own experience but, after all, on what better can one base views properly than experience, knowledge, and the best of information?\n\nI have tried to give your Lordships, as sincerely as I can, the views I have so formed. I have spoken to-day—and I hope your Lordships will believe me—with a great sense of my responsibility. This Government, like every other Government, are, in the end, responsible for the protection of innocent people. This is a prerequisite of freedom. Our generation, let me remind your Lordships, has seen democracies fall on the Continent of Europe largely because ordinary people did not believe that the democratic Government would give that protection. It is our duty to see that the private citizen is not subjected to armed assault or armed burglary, and that the prison officers and the police, in carrying out their duties, do not go in peril of their lives.\n\nYour Lordships will know only too well that there are still far too many crimes of violence in this country and I, for one, do not believe that the right time has come now, any more than it had eight years ago, for relaxing any safeguard. But it is not for this country alone that the Government are responsible. The Bill, it is true, directly affects only us here, but its enactment could not fail to be felt in every part of the British Empire. What would the effect be in Kenya, in Malaya, in Cyprus? I ask your Lordships to weigh that question very carefully before coming to any conclusion.\n\nThere are those among your Lordships who can give the House the advantage of their experience of government and administration in many parts of the Commonwealth and Empire. I, for my part, believe that a decision to abolish the death penalty for murder here will have disastrous consequences there. For any Government to carry out its duty 586 involves, to some extent, a repressive side. At times things have to be done which are unpopular with many and severe towards some. The infliction of criminal punishment is always such, but we cannot shrink from inflicting it where necessary. In the end, it is a question of balancing the severity of the penalty against the interest of the community. I am convinced that the interest of the community requires the mention of the death penalty for murder, and I should be failing in my duty if I did not repeat, in unequivocal terms, that the Government consider this to be an unwise and dangerous measure the presence of which in the Statute Book would be a disaster for the country and a menace to its people.\n\n§ LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE\n\nMy Lords, I feel a great sense of responsibility in taking part in this debate in your Lordships' House to-day. It is a debate which will, for many reasons, be historic in the years to come. We are facing the issues of life and death. That is one which cannot fail to give us a great sense of responsibility. We have a constitutional issue—an unusual thing. I do not ever remember in the course of my life the carrying by another place, through all its stages, of a Bill which was from the start opposed by the Government of the day. Noble Lords in all parts of the House recognise the fact that we may be faced with a constitutional issue between this House and another place. It is not for me to say anything about that.\n\nNow that we have had two speeches of some length, one from each side in this controversy, and we have, I believe, sixty-one Members of this House who are waiting o speak, I propose to make my remarks very short. In doing so, I naturally shall not be able to give, chapter and verse for all the statements I make; but if any of the statements I make are challenged, then I am quite sure that amongst the numerous other speakers who take my view in this question documentary answers can and will he given to substantiate the truth of what I am about to say. We have had a very powerful speech from the Lord Chancellor, a speech we should have expected from him. I should call it a massive speech, fully documented and building up a great edifice. But the 587 real point is this: no edifice, however well built, will stand unless it rests upon solid foundations. The question I have to put to your Lordships is whether this great edifice which the Lord Chancellor has built up to-day really rests upon any solid foundations of evidence. Over and over again, the Lord Chancellor said, \"I believe this\", \"I believe that\", \"It seems obvious this\", and \"It seems obvious that\"; but what is the evidence on which he bases those beliefs? I venture to maintain that there is no evidence of fact. The Lord Chancellor quoted from the recent Royal Commission and, of course, with his accustomed fairness he quoted correctly; but I suggest to your Lordships that he built a conclusion upon an entirely inadequate basis.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor himself admits—and, as my noble friend the mover pointed out, I think we must all admit—that putting another person to death is a pretty sorry business, and it can be justified only if it is really necessary. I do not think anyone in any part of this House will deny that. The Lord Chancellor quoted from the Royal Commission and said that they came to an inconclusive decision. They were bound to come to an inconclusive decision; we can never prove what would happen if we were to do something that we have not done. All we can do is to take analogies. The argument put forward by the Lord Chancellor was put forward in even stronger language than he put it to-day over a hundred years ago when the death penalty existed for a large number of things. It was said then, as it is said today, that if the deterrent of the death penalty were removed no one in this country would be able to go about with any prospect of safety for his life; he would have to go about armed and his possessions would be at the mercy of thieves and robbers. The Judges, the Lord Chancellor and the House of Lords for years begged Parliament to refuse to remove the death penalty, because it was said that it would be certain to open the floodgate to unlimited crime. Every one of those prophecies was falsified in the event. So far from the gloomy forebodings that were put forward taking place, crime gradually decreased from that day.\n\nThe Royal Commission said: \"Let us see what has happened in cases where the 588 death penalty has been removed.\" They took the greatest trouble to inquire into the cases of all those countries which at some time in their history removed the death penalty. In the course of his speech, the Lord Chancellor said that one could not tell what effect the deterrent had on people who did not commit the crime. But if you remove the deterrent and there are not more crimes committed, surely that is proof that the deterrent was not what it was supposed to be. It seems to me that it is a strong argument if you can show that in all the countries where the death penalty has been removed there has been no increase in the murder rate.\n\nBut the Royal Commission were not content with that. There are some countries where the death penalty was removed and subsequently restored. They inquired whether, when the death penalty was restored, the murder rate went down. There is no evidence whatever that it did. The Royal Commission were not content with that. They travelled to a great many of these countries. They investigated what is happening in the United States, where some States have the death penalty and some have removed it. They considered whether, in the cases where it had been removed, the effect had been one of reducing or of increasing the number of murders, and they found that it had no effect whatever. They took two adjoining States of a similar type, one of which had removed the penalty and the other of which had not, and they found that the curve of the murder rate had assumed almost an identical line in the two States. Therefore I suggest that when the Lord Chancellor says that he believes, and it is incontrovertible, that removing the death penalty will have the effect of increasing the number of murders, that is entirely unsupported by any direct evidence. It is not enough to say that the Royal Commission did not find any positive evidence; such evidence as that is as far as it is possible to go. The Royal Commission did produce those statements.\n\nThe Lord Chancellor says that he has read—and I have no doubt that he has—the bulk of the Report of the Royal Commission, and that in his opinion they have produced a negative result. But I should have thought that perhaps the most important person who would be influenced by the Report would be the Chairman of the Commission himself. I 589 know Sir Ernest Gowers personally very well indeed. He is not a man to be swayed by sentiment or by emotion; he is a hard-headed man. He has been long connected with the Civil Service and with the main institutions in this country. Sir Ernest Gowers joined this Commission, as he himself states, with no very definite opinion but, on the whole, thinking that probably it was necessary to retain capital punishment, and he says: In the end I became convinced that the abolitionists were right in their conclusions, though I could not agree with all their arguments, and that so far from the sentimental approaches leading into their camp and the rational ones into that of the supporters, it was the other way round. I could, of course, quote many passages from the Report of the Royal Commission and from many other sources, but in the short time that I am going to occupy your Lordships' House it seems to me that those things are pretty conclusive.\n\nI come now to the question of armed burglars. The Lord Chancellor again says that, to his mind, it is quite obvious that if the death penalty is removed a great many more burglars will carry arms than is the case at present. That does not rest upon any evidence: again, it rests upon opinion. It does not seem an unreasonable result, but the question is one of fact. In all the other countries where the death penalty has been removed, is it, or is it not, true that the number of burglars who go about armed has increased? The answer to that is that it is not true. Of course, the Lord Chancellor can get out of it by saying that those countries arc different from our own. Every country is different from every other country. The Lord Chancellor began by saying that the facts that I am quoting come only from countries where the police are armed. But he admitted afterwards that they come from other countries but argued that they were smaller countries than our own. You can always evade an argument by putting forward some condition which may not be fulfilled. But the simple fact is that in countries where the death penalty has been abolished there is no evidence whatsoever that the number of burglars who go about armed and commit murder has increased. It is not a sufficient defence in the act of taking life to say that you cannot prove your contention. In this enlightened age, in the second hall' of the twentieth 590 century, you have to show positively that there is evidence demanding the retention of the death penalty, and I venture to suggest to your Lordships that if you cannot do that you have no right to defend the continuance of this practice.\n\nI propose now to leave that aspect of the question and to come to one other, because though I notice that to-day it occupies a lesser place in the public mind, if I am not mistaken, when this question was before the House eight years ago it was one of the principal matters that was brought into account. It was said then that the countries that have abolished the death penalty have substituted real life imprisonment in its place—by that I mean that the man stays there until he dies. If, therefore, we are too humane to do that in this country, we should have to adopt the principle which we adopt in the case of other prisoners: we should have to release murderers after they have served a considerable term of years. I am going to deal with that aspect.\n\nFirst, your Lordships must realise that there is a very large number of murderers who are reprieved at the present time. They are reprieved, not because of doubt about their having committed the crime, but for various reasons appearing good to the Home Secretary of the day. Having served their sentence in prison they come out when the prison authorities consider it appropriate to let them out; and I believe that in the last fifty years there has been only one case in which it was alleged that one of those murderers committed another murder or even any other offence. Even that case is exceedingly doubtful, for later there were grounds for believing that the second murder was not committed by that man. In all but two of the countries that have (many of them for many years past) abolished the death penalty, no murderer has ever been known to commit another murder after his release. I will be quite fait; there are two exceptions. One is Belgium, where there have been three, the other is Denmark where there has been one; font in Holland, Luxembourg, Maine. Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Norway, Queens land, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wiscon sin, not a single such case has ever occurred.\n\n591 Not very long ago I had the privilege of meeting, in one of the Committee Rooms in these Houses of Parliament, the Ministers of Justice of Belgium, Norway and Sweden and the head of the Psychopathic Institute in Sweden. They were prepared to answer questions. They scoffed at the idea that there was any likelihood that the death penalty would be re-instituted in their countries. They said that the public of those countries were perfectly well satisfied with the way things were working. I asked them: \"How do you get on about letting your murderers out? Do they really have to stay in prison for the rest of their lives?\" They told me that they regard murderers as broadly of two classes: those who may be criminals but are perhaps actuated in murder by sudden impulse; and those who are psychopathic and who, though they may not be definitely lunatic, have a disordered mind. With regard to the first category, some of whom prove to be among the best behaved men in prison, they found that they could let them out, on average, after between ten and twelve years—some more, some less. Except for those to which I have already referred, there has been no repetition of the crime.\n\nPsychopathic murderers, having disordered minds, have to be treated in an institution but I was told that in those countries they effect a cure in a considerable number even of those cases. If, however, there is someone on the verge of lunacy, naturally he cannot be let out. These gentlemen said to me: \"You do not let your lunatics out of criminal asylums unless they are cured. They have to stay there for life because they cannot be trusted out.\" It is precisely the same case. If a man has a disordered mind he is a psychopathic patient. They told me, \"In the great majority of cases we can even cure those men, but if we cannot do so we have to keep them in an institution for the whole of their life, though that is no different from what you do here.\"\n\nMy Lords, I promised to be very short in order to give as much time as possible to other speakers, and I am not going to argue my case any longer. Those who will speak following me from the same point of view will give chapter and verse 592 for any questions raised. In conclusion I want to say only this: I take it that all of us, whichever side we may be on, regard this question of murder and capital punishment as not merely a rational question, but as a matter charged with deep emotion. We all have in our hearts a deep sense of disgust at the deliberate killing of a human being. But these emotions have to be governed by reason if they are to yield sound fruit. It is my firm opinion, and I believe the opinion of others who in regard to this Bill are on the same side as I am, that facts alone are what count. As I see it, the facts are overwhelmingly in support of our case, and the opposite view, however honestly and eloquently put forward, can be held only in the teeth of the evidence.\n\n§ VISCOUNT HAILSHAM\n\nMy Lords. I am certain that, even against the sombre backbround of the subject matter of this discussion, your Lordships would desire me to turn aside for a moment from the debate in order to welcome into our midst 599 the most reverend Primate who has just concluded his first speech to your Lordships, even though the fact of his maidenhood in this matter was cunningly concealed on the list of speakers. The most reverend Primate touched all our hearts when he referred to his illustrious predecessor. I think that we cannot wish anything better for him than that he should have as many useful years of active life in our midst as his predecessor enjoyed, and win as warm a place in our affections. I think that I speak with the hearts of all of us when I say that this beginning gives us good ground for hoping that this will be the case. The most reverend Primate said that he had an ambition to serve your Lordships by the interventions in debate that he would make. I can only tell him that that ambition has already been achieved and that we all look forward to many other occasions when he will achieve it not less fully.\n\nThere are two ways of approaching this debate. One could come down to the House with a wealth of argument and statistics and thought, carefully prepared in advance; but I have chosen the other way, which I hope will commend itself to your Lordships. Deliberately I did not determine in advance the particular arguments to which I would address myself. I had played some part in the controversy in another place in 1948. I wanted to be very sure that it should not be thought, however strong my opinions had been on that occasion, that I had not genuinely tried to review the situation in the light of all that had taken place since and, in particular, in the light of the speeches which have been made by your Lordships.\n\nI am glad that I chose this course of action, because I am bound to say that as I heard the noble and learned Viscount the Lord Chancellor develop his argument, I found that he was putting arguments on the merits of the discussion which, one after another, seemed to be put as well as arguments can conceivably be put—arguments which I found absolutely overwhelming. I should have stopped there but for the fact that I do not think the discussion can quite stop there. It must be apparent that, after so many years of controversy, apart from those who accept the assumptions which were rightly condemned by the most reverend Primate, 600 the real division of opinion in the country is on the weight to be attached to the undoubted fact that the statistics are inconclusive. I attach to that fact the opposite weight given to it by the noble Lord, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, and I attach to it exactly the same weight as was given by the noble and learned Viscount who sits on the Woolsack.\n\nMy reason for doing so, apart from the argument he so admirably expressed, is ultimately this. As the noble Viscount who so well moved the Second Reading said, murder is a crime which is extraordinarily difficult to categorise and classify. None the less, when all is said and done, the question is not whether we can measure (because we certainly cannot) the relative value of life imprisonment and hanging as a deterrent to murder—that is an argument which can never be solved by statistical material, for the reason which the noble Viscount gave. To my mind, the conclusive argument is the fact that, if this Bill becomes law, and your Lordships deliberately substitute life imprisonment for the penalty of death, we shall have a situation in which there will be a certain number of murders, possibly more numerous than the advocates of the Bill are prepared to admit, where there will be no deterrent for murder at all, or where the additional deterrent is only marginal. When I am faced with this proposition I am compelled to say that I regard the burden of proof as upon those who wish to bring about that situation. To my mind, that is a conclusive argument upon the merits of the debate.\n\nWhat do we look for from a penal code?—surely that it should be, so far as possible, humane; that it should be, so far as possible, logical, and, so far as possible, practical. That is where I part company with the noble Lord, Lord Pethick-Lawrence. Again and again we hear from those who differ from us the kind of argument that, because the penal code was inhumane and illogical, rather more than a hundred years ago, one should view the progress of penology as something which consists solely in the removal of excessive penalties. I do not so view it. Admittedly the so-called \"Bloody Code\" was inhumane. It was illogical also and it was illogical precisely for the reason that it deliberately encouraged murder. The old saying which dates from that time is, that it is as well 601 to be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb—in other words, if death is the penalty for robbery and for murder, there may be solid advantages in killing your victim. That is why the rate of violence decreased after the imposition of illogical penalties was removed, not because the fear of death no longer operated as a deterrent, as many advocates of the illogical code believed.\n\nThe effect of what your Lordships are invited to do this afternoon is to create a series of cases of murder in which the illogicality of the code is reimposed by making no difference, or no substantial or inadequate difference, in the mind of the criminal between the consequences of killing and the consequences of committing a crime without violence. That has always been to me the operative factor, and because the reasons were so well and fully put forward by the noble and learned Viscount on the Woolsack. I do not at this stage say anything more about it.\n\nBut I frankly do not think that the mere fact that a Second Chamber may think that a Bill proposed for Second Reading from the other place is a bad one is necessarily conclusive. The noble Lord, Lord Pethick-Lawrence, said that we might be faced with a constitutional crisis. I rather wonder why. I should myself be glad to defer to other people's opinion in this matter, if I felt it possible to do so. It is a case in which I am emotionally on the side of the abolitionists, even if intellectually I am convinced that they are utterly misguided. But I wonder on what principle one can conscientiously vote against one's conscience in a Second Chamber. If the Government told us that, in their view, the Bill was workable and to the public advantage, and I happened privately to disagree, then I feel I could find it in my heart to abstain. But here the opposite is the case. The Government tell us in both Houses of Parliament that they view the Bill as a public disaster. We are the trustees of a limited constitutional power. We have to exercise that trust responsibly, unprovocatively, but still legitimately. That constitutional power was revised as recently, I believe, as 1948 or 1949. By all the canons of construction and common sense, that means that circumstances must exist in which it is right for us to exercise that power.\n\n602 No doubt the other place can override us, and we shall feel no resentment if they do. But why they should try to make us the accomplices of what they desire, and then threaten us with the most frightful penalties if we will not become accomplices, I do not know. If they want to \"go it alone\", they can \"go it alone\". They will have the Government against them; they will have, I still believe, the Judiciary against them; they will have the police against them; trey will have the prison officers against them; and I have no doubt that they will have public opinion against them, too. But why they should feel it necessary to make us share their loneliness. I do not understand.\n\nThat is where I differ from my noble friend who moved the Second Reading of this Bill. Of course, I agree that this country is, and ought to be, governed by Parliament and not by momentary waves of public opinion. Here we are not, of course, representing constituencies. In another place Members are representatives and not delegates. But when another place says to us: 'We propose to go against the opinion of our constituencies, because we invoke the high doctrine of Burke, and then when we send it up to the Second Chamber we will complain of what the House of Lords does, because we invoke the high doctrine of democracy\", it seems to me that they are guilty of some slight inconsistency. The truth of this matter, to my mind, is that if one comes to the conclusion that the Bill is good, one must vote for it—and I am sure that noble Lords who have spoken in that sense will record their votes. But if that argument is false, and one is driven rather against one's inclinations to the view that it is a bad Bill, then there seems to be no alternative but to vote against it. If those who vote against it happen to be in a majority, then the consequences of majority rule have to be faced, even when you do not like them. The worst that can happen is that the other place will decide to \"go it alone\", and they will no doubt follow their own counsel in that matter.\n\nI should have been quite happy to give the Bill a Second Reading if it had been capable of amendment in a reasonable sense. The noble Viscount who moved the Second Reading of the Bill began his remarks with a proposition with which, with some qualifications. I wholeheartedly 603 agree. He said that the law of murder—I forget the epithets—is not perfect. I agree with him that it is a branch of the law in which clarity and perfection must be constantly sought after. If, therefore, this were a Bill for the amendment of the law of murder, I should feel, within reason, that the right course would be to give it a Second Reading and to amend it in Committee so as to reach out after perfection.\n\nBut this is a Bill which prevents amendment of the substantive law of murder; it is a Bill which would render it out of order to propose an amendment of the substantive law of murder. It is only a Bill for the attachment of a different penalty to murder. In so far as it can be amended, it can be amended only by taking out of that general exclusion an inner circle of non-exclusion, by citing particular kinds of murder which are not affected by the general ban on the death penalty while leaving the substantive law of murder unaltered. I do not believe that that is a dignified or, in the last resort, a possible method of promulgating to the country what the law of murder or the death penalty should he. That, I believe from the point of view of the abolitionists and the abstentionists. While, therefore, if the Bill went to Committee there might be Amendments which we should support as a second best, I do not think I can conscientiously put this Bill to the House as one that is capable of amendment. I think it would necessarily be a Bill which, even if amended, would render the state of the law worse than it is at the moment.\n\nThere is one other thing that I should like to say before I sit down. The noble Viscount who moved the Second Reading spoke at considerable length on the use of the Prerogative. I take the view—and here I do not think I should carry my noble and learned friend on the Woolsack with me—that over the last fifty years the use of the Prerogative has become too stereotyped. We none of us know for certain what the various categories are which constitute a sufficient reason for granting a reprieve. But I start with the proposition that there are many types of murder and many types of murderer, and that the attempt to categorise them by lawyers has hitherto failed. I should like to see the Prerogative used much more generously and 604 imaginatively. Not that I blame any individual Home Secretary for following the established custom in this matter. But I should like to see Home Secretaries go forward with the authority of Parliament in a more imaginative and constructive way of utilising that Prerogative.\n\nIf we did pursue that line, it might also be said that should the abolitionists be right, and those of us who are not persuaded by them be wrong, one could make a progressive utilisation of the Prerogative to enable changes to take place, with the complete certainty that public opinion was behind it, with a much more gradual and practical approach to the matter. If abolition were to come by that road, as it has already come in some countries, I should probably continue to think it a mistake. But if it were to come, that would be the royal road of progress, and not that which it is now proposed to take.\n\nWe are now asked to give a Second Reading to a Bill to which most of us cannot conscientiously give even a qualified blessing of any kind. We are asked to do that in the knowledge that the Government oppose it; in the knowledge that the police and the prison officers oppose it, with the solatium offered by the noble Viscount who moved the Second Reading that their conditions ought to be bettered. But whether recruiting would be more or less vigorous if to the existing arduousness of their professions were added the abolition of the death penalty, I must leave the House to judge We are asked to do it in the knowledge, or the belief, at any rate, that it does not appeal to the greater part of public opinion. I would agree, sadly, with the most reverend Primate in his maiden speech, that the division on this subject is deep and deplorable; but unless the minority is arrogantly to assume to itself the right against all opposition to rule the majority, then I believe that is an evil which cannot be helped.\n\n§ LORD CONESFORD\n\nMy Lords, I find this subject one of the most difficult with which we have been faced. I do not suppose there is a single one of us who does not number among his personal and intimate friends men who take opposite views on this great question. I find myself in so much agreement with what was said by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellors, and by my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham, that I can cut out a great deal of what I might otherwise have said. But I would repeat what has been said already by some noble Lords: that we are not in this Bill discussing the reform of the law of murder. If any question of the reform of the law of murder were involved—questions of constructive malice, insanity, provocation and so forth—there are many of us who would support some amendment. I would also say to the most reverend Primate, by whose speech I was most deeply impressed, as I think was the House that I do not think we are discussing either whether there are not some improvements that might be made in what I may call the process of capital punishment.\n\nMay I give two examples which occur to me? I am myself wholly opposed to the idea of returning a condemned prisoner to any prison where there are other prisoners. I am also wholly opposed to the present publicity given in advance about the time and place of execution. But those are not the questions that we are considering. We are considering the simple question: shall the death penalty for murder be abolished?\n\nI have never regarded that question as at all easy, and I am certain that we cannot derive a clear and simple answer to it by an over-simplification of the problem of punishment. I was delighted to hear what the most reverend Primate said on that subject. Ever since I read philosophy at Oxford many years ago, I have always thought that the problem of punishment presented one of the most difficult with which philosophers, theologians, lawyers and statesmen have to deal.\n\n607 Broadly, there are three main theories of the justification and purpose of punishment—retribution, reformation and deterrence. I am myself convinced that none of these theories can be pursued to the exclusion of both the others without producing absurd and even shocking results. Of course, punishment normally has all three aspects. These problems with which we so often torture ourselves have little reality to the man in the street. May I give your Lordships an example? Suppose a man sees a brute attack a child in the street and rushes to intervene and to knock him down. What is the rescuer likely to think or say? Is there not an almost equal chance of his saying any of these three things: \"I'll teach him\"; \"I'll give him his deserts\"; \"I'll see that he does not do it again, or that people do not do that with impunity\"? He may say any of those three things; and of course, according to which he has said, he has stated the reformatory, the retributive or the deterrent theory of punishment.\n\nIn another place I noticed that the honourable Member who seconded the Motion for the Third Reading of the Bill said, as though it were an almost decisive argument in his favour, that admission had been increasingly made that there was an element of retribution in the capital sentence. Of course there is. But is there not also an element of retribution in the alternative sentence of imprisonment for life? I believe, with the most reverend Primate, that retribution—which is, of course, quite distinct from personal vengeance; the principle is sometimes expressed in the two Latin words suum cacique—is the most fundamental aspect of punishment. If that principle is wrong, all punishment is wrong. Reformation or deterrence can have its place when we consider the form or method of punishment; sometimes both reformation and deterrence can have their place. But neither can justify punishment if retribution itself is wrong.\n\nI am glad to see that the view which I have been expressing is not confined to supporters of capital punishment. I would plead in aid not only the speech of the most reverend Primate this afternoon, for the doctrine which I have just explained was held with equal conviction by the late Archbishop Temple, who was, of course, opposed to capital punishment. 608 I wonder if I may read to your Lordships a few sentences from Archbishop Temple? He said that in all punishment there were the three elements which I have mentioned and that they may, of course, be active in very varying proportions. He said: These have usually been called the Retributive, the Deterrent and the Reformative. Personally, I hold that the essential element in what has been called retribution is not the infliction of pain to balance evil done, but is the action of the community in repudiating a criminal act. If, when a crime has been committed, the community does nothing, it is condoning the act, and to that extent becomes a partner in the guilt of it. If it treats the criminal\"— and I ask the House carefully to note these words— merely as a subject for remedial care it is ignoring his moral character. A little later in the same article, the late Archbishop Temple dealt with the question of deterrents: Now, so far as punishment is deterrent only, it is treating the criminal as a means to an end, and though the law which condemned him may aim at preserving him from the crime, the actual infliction of the punishment is mainly concerned with other people. So far as this is true, it is non-moral; and if there were no other element in any instance of punishment, it would he immoral, for it is always immoral to treat a person only as a means to some end other than his own wellbeing. Although I differ from the late Archbishop Temple in his conclusions on the question of capital punishment, I associate myself wholly with what he said in the passages which I have read about the three theories of punishment. As my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor pointed out, Lord Justice Denning said something of the same kind in the passage which is quoted in the Royal Commission's Report. The fact, therefore, that capital punishment is retributive does not help us at all in determining whether it is the best punishment for murder. What we have to determine is which of two punishments, both retributive, is better—death or imprisonment for life.\n\nBefore I consider that question, may I deal for a moment with a matter which has figured so largely in this controversy, both outside the House and in some allusions in the House this afternoon? Many have quoted Lord Ellenborough and other lawyers in the House over a century ago who opposed the abolition of the death sentence for small thefts. 609 In my view, those who took that line were terribly wrong, and I find their arguments shocking. But may I call the attention of the House to this fact: the House will note that Lord Ellen-borough and the rest would never have been led into that error by the retribution theory. They were led into their error by deterrence run mad.\n\nMy Lords, in choosing between death and life imprisonment as the penalty for some murders, we are choosing between two forms of retribution. In making that choice we can rightly consider, among other matters, which is the more calculated to deter. The noble and learned Viscount the Lord Chancellor has given reasons why it is difficult, and indeed impossible, to give absolute proof in this matter, but I would call attention to a few considerations which make me think —indeed, which convince me—that the death penalty does prevent a number of murders from being committed in this country. Let me mention again a matter which has been far too little mentioned in this controversy, although it was mentioned by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor. It is that to-day in this country we have the lowest homicide rate in the whole world.\n\nLet me put it to the House in this way. Every Member of the House has received a number of communications from outside bodies, all sincere and intended to help us; and all, one after the other, making the point that surely this country should abolish the death penalty and put itself in agreement with so many other civilised countries. But does it never occur to any noble Lord that, if he have the lowest homicide rate in the world, it may be that other countries could learn from us? Why should it be assumed that we must change our law of the punishment of murder, when the fact is that with this punishment—I do not venture to say whether as a consequence—as tempered by the exercise of the Royal Prerogative, we enjoy the lowest homicide rate in the world? I need not refer in detail to the passages on which I rely, but I would refer any noble Lord who is interested to pages 370 to 372 of the Royal Commission's Report.\n\nThat is my first reason for believing that the deterrent may be real and effective.\n\n610 My second reason is that given by my noble and learned friend Lord Hailsham. In some cases we shall be considering not which, in general, is the more effective deterrent, death or life imprisonment; we shall be considering, as Lord Hailsham quite rightly said, whether there shall be any real deterrent at all. As he pointed out, in the case of the habitual criminal engaged in a robbery for which he may be sent to prison for fourteen years, if nothing but long imprisonment is suggested as the penalty for murder, there will be no additional penalty before him to deter him from murder. As I have said, we have the lowest homicide rate in the world, but we have not a diminishing number of crimes of violence.\n\nThe next reason why I believe that the death penalty is a real deterrent is the fact that that is the strong conviction of the police, generally supported by the judges. Perhaps I may read a few sentences in paragraph 61 of the Report of the Royal Commission: Of more importance was the evidence of the representatives of the police and prison service. From them we received virtually unanimous evidence, in both England and Scotland, to the effect that they were convinced of the uniquely deterrent value of capital punishment in its effect on professional criminals. On these the fear of the death penalty may not only have the direct effect of deterring them from using lethal violence to accomplish their purpose, or to avoid detection by silencing the victim of their crime, or to resist arrest. It may also have the indirect effect of deterring them from carrying a weapon lest the temptation to use it in a tight corner should prove irresistible. These witnesses had no doubt that the existence of the death penalty was the main reason why lethal violence was not more often used and why criminals in this country do not usually carry firearms or other weapons. We must be very conceited if we claim that we know so much more about the habits of the criminal classes than do the police, who have to deal with them daily. I say that the evidence of the police is worthy of the greatest respect, especially when it is so often supported by the judges. I repudiate most strongly the suggestion that the Judges of the Queen's Bench Division throughout our history have been rather blood-thirsty men, generally in the wrong. I think it was my noble and learned friend Lord Oaksey, eight years ago, who pointed out that it was to the judges that we owed the doctrine of the presumption of innocence.\n\n611 I wonder whether I may say one personal word about the judges. In the debate eight years ago, a very valuable contribution was made on the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice Bill (when the question of capital punishment was only one of many questions involved) by the noble and learned Lord, Lord du Parcq, who spoke with great authority in this House, and charmed this House in all quarters. When I was called to the Bar long ago, in 1919, I went as a pupil to Herbert du Parcq (as he then was), and towards the end of my pupilage he invited me to stay on in his chambers. From then until he was appointed a Judge of the King's Bench Division, I was in daily contact and constantly having discussions with that very humane lawyer; and after he became a judge and, later, went to the Court of Appeal, and ultimately in your Lordships' House, he remained my very close friend.\n\nI remember, eight years ago, as a Member of another place, hearing, at the Bar of your Lordships' House, the speech which he made. Perhaps I may quote the few sentences with which the noble and learned Lord, Lord du Parcq, concluded his speech on April 28, 1948 [OFFICIAL REPORT, Vol. 155, Col. 519]: For my part, believing as I do that capital punishment is a deterrent. I shall not vote for that clause. You must record your own vote as if upon you alone rested responsibility. That, I suggest, is the only test by which to Judge. If it rested with me to decide, then in the future, whenever I read in the Press of a murder I would be mentally confronted with the question: would these innocent lives have been sacrificed, would those innocent relatives have been bereaved, if the capital penalty had been in existence? That would be much more for my conscience to bear than the thought that a few murderers had been executed. I come to the last of my arguments, to the effect that capital punishment is a direct deterrent. This, perhaps, is the most astonishing of all. It is an admission in another place by the promoter of this Bill himself. In another place, an Amendment was moved on the Committee stage which would have exempted from the operation of the Bill certain people by a proviso which said— Provided that this Act shall not apply in any case in which the murder was committed (a) in the furtherance of burglary et cetera, and (b) by the use by the person charged of some offensive weapon or instrument with which such person was himself armed. 612 That was the Amendment to which the promoter of the Bill had to address himself when he came to reply. By the Rules of your Lordships' House I am not at liberty to give his exact words but must give them by paraphrase. But I ask all your Lordships who wish to study this to turn to Columns 2077 and 2078 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of another place for May 16. The promoter of the Bill pointed out how useless this Amendment would be in dealing with gang warfare, because the master spirit would be encouraged to make certain that someone else used the weapon. A little later on, he pointed out that, if the Amendment were passed, it would be only the hand that fired the shot that would be held to be supremely guilty; and he suggested that the Committee could be quite certain that those who planned the murder would make absolutely sure that somebody else actually fired the shot. Could one have a clearer admission that, in the view of the promoter of the Bill himself, capital punishment provides a unique deterrent which imprisonment does not?\n\nI believe the death penalty to be a valuable deterrent. I also believe, with the late Alexander Paterson, that it is morally preferable to the proposed alternative. One of the extraordinary things in this great controversy is that each side thinks the other is lacking in imagination. The abolitionists think that we do not share the view that capital punishment is horrible, and those who uphold the death penalty think that the abolitionists are unimaginative when they come to deal with long imprisonment. I met the late Alexander Paterson in my student days and, like so many of us who knew him, even slightly, I was very much impressed by him. I do not claim that I knew him nearly so well as many of your Lordships in different sections of the House knew him, but I know it is suggested that he might have been prepared to revise the views which he so strongly expressed some years ago if he had been made aware of all the improvements in prison conditions that had taken place.\n\nMy Lords, I am unable to take that optimistic view. I still find a little shocking what is said, with great honesty, in the Report of the Royal Commission itself—I quote the concluding sentence of paragraph 657: that the principles now followed by the Secretaries of State in determining the actual length 613 of detention in each case are in general appropriate for the purposes of punishment, deterrence and the protection of the public, without undue risk of causing moral and physical deterioration in the prisoner; and that if, in exceptional cases an exceptionally long period of detention is called for, the additional risk of such consequences ought not to be held to rule it out. I cannot believe that that is a conclusion with which all humane men will agree.\n\nMuch has been said of the sanctity of human life. I think I need say nothing on that matter this afternoon, except to associate myself with what was said by the most reverend Primate. The matter was also dealt with by the right reverend Prelate the then Lord Bishop of Winchester in the debate in 1948. Absolute opposition to capital punishment has never been an unqualified principle of Christian thinkers or of the Church of England; but if the words \"sanctity of human life\" have an important meaning for the Christian, they must, I think, refer to the quality of life and not only to its duration. I believe that this Bill is wrong in principle and wrong in practice. Of course, I have considered, as have so many, whether, notwithstanding my personal convictions, this was a matter in which I could honestly bow to the will of the Commons and not record a vote against it. I can find no ground whatever on which I can justify abstention. How can we claim to be a Revising Chamber if, in a matter of this moment, we fail to record an honest vote? I blame no Member of another place who voted as his conscience dictated, even if, as the seconder of the Motion for the Third Reading admitted, he voted knowingly in defiance of the wishes of his constituents. For my own part, having long and carefully considered my duty, I shall vote as honesty compels me.\n\nTHE LORD BISHOP OF EXETER\n\nMy Lords, I shall not take up a great deal of your Lordships' time to explain why I propose to vote for this Bill, though undoubtedly some four or five years ago I should have voted against 626 it. I should have voted against it largely for the reasons given by the most reverend Primate who has spoken before me. It has been traditional in Christian ethics to allow the legitimacy of the taking of life by the community as the most extreme form of punishment at its disposal. That tradition has warrant in Scripture and is supported by reasons which I do not propose to elaborate this afternoon, since the most reverend Primate has done it for me and, in any case, the reasons are probably familiar to your Lordships. I should also have voted against the Bill largely because the retributive element of punishment is not only always properly present but is, indeed, properly predominant. It is for that very reason that care is always taken to ensure that the punishment is in proportion to the crime. If the punishment be over-severe, it is held to be unjust. It is for this reason, also, that the utmost care is taken to ensure that no man is punished except for those actions for which he is reasonably held to be responsible.\n\nIt seems to roe that over the years, latterly, there has been a growing uneasiness in the public conscience as to whether the imposition of the death sentence in cases of murder in this country does accurately reflect a proper retribution; that is, a growing uneasiness whether the imposition of the death penalty in certain cases of murder is just. That is so in two directions. The death penalty is the extreme penalty, beyond which there can be none worse. It should therefore be reserved as the most emphatic, dramatic mark of disapprobation, the detestation by the community of particular crimes.\n\nIt seems to many people that in this country there are now being committed some crimes which are more dangerous to the well-being of the community, and more detestable, than some murders; and they are crimes for which the criminals are undoubtedly morally responsible—crimes, such as the exploitation of the white slave traffic, the inculcation of drug addition in adolescents, or sustained cruelty towards a child. I think the public conscience regards criminal activities of those kinds as more detestable than some of the murders for which the murderers have been hanged. They have, therefore, a certain unease about the 627 imposition of the death penalty. I am not pleading that the death penalty should be extended to cover these crimes. I am saying only that the fact that the death penalty is not executed in the one case but is executed in the other creates in the public mind a sense of unease and a certain sense that justice is not being done.\n\nFurther, there is a public idea that some persons are hanged for murders for which they were not, in fact, wholly responsible, or are hanged for murders which were not, in any ordinary sense of the word, premeditated. It has already been said that the law of murder is sophistical. Certainly I think the common man of the English nation does not now understand the rulings which hold in the law courts. The common man does not understand why it is that in some cases a man is acquitted and in other cases he is not. I speak with the greatest respect before noble and learned Lords who are Judges of Her Majesty's Bench, but it is precisely because the Judiciary is so emphatic that distinctions and degrees of murder cannot be entertained in the law courts that the public mind is uneasy about the imposition of the death penalty. If the murder law could be reformed, and if there could be produced gradations of murder and gradations of penalty, then I believe a great deal of this public unease of which I speak would be removed. But I understand that that course is not possible; and therefore I shall vote for the Bill to abolish the death penalty altogether, so that I may aim to abolish what I conceive to be a grave evil—namely, public uneasiness of conscience.\n\nThe second element in punishment is, of course, that it should be reformative. I do not for one moment accept the argument of those in favour of the abolition of capital punishment on the ground that capital punishment, because it is final, cannot be reformative. There have been cases—perhaps a great number—in which the acceptance by the murderer of the justice of the death sentence imposed upon him has effected a reformation of character—and by \"reformation\" I mean a recognition of the wrongness of his action done, together with a will and desire to make atonement and to reform. Chaplains of prisons have spoken of more than one case where the death penalty has been reformative in that sense. But it is not necessary to impose the death 628 penalty in order to get this reformation. For this reason, also, I shall vote for this Bill, because I cannot believe that it is right to impose the death penalty unless it be necessary or near-necessary. But I shall vote for the Bill under this heading with the greatest caution.\n\nWe are told in the Scriptures not to fear those who can kill only the body and that after that there is nothing that they can do; we are warned that it is for God alone to destroy both soul and body in Hell. But it is certainly within the competence of a civilised community, while preserving the body, to destroy the soul in prison. I intend no criticism of the governor, chaplain and officers of Her Majesty's Prison at Princetown when I say that it seems to me to be almost inconceivable that any man can emerge from Dartmoor a better man than he went in. The chaplain tells me that in fact that does from time to time happen. All I can say is that it happens against all the odds.\n\nIt seems to me that by imposing long sentences upon murderers we should be running the risk of exposing them to a deep spiritual corruption. Therefore, to me, it is a corollary of the passing of this Bill that urgent reforms in our prison system should immediately be set in hand. It is not an easy problem which the authorities have to solve. I lay no claim to any expert knowledge on penal reform, but it is clear, is it not, that the sentence which is to be imposed on a murderer, if it be not the sentence of death, must be one which is severe. And in the early stages, at least, it must, I believe, hurt; because the sentence must reflect the detestation of the community for the crime which the murderer has committed. The sentence must make plain that the community hates the use of violence against any one of its members. Therefore, the punishment must be severe, and I think that probably it must be very long, because the community has the right to be reasonably sure that an offence which has been committed once will not be committed again. Therefore, the authorities must be given time to make themselves reasonably sure that the man's character is reformed.\n\nAbove all, if a man undergoes a really long sentence, the early stages of which are accompanied by severe discipline, then he must at every stage of it be 629 buoyed up with the emotion of hope: either hope for a release, or, if that seems almost too distant to hope for, then a hope that by good conduct, by loyalty and by acceptance of his punishment, he may earn ever-increasing privileges, and, as time goes on, may be entrusted with actual responsibilities and duties. Further, it is of the utmost importance that the plans already in being for an institution for the special treatment of the pathological cases should be pushed forward with all speed.\n\nI will riot weary your Lordships with arguments for or against the deterrent quality of the death sentence. Others far more competent than myself have laid, or will lay, before your Lordships all those arguments. All I would say is this. Until recently I was convinced that the death penalty must be retained because of its uniquely deterrent nature, but I am convinced by the evidence of the Royal Commission that it is not possible to say that the death sentence is uniquely deterrent. If it were, then surely it is an unavoidable conclusion that, wherever the death sentence is removed, the proportion of murders must increase. Of course the death penalty is a deterrent. My contention is that it can no longer be said to be a unique deterrent. Therefore it can no longer be said that it is necessary for the well-being and protection of society.\n\nMy last reason for changing my mind and voting for the abolition of the death sentence is that the imposition of the death sentence creates in the community a certain morbid and unhappy excitement which is had for general morals. It is difficult to assess the degree and nature of this morbidity, but I think your Lordships will all agree that it exists. One has only to look at the whole atmosphere which surrounds a murder trial, the whole manner in which murder trials ale reported in the Press, to realise this. I have no criticism of the Press to make. They print only what people like to read; and the fact that the papers print these long accounts of murder trials is in itself evidence of this morbid unhealthy interest of which I speak. The atmosphere is reminiscent of that which presumably obtained among a Roman mob seated in the Coliseum watching the gladiators fight for their lives. Again there is this morbid interest in all the details which the authorities can allow to be published 630 about the last moments which precede the execution and about the execution itself. These things are difficult to assess, but their existence cannot be denied; nor can it be denied, I believe, that they are a bad influence upon society.\n\nThe justification of capital punishment is, as I have said, that it is due to a man because of his gross misconduct, and that it marks emphatically the deep detestation in which the community holds his action. Deliberate, violent taking of the life of a fellow-member of society is a detestable act for which, in my judgment, the death penalty would be the entirely just one if it were necessary. But the effect of the death penalty, which is itself the violent taking of life, is, on the whole, to make the violent taking of life seem less detestable and less abhorrent than the community intends that it should appear. In other words, the death penalty as a mark of detestation for murder defeats itself. Instead of inculcating into the community an even deeper reverence for the sanctity of human life, the death penalty actually cheapens human life, and in the mind of an ordinary man depreciates the sanctity of that human life. It is for those reasons that I shall vote for the Bill.\n\n§ THE EARL OF HUNTINGDON\n\nMy Lords, at the beginning of the few remarks which I shall make, I should like to say that great stress has been put this afternoon—and perhaps rightly—on the opinions of Her Majesty's Judges. We have listened to a very powerful speech by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Oaksey, and various references have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Conesford, and others to the opinions of the Judges and the respect with which we should treat those opinions. I myself would yield to none in my respect for Her Majesty's Judges. I have the privilege of being a friend of one or two of them, and from what I have seen, from what I know and from what I have heard of their work, I think they are a standing example to the whole world. Their industry, their vast knowledge and their 633 absolute incorruptibility are things of which we can all be proud.\n\nNevertheless, there is a strange situation which has puzzled me: that when it comes to this question of arguing on the death penalty, and arguing in general about big deterrents such as flogging, or, in the old clays, even torture, we find that throughout history in this country the Judges have been unanimously on the side of capital punishment and on the site of the hardest penalties one could imagine. I should like to substantiate that statement with one or two examples. I will not go too far back, but in 1748 William York, a boy of ten, was sent"
