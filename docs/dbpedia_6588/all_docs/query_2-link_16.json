        "text": "The focus of Part I of this volume was to gain an understanding of the implementation of the death sentence in Scotland. It provided an exploration of the contextual and judicial drivers that impacted upon its use and quantitative analyses of focal periods to enhance our knowledge of Scotland’s capital punishment history between 1740 and 1834. Part II will now turn to present a qualitative exploration of public executions in Scotland and an investigation into the changing nature of capital punishment and execution practices across the period. It will also examine the implementation of the post-mortem punishments of dissection and hanging in chains, and situate their usage within the broader bodily punishment narrative.\n\nThe current chapter will provide some insight into the spectacle of the scaffold in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth and early nineteenth century by drawing upon the extensive source materials gathered, including newspapers and execution broadsides, which offer rich qualitative details of the scene at the public execution. The opening section will begin by questioning the role of the key actors of the event, namely the condemned criminals and the concourse of spectators gathered to witness them suffer their lamentable fate. The multitude of behaviours and responses that the execution spectacle could generate will also be considered. Following this exploration of the scene at the gallows, the chapter will examine the changes made to the logistics of the public execution including those related to its location. In Edinburgh, between 1660 and 1784, executions were conducted at the Grassmarket following a procession from the Tolbooth through the Old Town. However, in 1785 they were moved closer to the Tolbooth itself. At around the same time, and continuing into the early nineteenth century, Scotland’s circuit cities and towns began to follow suit, relocating their common place of execution from urban peripheries to locations closer to their places of confinement. In addition, other traditional elements of the scaffold ritual were subject to adaptation. Notably there was a decline in the need for a lengthy procession to the place of execution which had historically been a focal part of the proceedings. Despite these changes, the public execution continued to hold a pervasive attraction and drew large crowds throughout the period under investigation here.\n\nThe chapter will then move on to examine the changes made to execution practices. Although there is currently limited work that focuses upon Scottish execution practices, the discussion will draw upon the wider historiography discussed in Chap. 1 and combine this with the previously unexplored primary material utilised here. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was evident that the courts almost exclusively sentenced offenders to be hanged by the neck until dead, and aggravated executions that inflicted prolonged pre-mortem suffering upon the condemned, that were more characteristic of the Early Modern period, had declined significantly. However, the current study has identified the last examples of older execution practices in Scotland in the mid-eighteenth century. For example, one man was sentenced to be burnt to death and there were four cases where offenders were sentenced to have a hand severed as a prelude to their execution. The precedent for these punishments can be found in earlier centuries and sporadic decisions to use them in the mid-eighteenth century require further analysis when they are situated within a discussion of the long-term decline of aggravated executions. Furthermore, the chapter will provide a brief discussion of the broad changes that occurred to executions for treason in the ‘Long Eighteenth Century’. It will demonstrate that the perceived heinousness of the crime had long prompted distinct and severe judicial responses and, throughout much of this period, the sentence passed against those convicted remained largely unchanged in that they were to be hung, drawn and quartered. However, in practice, the executions were increasingly subject to discretionary implementation which blurred the line between an aggravated execution and a post-mortem punishment.\n\nThe post-mortem punishment of the criminal corpse had been a penal option prior to the mid-eighteenth century, but it was subject to discretionary implementation. However, the 1752 Murder Act placed it at the centre of the criminal justice system’s response to homicide. Despite this, the subject has been largely ignored by crime historians until recent pioneering research into the uses and treatment of the criminal corpse highlighted that the execution narrative extended beyond the end of the hangman’s rope.1 Chapters 6 and 7 will offer in-depth investigations into the use of dissection and hanging in chains in Scotland. However, this chapter will first situate the post-mortem punishment of the criminal corpse within the broader historiography of capital punishment in this period, particularly the meta-narrative pointing towards the changing nature of execution practices. In addition, it will highlight that there was a concentration of gibbeting in the mid-eighteenth century, on the eve of the Murder Act, that occurred at around the same time as older execution practices were disappearing. In examining the use of postmortem punishment to enact additional infamies to the death sentence, even before 1752, the chapter will identify an intermediate stage in the long-term decline of public bodily punishments in Britain.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, the purpose of this chapter was to build up a picture of the staging and scene at the scaffold across this period before exploring the changes that were made to the implementation of public executions. It has demonstrated that the theatre of the gallows was a public spectacle that could generate a diverse range of behaviours and reactions on the part of the central actors, the condemned criminals themselves, and the large concourse of spectators who gathered to witness the event. Whether the scenes were characterised by obstinate or penitent criminals and a raucous or a solemn crowd, they continued to offer a widespread attraction even though this period witnessed gradual but crucial changes to the public execution spectacle.\n\nFrom an examination of the different locations and times of executions as well as the adaptations to certain elements of the execution ritual, it becomes clear that this period was one of transition in the carrying out of the death sentence. However, this was a pattern of gradual progression rather than an instant break with older practices. For example, after most of Scotland’s circuit cities and towns had moved their common place of execution closer to the place of confinement there was a reduced need for certain parts of the scaffold ritual such as the procession. However, the lack of uniformity or central policy dictating these changes throughout the country, combined with the reintroduction of crime scene executions in the early nineteenth century, meant that the processional culture continued to be of central importance in several cases and could attract a large crowd. Some executions were all-day events and disrupted local areas that may not have witnessed a similar spectacle in living memory.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, capitally convicted offenders were almost exclusively sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead. However, this chapter has identified the last vestiges of older execution practices with one man sentenced to be burnt and another four to have their hands severed from their bodies immediately prior to execution. While there has been a relative dearth in studies of Scottish execution practices, it appears that the sentence of burning had been used in the Early Modern period to punish the crime of bestiality and, of course, this punishment was also characteristic of the witch trials. Similarly, the pre-mortem aggravation of hand-severing had been used to add severity to the death sentence for the commission of particularly heinous murders. However, from a reading of the available details of Scottish execution practices within legal commentaries, it certainly appears that these punishments had declined and that decisions to use them were sporadic by the mid-eighteenth century. The apparent difficulties in the carrying out of the punishment in Alexander Provan’s case in 1765, where his hand was not cleanly severed at the wrist and he was hastily hanged crying out in pain, may have also deterred the authorities from using this punishment again. This chapter has also explored the various contemporary legal distinctions attached to the crime of treason and the ideological ramifications of the need to suppress and prevent unrest. It has shown how the offence required swift and exemplary public responses that were steeped in the symbolism of state power. However, it has also demonstrated that the adaptations to public executions for treason across the ‘Long Eighteenth Century’ need to be situated within the broader contextual capital punishment narrative.\n\nThis study has thus far focused primarily upon the journey of the criminal from the courtroom to the gallows. It has set the scaffold scene and has examined the various hallmarks of the public execution spectacle in Scotland. However, it will now demonstrate that the journey of many capitally convicted offenders extended beyond the hangman’s noose. The criminal corpse was harnessed by the authorities as a means of inflicting further infamy to the punishment of death. In turn, the Murder Act’s prescription of the post-mortem practices of dissection and hanging in chains presents an intermediate stage in the long-term disappearance of public bodily punishment. The post-mortem evisceration of the criminal corpse, whether on the dissection table or in the gibbet cage, acted as a more exemplary form of punishment instead of the pre-mortem aggravations to the public execution found in previous centuries, a fact that has, until recently, been largely ignored by crime historians."
