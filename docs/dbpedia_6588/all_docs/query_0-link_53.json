        "text": "Scene 3\n\nSynopsis:\n\nEdmund sends Lear and Cordelia to prison and secretly commissions their assassination. Albany confronts Edmund and Goneril with their intended treachery against him and calls for the champion that Edgar said he would produce. Edgar himself, in full armor, appears to accuse Edmund of treachery. In the ensuing trial by combat, Edgar mortally wounds Edmund. Edgar reveals his identity, tells about his life as Poor Tom, and describes Gloucester’s death. A messenger announces the deaths of Regan (who has been poisoned by Goneril) and Goneril (who has committed suicide). Kent, no longer in disguise, arrives in search of Lear. Edmund confesses that he has ordered the deaths of Lear and of Cordelia. While a messenger rushes to the prison to save them, Lear enters bearing the dead Cordelia. As Albany makes plans to restore Lear to the throne, Lear himself dies.\n\nEnter in conquest, with Drum and Colors, Edmund;\n\nLear and Cordelia as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.\n\nEDMUND\n\n3251 Some officers take them away.

Come, let’s away to prison.\n\n3260 10 We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage.\n\n3261 When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down\n\n3262 And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,\n\n3263 And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\n\n3264 At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\n\n3265 15 Talk of court news, and we’ll talk with them too—\n\n3266 Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out—\n\n3267 And take upon ’s the mystery of things,\n\n3268 As if we were God’s spies. And we’ll wear out,\n\n3269 In a walled prison, packs and sects of great ones\n\n3270 20 That ebb and flow by th’ moon.\n\nEDMUND 3271 Take them away.\n\nLEAR\n\n3272 Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\n\np. 237\n\n3273 The gods themselves throw incense.

Either say thou ’lt do ’t,\n\n3289 Or thrive by other means.\n\nCAPTAIN 3290 40 I’ll do ’t, my lord.\n\nEDMUND\n\n3291 About it, and write “happy” when th’ hast done.\n\n3292 Mark, I say, instantly, and carry it so\n\n3293 As I have set it down.\n\n⟨CAPTAIN\n\n3294 I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats.\n\n3295 45 If it be man’s work, I’ll do ’t.⟩Captain exits.\n\nFlourish.

I am old now,\n\n3585 335 And these same crosses spoil me. ⌜To Kent.⌝ Who\n\n3586 are you?\n\n3587 Mine eyes are not o’ th’ best. I’ll tell you straight.\n\nKENT\n\n3588 If Fortune brag of two she loved and hated,\n\n3589 One of them we behold.\n\nLEAR\n\n3590 340 This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\n\nKENT 3591 The same,\n\n3592 Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\n\nLEAR\n\n3593 He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that.\n\n3594 He’ll strike and quickly too. He’s dead and rotten.\n\nKENT\n\n3595 345 No, my good lord, I am the very man—\n\np. 259\n\nLEAR 3596 I’ll see that straight.\n\nKENT\n\n3597 That from your first of difference and decay\n\n3598 Have followed your sad steps.\n\nLEAR 3599 ⌜You⌝ are welcome\n\n3600 350 hither.\n\nKENT\n\n3601 Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.\n\n3602 Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\n\n3603 And desperately are dead.\n\nLEAR 3604 Ay, so I think.\n\nALBANY\n\n3605 355 He knows not what he says, and vain is it\n\n3606 That we present us to him.\n\nEDGAR 3607 Very bootless.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\nMESSENGER 3608 Edmund is dead, my lord.\n\nALBANY 3609 That’s but a trifle here.—\n\n3610 360 You lords and noble friends, know our intent:\n\n3611 What comfort to this great decay may come\n\n3612 Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,\n\n3613 During the life of this old Majesty,\n\n3614 To him our absolute power; you to your rights,\n\n3615 365 With boot and such addition as your Honors\n\n3616 Have more than merited. All friends shall taste\n\n3617 The wages of their virtue, and all foes\n\n3618 The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!\n\nLEAR\n\n3619 And my poor fool is hanged. No, no, no life?\n\n3620 370 Why should a dog, a horse, a rat have life,\n\n3621 And thou no breath at all? Thou ’lt come no more,\n\n3622 Never, never, never, never, never.—\n\n3623 Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\n\n3624 [Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,\n\n3625 375 Look there, look there!He dies.]\n\np. 261\n\nEDGAR 3626 He faints. ⌜To Lear.⌝ My lord,\n\n3627 my lord!\n\nKENT\n\n3628 Break, heart, I prithee, break!\n\nEDGAR 3629 Look up, my lord.\n\nKENT\n\n3630 380 Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him\n\n3631 That would upon the rack of this tough world\n\n3632 Stretch him out longer.\n\nEDGAR 3633 He is gone indeed.\n\nKENT\n\n3634 The wonder is he hath endured so long.\n\n3635 385 He but usurped his life.\n\nALBANY\n\n3636 Bear them from hence. Our present business\n\n3637 Is general woe. ⌜To Edgar and Kent.⌝ Friends of my\n\n3638 soul, you twain\n\n3639 Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.\n\nKENT\n\n3640 390 I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;\n\n3641 My master calls me. I must not say no.\n\nEDGAR\n\n3642 The weight of this sad time we must obey,\n\n3643 Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n\n3644 The oldest hath borne most; we that are young\n\n3645 395 Shall never see so much nor live so long.\n\nThey exit with a dead march."
