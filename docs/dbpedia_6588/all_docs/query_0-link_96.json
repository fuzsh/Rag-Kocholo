        "text": "Introduction\n\nAlthough much gives the impression of this being a love song, it’s apparent from the title and the opening lines that it’s far from being just that. While many expressions are appropriate to a love song, even down to the addressee being called ‘gal’ and ‘baby’, not much of what the narrator says would actually be addressed to a woman. On several occasions he seems to be expressing a largely unconscious desire for God. Accordingly, the song can in part be seen as presenting the narrator’s pursuit of ultimate value. To that extent the love-song form provides a structure on which to hang the story of the narrator’s – and, as will be seen, mankind’s – progress towards redemption.\n\nWhile the song comprises the narrator’s thoughts, it’s surprising to find that these imply his presence at events throughout the history of the world. It’s important to note too that the order in which his thoughts are presented is far from chronological. It’s not simply that he’s going over events in the random order they occur to him, although on one level this would be the case. It’s that events are either conflated or seem to occur in an order which is impossible. This suggests that the narrator is seeing, or imagining seeing, events from an eternal perspective – one outside of time. This in turn suggests that what he unconsciously longs for from a temporal perspective– to be with God – is already the case if viewed from an eternal one.\n\nAt the end of the song the narrator’s focus seems to revert to the woman and having ‘a whoppin’ good time’. It’s left open whether this is in conflict with his pursuit of spiritual renewal.\n\nThe piece comprises eleven main sections.\n\n1. The Sun\n\nAlthough not mentioned explicitly, the sun exerts an influence throughout the song. While the sun itself might represent good, its continual rising and setting –\n\n‘From east to west\n\nEver since the world began’,\n\n– can be taken as a representation of alternating good and bad as it is evident in human beings. Thus the addressee – the woman or perhaps the narrator himself – is said to do\n\n‘… good all day’\n\nbut\n\n‘… wrong all night’\n\nwith night and day being the times of the sun’s presence and absence.\n\nInitially there’s a contrast between the sun and the narrator, thus representing the narrator’s distance from good. This distance is indicated by their differing modes of travel. While the sun has moved with easy regularity\n\n‘From east to west\n\nEver since the world began’,\n\nThe narrator, by contrast, has had to make do not only with\n\n‘… travelling by land’\n\nbut\n\n‘… trampling through mud’\n\nThere being no mention of his arrival at any destination serves to make the contrast between him and the sun all the greater. The sun has repeatedly completed its east/west journey. If the sun’s rising represents good and the end of bad then the narrator,\n\n‘Travelling through the dawn of day’\n\nhas only begun to achieve goodness. It’s the narrator’s journey towards good that the song is about.\n\nTraditionally, by way of a sun/Son pun, the sun represents Christ. Accordingly, as we’ll see, the narrator’s journey towards good is a journey towards his realising his potential to be Christ.\n\nIf this is so, when the narrator says to the woman:\n\n‘You think I’m over the hill’\n\nthis means more than, as he puts it in the next line, that he’s past his prime. The ‘hill’ would be Calvary, and the narrator by unconsciously associating himself with the sun, identifies himself with Christ.\n\n2. The Narrator as Mankind\n\nWhile the narrator is an individual, he can also be taken to represent mankind. The song presents this through biblical mythology beginning with a reference to the creation myth which opens Genesis. The narrator is\n\n‘Traveling through the dawn of day’\n\n– that is, he’s at the beginning of time. Later, as Adam, he’s recollecting his time in the Garden of Eden – Paradise – and regretting the consequences of original sin:\n\n‘I can’t go back to Paradise no more’1\n\nConflated with this is the killing of Christ for which he admits responsibility:\n\n‘I killed a man back there’\n\nIt is clearly mankind generally rather than the individual narrator who brings about the Fall and much later the death of Christ.\n\n3. Mankind as Christ\n\nOn one level the narrator’s language distances him from Christ. Apparently addressing Christ, he says\n\n‘They brag about your sugar’,\n\nThat he’s addressing Christ is apparent from a later association of what is presumably Christ’s voice with sweetness:\n\nYour sweet voice\n\nCalls out from some old familiar shrine’\n\nHowever, the language also implies an identity between mankind – and hence the narrator with whom mankind is identical – and Christ. This is because the unspecified ‘they’ that ‘brag about your sugar’ would seem to have to be people generally. And if they’re bragging, that implies that they possess Christ’s sweetness since you can only brag about something which is yours to brag about. This too, then, is an indication that mankind is to be identified with Christ.\n\n4. Salvation\n\nThe narrator, then, appears both as Christ’s killer and Christ.\n\nOn the one hand this suggests that in killing Christ the narrator is in effect killing himself – morally. On the other his identity with Christ suggests that since Christ provides salvation, the narrator is capable of providing his own salvation.\n\nWhereas as Christ’s killer he says he\n\n‘… can’t go back to Paradise no more\n\nI killed a man back there’,\n\nhe later unconsciously recognises that he can ‘go back to Paradise’, in the sense of heaven or a pre-lapsarian Garden of Eden. In his capacity as Christ he becomes his own redeemer, negating the wrongs of the past. That this is so is implied when he says:\n\n‘I won’t be back till fall’\n\nWhile on a conscious level he’s addressing the woman, unconsciously he’s realising that he was wrong to say he can’t go back to Paradise. He’s now saying he can ‘go back’ and ‘be back’. He can achieve salvation.\n\n5. Further Indications of the Narrator’s identity with Christ\n\na) The Passion\n\nAs the song progresses, there are further indications of the narrator’s identity with Christ. It’s likely that when he says\n\n‘I’m sweating blood’\n\nand\n\n‘I been in a brawl’\n\nhe’s speaking as Christ. The references would be to Christ’s passion at which time Luke’s gospel compares his sweat to blood (Luke 22:44). Since the passion includes the disruption in the temple, the ‘brawl’ might well be a reference to Christ’s overturning money-changers’ tables and the victims’ presumably none-too-conciliatory reactions. When in the next line he’s\n\n‘… feeling the wall’\n\nhe’s actually becoming aware that the writing is on it. He won’t escape crucifixion.\n\nb) The Crucifixion\n\nPerhaps the most direct indication of the identity between the narrator and Christ comes in the lines\n\n‘High on the hill\n\nYou can carry all my thoughts with you’\n\nGiven the other biblical references in the song, the hill can be taken as Calvary so that the carrier of the narrator’s thoughts is Christ. If Christ has the narrator’s thoughts, in a sense he is the narrator.2\n\nThe significance of this is that it represents a small progression from the earlier\n\n‘I keep thinking about you baby’\n\nin which the addressee – whether Christ or the woman – is a wholly separate object of thought.\n\nc) The Resurrection\n\nAn early reference to the resurrection can be gleaned from a remark whose colloquial language suggests is addressed to the woman:\n\n‘Then you turned up again’\n\nAt the same time the narrator might unconsciously be addressing Christ. The use of the second-person ‘you’, though, suggests he’s still objectifying Christ – seeing Christ as a different person from himself.\n\nFurther references to the resurrection are seen remarks in which the first-person ‘I’ shows the narrator to be identifying himself with Christ. These are\n\n‘I can’t stay away’\n\nand the later, more precise\n\n‘I’m going away baby\n\nI won’t be back ‘til fall’\n\nBoth ‘going away’ and staying away can be seen as references to Christ’s impending death, while not being able to stay away and being ‘back’ would refer to the resurrection. What on the surface is the narrator informing the woman of his plans is Christ saying he’ll rise from the dead.\n\nd) Christ’s Dual Nature\n\nThe identity of the narrator and Christ is also suggested by the line\n\n‘This love could tear me in two’\n\nWhile on the surface we can take it as Christ anticipating the horrendous physical consequences for him of his love for mankind, it can also be taken as a reference to his dual nature. In order to save the world, Christ is anticipating tearing himself in two so as to be not just God but – as Christ – man.\n\n6. Love\n\nThe narrator can be associated with love in both the ‘eros’ sense – his desire for the woman – and in the ‘agape’ sense – love for mankind. While both senses are involved when he says\n\n‘You got a face that begs for love’,\n\nthe ‘agape’ one is particularly important in that he can be taken as addressing the world. This is because the world is also referred to as having a face:\n\n‘Darkness on the face of the deep’\n\nIt’s the world – mankind – whose face is begging for love and accordingly the word ‘begs’ can be taken literally. Those who are reduced to begging need the love of those around them. The cure for the darkness on the world’s face will be the sun – Christ, or what Christ represents.\n\nHowever, it’s no use the narrator’s relying on Christ to provide the love if he is identical with Christ. He will need to provide that love himself.\n\nWhether the narrator is up to the task is far from certain. When, despairing of winning the woman, he says\n\n‘If I can’t have you\n\nI’ll throw my love into the deep blue sea’,\n\nhe’s threatening to renounce love altogether. He’s in a similarly selfish frame of mind when he says:\n\n‘I take care of what belongs to me’\n\nfor he seems to be saying he won’t take care of anyone he ‘can’t have’.\n\nHowever, the threat to dispose of his love in ‘the deep blue sea’ is also open to a different interpretation which goes beyond his renouncing love. It suggests he’s capable of a more genuine love than the love he thinks of as ‘having’ the woman. This is because the ‘deep’ into which he threatens to cast his love is the same ‘deep’ whose face is covered in darkness and is\n\n‘… a face that begs for love’\n\n– the primeval world or mankind. By throwing his love ‘into the deep blue sea’, he’d be giving mankind the love for which it is begging.\n\nParadoxically, then, he’s being presented as both a denier and a provider of love. And as a provider of love he’s also, as part of mankind, a recipient of that love.\n\n7. The Way\n\nIt seems likely then that the narrator, perhaps unconsciously, accepts that he has a responsibility to satisfy those who beg for love.\n\nThis is again shown when he says\n\n‘You burned your way into my heart’\n\nThe phrase ‘your way’ suggests the addressee could be Christ. This is because it reminds us of the phrase attributed to Christ in John 14.6 ‘I am the way, the truth and the life’. As such he seems to be acknowledging that while it was difficult for him to accept that he needs to show love to others, he has now done so. Christ’s ‘way’ promises to be his way of living his life.\n\nWe’re reminded again of this approach by the occurrence of the word ‘way’ on several other occasions throughout the song – in ‘You’re always on my mind’, ‘I can’t stay away’, ‘I always knew’, ‘I want to be with you any way I can’, and ‘I’m going away baby’.\n\n8. The Narrator’s Development\n\nDespite indications that the narrator is willing to provide the love that the world needs, this is slow to develop.\n\nInitially his outlook is one of lethargy. When he describes himself as being\n\n‘… as pale as a ghost’\n\nhe makes himself seem ill and incapable of action. Accordingly at this stage he’s comparing himself to a common-or-garden ghost – he’s nothing like the much more active Holy Ghost, the ‘Spirit’ present at the beginning of the world which is alluded to in the song’s title and opening line.\n\nRather than being active, the narrator makes demands on others:\n\n‘Put some sugar in my bowl\n\nI feel like laying down’\n\nAnd while he hears Christ’s\n\n‘… sweet voice’\n\ncalling out to him, he wants that sweetness – or love – to be provided for him but not to have to provide it for others.\n\n***\n\nGradually, however, the narrator’s outlook changes.\n\nRather than feeling like laying down, he’s more actively\n\n‘… feeling the wall’\n\nThis suggests that while he’s failed as yet to see the writing on the wall, by feeling it he’s becoming dimly aware that he has a responsibility of self-sacrificial love for others.3\n\nProgress from the passive to the active is also in evidence when blackmail –\n\n‘If I can’t have you\n\nI’ll throw my love into the deep blue sea’ –\n\nis replaced by the more positive\n\n‘I see you there\n\nI’m blinded by the colours I see’\n\n– the ‘you’ being as much Christ or the Holy Ghost as the woman he’s consciously addressing. While there’s still no activity beyond the initial promise to do something negative, the focus now is on a multiplicity of bright colours rather than the narrator’s own pallor and the dark blue of the sea.\n\nFurthermore, the sea itself loses its objectivity and becomes the reiterated, more active, ‘I see’. The narrator, by way of the ‘sea’/’see’ pun is being associated with mankind and it’s a mankind which is capable of taking on its responsibilities.\n\n***\n\nFurther progress towards activity comes with the move from\n\n‘When you are near\n\nIt’s just as plain as it can be’\n\nto\n\n‘I’m saying it plain\n\nThese ties are strong enough to bind’\n\nThe development here is from a bland acceptance of what is the case to an active assertion. It’s from an acceptance of its being plain that he’s wild about the addressee to his actively saying it’s plain. This amounts to an endorsement of the relationship in that there’s an active commitment to the relationship’s binding permanence. Again, what is consciously said about the narrator’s relationship with the woman on an unconscious level can be taken as applying to his relationship with God.\n\n***\n\nEarly on, the narrator expected the addressee to be active – such as demanding that sugar be ‘put’ in his bowl. This demand for activity on the other’s part is also seen when he says\n\n‘You ought to be a fool about me’\n\nLater on, however, he’s no longer expecting the addressee to be active while he remains passive:\n\n‘You don’t ever\n\nHave to make a fuss over me’.\n\nThe implication is that he’ll now be self-reliant and take on his responsibilities.\n\n***\n\nThe narrator also shows a developing maturity when he expresses in positive language what he’s previously expressed negatively. The whinging:\n\n‘Life without you\n\nDoesn’t mean a thing to me’,\n\nwith its two negatives is replaced by the entirely positive\n\n‘I could live forever\n\nWith you perfectly’.\n\nLikewise, the again whinging\n\n‘Sometimes I wonder\n\nWhy you can’t treat me right’\n\nis replaced by the totally contrasting up-beat final line of the song:\n\n‘We can have a whoppin’ good time’\n\nFor most of the song the narrator’s outlook is negative, the word ‘can’t occurring constantly – ‘can’t hardly sleep’, can’t stay away’, ‘can’t explain’, ‘can’t have you’, ‘can’t treat me right’, ‘can’t believe these things’ and ‘can’t go back’.\n\nBy contrast there are just a few ‘can’s – ‘as plain as it can be’, ‘be with you any way I can’, ‘you can carry all my thoughts’ and ‘we can have a whoppin’ good time’. However, it’s significant that three of those ‘can’s occur near the end – again suggesting that the narrator’s outlook is becoming more mature by his coming to focus on the positive.\n\nThus\n\n‘You can carry all my thoughts with you’\n\nhas the narrator actively giving his thoughts whereas earlier in saying\n\n‘You got the key to my brain’\n\nhe’d wanted to play no part in their unlocking.\n\n9. Existing forever\n\nThe narrator’s travelling, referred to at the beginning of the song, is not confined to land. He also travels through vast swathes of time.\n\nThe song begins with the creation of the world at which he appears to have been present. That presence is explicitly alluded to when he refers to\n\n‘Travelling through the dawn of day’.\n\n‘[D]awn’ here could mean either the beginning of a particular day or the beginning of days generally. On the latter interpretation the narrator has travelled through time from the beginning of existence right up to the present day, as indicated by the reference to a phone line in\n\n‘I hear your name\n\nRinging up and down the line’,\n\nand by other modern idioms in the song.\n\nThat the narrator was there at the beginning of existence is also apparent from the lines identifying him with the sun (and, via the sun, with Christ) which has travelled:\n\n‘From east to west\n\nEver since the world began’\n\nThe narrator’s existence throughout the whole of time might also be indicated by the use of ‘always’ in\n\n‘I always knew\n\nThat we were meant to be more than friends’\n\nThe hint to this effect continues when he says:\n\n‘I’m a thousand times happier than I could ever say’\n\nBy including ‘ever’ he appears to be claiming to be happier than he could say even if he had the whole of time at his disposal. The word ‘ever’ occurs a further five times in the song. In two, it’s the whole of the past that’s indicated:\n\n‘You ever seen a ghost?’\n\nand\n\n‘Ever since the world began’.\n\nAnd In three it’s the whole of the future:\n\n‘Can’t believe these things would ever fade from your mind’,\n\n‘I could live forever’\n\nand\n\n‘You don’t ever\n\nHave to make a fuss over me’\n\nWhile for the narrator the words ‘ever’ and ‘forever’ are purely temporal, albeit that they refer to the totality of time, it would seem that on an unconscious level the narrator is aware that his existence extends beyond time. It’s eternal.\n\n10. Eternal Existence\n\nThat the narrator’s existence is eternal – that is outside the normal structure of time – is supported by his apparently, and paradoxically, existing simultaneously at different times.\n\nDifferent times become conflated when in a particularly economical couplet original sin becomes one with the crucifixion, and ‘Paradise’ refers simultaneously to both heaven and the Garden of Eden:\n\n‘I can’t go back to Paradise no more\n\nI killed a man back there’\n\nAs representative of mankind the narrator was responsible, as Adam, for original sin in the Garden of Eden and, apparently simultaneously, for the crucifixion\n\nHis part in original sin and the later murder of Christ mean he’s now, in the present, locked out of Paradise in another sense, heaven.\n\nHe complains that this punishment\n\n‘… seems so unfair’\n\nBut that’s perhaps because he’s viewing it from a temporal perspective. From an eternal perspective in which there is no time, there’d be no distinction in time between his act of killing Christ and his repentance for it should that occur. There’d be no unfairness, therefore, since from an eternal perspective at no point would he have been prevented from entering Paradise. Indeed from an eternal perspective he has the ability to do what is impossible temporally – to be in the Garden of Eden before the fall. Hence when, as Christ, he refers to his crucifixion and death:\n\n‘I’m going away baby’,\n\nhe can ‘prophesy’ his ‘return’ at the much earlier Fall of man in the Garden of Eden:\n\n‘I won’t be back till Fall’4\n\n11. Random Order of Recollection\n\nWhile the narrator’s existence is eternal, there are further departures from the normal temporal order of events which would seem unconnected with the temporal/eternal distinction. Things which have yet to happen appear as already having happened. This is presumably because this is the order in which the narrator is going over them in his mind.\n\nThus while the statements\n\n‘I’d forgotten about you\n\nThen you turned up again’\n\nare made early in the song, they only makes sense if they would have actually been spoken after the much later lines referring to the crucifixion and resurrection:\n\n‘I’m going away baby\n\nI won’t be back till fall’\n\nIt makes sense to see the actual forgetting about Christ as taking place between the crucifixion and resurrection when the narrator first realises in horror that he’s failed to remember. At first he refuses to accept it:\n\n‘I got no choice\n\nCan’t believe these things would ever fade from your mind’\n\nIt’s only later, despite its occurring earlier in the song, that in addressing Christ he’d have been able to admit:\n\n‘I’d forgotten about you\n\nThen you turned up again’\n\nThat this revised order is the true order in which the lines would have been spoken is supported by the fact that the negative language of the less mature narrator – ‘I got no choice’ and ‘Can’t believe’ – now comes first. ‘I got no choice’ sounds like an excuse and ‘Can’t believe’ sounds like the sort of thing people say when they know full well that that whatever it is they’re claiming not to believe is in fact the case. It’s not true that he’s ‘got no choice’. He could admit he forgot – as he ultimately does.\n\nIn contrast, although it occurs earlier in the song, ‘I’d forgotten about you’ is said relatively straightforwardly. It sounds more mature and this supports its occurring later.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe song is about us. It’s about mankind’s imperfect nature and the possibility of its redemption or ultimate forgiveness. The biblical ideas which are alluded to along the way are not presented straightforwardly. They’re distorted so that, for example, the Fall and the Crucifixion are treated as one event. The temporal distortion which this involves extends to the narrator who, apart from being present at the Creation, is simultaneously Adam, the murderer of Christ and a lover in the present day. It’s by way of this that he’s a representation of mankind. It’s through his memories that we’re able to trace mankind’s moral development.\n\nInitially he, or mankind, looks to Christ to bring about this moral development. Gradually, though, he comes to see that his redemption must lie in his own hands. Effort is required – he must redeem himself. He must, as it were, become Christ.\n\nOn an eternal level, however, that identity with the deity is presented as already existing. It’s because of it that the narrator is able to be present throughout time. It’s also apparent when we realise that words he speaks are as much Christ’s as his. What is not clear is whether at the temporal level the narrator, or mankind, will make the effort required for redemption and so, effectively, to become Christ.\n\nNotes\n\n1/4. In the online transcript ‘Paradise’ and ‘Fall’ are not capitalised. I’m assuming this is an oversight.\n\n2. But there’s another interpretation which can run alongside this one. This is that the narrator is imagining Christ speaking to him ‘on the hill’. He represents man suffering and being comforted by Christ.\n\n3. In Daniel 5, the writing on the wall is a prediction that Belshazzar’s days are about to end. For the narrator, it would be the consequences of a selfish existence.\n\nIntroduction\n\nReferences to ‘bootleggers’ and ‘the Darktown Strut’ suggest that the song is set during the Prohibition period. This is of little significance in itself although the references do enable us to infer things about the narrator’s character.\n\nWhat we seem to have are the narrator’s thoughts as he tries to extract himself from a predicament. A former lover (presumably much younger and possibly self-interested) wants to resurrect their earlier relationship, one which ended years previously. At some points it’s possible to interpret the song as showing that the narrator too is tempted to restart the relationship. For the most part, though, he’s intent on rebuffing her and telling her to get on with her life. Even so, we’re given no reason to suppose that the decision not to resume the relationship isn’t right. It’s just that it would be based on intuition. He can bring no good reasons to bear in support.\n\nAs the song progresses, we increasingly learn more about the narrator’s character. We can’t trust him since he’s constantly disguising the truth in language favourable to himself and which belittles the woman. He’s a womaniser, duplicitous and opinionated. He has a tendency to deceive himself. He’s also vicious and vindictive. Much of the time he’s able to convince himself not by sound reasoning but by the conscious or unconscious use of rhetorical language – imperceptibly sliding, for example, between two different meanings of the same word.\n\nThe narrator comes across as immoral in a variety of ways. Nevertheless, just as his attitude towards the relationship is ambiguous at times, so is the extent of his immorality. There are indications that he feels both guilt and regret.\n\nThe piece comprises eight main sections before the Conclusion:\n\nThe first verse\n\nExcuses for not reviving the relationship\n\nDuplicity\n\nWomanising\n\nLove\n\nIncompetence\n\nRhetorical language\n\n(Creating an illusion of certainty, Self deception, Gratuitous condemnation, Vindictiveness)\n\nAttitude to guilt\n\n1. The first verse\n\nThe opening two lines of the song, with their transition from the literal to the figurative, are beautiful! In the second line we learn that the sun and the physical discomfort referred to in the first can be taken as metaphors:\n\n‘I got my back to the sun ‘cause the light is too intense\n\nI can see what everybody in the world is up against’\n\nOn a literal interpretation, the narrator has taken steps to avoid being dazzled by the sun. But since ‘see’ in the second line is clearly used metaphorically to mean ‘have knowledge of’, we need to take the sun in the first line as a metaphor for the provider of knowledge.1\n\nThis suggests we take the narrator’s turning away from the light as his shunning an unpalatable truth. And given that the sun had been blinding him, it would seem to be a truth about himself that he has found unpalatable or ‘too intense’. Despite this there’s compensating knowledge to be had. With clearer vision, he realises, he’s better equipped to understand the problems of others. However it’s likely he acquires less understanding than he thinks. It’s absurd that he claims to ‘see what everybody in the world is up against’.\n\nThe third line gives us an example of what he’s supposedly learnt:\n\n‘You can’t turn back – you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far’\n\nTaken as addressed to the woman, this line also has beauty due to the heartfelt yearning suggested by the emphasis falling on long vowles in:\n\n‘… can’t turn back’,\n\n‘… can’t come back’,\n\nand\n\n‘… sometimes we push too far’\n\n(or ‘fa-aa- ar’ as Dylan sings it). The narrator is refusing to countenance the possibility of her returning to him. And mysteriously the beauty intensifies as we realise that ‘we push’ is disingenuous in implying, absurdly, that he too has been pushing for her return. Far from actually yearning for the woman, the narrator is rejecting her.\n\nOn the other hand, the line doesn’t just have to be taken as addressed to the woman. The narrator could be addressing himself. ‘You can’t turn back’ would express what he takes to be the impossibility of his agreeing to resume the relationship. He’d be continuing to treat it as over. And if by ‘You can’t come back’ he means one can’t come back, he’d be reassuring himself that it’s never the case that someone can retrace their steps.\n\nThe final line of the verse,\n\n‘One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are’,\n\nwhile seeming to be addressed to the woman, could likewise also be taken as addressed to himself. He’d be admitting to being blind in having even considered getting back with the woman.\n\n2. Excuses for not reviving the relationship\n\nThat the narrator is just making an excuse for not restarting the relationship can be inferred from his own words. It’s untrue that\n\n‘You can’t turn back …’.\n\nThis is indicated symbolically by the fact that turning – and, literally, turning his back – is just what he’s done:\n\n‘I got my back to the sun …’\n\nIf he has turned his back so that he’s no longer blinded, then it’s clear that turning is not out of the question. Re-starting the relationship is not as impossible as he’s making out.\n\nHaving said ‘You can’t turn back’, he then emphasises this with\n\n‘You can’t come back’\n\nAlthough the change to ‘come back’ might seem of little significance in itself, we’re reminded of the line when later he declares:\n\n‘Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick’\n\nThe use of ‘come’ in these lines causes us to see each in the context of the other with the result that the second provides a reason for questioning what was said in the first. It suggests it might not be true that there can be no coming back. On the contrary, the woman’s coming back might result in sudden happiness.\n\nThe claims that ‘You can’t turn back’ and ‘You can’t come back’ appear, then, to be less true than the narrator would have us believe. It’s perhaps because the narrator realises this that he says that happiness ‘can leave just as quick’. This seems a poor excuse. Even if the happiness might be transitory, that doesn’t mean it will be. It’s hardly a reason for not giving it a go. Furthermore, his later remark that there’s\n\n‘Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ‘em bad enough’\n\nshows he believes that if something is desired strongly enough, it can be achieved.\n\nOverall, it would seem that the narrator has done no more than come up with a poorly reasoned ad hoc excuse for rejecting the woman. And the excuse gets repeated when he says\n\n‘Any minute of the day the bubble could burst’.\n\n3. Duplicity\n\nThe narrator’s injunctions against turning back and coming back, and his comment about happiness leaving, show him, then, to be at best inconsistent and at worst duplicitous. His penchant for deception extends beyond deluding himself, however:\n\n‘Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff\n\nPlenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ‘em bad enough’\n\nThe context is contraband liquor and the tone of the lines makes it clear that for him covert activity is acceptable. He just takes it for granted that one would have things to hide. The idea of hiding things then seems to spark the next comment:\n\n‘I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt’\n\nThe implication is that he’s in a clandestine relationship. However, the colloquial addition of ‘but you know’ seems to imply, once again, that such deception is to be expected.\n\n***\n\nDuplicity is also present in the refrain when he advises the woman\n\n‘You went years without me\n\nYou might as well keep going now’\n\nThe phrase ‘might as well’ in context is absurd. It suggests the options are of equal value – that there’s no real difference for her between coming back and continuing without him. This would seem to fly in the face of the evidence – her attempt to get back with him.\n\nFurthermore, we can take it that what the narrator really has in mind is not so much the woman’s welfare but his own. This seems to be so when in two of the refrain verses the word ‘You’ is omitted so that the second line is shortened to\n\n‘Might as well keep going now’\n\nThe difference is considerable. Suddenly the line seems to be addressed to himself rather than to the woman. He might as well keep going now. In other words he’s using her having gone years without him as an excuse for his not resuming the relationship.\n\n***\n\nThere are two further differences between versions of the refrain\n\nSometimes the first line is\n\n‘Sugar Baby, get on down the road’\n\nAnd sometimes it’s\n\n‘Sugar Baby, get on down the line’\n\nHad either ‘road’ or ‘line’ alone been used throughout, whichever the choice had been wouldn’t have seemed significant; they mean more or less the same thing. However, the use of both suggests that whatever difference in meaning can be found is significant. It might be that ‘road’ is used for its spatial connotations and ‘line’ for its temporal ones. In other words the narrator wants the woman not just at an increasing physical difference from him but for her to go another long period of time without him. It’s a very thorough rejection! 2\n\nThe other difference between occurrences of the refrain is the variation between ‘brain’ and sense’. In the first four occurrences we have\n\n‘You got no brains no how’\n\nHowever, in the fifth and final recurrence this becomes\n\n‘You got no sense no how’\n\nAgain the difference is significant. The earlier accusations cruelly imply the woman has no ability to think while the final one implies she doesn’t even have any intuitive ability. The narrator seems to have moved from criticising her thinking to writing her off altogether.\n\n4, Womanising\n\nOne motive the narrator has for not reviving his relationship with the woman, it would appear, is his desire to womanise. How fixed this desire is is open to question, though. That he’s had, and judging by the present tense is having, relationships with other women is apparent when he complains\n\n‘There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring’\n\nIt’s also hinted at in his reference to the ‘ladies down in Darktown’ and the fact that he’s been passing off the woman he’s been staying with as his aunt.\n\nDespite this, the line might not just be a moan about his partners generally but a sign that he sees the need to give up womanising. If so, it’s plausible it would be in favour of a genuinely loving relationship with the woman, the Sugar Baby of the title.\n\n5. Love\n\nIf the complaint about women bringing trouble were a moan about his partners generally, it might seem inconsistent with the triple claim in the line which immediately follows it:\n\n‘Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing’\n\nThere need be no inconsistency, though, if by ‘love’ he means genuine love’. It might be because he recognises the truth of all three statements, when genuine love is meant, that he’s contemplating giving up licentious love and the ‘trouble’ it brings. The point of making the statements would be to reinforce in his mind the value in giving up the lesser sort of love and perhaps reviving the old relationship.\n\nLove is obviously ‘pleasing’ in a reciprocal way when genuine. Neither is there anything untoward about the claim that genuine love is ‘teasing’ since it’s suggestive of no more than mutually enjoyable playfulness. And that genuine love is ‘not an evil thing’ can go without saying.\n\nThe narrator might still think the statements are true, or be prepared to convince himself that they are, if by ‘love’ he means licentiousness. This would be so if he failed to distinguish the two sorts of love and made honest claims about the one which were really only true of the other. Furthermore, ‘Love is pleasing’ might seem true if it were pleasing to him even if not to the other person.\n\nHe might have less justification for claiming that love is ‘teasing’. In using the word ‘teasing’ it might be that he’s attempting to cover up for inconsiderate behaviour which the women he’s known would not consider mere teasing. Passing off such behaviour as ‘teasing’ would be an attempt to fool himself that the fault for the resulting limitless ‘trouble’ lies elsewhere than with him. Similarly, ‘love’s not an evil thing’ might be said as a defensive response to scathing criticism of his approach to love. It’s difficult to think of any other reason for saying it.\n\n***\n\nWhatever the truth about the view of love the narrator has in mind, it’s ironic that he uses the word when at his most vicious:\n\n‘You got a way of tearing a world apart, love …’\n\nIn this context to call the woman ‘love’ is patronising and devoid of emotion, and it’s in keeping with the way he demeaningly addresses her throughout the song as ‘Sugar Baby’.\n\n6. Incompetence\n\nOne of the narrator’s characteristics is his inability to successfully take control. This comes out in his preferring to blame circumstances rather than himself for his problems:\n\n‘Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick’\n\nRather than taking control of circumstances, in this case working to secure his and the woman’s long term happiness, he’d rather make excuses or blame non-existent dirty tricks.\n\nHis incompetence also becomes apparent in his failure to distinguish between what can be known and what can’t. About the Aunt Sally he’s staying with he says\n\n‘… but you know she’s not really my aunt’\n\nEven if he’s trying to gently let the woman know he’s in another relationship, it seems cack-handed to say ‘you know she’s not really my aunt’; it must be highly unlikely that the woman could know that.\n\nA little later he makes another inappropriate comment concerning knowledge. This time it’s not about what ‘you know’ but what ‘you never know’:\n\n‘You always got to be prepared but you never know for what’\n\nNot only is this obviously untrue in that people usually know what they’re prepared for, but it’s absurd to think one can be prepared without ever knowing what it’s for.\n\nHis incompetence becomes even more apparent when we consider the two claims together, for he’s claiming there’s knowledge where there isn’t and no knowledge where there has to be knowledge.\n\n7. Rhetorical Language\n\nThroughout the song the narrator either consciously or unconsciously takes advantage of ways in which language can distort the truth. His rhetorical use of language has a number of direct effects. These include creating the illusion that he knows some things for certain, giving an unduly favourable impression of himself, providing apparent support for his moral condemnation of the woman, and facilitating his vindictiveness. I’ll take each of these in turn.\n\na) Creating an illusion of certainty\n\nIn the first verse the narrator’s confidence that he knows things for certain may well arise from a rhetorical exploitation of the opposites ‘can’ and ‘can’t’ in adjoining lines. When\n\n‘I can see …’\n\nis followed by\n\n‘You can’t turn back …’,\n\nthe vastness of the distance between ‘can’ and ‘can’t’ gives the impression there can have been no mistaking either for something lesser. ‘I can see’ comes across as ‘There’s no doubt I can see …’ and ‘You can’t turn back …’ as ‘You definitely can’t turn back …’\n\nThat illusion of certainty is reinforced by the repetition of ‘can’t’ in\n\n‘You can’t turn back – you can’t come back …’\n\nwhich creates the staccato sound of a nail being hammered.\n\nIt’s also supported by the narrator’s apparent exploitation of an ambiguity in the word ‘we’ in\n\n‘… sometimes we push too far’\n\nOn the surface ‘we’ here can be taken as referring to people generally so that he appears to be making the unimpeachable comment that sometimes people, considered generally, push too far. However, it’s likely that he’s also intending ‘we’ to be taken as referring to the woman and himself. In that case he may well be being dishonest since, as mentioned earlier, he’s provided no reason for us to suppose he has been pushing too far to get the relationship going again, even if the woman has. In short, he’s able to exploit the certainty resulting from the wider use of ‘we’ as camouflage for the lack of certainty where the reference is narrow.\n\nb) Self-deception\n\nThere’s no doubt that the narrator deceives himself. This occurs when on numerous occasions he qualifies what he’s saying with, for example, expressions like ‘some’ or ‘pretty’ – as in:\n\n‘Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff’\n\nWhile couched in the language of praise, reading between the lines this seems to be saying that even where a few bootleggers do make good stuff, it’s still not that good. Presumably the narrator isn’t more open in his condemnation of the mediocre because having bought it, to be so would reflect badly on his judgment.\n\nThe qualification ‘some’ occurs twice more in the same verse:\n\n‘Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t’\n\nAlthough he doesn’t want to put it explicitly, he means that he has bad memories. The opposites ‘can’ and ’can’t’ seem intended to give the impression that there’s a balance between good and bad memories whereas the truth is that all his memories are bad. They’re very bad if he can’t learn to live with them. And they’re still bad if he has to learn to live with them. The illusion of balance, however, is further reinforced by the double use of ‘some’ to give the erroneous impression that there’s an equal division between good and bad.\n\nA further example of self-deception is present where he says:\n\n‘Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a\n\nthousand times worse’\n\nNot only does the rhetorical opposition between ‘better’ and ‘worse’ create the illusion that what’s being said after the comma logically follows from what comes before it, but so does the shared syllable ‘some’ in ‘someone’ and ‘sometimes’.\n\nAnd while for ‘someone, sometimes’, the overall claim is probably true, we might say ‘so what?’ For a start ‘someone’ and ‘sometimes’ are so vague that what’s being claimed could never be disproved. In any case what also deserves attention is the fact that attempts to make things better generally do pay off. The narrator is clearly fooling himself if he thinks otherwise.\n\nIn verse three a similar effect to the opposition between ‘better’ and ‘worse’ is achieved by the use of ‘good’ and its opposite ‘bad’:\n\n‘Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff\n\nPlenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ‘em bad enough’\n\nThe effect is to make the truth of the second line somehow follow from the (supposed) truth of the first. It doesn’t. The claims are irrelevant to one another.\n\nOpposites are again in evidence in verse seven:\n\n‘Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick’\n\nWhile ‘can come’, with its short, sharp sound is assertive, the force is immediately negated by its opposite ‘(can) leave’. The impression of negation is also achieved by the way the long vowel sound of ‘leave’ contrasts with the short, sharp sound of ‘can come’.\n\nc) Gratuitous condemnation\n\nPerhaps because he feels bereft of reasons which could convince the woman that the relationship shouldn’t be revived, the narrator sets about condemning both her intelligence and her morals. The refrain provides an instance of the former when he says\n\n‘You got no brains [or ‘sense’] no how’\n\nThe ‘no how’ at the end of the line adds little to the meaning but the repetition of ‘no’ and the way in which the two syllable structure of ‘no how’ matches that of ‘no brains’ both serve to seemingly establish that she really does have no brains.\n\nAlso as a way of attacking her morals the narrator uses language featuring the words ‘up’ or ‘down’, and often both. That he should morally condemn her is ironic given his own moral shortcomings – womanising and dealing with bootleggers.\n\nThe first occasion he uses ‘up’ is when he’s chiding the woman, or possibly himself, for being unrealistic:\n\n‘One day you’ll open up your eyes …’\n\nThe word ‘up’ would be redundant if it weren’t intended to imply that the woman is, metaphorically, looking down. He presumably means towards hell since later he exhorts her to\n\n‘Look up, look up …’\n\nto heaven, thereby implying in each case that her moral outlook is contaminated by the world.\n\nIt might seem inconsistent for the narrator, then, to associate ‘up’ with failure when announcing:\n\n‘Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a\n\nthousand times worse’\n\nWhile he’s presumably attempting to justify his view that reviving the relationship will make neither of them better off, the advice is obviously self-serving. Ironically the word ‘up’ seems to point out what is surely the case – that it would be better, not worse, if people tried to help one another.\n\nGiven that the narrator associates ‘up’ with moral approval, it’s an indication of his lack of concern for the woman’s wellbeing that in the refrain he exhorts her to\n\n‘… get on down the road [or line]’.\n\nBy not helping her, there can be no doubt about the sort of life he’s condemning her to when we recall that the ‘Darktown ladies’ are\n\n‘… down in Darktown …’\n\nHe doesn’t care if by refusing to get back with her he’s forcing her into a life of prostitution.\n\nd) Vindictiveness\n\nThe narrator is vindictive and in the process again employs rhetorical language:\n\n‘Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one\n\nYou got a way of tearing a world apart, love, see what you done’\n\nHe is, for no obvious good reason, blaming the woman for the earlier failure of the relationship. A number of things are significant.\n\nFirst is the deceptive nature of his wording. The lines imply she has a record of destroying relationships and therefore that he’d be a fool to revive theirs. But what exactly has she done wrong? So what if her charms ‘have broken many a heart’? That’s testament to her attractiveness but it in no way justifies the implication that she’s betrayed numerous former lovers.\n\nSecondly, the viciousness of the accusation,\n\n‘You got a way of tearing a world apart, love, see what you done …’\n\nseems particularly unwarranted given that the woman is attempting to restore the relationship. He should be grateful, one would have thought, that a woman with her ‘charms’ is able to forgive him his faults and come back to him. Furthermore, ‘tearing the world apart’ is an emotive piece of rhetorical exaggeration presumably designed to make her feel bad.\n\nThe accusation seems particularly self-serving since by ‘a world’ it would seem to be his world he has in mind. This is because he’s just complained that among the hearts she’s broken his\n\n‘… is surely one’.\n\nIf so, he gets his comeuppance since in saying she tears his world apart, he makes himself seem pathetic as if he can’t look after himself.\n\nThirdly, the presence of ‘surely‘ in the above phrase helps reinforce the vindictiveness. Why, we might ask, is his heart surely one that’s been broken? ‘Surely’ is a word people often use in an attempt to persuade when they’re doubtful themselves. It’s redundant where there’s certainty. If what the narrator’s saying were true, all he need have said is ‘and mine is one’. The rhetorical addition of ‘surely’ suggests that the narrator is consciously making an unwarranted assumption.\n\nDespite this it remains plausible that the woman is responsible for having destroyed the relationship. The point is simply that instead of justifying the view he resorts to using rhetorical language.\n\n8. Attitude to guilt.\n\nThe narrator might come across not just as vicious but as hypocritical in criticising the woman for having ‘no brains’. This is because, as he admits, he ‘can learn to live with’ only some of his memories. In other words, he’s incapable of learning to live with them all. However, we might also take the admission to be one of contrition for he’s implicitly admitting guilt in admitting he has bad memories.\n\nIf he is admitting to a guilty past, it doesn’t last for long. In the penultimate verse we find him positive about life, despite an apparent inconsistency with his earlier bitter comment about existence being a ‘dirty trick’.\n\n‘Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born\n\nLook up, look up – seek your Maker …’\n\nHere the phrase ‘Just as sure as we’re living’ shows him being exultant that both he and the woman are living – and, from what follows, by ‘living’ he seems to mean living morally.\n\nHe then – without getting round to finishing what he was going to say – takes it back with respect to her by substituting ‘you’re born’ for ‘we’re living’. She isn’t living morally; the only certainty for her is the lesser one of having been ‘born’. That he doesn’t take back the comment about living with respect to himself implies he’s happy to continue to believe that he is ‘living’ – again in what the context implies to be a moral sense.\n\nThat he uses ‘living’ rather than some other expression is important since it reminds us that he has memories he can’t\n\n‘… learn to live with’\n\n– moral failings which he says no more about. Thus, by condemning the woman’s failings without acknowledging his own, he’s presenting himself as a hypocrite.\n\nConclusion\n\nA major achievement of the song is the way in which it presents a picture of how people think. The language is compressed throughout so that there’s hardly a line that doesn’t carry much more than its surface meaning. The way words and phrases are interrelated so as to create additional meaning is masterful. A major feature is the narrator’s reliance on rhetorical language as a substitute for the provision of detailed examples or clear argument. Devices such as repetition, the presenting of opposites in close proximity, and the use of words with contrasting sounds are typical.\n\nVarious negative features of the narrator’s character, including duplicity, inconsistency, incompetence and overconfidence in his own ability, are betrayed in his speech. He makes excuses and attempts to avoid taking responsibility for his problems – the latter exemplified by his characterising existence as ‘some dirty trick’ and his complaining about ‘the amount of trouble women bring’. The misogyny apparent here is evident also in the viciously cruel way he criticises his former lover. His criticising her while failing to condemn his own faults brings out the hypocrisy in him.\n\nOn the whole the narrator comes across badly. Nevertheless a feature of the song is its reliance on ambiguity. While for most of the song, and particularly at the end, he seems committed to rejecting his former lover, there are times when he could equally be interpreted as contemplating reviving the relationship. Likewise, while his behaviour seems reprehensible, what he says about the memories he can’t live with suggests he might be experiencing guilt.\n\nNotes:\n\nIt’s possible that the sun image used to represent knowledge is taken from Plato (Republic 507b–509c),\n\nIt’s also possible that ‘the line’ should remind us of Plato’s line simile which he uses to represent our ascent through four different stages of knowledge (Republic 509d–510a). On this account, in telling the woman to ‘get on down the line’ the narrator would be inadvertently advocating she regress!\n\nIntroduction\n\nA quite amazing song. It’s got so much in it. It’s extraordinary for its insight into human nature and the depth to which it presents a hugely, and realistically, complex character.\n\nInitially the song seems to give us one side of a conversation between the narrator and a woman he resents for rejecting him. However, since some parts would sound unnatural in a conversation, it more likely presents the narrator’s thoughts about his situation and what might transpire.1 What he ‘says’ will be as if said to the woman but actually kept to himself. This is important for two reasons. First, it has consequences for how we might judge him; he might decide not to carry out some of the nasty things he’s contemplating. Secondly, it means that some of the events which seem to have taken place the narrator might just be imagining as having taken place. In order not to over-complicate matters, I’ll assume that the narrator is thinking about a visit he’s actually made to Goldsmith, the woman has reacted as he says, and that he has heard a disturbance the previous night.\n\nBelieving he’s been betrayed by the woman, and not just the woman, the narrator makes vain attempts to build himself up in her eyes. He’s miserable throughout and doesn’t cease to be bitter. On two occasions he makes sinister threats. Although he comes across as a seriously inadequate character in numerous ways, we’re also made aware that some of his faults can at root be attributed to a mental state which may or may not be beyond his control.\n\nThis piece is divided up into twelve sections before a conclusion:\n\n1. Goldsmith and Pasqualli\n\n2. Mafia connections\n\n3. Jumping to conclusions\n\n4. Mood swings, delusion and the ‘fighting rooster’\n\n5. Dishonesty\n\n6. Inconsistency\n\n7. Attempts to impress\n\n8. Threats of revenge\n\n9. Vagueness\n\n10. Viciousness\n\n11. Fecklessness\n\n12. False religiosity\n\n1. Goldsmith and Pasqualli\n\nWe’re given no detailed information about the visit to a ‘Mr Goldsmith’, referred to in the first verse, beyond the narrator’s claim that the visit was for the sake of a woman he claims has broken his heart. The visit, we’ll assume, has taken place and the narrator believes, quite possibly falsely, that Goldsmith has reneged on a deal made with the narrator. This causes him to brand Goldsmith as\n\n‘A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with’2\n\nThe deal, it’s later implied, was for Goldsmith to ensure that a certain Don Pasqualli pays the woman no more nocturnal visits.3 The narrator’s justification for believing Goldsmith to have reneged on the deal is that:\n\n‘Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls’\n\nIt must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two a.m. booty call’.\n\nThat he immediately jumps to the conclusion that the woman was with Pasqualli becomes apparent from his scathing contempt for her:\n\n‘To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style’\n\nHis belief that there’s a connection between Pasqualli’s behaviour and Goldsmith’s having reneged on the deal becomes apparent through his sub-conscious use of the syllable ‘cross’. He describes Goldsmith as\n\n‘… double-crossin’…’\n\nand Pasqualli ‘pounding’\n\n‘… ‘cross the alley …’\n\nIt’s ironic that he should use a syllable with such obvious religious connotations in connection with people he despises but who could in fact be behaving quite honourably.\n\n2. Mafia connections\n\nA number of things indicate that all three men, Goldsmith, Pasqualli and the narrator, have Mafia connections.\n\nIn Goldsmith’s case it’s suggested by the narrator’s describing him as a\n\n‘… nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony …’,\n\nand even more so by the narrator’s going to Goldsmith to get a deal involving the woman. The narrator clearly thinks that Goldsmith has influence with Pasqualli.\n\nPasqualli’s Italian-sounding (albeit Spanish) name and dubious nocturnal activity suggest that he too is a member of the Mafia. So does the prefix ‘Don’ which is often ascribed to senior Mafiosi.\n\nThe same applies to the narrator because of his knowledge of each. He’s already aware of Goldsmith’s character and power. And he knows Pasqualli well enough to attribute the nocturnal disturbance to him:\n\n‘It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two a.m. booty call’\n\nA further reason for thinking the narrator is involved with the Mafia is his own propensity to make violent threats. These will be considered below. It might also be what he means when he makes the obscure comment that he’s a ‘union man’.\n\n3. Jumping to conclusions\n\nDespite their Mafia membership it’s likely that the narrator is just jumping to conclusions about Goldsmith’s character and Pasqualli’s night-time activity. He provides no justification for believing that the nocturnal disturbance\n\n‘… must have been Don Pasqualle making a two a.m. booty call’\n\nIt may well be that jealousy is causing the narrator to assume what is in fact not the case.\n\nA further instance of the narrator’s jumping to conclusions concerns his description of the woman’s reaction when she hears about his visit to Goldsmith:\n\n‘… all you gave me was a smile’\n\nHe assumes the smile is given in appreciation for his having made a deal with Goldsmith. It doesn’t occur to him that it might be, say, a wry smile occasioned by her seeing the absurdity of his behaviour. He should have realised that the smile would hardly have been appreciative if she had in fact betrayed him by seeing Pasqualli.\n\nThe narrator can also be said to be jumping to conclusions when he miserably declares:\n\n‘Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul’\n\nThe declaration is probably occasioned by his belief that Goldsmith has reneged on the deal, that Pasqualli was responsible for the night-time disturbance, and that the woman was involved with Pasqualli.4 But he has no good reason for believing any of these things.\n\nIn the light of this it’s ironic that he refers to his ‘trusting heart’. He has ended up not trusting anyone.\n\n4. Mood swings, delusion and the ‘fighting rooster’\n\nIt may be possible to account for the narrator’s propensity to jump to conclusions about Goldsmith, Pasqualli and the woman beyond just attributing it to jealousy. This propensity, together with his being subject to mood swings, might be caused by drug use. That the narrator uses drugs can be assumed from the use of a line from the song Dope Head Blues:\n\n‘Feel like a fighting rooster – feel better than I ever felt’,5\n\nIn that song, as here, drugs give a false sense of well-being. The fight he’s envisaging would be to win the woman.\n\nHaving stated how he feels, the narrator immediately makes what might appear to be an irrelevant and perhaps delusory comment:\n\n‘But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt’\n\nSuch a comment might well be dismissed as being the result of drug induced euphoria . There could, however, be two reasons for taking the comment as rational. First, ‘line’ and ‘road’ in Dylan’s songs are often used as a spatial way of referring to the temporal. For example, ‘while I was down the line’, in Thunder on the Mountain, can be taken as meaning ‘at a time when I’d already lived a good portion of my life’. Accordingly, in the present song the above quotation might be taken as meaning that the narrator can’t see how he’s going to go about successfully fulfilling the role of ‘fighting rooster’.\n\nSecondly, the narrator could just be making an excuse for not carrying out a threat to leave the woman. It might be such a threat that he’s alluding to in the final verse;\n\n‘I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day’\n\nOn both these interpretations the narrator would be being unduly pessimistic given that ‘about to melt’ implies that the road has not yet melted and so remains passable. On the first interpretation, it’s clear that it’s too early for him to assume that there’d be no point in fighting. And on the second it would be clear that despite making a threat, he’d have no intention of carrying it out.\n\nA further inconsistency arises from the claim about feeling better than he ever felt. this arises from his apparently admitting to being in a state of severe depression, presumably over the woman’s rejection of him:\n\n‘I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control’\n\nOnce again it would appear that he’s swung from one mood to its polar opposite. And again, a possible cause of the mood swing would be drugs.\n\nThe euphoric claim about feeling better than he ever felt is also in direct conflict with the bitterness towards the woman which permeates the whole song and his stated desire to end his life. In each case there appears to have been a swing from one extremity of mood to its opposite.\n\n5. Dishonesty\n\nThe narrator is dishonest. His dishonesty appears to be independent of any propensity towards having mood swings or any other mental disturbance.\n\nThe song opens with what looks like an excuse for not being with the woman when she was expecting him:\n\n‘Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr Goldsmith’\n\nThe words ‘had to’ imply he had no option. ‘Chose to’ would have been more accurate.\n\nTwo lines later there’s what is almost certainly an outright lie:\n\n‘But I did it for you …’\n\nThis is not only inconsistent with the claim that he ‘had to’ do it but the fact that in response he expects more than ‘a smile’ from the woman suggests that he’s motivated by self interest rather than to benefit her. That he’s self-interested is also corroborated by the way he expresses his desire to drink himself to death:\n\n‘I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey’\n\nThe ‘me‘ is superfluous but clearly uppermost in his mind.\n\nA further instance of dishonesty concerns the phrase\n\n‘… now it’s your turn to cry awhile’\n\nWhile it might be said that the narrator only expects the woman to cry ‘awhile’, i.e. for a short period , the phrase ‘now it’s your turn’ implies that the narrator himself has only been crying ‘awhile’. This would suggest that he’s been exaggerating his misery, or at least its manifestation, in order to manipulate the woman into acceding to his wishes.\n\n6. Inconsistency\n\nIn addition to being downright dishonest, the narrator is guilty of more inconsistencies than those considered so far.\n\nThere’s an obvious inconsistency when the narrator describes Goldsmith as a\n\n‘… nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with’\n\nIt’s noticeable that the angry tone of the line is in conflict with the more relaxed tone of the opening one in which there’s no hint of criticism. There Goldsmith is referred to as ‘a guy’, a term at worst neutral and perhaps even implying approval.\n\nAlso, the fact that he’s given a title – ‘Mr Goldsmith’ – implies respect on the part of the narrator. Clearly the character assassination in the second line is in conflict with the attempt to be affable and deferential in the first.\n\nFinally, the narrator demonstrates ironic inconsistency in being so prepared to condemn Goldsmith for being a phony when his own interest in the woman is obviously just carnal. He shows no concern for her – doesn’t even use her name – beyond saying\n\n‘I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs’\n\nas if she’s no more than a meal.\n\n7. Attempts to impress\n\nBelieving that he’s failed to get Goldsmith’s support and thinking that the woman is rebuffing him, the narrator tries to build himself up in his own eyes and hers.\n\nWe see this in the informal way he refers to ‘a guy named Mr Goldsmith’. He seems to be making out that he and Goldsmith are more or less equals. Furthermore, in using the title – Mr Goldsmith – he implies that he’s the equal of somebody who deserves respect.\n\nIn order to make his having visited Goldsmith seem even more impressive, he implies it’s something he should have kept secret. He’s\n\n‘… lettin’ the cat out of the cage …’\n\nIn other words he’s informed the woman that he’s a member of the Mafia. In case that isn’t impressive enough, he adds that he’s\n\n‘… keeping a low profile’,\n\nthereby giving himself a romantic persona.\n\nThe narrator also attempts to impress by being brashly self-assertive:\n\n‘I don’t carry dead weight – I’m no flash in the pan’\n\nThis is partly to present himself positively but it’s also sinister. It seems to be a veiled threat – that the woman could literally become a ‘dead weight’. He’s implying that if she doesn’t commit herself to what he wants, he’ll dispose of her. He’s not just someone to be treated as a passing fancy.\n\nFinally, his claim in the final verse:\n\n‘I always said you’d be sorry …’\n\ncan be seen as an attempt to build himself up by implying that he’s a better judge than the woman.\n\n8. Threats of revenge\n\nThere are more threats. In the final verse there’s:\n\n‘I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day’\n\nThe narrator is being disingenuous since, apart from its being pompous, the first clause softens the effect of the second. It seems to imply that the narrator is merely predicting what is going to happen over a period of time; being sorry is of its nature not something confined to a single day. By saying ‘today could be the day’, though, he’s implying the opposite – that something catastrophic might suddenly happen. The next line, beginning\n\n‘I might need a good lawyer …’,\n\nimplies that what he’s hinting at would be illegal and that the narrator himself would be the perpetrator. The lawyer would need to be ‘good’ to ensure his guilt was not exposed. The hoped for effect is presumably to give the impression that he has nothing to fear from committing a serious crime.\n\nThe line continues with a clear hint that the crime would be murder:\n\n‘… could be your funeral, my trial’.7\n\nIf ‘trial’ is taken metaphorically, then ‘your funeral’ can be taken literally. He’d be threatening to kill the woman.\n\nOn the other hand, if ‘trial’ is taken literally, ‘your funeral’ can be metaphorical. There’d still be a threat – but a lesser one. The threat would be that if the woman forces him into committing a crime, the resulting trial will be disastrous for her.\n\nHow it will be disastrous he doesn’t say. Nor does he say what the crime would be. It might be that the narrator himself doesn’t know. How seriously the threats should be taken is also unclear; for all we know his aim might be just to unsettle the woman with threats.\n\n9. Vagueness\n\nThe vagueness which characterises the nature of the crime and its consequences for the woman is in part the result of the narrator’s using the word ‘could’ in\n\n‘… today could be the day’\n\nand\n\n‘… could be your funeral …’\n\nUnfortunately the effect is to make it seem as if he’s indecisive about what he’s going to do and what the consequences will be. One feels that such emasculated threats are unlikely to have much effect on the woman.\n\nThere are other ways in which the narrator’s vagueness makes him seem indecisive. He only says he\n\n‘…might need a good lawyer\n\n– so that it becomes unclear whether he’s intending to carry out his threat. And his cutting remark that the woman\n\n‘… bet on a horse and it ran the wrong way’,\n\nthus implying that she miscalculated, gives no indication about what that miscalculation is supposed to have been. We can only guess that he means the woman has misjudged him by wrongly assuming that he’d accept her continuing to see Pasqualli.\n\nThere’s a further vagueness about what the narrator means when he says he’s a ‘union man’.\n\n10. Viciousness\n\nIn addition to being threatening, the narrator is downright vicious in other ways. Or at least his thoughts are. Just as it’s possible he wouldn’t carry out the implied threats, so we can’t be sure he would actually say the nasty things he’s contemplating saying. When judging him, it’s important to remember that the song comprises his thoughts, not what he actually says.\n\nProvided we keep the above reservation in mind, we can condemn the narrator as vicious. His depiction of Goldsmith puts him in this category. Likewise the refrain’s repeated:\n\n‘… now it’s your turn to cry awhile’\n\nand even more so the variation:\n\n‘… now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile’\n\nNot only do the words seem cruel but the emphasis afforded by the several repetitions makes him seem to relish the cruelty.\n\nThe complaint:\n\n‘To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style’\n\nis doubly vicious. First, there’s the viciousness in mentally accusing the woman of breaking his ‘trusting’ heart. Then this is compounded by the exaggeration which follows. Not only is he criticising the woman for abandoning his trust but he’s implying that such behaviour is normal for her. He provides no justification for this. On the contrary, the word ‘style’ reminds us, by way of the rhyme, that the only other behaviour attributed to the woman is her having given him ‘a smile’. Accordingly, if we can know anything about her it’s that her ‘style’ is to be good natured.\n\nHaving praised his own heart as ‘trusting’, the narrator again seems vicious when he contrasts this with the woman’s, and perhaps his rival’s, supposed lack of a heart:\n\n‘Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul’\n\nIf he’s implying that in rejecting him the woman is heartless, and perhaps inhuman, once again her smile would suggest otherwise. And if he has Goldsmith or Pasqualli in mind, then for all we know he has misjudged them. Goldsmith might not have reneged on the deal and Pasqualli might not have been visiting the woman.\n\nThere’s more viciousness, first when the narrator imagines patronising the woman –\n\n‘All right, I’ll set you straight …’\n\n– and then when he immediately follows up with a sarcastic put down:\n\n‘… can’t you see I’m a union man?’\n\nHe’s patronising again when he indulges in the self promoting:\n\n‘I always said you’d be sorry …’\n\nAnd his telling the woman that she:\n\n‘… bet on a horse and it ran the wrong way’\n\nis downright smug.\n\n11. Fecklessness\n\nIf the horse is intended to stand for the narrator, the claim that it ran the wrong way hardly puts the narrator in a good light. If anything it would seem like an unintentional admission of incompetence.\n\nThere are other ways too in which the narrator comes across as rather pathetic. To get the woman’s sympathy, it would seem, he says he’ll\n\n‘… buy me a barrel of whiskey – I’ll die before I turn senile’\n\nHis avowed intention is to drink himself to death if she won’t accede to his demands. Why, one wonders, doesn’t he just say he’ll kill himself? It looks as if he’s exploiting his resentment as an excuse for drinking to excess. It may even be that the thought of drink was put into his mind not as a way out of his misery but by food, for in the immediately preceding line he’d said he wanted the woman for\n\n‘… the sweet fat that sticks to your ribs’.\n\nImplicitly admitting to a fear of senility is hardly impressive, either. Furthermore, it’s unlikely to improve his standing in the woman’s eyes since a concern about senility would imply he’s worried about his advancing years.\n\nFor most of the song the narrator comes across as a wimp – a cry baby. Constantly he tells the woman:\n\n‘I cried for you …’,\n\npresumably in response to her refusal to commit herself to him.\n\nAnd in what one imagines is desperation, he resorts to more crying:\n\n‘I’m crying to the Lord’\n\nHe also admits to\n\n‘… fighting back tears that I can’t control’\n\nCan’t control? If all this is a dire consequence of drug taking, one wonders to what extent the tears are really beyond his control. It seems plausible that he could stop taking drugs.\n\nHis attempt to elicit sympathy by saying he’s\n\n‘… on the fringes of the night …’\n\nalso makes him seem pathetic. Also, the reference to night here makes us want to contrast his own indecisive behaviour with Don Pasqualli’s much more decisive night-time ‘pounding on the walls’.\n\nFurthermore, since the very name ‘Don Pasqualli’ reminds us of Byron’s licentious hero Don Juan, a huge success with women, we can understand why the woman might be reticent about agreeing to a relationship with someone as feckless as the narrator.8\n\n12. False religiosity\n\nPart of the narrator’s strategy for winning over the woman seems to be to impress her with his religious conviction. Alternatively he may just be trying to convince himself of his moral worthiness. Either way he declares that he’s\n\n‘… cryin to the Lord’\n\nand\n\n‘… tryin’ to be meek and mild’\n\n– thereby, by implication, following the Lord’s’ example. There’s a double irony here. First, the narrator himself is nowhere near being meek and mild in the relevant sense. He’s vengeful and, as has been shown, downright vicious. Secondly, if being ‘meek and mild’ is taken to mean crying – either for the woman or ‘to the Lord’ – then he’s trying too hard. He’s excessively meek and mild.\n\n***\n\nOther attempts to support his religious credentials include the claims:\n\n‘I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile’ 9\n\nThe latter clause about going the extra mile seems to be a straightforward boast. The phrase ‘every day’ is intended to give an impression of religious commitment but also seems designed to obscure the significance of the clause which precedes it. The implication there is that, while he went to the church house, he did so only once. That in turn suggests that his religious credentials are something of a sham.\n\nAlso, it’s ironic that in a literal sense it’s obviously untrue that he goes the extra mile. As noted above, when maybe threatening to leave the woman he immediately makes an excuse for not going any mile:\n\n‘But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt’\n\nWe can assume from this that he’s unlikely to go the extra mile in the metaphorical religious sense either.\n\nWhat he does instead is to pretend. He pretends his seeing Goldsmith was for the sake of the woman:\n\n‘I did it for you’\n\nIf he’d really made a sacrifice for her, he would have been going the extra mile. He‘d not expect any reward. The smile she gave him would have been more than enough. As it is, he complains it was too little.\n\nThe narrator’s remark that:\n\n‘… there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs’\n\nseems like a further attempt to enhance his religious credentials. He says nothing about the content of the preaching or the significance of the nativity scenes. Were his concern to win over the woman genuine, one might have expected the reference to babies to be made in the context of starting a family. Instead he follows up with a crude remark about her body – ‘the sweet fat that sticks to your ribs’.\n\nIt’s also odd that ‘preachers’, ‘pulpits’, ‘babies’, and ‘cribs’ are all in the plural since he can’t have discovered this by going to the one ‘church house’ on just the one occasion. Whatever his point is in making the observation, it can’t be used as evidence for any religious commitment.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Goldsmith and Pasqualli, and even the narrator, probably have Mafia connections, none of this is certain. What matters is that the narrator believes a deal he has struck with Goldsmith regarding the woman has been reneged on – and that, partially as a result, the woman has betrayed him with Pasqualli.\n\nThe main focus of the song is the character and motivation of the narrator. While superficially the narrator seems to be addressing the woman he’s trying to win over, it’s more likely the song represents what he’s contemplating saying together with other more general thoughts about his situation.\n\nWhat comes across is that the narrator is a hugely complex character. Among his faults are fecklessness, dishonesty, inconsistency, viciousness, a tendency to jump to conclusions, and a willingness to threaten death as a means of coercion. Unable to see why the woman is rejecting him, he hopes to build himself up in her eyes by making unsubstantiated claims about himself and adopting a false religiosity. He claims he’s got her interests at heart while really his focus is on himself.\n\nDespite all these faults, it might be possible to avoid condemning him. His tendency to jump to conclusions is perhaps the result of jealousy. More obviously he seems to suffer from mood swings causing him, for example, to suddenly feel ‘like a fighting rooster’ and then just as suddenly return to ‘fighting back tears that [he] can’t control’. What we don’t know is the extent to which his misery is actually outside his control. Neither can we be sure that he has any serious intention of being vicious and there are reasons to suppose he has no intention of carrying out his threats.\n\nNotes\n\nWhile lines with ‘you’ in them, for example, would sound natural addressed to the woman, others would sound unnatural. An example would be the first line ‘Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr Goldsmith’. The reference to the woman’s response, a smile, shows that she already knew he’d made the visit and therefore there would be no point in saying it to her. Accordingly the first line would be better seen as loosely based on a previous conversation which the narrator is now going over in his mind.\n\nThe sung version of the line ends ‘I didn’t have to wanna have to be dealin’ with’. That implies that the narrator did want to be dealing with Goldsmith, thus corroborating the view that the visit was largely paid for his own benefit, not the woman’s.\n\nIt’s unlikely that either name refers to a real person or one drawn from fiction. Pasqualli, for example, bears little relation to any character in Donizetti’s opera ‘Don Pasquali’\n\nSince the name ‘Goldsmith’ is a common Jewish name, it’s unlikely that Dylan would use it for someone who fitted the description given by the narrator in the second line. First, to do so would be horribly racist. Secondly, Dylan’s own Jewish heritage would make it unlikely. Accordingly, for that reason alone, it’s likely that the narrator is misrepresenting Goldsmith.\n\nI’m indebted to Tony Attwood’s article in Untold Dylan for pointing out that the line is taken from the 1927 Victoria Spivey and Lonnie Johnson song Dope Head Blues.\n\nIt’s not clear in what sense the narrator is claiming he’s a union man. He may just be using the phrase in order to sound impressive. Since ‘Union Man’ is the title of a 1980 Neil Young song in which participating in a union is made to sound a pointless waste of time, it’s possible that the phrase has been chosen by Dylan as a way of subtly criticising the narrator.\n\nThe phrase ‘Your funeral, my trial’ is taken from a 1958 Sonny Boy Williamson song of that title.\n\nIn terms of Chaucer’s The Miller’s Tale the narrator might remind one of Absalon while Don Pasqualli is Nicholas.\n\nThat the narrator says ‘an extra mile’ rather than ‘the extra mile’ also suggests he’s less familiar with the relevant religious source than he’s making out.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe song is a mixture of darkness and humour. It’s largely concerned with the memories of the narrator triggered by a salesman knocking at the door. As a result we learn about the narrator’s wealthy background, his own impoverishment and his present relatively well-off existence. We discover, too, that he’s a criminal, probably a murderer, and that he’s almost certainly guilty of sexual assault. The song covers his anxiety, his attitude to social class, his work, and the part played in his life by marital and family relationships. The bleak atmosphere is relieved by the inclusion of three jokes.\n\nAs often is the case with Dylan, the song incorporates phrases from elsewhere – other songs, jokes and the novel “Confessions of a Yakuza” by Junichi Saga.1 Curiously too the song is permeated with wording from the rhyme ‘One, two, buckle my shoe’.2 While it may be that sources of the interpolated phrases are of little relevance, those from Saga imply that the narrator has a criminal background. This will be considered further below.\n\nMemory\n\nThe title ‘Po’ Boy’ implies the song is about just one travelling salesman. In fact it would seem there are up to four. There’s the narrator’s father, who is described as ‘a traveling salesman’, the visiting salesman who features in the first verse and a second one (probably) who features in the last verse. And finally there’s the narrator himself.\n\nWhat seems to happen is that the arrival of the salesman in the first verse causes the narrator to remember his own earlier life in the same job. This is indicated in the narrator’s question:\n\n‘Poor boy, where you been?’3\n\nSince the lack of quotation marks in the printed version of the song implies the question is unspoken, the question is more likely to be a thought directed towards the narrator himself than one directed at the visitor. The narrator is implying it’s a long time since he himself had to go from door to door scraping a living. The curt, but unspoken, response:\n\n‘I already tol’ you – won’t tell you again’\n\nmight be the sort of youthful response he’d have given to questioners in the past though it might also reflect his current irritation at being asked where his wife is.\n\nThere’s a similar ambiguity about the comforting:\n\n‘Things will be all right by and by’.\n\nThis could be both solace offered by the narrator to himself in more impoverished salesman days but at the same time a sympathetic thought directed towards the salesman at the door. Reasons in support of the former will be given below.\n\nThe narrator goes on to say, apparently prompted by the earlier question ‘Where you been?’\n\n‘Been working on the mainline …’\n\nWhile ‘mainline‘ might suggest both drug running and – more literally – work on the railways, it seems to trigger another memory from an impoverished life as a travelling salesman:\n\n‘Ridin’ first class trains – making the rounds\n\nTryin’ to keep from fallin’ between the cars’\n\nMuch of the rest of the song involves memories of that past life too. These include his time in Georgia and Florida, a cheap hotel, his family background, his gratitude to his uncle, a relationship and an ambition to own a house.\n\nFear and Wife’s Absence\n\nThe narrator is scared. This is apparent from the very first line in which he asks a salesman:\n\n‘”For whom are you looking?”’\n\nHe’s putting on an act. The language – in particular the formal ‘For whom’ – is unnatural and would be particularly so for someone ‘working on the mainline’ if this is taken to mean he’s a navvy. Although he might just be attempting to emulate the style of the social class he wants to be associated with, it could equally be that he’s concerned to hide his true identity.\n\nThe salesman wants to speak with the narrator’s wife and once again the narrator behaves suspiciously:\n\n‘”She’s busy in the kitchen cookin”’\n\nWhy doesn’t he fetch his wife? And if it really is inconvenient, why doesn’t he apologise before explaining? While it’s plausible that he’s telling the truth, it would seem that he’s covering something up.\n\nDespite that, the narrator is prepared to pay more than the salesman’s asking price of three dollars:\n\n‘Will you take four?’\n\nOnce again, however, the language register is suspiciously unnatural.\n\n***\n\nIn the final verse the narrator is again the one who answers the knock at the door. Still there’s no evidence of a wife. And again he seems worried:\n\n‘Who is it and where are you from?’\n\nThe questioning seems out of place. The narrator has no obvious need to know the answers to either question. The salesman’s jokey response:\n\n‘”Freddy or not here I come”’\n\nwill likely have worried the narrator even more. Misinterpreted, ‘here I come’ could seem like a warning or a threat. It implies, as in hide-and-seek, that the addressee’s cover is about to be blown. The narrator is already worried by people ‘coming’. The event referred to in the opening words of the song,\n\n‘Man comes to the door …’,\n\nhad brought about the narrator’s original defensive question ‘For whom are you looking?’\n\nCrime\n\nThe narrator’s caginess may be related to criminality. That he is, or has been, involved in crime is suggested by the self-pitying phrase:\n\n‘Police at your back’.\n\nThe nature of the crime is not made explicit. However, quotations from ‘Confessions of a Yakuza’ in verse seven make it likely that he’s a gangster, and the phrase ‘working on the mainline’ suggests involvement in drug trafficking. This would explain why, as we learn in verse six, he had to escape ‘them Georgia laws’; these are particularly harsh for some drug offences.4\n\nIf this is so, the comment:\n\n‘The game is the same—it’s just on a different level’\n\nwould suggest that over time his status changed so that he ended up as gang leader. One possibility is that his fear of visitors is fear of reprisal by a rival gang member.\n\nGiven the possible criminal nature of his work, it’s fittingly ironic that he describes himself as ‘workin’ like the devil’.\n\nMurders\n\nThe ‘devil’ may have been a role model in other respects.\n\nThe ‘Othello’ verse – the middle verse of the song – suggests that the narrator, like Othello in Shakespeare’s play, is jealous and that this has led him to murder his wife. Curiously, in the song it’s the other way round. Desdemona is the murderer:\n\n‘Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket\n\nBy the way, what happened to that poison wine?” She says, “I gave it to you, you drank it”’\n\nApplied to the narrator and his wife, it would be as if his wife has discovered the poison which was meant for her and poisoned him with it. If so, he’d have been hoist with his own petard.\n\nLiterally, of course, he has not been murdered. But as with the real Othello, whose uxoricide resulted in his own death, so the murder the narrator commits might result in his own demise. That would be what he fears every time there’s someone at the door. In reversing the Othello situation, he’s convincing himself that his wife is indirectly responsible for her own murder – perhaps in that her imagined adulterous behaviour towards him has induced him to commit it.\n\nSupport for this view comes from two lines of self-encouragement the narrator indulges in:\n\n‘Poor boy, never say die\n\nThings will be all right by and by’\n\nThe first in specifically mentioning death (‘die’), if taken literally might indicate a wish to avoid capital punishment which some states still have. The second seems to echo the use of the phrase ‘Bye and bye’ in the song of that name which also involves the murder of a woman.\n\nThe narrator may also have murdered other people – not surprising if he is in fact a gangster. The line immediately following the Othello reference,\n\n‘Poor boy, layin’ ‘em straight’,\n\nwould seem to refer to a memory of laying out dead bodies – plural. While this might just have been something he did for his uncle, an undertaker, in the context of poisoning it suggests multiple murders.\n\nA victim early in life might have been his own mother since he refers to her having died. The motive could have been her affair with a travelling salesman which resulted in his own birth and perhaps an unhappy childhood. This might in part explain his use of ‘love’ in the line\n\n‘Time and love has branded me with its claws’.\n\nIt would refer to his mother’s unwise liaison.\n\nSexual assault\n\nThe primary meaning behind\n\n‘Time and love has branded me with its claws’,\n\nthough, is that is that he’s suffered through no fault of his own. Additionally, ‘Time’ might imply he’s been in prison. Either way the line seems to indicate a refusal to accept responsibility for failure both in life generally and in romantic relationships. In the case of relationships he’s clearly being disingenuous. This is made apparent by his declaring\n\n‘All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss\n\nI don’t know any more than this’.\n\nWhile this might seem to be just an innocent expression of how enthralled he is, it can also be seen as his rehearsing a response to an anticipated accusation. Given the context, we can assume the accusation would be one of sexual assault. And we can assume he’s almost certainly guilty. That this is so is made apparent in three ways. The first is that he’s anticipating an accusation at all. The second is his needing to rehearse a denial – and not just in advance, but in advance of any accusation even having been made. And the third is that, were his denial likely to be accepted, there’d be no need to combine it with flattery.\n\nRace\n\nThere’s a further possible reason why the narrator might have murdered his wife. It’s that his father, the travelling salesman, seems to have been black. While there’s nothing explicit to indicate this, there are a number of hints.\n\nOne reason for thinking the narrator might be black is the ‘Othello’ reference. Othello was black. Significantly his wife, Desdemona, was white. If the narrator’s own marriage was racially mixed, it might (directly, or indirectly as in the play) account for the mental state which leads him to his wife’s murder.\n\nAnother reason for thinking he’s black is that the song’s title ‘Po’ Boy’ seems to be in imitation of the black American accent.\n\nThen the line\n\n‘Poor boy, dressed in black’\n\nmight be an allusion to skin colour. (This might be the case even though it could also be a reference to funeral attire; the narrator we can assume has had to attend his mother’s funeral and in a professional capacity attend funerals organised by his uncle.)\n\nAs noted already, what’s significant about the Othello/Desdemona relationship in the song is that the roles are reversed. In the play Othello murders Desdemona. In the song it’s the other way round. This reflects another reversal. In the song Othello expects to dominate his white wife. Not only does he expect his wife to pour his drinks for him, but he issues her with orders:\n\n‘”I’m cold, cover me with a blanket’\n\nWhile these things are in themselves a possible cause of tension, the tension would be exacerbated if the white woman were sufficiently racist to resent being made subservient to a black man.\n\nThat the narrator himself has the attitude of the Othello character is apparent from the first verse in which the narrator expects his wife to be a traditional housewife. She is the one who cooks the meals and she’s expected not to leave the kitchen even when someone asks for her. The salesman is selling goods which he expects to interest her and, although the narrator buys one, his wife is to have no say in what he buys.\n\nAmbition\n\nThe narrator seems to have started his adult life poor. It’s unclear why, although we’re told that from an early age he was without either father or mother. His mother’s background was wealthy, though, and the uncle who looked after him had his own business. We can speculate that his early impoverishment was linked to a surly attitude:\n\n‘I already tol’ you –won’t tell you again’\n\nPrior to becoming a travelling salesman, he may have started out working in his uncle’s funeral business. This would explain why he remembers being:\n\n‘… dressed in black’\n\nif we’re to take that literally. The phrase:\n\n‘… layin’ ‘em straight’\n\nwould refer to laying out the dead.\n\nThe narrator was clearly dissatisfied with his life as a salesman. It’s ironic that while poverty requires him to take on the danger of riding between the carriages of trains, these are ‘first class trains’. The mention of this suggests resentment that others can afford what he can’t. Later, presumably while working in a restaurant, he again shows resentment:\n\n‘Washin’ them dishes, feedin’ them swine’\n\nThe swine might literally be pigs. Equally likely, though, ‘swine’ could indicate what he thinks of those who can afford culinary luxuries which he can’t and which he has to serve them. In the light of that it’s ironic that he expects his wife to remain working in the kitchen when the visitor asks to speak to her.\n\nThe resentment of the better off is also ironic since his aim is to achieve a similar wealthy status:\n\n‘Build ya a house out of mortar and bricks’\n\nA house is what he eventually acquires – and it’s presumably of a reasonable size since it includes a store, and the front door is at a distance from the kitchen. He also affects the speech of those he aspires to be like when he asks with absurd formality:\n\n‘’”For whom are you looking?”’\n\nContrast ‘where you been?’ – a more plebeian register which comes naturally to him when he’s addressing himself.\n\nWhether his work has improved is unclear. He’s been ‘workin’ like the devil’ and the work itself is:\n\n‘… just on a different level’,\n\nthe word ‘just’ implying there’s not much difference. Whether he’s telling the truth is another matter. When he claims to have been reduced to\n\n‘Pickin’ up the cherries fallin’ off the plate’,\n\nit’s noticeable that it’s cherries rather than, say, crumbs which he picks up. He may not have been quite as badly off as he’s making out.\n\n***\n\nThe narrator’s ambition for a better life is indicated unconsciously on several occasions by his choice of language. References to different levels figure throughout. His new work is:\n\n‘… up on a different level’.\n\nHe was:\n\n‘… pickin’ up sticks’,\n\nand\n\n‘pickin’ up cherries’\n\n– each perhaps indicating an attempt at self-improvement. On the other hand he was forced to\n\n‘Call down to room service’\n\nbut only so that they’d\n\n‘Send up a room’.\n\nAnd he tried to avoid:\n\n‘… fallin’ …’\n\nfrom his precarious position between first class carriages.\n\nAnd whereas at one point his use of ‘beyond the twinklin’ stars’ seems to indicate how out of control he’d felt in his earlier life, in the final verse he imagines being:\n\n’… ‘neath the stars that shine’\n\n– in other words dead and buried, the ultimate failure. This hasn’t come about yet but, whenever there’s an unexpected visitor he’s anticipating it. Despite that, by the end of the song the darkness of the narrator’s life, represented by the night sky and the constant references to death, has been somewhat relieved. The stars are no longer just fitfully twinkling; they now ‘shine’, indicating a steadiness which the earlier ‘twinkling’ does not have.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe song gives us an idea of the narrator’s life and character through his own thoughts. Through them we learn about the different stages of his life – his parentage, upbringing, work and eventual success in throwing off poverty thus becoming more like his mother than his father. We learn that he was surly in his youth, that he had a series of menial jobs, that he became involved in organised crime, and that his crimes included sexual assault and possibly one or more murders. We also find out that he blames circumstances for his misfortunes, sometimes justifiably, but never blames himself. There’s an indication, too, that he exaggerates his misfortune. Despite all this he has a wry sense of humour and can be both grateful and kind.\n\nWhile the narrator’s attempt to acquire a lifestyle in line with that of his mother rather than his father is successful materially, his life is overshadowed by darkness. It’s associated with night, the gloom of a hotel room, black clothing, the death of his mother, a funeral parlour and the colour of Othello’s skin. Relief from the darkness is represented by twinkling and, ultimately, shining stars. Nevertheless the darkness remains, not least in the form of fear. The narrator seems to be constantly afraid that his crimes or enemies are going to catch up with him.\n\nNotes\n\nThe Guardian quotes the following passage from Saga’s novel: ‘My mother…was the daughter of a wealthy farmer…died when I was 11…my father was a travelling salesman…I never met him. [My uncle] was a nice man, I won’t forget him (pages 57-58)’ The Guardian 10.7.2003\n\nRelated to ‘One, Two, Buckle My Shoe’ there’s ‘”Three dollars … Will you take four?”’, ‘‘Knockin on the door’, ‘Pickin’ up sticks’, and ‘Layin’ em straight’ (which replaces ‘Close the gate’ in one version of the rhyme). Other words which figure in both the rhyme and the song are ‘black’, ‘kitchen’ and ‘plate’.\n\nSince it is reminiscent of the repeated question ‘Where have you been, my blue-eyed son?’ in ‘A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall’ where it can be interpreted as wanting to know what appalling things the son has witnessed, the question ‘poor boy, where you been?’ might also be taken as implying that the addressee’s experiences have been bad.\n\nI’m assuming this was also true at the unspecified time the song is set: ‘Few states are as strict with laws surrounding drugs as Georgia. In Georgia, penalties are severe and range dependent on A) the nature of the offense (possession of drugs, intent to distribute or sell drugs, or trafficking drugs) and B) the specific drug you are being prosecuted for’ (Bixon Law, 5 May 2021, accessed 28.7.23)\n\n4.8.23 ‘Sexual assault’ section added and minor adjustments made.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a love song – of sorts. The narrator clearly wants a relationship with the person he calls Queen Jane but it’s far from certain that his feelings are reciprocated. The song is primarily concerned with the psychologies of each. Both narrator and addressee are complex characters, neither of them fully in control of their own destiny.\n\nThe song is in the form of a monologue. Curiously each of the five short verses begins either ‘When’ or ‘Now when’, indicating that none of the events has yet taken place. They’re merely predicted. Furthermore, it becomes apparent that the predicted events referred to are spread over an extensive period of time – perhaps years, starting from the addressee’s childhood. Because of this, and despite the monologue form, the words can’t be part of an actual conversation. They might be better seen as the narrator’s working out a strategy for convincing the addressee that she’d be better off with him.\n\nThe narrator\n\nThroughout most of each verse the narrator seems confident in his predictions. By the end of each verse that confidence has gone. Prediction has given way to a heartfelt plea:\n\n‘Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?’\n\nThe narrator’s desperation is made further apparent by his repeating the line each time he utters it. And the negative opening ‘Won’t you’ (rather than, say, ‘You must’) makes it apparent he doubts whether she will come and see him.\n\nThis lack of confidence is accompanied by another very human trait – a lack of self-knowledge. When the addressee has experienced one disaster after another, the narrator predicts that she’ll be:\n\n‘… sick of all this repetition’\n\nIt’s the repetition of failed relationships, as distinct from failure itself, which he knows will upset her. It’s ironic, then, that he should blithely go ahead with repetitions of his own. First there’s the word ‘all’ – ‘all your invitations’, ‘all of your creations’, ‘all of the flower ladies’, ‘all of your children’, ‘all the clowns’, ‘all this repetition’ !!!, ‘all of your advisers’, ‘all the bandits’ and ‘all lay down’. Then there’s his question in the refrain, ‘Won’t you come see me…?’ which gets asked in exactly the same form no less than ten times. Furthermore his attempt to win her can itself be seen as a repetition of the very sort of thing he knows she’s sick of.\n\nThere’s more. The words ‘you’, ‘your’ and ‘you’re’ together occur a total of twenty times (not including in the refrain). The effect is to highlight the addressee’s problems or failure to deal with them. Making her the focus of attention like this seems extraordinarily inept, and even more so given that the narrator knows she’s:\n\n‘… tired of herself’\n\nIt’s not as if he’s building her up, giving her confidence.\n\nHowever, while the narrator may be unwittingly clumsy, there might also be some method in his madness. The repetition of ‘all’ would seem to have to be for the purpose of exaggeration – to make the addressee’s lot seem as bad as possible so as to get her to come flying to him. Such a tactic would seem necessary since he says little to recommend himself. The only self-recommendation he has is that he’d make no demands on her:\n\n‘And you want somebody you don’t have to speak to’\n\nOverall, his ineptness together with his doubts make success seem unlikely.\n\nFamily relationships\n\n­The first three verses almost certainly look forward to different times. In the first, which concerns the addressee’s relationship with her family, she seems to be in her teens. In the second she’s probably been married, is perhaps divorced, and has a number of children. While it’s plausible that she had these children while still living at home, the ‘creations’ the father says she’s tired of, this would seem unlikely.\n\nA cause of the addressee’s misery becomes clear in the first verse. It’s her family:\n\n‘When your mother sends back all your invitations’\n\nWe don’t know the circumstances so we can’t condemn the mother out of hand. Nevertheless, the narrator makes her seem cold and controlling in that the addressee doesn’t seem to be having a say regarding the invitations. Her father, in attempting to put the sister in the picture by ‘explaining’ how things are, comes across as gentle but insensitive:\n\n‘And your father to your sister he explains\n\nThat you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations’\n\nNow all the family know that there’s something wrong. How must that make the addressee feel?\n\nWe needn’t take the song as an outright condemnation of parental ineptitude, however. The second verse puts things in a different light:\n\n‘And all your children start to resent you’\n\nTime, we can assume, has moved on. A generation later, and relationships are markedly similar. It’s no longer the addressee who is fed up, though, but her own children who are fed up with her. It would seem she hasn’t learnt from her own parents’ mistakes. Either that, or parent child relationships are destined never to change.\n\nPoverty\n\nThe second verse begins:\n\n‘When all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you’\n\nWhy, one wonders, does the addressee need to borrow from ‘flower ladies’, and indeed why does she need to borrow at all? If its flowers she’s borrowing, while th"
