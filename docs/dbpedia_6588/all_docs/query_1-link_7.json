The first blank in your question suggests that the difference lies in the recognition of the letter \"P\" when presented alone versus when it is presented within the word \"Apple.\"\n\nIn this case, the answer would be that you will likely recognize the letter \"P\" faster when it is presented on its own rather than within the word \"Apple.\" The word superiority effect occurs because reading is a highly practiced and automated skill that relies on recognizing patterns and processing information efficiently.\n\nWhen presented with an isolated letter, our visual system can quickly match it to stored representations in our memory. However, when the letter is embedded within a word, additional processes such as word recognition and context integration come into play, which can slow down the overall recognition process.\n\nTherefore, the second blank in your question can be filled with \"slower.\" The recognition of the letter \"P\" is generally slower when it is presented within the word \"Apple\" compared to when it is presented in isolation.\n\nTo learn more about superiority\n\nhttps://brainly.com/question/30758853\n\n#SPJ11\n\nThe question asks for the missing characteristic commonly associated with motivation, along with activation and intensity.\n\nThe three basic characteristics commonly associated with motivation are activation, persistence, and intensity.

In response, employees feel valued, respected, and motivated to perform their duties to the best of their abilities.\n\nHowever, if managers assume that their subordinates are lazy, unproductive, and unintelligent, they may treat them with disrespect, ignore their suggestions, and micromanage them. This behavior can result in subordinates becoming disengaged, less productive, and even resistant to managers' demands, leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy.In conclusion, managers' beliefs and assumptions regarding their subordinates can significantly impact employee behavior and performance.\n\nTherefore, managers should be careful to avoid negative assumptions, treat all employees with respect, and provide opportunities for development to achieve better results.\n\nTo know more about Pygmalion effect visit-\n\nbrainly.com/question/14648486\n\n#SPJ11\n\nDr. Ames carried out a study to evaluate the efficacy of a workshop, \"Learning to Control Test Anxiety\" which was conducted for six weeks to help the 150 students reduce their anxiety levels before and after the workshop. To test the hypothesis that the anxiety scores were reduced by the workshop, Dr. Ames should carry out a Paired T-test.\n\nA paired t-test, also known as a dependent t-test, is utilized to examine the mean differences between two related groups of the same individual or different groups of individuals. The purpose of a paired t-test is to determine whether or not there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. It is also utilized to determine the mean changes before and after an intervention or treatment in a single group of participants.In this study, Dr. Ames has assessed 150 students' anxiety before and after the workshop, which makes the two groups related.\n\nBy using a paired t-test, Dr. Ames can examine whether there was a significant decrease in anxiety scores for students after the workshop or not.The paired t-test assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and that the data is continuous in nature. If Dr. Ames finds that the data violates these assumptions, she may utilize a nonparametric test such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. If the data adheres to the assumptions for the paired t-test, she can then calculate a t-value and p-value. The t-value shows the difference between the means and how large this difference is relative to the sample size. The p-value indicates the statistical significance of this difference.\n\nThe two-tailed test is used for the paired t-test as the alternative hypothesis is not stated as either greater than or less than the null hypothesis. For this test, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the means of the two related groups. If the p-value is less than the alpha level of significance (typically 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is concluded that there is a significant difference between the two groups. If the p-value is greater than 0.05, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
