Summary\n\nFlames is a bit of an out-there story right from the beginning: Levi is attempting to build a coffin for his sister Charlotte because the women in their family come back to life after dying. Neither of them is that close to dying - both are young adults. Charlotte doesnât really want a coffin so she runs away from home, as far as she can while still remaining in Tasmania at least, and Robbie Arnott takes us on this adventure through interweaving perspectives and rich imagery of his home island.\n\nSome of these perspectives are surprising and unexpected, ranging from a hardcore private investigator to a river god in the form of a water rat, but each of them earns their place in the story. Our job when studying this text is to follow these shifts in perspectives and make sense of how they contribute to the overall text. If youâre writing creatively, you may want to play around with this sort of structure as well in your piece.\n\n2. What Is Magical Realism?\n\nBefore we get stuck into the text itself, it might be useful to first discuss its genre. Magical realism books tend to be extremely confusing if youâre not familiar with the genre (and sometimes even when you are!). This is because authors in this genre will typically set their stories in the real world (in this case, in Tasmania), but theyâll add supernatural elements, which vary wildly from story to story.\n\nLetâs unpack the genre a bit more, in particular, what it involves and why itâs used.\n\nElements of Magical Realism\n\nThe most important element of magical realism is that it blends the real world with fantastical elements. In Flames, the most obvious example is gods: gods donât exist as far as we know, but they walk among humans and play key roles in this text. Less obvious examples of fantastical elements include the wombat farm at Melaleuca (fortunately nobody actually skins wombats) as well as the Oneblood tuna and (unfortunately!) the pet seals.\n\nThe fact that these examples are narrated as perfectly normal is another element of magical realism: the author usually operates as if the fantastical elements are perfectly real. We, as readers, enter a world where the existence of these magical things is taken for granted by the characters.\n\nPurpose of Magical Realism\n\nThis blurring of the lines between real and magical is primarily supposed to suspend our disbelief: we canât really be sure whatâs real about the novelâs world and what isnât. All we know is that in many respects, it looks like our own. Within this familiar setting, Arnott lets his own imagination run wild and leaves the reader to figure out the rest. This helps to create a sense of wonder, as if these elements could be real and as magical as described.\n\nThese elements also contribute to the story in other ways: in particular, they open up new possibilities for commentary. For example, the voice of the South Esk god is used to highlight the impacts of colonialism and the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that was brought with it.\n\nOther Magical Realism Books\n\nIf youâre liking the sound of this genre and/or if you enjoyed Flames, thereâs plenty more to discover in the way of magical realism. Itâs a hallmark of Latin American literature (Isabel Allende, Gabriel GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez), and itâs also been picked up in Japan by the likes of Haruki Murakami. A prominent Australian example is Carpentaria by Alexis Wright.\n\n3. Themes\n\nDeath and Grief\n\nLetâs move more closely into Flames, starting with its central theme of death and grief. Itâs what defines this central point of tension between Levi and Charlotte throughout the novel, since it starts with their divergent responses to their motherâs death (and reincarnation etc.). Their divergent responses suggest that thereâs no one way to cope with death, and their fatherâs reaction on top of that introduces further complexity: he disappears from their lives altogether, ânot want[ing] to be close to them when they [died]â. Between the three of them, there are three very different expressions of grief.\n\nBut Edith McAllister is not the only death of significance in the novel. Another standout is the passing of Karlâs seal, after which he becomes haunted by âclicksâ; he subsequently leaves tuna-hunting behind. The death of the South Esk god is also explored as causing grief, this time in the form of divine emotional outpouring, âa cloudâs sorrowâ. Arnott is thus exploring many processes of grieving, from solitude and callousness to physical and emotional labour.\n\nFamily Relationships\n\nOutside of these moments of grieving, Arnott explores the background relationships between family members as well. Again, Levi and Charlotte are central to this. As siblings, they donât always see eye to eye: âLevi and I have never understood each otherâ. However, that does not diminish their love for each other, particularly as they were left alone after their motherâs death. Their father Jack again makes this dynamic more complicated: he sees an âunbridgeable gapâ between himself and Levi for example, but the omniscient third-person narrator in that chapter knows otherwise. Consider what difference it makes when Arnott writes in first person from within these relationships (as he does with Charlotte) versus when he writes in third person, observing from outside.\n\nWe also see interesting relationships between Karl and his daughter Nicola. Unlike the McAllisters, the two of them are remarkably close despite his ongoing grief for his seal: ânothing could match the blaze of love in her fatherâs smileâ.\n\nRomantic Relationships\n\nNicola crops up again under this theme, as she begins to navigate a relationship with Charlotte. In a book review for The Guardian, Sam Jordison argues that this is a bit trite, but we can think of it as one perspective on how relationships begin: organically and sincerely, and out of a desire to protect someone else. By contrast, the start of Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on something more artificial and manipulative, a âtiny sparkâ which he ignited in her mind.\n\nThis is bookended with romantic relationships that have come to an end, as explored through the eyes of the private investigator: her and her ex-husband, Graham Malik, have settled into something of an âecosystemâ. With these various beginnings and endings, Arnott shows how it can be natural - or supernatural - to fall in and out of love.\n\nColonisation\n\nFinally, this novel touches on the impacts of colonisation. Itâs a few quiet allusions here and there, but they are important: Arnott acknowledges the impact of colonisation on the natural landscape of his birthplace. He does this firstly through the eyes of the South Esk god, who observes the âfoul industriesâ of the âloud, pale apesâ when they first arrived on palawa and pakana land, the land we now know as Tasmania.\n\nArnott also explores colonisation through the eyes of Jack, who experiences racism when taking on the human form of an Aboriginal person. He wanted to learn more about how European colonisers were using fire, but he found âthey reacted poorly to his dark appearanceâ. Meanwhile, First Nations people in Tasmania were being âhunted in their own homelandâ, and he chooses not to intervene.\n\nAs immortal outside observers, their perspectives are the only ones in the novel that can really trace this history. Arnott might be including them so readers take his descriptions of nature with a grain of salt: even as we appreciate Australiaâs beautiful landscape, itâs worth acknowledging its custodians who have kept it that way for tens of thousands of years.\n\n4. Symbols & Analysis\n\nSupernatural Creatures\n\nWeâve traced the major purposes of these deities already, but to reiterate them here these âgodsâ symbolise different parts of nature and the wonder Arnott derives from them. Although nature is already alive, these figures help it feel even more so. They also serve the important purpose of highlighting and acknowledging Tasmaniaâs colonial history, as well as the disconnect between humankind and nature.\n\nWater\n\nThe one natural element worth discussing as its own symbol is water. There are many bodies of water identified in the novel, from rivers and lakes to the ocean, and they each have their own significance. For example, rivers connect parts of the natural landscape while lakes (particularly Crater Lake) represent a getaway, solace, solitude and peace.\n\nThe ocean is the most complex of these symbols though: itâs all around the island of Tasmania, and it appears to be a vicious and unforgiving place filled with orcas and tunas the size of âmountainsâ. But itâs also a place that brings calm to Edith and Charlotte, and even Levi as a child. Arnott canvasses all of these different relationships to nature through the different manifestations of water. Water even exists as rain, which in the novelâs denouement represents a new beginning, a washing away of past tensions and conflicts.\n\n5. Quotes\n\nLevi\n\nâMy sister is struggling to cope with the lossâ¦I cannot allow her pain to continue.â\n\nâThey (Levi and Jack) were so alikeâÂ\n\nCharlotte\n\nâThe tears were flames, and they were coming from within Charlotte.â\n\nâLevi and I have never understood each otherâÂ\n\nGods\n\nâSome wore fur and feathers and watched over the creatures they resembledâ¦ Some, like a blood-hungry bird spirit he encountered deep in the southwest, were cruel. Most were calm, seeking only to care for the creatures and land that they felt drawn closest to.â\n\nâHe (the South Esk god) continued on, soothing his rage in a simple, humble way - by nipping screws out of the hull of an idle jetskiâ\n\nâLiving with humans did not workâ\n\n6. Sample Essay Topics\n\nMore than anything else, Flames illustrates the importance of family. Discuss.\n\nLevi McAllister is the hero of Flames. Do you agree?\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nWhat is the effect of shifting narrative perspectives as used in Flames?\n\nâI could have spoken to him but he would not have listened.â What does Arnott say around family?Â\n\n7. Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nWhenever you get a new essay topic, you can use LSGâs THINK and EXECUTE strategy, a technique to help you write better VCE essays. This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nHow does genre contribute to the storytelling effect of Flames?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nWhen talking about the genre of this text, weâll definitely need to discuss magical realism. The question here is about how magical realism enriches or contributes to the story, so it might be worth breaking down the elements of magical realism and thinking through each of them one-by-one. The fact that this prompt is framed as a âhowâ question (one of the 5 types of essay questions) also means weâll have to bring in Arnott and how he chooses to tell the story.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nOne magical realism element Arnott adopts is the gods, who play a few roles symbolically in the novel, but there are other elements too: the seals, the flames, the cormorants and so on. Do these elements add as much as the gods, and if so, what are they adding?\n\nConsider also not just the elements as they appear, but also how Arnott is treating them. The fact that a lot of them are taken for granted as perfectly normal is in itself another genre element.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nInstead of talking about the elements too disparately or separately, I think a lot of them revolve around this central question of how humans relate to the earth and to one another. This will help connect my ideas to one another.\n\nParagraph 1: Elements of magical realism show how humans adversely impact nature\n\nNature is a huge part of the story: around the island, we see everything from beaches and rivers to âundulating moorlands of peat and buttongrassâ. Sometimes, these elements are personified as deities (e.g. South Esk god) â this is where genre comes in, since these deities are supernatural or âmagicalâ, though they are written to exist in our world.\n\nThese voices, made possible by magical realism, highlight the impact of human industry on the environment: for example the âblood-tasting tang of ironâ that seeps into Tasmaniaâs waterways.\n\nEven Jack and Edithâs relationship could be seen as a metaphorical take on our incompatibility with nature: âliving with humans did not workâ.\n\nParagraph 2: At the same time, not all humans contribute equally to this pollution, and magical elements also facilitate commentary on this perspective\n\nBefore European colonisers arrived in Australia, the land had been tended to by the First Nations peoples for over 60,000 years - and pollution had been minimal. We cannot blame the entire human race equally for the deteriorating natural environment (see this Instagram post for an explanation!).\n\nThis is pointed out by the South Esk god: it is the âpale apesâ who are trying to âswamp[] over everythingâ.\n\nJack, the deity of flame, also recognises this, although he is far more complicit: âhe liked learning from the pale people more than he wanted to helpâ Aboriginal people.\n\nMagical realism adds this historical and political dimension to the narrative.\n\nParagraph 3: However, Arnottâs use of magical realism also shows possibilities for âidealâ relationships between humans, and between humans and nature\n\nThis paragraph gets to draw on some examples that arenât just the deities: the seals for example coexist really poetically with humans, âthe half of themselves they had been born withoutâ (these were inspired by dogs, by the way).\n\nPlus, even though Jack and Edithâs relationship was founded on a lie, Arnott is able to use that as a point of contrast for the relationship between Charlotte and Nicola, born from Nicolaâs âdesire to helpâ, plus her âfast and firmâ attraction to Charlotte. This relationship is highly organic, and the âmagicalâ relationship between Charlotteâs parents proves a useful foil.\n\nEven though some textual elements are exaggerated because of genre, Arnott still manages to use magical realism to highlight what might be possible, inviting the reader to imagine possibilities for harmony between people and nature within their own worlds.\n\nFlames is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

Rookeâs primary conflict is his choice between his moral conscience and duty as a soldier. Because he is aware from an early age that he is out of step with the world, he tends to be more reasonable in his way of dealing with conflict. His final response to his inner conflict is to stand strongly by what he believes.\n\nThe Lieutenant at its core is a journey of self-discovery as Daniel Rooke navigates the immoral waters of British imperialism and its impact on the indigenous Australians. Becoming closer to Tagaran, Rooke attempts to bridge cultural barriers through the transformative power of language. Rooke observes the scissions created by violence and the perhaps misplaced Western superiority and is perpetually torn between his moral intuitions and his obligations and duty as a Lieutenant.\n\nTIP: Have an understanding of the historical context behind The Lieutenant as well as the real life people that Grenville loosely based her novel off of. This means having a grasp on the first fleet, the British colonisation of Australia and important figures such as Bennelong.\n\nThemes\n\nTIP: I have included some examples from the text but this list is by no means exhaustive, occasionally there is a repetition of examples. Itâs important to remember that examples are versatile and can be applied to many different themes and ideas. Feel free to add and explore how other examples might enhance these themes.\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguage dictates commonality and communication, yet to Rooke he discovers that central to the power of language is the willingness to cooperate, patience and respect. Throughout Grenvilleâs novel, however, it is clear that language can not only dispel the lasting vestiges of misunderstanding but it can also form the basis for racism and violence. It is through our language itself that reveals our biases.\n\nThe language of racism\n\nWeymark refers to the Indigenous men during their first encounter as âmister darkieâ etc. each a patronising euphemism concealing his arrogant notions of superiority\n\nThe limitation of language to accurately portray and convey a moment\n\nâwhat had passed between Tagaran and himself had gone far beyond vocabulary or grammatical formsâ (pg186)\n\nThe language of violence\n\nâwhat it said was I can kill you. He did not want her to learn that language. Certainly not from himâ (pg224)\n\nâViolence had an enlivening effect. As long as someone else was the victim it made the blood pump, gave the world an edge of glamourâ (pg239)\n\nâGamekeeper. He wondered whether that word had killed Brugdenâ (pg240)\n\nâThe gun is the only language the buggers will understandâ (pg241)\n\nâwar was a species of conversationâ (pg108)\n\nAssumed cultural superiority of British empire\n\nThe hierarchical nature of British Society stands in diametric opposition to the community-oriented system employed by the Indigenous Australians. This hierarchy defines their people by their contributions to âHer Majestyâ and shames and âpunish[es]â all those who fail to comply with the loose morals and violence condoned by the British colonists. This notion is elucidated through the exploitation of the natives and the nations reliance on oppression and servitude to maintain its imperial status, put simply: their strength is an accident arising from the weakness of others. It is on this foundation that Grenville explores the violent treatment of the natives by the British and even their treatment of their own people.\n\nâIn the world of Church Street, Benjamin Rooke was a man of education and standing and a father to be proud of. At the Portsmouth Naval Academy a mile away, he was an embarrassmentâ (pg6)\n\nâSo we punishâ¦. Every man is the same. If he steals, he is punishedâ¦ It was interesting to hear that magnificent idea â the product of hundreds of years of British civilisation â spelled out so plainâ(pg195)\n\nThis was justice: impartial, blind, noble. The horror of the punishment was the proof of its impartiality. If it did not hurt, it was not justice.â (pg197)\n\nâBy god they are savageâ¦ Dirty too, look at the filth on themâ\n\nâthey may be savages, we call them savages. But their feelings are no different from oursâ\n\nWeymark resorts to derogatory name calling, urging on âmy black friendâ and âMister Darkieâ in his base supplications\n\nPower of conscience\n\nThe morality that is ingrained in Rooke from the onset aligns quite naturally with our own moral standards. Yet Grenville encourages readers to explore the difficult choice between morals and disobedience. Rooke faces such a choice. To obey an order to accompany an expedition to capture or kill six indigenous men, this forms the central conflict of Grenvilleâs novel. As elucidated through both Rooke and Gardiner, moral acts that defy the expectations and âorders of Her Majestyâ are deeply frowned upon.\n\nâBut Rooke, think: this is not a request, it is an orderâ (pg246)\n\nââ¦spell out the consequences of refusal.â (pg248)\n\nââ¦ the service of humanity and the service of His Majesty were not congruentâ (pg249)\n\nâI am sorry to have been persuaded to comply with the order. I would not for any reason ever obey a similar orderâ (pg285)\n\nâyour orders were a most gravely wrong thing, I regret beyond my words my part in the businessâ (pg285)\n\nViolence\n\nViolence is central to the operation of imperialists as the British tightens its grip on the Indigenous Australians. Grenville emphasises that the power sought out by the British empire will always come at the expense of the natives. Violence and force are used to assert power, confirm boundaries around usurped land, promulgate fear and discourage resistance. The gun becomes a symbol of the violence and force of the settle and they show little intention of relinquishing the dominant position that the gun affords them.\n\nThe punishment for the mutineers of the Renegade reinforces Rookeâs understanding of institutional power and violence as one lieutenant is hanged in a gruesome spectacle and the others dispatched into a nameless void.\n\nWeymark is determined to affirm his dominance and establish the white man as a powerful force\n\nBrugdenâs increased freedom with a weapon results in violence towards the natives which culminates in the kidnapping of the two native men who are âgrabbedâ against their will\n\nBrugdenâs unchecked brutality, and Gilbertâs excessive use of force, highlights the colonialistsâ use of violence as a means of achieving their goal\n\nDuty, service, obedience and the military life\n\nConforming to the pressures of the British Empire, Rooke joins the marines and complicitly serves without attempting to question the morality behind his actions. Importantly, he joins the marines not out of patriotic pride, but because he believes it will aid him to pursue his academic curiosities and steer away from violence. Yet it only brings him closer to the reality that lurks behind the ostensibly moral quest of British imperialism.\n\nCharacter Analysis\n\nTIP: Whilst The Lieutenant focusses on Rookeâs experiences, you canât neglect the minor characters in the novel, they are there for a reason! Think about how these characters are similar or different, how their stories contribute to Grenvilleâs overall message and their relationship with the central protagonist Rooke. â\n\nDaniel Rooke\n\nAnalysis\n\nLieutenant on the first fleet\n\nAwkward\n\nStruggles to articulate his thoughts and emotions as he is afraid of being âout of step with the worldâ\n\nFrom a young age, Rookeâs interactions with others has made it clear to him that he is different.

What does it add to Rookeâs journey? Why does Rooke choose to do this?\n\nThird Person Omniscient Narration\n\nWritten from Rookeâs perspective, whose opinion do we hear the least of? And what unique perspective does Grenvilleâs choice of narrative perspective offer us?\n\nLanguage\n\nGrenvilleâs language reflects Rookeâs love for language. Her choice of imagery reveals Rookeâs way of seeing the world. For example, âcrescent of yellow sand like a punctuation markâ accentuates Rookeâs tendency to observe his world as a linguist might and Â highlights Rookeâs deep connection with language. Likewise, Rookeâs perception of a gun that speaks a language that âdoes not require listenersâ emphasises his natural tendency to think as a linguist. Grenville does not write in an overly complex, dense or poetic way in order to mirror Rookeâs tendency to view things logically\n\nSetting\n\nHow does the setting that Rooke finds himself in mirror or parallel the emotions that he experiences?\n\nNaval Academy (Portsmouth)\n\nâjust another world that wrenched him out of shapeâ\n\nâsucked out of his spirit and left a shell beingâ\n\nâclosed in on itselfâ, ânarrowâ, âsqueezed tightlyâ\n\nSydney Cove\n\nâThere is nowhere in the world that I would rather beâ(pg97)\n\n\"On the northern shore, high dark prows of headlands hung over the water, the sombre woods pressing down into their own reflections. To the south the land was lower, each bay and promontory shining with the glossy leaves of mangroves. Now and then between them a crescent of yellow sand was like a punctuation markâ (pg89)\n\nTIP: Just like the minor characters I mentioned before, meaning and themes come from all aspects of a novel not just plot points and major characters.

The extra quote with the prompt can seem superfluous, but often, they can provide hints about how to tackle or challenge the essay topic. It is there for a reason, and if you are familiar with the quote, I would recommend that you try to incorporate it into your essay!\n\nBefore we unpack todayâs essay topic, letâs have a look at background information.\n\nKate Grenvilleâs The Lieutenant explores the commonality of the human spirit amidst tumultuous conflict during the First Fleetâs arrival in Australia in 1788. Drawing upon the true experiences of William Dawes, a British astronomer and one of the lieutenants to travel with the First Fleet, Grenville crafts a work of fiction inspired by Dawesâ âtwo little blue notebooksâ detailing his growing understanding of the Aboriginal language Gadigal and his conversations and connection with Patyegarang, a young Aboriginal girl.\n\nThe ability for two individuals from completely different worlds to transcend their differences in order to share cherished moments and understandings together is exemplified in The Lieutenant, alongside the rife external and internal conflicts which threaten such relationship.\n\nTodayâs prompt is:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different paths.â\n\nHow does Grenville explore Rookeâs conflict of conscience in The Lieutenant?\n\nStart off with focusing on the keywords in this prompt, especially the phrases that resonate with you for Steps 1 and 2 of brainstorming (which I have previously covered in other essay topic breakdowns.)\n\nIn particular, letâs have a look at the phrase âconflict of conscienceâ as this captures the essence of the prompt and what you will need to discuss in your essay. Â\n\nConflict of conscience suggests internal conflict, which implies that we will need to consider morality and the concepts of right and wrong, especially when a difficult decision must be made and âsidesâ need to be taken. Â\n\nConflict itself is a central theme of The Lieutenant, however, it is important to recognise that this topic considers conflict through the narrower lens of âconflict of conscienceâ. This means that in your discussion, the relevance to the prompt is crucial to keep in mind to ensure you are actually answering the question! Â\n\nBut first, letâs analyse the quote:\n\nâBut a man could not travel along two different pathsâ\n\nThis quote alludes to Rookeâs realisation regarding the reality of his identity, not only as Tagaranâs friend or âkamaraâ but also as a soldier or âBerewalgal\". The resignation and recognition of the impossible â that is, for Rooke to continue attempting to appease both âsidesâ without making critical decisions about who and what he ultimately valued more - is evident in this quote. Hence, this quote refers to the conflict of conscience he experiences and provides us with an insight into not only his character but also conflict itself.\n\nWhy is it not possible for a man to travel along two different paths?\n\nWhat would happen if he tried? Â\n\nWhy was this realisation important for Rooke, especially for his character and development?\n\nThese are the kinds of questions coming to mind upon seeing that quote alone, which all provide hints as to how I might tackle this prompt. Â\n\nNow that we have looked at a few ideas related to the question, weâll now move into potential paragraphs for this essay.\n\nParagraph 1: Grenvilleâs utilisation of Rookeâs perspective in detailing his thought processes, observations and realisations reveals the facets of Rookeâs character contributing to his internal conflicts.\n\nRemembering this is a âhowâ prompt, we want to be analysing ways in which Grenville explores Rookeâs conflict of conscience. In this paragraph, I have chosen to focus on the raw and intimate expression of his inner thoughts and consciousness as the âhowâ aspect. Â\n\nThe detailed perspective reveals Rookeâs naivety in assuming the possibility of maintaining a peaceful connection with Tagaran and the Aboriginal community amidst turbulent and violent times. Consequently, it highlights his realisations regarding the morality of the conflicts he is involved in, and how despite oneâs admirable intentions, âa man could not travel along two different pathsâ without facing dire consequences for their actions. Â\n\nQuestions I might ask myself here include: why does Rooke initially try to deny the reality of his situation? What does his preference for a peaceful and accepting approach towards the Indigenous Australians suggest about his approach to conflict?\n\nThis cognitive dissonance ultimately contributes to his internal conflict between the value he places in his connections with Tagaran and her community and in his duties and obligations as a lieutenant. As readers, we come to realise the duality of this conflict in Rookeâs mind through the limited omniscient third person perspective, which provides us with an insight into Rookeâs shifting understandings of Indigenous people, conflict and even himself. Â\n\nI would then continue unpacking these changing understandings, especially ones relevant to his character which reveal his internal conflicts further. â\n\nParagraph 2: In addition, the stark contrast between Rookeâs approach to his conflict of conscience and other soldiersâ approaches underscores the rationale behind his actions and the stakes ineluctably linked with his choices and morality. Â\n\nThis paragraphâs analysis revolves around Grenvilleâs inclusion of a host of different characters and outlooks - from Indigenous Australians to intransigent Colonial perspectives. I would emphasise the importance of juxtaposition between these different perspectives as it elucidates the values and beliefs underpinning each individualâs choices, especially during conflict. Â\n\nAlthough the core of the essay discusses internal conflicts, highlighting the connection between internal and external conflict would add another layer of complexity to your essay. Rookeâs conflict of conscience results in his permanent departure from Australia, and fleshing out the ramifications of dissent and opposition towards other Colonials is key in demonstrating your understanding of the complex and intertwined nature of conflict.\n\nParagraph 3: Through the detrimental implications of Rookeâs initial conflict avoidance, Grenvilleâs focus on his subsequent self-awareness to unite his morals and his actions highlights the strength of his character to resolve his internal conflicts to prevent further perpetration of injustice towards the Aboriginal population. Â\n\nHere, I am having a closer look at how Rooke's encounters with his conflicts of conscience and the repercussions of his actions in attempting to take a âmiddle-groundâ stance catalyse his development as an individual - in particular, how it solidifies his moral stance and his decision to act in a manner that reflects his beliefs. Â\n\nBy showing Tagaran how to load the gun but not how to fire it, or by accepting the navigator role but distancing oneself from the group, he endeavours to avoid conflict with either âsideâ. However, passivity is a stance within itself, and in the case of the treatment towards Indigenous Australians, Rookeâs silence in not rejecting the actions of other âBerewalgalâ inevitably enables injustice to continue. Â\n\nIt is only through his understanding that non-committal actions also incriminate him as a perpetrator that his choice to sacrifice his Colonial obligations for taking an active stance to fulfil his moral obligations comes to light. This reveals the role that internal conflicts may have in inciting powerful change and realisations in an individual. Â\n\nThe complexity of internal conflict can be difficult to discuss, but by using the quote provided in the prompt and asking yourself questions about the implications of the quote, we are able to delve into and construct a sophisticated understanding of The Lieutenant and of conflict itself.\n\nLSG-curated sample essay topics for The Lieutenant\n\nNow it's your turn!

The first part follows their childhood, and their interactions with characters such as Boo Radley, Walter Cunningham, Miss Caroline and Mrs Dubose, while the second part follows the Tom Robinson trial itself, testing the children on the moral lessons of their childhood and disillusioning them to the overwhelming racism of their community.\n\nWeâll be going through the novelâs major themes, and also looking at it a bit more critically within the historical context of civil rights and racial justice struggles.\n\nBefore we dive into To Kill A Mockingbird, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nPrejudice and Race in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nAll throughout the novel resonate messages of tolerance over prejudice. However, before any question of race is introduced, the children must confront their prejudices about Boo Radley, a local recluse who was rumoured to have attacked his parents. While they (particularly Jem and Dill) lowkey harass Boo by playing around his yard, re-enacting dramaticised versions of his life, and sending notes into his house with a fishing pole, they undoubtedly get drawn into the rumours as well: he was âsix-and-a-half feet tallâ, he âdined on raw squirrelsâ and he had a head âlike a skullâ.\n\nWhat is prejudice, after all? In this case, it doesnât have to do with race necessarilyâitâs more about how the children judge Boo, form a preconceived image of who he is, before they really know him.\n\nAnd this happens to other white characters tooânotably Walter Cunningham, a boy from a poor family who Aunt Alexandra straight up derides as âtrashâ. Even when invited to dinner by the Finches, he is dismissed by Scout as âjust a Cunninghamâ, and this is where Calpurnia steps in as the moral voice, chastising her for acting âhigh and mightyâ over this boy who she hardly knows.\n\nThe racial dimension of prejudice is impossible to ignore thoughâas Atticus says, âpeople have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury boxâ. The word âresentmentâ has special significance here in the context of the Great Depression (in which the novel was setâmore on this in a later section) but the general idea is clear: Black Americans like Tom Robinson were guilty, and therefore doomed, the minute they stepped into a court because the white jury inevitably bore prejudices against them.\n\nAt the end of the day, the panacea Lee presents for prejudice is empathy, the idea that only by truly understanding someone, âclimb[ing] into [their] skin and walk[ing] around in itâ, can we overcome our own prejudicesâsomething that the jury isnât quite able to do by the end of the novel.\n\nJustice in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nIn the second part of the novel, these moral questions around prejudice and empathy find an arena in the courtroom, where Tom has been unfairly charged with rape and is being defended by Atticus. The court of law is supposed to be this colour-blind, impartial site of dispute resolution, where anybody âought to get a square dealâ, but the reality we see in the novel falls dramatically short; Tom is indeed ultimately found guilty despite the evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe intersection of these themesârace, prejudice and justiceâforces us to confront the reality that our legal institutions may not be as colour-blind and impartial as we thought. As Atticus says in his closing statement, âa court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up.â However, what we see is that the people who make up a jury are not necessarily as sound as he/we would hopeâScout later recognises that the true trial occurs in the âsecret courts of men's heartsâ, and that racist biases were always going to get in the way of a fair verdict.\n\nHeroism and Courage in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nAll of that sounds pretty dire, so is the novel then purely pessimistic? Weâre going to complicate this a little here, and then (spoiler) a little more in the âPast the Basics (II)â section, but letâs say for now that even though the outcome may be cause for pessimism, the novel is not so pessimistic on the whole.\n\nThis is because of one central moral that stands out from all of Atticusâ other teachings, and that strings the entire story together, namely the idea that courage doesnât have any one single shape or form, that anybody can be courageous.\n\nIn Part One, we find an unlikely hero in Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, who the children describe as âplain hellââwhen Jem takes out her flowers, Atticus makes him read to her as punishment. Only when she dies is it revealed that she was a morphine addict who had been trying to cut the habit in her last days, which Atticus sees as extremely brave: â[Real courage is] when you know you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.â For all we know, this couldâve been about himselfâ¦\n\nAnother example of Atticus switching up what it means to be heroic is in the way he puts down Tim Johnson. Donât stress if you forgot who that isâTim is the rabid dog. Jem is blown away by his fatherâs marksmanship, which he had never actually witnessed. Atticus transforms this into yet another lesson about courage: \"I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand.\"\n\nWhat we see here is Lee trying to broaden the readerâs imagination of what a hero could be, or what courage could look like, and all of this momentum eventually builds to the trial in Part Two. Even Tim Johnsonâs name calls to mind parallels with Tom Robinsonâs legal battle, in which Atticus heroically takes up the huge responsibility of protecting the innocent, and in spite of his best efforts, both times he fails.\n\nYet maybe both times he knew it would be inevitableâcourage is âknow[ing] youâre licked before you beginâ, right? Â\n\nFatherhood vs Adolescence in To Kill A Mockingbird\n\nThis knowledge seems to be one of those unfortunate things that comes with age and life experience. While Atticus already understands this, it doesnât quite click for his children until the end of the novel. Jem is particularly shaken by the guilty verdict: âIt ainât rightâ, he cries.\n\nThe novel is sometimes referred to as a bildungsroman for this reason: at its core, itâs a coming-of-age story. Jem may have been really idealistic about law and justice and the court system, but this is the first time in his life that he has had to grapple with the reality that all these institutions might be flawed, and that his dad is a hero not because he always wins, but because heâs willing to get into the fight even when he knows he might lose. Even though these messages came through all across the novel, Jemâs personal investment in the Robinson trial brings it all together for him.\n\nThus, on the one hand, you have this disillusionment and loss on innocence, but on the other, you also have this shift in worldview that may well be valuable in the long run.\n\nItâs also worth noting that Jem isnât the only character who experiences this thoughâand also that heroism isnât the only theme that is affected. Scout experiences similar disappointments, and they both grapple with other questions of conscience, tolerance and conformity throughout the novel.\n\nPast the basics: Narrative Structure\n\nIâve hinted to this briefly throughout the themes, but the two-part structure of the novel plays a key role in delivering the key moral messages. While Part One isnât necessarily the story youâd expect (given that itâs very long and almost completely not about the trial itself), many of the characters and their interactions with Jem, Scout and Dill are incredibly meaningful. (Walter Cunningham and Mrs. Dubose are covered above, but try to form some of these connections yourself).\n\nBoo Radley is the key character who connects the two parts of the story. He spends much of the first part in hiding, occasionally leaving gifts for the kids in a tree (chapter 7), or giving them a blanket during a fire (chapter 8). However, heâs also victim to their prejudice and their gossipâthey donât see him as a person, but rather as an enigma whom they can harass and talk about at will. In the second part however, he emerges to save Jem from Bob Ewell and is actually a rather unassuming man. Here, Scout and Jem must reckon with the moral lessons theyâve been taught about prejudice, but also about innocence and courage. Itâs through these interactions as well that they come closer to understanding Atticus, and his brave quest to defend the innocent. In many ways, the first part of the novel sets up and drives these ideas home.\n\nPast the basics: Critical Racial Analysis\n\nAs foreshadowed, weâre going to complicate the heroism element of the novel here, and Iâll start with a quote from a New York Times review: âI donât need to read about a young white girl understanding the perniciousness of racism to actually understand the perniciousness of racism. I have ample firsthand experience.â\n\nSo is there an issue when a story of Black injustice only elevates white people as heroes? Not to say that Atticus canât be heroic, but what does it say that heâs the brave, stoic hero in a story about a Black manâs unjust suffering?\n\nI think to best understand these complexities, itâs worth situating the story in its historical context.\n\n1930s: Great Depression; when the novel is set. Economy had collapsed and masses were unemployed; with slavery abolished, Black people were competing with white people for labour, fuelling resentment. Harper Lee grew up in this time, so there are autobiographical elements to the novel.\n\n1960s: Civil Rights Movement; when the novel is published. For the first time in history, Black heroes were capturing national white attention and shifting the needle drastically towards racial justice. It was in this watershed wave of activism and social change that people read this book for the first time, and it was received as a deeply authentic voice within this movement.\n\n2010s: Present day; when the novel is currently being read. Weâre closer towards achieving racial justice now, but weâre also in a world where more and more young people are cognisant of these issues. While the novelâs image on the surface (of white kids being blown away by the existence of racism) is fading in relevance, there are underlying messages that are still relevant: racism and prejudice is inevitable, and can occur across and within racial lines; courage and heroism can take many forms (consider how Black charactersâsuch as Calpurniaâalso act in heroic ways); and the experiences of young people, whether experiencing racism firsthand or witnessing its divisive impact, undoubtedly shape their values and morals as they enter the adult world.\n\nIf the same story was published today, it probably wouldnât have the same impact, but think about what kinds of messages endure anyway, beneath the surface story.\n\nEssay Prompt Breakdown\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird argues that empathy is courageous. Discuss.\n\nWhich brings us to a topic that is a bit knottier than it might first seem. Although empathy is shown to be courageous, particularly in the context of its setting, part of the novelâs message is also that courage can be fluid. This means that you might agree for a paragraph or two, emphasising the importance of context, before expanding on this idea of courage in the third.\n\nParagraph One: empathy can be a courageous trait in divisive times. Atticus says from early on that itâs important to âclimb in [someoneâs] skin and walk around in itâ in order to better understand them. He initially says this about Walter Cunningham, but itâs a message that finds relevance all throughoutâwhich occurs in parallel, of course, with his other lessons about courage, and how it can take different forms (as in Mrs. Dubose). Understood together, Lee suggests that empathy can in itself be a form of courage.\n\nParagraph Two: weâve blended two themes together in the previous paragraph, but letâs bring in some context here. Empathy only stands out as being particularly courageous because of the historical milieu, in which people were not only racist, but allowed racist resentments to surface in the economic struggle of the Depression. In fact, these âresentments [were carried] right into a jury boxâ where people failed to display the very courage that Atticus consistently espouses.\n\nParagraph Three: that said, even if empathy is courageous, courage can take on many forms beyond just empathy. Consider Scout backing away from a fight with Cecil Jacobs (âI felt extremely nobleââand rightfully so) or the resilience of the First Purchase congregation in using their service to raise money âto help [Helen Robinson] out at homeâ. That these characters, Black and white, can hold their heads high and do the right thing in difficult times is also courageous.\n\nHave a go\n\nIn your opinion, what is the most central and relevant message from To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nWhat is the role of innocence in To Kill a Mockingbird?\n\nLee argues that legal institutions are fraught with human biasâis this true?\n\nIn To Kill a Mockingbird, who pays the price for racism, and what do they lose?\n\nChallenge: In To Kill a Mockingbird, how are isolation and loneliness different, and what is Lee suggesting about society in this regard?\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird Essay Prompt Breakdown Video\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nSomething that I want you to take away from this video is being able to develop a contention statement that is a complete, solid foundation for your essay. A lot of the time when I ask students what theyâre trying to say in a specific section of their essay, they canât really explain it, theyâre just trying to put relevant evidence down. Ideally, itâs worth bearing in mind when you plan that you should be able to follow your logic back to the contention at any given point, even if youâre not that confident with the topic, and even if it wasnât the topic youâre quite prepared for.\n\nThe topic weâll be looking at is:\n\nTo Kill A Mockingbird is a story of courage. Discuss.\n\nSo âcourageâ is the key word here, and the way we define it will shape our entire discussion. It generally means bravery and fearlessness, but what kinds of courage are explored in the novel? It could be anything from courage to do the ârightâ thing, or courage to tell the truth, or courage to treat people with dignity even when you donât know if theyâll treat you the same way.\n\nImmediately, we can see that this is a theme-based prompt. To learn more about LSG's incredible Five Types Technique and how it can revolutionise how you approach VCE Text Response essays, have a read of this blog post.\n\nFor a prompt like this, you start building your contention based on these definitions, and this is handy if youâre better prepared for another theme. Letâs say youâre better prepped to write an essay on discrimination...\n\nYou could contend that the novel is indeed about courage, as Atticus not only teaches it to his children but also applies it to his defence of Tom Robinson in the face of structural racism. However, courage is also linked more broadly to empathy, which is explored as a panacea for discrimination. A complete contention like this breaks up your points neatly, but also grounds everything you have to say in an essay that still addresses the question and the idea of courage.\n\nFor example, paragraph one would start by looking at the forms of courage he teaches to his children. Part One, the more moralistic and didactic section of the novel ends with the idea that âreal courageâ isnât âa man with a gunâ but rather âwhen you know you're licked before you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what.â The section is characterised by these lessons of âreal courageââwhile Atticus âOne-Shotâ Finch downplays his marksmanship, he focuses the childrenâs moral instruction on characters such as Mrs Dubose, who he admires as courageous for fighting her morphine addiction.\n\nThe next paragraph would look at Atticusâ actions and also the trial in a bit more detail, as he embodies this idea that real courage exists outside of physical daring. In the racist milieu of the Deep South at the time, juries rarely âdecide in favour of a coloured man over a white man.â Yet, Atticus is determined to defend Tom even at the steep cost of his own personal honour or reputation. Not only does he teach his children about the importance of courage, but he goes on to exemplify those very lessons himself. Courage in this case reflects his commitment to the truth and to defending the innocentââthis boyâs not going till the truth is told.â\n\nHowever, in the final paragraph we might take a bit of a turn. Atticus, in having the courage to see Tom as an equal, is probably reflecting another very important value in the novelânamely, empathy. Though he admires Mrs. Dubose for her âreal courageâ, the white camellia he gives to Jem represents the goodness he sees within her despite her discriminatory attitudes. Though Jem struggles to empathise with the âold devilâ, Atticus posits that it takes a degree of courage to be the bigger person and see the best in others, rather than repeating cycles of discrimination and prejudice. The idea of empathy as a form of courage is also reflected in what he teaches them about Boo Radley. When Scout is terrified by the idea that he had given her a blanket without her realising, she ânearly threw upââyet Atticus maintains the importance of empathising with people, âclimb[ing] into another manâs shoes and walk[ing] around in itâ rather than ostracising them. In other words, he sees empathy as a form of courage in being the first to break social stigmas and overcome the various forms of discrimination that separate us.\n\nNow to touch base again with the take away message. We contended that the novel is about courage because Atticus teaches it to Scout and Jem while also representing it in the trial. We also contended that courage is linked to empathy, another key value that he imparts as it helps to overcome social barriers like discrimination. The aim was to build an essay on a contention that clearly props up the body of the essay itself, even when we were more confident with some other themes, and I think this plan does a pretty good job of covering that.\n\nFalse Claims of Colonial Thieves is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nWhy Is Context Important?\n\nWhen studying a text, it is very important to comprehend its context. Context will help you to understand what the text is about and what the authorâs point of view is - key components of doing well in VCE English! Context is especially important for False Claims of Colonial Thieves because the authors frequently reference Australiaâs history. Even the title is a nod to its context - it is all about the âfalse claimsâ made by Australiaâs âcolonial thievesâ, or in other words, Australiaâs colonial settlers. Understanding what these false claims are will help you better understand the context and therefore, do significantly better in your English essays and assessments.\n\nTreat this blog as a starting point only. There is so much to learn about these topics, and I recommend you do your own research in addition to reading this blog. To help you do so, I have provided a reliable external source for each topic, so you can start exploring these claims in more depth.\n\nTerra Nullius\n\nOne of the biggest âfalse claimsâ that Papertalk Green and Kinsella refer to throughout their collaboration is the colonisersâ claim of Australia being terra nullius. When the British came to Australia, they claimed that the country was âno manâs landâ, denying that the Indigenous Australians had actually lived here for thousands of years. By pretending that no one lived in Australia, this supposedly gave the British âlegitimacyâ to assume control over the land and those already living on it - i.e. Australiaâs First Nations Peoples.\n\nTerra Nullius was used against the Indigenous peoples for many years to justify their horrific treatment. The principle was only overturned in 1992 when an Indigenous man, Eddie Mabo, challenged this claim in the High Court of Australia. Nowadays, we recognise that the Indigenous people were here significantly earlier than the colonisers and that their sovereignty (i.e. their power over the land) was never ceded.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://australian.museum/learn/first-nations/unsettled/recognising-invasions/terra-nullius/Â\n\nThe Stolen Generation\n\nAnother false claim was that the Indigenous people were inferior to white people. This claim led to the forcible removal of Indigenous children from their families, so they could be raised by âsuperiorâ white people and taught white cultures/languages - these children are referred to as the âStolen Generationâ because they were taken away from their families without their consent.\n\nIt was thought that placing Aboriginal children (especially mixed-race Aboriginal children) with white families would make it easier to teach Aboriginal children the âproperâ (British) way of living. They were either placed in institutions or adopted by white families, and often faced terrible treatment, including violence, neglect and assault. Neither the children who were removed nor their families have fully recovered from this appalling policy that continued until the 1970s.\n\nIndeed, the effects of the Stolen Generation can still be felt today. One of the major consequences discussed by Papertalk Green and Kinsella is that a lot of Indigenous culture was lost. Many of the children who were taken away were forbidden from practising their cultural traditions or from speaking their Indigenous languages. This ban led to many traditions going extinct and is a tragic effect of this heinous false claim.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/stolen-generationsÂ\n\nMissions and ReservesÂ\n\nAnother claim explored in the text is the idea that Indigenous peoples could not look after themselves and would be better off with white people âprotectingâ them. This led to the government forcing Aboriginal people to leave their ancestral lands and relocate to newer, smaller areas - a process known as land alienation. There were two types of this land - missions and reserves - and Aboriginal people faced poor treatment on both.\n\nMissions were usually run by Christian groups so they could convert the Indigenous people to their religion. There was a strong degree of control exercised over these Indigenous people, who were expected to learn the skills required for menial jobs (such as cooking and cleaning). Contrastingly, those living on reserves were not typically subject to as much control. These people were sometimes provided with rations from the government, but there were not usually officials to oversee them.\n\nBoth missions and reserves are referred to in False Claims of Colonial Thieves, so it is important to understand the difference between the two.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/missions-stations-and-reservesÂ\n\nNow that weâve examined some of the more historical context, letâs take a closer look at the contemporary and modern background that Kinsella and Papertalk Green write about.\n\nClose the Gap Campaign and Black Deaths in Custody\n\nA key section of the text (particularly the latter third) explores current issues which Indigenous peoples face today. Two of these major concerns lie within the health and justice systems, so it is important to understand why Kinsella and Papertalk Green focus so heavily on these matters.\n\nThe Close the Gap Campaign (launched in 2007) aims to reduce the inequality in health and education that many Indigenous peoples face. It was created because the life expectancy is much lower for Indigenous than non-Indigenous peoples, and there is a significant difference between their expected levels of education. Unfortunately, many of these concerns have not been addressed today, and Papertalk Green discusses how her family is constantly dealing with death - a key theme in False Claims of Colonial Thieves that can be explained by this contextual understanding.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.pmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/reports/closing-the-gap-2018/executive-summary.htmlÂ\n\nSimilarly, there are a lot of concerns with the number of Aboriginal people in prison, and how many of them die while in police custody. There was even a Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody (i.e. a governmental inquiry) handed down in 1987, however, many of its recommendations have not been implemented to this day. This idea of unfair policing and laws that target Indigenous peoples is a key idea in the text, and Kinsella dedicates a poem to Ms Dhu, an Indigenous woman killed while in custody.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/09/the-facts-about-australias-rising-toll-of-indigenous-deaths-in-custodyÂ\n\nMining\n\nA key theme of False Claims of Colonial Thieves is mining, which refers to the practice of removing valuable materials from the Earth. Many of these resources are found on traditional Aboriginal lands, which are destroyed by the mining process. This is especially offensive to many Indigenous groups because many Indigenous cultures have a strong spiritual connection to their land (often known as Country). There is consequently a lot of tension between the Indigenous populations and governments, especially in Western Australia, where both of the authors live.\n\nExternal source for further reading: https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/uranium/report/d07Â\n\nHow Can You Use This in Your Essays?\n\nUnderstanding a textâs context is very important in being able to analyse the text in appropriate depth.\n\nFor example, knowing that mining is often considered harmful to the lands to which Indigenous peoples have a strong connection, will allow you to discuss this concept in your essays. Indeed, Papertalk Green argues that mining is just as harmful to Indigenous peoples as earlier âfalse claimsâ were, which is a sophisticated idea for you to use in your assessments.\n\nAs you begin to better understand and incorporate context into your essays, you can then take things one step further by examining how the author has used context as a means of demonstrating their authorial intent. For example, the effects of the Stolen Generation have been explored in several poems, and a possible viewpoint is that the Stolen Generation was used to demonstrate the devastating loss of Indigenous cultures and traditions.\n\nâThe Complete Maus by Art Spiegelman is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nThemes\n\nAnalysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that depicts the story of Vladek Spiegelman, a Polish Jewish Holocaust survivor who experienced living in the ghettos and concentration camps during the Nazi regime. Vladekâs son, Art has transformed his story into a comic book through his interviews and encounters which interweaves with Artâs own struggles as the son of a Holocaust survivor, as well as the complex and difficult relationship with his father.\n\n2. ThemesÂ\n\nSurvivalÂ\n\nSurvival is a key theme that is explored during Vladekâs experience in concentration camps and his post-Holocaust life.Â\n\nFor example, Vladek reflects that âYou have to struggle for lifeâ and a means of survival was through learning to be resourceful at the concentration camps.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nResourcefulness is depicted through the physical items Vladek keeps or acquires, as well as through Vladekâs skills. For example, Vladek explains to Art that he was able to exploit his work constantly through undertaking the roles of a translator and a shoemaker in order to access extra food and clothing by being specially treated by the Polish Kapo.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nHe even wins over Anjaâs Kapo to ensure that she would be treated well by not being forced to carry heavy objects. Vladekâs constant recounts and reflections symbolise survival, as Vladek was willing and able to use his skill set to navigate through the campâs work system.\n\nDuring the concentration camps, food and clothes also became a currency due to its scarcity and Vladek was insistent on being frugal and resourceful, which meant that he was able to buy Anjaâs release from the Birkenau camp.\n\nâGuilt\n\nAlthough survival is a key theme, the graphic novel explores how Holocaust survivors in The Complete Maus grapple with their deep psychological scars.Â\n\nMany of those who survived the war suffered from depression and was burdened with âsurvivorâs guiltâ. This can be seen through the character of Artâs mother, Anja, as 20 years after surviving the death camps, she commits suicide. After having lost so many of her friends, and families, she struggled to find a reason as to why she survived but others didnât. Throughout the graphic novel, her depression is apparent. In a close-up shot, Anja appears harrowed and says that âI just donât want to liveâ, lying on a striped sofa to convey a feeling of hopelessness as if she was in prison. Her ears are additionally drawn as drooped, with her hands positioned as if she was in prison in the context is that she must go to a sanatorium for her depression.\n\nIt is not only Anjaâs guilt that is depicted, but also Art himself who feels partly responsible. Art feels that people think it is his fault as he says that âThey think itâs MY fault!â and in one panel, Art is depicted behind bars and that â[He] has committed the perfect crimeâ to illustrate that he feels a sense of guilt in that he never really was the perfect son. He believes he is partly responsible for her death, due to him neglecting their relationship. Spiegelman also gives insight to readers of a memory of his mother where she asks if he still loves her, he responds with a dismissive âsureâ which is a painful reminder of this disregard.Â\n\nIntergenerational Gap\n\nArt constantly ponders how he is supposed to âmake any sense out of Auschwitzâ if he âcanât even make any sense out of [his] relationship with [his] fatherâ. As a child of Jewish refugees, Art has not had the same first-hand horrific experiences as his parents and in many instances struggles to relate to Vladekâs stubborn and resourceful tendencies. Art reflects on this whilst talking to Mala about when he would not finish everything his mother served, he would âargue til I ran to my room cryingâ. This emphasises how he didnât understand wastage or frugality even from a very young age, unlike Vladek.\n\nSpiegelman also conveys to readers his sense of frustration with Vladek where he feels like he is being treated like a child, not as an adult. For example, Art is shocked that Vladek would throw out one of Artâs coats and instead buy a new coat, despite Vladekâs hoarding because he is reluctant and feels shameful to let his son wear his âold shabby coatâ. This act could be conveyed to readers that Vladek is trying to give Art a life he never had and is reluctant to let his son wear clothes that are âinappropriateâ in his eyes. However, from Artâs perspective, he âjust canât believe itâ and does not comprehend his behaviour.\n\nSince we're talking about themes, we've broken down a theme-based essay prompt (one of five types of essay prompts) for you in this video:\n\n3. Analysing Techniques in Visual Texts\n\nThe Complete Maus is a graphic novel that may seem daunting to analyse compared to a traditional novel. However, with countless panels throughout the book, you have the freedom to interpret certain visuals so long as you give reasoning and justification, guiding the teacher or examiner on what you think these visuals mean. Here are some suggested tips:\n\nFocus on the Depiction of Characters\n\nSpiegelman may have purposely drawn the eyes of the Jewish mice as visible in contrast to the unapparent eyes of the Nazis to humanise and dehumanise characters. By allowing readers to see the eyes of Jewish mice, readers can see the expressions and feelings of the character such as anger and determination. Effectively, we can see them as human characters through their eyes. The Nazisâ eyes, on the other hand, are shaded by their helmets to signify how their humanity has been corrupted by the role they fulfill in the Holocaust.\n\nâ\n\nWhen the readers see their eyes, they appear sinister, with little slits of light. By analysing the depictions and expressions of characters, readers can deduce how these characters are intended to be seen.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nâ\n\nââ\n\nLook at the Background in Each Panel\n\nThroughout the graphic novel, symbols of the Holocaust appear consistently in the background. In one panel, Artâs parents, Anja and Vladek have nowhere to go, a large Swastika looms over them to represent that their lives were dominated by the Holocaust.\n\nEven in Artâs life, a panel depicts him as working on his desk with dead bodies surrounding him and piling up to convey to the reader that the Holocaust still haunts him to this day, and feels a sense of guilt at achieving fame and success at their expense.\n\nThus, the constant representation of symbols from the Holocaust in Spiegelmanâs life and his parentsâ past in the panelsâ background highlights how inescapable the Holocaust is emotionally and psychologically.Â\n\nSize of Panels\n\nSome of the panels in the graphic novel are of different sizes which Spiegelman may have intended to emphasise the significance of certain turning points, crises or feelings. For example, on page 34, there is a disproportionate panel of Vladek and Anja passing a town, seeing the first signs of the Nazi regime compared to the following panels. All the mice seem curious and concerned, peering at the Nazi flag behind them. This panel is significant as it marks the beginning of a tragic regime that would dominate for the rest of their lives.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to how some panels have a tendency to overlap with each other which could suggest a link between events, words or feelings.\n\nAlthough not specifically targeted at Text Response, 10 Things to Look for in Cartoons is definitely worth a read for any student studying a graphic novel!\n\nContents\n\nSummary\n\nThemes\n\nSymbols and Analysis\n\nQuotes\n\nDiscussion Questions\n\nSample Essay Topics\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\n1. Summary\n\nGo Went Gone revolves around an unlikely connection between a retired universityÂ professor, Richard, and a group of asylum seekers who come from all over the African continent. While heâs enjoyed a life of stability and privilege as a white male citizen, the lives of these asylum seekers could not be more different: no matter where they are in the world, uncertainty seems to follow. Richard initially sets out to learn their stories, but he is very quickly drawn into their histories of tragedy, as well as their dreams for the future.Â\n\nHowever, the more he tries to help them, the more he realises what heâs up against: a potent mix of stringent legal bureaucracy and the ignorance of his peers. These obstacles are richly interwoven with the novelâs context in post-reunification Germany (more on this under Symbols: Borders), but bureaucracy and ignorance are everywhere - Australia included. This novel, therefore, bears reflection on our own relationship with the refugees who seek protection and opportunity on our shores - refugees who are virtually imprisoned and cut off from the world.\n\nRichard ultimately realises that these men are simply people, people who have the same complexities and inconsistencies as anyone else. They sometimes betray his trust; at other times, they help him in return despite their socio-economic standing. The end of the novel is thus neither perfect nor whole - while the asylum seekers develop a relationship with Richard and vice versa, neither is able to entirely solve the otherâs problems, though both learn how to be there for each other in their own ways. We donât get many solutions to everything the refugees are facing, but what we end up with is a lesson or two in human empathy.Â\n\nThe title of Jenny Erpenbeckâs novel Go Went Gone is a line she weaves into a couple of scenes. In one example, a group of asylum seekers in a repurposed nursing home learn to conjugate the verb in German. In another, a retired university professor reflects on this group, about to be relocated to another facility.\n\n2. Themes\n\nPrivilege\n\nThe various privileges Richard holds shape his identity in this text. It shapes how he approaches his retirement for example: now that âhe has timeâ, he plans to spend it on highbrow pursuits like reading Proust and Dostoyevsky or listening to classical music. On the other hand, the asylum seekers sleep most of the time: âif you donât sleep through half the morning, [a day] can be very long indeed.â Richard has the freedom to choose to spend his time on hobbies, but the asylum seekers face a daunting and seemingly-impossible array of tasks. After getting to know them more, he realises that while his to-do list includes menial things like âschedule repairman for dishwasherâ, the refugees face daunting socio-political problems like needing to âeradicate corruptionâ.Â\n\nFreedom in general is a useful way to think about privilege in this text, and besides freedom to choose how you spend your time, this can also look like the freedom to tell your story. While Richard helps the men with this to some degree, even he has a limited amount of power here (and power can be another useful way of thinking about privilege). Richard realises that âpeople with the freedom to chooseâ¦get to decide which stories to hold on toâ - and those are the people who get to decide the future of the refugees, at least from a legal perspective.Â\n\nEmpathy\n\nThough Richard canât necessarily help with these legal issues, he finds himself doing what he can for the refugees over time. He demonstrates a willingness to help them in quite substantial ways sometimes, for example buying a piece of land in Ghana for Karon and his family. In the end, we see him empathising with the refugees enough to offer them housing: though he is not a lawyer, he still finds ways to use his privilege for good and share what he can. He taps into his networks and finds housing for 147 refugees.Â\n\nThe tricky thing with empathy though is that itâs never one-sided, not in this book and not in real life either. Itâs not simply a case of Richard taking pity on the refugees - we might think of this as sympathy rather than empathy - but he develops complex, reciprocal and ârealâ friendships with all of them. This can challenge him, and us, and our assumptions about what is right. When Richard loses his wallet at the store, Rufu offers to pay for him. He initially insists he âcanât acceptâ, but when he does Rufu doesnât let him pay him back in full. Erpenbeck challenges us to empathise without dehumanising, condescending or assuming anything in the process.Â\n\nItâs an interesting way to think about social justice in general, particularly if you consider yourself an âallyâ of a marginalised group - how can we walk with people rather than speak for them and what they want?\n\nMovementÂ\n\nFreedom of movement is sort of a form of privilege, but movement as a theme of its own is substantial enough to need a separate section. There are lots of different forms of movement in the novel, in particular movement between countries. In particular, itâs what brought the refugees to Germany at all, even though they didnât necessarily have any control over that movement.\n\nContrast that with Richardâs friends, JÃ¶rg and Monika, who holiday in Italy and benefit from âfreedom of movement [as] the right to travelâ. Through this lens, we can see that this is really more of a luxury that the refugees simply do not have. Refugees experience something closer to forced displacement, rather than free travel, moving from one âtemporary placeâ to the next often outside of their control. In this process, their lack of control often means they lose themselves in the rough-and-tumble of it all: âBecoming foreign. To yourself and others. So thatâs what a transition looks like.â\n\n3. Symbols & Analysis\n\nLanguage and the Law\n\nMany of the barriers faced by the refugees are reflected in their relationships with language; that is, their experiences learning German mirrors and sheds light on their relationship with other elements of German society. For example, there are times when they struggle to concentrate on learning: âItâs difficult to learn a language if you donât know what itâs forâ. This struggle reflects and symbolises the broader problems of uncertainty, unemployment and powerlessness in the menâs lives.\n\nThe symbol of language often intersects with the symbol of the âiron lawâ, so these are discussed together here. Itâs hard on the one hand for these men to tell their stories in German, but itâs also hard for the German law to truly grapple with their stories. Indeed, Richard finds that the law doesnât care if there are wars going on abroad or not: it only cares about âjurisdictionâ, and about which country is technically responsible for the refugees. In this sense, the law mirrors and enables the callousness which runs through the halls of power - not to deter you from learning law if you want though! This might just be something to be aware of, and maybe something youâd want to change someday.Â\n\nThereâs one law mentioned in the novel stating that asylum seekers can simply be accepted âif a country, a government or a mayor so wishesâ, but that one word in particular - âifâ - puts all the power in lawyers and politicians who know the language and the law and how to navigate it all. These symbols thus reflect power and privilege.Â\n\nBorders (+ Historical Context)\n\nThroughout the novel, thereâs a sense that borders between countries are somewhat arbitrary things. They can âsuddenly become visibleâ and just as easily disappear; sometimes theyâre easy to cross, sometimes theyâre impossible to cross. Sometimes itâs easy physically, but harder in other ways - once you cross a border, you need housing, food, employment and so forth.\n\nThis complex understanding of borders draws on the history of Germany, and in particular of its capital Berlin, after World War II. After the war, Western powers (USA, UK, France) made a deal with the Soviet Union to each run half of Germany and half of Berlin. The Eastern half of Germany, and the Eastern half of Berlin, fell under Soviet control, and as East Germans started flocking to the West in search of better opportunities (sound familiar?), the Soviets built a wall around East Berlin. The Berlin Wall, built in 1961, became a border of its own, dividing a nation and a city and changing the citizenship of half of Germany overnight. Attempts to escape from the East continued for many years until the wall came down in 1989, changing all those citizenships right back, once again virtually overnight.\n\nThis history adds dimension to Erpenbeckâs novel. Refugees pass through many countries, but Erpenbeck draws on Germanyâs history specifically as a once-divided nation itself. This helps to illustrate that national borders are just another arbitrary technicality that divides people, at the expense of these refugees.Â\n\nBodies of Water\n\nOne motif that comes back a few times in the novel is the drowned man in the lake by Richardâs house. This has a few layers of meaning.\n\nFirstly, the man drowns despite the lake being a perfectly âplacidâ body of water, and for whatever reason, this bothers Richard immensely: âhe canât avoid seeing the lakeâ. Thereâs an interesting contrast here to be drawn between this one death in a still body of water and the hundreds of deaths at sea that are recounted in the novel. Rashidâs stories are particularly confronting: âUnder the water I saw all the corpsesâ. Erpenbeck questions the limits of human empathy - whose deaths are we more affected by, and why - through contrasting these different bodies of water, and those who die within them. Richard is more affected than most, who visit the lake all summer leaving âjust as happy as they cameâ - but even he has his limits with how much he can see and understand.Â\n\nThe next layer of meaning with this symbol then is more around the surface of the water itself: it is significant that in Rashidâs story, the casualties are below the surface. This reflects the common saying, âthe tip of the icebergâ - the survivors who make it to Europe are really just the tip of the iceberg, only representing a fraction of the refugee experience. Often, that experience ends in death. Erpenbeck asks us to keep looking beneath the surface in order to empathise in full.Â\n\nMusic and the Piano\n\nThis symbol is specific to Richardâs relationship with Osarobo, to whom he teaches the piano. Thereâs one scene where this symbolism is particularly powerful, where they watch videos of pianists âus[ing] the black and white keys to tell stories that have nothing at all to do with the keysâ colours.â\n\nIt speaks to the power of music to bring people together, and also to the importance of storytelling in any form: Rosa Canales argues the keysâ colours, and the colour of the fingers playing them, âbecome irrelevant to the stories emanating from beneath themâ.\n\n4. Quotes\n\nLanguage\n\nâWhat languages can you speak?â\n\nâThe German language is my bridge into this countryâÂ\n\nâEmpty phrases signify politeness in a language which neither of them is at homeâÂ\n\nPrivilege\n\nâThe things youâve experienced become baggage you canât get rid of, while others - people with the freedom to choose - get to decide which stories to hold on toâ\n\nâHe hears Apolloâs voice saying: They give us money, but what I really want is work. He hears Tristanâs voice saying: Poco lavoro. He hears the voice of Osaboro, the piano player, saying: Yes, I want to work but it is not allowed. The refugeesâ protest has created half-time jobs for at least twelve Germans thus farâÂ\n\nBorders\n\nâNot so long ago, Richard thinks, this story of going abroad to find one's fortune was a German oneâ\n\nâIs it a rift between Black and White? Or Poor and Rich?âÂ\n\nâWhere can a person go when he doesn't know where to go?âÂ\n\n5. Discussion Questions\n\nHere are some questions to think about before diving into essay-writing. Thereâs no right or wrong answer to any of these, and most will draw on your own experiences or reflections anyway. You may want to write some answers down, and brainstorm links between your responses and the novel. These reflections could be particularly useful if youâre writing a creative response to the text, but theyâre also a really good way to get some personal perspective and apply the themes and lessons of this novel into your own life.\n\nWhere do you âsitâ in the world? What privileges do you have or lack? What can you do that others cannot, and what can others do that you cannot?\n\nThink about the times youâve travelled around the world - how many of those times were by choice? What might be the impact of moving across the world against your will?\n\nHow do you show empathy to others? How do you receive empathy from others? What is that relationship âsupposedâ to look like?\n\nWhat are some different names for where you live? How can you describe the same place in different languages or words? If youâre in Australia, what was your area called before 1788?\n\nHave you ever learned or spoken a language other than English? What language do you find easier to write, speak and think with? How might this impact someoneâs ability to participate in different parts of life (school, work, friendships etc.)?\n\n6.

This essay topic breakdown will focus on the THINK part of the strategy. If youâre unfamiliar with this strategy, then check it out in How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nWithin the THINK strategy, we have 3 steps, or ABC. These ABC components are:\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nIn what ways do the people Richard meets challenge his assumptions about the world?\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nThis prompt alludes to certain assumptions that Richard might make about the world. If itâs hard to think of these off the top of your head, consider where our assumptions about the world come from: maybe from our jobs, our families and friends or our past experiences. Maybe there are some assumptions youâve had in the past that youâve since noticed or challenged.Â\n\nThen it asks us how the people Richard meets challenges those assumptions. Thereâs no way to get out of this question without discussing the refugees, so this will inform our brainstorm.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nI think some of Richardâs assumptions at the beginning come from his status: being a professor emeritus makes you pretty elite, and he canât really empathise with the refugees because his experiences of life are so different. Part of the challenge with this prompt might be to break down what life experiences entail, and where those differences lie: particularly because itâs asking us âin what waysâ. These experiences could be with language, employment, or personal relationships just to name a few ideas.Â\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nBecause Richardâs life experiences are so vastly different, Iâd contend that his assumptions are challenged in basically every way. However, I also think that his interest in the refugees exists because he knows they can challenge his assumptions. I want to use the motif of water surfaces to tie this argument together, particularly in the topic sentences, and this could look as follows:\n\nParagraph 1: Richard realises that he only has a âsurface-levelâ appreciation of the refugeesâ life experiences.\n\nHe realises that he knows little about the African continent (âNigeria has a coast?â)Â\n\nHe suffers from a âpoverty of experienceâ which means he hasnât had to interact with this knowledge before\n\nHis renaming of the refugees (Apollo, Tristan etc.) suggests that he still needs his own frame of reference to understand their experiences\n\nHe learns about the hardships of migration through the tragic stories of those like Rashid\n\nParagraph 2: He also realises that he has a âsurface-levelâ understanding of migration in general.\n\nThis comes from the fact that he has never actually moved countries; heâs only been reclassified as an East German, and then again as a German. Neither happened because he wanted them to.\n\nOn the other hand, the refugees want to settle in Europe: they want the right to work and make a living - itâs just that the âiron lawâ acts as a major barrier. Their powerlessness is different from Richardâs.\n\nPart of migration is also learning the language, and Richard is initially quite ignorant about this: he observes that the Ethiopian German teacher âfor whatever reason speaks excellent Germanâ, not realising this is necessary for any migrant to survive in the new country.\n\nWe can think of this as the difference between migration and diaspora, the specific term for the dispersion of a people.\n\nParagraph 3: Richard is more open than most people to looking beneath the surface though, meaning that his assumptions are challenged partly because he is willing for them to be.\n\nThe symbol of the lake works well here to explain this: he is bothered by its still surface, and what lies underneath, while others arenât\n\nWe can also contrast this to characters like Monika and JÃ¶rg who remain quite ignorant the whole time: Richardâs views have departed from this throughout the course of the novel\n\nUltimately, the novel is about visibility: Richardâs incorrect assumptions mean that he isnât seeing reality, and his âresearch projectâ is all about making that reality visible.Â\n\nâGo Went Gone is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response.

So previously I've done a video where I talked about how to write a thousand word, a thousand, a thousand-worded essay, and one hour. And so that segues into this particular video where I'm talking about writing three essays in three hours. So if you haven't watched that video, then I'll pop it up in the comment. I'll pop it up in the card up above. I would recommend you go watch that first before you watch this, because pretty much all of the concepts that I talk about in that video, uh, I just expected details that you should know for this video. So instead of actually breaking down the essays as I did in the previous video, what I'm going to do this time is talk more so about, you know, how to actually write three essays in three hours and just not get burnt out and not die, basically.\n\nâ\n\nYeah, it's that serious. So I've got a few tips for you guys, but I'll keep this short. First thing is that yes, you do want to practice at least one time writing three essays in three hours. And the reason why I say that is because inevitably there will come times where one essay will kind of overlap into another hour. And you just want to ensure that you can know how to handle those situations when we're practicing in one hour blocks. I think it's fantastic to make sure that we can do that, but then kind of like three hours and three essays is another ballgame altogether. So I would recommend at least practicing once sitting down somewhere and just smashing out the three hours worth of work, just so that you know exactly what it's going to feel like when you go into the exam. Now, most schools will actually offer a, like a mock exam for you to do so that literally could be your one practice that you just need.\n\nBut if you were like me, you might want to do it twice. So in your own time, kind of print off your own exam paper and go ahead and just set aside three hours and just do it that way. The second thing is I heavily emphasized doing reading time. So reading time is pretty much your mental thinking game going strong. And this is where a lot of your pre-work will be done before we actually go into the essays themselves. So make sure you practice reading time. It's 15 minutes before the actual exam, but in that 15 minutes, you can plan three of your essays and you can look up in your dictionary, any key words that you might want to define, or you could even look up the dictionary and try to find synonyms for particular keywords. So what I mean by that is when you open up a dictionary and you look up that word inside the dictionary, often the definition for it will have synonyms for it.\n\nSo that's like my little hack that I had when I was at school. And then the last thing I would say is just make sure you know what to do if you go over time. So, like I mentioned before, there may be situations where, you know, worst case scenario, you don't finish your essay in time. And that could be because of many reasons. But first thing for you to remember is if you're running over time, sacrifice your conclusion first, do not sacrifice your third body paragraph. I think mostly what happens is students will kind of be somewhere in the third body paragraph for that essay, but rather than skipping that and just do it a little bit of a mess to finish it up and then going into the conclusion, finish off your third body paragraph. And then just forget about the conclusion. The reason why I say that is because a conclusion is basically just the summary of what your entire essay is about.\n\nIt's not really supposed to be, to add in any new information where as your third body paragraph. You're still explaining your ideas. You're still elaborating and discussing the prompt itself. So that is way more important to get you the marks that you need than a conclusion. The next thing I would do if you're running behind is save a proofreading until very last. So in the last video I talked about doing proofreading last five minutes of every essay. But if you do not have time for that later, leave all your proofreading until the very end and, and you might find that you only have five minutes, it's true proofread all of your essays, but at least you kind of have that reassurance was that you made yourself more time to write beforehand. And so if you literally find yourself writing right up until the last minute and you can't perforate fine sacrifice that too.\n\nâ\n\nNow last thing is, let's just say that you have sacrificed your conclusion and you're still writing your third body paragraph right up until the very last minute. You still have at least half a paragraph to go, but you know, the first hour is over and you need to move onto your second essay. I feel like you can either approach this two ways. The first way is just finish it off, but then move on to the next one as quick as possible. And obviously your hope there is that you will finish the second essay in time within that hour. So that by the time you get to your thing, essay, you are on track again. Right? But in the other alternative that you could do, and probably one that I via towards a little bit more is just stop your third paragraph. Okay? You still have maybe five more sentences you still want to write, but just move onto your next one. I think that's kind of important because what happens is once we start running into the next hour, you will find that with your first essay, you'll run maybe five minutes into your second hour, but then you might find that you run 10 minutes into the third hour with your second essay leaving only 15 minutes to finish your third essay. And that might not be like what you want. And you might know that you just won't be able to achieve that because the third essay is maybe the hardest one that you left to last. And that's the one that usually takes you the longest. So yeah, like these are just thoughts and considerations for you guys to take away with whatever you guys do. I think just be strategic. Think about these things beforehand, because they are things that could trip you up when you are in the exam, you're stressed, you're anxious, you're under time pressure and you just need to get things done.\n\nIt might kind of make you do like bad decisions o"
