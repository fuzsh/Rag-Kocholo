In the spring of 1930, Nguyen Ai Quoc chaired the conference to unite communist organizations into one party, named the Communist Party of Vietnam. The Communist Party of Vietnam was born as a tight combination of Marxist-Leninism with the workers' and the Vietnamese national movements. Since its establishment, the Party has always demonstrated itself as a genuine revolutionary party, bringing together the strength of the nation and classes, being the vanguard of the working class and the Vietnamese nation. The significant achievements of the Vietnamese revolution over the past 90 years have testified to the Party's resilience, intelligence, and leadership in the construction of a strong and advancing socialist Vietnam.

On the occasion of the 94th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist Party of Vietnam (03/02/1930-03/02/2024), the Library Center is honored to introduce to readers the book "The value of the work 'Some theoretical and practical issues on socialism and the path to socialism in Vietnam'" by General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, selected and compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Ho Chi Minh City Party Committee.

The book consists of 5 main parts:

Part 1: General theory

Part 2: Building the Party

Part 3: Building the rule of law socialist state in Vietnam

Part 4: Economy - Culture - Society - Human

Part 5: Defense - Security - Foreign Affairs - Struggle against erroneous, hostile views.

The articles closely follow the practical achievements of the country over more than 35 years of implementing the Renovation process, over 30 years of implementing the policy of building the country during the transition to socialism. They emphasize, "With all modesty, we can still be proud: Our country has never had the potential, resources, position, and international prestige as it does today." Along with that is a scientific analysis of prominent data, works, models, and the results achieved in all fields of Ho Chi Minh City to further clarify, "Vietnam is advancing to socialism from an agrarian and backward country, ignoring the capitalist regime, with very low production forces, going through decades of war with very heavy consequences; The hostile forces often try to sabotage, making it more difficult and complex, it is necessary to go through a long period of transition with many steps, many forms of organizing the economy and society intertwined, with a struggle between the old and the new." However, with the political determination of our Party, with the unanimous support of the people, the path to socialism in Vietnam is sure to be victorious, and the socialist society of Vietnam will become a reality in the not-too-distant future."

"Advancing to socialism is the aspiration of our people, the right choice of the Communist Party of Vietnam and President Ho Chi Minh, in line with the development trend of history." The book once again affirms that the path to socialism in Vietnam is inevitable, in line with the development trend of the times and the reality of the country, for the goal of "Rich people, strong country, democracy, justice, and civilization," and emphasizes that the leadership of the Party is the decisive factor for all the successes of the Vietnamese revolution.
