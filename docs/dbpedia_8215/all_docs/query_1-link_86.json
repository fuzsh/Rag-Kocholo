renewables, he said, asking the province to enhance capacity for climate change adaptation and environmental protection, improve investment climate, and make meticulous preparation for attracting

However, the enforcement of the law has shown several challenges due to limited human resources of the fishery sector and loose coordination between localities in informing authorities of violated fishing vessels.\n\nHoan said he has required the Directorate of Fisheries and the Vietnam Fisheries Surveillance Force exercise management based on marine spaces instead of locality and keep a close watch on the journey of fishing boats be they leave and land at port in any locality.\n\nWith a view to successfully removing the yellow card in the EC’s next inspection, Hoan stressed that the country must thoroughly deal with the three major issues, namely fishing vessels infringing on foreign waters, boats turning off their VMS device, and vessels without registration and fishing licences.\n\nHe called on localities to take drastic measures and mete out strict punishment to any violations.\n\n“Clamping down on IUU fishing is an initial step for Vietnam to restructure its fisheries, making the sector become more transparent, responsible and sustainable”, he said./.\n\nArgentine press features Vietnam’s victory on April 30, 1975\n\nThe Argentine press on April 26 ran articles highlighting the Victory of April 30, 1975 - the Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day of the Vietnamese people.\n\nThe ABC Mundial newspaper recalled that on that day 49 years ago, at 11:30, the flag of the liberation army flew on the roof of the Independence Palace, marking the complete collapse of the US imperialism and its puppet government in South Vietnam, as well as the complete victory of the Ho Chi Minh campaign.\n\nSince then, Vietnam has been determined to move forward on the path of national reconstruction and development, and has achieved impressive economic growth and opened its door to the world over the past recent decades.\n\nAlthough the scars of war remain, Vietnam is steadily building a prosperous future. Today, it is a key country in Southeast Asia, with a growing economy, expanding international relations and a resilient spirit that always inspires the world, wrote the newspaper.\n\nThe website of the Radio Argentina also published an article by journalist Gaston Fiorda about his feelings when interviewing Vietnamese veterans who participated in the general offensive in 1975, during his recent visit to Vietnam.\n\nAccording to Fiorda, who has researched Vietnamese history for many years, nearly 1 million soldiers, more than 2 million Vietnamese civilians and more than 58,000 American soldiers died in the war. However, the Vietnamese people have overcome hatred, strived to rise from the ruins of war, build a country of development, peace and extensive integration with the world./.\n\nVietnam, Germany eye stronger legal, judicial cooperation\n\nA working delegation from the Ministry of Justice led by Deputy Minister Mai Luong Khoi paid a working trip to Germany recently in the framework of Vietnam – Germany legal and judicial cooperation under the joint statement signed in 2008.\n\nAt a working session with the Federal Ministry of Justice, Khoi and Parliamentary State Secretary at the ministry Benjamin Strasser reviewed the cooperative activities between the legal and judicial partners of Vietnam and Germany under the cooperative programme during 2022-2025.\n\nRegarding the cooperative plan in 2024, the two ministries will join hands to roll out specific and effective activities, including enhancing capacity for legal officials, judicial training and digital transformation in the field.\n\nStrasser spoke highly of the achievements that both sides have attained, and said his ministry will continue coordination with the Vietnamese side to fully carry out cooperative activities in 2024, and work with the German Academic Exchange Service to support high-quality human resources training at the German Law Centre established at the Hanoi University of Law.\n\nMeanwhile, General Director of the German Foundation for International Legal Cooperation (IRZ) Alexandra Albert affirmed continued support for the Vietnamese ministry in learning international experience in relevant areas.\n\nDeputy Minister Khoi also had a meeting with Minister of Justice of Hessen State Christian Heinz, during which the two sides agreed to continue implementing their Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two ministries in November 2022.\n\nAt the event, experts from the German side shared experience in building and carrying out the state’s e-justice programme with the Vietnamese ministry.\n\nAt a working session with vice chairman of Hessen state parliament’s legal commission Frederick Bouffier, Khoi briefed the host on the cooperative results in the legal between Hessen and Vietnam.\n\nBouffier, for his part, affirmed legal cooperation is important, which contributed to the cooperation between the two countries.\n\nPresident of the World University Service of Germany Kambiz Ghawami suggested both sides organise workshops to share experience of German and Hessen state in law enforcement and digital transformation in legal and judicial fields as the two countries are celebrating their 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2025.\n\nDuring the trip, the Vietnamese Justice Ministry delegation also had working session with officials of the German Federal Chamber of Notaries (Bnotk), the Federal association of German, Mitte district court and Wiesbaden district court, the Vietnamese Embassy in Berlin and the General Consulate in Frankfurt./.\n\nHà Nội proposes allowing car parking on roadways, sidewalks, and under bridges\n\nThe Hà Nội Department of Transportation has proposed to the Government and the Ministry of Transport (MoT) to allow the city to continue utilising roadways, sidewalks, and under-bridge spaces for parking vehicles, particularly cars.\n\nThe city has witnessed a significant rise in the number of personal vehicles.\n\nIn 2023 alone, there were 6,000 newly registered cars, reflecting an average growth rate exceeding 5 per cent.\n\nDespite urban transportation land planning indicating that the static transportation area within the city should occupy 4 per cent of the urban land area, the current figure stands at only 0.6 per cent.\n\nHowever, due to unattractive investment conditions, the immediate establishment of a static transportation system to meet citizen needs was deemed infeasible, Nguyễn Phi Thường, director of the Hà Nội Department of Transportation, said at a recent conference on assessing traffic safety in the first quarter and outlining tasks for the second quarter.\n\nThe assessment of the situation concerning illegal and unregistered passenger coaches operating on fixed routes presented a challenge.\n\nThe director proposed that the MoT consider revisions to the draft Road Law, aimed at establishing a clear differentiation between various types of transportation to prevent transport entities and drivers from exploiting legal loopholes.\n\nHe also recommended the incorporation of new transportation modes to address public travel needs while maintaining traffic order and safety, safeguarding tax revenue, and protecting passengers' legitimate rights.\n\nHà Nội urged the MoT to advise the Government on tightening regulations for commercial passenger transport violations. Entities and individuals found repeatedly violating regulations would face revocation of their business licences.\n\nAccording to the report released by the Hà Nội Department of Transportation, the city witnessed 385 traffic accidents in the first quarter of this year, resulting in 175 fatalities and 313 injuries. Compared to the corresponding period in 2023, there was an increase of 106 cases in traffic accidents, with 16 additional fatalities and 130 more injuries.\n\nIn the first three months of 2024, the city transportation agency concentrated its efforts on addressing congestion, accident-prone locations, and potential accident sites.\n\nHealth ministry orders improvement of medical service quality, risk prevention\n\nThe health ministry has urged medical facilities to improve their management and quality to raise patient safety and satisfaction, as well as minimise risks of medical incidents.\n\nThe official document is issued following inspections on patient quality and service quality conducted by the Department of Medical Service Administration under the Ministry of Health (MoH).\n\nHospitals under the MoH, provincial and municipal health departments, ministries and universities are required to take measures and be responsible for improving quality and safety at their facilities, preventing and classifying incidents and conducting reports per Circular 43/2018/TT-BYT.\n\nThey should also review and identify safety concerns that can affect patients and medical workers and promptly address them.\n\nOther areas of focus include periodic reviews of technical procedures and standards, especially in classifying emergency cases, infection control as well as medication, equipment and supply management in emergency rooms, intensive care units and surgical departments.\n\nIdentified risks should be compiled into a mandatory incident reporting list for each facility, including the specifics for each medical speciality, procedure, department and unit function.\n\nIn the appendices to this list, the MoH requires that medical facilities accurately identify the patients to avoid confusion in providing services, prevent risks due to miscommunication, and regularly monitor medical records and consultation procedures as regulated.\n\nHealth facilities must also comply with principles on surgical safety and related checklists as specified in MoH Decision 7482/QĐ-BYT dated December 18, 2018.\n\nMedical facilities must also conduct training on patient safety and enhance medical staff’s sense of responsibility, including new recruits and interns, in medical incident and risk reporting.\n\nThey should also raise awareness for cooperation among patients and their caretakers regarding this matter.\n\nInspection and supervision must be strengthened for periodic compliance reports on regulations on medical incident prevention and patient safety. Inspectors and supervisors are responsible for reporting to the unit’s management level.\n\nIn case of a medical incident, managers of the unit must immediately act upon receiving reports and allocate people in charge to contact and calm the patients and their caretakers while proposing appropriate solutions to the issues.\n\nThey must also provide support to medical practitioners involved in the incidents, avoiding emotional influence and premature conclusions on individual oversight without taking into account systematic errors.\n\nThe MoH also issues a guideline to differentiate between medication errors (ME) and adverse drug reactions (ADR).\n\nReviews should be conducted to detect common medication-related incidents in each stage, such as prescription, distribution, use and during monitoring period.\n\nMekong Delta provinces launch solutions to combat drought, saltwater intrusion\n\nDespite possessing an intricate river system, people and agriculture in the Mekong Delta are facing severe drought and saltwater intrusion.\n\nKiên Giang and Cà Mau provinces are two coastal provinces severely affected by drought and salinity. Dry canals cause many traffic routes to collapse and separate. People's lives are turned upside down due to water shortages, traffic isolation and production stagnation.\n\nLê Trung Hậu, a farmer in Cà Mau Province's Trần Văn Thời District, said, \"saltwater intrusion has encroached deeply into the mainland causing my 10 hectares of rice ready to be harvested to die due to salinity. I lost about VNĐ200 million (US$8,000).”\n\nNot only that, about 10 days ago, due to prolonged extreme weather, many arterial roads in Khánh Hải Commune collapsed and became impassable, Hậu said.\n\nSimilarly, Trần Sáu, a farmer in Khánh Hải Commune, said traffic was cut off, making it impossible for traders to come and buy coconuts from him. \"If no traders come in to buy next week, thousands of my coconut trees will die due to saltwater intrusion.\"\n\nBesides facing salinity intrusion, people in Cà Mau also face the risk of lack of water for daily life and irrigation because the Government's salinity prevention sluice gates have been closed to limit the rate of saltwater intrusion, causing the water level in the canals to drop dramatically, and some canals have even dried out.\n\nCà Mau Province has more than 3,000 households lacking fresh water for daily use. People have to buy water from boats carrying water from other places.\n\nTo have water for daily use, people are completely dependent on water trucks from neighbouring provinces, even from city and provinces hundreds of kilometres away such as HCM City, Bình Dương and Tây Ninh.\n\nUnder the harsh sun, Lê Thị Hằng in Cà Mau Province patiently waited for more than an hour to fill two 30-litre cans of fresh water from water tankers from HCM City.\n\nHằng said that these days her family was completely dependent on water trucks from many provinces in the Southeast. Without these water trucks, she would not be able to find water.\n\nKhánh Hải Commune is considered an area heavily affected by landslides and subsidence. In this area alone, there have been more than 250 landslides and road collapses on more than 7.1km.\n\nPhạm Thành Được, Chairman of Khánh Hải Commune People's Committee, said, “the rice production area damaged by extreme weather has caused farmers in the area to lose up to VNĐ34 billion.”\n\nSimilar to Cà Mau, U Minh Thượng District in Kiên Giang is also facing a drought situation.\n\nLê Bảy, a farmer in U Minh Thượng District, said, “this year, severe drought and saltwater intrusion have caused many roads to collapse and trucks cannot come to buy agricultural products. Now when I want to sell bananas and other crops, I have to transport them by motorbike to the point of sale, which costs a lot.”\n\nPeople's incomes here depend on agricultural products, but now production is much more difficult and labour-intensive than before.\n\nAccording to Huỳnh Thanh Tuấn, Deputy Head of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of U Minh Thượng District, 7,000 hectares are planted with vegetables and fruit trees in An Minh Bắc and Minh Thuận communes, including about 3,000 hectares of bananas. All agricultural products are in harvest season.\n\nFarmers have to find ways to transport bananas and vegetables by motorbike to selling points as a temporary solution, but the costs are high and farmers suffer a lot of damage.\n\nSerious water shortages and saltwater intrusion encroaching deep into the mainland also occur in other provinces such as Tiền Giang, Long An, Bến Tre and Sóc Trăng.\n\nPhạm Tấn Đạo, head of Sóc Trăng Province's Irrigation sub-department, said that currently in the province, about 1,000 hectares of rice were affected by water shortages combined with alum poisoning.\n\nIn order for farmers to be able to sell agricultural products that have reached harvest season, Được said he was directing relevant agencies to coordinate with people to temporarily fix small landslides and subsidence points so that people could travel and reconnect trade.\n\nIn the long term, the locality would need support from the Provincial People's Committee and the central Government to overcome major landslides.\n\nPhan Hoàng Vũ, director of the Cà Mau Province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that the province had a plan to request emergency support of nearly VNĐ40 billion from the central Government to invest in water tanks and extend pipes, and repair water supply stations.\n\nFrom the emergency support fund, the province would allocate 758 water tanks to 1,344 households without water containers and establish 46 centralised water supply points. For nearly 1,000 households living near centralised water supply works but where water pipes are not accessible, the province would extend the pipes by about 83.5km so that people could have water to use, Vũ said.\n\nSimilarly, the Sóc Trăng provincial government will also extend water supply pipes to provide water to households in saltwater intrusion areas.\n\nMeanwhile, Dương Quốc Khởi, vice chairman of the People's Committee of U Minh Thượng District, said the locality was actively reviewing points at risk of landslides to promptly relocate and support people affected by landslides.\n\nTrần Văn Lâu, Chairman of the Sóc Trăng People's Committee, said that he had asked relevant departments and local leaders to focus on guiding people to use fresh water economically. When the salinity outside river mouths drops low, the province would urgently operate a water storage system to ensure supply for crops.\n\nBesides temporary solutions, Trần Ngọc Tam, deputy chairman of the Bến Tre Province People's Committee, also proposed the idea of bringing fresh water to the Mekong Delta from provinces and cities in the Southeast.\n\nAccording to Tam, water sources from Dầu Tiếng Lake, Sài Gòn River and Đồng Nai River are very abundant. The elevation of this river system is much higher than Bến Tre Province and many areas in the Mekong Delta, so channeling or installing a water pipeline system to the delta region is very convenient.\n\nVietnamese woman older than world’s oldest\n\nAccording to her personal papers, Nguyen Thi Co, who lives with her daughter in Cao Thang Commune, Thanh Mien District, Hai Duong Province, was born in 1901 and is now 123 years old.\n\nThis means that she is even older than Maria Branyas Morera, who was born in the United States in 1907 and is now living in Spain. Morera is being recognized by the Guinness World Records Book as the world’s oldest person who is still alive.\n\nNguyen Thi Hat, 72, Co’s daughter, told thanhnien.vn that her mother’s hearing ability is good, but her vision is poor, adding that seldom does she catch cold or flu. Co has a bowl of rice, porridge or soup every meal. Her teeth are almost intact, and her hair is still black regardless of her old age. As her limbs are weak, she lies in a hammock almost all day long.\n\nCo’s husband died in 1981 when he was over 80 years old. They had three daughters, but the eldest one died young; the second daughter, 76, was married and lived with her own family. Co is now living with Hat, her youngest daughter.\n\nModel construction works made of toothpicks\n\nHo Ngoc Quoc Si, who lives in Cao Lanh City, Dong Thap Province, has made model construction works of typical buildings and monuments of HCMC with millions of bamboo toothpicks over the past 15 years.\n\nSi told tuoitre.vn that his family formerly lived in HCMC. He often spent 6-8 hours a day making model construction works with toothpicks. Initially, he made small model works just for fun. Later, he shifted to making larger model construction works of HCMC like the Ho Chi Minh City Hall, the Reunification Palace, Nha Rong Wharf, Saint Paul churches (in District 10 and Binh Tan District), and Ben Thanh Market, of course with bamboo toothpicks.\n\nSi then made other model construction works, buildings and monuments such as President Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, One-pillar Pagoda, stilt houses of the Central Highlands, ancient three-arched gates, and even Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands, also with toothpicks.\n\nIt took Si over 13 months to make the model Ho Chi Minh City Hall with over one million bamboo toothpicks. His 12 model construction works are now displayed at a coffee shop in Cao Lanh City.\n\nBoat made of recycled materials used to clean up canals\n\nSaigon Xanh, a group of young volunteers dedicated to cleaning up polluted canals in HCMC, has crafted a boat from over 1,200 plastic bottles collected from the city’s waterways to aid in their river cleanup endeavor.\n\nIn an interview with the Saigon Tiep Thi news site, Nguyen Ngoc Luong, leader of Saigon Xanh, said, “The boat is designed to aid our team members in gathering trash from the deeper areas of canals and rivers, while also raising awareness about recycling. Discarded items can be recycled to serve various purposes in life and can contribute to reducing waste pollution.”\n\nMoored along the Nhieu Loc Canal, adjacent to the Dien Bien Phu Bridge in District 1, the boat grabs the attention of passersby and tourists alike. Its presence serves as a tangible reminder of the collective effort needed to safeguard the environment for future generations.\n\nLooking ahead, Saigon Xanh will collaborate with local partners to clean up the Nhieu Loc Canal. This endeavor is not only to enhance eco-tourism experiences there but also cultivate a deeper sense of environmental protection among citizens.\n\nCycling through three nations in scorching summer\n\nTran Trong An, 45, and four friends of his, all live in Hanoi, spent 16 days cycling to Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and back to Vietnam on the scorching summer days, sometimes as high as 45 degrees Celsius, in March this year.\n\nOn March 4, An and his friends traveled by coach from Hanoi to Lao Bao Border Gate in Quang Tri Province. They cycled some 300km from the border gate to Pakse City in Laos’ Champasak Province.\n\nThere, they ziplined to watch Tad Fane Waterfall and Khone Phapheng Falls before cycling to Cambodia via Stung Treng Border Crossing Station. They continued cycling to Siem Reap Province to visit the temple complex of Angkor Wat.\n\nThen they headed for Cambodia’s Poipet City and crossed the border to Thailand. They spent two days cycling around Bangkok to visit famous destinations of the capital city.\n\nFrom Bangkok, the cyclists returned to Hanoi by air, ending their 16-day, 1,000km cycling trip through three Southeast Asian nations. An told vnexpress.net that the cycling trip from Vietnam to Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and back to Vietnam cost them VND18 million each (equivalent to some US$720).\n\nSource: VNA/SGT/VNS/VOV/Dtinews/SGGP/VGP/Hanoitimes"
