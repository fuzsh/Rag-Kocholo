        "text": "Largest municipality in Vietnam, previously named Saigon\n\nThis article is about the city. For the Vietnamese communist leader, see Ho Chi Minh. For other uses, see Ho Chi Minh (disambiguation).\n\n\"Saigon\" and \"HCMC\" redirect here. For other uses, see Saigon (disambiguation) and HCMC (disambiguation).\n\nMunicipality in Vietnam\n\nHo Chi Minh City (HCMC; Vietnamese: Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh ⓘ), commonly known as Saigon (Vietnamese: Sài Gòn ⓘ), is the most populous city in Vietnam, with a population of around 10 million in 2023.[7] The city's geography is defined by rivers and canals, of which the eponymously-named Saigon River is the largest. As a municipality, Ho Chi Minh City consists of 16 urban districts, five rural districts, and one municipal city (sub-city). As the largest financial centre in Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City has the highest gross regional domestic product out of all Vietnam provinces and municipalities,[8] contributing around a quarter of the country's total GDP.[9] Ho Chi Minh City's metropolitan area is ASEAN's 6th largest economy, also the biggest outside an ASEAN country capital.\n\nSince ancient times, water transport has been heavily used by inhabitants in the area. The area was occupied by Champa from 2nd century AD to around the 19th century, due to Đại Việt's expansionist policy of Nam tiến. After the fall of Citadel of Gia Định, Saigon was the capital of French Indochina from 1887 to 1902, and again from 1945 until its cessation in 1954. Following the partition of French Indochina, it became the capital of South Vietnam until it was captured by North Vietnam, who renamed the city after their former leader Hồ Chí Minh, though the former name is still widely used in informal usages. Beginning in the 1990s, the city underwent rapid expansion and modernization, which contributed to Vietnam's post-war economic recovery and helped revive its international trade hub status.\n\nHo Chi Minh City has a long tradition of being a productive trading and manufacturing place in Vietnam. As such, the city is also the busiest international transport hub in Vietnam, as Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport accounts for nearly half of all international arrivals to Vietnam[10] and the Port of Saigon is among the busiest container ports in Southeast Asia.[11] Ho Chi Minh City is also a popular tourism destination. Some of the war and historic landmarks in the city include the Independence Palace, Landmark 81 (tallest building in Vietnam), the War Remnants Museum, and Bến Thành Market. The city is also known for its narrow walkable alleys and night life. Currently, Ho Chi Minh City is facing increasing threats of sea level rise and flooding as well as heavy strains on public infrastructures.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first known human habitation of the area was a Cham settlement called Baigaur.[nb 1] The Cambodians then took over the Cham village of Baigaur and renamed it Prey Nokor, a small fishing village.[12][13] Over time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was officially renamed Gia Định (嘉定) in 1698, a name that was retained until the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the name Sài Gòn, francized as Saïgon,[13] although the city was still indicated as 嘉定 on Vietnamese maps written in chữ Hán until at least 1891.[14]\n\nThe current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after reunification in 1976 to honour Ho Chi Minh.[nb 2] Even today, however, the informal name of Sài Gòn remains in daily speech. However, there is a technical difference between the two terms: Sài Gòn is commonly used to refer to the city centre in District 1 and the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers to all of its urban and rural districts.[13]\n\nSaigon\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original toponym behind Sài Gòn, was attested earliest as 柴棍, with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are sài and côn respectively, in Lê Quý Đôn's Phủ biên tạp lục (撫邊雜錄 \"Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier\", c. 1776), wherein Lê relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince Ang Nan was installed as uparaja in 柴棍 (Sài Gòn) by Vietnamese forces.\n\n柴棍 also appears later in Trịnh Hoài Đức's Gia Định thành thông chí (嘉定城通志 \"Comprehensive Records about the Gia Định Citadel\", c. 1820), Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư (南國地輿教科書 \"Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country\", 1908),[16] etc.\n\nAdrien Launay's Histoire de la Mission de Cochinchine (1688−1823), \"Documents Historiques II: 1728 - 1771\" (1924: 190) cites 1747 documents containing the toponyms: provincia Rai-gon, Rai-gon thong (for *Sài Gòn thượng \"Upper Saigon\"), & Rai-gon-ha (for *Sài Gòn hạ \"Lower Saigon\").\n\nIt is probably a transcription of Khmer ព្រៃនគរ (Prey Nokôr)[17][18][nb 3], or Khmer ព្រៃគរ (Prey Kôr).\n\nThe proposal that Sài Gòn is from non-Sino-Vietnamese reading of Chinese 堤岸 tai4 ngon6 (“embankment”, SV: đê ngạn)[nb 4], the Cantonese name of Chợ Lớn, (e.g. by Vương Hồng Sển) has been critiqued as folk-etymological, as: (1) the Vietnamese source Phủ biên tạp lục (albeit written in literary Chinese) was the earliest extant one containing the local toponym's transcription; (2) 堤岸 has variant form 提岸, thus suggesting that both were transcriptions of a local toponym and thus are cognates to, not originals of, Sài Gòn. Saigon is unlikely to be from 堤岸 since in 南國地輿教科書 Nam Quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư, it also lists Chợ Lớn as 𢄂𢀲 separate from 柴棍 Sài Gòn.\n\nHo Chi Minh City\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current official name, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, was first proclaimed in 1945, and later adopted in 1976. It is abbreviated as TP.HCM, and translated in English as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated as HCMC, and in French as Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated as HCMV. The name commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, 胡) with a given name meaning \"enlightened will\" (from Sino-Vietnamese, 志 明; Chí meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning \"light bringer\".[21] Nowadays, \"Sài Gòn\" is commonly used to refer to the city's central business districts, \"Prey Nokor City\" is well known in Khmer, whereas \"Hồ Chí Minh City\" is used to refer to the whole city.[22]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly settlement\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the location of the current Phụng Sơn Buddhist temple, founded in the 4th century AD.[23] A settlement called Baigaur was established on the site in the 11th century by the Champa.[23] Baigaur was renamed Prey Nokor after conquest by the Khmer Empire around 1145,[23] Prey Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and area of forest.[24]\n\nThe first Vietnamese people crossed the sea to explore this land completely without the organisation of the Nguyễn Lords. Thanks to the marriage between Princess Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn - daughter of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên - and the King of Cambodia Chey Chettha II in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move back and forth. In exchange, Chey Chettha II gifted Prei Nokor to the Nguyễn lords.[25] Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of Saigon, Đồng Nai. Before that, the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there, scattered from time immemorial.\n\nThe period from 1623 to 1698 is considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (Sài Gòn) and Kas Krobei (Bến Nghé). Although this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on the traffic routes between Vietnam, Cambodia, and Siam. The next two important events of this period were the establishment of the barracks and residence of Vice King Ang Non and the establishment of a palace at Tân Mỹ (near the present-day Cống Quỳnh–Nguyễn Trãi crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three government agencies.\n\nNguyễn dynasty rule\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1679, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Tần allowed a group of Chinese refugees from the Qing dynasty to settle in Mỹ Tho, Biên Hòa and Saigon to seek refuge. In 1698, Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of Huế by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement.[26][27] King Chey Chettha IV of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in 1700. In February 1700, he invaded Cambodia from An Giang. In March, the Vietnamese expedition under Cảnh and a Chinese general Trần Thượng Xuyên (Chen Shangchuan) defeated the main Cambodian army at Bích Đôi citadel, king Chey Chettha IV took flight while his nephew Ang Em surrendered to the invaders, as the Vietnamese marched onto and captured Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh.[28] As a result, Saigon and Long An were officially and securely obtained by the Nguyễn, more Vietnamese settlers moved into the new conquered lands.[28]\n\nIn 1788, Nguyễn Ánh captured the city, and used it as a centre of resistance against Tây Sơn.[29] Two years later, a large Vauban citadel called Gia Định, or Thành Bát Quái (\"Eight Diagrams\") was built by Victor Olivier de Puymanel, one of the Nguyễn Ánh's French mercenaries.[30] The citadel was captured by Lê Văn Khôi during his revolt of 1833–35 against Emperor Minh Mạng. Following the revolt, Minh Mạng ordered it to be dismantled, and a new citadel, called Phụng Thành, was built in 1836.[31] In 1859, the citadel was destroyed by the French following the Battle of Kỳ Hòa.[31] Initially called Gia Định, the Vietnamese city became Saigon in the 18th century.[23]\n\nFrench colonial era\n\n[edit]\n\nCeded to France by the 1862 Treaty of Saigon,[32] the city was planned by the French to transform into a large town for colonization. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, construction of various French-style buildings began, including a botanical garden, the Norodom Palace, Hotel Continental, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and Bến Thành Market, among many others.[33][34] In April 1865, Gia Định Báo was established in Saigon, becoming the first newspaper published in Vietnam.[35] During the French colonial era, Saigon became known as \"Pearl of the Orient\" (Hòn ngọc Viễn Đông),[36] or \"Paris of the Extreme Orient\".[37]\n\nOn 27 April 1931, a new région called Saigon–Cholon consisting of Saigon and Cholon was formed; the name Cholon was dropped after South Vietnam gained independence from France in 1955.[38] From about 256,000 in 1930,[39] Saigon's population rose to 1.2 million in 1950.[39]\n\nGallery of Saigon during the French colonial era\n\nThe Siege of Saigon in 1859 by Franco-Spanish forces.\n\nA street of Saigon around 1866.\n\nSaigon in 1867.\n\nMap of Saigon in 1881.\n\nFrench soldiers stationed at a barrack in Saigon in 1930.\n\nImperial Japanese soldiers entering Saigon in 1941, during World War II.\n\nSaigon afire after aerial attacks from carrier-based planes of the US Pacific Fleet in 1945.\n\nRepublic of Vietnam era\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1949, former Emperor Bảo Đại made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam with himself as head of state.[40] In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (Bến Hải River), with the communist Việt Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the southern half gained independence from France.[41] The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm in the 1955 referendum,[41] with Saigon as its capital.[42] On 22 October 1956, the city was given the official name, Đô Thành Sài Gòn (\"Capital City Saigon\").[43] After the decree of 27 March 1959 came into effect, Saigon was divided into eight districts and 41 wards.[43] In December 1966, two wards from old An Khánh Commune of Gia Định, were formed into District 1, then seceded shortly later to become District 9.[44] In July 1969, District 10 and District 11 were founded, and by 1975, the city's area consisted of eleven districts, Gia Định, Củ Chi District (Hậu Nghĩa), and Phú Hòa District (Bình Dương).[44]\n\nSaigon served as the financial, industrial and transport centre of the Republic of Vietnam.[45] In the late 1950s, with the U.S. providing nearly $2 billion in aid to the Diệm regime, the country's economy grew rapidly under capitalism;[43] by 1960, over half of South Vietnam's factories were located in Saigon.[46] However, beginning in the 1960s, Saigon experienced economic downturn and high inflation, as it was completely dependent on U.S. aid and imports from other countries.[43] As a result of widespread urbanisation, with the population reaching 3.3 million by 1970, the city was described by the USAID as being turned \"into a huge slum\".[47] The city also suffered from \"prostitutes, drug addicts, corrupt officials, beggars, orphans, and Americans with money\", and according to Stanley Karnow, it was \"a black-market city in the largest sense of the word\".[42]\n\nOn 28 April 1955, the Vietnamese National Army launched an attack against Bình Xuyên military force in the city. The battle lasted until May, killing an estimated 500 people and leaving about 20,000 homeless.[42][48] Ngô Đình Diệm then later turned on other paramilitary groups in Saigon, including the Hòa Hảo Buddhist reform movement.[42] On 11 June 1963, Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức burned himself in the city, in protest of the Diệm regime. On 1 November of the same year, Diệm was assassinated in Saigon, in a successful coup by Dương Văn Minh.[42]\n\nDuring the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975, Saigon was captured, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam,[49] and the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army.[42]\n\nGallery of Saigon during the Republic of Vietnam era\n\nThe Independence Palace in 1967.

The average elevation is 5 m (16 ft) above sea level for the city centre and 16 m (52 ft) for the suburb areas.[55] It borders Tây Ninh Province and Bình Dương Province to the north, Đồng Nai Province and Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province to the east, Long An Province to the west, Tiền Giang Province and East Sea to the south with a coast 15 km (9 mi) long. The city covers an area of 2,095 km2 (809 sq mi) or 0.63% of the surface of Vietnam), extending up to Củ Chi District (12 mi or 19 km from the Cambodian border) and down to Cần Giờ on the Eastern Sea. The distance from the northernmost point (Phú Mỹ Hưng Commune, Củ Chi District) to the southernmost one (Long Hòa Commune, Cần Giờ District) is 102 km (63 mi), and from the easternmost point (Long Bình ward, District Nine) to the westernmost one (Bình Chánh Commune, Bình Chánh District) is 47 km (29 mi).[citation needed] Due to its location on the Mekong Delta, the city is fringed by tidal flats that have been heavily modified for agriculture.[56]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has a tropical climate, specifically tropical savanna (Aw), with a high average humidity of 78–82%.[57] The year is divided into two distinct seasons.[57] The rainy season, with an average rainfall of about 1,800 mm (71 in) annually (about 150 rainy days per year), usually lasts from May to November.[57] The dry season lasts from December to April.[57] The average temperature is 28 °C (82 °F), with little variation throughout the year.[57] The highest temperature recorded was 40.0 °C (104 °F) in April while the lowest temperature recorded was 13.8 °C (57 °F) in January.[57] On average, the city experiences between 2,400 and 2,700 hours of sunshine per year.[57]\n\nFlooding\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is considered one of the cities most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly flooding. During the rainy season, a combination of high tide, heavy rains, high flow volume in the Saigon River and Đồng Nai River and land subsidence results in regular flooding in several parts of the city.[60][61] A once-in-100 year flood would cause 23% of the city to suffer flooding.[62]\n\nAdministration\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is a municipality at the same level as Vietnam's provinces, which is subdivided into 22 district-level sub-divisions (as of 2020):\n\nThey are further subdivided into 5 commune-level towns (or townlets), 58 communes, and 249 wards (as of 2020 , see List of HCMC administrative units below).[63]\n\nOn 1 January 2021, it was announced that District 2, District 9 and Thủ Đức District would be consolidated and was approved by Standing Committee of the National Assembly.[64][50]\n\nCity government\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee is a 13-member executive branch of the city. The current chairman is Phan Văn Mãi. There are several vice chairmen and chairwomen on the committee with responsibility over various city departments.\n\nThe legislative branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Council and consists of 105 members. The current chairwoman is Nguyễn Thị Lệ.\n\nThe judiciary branch of the city is the Ho Chi Minh City People's Court. The current chief judge is Lê Thanh Phong.\n\nThe executive committee of Communist Party of Ho Chi Minh City is the leading organ of the Communist Party in Ho Chi Minh City.

The state-owned sector makes up 33.3% of the economy, the private sector 4.6%, and the remainder in foreign investment. Concerning its economic structure, the service sector accounts for 51.1%, industry and construction account for 47.7% and forestry, agriculture and others make up just 1.2%.[96]\n\nThe city and its ports are part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe.[97][98]\n\nQuang Trung Software Park is a software park situated in District 12. The park is approximately 15 km (9 mi) from downtown Ho Chi Minh City and hosts software enterprises as well as dot.com companies. The park also includes a software training school. Dot.com investors here are supplied with other facilities and services such as residences and high-speed access to the internet as well as favorable taxation. Together with the Hi-Tech Park in Thủ Đức, and the 32 ha. software park inside Tân Thuận Export Processing Zone in District 7 of the city, Ho Chi Minh City aims to become an important hi-tech city in the country and the South-East Asia region.\n\nThis park helps the city in particular and Vietnam in general to become an outsourcing location for other enterprises in developed countries, as India has done. Some 300,000 businesses, including many large enterprises, are involved in high-tech, electronic, processing and light industries, and also in construction, building materials and agricultural products. Additionally, crude oil is a popular economic base in the city. Investors are still pouring money into the city. Total local private investment was 160 billion đồng (US$7.5 million)[99] with 18,500 newly founded companies. Investment trends to high technology, services and real estate projects.[citation needed]\n\nAs of June 2006, the city had three export processing zones and twelve industrial parks, in addition to Quang Trung Software Park and Ho Chi Minh City hi-tech park. Intel has invested about 1 billion dollars in a factory in the city. More than fifty banks with hundreds of branches and about 20 insurance companies are also located inside the city. The Stock Exchange, the first stock exchange in Vietnam, was opened in 2001. There are 171 medium and large-scale markets as well as several supermarket chains, shopping malls, and fashion and beauty centers.[citation needed]\n\nUrbanisation\n\n[edit]\n\nWith a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010)[100] (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), the city needs increased public infrastructure.[63] To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centres. The two most prominent projects are the Thủ Thiêm city centre in District 2 and the Phú Mỹ Hưng Urban Area, a new city centre in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australian Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology are located. In December 2007, Phú Mỹ Hưng's new City Centre completed the 17.8 km (11.1 mi) 10–14 lane wide Nguyễn Văn Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tân Thuận Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade centre, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Centre, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phú Gia 99. Phú Mỹ Hưng's new City Centre received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.[citation needed]\n\nShopping\n\n[edit]\n\nSome of the larger shopping malls and plazas opened recently include:\n\nMaximark – Multiple locations (District 10, Tân Bình District)\n\nSatramart – 460 3/2 Street, Ward 12, District 10\n\nAuchan (2016) – Multiple locations (District 10, Gò Vấp District)\n\nLotte Mart – Multiple locations (District 7, District 11, Tân Bình District)\n\nAEON Mall – Multiple locations (Bình Tân District, Tân Phú District)\n\nSC VivoCity (2015) – 1058 Nguyễn Văn Linh Boulevard, Tân Phong Ward, District 7\n\nZen Plaza (1995) – 54–56 Nguyễn Trãi St, District 1\n\nSaigon Centre (1997) – 65 Lê Lợi Blvd, District 1\n\nDiamond Plaza (1999) – 34 Lê Duẩn Blvd, District 1\n\nBig C (2002) – Multiple locations (District 10, Bình Tân District, Gò Vấp District, Phú Nhuận District, Tân Phú District)\n\nMETRO Cash & Carry/Mega Market – Multiple locations (District 2, District 6, District 12)\n\nCrescent Mall – Phú Mỹ Hưng Urban Area, District 7\n\nParkson (2005–2009) – Multiple locations (District 1, District 2, District 5, District 7, District 11, Tân Bình District)\n\nSaigon Paragon (2009) – 3 Nguyễn Lương Bằng St, Tân Phú Ward, District 7\n\nNowZone (2009) – 235 Nguyễn Văn Cừ Ave, District 1\n\nKumho Asiana Plaza (2010) – 39 Lê Duẩn Blvd, Bến Nghé Ward, District 1\n\nVincom Centre (2010) – 70–72 Lê Thánh Tôn St, District 1\n\nUnion Square – 171 Lê Thánh Tôn st, District 1\n\nVincom Mega Mall (2016) – 161 Hà Nội Highway, Thảo Điền Ward, District 2 (City of Thủ Đức)\n\nBitexco Financial Tower (2010) Alley 2 Hàm Nghi Blvd, District 1\n\nCo.opmart – Multiple locations (District 1, District 3, District 5, District 6, District 7, District 8, District 10, District 11, District 12, Bình Chánh District, Bình Tân District, Bình Thạnh District, Củ Chi District, Gò Vấp District, Hóc Môn District, Phú Nhuận District, Tân Phú District, Thủ Đức District)\n\nLandmark 81 (2018) – 208 Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh St, Bình Thạnh District\n\nWinMart – Multiple locations (District 1, District 2, District 7, District 9, District 10, Bình Chánh District, Bình Thạnh District, Gò Vấp District, Tân Bình District, Thủ Đức District)\n\nIn 2007, three million foreign tourists, about 70% of the total number of tourists to Vietnam, visited the city. Total cargo transport to city's ports reached 50.5 million tonnes,[101] nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.\n\nCityscape\n\n[edit]\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nHo Chi Minh City has many architecturally notable buildings from different styles and time periods. French influence during the colonial era can be seen throughout the city, especially in District 1 where a number of buildings can be found. Notable buildings of French colonial architecture include the Ho Chi Minh City Hall, Saigon Central Post Office, Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica of Saigon and Bến Thành Market.[102]\n\nApart from its French architecture, Ho Chi Minh City is also home to a number of buildings inspired by Chinese architecture. Notable buildings are mostly found in Chợ Lớn, where many Hoa people reside. These include the Thien Hau Temple, which was first built around 1760, making it one of the oldest historic buildings still standing in the city.[103]\n\nDuring the Republic of Vietnam era, Vietnamese modernist architecture began to develop in the city. Prominent buildings which were commissioned during this time include the Independence Palace, replacing the former Independence Palace which was of Baroque Revival architecture.[104]\n\nParks and gardens\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite the city's high building density, Ho Chi Minh City has a number of large parks. One of the largest and most popular parks is Tao Đàn Park, located next to the Independence Palace in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City.[105] Other parks in District 1 include the September 23rd Park and 30/4 Park.[106]\n\nThe Saigon Zoo and Botanical Gardens, located on the northern end of District 1, is one of the world's oldest zoos and botanical gardens. It contains a collection of over 600 rare animals and about 4,000 plant species, some of which are over 100 years in age.[107]\n\nPedestrian zones\n\n[edit]\n\nNguyễn Huệ Boulevard was the first pedestrian street in Ho Chi Minh City. It opened to the public in April 2015, and is a popular spot for locals and visitors to gather.[108] Many events are held in the precinct throughout the year, including the annual flower festival during Tết.[109]\n\nBui Vien Walking Street is also well-known in Ho Chi Minh City due to its status as a hub for western backpackers and tourists.[110] Bui Vien Street, also known as “Western Street” (Pho Tay), is a backpacker district in Ho Chi Minh City that offers a variety of restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, live music pubs, and rooftop bars. Before becoming a walking street, Bui Vien Street was a popular destination for backpackers to have fun, try unfamiliar cuisines, and explore new places during their trip to Ho Chi Minh City.[111]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is served by Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnam's air passenger traffic[112][113]). Long Thành International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Thành District, Đồng Nai Province, about 40 km (25 mi) east of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Thành Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; Tân Sơn Nhất Airport will serve domestic flights.[114]\n\nRail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Saigon to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line.[115] Within the city, the two main stations are Sóng Thần and Sài Gòn. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as Dĩ An, Thủ Đức, Bình Triệu, Gò Vấp. However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.[116]\n\nWater transport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city's location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including Vũng Tàu, Cần Thơ and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Đôi and Tẻ Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011–14.[117] In 2017, the Saigon Waterbus launched, connecting District 1 to Thu Duc City.[118]\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nMetro\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a rapid transit network, is being built in stages. The first line is under construction, and expected to be fully operational by 2024.[119] This first line will connect Bến Thành to Suối Tiên Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Bình. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily.[120] A line between Bến Thành and Tham Lương in District 12 has been approved by the government,[121] and several more lines are the subject of ongoing feasibility studies.[120]\n\nBus\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. The city has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station – in terms of passengers handled – is the Miền Đông Coach Station in the Bình Thạnh District.\n\nPrivate transport\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have metres, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, \"xe ôm\" (literally, \"hug vehicle\") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. You can also book motorcycle and car taxis through ride-hailing apps like Grab and GoJek. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular.[122] There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi.[116] The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution. The government has called out motorcycles as the reason for the congestion and has developed plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transport.[123]\n\nExpressway\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city has two expressways making up the North-South Expressway system, connecting the city with other provinces.\n\nThe first expressway is Ho Chi Minh City - Trung Lương Expressway, opened in 2010, connecting Ho Chi Minh City with Tiền Giang and the Mekong Delta.[124]\n\nThe second one is Ho Chi Minh City - Long Thành - Dầu Giây Expressway, opened in 2015, connecting the city with Đồng Nai, Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu and the Southeast of Vietnam.[125] The Ho Chi Minh City - Long Khánh Expressway is under planning and will be constructed in the near future.\n\nHealthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nThe health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centres and dozens of international facilities,[126] as well as privately owned clinics.[63] The 1,400-bed Chợ Rẫy Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology, Prima Saigon Eye Hospital (Ophthalmology), a member of World Association of Eye Hospitals[127] and City International Hospital are among the top medical facilities in the South-East Asia region. Ho Chi Minh City is the epicenter of medical tourism in Vietnam\n\nChợ Rẫy Hospital is the largest tertiary care hospital in Ho Chi Minh City and the South of Vietnam.\n\nPrima Medical Center Saigon is the leading private eye hospital in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nFranco-Vietnamese Hospital in District 7, Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nCity International Hospital is the prominent Women & Children Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nHigh schools\n\n[edit]\n\nNotable high schools in the city include Lê Hồng Phong High School for the Gifted, Phổ Thông Năng Khiếu High School for the Gifted, Trần Đại Nghĩa High School for the Gifted, Nguyễn Thượng Hiền High School, Nguyễn Thị Minh Khai High School, Gia Định High School [vi], Lê Quý Đôn High School [vi], Marie Curie High School, Võ Thị Sáu High School, Trần Phú High School and others.

The city's centre has some wide American-style boulevards and a few French colonial buildings. The majority of these tourist spots are located in District 1 and are a short distance from each other. The most prominent structures in the city centre are the Reunification Palace (Dinh Thống Nhất), City Hall (Ủy ban nhân dân Thành phố), Municipal Theatre (Nhà hát thành phố, also known as the Opera House), City Post Office (Bưu điện thành phố), State Bank Office (Ngân hàng Nhà nước), City People's Court (Tòa án nhân dân thành phố), and Notre-Dame Cathedral (Nhà thờ Đức Bà Sài Gòn), which was constructed between 1863 and 1880. Some of the historic hotels include the Hotel Majestic, dating from the French colonial era, and the Rex and Caravelle hotels, both of which are former hangouts for American officers and war correspondents in the 1960s & '70s.[134]\n\nThe city has various museums including the City Museum, Museum of History, the Revolutionary Museum, the Museum of south-eastern Armed Forces, the War Remnants Museum, the Museum of Southern Women, the Museum of Fine Arts, the Nhà Rồng Memorial House, and the Bến Dược Relic of Underground Tunnels.

Aside from the Municipal Theatre, there are other places of entertainment such as the Bến Thành Theatre, Hòa Bình Theatre, and the Lan Anh Music Stage. The city is home to hundreds of cinemas and theatres, with cinema and drama theatre revenue accounting for 60–70% of Vietnam's total revenue in this industry.[citation needed] Unlike other theatrical organisations found in Vietnam's provinces and municipalities, residents of the city keep their theatres active without the support of subsidies from the Vietnamese government. The city is also home to most of the private film companies in Vietnam.[citation needed]\n\nLike many of Vietnam's smaller cities, the city boasts a multitude of restaurants serving typical Vietnamese dishes such as phở or rice vermicelli.

Famous locations for art in Ho Chi Minh City include Ho Chi Minh City Museum of Fine Arts, and various art galleries located on Nam Kỳ Khởi Nghĩa street, Trần Phú street, and Bùi Viện street.[139]\n\nFood and drink\n\n[edit]\n\nHo Chi Minh City cultivates a strong food and drink culture with lots of roadside restaurants, coffee shops, and food stalls where locals and tourists can enjoy local cuisine and beverages at low prices.[140] It is currently ranked in the top five best cities in the world for street food.[141]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Media of Vietnam and Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\nThe city's media is the most developed in the country.

Mobile phone service is provided by a number of companies, including Viettel Mobile, MobiFone, VinaPhone, and Vietnam Mobile.\n\nSport\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2005 , Ho Chi Minh City was home to 91 football fields, 86 swimming pools, and 256 gyms.[142] The largest stadium in the city is the 15,000-seat Thống Nhất Stadium, located on Đào Duy Từ Street, in Ward 6 of District 10. The next largest is Military Region 7 Stadium, located near Tan Son Nhat Airport in Tân Bình district. The Military Region 7 Stadium was of the venues for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup finals. As well as being a sporting venue, it is also the site of a music school.

Since its inception in 2016, Sài Gòn F.C. competed in V.League 1, however, in 2022 they suffered relegation and will complete in V.League 2 in 2023.\n\nIn 2011, the city was awarded an expansion team for the ASEAN Basketball League.[145] Saigon Heat was the first ever international professional basketball team to represent Vietnam.[146] The team also plays in the domestic basketball league, the Vietnam Basketball Association, and have won the championship on three occasions (2019, 2020 and 2022).\n\nIn 2016, a second professional basketball team was created, Wings, playing in the domestic Vietnam Basketball Association.\n\nThe city hosts a number of international sport events throughout the year, such as the AFF Futsal Championship and the Vietnam Vertical Run. Several other sports are represented by teams in the city, such as Irish (Gaelic) Football, rugby, cricket,[147] volleyball, basketball, chess, athletics, and table tennis.[148]\n\nInternational relations\n\n[edit]\n\nTwin towns – sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is twinned with:[149]\n\nCooperation and friendship\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to its twin towns, the city is in cooperation with:[149]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nVietnam portal\n\n175 Hospital\n\nHistory of Organized Crime in Saigon\n\nList of East Asian ports\n\nList of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nList of historical capitals of Vietnam\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
