        "text": "Phạm Quỳnh (1893–1945), twentieth century Vietnamese intellectual and politician, is a contentious figure in Vietnamese colonial history in terms of his collaboration with the French administration. Much of the mixed opinions on his role, though gleaned from his essays and political positions, have not yet been connected to the ambiguities of the colonial reforms concurrent with his budding career. Informed by Homi Bhabha's framework of ‘mimicry’, this study offers a reading of Phạm Quỳnh's attachment to language, both tongue and discourse, to nuance his character and reveal the ambiguous articulations of French colonial policy in Vietnam.\n\n2 Many articles have periodically appeared on Phạm Quỳnh's death in Vietnamese online, some even outlining his final moments, e.g., Xưa Và Nay (i.e. Nhật Hoa Khanh, Oct. 2006), Hồn Việt (i.e. Thái Vũ 27 Apr. 2011), and Báo Mới (Anonymous, 17 Nov. 2009). See also blogs, e.g., Phạm Tôn, ‘Ai đã giết Phạm Quỳnh, Người nặng lòng với nước’ [Who killed Phạm Quỳnh, the Vietnamese patriot?], 18 Sept. 2009, http://sachhiem.net/LICHSU/P/PhamTon04.php (accessed Aug. 2017).\n\n4 Among historians, he has been pigeonholed as a collaborator who even ‘prostituted’ himself for these leveraging relationships with the colonal administration. See Marr, David, Vietnamese tradition on trial (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984), pp. 153–61Google Scholar, and Lâm's, Trương BửuColonialism experienced: Vietnamese writings on colonialism, 1900–1931 (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 2000), p. 292CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n12 The idea of an alliance with local elites to implement French policy more effectively can be traced back to J.L. de Lanessan and his term as governor-general (1891–94) shortly after the Patenôtre Treaty of 1884. Pierre Brocheux and Daniel Hémery trace the period of colonial reformism and official policies of ‘association’ to 1905, under the government of Emile Combes in France and Minister of Colonies Etienne Clémentel. See Indochina: An ambiguous colonization, 1854–1954, trans. Klein, Ly Lan Dill et al. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009), pp. 300–301Google Scholar.\n\n14 Sarraut writes: ‘La France qui colonise va organiser l'exploitation pour son avantage sans doute, mais aussi pour l'avantage générale du monde, de territoires et de ressources que les races autochtones de ces pays arriérés ne pouvaient à elles seules ou ne savaient mettre en valeur et dont le profit était ainsi perdu pour elles, comme pour la collectivité universelle.’ [French colonisation will no doubt consolidate exploitation for its own benefit, but also for the general benefit of the world, valorising territories and resources that the indigenous people of these backward countries cannot or do not know how to do on their own, risking the loss of such value not only for them but for the universal collective.] Sarraut, Albert, La mise en valeur des colonies (Paris: Payot, 1923), p. 88Google Scholar.\n\n23 The speeches at the different institutions in Paris were published in Nam Phong beginning in issue 66. In 1923, these were collected into a single volume, where the French original is accompanied with page-by-page translations, in Quelques Conférences à Paris, Mai-Juillet 1922 (Hanoi: Imprimerie Tonkinoise, 1923)Google Scholar.\n\n25 The letter was written by Nguyễn Háo Vĩnh, from Cochinchina, ‘Thư ngỏ chủ-bút Nam Phong’ [Letter to the editor], Nam Phong, 16 Oct. 1918, pp. 198–209. More on this editorial debate can be found in Marr, Vietnamese tradition on trial, pp. 158–61.\n\n27 Phạm Quỳnh, ‘Mộng hay mị?’ [Dream or hallucination?], Nam Phong, 7, Jan. 1918, pp. 23–5. In another review of a different work from Tản Đà called ‘Đài Gương’, Phạm Quỳnh ínstead praised the writer's ability to address the moral education of young girls, to have written ‘such a useful book’. ‘Giới thiệu sách mới’ [Introducing new works], Nam Phong, 23, May 1919, p. 423.\n\n28 In a compte rendu for Paul Bourget's novel Le sens de la mort, Phạm Quỳnh writes, ‘Có lắm cái tư-tưởng cảm-giác không tài nào diễn ra tiếng ta cho minh-liệu được. Cho hay cái quốc văn ta mới nở còn non-nớt chưa đủ sức mà ra vẫy-vùng trong bể ngôn-luận. Bởi vậy mà ta phải luyện cho nó có cái tư cách ấy. [There are a lot of thoughts and feelings that cannot be expressed clearly in our language. How can our still-burgeoning national language be flaunted in discussions? This is why we must develop it to reach that capacity.]’ See ‘Một bộ tiểu thuyết mới: Nghĩa cái chết’ [A new set of novels: The meaning of death], Nam Phong 1, 18 July 1917, pp. 20–27.\n\n35 The use of the familiar ‘tu’ and the formal ‘vous’ forms of address in familial or informal and formal discourse and settings, respectively, indicating also sociological distinctions such as heirarchy and kinship.\n\n41 For two different analyses of these debates, see Lockhart, Bruce, The end of the Vietnamese monarchy (New Haven, NY: Council on Southeast Asian Studies, Yale University, 1993), pp. 51–7Google Scholar, and Goscha, Going Indochinese, pp. 62–8."
