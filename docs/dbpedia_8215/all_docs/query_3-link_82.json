The city probably had its origins in a Cham frontier settlement called Baigaur, which was most likely a market town during the eleventh century. The area was rich in ﬁsh, buffalo and rice, and it seems likely that it was Baigaur that became a part of the Khmer Empire, and became the Cambodian port of Prey Nokor after the Khmers defeated the Chams in 1145 and sacked the Cham capital of Vijaya in Central Vietnam. Over the next few centuries there was a major movement south of the Vietnamese people. In 1623, the Khmer king, Chay Chettha II, allowed the Vietnamese to establish a customs post at Prey Nokor. Many ethnic Vietnamese soon moved to the town, which grew in importance and in 1674, the Vietnamese from there launched an attack on Cambodia. In 1698, the town was taken over by the Vietnamese and it was renamed Gia Dinh. The town, gradually coming to be called Saigon, grew in importance, with a predominantly Chinese township called Cholon emerging to the west. The Tay Son Rebellion saw the Tay Son rebels attack both Saigon and Cholon – indeed when the nephew of the last of the Nguyen lords who ruled at Hue, Nguyen Anh (later Emperor Gia Long), took Saigon in 1789, he ordered the construction of a large citadel there to protect the city from attack. From the early nineteenth century, when French and other foreigners visited Saigon, they found the city dominated by the citadel, with Cholon still a separate township. A number of French settlers started living in the city, including the missionary Joseph Marchand, He became embroiled in a dispute with the imperial government when, in 1833, Emperor Minh Mang ordered that the grave of a popular general Le Van Duyet be desecrated. Many local people were angered by this and, led by Le Van Khoi, the general’s son, they stormed and took over the Saigon Citadel. In 1835, imperial forces took back the citadel and executed Marchand. The citadel was rebuilt in the following year.\n\nviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1861, the French attacked this new citadel and in the Battle of Ky Hoa on 24–25 February, the French captured the citadel and took Saigon. This takeover was formalised in 1862 with the Treaty of Saigon, with Emperor Tu Duc ceding the three provinces, which included Saigon and the area around it. Six years later, three more provinces were ceded. These were to form Cochinchina.\n\nIntroduction\n\nix\n\nDuring the second half of the nineteenth century, the French started constructing many of the buildings which would be important in Saigon’s history until 1975. These included the Notre Dame Basilica, and also the famous Opera House. And as well as the civic buildings, the markets were also rebuilt, with better attention to sanitation. With World War I, some of the Vietnamese elite in Saigon started becoming involved in politics through the Constitutionalist Party and other moderate groups, which sought to gain control of the Constitutional Council, the advisory body set up by the French. At the same time, there were also Vietnamese Nationalists inspired by the Kuomintang in China; and the Vietnamese Communists formed with the help of the Soviet and Chinese communist movements. French rule in Saigon during the 1920s and 1930s led to a major increase in government infrastructure. However, the nationalist and communist movements were becoming better organised and seeking a moment to take power from the French. With the start of World War II, and especially with the defeat of France in June 1940, the French were humiliated. The colonial government in Indochina tried to maintain their rule, but there were inroads made by some Japanese who, on 9 March 1945, seized power and forced Emperor Bao Dai to declare independence. There was much political ferment in Saigon, with Bao Dai’s hold on on the city not being very strong. When Japan surrendered, the communists under Ho Chi Minh used the power vacuum to seize power.\n\nRue Catinat in the 1930s.\n\nx\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe communist movement was not as strong in Saigon as it had been in other parts of Vietnam, and the French managed to take back control of Saigon. The French held power through to 1954, initially themselves, and then formed the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina, then, after machinations in the city, they managed to get Bao Dai to agree to head the State of Vietnam. However, Bao Dai and the French had to rely on the Binh Xuyen, the Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao to maintain their rule. With the defeat of France in 1954, and the French government were determined to pull out under the terms of the Geneva Agreements, prime minister Ngo Dinh Diem decided that he would try to build a state centred on Saigon. With US backing, he destroyed the power of the Binh Xuyen, the Cao Dai and the Hoa Hao, and in 1955, following a referendum, he proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam. Initially able to pull together many of the various anti-communist political groups in Saigon and elsewhere, Diem was so successful that in 1960, the communists decided to launch an insurgency with the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, forming the People’s Liberation Armed Forces in the following year.\n\nBoulevard Bonnard in the 1950s.\n\nWith the inﬂux of US funds, and growing economic certainty in the city, Saigon started to boom with a rise in construction. Gradually the ﬁelds between Saigon and Cholon were covered with buildings, and many of the major hotels had journalists covering the war, and soon the political developments. Also there was rising discontent against President Diem, and the rebel air force\n\nIntroduction\n\nxi\n\nofﬁcers bombed the Presidential Palace in February 1962, forcing the ﬁrst family to move to the Gia Long Palace. In the summer of 1963, the protests, mainly by Buddhist activists, reached a peak with the self-immolation of Thich Quang Duc. Rebel soldiers, with the backing of the United States, attacked the Gia Long Palace on 1 November. Although President Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu escaped, they were killed on the following day. From November 1963 until June 1965 there were constant coups and coup attempts, with US presidential adviser Jack Valenti describing the government as a ‘turnstile’. The economic boom in Saigon continued, but it was now solely based on US government funding, which increased dramatically after March 1965, when US marines arrived in South Vietnam. The Vietnam War from 1965 until 1975 saw relatively little ﬁghting in Saigon itself which remained – largely – relatively stable, especially when compared to the previous ten years. There were exceptions, such as the attack on the US Embassy in March 1965, and, of course, the Tet Offensive when the Vietnamese communists sought to prove that they could attack targets thought to be safe, including the US Embassy itself. Although the Tet Offensive did not lead to a general uprising, as some of the communist leadership had hoped, and the US and South Vietnamese forces took back control of the city, in the minds of many people around the world, the South Vietnamese were seen to be losing. The increasing number of US casualties, and the use of conscription, led to the war becoming more and more unpopular in the United States. As the US government sought a way of extricating themselves from the ﬁghting, negotiations with the communists started, leading to the Paris Agreement of 27 January 1973. The rest of 1973 and the whole of 1974 was a period of some renewed conﬁdence in Saigon. Many people expected that the ﬁghting might be over, as a political accommodation seemed to have been reached. However, there were regular clashes, especially in late 1974, and the Vietnamese communists decided to attack in January 1975. Intially, they moved slowly, worried about US reaction. Soon they realised that the United States was not planning to intervene. Although the communists had planned a two-year war, they quickly moved on Saigon, with the South Vietnamese throwing all their forces into the Battle of Xuan Loc. After massive communist assaults, the South Vietnamese Army was ﬁnally defeated on 21 April, with President Nguyen Van Thieu resigning. Some of the South Vietnamese leadership believed that they could achieve some form of political settlement, but the communists were able to move on Saigon, shelling it from 27 April, The United States launched Operation Frequent Wind to evacuate their citizens, their South Vietnamese allies, and third country nationals. On 30 April 1975, Vietnamese communist tanks burst into the grounds of the Presidential Palace and the South Vietnamese president Duong Van Minh urged a ceaseﬁre.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany people appeared on the streets to cheer the communists – as well as the end of the war. The statue to the South Vietnamese Army – known as the Marine Statue – in the centre of the city was pulled down. It seemed as though the communists might be magnanimous in their victory. However, the new regime quickly started rounding up South Vietnamese ofﬁcials, many of whom languished for many years in terrible conditions in prison camps. The United States maintained a boycott of trade with Vietnam, and the country went through a restructuring by hardline communist ideologues. Many families in Saigon lost everything. Even low-level former South Vietnamese soldiers and civil servants found themselves banned from employment, and the Chinese merchant class was persecuted in 1978, with hundreds of thousands of them forced to ﬂee, creating refugee problems throughout the region. The problem was exacerbated in the following year after the war between China and Vietnam.\n\nBà Huyn Thanh Quan in 2000. Author’s Photograph.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Vietnam remained isolated and few foreigners visited Ho Chi Minh City (as Saigon had been renamed). The isolation of Vietnam continued following their invasion of Cambodia in December 1978. With the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia in 1989, and moves towards\n\nIntroduction\n\nxiii\n\nliberalising the economy in Vietnam – especially in Saigon – there appeared ready ﬂow of foreign tourists into the country. During the late 1990s, this increased rapidly, and continued through the 2000s, as troubles in Indonesia saw many people who might have gone there heading for the more politically stable Vietnam. Many Vietnamese whose families had ﬂed overseas started to return to Vietnam to visit, and sometimes to set up businesses. During the 2000s, Saigon was transformed again, with a massive construction boom as hotels and guest houses sprang up all over the city to cater for the hundreds of thousands of tourists who came in search of good weather, and the cheap cost of living. Many museums around Ho Chi Minh City show not only aspects of the Vietnam War, but also the French colonial presence and Dong Khoi has now as many exquisite shops as Rue Catinat had in old Saigon. After studying the history of Vietnam and teaching about the Vietnam War for many years, my work on the history of the city, which forms the basis of this book, started during two visits to Ho Chi Minh City when I managed to purchase large numbers of old books, journals, and newspapers from the French period, and visit most of the sites covered in this book. I must also thank Hanh Nguyen, who lived in Ho Chi Minh City for several years, for his checking the Vietnamese diacriticals. References at the end of articles indicate further reading and other background reading. An emphasis is given to works in English and which are accessible to the general reader. This includes the major biographical works, Who’s Who, the British publication (although it does cover some non-Britons), and Who Was Who, the cumulative edition of the same work.

The US consul general in Saigon from 1948 until 1950, he was born on 5 February 1904 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Walter H. Abbott and Winifred (née Manlove). Studying at the Case School of Applied Science, he joined the US consular service, and was vice consul in Calcutta, India, 1928–29; Oslo, Norway 1930–34; and then was US consul in Marseille, France, 1938–41; and at Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1941. Serving in Paris in 1944, he was then posted to Saigon. On 12 September 1946, Abbott met with Ho Chi Minh, and the latter mentioned his admiration for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and for his own wartime collaboration with Americans. Whilst in Vietnam, Abbott also reported on what he saw as the inevitability of a communist victory in the whole of Indochina, unless it was to be an ‘advance bastion against [the] Bolshevist tide in Southeast Asia’. He was also critical of the Elysée Accords and the special rights given to French citizens without any corresponding rights accorded to the Vietnamese. A Republican, he retired in June 1962. He died on 22 February 1988 in Morristown, Vermont. References: William J.

The photographer who captured the famous image of the shooting of a Viet Cong agent by General Nguyen Ngoc Loan in Saigon, Eddie Adams was born on 12 June 1933 in New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and became interested in photography at high school. During the Korean War, Adams was a combat photographer and then he went to Vietnam where, on 1 February 1968, the second full day of the Tet Offensive, he managed to take one of the iconic photographs of the war. The photograph of the shooting by General Loan became famous, but Adams said he felt sorry about it, because it destroyed Loan’s life, and he apologised to him. Loan replied philosophically that they were each doing their jobs. Adams later worked taking photographs of Vietnamese refugees and became a freelance photographer in 1980, later covering the Gulf War. He died on 19 September 2004. 3\n\n4 An Quang Pagoda References: ‘Eddie Adams’ Dangerous Weapon’, Vietnam Magazine, vol. 22, no. 2 (August 2009): p. 28; Hannah Feldman, ‘Eddie Adams’, in Lynne Warren (ed.), Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, London: Routledge, 2006, pp. 14–15; ‘War lensman haunted by one image’, The Australian (21 September 2004): p. 10; ‘Lensman haunted by candid shot’, The Australian (22 September 2004): p. 18; Stanley Karnow, Vietnam: A History, London: Penguin Books, 1987, p. 529; Philip Knightley, The First Casualty: From the Crimea to the Falklands – the War Correspondent as Hero, Propagandist and Myth Maker, London: Pan Books, 1975, pp. 410, 419; Mitchel P.

This pagoda dates from 1948 and is located in Master Van Hanh Street to the southwest of central Saigon, and north of Cholon. The pagoda not only served as a religious centre, the monks at the pagoda also helped hundreds of street children, with many local women helping as lay assistants. A famous local craftsman, Truong Van Thanh (Minh Tinh) created a set of interesting lacquer paintings, which are displayed at the pagoda. For many years, the pagoda was the home of the monk Thich Tri Quang, who led a large number of the Buddhist protests. Some of his initial political activities were against the French, and then in May 1963, he used the pagoda as a base for organising some of the increasingly large protests against the government of President Ngo Dinh Diem. In 1964, there was further political unrest from monks at the pagoda, as they feared that pro-Diem army ofﬁcers were about to return to power. In 1966, Nguyen Cao Ky ordered Thich Tri Quang to be placed under house arrest. At the end of the Vietnam War, Thich Tri Quang was again held under house arrest, this time by the communists, then put in solitary conﬁnement, but was later being released. Besides serving as the base for Buddhists who took part in the protests in the early and mid-1960s, the An Quang Pagoda is perhaps best known as the location in front of which, on 1 February 1968, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan shot dead a captured communist prisoner – with the famous photograph of the incident taken by Eddie Adams of Associated Press. It was rumoured that the pagoda, because of the militant Buddhists there, was being used as a ﬁeld hospital for the communists. The pagoda remains the headquarters of the Institute for Dharma Propagation.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly of Saigon) was established during the French period and was created as the Apostolic Vicariate of Western Cochinchina, with Dominique Lefèbvre, who had been coadjutor vicar apostolic of Cochin, becoming the vicar apostolic of Western Cochinchina until 1864. Jean-Claude Miche then took over from 1864 until his death in December 1873. The Archbishop’s Palace was built in 1859–60, when Dominique Lefèbvre was the vicar apostolic, and it was later rebuilt. The Apostolic Vicariate of Western Cochinchina became the Apostolic Vicariate of Saigon until 24 November 1960, when it was promoted to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Saigon, until it was renamed on 23 November 1976. Located on the corner of Nguyen Dinh Chieu St (formerly Avenue Richaud), and Tran Quoc Thao St, the Archbishop’s Palace has been one of the centres of the important Roman Catholic community in the city. After the communists took Saigon on 30 April 1975, the new communist government targeted François-Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan, the coadjutor archbishop of Saigon (and also a nephew of Ngo Dinh Diem). He was interned for thirteen years and then released on 21 November 1988, but held under house arrest in the Archbishop’s Palace. He went to Rome in 1991 and was not allowed to return. In his absence, the building was renovated.\n\nVicars Apostolic of Western Cochinchina (Vietnam) 2 March 1844 – 28 Aug 1864 Bishop Dominique Lefèbvre 9 Sept 1864 – 1 Dec 1873 Bishop Jean-Claude Miche 1 Dec 1873 – 31 Dec 1894 Bishop Isidore-François-Joseph Colombert 12 Apr 1895 – 17 Oct 1898 Bishop Jean-Marie Dépierre 11 Feb 1899 – 11 Feb 1920 Bishop Lucien-Émile Mossard 11 Feb 1920 – 4 Oct 1924 Bishop Victor-Charles Quinton Vicars Apostolic of Saigon 17 Dec 1925 – 16 Feb 1940 20 Feb 1941 – 20 Sept 1955 20 Sept 1955 – 24 Nov 1960\n\nBishop Isidore-Marie-Joseph Dumortier Bishop Jean Cassaigne Bishop Simon Hoa Nguyen Van Hien.\n\n6 Architecture\n\nMetropolitan Archbishops of Saigon 24 Nov 1960 – 23 Nov 1976 Archbishop Paul Nguyen Van Binh Metropolitan Archbishops of Than-Pho Ho Chi Minh 23 Nov 1976 – 1 July 1995 Archbishop Paul Nguyen Van Binh 1993 – 1 March 1998 Bishop Nicolas Huynh Van Nghi (Apostolic Administrator) 1 March 1998 – Cardinal Jean-Baptiste Pham Minh Man References: John Colet, Footprint Vietnam Handbook, London: Footprint Handbooks, 2002, p. 280; Le Quang Ninh and Stéphane Dovert, Saigon: Architectures, 1698–1998, Ho Chi Minh City: Nha Xuat Ban Thanh Pho Ho Chi Minh, 1998, pp. 148–49.\n\nARCHITECTURE. There are a wide range of architectural styles in Ho Chi Minh City. Some of the oldest surviving buildings in the city are Chinese pagodas, which are similar to Chinese temples in other parts of southern China and Southeast Asia. In Cholon, as well as some parts of Ho Chi Minh City, there are the traditional Chinese shop houses, pagodas and temples, quite a number of which have survived and continue to ensure that Cholon remains a largely Chinese suburb. From the French period, there are many large colonial buildings. Some of these were uncompromisingly like counterparts in France, albeit smaller. The Notre Dame Cathedral completed in Saigon in 1880 has many features which adorn Notre Dame de Paris. Indeed there was little compromise in the design, and many of the worshippers found the heat within the cathedral oppressive. It was not until 1942 that architects managed to get additional openings in the lateral chapels to allow more air ﬂow. The Hôtel de Ville (now the People’s Committee Building certainly would not look out of place in any town in metropolitan France. The Opera House was built in 1897–1900, with its design was very much like the Opéra Garnier in Paris. Later buildings started to incorporate Indochinese motifs into their design, but classical columns like those on the Norodom Palace (later the Presidential Palace; later rebuilt and now the Reuniﬁcation Palace) and the Gia Long Palace both incorporate some Vietnamese aspects, with Ernest Hebrard being involved in designing buildings to ‘engage the sympathy of the natives’. The French villas favoured by the French colonists and also the Saigon elite had large verandahs and used brick or concrete to keep them cooler. In these buildings, the kitchens and quarters for servants were on the ground ﬂoor, with the owners – French or Vietnamese – living upstairs. Amidst these French colonial buildings and villas, however, there were still many traditional Vietnamese wooden houses. The Vietnam War led to a massive inﬂux of money into the Saigon economy and the need to construct buildings quickly. Some, like the US Embassy and\n\nd’Argenlieu, Georges Thierry (1889–1964)\n\n7\n\nNguyen Cao Ky’s Vice Presidential Palace at Tan Son Nhut, had defensive elements incorporated into their design. After the bombing of the Presidential Palace on 27 February 1962, its replacement, constructed between 1962 and 1966, was very much a functional piece of architecture. It was a large, light and airy, but a remote and rather impersonal structure replete with a large bunker and a helipad. There were also famous conversions, such as the Banier Auto Hall being turned into the Rex Hotel. From 1975 until the late 1980s, there was not much new building work in Ho Chi Minh City. However, with the tourist boom from the 1990s, many buildings were demolished and others converted and transformed to make way for hotel and business complexes. Many houses in Pham Ngu Lao Street were quickly turned into hotels, guest houses and dormitories. At the same time, with the increase in business and foreign investment, tall buildings such as the Saigon Trade Center and the Bitexco Financial Tower raise the skylike of the city.

The high commissioner of French Indochina from 31 October 1945 until 1 April 1947, Georges Thierry d’Argenlieu was born on 7 August 1889 in Brest, France, his family having a long tradition of service in the French Navy. When he was seventeen he went to the École Navale and after graduating, he served as a midshipman in Morocco in the ﬁghting which led to the signing of the Treaty of Fez in 1912. During World War I, he served in the Mediterranean and in 1917 was promoted to the rank of lieutenant de vaisseau. However, he was disillusioned by the war and went to Rome to study theology. In 1920 he entered the Carmelite Order as Louis de la Trinité. Taking his vows in September 1921, eleven years later he became the provincial superior in Paris. With the start of World War I, Thierry d’Argenlieu was mobilised as an ofﬁcer in the naval reserve and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander. He was involved in the defence of Cherbourg in 1940, but was captured by the Germans. However, as he was being transported to Germany, he managed to escape and went to Britain, where he rallied to the Free French Forces of Charles de Gaulle. As there were few naval ofﬁcers who supported de Gaulle, he was appointed chief of staff of the Free French Naval Forces. At Dakar, he tried to persuade the local governor to rally to Free France and was badly wounded when the Vichy French there ﬁred at him. Rising to the rank of counter-admiral, he accompanied de Gaulle into Paris on 25 August 1944. Because of his close support for de Gaulle, Thierry d’Argenlieu was sent to Saigon to help restore the French colonial administration. He tried to return\n\n8\n\nd’Ariès, Joseph Hyacinthe Louis Jules (1813–1878)\n\nCochinchina back to the system which had operated before 1939. He basked in the grandeur of France and he refused to compromise, viewing communism, and indeed the Vietnamese nationalists, as evil. This led to his replacement, with Émile Bollaert taking over in March 1947. Returning to France, he decided to return to religious life and died on 7 September 1964 in Brest.

After the departure of Théogène François Page, d’Aries was the acting governor of Cochinchina from 1 April 1860 until 6 February 1861, when Admiral Léonard Charner was appointed governor. D’Ariès was born on 22 January 1813 at Tarbes, in the south of France, close to the border with Spain, the son of Dominique-Zacharie d’Ariès, a prosecutor, and graduated from the French naval academy in 1829. Sent to Saigon, he took command of the forces there when Page was posted to China. Based at Saigon, his garrison were subjected to many attacks from the Vietnamese and his main aim was to try to keep open his access to the sea. In accordance with the treaty of June 1862, he handed over the citadel of Vinh Long, in the Mekong Delta, to Phan Thanh Gian. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1872 and retired four years later. He died in December 1878. References: Antoine Brébion, Livre d’Or du Cambodge, de la Cochinchine et de l’Annam 1625–1910, Saigon: Imp. F. H.

From 1919 he was involved in hunting down Ho Chi Minh, and apparently introduced him (then Nguyen Ai Quoc) to Albert Sarraut in Paris in 1922. Arnoux’s work was highly commended with the policeman being appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour on 23 February 1925. On 1 July 1932 he was appointed head of the Sûreté, his position being conﬁrmed by Jean Decoux.

This was the state which was established under Bao Dai in 1949 and was a semi-independent state. This was established following the Halong Bay Agreements, which led to a declaration of independence of the State of Vietnam on 14 June 1949. However, it only had partial autonomy and remained an associated state within the French Union, with the French controlling defence and foreign policy. The state was supported by French Fourth Republic and the United States, and recognised by many Western countries. However, its creation was rejected by Ho Chi Minh and the First Indochina continued, with the Viet Minh anxious to defeat the state. Because of its support in Saigon, that city became the capital of the state. Its ﬂag was yellow with the three red stripes, its national anthem was Thanh nien Hanh Khuc (‘The March of Youths’), and its ofﬁcial languages were French and Vietnamese. Although Bao Dai remained the chief of state, he stepped down from the position of prime minister on 21 January 1950 and Nguyen Phan Long became the ﬁrst prime minister. The Associated State of Vietnam was represented at the Geneva Peace Talks, which were held in early 1954 to decide the fate of Vietnam. It was formally replaced on 26 October 1955, following the referendum held on 23 October, which saw the proclamation of the Republic of Vietnam. References: M. T.

This took place in August 1945, when the communists and their allies under Ho Chi Minh sought to seize power in the three major cities of Vietnam: Saigon, Hanoi and Hue. Following the announcement of the surrender of the Japanese on 15 August, there was likely to be a signiﬁcant period when there would be a power vacuum in the region before the French could return in force, and Ho Chi Minh was eager to take advantage of this. In Hanoi, the August Revolution started with a general uprising on 19 August, and this resulted in Ho Chi Minh proclaiming Vietnamese independence on 2 September. In Hue, Emperor Bao Dai was forced to abdicate on 25 August and he became the supreme political adviser to a new provisional government. In Saigon, the results of the August Revolution were much more mixed. Some non-communist nationalist groups join with the communists to take\n\n10 Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina\n\ncontrol of the city on 25 August, and together these proclaimed a Committee for the South. However, this foray into independence was short-lived, with the British beginning to arrive in the city on 9 September to secure southern Vietnam ahead of it being handed back to the French who were released from their internment camps. It was not long before there was unrest and soon there was ﬁghting between the French and the Vietnamese, leading to the First Indochina War.

This was a state established by the French during the First Indochina War, and it was ofﬁcially proclaimed on 1 June 1946, with Saigon as its capital. It was formed to try to prevent the Viet Minh from their planned takeover of all of Vietnam by creating a separate political unit which was proclaimed to be a ‘free state’ within the Indochinese Federation. The Viet Minh denounced the members of the government of the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina by calling them French ‘puppets’. The idea for the republic emerged from the Ho–Sainteny Agreement, reached in March 1946 between Ho Chi Minh and Jean Sainteny, the French representative. There was a clause in the agreement by which there would be a referendum in Cochinchina on whether or not it would be able to associate with the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin, which would become a ‘free state’. Worried that this might result in the communists taking over Cochinchina, Thierry d’Argenlieu, the new high commissioner, decided to establish the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina, with Dr Nguyen Van Thinh as the president of the provisional government. This entity was clearly centred on Saigon, drawing support from pro-French elements in the city. However, Nguyen Van Thinh’s suicide in November 1946 caused the French major problems and the Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina was, in 1947, renamed the Republic of South Vietnam, and then in 1948 it became the Provisional\n\nAviation\n\n11\n\nCentral Government of Vietnam. Formally abolished in March 1949 with the Elysée Agreements, a territorial assembly in Cochinchina voted for union with the Associated State of Vietnam under Bao Dai.

Because there was a good rail system from Saigon to Hanoi, initially the French did not believe there would be much demand for an air route. However, on 10 January 1921, the French governor ﬂew from Hanoi to Saigon on a military plane, ﬂying back soon afterwards. This highlighted to the local administration the possible importance of ﬂights, and the French started to build airﬁelds in many remote locations to allow contact with towns which could not be reached easily beforehand. In 1926 Air Asie was formed, and in December of that year the Société Indochinoise d’Études d’Aviation Commerciale et Postale was established. The latter, based in Saigon, aimed to start commercial ﬂights. However, this did not eventuate, and it was transformed into the Société d’Études et d’Entreprises Aériennes en Indochine et en Extrême Orient (SEAIE), backed by a number of local banks. The ﬁrst international ﬂight from Saigon came on 24 May 1929, when a Schreck ﬂying boat from the Compagnie Aérienne Française ﬂew from Saigon to Hong Kong. Gradually, there were more and more ﬂights, with Lignes d’Orient taking over Air Asie and operating as Air Orient, with the ﬁrst tenday mail service from France to Saigon – the ﬁrst ﬂight being on 17 January 1931. From that year there was a weekly service from Saigon to Hanoi. In 1939 Saigon’s Tan Son Nhut Airport was one of the four fully equipped airports in the French Indochina – those in Hanoi, Vientiane and Vinh being the others. Indeed, the airport at Saigon was so good that it came to ﬁgure in the Japanese planning for their attack on Malaya and planes from there were involved in the attacks on Malaya, and also the crucial sinking of the HMS Prince of Wales and the HMS Repulse on 10 December 1941. The Japanese continued to use the airport for the rest of the war. When the French re-established their colonial rule in Saigon, they secured the airport, which continued to be important in military as well as commercial ﬂights. It became the headquarters of Air Vietnam, which was formed on 1 October 1951, operating ﬂights around South Vietnam after 1954, and also to Phnom Penh, Cambodia; Bangkok, Thailand, and later Hong Kong. The airline became more and more important during the 1960s as the economy of Vietnam boomed, with vast quantities of aid from the US and other countries. Nguyen Tan Trung was the president of Air Vietnam from 1969 until 1975. In 1969, planes from Saigon ﬂew to Quang Duc, Ban Me Thuot, Pleiku, Kon Tum, Hue, Danang, Quang Ngai, Qui Nhon, Tuy Hoa, Nha Trang, Dalat, Phan\n\n12 Aviation\n\nRang, Phan Thiet, Phu Vinh, Can Tho, Ca Mau, Rach Gia and also Quan Phu Quoc. Internationally, there were ﬂights to Osaka and Tokyo in Japan, Taipei, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. There were also international ﬂights with Pan Am, Continental Airlines and Air France. There were also many military aircraft based at Saigon, and planes were regularly used by the Republic of Vietnam against the communists. From the mid-1960s, there were also many US military aircraft based at Saigon, and other airports around the country, as well as US and foreign cargo planes, including the much celebrated Air America. US pilots were involved in cargo ﬂights all over Vietnam, transporting soldiers, materiel and also food supplies. The planes of Air Vietnam had the traditional dragon symbols decorating them, but in 1973 the new Boeing 707–300, bought from Pan American, was painted yellow, with red stripes. R. E. G. Davies wrote that it ‘epitomized the renewed hope that an innovative spirit could salvage something from the ashes of the old…’ However, this hope came to an end when the communists captured Saigon on 30 April 1975, and Air Vietnam ceased to exist. It was not until November 1976 that the ﬁrst domestic commercial ﬂights from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi started again. Until February 1990, the air service was operated by the Ministry of Defence, and was then handed over to the Ministry of Transport and it was called Vietnam Airlines. The increase in tourism in the 1990s led to a major increase in ﬂights – both internal and overseas.

This pagoda, located on Nguyen Trai Street in Cholon, was built in about 1760 by the Cantonese congregation. It was a time when there were large numbers of Chinese settlers in Cholon. It is dedicated to Thien Hau (also known as Tuc Goi La Ba), known as the ‘Lady of the Sea’, who is revered in the southern coastal provinces of China, and as a result in the overseas Chinese communities (most of whom descend from people from those areas). According to legend, she was able to travel over the oceans and through the skies sitting on a mat, and she has been imbued with supernatural powers to save people lost at sea. For this reason she has been very popular with overseas Chinese and with sailors. As well as the Ba Thien Hau Pagoda, the Quan Am Pagoda is also dedicated to her memory. The pagoda was rebuilt, repaired, and enlarged in 1800, 1842, 1882, 1890, and in 1916 – some books cite that some of the major construction took place in 1847. Opening onto Nguyen Trai Street, there is an iron gate and iron railings at the front. The roof has small Chinese porcelain ﬁgures on it. Inside the temple there is a partially covered courtyard with incense burners and also other views of the porcelain ﬁgurines on the roof and around the courtyard. There are three statues of the goddess on the main altar. The main statue of Thien Hau is taken from the pagoda on the 23rd day of the third lunar month each year and paraded around parts of Cholon. Inside the pagoda there is also a large bronze bell, which dates from 1830. It is rung whenever a signiﬁcant donation is made to the temple. The temple is popular with many Chinese tour groups, and there are often people from Hong Kong or Taiwan at the pagoda. References: Klaus H.

When the French took over Cochinchina in the early 1860s, most of the mandarins ﬂed, leaving the French without any experienced ofﬁcials. They quickly turned to Ba Tuong (also known as Ton Tho Thuong). 13\n\n14\n\nBaigaur\n\nHe had failed in his exams to become a mandarin, but some of his family held high ofﬁce, and he was familiar with the administration. He collaborated with the French and in 1863 he was one of those who escorted Phan Thanh Gian to Paris for the re-negotiation of the Treaty of Saigon. References: J.

This bank was established on 19 April 1875 in Paris as a joint-stock company founded with private capital to operate in French territories in Asia. It was involved in issuing banknotes for some of its history. From 1875 until 1888, it operated mainly from Saigon, with its president being Édouard Hentsch; and then from 1889 until 1900 much of its operations were concerned with French businesses in China. From 1900 until the outbreak of the Paciﬁc War, it handled the Boxer Indemnity, the ‘ﬁne’ levied on the Imperial Chinese government and its successors to repay damages incurred during the Boxer Uprising of 1899–1901. Heavily involved in ﬁnancing the trade in rice from Saigon, a convention of 27 February 1921 ensured that the bank returned a proportion of its capital to the French government if the banknotes issued by it exceeded three times its reserves in gold and silver. The Banque de l’Indochine constructed its magniﬁcent headquarters in Saigon in 1930 which is now the location of the National Bank of Vietnam. In 1974 the Banque de l’Indochine merged with the Banque de Suez to form Banque Indosuez. Bought by the Crédit Agricole group, it was Crédit Agricole Indosuez until 2004 when it merged with Crédit Lyonnais to form Calyon.

The emperor of Annam from 1926 until 1945, and the head of state\n\nBao Dai\n\n15\n\nof the State of Vietnam from 13 June 1949 until 21 January 1950; the chief of state of the State of Vietnam, from 14 June 1949 until 30 April 1955, Bao Dai (‘Keeper of Greatness’) had been born on 22 October 1913 at Hue, as Prince Nguyen Van Khai, the third cousin of Emperor Duy Tan. When Duy Tan died in 1916, Bao Dai’s father became Emperor Khai Dinh, spending most of his time in Hue. Bao Dai inherited the throne when he was twelve and then went to school in France. Returning to be crowned in September 1932 and ending the regency of his mother, he came back to Tourane, bypassing Saigon, and decided that he wanted to transform Annam and also Tonkin and Cochinchina. He promised judicial reform and the establishment of a House of Representatives. However, the French prevented him from doing anything and after trying to push through his reforms for some time, he eventually decided not to do anything and resigned himself to life as a playboy. With the Japanese seizing power on 9 March 1945, Bao Dai was forced by them to declare independence on 11 March. The new government ﬂoundered badly, with massive numbers of deaths from starvation. In the August Revolution, the communists captured Bao Dai’s wife and children, and Bao Dai himself was forced to abdicate and become the supreme counsellor to Ho Chi Minh. Bao Dai then left for Hong Kong and then for France, where he spent the next three years. In 1949 the French decided to get Bao Dai to return to Vietnam to take over a pro-French government. Bao Dai, now somewhat remote from political\n\nHarry S. Truman and Bao Dai.\n\n16\n\nBao Luong\n\nmaneuvers, did come back to Vietnam and on 30 June 1949 presided over a new government. However, he refused to live in Saigon because the French high commissioner was living in the Norodom Palace and refused to vacate it. As a result, Bao Dai lived at Dalat and, as the Australian journalist and writer Denis Warner wrote, he ‘preferred the Happy Valley dance halls in Hong Kong, Paris nightclubs and the Cannes casinos to politics’. Graham Greene saw him as ‘an intelligent and subtle man, resolved not to compromise himself, and to survive.’ He also encouraged gambling at Dalat, but for Saigon, the policing was left in the hands of the Binh Xuyen and other gangsters, resulting in great unpopularity there for the ex-emperor. After the Geneva Agreements in 1954, Bao Dai moved to France with his wife and they lived there in splendid exile. His entry in Asia Who’s Who 1957 notes he ‘spends most of time in Europe; married devout Catholic Nam Phuong & renounced polygamy 1934; has 5 children by Nam Phuong; married Chinese dancing girl named Huang 1946 who bore daughter; later took Vietnamese girl Mong Diep for wife who produced daughter 1949, son 1953.’ He died on 31 July 1997 in Paris.

A woman revolutionary, she was born in February 1909 as Nguyen Trung Nguyet, the daughter of Nguyen Van Nham, a farmer from Rach Gia, to the west of Saigon. When she was eighteen, she went to Saigon and took the name Bao Luong (‘Precious Honesty’), staying with members of her extended family. She wrote poetry and contributed to the newspaper Than Chung (‘Morning Bell’). Active in the revolutionary movement, she was related to the wife of Ton Duc Thang and went to Guangzhou (Canton), in southern China, to receive some training. On her return to Saigon, she was involved in a murder at 5 Barbier Street (now Nguyen Phi Khanh Street), Saigon, on the night of 8 December 1928. This killing took place following a complaint by a young female revolutionary that a senior member of the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League called Lang had been pressuring her to become his mistress. Criticised by the members of the league, he threatened to inform on them to the French police. Bao Luong then presided over a meeting when it was decided to kill Lang. This killing took place and Bao Luong was one of those who were arrested in the police dragnet.\n\nBaudouin, François-Marius (1867–1957)\n\n17\n\nThree men, including one of Bao Luong’s cousins, were sentenced to death and executed. She was badly beaten in custody and served eight years in prison – ﬁve for her role in the murder, and three more for ‘rebelliousness’. On her release in 1938, she married the male prison nurse who had looked after her whilst she was in jail. Marriage ended her revolutionary career and she lived quietly, moving to Saigon in 1967. From November 1971 until May 1972, the newspaper Dan Chu Moi (‘New Democracy’) published her account of her actions against the French. She died in September 1976. Her own account, Nguoi con Gai Nam Bo (‘The Girl from the South’) was published in Hanoi in 1996, and eight years later, a second edition was published in Ho Chi Minh City. There is a photograph of her at the Ton Duc Thang Museum in Ho Chi Minh City – it is captioned ‘Vietnam’s ﬁrst female political prisoner’. Her niece, Hue-Tam Ho Tai, the Kenneth T. Young Professor of Sino-Vietnamese history at Harvard University, wrote about her aunt in Passion, Betrayal, and Revolution in Colonial Saigon. A street in Ho Chi Minh City was named after Bao Luong.

He was acting lieutenant governor of Cochinchina from 7 March until 16 December 1872. BATTLE FOR SAIGON (1955). This was the name given to the ﬁghting which took place in Saigon from 27 April until May 1955 between the Vietnamese National Army of the State of Vietnam, and the Binh Xuyen who had been licensed to run the city police by Bao Dai. The background to the ﬁghting started on 29–30 March 1955 when Ngo Dinh Diem ordered the sacking of the Binh Xuyen police chief and sent in the Vietnamese National Army to try to take control. It was part of the struggle by Diem to try to wrest power from the Binh Xuyen and other supporters of Bao Dai. Some of the Americans were also keen on removing Diem, but the US secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, ordered J. Lawton Collins to stop any plans to oppose Diem. This allowed Diem to continue sending in his forces to take over, which saw heavy ﬁghting around the École Petrus Ky in Cholon and other areas. Bay Vien was forced to ﬂee, and as the ﬁghting gradually subsided, a large crowd came into the streets to cheer Diem’s forces.

Acting governor general of French Indochina from April until August 1922, he was born on 31 December 1867, moving to Indochina, and being French résident supérieur in Phnom Penh from 22 October 1914 until 20 January 1927. During this\n\n18\n\nBaugh, Hubert Gordon (1885–1956)\n\ntime he oversaw the opening of the National Museum and an increase in the archaeological work at Angkor by French scholars.

The US consul in Saigon in 1913 and vice and deputy consul in Saigon later that year, he was born on 4 July 1880 in Calcutta, India, the son of Rev. George Baugh, originally from Shropshire, England, and his wife Harriett (née Beauchamp). The family migrated to the United States in October 1885, and Hubert grew up in California, graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1903. Keen on training as a US diplomat, he was posted to China to learn Chinese, before being appointed, in 1908, to be the interpreter at the consulate at Tientsin, and was then vice consul general in Hankow. His sister also moved to China and became a missionary with the Methodist Foreign Mission Board, teaching at Gamewell Girls’ High School in Beijing. He then went to Cochinchina and was initially consul until his retirement on 26 February 1913, being appointed vice and deputy consul on the following day, retiring from that position in January 1914. He then returned to California to become the assistant examiner of the State Civil Service Commission. After World War I, he headed to Europe to undertake secretarial work for the YMCA. Marrying Ruth, Hubert worked as a teacher at Sacramento High School, and helped establish the Sacramento Teachers Credit Union in 1933. Because of ill-health, Hubert Baugh had to resign from his position as secretary/ treasurer. He died on 4 July 1956 in Moore County, Texas.

The leader of the Binh Xuyen, he was born in 1904 in Cholon as Le Van Vien [Lê Văn Vin], his father, Le Van Dau, being Chinese from Chaozhou, and his mother being Vietnamese. Le Van Dau, when he settled in Cholon, became a member of the Tiandihui (‘Heaven and Earth Society’), often called the Triad. His son followed his father into a life of organised crime. Bay Vien became one of the major ﬁgures in the Binh Xuyen and was eventually captured by the\n\nBazin, Marcel (1904/5–1950)\n\n19\n\nFrench around 1940. He was sent to the penal colony on Con Son Island (also known as Poulo Condore). During World War II, the Japanese made contact with the Binh Xuyen and decided that they would be useful in the Japanese plan to end French rule. Bay Vien escaped from prison in early 1945 and when the Japanese staged their coup de force on 9 March 1945, taking over from the French, the Binh Xuyen were amnestied and Bay Vien was given a position in the newly established non-French police administration. In August 1945 the Viet Minh decided that they could form a tactical alliance with the Binh Xuyen, who had access to up to 10,000 men whom they could use to their best advantage. In February 1946, Ba Duong, the head of the leader of the Binh Xuyen, was killed in an air raid by the French, and Bay Vien took control of the movement. He decided to move away from the communists and managed to strike a deal with the French, which gave Bay Vien control over much of Saigon. Bay Vien’s men operated as a police force controlling gambling, narcotics and prostitution, and being able to use the police – largely staffed with Binh Xuyen members – to prevent anybody from impinging on the lucrative sources of income. With Bao Dai as the nominal head of the State of Vietnam unable to exert any form of strong control within the areas he ruled, and with the French keen to ﬁght the communists and prepared to turn a blind eye to organised crime in Saigon, the Binh Xuyen moved to support the French in 1947 and became extremely powerful, effectively controlling Saigon from 1951 until 1955. Bay Vien himself ended up as a general in the Vietnamese National Army of Bao Dai. However, with the accession of Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem, the new government, with the full backing of the United States, decided to destroy the Binh Xuyen. From 28 April until 3 May 1955, in ﬁghting throughout Saigon, the Binh Xuyen members were driven from the city, and without their control of the police and sources of income, their movement quickly fragmented. Bay Vien ﬂed to France and lived in comfortable exile, dying there in 1970.

The head of the Sûreté (police detectives) in Saigon and the deputy chief of police in Cochinchina, he was assassinated by the Viet Minh as he was getting into his car on the morning of 28 April 1950, the shooting being witnessed by Edmund Gullion, the US chargé d’affaires.

The governor general of French Indochina from October 1902 until February 1907, Paul Beau was born on 26 January 1857, the son of a master mariner. He studied law and in May 1880 he joined the French diplomatic service, working in the Foreign Ministry in Paris and then as a diplomat in Rome. A keen Republican, he was sent on a mission to China and in March 1901, took over the post of French minister in Peking from Stephen Pichon, who had survived the Siege of the Peking Legations during the Boxer Uprising. In July 1902, Beau returned to Paris and then moved to Vietnam to take up an appointment as governor general of Indochina, which he held from October 1902 until February 1907. Taking over from Paul Doumer, who had been involved in expanding French control, Beau had been appointed at the instigation of Théophile Delcassé, the minister of foreign affairs, because it was thought he was more diplomatic than Doumer and would not clash with either Siam or China. One of Paul Beau’s main achievements as governor general was in the area of education, with the establishment of the University of Hanoi, and also the Tonkin Free School (Dong Kinh Nghia Thuc). He also created consultative assemblies in Annam and Tonkin. A Freemason, he also toned down some of the anti-clerical legislation being introduced in France when it was applied to Indochina. However, he failed to achieve all he had intended because his time as governor general coincided with a rise in unrest, which led to revolts in Central Vietnam. Returning to France, he was appointed as French minister to Brussels. He died on 14 February 1926 at his home in Paris.\n\nBen Thanh Market\n\n21\n\nReferences: Pascale Bezançon, Une colonization éducatrice: L’expérience indochinoise 1860–1945, Paris: L’Harmattan, 2002; Joseph Buttinger, Vietnam: A Dragon Embattled: Vietnam at War, New York: Praeger, 1967, p. 1218; Charles Fourniau et al., Le contact colonial franco-vietnamien: Le premier demi-siècle, 1858– 1911, Aix-en-Provence: Publications de l’Université de Provence, 1999; Bruce Lockhart and William J.

This is a canal (‘Buffalo Quay Channel’) which runs through southern Saigon and empties into the Saigon River. Since the establishment of Cholon, it was used for bringing supplies between Cholon and Saigon, with much of the trade being controlled by the Chinese, hence its original name, Arroyo Chinois (‘Chinese Canal’). During the French colonial period, the northern bank of the easternmost part of the channel was a place where the French promenaded.

This marketplace in Ho Chi Minh City was one of the major markets in Saigon for several centuries. It is on the site of the original market place where traders met from the seventeenth century. When the French attacked the Saigon Citadel, the market was destroyed, but the French encouraged the traders to return. However, it was destroyed again in a major ﬁre in 1870 and it had to be rebuilt. In 1912 Eugène Cuniac, the mayor of Saigon, decided to construct a new building, which is often called the New Ben Thanh Market, and this is still the location of the market, the main structure – with its small tower and large clock – being renovated in 1985. The French often referred to the market as the ‘Halles centrales’. Until 1940 the market also marked the site of the two main bus stations in Saigon, but they have since been moved. The road around it was known as the Rond Point Cuniac (the Cuniac Roundabout) and is now called the Cu Nhac Circle, one of the few roads which has kept its French name. Near the entrance to the market is the statue to General Tran Nguyen Han [Trn Nguyên Hãn] (d. 1429), the famous military commander who defeated the Chinese Ming invaders.\n\n22\n\nBen Thanh Market\n\nBen Thanh Market in the 1910s.\n\nBen Thanh Market in 1951.\n\nThe market is still very popular with locals, as well as the tourists who go in search of Vietnamese conical hats, basketwork and t-shirts. There is also a section of the market – known as the ‘wet market’ – where ﬁsh, frogs and eels are sold, as well as pigs’ ears, live hens and chickens. Not far from that, there is another part devoted to food stalls.\n\nBenoît de la Grandière, Pierre Paul Marie (1807–1876)\n\n23\n\nReferences: Klaus H.

The French governor of Cochinchina from 16 October 1863 until 5 April 1868 (acting governor until 28 November 1863), Pierre Paul Marie de la Grandière was born on 28 June 1807 at Redon, Ille-et-Vilaine, France, into a family which had served in the marines, his parents being Augustin de La Grandière and Michelle Anne Marie Chaillou de l’Étang. His grandfather, Charles-Marie de la Grandière had served in the American War of Independence. Pierre de la Grandière joined the French Navy in 1827 and served at the Battle of Navarino in Greece on 20 October of that year, when an allied coalition was able to defeat the navy of the Ottoman Empire. He then served in the South Atlantic, being involved in the French blockade of Buenos Aires in 1838–40. He served in the Crimean War and then was involved in the Italian Campaign in 1859, and was posted to the Syrian coast in the following year. On 1 May 1863 de la Grandière was appointed as governor of Cochinchina to succeed Admiral Louis Adolphe Bonard, and took up residence in Saigon. His main task in Saigon was the consolidation of French rule over the provinces of Vinh Long, Chaudoc and Hatien. He was anxious to expand the French colonial empire in Asia and on 11 October 1863 managed to persuade (or force) King Norodom of Cambodia to sign the treaty which led to the French Protectorate over that country. Much of the impetus for his actions seems to have come from Prosper Chasseloup-Laubat, although some of the actions were undoubtedly Benoît de la Grandière acting on his own initiative. Norodom was aware of this and as a result, he decided to negotiate with Thailand before Napoleon III had manaed to ratify the treaty. In 1866, the French decided to intervene more heavily in Asia by sending a naval force to Korea. Benoît de la Grandière remained in Vietnam until 1868. He wrote, ‘I am attached to Cochinchina as to a child of which I took care during an illness and which gave me much concern… Yes, we shall maintain this glory, despite of and against our detractors. Yes, we will guide this colony, slowly perhaps, but with the assurance of its brilliant future. And we shall make ourselves loved and respected by our neighbours, by our Annamite subjects, and what is the most difﬁcult of all, even by our French merchants.’ When he returned to France, he was given the post of maritime prefect at Toulon in 1870. He died on 25 August 1876 at Quimper, in his native Brittany. He was commemorated\n\n24\n\nBideau\n\non two postage stamps issued in French Indochina in 1943–45, and he is the eponym of Canal Bonard in Saigon.

Also known as the Binh Pho – Pho being the Vietnamese noodle soup – this restaurant is famous because during the Vietnam War, the serving of food there was a cover for the place being one of the important communist coordination headquarters in Saigon. In the restaurant the Viet Cong planned their attacks on the US Embassy and many other places in Saigon during the Tet Offensive in 1968. It still remains popular with tourists.

This market – the ‘New Market of Cholon’ – is the major market in Cholon, the overwhelmingly Chinese part of Ho Chi Minh City. The former market, on Nguyen Trai Street, still referred to by some locals as the ‘old market’ [㟞㸫Ꮦ] was destroyed in a ﬁre, which resulted in the construction of the present building on Thap Muoi Street. The original market was a place where many Chinese traders came to sell goods. One of the early major businessmen to make a fortune from it was Quach Dam (1863–1927), and he gradually bought up the land on which the market was located, as he cornered the rice trade. However, that market was destroyed in a ﬁre and the new market building was constructed between 1928 and 1930. There are a variety of goods for sale in the market, including a section devoted to food stalls, usually full of people eating a variety of dishes, and also a ‘wet market’ selling ﬁsh, meat and ﬁsh products.

This was essentially a group of organised crime gangs which came together in the 1920s and were involved in controlling the Saigon underworld, especially in Cholon. They took their name from the village which had once been their headquarters. They included a number of prominent gangsters and crime families who were involved in controlling illegal gambling, narcotics and prostitution, amongst other activities. The French tried unsuccessfully to crack down on the Binh Xuyen, who gradually came to be controlled by Bay Vien. During the period from March until August 1945, the Japanese made use of the Binh Xuyen, who were able to help enforce Japanese rule in a particularly ruthless fashion. During this period, the group developed political goals which included the prevention of the return to French colonial rule. As a result, members of the Binh Xuyen aided the communists in the massacre of 150 French and Franco-Vietnamese civilians in Saigon on 24 September 1945. The French launched attacks on the Binh Xuyen and essentially it also split with the death of the main leader, Ba Duong. This saw the rise of Bay Vien, but the French were nervous about what he might do. Eventually they came to an understanding with Bay Vien and he used the Binh Xuyen against the Viet Minh. Soon afterwards, the Binh Xuyen came to dominate the trucking industry in Vietnam. With the formation of the State of Vietnam, and the realisation that the Vietnamese National Army of Bao Dai might be no match for the Viet Minh unaided, Bao Dai allowed for the Binh Xuyen to be organised as an ‘independent army’. This saw Bay Vien and his commanders being given ranks in the Vietnamese National Army, and it also meant that Bao Dai was able to form the group to control the police. In return, the Binh Xuyen are said to have paid Bao Dai between 24 million and 30 million piasters a year. The rise to power of Ngo Dinh Diem led to moves to destroy the Binh Xuyen and in the Battle for Saigon in 1954 forces loyal to Diem routed the Binh Xuyen. Some of them remained in the South Vietnamese Army, with others joining the communists.

This skyscraper, also known as the Financial Tower, was built between 2007 and 2010, being\n\n26\n\nBlanchard de la Brosse, Paul Marie Alexis Joseph (1872–19 )\n\nopened on 31 October 2010 and remains the tallest building in Ho Chi Minh City, being 262.5 metres (861 feet) tall, surpassing the Saigon Trade Center. Work started on the Financial Tower with the site being marked out in September 2005, and it was the tallest building in Vietnam until January 2011, when the Keangnam Hanoi Landmark Tower was completed. The tower has some 100,000 square meters of space, and it was designed by the architects from Carlos Zapata Studio, developed by the Bitexco Group. Leslie E. Robertson Associates were the structural engineers, winning an Excellence in Structural Engineering Award in December 2011 from the US-based National Council of Structural Engineers Associations. BLANCHARD de la BROSSE, PAUL MARIE ALEXIS JOSEPH (1872–19 ). Born on 24 July 1872, he started work in Indochina on 20 January 1902 and was the administrator of Kwangchowan in 1922 and again from 1925 until 1926. He was then governor of Cochinchina from 1926 until 1929. He retired on 17 July 1934. The Musée Blanchard de la Brosse in Saigon was named after him. It is now the Museum of Vietnamese History.

A politician, he was born in 1834 at Gap, in the southeast of France. He trained for the priesthood but then changed and studied law, working at Marseilles until 1863, when he moved to Cochinchina. There he continued to practise law, and also established Le Réveil d’Orient, the ﬁrst Masonic lodge in Saigon, in part to counter the increasing inﬂuence of the Roman Catholic Church. Running the newspaper Le Mékong, he continually attacked the power of the governors which, he argued, should be held in check by an elected Colonial Council which had wider powers, especially in terms of the ﬁnances. In 1874, he became the acting mayor of Saigon, holding that position until 1876, and in 1879, he was elected mayor of Saigon, holding that position until 1880. Blancsubé wanted a member of the French National Assembly to represent Cochinchina, and when this position was created, he was duly elected, holding the seat until his death in 1888. His seat in the National Assembly was subsequently held by Charles Le Myre de Vilers. In 1886 Blancsubé wrote, ‘the vitality of this Cochinchine which I love with passion, which we all want great and prosperous, which we all aspire to see become a useful auxiliary to France.’ He also wrote a number of books.

A French journalist, Lucien Bodard was born on 9 January 1914 in Chongqing, China, his father being Albert Bodard, the french consul in Shanghai and a few other Chinese cities. He went to school in France, becoming a journalist by 1944. Posted to Asia, he covered the Chinese Civil War and then the First Indochina War. Based in Saigon, he developed a very good understanding of the complexities of political machinations in the city during the war, and also continued to write during the presidency of Ngo Dinh Diem. His most famous book is The Quicksand War: Prelude to Vietnam. He later wrote a four-volume history of the First Indochina War, and then some novels. He died on 2 March 1998 in Paris.

The high commissioner of French Indochina from 1 April 1947 until 11 October 1948, Émile Bollaert was born on 13 November 1890 in Dunkirk, France, and was educated at the Lycée Faidherbe in Lille. He then went to Paris to study law and in 1913 started working for the local government authorities in northern France. A second lieutenant of the Alpine Chasseurs during World War I, he then went to work in the Loire. After holding a number of positions in the local government, he then served with distinction in the resistance during World War II. Captured by the Germans, he survived the war, becoming a member of the Radical Socialist Party and being a deputy in the French National Assembly. Following the recall of Thierry d’Argenlieu, he became high commissioner of French Indochina, in spite of only having experience in the French local government administration. However, unlike his predecessor, he was able to compromise and he was involved in negotiations between the French and Bao Dai to achieve what was known as the ‘Bao Dai solution’, which in turn resulted in the formation of the Stat"
