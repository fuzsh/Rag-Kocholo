        "text": "Hồ Chí Minh (; Vietnamese: [hò cǐ mīŋ̟] (listen), Saigon: [hò cǐ mɨ̄n] (listen); Chữ nôm: 胡志明; 19 May 1890 – 2 September 1969), born Nguyễn Sinh Cung, also known as Nguyễn Tất Thành, Nguyễn Ái Quốc, Bác Hồ (\"Uncle Ho\") or simply Bác (\"Uncle\"), was a Vietnamese revolutionary and politician. He served as Prime Minister of North Vietnam from 1945 to 1955 and then its President from 1945 to 1969. Ideologically a Marxist-Leninist, he served as Chairman and First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Vietnam. Hồ Chí Minh led the Việt Minh independence movement from 1941 onward, establishing the Communist-ruled Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 and defeating the French Union in 1954 at the battle of Điện Biên Phủ. He officially stepped down from power in 1965 due to health problems. After the war, Saigon, the former capital of the Republic of Vietnam, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. He was a key figure in the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1945 at the Ba Dinh Square in Hanoi as well as the People's Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. Any description of Hồ Chí Minh's life before he came to power in Vietnam is necessarily fraught with ambiguity. He is known to have used at least 50 and perhaps as many as 200 pseudonyms. Both his place and date of birth are subjects of academic debate since neither is known with certainty. At least four existing official biographies vary on names, dates, places and other hard facts while unofficial biographies vary even more widely.\n\nMarguerite Donnadieu, known as Marguerite Duras (French: [maʁ.ɡə.ʁit dy.ʁas]; 4 April 1914 – 3 March 1996), was a French novelist, playwright, screenwriter, essayist, and experimental filmmaker. Her script for the film Hiroshima mon amour (1959) earned her a nomination for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards. Born in French Indochina, to two teachers (immigrants from France), growing up in Indochina. She was sent to France before World War II (to continue her education), and experienced that war as a young woman in occupied France.\n\nKe Huy Quan (born August 20, 1971), also known as Jonathan Ke Quan (/kiːˈkwɑːn/), is a Vietnamese-born Chinese-American actor. Quan played Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and Data in The Goonies (1985). Following roles in the sitcom Head of the Class (1991) and film Encino Man (1992), he stopped acting due to a lack of opportunities and obtained a film degree from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. He went on to work as a stunt coordinator and assistant director. Quan returned to acting in 2021. For his role as a naïve husband navigating the multiverse in the science fiction film Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), he received acclaim and won many accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor."
