        "text": "Most studies of Vietnam under the Diệm regime conceive it as a stepping stone of American nation-building efforts, citing Diệm's political approach as being influenced by modern, Western, and specifically American democratic concepts and by his associations with American advisers. Such studies assumed that the regime existed within this bubble, isolated from the past and from the society that it aimed to rule and shape. By contrast, this study contends that the regime was more deeply rooted in the enduring Vietnamese pre- and colonial history and in the post-1954 socio-political milieus, the defining components of which were intrinsically woven into the fabric of the Ngô nation. In its early years, the Republic of Vietnam (1955–63), led by the Ngô family and supporters, attempted to define itself as a nation incontestably heir to its pre-colonial past, while being increasingly conditioned by anti-communist and pro-Catholic patrimonialism. The 1956 commemoration of its 26 October National Day, the focus of the present analysis, provides insights into the values that essentially defined the Ngô’s nation—an entity far different from what its American godfathers had envisioned.\n\n43 Dr Trần Kim Tuyến headed the ‘Service des Etudes Politiques et Sociales’ (SEPES), ‘the national intelligence and counterespionage service which can, at Nhu's direction, conduct clandestine political and propaganda activities for the Can Lao Party’.

Đỗ Mậu, issued from a Confucian family, met Diệm in 1942 in Huế, was appointed head of Military Intelligence in the Republic—a post that he retained until the 1963 coup, in which he participated.

Ngô Đình Thục (1897–1984) was ordained bishop in 1938 in Phủ Cam, Central Vietnam. He had a decisive political and religious influence on Diệm and Nhu, and contributed to their rise to power through his national and international Catholic networks. Thục oversaw a ‘Personalist Training Center’ in his diocese of Vĩnh Long province, meant to instruct cadres in the doctrine formulated by Nhu. As he became archbishop in Huế in 1960, Thục and his brother Cẩn were to transform Central Vietnam into a quasi-fief that attracted ambitious local politicos and eager-to-please military officers. A polarizing figure, Thục played no small role in igniting the Buddhist crisis of 1963, which culminated in the regime's overthrow.

The Hòa Hảo movement (named after the village whence it issued in 1939), founded by the ‘Buddha Master’, Huỳnh Phú Sổ, is part of the popular messianic phenomenon derived from Buddhism which emerged in the western Mekong Delta in the 1920s. It evolved into a significant political and military force, as did the rival religious-political organization of the Cao Đài (Elevated Altar). The latter, founded in the 1920s in Tây Ninh province, was inspired by Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism, as well as by French figures such as Victor Hugo and Joan of Arc. Its temples are distinguished by a Masonic-inspired symbol of a triangulated left eye. Bình Xuyên forces, also named for the region of their origin, issued in the 1920s from armed groups of outlaws in the Mekong Delta, derived their resources from highway robberies, piracy, gambling, and so on. Members were not, for all that, devoid of national sentiment, and some factions joined the Việt Minh in the anti-French struggle; others were integrated into the French-backed Vietnamese National Army (VNA).

Along with the national anthem, the government disseminated another song, Suy Tôn Ngô Tổng Thống [Praise to President Ngô]. This ode to Diệm, ‘with the entire Vietnamese people standing behind President Ngô’, was regularly performed in public places such as schools, theatres, and so on. This author remembers that moviegoers, under cover of darkness, delighted in twisting one of the lines, Ngô Tổng Thống muôn năm into Tô Hủ Tiếu Muôn Năm: ‘Long Live President Ngô’ became ‘Long Live the Bowl of Noodle Soup!’.\n\n91 Cường Để had expressed the wish to have his ashes deposited at the Holy See in Tây Ninh, as the Cao Đài were among his ‘most loyal supporters’. The urn, flown back from Japan, was greeted with full military honours on 12 October 1954. However, to deny the Cao Đài added prestige, the ashes were removed to Huế in 1957.
