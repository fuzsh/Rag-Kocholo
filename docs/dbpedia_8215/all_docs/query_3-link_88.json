        "text": "This article aims to trace the evolution of the Republic of Vietnam-France relationship from a frosty relationship to friendship over the course of the Vietnam War (1968-1975). The author employed archival documents of the former Republic of Vietnam housed at the National Archives Center II, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam as well as a wide range of derivative research to periodize two phases of this tie. While maintaining a strong influence of the French in South Vietnam, South Vietnamese leaders of this country lost official contact with France since the pullout of the French troops in 1956. This relationship plummeted to the bottom in 1965 due to the decolonial policy of Ngo Dinh Diem and the no-nonsense intervention of the US in Vietnam. However, South Vietnamese leaders made an attempt to break the ice with France when this country was culled for the Paris peace talk conference avenue in 1968. The relationship underwent a rapprochement from 1968 to 1973 with a series of advantageous statements from France. As soon as the withdrawal of the US, France continued to keep up a correspondence with the Republic of Vietnam and rescued this country from Communist sabotage and impetuous and flagrant violations. However, the about-face of international relations with the Sino-American détente and a serious decrease in foreign aid brought this relationship to an end after the Fall of Saigon in 1975.\n\nWith the Geneva talks and its likely outcome, a change of power in South Viet Nam was needed. It was necessary to find a Prime Minister appropriate to the new situation because he would have to review everything, to build, to rebuild, and to be prepared in front of a militarily and ideologically powerful North. Even if the final decision on his choice was up to the head of state Bảo Đại, France and the United States had their say. For France, it was necessary to preserve the property of the French settled for decades, as well as the French culture brought to the country since the beginning of colonization. For the Americans who held the purse strings, the new government had to respond to their desire to contain the expansion of communism, the only objective that led them to take an interest in this distant country.\n\nMany have heard of the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 which put an end, for the Vietnamese, to the war of independence they had waged since 1858 against the French colonizers, and for the French, to the Indochina War, which began in 1945 to recover the Indochina lost to the Japanese on March 9, 1945. Few, however, know the true content. The following text, which presents this conference, is an excerpt from my book \"Vietnam - The Political History of the Two Wars - War of Independence (1858-1954) and Ideological War or North-South (1945-1975)\", prefaced by the historian Pierre Brocheux and published by Editions Nombre 7 in 2020 in France.\n\nThe Indochina War was the one that France led from 1945 to 1954 in Laos, Cambodia and Việt Nam, the three countries that formed \"Indochina\" when it still dominated them. The three countries had fallen into the hands of France as it advanced in the conquest of their territories in 1858 - with the attack of Đà Nẳng (Việt Nam) which it called Tourane-to the creation of the Indochinese Union by the decrees of 17 and 20 October 1887. It was then composed of Việt Nam-divided into three kỳ (regions or countries, kỳ meaning flag), Cochinchina in the south, Annam in the centre and Tonkin in the north - and Cambodia and was administered by a Governor-General of Indochina (GGI). Cochinchina was a colony ruled by a governor while the other three parties were protectorates each managed by a \"superior resident\". The Laotian protectorate established in 1893 and the 1300 km2 Kouang Tcheou Wan (or Guangzhouwan) 广州湾 territory in South China with a 99-year lease signed in 1898 were later added to this Indochinese Union."
