Discover the stories behind the artifacts, the struggles and triumphs of the people, and the enduring spirit that defines this remarkable ethnicity.\n\n6 Museums in Ho Chi Minh City you shouldn't miss\n\n1. Ho Chi Minh City’s Museum of Fine Arts\n\nFew steps away from our Silverland Ben Thanh Hotel, Ho Chi Minh City’s Museum of Fine Arts is worth a visit to view some of the country’s best relics from Cham and Oc Eo cultural eras. You can find some similar pieces of statues from our private impressive collection, which are exhibited permanently in The Myst Dong Khoi Hotel’s lobby.\n\nContemporary art in the museum is divided into two periods of time: from the beginning of the twentieth century to 1975 and from 1975 to the present. Here, you can find a number of modern paintings by famous artists in Vietnam such as Nguyen Gia Tri, Diep Minh Chau, Do Quang Em, and Trinh Cung, as well as in the world in these two periods of time. The paintings and sculptures are mostly about the daily life of Vietnamese people as well as the beauty of famous landscapes of Vietnam.\n\nThe building itself, where the museum of fine arts is located, carries its own story. The building was constructed in 1929 and inaugurated in 1934. The original owner of the building was a Chinese-born businessman named Hua Bon Hoa, one of the wealthiest traders in the South of Vietnam in colonial times. He was also the owner of many other constructions such as Tu Du Hospital, Majestic Hotel, and Emergency Center of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nThe museum is a three-storeyed construction, built in the style of Art-deco architecture, an architectural style that harmonises the most quintessential values ​​from the Asian and European fine arts schools.
