        "meta_description": "Dr. Nguyen Quoc Quan is a Vietnamese-born American mathematics researcher and human rights activist and a member of the leadership committee of the anti-communist organization Viet Tan. He was detained on April 17, 2012, after arriving at Tan Son Nhat airport in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. On April 28, 2012, Vietnam's state media reported the \"pro-democracy activist\" has been arrested and accused of organizing \"terrorism\" activities. Previously, Dr Quan was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam on a trip on November 17, 2007, for preparing pro-democracy flyers. During that first trip, he brought in a Vietnamese translation of the book From Dictatorship to Democracy about nonviolent resistance.\nHe stood trial in Vietnam on May 13, 2008, on charges of \"terrorism\" and was sentenced to 6 months in prison. He was eventually released on May 17, 2008, and returned to his home in Elk Grove, California, to his wife and two teenage sons. In 2012, he was re-arrested on another trip to Vietnam, and held in prison for 9 months. Following intense US pressure, he was deported on January 30, 2013.",
