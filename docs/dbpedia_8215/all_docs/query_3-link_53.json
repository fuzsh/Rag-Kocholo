Personally, this experience meant 2 practical changes to me: 1) I became open to change in almost every aspect of my life. When you are far away from home, in a culturally different country, you will always be changing and optimizing day-to-day life. I believe I’m a very adaptative individual towards corporate and entrepreneurial life today because I opened my mind. 2) Critical Thinking: when you are exposed during a whole year/semester to be comparing the good/the bad /the worse of your country towards your host country and viceversa, you definitively develop a critical point of view. Just inagine how lucky you are if you have 3 or more experiences living overseas. I recommend to anyone looking for inspiration, motivation and becoming a better version of themselves.\n\nANNOUNCEMENT| Round table Webinar| AAJS African Association for Japanese Studies is delighted to invite you to a roundtable webinar themed “Glocalization, Migration and African Scholarship: Exploring the Japan Paradigm” on Saturday, 24th of February 2024, 17:00 WAT on Twitter Spaces (https://lnkd.in/dT7_Pkdr) Tune in to hear five brilliant and highly anticipated young speakers at home and in the diaspora speak on: 1.

Germany recognises the role that foreign cultural and educational policy can play within a society and its cultural heritage 🏛️. Showing a strong commitment to taking responsibility for its role in #colonialism, Germany 🇩🇪 reached an agreement with Nigeria 🇳🇬 on the momentous return of the “Benin Bronzes” which were looted from West Africa during the colonial era in July 2022. Germany’s programme to preserve cultural assets has helped preserve manuscripts from Timbuktu in Mali 🇲🇱, providing 90m euros to over 3600 projects between 1981 and 2021 in 40 years.

Célébrons La Langue, La Culture et la Littérature Française. 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷 20th March is the International Francophonie Day 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷 Story behind the specific date: The date of March 20 was chosen to celebrate the anniversary of the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation (ACCT) that was born on March 20, 1970 in Niamey, Niger. This agency marks the first step towards Francophone cooperation, which will become the International Organization of La Francophonie a little later. The French language has always had an important place among languages. First a symbol of culture and creativity, it was then a vector of democracy and humanism, values that UNESCO intends to promote. UNESCO loves, speaks and promotes French - one of its 6 official languages and one of its 2 working languages. But more broadly UNESCO celebrating the Francophonie celebrates the cultural and linguistic diversity that makes up the world. Celebrating La Francophonie is recognizing the potential of language and culture to unite people, to create spaces of solidarity and mutual understanding, to reflect together on our common future. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Organization of La Francophonie (OIF) share this common vision that places culture and language at the heart of any lasting effort for peace. and development.\n\n[TUOI TRE NEWSPAPER - SPRING EDITION 2024] 📌 INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION: CATAPULTING VIETNAM'S EDUCATION IN THE ERA OF INTEGRATION In an interview with Tuoi Tre, Mr. J.
