        "text": "He was the grandson of Supreme Emperor Tran Thai To (ThÃ¡i ThÆ°á»£ng HoÃ ng Tráº§n ThÃ¡i Tá»); the nephew of King Tran Thai Tong (Tráº§n ThÃ¡i TÃ´ng); son of the Peaceful king Tran Lieu (Tráº§n Liá» u), the uncle as well as father-in-law of King Tran Nhan Tong (Tráº§n NhÃ¢n TÃ´ng). He devoted his life to supporting the four Kings of the Tran Dynasty, making significant contributions the three times to repel the Chinese invaders from Vietnam and defend the country, secure the people, and create and protect the cause of the Tran dynasty. He left behind many Works on the military, political, literary ... most significantly, there are two sets of books of the great value passed down to posterity, including Military Briefing Books (Binh ThÆ° Yáº¿u LÆ°á»£c) - in 4 volumes and Van Kiep Confidential Books (Váº¡n Kiáº¿p TÃ´ng BÃ­ Truyá»n ThÆ°) including two (2) volumes: the Upper book teaches military operations, economics, military maneuvers, exercises and physiognomy; the Lower book teaches horoscopes, feng shui, military mechanics, strategy, general control, defend the country, township, and serving people. Many people have received his teachings from the Brief Military book and the Upper Van Kiep Confidential Book. However, the Lower volume of Van Kiep, only his descendants can possess and receive.\n\nIn 1300, after retiring in Van Kiep, he died of old-aged disease. Before leaving the world, he arranged for his family to flee to avoid the court's eyes and the pursuit of the enemies of the North. In the 14th century, the Patriarch Tran Thuong (Tráº§n ThÆ°á»£ng), the main branch of the Holy Imperial Duke Tran, made the merit of establishing Truc Lam village in Huong Tra district, Thua Thien Hue province. Because it was necessary to recruit more workers and farmers from outside to go into the village, he changed the surname from TRAN to DAO. According to Ancestors advice, he did not allow his children to study, not taking exams, to protect the safety of the clan's origin. The lineage of the Patriarch Tran Thuong passed down to Long Live Man Dao Khuong (ÄÃ o KhÆ°Æ¡ng), who lived to 103 years old when the Vietnamese Communists shelled Truc Lam village on Lunar New Year in 1968 (Táº¿t Máº­u ThÃ¢n), killing him. Long Live Man Dao Khuong had eight (8) sons who were very handsome, rugged, stronger than ordinary people, good at farming and ploughing, so the villagers called Eight Fairies (BÃ¡t TiÃªn). One of the Eight Fairies, Mr. Dao The, had to leave the village to study temporarily, and passed exams, becoming Mr. One, one of the first paratroopers' officers of the Vietnamese National Army, the Chief Commander of Khai Dong (KhÃ¡i ÄÃ´ng), Hoa Phat, Hoa Tuong, Hoa Khanh, Hoa Vang (HÃ²a PhÃ¡t, HÃ²a TÆ°á»ng, HÃ²a KhÃ¡nh, HÃ²a Vang) district, and the Paracel Islands. The third son of Mr. Dao The is PRESIDENT DAO MINH QUAN, whom the compatriots and the Constitution of the Third Republic of Vietnam have honored as the IMPERIAL DUKE.\n\nIn addition, Vietnamese people always remember the First Grand Duke Nguyen Trai, who, after helping King Le Thai To (LÃª Lá»£i) to drive out the Ming army, he retired to Lychee Garden (Lá» Chi ViÃªn). Grand Duke Nguyen Trai was the author of the national book Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu (BÃ¬nh NgÃ´ Äáº¡i CÃ¡o). The most crucial factor in creating the victory for the Lam Son uprising, establishing the Late Le dynasty with the element of the country's position - the hearts of the people: \"To ensure peace for the people, such as the essence of humanity and justice. To eliminate violence, such as the primary aim of our soldiers.\" He was the general who introduced the strategy and method of Vietnam's first Political Warfare by using grease written on the leaves of trees to create the word \"Le Loi is the King, Nguyen Trai is the General\" to win the hearts of people and defeat the enemy's mentality, thus helping King Le Thai To to defeat the Ming army from invading our country and rebuild the Vietnamese nation's fortunes. When King Le Thai Tong visited the former General Nguyen Trai and suddenly died, leading to the Lychee Garden case in 1442, causing the three generations of Nguyen Trai to suffer unjust deaths. Nguyen Trai's fourth wife, Mrs. Pham Thi Man, was pregnant with a drop of Nguyen Trai's blood at that time, escaped to Thanh Hoa and gave birth to a boy child, and has passed down to the 18th generation of Nguyen Trai, who was Duke Nguyen Huu Bai (PhÆ°á»c MÃ´n Quáº­n CÃ´ng Nguyá» n Há»¯u BÃ i) born in 1863. He was a man of integrity, famous for his phrase \"Exile the King without Kha, dig the King's grave without Bai\", talking about the two loyal Officials of the Nguyen Dynasty who would rather lose their positions and lives than to follow the French's orders to betray their Kings. The first was Mr. Ngo Dinh Kha (NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Kháº£), the father of the late President Ngo Dinh Diem (NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Diá»m), who did not agree to sign the sentence of the exile of King Thanh Thai (ThÃ nh ThÃ¡i); The second person, Nguyen Huu Bai, refused to sign the sentence of digging the tomb of King Tu Duc (Tá»± Äá»©c). Their patriotism loyal reputation continues to this day. Mr. Nguyen Huu Bai had a cousin, Mr. Nguyen Van Than (Nguyá» n VÄn ThÃ¢n), a famous railway engineer, who was instrumental in establishing the North-South railway and the Highway from Saigon (SaÌi GoÌn) to Phnom Penh that the whole country is using. Mr. Nguyen Van Than had a third son, Doctor Nguyen Van Man (Nguyá» n VÄn Máº«n), who is the godson of the late President Ngo Dinh Diem, the only Vietnamese to be the valedictorian in surgery at the Sorbonne Medical University-France, and also the only Vietnamese to receive the honor of being the Director of this most famous French Sorbonne hospital. The eldest daughter of Mr. Nguyen Van Than is Ms. Nguyen Thi Hanh (Nguyá» n Thá» Háº¡nh), self-proclaimed Hanh Nguyen (Háº¡nh NguyÃªn), the owner of the Hanh Nguyen Lacquerware Union, the most famous female businesswoman in the lacquer industry in the South. Who had pioneered in rebuilding the lacquer industry and reclamation of plantations, exploiting in the cultivation of sumac in Lam Dong (LÃ¢m Äá»ng) to replace the type of Thai lacquer used by the whole country today, she is the mother of IMPERIAL DUKE DAO MINH QUAN.\n\nMr. Dao Minh Quan is a descendant of two famous royal and loyalist clans of Vietnam. He was born in 1952 in Thi Nghe (Thá» NghÃ¨) village, Gia Dinh (Gia Äá»nh) province. According to the Astrologist Nhan Quang (NhÃ¢n Quang) and Astrologic Astronomical Method of Truc Lam geography based on the date of birth of Imperial Duke Dao Minh Quan, he was born at the time of the Zodiac, the day, month and the year of the Dragon. It is an inheritance of an authentic life of the FOUR DRAGONS - THE GREAT FLOOD (Tá»¨ LONG Äáº I Há»NG THá»¦Y). This happens to only one person in 600 years. It is a zodiac sign and Horoscope, and the stars surround that by the stars: Right & Left Assistants (TaÌ PhuÌ HÆ°Ìu BÃ¢Ì£t), Blessing Star (ThiÃªn LÆ°Æ¡ng), Minister Star (ThiÃªn TÆ°Æ¡Ìng), Celestial Life (ThiÃªn ThoÌ£), Power Star (ThÃ¢Ìt SaÌt), Tycoon (TÆ°Æ¡Ìng QuÃ¢n), Fortune (HoÌa LÃ´Ì£c), Seigneur (HoÌa QuyÃªÌn). According to the Horoscope, such a person is kind and gentle and escapes from all calamities. Those who go by His side are affected by this blessing. This is the destiny of the Real Emperor, a gentle and virtuous King who saves Vietnam and is the richest man in the world.\n\nEight hundred (800) years after the death of Holy Tran, Heavenly blessing has gathered enough for the Son of God to once again come to earth, bringing peace and happiness to the Vietnamese people and directing humanity to worldly peace. It is the direct descendant of Holy Tran, Mr. Dao Minh Quan, Imperial Duke, the Third President of the Republic of Vietnam. Furthermore, this event was prophesied and handed down from the Thunder Book - Heavenly Letter, 500 years ago:\n\nThe evil power will be disbanded\n\nThe DAO flag will then march jollity\n\nMINH QUAN is the name written on it\n\nBorrowing the destiny to reincarnate from the Three Realms.\n\nWho were the previous Stars from Heavens?\n\nThis life will receive the light to be enlightened â¦\n\nIMPERIAL DUKE DAO MINH QUAN has the world-class talent to govern the state and help humanity, including politics, military, civil and business. He is the only person who owns and has been taught about the Lower Van Kiep Secret Book, applying tactics to defeat the communists, as evidenced by the long journey written in the blood and sweat of the Vietnamese people, who accompanied him throughout 53 years ago can be verified at any time that it is true. He won the hearts of the people through his life of dedication to his people. Wherever he went, he left a mark of peace and humanity. Because He followed theistically, he is loved and protected by heaven and earth and lives in the hearts of people, not only Vietnamese people but also the international community. He advocated a long-term national policy in the way of mind and heart, using justice, love and truth to save the country - pacify the world, Regain Ancestral Land - End Populace Suffering. This is the path of peace that any country leader would want to walk alongside, and every citizen would wish to live in His Kingdom.\n\nHe is the Leader who wins the heart of God and the people that Vietnam has been fortunate to have. Vietnam is filled with blessings and luck!\n\nTRAN LE THUONG\n\nThe Right Man\n\nHard ships test people in their most vulnerable states. Some come out strong, whereas others give up under pressure. But the ones who put on a brave face and handle all the tough times are the real heroes. These lion-hearted people have the potential to achieve anything they are determined of and do anything they have set their focus on. Such is the case of President ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢n.\n\nPresident ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢nâs work has been recently covered by different news platforms, online and on TV, negatively. His cause of liberating Vietnam and making it a democratic country has been brought him under a bad impression. Growing up in a democratic country, the United States of America, QuÃ¢nalways was close to his roots. Although away from his country, he kept himself updated on all the news and happenings in Vietnam.\n\nAs he lived a liberal life in the States, he wished that his countryâs people experienced the same too. This was a burning desire in his heart that he could not extinguish. He was so driven by the cause to bring happiness to his countryâs people that he joined various Vietnamese patriotic organizations. Sir ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢nwas endowed with intelligence, every move and action of his resulted in success. From business and to active participation in political campaigns and movements, he was acing throughout.\n\nSoon Sir ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢n became a prominent person in the Vietnamese community and in the United States business community. As he frequently traveled to different countries, like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, among others, he had the opportunity to interact with many business and international politicians and influential personalities. America recognized him for his merit in serving the community. He was invited to Host Committee for the Republican Party in 1990, a rare position. Since his intentions were clear and pure, he was recognized by politicians globally for his heart, desire, and intention to dissolve communism and save Vietnam.\n\nEverything good comes at a price; one can never achieve something until they sacrifice something of equal value. Similarly, Sir ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢n had to sacrifice his peace to brighten the lives of the people of his country. His efforts to liberate Vietnam were signified as terrorist activities by the national and international media alike. He was labeled as a man who incited terrorism and distorted the undertakings of the policies of Vietnam. But he did not let these rumors overwhelm him. Sir ÄÃ o Minh QuÃ¢n is a man of vision. The goal of setting his country free from the realms of the government had long been set, and he was on the right path to make it come true. He kept moving forward with a high spirit which has resulted in the position he has gained today. At present, there is no other Vietnamese politician with such remarkable international influence."
