        "text": "EXPLORING THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF LEARNING AND RESPECT FOR TALENT THROUGH THE DOCTORAL STELES OF THE 1442 EXAMINATION\n\nOn the stele inscribed with the names of the doctoral laureates from the 1442 examination, there is a commemorative inscription composed by Thân Nhân Trung, the Academician. This inscription provides information about the tradition of valuing education and elevating talented individuals.\n\nOur country's monarchical period saw the early recognition of talent for the country's development, a tradition that began with the Lý Dynasty. This underscores the long-standing tradition of valuing education and talent in Vietnam. Those who passed the exams enjoyed many benefits from the court. To encourage learning and respect for talent, on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month of the 15th year of the Hồng Đức era (1484), King Lê Thánh Tông issued a decree to erect doctoral steles at Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám. The first examination to have its laureates' names inscribed was the Nhâm Tuất examination of the Đại Bảo 3rd year (1442) during the reign of King Lê Thái Tông.\n\nThe inscription on the stele provides valuable information about the 1442 examination (under King Lê Thái Tông), such as 450 candidates participated in the Hội examination, 33 were selected as doctoral laureates (including three in the top ranks, seven in the second rank, and 23 in the third rank); examiners and judges were all high-ranking officials and renowned scholars such as World Cultural Celebrity Nguyễn Trãi, Minister Lê Văn Linh, Secretariat Chancellor Nguyễn Mộng Tuân, and teacher of Quốc Tử Giám Nguyễn Tử Tấn.\n\nThe inscription on the stele reveals the numerous royal favors bestowed upon the doctoral laureates after passing the examination: “His Majesty conferred on them various honorary titles to distinguish them from commoners, bestowed on them ceremonial costumes and headwear to embellish themselves, invited them to a Royal banquet held in the Royal Garden, and granted them horses to carry them back to their homeland. Confucian scholars and the population of the capital city gathered outside the Royal Palace to admire the laureates and lauded His Majesty for his rarely-seen veneration for Confucianism.”\n\nAdditionally, the inscription highlights the importance of talent: \" Virtuous and talented men are the primordial vitality of a State. If the vitality is strong, the State will be powerful and prosperous. On the contrary, it will weaken and have a low standing. Therefore, clear-sighted monarchs always attach importance to educating talent and selecting Confucian scholars for the Mandarinate, and regard the fostering of the State's primordial vitality as an urgent task. Since Confucian scholars are so important to the nation, they are always held in great esteem; they are honored with titles, distinctions and dignities. Yet, all this is not enough! Their names are made known at Swallow Tower and their dignities are publicized on the Dragon-Tiger Board, not to mention the Royal banquet. The Court does everything possible to glorify the talent it has discovered via Royal exams.\"\n\nAfter 560 years, the doctoral steles still stand the test of time, underscoring their enduring significance in commemorating the nation's history and honoring its notable figures. The doctoral laureates whose names are inscribed on these steles were all notable figures who contributed significantly to the nation. First Laureate Nguyễn Trực from Bối Khê village, Thanh Oai district, Ứng Thiên prefecture, who served as Principal of Quốc Tử Giám and was highly respected by the Ming court during his diplomatic missions. The Second Laureate of this examination, Nguyễn Như Đổ from Duyên Hà village, Thanh Trì district, Hanoi, also served as Principal of Quốc Tử Giám. Third Laureate Lương Như Hộc from Hồng Liễu village, Trường Tân district, Hải Dương province (now Thanh Liễu village, Gia Lộc district, Hải Dương province), was the first to teach woodblock printing to the people of his home villages Liễu Tràng and Hồng Lục. Doctoral laureate Ngô Sĩ Liên from Chúc Sơn village, Chương Đức district (now Chương Mỹ district, Hanoi), was a historian who significantly contributed to compiling the 15-volume Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư. He also held the position of Dean of Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nThe information inscribed on the doctoral steles of the 1442 examination shows that education and talent cultivation have always been imperative in every era.\n\nLH\n\nTHE EXCERPT FROM THE DOCTORAL THESIS STONE INSCRIPTION IN EXAM FIELD 1631\n\nIn 1484, King Lê Thánh Tông ordered the carving of stone tablets inscribed with the names of scholars to honor those who passed exams and educated students. This was one of the unique features of the doctoral thesis stone inscriptions placed at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám in Thăng Long, Hanoi.\n\nThe dedication of the scholars to their country when they are valued by the court is highlighted in the inscription of the doctoral thesis in 1631, compiled by Mậu lâm lang Hàn lâm viện hiệu thảo Trịnh Cao Đệ. The inscription: “The Confucians whose names appear on this stone stele should strive for honesty, righteousness and industriousness, ward off greediness and envy, be loyal to His Majesty and benefit the populace. Within the Court, they should be impartial and upright enough to warm against wickedness. Outside the Court, they should carry out proper policies to satisfy the people’s wishes. By doing so, they will not betray the Court’s favor or betray their own aspiration to help His Majesty and to benefit people.”\n\nThe meaning of this excerpt shows us the responsibility of scholars towards the nation when they are valued by the court. It emphasizes that they must always have a sense of learning, self-improvement, and dedication to the country, for the people and the nation. This dedication helps individuals transcend their personal ego, selfishness, and greed to strive for greater good. Those who have a sense of responsibility towards their homeland will be individuals with love, compassion, and high self-discipline. They must live up to the trust of the court and the affection of the people.\n\nThese inscriptions not only serve as encouragement, motivation, and education for scholars but also educate future generations. The young generation of our nation is continuously absorbing knowledge, refining their intellect, and cultivating virtues to contribute to the prosperity and success of the nation.\n\nDoctoral thesis inscriptions are found in many countries and some localities in Vietnam, but only at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám in Thăng Long, Hanoi, do we find inscriptions that fully illustrate the responsibilities of scholars towards the nation and the people. These are truly invaluable intangible cultural heritage values ​​that our ancestors have left for generations to come.\n\nAV\n\nTL: LH\n\nTHE MOTIF OF “THE BIRDS PERCHED UPON THE APRICOT BRANCHES”, ENGRAVED ON THE STONE STELAE\n\nThe motif of the birds perched upon the apricot branches”decorated on the border of the stone stele for exam in 1589 at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám. According to folk opinion, “the apricot flowers showing their pistils to welcome the good things, the birds perching upon the apricot branches to inform the lucky things. The motif of “the birds perched upon the apricot branches” standing for the good signal.\n\nYou could make yourself printing of the motif “the birds perched upon the apricot branches” on the Dó paper at the heritage education for experimentation of Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nTranslator: BP\n\nWHY ARE DOCTORAL STELES AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM LISTED IN UNESCO'S MEMORY OF THE WORLD\n\nOn the afternoon of March 9, 2010, in Macao, China, during the annual meeting of the Memory of the World Committee for Asia and the Pacific (MOWCAP), the stone steles of doctoral examinations during Lê and Mạc dynasties (1442-1779) at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám in Hanoi were recognized as world documentary heritage and included in UNESCO's Memory of the World list.\n\nOn May 25, 2011, in Manchester, England, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova officially approved and added 45 documentary heritages from various countries worldwide, including the doctoral steles at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám, to the Memory of the World list as recommended by the International Advisory Committee of the UNESCO Memory of the World Programme.\n\nAccording to UNESCO criteria, for a heritage to be recognized as Memory of the World, it must be documentary, meaning it must be a purposefully created product containing information on a tangible carrier. The material must meet criteria such as authenticity, uniqueness, and especially global significance in a specific field.\n\nThe 82 doctoral steles at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám qualify as documentary heritage because they are records of doctoral examinations on stone, commissioned by Lê and Mạc dynasties from 1484 to 1780. The content of the steles is rich, with the stones serving as the main carriers of information.\n\nThe doctoral steles of Vietnam meet all the UNESCO criteria for Memory of the World. They are authentic documents with clear origins, and their historical and artistic aspects make them unique and irreplaceable. The steles provide insights into the introduction and changes of Confucianism in Vietnam, its presence outside China, and its role as the cradle and center of Chinese culture. Thus, they contribute to humanity's understanding of the history of human culture in the 15th to 18th centuries in the Asian region.\n\nThe stone steles of doctoral examinations during the Lê and Mạc dynasties at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám fulfill all criteria, with the most notable being the unique theme of the documents and the social impact of these steles compared to other similar documentary heritages.\n\nThe doctoral steles cover various topics, notably in the field of education and the utilization of human talent – products of education. The unique educational philosophies of ancient dynasties, such as \"Talented individuals are the nation's vital energy,\" emphasize that education is not only for students but also a lifelong process even after passing the exams and becoming officials. The inscriptions on the steles often remind successful individuals to live in a way that is \"worthy of reality,\" to be \"virtuous and honest,\" avoiding corruption and bribery. These educational ideas and moral principles are still frequently mentioned not only in regional countries but are also goals for most nations worldwide in the fight against corruption and in the development of their countries.\n\nThe significance of the Doctoral Steles extends to a larger societal context. The erection of these steles has encouraged all levels of society to pursue education for self-affirmation, to develop talents, and to become useful individuals, bringing glory to their families, homeland, and country. The Doctoral Steles attract the attention of many people, including scholars and high-ranking politicians in Vietnam and around the world. The inscriptions on the steles consistently provide surprises and fascination for those who seek to understand. Therefore, the Doctoral Steles are invaluable documentary heritages for humanity.\n\nLH\n\n\"STORK AND LOTUS FLOWER\" - AN ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION OF ASPIRATIONS ACHIEVED ON DOCTORATE STELES\n\nGraduating is a significant milestone marking one's achievement; the first step to open up the path to a successful career for every student. The noble and beautiful aspirations of reaching the pinnacle of academic success are fervently cherished by all generations of students. These aspirations are vividly portrayed on the literary pattern \"Stork and Lotus Flower\" carving on the doctoral stele at Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nThe literary pattern \"Stork And Lotus Flower\" depicts a scene where a group of storks is swimming gracefully in a lotus pond. This project is carved on the edge of the doctorate stele of the Nhâm Tuất royal exam in 1589. It is a form of humorous artwork symbolizing the attainment of academic success and consecutive doctoral degrees.\n\nThis is truly a tranquil and beautiful rural painting, brimming with life. It features a scene of storks gracefully swimming in a lotus pond. The storks are intricately carved with various natural poses, with some swimming, some foraging, and others elegantly raising their heads. Every movement is expressed with great subtlety and skill. The lotus flowers in the pond are in full bloom, exuding their fragrant beauty. Some tender buds are gently cradled by the lotus leaves, coiled and intertwined, while others stand tall among delicate and elongated blades of grass. The beauty and subtlety of nature in this carving reflect the masterful craftsmanship and creativity of the stone carver.\n\nIn the past, achieving a doctoral degree and attaining glory and honor were boundless sources of joy for scholars. Graduating with a doctorate marked a significant turning point in the life of every student. After obtaining a doctorate, a bright new chapter would open up, thanks to their diligent and persistent studies. Passing the doctorate examination not only brought personal glory to the candidate but also pride to their family and homeland. The Doctorate steles solemnly record the names of those who passed the exam, and it is a place of tribute to the pursuit of knowledge. The decorative sculptures on the edges and pediment are all outstanding artistic patterns illustrating this theme.\n\nEach decorative theme represents aspirations for success and the collective celebration of the nation. When education flourishes, talents thrive, and knowledge is highly esteemed. They all express a strong spirit of encouragement, inspiration, and support for every student, both in the past and for generations to come.\n\nAV\n\nTL:LH\n\nROYAL EXAMINATION IN THE YEAR OF THE QUÝ MÙI REIGN ENTITLED: HỒNG THUẬN VI (1514)\n\nThe stone stele records the names of the laureates of the exam held in 1514,\n\nlocated at the Special National Landmark Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám\n\nThe stone stele is 159 cm high, 110 cm wide, and 19 cm thick.

On the stele pediment is the ancient Chinese character of a seal in the style (Triện) recording the year of the exam: “Records of the Doctoral laureates of the Quý Mùi Royal exam, 6th Hồng Thuận Reign”.\n\nThere is also text composed by the eminent scholar Vũ Duệ (1468 - 1522), who passed the doctoral examination in the Canh Tuất year, Hồng Đức 21 (1490). The text imparts wisdom and guidance to those who achieve a doctorate: “For them, loyalty to the Dynasty, devotion to duty and striving for moral perfection must prevail over talent, skill, and literary creativity. They should become ‘auspicious clouds, stars, shining gems and pure gold’ for the nation; “swords and lances” in the combat against rebels; and solid pillars like the trunks of the “kỷ” and “tử” trees. They should become “rice” or “silk” for the poor, or ‘tonics’ for the State - so that our nation can be built on stable foundations like the Thái Sơn mountain, and advance steadily forward. They should not betray His Majesty’s trust. Through their loyalty they can make their causes and fame long-lasting like this stone stele. On the other hand, if any of them turns out to be corrupt or degenerate, he will be regarded like a scratch on a gemstone. The public will criticise such a person severely. So, the tiến sĩ should be cautious about this.”\n\nHis Majesty gave different assignments relating to the examination to Duke Lê Phụ (title: Tá lý hiệp mưu kính thận trinh ý công thần Đặc tiến khai phủ kim tử vinh lộc đại phu tả bình chương quân quốc trọng sự nhập nội kiểm hiệu Thượng tướng thái úy Lượng quốc công thượng trụ quốc), Minister of the Mandarinate Đàm Thận Huy (title: Phụng trực đại phụ Lại bộ thượng thư tri chiêu văn quán tú lâm cục tư chính thượng khanh), Vice-Minister of Public Works Lê Tán Tương (title: Gia hạnh đại phu Công bộ hữu thị lang khuông mỹ doãn), Minister of Rites and Rector of the Quốc Tử Giám, Count Lê Tung (title: Đặc tiến kim tử vinh lộc đại phu thiếu bảo Lễ bộ thượng thư đông các đại học sĩ kiêm Quốc Tử Giám Tế tửu tri kinh diên sự Đôn Thư bá trụ quốc), Minister of Rites, Count Nguyễn Bá Thuyên (title: Đặc tiến kim tử vinh lộc đại phu Lễ bộ thượng thư Do Lễ bá trụ quốc), Minister of Finance, Baron Đoàn Mậu (title: Đặc tiến kim tử vinh lộc đại phu Hộ bộ thượng thư tri chiêu văn quán tú lâm cục Cẩn Lễ nam chính trị thượng khanh) and Đỗ Nhạc (title: Quang nghiệp đại phu thượng thư đông các đại học sĩ nhập thi kinh diên chính trị khanh).\n\nUp to 5,700 Confucian scholars took part in the Royal examination (first round) in the year of Giáp Tuất, during the reign of Hồng Thuận VI. After four exams, 43 winners were selected. Thus, Nguyễn Đức Lượng and some other persons became the 1st-class tiến sĩ; Nguyễn Vũ and some other persons; 2nd-class Tiến sĩ xuất thân; Nguyễn Bỉnh Di and some others, 3rd-class Tiến sĩ xuất thân. They were granted honors as stipulated by the established rules. The Ministry of Rites submitted to His Majesty a request to set up a stone stele in their honor at the Thái Học House.\n\nAt the end of the inscription, the names and information of the calligraphers are recorded: Composed by the Minister of the Mandarinate Vũ Duệ (title: Trinh ý công thần đặc tiến kim tử vinh lộc đại phu thiếu bảo Lại bộ thượng thư Đông các đại học sĩ nhập thị kinh diên chính trị thượng khanh). Written on the stele by Chu Đình Bảo (title: Trung trinh đại phu Trung thư giám điển thư khuông mỹ thiếu doãn). Engraved by Phạm Đức Nhi (title: Thông chương đại phu kim quang môn đãi chiếu tử chính khanh). The stele was set up on the 17th day of the 4th lunar month of the year of Quang Thiệu VI (1521).\n\nAn Nhiên\n\nTL: LH\n\nPROJECT LOTUS FLOWER ON DOCTORAL STELE\n\nThe lotus flower is a precious flower, symbolizing noble qualities, purity, and is a familiar symbol in Vietnamese culture. In art, the lotus is frequently used for decoration in various artistic projects, carrying rich symbolism. Perhaps in our daily lives, we have never seen the lotus and chrysanthemum combined, yet this unique combination is featured on the Doctoral Stele.\n\nThis is the Lotus Vine Project. The artist has sculpted a lotus flower in full bloom with two lotus leaves embracing a mirror-shaped pedestal in the center, surrounded by 5 - 7 other petals blooming outward. The composition is vividly arranged by alternately placing a lotus flower next to a chrysanthemum (sometimes even combined with other flowers like peonies or money plants). These two types of flowers are connected by vines and leaves, enclosing the four sides of the Doctoral Stele.\n\nThe Lotus Vine Project, as depicted by ancient artists, conveys a very high level of craftsmanship. In reality, lotus and chrysanthemum leaves are quite different from those depicted on the project, and these flowers are not climbing plants. This showcases the creativity and skillfulness of the ancient artists.\n\nIn reality, the lotus has been incorporated into art from a very early stage, becoming a traditional art form and decoration in our culture. In Eastern culture, the lotus is also considered a symbol of Buddhism. In our country, since the Lý Dynasty, Buddhism has been considered the state religion, so the lotus theme has been extensively used in various Buddhist-related constructions (Buddha statues, temple pillars, stele decorations, pagodas, etc.).\n\nLater, during the early Lê Dynasty, despite the limitations placed on Buddhism and the rise of Confucianism, the lotus continued to be a popular theme and was used for decoration on Doctoral Steles. Some artists even creatively combined two symbolic flowers representing two streams of thought on a single art project: the lotus representing Buddhism and the chrysanthemum representing Confucianism. This seemed to express the harmony between Confucianism and Buddhism in contemporary society. All of this embodies the timeless aesthetic value of the lotus flower that has deeply permeated the souls of the Vietnamese people.\n\nAV\n\nTL; LH\n\nWHY DO THE DOCTORAL STELE TORTOISES AT VĂN MIẾU -QUỐC TỬ GIÁM HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES?\n\nCurrently, at Văn Miếu -Quốc Tử Giám, there are 82 Doctoral Stele, and each one is placed on the back of a tortoise. However, the shapes of the tortoies are not the same, my friends. Do you know why?\n\nThat's because these Doctoral Stele were erected over a long period of nearly 300 years (from 1484 to 1780), so depending on the sculptural style of each era, the tortoises have different shapes. In general, the shapes of the tortoises can be divided into 3 categories according to the era of the Stele's construction as follows:\n\nThe first category included steles erected from 1484 (15th year of Hồng Đức reign title) to 1536 (7th year of Đại Chính reign title). The tortoises (the sole of stele) were carved with round, smooth shape, the carvings look fine and precisely. The sole is in short, flat semicircular shape.\n\nThe secaond category including steles setup in 1653 ( first year of Thịnh Đức reign title). The tortoises (the sole) were made with square blocks, the carving are straight and simple, the neck of tortoise are short, the heads is up or transverse, the mouth is widely open, the leg were carved simply.\n\nThe third category including steles set up from 1717 (third year of Vĩnh Thịnh reign title) to 1780 (41st year of Cảnh Hưng reign title). The tortoises are crafted very similarly to real tortoises: short necks, with a ridged edge on the back, a large nose, round and small eyes. The turtle shell is curved, with an engraved pattern resembling a hexagon.\n\nThe first category\n\nThe 2nd category\n\nThe third categoryo\n\nAn Nhiên\n\nTL: LH\n\nTHE STONEMASONS HONORED ON DOCTORAL STELES AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nAmong the 82 doctoral steles at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám, in addition to the names of eminent scholars, there are also the identities of high-ranking officials in the court, the names of the individuals who composed the inscriptions on the steles, wrote the characters, engraved the words, and erected the steles. Of particular interest, five individuals are recognized with the title 'Stonemason'.\n\nThe first person is Phạm Thọ Ích from Kiêu Kỵ village, Gia Lâm district. His name is inscribed on the doctoral stele of the Giáp Thìn examination, in the 5th year of Bảo Thái (1724). On this stele, he refers to himself as a stonemason.\n\nIn the doctoral examination Đinh Mùi, in the 8th year of Bảo Thái (1727), Phạm Thọ Ích was again the inscriber. This time, he carved his own name on the stele, stating, \"Phạm Thọ Ích from Kiêu Kỵ village, Gia Lâm district, respectfully carved the characters.\"\n\nThe second individual is Hoàng Quang Trạch, who engraved the doctoral stele for the Quý Sửu examination, in the 2nd year of Long Đức (1733). In the final section of the stele's inscription, he clearly carved his identity, \"Hoàng Quang Trạch, the village chief of Gia Đức, Thuỷ Đường district, respectfully carved the characters.\"\n\nLê Nguyễn Diệu, from An Hoạch hamlet, Đông Sơn district, is honored on two doctoral steles: one for the Kỷ Mùi examination, in the 5th year of Vĩnh Hựu (1739), and another for the Quý Hợi examination, in the 4th year of Cảnh Hưng (1743). Both steles state, \"Lê Nguyễn Diệu from An Hoạch hamlet, Đông Sơn district, respectfully carved the characters.\"\n\nThe fourth person is \"Bá hộ Lê Khắc Thực and his entire team of stone gatherers, respectfully carved the characters,\" honored on the doctoral stele for the Bính Dần examination, in the 7th year of Cảnh Hưng (1746).\n\nThe last stonemason mentioned is Lê Văn Lộc, a stone carver from Nhuệ hamlet, An Hoạch commune, Đông Sơn district, recognized on the doctoral stele for the Quý Mùi examination, in the 24th year of Cảnh Hưng (1763). At the end of the stele's inscription, it states, \"Lê Văn Lộc, stone carver from Nhuệ hamlet, An Hoạch commune, Đông Sơn district, obediently carved the characters.\" Lê Văn Lộc is the second case recorded on a doctoral stele with the title of 'stone carver' (following Phạm Thọ Ích), and this title is officially inscribed in the main body of the stele.\n\nCertainly, the creation of the 82 stone steles at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám was the labor of many generations of talented stonemasons. Among these doctoral steles, only five stonemasons with their inscribed names are indeed a few and rare. This might be due to the hierarchical distinctions of the feudal regime, where the status of stonemasons remained in the lower ranks of society. However, by inscribing their identities on a few stone steles out of the total 82 at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám, their position in the historical hierarchy of Scholars - Farmers - Artisans - Merchants is somewhat affirmed.\n\nEven though their names might not be fully recorded on the doctoral steles, no one can deny the significant contributions they have made to society. These skilled stonemasons are the ones who silently crafted the invaluable 'Cultural Heritage' - the irreplaceable doctoral steles of the nation. The present generations of Vietnam always remember them with gratitude and respect.\n\nThe rim of the doctoral stele from 1724 engraved with the name of Phạm Thọ Ích.\n\nTwo doctoral steles from 1743 and 1739, bearing the name of the inscriber Lê Nguyễn Diệu, from An Hoạch hamlet, Đông Sơn district.\"\n\nTL: LH\n\nSTELE RECORDS OF DOCTORAL LAUREATES OF ROYAL EXAM IN THE YEAR OF ẤT MÙI REIGN TITLE: VĨNH THỊNH XI (1715).\n\nThe doctoral stele of Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi Reign title: Vĩnh Thịnh XI (1715) was erected in the spring of March 1717.\n\nThe stele is large, with a height of 184 cm, a width of 114 cm, and a thickness of 20 cm. The stele pediment is adorned with a pair of dragons coiling around clouds and embracing the sun and moon. The body of the stele is decorated with a combination of precious flowers. The tortoise has a round head, short neck, small eyes, wide mouth, no sharp teeth, a curved back, and its legs extend outward with five toes. The upper part of the stele is engraved with the following inscription in the classical Chinese script style: \"Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi Reign title: Vĩnh Thịnh XI (1715)\"\n\nOn the stele, the text is written in classical Chinese by the scholar Bùi Sĩ Tiêm, who was a member of the Academy, and he was also one of the successful candidates in the Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi, achieving the rank of Second Doctoral Degree (Hoàng giáp). Bùi Sĩ Tiêm was a person of integrity and courage, reaching high government positions and holding the title of Thái thường tự khanh. Edited by the Minister of the Mandarinate Duke Nguyễn Quý Đức (title: Tá lý công thần đặc tiến kim tử vinh lộc đại phu Tham tụng Lại bộ thượng thư, Đông các đại học sĩ thiếu phó Liêm quận công).\n\nThis examination had over 2,500 participants, among whom 20 were selected as outstanding scholars. The 20 winners of the first round of the exam gathered in the courtyard of His Majesty’s Palace on the 11th day of the 6th lunar month. His Majesty set the topic for the required essay about the fundamentals of State governance.\n\nThe next morning the Chief Examiner submitted the essays to the Emperor. His Majesty rated the winners: Bùi Sĩ Tiêm and Nguyễn Quý Ân became 2nd –class laureates; Phùng Bá Kỳ and 17 persons became 3rd –class laureates.\n\n“The names of the laureates were announced using a megaphone. Mandarins from the Ministry of Rites and the Golden Board hung on the gate of Quốc Học House. Then His Majesty bestowed on the laureates ceremonial costumes and treated them to a Royal Banquet held in Quỳnh Hoa Royal Garden. His Majesty’s favors for Royal exam winners were as generous as those granted by the previous kings. Furthermore, he ordered the setting up of a stone stele inscribed with the names of the laureates, as stipulated by the regulations. What a great honor for the laureates!’. These are the privileges bestowed by the imperial court upon the newly conferred scholars in Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi, Reign of Vinh Thinh 11 (1715).\n\nThe concluding part of the prose on the stelet clearly demonstrates the court's perspective on the importance of nurturing talented individuals: \" His majesty realizes that good persons are the core of the nation, and men of talent and virtue constitute the foundations of the State; they are of importance to State governance so they should be nurtured.\"\n\nAt the end of the text, the names and information of the calligraphers: Ngô Bảo (title: Thị nội thư tả thủy binh phiên tướng sĩ lang phó sở sứ) of Gia Thị commune, Gia Lâm district and Engraved by Baron Nguyễn Đình Huy (title: Kim quang môn đãi chiếu triện thích thái hàm tự thừa Liêu Tường nam).\n\nStele records of Doctoral laureates of Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi Reign title: Vĩnh Thịnh XI (1715) is an extremely valuable historical source among the 82 Doctorate Steles at the special national landmark Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nList of successful candidates in the Royal exam in the year of Ất Mùi Reign title: Vĩnh Thịnh XI (1715):\n\nĐệ nhị giáp Tiến sĩ xuất thân, 2 người:\n\nBÙI SĨ TIÊM: người xã Kinh Lũ huyện Đông Quan.\n\nNGUYỄN QUÝ ÂN: người xã Thiên Mỗ huyện Từ Liêm.\n\nĐệ tam giáp đồng Tiến sĩ xuất thân, 18 người:\n\nPHÙNG BÁ KỲ: người xã Vĩnh Mỗ huyện Yên Lạc.\n\nNGUYỄN NHAM: người xã Phùng Xá huyện Thạch Thất.\n\nCAO DƯƠNG TRẠC: người xã Phú Thị huyện Gia Lâm.\n\nĐỖ ĐÌNH THỤY: người xã Yên Lãng huyện Lôi Dương.\n\nDƯƠNG BẬT TRẠC: người xã Cổ Lễ huyện Nam Chân.\n\nNGÔ NHÂN HÂN: người xã Cẩm Chương huyện Đông Ngàn.\n\nNGUYỄN CÔNG THÁI: người xã Kim Lũ huyện Thanh Trì.\n\nNGUYỄN TUYỀN: người xã Mao Điền huyện Cẩm Giàng.\n\nNGUYỄN ĐỨC ÁNH: người xã Phật Tích huyện Tiên Du.\n\nTRẦN ÂN TRIÊM: người xã Yên Lâm huyện Yên Định.\n\nLƯƠNG LÂM: người xã Tào Sơn huyện Ngọc Sơn.\n\nLÊ HOÀN VIỆN: người xã Bát Tràng huyện Gia Lâm.\n\nHOÀNG ĐĂNG XUÂN: người xã Đại Lý huyện Thuần Lộc.\n\nĐINH NGUYÊN HANH: người sở Kim Lan huyện Gia Lâm.\n\nNGUYỄN ĐÌNH QUỸ: người xã Nguyệt Áng huyện Thanh Trì.\n\nNGUYỄN PHÙNG THÌ: người xã Hoa Lâm huyện Nam Đường.\n\nNGUYỄN KIỀU: người xã Phú Xá huyện Từ Liêm.\n\nLÊ CẨN: người xã Nam Hoa Đông huyện Thanh Chương.\n\nTL:LH\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF DOCTORAL STELES AT THE VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nIn the year 1484, King Lê Thánh Tông issued a decree to erect Doctoral Steles at the Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám to praise virtuous talents, encourage learning, and promote moral education for intellectuals and officials of that time.\n\nThe Doctoral Stele consists of two parts: the stele itself and the tortoise. The pediment of the stele is arched and adorned with decorative patterns. Below the pediment the inscriptions of examination dates and the names of successful candidates, written in the Trien script, and some steles are inscribed using the Khai script (types of ancient Chinese character).\n\nThe body of the stele is rectangular, with decorative patterns on the edges of the stele. The interior of the stele is engraved with Chinese characters, including the inscription of the stele, a list of successful Doctorate candidates, and finally, the names and titles of the individuals who composed the inscription, the supervisor, the calligrapher, the year of erection, and sometimes the name of the person who engraved the characters.\n\nAnd the stele is placed on the back of the tortoise, symbolizing the perseverance and endurance of virtuous talents who passed the imperial examinations.\n\nCurrently, the historical site preserves and conserves 82 steles corresponding to 82 examination subjects, inscribing the names of 1304 Doctorate degree holders from the examinations held between 1442 and 1779. The Doctoral Steles, erected from 1484 to 1780, have become precious historical archives and are recognized as National Treasures and World Documentary Heritage.\n\nTL: LH\n\n\"INTERPRETING THE UNIQUE ENGRAVING 'TWO NGHÊ’S – HOLY CREATURES ADMIRING CHRYSANTHEMUM FLOWERS'\"\n\nAt Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám, there is an exceptional engraving called \"'Two Nghê’s – Holy creatures admiring Chrysanthemum Flowers\" on the Stele of Doctoral laureates for the royal exam which took place in 1592. This is the only stele at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám with this decorative design.\n\nThe Nghê is a unique mythical creature in Vietnamese culture, commonly used in artistic sculptures and stone statues, and is presented in various shapes and forms. The depiction of two Nghê’s adoring chrysanthemums, represent a form of light, and are portrayed with vivid, respectful poses, with a joyful expression on their faces. They symbolize the happiness of successful scholars, and the joy of the royal court in selecting talented individuals for the country.\n\nThis joy is not only conveyed through the image of \"Two Nghê’s Admiring Chrysanthemum Flowers\" on the lower part of the stele but also through the content of the inscription on the stone, which reads, \"Thus, the Master’s Doctrine was revitalized and the Confucian forest became green again. The Confucian students and the citizens of the capital city crowded around to admire the laureates; all felt very happy to live in peace and prosperity under this dynasty.\"\n\nTL:LH\n\nTHE LAST DOCTORAL STELE ERECTED AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nThe 82 doctoral steles at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám are extremely valuable historical artifacts. These historical stone documents provide a tremendous amount of information about the Confucian education system in ancient Vietnam. The steles were erected at different times. Of the 82 steles, the first stele was erected in the year 1442, and the doctoral stele of the Kỷ Hợi examination in the reign of Cảnh Hưng 40 (1779) was the last stele erected at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nThis stele was erected in the middle of winter, in the year Canh Tý, during the reign of Cảnh Hưng 41 (1780) under the rule of Lord Trịnh Sâm. The stele is large, with a solemn decoration, measuring 2 meters in height, 125cm in width, and is 28cm thick. The pediment of the stele is decorated with the image of two dragons transforming into clouds while embracing the sun. The name of the stele is engraved in ancient Chinese character, 12cm in height. The body of the stele is adorned with a combination of flower motifs. The tortoise has a short neck, small eyes, a long mouth, and no fangs. The engraved pattern on the shell is in the shape of hexagonal tiles.\n\nIn the winter of the year of Kỷ Hợi, a Royal examination was held (the first round) attracting Confucian scholars who had passed the inter-provincial examination. The second round of the examination was held in the spring of the year of Canh Tý in the Royal Palace. On the following day His Majesty himself came to the Palace and set the topic for the required essay. In the end, 15 people passed this examination. Among them, two individuals achieved the second rank of Doctor. Thirteen individuals achieved the third rank of Doctor, including Doctor Phan Huy Ôn, from Thu Hoạch village, Thiên Lộc district, which is now Thạch Châu commune, Thạch Hà district, Hà Tĩnh province. He was the last person to have his name engraved on the doctoral stele at Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nTL: LH\n\nA STRANGE FLOWER ON STONE STELAE\n\nOn the doctoral laureates’ stelae at Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám there are images of a very strange flower, do you know what flower it is? .\n\nIt is the Bao Tien flower, which is carved on most of doctoral laureates’ stelae at Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám. The design of the Bảo Tiên flower on doctoral laureates’ stelae there during the Lê – Mạc dynasty takes the lotus as the main theme, often arranged with delicate leaves, or with the birds such as phoenixes, pheasants, and peacocks, which are very vivid.\n\nThe flower patterns on the stones are carved with great delicacy, featuring various shapes and rich symbolism.\n\nThe research of Dr. Trần Hậu Yên Thế on the history of this project is related to the process of Buddhism's penetration into China. In the development of Chinese art, the efforts of Buddhism to infiltrate, reconcile, and transform have brought the lotus flower together with the peony (representing Confucianism) and the chrysanthemum (representing Taoism) as a symbol of the three prevailing religions. In Vietnam, this project is widely used in decorative techniques on the architecture of pagodas, palaces during the Ly and Tran dynasties, and continued to thrive in the Le dynasty. At Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám, Bảo Tiên flower is commonly adorned on the stone stelae.\n\nLH\n\nREADING AND UNDERSTANDING THE DOCTORAL STELE: THE STELE CARVED WITH THE NAME OF THE FATHER OF THE GREAT POET NGUYEN DU\n\nThe doctoral stele representing the examination year of Canh Thìn, under the reign of Cảnh Hưng the 21st (1760), was erected in the spring of February (1760), after the examination was held.\n\nThe stele is large, measuring 198 cm high, 123 cm wide, and 26 cm deep. The top of the stele is adorned with two dragons turned to clouds embracing the sun and moon. The edge of the stele is decorated with flowers. The turtle has a round head, short neck, large eyes, wide mouth, no fangs, and a curved back.\n\nThe names of both father and son, Nguyễn Nghiễm and Nguyễn Khản, are engraved on the stele. Nguyễn Nghiễm composed the text on the stele, and Nguyễn Khản was one of the five successful candidates of this examination. Nguyễn Nghiễm is also the father of the great national poet Nguyễn Du. He passed the examination in the year of Tân Hợi of Vĩnh Khánh the 3rd’s reign (1731) and held the position of Principle of Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nThe examination selected five outstanding candidates, all of whom achieved the rank of Third Class Doctorate. Among them, Nguyễn Khản held the position of Academician. At the end of 1769, he was appointed as a tutor to teach the crown prince Trịnh Khải (later known as Trịnh Tông) by Lord Trịnh Sâm. He was promoted to the position of deputy minister of the Ministry of Mandarinate.\n\nThe doctoral stele of the examination in 1760 is an extremely valuable historical resource within the system of 82 doctoral steles at the special national heritage site, Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám./.\n\nTL:LH\n\nTHE STONE STELE FOR EXAM IN 1760 AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nThe stone stele for exam in 1760 is one of 82 stone stelae registered as the World Documentary Heritage by UNESCO as well as the national treasure that a pride of Vietnam.\n\nThe stone stele is 198cm height and 123 cm width and 26cm thick. The arched pediment is decorated with two dragons becoming clouds franking to the sun.

Likewise, govermance and talents are inter – related. So many reigns have glided by until today, when the afore – mentioned synthesis occurs agains”. These are the opening sentences carved on the stone stele to record names of the doctors of the exam held in 1694 at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám and emphasize the importance of human talent for a nation.\n\nThe stele is very large, 187cm high, 126cm wide, and 27cm thick. The top of the stele is decorated with two phoenixes flanked by clouds, the sun, and the moon. The edges of the stele is decorated with flowers. The tortoise bearing the stele has a round head, a short neck, small eyes, a wide mouth, no teeth, an arched back, and long legs with 5 toes clustered together. The top of the stele is engraved with the date the exam was organized on.\n\nOn the stele is a text written in Chinese, engraved by Cẩn sự Tá lang of the Hanlin Academy and composed by Academician Nguyễn Nham. He passed the Royal exam in 1715 under the reign of King Lê Dụ Tông. He was awarded the title of 3rd class. The transcription was edited by the Minister of the Mandarinate, Duke Nguyễn Quý Đức.\n\nThis National exam had more than 2,000 participants. After the fourth test, the mandarins overseeing the exam selected Ngô Công Trạc and four other candidates as winners. The following month they were invited to sit for the 2nd round of the examinations at the Royal Palace. As a result, all the candidates were awarded the title of 3rd class.\n\nAfter passing the exam, each of the doctors received accolades. Their names were announced by the mandarins of the Ministry of Rites and inscribed on the Golden Board hung at the gate of Thái Học House. They were granted favors such as ceremonial apparel, a Royal banquet in the Royal Garden, and silver blossoming twigs according to the old customs. Then, they were promoted to posts, both within and without the administration, such as Supervisors or members of the Academy. In the following 24 years, the laureates were “like fluttering oriels and flying Hồng birds”, both inside and outside the Court. Some of them were appointed to be very important officers.\n\nAt the end of the epitaph, the full name and detailed information about the men who engraved the text on the stele are also recorded.\n\nThe stone stele recording the names of the doctors of the exam held in 1694 is an extremely valuable source of historical data among of 82 Doctoral steles at the Special National Landmark of Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nLH\n\nTHE DECORATION ART ENGRAVED ON THE DOCTOR’S STONE STELE OF THE ROYAL EXAM WAS HELD IN 1589\n\nThe doctor’ stone stele of the royal exam held in 1589 was set up on November 16th, 1653 at Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám. This stele is decorated with sophisticated, meticulous motifs on the top and the edges.\n\nThe top of the stele is carved with two phoenixes worshiping the sun and moon. The artists depicted vividly two phoenixes in a position that is slowly landing.\n\nthe edge of the stele is decorated with peach blossoms, chrysanthemums, and a picture of the bird perched upon the apricot branches. The Apricot blossoms symbolize good signs, and birds on the tree bode a good omen.

They should also try to make progress every day so that they don't feel ashamed of the wrong things they do.

The stele that records the names of doctors of examination in 1502 is one of the two steles with the largest number of doctors.

The first is on November 10, 1502 while the information at the end of the text says that the stele was erected on September 15, 1536. According to the book “Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám và 82 bia Tiến sĩ” by the late Assoc. Prof. Dr. Ngô Đức Thọ, there is likelihood that for some reason only the text was written while the inscriptions and stele erecting were not done. At the beginning of the Mạc dynasty, the stele was erected and the text that had been written before was engraved on the stele.\n\nIn the spring, 1502, as usual, the court organized the Hội exam(a national exam).

From an early period, the lotus appeared in the visual arts, and was reflected in architecture and sculpture. This creates the style of lotus of different periods.\n\nTypically, lotus motifs are also decorated on the edges of the stone stele at the Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám. These motifs are diverse and of high aesthetic value, including: Cloud-shaped lotus; Lotus-shaped pedestal; Creeper lotus;…\n\n* Cloud-shaped Lotus\n\nLotus motifs were decorated on the first steles of the early Lê Dynasty. The lotus is in the center of the decorative composition. When seen from the side, each layer of petals is clearly visible. The flower bud in the innermost part has not yet bloomed. The layers of lotus petals spread evenly on both sides. The outermost lotus petals have a spiral shape while each petal looks like a cloud.\n\nCloud-shaped lotus motifs appear mainly on a few stone steles at the Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám erected in the 15th century. During this period, decorative motifs on stele often looked very delicate, sharp and elegant.\n\n(Photo: The stylized lotus motif of the early Lê Dynasty is decorated on the stele that records the names of the Doctors of the exam held in 1478.\n\nSource: \" Nét Việt trên bia Tiến sĩ Văn Miếu\" – Quốc Tử Giám”, Trần Hậu Yên Thế, Trần Trung Hiếu, Fine Arts Publishing House 2018)\n\n*Motif of lotus-shaped pedestal\n\nThe lotus motifs of this type are decorated on the stele in the same way as those decorated on the pedestal of the Buddha statue. At the Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám, there are more than 10 stone steles which were erected around the 17th century and decorated with lotus motifs but in different ways.\n\nThe lotus motifs decorated on stele in this way are usually large. The petals are arranged in 1 to 3 layers, and are arranged horizontally. The layers of petals are shallowly carved, and stylized into a cloud shape.\n\n(Photo: Motif of lotus-shaped pedestal decorated on steles erected in the sixteenth and seventh centuries)\n\n*Motif of Creeper Lotus\n\nMotif of Creeper Lotus Another type of lotus motif on the stone stele is Creeper lotus. This motif is a combination of 2 types of flowers: chrysanthemum and lotus. These two flowers are arranged one after another on a creeper and are decorated around the edge of a stele. The lotus motif of this type is only a formalization. In fact, lotus leaves and chrysanthemum leaves are different from those engraved on the stele; moreover, these two flowers are not creepers. Thereby, we can see the creativity and ingenuity of the ancient artisans.\n\n(Photo: Motif of Creeper lotus decorated on the edges of the steles at the Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám)\n\nCT\n\nTHE STONE STELE RECORDING NAMES OF LAUREATES OF EXAM HELD IN 1475 AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nIn 1484, King Lê Thánh Tông ordered the erection of the stone stele recording names and homelands of doctor laureates.

The second grade laureate was Ông Nghĩa Đạt. The third grade laureate was Cao Nghĩa, 37 years old.\n\nThe text for the stele of the examination held in 1475 was composed by the academician Lê Tuấn Ngạn. The content shows that the education and training of talents was very important under the reign of King Lê Thánh Tông: “Men of talent are absolutely essential for the nation, just as vital energy is a requirement for every human being. However, there must be a policy and procedure for selecting and promoting talented people.”. “All of them have been appointed to different posts…They try their hardest to perfect themselves and record brilliant achievements to fulfill their aspirations and to pay a debt of gratitude to the Court. People of subsequent generations may point to their names on this stone stele and offer opinions such as: “This man is righteous and that man is wicked…Therefore, this stone stele not only highlights the good reputation of the laureates of the Royal examination, but also serves as advice and warning.”.\n\nThe text also tells us the names, positions, and responsibilities of the officials responsible for this exam such as: Commanders in chief, Count Trịnh Công Lộ, Minister of the Mandarinate Hoàng Nhân Thiêm. Panel of Judges: Chief Academician Thân Nhân Trung, Academician Đỗ Nhuận and Quách Đình Bảo.

The stone stele recording names of laureates of exam held in 1442 was one of the first 10 stone stalea which were erected at this time.\n\nThe stone stele is small, 108cm high, 52cm wide, 18cm thick. The stele pediment is in an arch shape and decorated with precious clouds, sacred trees, and strange grass. The stele was put on the tortoise which has a round head, raised high, slightly forward and mouth wide with fangs. The tortoise’s eyes are large, round, and graceful, expressing the eternal desire of knowledge. The first sentence of the text in big capital states the year when the examination was held.\n\nThe main part of the text praises the merit of the contemporary king, the reason for holding the exam, names and functions of the examiners with the designated tasks, then it reports names and homelands of laureates in the order of rank: first rank, second rank, third rank and the name and functions of the text composer, editor, calligrapher, time of stele erection. It tells us also the number of candidates for the National exam was 450 men, and only 33 men were selected.\n\nThe first grade laureate was Nguyễn Trực. He worked as Rector of Quốc Tử Giám later. Nguyen Truc was sent as the King’s envoy to China. The second grade laureate was Nguyễn Như Đổ who also worked as headmaster of Quốc Tử Giám. The third grade laureate was Lương Như Hộc.

The national history series compiled by historians includes writings by Ngo Si Lien. The series includes 15 books. He also worked as a deputy head of Quốc Tử Giám.\n\nThe text on the stele 1442 records the names and the titles of the text composer, editor, calligrapher and the time of the stele erection. They were the high officials and talented men.\n\nThe text for the stele of the first examination held in the 3rd year of the reign of Dai Bao (1442) was composed by the academician Than Nhan Trung (Title: Han lam vien Thua chi, Dong cac Dai hoc si) and affirms: “Virtuous and talented men are the primordial vitality of a State. If this vitality is strong, the State will be powerful and prosperous. If it is not, the State will weaken and have a low standing. Therefore, clear-sighted monarchs always attach importance to educating talented men and selecting Confucian scholars for the mandarinate, and regard the fostering of the State’s primordial vitality as an urgent task”. This is the quintessence of knowledge of the intellectuals of different generations and the experiences of the principles for educating themselves and those of the State governance of Vietnam.\n\nThe stone stele of the exam in 1442 is placed in the hall. The outside is engraved with parallel sentences which mean to praise the education and engraving the name of Doctor Lauretes.\n\nLH\n\nSTORKS AND LOTUS CARVED ON DOCTOR STELE AT VĂN MIẾU – QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nThe folk sculpture \"storks and lotus\" is a familiar image in Vietnamese villages: a large lotus pond interspersed with lotus leaves, lotus flowers and storks and ducks swimming.

This is a large lotus pond, interspersed with lotus leaves, lotus flowers and storks and ducks swimming.\n\nStorks and Lotus\n\n(carved on doctor stele for the exam in 1589)\n\nThe names of the men who study well and pass the royal exam were engraved on the Doctoral stele. So the decoration motifs on the stele often reflect the joy of passing, luck, and happiness of education, examinations and the career of academicians. The sculpture of \"storks and lotus\" is the symbol of great success in life, career and examinations.\n\nStudents are printing the motif of Storks and Lotus on Do paper\n\nVisiting Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám, you will have the opportunity to admire these artistic masterpieces.

You can print and bring home the ancient motifs from hundreds of years ago, with the profound philosophies of the ancestors.\n\nLH\n\nAN HOẠCH STONE, WHICH STONE STELES OF VĂN MIẾU QUỐC TỬ GIÁM WERE MADE OF\n\nVisitors to the Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám are particularly interested in historical and cultural values of 82 stone steles - National Treasures, World Documentary Heritage; however, few of them pay attention to the material the steles are made of. Actually, these steles are made from the blue stone taken from An Hoạch mountain, Đông Sơn district, Thanh Hóa province. This kind of stone is used to make steles.\n\nSteles at the Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám are works of art that reflect the sculptural style of each monarchy. The stone carving was carried out very meticulously. The work was usually supervised by the chief officials of the Ministry of Rites. The Ministry of Works was in charge of selecting stone and carving artists. The text that recorded information of the exam held in 1748 said that two groups of workers \"took stone from An Hoạch village, Đông Sơn district to make stone stele\" (quote from Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám and 82 stone steles- Dr. Ngô Đức Thọ, Chief Editor.).\n\nAn Hoạch village (also known as Nhồi or Nhuệ) is an old village located in the southwest of Thanh Hóa city, now in An Hoạch ward, Thanh Hóa city, Thanh Hóa province. In this area, there is a high rocky mountain range called Nhồi mountain, or Khê, An Hoạch, Vọng Phu mountain ... The rocks have various colors: black, red, brown, yellow, dark blue, two of which, dark stone and dark blue stone are the rarest. These two kinds are smooth and have few compounds, so they are less likely to be damaged by the weather. Therefore, since ancient times, they were often chosen to make important objects that would be supposed to last for a long time.\n\nDescribing this special stone material, the inscription of the stone stele at Bảo An pagoda located on An Hoạch mountain, Thanh Hóa province says: \"The stone looks iridescent like green jade. It is used for making musical instruments, like musical stone whose sound can resound for miles away, or used to make steles whose inscriptions can last for thousands of years\"\n\nNowadays, the preservation of the steles is always highly regarded. In 1994, with the sponsorship of American Express Company, the Government of Vietnam built 8 houses to protect the steles. These houses are designed in the architectural style of the Late Lê dynasty, which looks simple, solemn, and harmonious with the surrounding landscape. This makes it difficult for visitors to be able to recognize between the old and the new.\n\nCT\n\nDECORATIVE MOTIF OF BUFFALO ON STONE STELE AT VĂN MIẾU-QUỐC TỬ GIÁM\n\nThe stone steles not only clearly reflect the Confucian examinations, and the honoring of talents, but also show us the traditional artistic values ​​in Vietnamese culture. The Buffalo decorated on a stele that records the information of the exam held in 1643 is a typical example.\n\nBuffalo is the second animal in the 12 animal designations, and plays an important role in Vietnam's agriculture. Perhaps, only in the long-standing agricultural civilization are there customs and festivals such as buffalo fighting, buffalo competitions, ... Because buffalo in Vietnamese culture symbolizes firmness, loyalty, hard work and honesty. For a long time, buffalos have become part of Vietnamese belief in social life, which is both familiar and sacred. Buffalo became the source of inspiration in poems, paintings, sculptures, songs ... of Vietnam.\n\nIt is interesting that the buffalo is decorated on the stone stele that records the information of the exam held in 1643. This is the only stele of 82 steles at Van Mieu-Quoc Tu Giam to have buffalo motif. That decorative motif depicts two mandarins standing next to a buffalo. Although the motif is not very big, it clearly shows the spirit of the subjects. The two mandarins look very unhurried. The buffalo looks strong, muscular and has curved horns like a crescent moon.\n\nThe motif reminds us of the old verse “Con trâu là đầu cơ nghiệp, which means that a buffalo is very important to the beginning of a business”. It is also reminiscent of Shen Nong ceremony and and Tịch Điền ritual that took place in the past. This ritual would take place in early spring, when the king personally participated in the plowing. In the past, the royal Court took this ritual very seriously with the hope of a year with all good things and bumber crops.\n\nThe Buffalo on the stone stele also symbolizes the desire for human well-being, peace and happiness. It is also the duty of the intellectuals to build a prosperous country.\n\nIn this year, 2021, although the pandemic of Covid-19 is still worrying. Hopefully, everything will be fine in the year of Buffalo.\n\nThe buffalo motif on the stone stele recording the information of the exam held in 1643\n\nThe stone stele recording the information of the exam held in 1643\n\nCT\n\nDragons decorated on stone steles at Văn Miếu-Quốc Tử Giám\n\nThe dragons decorated on the stone steles at Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam are unique decorative patterns. Dragons on the top position of stone steles are in the shape of two dragons flanking a moon and sun. The moon and sun represent wisdom. The image of two dragons flanking the sun and moon indicates the flourishing development of intellectuals.\n\nOut of 82 steles, there are 46 steles decorated with dragon motifs which are of different and elaborate designs. The first stelae were built in 1484; however, the dragon motifs did not appear at this time but in 1565.\n\nThe dragon motifs are divided into 2 types: \" Awake dragon \" and \"Cloud-shaped dragons\". \"Awake Dragon\" twists its body, its scales are clearly carved, head is held high, hair flies in the wind. It looks powerful. The moon and the sun have rays of light around them. In particular, the dragons of this type have only 3 claws. There are 14 steles decorated with the Awake- dragon motifs.\n\nHowever, out of the 14 above-mentioned steles, there is only stele of the exam in 1607 which was decorated with a dragon of another style. It was \"Two dragons facing a pearl\". More specifically, the two dragons represent the balance between Yin and Yang while the pearl represents the universe. The motif on this stele is very clear but stiff.\n\nThe image of \"Cloud-shaped dragons\" was decorared for the first time on the stone stele which record names of PhD in the exam in 1656. From that year on, there were 32 other steles decorated with this motif. If we look at it at first glance, it is easy to confuse dragons with clouds. However, when we look closely, we will recognize dragons. Dragons of this type do look lissom.\n\nThe dragons were vividly carved by artisans, and come in many different shapes and styles. Although dragon is an imaginary animal , its appearance is clearly created. Moreover, it lives in a world of its own.\n\n\"Two dragons flanking the sun and the moon\" decorated on the stele that records the examination in 1565\n\n\"Two dragons flanking a pearl\" decorated on the stele that records the exam in 1607\n\n\"Cloud-shaped dragons\" decorated on the stele that records the exam in 1763\n\nCT\n\nBIA TIẾN SĨ TẠI VĂN MIẾU - QUỐC TỬ GIÁM HÀ NỘI VỚI TRUYỀN THỐNG HIẾU HỌC DÒNG HỌ NGUYỄN HẠ YÊN QUYẾT\n\n82 bia đá đề danh Tiến sĩ của các khoa thi từ 1442 đến 1779 tại Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám là những di vật quý giá và được xem như pho sử bằng đá về giáo dục Nho học Việt Nam, trải qua hơn 5 thế kỷ tồn tại cùng với những thăng trầm của lịch sử, cho đến nay vẫn giữ nguyên giá trị.\n\nNội dung bia Tiến sĩ tại Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám còn ghi đầy đủ những thông tin cụ thể về khoa thi, số lượng thí sinh, tên, quê quán người thi đỗ, tên các quan coi thi, chấm thi,...

Trong số đó có dòng họ Nguyễn ở Hạ Yên Quyết, huyện Từ Liêm, nay thuộc phường Yên Hòa, Cầu Giấy, Hà Nội.\n\nLàng Hạ Yên Quyết (làng Cót) là một làng trong 4 làng nổi tiếng (Mỗ, La, Canh, Cót). Dòng họ Nguyễn là một trong những họ nổi tiếng ở Hạ Yên Quyết, đây là một dòng họ có truyền thống hiếu học từ lâu đời. Đến nay họ Nguyễn đã phát triển được hơn 20 đời trong gần 600 năm với rất nhiều danh nhân học cao, trí lớn, có đức, có tài, đã đem toàn bộ tài năng và trí tuệ của mình cống hiến cho đất nước, phục vụ nhân dân. Họ đều là những người đức độ, chính trực, thanh liêm, lập lên nhiều công lao lớn và được sử sách ghi lại. Dòng họ Nguyễn có tất cả 5 vị đỗ đại khoa, 30 vị đỗ Cử nhân, Tú tài.\n\nCụ thủy tổ của dòng họ là Nguyễn Như Uyên, ông đỗ Đệ nhị giáp Tiến sĩ xuất thân (Hoàng giáp) khoa Kỷ Sửu niên hiệu Quang Thuận 10 (1469) đời vua Lê Thánh Tông. Làm quan đến chức Lại bộ Thượng thư, chưởng lục bộ, kiêm Tế tửu Quốc Tử Giám, Nhập thị kinh diên.\n\nĐời thứ hai là Nguyễn Xuân Nham, cháu họ của Nguyễn Như Uyên, ông đỗ Đệ tam giáp Đồng tiến sĩ xuất thân khoa Kỷ Mùi niên hiệu Cảnh Thống 2 (1499) đời vua Lê Hiến Tông. Làm quan đến chức Thừa chính sứ.\n\nNguyễn Như Uyên và Nguyễn Xuân Nham đỗ các khoa thi năm 1469 và năm 1499. Hai khoa thi này theo Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư chép đều được dựng bia đặt tại Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám song đã bị thất lạc, những bia này hoặc đã bị huỷ hoại, hoặc chuyển dịch thất lạc, bị vùi lấp đâu đó chưa phát hiện được.\n\nĐến đời thứ ba là Nguyễn Khiêm Quang, cháu của Nguyễn Như Uyên, ông đỗ Đệ tam giáp Đồng tiến sĩ xuất thân khoa Quý Mùi niên hiệu Thống Nguyên 2 (1523) đời Lê Cung Hoàng. Khoa Quang Thiệu 5 (1520) và 2 khoa đời Lê Cung Hoàng (Thống Nguyên 2 (1523) và Thống Nguyên 5 (1526), tức 3 khoa thi cuối cùng của đời Lê sơ thì không những đương thời mà cả về sau cũng chưa bao giờ được dựng bia. Vì thế mặc dù đỗ Tiến sĩ song tên ông không được khắc trên bia đặt tại Văn Miếu.\n\nĐời thứ 5 là Nguyễn Nhật Tráng, cháu của Nguyễn Khiêm Quang, ông đỗ Hội nguyên, Đệ nhị giáp Tiến sĩ xuất thân (Hoàng giáp) khoa Ất Mùi niên hiệu Quang Hưng 18 (1595) đời Lê Thế Tông. Bia Tiến sĩ năm 1595 đặt tại Văn Miếu – Quốc Tử Giám khắc tên ông: “Đệ nhị giáp Tiến sĩ xuất thân: Nguyễn Nhật Tráng: xã Yên Quyết Hạ, huyện Từ Liêm”.\n\nĐời thứ 8 là Nguyễn Vinh Thịnh, cháu tằng tôn của Nguyễn Nhật Tráng, ông đỗ Đệ tam giáp Đồng tiến sĩ xuất thân khoa Kỷ Hợi niên hiệu Vĩnh Thọ 2 (1659) đời vua Lê Thần Tông. Tên của ông được khắc trên văn Tiến sĩ khoa thi năm 1659 đặt tại Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám: “Đệ tam giáp Đồng tiến sĩ xuất thân: Nguyễn Vinh Thịnh: xã Nghĩa Đô huyện Từ Liêm”.\n\n82 bia Tiến sĩ là nguồn sử liệu hết sức quý giá, chúng ta có thể tìm được rất nhiều thông tin về lịch sử, văn hóa, mỹ thuật, các giá trị triết lý, giá trị tư tưởng và quan điểm của người đương thời. Những tấm bia đá hiện vẫn còn ở Văn Miếu - Quốc Tử Giám luôn nhắc nhở chúng ta về chính sách đối với nhân tài, đề cao, ca ngợi công trạng của các danh nhân với dân, với nước.

These 82 stone steles were inscribed on the Asia-Pacific Memory of the World Register in 2010 and the International Memory of the World Register in 2011.\n\nThe history of Vietnamese education, Confucian teaching and learning in our country dates back to the Ly dynasty, and was further developed through the Tran and Ho dynasties. Under the Le dynasty, Confucian teaching resulted in training thousands of talented men for the country. The text for the stele of the first examination held in the 3rd year of the reign of Dai Bao (1442) was composed by the academician Than Nhan Trung (Title: Han lam vien Thua chi, Dong cac Dai hoc si) affirms: “Virtuous and talented men are the essence of the State’s vitality”. It was always considered the guideline for education of many dynasties.\n\nThe stele not only show the way of using talents, the content on the stele also teaches lessons and reminds the talented men the responsibility to the country: The text for the stele of the first examination held in 1487 states: “Whose names appear on this stone are very lucky! They should try their best to make their fame match their abilities”; The text for the stele of the first examination held in 1514 states: “They should become ‘auspicious clouds, stars, shining gems and pure gold’ for the nation”; The text for the stele of the first examination held in 1577 states: “If any of the laureates uses the honors he has gained to seek wealth and credit from the mandarinate, posterity will surely criticize him as an evil, mean man who brings disgrace on our education system”.\n\nThe text on the stele records the names and homelands of the laureates, the names and the titles of the text composer, editor, calligrapher and the time of the stele erection, the names of examination executives, examiners, and dates of Royal examination, the date of hanging the board written names who passed Royal exams… Based on that information, we can assess the situation of educational development under the Le and Mac dynasties.\n\nThe number of candidates attending the examination steadily rose over a period of one thousand years showing an interest in the education of the State and the society. In 1442, 450 men participated in the examination process; in 1448, there were 750 participants; in 1475 there were 3000 participants, and in 1640 there were 6000 men taking the exam.\n\nHowever, the examination process was rigorous. Even though there was a steady increase in the number of men taking the exam, there was not an increase in the number of men who passed the exam. The candidates' quality requirements were disregarded. The text on the stele states: The number of men who passed the exam in one examination was 62 people (exam in 1478), and at least there were only 3 men passed (exam in 1592, 1667).\n\nOf the 1304 graduates who were listed on the Doctorate laureate’s stalea, many later became social and political activists, famous culturalists who left behind many valuable works for future generations. Thus, 82 stone steles at Van Mieu - Quoc Tu Giam vividly reflect the educational history of our country from the 15th to the 18th centuries.\n\nTranslator: Thu Hương\n\nTHE STONE STELAE – A WORLD DOCUMENTARY HERITAGE\n\nOn January 14, 2011, 82 stone stelae were regconized as a national treasure. In May 2011, the 82 stone stelae at Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam were ranked as a world documentary heritage. Le Thanh Tong King (1460 – 1497) thought highly of Confucianism and ordered stone stelae to be erected to memorialize the nation’s talents.\n\nNowadays, 82 stone stelae from 15th to 18th centuriesrecord the names of 1304 doctoral laureates. These 82 stone stelae are original and havve beenpreserved.\n\nOriginal and unique\n\nThe 82 stone stelae are original artifacts found only at Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam in Hanoi. They provide an opportunity to researchthe connected relationship between geography and the history of culture in Vietnam.\n\nThe 82 stone stelae are a precious textual source of history that helps us research the life and careers of Vietnamese talents and provideso a complete list of graduates in Han – Nom bibliographies of Vietnam.\n\nMore specifically, each inscription provides information on the history of the examination and the political and social context of the Viet kingdom during that period by singing the praises of talented men and the virtues of the ruling monarch and outlines the purposes and requirements of the education system. The inscription for the examination held in 1442 says: “Virtuous and talented men are the primordial vitality of a State. If this vitality is strong, the State will be powerful and prosperous. If it is not, the State will weaken and have a low standing. Therefore, clear – sighted monarchs always attach importance to educating talented men and selecting Confucian scholars for the mandarinate, and regard the fostering of the State’s primordial vitality as an urgent task”.\n\nDiversity of value of source text\n\nContent of inscriptions on 82 stone stelae have been researched and identified many subjects: history, culture, education, philosophy, law, comtemplary written language...\n\nThe inscription on each stelae, speaks highly of the role of Confucianism in social-political life and the king. In the past, the kings always cared and respected the talents who are considered the most important factors to consolidate the country, and rule the nation.\n\nHistory of education in Vietnam is evident on the 82 stone steale. The steale illustrate the rule of education, the names of exams (Hoi, Dinh exams) and the tittles of doctoral laureates with their ranks: the first rank (Trang nguyen, Bang nhan, Tham hoa); the second rank (Hoang giap); the third rank (Tien si).\n\nThe 82 stone stelae were engraved in Han character, important characters that provides research of the history of development of Han character from 15th to 18th centuries.The earliest stone stelae are inscribed with seal character, reflecting traditional creation of calligraphy in Vietnam.\n\nDiversity of form and style\n\nThe 82 stone stelae were erected in different dynasties, which is evident by three different shapes of tortoise. Each stelae has its own artistic character, represented by the design of the tortoise or pediment and edges, which reflects the artistic symbolism of the times and thus sheds light on the development of Vietnamese art history during the 15th and 18th centuries. Every steale is a real work of art, having been created by the best scholars, craftmen and calligraphers of the era.\n\nStone stelae at Van Mieu – Quoc Tu Giam record events of politics, culture and science. The development of education policy was important to develop a strong nation.\n\nTranslator: Bich Phuong\n\nGIÁ TRỊ BIA TIẾN SĨ\n\n82 bia Tiến sĩ là những di vật giá trị bậc nhất của di tích Văn Miếu- Quốc Tử Giám, niềm tự hào của nền văn hóa giáo dục dân tộc đã tạo nên và lưu giữ được một pho “sử đá” có giá trị về nhiều mặt.\n\n1.
