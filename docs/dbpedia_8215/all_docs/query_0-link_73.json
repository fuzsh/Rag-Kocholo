        "text": "Vietnamese CEOs who were born in the 1970s (known as the 7X generation) have made their mark by significantly contributing to the success of multiple businesses.\n\nThe 7X generation is widely regarded as a strong and special group of forward thinkers. They have preserved the cultural values of Vietnam, while showing the dynamism and determination to integrate in the world today.\n\nLe Thi Thu Thuy, Vingroup vice chairwoman & VinFast Global CEO\n\nBefore joining Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup and its automaker subsidiary VinFast, she had an impressive profile with a bachelor's degree in economics from the Hanoi Foreign Trade University and a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from the International University of Japan. She was also vice president of Lehman Brothers in Japan, Thailand and Singapore from 2000-2008.\n\nJoining Vingroup as head of the investment department and later the group's vice chairwoman in charge of investment, Thuy directly sealed important deals with foreign partners such as the issuance of $100 million in international convertible bonds of Vincom in 2009, and $185 million international convertible bonds of Vingroup in 2012.\n\nOn March 12, 2013, in Geneva, Thuy, then vice chairwoman and CEO of Vingroup, was voted one of 199 Young Global Leaders (YGL) Class of 2013 by the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nUnder her leadership, VinFast, besides establishing its position in the domestic market, has gradually entered the world market with positive responses. After the second batch of electric vehicles exported to the U.S and Canada in April 2023, VinFast cars are expected to arrive in France, Germany and the Netherlands this year.\n\n\"The 48-year-old is at the wheel of VinFast, a money-losing electric vehicle maker racing U.S. entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Tesla on western roads,\" wrote Reuters in an article published in late 2022.\n\nNguyen Canh Hong, CEO of Eurowindow Holding\n\nBorn in 1971 in Thanh Chuong district, Nghe An province, Nguyen Canh Hong and his older brother Nguyen Canh Son founded and built Eurowindow Holding (EWH), a core legal entity of Eurowindow Group. He is now CEO and legal representative of the company, established in 2007.\n\nHong was vice chairman of the Vietnam Young Entrepreneurs Association for its fifth term, and chairman of the Sao Do (Red Star) Club in late 2018.\n\nOver more than 16 years of development, Eurowindow is now a multi-sector corporation that owns and controls a series of businesses operating in various fields, from plastic window production and commercial center operations, to construction and real estate.\n\nAmong its large-scale projects are the VND1 trillion ($42.6 million) Eurowindow Garden City in the north-central province of Thanh Hoa; the VND2 trillion ($85.2 million) Eurowindow River Park in Hanoi; and two projects worth VND3.5 trillion ($149.2 million) in Hanoi’s outlying district of Quoc Oai.\n\nNguyen Duc Thach Diem, CEO of Sacombank\n\nBorn in 1973, Sacombank CEO Nguyen Duc Thach Diem holds a master's degree in business administration and boasts 20 years of experience in the fields of economy, finance and banking. She has been working at Sacombank since 2002.\n\nBefore taking the \"hot seat\" at Sacombank, Diem was deputy CEO in charge of debt settlement, which was the focus of the bank's restructuring project. She was also deputy CEO in charge of the south-central and Central Highlands regions at Sacombank, leading the two regions to success over a number of years.\n\nCommenting on Diem, her associates said she is not only inspirational but also extremely strong and decisive. Under the leadership of the female CEO, together with chairman Duong Cong Minh, Sacombank has gradually overcome difficulties and re-established its position in the Vietnamese financial and banking market.\n\nIn 2023, Sacombank has targeted total assets of VND657.8 trillion ($28 billion) and total deposits of VND574.6 trillion ($24.5 billion), both up 11% year-on-year. The bank's consolidated pre-tax profit is targeted at VND9.5 trillion ($404.8 million), an increase of 50% from 2022.\n\nLe Hoang Diep Thao, founder & CEO of King Coffee\n\nLe Hoang Diep Thao, founder and CEO of the King Coffee brand, was born in 1973 into a gold and silver trading family in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai. Living in the country's coffee capital, Thao saw the potential benefits of coffee in the highland province. From 1998 to the end of 2014, she was co-founder and co-owner of Trung Nguyen Group with her then husband Dang Le Nguyen Vu.\n\nStarting her business in the coffee industry in the 90s, Thao has increasingly proved her outstanding mettle in the market. After separating from her husband, she opened her own coffee company, and King Coffee is a new page in her business career as CEO of TNI Corporation.\n\nTalking about the name \"King Coffee\", the entrepreneur said she had the desire to build a legendary international coffee brand that is recognized in global markets.\n\nKing Coffee quickly resonated in the world coffee market after it was officially launched in the U.S. in October 2016. The brand is present in other major markets such as South Korea, China, Russia, Australia, Singapore and Dubai.\n\nIn July 2017, Thao brought King Coffee back to the domestic market. In a very short time, under her management, the company has successfully deployed a product distribution system throughout 63 provinces and cities nationwide, receiving warm responses from many Vietnamese coffee lovers.\n\nKing Coffee has made many remarkable achievements. Especially in mid-2022, it was voted by Global Business Reviews as the fastest growing coffee brand in the UAE.\n\nNguyen Thanh Phuong, founder & CEO of Kangaroo JSC\n\nNguyen Thanh Phuong, born in 1978, is founder and CEO of the Vietnam-Australia Refrigration Electrical Engineering Group JSC (Kangaroo JSC), which has become well-known for its Kangaroo brand over the years.\n\nUnlike many other rich men, Phuong was born and grew up in a poor family by the Nhue River in the suburbs of Hanoi.\n\nWhen studying at the Hanoi University of Business and Technology, he and his friends took on different jobs just to get by.\n\nHe and his associates started their business in 2000 with more than 200 imported water purifiers. With initial capital of only VND148 million ($10,200 then), mostly borrowed, Phuong made Kangaroo JSC famous in Vietnam with water heaters and purifiers as its core business.\n\nAfter more than 20 years, Phuong's company has rapidly developed into a major manufacturer of household appliances in Vietnam. Currently, he also holds the role of Global CEO of Kangaroo JSC.\n\nTran Huy Thanh Tung, CEO of Mobile World\n\nBorn in 1970, Tran Huy Thanh Tung, CEO of Mobile World Investment Corporation (MWG), holds a bachelor's degree from the University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nTung is one of the five founders of the company, along with Le Quan, Nguyen Duc Tai, Dinh Anh Huan, and Dieu Chinh Hai Trieu.

Since April 2019, he has been a non-executive board member of Mobile World.\n\nThe businessman currently holds more than 11 million MWG shares, or 0.76%, with a value of more than VND430 billion ($18.3 million).\n\nNguyen Van Khoa, CEO of FPT Corp.\n\nNguyen Van Khoa, born in 1977, has been CEO of Vietnamese tech giant FPT Corporation since March 2019.\n\nWhen he was 20 years old, he was a technical supporter at “Tri tue Viet Nam” (Vietnam Talent), the first intranet network in Vietnam.
