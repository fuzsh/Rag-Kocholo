        "text": "The chief of the Joint General Staff (CJGS) is the presiding officer of Vietnam's Joint General Staff (JGS). The chief is the highest-ranking and most senior military officer in the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces and the principal military advisor to the president, the National Security Council, the Defence Staff Committee, and the minister of defence. While the chief of the Joint General Staff outranks all other commissioned officers, the chief is prohibited by law from having operational command authority over the armed forces; however, the chief does assist the president and the minister of defence in exercising their command functions.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe position of Chief of the Joint General Staff has a rich and illustrious history, dating back to the formation of the Republic of Vietnam in the mid-20th century. The concept of a unified military command structure was born out of the need to streamline and coordinate the armed forces of the nation during times of conflict and peace.\n\n1952: The Republic of Vietnam establishes the Joint General Staff Committee (JGSC) to serve as an advisory body to the government on military matters. However, it lacks a centralized leadership position.\n\n1953: In response to the increasing complexity of modern warfare and the need for strategic coordination, the position of Chief of the Joint General Staff is created. Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Hinh is appointed as the first Chief of the Joint General Staff, tasked with overseeing the planning, coordination, and execution of military operations across all branches of the armed forces.\n\n1955-1960: The position gains prominence during the subsequent period of post-war reconstruction. Chief of the Joint General Staff becomes a key advisor to the President and assumes a central role in national security decision-making.\n\n1960s: As the Cold War escalates, the Chief of the Joint General Staff plays a pivotal role in developing and implementing defense strategies, ensuring readiness of the armed forces, and coordinating joint military exercises with allied nations.\n\n1980s: With advancements in technology and the increasing complexity of warfare, the Chief of the Joint General Staff becomes responsible for overseeing the integration of cutting-edge military technologies and intelligence systems into the armed forces, enhancing their effectiveness and efficiency.\n\n2000s: The Chief of the Joint General Staff's role expands further to encompass global security challenges, such as counterterrorism, cyber warfare, and peacekeeping operations. They work closely with international military alliances and organizations to foster cooperation and strengthen defense partnerships.\n\n2020: The position undergoes a significant reform, with the Chief of the Joint General Staff being granted enhanced authority over resource allocation, defense budgeting, and strategic planning. This empowers the position to have a more decisive impact on the nation's military capabilities and preparedness.\n\nThroughout its history, the Chief of the Joint General Staff has been a symbol of military excellence, strategic thinking, and unwavering commitment to the defense and security of the Republic of Vietnam. The position continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing nature of warfare, ensuring that the nation's armed forces remain at the forefront of national defense.\n\nOrganization and assistants[]\n\nOrganization[]\n\nchief, Joint General Staff\n\nVice chief, Joint General Staff\n\nDirector, Unified Staff - assists the chief in his role as advisor to the President and Minister of Defence, coordinates and directs activities of the Unified Staff in support of the chief, and serves as the staff inspector general.\n\nVice Director, Unified Staff\n\nJ1 - Director, Manpower and Personnel\n\nJ2 - Director, Intelligence\n\nJ3 - Director, Operations\n\nJ4 - Director, Logistics\n\nJ5 - Director, Strategy, Plans, and Policy\n\nJ6 - Director, Command, Control, Communications, and Computers / Chief Information Officer\n\nJ7 - Director, Joint Force Development\n\nJ8 - Director, Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment\n\nDirector of Management\n\nJoint History Office - record activities of the chief and the Unified Staff\n\nAssistant to the chief - oversees matters requiring close personal control by the chief with particular focus on international relations and politico-military concerns\n\nSenior Enlisted Advisor to the chief (SEAC) - advisor to the chief on all matters involving joint and combined total force integration, utilization, health of the force, and joint development for enlisted personnel\n\nVice Chief of the Joint General Staff (VCJGS)[]\n\nThe vice chief is, by Vietnamese law, the second highest-ranking military officer in the Republic of Vietnam Military Forces, ranking just below the chief of the Joint General Staff. The vice chief outranks all respective heads of each service branch, with the exception of the chief, but does not have operational command authority over their service branches. The vice chief assists the chief in exercising their duties. In the absence of the chief, the vice chief presides over the meetings of the Joint General Staff and performs all other duties prescribed and may also perform other duties that the president, the chief, or the minister of defence prescribes.\n\nThe current vice chief is General Triệu Minh Khánh, who assumed office on 27 June 2022.\n\nAppointment and rank[]\n\nThe president of Vietnam has the sole authority to appoint a new chief. However, there is an unofficial list of candidates that the current service branch chiefs keep and they typically give the president their recommendation from this list. The list is unofficially called the Chiefs List (in Vietnamese Danh sách trưởng) however, it has no real binding appointment authority.\n\nThe RVNMF promotion schedule, generally caps the number of four-star generals to 75 across all branches of the armed forces, therefore most chiefs of the JGS at time of appointment were three-star generals or lower. However, in accordance to Vietnamese Military Code, adopted in 1951, upon appointment to the position of chief of the JGS, the new chief is automatically promoted to the next grade, unless they are already a prescribed four-star general.\n\nList of chiefs[]\n\n# Portrait Chief of the Joint General Staff (Rank at Appointment, Name) Took office Left office Time in office Service Branch President Notes 1 Lieutenant General\n\nNguyen Van Hinh 1 Mar 1953 23 Mar 1958 5 years, 22 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam\n\nBao Dai (State of Vietnam)\n\nNgô Đình Diệm\n\nWas Chief of the War Generals Council; predecessor of the chief of the Joint General Staff 2 Lieutenant General\n\nNguyễn Văn Hiếu 23 Mar 1958 12 Dec 1962 4 years, 8 months, 19 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Ngô Đình Diệm 3 General\n\nNguyễn Khánh 12 Dec 1962 15 Apr 1964 1 year, 4 months, 3 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Ngô Đình Diệm Left office to run for Senate 4 Lieutenant General\n\nNguyễn Hữu Có 15 Apr 1964 19 Oct 1965 1 year, 6 months, 4 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Nguyễn Văn Tâm 5 General\n\nCao Văn Viên 15 Oct 1965 26 Apr 1975 9 years, 6 months, 11 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam\n\nNguyễn Văn Tâm\n\nNguyễn Văn Thiệu\n\n6 Lieutenant General\n\nNgô Quang Trưởng 26 Apr 1975 18 Mar 1981 5 years, 10 months, 20 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Trần Lệ Xuân 7 Major General\n\nTrần Văn Minh 18 Mar 1981 6 Aug 1984 3 years, 4 months, 19 days\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Air Force Nguyễn Cao Kỳ 8 Rear Admiral\n\nTrần Văn Chơn 6 Aug 1984 22 Nov 1986 2 years, 3 months, 16 days\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Navy Nguyễn Cao Kỳ 9 Lieutenant General\n\nNgư Thế Sơn 22 Nov 1986 17 Nov 1991 4 years, 11 months, 26 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Nguyễn Cao Kỳ 10 General\n\nDiệp Hoàng Lâm 17 Nov 1991 24 Dec 1995 4 years, 1 month, 7 days\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Air Force Nguyễn Bá Cẩn 11 General\n\nHồ Ðức Tường 24 Dec 1995 19 Sep 2001 5 years, 8 months, 26 day\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Marines Trần Đức Lương 12 Admiral\n\nLiễu Trung Anh 19 Sep 2001 20 Jun 2006 4 years, 9 months, 1 day\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Navy Nguyễn Minh Triết 13 Lieutenant General\n\nNguyễn Tiến Võ 20 Jun 2006 14 Feb 2011 4 years, 7 months, 25 days\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Air Force Nguyễn Minh Triết 14 Lieutenant General\n\nĐào Bảo Quốc 14 Feb 2011 12 May 2014 3 years, 2 months, 28 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Nguyễn Minh Triết 15 General\n\nPhạm Anh Quân 12 May 2014 16 Nov 2017 3 years, 6 months, 4 days\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam Nguyễn Phú Trọng 16 Admiral\n\nNguyễn Trị Bịnh 16 Nov 2017 26 Jun 2022 4 years, 7 months, 10 days\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Navy Nguyễn Phú Trọng 17 General\n\nDoãn Trọng Nghĩa 26 Jun 2022 Present\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Marines Nguyễn Trọng Việt\n\nChairmen by service branch[]\n\nArmy of the Republic of Vietnam — 9\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Navy — 3\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Air Force — 3\n\nRepublic of Vietnam Marines — 2"
