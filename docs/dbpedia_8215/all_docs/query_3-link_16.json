        "text": "Chuck Searcy is a U.S. Army veteran living in Hanoi. Back in 1967, he worked in military intelligence as part of the 519th Battalion in Saigon. Today he’s an international advisor to Project RENEW, an organization he helped start in 2001 to work with the Vietnamese to clean up unexploded ordnance (UXO) and provide medical assistance, rehabilitation, and income generation for UXO victims.Their focus is on the Quang Tri province, where 97 percent of the villages were destroyed by bombs during the Vietnam War.\n\nThe 2 Sides Project got a preview of Project RENEW’s work while we were in Vietnam, but last minute travel plans didn’t allow us to meet Chuck in person. We recently caught up via Skype to talk about his work and get his reflections on Veterans Day. Chuck spoke from his home office in central Hanoi. His gentle southern accent (he hails from Athens, Georgia) mixed harmoniously with the bleeps from scooter horns on the street below as people made their way through the morning commute. It was the perfect blend of the American and Vietnamese that has been a hallmark of Chuck’s life for the last two decades.\n\nHow long have you lived in Hanoi?\n\nI initially came here with the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation (VVAF). They had a grant from the State Department to bring in equipment, technology and training to assist Vietnam in providing braces to children with diseases or birth defects, and they asked me to stay for a few years to set up the program. That was 20 years ago.\n\nWere you one of the first veterans to go back?\n\nThere was an early, important delegation that came in 1981 headed by Bobby Muller, the founder of the VVAF, to meet with the Vietnamese and talk about initiatives and cooperation. That opened the door to tentative discussions about future relationships. I came back in 1992 as a tourist. Back then the situation was still quite chilled between the U.S. and Vietnam.\n\nYet you went back. Why?\n\nI left Vietnam in 1968 angry and bitter because I felt the war was a tragic mistake, and that we had not been told the truth by the U.S. government. The reality I found in Vietnam during the war was very different from what we had been told. I had no anger or fear toward the Vietnamese. I thought they were innocent victims of something beyond their control. I left hoping to come back some day, in a time of peace. I didn’t know when or how, but I never abandoned that thought. In 1992 I met an Army friend for dinner and it turned out he had the same thoughts and desires. At the end of that dinner we’d decided we were going to Vietnam as tourists.\n\nWhat was it like to return?\n\nAs we were flying into Saigon, we looked down and could see small villages turn into urban areas and then cities, and as we came closer we could recognize motor bikes and water buffalo and rice fields. And then we both had a panic attack. What were we doing? We were two former GIs, and we thought these people are going to hate us after what they went through. But within an hour after landing and being out on the streets in Saigon, we were astonished to find how warm and welcoming everyone was. There was no animosity or anger toward us, and that was the case over the next 30 days as we traveled throughout the country. There was never a harsh word or mean look, from anyone.\n\nWhat impressed you most on that trip?\n\nDuring the war I had been assigned to Saigon and couldn’t get out of there. But on this trip we went from Saigon to Hanoi and back again, and every place in between. I could see Vietnam was in dire straits. The roads, the electrical grid, the telephone connections, everything was in terrible shape. There were bomb craters all over country. The people were poor, and the embargo was still on. It was hard to see this beautiful country struggle. I thought about what I could do to come back and help with the recovery.\n\nSo you started with the VVAF program. What led to Project RENEW?\n\nOver those years I spent working on the VVAF program, there were always questions about the nature of some of the deformities and mobility problems we saw in the Vietnamese, and what caused them. I was aware of the Agent Orange situation as a vet, but I realized we didn’t know much about it. And there were stories in the paper every week of kids getting blown up by cluster bombs. As I looked into it more, I learned that 100,000 children and adults had been killed by UXO since the end of the war. The Vietnamese didn’t push the issue. They were very circumspect and polite and said they were sure the U.S. would help at some point and do the right thing.\n\nVarious NGOs came in to work on the issue, but we weren’t coordinated, and in the end the Vietnamese asked that we come together with an integrated approach to deal with bombs and mines. That proved challenging. In 2000, a delegation from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund came to Vietnam. At the end of their tour they asked if they could do something, and I suggested they focus on the Vietnamese request to coordinate, and to use the Quang Tri area as a testing ground. They agreed and raised $500,000 to get it started. That was the origin of Project RENEW. We worked with the provincial government and their staff, who still lead the program with our support and technical assistance.\n\nSo many friends and family were really a comfort to us as we struggled with our loss each day. As Jerilyn’s own family grew, she would bring her children to our home, and the conversation would always turn to Dan. She really wanted her kids to know about their uncle. She said one night that she would go to Vietnam one day. We knew she meant it.\n\nJerilyn and Danaan started PeaceTrees after Bun died. I moved to be closer to her, and went to the PeaceTrees office frequently. But I didn’t leave in peace and joy because the thought that kept coming to me was they are working where we lost Dan. I knew their mission well, but kept thinking, I have one more child going back to that country. Is that going to be ok with me? I really struggled with that.\n\nJerilyn eventually asked if I would help write thank you cards to donors. One day, as I was writing these words of kindness, it suddenly came to me that there were many, many mothers who were suffering in Vietnam, the same as me. And with that thought in mind I began to feel some peace. I could recognize the fact that I wasn’t alone.\n\nYear after year volunteers came back and talked about what they saw and how they felt, and how kind the Vietnamese were. No one ever said they felt insecure or unsafe, it was just so positive every step of the way. There was a moment when I thought ok, I can do this. I was at home one day and actually got my suitcase down, and then I thought about all the complications to get a visa. I put the bag back. I know now why I hesitated. It was beyond my fondest dream that I could ever go where Dan lost his life.\n\nBy early 2010, PeaceTrees had formed a board, and I was a member. At our meeting in January the director stood before we started and said he wanted to talk about something. He wanted to extend an invitation to me to cut the ribbons on a kindergarten and library in Vietnam that they wanted to build to honor Dan. Well, I had to go, didn’t I?\n\nIn September of that year, 19 people boarded the plane with me. They called themselves “Rae’s Merry Band.” We touched down in Hanoi. Our luggage was trapped in the hold, so we had just a moment to fluff ourselves up and go to our first official meeting. The senior-most members of the Vietnam Union of Friendship Organization (VUFO) were there, and so were TV cameras. They were broadcasting live. Mr. Vu Xuan Hong, VUFO’s head, stood and spoke into the cameras. He announced that today it was his great honor to welcome “Mother Rae Cheney” and to present to me, on behalf of the President and the Prime Minister, The Medal for Peace and Friendship Among Nations, the highest honor given to a foreign citizen. They pinned the medal on me and then motioned for me to stand and speak. I recall expressing how long it had taken to make up my mind to come. I apologized for that, because I felt they were waiting for me.\n\nWhen did you start writing about your war experience?\n\nWhen I returned to California in 1967, after my tour in Vietnam. I became a journalism major and editor of the college newspaper, and wrote about the veterans on campus. I then went to Israel as a freelance journalist and covered the 1973 war. But there was a moment when I decided to concentrate more on fiction than journalism. One day three men came over the border from Lebanon and killed a family. They later took hostages in a high school. The siege came to a head when the Israelis stormed the school and killed the men. Many students also died during the incident. As I watched the relatives taking the bodies out and photographed them, I felt like a vulture. It’s important to be a witness, but I realized then that the only way you can really get at the truth of things is, contradictorily enough, through fiction, when you can explore not just what happens, but what it’s like to be in someone else’s mind, to go beyond your own witness. I started working on my fiction more than journalism at that point.\n\nWhat was your first published piece?\n\nIt was a short story called Search and Destroy, which was included in one of the first published collections of stories by Vietnam Veterans called Free Fire Zone. I wrote it based on an actual experience. We were living in tents at Marble Mountain, and the tents were infested with rats. They were running over our bodies at night. In the story, the men hunt the rats with spears, but they’re always getting away. One night they trap a mother rat and her babies. Frustrated by war, by taking so many casualties, these men torture the rats to death, all the while calling them “gooks.” They’re in a trance as they do it. It wasn’t a traditional combat narrative, but it stood so much for the emotional truth of war. First Casualty Press published the book, and it received great reviews. I joined the press as its fiction editor but after a few years the press broke up due to lack of funding, and I decided to turn away from writing about the Vietnam War, and after my time in Israel and travels in Europe, particularly Yugoslavia, I wrote a spy novel set in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nBut you came eventually came back to the subject of the Vietnam War. How did that happen?\n\nI was invited to a summer writer’s workshop at the William Joiner Institute for the Study of War and Social Consequences in Boston. It was started by veterans, and other writers like Tim O’Brien and Phil Caputo were in it. This was back in 1988, and for the first time writers from Vietnam were invited to join. I had never met anyone who had been on the other side of the war. Three Vietnamese came, and they had similar backgrounds to us in that they had fought in the war and then became writers. It was a controversial meeting. This was well before normalization, and the Vietnamese American community did not want these guys in the U.S. We were going to hold an event at the Boston Public Library but there was going to be a riot. So we ended up meeting in the attic of a house. We were very curious about each other. It was an interesting dialogue, but we didn’t get very personal with them that year.\n\nHow does a black man reach out to members of the KKK?\n\nIt was purely by chance. I was playing with a country music band at a lounge one night, the only black guy in the place. At the end of the set, I went over to sit at the band table and a white guy came up to me and said he really enjoyed the music. He said it was the first time he’d seen a black man play the piano like Jerry Lee Lewis. I asked him if he knew that Jerry Lee Lewis got his style from blacks, playing black music. He didn’t believe me. Turns out he was a Klansman, and he started to come in regularly with other Klan members just to hear me play.\n\nSome years later, I contacted that Klansman and asked him if he could put me in touch with the state Klan leader, called a Grand Dragon, to interview him for a book I wanted to write. He reluctantly gave me the Grand Dragon’s phone number on the condition that I not tell the him how I came to get it. He warned me not to go to the Grand Dragon’s house because he would kill me. The Grand Dragon’s name was Roger. I had my secretary call him and ask if I could interview him for a book, telling her not to reveal I am black. Roger agreed and came to see us with an armed bodyguard. They did a double take when they realized the interview was with a black man, but they sat down, and we ended up talking for a couple of hours.\n\nWhat happened when you asked him your question?\n\nRoger said I was simply inferior to him. He said black people have smaller brains, they’re less accomplished than whites. He said now that slavery was over, all black people should go back to Africa. I spoke freely, and I let him speak freely. Because when you’ve established dialogue, when two enemies are talking, they’re not fighting. If you spend just five minutes talking to someone, even your worst enemy, you’ll find you have something in common. If you spend ten minutes, you’ll find more. Over time you’ll find a lot in common and the things you had in contrast, like skin color, begin to matter less.\n\nI started to get together with Roger after that. He never invited me to his house, but I’d call him and invite him to come on an errand with me, and Roger and his bodyguard would drive around with me. Later, Roger came alone to my house. When he was promoted to Imperial Wizard, which is a national leader, he started to invite me to his home and Klan rallies.\n\nWhy on earth was he doing all this?\n\nAt that point he had developed a respect for me. He believed he wanted to treat me fairly. And he was giving me the information he wanted to give me for my book.\n\nIs he one of the ones who eventually left the KKK?\n\nYes. And he spoke out about his leaving publicly. But in the end he became reclusive. Whenever his employer saw in the media that he’d been a member of the KKK, he’d always lose his job.\n\nWhat has been your most difficult encounter?\n\nSome people just won’t change. That’s hard. But I think it’s hardest when I meet their children. It’s sad to see what their kids are living with. I give about 60 lectures a year all over the country. Sometimes, when I’m packing up and answering final questions, I’ll see a student standing off to the side. I always know what’s up. He’s waiting for the crowd to go away and then he’ll approach. I play dumb, waiting for the moment when he tells me one of his parents is in the KKK, that he’s met more people at university and is dating a black or Jewish girl, or he’s friends with people from Pakistan. These students will tell me they can’t bring their friends home because their parents will disown them, and they can’t tell their friends about their background because they will lose them. So they’re harboring this secret and can’t let it out. They have to tell someone, and they tell me.\n\nWhat have you learned from these encounters?\n\nKids are resilient. They’re raised a certain way and then they come to college with people from all over the world and realize these people are human beings and they have a lot in common. The same is true with the 2 Sides Project. You put these kids together and they think all they have in common is they lost a parent in war. But you have to get kids together earlier, kids who have lost parents senselessly due to recent wars. They have a lot of years ahead of them to change things, and they will.\n\nWe have that goal, to help any child from any war connect with the other side. But we wonder if it’s too early to do so.\n\nTime heals wounds, but right now, while all the feelings are still present, it’s a good time to bring people together. The children of those who have been killed didn’t have any choice. They were thrown into it. They don’t have the animosity toward the other side as much as adults do. Kids get along better and they have better ideas about how to get along. They accept each other more readily than adults do. Bring these kids together and I guarantee you that as they grow older, they’ll make better decisions, and we’ll have less war. We may not live to see it, but you will have had an effect on them because they will have come to their senses earlier.\n\nWhat I’ve learned is that ignorance breeds fear. If we don’t keep that fear in check, it will breed hatred. If we don’t keep the hatred in check, it will breed destruction. So we have to talk. When two enemies are talking, they’re not fighting. They may be yelling and screaming and beating their fists on the table, but at least they are talking. It’s when the talking ceases, that the ground becomes fertile for violence. So let’s keep the conversation going.\n\nA week from today, President Obama will be in Vietnam. Everything we’re reading says he’ll focus on the future rather than the past. This forward-looking perspective is, of course, vital, but we know firsthand that the shadow of war is inescapable. Every battle starts in the past, and history directs where the first shot in the next war should land. Every conflict extends into the future, echoing in the minds, bodies and spirits of those who live on, long after their dead are gone.\n\nWe’ve met so many people who are living in the aftermath of the Vietnam/American War. There are the sons and daughters on both sides who never knew their fathers, but only feel that presence in the hole left in their families. There are the children born with defects, their bodies carrying forward the awful legacy of Agent Orange/dioxin. And there are the veterans on both sides who can never forget what they did, what happened to them, and who they left behind.\n\nIt’s this idea about the aftermath of war that got us thinking we should write a letter to the President. We had no idea how we’d get it into his hands. But sometimes a path just magically appears. Late last week, our contacts at the Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) said that National Security Advisor Susan Rice was looking for any letters from citizens that the President should see before his trip. They brought our letter forward. We learned this weekend that it’s been included in the briefing book that the President will read on his way to Vietnam.\n\nThe hope is our message, that a future with Vietnam must be guided by the past, will resonate with the President. It’s an idea expressed eloquently on the Hiroshima War Memorial, which Obama will also visit later in the week: “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.”\n\nMay 2016\n\nDear Mr. President,\n\nWe are a group of sons and daughters who lost fathers in the Vietnam War, and we recently traveled to Vietnam with two aims: to visit the sites where our fathers were killed, and to meet the other side—Vietnamese sons and daughters whose fathers died fighting ours. After living in the shadow of the war for nearly 50 years and hearing only one side of the story, it was time to hear the other.\n\nThese were unprecedented meetings. We were nervous we’d receive a cool reception or encounter animosity. But some of the strongest encouragement for the idea came from the Vietnamese side. Dr. Hoang at the Embassy of Vietnam in Washington D.C. said that over the years, our countries had come together, “but our people have not, and your project can help.”\n\nThis people-to-people connection is what we sought in Vietnam, and it’s what we found. We were warmly welcomed by more than 20 sons and daughters throughout the country. We shared experiences, comforted each other, and found common ground. We agreed that our fathers would have been proud that we had come together. Our trip, which was featured on the front page of The New York Times on Christmas Day, was organized by the Vietnam USA Society, a group founded at the end of World War II as the first bilateral friendship organization for the people of Vietnam and the U.S. Their leaders have since become our partners, and our friends.\n\nWe know that part of your mission in going to Vietnam is to discuss ways to advance cooperation across many areas, including people-to-people cooperation. We’d love to share more about our experiences with you and Mrs. Obama on your return, and find out how we can extend this important effort in the future to others affected by the Vietnam War, and eventually to any child from any war.\n\nWe also hope that your focus for Vietnam includes action on the matter of Agent Orange/dioxin. It wasn’t until we went to Vietnam that we understood the killing continues today. Agent Orange/dioxin still causes birth defects and premature death among children, and kills those who were exposed to the chemicals during the war. While clean up has been underway for years, the U.S. has never truly finished the job. A future with Vietnam that doesn’t acknowledge the past or our own responsibility to help strengthen the country from the ground up will never be stable. Our hope is that you will commit the time and resources needed to help the Vietnamese finally clean the land of its poison, and create the strongest foundation for its future.\n\nBefore our visit, we knew only that Vietnam was the place where our fathers died. Now we know it’s so much more. May you too find it to be a place of great beauty, charm, and endless possibility.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nMargot Carlson Delogne, Daughter of Air Force Captain John W. Carlson, KIA (BNR, MIA) December 7, 1966 and founder of the 2 Sides Project. Contact details below.\n\nMike Burkett, son of Army SP4 Curtis Earl Burkett, killed on February 19, 1971 in Quang Ngai Province.\n\nPatty Young Loew, daughter of HM1 Jack Young, Navy, killed near Da Nang on March 11, 1969.\n\nSusan Mitchell-Mattera, daughter of James C. Mitchell Jr., killed near Cao Lanh City on January 8, 1970.\n\nRon Reyes, son of PFC Ronald Reyes (USMC 1st battalion / 9th Marines), killed at Khe Sanh on March 30, 1968.\n\nMargaret Von Lienen, daughter of Navy pilot Robert Saavedra (MIA), shot down over the province of Ha Tinh on April 28, 1968.\n\nMargaret’s father, Navy pilot and Commander Robert Saavedra, was shot down over the province of Ha Tinh 48 years ago today, April 28, 1968. He is still listed as MIA because his remains have never been found. The U.S. government recently excavated a site and found evidence, including a piece of cord. They told Margaret and her family that they’d have to test it to see what it was, and if it came from the right kind of plane. The tests couldn’t be done for months, long after Margaret’s visit to Vietnam. She went anyway, armed with maps of that site, knowing the unknown.\n\nWe had to meet with province officials before we could travel to the site. Five of them were waiting for us at a local office. We spent what felt like hours going over maps, arguing about the exact location. In the end we realized they were trying to steer Margaret to another spot entirely. They said if she wanted to go to the place on her personal maps, she’d have to get permission from another official in another province. By this time it was late afternoon. The light was quickly fading and we were still a good drive away. We called the other province office, got no answer, and took off.\n\nWe were forced to stop with just six miles to go. The dirt road ahead was filled with deep ruts, and the locals told us our bus would never make it. We flagged down a van and bartered with the driver to take us. We finally reached the area at dusk and climbed up a steep hill to get closer. The GPS said the actual spot was just beyond, in a tangle of trees that was impossible to walk through. So we stood in a nearby clearing to honor Robert Saavedra. Margaret and photographer Anthony Istrico talk more about the whole experience below.\n\nThings got a little scary just after we left. A few miles away, several people stood in the middle of the road to block our way. The official we’d tried to call was one of them. He was so angry that we had passed through his area without permission that he had an official escort us to the police station to explain ourselves. As we pulled into a small courtyard framed by government buildings, the escort closed and locked the gate behind us. Our trip leader was led into an office. We were left in the van. The engine was off, and it was pitch dark. Guards ambled up to check us out. One flashed his light into the van, looking at our faces. Villagers started to gather behind us, peering through the gate, their voices either nervous or just giddy that something interesting was happening.\n\nAfter a while, Ron and Mike got out of the car and smoked cigarettes with the guards. That relaxed everyone a bit. Later, we were invited to have a drink with the officials and to surrender our passports for inspection. We apologized for having come without permission. They apologized for stopping us. They wanted to make sure we knew it had nothing to do with the war. They handed us our passports and told us we could go. We got back in the van and got the hell out of there.\n\nMargaret just received an update from the U.S. government on that piece of cord. They couldn’t place it to anything a pilot would have had in his plane or on his person. They confirmed the site was an A4 crash site, but are still unsure of the model. They also said that they had heard from a villager who thinks the crash site might be on the other side of the road. The government has promised to do a site survey there, but nothing has been scheduled.\n\nOn this day, we’re honoring Margaret’s father, and acknowledging the unknown that hangs over her family. We hope they get closure soon, and that her father can finally return home. Until then, we’ll remember that site visit, and its adventures, for a long time to come.\n\nAnthony: We thought as filmmakers going into this project, focused on the idea of two sides, that the most significant thing would be the sons and daughters meetings. It turns out that there were so many other dimensions of the two sides at play. You had Americans in Vietnam, you had the Vietnam we knew only from war movies and the Vietnam we actually saw - which was crazy and vibrant and colorful and beautiful and dirty all at the same time. In the end, the meetings between the sons and daughters were really important, and feature prominently in the film, but the most important meeting turned out to be the one everyone had with the country itself. I hope that’s what you see in the trailer, the entirety of the two sides idea.\n\nNora: The story is still unfolding in front of us, but the trailer shows the film is about a journey to peace and understanding, and about the bigger meeting of the two sides—America and Vietnam. In going across the world to visit the sites where their fathers died and to meet the people on the other side, these six Americans were able to find answers, get closure (for some), and to learn a little more about themselves along the way. It was an adventure, but more than anything it was an emotional journey. I wanted it to feel personal, and chose particular scenes that show we are about to embark on a journey, but I didn’t want to give too much away.\n\nDid you know what kind of documentary you wanted to make before you started filming?\n\nAnthony: One thing I didn’t want to do is make a travelogue. I wanted to show the transformative journey these sons and daughters went on, which is really the culmination of a journey they’ve been on their entire lives. It’s incredible to think of how long the aftermath of war endures. Each person on this trip has lived with their loss for 40 or 50 years. Most had never been to Vietnam, and didn’t even have the desire to go until they heard of this project. They were just ready for it. But they didn’t know what to expect, or what they would feel. In the end I think they found something they’d searched for all along: their fathers, and themselves.\n\nWhat approach did you take with the actual filming?\n\nAnthony: Much of the work I do is scripted, so doing this documentary was both refreshing and frightening. Jared and I had to be cognizant of what was happening because the story was unfolding before us. My biggest struggle was how do I stay focused on the message I am getting while not tuning out the other things that are happening around me, which can be just as significant. In the end Vietnam was a character, and the largest variable to try to manage. The framing of that character was really important. So, of the two cameras we had with us, one took a macro view, the wide scene, and the other a micro view. It was the outside looking in, and the inside looking out, so we could show the two sides of what was happening.\n\nWhat is one scene that really stands out that is central to the film?\n\nNora: One of my favorite scenes is one leading up to the VTV interview. Margot and Patty are about to be interviewed on national television in Vietnam. We watch these two American women entering a Vietnamese TV studio, we hear Vietnamese being spoken, and at this point in the film we’re wondering why they’re in Vietnam, what’s this interview going to be? We see inside the control room. There is awkwardness on both sides and a sense of tension, and it’s really quite sweet and perfect. We are in their environment; they are trying to communicate together. We are watching the efforts of both sides to connect. It has a “Lost in Translation” feel. I love it because it sets the mood.\n\nAnthony: That’s like asking a parent to choose their favorite child, so I’d just like to go on record and say that every shot is special, every frame we captured added to the story. When you capture as much footage as we did, what really happens is that you start crafting your story from the second you hit record. Even if a particular shot doesn’t make it into the film, it has impacted the film and the way in which we look at subjects, scenes and story lines. There are two shots that replay in my mind over and over again. The first one was at the last meeting we held between the sons and daughters on both sides. We had been to three meetings before that and felt we knew what to expect. All of a sudden a Vietnamese son, with anger, passion and fear in his eyes, clenched his fists, stood up and basically broke down. He explained that he had come here and was ready to hate, but he realized he was more similar than different to those who sat across from him. The second clip that plays over and over is when we were at the site where Margot’s father’s plane crashed. The site visits were generally in wide open spaces, with valleys and vistas that went on for days, and usually both Jared and I were filming. But on this day we had to split up in order to cover two unique sites, so I was alone. As soon as we arrived at Margot’s site, my eye was drawn not to the grandeur of the place, but the intimacy of it. Many of my shots from that day are macro style shots, a very narrow view. There is one image where Margot, kneeling in a depression in the earth where her father’s plane may have crashed, begins to dig into the soil with her fingers as she makes her peace. I’ll never forget that image.\n\nAnthony, you said before we started out that you thought this trip would change you. Has it?\n\nAnthony: I was really hoping to lose a few pounds, but we ate so well, that didn’t happen. I thought the trip would slow me down, make me appreciate life more, because I was surrounded by people who had lost so much. I mean I’m always running around, busy, doing all kinds of things and going everywhere. What is did for me was, as cliché as it sounds, it forced me to slow down. I find that whenever I have a camera in my hands, I look at things differently, and this trip has given me pause about everything I see now. I take nothing for granted and I appreciate the simplicity and beauty of everything, things I didn’t even notice before. Traveling with the first six and encountering so many warm and welcoming people, people who in the face of such struggle do nothing but smile, it reiterated our belief that when you are fortunate, you should give back, which is why we are donating our time to such a worthy project.\n\nNora, you didn’t go on the trip, but you have the responsibility to tell the story. That’s such pressure!\n\nNora: When everyone was in Vietnam, I was terrified. I ordered all these books and maps, and started doing all this research, because I thought I didn’t know enough about the history of the war and the place. It was giving me a lot of anxiety. I thought, “Can I learn all I need to know to be able to tell this story?” It all clicked when I got the footage. I do know how to tell this story, and it hasn’t yet been told. This is a side of the war people need to see. The children, their moms, the parents - they all have a story too. That was very freeing for me. I initially felt a big responsibility to make it a historical piece, but really it’s personal piece, a human story, in the context of history.\n\nWhen I think about stories, the ones that stay with you are the ones that hold the mirror back at you. As a viewer, you’re always trying to find that something to relate to. I know that people watching this will be able to relate somehow. Maybe it will make them think about what judgments they have in their lives about anybody or any thing on another side. The film shows us that we are all connected; we all have the same emotions, we all have moms and dads, we all have families and experience loss. It forces us to take a look at our own prejudices. To think about what might be missing in our own lives, and perhaps inspire us to seek our own answers. I hope this film will help people do that."
