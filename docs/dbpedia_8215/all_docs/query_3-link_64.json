        "text": "Master Tran Huy Phong knowing that he did not have much time to live, in parallel with the drafting of his lifetime work, master Tran Huy Phong was aware of the importance of his position regarding the reestablishment of the governing body of Vovinam Viet Vo Dao. It is for this reason that he wrote a “letter from the heart” on 19-03-1995, from Gustave Roussy Hospital (France) to the masters of all countries, calling on them to unite to find a solution for the future of Vovinam Viet Vo Dao.\n\nThis call had created a great emotion among all the masters who had responded positively. Six months later, Master Trần Huy Phong and the most senior masters including the masters of the former 1964 Council of Masters had issued the Declaration of Formally Establishing the Council of Masters to lead Vovinam Viet Vo Dao on 16-09-1995, and Master Trần Nguyên Đạo had been given the mission of organizing the 2nd World Congress of Vovinam Việt Võ Đạo.\n\nOver the 16th and 17th August 1996, the Congress II was held in Paris – France, under the chairmanship of Master Trần Huy Phong, with a massive participation of masters around the world. From this congress, 2 governing bodies of Vovinam Viet Vo Dao are created and which continue their activity until today:\n\n• The World Council of Masters of Vovinam-Việt Võ Đạo\n\n• The World Federation of Vovinam-Việt Võ Đạo.\n\nMaster Ngo Huu Lien was elected to the position of President of the World Federation of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao (the first president for the term 1996-2000)\n\nMaster Nguyen Van Cuong was elected to the position of General Secretary of the World Council of Masters of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao.\n\nCouncil Members: Master Hà Trọng Thịnh, Master Phan Dương Bình, Master Lê Trọng Hiệp, Master Phan Quỳnh\n\nIn 1964, all the leading Vovinam Masters met and formed the new discipline of martial arts. “VIET VO DAO” (“THE PHILOSOPHY OF VIETNAMESE MARTIAL ARTS”) was added to become “VOVINAM-VIET VO DAO.” All the leading masters had developed a proposal and created a program in order to institutionalize Vovinam Viet Vo Dao. They had founded the first Council of Masters as the central organization of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao. Master Le Sang had been elected to the position of Patriarch, Master Tran Huy Phong was the second important figure of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao and Master Ngo Huu Lien was the president of the Legal Commission\n\n1. Training Commission directed by Grand Master Le Sang who was responsible to develop the training curriculum and to certify masters and instructors.\n\n2. Viet Vo Dao Youth Association led by Master Tran Huy Phong was responsible for youth and social activities.\n\nThe hierarchy of the Council of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao:\n\nFunctionNameGrand MasterMaster Le SangAssistant Grand Master and Director of Planning CommissionMaster Tran Huy PhongGeneral SecretaryMaster Phan QuynhDirector of Public Relation CommissionMaster Phung Manh Chu (nick: Manh Hoang)Director of General Management CommissionMaster Nguyen Van ThuDirector of Legal CommissionMaster Ngo Huu LienDirector of Ceremony CommissionMaster Tran Ban QueDirector of the Treasury CommissionMaster Nguyen Van ThongTraining CommissionMaster Tran Huy Phong (Director), Nguyen Van Thu, Tran Duc Hop, Nguyen Van Thong, Tran The Phuong.\n\nThe first Council of Masters in 1964\n\nLeft/right : Ngô Hữu Liễn, Phan Quỳnh, Nguyễn Văn Thư, Lê Sáng,\n\nTrần Huy Phong, Nguyễn Văn Thông and Trần Bản Quế\n\nThe Council of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao also established the rank hierarchy and uniforms as well as a training curriculum according to the rank.\n\nThe ranks of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao is as follow:\n\nWhite Belt: Grand Master Le Sang\n\nRed Belt:\n\nRed Belt II: Master Tran Huy Phong\n\nRed Belt I: Masters Nguyen Van Thu\n\nYellow-Stripe Red Belt: Masters Nguyen Van Thong, Tran Duc Hop, Phung Manh Chu, Tran Ban Que, Phan Quynh, Ngo Huu Lien, Nguyen Van Cuong, Tran The Phuong.\n\nThe first training center was opened in 61 Vinh Vien (Eternal) Street, Saigon; then numerous training centers were also opened in Saigon such as Tran Hung Dao, Hoa Lu… The philosophical knowledge was also researched and published.\n\nNote:\n\nCouncil of Masters (Central Directorate)\n\nThe Central Directorate (the Council of Masters) is a collegial management body. Defined by the 1964 statutes, its role is to command, manage and administer Vovinam activities, unlike the post of patriarch which is more of a symbolic function. For the first time in 26 years of existence (1938-1964), the Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao has a collective management body, responding to the principles: collegial, democratic, impartial, with a modern operating method such as: elections, collective decision, statutes, internal regulations,\n\nNourished by this great aspiration, in addition to perfecting himself in culture and virtue, he endeavored to study and train in most of Vietnamese martial arts. Thanks to his extraordinary physical strength and his great talent, he is making exceptional progress. He travels extensively, visiting all the training halls and speaking with former officers of the Imperial Army (Quan Võ) as well as renowned great masters in the Vietnamese martial arts community. His goal was to enrich his knowledge of martial arts.\n\nHe has extensively studied and worked on aspects such as: the specialties, characteristics, advantages and shortcomings of all martial disciplines. He thus noticed that each martial art has its advantages and disadvantages and if one practiced only one discipline, one would not quickly obtain the desired results. In addition, to reach a good level, the practitioner must make a long-term commitment, approximately more than 10 years. We must therefore find a new training method in order to reach the right level within a reasonable time.\n\nTo achieve this, he begins by codifying his method of learning taking traditional wrestling and Vietnamese martial arts as a foundation; then he compared and selected the advantages and strengths of each discipline to give birth, in 1938, to a new discipline which he called Vovinam.\n\nHe then decides to experiment with his method by secretly training some of his relatives of the same age. During this experimental period and according to the testimony of Mr. Nguyễn Đăng Hiển, one of his first students, Master Nguyễn Lộc attached great importance to basic techniques such as: positions (Tấn), fist (Đấm), kicks (Đá), cutting edges (Chém), parries (Gạt), elbows (Chỏ), knees (Gối) etc. It also adds a pragmatic system of key and release techniques (Khoá Gỡ), traditional wrestling techniques (Vật), scissors techniques (Đòn Chân) and especially partner training techniques (Song Luyện). After a successful experimental year, which exceeded his expectations, he made the decision to present Vovinam to the public in the fall of 1939, during a demonstration at the Hanoi Opera House – Vietnam.\n\nBecause of his good public relations and communication skills, Master Manh Hoang managed to secure two large centers for Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao from 1965 to April 1975. Those were the Hoa Lu stadium (later named the Youth Training Center by Master Tran Huy Phong), 2 Bis Dinh Tien Hoang street, and the Lam Son stadium, Tran Binh Trong street, behind the Petrus Truong Vinh Ky high school.\n\nSince the number of students practicing Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao increased rapidly after a short period of time, hundreds of classes were opened and admitted thousands of students in Saigon and provinces. There was a serious need for instructors. Many masters and instructors had to teach 10-11 hours a day, seven days a week; even the third-degree blue belt students were required to teach. Finally, because of high demand and low supply, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao had to refuse to open new classes.\n\nIn early 1966, Master Manh Hoang persuaded the National Police Department to allow Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao to be taught for the police officers. First many instructor-training classes were initiated in the National Police Headquarter, and the newly instructors were sent to the regional police departments to start Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao there. Even Grand Master Le Sang and the masters like Nguyen Van Thong, Phan Quynh, Trinh Ngoc Minh, Le Cong Danh, Tran Van Be… taught these classes. In the same time, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao collected a financial grant from the police funds.\n\nIn 1966, South Korea persuades the Central Military Command of the Republic of Vietnam to allow Teakwood to be taught solely in the army. Upon hearing that decision, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao declared that this was a shame to the Vietnamese martial arts of more than 4000 years. On the National Sorrow Day, July 20, 1966, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao organized a vigil attended by thousands of disciples in the Plant-Animal Park (Thao Cam Vien), Saigon to protest the army’s use of foreign martial arts. This vigil, widely supported by the media, touched the Vietnamese nationwide. Even the Military Intelligence Agency and the Presidential Political Bureau started to investigated this event and the organizers. Even master Manh Hoang, Tran Huy Phong, Phan Quynh… were personally interrogated by Colonel Thang, Director of the Military Intelligence Agency. However, because of the persistence and the just cause, the Central Military Command issues a second order to allow Vovinam, Judo and Taekwondo to be taught in the military.\n\nIn early 1967, Master Manh Hoang convinced Lieutenant Colonel Thuy of the Military Police of the III Corps to open many training sessions for the Military Police in Bien Hoa.\n\nIn late 1967, Master Manh Hoang passed away unexpectedly because of advanced diabetes. Only 29, Master Manh Hoang made many great contributions to the growth of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao in the 60s.\n\nFrom 1968, Vovinamization of Armed Forces was initiated in the Central Military Command, the 18th Army Division, the Military Police of the III Corps, the Air Force and Naval Academy of Nha Trang, the IV Corps, the IV Reinforcement Corps, the 16th Armor Division, the 81th Airborne Brigade, the 21st Army Division, the 9th Army Division Academy, the Navy of Long Xuyen, the Navy of Binh Thuy, the 3rd Army Division… In the same year, Vovinamization of Rural Development Officials was initiated with the participation of tens of thousands of Rural Development Officials in Saigon and other provinces and villages.\n\nIn early 1968, during the Tet Offensive event, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao helped many victims of war in Saigon. This touched the hearts of many people.\n\nIn 1968, the Chief Instruction Commission was established in 30 Tran Hoang Quan Street, Saigon, together with the formation of Viet Vo Dao Association and Viet Vo Dao Youth Association. The Grand Master also appointed Master Tran Huy Phong as head of Viet Vo Dao Youth Association.\n\nAfter that, many masters and instructors were sent to many provinces to promote Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao: Trinh Ngoc Minh (Nha Trang), Tran Tan Vu (Phu Yen), Ngo Kim Tuyen (Binh Duong), Nguyen Van Chieu (Quy Nhon), Nguyen Van Nhan and Nguyen Van Sen (Can Tho), Tran Van My (Hau Giang), Duong Minh Nhon (Kien Giang), Nguyen Ton Khoa (An Giang), Nguyen Van Vang (Vinh Long), Nguyen Van ?t (Ut) (My Tho)…\n\nSoon later, the Eastern Instruction Commission was established in the province of Long Khanh under Master Tran Duc Hop and Central Instruction Commission was established in the province of Khanh Hoa under Master Trinh Ngoc Minh. In 1969, the Western Instruction Commission was established in the province of Long Xuyen (then moved to Can Tho) under Master Nguyen Van Nhan. In 1970, the Northwestern Instruction Commission was established in the province of Binh Duonng under Master Ngo Kim Tuyen.\n\nEvery year, on the occasion of the Commemorating Day of the late Founder, many Masters everywhere returned to Saigon to attend the Commemorating Ceremony as well as attended the special training sessions and promotion examinations. This created a good tradition within Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao. The Grand Master and many high-level masters frequently visited many provinces, cities, and towns to support and examine the progress of Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao nationwide. Beside martial arts training and character building, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao also encouraged its disciples to participate in many community and social services.\n\nIn early 1970, Master Tran Huy Phong established the Community Village of Viet Vo Dao in Tan Tao village, Binh Chanh district, Gia Dinh province with 3 kilometer square area. The project created more than 1000 residence unit to be sold to the disciples and friends. Besides, he and some friends formed the Viet Vo Dao Agricultural Plant to harvest the agricultural produce for the village. After April 30, 1975, the Vietnamese Communist regime tich thu (took over illegally) this property and changed it into the New Economic Zone of Duong Minh Xuan.\n\nIn late 1970, Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao and many cultural, religious, and political organizations as well as many celebrities to found the Steering Committee for the Establishing of King Hung’s Altar, and finally the altar was placed in the Hoa Lu Center. Every year, the National Founder’s Ceremony, attended by the President, legislators, government officials as well as many organizations and citizens lasted for many days.\n\nIn 1973, the Vovinamization of National Officials was initiated with many training sessions in Chi Linh Center, Vung Tau.\n\nIn 1974, a group of Vietnamese masters in France requested permission to join Vovinam because they liked the ideals of Vovinam. As a result, the Grand Master and the Council of Vovinam approved their request and entrusted them to form Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Federation of France. The first Executive Committee included Prof. Phan Hoang (President), Pham Xuan Tong, Nguyen Dan, Phu, Hoang Nam, Nguyen Trung Hoa, Bui Van Thinh, Tran Phuoc Tastayre. The Vovinam-Viet Vo Dao Federation of France was also responsible for promoting Vovinam in Europe.\n\nVovinam-Viet Vo Dao also followed many exchange students such as Tran Nguyen Dao, Nguyen Thi Hue, Tran Dai Chieu, Duong Quan Viet, Ha Chi Thanh… to France, Italy, Germany, Switzerland…\n\nIn July 1974, the Grand Master appointed Master Tran Huy Phong as head of the Chief Instruction Commission and Master Nguyen Van Thong as the new head of the Viet Vo Dao Youth Association.\n\nMany Vovinam disciples in the period of 1938-1940 often told of the tale of the “invincible spirit” of Founder Nguyen Loc. In the first demonstration, there was a high ranking French official, Colonel Maurice Ducoroy, attending. Because Col. Maurice Ducoroy, who represented the French colonial rule, was sitting in the audience, Founder Nguyen Loc did not let his disciples to bow to the audience. Instead he took his disciples to the backstage to bow to the ancestor’s altar. During the demonstration, Dr. Dang Vu Hy invited Founder Nguyen Loc to Durocoy’s seat so Ducoroy could award him a medal. Knowing that he could not refuse, Founder Nguyen Loc had to accept. But when he returned to the stage, he calmly put the medal into his pocket. His conduct had touched the patriotic feelings of the audience, especially his disciples.\n\nSince then, Vovinam always led the demonstrations against the French and its rule, including the demonstration in the University of Hanoi and the Ministry of Agriculture. Consequently, French closed all the Vovinam classes and prohibited Founder from teaching Vovinam. This was a challenging period for Vovinam during its early time. However, Founder still secretly taught many loyal disciples at home, and continued to lead many public demonstrations.\n\nSoon later, Vovinam cooperated with many patriotism organization to host many events commemorating King Hung (first King of Vietnam), Two Queens Trung as well as many charitable events… At the same time, many self-defense classes had opened and recruited tens of thousands of disciples. The enthusiasm for Vovinam in the public was indicated by the slogans: “Vietnamese practice Vietnamese martial arts“, “Not a Vovinam disciple, not a Vietnamese patriot“…\n\nAt this time, since the independence war was necessary, many Vovinam techniques was very simple but practical. The training focuses on the endurance, speed, and strength. Most of the training sessions lasted about 3 months. In April 1945, many Vovinam instructors were sent to remote places to promote Vovinam.\n\nAfter winning World War II, France returned to Vietnam in 1946 to reclaim its former colony. On December 19, 1946, the war against France broke out in North Vietnam. Founder Nguyen Loc led his disciples to join the war. Some disciples become famous and courageous commanders while some have fallen for the freedom of Vietnam. When Viet Minh (the predecessor of the Vietnamese Communist Party) began to consolidate their power by recruiting non-communist Vietnamese and murdering those who refuse, Founder Nguyen Loc immediately halted all his involvements with Viet Minh and urged his disciples to leave the Viet Minh. Knowing that, Viet Minh ordered the capture of Founder Nguyen Loc with the purpose to force Vovinam disciples to join the Viet Minh. Upon the dangerous situation: being wanted by both the Viet Minh and the French, Founder Nguyen Loc told his disciples to return to their hometowns to wait for an opportunity. He then took the remaining disciples back to his hometown, Huu Bang village. In his hometown, he helped organize the young men into militias as well as train the new militias in combative techniques. He also assigned instructors to the Military Academy of Tran Quoc Tuan. After his responsibilities were fulfilled, he then continued his journey and train the Militia Officers of villages of Che Luu, Am Thuong, Thanh Huong, Dan Ha, Dan Phu along the way… In March 1948, He came to The Catholic District of Phat Diem and assigned instructors to train Jesuit Militias under Chief Commander Tran Thien.\n\nIn August 1948, He returned to Hanoi and opened many Vovinam classes for the young men and women. In 1951, He worked with many dignitaries to found the Vietnamese Martial Artist Federation which offers many martial art classes for the public in the schoolyard of Hang Than, Hanoi."
