        "text": "This special issue of Asian Studies is dedicated to Confucianism in Vietnam, a topic that is anything but well known in Western academia. While in recent decades, the subject has been increasingly often investigated by researchers from China and Taiwan, and has also obtained some attention in other East Asian areas, there exist––with few exceptions––almost no works on Vietnamese Confucianism in Western languages. Even though Confucianism in general has become a very important research topic, its manifold Vietnamese variations and its impact on past and present Vietnamese culture are still widely unknown.\n\nABSTRACT: This research, in the first half, provides an outline of Confucian cultural practices as evidence of the promotion of Confucianism and national tradition in South Vietnam in 1955-1975, in the context of East Asian Confucianism from the 1950s to 1970s. The second half focuses on Nguyễn Đăng Thục, a leading scholar in South Vietnam, in order to investigate the motivation for his promotion of Confucianism as a national tradition of Vietnam. Influenced by the decolonization movement in Asian countries after World War II, and particularly by the 1947 Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi, Nguyễn Đăng Thục arguably assumed nationalistic and decolonizing approaches to his examination of Vietnamese culture and the traditional cultures of Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Asia as a whole. By analyzing his Confucian activities and research, this paper also argues that, to a certain extent, Nguyễn Đăng Thục should be labeled a “New Confucian” scholar of Vietnam. KEYWORDS : Confucianism, New Confucianism, tradition, South Vietnam, decolonization, nationalism\n\nThe Vietnam Association of Traditional Studies (VATS) took the initiative in promoting Confucian cultural practices in South Vietnam from 1955-1975. The association strove towards collecting, researching, translating, interpreting, and circulating classical Sino-graphic documents in order to preserve traditional East Asian culture in relation to up-to-date moral education and practical science. Unfortunately, there is a lack of research material related to the organization during the period after the two halves of Vietnam were reunited in 1975. Thus, the Association's activities after 1975 cannot be discussed. To bridge the gap, this article is based on rare documents mostly collected by the author, describing the history and activities of this Confucian organization, including its establishment (1954), regulations, organizational structure, and membership. This article will also focus on the VATS's Confucian cultural practices, such as (i) publishing as a way to promote Confucianism and traditional morality, (ii) Confucianism and Literary Sinitic education, (iii) public speeches, (iv) organizing the annual commemoration of Confucius' birthday on September 28th, (v) and promoting international cooperation related to Confucianism. These activities demonstrate the organization's attempt at popularizing Confucianism and making it compatible with ideas and practices introduced by modernization and Westernization in the middle of the twentieth century. Keywords: Confucianism, Vietnam Association of Traditional Studies (VATS), South Vietnam (SVN), tradition, cultural practice\n\nSouthern Vietnam was reclaimed by the Vietnamese in the mid-seventeenth century. They first brought their folk Buddhism and various popular religions to new land; however, the bureaucratic system then forced the Chinese Han – Song Dynasties’ institutionalized and politicalized Confucianism on the population. The arrival of the Chinese from overseas since the late seventeenth century marked the introduction of Qing Confucianism into Southern Vietnam, shaping the pro-Yangming studies among local literati. Many writers claim that Qing Confucianism had no impact on Vietnam. Obviously, however, these writers ignored the diversity of Vietnamese Confucianism in the new frontiers in the South. Qing Confucianism was truly absorbed into many aspects of life among the local gentry, popularizing the so-called pro-Yangming studies. The article aims to study the transmission, contestation, transformation, and manipulation of Qing Confucianism in Southern Vietnam by penetrating deeper into the life, career, mentality, merits, and influence of local Confucianists and reviving the legacies of practical learning in local scholarship. The research discovers that the practical learning of Qing Confucianism dominated the way of thinking and acting of local elites, affecting ideological, educational, cultural and socio-economic domains of local society. However, the domination of the classical Confucian orthodoxy and the lack of state-sponsored institutionalization in late feudal periods, as well as the later overwhelming imposition of Western civilization under French colonial rule, seriously challenged and downgraded the impacts of Qing Confucianism in Vietnam. Therefore, Yangming studies were once transmitted but had limited impact on Vietnam.\n\nConfucianism was born twenty-five centuries and has lasted for so long over a wide area including China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam. That is one thing that needs to explain why. Explaining this would certainly be difficult to convince if the mere theory of its richness and depth. It must have the conditions to be born and exist in the socioeconomic base of East Asia, first of all in China, where it was born. The conditions for its birth only exist in China, but the conditions for its long-term survival are in all three countries of Korea, Japan and Vietnam and must be similar to those in China, at least about culture generally. In the history of Vietnam, since independence, the feudal dynasties of Vietnam have begun to use Confucianism was an effective way to govern and manage society. It is not surprising that the laws enacted by the feudal dynasties of Vietnam all have Confucianism imprints. Those were ancient laws code; the most typical was built and issued in Vietnamese history (from the 11th century to the 19th century). Based on the study of ancient bibliographies, in consultation with researchers and colleagues, this study provides insights and assessments of the Confucian imprints in the Hoang Viet Luat Le (called the Gia Long law) of Nguyen Dynasties of Vietnam; It also raises some controversial issues about the position and role of Confucianism in the history of Nguyen Dynasty Vietnam so that colleagues and researchers continue to study and debate."
