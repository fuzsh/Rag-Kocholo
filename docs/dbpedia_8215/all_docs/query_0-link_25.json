        "text": "I understand and live in the diaspora differently than my parents. But, through my parents’ repeated retellings of their stories, with the same tones, rhythms, inflections, and unreconcilable non-endings, I realized that beyond being a ubiquitous source for survival, water, or nước, was also personally symbolic for my parents.\n\nYến Lê Espiritu references the song, “Biển Nhớ” (“The Sea Remembers”) in chapter three of her book, Body Counts, noting that the “allusion to water in the song title is significant because in the Vietnamese language, ‘the word for water and the word for a nation, a country, and a homeland are one and the same: nước’” (65, original emphasis). Like the choruses of several songs being repeated, stories that I’ve repeatedly listened to included how my father and unknown, distant relatives fought in the air, in the vastness of the sea, and on land to serve and to protect the country’s shores. Like motions of waves, a moving song that at times reminds me of my father is “Biển Mặn” (“Salty Sea,” composed by Trần Thiện Thanh; stage name: Nhật Trường, 1942-2005):\n\n“Trong bao lần quân hành, tôi qua vùng khô cặn\n\nMồ hôi thành biển mặn trên môi.”\n\n//\n\n“Marching in the dry regions\n\nThe sweat tastes like the salty sea on my lips.”\n\nPerhaps I’m romanticizing those memories that don’t belong to me.\n\nThe back of the Polaroid was documented, with my father’s familiar, unique calligraphic handwriting: Subic Bay – May 15, 1975. Recently, my mother’s eyes misted over the memories as the picture shows a haunting image of a fractured family of – then – three, temporarily residing at the refugee camps in the Philippines, where they became exilic boat people, another unintended yet inevitable allusion to the wavering imageries of nước.\n\nOn that boat, dead, decomposing bodies were thrown off for the living to survive.\n\nMy parents have always inhabited the obscurity of the water’s waves, even after they left them behind on shores of fading memories, with some disappearing and one remaining.\n\nSometimes only the objects washed back ashore maintain those past memories, dried up.\n\nAuthor Bio"
