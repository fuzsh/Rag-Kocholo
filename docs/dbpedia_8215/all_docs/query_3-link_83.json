        "text": "The ceremony of placing the first stone for building the Main Buddhist Hall for Quang Duc Monastery. It was on the full moon day of November, in the Year of Dragon. Venerable Thich Nhat Tan, Director of Finance Department of GHPGVNHN Australia & New Zealand, Abbot of Phap Quang Temple, gave presentation at 10:30am.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted in solemn to pray peace to beings.\n\n- From Sangha, there were the presence of Most Venerable Thich Tam Chau, the World Sanghai Prime VIP (Canada), Most Venerable Thich Huyen Ton, Member HDCM, GHPGVNTNHN Australia & New Zealand, Most Venerable Thich Nhu Hue, Chairman of Australia & New Zealand Congregation, Most Venerable Ajahn Viriya Nanda, (Thailand); Senior Venerable Santhindrya (Sri Lanka), Most Venerable Thich Bao Lac, Senior Venerable TT. Thich Tinh Minh, Senior Venerable Thich Quang Ba, Senior Venerable Thich Minh Tri, Senior Venerable Thich Bon Dien, Senior Venerable Thich Nguyen Truc, Senior Venerable Thich Minh Hieu, Senior Venerable Thich Tinh Dao, Senior Venerable Thich Thien Tam, Venerable Thich Nhat Tan, Venerable Thich Vien Chon, Venerable Thich Quang Nghiem, Venerable Thich Quang Hoa, Venerable Thich Nhuan Kim, Bhikkuni Thich Nu Phuoc Tri, Bhikkuni Thich Nu Chon Dao, Bhikkuni Thich Nu Tam Lac, Bhikkuni Thich Nu Chan Kim ...\n\n- From government and guests, there were the presence of Mr. Philip Ruddock, Federal Attorney-General of Immigration, TNS Nguyen Sang, Ms. Kaye Darveniza, representing Premier Steve Brake, Mrs. Stella Kariofyllidis, Mayor of City of Moreland, Mike Zafiropoulos, Manager of SBS Radio in Melbourne, Dr. Lam Nhu Tang, Deputy Director Department of Education Culture GHPGVNTNHN- Australia & New Zealand; Mr.Trung Doan, Chairman of the Freedom Vietnamese Community in Australia, Mr. Quoc Viet, Head of the Vietnamese language, Mr. Long Quan, Editor of Human Rights Weekly Newspaper, Mr. and Mrs. Bill Chung, construction contractors, Nguyen Kien Thanh, architect who designed the building plan, Mr. and Mrs. David Nowak, engineers who were responsible for the construction of Quang Duc Monastery, SBS Radio Station in Melbourne, and nearly 1,000 community members in and out of Victoria.\n\nFollowing the Flag Ceremony was the Opening Speech giving by Venerable Thich Tam Phuong, the Abbot. He expressed his great desire, and the determination to build Quang Duc Monastery, the place could be used as a Buddhist cultural centre and the training school to the Vietnamese Buddhist community in Australia. One section in his speech wrote: \"... Although being’s life is impermanent and short, the responsibility of the Sangha is above to reach the Pure Land and Enlightenment, below to save and comfort beings. As the Buddhists, we all put the Three Gems to the most holy and the good deeds to the highest respect, in the absolute among the changes, for eternity. In that spirit, we call you, the fellow Buddhists, near and far, for your supports and contributions to the building project of the Great Kindness Stupa for its completion.”\n\nQuang Duc Monastery was together with Moreland Council for the Census program to have the most accuracy on the religious report of the Vietnamese in Australia. It gave the instructions to the Buddhists to help answer question 19 of the “Australian Bureau of Statistics Household Form”, that was, “what is the person's religion?\" the Buddhist just needs to put a “-” in the box in front of the “Buddhist” word. The reminder to the family who has the total count of members of more than 6 needed to contact the National Census (ABS) at 137 219 for additional forms to fill. It was a privilege of the Buddhists. Be aware, the population of the Buddhists in Australia was recorded about 200,000 (two hundred thousands) within the total of 600 million (six hundred million) of the whole world (all together). We believe that the “600 million” is not a correct number in real. Because the report from the world Bureau of Statistics was counting on the response of who reported of her/his religion. However, there had been many Buddhists did not participate actively in the census program. In order to bring the count closer of the actual number, we call the Buddhists in Australia to aggressively and correctly participate into the Census program. Please go to this link: http://www.abs.gov.au/for the details.\n\nQuang Duc Monastery hosted the reception called Roses Offerings to Mothers at Happy Reception Restaurant in Ascot Vale for the first time. Buddhist Long Quang Ho, the editor of Weekly Human Rights News Paper was the manager of the program. He delightfully extended the thanks to the fellow Buddhists and to the organizations those supported and participated in the party. Abbot Thich Tam Phuong gave speech about the meaning of Roses offering to Mothers: “Forever we could not hope to repay the love and the labour to the Mothers, because the Mothers’ Love to the children is not a loan but the Giving. The party tonight is for the children to honour the Mothers to express their gratitude.” The program included many new features operated in modern Arts and opera music by the contribution of Son Ca singer from the United States and the famous singers of Sydney and Melbourne such as Bao Khanh, Le Nghiem, Linh Do, Tuan Kiet especially with the presence of the opera actors and actresses Ngoc Lan, Diep Ngoc, Quang Chau, Minh Huong, Minh Ky, Nguyen Kha, and Tuan Anh Dung. There were 25 Mothers who were older than 70 years of age being honour.\n\nSince the start of 2000 to these days, every year early March, Mr Rob Wood of Toorak Social Work Centre, led a group of youth consisted of many different ethnics; Korea, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Fiji, Solomon, New Zealand and Australia, visited Quang Duc Monastery. The purpose of the visit is to give the group the opportunity to enquire about the philosophy of Buddhism. A 10 days course on Life Matters held at Armagh, Toorak, Melbourne, Australia, designed to help the individual to come to terms with oneself and how to deal with sudden change in life, to learn to forgive, as well as recognising the importance of how religion can help one to find a meaningful life. At the end of the course, Mr Rob Wood led the group visiting different religious, such as Buddhist temple, Roman Catholic Church and Muslim Mosque, to give the group an opportunity to be aware of the philosophical background between each religion. Quang Duc Monastery has been chosen by the Social Work Centre to represent Buddhism over the last 10 years.\n\nThe Monastery provided the service of Holy Relics exhibitions. There were approximately 2500 Buddhists (Cambodian, Sri Lankan, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Australian) and guests who came to pay respect. The program for each day was from 5 am to 10 pm. The time slots included the mindfulness practice, Sutra chanting, sitting and walking meditation and Dharma teachings (3 hrs each day). The Buddhists had enough merits to listen to 10 teachings given by Tibetan Lama Rinpoches, the Sri Lankan, the German, Australian, and Vietnamese Masters. The event brought in the warm and earnest atmosphere to add on to their confidence. Specifically, for two weeks of observing the relics of Buddha and Bodhisattva, the Buddhists, again, faithfully and diligently increase their efforts toward their goals. The Holy Relics exhibited at the Monastery were the certain results of the deliverance from who were reached the enlightenment.\n\nThe Monastery held a ceremony to pray peace for victims’ families of fire in Victoria. Following the ceremony, Abbot Senior Venerable Thich Tam Phuong, Director of Social and Charity Division of the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation of Australia – New Zealand, together with the Masters from other temples delivered $100,000 AUD (one hundred thousand Australian dollars) to Strathewen where the fire destroyed the most, 42 dead and 70 houses were down (of the total of 100 units were destroyed). The remained portion, approximately $ 40,000 AUD, was delivered to other regions where also got damage by the fire (the donations came from the Buddhist institutions of all five continents). The terrible fire occurred in early February 2009 in Victoria was the most severe in the history of the Australian. The disaster claimed 210 lives (including the missing, dead, and buried). The damages to properties, houses, and business were figured as high as in billion of AUD. Under these circumstances, the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation held prayers for victims. Senior Venerable Thich Tam Phuong said: ‘‘Immediately after the news of this terrible fire, Chief of the Congregation, Most Venerable Thich Nhu Hue sent 2,000 AUD directly to the fund and ordered the Social and Charity Division to begin to relief. In response to the request, we together with other Masters within the Congregation started three consecutive trips, one on Feb 10th, one on 11th, and one on the 12thdirectly came to the victims’ residences to deliver 18,000 AUD in cash to support. Also, we provided them the general supplies, food (instant noodles) and drinks which was worth approximately 21,000 AUD. The total value of the assistance of the first three trips was 39,000 AUD.”\n\nThe 2ndPilgrimage to China, for 20 days, led by Vice-Abbot Senior Venerable Thich Nguyen Tang. 36 members left on Sunday in the morning for the trip. An Hau Tony Thach, director of Triumph Tour, always went along to guide and help the Master for his need. The Buddhists had enough merit to visit the Holy Sites on the four famous mountains: Potalaka Mountain, O-Mei Shan, Chiu-Fa Shan, and Pancasirsha Mountain. Potalaka Mountain is 1000 meters above the sea level, the place where Guan Yin Bodhisattvaused to save victims in the South China Sea of Dinh Hai, Zhejiang Province. Chiu-Fa Shan, in Anhui Province, where Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva built his places for his Dharma teachings. Pancasirsha Mountain in Shanxi Province where people used to see the appearance of Manjusri Bodhisattva. O-Mei Shan, the pick is as high as 3,077 meters above the sea level, in Szechuan Province, where Samantabhadra Bodhisattvaappeared for his teachings and saving beings.\n\nThe Monastery held two weeks of exhibitions of Holy Relics and Jade Buddha. The ceremony of welcoming Jade Buddha, carved from the 3000 years old gem block, and opening the Sangha new building was held in solemn. Two weeks of worship was successfully achieved in happiness. The Buddhists came to revere before the Buddha with the full belief and earnest ever. There were Buddhists had never heard of Fawkner area, but when the Jade Buddha arrived in Quang Duc, they oriented their trips to worship Jade Buddha. It was a reward of blessedness of whom with enough merit. The Monsatery welcomed all guests regardless of religion or race. Abbot Senior Venerable Thich Tam Phuong had expressed his emotions in a poem to welcome Jade Buddha: Greatly! Greatly! Buddha is coming to Quang Duc, Buddha’s here to bring along wisdom and peace , Buddha’s here to bring in universe the happiness, Buddha’s here to shine the darkness, to promote the beliefs, Buddha’s here to save beings from suffering and sadness, Buddha’s here for ending hatred, for the wars to stop, Buddha’s here for Joyful-happiness Buds to bloom on Earth Buddha’s here for the Compassion Flowers to smile in peoples’ hearts.\n\nVice-Abbot Senior Venerable Thich Nguyen Tang along with 76 Quang Duc’ Buddhists attended the 9thYearly Retreat opened for 5 days, in Bringelly, of 35 miles from Bankstown, under the direction of the Congregation. Senior Venerable Thich Tam Minh took the lead of management. The seminar gathered 324 lay Buddhists, in those the members from Quang Duc’s Buddhists participated in the highest count and received the recognition from the committee. The main point was all Buddhists were in their effort to be on time always to the classes for straight five days. They practiced to get up early in the mornings, and to stay late in the evenings for meditation and chanting Suttra. They eagerly questioned in expecting the good answers for their seriously learning the Dharma. The most important point was that the Buddhists noticed the calmness within, Indeed, they have earned the merit. Not everyone could have chance to attend the retreats because they don’t have enough merit for the opportunity to happen. The practice helps people realize the true value of the spiritual life. In our hope, we want to see more members to participate in the coming Yearly Retreats.\n\nAbbot Senior Venerable Thich Tam Phuong, Senior Venerable Thich Quang Ba, Senior Venerable Thich Nhu Dinh came to Thailand to attend Vesak Days of Vesak 2634 held in Bangkok. Despite Thailand was bloody conflict between political factions for many days before the Vesak, but things were calmed down and stability returned in the Buddha's birthday week. This proves that there is the mystery of a holy person who was born to ease the beings’ hatred and to bring love and compassion to the world. This was the 7thBuddha's birthday, held by the United Nations from May 23rdto May 25th, 2010 with the participation of 1790 members from 70 countries worldwide. The number of participants was much higher than those in previous years that could show that the Buddhist disciples are to carry in their hearts the Buddha’s Teachings and to remember His Birthday always by together discussing and sharing the daily practices.
