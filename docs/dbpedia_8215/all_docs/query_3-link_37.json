        "text": "The Vietnamese Communist Party is at the root of the country’s growth and future goals, and is the single ruling body of Vietnam. In this article, you’ll learn about how the Communist Party of Vietnam has shaped Vietnam as a dân tộc, or “nation,” and gain more information about the Party’s leadership.\n\nAre you ready to delve into one of the core aspects of Vietnamese culture and society? At VietnamesePod101.com, we make learning simple and relevant. Let’s get started!\n\n1. What is Communist Party of Vietnam Founding Anniversary?\n\nOn the Communist Party of Vietnam Founding Anniversary, the Vietnamese people commemorate the creation and implementation of the Đảng Cộng sản, or “Communist Party,” of Vietnam. This Communist Party is the only ruling party, led by a General Secretary. Guided by chủ nghĩa Mác – Lê nin, or “Marxism-Leninism,” and Ho Chi Minh’s ideologies, the party is the leading body of the Vietnamese state and society.\n\nThe Communist Party of Vietnam has roots in Ho Chi Minh’s 1925 Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League, which has undergone many changes and experienced many factions and splits over the years. For example, in 1929, it split into two factions called the Communist Party of Indochina and the Communist Party of Annam.\n\nCurrently, Vietnam has a socialist-oriented market and is a socialist-republic country. The Communist Party works alongside the Fatherland Front to an extent, and Vietnam is also in the process of shifting to a more socialistic government and economy.\n\n2. When is CPV Foundation Day?\n\nEach year, Vietnam commemorates the Communist Party of Vietnam Founding Anniversary on February 3.\n\n3. Celebrations and Traditions for CPV Foundation Day\n\nWhile not a public holiday, many Vietnamese people observe the Communist Party of Vietnam Founding Anniversary. In particular, they celebrate the victories and advancements the country has experienced since the founding of the Communist Party of Vietnam. People also look ahead to the country’s future as it continues to shift toward socialism.\n\nThere are no overt celebrations or traditions on this day, though celebratory public gatherings are not uncommon. People may play the country’s national anthem, wave the Vietnam Flag, or give speeches. In 2019, for the 89th Founding Anniversary, there was an art program in Ho Chi Minh City in honor of this holiday and the Communist Party.\n\n4. More About the Vietnamese Government & Economy\n\nThough the country’s 2011 nominal GDP per capita ranked 141st out of 183 countries (IMF data), Vietnam is considered one of the twenty fastest-growing economies in the world and the most attractive FDI destination in Southeast Asia. Vietnam is forecasted by The Goldman Sachs Group to be the 35th largest economy in the world by 2025.\n\nVietnam is a socialist republic country based on a one-party system. Its guiding principle is that the State of Vietnam is the State of Vietnamese people, by the people and for the people, led by the Communist Party of Vietnam through the executive power of the National Assembly.\n\nThe National Assembly is the highest representative body of Vietnamese people and the highest state organ. Governed on a basis of democratic centralism, the National Assembly holds legislative power and is responsible for supervising and making decisions regarding internal and external affairs, carrying out socio-economic, military, and security duties (involving the People’s Army of Vietnam), and upholding the fundamental principles of the State’s mechanism and the social activities of the Vietnamese people. The President of Vietnam is the head of state, elected by the National Assembly for a five-year term.\n\nThe government of Vietnam is the executive arm of the National Assembly and the highest administrative organ of Vietnam. It is headed by the Prime Minister, who is elected by the National Assembly at the request of the President. There is no regulation on the limit of the Prime Minister’s tenure.\n\nThe Supreme People’s Court of Vietnam is the highest court of appeal. This judicial system is independent of the executive.\n\n5. Must-Know Vocabulary for CPV Foundation Day\n\nReady to review some of the Vietnamese vocabulary words from this article?

Even the days leading up to this holiday are full of Tet Holiday traditions, and many people use this time of Tet celebrations to relax and reflect upon the coming year.\n\nBy learning about the Asian holiday Tet, you’re allowing yourself to discover so much about the country of Vietnam which will both help you learn the language and give you a greater appreciation for it.\n\nIn this article, we’ll be going over Tet Holiday traditions, answering the question “What is Tet?” and even go over Tet Holiday vocabulary so you can learn the language in context.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n1. What is Tet Holiday?\n\nTet Holiday, or Tết m lịch in Vietnamese, is Vietnam’s celebration of the lunar new year. It’s one of the most important holidays that the Vietnamese observe, complete with lavish festivities, fireworks, and good food.\n\nTet Holiday celebrations are similar to other Asian New Year celebrations, but also reflect the individual values, history, and culture of Vietnam. From eating bánh chưng or “chung cake,” to visiting the chùa or “Buddhist temple,” you’ll soon see the significance of the Tet Holiday in Vietnam to its people and what makes it distinct from similar celebrations.\n\n2. When is Vietnamese New Year?\n\nThe Tet Holiday is the Vietnamese celebration of the New Year. On the “lunar calendar,” or m lịch, it takes place from December 28 to January 3. This usually falls somewhere around late January or early February on the solar calendar.\n\nIf it happens to fall before or after a weekend, the total number of days off for this holiday may be from seven to ten, giving a long, relaxing break to everyone in Vietnam.\n\nFor your convenience, here’s a list of this holiday’s date on the Gregorian calendar for the next ten years:\n\n2019: February 5\n\n2020: January 25\n\n2021: February 12\n\n2022: February 1\n\n2023: January 22\n\n2024: February 10\n\n2025: January 29\n\n2026: February 17\n\n2027: February 6\n\n2028: January 26\n\n3. How is it Celebrated?\n\n1- Days Leading up to Tet Holiday\n\nOn the days leading up toTet, families all over Vietnam are busy with shopping and preparing for the occasion. They often organize and remodel their houses so that they’re neat and warm. They also decorate their living rooms with flowers such as apricot, cherry, or cranberry blossoms. In Vietnamese, “apricot blossoms” are called hoa mai, and “cherry blossoms” are called hoa đào.\n\nLunar New Year’s Eve is also a popular time for family reunions. Families often prepare two trays of food to worship their ancestors and the Earth gods at the stroke of midnight. This kind of tradition is referred to as cúng Giao thừa.\n\nRight at the turn of the new year, “fireworks” or pháo hoa, are set off from city centers, and people all over the city rush to the top of high buildings to watch them. Those who live far from the center often go and reserve spots to watch the event several hours before the fireworks begin, or may simply just watch fireworks live on TV.\n\nAfter the fireworks end, many people pick young leaves at “temples,” or in Vietnamese chùa, as they believe these leaves bring good luck to their houses. This custom is called “picking buds for luck,” or hái lộc.\n\n2- Tet Holiday Traditions\n\nOn day one of the Tet Holiday, Vietnamese people have a custom of wishing everyone a Happy New Year. Young people will wish happy new year to their grandparents and parents, and adults often give money to children, wrapped in red envelopes. On the envelopes, you can find text saying, Hay ăn, chóng lớn, vâng lời cha mẹ, which literally means, “Eat well, grow fast, and obey parents.”\n\nOn New Year’s day, people greet each other by saying Chúc mừng năm mới!, meaning “Happy New Year,” or Chúc vạn sự như ý!, meaning, “Wish you everything to your liking.”\n\nMany Vietnamese people also believe that the first person to step into their house (người xông nhà) on the first day of the Lunar New Year will be the one who brings either good luck or bad luck for the year.\n\n4. Additional Information\n\nAmong the many New Year dishes, sticky rice cakes and steamed Gac rice are two dishes specially served on Tet Holiday. Also, boiled chicken, lean pork paste, and fried rolls are presented on special trays for the occasion.\n\n5.

How to Celebrate New Year in Vietnam\n\nNew Year’s Day, or Tết dương lịch, takes place on January 1st, and is one of the most important festivals in many nations around the world. In the past, celebrations surrounding New Year’s Day were usually adjusted to suit the Vietnamese lifestyle, but the day eventually became a standard official holiday recognized by the State of Vietnam.\n\nNow, before we get into more detail, do you know the answer to this question?\n\nWhat is the other name of New Year’s Day in Vietnamese?\n\nIf you don’t already know, you’ll find out a bit later. Keep reading.\n\nNew Year’s Day is not widely regarded as a traditional holiday in Vietnam, so there are no customary dishes associated with it. Instead, Vietnamese people often simply come together for meals at family reunions or with friends. The phrase for “Family reunion” in Vietnamese is sum họp gia đình. From the afternoon of December 31, many trade centers and streets become much more crowded than usual. Young people often gather together for meals, leisure activities, movies, and so on, and then wait for the turn of the new year.\n\nAt the moment the year turns over, Vietnamese people join the countdown from 10 to 0, shouting joyfully and greeting the New Year. In recent years, a brand of beer that is popular in Vietnam, Heineken, has regularly sponsored and organized the Countdown Party, or Lễ đếm ngược, in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Using an extravagant sound and lighting system, the party has quickly become very successful. At this event, many famous singers and DJs are invited to perform and create a lively atmosphere.\n\nWhen the clock strikes midnight, fireworks are let off and people shout “Happy New Year,” or in Vietnamese Chúc mừng năm mới. However, as fireworks can cause damage if used improperly, the locations and quantity of fireworks allowed to be set off each year are decided by the government. Major cities like Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang are often popular places for fireworks, but the quantity of fireworks set off is typically less than that of the Lunar New Year’s Day, or Tết Âm lịch.\n\nNow it’s time to answer our quiz question!\n\nDo you know any other names for New Year’s Day in Vietnamese?\n\nNew Year’s Day is also known as Western New Year’s Day or in Vietnamese “Tết Tây” which literally means Western Tet. It’s because this holiday was rooted in the French Colonial period when the Western calendar first began to be adopted and used in Vietnam.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nChúc mừng năm mới!\n\n2.

When do you celebrate New Year?\n\n2- Midnight\n\nnửa đêm\n\nThe point in time when a day ends and a new one starts. Many New Year celebrants prefer to stay awake till midnight, and greet the new annum as it breaks with fanfare and fireworks!\n\n3- New Year’s Day\n\nnăm mới\n\nIn most countries, the new year is celebrated for one whole day.

They are popular for announcing the start of the new year with loud noises and colorful displays! In some countries, fireworks are set off to scare away evil spirits. In others, the use of fireworks is forbidden in urban areas due to their harmful effect on pets. Most animals’ hearing is much more sensitive than humans’, so this noisy display can be very frightful and traumatising to them.\n\n8- Countdown\n\nđếm ngược\n\nThis countdown refers to New Year celebrants counting the seconds, usually backward, till midnight, when New Year starts – a great group activity that doesn’t scare animals, and involves a lot of joyful shouting when the clock strikes midnight!\n\n9- New Year’s Holiday\n\nkỳ nghỉ lễ Năm mới\n\nIn many countries, New Year’s Day is a public holiday – to recuperate from the party the previous night, perhaps!

You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, a parent.” This is very true! Relationships are often what gives life meaning, so this is a worthy resolution for any year.\n\n3- Lose weight\n\nGiảm cân.\n\nHands up, how many of you made this new year’s resolution last year too…?! This is a notoriously difficult goal to keep, as it takes a lot of self discipline not to eat unhealthily.

Alcohol is a poison and harmful for the body in large quantities!\n\n8- Exercise regularly\n\nTập thể dục thường xuyên.\n\nThis resolution goes hand-in-hand with ‘Lose weight’!
