        "text": "Novodevichy Cemetery (Russian: Новоде́вичье кла́дбище, Novodevichye kladbishche) is the most famous cemetery in Moscow. It lies next to the southern wall of the 16th-century Novodevichy Convent, which is the city's third most popular tourist site. It should not be confused with the Novodevichy Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.\n\nHistory\n\nThe cemetery was designed by Ivan Mashkov and inaugurated in 1898. Its importance dates from the 1930s, when the necropoleis of the medieval Muscovite monasteries (Simonov, Danilov, Donskoy) were scheduled for demolition. Only the Donskoy survived the Joseph Stalin era relatively intact. The remains of many famous Russians buried in other abbeys, such as Nikolai Gogol and Sergey Aksakov, were disintered and reburied at the Novodevichy.\n\nA 19th-century necropolis within the walls of the Novodevichy convent, which contained the graves of about 2000 Russian noblemen and university professors, also underwent reconstruction. The vast majority of graves were destroyed. It was at that time that the remains of Anton Chekhov were moved outside the monastery walls. His grave served as the kernel of the so-called \"cherry orchard\" - a section of the cemetery which contains the graves of Constantin Stanislavski and the leading actors of his company.\n\nInterments\n\nUnder Soviet rule, burial in the Novodevichy Cemetery was second in prestige only to burial in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Among the Soviet leaders, only Nikita Khrushchevwas buried at the Novodevichy rather than at the Red Square. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Kremlin Wall is no longer used for burials and the Novodevichy Cemetery is used for only the most symbolically significant burials. For example, in April 2007, within one week both the first President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and world renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich were buried there.\n\nToday, the cemetery holds the tombs of Russian authors, musicians, playwrights, and poets, as well as famous actors, political leaders, and scientists. More than 27,000 are buried at Novodevichy. There is scant space for more burials. A new national cemetery is under construction in Mytishchi north of Moscow.\n\nThe cemetery has a park-like ambiance, dotted with small chapels and large sculpted monuments. It is divided into the old (Divisions 1-4), new (Divisions 5-8) and newest (Divisions 9-11) sections; maps are available at the cemetery office.\n\nBurials at the Novodevichy Cemetery\n\nNotable burials: A-C\n\nSergey Afanasyev (1918–2001), first Soviet space industry minister\n\nIvan Agayants (1911–1968), a KGB officer and foreign spy\n\nSergei Aksakov (1791–1859), a writer\n\nBoris Alexandrovich Alexandrov, (1905–1994), leader of the Alexandrov Ensemble\n\nAbraham Alikhanov, (1904–1970), a physicist\n\nNadezhda Alliluyeva (1901–1932), wife of Joseph Stalin\n\nDaniil Andreev (1906–1959), a writer\n\nAverky Aristov (1903–1973), a politician and diplomat\n\nPavel Batov (1897–1985), an army general\n\nDemyan Bedny (1883–1945), a writer\n\nAndrei Bely (1880–1934), a writer\n\nPavel Belyayev (1925–1970), a cosmonaut\n\nGeorgi Beregovoi (1921–1995), a cosmonaut\n\nMark Bernes (1911–1969), an actor and singer\n\nVladimir Bonch-Bruevich (1873–1955), a writer\n\nSergei Bondarchuk (1920–1994), an actor and director\n\nArtyom Borovik (1960–2000), a journalist and businessman\n\nMikhail Botvinnik (1911–1995), a chess champion\n\nValeriy Brumel (1942–2003), an athlete champion\n\nValery Bryusov (1873–1924), a writer\n\nMikhail Bulgakov (1881–1940), a playwright and author\n\nNikolai Bulganin (1895–1975), A Marshal and statesman\n\nNikolai Burdenko (1876–1946), a neurosurgeon\n\nRolan Bykov (1929–1998), an actor\n\nFeodor Chaliapin (1873–1938), an opera singer\n\nAnton Chekhov (1860–1904), a writer\n\nVladimir Chelomei (1914–1984), a rocket engineer\n\nPavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov (1904–1990), a Nobel laureate in Physics\n\nIvan Chernyakhovsky (1906–1945), a General of the Army\n\nGeorgi Chicherin (1872–1936), a statesman\n\nNotable burials: D–G\n\nYakov Dashevsky (1902–1972), an army general\n\nKuzma Derevyanko (1904–1954), an army general\n\nAlexander Deyneka (1899–1969), a painter and sculptor\n\nLev Dovator (1903–1941), an army general\n\nIsaak Dunayevsky (1900–1955), a composer and conductor\n\nIlya Ehrenburg (1891–1967), a writer\n\nG.
