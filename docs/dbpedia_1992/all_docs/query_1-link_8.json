Thanks having a look at Rotatebot's log. RE rillke questions?\n\n+1. :-) Please have a look at User_talk:Rotatebot/Log#Log_checking. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nDear STefan, please read legal advice first. in http://www.riksbank.se/templates/Page.aspx?id=9094 (only in swedish) guidance is given regarding reproduction of swedish currency. Where did you get the concept that PARTS of swedish currency is copyrighted? --Janwikifoto (talk)\n\nEnligt den länken är svenska sedlar upphovsrättsskyddade precis som vilket annat verk som helst. Dessutom ges det en massa instruktioner om hur man kan undvika att åka fast för förfalskningsbrott. Vissa mynt, t.ex. ena sidan av 5-kronan, faller under {{PD-ineligible}}. I övrigt måste man vänta tills konstnären varit död i minst 70 år. Se svar på ena raderingssidan. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nJag förstår inte hur du tänker. Jag skickar mail, så ring mig, kanske jag förstår efter muntlig förklaring! --Janwikifoto (talk)\n\nuser Stefan4 does not reply, does not explain his thinking, and does not reply to email. So my vote is KEEP (I am not skilled in doing the delete/keep logos). It would be beneficial if Stefan4 actually contacts me and explain how he is reasoning. --Janwikifoto (talk)\n\nFrågan är besvarad på raderingssidan. Jag föredrar om diskussionen sker där. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nPlease contact me, to explain your thinking. You obviously understand swedish, and I snet you email, so it would be better to talk. You can also meet me in person in Stockholm. Vänligen kontakta mig, du förstår uppenbarligen svenska, och jag har skickat email, så det vore bättre att prata. Du kan även kontakta mig i person i Stockholm. Jag exister, är en verklig person. --Janwikifoto (talk)\n\nI added some informations thoso page. My English is not very well so I hope you see the point. :) --Reality006 (talk)\n\nPeut être que vous avez de raison. Salut! Ferbr1 (talk)\n\nHallo Stefan4, I am not sure about your rot. request at File:'_01_mummia_al_museo_egizio_di_torino.jpg - seems more likely to me that the camera was right... Also note that this is an upload after the 1.18 update and the photographer hasn't rotated his image by himself. Cheers --Saibo (Δ)\n\nI think you're right, so I have reverted the file to the original orientation. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nOkay, thanks. :-) --Saibo (Δ)\n\nDear Stefan,\n\nI have checked the original rotation of all my more than 3,000 uploads one by one (3-day full work!). Please do not interfere with my rotation requests.\n\nBest botanical regards, --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nI assume that you mean that I requested rotation for something for which you already had requested rotation for. User:Umherirrender made a useful page for searching for images needing rotation. User:Rillke later made a useful script for requesting rotation: there is a button to reset the rotation done by the MediaWiki software (which is usually correct for old images), but the script does not tell if rotation has already been requested by anyone else. On the other hand, this should not matter since the end result will be the same. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nDear Stefan, I have asked in the previous days a rotation for about 700 of my pictures, which has occurred in the meantime.\n\nDuring a very last check yesterday I asked for 5 additional rotations, of which 2 were also asked by you. Sorry that I thought that you were reversing my requests. Best regards, --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nDear Stefan: Sorry, I am having trouble understanding what I should do about the current rush of image rotations. I do understand that in some process of upgrading they have been rotated from their original orientation. Then I see some automatic bot is going through and resetting them. It would seem to me that it should be possible to reset them to their original position without me doing anything. Is this correct? When I check the various links in the notice on each file's page I cannot understand whether I should add notes or not. If so, it is going to be a big job and as I am not well and bedridden with a house full of guests for Christmas I really don't know how I am going to do this. Also, shouldn't I wait until the automatic reorientation actually takes place and then leave a note on each page if it was not successful? Would you please advise? Best wishes for the holiday season and through the new year. sincerely, John E. Hill (talk)\n\nSorry to bother you. I think I have figured out how to use the rotation request tool now and so I am going through and doing all the ones I have been contacted about. If there are any problems with what I am doing please don't hesitate to let me know. Sincerely, John E. Hill (talk)\n\nDear Mr. Hill, I am sorry for meddling but I hope you won't mind. Information about the auto-rotations are collected at COM:ROTATEFIX. We are working on a list to undo the damage created by the last MediaWiki-Update. So wait 2 or 3 weeks and then, all images should be fixed. Of course you can request rotation by yourself to speed this up for your photos. We are volunteers. If you want to talk to the software-developers responsible for the current situation or want to know more details, write to wikitech-l. Thank you. Regards -- RE rillke questions?\n\nDear Stefan,\n\nPlease revert the orientation of picture File:Ottelia alismoidesRHu1.JPG and File:Trapa natans01.jpg, which were originally correct, and are now misrotated by the automatic bot. Thank you, --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nThey weren't rotated by a bot, yet. See File:Trapa natans01.jpg#filehistory, please (no bot there). But the bot will reset the exif-orientation and then it will look like this. It this correct? -- RE rillke questions?\n\nThank you, Rillke, for your reply. The orientation of Media:Trapa natans01.jpg is indeed correct. That of Media:Ottelia alismoidesRHu1.JPG too. They should thus not been rotated. --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nThe links go to full resolution images. Do you mean that the full resolution images are correct when viewed in your web browser, or do you mean that the thumbnails at File:Ottelia alismoidesRHu1.JPG and File:Trapa natans01.jpg are correct? The {{Rotate}} template tells the bot to fix the image so that both the full resolution image and the thumbnails get the orientation of the full resolution image. Is this correct? --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nWhen I am clicking on the link \"Full resolution\" the rotation of the two full-resolution images is correct, but the thumbnails should be rotated by 90° and 270, respectively (clockwise, from portrait to landscape). --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nPS: I have requested a rotation by 90° and 270, respectively. All my about 3,500 uploads will be so correctly oriented. Please do not change anything further to them. --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nThat was exactly what my rotation templates said. The only thing you changed was that you moved the images back in the rotation queue, postponing their rotation by around two days. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThank you for your reply. I have no problem with the delay, as long as eventually the rotation occurs correctly. Best regards from Belgium (Bonjour de Belgique, Groetjes vanuit België, Grüße aus Belgien), --Réginald alias Meneerke bloem (To reply)\n\nPS: I still do not understand why these two pictures, which I have uploaded several months ago and the thumbnails of which were correctly oriented till last week, became suddenly misoriented a few days ago. Is there some instability of the system?\n\nNo. If you upload an image and the image is shown on a Wiki-page, even the file-description-page, thumbnails are generated and saved on the server. MediaWiki 1.17 did not rotate them according to the Exif-data. But MediaWiki 1.18 does. Your and many other files contained such Exif-orientation-data.\n\nSome weeks ago, the hard-drive-space on the computers that store the thumbnails was not enough. Therefore the server-administrators deleted the old thumbnails from MediaWiki 1.17 which caused that new thumbnails had to be generated. This time with Exif-rotation. So the wrong rotation was not done by a bot (Bots have accounts and you see them in the revision-history) but by a Software-change of MediaWiki.\n\nIf you understood now, please help us to improve COM:ROTATEFIX. Lots of users have the same questions like you had. Thank you. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nHello Stefan, it looks like something went wrong with the 'rotation' of File:Gloriosa.jpg. Can you please look into this? - Robotje (talk)\n\nI guess it was marked for rotation by mistake. With so many photos being marked as needing rotation, it comes as no surprise that some images might have been tagged incorrectly, but it is good that you noticed it. I have reverted the image to its original orientation. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nIt is easy to understand that if there are tens of thousands of rotation requests, there will be some false positives. Thank you for the action taken. As for the talkback-template, I think it was never really used in the Dutch Wikipedia (I didn't even know something like that existed). - Robotje (talk)\n\nHi Stefan, I'm afraid you rotated the wrong file: Villaggio leumann collegno 02.jpg looks quite odd now! Let mi know, please --Dimod61 (talk)\n\nStefan is not responsible for this appearance. It is a Software-change in MediaWiki (the server-software). Stafan added a template requesting Rotatebot to undo the change automagically done by MediaWiki. Read COM:ROTATEFIX and if you have still questions, you may ask here. Thank you. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nOK, and tanks anyway. Happy xmas !--Dimod61 (talk)\n\nHallo Stefan4, ich glaube File:Utricularia fulva 10.jpg gehört so wie sie war - das war wohl ein vergessener Fall ;-) Oder?

KMVavia and Alitalia - Linee Aeree Italiane are two airlines that were closed during last years, so can you explain me why they are not considered as a free content, i have seen some airlines tickets scans on commons and some of them are of exsiting airlines.

Mijn vader was dichter en schrijver, hij was goed bevriend met Jozef Cantre, die voor hem de cover maakte. De rechten op de cover van deze bundel zijn in overleg met mijn broers al jaren geleden door ons vrij gegeven, o.a. aan het Letterkundig Museum, die hem ook al eens opnam in en catalogus. (my picture of the cover of the poetrybook of my father, already given free of rights by the family, long ago)\n\nDe andere ingreep in en gedeeltelijke afbeelding van de Liturgiekrant verbaast me ook. Het daardoor gedeeltelijk in beeld gekomen artikel is van mij. Ik was 14 jaar hoofdredacteur van deze krant, en dient slechts, vanwege de kop als illustratie voor het gescheidensiverhaal van de vredesweekthema's. (my picture - partly! - of the paper, contains an article of the writer and that was me and a collegue, it is meant as an illustration of the themes of the so called paeceweek in the Netherlands).\n\nAlsjeblieft nergens aankomen dus, met rechten en zo moeten we ook geen spijkers op laag water zoeken! De Amerikaanse regering maakt het al moeilijk genoeg! (Please, don't create problems, when and where there are not!)\n\nEMelchior (talk) EMelchior\n\nI have read the USA copyright law and it says this:\n\nSection 302 (a) In General.— Copyright in a work created on or after January 1, 1978, subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the life of the author and 70 years after the author’s death. (b) Joint Works.— In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more authors who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a term consisting of the life of the last surviving author and 70 years after such last surviving author’s death. (c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.— In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first.\n\n303. Duration of copyright: Works created but not published or copyrighted before January 1, 1978 How Current is This? (a) Copyright in a work created before January 1, 1978, but not theretofore in the public domain or copyrighted, subsists from January 1, 1978, and endures for the term provided by section 302. In no case, however, shall the term of copyright in such a work expire before December 31, 2002; and, if the work is published on or before December 31, 2002, the term of copyright shall not expire before December 31, 2047.\n\nI don't see a copyright term of 95 years. Can you explain it to me? Thanks Cameta (talk)\n\nThose sections don't deal with works published before 1978. Anything published in 1978 or later would generally be copyrighted anyway since it is so recent. You should instead look here. It says that those works are subject to a 28 year copyright which can, if renewed, be extended by an additional 67 years, giving 95 years in total. Because of changes in the copyright law, works first published in 1964 or later are extended automatically. Foreign works are neither required to have copyright notices or to extend copyrights. US copyright rules are very complex, but all possible situations are explained here. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThanks, very much. Houston We have a BIG problem. Cameta (talk)\n\nHello!

That's the fact. I've got no time now to lose, so erase them right now, right now, ara mateix. It's quite clear what they are and if the Bank of Iceland really owns their copyright as somebody stated there (I think it was somebody else who marked them that way) may be they can stay. Otherwise I haven't the slightest intention to defend their presence in this site. I have stopped uploanding coins of anything that is not well dead centuries ago. Lose no time and erase them all. By the way, I've also stopped uploading anything in Luxembourg (where everything is copyrighted, it seems) but I have uploaded some pictures of Serra Perenxisa, where I used to live. As far as I know, Serra Perenxisa was made by plate tectonics sometime ago. I've been trying to contact God and Mother Nature in order to get their permission to upload the pics. No answer yet. Should I have to apply for their removal?\n\nToo tired but anyway gratefull for your comments,\n\n81.202.248.41\n\nOh, sorry! B25es (talk)\n\nThe reason is COM:ART#Photograph of an old coin found on the Internet. A coin is a 3D object, so the photographer owns the copyright to the photo. For that reason, you need to specify that you took the photos and that you agree to licence the photo under a free licence. Since you wrote that you took the photos yourself, I have added a statement to the file information pages stating that you took the photos. The licence problem could be solved by adding, for example, {{CC-BY-SA-3.0}} to all of the file information pages, if you agree on distributing the photos under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 licence.\n\nThere is also an unresolved question regarding recent Icelandic money. There are currently two statements on Commons, one saying that it is allowed and one saying that it isn't allowed, and there is currently a discussion at COM:VPC#Icelandic currency. The {{Icelandic currency}} template might not be valid.\n\nYour problems with Luxembourg might be related to freedom of panorama: in some countries, such as Luxembourg, you can't take a photo of a building unless the architect died at least 70 years ago. It's stupid, I know, but that is how the law is written. In other countries, such as Spain, it is legal to take a photo of any building. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nExcuse me and thanks a lot! B25es (talk)\n\nWould you mind taking a look at the updates at Commons:Village_pump#Nonfree logos? Andrea stated that there are some issues with editing the \"no local uploads\" template - Thanks WhisperToMe (talk) \\\n\nSee pls - \"I scanned this image\".\n\nTo say that in Italy there's not freedom of panorama is not technically exact. Actually the only law that protects the copyright is 70+ yrs old (1941) which says nothing about photos taken in public places (as opposite as Belgian and Dutch laws that set some limitations). It's supposed (and I underline supposed) that a copyrighted work (with artistic - cultural - etc. relevance, not a simple building with no artistic value), no matter where placed, can't be photographed safely if their author is still alive or has died less than 70 yrs ago. For the sake of the project I am pretending that Italy has no FoP and acting as such, but note that a member of the Government, expressely inquired about the point, said that (this is the official site of the Chamber (the bold are mine) \"In Italia, non essendo prevista una disciplina specifica, deve ritenersi lecito e quindi possibile fotografare liberamente tutte le opere visibili, dal nuovo edificio dell'Ara Pacis al Colosseo, per qualunque scopo anche commerciale salvo che, modificando o alterando il soggetto, non si arrivi ad offenderne il decoro ed i valori che esso esprime\" (translated: In Italy, not existing a specific law [about FoP] can be considered legal , thus allowed, freely photographing any exposed work, from the new Ara Pacis building (2000s) to the Colosseum, for any purpose, even commercial with the limitation of not alterating the subject the way it might be considered offensive towards the values that [the work] expresses).\n\nAlso note that there was never any official pronouncement about FoP by our Supreme Court, nor there were any cases in court about that. -- Blackcat (talk)\n\nP.S. Of course this doesn't apply to cultural and artistic works hosted in Museums, that are the subject of another law that forbids their photographic reproduction without authorisation.\n\nDon't you think deleting so many images would require a wider community input? --VartanM (talk)\n\nIf you are talking about deletion requests about buildings and/or statues in CIS countries, there is already a policy which says that they are not allowed unless the copyright has expired, see COM:FOP#Former Soviet Union and COM:FOP#Russia. The deletion requests are only about following existing policies. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nKanske är det onödigt att lägga in raderingsvarningar hos användare som bara har redigerat bilderna som andra har laddat upp?

Takabeg (talk)\n\nIt would be necessary to find out if it was a work for hire ({{PD-Japan-organization}}) or a normal work ({{PD-Japan}}).\n\nAsakura Fumio died in 1964. If it was a normal work, the copyright to the statue expires in Japan in 2015.\n\nAccording to this page, the statue was made in 1936, but then it was reconstructed in 1952. If the statue was a work for hire, the copyright expired 50 years after construction. It is not clear if the 1952 reconstruction added any copyrightable aspects to the statue, so it is not clear if the copyright would expire 50 years after 1936 or 50 years after 1952.\n\nThere is also the US copyright which expires 95 years after \"publication\". If the Japanese copyright expired in 1987 (50 years after 1936), the statue is presumably {{PD-1996}}. If the Japanese copyright expired in 2003 (50 years after 1952) or will expire in 2015 (50 years after 1964), the statue would be copyrighted in the United States under the URAA.\n\nI would guess that a statue in a public park often is a work for hire, so {{PD-Japan-organization}} doesn't seem unlikely. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThank you. It's similar case on this statue. en:Seibo Kitamura delivered this statue to the Nagassaki municipality in 1955 and died in 1987. But, the Agency of Culture says なお，著作者とは「著作物を創作する人」のことであるため，著作物の創作を他人や他社に委託（発注）した場合は，料金を支払ったかどうか等にかかわりなく，実際に著作物を創作した「受注者側」が著作者となります。 (English). As long as I udnerstand, the legal status depends on contracts. むずかしいです (´∩｀。)Takabeg (talk)\n\nThe Nagasaki statue additionally has the problem that it was copyrighted in Japan in 1996, so it is {{Not-PD-US-URAA}}. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nBonjour !

But, secondly, with it i am wishing you a lot of strength, because i doubt that the discussion that is almost over is the end of it; keep in mind that the whole thing has began when i have voted Keep on a deletion request that some admin wanted to end in the delete consensus; and since you have voiced your opinion against this group of people, they won't really let it go (to quote admin Geni \"this isn't over\").

Please consider contributing to developing the project. Rd232 (talk)\n\nHello Stefan, I saw that you can stop a picture-deletion-process (you removed the deletion tag already to one of my pictures), so please, remove the deletion date from those pictures: File:UrnEst_(imaste)_Corinne_Whitaker.jpg File:Metastasis_Corinne_Whitaker.jpg File:Ogre_Corinne_Whitaker.jpg File:CaughtFlatfooted_Corinne_Whitaker.jpg You can read here: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump/Copyright#License_problem_.3F the reason (you answered me there too). Please, I appreciate it. Guy.e (talk)\n\nWhy are you questioning my permission grant of File:Vital article candidates for attention.png? You can see that I have uploaded all three versions, refining them each time. How would an email be any more authentic evidence of permission? Npmay (talk)\n\nSorry, my fault not checking enough. I noticed the URL stats.grok.se and tagged too fast. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Administrators%27_noticeboard/User_problems&diff=68326145&oldid=68326097 – I hope that you don't mind. --Michaeldsuarez (talk)\n\nI am not completely sure but reading Category:Mozilla Firefox logos / https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=541761 and http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/licensing.html (linked from http://europe.mozilla.org/sv/pressroom/images/) it seems to me at least one license that is permitted on Commons. What do you think? Regards -- RE rillke questions?\n\nI might have misunderstood something. I have always heard of various copyright limitations concerning the use of Mozilla logos, but the links you provided suggests that all logos since Firefox 3.5 would be fine. It seems that Iceweasel only uses a different name and logo because of trademark issues – I thought that there were also copyrights involved. English Wikipedia has a Thunderbird logo which is claimed to be unfree, but the Firefox article contains a Firefox logo which is claimed to be free. This situation is a bit confusing. There's the issue that it says that licensing policy changed with Firefox 3.5 and I suppose I simply never heard of the changes until today. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nFine. Trademark ruling prohibits altering the logo and limits usage but this is a non-copyright restriction. I personally don't know how to behave here. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nTrademark restrictions are usually not an issue here, but if you are not allowed to alter the logo, it sounds like a variant of a CC-ND licence, which is not free enough. Maybe it would be better to ask at COM:VPC or put them all in a deletion request for discussion. I am certainly not sure what to do here.\n\nI think that some of the logos which I tagged as {{Copyvio}} were deleted yesterday. Were they later restored? If not, it might be a good idea to try to locate them in the deletion log in case they should be restored. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nYes, I think COM:VPC would be a good place. Concerning the deleted ones, one just have to scan through your deleted contribs which is easy because you're using edit summaries. -- RE rillke questions?\n\nThe image is, as clearly stated, a screenshot of a GPL'd program. As such, usage is free. Again, this is clearly stated in the description. Please remove your tag and deletion threat. Throwaway85 (talk)\n\nIt had no licence template, so the minor footnote about GPL wasn't easily noticed. All files should have a licence template. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nFor those of us who don't live on commons or know its rules, but who nonetheless like to fix the occasional wiki article we run across, the requirement to include a template of which we have no knowledge or face deletion of a file we spent no mean amount of effort uploading while attempting to comply with the rules, seems a bit silly. Throwaway85 (talk)\n\nI had the copyright holder email the license template as required to the email address specified several days ago. The tag re: license info missing on \"File:MythBusters Stars Adam Savage and Kari Byron at Dublin High School Engineering Academy Open House.jpg\" can be removed.

I've added {{subst:OP}} to this file now. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nIn response to [1]: What do you think could be done? There is simply no way to interact with the WMF.

Unfortunately, the list also contains a lot of images of free houses. For example, the list begins with File:Korea-Building in Gyeongbokgung palace Seoul-2005.jpg which is ancient (Chosŏn Dynasty) and the fourth one, File:Building in North Korea.jpg, isn't in South Korea, so it is subject to different laws which allow photos of houses. Anyway, no time for more deletion requests for today. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nFunny, the evidence of your harassment is clear with this edit: [3] is it not a building in Korea? You took the time to change the category but not nominate it for deletion? It's clearly the focus of the picture. Your behaviour is extremely transparent.--Crossmr (talk)\n\nI was planning to create a mass nomination of Rotte Paekhwajŏm images because they look recent but couldn't find any year of construction. The company was founded in 1979 but I couldn't find out whether it was using existing buildings or building new ones. Mass nominations are easier to make if they are all in the same category and besides it makes it easier to look into the matter later. Train stations and sports venues are easier: they need a special design, so it can always be assumed that they were constructed right before the opening. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nHello. This message is being sent to inform you that there is currently a discussion at Commons:Administrators' noticeboard/Blocks and protections. This is in relation to an issue with which you may have been involved.\n\n--Crossmr (talk)\n\nDid you think about adminship?

(same user, didn't realize I was logged out) 71.255.169.193\n\nBonjour ! J'ai donné un avis sur Commons:Deletion requests/File:Vase-jobvilla.png, et j'ai apporté un commentaire à l'avis de Bildoj, mais comme c'est la première fois que je fais cela sur commons, merci de me dire si j'ai fait quelque chose de travers.\n\nEst-ce qu'il faut aussi lancer une procédure du même type pour File:Sphenopteris-olnensis.jpg et File:Aneurophyton-olnense.jpg ? ou y a-t-il une autre procédure ? Ce sont probablement des scans d'une publi de François Stockmans qui a décrit ces fossiles. (Cf. Commons:Bistro#Photos sous ©), mais rien de disponible en ligne (la publi originale remonte à 1948). Et Breugelius a indiqué sur la description des photos qu'elles provenaient du département de géologie de l'Université de Liège. TED\n\nOn pourrait peut-être utiliser {{No permission since}} ou {{No source since}} parce qu'il est évident qu'il n'a pas créé ces image à l'Université de Liège parce qu'il n'a pas travaillé à l'université, mais j'ai créé Commons:Deletion requests/Files uploaded by Breugelius pour les images. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nBonjour Stefan,\n\nl'image en question Commons:Deletion requests/File:Vase-jobvilla.png semble avoir d'abord été publiée ici WAW_Curtius TAP Fr.pdf le 26 février 2009 et JPh Moutschen n'est pas cité dans ce fascicule... Copyvio donc !\n\nJe vérifie la semaine prochaine dans la publication de Stockmans ce qui en est pour les photos de fossiles.\n\nCordialement, Cymbella (talk)\n\nDésolée, l'image à laquelle je pensais n'est pas la même (le copyvio ne concerne là que la légende), mais Totodu74 a donné la bonne source de l'image et le copyvio est confirmé par le conservateur du Musée. - Cymbella (talk)\n\nHi. I have removed your copyvio tag on File:Groklaw screenshot.jpg, and have responded to the allegation on it's Talk page. -- Solbu (talk)\n\nHi, kindly assist in removing this photo as it is already deleted by its owner from the main source.--Preacher lad (talk)\n\nSorry, I forgot to comment this. Why do you want the photo removed? It says that the image has passed a Flickr review which is typically considered enough to keep the image even if the Flickr licence has changed or if the image has been deleted from Flickr. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThanks for your timely feedback! Truthskr (talk)\n\nHei Stefan4, since I've been threatened with blocking to answer you on COM:AN, I have to do it on your talk page. My answer has been removed, the discussion on AN has been closed by the admin who threatened before that blocking users for discussing things on AN, and nothing has been clarified by now. You didn’t understand me right, but I can’t clarify this on the page you asked me, and the conclusion there means, that the discussion has been for nothing, and nothing has been understood. I think that means that in future any user at any time can be checked. Perhaps I’m getting checked right now, who knows? It’s all very sad to see things happen here in this way. Kind regards --Geitost diskusjon\n\nPersonally, I'm not too concerned about the checkuser issue, maybe because I prefer cow cheese to goat cheese. Sure, there could be issues with requests to lookup yourself, for example if you have written about controversial topics such as the en:4th of June Incident or en:Falun Gong and you've had your account hacked by the Chinese government which is trying to locate you. It was a bit questionable, yes, but not a big issue in my opinion. Niabot asked to have his IP addresses checked and got what he asked for, so no issue. Saibo didn't ask to have his IP addresses checked but still got them checked, and that's maybe an issue, although not a big one I'd say. However, I think that it was quite a stupid accusation that they would be the same person. I rarely look at German Wikipedia, so I don't know anything about their contributions over there, but I think that there are some quite big differences between their contributions here on Commons. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nHello, Stefan2. You have new messages at Magog the Ogre's talk page.\n\n00:34, 22 April 2012 (UTC)\n\nHello Stefan, previously I posted some info to the helpdesk and you were kind enough to follow through..could I ask your assistance with another file that I think may be tagged with incorrect release?\n\nFile:Mercaz_HaRav_massacre.jpg was also uploaded on enWiki, but was delted for being incompatible see discussion en:Wikipedia:Possibly unfree files/2012 February 17#File:Mercaz HaRav massacre.jpg\n\nPhoto comes from this set at israelproject.org the release is \"royalty free\" but what does that mean? It's noted that the photo is originally from Government Press Office photographer (Avi Ohayon) and their terms are here (see also) The discussion mentions the restrictions placed on re-use and resolves that this is incompatible perhaps only good for fair-use on en ( commons is even more restricted, yes?). The uploader here, this is his single action & I don't think it is clear to me that he was the copyright holder and had authority to release into public domain. I would list this as a copyvio for deletion here myself, but the instructions confuse me & not sure it's possible w/out an account. Could you do the necessary & list for discussion/deletion? regards 94.195.187.69\n\nNow up for discussion at Commons:Deletion requests/File:Mercaz HaRav massacre.jpg. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThis is from Allack.

User:Jolsuarez —Preceding comment was added at 2012-05-09T00:56:01 (UTC)\n\nDear Stefan, I received a notification that you intend to delete the file I have uploaded. I kindly ask you not to do that and to please reconsider your decision. I have submitted the \"undelete request\" stating the reasons. It is the photo from my private collection and I uploaded it for public use. However, I would prefer that the higher resolution image appears in Wikipedia than the one which had been downloaded, at my request, initially. The reason is that the bio was reproduced in several publications by Wikipedia, and all photos, except the main one (the one which is resized) were reproduced, and regretfully, the main one, due to its tiny size, was not included in the publications. If in future this bio would be included in other publications, I would be delighted to have it included together with this principal photo, therefore I resized it and uploaded without lisense, for open use. Thank you for your understanding and hope for your kind cooperation in this matter.

I din't upload such an image like [5], where the main subject would be the copyrighted work.

Long answer: read COM:DW. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThanks for that reply. But I don't understand why wikipedia is full of photos of packaging. A search in commons for Coca-Cola shows dozens of packaging shots. Same for Mars, or any brand. What is different about my photo compared to these?\n\nthanks\n\n--User:Nextraterly —Preceding comment was added at 2012-05-21T08:02:36 (UTC)\n\nThere are several things to consider here:\n\nDesigns which are very simple are ineligible for copyright and are thus in the public domain. The words \"very simple\" are defined differently in different countries. In the United States, fonts are considered ineligible for copyright, so if American packaging only contains the name of the product in some font, uploading a photo of the packaging would be OK. Thus, painting a can red and writing the term \"Coca-Cola\" on the can wouldn't give you any copyright in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Austria and other countries, fonts have been ruled to be copyrightable, so photos of similar types of packaging might not be OK if the packaging comes from the United Kingdom or Austria. It seems that Mars was created in the United Kingdom but that it is now a product owned by an American company, so it is not entirely clear to me if the original country should be assumed to be the United Kingdom or the United States. I'd say that packaging such as File:Mars chocolate.jpg is very simple in the United States but not in the United Kingdom.\n\nCoca-Cola has been produced since the 19th century, and packages from that time are in the public domain because of age. I don't know whether Coca-Cola has changed its packaging in a substantial way since then, but if not, taking a photo of Coca-Cola packaging should be fine. Mars seems to be from 1932 and unless there is some way to identify the person who created the packaging design used in 1932, the original packaging would be in the public domain in Europe as anonymous works enter the public domain 70 years after publication. Package designers usually don't sign their works, so it is probably impossible to identify the designer. Of course, I don't know whether the packaging has changed since the 1930s.\n\nSome files on Commons might actually be copyright violations. Copyright violations are deleted when discovered, but there are probably lots of violations out there which haven't been discovered yet.\n\nFile:Scotty Brand potatoes.jpg has an illustration of a dog and a photo of potatoes. It says that the brand was established in 1948, so it would be plausible to assume that everything printed on the package was created in 1948 or later. Things like this are copyrighted for at least 70 years since publication in Europe. 1948 was less than 70 years ago, so even if everything was published during the first year, the packaging would still be copyrighted in Europe. More likely, the current design was created more recently as companies like to change their packaging designs once in a while. Thus, not OK. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThanks for that reply. I'm not sure I agree on the Coca-Cola and Mars comments, as both of those companies would assert that their logo is a work of artistic effort, and certainly a whole load of the images are of new products that are only very recently introduced. But I guess that is beside the point, since two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nMy point is that to illustrate packaging, you kind of have to have a photo of it and I want to determine how to go about doing that... Can I write to the company concerned to get their approval to use the images? Or to use 'official' images off their website? Any suggestions gratefully received...\n\n--User:Nextraterly\n\nBonjour,\n\nSur la page Commons:Village pump/Copyright/Archive/2012/05#French money, j'ai posé quelques questions au sujet des billets et pièces de monnaie de la France.

That's a reason to keep a short blacklist. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nHi, Stefan4. You have posted on my talk-page that the image in question does not provide sufficient copyright information. Well, I have tried to understand all the links for further readinding, but I failed. Let me put it as I understand it: I have uploaded an image which I have copied from an openly accessible IBM web site (IBM Redbooks). Now, as it is in the public domain, I understand it to be free. However, I may be wrong. Anyways, I think the same may apply to to two more images: it's \"PureSystems1.jpg\" and \"PureSystems2.jpg\". Much as I would like to use them in the articles, they were deleted, though. Now, I truly would be delighted if you could help with this little issue. Regards, Akolyth (talk)\n\nIf the images are, as you wrote, in the public domain, you have to provide evidence that the images are in the public domain. I find no such evidence on the web site you listed as the source, so it seems that the images aren't in the public domain. In that case, you have to identify the copyright holder and follow the instructions at COM:OTRS. Otherwise, the image will be deleted after a week. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThe Source section of the image description clearly states that I created this file; it was not \"found on the Internet\". I have removed the {{bsr}} tag and listed myself in the Author section. --Kbh3rd (talk)\n\nIt clearly says that this image was based on \"public domain data produced by the U.S. Geologic Survey\". Are you saying that you work for the U.S. Geologic Survey? --Stefan4 (talk)\n\n\"Based on\" means that it is derivative work that is subject to its own copyright, which I automatically received when creating the image, and which I chose to release to the public domain. All works of the U.S. Government are in the public domain, including those of the United States Geological Survey. Kbh3rd (talk)\n\nYes, but if the source only is indicated as \"United States Geological Survey\", there is no way to confirm that the source really was made by the United States Geological Survey. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThat map has been used on the English Wikipedia for eight years without any problem, and I no longer have the precise sources at hand. However, anyone with the least knowledge of USGS products would immediately and without question recognize the sources as one the 7.5\" quadrangle map series shaded with USGS DEM elevation data. Knowing the subject, the specific map used could be found.\n\nHonestly, there is enough other dubious cruft around here that you could find much better use of your time than harassing me over such minutiae. Kbh3rd (talk)\n\nI have never been to the United States and don't know what US government maps usually look like. However, I don't think that this is extremely important. That's why I used {{Bsr}} instead of {{subst:dw-nsd}}. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nHi, Can I ask for some help. I took a photo of a wall painting at a local church & uploaded it as: File:Wall painting at Cameley St James.jpg. On 19 Decemebr 2011 you made a change with the edit summary \"Correcting image orientation: Requesting Rotatebot to reset EXIF Orientation as the image is physically in correct orientation.\" & then Rotatebot changed the image to the one now shown. Having done more reading & editing the article about the church on wikipedia it becomes clear that this is an early representation of the the three lions of the Royal Arms of England (possibly one of the oldest surviving) & the orientation should be as I originally had it. I have no idea how Rotatebot works, so could you do whatever is needed to change it back again?Rodw (talk)\n\nSorry about that. Due to changes in software, a lot of images ended up with a wrong orientation at the end of last year, and so the images had to be corrected. I helped with telling Rotatebot which images to fix, but it seems that this image was \"fixed\" by mistake. I have reverted this rotation. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThanks - that's fixed it & now makes more sense in the article.Rodw (talk)\n\nBonjour, et merci d'avoir pris la peine de prendre en considération les fichiers :\n\nFile:Nicolas Dalayrac par Gauthier..jpg\n\n, et\n\nFile:Nicolas Dalayrac par Quenedey..jpg\n\nActuellement ils ne sont pas inclus dans l'article car je ne maitrise absolument pas la notion si importante de droit d'auteur. Ces deux fichiers proviennent de la bibliothèque nationale de France “en ligne”. Est-ce une condition suffisante pour que ces documents soient considérés comme libres de droit ? Et avec quelle licence ?\n\nPar ailleurs existe-t-il une définition minimum nécessaire pour que l'image figure sur Wikipedia ?\n\nQuestions posées à la communauté mais sans réponse.\n\nAvec tous mes remerciements. Cordialement. 6PO (étonné de voir figurer en signatutre une adresse IP) --86.211.57.170\n\nBonjour ! Il faut indiquer pourquoi les images sont libres en France et aux États-Unis. Toutes les images publiées avant 1923 sont libres aux États-Unis. Si le dessinateur est mort avant 1942, les images sont libres en France aussi. J'ai cherché sur Google et il paraît que les images furent publiées en 1801. Donc, il paraît que les images doivent êtres libres dans toute la monde et qu'il ne reste plus de droit d'auteur. J'ai corrigé la licence. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nBonjour, et merci pour votre aide si précieuse. Elle incite à essayer de comprendre ce qu'est une licence pour média. Par ailleurs la recherche de plus haute définition est possible, mais je n'ai pas saisi comment.

I live in Shinjuku now and it is eazy for me to take photo in Shinjuku erea. I was born near Shimashimadani, Bandoko, Nyakutakuji site. I go this erea frequently-every month this spring and summer. Also, it is eazy for me to take photo in Matsumoto erea of Japan. My old age family（more than 130 years ago）was a stuff of Nyakutakuji temple, the temple was broken in 1871 in tide of Japanese histry \"Meiji-ishin\". So, my family kept the woodcut about Nyakutakuji temple. The woodcut was made in 1750-1840. I saw the woodcut in my childhood every year. Now, I am 64 years old. I am a Japanese, live in Japanese language, do not use English usually. It is difficult to understand what you write when your English is difficult. I was sad when I saw this page.

The website clearly sais, that the picture is open source and free for everyone to use - where's the problem?! --111Alleskönner (talk)\n\nThe information on that page is not enough. You claim that the image is licensed as {{Cc-zero}}, but prove no evidence of this.\n\nThis page tells that the logo is \"open source\". \"Open source\" normally means that the logo is available under some free software licence ({{GPL}}, {{LGPL}}, {{MIT}} or something else). One requirement of free software licences is typically that you have to provide the name of the licence (and often a copy of the licence). Failing to do this is typically a copyright violation. You have specified {{Cc-zero}} which is not a software licence and thus unlikely to be correct. Anyway, if you do add a software licence, you need to find a source which confirms that you have listed the correct licence.\n\nThe words \"free to be used by everyone\" are not specific enough. Are you only allowed to use an unmodified version of the image, or are you also allowed to modify the image? A free software licence implies the latter, but the notice is too inexact for anyone to identify the correct terms. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nOK, I got this, though I don't understand why \"free for everyone to use\" isn't enough to use it free for everyone indeed.... For me \"free\" is \"free\" and \"free\" doesn't imply any limitation. But now the file has been deleted, so a correction isn't possible anyway.

A different user added a Turkish licence template, but I'm not sure if it is enough. According to en:WP:Non-U.S. copyrights, Turkish photos can't be kept if taken after 1925, but I just learnt in Commons:Deletion requests/File:Atatürk.jpg that there might be an error at en:WP:Non-U.S. copyrights which could solve things. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nステちゃんさん, Commons:Deletion requests/File:MustfaFehmi.jpgに関して、もう少し明確に説明していただけないでしょうか？土耳古では、歴史的な写真のうちクレジットされていたのは極稀で、原作者が不明または不詳というのが多いです。そうした場合、著作権法では、最初に発行した者とか最初に配布した者とかが著作権者のごとく振舞えます。新聞社とか通信社とか政府機関、つまり個人ではなく法人がこれに該当することが多いです。ただし、著作権が切れる前に著作権者たることを主張したケースも稀なので、大抵は、そのまま著作権保護期間が満了してパブリック・ドメインになっていた、という具合です。ぶっちゃけ、en:Rule of the shorter termでいけばいいかと思っていたので、ちょっと寝耳に水的な感じです。いずれにしても、本件は、当該ファイルだけでなく他の多くの同様のファイルにも影響する可能性があるので、米国法と土耳古共和国法の関係についてのご説明、よろしくおねがいします。またね。\n\nTakabeg (talk)\n\nそれと、en:File:Atatürk1.jpgだけど、これは、1923年3月17日にメルスィンのMillet Bahçesi (敢えて訳すと国民庭園)で撮影されて公開されたかなり有名な写真です。en:File:Atatürk2.jpgは、1920年4月23日にアンカラのウルスで撮影されたもので、大国民議会の開会にあたってお祈りしているところで、File1と比べるとはるかに有名な一枚です。これらをCommonsにウブしてもいいですよ。そうしたら英語版ウィキで削除できますし。どうでしょう？\n\nTakabeg (talk)\n\nen:Special:PermanentLink/86961917によると、en:File:Atatürk2.jpgは「Mustafa Kemal Pasha during Ramazan Bayramı shortly before the final battles (May 1922)」ですが、どうでしょうか。\n\n--Stefan4 (talk)\n\nそうですね Takabeg (talk)\n\nStefan4 (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nWhat exactly is the problem ?

It says that \"You are free to share, to copy, distribute and transmit the Photo.\" However, it seems that you are not free to modify the photo. Commons requires photos to be available under licences which allow you to modify the photos. Besides, only administrators can undelete files, so you will have to contact an administrator for undeletion if you manage to obtain a sufficient licence. --Stefan4 (talk)\n\nThank you for all the help.
