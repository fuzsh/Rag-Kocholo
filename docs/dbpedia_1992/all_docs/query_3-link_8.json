The full episode is available in audio format at this link on Brighteon.com (or play the embed video below). Welcome to Brighteon broadcast news for Monday, December 11...\n\n12/11/2023\n\nMike Adams\n\nNow, this title may change by the time you see this, but that last phrase is really critical to understand: To keep America alive. And what I’m going to reveal to you today here in this analysis is that the reinstatement of Alex Jones on Twitter is no accident. And it has much larger implications than what most people imagine. Because it coincides with Elon Musk, the military, what I call deep intelligence networks, and how they are now supporting Elon Musk, and they are supporting Tucker Carlson. And they’re also preparing to put Trump back into office..\n\n…\n\nAnd even though it’s not obvious on the surface, the number one most astonishing failure that has taken place that has actually handed power over to the military intelligence faction is the defeat of NATO in Ukraine. This is sending shockwaves throughout the system, that the United States military could not defeat Russia..\n\n…\n\nSo the the pro America military intelligence faction, which is pro Trump, and pro Elon Musk, I believe worked to get Alex Jones reinstated.\n\n…\n\nSo, let me be clear about this because this is not a black and white scenario. And I’m trying not to insert my own opinions into this. I’m trying not to say that Trump is good or Trump is bad, but rather just tell you cause and effect here. So Trump supports Big Pharma, big war, big banks.\n\n…\n\n..This is why even Pfizer right now is reducing production of COVID vaccines, and actually laying off many people in certain divisions of the company, Big Pharma needs, you could say, a new shot in the arm. And Trump is exactly the person that they believe will enable them to do that, because Trump will be all in for fast tracking drugs, fast tracking vaccines, and responding to upcoming pandemics in a way that favors the bottom line profits of pharmaceutical companies at the same time.\n\n…\n\nNow you might ask, Why then is Alex Jones reinstated on Twitter? And what does Elon Musk have to do with all of this? Well, Elon Musk is deeply involved in research projects for the military. Many experimental projects, which are exotic weapons systems, exotic launch systems, exotic optical systems, and of course, neural link systems, which is human brain interface, both surveillance and active motor control systems. The United States military knows that the future of warfare is going to very heavily involve drones and automated systems. And we’ll talk about AI coming up here in a little bit. But part of the answer here is also going to be cyborg systems…But the real aim here is to build cyborg soldiers.\n\nBut secondly, soldiers, I’m sorry to say this, but the new recruits are not as smart as they used to be. The military services are having more and more difficulty recruiting young soldiers…And so for these less sophisticated soldiers, in order to be outfitted with cyborg systems, which is the ultimate goal, they need to have systems that are simply more intuitive and less technical.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Elon Musk, and Alex Jones and Tucker Carlson, and Donald Trump? Well, everything, it’s simple. In order for the United States to remain viable, in terms of its military projection around the world, it needs to develop more autonomous drone systems and cyborg systems. It needs to become a world leader in AI, and also neuro link implants as well as other key technologies, such as hypersonic missiles, which by the way, AI systems can help theoretically develop. Elon Musk is seen as a key gatekeeper in this quest for applied technology\n\n….\n\nSo I believe a deal has been made between the deep military intelligence networks and Elon Musk. And this deal involves the reinstatement of Trump. And Tucker Carlson was activated on Twitter in order to help bring back Trump by going full tilt at the fascist Biden regime. And the loser leftists who are losing our wars in Ukraine, and potentially in the Middle East, and certainly coming soon in Taiwan. In other words, Elon Musk has been given a green light to activate anybody that he thinks is necessary to help turn the tide against the anti Trump rhetoric that’s out there. And to expose the truth about how much the Democrats have been destroying America on purpose, in order to reinstate Trump as president, which would require a massive flood of voter support for Trump, and for this reason, I believe Alex Jones has been reinstated.\n\n…\n\nSo again, Elon Musk was given a green light to reinstate people like Alex Jones, and I believe that you’re going to see Alex talking very favorably about the defense of America, which is a very important concept. And I agree with that concept. We need to keep America alive. And the importance of shoring up America’s military might in order to protect our borders, and to make sure that we don’t lose wars overseas, which is what’s happening right now. Now, Alex Jones has sharply criticized Trump in the past, and I’ve been critical of Trump as well on several issues such as Operation warp speed. But when push comes to shove, most people who are aware of what’s going on if given a simple choice between Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump, if those are the only options, the choice is crystal clear. It’s Trump all the way. No person in their right mind would vote for Joe Biden.\n\n…\n\nTrump is in essence being brought in as a kind of combat field medic for the dollar, to patch it up, stop the bleed, and bring the dollar back into viability so that more money can be printed, to hand it over to the military industrial complex to work on more exotic weapon systems such as autonomous drones, Cyborg interface systems, human machine systems, hypersonic missiles, and also exotic space weapons through Space Force. So this is why Tucker Carlson was brought on to Twitter. This is why Alex Jones is being reinstated. This is probably why I was reinstated. Although I probably haven’t followed the path that some of these people wanted me to follow. But I do admit that at the end of the day, if it comes down to Biden versus Trump, there’s no doubt I’m on Team Trump at that point, even though I have been extremely critical of some of Trump’s decisions, I would much rather live in a world where America still exists, rather than a world where we’re overrun by globalists, and we’re under UN control, and we’ve lost our Constitution. That’s why I say this is a very complex issue for all of us, including you listening to this, you’re not going to get a perfect candidate.”\n\nRussia through the hidden eye (continuation)\n\nMoscow 24 TV channel, \"Biohacking.

You are asking increasingly more complicated questions. To answer them, you need to be an expert in big numbers, big data and AI.\n\nMankind is currently facing many threats. Due to genetic research, it is now possible to create a superhuman, a specialized human being – a genetically engineered athlete, scientist, military man.\n\nThere are reports that Elon Musk has already had a chip implanted in the human brain in the USA.\n\nTucker Carlson: What do you think of that?\n\nVladimir Putin: Well, I think there’s no stopping Elon Musk, he will do as he sees fit. Nevertheless, you need to find some common ground with him, search for ways to persuade him. I think he’s a smart person, I truly believe he is. So you need to reach an agreement with him because this process needs to be formalized and subjected to certain rules.\n\nHumanity has to consider what is going to happen due to the newest developments in genetics or in AI. One can make an approximate prediction of what will happen. Once mankind felt an existential threat coming from nuclear weapons, all nuclear nations began to come to terms with one another since they realized that negligent use of nuclear weaponry could drive humanity to extinction.\n\nIt is impossible to stop research in genetics or AI today, just as it was impossible to stop the use of gunpowder back in the day. But as soon as we realize that the threat comes from unbridled and uncontrolled development of AI, or genetics, or any other fields, the time will come to reach an international agreement on how to regulate these things.\"\n\n( ...\n\nOn February 8, as part of the Day of Russian Science, students of the SESC MSU visited the VK office.

Unlike microelectronics and many other technologies, we are not hopelessly behind in this area, and with proper investment of funds and efforts, we will be able to reduce this gap and compete in this regard with the leading participants in this race,” Popkov summed up.”\n\nMinistry of Science and Innovation Policy of the Novosibirsk Region\n\nДНК-паспорта получили посетители стенда Новосибирской области в День российской науки на ВДНХ | Министерство науки и инновационной политики Новосибирской области\n\nФлагманы новосибирской науки, создаваемые по нацпроекту «Наука и университеты», инициированному Президентом РФ, а также уникальные разработки инновационных компаний региона представили на стенде Новосибирской области в День российской науки на площадке выставки-форума «Россия» на ВДНХ.\n\nFebruary 10, 2024\n\nDNA passports were received by visitors to the stand of the Novosibirsk Region on the Day of Russian Science at VDNH\n\nThe flagships of Novosibirsk science, created under the national project \"Science and Universities\", initiated by the President of the Russian Federation, as well as the unique developments of innovative companies in the region, were presented at the stand of the Novosibirsk Region on the Day of Russian Science at the site of the exhibition and forum \"Russia\" at VDNKh.\n\nIrina Manuilova, Deputy Governor, took part in the events at VDNH on the Day of Russian Science on 8 February, in particular, she stressed that Russia's technological sovereignty and economic growth in Siberia will be ensured by unique scientific developments and breakthrough projects in the field of science and innovation, which are being successfully implemented in the Novosibirsk Region.\n\n\"It is very symbolic that the Novosibirsk Region presents its programme at VDNH on the Day of Russian Science. We introduce visitors to the work of innovative companies – residents of Academpark and Skolkovo, in particular, with a new product for those who want to get their genetic passport and find out what recommendations in terms of maintaining reproductive health, physical condition, and a healthy lifestyle are most effective for them. We presented our scientific flagships, such as SKIF and the creation of \"digital twins\" – lectures by Siberian scientists were devoted to this. We are very pleased that our lectures and expositions aroused great interest among visitors to the Russia Exhibition and Forum at VDNH,\" said Irina Manuilova.\n\nAs part of the work of the Novosibirsk Region stand, innovative specialists took buccal epithelium from everyone, told about the path it goes through in the laboratory, gave the opportunity to work with some laboratory equipment, and also showed what result a person gets in the end - his genetic passport. Biologists presented research aimed at the safe control of pests - insects and mites - for plants and humans.\n\nIn addition, ambassadors of Novosibirsk science held a number of lectures at the forum venues, presenting the scientific achievements of the region. Siberian scientists told students of Moscow technical universities about the history of the creation and use of a digital twin of the urban atmosphere in Novosibirsk, the development of an artificial intelligence system for seismic data analysis and the installation of a megascience class on the example of the implementation of the SKIF project in the Novosibirsk region, as well as about the unique characteristics of the Center for Collective Use.\n\nIn the field of science and innovation, several breakthrough projects are being implemented in the Novosibirsk Region, aimed not only at ensuring the economic growth of Siberia, but also at achieving the technological sovereignty of the entire country as soon as possible. One of the key ones is the project for the comprehensive modernization of the Novosibirsk scientific center \"Akademgorodok 2.0\". Its most important facilities are the Siberian Ring Photon Source Center for Collective Use, the Genetic Technologies Competence Center, and Novosibirsk State University with an updated research base and a world-class campus. The developments of Novosibirsk scientists in a number of areas are unique and have no analogues in Russia and in the world. They concern, in particular, molecular research.\n\nRecall that the international exhibition and forum \"Russia\" was organized in accordance with the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. The exposition of the Novosibirsk Region at VDNH is presented by order of the Governor Andrey Travnikov.\n\nNorth Caucasus Federal University\n\nСеверо-Кавказский федеральный университет\n\nСеверо-Кавказский федеральный университет — один из ведущих вузов России. СКФУ. Еще больше возможностей для твоего будущего!\n\nNCFU SCIENTISTS HAVE DEVELOPED AN INNOVATIVE METHOD FOR ASSESSING THE EMOTIONAL STATE OF A PERSON\n\n05 March 2024\n\nThe North Caucasus Federal University has developed a unique computer technique for diagnosing a person's emotional state. This development allows you to determine the level of awareness of your emotions and identify negative thoughts.\n\nThe methodology, developed by the research group of the Department of General Psychology and Personality Psychology of NCFU, is an electronic test that will help determine how well a person understands their emotions and feelings, whether they have any negative thoughts or attitudes that prevent them from experiencing emotions.\n\n\"The development of our scientists is an innovative tool for assessing the emotional state of a person. I would like to note that the new method has a wide range of applications in psychology, medicine, education and other related areas. I am sure that this development will make a significant contribution to the development of specialized science,\" said Dmitry Bespalov, Rector of NCFU.\n\nCurrently, scientists of the federal university are developing a web application to solve prognostic problems of monitoring the state of human emotional health. The program's capabilities include remote surveying, viewing results in a convenient graphical format, and on-line data processing.\n\nThis development will also be available for use by practicing psychologists. With its help, they will be able to assess the emotional state of their clients and identify possible problems that can lead to emotional disorders.\n\n\"Our goal in developing the methodology was to identify and concretize psychological phenomena that can interfere with the constructive processing of a person's past and current emotional experience. This makes it possible to make a probabilistic prognosis of the development of pathological emotional symptoms and conditions, as well as to create individual programs of psychological assistance,\" said Irina Belasheva, Head of the Department of General Psychology of NCFU.\n\nSuch an approach to the analysis of the psychological state can be applied by specialists in various fields, including clinical psychology, personnel management, medical institutions, as well as research centers dealing with problems of health and well-being of the population.\n\nIt is worth noting that the methodology is already being actively tested by teachers, graduate students and psychology students when conducting scientific research on the problems of psychological health and personal safety. The development is also included in the register of computer programs and has a certificate of state registration.\n\nWall posts\n\nНАУКА ОБ ЭМОЦИЯХ В СКФУ <br><br>В Северо-Кавказском федеральном университете разработали уникальную компьютерную методику для диагностики эмоционального состояния человека.

This software solution will improve the quality of working with information, reduce the risks of errors and biases, and save both time and resources. A notable advantage of the program lies in its capability to process a wide variety of statement types.\n\nToday, neural networks are commonly used for statement verification, even though they were not initially designed for this purpose and may 'hallucinate’, generating texts that do not align with reality. Neural networks are trained on extensive datasets; if these datasets contain errors or inaccuracies, the network's outputs may be erroneous. The fact-checking assistant developed at HSE University aims to address this problem.\n\nThe program is made up of several key components, which include searching for text fragments relevant to the user's statement, comparing these fragments with the statement, and, finally, making a conclusive decision regarding the statement's accuracy. The program's outputs include the final decision, the probability of its accuracy, and the text fragments that either corroborate or contradict the statement.\n\n...\n\nThe developers at HSE University can customise the program upon request and train it on data from specific sources. The virtual assistant features a user-friendly interface and is suitable for use by researchers, fact-checkers, or framework developers as either an integrated verification tool or a browser plug-in.\n\nNews of the FAI \"Project Directorate of the Ministry of Construction of Russia\"\n\nA lecture on the implementation of the national projects \"Housing and Urban Environment\" and \"Ecology\" was held at the exhibition \"Russia\"\n\n30.01.2024\n\nOn Friday, 26 January, Pavilion No. 15 of VDNH \"Building the Future\" hosted an interactive lecture for students of the faculties of State and Municipal Administration of leading Russian universities on the implementation of Russia's national projects. The event was organized by the Project Directorate of the Ministry of Construction of Russia, which accompanies the implementation of federal projects that are part of the national projects \"Housing and Urban Environment\" and \"Ecology\".\n\n...\n\nToday, it is difficult to imagine the development of any field of activity without the use of modern technologies. Digitalization has not bypassed the urban economy, in connection with which the departmental project \"Smart City\" is being implemented, which was presented in her report by Daria Dolgikh, Deputy Director of the Project Directorate of the Ministry of Construction of Russia.\n\n\"The Smart City project is a bridge between all spheres of modern life, and for us – between all federal projects that we support. Digital solutions and smart technologies are already being integrated into all of our lives: in a broad sense, it is everything that makes our lives easier and more comfortable in a technological sense. The digital affects the formation of a comfortable urban environment and the housing and utilities sector,\" said Daria Dolgikh. \"Since the IT industry is developing very intensively, and one of the drivers is the companies themselves with their own ideas, and, of course, you need to follow the trends that they set. For this purpose, there is a Solution Bank that brings together effective business cases.\"\n\nВ России предложили новый подход к изучению активности головного мозга\n\nПо словам ученых, этот подход является альтернативой для двух общепринятых теорий, описывающих активность мозга при совершении движений конечностями\n\nA new approach to the study of brain activity has been proposed in Russia\n\nAccording to the scientists, this approach is an alternative to two generally accepted theories describing brain activity when making limb movements\n\nMarch 6, 2024. Russian neurophysiologists and mathematicians have developed a new approach to the analysis of brain activity, in which scientists have proposed to focus the attention of the scientific community on the waves of activity that run through the cerebral cortex in the process of its work. This was reported by the press service of the AIRI Institute of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"Our goal was to create a mathematical approach with strict requirements and conditions that would expand the existing scientific picture of the world. The methods we propose will be useful to scientists in the development of brain-computer interfaces and in the study of brain stimulation,\" said Ekaterina Kuzmina, a junior researcher at the AIRI Institute, whose words are quoted by the press service of the organization.\n\nAs the scientists note, the approach they created is an alternative to two generally accepted theories describing brain activity during limb movements. Proponents of the first of these ideas, the so-called representational approach, believe that each individual neuron in the cortex is responsible for its own parameter of limb movement: acceleration, speed and direction of arm movement, its angle, and other characteristics.\n\nMany of the predictions of this theory have been successfully tested and proven in experiments with brain-computer interfaces, but it does not reflect all aspects of how the brain works, which has led to the creation of a competing model, the so-called dynamic approach. Its proponents suggest taking into account the overall dynamics rather than the work of individual neurons when analyzing brain activity. It reflects cyclical changes in the functioning of neurons, which occur according to a principle that scientists call \"rotational dynamics.\"\n\nFive years ago, Russian neurophysiologists and their colleagues from the United States, Brazil and Europe found evidence that this theory does not describe all the processes that occur in the cerebral cortex during voluntary movements of the limbs and other forms of activity. This forced them to study in detail the data collected during observations of the work of the cerebral cortex of monkeys and rodents, for which the scientists used machine learning methods.\n\nThe calculations carried out by the researchers showed that the existence of cyclical changes in the activity of neurons can be explained by the fact that special waves of activity \"run\" along the surface of the motor cortex of the brain. Based on this consideration, Russian scientists have developed two mathematical techniques that allow them to use the properties of these waves to study how the activity of neurons changes during brain function. As Kuzmina and her colleagues hope, the approaches they have created will accelerate the development of brain-computer interfaces and brain stimulation techniques for the treatment of neurological diseases.\n\nThe results of the study are published in:\n\nNeuronal travelling waves explain rotational dynamics in experimental datasets and modelling - Scientific Reports\n\nSpatiotemporal properties of neuronal population activity in cortical motor areas have been subjects of experimental and theoretical investigations, generating numerous interpretations regarding mechanisms for preparing and executing limb movements.

Представители самых разных сфер...\n\nThe first expert meeting was held to prepare proposals for the Environmental Security Strategy of Russia until 2050\n\nThe round table 'Ecology of the Future Begins in Russia', the first of the expert meetings on the preparation of proposals for the Environmental Safety Strategy of Russia until 2050, organized by the Russian Society for Nature Conservation and the Roscongress Foundation, was held. Representatives of various spheres of the economy, science, business, and public organizations are involved in the preparation and thinking about how to balance the aspects of the development of society and man with nature, and what Russia's environmental policy should be.\n\nGlobal environmental problems are felt anywhere in the world and are associated with climate change, degradation of water systems, desertification, loss of biodiversity, deforestation, air pollution, soil degradation and loss of fertility, and waste accumulation.\n\n...\n\nChanges in the climate agenda should be based on a specific territory, and not tied to money, have measurable indicators and resource efficiency, and not the degradation of natural resources, said Dmitry Skobelev, Director of the Research Institute Center for Environmental Industrial Policy. We and the BRICS countries have a large spatial resource, which is underestimated, and we need to capitalise and monetise this resource. It seems expedient to look at our natural areas not from the point of view of costs, but to make them a provision for a new emerging currency through environmental projects. And the main thing is that all over the world there are approaches that have already been recognized to ensure the uniformity of measurements. We need to agree only on standards.\" Dmitry Skobelev also proposes to consider the Concept of Natural Capital as a Gift Fund, as well as to shift the focus to green projects, the result of which is real effects, such as the restoration of disturbed ecosystems and territories. \"This is an underestimated resource that countries such as Russia and the rest of the BRICS members possess,\" the expert believes.\n\n...\n\nRaif Vasilov, President of the Ovchinnikov Society of Biotechnologists of Russia, believes that the new Strategy should reflect: \"The first is a change in man's attitude to nature as an object of exploitation, that is, nature should become a partner of man in his development. And the second, of course, is a radical revision of the technological base itself, the civilization that has been created by humanity.\" A new approach to transforming the technological base is truly a challenge on a planetary scale. We are talking about the introduction of nature-like technologies that make it possible to restore the balance between the biosphere and the technosphere. \"In fact, we are talking about the formation of a new global ecological order,\" Vasilov said. This topic can be extremely attractive for third world countries, because for them it is the bioeconomy that can become the main tool for solving the problem of food security, the problem of ecology and the problem of energy.\"\n\nthe cornerstone: \"the nature–like technosphere is a part of the noosphere..\"\n\nPress Center of the National Research Center \"Kurchatov Institute\" 02.11.2023 The Kurchatov Institute summed up the results of the International Forum of Nature-Like Technologies http://nrcki.ru/product/press-nrcki/-48401.shtml More than 20 scientific events, about 1,500 scientists...\n\nSt. Petersburg State University\n\nMarch 6, 2024\n\nSt Petersburg University Scientists Have Developed a Method for Automatic Detection of Irony in Speech\n\nLinguists from St. Petersburg University, having conducted a study of speech, have identified the gesture, intonation and mimic features of a person who uses ironic expressions in his speech. Identifying the key differences between an ironic conversation and a neutral one will improve automatic speech recognition and audiovisual synthesis systems based on artificial intelligence.\n\nVoice and audiovisual assistants have become a part of modern life, but a significant part of the speech techniques that a person uses in everyday life is understandable only when talking between people. For example, ironic statements directly depend on the situation and intonation, so they are understandable, as a rule, only intuitively and are not picked up by artificial intelligence.\n\nThe results of the study are published in the proceedings of the International Conference on Speech and Computer\n\nGestures vs. Prosodic Structure in Laboratory Ironic Speech\n\nThe current paper deals with paralinguistic means of irony expression in Russian laboratory speech and their synchronization with different parts of prosodic structure of the utterance. The role that gestures and prosodic characteristics of laboratory speech play in...\n\n..\n\nIn gestures and facial expressions, irony is distinguished not only by specific movements, such as certain movements of the lips and eyebrows, but also by how they are combined, as well as their relationship to the audio signal. As part of the fundamental research, scientists have gained knowledge about what characteristics a person uses for the ironic coloring of his speech and what he uses to determine it in the speech of the interlocutor.\n\nWork on the detection of speech patterns, such as irony, based on sound and gestures, makes it possible to improve automatic speech recognition and audiovisual synthesis systems based on artificial intelligence.\n\nSt. Petersburg State University, the first university in Russia, was founded on January 28 (February 8), 1724, when Peter the Great issued a decree establishing the University and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Today, St Petersburg University is a world-class scientific, educational and cultural centre. In 2024, St Petersburg University will celebrate its 300th anniversary.\n\nPerm Polytechnic University\n\nPERM POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF NEURAL NETWORKS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION\n\n06.03.24\n\nNeural networks are taking over more and more different areas every day and automating many processes. One of the most popular areas is image recognition. It is used in medical diagnostics, in the automotive sector for recognizing signs on the road, for navigation and visual perception of the environment in robotics, for detecting incidents in video surveillance systems. Continuous modification and improvement of methods is required to reduce errors. PNRPU scientists have developed a machine vision subsystem that provides reliable recognition of small objects and objects at different distances from the camera. The proposed scheme will help, for example, to detect weapons or dangerous objects in a crowd.\n\n..\n\nThe development of Perm Polytechnic University scientists will improve image recognition using neural networks, increase the accuracy of detecting small objects and objects at different distances from the camera.

Smart City\"\n\n06.03.2024/SMART CITY\n\nRyazan hosted the regional day \"Digital Pumping. Smart City\" of the Central Federal District for the digital transformation of the urban economy.\n\n..\n\nSergey Plugotarenko, CEO of ANO Digital Economy and moderator of the session, noted that digital transformation has been identified by Vladimir Putin as one of the national development goals, and the \"monization\" of cities is an integral part of this process: \"In 2023, ANO Digital Economy, together with the Ministry of Construction of Russia, set themselves the goal of assessing the degree of use of AI technologies in a smart city. With the use of AI, quality of life indicators increase by 10-30%. Already, 59 regions of the Russian Federation are actively implementing smart city solutions using artificial intelligence, and, according to our analytics, one of the likely next stages for the period from 2025 to 2040 will be the integration of infrastructure solutions into a single digital circuit.\"\n\n..\n\nAccording to Daria Dolgikh, Deputy Director of the Project Directorate of the Ministry of Construction of Russia, the regions of the Central Federal District have a high degree of activity in the implementation of the Smart City project, which is determined by the implementation of measures for the digitalization of the urban economy, the activities of the departmental Smart City project and participation in the All-Russian competition \"Best Municipal Practice\". \"3 projects from the regions of the Central Federal District were included in the top solutions according to the results of the Best Municipal Practice competition in 2023: the introduction of the Central Panel software module of the Digital Heat Supply software package in Voronezh, a digital platform for managing the municipal economy of the Novotalitsky rural settlement of the Ivanovo Region based on artificial intelligence technologies, and the dispatching of artesian wells in the rural settlement of Belokolodezskoye, Oryol Region. The potential of the regions is very high, and we are glad to get acquainted with the experience of the Ryazan Region,\" said Daria Dolgikh.\n\nAndrey Ulyanov, Minister of Digital Development of the Ryazan Region, spoke about the projects that are being worked on in the Ryazan Region today and how they affect the lives of citizens: \"Digital technologies are becoming more and more deeply embedded in everyday life and help to make the right management decisions, structure data from various sources, and improve business efficiency. At present, the elements of the \"smart urban environment\" have been created separately and do not yet form an ecosystem. The task of the authorities today is to direct all these initiatives and undertakings in the right direction, for the benefit of the residents of the cities and the region as a whole.\"\n\nA smart city is a whole range of solutions aimed at improving the comfort and safety of citizens' lives, using a wide range of technological solutions. The goal of this project is not only digital transformation and automation of processes, but also a comprehensive improvement in the efficiency of urban infrastructure.\n\nAutonomous Non-Profit Organization of Additional Professional Education 'Center for Advanced Professional Training of the Arkhangelsk Region'\n\nАвтономная некоммерческая организация дополнительного профессионального образования «Центр опережающей профессиональной подготовки Архангельской области»\n\nЦентр опережающей профессиональной подготовки Архангельской области\n\nOn December 22, a master class \"Art and \"Drawing with Artificial Intelligence\" was held at the Center\n\n25.12.2023\n\nAurum Kettunen, a mentor in artificial intelligence, shared his experience and knowledge in the field of artificial intelligence and helped students from the Arkhangelsk College of Telecommunications named after Rosing, the Arkhangelsk Polytechnic College and the Technical School of Construction and Urban Economy to master unique techniques.\n\nThe children learned how technology can become a creative ally, opening up new opportunities in the world of art.\n\nNortherner lived lnder the guidance of Artificial Intelligence for a month:\n\nHe told what had happened from that\n\nThe man even microchipped himself\n\nMarch 2, 2024\n\nThe man gave the AI information about himself and his interests\n\nAurum Kettunen lived under the guidance of artificial intelligence for a month. The program controlled the daily routine, nutrition, training, and so on. And one day, the AI advised Aurum to install a chip under his skin... and Aurum agreed. How the man came to a life that resembles a fantasy novel, and what impressions he had from the bold experiment, he told in an interview with 29.RU.\n\n...\n\nThe man created his own company, where they teach how to work with generative AI: they tell how technology can be used to develop business and in everyday affairs.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence capable of generating text, images, or other data in response to prompts.\n\n\"I tell you that man, as homo sapiens, has undergone a certain kind of transformation. This is not my invention, this is the so-called modern theory, anthropology, that now it is no longer homo sapiens, but its subspecies – homo digital. It may be a cliché, but exactly half of our personality is uploaded to the cloud. We interact with the Net and we don't pay attention to it anymore.\"\n\n\"You open your smartphone and immerse yourself in the web. How do the sensations change? A few bits of information in the form of emoticons can make your heart beat faster.\"\n\nAurum Kettunen, lived under the guidance of artificial intelligence\n\n\"It's unbelievable, if only for the simple reason that in the past, in order for a person to experience some kind of stress or their heart to start beating faster, they had to see a tiger or understand that there would be no harvest this year. Now everything is simpler: it is enough to open the phone, and a person will experience much more sensations than from the outside world.\n\nAurum does not presume to judge whether such a transformation is taking place for good or bad. But he himself willingly uses modern technologies. For example, his company has four people and 11 \"digital employees\":\n\n— In fact, we have an analyst, a marketer, a copywriter, and someone who makes commercial offers. There is a doctor, just imagine, who is connected to databases with our medical records: if there are some tests that need to be sorted out, it works very well. In fact, we have a staff of robots. Plus, basic automation is all robots.\n\nLived by the advice of AI to debunk myths\n\nNot only Aurum participated in the project, but also his colleagues. Artificial intelligence made a daily routine, prompted people what and in what quantities to eat, how and when to exercise.\n\n...\n\nWith this experiment, Aurum wanted to debunk the prejudice that artificial intelligence is something dangerous:\n\n\"For people, artificial intelligence evokes associations with some crazy microwave oven with a machine that will run after you, like in the movies of the 2000s.\"\n\nClose interaction with AI does not scare him:\n\n\"How can a well-functioning calculator or computer be intimidating? For many people, fright is associated with the so-called Eliza effect. In the 1960s, Eliza's chatbot relied on so-called emotional markers. That is, when you write the words \"sad\" or \"love\", she answered with a certain emotional coloring, which created the effect of the presence of a living creature in a person. But this is just an effect. It's a perceptual error, nothing more.\"\n\nELIZA is a virtual conversationalist, a computer program by Joseph Weizenbaum written in the 1960s that parodies a dialogue with a therapist.\n\n\"There's no need to be afraid. It's like being scared of a car. There is no difference between a hammer drill, a calculator, a machine, and an AI. These are all tools.\"\n\nThe man explains that AI can provide much more information than a regular search engine on the Internet, and allows you to work with data more efficiently.\n\nAurum gives an example that using a search engine, a person will write a book for six months, and with the help of AI, he will be able to do the same in two hours while drinking coffee.\n\nHe implanted three chips in his hands and ready to connect the chip to the brain\n\nArtificial intelligence also advised Aurum to implant a chip. The man explained that he first gave the program some information about himself and his interests: based on them, the AI generated recommendations. Aurum decided to undergo implantation because he himself thought about it.\n\nNow the man already has three devices under his skin. One with personal data, which Aurum calls a \"business card\", another works as a key to magnetic locks at home and at work, and the third allows you to pay without a card - with the touch of your hand.\n\nThe implantation of tiny chips was also done by Aurum's colleagues. Before that, they checked their health, since any interference in the body has contraindications.\n\n\"The whole team didn't have any problems, because the puncture is made with a thin needle. Everything is neat, no marks, no bleeding.\"\n\nThanks to the experiment, the northerner's company began to be discussed throughout Russia and abroad. For example, Aurum talked about his experience on Channel One.\n\nAt the same time, Aurum emphasizes that he does not advocate microchipping for everyone.\n\n\"It's everyone's choice. If you want to put veneers on yourself, for God's sake, if you want to implant some improvements in your body, no one forbids you to do this.\"\n\nAurum placed the payment implant under the skin on the back of his hand. If you look closely, you can see its outlines.\n\nAurum explains that so far such a procedure cannot be widespread, since it is no longer just a puncture, but an invasive operation, an incision is made for it.\n\nTo put a chip on their own, people take off-the-shelf electronics, create a sealed shell of special silicone, and then apply for implantation. And it is relatively inexpensive:\n\n— For 15,000 rubles, you can get a payment implant.\n\nThe Northerner says that there are not so few chip carriers in the world:\n\n\"There are a lot of technicians and engineers who work in the IT field, work at facilities and do not carry passes with them. Everything is right here [under the skin]. I know people with military specializations who have implants: there is personal information, blood type, health information, and so on.\"\n\nAs Aurum says, for the most part, people around him have a positive attitude towards his modifications. When he pays in a store with a touch of his hand, it is surprising, and when people learn how it works, they react with admiration.\n\n\"People say, 'Look, I probably wouldn't do it for myself, but it looks cool,'\" Aurum says. \"It all depends on how you look. Of course, if you go around hitting people and say, \"I'm a cyborg!\" no one will say that you're a normal person. And if you are a socially pleasant person, if it brings good emotions, then why not? I only had positive reactions. Only once did it happen that a person was \"stuck\" and could not understand how I paid.\"\n\nAt the same time, the man understands that there are those who consider chips in the body to be something absolutely unacceptable:\n\n\"Even some archpriest hated us: he wrote that we were terrible people, that we were opening the Overton window. Although this (implantation of chips – Ed.) was ubiquitous before us. But, apparently, there is a high degree of social tension now, and that is why this has caused such emotions.\"\n\n\"I myself am a supporter of the idea of transhumanism. It's the idea that technology has the power to improve people's lives and bring some kind of social justice.\"\n\nAurum Kettunen, lived under the guidance of artificial intelligence\n\nBy his example, the man wants to show that new technologies should be studied and implemented in your life, and not be afraid of them:\n\n\"As you can see, nothing terrible happened to me. Aliens don't control me. The world government, too. Everyone is alive and well, and we use technology for people.\"\n\nAurum says that in the future he is even ready to supply a chip that connects to the brain: such technology is already being tested.\n\n...\n\n\"As for me, patients with a foreign body in the body, and even more so in the brain, should take anticoagulants for life, and maybe even immunosuppressive drugs in order to prevent the same complications that I mentioned above, but in the late postoperative period,\" said Valentin Korotkiy [Candidate of Medical Sciences, surgeon, assistant of the Department of Faculty Surgery No. 2 of the I.M. Sechenov Perm State Medical University]. \"Maybe, of course, the inventors have found some kind of \"ultra-inert\" material that is not rejected at all. But today I can hardly believe it, I have not seen reports of this nature. Summing up, at this stage of the development of science and technology, we are not yet threatened by mass chipping, unless some technological breakthrough occurs and hitherto unknown methods, forms and substances with a fantastic level of inertia are found.\n\nSubcutaneous Chip Installation Kit\n\n***\n\nRussia through the hidden eye (continuation)\n\nCome on, I'm almost ready to ''quit for health reasons'', so to speak, more softly.

In medicine, this is called an \"implant\", it is used to restore hearing for the deaf, remove tremor in patients with parkinsonism, stop epileptic seizures and treat dystonia.\n\nWhat the scientific discoveries of recent decades lead to, whether it is possible to control people with the help of such technologies and what neuroethical questions arise in connection with their use - world-class neurophysiologists discuss these topics in the film: Alexander Kaplan (Lomonosov Moscow State University, Russia), Mikhail Lebedev (Skoltech, Russia), Jonathan Wolpaw (National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies, USA) and others.\n\nAmong other things, the film solves the important problem of destigmatizing cyborg people and ridding society of technophobia.\n\n- One simple operation - the installation of a cochlear implant - can radically change the life of a child born deaf: he acquires hearing and the ability to develop like ordinary children. The problem is that many parents are afraid to implant a foreign body into the child's head and deprive him of this opportunity, \"says one of the heroines.\n\n\"Chip Inside Me\" is produced with the financial support of the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation.\n\nУказ о присуждении премий Президента в области науки и инноваций для молодых учёных за 2023 год\n\nВладимир Путин подписал Указ «О присуждении премий Президента Российской Федерации в области науки и инноваций для молодых учёных за 2023 год».\n\nExecutive Order on awarding the 2023 Presidential Prizes in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists\n\nVladimir Putin signed Executive Order On Awarding the 2023 Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists.\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nText of the Decree:\n\nHaving considered the proposals of the Presidential Council for Science and Education, I decide:\n\nTo award the 2023 Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists and the honorary title of Laureate of the Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists:\n\nSusanna Gordleeva, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor of the Lobachevsky National Research University of Nizhny Novgorod, for the development of models and technologies of neuromorphic artificial intelligence based on biophysical neuron-astrocyte network models for memristive electronics;\n\n...\n\nО лауреатах премии Президента в области науки и инноваций для молодых учёных за 2023 год\n\nНовости, стенограммы, фото и видеозаписи, документы, подписанные Президентом России, информация о деятельности Администрации\n\nWinners of the 2023 Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists\n\nFebruary 7, 2024\n\nSusanna Gordleeva, winner of the 2023 Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists\n\nThe prize was awarded for the development of models and technologies of neuromorphic artificial intelligence based on biophysical neuron-astrocyte network models for memristive electronics.\n\nSusanna Gordleeva was born on November 5, 1987 in the city of Gorky, Professor of the National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences.\n\nResearch interests: radiophysics, biophysics, mathematical modeling, numerical methods and software complexes. Scientometric indicators (number of publications / Hirsch index): WoS – 52/19, Scopus – 77/20, RSCI – 114/15.\n\nS. Gordleeva's works are devoted to the development of mathematical models of neural networks of the brain, which are applicable in the creation of new biosimilar technologies of artificial intelligence - neuromorphic systems of artificial intelligence.\n\nS. Gordleeva obtained a number of fundamental results that reveal new principles of information processing, learning and generation of functions in brain systems based on the interaction of neurons and glial cells, as well as the causes of the development of neurodegenerative diseases in the process of aging. The identified patterns made a significant contribution to the development of the theory of neural networks and contributed to the emergence of a new scientific direction dedicated to the development of the fundamental foundations of artificial intelligence systems based on biosimilar neural networks.\n\nBased on the developed mathematical models, applied solutions have been created in the field of neuromorphic artificial intelligence and predictive medicine to prevent the development of neurodegenerative diseases and maintain healthy longevity. The developed technologies of neuromorphic artificial intelligence are able to overcome the limitations of existing machine learning methods in terms of energy efficiency and in solving problems with time encoding of information.\n\nThe capabilities of modern microelectronics allowed S. Gordleeva to start the physical implementation of the developed neural systems in the form of hardware applications of a new generation - microelectronic neurochips that imitate various functions of the brain. Such microelectronic devices are already being tested in the country's leading scientific organizations.\n\n* * *\n\nЦифровая эволюция: как ученые создают нейроморфные системы | Наука.рф\n\nНаучный журнал.

Neural networks help diagnose diseases, become business consultants, and automate workflows. But there are tasks that algorithms are not yet able to do. For example, to completely reproduce the work of the human brain. Such developments at the intersection of biophysics, mathematics and biology are considered to be among the most promising in the world.\n\nSusanna Gordleeva, professor at Lobachevsky University (Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod), winner of the 2023 Presidential Prize in Science and Innovation for Young Scientists, told how scientists are trying to teach a neural network to \"think\" intelligently and what robots can borrow from nature.\n\n— In February of this year, you became a laureate of the Presidential Prize in the field of science and innovation for young scientists. For which development did you receive the award?\n\n- I've developed models of neuromorphic artificial intelligence. Unlike the ubiquitous classical neural networks, it replicates the principles of the human brain. This simulation allows algorithms to spend less energy when processing large amounts of information.\n\nThe key feature of this technology is that I added astrocytes to it, which are glial cells in the central nervous system that are necessary for the physical and chemical support of neurons. This made it possible to increase the performance of neural networks, they began to cope better with applied tasks.\n\n— How are astrocytes related to information processing? Why did you decide to add these cells?\n\n— The fact is that in recent years there have been many scientific publications with very interesting experiments. They show that astrocytes are actively involved in the processes of information processing in the brain, the formation and storage of memory, and the work of cognitive functions.\n\nIn fact, these glial cells were discovered quite a long time ago. But for a long time it was believed that they served only as an auxiliary element of neurons: they nourish them and remove metabolic waste. At the same time, they do not know how to emit electrical signals, which means that they do not participate in the processing of information. Therefore, all information processing processes in the brain depend mainly on neurons that generate electrical signals. There are synapses between neurons through which these signals propagate through the neural network, transmitting information.\n\nBut recent experiments have shown that in response to neuronal signals, astrocytes can still generate something, namely a calcium impulse, that is, an increase in the concentration of calcium inside the cells. At the same time, such signals take three times longer to travel (the duration of electrical signals is one millisecond, and for astrocytes it is from one to ten seconds).\n\nThis causes the cells to release chemicals called gliatransmitters, which are identical to those involved in synaptic transmission between neurons. And since astrocytes are tightly attached to synapses, this release of particles can affect the efficiency of signal transmission between neurons: strengthen or, conversely, weaken it. Scientists have found that if, for example, you turn off some mechanism of astrocytes' influence on the transmission of signals between neurons, then in mice or rats, memory suffers and cognitive functions are impaired.\n\nAll this research has led to the emergence of the concept of the tripartite synapse: according to it, not only neurons, but also astrocytes are involved in the transmission of signals in the brain. So I added astrocytic mathematical models to our system that affect synaptic transmission between neurons.\n\n— In what areas can such a neural network be used?\n\n— In fact, in any place where information processing is needed. But one of the promising tasks, perhaps, is the creation of neural implants or neural interfaces. Such systems record brain activity. Therefore, it is necessary that information processing should be carried out with the help of systems adapted to biological mechanisms.\n\nSimilar neural networks are also suitable for memristive microelectronics. Memristors are memory resistors. In fact, they are artificial analogues of synapses. Currently, research is underway to find the ideal material for memristors.\n\n*The photos are from the press service of Lobachevsky University\n\n- You've been working on this project for more than ten years. What did the process of creating artificial intelligence look like?\n\n— It all started with my scientific work in the fourth year of the Faculty of Radiophysics. In fact, my supervisor, Viktor Kazantsev, and I were among the first to add astrocytes to neural network models.\n\nAt first, I studied the scientific literature, in fact, the results of the above-mentioned experiments. In general, in our business, everything usually happens like this: for example, an article is published that shows how some biophysical mechanism affects memory. I analyze these materials and then write a mathematical equation describing this effect shown in the experiment. Then I add my calculations to a large neural network model. Next, I'll explore its dynamic modes and key parameters. All the work is done with the help of a simulation on a computer.\n\nOn this topic, I defended my master's thesis, then my PhD and doctoral theses. As a result, we were able to model large-scale neural networks consisting of a large number of elements, and quite detailed ones.\n\n— How was the new neural network tested?\n\n— Basically, we gave her the task of memorizing information and then checking how she classified the images.\n\nIn this regard, our models are good because they are biophysical. This means that all the processes and parameters in them are related to the living brain and can be measured in experiments.\n\nWe compare simulation results and experimental data to validate the model and make sure it's working correctly. This is very important. Because later, when we change the parameters, our model will begin to predict some things, which then also need to be confirmed experimentally, based on some hypotheses.\n\nBy the way, in 1952, British neurophysiologists Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley later received the Nobel Prize for such a biophysical, close to biology, description of mathematical models. They have written one of the most detailed and accurate biophysical models to date, mimicking the generation of electrical impulses in neurons. The scientists took one section of the membrane of the squid neuron and described its biophysical characteristics. And in quite detail.\n\nAll these parameters can be experimentally confirmed today. More than 70 years later, this model can still predict effects that are then confirmed in experiments. It's amazing!\n\nAndrew Huxley and Alan Lloyd Hodgkin\n\n— How did all this make it possible to improve the work of artificial intelligence?\n\n— We compared the performance of a conventional spike neural network (the one that mimics the mechanism of the cerebral cortex) and our spike neural network with astrocytes. It turned out that the accuracy of the classification of the images that we feed to the input of this neuron-astrocyte network is 20% higher.\n\nIn addition, we have shown that it is only through the influence of astrocytes on the transmission of signals between neurons that it is possible to create short-term memory in a neural network. Although, from a biological point of view, this is not quite right. Because in reality, neurons and astrocytes are always switched on and involved in remembering information together. And in mathematical models, we can improve their performance by turning individual cells on and off.\n\n— How much does brain science know? Can any biophysical process be shifted to the work of algorithms?\n\n— In fact, there are many unresolved issues, especially when it comes to cognitive processes. Our brains are large and made up of different structures. We have studied cellular and subcellular mechanisms well. But we still have a poor understanding of what processes are associated with the formation of memory, how information is stored and processed by different departments.\n\nThis is the main difficulty when we write computational models. They describe only those cellular mechanisms that are known and confirmed by experiments. We need to put all these pieces together into one theory. And so, gradually, by adding new mechanisms, we will be able to understand how they interact with each other. It's a complex process. But that's exactly what mathematical models are for.\n\nHowever, this is not the only problem. Now there are more and more international projects, their goal is to build a digital model of the brain. Such research is very interesting and brings together a world-class team of experts in neural network modeling, including experimental biologists who help biophysicists and mathematicians.\n\nBut the fact is that there are a huge number of cells in the brain that need to be taken into account. To do this, you need good computing power. To describe all these processes, many equations and parameters are required. And, most likely, it is unlikely that it will be possible to simulate an entire human brain.\n\n— How do you plan to develop your technology?\n\n— We intend to go further, adding more and more detailed mechanisms to the model, in particular, the influence of astrocytes on neuronal dynamics. We will study how long-term memory is formed and how glial cells are involved in this.\n\nIn addition, we plan to implement these models on physical media. Let's try to build a real computer, a prototype of a neural processor. We will create electronic circuits (electrical circuits) based on memristors that will work according to new principles. We are now actively developing this area within the framework of the program of the National Center for Physics and Mathematics (NCFM).\n\n— Will artificial intelligence be able to increase its cognitive abilities and become more \"human\" in the near future? For example, will he learn to identify irony and sarcasm?\n\n— Your example concerns a more general concept. It is customary to distinguish between weak and strong artificial intelligence. Weak is the name given to machine learning technologies, which surround us almost everywhere today. What we have taught them, they can do.\n\nStrong AI refers to its ability to learn on its own. Your example with irony and sarcasm is about just that. The ability to recognize them is a property of the natural intellect, the rational one. If we introduce the principles of the brain into these technologies, we can make them self-learn. The main problem is to come up with algorithms for such learning. Because we don't yet fully understand how the real brain works. The implementation of the necessary mechanisms is one of the open issues that we are now facing.\n\nIf we manage to do this, then, of course, it will be a breakthrough. And I am absolutely sure that the future belongs to such neuromorphic technologies as ours. They will be more efficient and surpass current technologies in all areas.\"\n\n***\n\nthe cornerstone: \"the nature–like technosphere is a part of the noosphere..\"\n\nIn two words: the common point and the sought end / intermediate goal of all the Sustainable Development Goals, green programs, digitalization, technocracy and transhumanism (of which transgenderism is a part, not the other way around) including genetic programs, mass inoculation, etc. - a peek...\n\nFebruary 8, 2018\n\nThe president held a meeting of the Council for science and education in Novosibirsk.\n\n…\n\nVladimir Putin:\n\n..\n\nThe world is undergoing dramatic technological change. In their scale, they are comparable to the epochs of industrial revolutions and scientific discoveries that radically changed the way of life of people on our planet.\n\n..\n\nIn science, as in other fields, we need to make a real breakthrough. It is necessary to abandon once and for all the support for inefficiency, for outdated, outdated approaches to the organization of scientific activity. And, of course, the country expects from Science new solutions that can change the quality of people’s lives and give a powerful boost to the development of Russia.\n\nThese are the tasks that have been set in the strategy for scientific and technological development. And projects of scientific institutes, research programs, ministries and departments should be directed to this.\n\n..\n\nAnd today, our scientists are helping local companies succeed in the technology race, including in the processing and transmission of big data.\n\nThe interaction of Science and business should be a key condition for the implementation of the Digital Economy Program. On the basis of modern solutions, it is necessary to organize the activity of state and social institutions, transport and management of the city to a qualitatively new level, to take a leading position in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence systems.\n\nMoreover: local scientists have taken a significant step forward in such relatively new interdisciplinary fields for us as life science, where research is carried out at the intersection of biology, chemistry, genetics, medicine, bioinformatics and physics.\n\n..\n\nI believe that the accumulated intellectual and scientific potential makes it possible to organize large-scale genomic research in Russia. And I ask you to develop a suitable program in a short time, to provide mechanisms to support strong teams, create modern infrastructure and train staff. We have just discussed this in detail with representatives of the Siberian branch of the Academy of Sciences.\n\nBoth in genetics and in other fields, t should be used more widely. pomegranate. convergent approach, nature-like technologies. On this basis, we will be able to create new drugs and methods for the treatment of severe diseases, a new energy based on technologies for the most careful treatment of resources. I would, of course, like to hear your suggestions on this.\n\n..\n\nPlease give the floor to Mikhail Valentinovich Kovalchuk.\n\nMikhail Kovalchuk [director of the Kurchatov Institute]:\n\n…We, speaking of the digital economy as a big breakthrough (which is indeed the case), should understand that according to the International Energy Agency, in the coming years the share of energy consumption in the network infocommunication sphere (only networks and terminal devices – consumer network equipment, communications, Wi-Fi) without industrial computing information infrastructure will exceed one third of the world’s electricity production.\n\nWhen we talk to you about the digital economy, we have to understand that if we do not develop the energy sector appropriately, we will not have a digital economy. In the near future, this creates serious constraints on energy resources for the formation of a digital economy. At the same time, nature does not know resource crises and energy starvation. The explanation for this is the extremely high energy efficiency of natural sites.\n\nI will repeat an example I have given so many times. The human brain, which actually created a unique civilization on Earth, consumes 30 watts, and a modern supercomputer consumes tens of megawatts. At the same time, the efficiency of all the computers in the world is far from reaching the efficiency of the brain of an ordinary person.\n\nThus, in order to solve the problem of sustainable energy supply to humanity, it is necessary to move to technologies based on the principles of functioning of living nature – nature-like technologies. It is these technologies that should form the basis of a fundamentally new technological base for the country’s economy.\n\nVladimir Vladimirovich, allow me to quote your speech at the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly when the Kyoto Protocol was being discussed. You said that we support the Kyoto Protocol, but it is only a partial solution to the civilizational problem. We need to talk about the introduction of fundamentally new nature-like technologies that do not cause damage to the surrounding world, but exist in harmony with it and will allow to restore the balance between the biosphere and the Technosphere, which has been disturbed by man. This is truly a global challenge.\n\nI would like to say that a number of technologically significant results have already been achieved both in the field of energy production and in the field of energy consumption. For example, technologies have been developed to generate electrical energy based on the metabolic processes of living organisms. These are so-called biofuel cells, which can be used, in particular, to power microsensors of a biological nature and implantable medical devices.\n\nThe second is consumption technology. Hardware technologies are actively developing, I stress, not software, but hardware implementation of artificial neuromorphic networks for computing devices that work on the principles of the human brain and as a result consume significantly less energy. It should be noted that this research and development in all these areas is actively and systematically carried out in many countries around the world.\n\nI would like to say that today we are at a world level in the field of studying processes in living nature and creating nature-like technologies.”\n\nthe cornerstone: \"the nature–like technosphere is a part of the noosphere..\"\n\nPress Center of the National Research Center \"Kurchatov Institute\" 02.11.2023 The Kurchatov Institute summed up the results of the International Forum of Nature-Like Technologies http://nrcki.ru/product/press-nrcki/-48401.shtml More than 20 scientific events, about 1,500 scientists...\n\nPress Center of the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute”, 03.11.2023\n\nRussia will have a program for the development of nature-like technologies\n\nThe decree was signed by the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin.\n\n[…]within 6 months, an action plan should be prepared, including “the creation of an advanced scientific infrastructure, the formation of human resources and the conduct of scientific research in this area.” Scientific guidance over the implementation of the plan, as well as monitoring and evaluation of scientific results in the field of nature-like technologies are entrusted to the NRC “Kurchatov Institute”.\n\n“Back in the 1930s, Academician Vernadsky said that as soon as the technosphere spreads to most of the world, there will be a resource catastrophe.
