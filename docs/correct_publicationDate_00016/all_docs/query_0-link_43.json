        "text": "\"There are possibly a dozen genius writers in the genre of the imaginative, and Barry Malzberg is at least eight of them.\" -Harlan Ellison\n\n\"Malzberg makes persuasively clear that the best of science fiction should be valued as literature and nothing else.\" -The Washington Post\n\n\"One of the finest practitioners of science fiction.\" -Harry Harrison\n\n\"Barry N. Malzberg's writing is unparalleled in its intensity and in its apocalyptic sensibility. His detractors consider him bleakly monotonous and despairing, but he is a master of black humor, and is one of the few writers to have used science fiction's vocabulary of ideas extensively as apparatus in psychological landscapes, dramatizing relationships between the human mind and its social environment in an SF theater of the absurd.\" -The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\n\n\"The writer who attempts to use the SF mythos as Malzberg has is bedevilled by the inappropriateness of the 'rules' pertaining to the production and consumption of mass-produced fiction.\" -Brian Stableford\n\n\"Malzberg is a true hero.\" -The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\n\n\"There is no one, with the possible exception of Philip K. Dick, whose works, each one of them, are so unpredictable or so outrageous and outraged.\" -Theodore Sturgeon\n\n\"Barry Malzberg is one of science fiction's most literate and erudite writers.\" -New York Times Book Review"
