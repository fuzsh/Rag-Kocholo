Inlaid: \"Collector's Notes\" on Blood Music [2pp.]. Barry Nathaniel Malzberg (born 1939) is an American writer and editor, most often of science fiction and fantasy. Beyond Apollo is a science fiction novel first published in 1972 in a hardcover edition by Random House. Malzberg credits the inspiration for the novel to \"I Have My Vigil\", a 1969 short story by fellow science fiction writer Harry Harrison. The novel's protagonist is Harry M. Evans, the crazed lone survivor of the disastrous first crewed expedition to the planet Venus. The tale is considered one of Malzberg's very best. David R. Deitrick (age 66) is an American illustration artist, scupltor and designer who often works with paper cutouts, markers, and acrylics. He has illustrated numerous SCI FI pubs (e.g., Aboriginal Science Fiction; Amazing Stories, TOR Books), for Virtual World Enterprises, and created BattleTech products, especially novel and sourcebook covers in the early FASA era.

VERY FINE. New and sealed without any visible flaws. Norwalk, CT. Easton Press 1991. Barry N. Malzberg \"Beyond Apollo\". Limited Collector's Edition from the Masterpieces of Science Fiction series. Beautifully illustrated and luxuriously bound in full genuine leather. As new, sealed without any visible flaws. The Masterpieces of Science Fiction series spans the entire history of the genre and encompasses an extraordinary range of work from Jules Verne and H.G. Wells to Isaac Asimov and Douglas Adams. Easton Press began publishing this series of novels in 1986 with commissioned introductions and artwork. There are now more than 140 volumes in the series. Each publication is bound in embossed leather of various colors with titles in 22kt gold. The pages are made of acid-neutral paper and are gilded on three sides. About the book Two astronauts travel on the first manned expedition to the planet Venus. When the mission is mysteriously aborted and the ship returns to Earth, the Captain is missing and the First Officer, Harry M. Evans, can't explain what happened. Under psychiatric evaluation and interrogation, Evans provides conflicting accounts of the Captain's disappearance, incriminating both himself and lethal Venusian forces in the Captain's murder. As the explanations pyramid and the supervising psychiatrist's increasingly desperate efforts to get a straight story falter, Evans' condition and his inability to tell the \"truth\" present terrifying expressions of humanity's incompetence, the politics of space exploration, and the intricate dynamics of psycho-sexual relations . . . Originally published in 1972, BEYOND APOLLO incited controversy, polarizing critics and fans despite winning the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Always disinclined to sell out or compromise his vision, Malzberg became disillusioned with the SF genre, which purported to be THE genre of innovation. Paradoxically, many SF editors and publishers worried about unsettling readers' comfort zones and insisted that authors write in accordance with a set of rules, formulas and codes. Malzberg would neither heel nor kneel; disillusioned, he unofficially retired from the genre in the late seventies and hasn't looked back. What he produced as a science fiction writer, however, remains among the best published during the twentieth century-important in its historical context, but also entertaining and thought-provoking in its own right. Dark, acerbic, funny and smart, BEYOND APOLLO may be Malzberg's greatest accomplishment. This special anti-oedipal edition includes an introduction by novelist James Reich and a study guide that will prove especially useful in classroom settings. About the author Barry Malzberg lives with his wife and daughter in Manhattan and is worried about having recently reached the ominous age of seventy&#133; Mr. Malzberg&#146;s first hardcover novels, Oracle of the Thousand Hands and Screen are seriously-intentioned works which, according to the author, were neither fun to write nor fun in retrospect. Major influences on his work in no particular order are Norman Mailer, J.D. Salinger, Saul Bellow, James Agee, Vladimir Nabokov, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Nikolai Gogol. Not quite. The major major influences upon the author&#146;s \"seriously-intentioned&#148; hardcover novels, as well as eight paperbacks done for the Olympia Press America between 1968 and 1973 were really: Jayne Mansfield, Natalie Wood, Hope Lange, repentance, desire, lust, resentment, ambition and the collected opi of the Four Coins, Four Preps, Four Seasons and the Belmonts. (Dion, too.) Heady stuff for the kid, though, writing for Nabokov&#146;s publisher, citing Gogol and Dostoyevsky as influences; I recommend this experience to everyone having real or even slight pretensions to artistry.
