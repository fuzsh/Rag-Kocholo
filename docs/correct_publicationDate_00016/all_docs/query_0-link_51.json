        "text": "Revelations\n\nMarvin Martin is angry. Night after night, he strips the guests that appear on his talk show of their pitiful pretensions, their commonplace hypocrisies, but how long has it been since he uncovered a genuine revelation? . . . Hurwitz is scared. He selects Martin’s victims, and he made a bad mistake when he chose Doris Jensen; she turned out to be from a competitive network and ruined a taping. Hurwitz's job is in danger . . . Walter Monaghan is desperate. The twenty-ninth man to have walked on the moon wants to tell the Revelations audience the truth about America's \"space program\"—that it never got off the ground. If he's just another mad astronaut, why is it so important that he be silenced?\n\nTogether with Galaxies, Beyond Apollo, and The Falling Astronauts, Revelations forms a thematically linked quartet of Malzberg's novels, all of which are now available from Anti-Oedipus Press. This special paperback edition includes an introduction by D. Harlan Wilson, \"Barry N. Malzberg and the Gravity of Science Fiction,\" and two afterwords by the author, one from the second printing of Revelations in 1976, the other written in 2019 for this latest reprint.\n\nScience fiction is dead, but Malzberg is alive!\n\nBARRY N. MALZBERG is an American writer, editor and agent. His prolific career has spanned numerous genres, most notably crime and science fiction. Malzberg was particularly active in the SF scene of the early seventies, although he became disillusioned with the market forces defining the field and has rarely published SF works since. His most recent activity in the field has been in the form of advice columns for writers in the quarterly magazine of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Malzberg won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for his novel Beyond Apollo in 1973. Over the years, his writing has been shortlisted for the Hugo, Nebula, and Philip K. Dick Awards, among others.\n\nSchize\n\n\"There are possibly a dozen genius writers in the genre of the imaginative, and Barry Malzberg is at least eight of them. Malzberg makes what the rest of us do look like felonies!\" —HARLAN ELLISON\n\n\"Malzberg makes persuasively clear that the best of science fiction should be valued as literature and nothing else.\" —THE WASHINGTON POST\n\n\"One of the finest practitioners of science fiction.\" —HARRY HARRISON\n\n\"Barry N. Malzberg's writing is unparalleled in its intensity and in its apocalyptic sensibility. His detractors consider him bleakly monotonous and despairing, but he is a master of black humor, and is one of the few writers to have used science fiction's vocabulary of ideas extensively as apparatus in psychological landscapes, dramatizing relationships between the human mind and its social environment in an SF theater of the absurd.\" —THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF SCIENCE FICTION\n\n\"The writer who attempts to use the SF mythos as Malzberg has is bedeviled by the inappropriateness of the 'rules' pertaining to the production and consumption of mass-produced fiction.\" —BRIAN STABLEFORD\n\n\"Malzberg is a true hero.\" —THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY & SCIENCE FICTION\n\n\"There is no one, with the possible exception of Philip K. Dick, whose works, each one of them, are so unpredictable or so outrageous and outraged.\" —THEODORE STURGEON"
