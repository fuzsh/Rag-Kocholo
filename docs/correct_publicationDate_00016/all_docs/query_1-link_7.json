You can read this novel on its own or you can go from there with the rest of the series; in any case, it’s hard SF at its thought-provoking best.\n\nBy Gregory Benford,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked In the Ocean of Night as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSet in a world of lunar colonies, cybernetic miracles, fanatic cults, deadly pollution and famine, the first story in the GALACTIC CENTRE CYCLE. This world of social decay is facing hardship, but not far beyond the shores of space comes a mystery, which one man, astronaut Nigel Walmsley is about to touch.

McIntyre,\n\nFrom my list on lost classics of space science fiction.\n\nBy Allen Steele Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nOkay, so you’ve read Dune, you’ve read Starship Troopers, you’ve read 2001: A Space Odyssey, and maybe you’ve even read From Earth to the Moon and The First Men in the Moon. Seen the movies, too (or maybe you cheat and say you’ve read the books when you’ve only seen the flicks). Bet you think that makes you an expert on science fiction about space, right? Not even close!

Then she decided to create her own version of Star Trek and do the stuff she couldn’t do there. The first volume of a series, it kicks things off when the science crew of the good ship Starfarer, upon learning that their brand-new ship is about to be turned over to the military and become a warship, decides to take matters in their own hands and hijack their own starship. Space adventure at its best.\n\nBy Vonda N. McIntyre,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Starfarers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the first in the Starfarers series of novels, the commander of the Starfarer spacecraft, scientist Victoria MacKenzie, must battle her own commanders on Earth to keep on her mission to find extraterrestrial life.

Now I’m a grown-up, I write books for kids - 70 so far and counting. (My latest picture book is called Sometimes I Am Furious, illustrated by Joe Berger.) The Book of Blast Off! is my second book about space (the first one was just called Space – not the most imaginative title, it’s true). I love writing non-fiction for kids because, unlike grown-ups, you can’t blind them with science. You have to know what you’re talking about so you can explain things clearly. They’re the best audience and you want to be worthy of them.\n\nTimothy's book list on making space exploration a blast for kids\n\nWhy did Timothy love this book?\n\nThis is a children’s version of the book that inspired the movie.\n\nLike everyone else who saw that movie, I was blown away by the story – I was also thoroughly ashamed that I hadn’t heard about these amazing women before.\n\nI’m no math whizz, so making all those impossibly complicated calculations – on which people’s lives would depend – is already completely beyond me. But doing so with such dignity and determination in the face of the daily grind of petty prejudice and poisonous ignorance puts them in the superhero category.\n\nI was in tears in the movie, and once again when reading the book.\n\nBy Margot Lee Shetterly, Laura Freeman (illustrator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hidden Figures as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBased on the New York Times bestselling book and the Academy Award-nominated movie, author Margot Lee Shetterly and illustrator Laura Freeman bring the incredibly inspiring true story of four black women who helped NASA launch men into space to picture book readers!\n\nDorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Christine Darden were good at math...really good.\n\nThey participated in some of NASA's greatest successes, like providing the calculations for America's first journeys into space. And they did so during a time when being black and a woman limited what they could do. But they worked hard. They persisted. And they…\n\nPreview\n\nPrelude To Space\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nFrom my list on real-life time machines through sci fi.\n\nBy Jools Cantor Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction lets us readers escape into space or travel through time, but I believe it is most effective when grounded in our primal anxieties. Classics like Nineteen Eighty-Four and The Handmaid’s Tale resonate because the dark futures they describe drive us to prevent their prophecy. These stories give us a window into the world that birthed them by crystalizing the authors' fears into a work of fiction. When I read each book on this list, they transported me to the time they were written. En route, they showed how much our world has changed and how much we humans haven’t.\n\nJools' book list on real-life time machines through sci fi\n\nWhy did Jools love this book?\n\nArthur C. Clarke is my favorite of the “Big Three” giants of the golden age of science fiction. His clear prose and hard-science background mix with big ideas, optimism, and flashes of poetic brilliance, and these qualities are all just getting off the ground in his first novel. Clarke wrote it in 1947, right after he had left his work as a radar engineer for the RAF.\n\nIt is the realistic story of an international effort to put men on the moon, written 10 years before NASA was founded and 22 years before humanity succeeded. I was amazed by the foresight into the difficulties in administration, fundraising, secrecy, public relations, anti-science zealotry, good ol’ engineering, and problem-solving as they sent humanity on its first moonshot. It’s a real case of art inspiring life, as Clarke and other visionaries showed other engineers that the fantastic was feasible.\n\nBy Arthur C. Clarke,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Prelude To Space as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPrelude to Space is a science fiction novel by Arthur C. Clarke, first published in 1951. The story is set in the near future and follows the first manned spaceflight from Earth to the Moon.The novel begins with the discovery of a strange object in space, which is found to be a spaceship from a distant planet. The discovery of this spaceship leads to a new era of space exploration, as scientists and engineers work to develop the technology needed to send humans to the Moon.The main character of the novel is Martin Gibson, a young scientist who is part…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Right Stuff\n\nBy Tom Wolfe,\n\nFrom my list on pilots in the greatest profession known to man.\n\nBy Robert M. Brantner Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nSince I was a child, I wanted to be a pilot. I started flying when I was in high school, and now I am a captain for one of the world’s largest airlines. My journey has been the greatest adventure I could ever imagine, but so many others are out there. Far too many adventures for one person to experience. Through great books, I have been able to visit so many facets of the profession I love so much. I treasure so many of the amazing books about flying that have been written and greatly anticipate the many more that are just beyond the horizon.\n\nRobert's book list on pilots in the greatest profession known to man\n\nWhy did Robert love this book?\n\nThis was the book that made me a pilot. I often tell people that the movie was about the astronauts, whereas the book is about the pilots who were astronauts.\n\nIn this book, Wolfe captures the essence of what it is to be a Pilot better than any other book I have ever read. I first read this when I was in my teens. Before every check ride, I revisited selected passages to get in the right frame of mind to go out and crush my flight.\n\nThis is the book that inspired, encouraged, and drove me. I have read and re-read it more times than I can remember, and I will undoubtedly continue to read it far into the future.\n\nBy Tom Wolfe,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked The Right Stuff as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA wonderful novel and perfect book club choice, The Right Stuff is a wildly vivid and entertaining chronicle of America's early space programme.\n\nWITH AN INTRODUCTION BY US ASTRONAUT SCOTT KELLY\n\n'What is it,' asks Tom Wolfe, 'that makes a man willing to sit on top of an enormous Roman Candle...and wait for someone to light the fuse?' Arrogance? Stupidity? Courage? Or, simply, that quality we call 'the right stuff'?\n\nA monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space programme, and a dizzying…\n\nPreview\n\nAn Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth\n\nBy Chris Hadfield,\n\nWhy did Michael love this book?\n\n“Weightlessness is like a new toy you get to unwrap every day, again and again — and it’s a great reminder, too, that you need to savor the small stuff, not just sweat it.” One of many lessons learned offered by the Canadian astronaut (yes, the one who sang a creative version of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity”) and flew on both the American Shuttle and Russian Soyuz. Like other next-generation astronauts influenced by the Apollo era, Chris reveals a non-jargon view about training and spaceflight with international crews. As Commander of the International Space Station during Expedition 34/35, he writes, “… don’t assume you know everything, and try to be ready for anything” is wisdom that can be related to here on Earth and up there in space.”\n\nBy Chris Hadfield,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBack on the earth after three spaceflights, Chris Hadfield's captivating memoir An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth reveals extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality. This edition contains a new afterword.\n\nColonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4,000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft, and become a YouTube…\n\nPreview\n\nForever Young\n\nBy John W. Young, James R. Hansen,\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nThe autobiography of John Young is almost a history of NASA itself since he began his career there in 1962 and retired from it in 2004. Young was the only astronaut to fly two Gemini missions, two Apollo missions, and two Space Shuttle missions. His book covers all of the various challenges the U.S. space agency faced during that period, and he also touches on the future of spaceflight up until 2012, when the book was published.\n\nBy John W. Young, James R. Hansen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Forever Young as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHe walked on the Moon. He flew six space missions in three different programs--more than any other human. He served with NASA for more than four decades. His peers called him the \"\"astronaut's astronaut.\"\"\n\nEnthusiasts of space exploration have long waited for John Young to tell the story of his two Gemini flights, his two Apollo missions, the first-ever Space Shuttle flight, and the first Spacelab mission. Forever Young delivers all that and more: Young's personal journey from engineering graduate to fighter pilot, to test pilot, to astronaut, to high NASA official, to clear-headed predictor of the fate of Planet…\n\nPreview\n\nPlacing Outer Space\n\nBy Lisa Messeri,\n\nWhy did Janet love this book?\n\nDid you know there is a research center in Utah made for scientists to pretend they are living on Mars? Or that deep-sea submarines and arctic explorers are supposed to be giving us a taste for finding life on Jupiter’s moon Europa?\n\nMy friend and co-author, Anthropologist Lisa Messeri, followed planetary scientists to the unlikeliest of places to witness them transform the planets they study from distant pinpricks in the sky or traces on a graph, into places we can explore or even inhabit.\n\nI loved feeling like I was traveling alongside her as she visits remote telescopes in Chile, Mars camp in the desert, and even sits next to computer scientists building Google Mars to show how our dreams of the extraterrestrial are made right here on Earth.\n\nBy Lisa Messeri,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Placing Outer Space as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn Placing Outer Space Lisa Messeri traces how the place-making practices of planetary scientists transform the void of space into a cosmos filled with worlds that can be known and explored. Making planets into places is central to the daily practices and professional identities of the astronomers, geologists, and computer scientists Messeri studies. She takes readers to the Mars Desert Research Station and a NASA research center to discuss ways scientists experience and map Mars. At a Chilean observatory and in MIT's labs she describes how they discover exoplanets and envision what it would be like to inhabit them. Today's…\n\nPreview"
