        "text": "...[I]f you keep on and ask me what I love about science fiction, Ill reply: I think science fiction is, along with jazz, Americas great contribution to world culture  its as great as jazz, as profligate, as wonderful. As David Brin has said, youve got to look to the 19th-century Romantic Movement in music and literature to find something of comparable importance.\n\nScience fiction is a magnificent instrument. I dont really hate anything about it. What disappoints me about it is that most of its practitioners have not been as good as they should have been, and the fact that science fiction emerged as a genre of commercial literature, forced to make adjustments and compromises to accommodate a mass audience, which was not to its aesthetic interest. I dont segregate myself from those who do so. The readership has contributed to this debasement, I suppose, but any readership does. Norman Spinrad said the worst thing about science fiction is fandom. I dont agree with that at all. Fandom has destroyed some authors  Theodore Sturgeon was brought down by the easy temptation of fandom, the need to be a hero. He is the saddest example, but surely not the only one. There are many deleterious influences surrounding science fiction, but all things considered, I think it has done remarkably well.\n\n*\n\nI think Ive written about ten million published words of fiction, though Ive long since given up counting it. The last four or five years have not been particularly productive. I had what I call a great autumnal run between 1990 and 1993, publishing about a hundred short stories (alone and in collaboration with Kathe Koja), which I think are the best work I ever did. I did them quickly, I did them well and I believe at a new level of accomplishment. And then that was done. Since September of 93, there have been the usual ventures  introductions, little essays for Ellen Datlows Event Horizon  but very little fiction, somewhere between five and ten short stories. I like to feel that Ill be doing some more.\n\n*\n\nAs Thomas M. Disch pointed out, science fiction conquered the world. Maybe, having won, we have to dismantle the war machine and send the colonels home, pension off the troops, and find something else to do. It did its job too well, leaving behind the detritus of science fiction  a slowly, inexorably aging audience not being replaced, and a real feeling of recession. It seems to be in its twilight. But I have to remind myself, I dont think it feels that way to David Brin, say, or Gregory Benford or Kevin J. Anderson. A critic said of an old and nearly incoherent John dos Passos, that he had confused an old mans deterioration with that of the world. I dont want to do that.\n\n*"
