        "text": "1972 novel by Barry N. Malzberg\n\nBeyond Apollo is a science fiction novel by American writer Barry N. Malzberg, first published in 1972 in a hardcover edition by Random House. Malzberg credits the inspiration for the novel to \"I Have My Vigil\", a 1969 short story by fellow science fiction writer Harry Harrison.\n\nThe novel's protagonist is Harry M. Evans, the lone survivor of the disastrous first crewed expedition to the planet Venus. Evans provides details of the doomed expedition as a novel in progress, and he proves to be a remarkably unreliable narrator,[1] constantly changing the particulars of his story as it progresses. It quickly becomes apparent to the reader that he may be completely insane, as a feeling of deep (and comical) paranoia underlies Evans's descriptions of the absurd conversations that ensue with the Venusian inhabitants. There is some indication that Evans could very well have murdered his fellow crewmember. The novel ends with a publishing house offering to purchase the rights to Evans's outlandish tale.\n\nLike much of Malzberg's work, Beyond Apollo was extremely controversial at the time of its publication, receiving both praise and scorn from literary critics.[1][2]\n\nJoanna Russ praised the novel as \"a passionate, fine, completely realized work,\" noting that Malzberg's repetitive use of particular words transformed them into \"a kind of Greek chorus, a terrible, poignant insistence on something that is not quite in the story but yet comes through the story.\"[3] Harlan Ellison commented that \"Beyond Apollo put me out of commission for three days after reading it\".[4]\n\nOn the other hand, Bob Shaw said in Foundation, \"Malzberg's Beyond Apollo is, to me, the epitome of everything that has gone wrong with sf in the last ten years or so\".[1]\n\nThe novel won the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, presented in 1973.[5][6]\n\nBarry N. Malzberg bibliography\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography"
