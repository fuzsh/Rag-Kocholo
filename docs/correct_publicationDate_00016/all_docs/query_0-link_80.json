It is a world peopled by psychotics - while one man is haunted by strange night visions, another can only achieve sexual satisfaction in the Cadillac in which President Kennedy was assassinated, others act out their schizophrenic fantasies, giving a frightening insight into their private anguish. It is a world where mankind has lost its human dignity, even its soul; from which there seems only one way out - the Final Trip... Or is there? One man alone realises that although there must be countless reasons for dying, there can be only a single reason for staying alive. With the help of Beethoven, John F. Kennedy, and other long-dead heroes, he struggles to discover this, and so avert the impending holocaust - Guernica Night\n\n1975, Readers Union, hbk\n\nIn stock, click to buy for £5.00, not including post and packing\n\nAlternative online retailers to try:\n\nClick here to access our prebuilt search for this title on Abebooks\n\nClick here to access our prebuilt search for this title on Alibris\n\nClick here to access our prebuilt search for this title on Ebay\n\nClick here to access our prebuilt search for this title on Biblio\n\nBeyond Apollo [top]\n\nFirst published in 1972 by Faber and Faber\n\nFirst published in 1975 in Great Britain by The Readers Union in hardback with dustjacket, 138pp\n\nStoryline: 1981: the first manned expedition to Venus has returned to Earth and a space programme which is on the verge of dissolution. The commander is missing. The survivor, Harry M. Evans, is insane, he holds the secret of the Venus mission locked somewhere in his skull, but he cannot - or will not - tell anyone what happened. His diary, written while he is institutionalised, is a fascinating and terrible blend of real events and fantasy, written in such a way that they cannot be disentangled.\n\nYet somehow the scientists and doctors must find the answer. The space programme, cut back drastically in the early 1970s after the Apollo missions, tried and failed to land a crew on Mars in 1976, in a tragedy with no survivors and no (apparent) answers.\n\nBeyond Apollo circles round several basic questions which have, to date, not been explored in depth in science fiction. What is the nature of space? What are the effects of technological devices on man? Does the solution of engineering problems open or close the way to space by throwing men into situations with which they cannot deal? Above all, what happens to man in space?\n\nBeyond Apollo was a winner of the first (1972) John W. Campbell Award"
