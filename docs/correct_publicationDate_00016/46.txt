John W. Campbell Memorial Award winner 1973.

Beyond Apollo, Barry N. Malzberg's novel of a NASA mission to Venus gone terribly and mysteriously awry, was published by Random House in l972 and won the first John W. Campbell Memorial Award the following year. Two astronauts depart on a Venus expedition, upon their return, one astronaut is missing and the survivor, Harry M. Evans, is assessed as mad and immediately institutionalized. Evans is unable to explain what happened on the mission; he is encouraged by the supervising psychiatrist to put his thoughts into a journal and it is the journal of that expedition and its several conflicting "explanations" of the outcome of the voyage, which comprise the text of the novel.
