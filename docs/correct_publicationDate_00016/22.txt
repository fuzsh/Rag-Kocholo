A strong and colourful use of Optex for the 1974 hardback edition of Beyond Apollo by Barry Malzberg, published by Faber & Faber. Itâ€™s used throughout the cover for all copy, from the title (all caps) to the author (upper and lowercase), down to the logo on the spine (U&lc). The jacket design is credited to Gask.

The letter design appears to have been tweaked to include an additional colour band (pink) which is reminiscent of some of the variations of Prismania/Prink. Additionally, the capital Y and N appear to be alternates or at least non-standard.
