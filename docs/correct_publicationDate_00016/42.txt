Barry Nathaniel Malzberg (born 1939) is an American writer and editor, most often of science fiction and fantasy.

Beyond Apollo is a science fiction novel first published in 1972 in a hardcover edition by Random House. Malzberg credits the inspiration for the novel to "I Have My Vigil", a 1969 short story by fellow science fiction writer Harry Harrison. The novel's protagonist is Harry M. Evans, the crazed lone survivor of the disastrous first crewed expedition to the planet Venus. The tale is considered one of Malzberg's very best.

David R. Deitrick (age 66) is an American illustration artist, scupltor and designer who often works with paper cutouts, markers, and acrylics. He has illustrated numerous SCI FI pubs (e.g., Aboriginal Science Fiction; Amazing Stories, TOR Books), for Virtual World Enterprises, and created BattleTech products, especially novel and sourcebook covers in the early FASA era.
