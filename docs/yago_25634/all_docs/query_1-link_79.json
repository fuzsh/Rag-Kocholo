        "text": "The new project of the American director, who recently completed his last film Domino, reached the Uruguayans by the hand of Teixeira. The Brazilian, who has independent films such as Frances Ha, The Witch and the Oscar-Winner Call Me By Your Name, previously worked with Oriental Features on the filming of the series The Hypnotist (HBO), as well as the films The Silence Of The Sky and Severina.\n\nTeixeira told the Uruguayans, two years ago, that he planned to produce the new De Palma film. After an intense search of locations, López and Robino managed to position Uruguay as the best place to shoot Sweet Vengeance. The inspection of the places was done with an assistant director of the filmmaker.\n\nRobino described that search for locations as a \"very strong\" process. \"There were very specific things that had to look like another place different from the Uruguayan architectural landscape,\" said the producer, under the halo of secrecy that surrounds all cinematographic projects in their initial stages. It will be filmed in Montevideo and in the east.\n\nOf the plot of Sweet Vengeance it is known that it is based on two real crimes that took place in the United States, and its story will be set in that country. \"It's a contemporary film,\" said Robino. De Palma \"unites these crimes and builds a thriller under his own stamp,\" he added.\n\n\"It grabs us solid,\" López said about the challenge after reviewing the recent work of the producer, which includes the latest film by Federico Veiroj, \"El cambista\" (\"It's spectacular\", the producer said); and the Argentinean \"El motoarrebatador\" -which was premiered at the Cannes Festival- and \"El otro hermano\", by the Uruguayan Israel Adrián Caetano.\n\nIn addition, this will not be the first time that Oriental Features is under the command of a renowned director. In December of 2017 the producer filmed, during a weekend, part of the movie The Pope, of Netflx, directed by Fernando Meirelles (City of God) and which was photographed by the Uruguayan César Charlone. That creative duo had brought, in 2007, the shooting of Blindness, which had Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo filming in Montevideo.\n\nWith their future work with De Palma, Robino and López hope to continue opening the doors of Uruguay to the world of international cinema. They recognized that the challenge is great and that the director is not known to maintain a calm climate in his sets."
