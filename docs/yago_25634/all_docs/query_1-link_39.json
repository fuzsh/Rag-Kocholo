The festival was again jam-packed with amazing film, mostly rarities from film archives and new restorations. I then watched several 2018 films (in theaters and on Netflix). Lastly, the month ended with the news that FilmStruck will be shutting down on November 29th (no worries, I still have a job!), so I have been binge-watching silent films and Japanese cinema. All of this resulted in a lot of cinema consumed. I discovered some new favorite directors and some truly awe-inspiring cinema.

Jacques Feyder)\n\nThis was the world premiere of a beautiful new restoration of this film by Lobster Films and it did not disappoint. This lush three-hour adventure film is an adaptation of the 1919 novel of the same name by Pierre Benoit. I’d seen the 1933 version by G.W. Pabst earlier this year and I think both films are very good (and each keep aspects of the source material that the other discards), but for me this epic is the version. The tinting on this new restoration was to die for and the locations – it was shot in Algeria! – are to die for. I hope this new restoration is released on home video or streaming some day, however based on a conversation I had with Serge Bromberg of Lobster Films this seem doubtful. I’ll forever be glad I was lucky enough to see it with my own eyes.\n\nLe Joueur d’échecs (The Chess Player), 1927 (dir. Raymond Bernard)\n\nI had no idea what this movie was about going in and in no scenario would I ever have guessed that a movie about Polish revolutionaries would include death by an army of automatons. This is available from Milestone Films and I highly recommend seeking it out.\n\nPrivate Life, 2018 (dir. Tamara Jenkins)\n\nNetflix has released a ton of films directed by women this year and I was able to catch up with several of them this last month. This latest film from Tamara Jenkins, her first in over a decade, is a warm and bittersweet and unabashedly humane look at the struggle of a long married couple as they attempt to conceive. Some of Paul Giamatti’s best work, and a fearless performance from Kathryn Hahn.\n\nNeko to Shôzô to futari no onna (Shozo, A Cat and Two Women), 1956 (dir. Shirô Toyoda)\n\nI actually found this movie on FilmStruck when we first launched and when I discovered it was an adaptation of a Jun’ichirô Tanizaki novel (a favorite author of mine), I immediately added it to my queue. I think it’s running time is what kept me from watching it in a timely manner and boy was I dumb. This is THE cat person movie. It’s 2+ running time flies by and it’s filled with utterly delightful moments. A true hard to find gem.\n\nKarumen junjô su (Carmen Falls In Love), 1952 (dir. Keisuke Kinoshita)\n\nI have absolutely fallen in love with the films of Keisuke Kinoshita. I wish I had discovered them earlier! This one is a sequel to Carmen Comes Home (the first color film made in Japan), which is a much more well-known/regarded film, but I actually liked this film better. Both films co-star Hideko Takamine and Toshiko Kobayashi as showgirls whose modern lifestyles get them into many, many shenanigans. Both films reminded me quite a bit of the kind of buddy comedies Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell used to make in Hollywood in the 1930s. Highly recommended.\n\nArigatō-san (Mr. Thank You), 1936 (dir. Hiroshi Shimizu)\n\nThis has got to be one of the sweetest films I’ve ever seen. It takes place over one bus journey from rural city of Izu to the faraway city of Tokyo, with Ken Uehara playing the titular Mr. Thank You – a nickname given to the bus driver as he utters the phrase often during his route. Along the way he helps locals – delivery messages, picking up new records, etc. – as well as helps his passengers. It’s a lovely film about the importance of community and connections, and the resilience of every day people.\n\nYoru no onnatachi (Women of the Night), 1948 (dir. Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nI watched four of Mizoguchi’s “fallen women” films – movies about women who descend into prostitution for various reasons (a topic that several of the Japanese filmmakers I’ve watched in the last few days tackled), with this film being the rawest of the four. It’s rough and it’s real and it will break your freaking heart."
