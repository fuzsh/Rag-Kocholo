At 42, Rodin meets Camille Claudel, a young woman desperate to become his assistant. He quickly acknowledges her as his most able pupil, and treats her as an equal in matters of creation.",

        "text": "There was no need to make a movie on Rodin. I'm comforted by the 4.7 rating on IMDB. I thought it was just me. Vincent Lindon carries the film, but he doesn't compare to Gerard Depardieu's Auguste Rodin as portrayed in the movie, Camille Claudel. Rose, Rodin's wife, was portrayed by the sufficient Séverine Caneele. The character, Camille Claudel, was played by Izïa Higelin. I hate to compare her to Isabelle Adjani (who portrayed Camille Claudel in the movie with the same name). Adjani has grace, beauty, charm, emotional breakdowns, charisma, talent...all of these things Higelin does not. It was a complete letdown. I was looking forward to Rodin.\n\nCompared to Jacques Doillon's other films, this was not nearly as good as Ponette, La Drôlesse, and Les Doigts dans la tête. Perhaps it was not as boring as Raja, but it was awfully close.\n\nThis is the 240th film I’ve seen using Movie Pass.\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, I have watched Bruno Nuytten’s Camille Claudel (1988) (with Isabelle Adjani as Camille and Gerard Depardieu as Rodin) and Bruno Dumont’s Camille Claudel, 1915 (2013) (with Juliette Binoche as Camille) and have read two biographies of Camille, so I was interested in seeing a film that covered the Camille/Rodin relationship from Rodin’s point of view.\n\nThe backbone on which writer/director Jacques Doillon constructs his screenplay is a commission from the Société des Gens de Lettres to do a major sculpture of Honoré de Balzac. After widespread criticism when it was exhibited at a Salon in the Champ de Mars, the Société rejected Rodin’s full size plaster model which Rodin said was meant to represent Balzac’s persona rather than…\n\n[6]\n\nCannes is such a hothouse of opinion. Some infamous disasters from the Croisette actually deserve their infamy (The Last Face, Southland Tales) but many others are more often than not just the wrong movie for the wrong crowd at the wrong cultural moment. (Time has been pretty kind to The Brown Bunny, Irreversible, and Antichrist, for example.)\n\nInterestingly, this year's Competition calamity was not some piece of extreme artsploitation, but a stodgy artist's biopic. Jacques Doillon, a French master whose work has gotten increasingly bizarre over the years, threw everyone a curveball by making a film so stiff and fussy and well-appointed that it was lambasted as some sort of rejected piece of public television. The script, in particular,…\n\n45/100\n\nThe Jefferson in Paris of recent Cannes history (he said, never having seen Jefferson in Paris). Not terrible, just biopic bland; Doillon brings almost nothing distinctive to what's clearly a centennial commission. Most effective when it depicts Rodin's process, as when he repeatedly observes Victor Hugo from across the room during a dinner party and then sprints to his bust-in-progress (located on the other side of the house) before physical details evaporate from memory. Inevitable emphasis on Claudel-Beuret friction never transcends formulaic other-woman melodrama—a glance at The Mature Age yields more emotional power. Cast does solid work when not required to name-drop for the audience or spout exposition. Completists only.\n\nA very deep and multi-layer bio pic about one of the most important figures of all time. Interestingly, Rodin's obsession of portraying Balzac - two vision: his naked and truthful view/depicting a legend with covering the truth and showing only the power is exactly what Doillon is dealing with when he wants to get into Rodin's vision on body: man lost by his perversion or a man who you can call a visionary."
