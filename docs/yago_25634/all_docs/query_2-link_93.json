        "text": "Emmanuel lives with his second wife, Mara, and her 20 year old daughter, Natacha. The relationship between Emmanuel and his step-daughter are tense, and an argument erupts just when Emmanuel is about to go and join his first wife, Lili and his young daughter Elise for the week-end. Emmanuel and Elise take a trip from the south of France into Spain, working on a film project. Through a series of round-about conversations, Emmanuel manages to open up a few channels of communication with Elise — channels that expand even wider when he uses the technique of talking into her video camera to express thoughts and feelings that otherwise would have remained hidden.\n\nCredits: Producer, Jean-Francois Lepetit ; director, Jacques Doillon ; writers, Jacques Doillon, Jean-Francois Goyet ; photography, Michel Carre.\n\nCast: Sami Frey, Mara Goyet, Juliet Berto, Juliette Binoche, Aina Walle.\n\nOur collection comprises over 40,000 moving image works, acquired and catalogued between the 1940s and early 2000s.
