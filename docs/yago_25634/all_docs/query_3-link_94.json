        "text": "PARIS: French authorities Monday detained leading arthouse film directors Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon for questioning over accusations of sexual abuse, as a renewed #MeToo reckoning rocks France’s film industry.\n\nTheir interrogation over the alleged abuse, some dating back to the 1980s and all of which they deny, comes as activists say cinema has too long provided cover for abuse.\n\nAn AFP journalist saw Jacquot, 77, and Doillon, 80, arrive at a Paris police station on Monday morning accompanied by their lawyers.\n\nJudith Godreche, a 52-year-old actor and director, earlier this year formally accused Jacquot of rape and Doillon of sexual assault when she was a minor, accusations both men deny.\n\nShe has described Jacquot as having had an unhealthy “hold” over her during a relationship with him that started when she was 14, from 1986 to 1992.\n\nAnd she has accused Doillon of groping her during an unplanned sex scene in one of his films when she was 15.\n\nSeveral other actors have also filed complaints against both men.\n\nIsild Le Besco, 41, has accused Jacquot of raping her between 1998 and 2007 during a toxic relationship that started when she was 16 and he was 52.\n\nJulia Roy, a 34-year-old actor who has appeared in several of his films, has accused him of sexual assault in “a context of violence and moral constraint which lasted several years,” a source close to the case said.\n\nLe Besco has also charged Doillon made advances during work sessions, while actor Anna Mouglalis alleged the filmmaker forcefully kissed her in 2011.\n\nThe directors’ lawyers said there had been no need to detain them in order to question them, and stressed they should be considered innocent until proven guilty.\n\nJacquot’s lawyer, Julia Minkowski, said her client would “finally be able to express himself before the law,” slamming what she called the “unacceptable excesses” of media coverage on the issue.\n\nDoillon’s attorney, Marie Dose, said no legal criteria could justify his being detained for questioning “36 years” after the incident alleged by Godreche, adding he could have answered queries without being held in custody.\n\nSources close to the case said their interrogation could include a confrontation with those accusing them.\n\nGodreche on Instagram said she was deeply moved.\n\n“I’m crying,” she wrote.\n\n“I don’t know if I have the strength, but I will have it. I will have it... For her,” she wrote, posting a picture of her teenage self next to Jacquot, 25 years her senior.\n\nHer lawyer, Laure Heinich, did not wish to comment.\n\nSince breaking her silence, Godreche has become a leading voice in France’s #MeToo movement.\n\nAfter she appealed for a cinema oversight body, parliament in May voted to create a commission to investigate sexual and gender-based violence in the film industry and other cultural sectors.\n\nThe head of France’s top cinema institution, Dominique Boutonnat, stepped down on Friday after he was convicted of sexually assaulting his godson in 2020.\n\nAnd cinema legend Gerard Depardieu, 75, is to stand trial in October for sexually assaulting two women.\n\nHe also risks a second trial after he was charged in 2020 with rape after actor Charlotte Arnould alleged he raped her in 2018 when she was 22 and anorexic.\n\nHe denies all claims.\n\nMANILA: Following its finest-in-decades Olympic performance in Paris, the Philippines is now setting its sights on showcasing its talent during next year’s Olympic Esports Games in Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast month, Saudi Arabia and the International Olympic Committee announced an agreement to host the inaugural Esports Games in the Kingdom in 2025.\n\nSports events are a key part of Vision 2030, a transformation program spearheaded by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which aims to pivot the Saudi economy away from dependence on oil. The first formal deal with the IOC and Saudi Arabia is the latest addition to the Kingdom’s broad portfolio of sports events.\n\nIn the 2025 Esports Olympics, Filipinos are pinning hopes especially on mobile esports, or games that can be played on a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet, a discipline that has been gaining popularity in the Southeast Asian nation for the past decade.\n\n“We, the Philippines, are actually known for very good, I would say, esports achievements for the mobile category,” Marlon Marcelo, executive director of the Philippine Esports Organization, told Arab News on Wednesday.\n\n“The goal is to make sure that we actually prepare and (ensure) that we can actually give the country its first ever Esports Olympics medal.”\n\nEstablished in 2011, the Philippine Esports Organization is the national governing body for esports in the Philippines.\n\n“We’re hoping that some of the esports games that we play in the Philippines hopefully will be included in the Esports Olympics, which will happen for the first time in 2025,” Marcelo said.\n\n“We’re very much excited … The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has all the infrastructure and they seem to actually know all the needs for an esports athlete to become successful. That’s why, I guess, the IOC was actually happy to host the first-ever Esports Olympics. That says a lot about the preparedness of KSA in terms of infrastructure, equipment and the manpower to make sure that this happens.”\n\nBut before the Philippines gets the chance to showcase its talent, it will first have to prepare to qualify for the games.\n\n“We still need to make sure that we qualify, overcome all the hurdles, so that we’ll make it to the Esports Olympics itself. Number two, making sure that we have funding along the way … We have a very great chance to get medals in the mobile games category,” Marcelo said.\n\n“It’s a long shot, but the dream is still alive. We see this as an opportunity to showcase the Filipinos’ talents, not only in traditional sports, but of course, the new and upcoming sports, which is esports. In esports, there’s no tall, or fat, thin, or big body. It’s all fair, so Filipinos have a great chance to hopefully get the medals.”\n\nPaolo Barcelona, president of the Philippine Esports Press Corps and an esports journalist, was equally enthusiastic about next year’s event in the Kingdom.\n\n“We’re a nation that is known, at least in Southeast Asia, to be strong at various forms of mobile esports, and while the private sector and the country’s National Sporting Association have been helping, the government should make the same level of commitment and long-term investments for Philippine esports,” he told Arab News.\n\n“The hope is that our country can win medals … Once we win a medal, especially a gold one, it can help change the perception of many Filipinos that esports is all about fun and games. Like in traditional sports, athletes spend hours mastering the game, competing from grassroots up to campus and the pro level. We need to show the nation that this can be one more source of national pride.”\n\nPORTICELLO, Italy: Searches resumed for a third day Wednesday on the wreck of a luxury yacht that sank off Sicily, with hope fading that the six missing passengers would be found alive.\n\nThe search operation, which involves specialist divers aided by an underwater drone, continued until late on Tuesday and resumed at first light on Wednesday morning, firefighters said.\n\nThe 56-meter (185 feet) British-flagged “Bayesian” was anchored with 10 crew and 12 passengers on board when it was struck by a waterspout — akin to a mini-tornado — before dawn on Monday.\n\nOne body was found in the hours after the sinking, believed to be the yacht’s chef, and 15 people were rescued.\n\nBut UK tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannah, his lawyer Christopher Morvillo and his wife Neda, and Jonathan Bloomer, the chair of Morgan Stanley International, and his wife Judy remain missing.\n\nFirefighters said on Tuesday evening that divers had entered the inside of the wreck, but that it was a “long and complex” operation.\n\nThe yacht is largely intact, resting on the seabed some 50 meters down.\n\nDespite eyewitness testimonies that the 75-meter mast had snapped, reports on Wednesday suggested that it too, survived the incident.\n\nA coast guard official, Captain Vincenzo Zagarola, had told Italian radio on Tuesday morning that it was “difficult to imagine” that the search would end well.\n\nBut experts noted that superyachts such as “Bayesian” were designed with watertight subdivisions.\n\n“There are records of survivors found in such air pockets,” noted Dr. Jean-Baptiste Souppez, a UK engineering expert and fellow of the Royal Institution of Naval Architects, in a commentary provided by the Science Media Center.\n\nHe noted the case of Nigerian sailor Harrison Okene, who was rescued in 2013 after spending nearly three days trapped in an air pocket after his ship capsized in rough seas off the Nigerian coast.\n\nBut he added: “Whether air pockets formed on the Bayesian is simply impossible to predict.”\n\nThe passengers were guests of Lynch — an entrepreneur sometimes referred to as Britain’s Bill Gates — to celebrate his acquittal in a massive US fraud case.\n\nThe 59-year-old was acquitted on all charges in a San Francisco court in June after he was accused of an $11 billion fraud linked to the sale of his software firm Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard.\n\nKABUL: The Taliban have barred United Nations-appointed special rapporteur Richard Bennett from entering Afghanistan, the administration’s spokesperson told local broadcaster Tolo, accusing the human rights watchdog of “spreading propaganda.”\n\nBennett was appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2022 to monitor Afghanistan’s human rights situation after the Taliban took over the previous year.\n\nBennett, who has previously said the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls could amount to a crime against humanity, is based outside Afghanistan but has visited several times to research the situation.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Council did not immediately respond to request for comment. Bennett could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Taliban administration’s foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Qahar Balkhi told Reuters Bennett “had been unable to acquire a travel visa to Afghanistan.”\n\n“Even after repeatedly requesting Mr. Bennett to adhere to professionalism during work ... it was decided that ... his reports are based on prejudices and anecdotes detrimental to interests of Afghanistan and the Afghan people,” Balkhi said.\n\nTaliban administration spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid has previously said the Taliban respect women’s rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law and local customs. He told Tolo that Bennett would not be allowed to come to Afghanistan, a rare public barring of an individual foreign official.\n\n“Mr. Bennett’s travel to Afghanistan has been prohibited because he was assigned to spread propaganda in Afghanistan... He used to exaggerate minor issues and propagate them,” Mujahid said, according to Tolo.\n\nThree years into their rule after foreign forces withdrew, the Taliban have not been formally recognized by any foreign government.\n\nForeign officials, including Washington, have said the path toward recognition is stuck until the Taliban changes course on women’s rights, having barred most girls over the age of 12 from schools and universities, banning women from parks, and stopping most long-distance travel by women without a male guardian.\n\nAfghanistan’s central bank assets have been frozen and many senior Taliban officials are subject to UN travel restrictions that require them to seek exemptions to enter other countries.\n\nThe UN has been trying to find a unified international approach to dealing with the Taliban. In June, top UN officials and envoys from up to 25 countries met the Taliban in Qatar, receiving criticism from human rights groups for not including Afghan women and civil society representatives at the meeting.\n\nThe UN mission to Afghanistan also operates from Kabul and monitors and reports on human rights issues."
