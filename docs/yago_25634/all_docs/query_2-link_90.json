        "text": "One of the most irrevocable emotional blows that could befall a small child is the sudden death of a parent. The 4-year-old title character of Jacques Doillon's heartbreaking film, ''Ponette,'' has survived a car crash that killed her mother and left the little girl with a broken arm. In the film's opening scene, her father (Xavier Beauvois) is taking Ponette (Victoire Thivisol), to live with an aunt (Claire Nebout), who has two children roughly Ponette's age. As the forlorn child with a cast on her arm clutches Yoyotte, her beloved doll, her father sternly explains to his tearful, disbelieving daughter that her mother is not coming back.\n\nThis poignant French film is so extraordinarily sensitive to the emotional landscape of childhood that only the hardhearted will not feel a vestigial tug of childish terror of parental loss and abandonment. But for all the sadness it bares, ''Ponette'' is far from a tear-drenched portrait of helpless suffering. If Ponette, thrown into a new environment, stubbornly clings to the notion that her mother might somehow return from the dead, she is also healing and growing up in spite of herself.\n\n''Ponette'' is acted with such a remarkable lack of self-consciousness by a cast made up largely of children that stretches of the fictional movie have the look and spontaneity of a documentary on children observed through one-way glass. Especially in scenes set in a nursery school that Ponette attends with her two young cousins, Matthias and Delphine, the movie captures a young child's indeterminate sense of time. Along with the fitful rhythms of children's outdoor play, it conveys the sense of almost every moment being one of discovery and every activity an initiation -- so much so that you experience anew what it felt like to be 4 or 5.\n\nA scene in which three young children dare one other to take turns hiding alone inside a dumpster with the lid pulled down is an emotional roller coaster. One moment you want to cry out for the children to stop playing such a scary and potentially dangerous game. But when they sail through it a tiny bit more sure of themselves than before, you applaud this tiny step toward independence and the conquering of fear. In another scene, Ponette is cruelly taunted by a playmate who tells her it was her meanness that caused her mother's death. Although Ponette is reduced to tears, she fights back and stands up for herself.\n\nThe director also skillfully uses Ponette's anguished situation to pose unanswerable questions about God, Jesus, the afterlife and the relation of religion to superstition. Having weighty theological issues filtered through the imagination of a bereaved child makes them seem fresh in a way that no adult debate ever could. As Ponette listens to the grown-ups' contradictory explanations of where her mother went, all translated in the careful protective language that adults adopt when talking to children, she absorbs them, then improvises her own religious rituals based on her emotional needs. These scenes are a humorous reminder of the susceptibility of children to religious indoctrination. As Ponette is fed the basics of Christianity, the question that perplexes her the most concerns the resurrection of Jesus. If Christ can come back from the grave, she asks, why can't her beloved mother?\n\nNear the end of ''Ponette,'' the little girl visits her mother's grave and begins scratching in the ground to try to unearth her mother. At this point, the naturalistic movie makes a huge, unexpected leap into the mystical that could be taken as a hokily sentimental betrayal. However it's taken, it doesn't spoil the purity of what has come before.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
