        "text": "A movie that asks the long persisting question: is it gay to become psychosexually obsessed with the mistress of your dead husband?\n\nA really tense slow burn of a drama. Certain lines and gestures made the whole experience very intense but also very homoerotic. It definitely kept me watching, but things really pick up in the last quarter, and that part had me on the edge of my seat. It doesn't have the most interesting direction, but the voracious lead performances make up for it. I will definitely be revisiting.\n\nJust came out of an old theater in Brussels who showed this beauty of a film, that left me speechless and quite frankly unable to breathe.\n\nI'm amazed by how little people have seen this. it is so worth it.\n\nMaybe I just have a very strong personal connection to what happened and how Cecile feels about Suzy but nonetheless it is a dizzying story of a widow trying to find the truth behind the relationship her husband had with a girl, she knew too.\n\n\"When does a woman like you become worse than a man?\"\n\nEven weirder on rewatch. There's a certain perversity in the way that Huppert speaks about her time living with Dalle, one that I originally chalked up to the husband's words, but this time I'm not sure. The push-pull of mutual admiration is still as strong, but having now seen Doillon's other works, I wish his direction wasn't as stiff.\n\nIsabelle Huppert Films\n\nA Dostoyevsky adaptation, and thus yet another crossover with one of my favourite writers - though this is based on a story of his I knew next to nothing about going in. As it turns out it's a dark tale of grief, mourning and vengeance in the wake of tragedy, with Isabelle Huppert's Cecilie encountering the mistress (Beatrice Dalle) of her late husband who died in a car accident. From there begin a long series of mind games between the them, mostly told in intensely claustrophobic two shots that test the abilities of both actresses, though it should be said they carry it off with ease and make this a strong outing even though the direction isâ€¦"
