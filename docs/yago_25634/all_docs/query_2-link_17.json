        "text": "French multi-hyphenate Lou Doillon, who is Jane Birkin’s daughter, is set to star in Italian comedy “Quasi a casa” directed by Carolina Pavone, a former assistant director on several Nanni Moretti films.\n\nShooting is underway in Rome on the sophisticated comedy, in which Doillon — a model, actor and singer-songwriter, like her half-sister Charlotte Gainsbourg — plays an eclectic, successful singer who strikes up a turbulent friendship with a younger female musician who idolizes her.\n\nDoillon became a French fashion icon in her teens after working with famed atelier Givenchy and is currently the testimonial of Cartier’s new Baignoire watchmaking collection. The Parisian star first acted in Italy in Abel Ferrara’s “Go Go Tales” and more recently appeared in French director Maïween’s “Polisse” and in “A Child of Yours” directed by her father, Jacques Doillon.\n\nPavone is a promising young helmer who has worked with Moretti on “My Mother” and “Three Floors,” and most recently served as assistant director on the auteur’s latest work “A Brighter Tomorrow,” which launched internationally in May from the Cannes Film Festival and subsequently played well at the Italian box office.\n\nThe film’s other cast members include Maria Chiara Arrighini, Stefano Abbati (“My Mother”) and Michele Eburnea (“A Brighter Tomorrow).\n\nMoretti, who likes to champion young Italian talents, is co-producing “Quasi a casa” (the title translates to “Almost Home”) through his Sacher Films shingle, in tandem with Vivo Film and RAI Cinema.\n\nVivo Film is the indie shingle behind the latest works by Italian directors Susanna Nicchiarelli (“Chiara”), Laura Bispuri (“The Peacock’s Paradise”) and Andrea de Sica (“Don’t Kill Me”).\n\nNews of principal photography starting on “Quasi a casa” was announced by Moretti on Instagram."
