        "text": "English\n\n[edit]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nEarliest known metaphorical reference to revenge as food in English is “And then revenge is very good eaten cold, as the vulgar say”, from a 1846 translation of Eugène Sue's Mathilde: Mémoires d'une Jeune Femme.[1][2] The passage suggests that it was an existing expression. Similar proverbs are known as early as the 17th century with “Reuenge is not good in cold bloud” in a translation of Don Quixote.[3]\n\nThe phrase exists in various Romance languages: Italian la vendetta è un piatto che va servito freddo, Spanish la venganza es un plato que se sirve frío, French la vengeance est un plat qui se mange froid. In French, it's commonly used since at least the 19th century.\n\nIn English, many variations are attested but the exact phrase revenge is a dish best served cold may originate from the 1982 film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.[4]\n\nProverb\n\n[edit]\n\nrevenge is a dish best served cold\n\nRevenge is best or most satisfying when delayed.\n\n1949, Robert Hamer, John Dighton, Kind Hearts and Coronets, spoken by Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price):\n\nTime had brought me revenge on Lionel, and as the Italian proverb says, revenge is a dish which people of taste prefer to eat cold.\n\n1969, Mario Puzo, The Godfather, New York, page 404:\n\nDon Corleone nodded. “Revenge is a dish that tastes best when it is cold,” he said.\n\n1982, Jack B. Sowards, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, spoken by Khan (Ricardo Montalbán):\n\nOf course! We are one big, happy fleet! Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?\n\nTranslations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\ncold blood\n\njustice delayed is justice denied\n\npay off old scores\n\nrevenge is sweet\n\nKlingon translation: bortaS bIr jablu'DI', reH QaQqu' nay'"
