But the truth is that Robert feels an intimate, deep tedium. The boredom of those who have already exhausted all the pleasures of life. The only thing still surprising him is the fact that nothing surprises him anymore. One evening he has an overwhelming encounter with a woman. For his own bewilderment, he discovers the sublime horrors in which the woman has sank.",

The sort of story-telling that gifts the glimmer of distant eyes, a gaze that speaks of a thousand unspoken words, a hundred unfelt emotions... one single shard of unforgettable trauma.\n\nRoberto is suave, worldly, but adrift in aristocratic malaise. One evening, he is seduced by a prostitute, lured in by her air of mystery. Already he can sense something. A break in the relentless routine, something that teasingly lifts the veil of his boredom.

This one begins as if from a book, with a third person narrator easing us into the tale, before the story is picked up by an incidental character who continues the telling direct to audience, as if on the stage. And then the telling quickly passes again, this time slipping into the thoughts of Roberto, a world weary dandy and aristocratic playboy, now bored and dulled by the repetitions of excess. Bored that is, until his interest is piqued by a prostitute, who reminds him of someone he can’t quite place. She seduces him and now he begins to remember…"
