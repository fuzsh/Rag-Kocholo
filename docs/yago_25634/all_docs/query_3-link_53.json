        "text": "Born in the United Kingdom, Jane Birkin (1946â2023) moved to Paris towards the end of the 1960s, where she left her mark as a multifaceted cultural icon. An actor, director, singer, composer, model and activist, this âmost French of British artistsâ to this day remains a symbol of eroticism and freedom, innocence and controversy.\n\nJane Birkin began her career in film while still in England, with small roles in emblematic films including Blow-Up (1966), the first English-language film by the master Michelangelo Antonioni â in which she appeared in a nude scene that caused a scandal in the country.\n\nA few years later, she began to work in France and met Serge Gainsbourg, with whom she would establish a prolific artistic relationship that continued even after the coupleâs separation. Over the decades, Birkinâs vibrant and extensive filmography explored diverse genres spanning the mainstream and auteur spheres, including collaborations with filmmakers like Jacques Deray, Jacques Doillon, AgnÃ¨s Varda, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette and James Ivory. In 2017, she took on the role of director for Boxes. In parallel, Birkin dedicated herself to music, releasing several albums; became a fashion icon (lending her name to the famous HermÃ¨s handbag); and was an activist for social justice.\n\nOver the course of a month, we present a selection of pivotal films that chart and explain the different stages in the life of Jane Birkin, an all-round artist and emblem of a generation."
