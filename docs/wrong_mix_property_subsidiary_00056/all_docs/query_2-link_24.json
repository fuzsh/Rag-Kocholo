        "text": "What's the best alternative to eBay?\n\n💡 Quick Answer: The best alternative to eBay is Facebook Marketplace. Although there are tons of other online selling sites that are very similar to eBay such as Walmart, Wish, Bonanza, and more, many of them specialize in particular niches or locations. Read the list below to find out which eBay alternative is best for your business.\n\nSo you're in a funk with eBay, or maybe you're just looking out into the big wide world of platforms to sell online, to see what opportunities lay yonder. Either way, you've ended up here, and you wonder about the top alternatives to eBay and which ones will suit you most.\n\nNo one can deny the power of eBay: Since 1995, eBay has held its place as one of the largest marketplaces in the world. It has turned thousands of hobbyists into PowerSellers and allowed thousands more to run profitable, at-home businesses. However, the eBay marketplace has evolved significantly in recent years, and various policy changes have prompted an exodus from eBay, as sellers look for other, more lucrative online marketplaces.\n\nWhere there's a will there's a way, and this rise in need for other platforms has produced more options than you can shake the proverbial stick at. So what are these eBay competitors?\n\nBelow you'll find a description of each site, some information about who that marketplace is best suited to and a direct comparison to eBay.\n\nOnline Selling Sites like eBay: Try the Best Alternative Places to Sell in 2024\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon: A Major Marketplace like eBay, but Cheaper\n\nIt's almost hard to believe that once upon a time Amazon was simply an online bookstore that dropshipped much of its inventory. It has since exploded into one of the world's most visited websites, which offers millions of products across a range of product categories.\n\nAmazon is similar to eBay in that you're opting into a large marketplace that a lot of buyers trust, but the massive customer base comes at the price of higher fees and more competition. On Amazon, this means sellers with the same products are competing to win the Buy Box.\n\nIn saying that, the large number of people looking to buy is a definite plus. With larger platforms like these, you need to think of it as getting a smaller slice of a larger pie. Its huge traffic volume is probably the main reason that Amazon's Sellers Choice profitability rating generally isn’t far off eBay’s.\n\nAnother advantage to Amazon is its built-in algorithm that will recommend your products to people who might be interested in them based on their search histories.\n\nHow Amazon Compares Directly with eBay\n\nAmazon sales are instant with a fixed price, whereas eBay’s auction house setup means it might take a week to sell an item\n\nBoth eBay and Amazon offer free listings, but charge fees for successful sales\n\nAmazon charges $0.99 per item sold plus 8%-15% commission of the sale price\n\neBay charges $0.30 per item sold plus 12.9% commission\n\nAmazon offers various perks to customers, like 2-day shipping for Prime members and an all-around great customer service – both of which draw in more customers. eBay doesn’t provide any extra services to customers and leaves it up to each seller to handle customer service.\n\nFulfilment by Amazon (FBA) lets smaller sellers hand over order fulfillment to the commerce giant, taking advantage of their huge number of warehouses around the world and generally making the process smooth and fast for customers. eBay has no comparable service.\n\nWho is Amazon Best Suited To?\n\nAlmost anyone, selling almost anything can run a business on Amazon\n\nCan be challenging for smaller sellers due to competitive pressure that lower prices\n\nPrices need to be competitive enough to be a contender without sacrificing too much of your profit margins\n\nHow to Succeed on Amazon\n\nDo your market research before you commit time, energy and capital to a product\n\nFor example, you can get an idea of how well a product will perform with SaleHoo Labs. Here you can filter products to see the ones with the highest success rate for the lowest competition\n\nLabs also has a constantly updating ‘Product Trends’ section you can use to stay ahead of your competition\n\nCheck out our regular product trend recommendations, curated by seasoned eCommerce experts\n\nSome recent examples:\n\nGaming Headsets\n\nBluetooth Speakers\n\nTeeth Whitening Kits\n\nMuslim Blankets\n\n2. Facebook Marketplace\n\nFacebook Marketplace: Selling with High Exposure to Target Audiences\n\nWith billions of people using Facebook, it’s a no brainer for the platform to get into eCommerce and online marketplaces. Listing your product on Facebook could get you seen by tons of people in your target market.\n\nFacebook Marketplace is similar to eBay in that most people sell used or second hand items. It’s a convenient place for people to list items that they want to get rid of on the platform and target their local market. In the US, FB Marketplace offers additional features more suited to professional sellers such as Facebook Checkout, making it more like a traditional eCommerce store that mostly runs itself.\n\nWhether in the US, Vietnam, or beyond, there are people or company everywhere who use FB Marketplace to list brand new items (like Vietnamese homegrown coffee, clothes), and even those who dropship on there. While it’s not quite like eBay or Amazon, Facebook Marketplace is definitely growing in the eCommerce and marketplace space. Therefore, if you want to take advantage of Facebook’s high traffic, you should consider listing your items there and selling on Marketplace.\n\nHow Facebook Marketplace Compares Directly with eBay\n\nSelling on Facebook Marketplace is free, whereas eBay charges listing and success fees\n\nFacebook Marketplace works mainly for localized selling, where eBay has a huge global customer base\n\nSome customer bases, such as those for antiques are more likely to hang out on eBay than on Facebook Marketplace\n\nIt can be harder to build a brand on Facebook Marketplace, unless you’re in the US where you can sell as a Facebook Shop\n\nOutside the US, payment negotiations happen through messenger, which can be time-consuming if you’re looking to sell large volumes. eBay has a more automated process and payment system\n\nWho is Facebook Marketplace Best Suited to?\n\nPeople selling secondhand items to a localized market will be right at home on Facebook Marketplace. Just be ready to stand your ground when customers try to negotiate with you – because they will!\n\nIf you’re in the US, you can run listings through a branded Facebook Shop which can complement your home store and increase reach\n\nHow to Succeed with Facebook Marketplace\n\nIf you have lots of secondhand items you want to profit from, you can really succeed here!\n\nPrices shouldn’t be too high and leave room for negotiation\n\nThe quality of photos on people’s listings are often less than average, so putting a little elbow grease into making your photography shine can really set you apart here!\n\nAdd as many details as you can to listing descriptions, as this will reduce the number of follow-up question you’ll have to answer before people decide to buy\n\n🎓 Learn More: Facebook Marketplace Dropshipping Guide\n\n3. Walmart\n\nWalmart: The Cut-Throat Underdog\n\nBy now people may have cottoned on that Walmart, one of the largest retail corporations on the planet, has entered the eCommerce marketplace world.\n\nWalmart Marketplace is a platform where select sellers can list and sell products. It’s very similar to Amazon in that you could be competing with Walmart itself, but it’s definitely worth considering as an alternative to selling on eBay.\n\nYou get to take advantage of Walmart’s massive reach and customer base, and it’s free and easy to set up. Walmart seems to be taking the eCommerce space quite seriously, so it’s likely to be investing heavily in this area over the coming years. Who knows, maybe in five years everyone will be saying they wish they were on Walmart from the start?\n\nHow Walmart Marketplace Compares Directly with eBay\n\nThere are no set-up or maintenance fees, but merchants pay a referral fee of between 8% and 20% for successful sales.\n\nThere’s no auction option, it’s just fixed-price listings.\n\nDepending on your product and niche, you could be be competing against Walmart-owned brands, which may get priority on the platform\n\nWalmart’s online sales are lagging behind eBay (and Amazon), but it’s still early days\n\nExpect lower margins – Walmart prioritizes competitively-priced products, which means you might get caught in a race to the bottom\n\nWho is Walmart Best Suited to?\n\nEstablished businesses with solid brands\n\nIf you’ve always dreamed of getting your product in Walmart stores, this might be a good way to make an impression\n\nCould also be a good option for new sellers looking to build brand awareness and credibility\n\n🎓 Learn More: Ultimate Guide to Walmart Dropshipping\n\nHow to Succeed on Walmart\n\nBe in a position where you can make good profit margins with competitive pricing\n\nMake sure you provide great customer service and fast shipping\n\nChase those customer reviews – They can make a big difference on this platform.\n\n4. Etsy\n\nEtsy: The Artsy-Craftsy Platform\n\nEtsy is doing very well as an online selling platform. It started in 2005 as an online community for crafters, artists and vintage enthusiasts, based in an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. Now it has 7.5 million active sellers, and 96 million active buyers. Not bad! It always rates highly in the Sellers' Choice Awards for ease of use, and it was No.2 for profitability after eBay.\n\nEtsy specializes in handmade and vintage goods, as well as craft supplies, but it’s actually branched ou into all sorts of categories in recent years. Yes, it’s limited as to what you can list on the network, but it’s always worth checking if your particular niche fits in – you might be surprised!\n\nOne things is for sure, if you’re looking for the best home decor products to sell, you make geeky things like costumes, jewelry, or fashion accessories, this is definitely the place for you!\n\nHow Etsy Compares Directly with eBay\n\nYou can sell pretty much anything on eBay, whereas Etsy caters in particular to the handmade/ vintage/ boutique niche.\n\nBuyers come to Etsy for the unique nature of the products they're getting, eBay has mass-sold items and big brands\n\nEtsy and eBay both charge fees, however:\n\nYou can list up to 350 items for free on eBay; etsy charges $0.20 per listing\n\neBay listings are up to 30 days, while Etsy's listings last 4 months. This means your listings will last 4 times as long on Etsy before you'll have to renew them.\n\nEtsy charges 6.5% commission on sales, eBay charges 12.9% (or less, depending on the category) + $0.30\n\neBay gets more traffic (723.2M) than Etsy (457.6M/ month), but Etsy has caught up A LOT in the last 5 years!\n\nWho is Etsy Best Suited To?\n\nEtsy is best suited to merchants with handmade items, vintage items, or craft-related resources\n\nOnline sellers who either produce their own unique productsare uniquely suited to this marketplace\n\nEtsy is opening up! Check the categories and you may find you can take advantage of Etsy’s success story too\n\nHow to Succeed on Etsy\n\nIf you create your own products, go ahead and list them to see how you go\n\nIf want to sell wholesale products, you should read Etsy's Seller Guidelines to make sure you’re within the regulations\n\nStock up on wholesale supplies by searching the SaleHoo Directory for \"craft supplies,\" or search for specific types of supplies such as \"fabrics\" or \"beads\" or \"clasps.\"\n\nSelling Platforms Similar to Etsy\n\nWe thought it worth mentioning that there are a few other sites like Etsy now, claiming to have more unique goods than marketplaces like eBay and Amazon. Two in particular are doing very well. If you are interested in tapping into this market, it could be worth trying your luck with:\n\nBonanza: This platform's slogan is \"Find everything but the ordinary\": Any quirky or unique-style items are great here. You're allowed to sell a wider variety of wholesale goods, and it's becoming a very popular network. We'll talk more about Bonanza in the next section.\n\nRuby Lane: With a claim like \"The world's largest curated marketplace for vintage & antiques,\" you're better off selling vintage-style goods and actual antiques here. Ruby Lane's strength is customer service, as reflected in their Sellers Choice customer service rating.\n\nLook around these marketplaces to get an idea of the types of products people are selling, and then find suppliers for them to start selling on these networks.\n\n5. Wish\n\nWish: Target Millenials and Gen Z with Great Deals\n\nIf you’ve ever browsed Wish, you’ll know how astoundingly low some of their prices are. With the majority of prices below $10, selling just about everything under the sun (from smartwatches to sneakers), it’s hard to imagine how some of these sellers even make any money.\n\nIn the past, Wish has made itself a bit of a (bad?) name with tons of counterfeit products, leading to a trend of ridiculous Wish unboxing videos flooding social media.\n\nMany of the products sold on Wish are produced in China, which partly explains the low prices, and also means that orders take a long time to arrive, some customers waiting for months. But when you’ve only paid $2, lots of people probably just shrug and go ‘oh well’.\n\nIn recent years, Wish has gone through a bit of a rebrand and removed a huge number of sellers from their platform in an effort to purge the site of counterfeits.

This means the platform also doesn’t take any responsibility for exchanges, returns or disputes.\n\nHow Bookoo Directly Compares with eBay\n\nListings are free on Bookoo, as well as eBay. But eBay does charge a success fee, which Bookoo doesn’t\n\neBay has A LOT more functionality than Bookoo, which is a very basic localised listing tool\n\neBay offers online payments, which Bookoo doesn’t\n\neBay has huge traffic, Bookoo is a small player with about 700k monthly visits\n\nWho is Bookoo Best Suited For\n\nAmongst the peer-to-peer platforms, Bookoo doesn’t really stand out aside from the fact that it’s free\n\nSellers who want to cover all their bases in listing on various platforms, may want to include Bookoo in their line-up too\n\nThose who enjoy a very localised selling experience\n\nHow to Succeed on Bookoo\n\nGeneral best practice for product listings apply here too:\n\nCatchy title including key words\n\nConclusive, but snappy description\n\nA variety of clear photos\n\nPeople tend to search by category, so make sure you list your items in the right ones\n\n20. eBid\n\neBid: Another \"Sell Anything\" Marketplace\n\neBid is another marketplace similar to eBay and Amazon in that it is a platform for selling almost anything. Still, it's not as well known, so you'd be selling to a smaller pool of buyers.\n\nIt's definitely a lower-cost option than eBay or Amazon, but the profitability rating is also lower, and it didn’t even rank the Top 10 in the latest Seller’s Choice Awards. The absence of listing fees and a low 5% commission charged per sale (on the lowest seller tier) does make this a low-risk market to test out, so if you're looking for a change, you've got little to nothing to lose here.\n\nIf you'd like a thorough run-down of eBid as an alternative to eBay, check out this post: Is eBid a Viable Alternative to eBay?\n\nHow eBid Directly Compares to eBay\n\neBid is similar to eBay in that they both have an auction-style format for product listings\n\neBay is a larger platform than eBid, and receives more traffic\n\neBid is much cheaper than eBay, a lower-risk option\n\nThey're both trusted marketplaces with a wide variety of product categories\n\nWho is eBid Most Suited To?\n\neBid is for you if you don't want to pay a high commission on your sales (as you have to on eBay),\n\nFor those wanting to try their luck on an alternative (but similar) network\n\nThere's extra potential here if you know a thing or two about generating your own traffic\n\nHow to Succeed with eBid\n\nIf you promote your listings effectively through social media or forums, this is a great alternative to eBay\n\nSome more work may be required to get your store off the ground, due to the overall lower traffic volume compared to eBay\n\nSome top selling categories are:\n\nDVDs\n\nCraft supplies\n\nBooks\n\nToys\n\n21. Rakuten\n\nRakuten: The “Amazon of Japan”\n\nRakuten (formerly buy.com) is considered the “Amazon of Japan”. Now, Japan’s may not be the first country that comes to mind when you think of eCommerce, but get this: Japan’s population is more than 125 million, and more than 90% of Japan’s internet users are registered on Rakuten. That’s a big market.\n\nOne benefit of Rakuten is that you’re not competing with the website itself. Unlike Amazon, which sells dozens of its own brands on its website, Rakuten does not compete with its sellers. You also have more power to customize your store within the platform – something that other major eCommerce websites don’t allow.\n\nThere are already some big-name brands like Dell, Lenovo, Office Depot, Airweave, and Dyason that use Rakuten.\n\nHow Rakuten compares directly to eBay\n\nRakuten is more like Amazon than eBay – it’s a more traditional online retail website, not an auction platform.\n\nRakuten gives merchants more flexibility to build their brand within the platform\n\nYou can design your store\n\nCustomize products\n\nPublish blog content\n\nRakuten allows more flexibility for interacting with customers, including pricing, marketing, and promotions. It encourages tailor-made experiences.\n\nRakuten has expanded to at least 29 countries, including the US, and is planning to serve more countries in the coming years.\n\nFees are a bit higher than eBay’s: $39 / month seller fee, a $0.99 listing fee per item, plus 8%-20% commission on sales\n\nIt has excellent seller tools and support.\n\nWho is Rakuten best suited to?\n\nBest suited to people sick of the intense competition on eBay and Amazon, looking for a different entry point to the world of eCommerce\n\nEspecially good for people with experience doing business in Japan, or anyone wanting to break into the Eastern market\n\nWhile it is now an international marketplace, Rakuten hasn’t quite got the same reach outside Japan as other marketplaces\n\nHow to succeed on Rakuten\n\nChoose a niche product with sufficient demand and not too much competition\n\nUtilize the 20,000 characters available to write high-converting product descriptions,\n\nMake the most of the opportunity to be creative with your copy and highlight the unique benefits of your products.\n\nYou can add up to 20 shipping options on Rakuten – The more flexible you can be with shipping, the more likely you are to make sales.\n\n22. Newegg\n\nNewegg: A Leading Tech e-Retailer\n\nNewegg is an online marketplace that claims to be the “#1 marketplace for everything tech”. That means electronics, computers and parts, entertainment, smart home and gaming products. Sellers can list products on the marketplace, which reaches up to 42M customers. Newegg is based in California and has distribution facilities across North America and Canada. It has a global reach into more than 50 countries.\n\nHow Newegg compares directly to eBay\n\nMore restricted in terms of what products you can sell – Newegg is solely for tech products.\n\nHOWEVER, this means a more clearly defined audience and potential customer-base.\n\nNewegg offers a fulfillment service - Shipped By Newegg (SBN) - similar to Amazon’s FBA. eBay doesn’t do fulfillment.\n\nNewegg provides account managers who can help you set up your business and guide you along the journey.\n\nNewegg offers tiered membership options: Free, $29.95 / month, and $99.95 / month. The more you pay, the more support, tools, flexibility and listings you get.\n\nThey take a commission of between 8% and 15%\n\nWho is Newegg best suited to?\n\nBest for anyone selling tech products, particularly those operating in the US and Canada markets\n\nNewegg’s audience is mainly men aged from 18 to 35, so if that’s your target market, Newegg could be a good option for you.\n\nHow to succeed on Newegg\n\nSimply listing your items and crossing your fingers isn’t going to cut it on Newegg. You need to follow Newegg’s SEO guide to drive more traffic to your listings.\n\nNewegg recommends taking advantage of its promotional tools, such as a daily deal emails and various seller programs.\n\nMake sure you’re not listing any prohibited items\n\nProvide excellent customer service\n\n23. eCrater\n\neCrater: The “100% free” online marketplace\n\nThe main appeal of eCrater is that it’s free to set up a store – it even has templates you can use to easily create an attractive store. It’s also said to be easy to import your listings from eBay, which is good if you’re looking to transition entirely. There’s not a lot of information on eCrater online, but supposedly there are at least 65,000 active stores on the site. The number of customers and the amount of traffic pales in comparison to the larger eCommerce platforms, so it’s probably best used as a complementary marketplace, rather than one that you solely rely on to run your business.\n\nHow eCrater compares directly to eBay\n\nIt’s 100% free to open and run a store on eCrater. However, if eCrater brings you a sale, it takes between 2.9% and 12.9% of the total. You keep 100% of the sales that you bring to your store through your own SEO and marketing efforts.\n\nAround 1.4M monthly visitors, as opposed to eBay’s 109M\n\neCrater provides online store templates that help you to get set up quickly.\n\nYou can customize your store to include your branding.\n\nWho is eCrater best suited to?\n\nA good option for someone who’s totally over eBay, but it looking at using another marketplace, such as Amazon or Etsy, as their main platform\n\nIn our opinion, eCrater doesn’t quite have the numbers to be viable as your sole marketplace, but it could make for an excellent, low-risk and low-cost complementary option.\n\nHow to succeed on eCrater\n\nInvest heavily in your store’s SEO and marketing\n\nIt’s up to you to drive traffic to your store, almost as though it’s your very own site.\n\n24. Ruby Lane\n\nRuby Lane: The Marketplace for “Collecting Enthusiasts”\n\nRuby Lane is a legitimate alternative to selling on eBay. It’s been designed to bring buyers and sellers of antiques, art, vintage collectibles and jewelry together – similar to marketplaces like Etsy and Bonanza. Ruby Lane has 1.1 million unique visitors per month, which is impressive for a niche marketplace. A majority of users are located in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and Germany, but it has global reach.\n\n85% of users are women aged over 40 and almost all describe themselves as a “collecting enthusiast”, so if that’s your target market Ruby Lane might be a great option. It seems to attract more purposeful, educated buyers who might be willing to spend more money than those who are scouring eBay for bargains.\n\nHow Ruby Lane compares directly with eBay\n\nRuby Lane is a fixed-price marketplace and does not provide for auctions.\n\nIt’s much more niche than eBay, focussing only on antiques, art, collectibles and jewelry. That means visitors to your store are more highly targeted.\n\n$25 monthly fee which is refunded if you list 15 products that month\n\nCommission of 9.9% on sales, capped at $250\n\nThere’s greater quality control on Ruby Lane and sellers are vetted.\n\nWho is Ruby Lane best suited to?\n\nRuby Lane is best for savvy sellers in the antique, collectibles, art and jewelry markets\n\nSellers with target audience of women over 40\n\nHow to succeed on Ruby Lane\n\nWriting high-converting, accurate descriptions, quality photography, excellent customer service, strategic marketing\n\nBe aware your audience is going to be more educated than most, so choose your products carefully and be honest in your product descriptions\n\nMake sure your products meet all of Ruby Lane’s guidelines as they will be vetted.\n\nRuby Lane provides a great guide to selling successfully on its website.\n\n25. Your Online Store\n\nYour Online Store: The No-Competition Option\n\nSelling on your very own website really is the ultimate option if you want to increase your profits and build a business that will become a long-term asset. If this appeals to you but you have no idea how to get started, don't worry. There's an easy way, which I'll mention a bit further down.\n\nWhen selling from your own online store, you have to establish your own traffic, which can make it a little slower to get started than selling in a bigger marketplace. But once you're up and running, you don't have to compete with anyone else and your sales are all your own.\n\nWith this option, you can build up your own brand, rather than eBay's or Amazon's. When you sell on those platforms, who's really making the sale? They're spreading their brand, not yours. People say \"I got it on eBay,\" or \"I got it on Amazon,\" with no mention of the seller's name! It's ultimately you contributing to their marketplaces and their sales. Why not put that effort into yourself instead?\n\nHow Selling on Your Own Site Directly Compares to eBay\n\nYou're building your own brand.\n\nYou have full control over payment options, your brand, and store design\n\nYou're not competing with any other sellers on the same platform, which means you don't lose sales to others\n\nYour prices aren’t driven down by competition, which makes way for larger profit margins.\n\nWho is Best Suited to Owning Their Own Store?\n\nHonestly? Pretty much anyone can get their own website and make a profit.\n\nSetting up your own store isn't nearly as hard as it used to be, and with a little time and effort, you can sell exactly what you want to, and how you want to.\n\nYou can learn about the pros and cons of owning your own website here, and decide for yourself if it's something you'd like to pursue.\n\nHow to Succeed with Your Online Store\n\nYour main goal when starting out is to get traffic to your site to encourage sales\n\nThere are a couple of great lessons readily available to help you with this:\n\nGet Buyers to Your Store\n\n4 Ways to Advertise Your Store.\n\nThere's also a community forum where you can ask questions and get advice\n\n26. Niche-Specific Sites\n\nNiche-Specific Sites: Smaller Markets but Highly Targeted\n\nNiche-specific websites are marketplaces where people only sell one type of product. So rather than the larger category-based marketplaces like eBay or Amazon, these sites hone in on one of those options and specialize in only that.\n\nFor example, if you were specifically interested in selling clothing, you might consider selling on a site like Poshmark. Or if you wanted to sell gear for the outdoors, you might try selling on GearTrade. Heck, if you were in the car market, why not try Cardaddy?\n\nHow Niche-Specific Sites Directly Compare to eBay\n\nMuch smaller networks with less traffic than eBay.\n\nHighly targeted to buyers of that niche.\n\nYou don't have to compete with other categories for attention.\n\nThese sites are less obvious options, so some of your competition won't be here.\n\nWho is Best Suited to Selling on Niche-Specific Sites?\n\nSuitable for sellers passionate about a specific niche\n\nSellers who bulk-order a small range of items will also do well here\n\nThis will allow you to really focus on one market, and get to know the selling techniques that work best with that niche's buyer-audience.\n\nHow to Succeed with Niche-Specific Sites\n\nZero in on the type of product you'd like to sell and determine how much demand there is, e.g. do a keyword search with tools like the Keyword Research Module in AffiloTools.\n\nSimply type in the name of the product or niche that you're interested in selling, and look at the monthly search volumes. This will show you how many people are searching for words or phrases to do with that topic, which is a strong indication of how much interest there is. If you're tossing up a few options, then try each one out to see which ones generally have more searches.\n\nOnce you have a strong idea of what you'd like to sell, search Google for \"Places to sell [product type].\"\n\nLook for marketplaces that cater to your specific niche\n\nBe sure to read about other sellers’ reviews first\n\nIf these sites come across as genuine and promising, give them a go!\n\nFinally, you need to find trusted suppliers with the best products to sell on these networks.\n\nSome niches you could try:\n\nFashionable and affordable everyday wear (dresses, tops, pants/jeans, skirts, accessories, etc.)\n\nWomen's clothing and apparel (dresses, tops, bottoms, active wear, etc.)\n\nStylish/sophisticated women's wear (Contemporary and casual dresses, suits, and evening wear, etc.)\n\nA huge supply of liquidated or surplus clothing stock (Women's apparel, dresses, accessories, etc.)\n\nSwimwear (Bikinis, swimsuits, hats, cover-up dresses)\n\nPlus-sized clothing\n\nOr get something extra with styles from…\n\nThe UK\n\nBali\n\nTurkey\n\nThese are just some examples of the trusted suppliers you can access in the SaleHoo Directory.\n\nFAQs\n\neBay is like a gigantic online marketplace where you can buy, sell, and discover all sorts of treasures.

It's all about finding the right fit for your unique products and business goals!\n\nShipping options on alternative platforms often provide a range of choices similar to those on eBay. Most platforms offer standard and expedited shipping, international shipping, and the option for sellers to provide free shipping to attract more customers. Like eBay, these platforms allow sellers to choose from various carriers and may offer shipping label generation tools. Additionally, shipping discounts and fulfillment services may be available to streamline the process. It's important to note that shipping options can vary regionally, so sellers should consider their target markets and select the platform that aligns best with their shipping needs.
