It was the duty of the assessors of the townships, boroughs, and wards to conduct a semi-annual recording of such deaths on a preprinted form (see example). This law did not affect cities where a system for the registration of deaths had already been established.\n\nThe source of the information for each death is shown by the document number assigned by Allegheny County. (Index in Members Only)\n\nDocument numbers are provided for each entry with the exception of a few surnames.\n\nMany of the ledger pages were torn and contained missing pieces. Abstractors working on this project made every effort to ascertain the name of the deceased, year of death, and place of death, but in some cases it was impossible. These entries are listed at the end of the book. Questionable entries are contained within brackets [ ].\n\nMost of the original registrations include the name of the deceased, color, sex, age, marital status, place of birth, occupation, date of death, place of death, the cause of death, duration of last sickness, place of internment, and date of internment. The names of the father and mother are provided (in most cases) if the deceased was a minor. In cases where the surname of the child was not provided, the surname of the parents was used, followed by the notation (P).\n\nRequest a Copy: One name/entry per form\n\nMembers can view the complete Index for these registrations in the Members Only module on the website.\n\nDownload and Complete the WPGS Research Services Order Form\n\nDownload and Complete the WPGS Allegheny County Death Registration Form\n\nPay with PayPal through our online store, or with a personal check to WPGS at our address; 4400 Forbes Ave. Pittsburgh, Pa. 15213\n\nReturn the above forms to us at research@wpgs.org or through the USPS to our address above.\n\nCompiled in 1936 and 1937 by the Works Project Administration, the WPA Home Survey Project provides valuable information on certain properties in Allegheny County, which were in existence at that time.
