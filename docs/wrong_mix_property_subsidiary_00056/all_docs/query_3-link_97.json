        "text": "In astrology, the eighth house is the house of the zodiac sign of Scorpio and planet Pluto. It is viewed as the house of sex, taboos, death, resurrection and other people’s possessions. We can infer from these general fields that it also rules legacies, heritages, and wills. Likewise, the eighth house is one of the entryways towards the spiritual world and is generally associated with the occult and magic.\n\nThe eighth house can be considered one of the best instructors when it comes to teaching us about life and it’s meaning. It is the domain of transformative encounters.\n\nThe 8th House Astrology Summary\n\nZodiac Sign: Scorpio\n\nRuling Planet: Pluto\n\nOther People's Money\n\nSpouse's Money\n\nInheritances\n\nDeath\n\nSexuality\n\nTransformation\n\nOccult\n\nThings we must leave behind\n\nThe 8th House Rules Other People's Money\n\nThe house is in charge of issues concerning duties and obligations, as these are additionally under the class of money that belongs to others. Borrowed money and even money given to us by the government are likewise an eighth house issue, and benefic planets situated in the eighth house may mean that one has an easier time getting credit and loans. Hard aspects with so called malefics, however, make paying debt very troublesome and can make debt quite an obstacle.\n\nThe 8th House Rules Finances of Our Life Partner\n\nThe eighth house also tends to rule the assets of our life partner / wife / husband, and reviewing the planets placed inside can demonstrate the monetary circumstance of the partner that you choose. Legacies are to be seen here as well, both material and otherworldly. The eighth house indicates what we get when other individuals pass away. Sometimes, the monetary gifts that we get do not have to do always mean the death of another individual, but it can rather instead of a transformation and a rebirth. Someone can choose to surrender their material possessions, and that can mean a gift to someone else.\n\nThe 8th House Rules Death\n\nThe eighth house is the darkest area of one’s natal chart, as it rules death. It can show the way one will pass away, or even close encounters with death that the individual will experience in one’s life. The eighth house can show the deaths of other people that are close to you, near-death encounters. If you’re looking toward your eighth house worried about death, we would encourage you not to do so! Death is not something that is literal, but can also be figurative. For the most part, the eighth house alludes to symbolical endings. A person with certain planets in the eighth house could be artistically inclined to death, or perhaps drawn towards some kind of dark style.\n\nThe 8th House Rules the Occult and Magic\n\nThe eighth house in astrology also happens to be the house of the occult. It is an immediate door to alternate universes, the place of mystery and truth. The areas of the house closer to the ninth house are representative of an individual’s curiosity about life and its meaning. That area of the diagram is rules the hidden answers concerning why we exist, why we were born, why we pass away. It is in this same area of the chart where the ninth house finds its origins and foundations. The ninth house is in charge of wisdom and higher learning. Therefore it is only natural that this kind of wisdom and knowledge come from the questions that we pose here in the eighth house. That is the reason that the eighth house in astrology is the key for all intelligence; it is the wellspring of the questions that we ask about the world and about ourselves.\n\nThe 8th House Rules Sexuality\n\nSex is an act that is intrinsically spiritual, so long as we don’t consider it when it is something that is done for fun and entertainment. In its purest sense - sex is the opposite of death; it is the source and origin of life. It is the consequence of a deep bond between two spirits and as such it borders on being spiritual. The eighth house rules precisely that kind of sex; sex as an instrument for entering the higher planes and transcending one’s individual existence. The climax is a recreation of death, and numerous societies in reality call it “the little death”. Spiritually involved sex is a symbolic activity, and when it is experienced alongside love, can bring the self to new heights.\n\nThe eighth house in astrology is an immediate doorway to collective wisdom, similar to the twelfth house. The distinction between these doors is that the eighth can be entered intentionally through the actions of the individual, while the passage through the twelfth house is less controlled; the entryway lays in the individual’s intuition and is more hard to accomplish.\n\nThe 8th House Rules That Which We Must Let Go\n\nThe eighth house also connotes that in our lives that one must release and forfeit, keeping in mind the end goal to transform oneself and advance towards one’s greatest potential. Leaving something behind is usually accompanied by torment and grief, yet it is important to give things a chance to move on with the goal that we advance to something new. Spiritual development through this eighth house is gotten by things we let go for others. Even though it feels like a painful goodbye at first, the eighth house gives us back the energy we relinquished, but changed.\n\nThe 8th House Rules Inheritances\n\nAs specified earlier, the eighth house also rules inheritances and the assets of others; most circumstances those endowments are karmic. These inheritances can come from this life or a past one and ought to be viewed as the universe’s attempt to create balance. Be careful however; the eighth house does not just bring gifts, it likewise reclaims. Negative karma that we have built up will be paid back through this house, and the more we cling to money and material things, the more torment we will get when we should instead release them.\n\nThe 8th House of Transformation - Astrology Infographic and Cheat Sheet"
