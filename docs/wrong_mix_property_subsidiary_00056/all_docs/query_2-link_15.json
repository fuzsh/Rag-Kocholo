        "text": "There are steps you can take if you bought something by credit card, debit card, charge card or through PayPal. You can ask for a refund if you:\n\ndidn't get what you paid for\n\ngot something faulty or broken\n\ngot something that's different to how it was described\n\nIt's usually best to try to contact the trader. If you can't contact them or they won't help, ask your card provider or PayPal to help.\n\nIf the trader has a complaints procedure, you should follow it when you contact them. You can check if the trader has a complaints procedure on their website\n\nIt’s best to email or write to the trader - you can use a template letter. Keep a copy of anything you send, in case you need to check it later.\n\nIf you can't contact the trader or they won't help, you can then ask your card provider or PayPal.\n\nIf you paid through a Buy Now Pay Later provider, you should check their website to see if they can help.\n\nCheck the best way to get your money back\n\nIf you paid through a Buy Now Pay Later provider or using money from your PayPal account, you should open a dispute on your provider's website.\n\nIf you open a dispute on the PayPal website you have 180 days from when you paid to open a dispute – this is about 6 months.\n\nIf you paid with a credit card, you should ask for your money back using Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act – as long as you paid more than £100 and no more than £30,000.\n\nThe limits are for a single item you want to get a refund for, not the whole order. You can't usually use Section 75 if you:\n\ndidn't buy directly from the trader - for example if you bought from eBay\n\npaid through a Buy Now Pay Later provider\n\nYou should ask for your money back using 'chargeback' if you:\n\npaid with a debit card or charge card\n\npaid with a credit card and you can't use Section 75\n\nIf you paid through Buy Now Pay Later, you can still ask for chargeback but your credit or debit card provider might not agree to do it.\n\nIf you can’t get through to the retailer, you should check the terms and conditions of your Buy Now Pay Later provider to see if they can help.\n\nExample\n\nOlga bought a mobile phone and some headphones using her credit card.\n\nThe phone cost £80, the headphones cost £20 and the delivery charge was £5 – so the total cost was £105. None of the items arrived.\n\nShe can't use Section 75. Although she paid £105, no single item cost more than £100. Olga should ask to use chargeback.\n\nMaking a Section 75 claim\n\nTell your card provider you want to make a Section 75 claim. Your card provider is the company that sends you your statements. You can find their contact details on their website. It's best to ask in writing.\n\nIf you have a joint credit card, the main card holder should contact the card provider.\n\nWhen you write to them, you should ask for:\n\nthe full amount you paid, or the cost of repairing the item if it's faulty\n\nmoney to make up for poor quality, or for the trader misleading you\n\nthe cost of repairing any damage caused by a faulty item or a service\n\nExample\n\nD'Angelo bought a faulty washing machine and it damaged his floor.\n\nHe can get money to repair his floor as well as money to repair or replace the washing machine.\n\nYou can use our template letter.\n\nIf you're successful, your card provider will refund the money to your credit card.\n\nMaking a chargeback claim\n\nTell your card provider you want to make a chargeback claim. Your card provider is the company that sends you your statements. You can find their contact details on their website. It's best to ask in writing.\n\nYour card provider might call chargeback something else, for example 'disputed transactions'. If you ask for chargeback they will know what you mean.\n\nWhen you contact them, you should ask for either:\n\nthe amount you paid on this card - you won't get anything you paid by any other card or payment method\n\nmoney to make up for the problem – less than the full amount you paid\n\nExample\n\nCassandra bought a dress and a t-shirt using her debit card.\n\nThe dress cost £90, the t-shirt cost £30 and the delivery charge was £5 - so the total cost was £125. Cassandra received the dress but didn't get the t-shirt, and the trader won't reply to her email.\n\nShe can ask to use chargeback to get back the £30 she paid for the t-shirt.\n\nExample\n\nHercules bought a faulty washing machine for £250.\n\nHe paid £50 deposit by card and £200 by cash.\n\nHe can ask to use chargeback to get back the £50 he paid by card.\n\nIf he bought the washing machine with a credit card, he could instead try using Section 75 - he would probably get back more money.\n\nIf you’re successful, your card provider will refund the money to either your card or bank account.\n\nThe trader can challenge your refund, even if you've already had the money back. Your card provider will contact you if there's a challenge. If you can, it's a good idea to keep the money for a few weeks just in case their challenge is successful.\n\nIf your claim isn’t successful, you can ask your card provider if they used the ‘appeals process’.\n\nIf your claim isn’t successful\n\nIf you try to use Section 75 and you don't get your money back, you can ask the Financial Ombudsman Service to look at your case. You still might not get your money back.\n\nIf you try to use chargeback and you don't get your money back, you can ask your card provider why. If they say they've appealed to the trader’s bank and the appeal failed, there's nothing else you can do. If they say they won't appeal to the trader’s bank, you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThe Financial Ombudsman Service is independent. They’ll examine your case from both sides to reach a decision they think is fair. You still might not get your money back.\n\nYou can find out how to use the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nIf you don’t agree with the Financial Ombudsman’s decision\n\nYou might be able to ask an 'alternative dispute resolution' (ADR) scheme to help.\n\nYou can check if the trader is a member of an ADR scheme - or you can ask them. If they're not a member of an ADR scheme, ask if they're willing to use one.\n\nAs a charity, we rely on your support to help millions of people solve their problems each year.
