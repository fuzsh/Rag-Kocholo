Today, the company has grown beyond payments to offer a suite of financial services for individuals and businesses.\n\nBelow, you'll learn who started PayPal, who owns the company today, and how you can invest in this fintech stock.\n\nOwnership history\n\nWho is the owner of PayPal?\n\nPayPal is a public company owned by its shareholders. That fact isn't nearly as interesting as the ownership history of PayPal -- a history that includes cameos by Elon Musk and Max Levchin, who's now the CEO of a different fintech stock, Affirm (AFRM -0.98%).\n\nFirst, let's provide the context. What is fintech? Fintech, short for financial technology, describes software, hardware, and related technologies that streamline or digitize financial services. This includes applications for digital payments, cryptocurrencies, mobile banking, and investing. Robo-advising algorithms and buy now, pay later offerings are also under the umbrella of fintech.\n\nPayPal, Coinbase (COIN -2.84%), Block (SQ -1.99%), Visa (V -1.09%), and Robinhood (HOOD -2.35%) are all popular fintech stocks.\n\nLong before Tesla (TSLA -2.04%) and Twitter, Musk founded a financial services website called X.com. It was 1999, and Musk's vision involved easy digital payments for internet transactions. At the same time, Peter Thiel, Luke Nosek, and Levchin were working to a similar end in their startup, Confinity.\n\nX.com and Confinity would join forces to build a larger, stronger entity. Musk remained involved briefly but was ousted before the end of 2000. In 2021, Confinity changed its name to PayPal. It went public on the Nasdaq stock exchange in February 2002, rising 50% on its first trading day.\n\nPayPal did not remain public for long. A few months after its initial public offering (IPO), eBay (EBAY -1.24%) bought the company outright for $1.5 billion and delisted it from the Nasdaq. At the time, some 60% of PayPal's revenue came from eBay transactions. The partnership allowed the two teams to work more closely to streamline the online checkout experience.\n\nIn the years that followed, PayPal expanded its service set, acquired Venmo, and ultimately outgrew eBay. PayPal split away from the online retailer and became a public entity for the second time in 2015.\n\nLargest shareholders\n\nWho are the largest shareholders?\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires public company insiders and beneficial owners to disclose their share positions. Insiders are usually company executives who are privy to corporate details before they become public knowledge. Beneficial owners hold more than 5% of a class of stock.\n\nAccording to SEC filings, the largest insiders and beneficial owners of PayPal include the following.\n\nPierre M. Omidyar is the founder of eBay. In 2018, he reported owning 58 million shares of PayPal. Based on PayPal's current outstanding share count, that amounted to a 5.2% ownership stake in early 2024.

Schulman was CEO of PayPal from 2015 until he retired at the end of 2023. As of his last filing in December 2023, Schulman owned 597,883 PayPal shares.
