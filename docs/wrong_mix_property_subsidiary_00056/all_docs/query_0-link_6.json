        "text": "In the early days of eBay I sold a lot of items to US collectors. The rules were still friendly to collectors, they did not freak out when they saw a swastika, and to be honest: US collectors paid top dollar, which helped me a lot to expand my collection. Paypal did not exist and payments were done by check, Western Union or cash. And eBay was fun! There was at least one death notices I always regretted selling. I got a great price, and I was very happy with that, but... Guess you know the feeling.\n\nSo I was very happy when another one popped up after so many years, and I bought it instantly.\n\nTranslation of the text is about like this:\n\nDuring a night attack by the Bolsheviks\n\nfell on the command post on\n\nMarch 1, 1943 in Terny at the Orel River,\n\nsouth of Kharkov, my dear, faithful\n\nSon, our brave brother\n\nSS squad leader, Josef Wetzel,\n\nborn September 3, 1914\n\nin Gundelfingen.\n\nHis company commander writes:'Josef\n\nwas one of my best and bravest,\n\nhe fought like a lion and took\n\nmany opponents with him, to their deaths.\n\nThe war is hard, we want to be harder.\n\nWe SS men have the honor to belong to a troop in which you are not\n\nto live long and we are proud on that.'\n\nNot quite comforting for the mother I guess.\n\nBei einem Nachtangriff der Bolschewisten\n\nauf den Gefechtsstand fiel am\n\n1.März 1943 in Terny am Orel-Fluß\n\nsüdw. Charkow mein lieber, treubesorgter\n\nSohn, unser tapferer Bruder\n\nSS Rottenführer Josef Wetzel\n\ngeboren am 3. September 1914\n\nin Gundelfingen.\n\nSein Kompanieführer schreibt:, , Josef\n\nwareiner meiner Besten u. Tapfersten,\n\ner kämpfte wie ein Löwe und nahm\n\nviele Gegner mit in den Tod.\n\nDerKriegisthart,wirwollenhärter sein.\n\nWir SS-Männer haben die Ehre, einer\n\nTruppe anzugehören, in der man nicht\n\nlange zu leben pflegt und wir sind\n\nstolz darauf.‘\n\nClick to enlarge the picture\n\n2./Kompanie Gebirgsjäger Regiment 100 - Alois (Frater Alan) Hötschl, Kapuziner Kleriker Novize (Brother Alan Hötschl, Capuchin Cleric Novice).\n\nName- Alois Hötschl\n\nRank: Jäger\n\nBirth Date: 23 April 1919\n\nBirth Place: Kelheim Ndby\n\nMilitary Unit: 2./Kompanie Gebirgsjäger Regiment 100\n\nDeath Date: 26 May 1940\n\nDeath Place: Hauptverbandplatz Sanatorium St Gobain Frankreich\n\nHis cause of death is noted as Gefallen: Infanterie Geschuß, Bauchschuß (Killed in action: Infantry shot, abdomen shot).\n\nAlois Hötschl is buried in the military cemetery in Fort-de-Malmaison, France.\n\nEndgrablage: Block 4 Reihe 42 Grab 1680.\n\nThe below information is what I think Alois would have been involved in before he was drafted into the Wehrmacht -\n\nCapuchin Formation Program | Capuchin Franciscan Friars Australia.\n\nA little information about religious men in the Wehrmacht -\n\nAccording to the agreements of 1933 (article 27) only the religious who have an operational function in parishes and religious schools are exempted from military service, leaving everything in suspense. But in 1939 Germany agreed with the Vatican (in a position of strength with Catholic Poland already occupied) that all non -\"operative\" religious, including seminarians, friars, monks, etc were obliged to enlist in health units, also and often in first line units. There will be about one Division of German (and Austrian) Catholic clerics enrolled and of the 17,776 enlisted (from Lauren Falkner Rossi 'Wehramcht Priest') the fallen and missing amounted to 2403 (about 15%)."
