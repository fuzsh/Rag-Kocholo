        "text": "What is changing?\n\nPayPal Here was scheduled to be deprecated on April 3, 2023. To provide you with more time to transition and to ensure you avoid disruptions to your business, we have decided to allow you to continue to accept payments using PayPal Here devices until September 30, 2023. However, we recommend that you migrate to our latest POS solution, PayPal Zettle, to continue accepting payments, managing inventory, and tracking sales.\n\nWhat other PayPal products can I use?\n\nThe PayPal Zettle card reader and the PayPal Zettle Terminal are our digital commerce solutions for in-store payments, enabling small businesses to sell across in-store and online channels seamlessly. We believe that the hardware and related software provides a better customer experience. Customers may also wish to consider other PayPal Solutions such as Virtual Terminal and PayPal Invoicing, and we will be rolling out Tap to Pay solution in the U.S. soon.\n\nWill my PayPal account still be active?\n\nYes, your PayPal account will continue to work. There will be no impact on or change to your PayPal account when PayPal Here is discontinued, and you can continue to use your PayPal account as normal.\n\nWill the PayPal Here app and SDK still work?\n\nFrom September 30, 2023, all elements of the PayPal Here product, including devices, the app, and SDK, will no longer be supported in the US and will stop working.\n\nWhen will the devices stop working?\n\nPayPal Here devices and the PayPal Here app will cease working after September 30, 2023.\n\nDo I get a refund for the purchase of my PayPal Here device?\n\nIf you purchased a new PayPal Here device on or after February 1, 2022 (from February 1, 2022, until February 2, 2023), you will automatically receive a full refund of the device cost (US $79) in your PayPal account. If you no longer have an active PayPal account, you’ll receive an email from PayPal and Hyperwallet (a payout service within the PayPal group) with instructions for receiving your refund.\n\nWhat if I purchased a device before February 1, 2022, do I get a refund?\n\nOnly new devices purchased on or after February 1, 2022, will be automatically refunded.\n\nWhen will my device cost be refunded?\n\nIf the PayPal account you used to purchase PayPal Here is still active, you will receive your refund before the end of March 2023.\n\nCan I receive my refund to a nominated credit card or bank account instead of my PayPal account?\n\nAll refunds in the first instance will be made to the PayPal account that was used to purchase the device. If that account is closed, you will receive an email from PayPal and Hyperwallet (a payout service within the PayPal group) with instructions for receiving your refund.\n\nWhat if I didn’t get a refund?\n\nIf you purchased a new PayPal Here reader on or after February 1, 2022, directly from PayPal, you’ve received a refund before the end of March 2023. Refunds were made to the PayPal account that was used to purchase the device. Please check your PayPal account for a deposit/refund with a transaction note indicating that the transaction is for a PayPal reader refund.\n\nDo I need to return the PayPal Here device?\n\nNo, you do not need to return the devices. We advise that the device be disposed of responsibly using a local e-waste recycling option.\n\nIs there any sensitive data kept or stored in the device I should know when throwing it out?\n\nNo, the PayPal Here device does not store or retain any sensitive data or personal or payment information.\n\nWill the PayPal Here device work with other payment service providers?\n\nNo, you won’t be able to use the device in any way after September 30, 2023.\n\nHow will this affect my third-party point of sale (POS) application?\n\nPlease contact your point of sale (POS) software provider for alternative mobile POS terminal/card reader options.\n\nDo I need to return the devices to get my refund?\n\nNo, you don’t need to return the device. We advise that the device be disposed of responsibly using a local e-waste recycling option. Alternatively, you can send your device to the following address:\n\nPayPal, Inc.\n\nAttn: Hardware Operations\n\n2211 North First St.\n\nSan Jose, CA 95131\n\nIs there an impact on my (online) PayPal fees?\n\nThere will be no impact on your existing PayPal fees.\n\nWill I be able to download my sales activity after September 30, 2023?\n\nNo, the PayPal Here app will no longer be accessible after September 30, 2023. However, you’ll still be able to view your non-cash transaction activity by signing into your account at www.paypal.com.\n\nWhat if I need to refund a customer after September 30, 2023, for sale made using PayPal Here?\n\nYou will still be able to log into your account at paypal.com, review past transactions, and process a refund if necessary."
