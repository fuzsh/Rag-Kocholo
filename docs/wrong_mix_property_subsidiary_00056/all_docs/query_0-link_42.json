        "text": "I've left Okinawa for Taiwan, but the stories I heard and learned still stay with me. The violence of war on the land and the people. So similar to Guam, a great conflagration between empires built and fed on war takes place over an island and the people are trapped, caught in between. They get erased in the process in so many ways. Their lives are obliterated. Their memories wiped away. Their claims to the land vanish beneath bases. Even their stories are cast aside. When they fit the heroic and sacrificial narratives of the two great powers, they are brought forth as moments of patriotism, loyalty and power. But if they don't, they are forgotten.\n\nI finished reading the English translation of former Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota's book on the battle of Okinawa. Even though Ota himself is Okinawan and a big critic of the way both America and Japan have treated his people, his book still follows the narrative above, focuses on the tales of the two great empires locked in conflict.\n\nI've copied below one of the later chapters of the book, which reprints an AP story on the suicide of General Ushijima, the commander of the Japanese defense of Okinawa.\n\n**************\n\nThe Last Stand of General Ushijima\n\nGeneral Ushijima’s cook, who had been taken prisoner, told the story of the join suicide. After their deaths, the two officers were placed by their orderlies in graves at the base of the cliff.\n\nOn June 22 the cook was order to prepare an elaborate dinner for a special occasion, he told American officers. At this time the Mabuni Ridge was under terrific artillery and mortar bombardment and the United States flamethrowing tanks were climbing the steep coral slopes to burn out the undergrowth.\n\nThe general’s last meal was rice, canned meats, potatoes, fried fish cakes, salmon, bean soup, fresh cabbage, pineapples, tea and sake. The meal was served at 10 p.m. and at 11:30, the sentry at the cave entrance was dismissed by the general’s aide.\n\nThe guard was told that he was “no longer needed” and ordered to participate in the penetration attack against the American.\n\nAt 3 o’clock the following morning, the cook was preparing breakfast when the general’s orderly whispered that the general and his chief of staff were going to commit hara-kiri.\n\nForty minutes later both generals, dressed in full field uniform, wearing their medals, with boots highly polished, walked silently to a narrow ledge outside the cave mouth, followed by aides and members of their staff. The two generals talked in low tones as heavy blankets were spread on the ledge. Over the blankets was placed a white sheet, symbolizing death.\n\nGeneral Ushijima knelt on the sheet in the customary position. General Cho knelt on his left. Both faced the ocean. Because of the narrowness of the ledge, they could not face the north- the direction of the Imperial Palace – as in usual ceremonial procedure.\n\nGeneral Ushijima’s aide then approached with two knives, half of each blade wrapped in white cloth. He handed one to each general. His adjutant stood directly behind General Ushijima with drawn saber. Both generals opened their blouses to bare their abdomens.\n\nGeneral Ushijima thrust the knife deep and at the same instant the adjutant slashed him across the back of the neck, severing his spinal cord. A moment later General Cho died in the same manner.\n\nThe orderlies carried the bodies to the base of the cliff and scooped out shallow graves for them. Partly covered with rocks, the graves were discovered on June 25 by a patrol of the Third Regiment Seventh Division…\n\nGeneral Chow as wrapped in a white silk mattress cover on which his epitaph was written in his own hand-writing. It read: On the twenty-second day, twentieth year of the Showa era, I depart without regret, shame or obligation. Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Cho Isamu; age on departing, 51 years. At this time and place I hereby certify the foregoing.\n\nChamorro Public Service Post #15: Pues Adios, Esta Ki\n\nA lot of people end up visiting this blog because they are searching around the internet for lyrics to Chamorro songs. Over the years I’ve pasted a couple here and there, but haven’t really kept up with it as much as I should. I complain all the time about there not being enough internet presence for the Chamorro language and for Chamorro thoughts and so I feel bad when I inadvertently contribute to that absence. På’go, gaige yu’ gi i gima’ iyo-ku grandfather. Desde i ma’pos’ña na mes, kumakatre gui’. Kana’ hineart attack gui’, ya sumaga’ gui’ gi i espitåt para tres meses. Mana’huyong gi i ma’pos na mes, ya sumåsaga’ gui’ gi i gima’, lao ti ha hulat tumohgue sin ayuda. Kada na puengge måtto yu’ gi i gima’-ña para i tetno-hu pumulan gui’. Gi este na tiempo, tåya’ internet, pues siña hu usa este para bai hu fanhasso. Manhasso yu’ put i lina’la’-hu pat i guinife-hu. Buente i chinathinasso-ku siha lokkue’. Tonight, I was trying to figure out what would be the best song to share the lyrics\n\nTuleti\n\nI was racking my brain recently to determine what was the first ever Chamorro song that was featured in a motion picture. Noon Sunday was the first every motion picture to be filmed primarily on Guam, prior to that some minor filming had been done on Guam for World War II and Godzilla films but nothing substantial. Noon Sunday was not set in Guam, but it was the first film to feature extensively the island of Guam. Guam was the locale for a fictional Pacific island that was being taken over by a menacing Asian power. Almost all the speaking roles went to people from off-island (from the US or the Philippines), and Chamorros ended up playing most of the \"extra\" roles. As a result the film didn't feature any Chamorro music. You do find documentaries and television programs, all locally produced that feature Chamorro songs of at least Chamorros singing songs. Guam's History Through Songs, made by the late Carmen Santos is a perfect example of this. For those of you u\n\nChamoru Love Sayings\n\nA student from my Zoom Chamoru classes recently asked me for some suggestions for some Chamoru sayings or words of wisdom that she could use for a speech she had to give for a friend's wedding. I get this type of request pretty frequently and so over the years I have a number of lists of ways to say \"I Love You\" in Chamoru. For years that was one of the my most visited pages on this blog, a simple page that had more than a dozen different ways to say \"Hu Guaiya Hao\" ranging from the poetic and deep, to the silly and sexy. When I looked at many of those lists, I realized that the majority of the ways love was expressed, was indeed written in Chamoru, but not necessarily rooted in Chamoru. What I mean by this, is that alot of the sayings were simply translated from English or variants of ways that love would be expressed in English. For me, I am definitely in support of these sorts of things, I love having our language adapt and take on new forms, especially wh"
