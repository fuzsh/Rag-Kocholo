In fact their discord servers have bots that post info about the company whenever it's mentioned.\n\nHere is an example. If you order to make stickers that are Democrat focused they will send them to you cut in half. They still take your money. Artists end up having to get Paypal and CCs to do a chargeback.\n\nYou might be mistaken, this brand is a hot sauce company not stickers.\n\nElon Musk seems very invested in this election outcome more than past. Donating millions to Trump campaign every month being reported.\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nBesides tax breaks what is the gain he is trying to achieve.\n\nHe's trying to further court the right wing fash crowd into his cult/X userbase since he views anyone left of that as a lost cause now that everyone sensible has turned against him.\n\nYou might be mistaken, this brand is a hot sauce company not stickers.\n\nNo they're not.\n\nClick on the link in their bio. It's a dumb joke about their hot takes.\n\nSticker Mule | Custom printing that kicks ass\n\nThousands of people trust us to make kick ass stickers, labels, packaging & more.

Donating millions to Trump campaign every month being reported.\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nBesides tax breaks what is the gain he is trying to achieve.\n\nBased on his Twitter posts and likes. The conservative side are basically going to give him more freedom for his companies to run with less regulations across the board. Just imagine getting rid of government agencies that are doing research on atmospheric garbage from satellite decomissions and ozone depletion. Free reign\n\nElon Musk seems very invested in this election outcome more than past. Donating millions to Trump campaign every month being reported.\n\nWhy is that the case?\n\nBesides tax breaks what is the gain he is trying to achieve.\n\nZero regulations means he can't get in trouble for his rolling death trap cars. Plus he's a pretty obvious white supremacist and anti-trans bigot so the whole platform appeals to him.\n\nI'm generally up for pointing out how shit cops are, but this one's not really their fault. Not really a whole hell of a lot that can be done in that situation that doesn't end with the person on the ladder shot dead.\n\nI swear I'm not trying to be cheeky, but isn't that literally in the job description for being a LEO working a political rally? Like if you aren't ready to jump in front of a bullet what the fuck are you doing there?\n\nI'm generally up for pointing out how shit cops are, but this one's not really their fault. Not really a whole hell of a lot that can be done in that situation that doesn't end with the person on the ladder shot dead.\n\nThe police is saying no ladder and the police is hanging and fell and broke his lwg\n\nIt was a Butler Township police officer who encountered the gunman on the roof before the shooting. The officer was looking for the suspicious person when another officer hoisted him up so he could grab the edge of the roof, local officials said.\n\nButler Township Manager Tom Knights said the officer lost his grip and was not retreating when he fell 8 feet (2.4 meters) to the ground.\n\nHe was literally dangling from the edge of a building and took the defensive position he needed to at that time. He couldn't hold himself up,\" Knights said.\n\nThe officer, who has 10 years of experience in law enforcement, severely injured an ankle in the fall and was in a walking boot, Knights said.\n\nSnipers were inside the building where gunman attempted to assassinate Trump\n\nFrom CNN's Whitney Wild\n\nSnipers were stationed inside the building where a gunman climbed the roof and attempted to assassinate former President Donald Trump, a source familiar with the investigation tells CNN.\n\nThe source said the local sniper team hailed from the Butler County Emergency Services Unit.\n\nThe team, according to the source, was located on the second floor providing overwatch of the crowd at the rally.\n\nThis story continues to get more bizarre... a sniper team was perched indoors in the same exact building that the shooter was on the roof of.\n\nThis really has people showing their true colors at least. The StickerMule founder decided to spam every customer with a political message of support for Trump using the company email.\n\nView: https://x.com/stickermule/status/1812280776362168539\n\nposted this in the politics thread the other day. I have so many artist friends that would use them for massive sticker orders for freebies and stuff to include in orders. Now never using them again, and bashing them online to other artists. Hope it was worth it to them. Maybe they can corner the market on those Biden \"i did that\" stickers you see on gas pumps or whatever\n\nThis really has people showing their true colors at least.

Everything we have heard about this guy paints the picture you would expect to be honest.\n\nWhy would a Trump supporter, with maga signs in his yard, want Trump dead?\n\nbut i guess the signs could be from the family? but still some classmates described him as a conservative...i just dont understand anything here.\n\nWhy would a Trump supporter, with maga signs in his yard, want Trump dead?\n\nbut i guess the signs could be from the family? but still some classmates described him as a conservative...i just dont understand anything here.\n\nTrump has waffled on a lot of subjects the most hardcore MAGA folks support wholeheartedly as well as showing up in those Epstein files. Combine that with him courting the worst parts of the public and it's not that surprising some of his more unhinged fans fall out of love with him.\n\nWhy would a Trump supporter, with maga signs in his yard, want Trump dead?\n\nbut i guess the signs could be from the family? but still some classmates described him as a conservative...i just dont understand anything here.\n\nEverything so far is pointing toward this being an apolitical mass shooting. Trump just so happened to be a high profile target that gathered a bunch of other people for this guy to shoot at. He went after him to make a name for himself.\n\nIf the guy was willing to go on a shooting spree and likely get killed afterwards, then he probably stopped caring about politics (or anything, really) and therefore wouldn't care about shooting at someone he'd be politically aligned with.\n\nEverything so far is pointing toward this being an apolitical mass shooting.

A guy that broke inside and instead of a mass shooting he went for a public figure.\n\nAfter Trump shooting, his supporters still fiercely oppose gun reforms\n\nTheir presidential candidate had just narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, a bullet grazing his ear on Saturday from an AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon - a rifle frequently used by mass shooters in the United States.\n\nYet in interviews with 12 Donald Trump delegates at his Republican Party nominating convention in Milwaukee, none advocated for limits or bans on assault rifles, raising the legal age to buy a gun, or even more robust background checks.\n\nMost viewed even mild measures, such as expanded background checks, or raising the legal age to buy an assault weapon to 21, as infringements on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, which grants citizens the right to own guns.\n\nSteve Kramer, from Georgia, said it was a \"lie\" that expanded background checks would help.\n\n\"If you look at most of the killings, someone stole the gun, so background checks wouldn't matter,\" Kramer said.\n\nBetween 1966 and 2019, apart from school shooters who mainly stole their weapons from family members, most people who committed mass shooting had bought their weapons legally, according to data compiled by the National Institute of Justice, a research agency of the Department of Justice.\n\nObviously, he was a Biden Sleeper Agent, programmed by Biden himself to appear outwardly like a completely normal Trump-fearing Republican, until just the day he gets the exact secret trigger world to activate him, and assassinate President Trump. Never underestimate the Biden Crime Family™.\n\nWe've all fallen for Biden's feeble old man bit when it was actually a cover for his master plan all along. \"Put the Bulls-eye on Trump\" he whispered Jewishly while sipping from his Soros funded elixir of aborted fetus blood, his words traveling across the A.N.T.I.F.A. (Anti-Christ National Trans, Illegals, & Females Alliance) wireless network to the inner ear cartilage of Thomas Matthew Crook(ed Hillary)s. \"It's going to be a good day\", Biden murmurs as he trades places with his clone for the next shift.\n\nWhy would a Trump supporter, with maga signs in his yard, want Trump dead?\n\nbut i guess the signs could be from the family? but still some classmates described him as a conservative...i just dont understand anything here.\n\nAfter watching MAGA all these years I didn't even question the possibility that a MAGA follower would shoot at Trump at a MAGA rally. Some people in that crowd are very disturbed and armed. The reason may be varied but the notion just isn't surprising to me.\n\n.....Eh?\n\nVolume 213 of Golgo 13 that released on 07/06/2024\n\nSpecifically Ch.576 has...?????\n\nThe story of that chapter.\n\nUS president Trump is at a event with mascot Captain Alligator/crocodyle\n\nWhen a shooting happen\n\nAnd was recorded saying, \"Good thing it's Captain crocodyle that got shot<Not me>)\n\nIn order to bury that scene his supporter hired Duke Togo to do a fake shooting\n\nAnd have him say, Don't worry about me, protect the children as the plan\n\nAnd release that scene to cover the previous one, and he got re-elected\n\n.....Eh?\n\nVolume 213 of Golgo 13 that released on 07/06/2024\n\nSpecifically Ch.576 has...?????\n\nThe story of that chapter.\n\nUS president Trump is at a event with mascot Captain Alligator/crocodyle\n\nWhen a shooting happen\n\nAnd was recorded saying, \"Good thing it's Captain crocodyle that got shot<Not me>)\n\nIn order to bury that scene his supporter hired Golgo 13 to do a fake shooting\n\nAnd have him say, Don't worry about me, protect the children as the plan\n\nAnd release that scene to cover the previous one, and he got re-elected\n\nOH FUCK YOU, DUKE TOGO.\n\nAnd have him say, Don't worry about me, protect the children as the plan\n\nIn reality, none of them care about the children, no matter what the media tries to play to buy sympathy for the extreme right, and Trump can't even be bothered to call the deceased's family while they reject calls from Biden. Made time for golf tho\n\nOff-topic a bit, but it's somewhat alarming how quickly the FBI got into the shooter's phone. Two days and they were able to brute force their way into it. Not entirely surprising, I suppose, and I'd be willing to bet that if polled most people would be happy with that and say it was necessary, but just another reminder that our devices aren't nearly as secure as we sometimes like to think.\n\nOff-topic a bit, but it's somewhat alarming how quickly the FBI got into the shooter's phone.
