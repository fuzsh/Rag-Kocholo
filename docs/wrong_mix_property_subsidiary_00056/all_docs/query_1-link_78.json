        "text": "Breaking hearts and bank balances – organised criminals have defrauded West Australians out of at least $4.5million after starting relationships with victims online, according to figures compiled over the six months since August 2012.\n\nMost of us when asked for urgent assistance by a friend or family member would say yes and that’s the answer scammers are banking on when they target people in ‘help me’ scams.\n\nWow, it looks like you have hit the jackpot and have won one of the three prizes: Wrong! The “Super Prize” is actually a discount voucher worth $23 to purchase the “Miraculous Bark from the Tree of Makoo”.\n\nYour computer suddenly stops working and your screen is filled with a warning supposedly from the Australian Federal Police (AFP).

WA ScamNet warns that the only thing you are likely to be promoted to is a “jail inmate”.\n\nThis looks like another advance fee fraud email where scammers will ask you for money throughout the process for taxes or processing fees.

She claims she will send you a cheque for $39,000 plus the “Great Secret Wish Amplifier” called a “Divinor” and a magic necklace. All this for the “tiny sum” of $60. It does not take any magical powers to foresee you will not receive any money.\n\nTo participate, you need to follow a number of intricate steps. This still doesn’t mean you will win the prize though. In fact you actually only have a one in 125,000 chance of getting the money. So you are actually paying $33.49 to enter an overseas lottery!\n\nClairvoyant Angela Almera, from the Netherlands, is retiring and wants you to be the very last person she is ever going to help to become a winner. But when we did a search for her name on the Internet, the first item was a warning from the New Zealand Ministry of Consumer Affairs about her.\n\nAngele and Angelina may call themselves the “two angels of light”. But WA ScamNet refers to them as the “evil duo of disappointment” because that’s all you will get if you respond to this letter.\n\n“You are one of the 12 people whose vibrations match the secret” so says clairvoyant Angelique de Succes in a personally addressed letter. Hang on Angelique, what about the hundreds of other Western Australians you have sent the same letter to? Are they also part of the chosen 12? Angelique can reveal to you the “most important secret in the world”. Why pay $65 to Angelique when WA ScamNet holds the key to this secret – it’s a SCAM.\n\nClairvoyant Angelo Da Vinco wants to protect you from worldwide danger and disaster – at a price of $56.

Luckily the WA public are too wary to send money to a company in the UK on the basis of a tiny letter that doesn't even tell them what they'd be getting...!\n\nWhat the Awards Allocation Bureau should have said up front is that there is a one in a million chance of winning the cash prize of $10,000.00 (assuming it exists).\n\nThe black-hearted Blacktacos are at it again, this time trying to peddle Richard Von Struck’s “Guaranteed Winnings Method”. Read the fine print and it states you have only “won” the chance to enter a competition where the first prize is $30,000.\n\n\"You are the person declared a winner in our giant cheque for $15,000 game,\" the letter from Bureau Général d'allocation des Récompenses (BGAR) states.

Apparently it was refused because of “legislative reasons”. Is BIVR trying a different spin on the old “the cheque is in the mail” scam? Or are the scammers behind BIVR so contemptuous of their victims that they believe people will fall for any old nonsense?\n\nYour phone rings and what do you know – it’s another telemarketer. This time the person on the end of the line is from Baida Group of Hong Kong. And if you just answer their three question consumer survey you could win an mp4 player! It’s a way to hook you in and begin grooming you in order to steal your money.\n\nThe popular television program Seinfeld coined the expression “put it in the vault” meaning to keep something a secret.

If you receive an email call from someone purporting to be from your bank and requesting account and password details, do not respond. Immediately contact your bank. Do not use the telephone number the email has provided.\n\nYour phone rings and at the other end is a caller from an organisation which claims to have audited your bank account or tax file and found you’re entitled to a reimbursement. Dozens of consumers across metropolitan and regional Western Australia have been reporting these unsolicited calls to WA ScamNet in June and July of 2010. Unfortunately thousands of dollars have already been lost.\n\nThe bland email from Barcelo Travel seems innocuous enough, containing only a few short sentences offering a job with a big salary.

Think twice about this one.\n\nWestern Australian’s are being targeted with spam emails and links to a website offering a bitcoin trading software which promises to makes $2440 per day.

It preys on people’s vulnerabilities by promising riches beyond their dreams in return for a small amount, typically around $50.\n\nDear Blanche Calmette, clairvoyant When reading the future, did you predict that Western Australian consumers would send their letters from you to WA ScamNet? We think your letter is about developing a “sucker list” to sell to other mail order sharks. But you already knew that.\n\nScammers are circulating spam emails purporting to contain links to websites with information on the recent Boston explosions, but in fact contain links to malicious content that may infect and allow scammers remote access to your computer.\n\nWhile the passing of celebrities or other breaking news stories prompt most of us to turn on the TV, search the internet and text or call friends, scammers swing into action to take advantage of our thirst for information.\n\nSeeing the recent bushfires is horrifying for most of us and we just want to help somehow. But unfortunately scammers see it as an opportunity to impersonate charities, or create fake charities.\n\nHow do you spot a fake website? The reality is they can look really professional and may have copied official logos, high quality images and even stolen an ABN from a real business. One sign of a fake site can be a recent copyright date but scammers may also put an older copyright date to fool you.\n\nCAMSE have declared you a unique winner of $22,500. WA ScamNet suggests you are not unique in this instance because the scammers behind this ruse have sent countless unique people across the world the same cheque, with the same false promises.\n\nThe mysterious multimillionaire Mr X knows quite a bit about you, according to the C.I.D.P. letter. WA ScamNet does know the identity of Mr X and we are prepared to share it with you – at ABSOLUTELY NO COST.

It talks about monies which you are eligible for, not monies you have won.\n\nCash Alert LLC (CAL) claims time is running out for you to be a potential winner of $1,100,000. So how does it explain the fact that seventeen other companies are plugging the same scam, use the same terms and conditions, and have similar mailing addresses in Fort Langley, British Columbia, Canada?\n\nYou receive a letter with the bold headings “Urgent message from financial director “ and “Notice of intent to deliver cash”.

Not if it is illegal, you don’t!

Yes, your life would change if you had won $2,000,000. But that is not what you will get for your $20. All you will get is a report detailing free sweepstakes or competitions you might be eligible to enter.\n\nThe ‘Notice of Property Resolution’ from Cash/Asset Management Services says you are one of a limited number of international consumers in a cheque/merchandise incentive offer.

Like-harvesting, or like-farming as it is also called, is a scam perpetuated throughout Facebook and features bogus pages designed to do nothing more than “harvest” your likes.\n\nA fake online questionnaire claiming to be from popular chemists are doing the rounds. People receive a link to the survey, which may even appear to be sent by a friend or family member.\n\nAccording to Christie, you have been selected to be the recipient of “Special Grand Celestial File of Fortune and Good Luck called Good Fortune at the click of the fingers”.

It’s just a scam.\n\nColumbus-Partners Inc claims to be an online-to-offline money transfer service with headquarters in New York City.

Take Maria’s advice and the only thing you can be assured of is that you won’t see your money again\n\nA credit card scam can come in many forms. For example, scammers may use spyware or some other scam to obtain your credit card details. A scammer might steal or trick you into telling them your security code (the three or four digit code on your card) and then make purchases over the internet or the telephone. If they know your PIN, they could get cash advances from an ATM using a ‘cloned’ credit card (where your details have been copied onto the magnetic strip of another card).\n\nCrown Imperial Imports claims to have a large package waiting to be delivered to your door. It contains a 61-inch Sony big screen television; or a $2,741 bank cheque; or a Sharp microwave; or other items. All you have to do is pay the $24.95 “release fee”. You will probably end up with some junk jewellery worth far less than the $24.95 release fee you paid.\n\nCrown Imports, also known as Crown Imperial Imports, has been doing the rounds for years. They claim you are the recipient of one of the major items listed - from big TVs to cash, cameras, computers, and jewellery. Just send off your $30 or $40 release fee. But it's all a sham.

However consumers need to be alert to scammers who use it to try and deceive you.\n\nDrop4Sale is doing the rounds via email, targeting Australians and New Zealanders as the company claims to be hiring in both countries in a rapid global expansion.

Attending an expensive seminar or investing in the wrong kind of scheme can be costly mistakes.\n\nIf you reply to this email, the scammer will string you along with some story about needing money to pay off corrupt officials or to transfer the money out of the country.

The creation of an impression of being ‘official’ and legitimate is a standard trick of scammers.\n\nYou are one of four people Swiss Astro-numerologist Johann Christensen has chosen to pass on the secret of great wealth.

WA ScamNet can definitely say this is a scam and you are not the only one that has received this offer.\n\nAt WA ScamNet we didn’t need a crystal ball to know that we’d be naming and shaming another clairvoyant scam; even though we’ve issued warnings about 90 or so previously.

It’s a new version of the age-old puppy scam. Scammers advertise a puppy or kitten for sale in the classifieds either in newspapers or online, usually providing an email address as a contact point. The animal being advertised is often a popular breed and the asking price is lower than the market value. The seller requests that payment for a crate and shipping of the kitten or puppy be sent by wire transfer.

The emails use various names and logos to hook you in. Some emails copy legitimate government lottery logos to add legitimacy to the scam.\n\n“Not long ago, if you remember, you were experiencing a feeling of injustice or anger which overwhelmed you,” writes medium Louise Eridan. It’s a shame this is another work of pure fiction by the mail order sales company Blacktacos.\n\nMadame Arachnea's spider ensnares your winning lottery numbers - or you will be condemned to hell for ignoring the letter. Naturally, this psychic spider did not foretell how many of Madame Arachnea's letters would be sent to WA ScamNet. Or maybe the spider tricked her with its own web of deceit?\n\nMadame Soleil was a famous French astrologer but the clairvoyant Madame Soleil, who is currently writing to consumers offering 11 exceptional miracles, is not the real Madame Soleil .

He has won millions with his lucky Glistening Golden Coin. This is a very ham-fisted attempt to con you out of your money by trying to empathise with your circumstances while, at the same time, trying to illicit sympathy for the plight of the Smiths family. This so-called “battler-made-good” even lets you pay your $50 by credit card! How many people do you know have a credit card facility?\n\nMaria is a typical psychic scam who uses threats and the promises of money to get you to hand over your dollars.

Like we all don't get enough junk-mail already… If it looks too good to be true, it probably is…!\n\nMoney transfer schemes are the latest so-called “working from home” scams to hit our email inboxes. The schemes claim to offer you a commission simply for receiving money into your bank account and then transferring it out again. There are laws against money laundering. Is the money worth the risk of prosecution and a criminal record?\n\nThis pathetic letter is a load of codswallop! Why does she need to charge you money if she can use the formula to win up to $5 million herself? With $5 million, she could set up a real charity foundation and help the needy rather than scam money off people. The reason she is chasing you for money is that the formula doesn’t work!.” This is a typical psychic scam. Don’t waste your money on this rubbish!\n\n\"$1,000,000 VERIFIED, CONFIRMED, PROOF POSITIVE\", the letter from Monies Advisory proclaims in capital letters. Unfortunately, the only thing that will be in your hands is a cheap booklet detailing a list of sweepstakes and other competitions you might be eligible to enter. The total prize pool of the competitions is more than $1,000,000.\n\nThere’s a parcel addressed to you waiting for collection. It’s apparently filled with designer goods. All you have to do is pay the delivery costs.What you would receive for your money isn’t known, but it would be wise not to expect much.\n\nThey require a reservation fee from you of US$29.95 (approx $56 Australian) which actually buys you a piece of worthless junk jewellery and ensures whatever details you have provided them will be sent on to other offers...probably also scams.\n\nNAAC is no different. Despite the impression given that you have won big money, you have won nothing! You have to enter the competitions (which have a total prize pool of $768,000) to win anything. Ask yourself, why should you pay money to find out about competitions that you can enter for free?\n\nSo what have you won? From the fine print: \"The cash award eligibilities consist of the disbursement of various opportunities for fully vested eligibility to win over US$196,103.11 in cash awards.\" We don't know either.\n\nSimilar scam to the International Awards Treasury.

Nelchael claims he seldom proposes this type of intervention. Try telling that to the thousands of others who also received this mass mail-out. This is a typical psychic scam. None of our contributors have ever received a big lotto win after sending money off to a psychic scam. All they have received is useless trinkets.\n\nNet Direct Electronics claim you are a cash award recipient in the US$10,000 International Sweepstakes. So what are the chances you will get the US$10,000. No WA ScamNet contributors have ever reported receiving the grand prize. The best you can hope for is US$1.\n\nOn first reading, the personally addressed letter seems to proclaim that you are a winner of a major cash prize ($13,200 and upwards). Of course, you haven’t actually won the money, just the opportunity to enter a competition to win the money.\n\nWe can safely predict that the Dear Friends who send $20 to Nostradamus will not have $20. We further predict that they will get lots of mail saying that, for various fees, they can find out if they have already won prizes in overseas lotteries they have not entered. Just amazing! Funny how Nostradamus and his Oracles didn't predict how so many of their Dear Friends would react to a combination of fear and greed - by sending their special invitation to WA ScamNet.\n\nA fake parcel claim notification, to alert you to $48 worth of jewelry awaiting pick-up, has been turning up in mailboxes in Western Australia.

Funds can be remitted by a draft made payable to “NCS” or by credit card to a post office box.\n\nDo not be sucked in by the suggested urgency; a requirement for you to respond within 10 days. Also ignore claims there has been a special selection process declaring you as the ‘only’ winner. Truth is, the same letter has probably been sent to thousands of others and you’ll never receive any money in return. But at $30 back for every person who falls for it, you can work out what motivates OTEP, or whoever the senders really are.\n\nIf you want to join a Canadian Lottery syndicate, send $47.95 to Scarborough, Ontario. While you are at it, ask why literature from the\n\nOffice of Property Administration\n\ncreates the misleading impression that failing to respond means waiving your right to valuable property being held at their office.

Don’t let these fraudsters play games with you and your hard earned cash.\n\nIt is possible to buy almost anything over the internet these days. Unfortunately, scammers can use the anonymous nature of the internet to rip off unsuspecting shoppers. Scammers can pretend to be selling a product—often very cheaply—just so they can steal your credit card or bank account details. Similarly, they may take your money but send you a faulty or worthless product instead—or even nothing at all.\n\nWhether it’s a sponsored post in your social media feed or a pop up advertisement while you’re browsing the web, offers of ‘free trials’ or ‘samples’ are a common sight for internet users. WA ScamNet warns online consumers to be aware of the fine print when accepting a so called free trial.\n\nConsumer Protection has issued an alert after many West Australians desperate to get a loan have been duped by online loan scams.

This is an advance fee fraud also known as Nigerian scam.\n\nOverseas Subscribers Agents are ticket sellers for super lotteries such as Euromillions and USA Mega Jackpot.“Be advised that there are deceptive operations that have recently engaged in criminal activities that have misled and materially harmed numerous people, creating scepticism that affects legitimate operations such as OSA and others.”\n\nA WA consumer, who sent off their money to Carter Hammond and Pierce, received a cheap photocopied booklet listing web-based sweepstake and prize giveaways.

What seemed like the beginings of a dream relationship quickly turned into a nightmare, when over the course of a few months Pam lost over $100,000, and Romano disappeared forever.\n\nPat Griffin isn’t very original it seems. You see the illegal scheme he is trying to peddle to Western Australians is nearly identical to another bunch of schemers including Edward L Green, David Stein, Paul Collins and David Rhodes.\n\nFor years, the most common pyramid scheme investigated by Consumer Protection has been a chain letter called the \"Paul Collins letter.\" It says it's all perfectly legal. So why do they need made-up names and PO boxes? Sadly, many of the people who follow the instructions find that the only response they get is from a Consumer Protection Investigator. Instead of a $20 note there is a letter about a $20,000 fine.\n\nThe email states that you need to confirm your PayPal information by going directly to a website listed or to click on the link attached.This is a typical phishing email sent by fraudsters in an attempt to collect sensitive personal or financial information from you.\n\nPayment Facilitation Services may have US$279,238.00 waiting for you. That's the amount on the unsigned \"cheque.\" Just send a $26 documentation fee to Harold Wunderman. What's so hard about subtracting the fee and sending you the rest?\n\nThe most curious element is the fact that it uses the exact same return address as the Award Notification Service. So who is running these two offers out of the same post box...?\n\nPayment Reporting Systems would have you believe that you are eligible for cash payments worth $5,822,052.63. but has a return address shared by other similar scams - Shannon Airport House in Ireland. Payment Reporting Systems will provide a refund if you are not satisfied (and who wouldn’t be!) and a means of getting off their mailing list. Why not give it a go.\n\nYou open the letter and there is a fake cheque for US$10,000 with your name written on it. WA ScamNet contributors, who have participated in these types of promotions in the past, have received jewellery that is more at home on the shelves of a $2 Discount Shop then in jewellery shop.\n\nProperty buyers and sellers need to be suspicious of any email appearing to be from their real estate or settlement agent asking for a payment of money or advising of a change in bank account details. This could be the work of scammers.\n\nA phoney fraud alert is similar to a phishing scam. It can come in the form of an email or a phone call claiming to be from your bank or financial institution. The scammer will usually tell you that your credit card or account has been cancelled because it was involved in criminal activity, or because they suspect your card or details have been stolen. This is a trick to get you to given them your account details.\n\nDon’t confuse Power Lotto Online Promo Program with Western Australia’s own Lotterywest Powerball. Powerball is a legitimate lottery run by Lotterywest, which operates lotteries in Western Australia with profits going back to the community. Power Lotto Online Promo Program is an advance fee fraud scam with profits going straight into the scammers’ pockets!!!\n\nIt may seem like all your Christmases have come at once, receiving an overseas letter in the mail saying that you could inherit money from a businessman with the same last name as you.It is important that you do not contact Mr Martinez or send money. Don’t be the next victim\n\nWhy can't this \"sponsor\" simply advertise their \"offers and items\" to Western Australian consumers like yourselves the way the vast majority of legitimate traders do...? We'll ask them on your behalf...\n\nConsumers are receiving emails and letters claiming they have won money in the La Primitiva or Primitiva lottery, promotion or sweepstake. La Primitiva and El Gordo are legitimate Spanish lotteries, not sweepstakes, and are endorsed by government. But the letters and emails that consumers receive are fake and commonly known as advance fee frauds or Nigerian scams.\n\nUK law firm Robert W. Soon & Associates are delighted to inform you that you are a beneficiary of the estates of the late Princess Diana, the Princess of Wales. Princess Diana tragically died in a car crash in 1997. And eight years on, this law firm claims you are a beneficiary and you did not even know that you were related to royalty.\n\nTargeting the Commissioner for Consumer Protection Anne Driscoll for an internet scam may not seem like the brightest idea, but then scammers are not often accused of being smart or honest.\n\nAs usual the devil is in the detail. The terms and conditions begrudgingly reveal, There is \"no firm offer\"; and Only one final grand prize of $25,200 or a piece of valuable jewellery; The Grand Winner’s name, address, photo and voice can be used in advertising without compensation; and Reduction cheques (secondary winners) of $2,520 are valid exclusively for the purchase of an esoteric product called \"Centuries-Old Protection of the Grand Masters’.\n\nPrize Giveaway Inc claims to be an “authorised” referrer and can direct you to cash entities who can pay sweepstake prizes.You’ll probably find you are ineligible to enter some competitions. Some prize giveaways are run by legitimate retailers wanting to promote their business. Other competitions are conducted by direct marketing companies to get your personal information for mailing lists. Always ask yourself whether the prize is worth you being on yet another mailing list!\n\n“Here, Made-Out to You, is Your Completion Document regarding Payout of the Monies now underway in accordance with the Appointed Issuance dates. This is the same offer made by 17 other scams operating out of three PO Boxes in Fort Langley, BC, Canada.\n\nstay sharp. Don't fall into the trap of sending your hard earned cash in the hope that you will receive a new car or a massive cash payout just by solving a simple puzzle, and always remember: ...if it looks too good to be true, it probably is...!\n\nThe fine print reveals that all you will get for your hard earned cash is a report detailing competitions and lotteries you may be eligible to enter.This offer is not worth the paper it is printed on.\n\nPrize World Incorporated (PWI) believes you are such a “deserving individual” they want to give you a formal compendium “Gift of Honour”. This is the same offer made by 17 other scams operating out of three PO Boxes in Fort Langley, BC, Canada.\n\nwhy didn't \"Prize Administration and Payments\" in London simply deduct the $39.99 handling fee and send all our friends just $1,753.96?As usual, fine print on the back contradicts the impression given in headlines on the front. Your handling fee buys an entry into a sweepstakes where you have a one in 250,000 change of winning $1,793.95.\n\nWouldn’t you love to be able to influence whomever you wanted, to know what they were thinking and to control their actions? This is just another useless psychic scam run out of Switzerland. The only thing the Divinor Cross is likely to attract is more psychic scam letters.\n\nProfessor Poona is the sole holder of age-old secrets of the “Dream Dust for Money”. “Dream Dust of Money” – yeh, right! Try pure “bulldust”. All you are likely to get for your $81 is a packet of cheap silver glitter and a lifetime of other fake psychic scam letters from Switzerland.\n\nThe \"Self Employment Opportunity\" ad said \"Work from home processing emails. Earn up to $5,000 pm p/t.\" Sound too good to be true?\"Project 21\" is an email version of an old-fashioned envelope stuffing scam, promising high returns for little or no effort.\n\nWhen you read the Official Rules you are told that the the odds of winning the $6,000.00 in Prosperity International Cash Draw's Category One are 1:500,000. Hang on! Didn't the letter say you'd already won, but failed to claim the money? If it looks too good to be true, it probably is…!\n\nA text message, coming from the number 0424 842 099 and offering loans from ‘Prudent Financial Services’ is a fake. Don't be fooled by this scam.\n\nWould you hand over your personal details and $10 for the chance to win $10,000 in the future? It’s no puzzle that this is just another mail scam which you should avoid.\n\nA guaranteed prize amount of $30,000 is yours by answering three questions, or so the organisers behind Quick Cash Contest claim. It’s no puzzle that this is the same scam operating under different names. Don’t waste your money by responding.\n\nYou will need more than roadside assistance if you fall for this scam. Criminal gangs are using the name of reputable Western Australian company, RAC Finance Ltd (part of the RACWA group), to trawl for money mules to launder stolen funds.\n\nDozens of WA ScamNet contributors have received personally addressed letters from Rachel stating they are “one of three people” to receive this year’s prosperity and fortune.\n\nThis silent movie wannabe will personally do a cosmic intervention which will cost you $48, $64, $80, or $95. Isn’t it nice that Radia has given you a choice about how much money she will con out of you? Personally we think that even $48 is a lot to pay for a candle and some mumbo jumbo made up by the people behind the Radia scam. Of course, Radia is not real.\n\nThe competition does not close until next year (July 31, 2007) and money will not be paid out until December 2007. It seems a long time to wait to win a small amount of money in an international competition! WA ScamNet has never heard of anyone winning the grand prize in these competitions.\n\nConsumer Protection and WA Police have issued a joint warning to real estate agents after scammers tried to sell a Perth home without the owner’s knowledge. An overseas organised criminal network began the process of selling the home by emailing the Property Manager, using a fake email address which mirrored the true owner’s name. Thankfully the agent followed WA Government guidelines which were introduced following the fraudulent sale of a Karrinyup home in 2010 and a Ballajura home in 2011.\n\nGreat mystical clairvoyant and international renowned diviner Rebecca was in the process of working with her divining rods on a big investment project for a businessman when . . . she came into instant telepathic contact with you. Fantastic … you are a lucky person or maybe not.Interestingly, another psychic Rachel (also featured in WA ScamNet) has the same mailing address as Rebecca. It doesn’t take a divining rod to know that if you respond to Rebecca’s offer, you will soon get a letter from Rachel – if you haven’t already got one!\n\nRebecca would have you believe if you want natural positive energy to penetrate you and bring you your share of good luck you should also pick a few fragments of plants and post them to her in the envelope. Be kind to your plants and don’t send them to Rebecca in Switzerland and be kinder to yourself by not sending your credit card details, cheque or money order to this scammer.\n\nScammers have latched onto the current consumer legal action against banks as a way to con Western Australians out of secure personal details over the phone.\n\nThere’s a lot to weigh-up when hunting for a rental home, such as your budget and the location, but one important thing to investigate is whether the property is actually available.\n\nWe all would like something or someone to come into our lives and make things better without us having to try very hard ourselves. The people behind scams know it. ….and they play on it. But WA ScamNet has seen this kind of operation again and again, and they all look the same and use the same tricks against you\n\nWA ScamNet would love to send this scam down the river but unfortunately it will just resurface under a different name.\n\nRobert has some advice for other people who have established an online relationship with someone who is asking for money.\n\nHow low can scammers go? This email uses the name of a charity for sick kids to recruit innocent people to act as money mules?\n\nRose Hart of Switzerland is one of several contenders for the dubious honour of the top psychic scam. Her confidential messages \"from beyond\" to \"you and you alone\" came to WA ScamNet by the boxful. Each predicted imminent wealth - for a fee. Who could have foreseen that letters from Rose Hart predicting huge winnings would often be followed by an opportunity to invest in an overseas lottery or prize draw?\n\nRutger, Feinstein, Rohrbach & Stern have awardable funds totalling $2,540,910 for you. This is the same offer made by 17 other scams operating out of three PO Boxes in Fort Langley, BC, Canada.\n\nRyan is not a real person. The name was registered as a trademark by UK company, Lancore International Limited, in September 2005. This letter has probably been sent to thousands of people around the globe, not the seven people the letter states. If you respond to this scam, the only thing you are guaranteed of receiving is more scam psychic letters.\n\n“All of my heartiest congratulations! The present notice is made out uniquely for your benefit so that you can take immediate possession of the certified cheque that you have truly WON,” so the letter reads.Well, one thing is certain - you won’t become a millionaire by wasting your money on this rubbish!\n\nAn email job offer arrives from a company claiming to have got your resume from SEEK Australia job site.Apparently your resume suits the requirements for a position processing payments. Little computer knowledge is needed and you will be paid DAILY. Your minimal income is $4000 on average a month. Hang-on, this sounds suspiciously like a money mule money laundering scam.\n\nWhen is a cheque for $30,000 not a cheque? When “cheque for $30,000” is the name of a game being peddled by scammers SIAL.\n\nAn SMS competition or SMS trivia scam usually arrives as a text message and may encourage you to enter a competition for a great prize.The scammers make money by charging extremely high rates for the messages you send, and any further messages they send to you. These charges could be as high as $4 for each message sent and/or received.\n\nYour phone bleeps to alert you that a text message has arrived and when you open the SMS proclaiming a cash or prize win in a promotion you don’t remember entering. If you respond to any of these texts, the scammers will find a way to extort money from you. The money you are paying up-front will not result in you getting anything in return. The only winner will be the person, or people, behind the bogus promotion.\n\nHave you ever wanted good fortune, money, happiness and a youthful glow? This is close to everyone’s dream but Sandra Rochefort claims she has some divine powers to help you achieve this. Don’t be fooled by her trickery, especially if it is just a computer inserting your name in key spots through the letter. Save your money and invest in your own future.\n\nSara Freder uses the hook of a free horoscope email to get you in, then harasses you for her paid services and can even take money out of your bank account.\n\nMotor vehicle repairers in WA are being targeted by scammers who send an email requesting work to be carried out on a car and will go on to ask the business to pay a towing company on their behalf.\n\nScammers are targeting consumers selling cars online. These scams usually work by getting you to ‘refund’ a scammer who has sent you too much money for an item you are selling or to forward the additional funds to someone else to cover costs such as shipping.\n\nNew twist in Microsoft tech support scam: Scammers are contacting their victims to offer them money back in a compensation scheme which they claim is being run by Consumer Protection in Western Australia.\n\nScammers aim to make you act quickly without thinking first and play on your fear of the law.\n\nCourt subpoenas and fines are emailed by scammers posing as members of the law.\n\nThe Chinese community are being targeted by random calls claiming to be checking a visa application, a package with fraudulent documents or a money laundering investigation with huge losses reported.\n\nA scam asking people to work as secret shoppers in return for payment cleverly uses a code of conduct and ethics, and very real-looking fake cheques, to try to legitimise a complete fraud.\n\nThis is just another jewellery promotion campaign. WA ScamNet has never heard of anyone winning the money. All you will receive is a cheap piece of jewellery.\n\nDo you want more paperwork on your “to do” list at home? Do you want to waste your time filling out entries into an international competition you may not win? Then have Selective Awards Reporting Agency (SARA) got a deal for you!\n\nThere is no cheque or prize, just a load of VERY fine print novelly printed on the inside of the envelope. What you are actually getting if you are silly enough to respond is a \"magical octagonal talisman\" and a \"money plus receptor\" for just $70. Both are rubbish.\n\nA sentinel usually refers to a sentry or guard, sometimes a statue that guards a particular place, person or item, as well as an honour guard.\n\nA bogus Malaysian travel company, believed to be responsible for numerous travel scams over the past three years, is again tempting recipients with their latest travel brochure to reveal their personal information and pay $3,500 in fees.\n\nSerena’s fine print offers an ‘universal and unconditional guarantee’. However, the very fine print states that the guarantee is not related to results, just a seven-day cooling off period if you are not satisfied, provided you write back to a specified address. Save yourself the postage and don’t respond.\n\nAn email arrives in your inbox announcing you are the winner of the Shell Petroleum International Lottery Promo. Do not respond to this email. It is an advance fee fraud scam. Shell Australia has confirmed it is a scam and their company has nothing to do with it.\n\nIt’s a shame there is NO truth in anything Smaranda writes. No priest of honour would get involved in a scam like this. And “Mahabo” is actually a city in Burma. Maybe Smaranda meant to write “mumbo jumbo” because that’s all this letter is about. Smaranda has got your name off a mailing list and knows nothing about you.\n\nSmartphones are becoming a big part of many Australians’ lives but unfortunately scammers also love new technology and will try to take advantage of any opportunities it offers. View this scam awareness video to see ACCC Deputy Chair Peter Kell discuss how you can use your device safely and how to outsmart scammers.\n\nSophie Bardot claims to be the world’s only clairvoyant specialised in money-based games of chance. Sophie’s skills are obviously not up to scratch otherwise she’d know that there are plenty of so-called psychics making similar claims. In fact, WA ScamNet contributors regularly receive letters from so-called gaming wizards peddling lucky lottery grids or booklets.\n\nIn this scam, an email or letter arrives claiming you have won tens of thousands of dollars in a Spanish Lottery you have never heard of. Look out for the El Mundo Spanish Lottery Sweepstake notification, which is a carbon copy of the El Gordo lottery scam.\n\nEvery now and again a scam comes along which really gets us angry at WA ScamNet, and this is one of those scams. Some of our readers may have seen the Department’s media release on the Sceptre of Atlantis and are already aware of this nefarious scam, but for those who haven’t please read on.\n\nThe last time Consumer Protection warned Western Australians about sports arbitrage and prediction software was in 2010 and it’s still a sure bet if you want to lose money.\n\nIf you take a gamble with sports arbitrage or share prediction schemes you can bet your bottom dollar you’re going to lose money.\n\nSteinberg Investments have a highly paid part-time job waiting for you.Steinberg Investments is so well-known that when you do a search on the Internet, it comes up with plenty of listings – as a SCAM.\n\n.\n\nThis scam begins with an unsolicited phone call from someone who claims to represent Microsoft or IBM and ends with someone gaining access to your computer.\n\nMikael has written to quite a few WA ScamNet contributors as President of, and on behalf of, the “Supreme Council of 12”, telling them how he and the rest of the Council conducted 7-hour, indepth study into their particular “cases” to come up with “an immediate solution” for each person. With 29 contributors receiving letters from Mikael in October alone, I wonder if the Supreme Council ever stop to get some sleep……\n\nThe cheque for US$10,000 enclosed in a letter from Supreme Financial Services says ‘this is not a valid cheque’. It’s not a valid offer either.\n\nOf all the scams that have come to ScamNet, the mail out from the Swiss Institute for Holistic Living in Switzerland is close to being the most bizarre.\n\nAsk yourself why would an international financial investment company send out unsolicited emails to recruit a financial manager? Swiss Invest Ltd claims to be a leading company dealing in the European equity market. But we say they are just leaders in scams.\n\nInvestment schemes and legal structures that do not comply with the law are considered to be aggressive tax planning arrangements - referred to as tax schemes.

What to do?\n\nFor between $39.95 and $79.95 per month you are guaranteed to receive some winnings from multiple entries into lottery syndicates operated on your behalf.
