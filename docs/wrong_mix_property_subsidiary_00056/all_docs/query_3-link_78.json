Being scammed 1 Mil or more DarkRP cash or any amount of Suga Dollars is subject to review and punishment. Make sure to use !trade to verify the legitimacy of any transaction.\n\nDO report bugs/exploits! Using them to your own advantage and not reporting them will have you banned\n\nDO listen to staff. Even if something isn't explicitly mentioned in the MOTD, does not mean it's okay. If you have an issue with a staff ruling, take it up on the forums instead of in-game.\n\nDO call for staff if you see someone breaking the rules\n\nDO warn users either 3 times in /advert, or once using the E menu giving at least 3 seconds before defending yourself to the general rules section.\n\nDO try to talk to the person who RDM’d you before calling a sit\n\nDO NOT RDM\n\nDO NOT Minge\n\nDO NOT Propclimb\n\nDO NOT Propblock\n\nDO NOT be a dick, we are all here to have fun and play the game\n\nDO NOT advertise or participate in any trades on the server or our platforms that involve trading anything outside of our server for any currency on our server (ex: Steam game or PayPal for DarkRP cash, Sugar Dollars, or in-game items)\n\nDO NOT attempt to loophole any rules. Just because something isn’t written down, doesn’t make it okay. Staff have the final say in sits, if you disagree then you must appeal the decision on the forums, not in-game.\n\nDO NOT Do Violent Thefts (Ex. Player A shoots and kills player B because they are holding a printer. Events like Golden Printer are an exception)\n\nDO NOT RP in spawn unless you're running through it in an RP situation\n\nDO NOT use racial slurs or be overly offensive to other players/staff.\n\nDO NOT be constantly vulgar in OOC, you will be warned then kicked / banned\n\nDO NOT block off unique NPCs, everyone needs to get to them\n\nDO NOT raid the same person over and over again, pick on someone else every once in a while\n\nDO NOT raid public bases. Some people just wanna chill, don't ruin their fun if they have no goods in their public base. Boomboxes are not counted as goods.\n\nDO NOT attack a base member while raiding they must be both within eyeshot AND reasonably close to the base\n\nDO NOT counter / assist actions before getting involved. Ex: Attacking a cop before he knows that you’re associated with the person he is arresting. The cop should know you’re together to prevent confusion.\n\nDO NOT counter / assist actions that you are not involved with. Ex: Killing a cop for cuffing someone or killing raiders without having any intent to take over their raid.\n\nDO NOT warn people for general actions such as walking down the street, looking at them or being near them\n\nDO NOT revolt against the PD without an actual RP reason. Be specific with your reasoning!\n\nDO NOT advert PD raid if you're inside of the PD. You must do it outside since you will be committing murder to everyone inside\n\nDO NOT bind multiple different adverts to one message, you will be asked to change it. (Ex: raid/mug/heist/bank raid/kidnap)(False/Over is fine)\n\nDO NOT switch jobs during a raid or other RP interaction. If you switch jobs in a raid for example, the RP situation is over instantly and you must stop.\n\nDO NOT incite other players to break the rules\n\nDO NOT call staff without a specified reason. Ex: \"ADMIN 2 ME PLZ\" is not allowed \"Hey admin, player x is mass RDMing right now, can you help out?\"\n\nDO NOT call staff constantly. Spamming admin chat will have you kicked/banned\n\nDO NOT scam Custom Class content (including slots & perms)\n\nDO NOT Use Boomboxes to play ear-rape/racial slurs/racist content or overly-sexual content\n\nDO NOT take rule violations into your own hands, someone else breaking the rules doesn't mean you get to and you can be punished too\n\nDO NOT abuse your VIP rank, this includes false votebanning/kicking, and calling votebans and votekicks while staff members are online. Abuse can result in your VIP being revoked.\n\nNLR\n\nNLR exists and please use your best judgment to determine whether or not it is okay to return to a place after death. Most people don't care if you died to a hit at PD and come back. People will care if you died in a raid and come back. If you want to play it safe don't return to your place of death until the time is up, no one likes a sore loser. In this section, there are examples of what is considered NLR and what doesn't usually matter to most people.\n\nIf you did die in a raid/heist, its simply over. You CANNOT come back and continue raiding/defending unless you die to a natural event.\n\nIf your raid is interrupted by a natural event (such as a train, being teleported by the pickle statue or a sit, any raid cooldown timers are void. You may restart your raid immediately.\n\nDuring the Kill the VIP, Defend the Vault, and Golden Printer events, there is no NLR if you are trying to attack/defend the Event (NLR applies to all other situations during these events). This does NOT mean you can continually raid the same base if the Golden Printer is inside it.\n\nNLR Examples\n\nGoing back to the road you died on to a hitman to see your friends ALLOWED\n\nGoing back to the road you died on to a hitman to kill the hitman NOT ALLOWED\n\nJimmy going back to Jimmy's house after raiders raided it and killed him NOT ALLOWED\n\nGoing back to Jimmy's house you were raiding after you died NOT ALLOWED\n\nGoing back to finish a heist as a raider after you died NOT ALLOWED\n\nGoing back to defend a heist as a CP after you died NOT ALLOWED\n\nGoing back into the PD as a cop after you got killed by a Bounty Hunter ALLOWED\n\nGoing back into the PD as a raider after you got killed by a mugger ALLOWED\n\nGoing back to the outside of your base after you die in a raid to watch the raid.

This shows John has no intent on playing on the server.\n\nLTAP: John kills Billy for no reason before he hops off for the night. Once he kills him, he leaves immediately.\n\nCNTAP: John kills Billy for no reason, and changes his name to avoid being caught by the staff team.\n\nFDA: John is getting raided by Billy and instead of using his keypad to open the door the raider is picking, he uses his key-bind to open it quickly and kill him.\n\nPropblock: John is printing money and blocks off his house and printer with 50 bathtubs to make sure no one can get them\n\nPropclimb: John is raiding Billy's house and sees he has an opening at the top of his structure.

Whether you're being harmful or not, trespassing someone else's house should be considered a raid.\n\nWhen starting a raid, be close to the place you're raiding. Sitting away from the house shooting people while they are coming out is not allowed.\n\nAdvert Rules\n\nAdverts that Exist:\n\nPD Raid\n\nBank Heist\n\nWarn\n\nKingdom Raid\n\nOver (While not required under any circumstances, this advert is recommended, courteous, and can be considered valid for roleplay purposes.

You may only require raiders go through 3 doors to get to your entities/bank vault.\n\nA double fading door counts as two doors, a triple fading door counts as 3\n\nOne way props are allowed\n\nYou cannot have a base that requires special tools/prop climb. It must be raid-able by a single person using a lock-pick and/or keypad-cracker.\n\nYou cannot have a sky-base, rooftops that are not explicitly part of the base (door leading to it) DO count as sky-bases (Unless you are playing Preacher)\n\nYou cannot have a crouch base that exploits a head or foot glitch (or any other body part, don't loophole please)\n\nPlacing a building sign prevents you from being raided, but you may not have any entities or any form of making money. This is a ban-able offense\n\nKoS signs are not allowed but you may have Loitering signs. Minimum time for a loiterer to be killed is 5 seconds\n\nTrespassing makes you KoS. This means if you trespass someone's house while they are \"building\" you will die. If it is a public base, you must be warned to leave first.\n\nThe owner of the MOST doors in a base is the owner. Not the owner of the front door.\n\nYour goods must be accessible in some way or form. You cannot just prop block them\n\nYou must have your keypads in plain sight and it must be next to the door\n\nYour base must have a clear path through. This means no full blackout/super dark bases, invisible bases, or maze bases where the path is not obvious\n\nKeypads may not have any delay on them opening. EX: Your keypad has a 30-second delay but then opens for 5 seconds. (To avoid confusion and unnecessary sits.)\n\nYou may not use/hide inside no-collided props to avoid being damaged, arrested, raided, etc\n\nYou may not remove a Dupe to bring Entities inside of your base, then replace your Dupe. This is declared FailRP.\n\nBuilding/loitering signs must be size 30 or larger, be easily visible, and near the main entrance of the base.\n\nDo not abuse non-destructible entities when building your base. This means using them for anything other than their intended purpose.\n\nYou may only base in one spot at a time.\n\nDo not fading door abuse. Fading door abuse is when you explicitly use bound key to toggle the door during any rp situation like kidnapping, being raided, being arrested, etc.\n\nA public base is a place with open doors such as a restaurant. For your base to be considered a public base, you MUST place a sign indicating it as a \"Public Base.\" You may not have money-making entities inside/it will be treated as a building sign. If the base does have closed and locked doors or entities, call staff to report a false public base.\n\nYou cannot build/remove props to your advantage while being raided or in a situation that involves a clash between other players. Ex: Stealing a printer, running to your base, deleting it and then placing the base back when you're inside\n\nDestroying your entities during a raid on your base to avoid them being stolen is FailRP.\n\nNo full fountain dupes, your dupes at fountain must have a function and not just be for aesthetics.\n\nYou must have at least 3 members who are part of the same faction (ie, 3 hobos, 3 crips, 3 aliens) to megabase unless you're the king\n\nYour megabase cannot take over a large portion of the map and the portion of the map cannot be a hotspot (Ex: In front of PD)\n\nYour group must own at least the front door of every house to megabase in that area\n\nYou can not block off any unique NPC (Any NPC where there is only one NPC on the map like Harvest buyer or the Cereal Statue)\n\nHow to be a Good Player\n\nA section dedicated to the people who have 3 brain cells. The BAD section is parallel with the GOOD section\n\nRP situations out. This is an RP server at its core\n\nIf you're going to provide negative feedback, make it constructive\n\nUse your brain and read the rules, you can't possibly complain about \"Well this is how other servers do it so I didn't know\"\n\nBeing warned/kicked banned means you did something wrong which you should learn from it\n\nEvery time you're brought into a sit that means you did something wrong which you should learn from it\n\nCalling staff for issues you haven't tried to solve will have you put on the bad boy list (exceptions for this is mass rdm/nlr)\n\nExamples of a BAD Player:\n\nCalling staff because he doesn't know how to change jobs\n\nCalling staff because he doesn't know if his base is allowed\n\nCalling staff because he doesn't know what his job does\n\nCalling staff because someone called them a hurtful word\n\nCalling staff because someone just killed them\n\nCalling staff that explains only part of the issue\n\nCalling staff when the Mayor adds a harsh law\n\nCalling staff when a cop arrests them on either accident or purpose\n\nCalling staff when he needs a door un-owned\n\nArguing with a player in OOC\n\nNot listening to staff/claiming a rule doesn't exist so they can do it\n\nReporting players and or staff when they have no evidence/non-conclusive evidence\n\nExamples of a GOOD Player\n\nAsking players how to change jobs in chat or in person\n\nReading the rules to see if his base is allowed/getting other player's opinions\n\nReading the rules/job description to see what his job does\n\nVoice Chat/Text Chat muting players when they get called a bad word\n\nExamining the situation of why they died and asking the player why they killed him\n\nCalling a staff member with the most detail possible to prevent downtime and confusion\n\nRevolting against the Mayor when a harsh rule is made\n\nPMing the cop who arrested them when they got randomly arrested\n\nPMing the player who owns the door to see if they can own it\n\nTaking a heated argument to local or PM chat\n\nAccepting what staff tells them. If they have an issue with it, they make a post on the forums explaining why they think they're in the right\n\nReporting players/staff with video evidence. No other questions should be asked on a good report. It should 100% conclusive by the original post\n\nParty / Gang Rules\n\nA section dedicated to people who don't know how RP as a party/gang. Using parties/gangs to combat other people usually results in confusion. Just because you are in a party/gang with somebody doesn't mean you are automatically \"involved\" with their situations. Here is how to do it correctly.\n\nYou must to be in a !party with someone to assist in a roleplay scenario. Being in a gang together does not count.\n\nIf you're going to kill someone because they attacked your party member, you need to make sure they know you're together (local chat or voice (not OOC/Advert)). Not doing so will cause confusion and most likely result in a sit which no one wants. (This applies to raiding as well)\n\nBeing in a party or gang doesn't mean you will not die/be raided/kicked/harassed by your own party and gang. Don't call staff members for internal issues you're dealing with.\n\nDeal with situations using role-play. If you aren't role-playing together or they have no reason to suspect that you are connected in any way, it makes no RP sense to randomly pull out a gun and shoot them.\n\nYou must be in a party BEFORE a raid begins in order to assist. You may not join a party to assist while a raid is taking place.\n\nThe BAD section is parallel with the GOOD section\n\nExamples of a BAD party/gang member\n\nSniping a player from across the map because his party member got mugged\n\nAttacking a player because someone just killed their party/gang member when you were nowhere nearby/not visible\n\nCalling staff when their party/gang just raided them\n\nCalling staff when their party/gang just kicked them because he paid 500k to be in there\n\nExamples of a GOOD party/gang member\n\nRunning up to the player who killed their party/gang member and telling them they are about to die for killing their member\n\nKilling a cop for cuffing your party/gang member you are role-playing with (fishing, mugging, kidnapping players together, etc)\n\nLeaving the party/gang\n\nNever join another party/gang with those people and spread the word\n\nCivilian Rules\n\nBasic Description: You sell items, complete tasks and just be a regular civilian to survive.\n\nRaid Heist Megabase\n\nBank Manager CANNOT base with Bank Heisters\n\nBank Manager may not keep his bank private or only for his friends\n\nYou may not counter Bank Heists if you are not a cop/bank guard/manager or in the Bank when the Raid begins, Insurance exists to protect your money.\n\nYou may not counter PD Raids if you are not a cop or are in the PD when the Raid begins.\n\nChucky can KOS Picolas Cage, Pissed Baby, Master Stalker, Stalker, and Treasure Hunter.\n\nChucky and Jigsaw are at constant war, they are KOS to each other all the time.\n\nMedics can assist in raids.\n\nMr. Bones is not KOS when a kidnapper gets kidnapped because of him.\n\nDo not place item shelves in the middle of the streets/block main areas with them. While we understand that you want a lot of people to see the stuff you are selling it's also frustrating to have it shoved down our throats. If a Staff/Players are asking you to move it then do so.\n\nSelling guns in your gun stand for outrageous prices with the sole intent of either scamming noobs or catching people off guard who happen to misclick your gun stand is not allowed.\n\nCop Rules\n\nBasic Description: You protect and serve the people of the town\n\nRaid Heist Megabase\n\nDefault PD Area Restrictions (Unless law stating otherwise)\n\nOutside PD - Non Restricted\n\nInside PD Lobby - Non Restricted, unless on lock down.\n\nPast PD Lobby - Restricted.

Raiding a base without a warrant is FailRP.\n\nMayor Rules:\n\nYou cannot assist criminals or commit crimes\n\nMake your laws something that your officers can enforce, you cannot make rules that allow players/CP to kill each other\n\nYou can not make a law to make someone above the law because it breaks role-play (ex: JohnSteven22 is immune to all laws because he is my friend)\n\nYou can override any default law except for making killing, printers, or stealing legal\n\nYour laws must follow some sort of RP guidelines. Making them stupid will result in you being demoted and or kicked. No one likes a dumb mayor.\n\nYour laws must not be so harsh where it makes other players leave the server. They will vote you as an unfair Mayor in which you will be demoted.\n\nFiring your CP for no RP reason is not allowed. This is an RP server please use RP or you may get removed from the job.\n\nMaking lockdowns that do not have a valid RP reason are not allowed.

If a train is summoned inside of a base, that is considered as a raid. Since Picolas Cage is a job defined to not be permitted to raid, this means you are not allowed to continue to perform other raiding actions such as chucking C4 into their base or lockpicking, you cannot raid the base again before the normal time limit, and you cannot switch jobs in order to raid them after summoning the train. To make it simple - no summoning a train for raiding purposes.\n\nKidnapper Rules\n\nBasic Description: You kidnap people and make them your slave.\n\nRaid | Heist | Megabase\n\nAlien Race can Raid and Heist if all three are together\n\nDo not use your disguise swep to avoid RP/arrest\n\nThe Preacher can sky-base\n\nKidnapping/Attempt Kidnapping people makes you KOS as you're a threat to everyone around you. Mr. Bones is not KOS when a kidnapper gets kidnapped because of him\n\nKidnap bases may have 5 total fading doors. 2 leading to the main room, and 3 cells. Kidnap bases are bases that ONLY store kidnapped victims. If you have any other raid-able entities, then you must follow standard basing rules\n\nIn order to kill your kidnap victim you must bring them to your base first. Kidnapping them in the street and when they wake up, in the street, killing them there is still RDM\n\nMisc Rules\n\nRules that generally don't have to be said but are here for the people who need to see them.\n\nDo not force other players to get stuck, if they can't move it's not RP\n\nDo not kill people at NPCs without an RP reason, you don't gain anything and therefore it is intentional RDM and a bannable offense\n\nIf you're shot at, you're allowed to fire back even if they miss\n\nIf someone failed to perform their job functions correctly (Ex: A cop let their friend have a gun without a license) you can /demote them. If they broke a rule against you (Ex: RDM) you could demote them but we highly suggest calling a sit. Contact someone before calling a /demote on them for breaking a rule against you. If you are unsure, ask for staff assistance.\n\nIntentionally lowering people's framerates with a ton of moving materials/flashing materials will have you warned and then punished\n\nTeleporting behind someone makes you KOS for the person you teleported to.\n\nMisleading adverts are not allowed, making 3 lines of random trading advert then adding a subtle (PD raid) at the end is stupid. If a staff ask you to remove it then please do so.\n\nSpawning props in public then making them no gravity before letting them fly is not allowed, it ruins some people's FPS and is dumb in general.\n\nYou may request a staff member as a middleman for large (1m) transactions. This service is dependent on staff availability.\n\nLoot-boxes are considered entities and you cannot open them in a base while building or prop-blocked\n\nMacros/external programs/scripts are not allowed.\n\nThe following 2 actions are allowed without adverting PD raid, so long as you do not engage anyone without them engaging you first (or warning them properly): Jail-breaking and Hackers hacking any of the PD panels, including the one in the Mayor's office. Anything involving breaking through a prop or a fading door is not allowed under this rule and will be considering PD raiding without an advert. If you wish to PD raid, you will still be required to call PD raid after exiting the PD entirely. If you kill a CP legally under this rule, leave the PD, and then call PD raid, the officer you killed before you called PD raid will not be considered to be breaking NLR if they return to the PD to stop your PD raid, as they died before you called a PD raid.\n\nIf a player has been gone for 30 consecutive days from the server without prior notification, you can revoke their custom class permanent slot without being subject to the scamming rule. It is highly recommended that you record their gametracker (Recommended method is via screenshot) at the time of revocation to prevent future issues.\n\nDo not modify a job name in a way that gives you a clearly unintended roleplay advantage. (ex. Standard custom class named \"Civil Projection\" and using a model that looks like CP to gain entry into the Mayor's office, or Terrorist changes their job name to \"Black Market Dealer\", Hacker drinks a CP potion and also changes his job name to Secret Service before raiding the PD, etc.)\n\nReport someone within 2 weeks, or we will not take action, even if they Mass RDMed 99999999999 players. Reports will still be accepted for extremely serious offenses, such as things which break the law, on a case by case basis, but if we determine you held this information from the staff team for the purposes of blackmail, threats, or other similar reasons, you will receive a punishment equal to whatever we decide to do with the player you reported.\n\nStaff will not interfere with your personal loans. Give money to those you trust, or accept collateral.\n\nSneaking into the PD is allowed without advert as long you do not attack police or raid to PD Bank. You are not allowed to defend yourself. Ex: Hobo is allowed to sneak in to jailbreak his friend. Once he's spotted, he can run but not attack the officer, even if attacked.\n\nImportant Links (Intended to help you out in-game!)"
