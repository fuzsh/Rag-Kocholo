EBay has announced a series of changes that will affect users after the online marketplace ended its 19-year partnership with PayPal.

From June 1 onwards sellers will no longer be able to manage their sales on PayPal and monthly billing statements will be axed.

EBay users who have not updated their payment details will "lose their eligibility for future selling fee promotions", the company warned in a recent email sent to account holders.

The message said: "eBay now manages the end-to-end selling experience on our marketplace, including payments."

Mirror Online reports that from June 1, any fees on sales will be withdrawn at the point of sale, with the remaining balance automatically transferred to the seller's bank account.

That means there will be no monthly billing statement or fees to pay.

Sellers will also no longer have to stump up PayPal fees, that means the only charge you will incur is eBay's flat rate 12.8% of the total sales plus a fixed-fee of 30p per order.

If the total amount of the sale is over £2,500 for a single item, you will pay 3% for the portion of the sale above £2,500.

EBay purchased PayPal in 2002 and spun it off in 2015, but the two organisations had remained tightly linked, with PayPal continuing to process payments on behalf of eBay.

From June 1, buyers will still have the option to pay via PayPal, however, the money will be sent to the seller's bank - not their PayPal account.

An eBay spokeswoman said that those who do not update their details by the deadline will be given a grace period before any action is taken against their account.
