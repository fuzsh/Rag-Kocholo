What happens when I order this service?

When you place your order, you will receive a confirmation email with your order reference. Our specialist team will personally check all of the information in your request. If there is any additional information required, or something needs clarification, we will get in touch as soon as possible.

Once the request information is ready, we will search the necessary archives in order to locate the correct record for you. We automatically cover a 5 year search each side of your given event date if required. Once the correct record is located, we will then request a duplicate certificate is issued and advise you via email that the request has been made.

As soon as the certificate is ready for dispatch, we will notify you that it's on its way. If you have requested a scan, we will email this to you at this point.

We use a range of methods to ensure secured delivery of your documents. These are determined by the country you live in as follows:

All deliveries to UK addresses, including The Channel Islands and the Isle of Mann, are sent using Royal Mail. Services available include Standard First Class, Royal Mailed Signed For and Royal Mail Special Delivery (1PM).

Overseas Deliveries

Services for deliveries overseas vary dependent on your location. For most countries including the EU, North America and Australia, we offer Standard Royal Mail International post.

Failed Deliveries

If you have opted for a signed service and no-one is available to sign for the delivery, the package will be taken back to the local sorting office or depot and you will be left a card asking you to collect the item or arrange for a reattempted delivery at a convenient time.
