A MEDIEVAL CITY

CHIM CHIMNEY...

We can't assure you that by snapping your fingers while taking the chimneys tour, everything will return to normal; nor that if you open your umbrella, you'll blow away to dance and jump on the chimneys of the city. However you will certainly travel back in time to the powerful industrial past of Molina. This journey will take you from square to square and from garden to garden to the ancient factories of the municipality. Currently, they are restored as leisure and cultural spaces guarded by showy contemporary sculptures and a play area.

WITHOUT CURTAINS

In October, Molina celebrates its International Theatre Festival without curtains or seats. This is because it's the most important regional performance of street, experimental and claiming theatre. Although the festival consists mostly of open air plays, you will also be able to see more traditional ones or those requiring a room in the city pubs or the Villa de Molina Theatre. If you want to undertake a theatrical journey but you can't come during the festival, keep calm and come to any of the debuts the theatre offers throughout the year.

IN GOOD COMPANY

In the midst of this industrial scenery, you will be amazed by this natural oasis in the heart of the city: the La Compañía Park (Company Park). This is a combination of green spaces and cultural elements, such as the Park Waterwheel, the Auditorium and the tree-lined avenues like Las Letras. The ground of this amazing boulevard is covered with plates with the names of the main writers of Molina. It was created to honour a successful literary generation known as Autores del Meteorito (Meteorite Authors). Legend has it that their talent is related to the enigmatic radiation produced by the impact of an enormous meteorite in Molina in 1858.

A WINDOW TO THE PAST

The Albarda Museum is one of the most unusual and original museums of the area. As if it was a XXL Pandora's Box, the museum preserves all those traditions that have governed the locals' daily life since the ancient past. After an introduction about natural environment and anthropology, you will discover probably the flashiest room, containing all sort of things related to magical believes, traditional feasts, natural medicine, games and weather forecasts. This is a nod to some arcane rituals that sometimes are still very important nowadays.
