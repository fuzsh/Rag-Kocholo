        "text": "The Islamic Nasrid kingdom of Granada occupied the mountainous areas of the southeastern area of the Iberian Peninsula. There, a natural border was established between the Nasrid kingdom and the Christian kingdom of Castile from 1232 to 1492. To control this frontier and establish visual communication between it and the Nasrid center at the Alhambra citadel, an extensive network of watchtowers and defensive towers was constructed. Studies have been done of individual towers, but no comparative study has been undertaken of all of them. Graphic, homogenous, and exhaustively planimetric documentation would bring together existing information on the majority of them and enable comparative analysis. For this reason, this work conducts systematic architectural surveys of all these military structures, using photogrammetry. In addition to studying the construction typology and techniques, the structural capacity of these towers has been analyzed. It examines how they have been affected by human and natural destructive forces, especially earthquakes, which are common in eastern Andalusia. Although all the historical military architecture is protected by the Spanish and Andalusian Heritage laws, many of these medieval towers and their cultural landscapes are in severe risk. The towers are being studied as individual specimens (emphasizing their differences) and as a unit in a typological group (looking for similarities and unifying characteristics). New technologies for Information and Communication are being used in order to disseminate the results among specialists and to make them available to the general public. Guidelines for restoration projects are also being formulated from the cases analyzed.\n\nOn the border between the ancient garb al-Andalus and sharq al-Andalus lies the Segura de la Sierra valley (Jaén, Spain), an area in which the medieval ways from Seville and Granada came together on the way to the east of the Iberian Peninsula. Given its strategic position and fertile orography, during the 11th and 12th centuries, Saqura became an important Islamic amal (administrative division of al-Andalus). A complex system of towers still remains from this era, built using the rammed earth construction technique. With the aim of delving further into this rich heritage, the research project #ProyectoSegura is being carried out, designed to obtain details that provide more information about the implementation criteria, chronological dating, and construction techniques used by applying a methodology based on the use of new technologies. The description of this work process and the presentation of the main results are the contributions of this paper.\n\nThe current management of cultural heritage requires a joint administration of their tangible and intangible assets, as well as the natural heritage in their environment. However, it is an approach that is not always carried out. In the case of those castles located in the south of the Valencian Community (Spain), this management is in themselves. From the work developed in Castalla since 2005, and the doctoral thesis carried out between 2013 and 2016, it has been possible to meet their real – cultural and natural – heritage diversity: in many cases and to date it was practically invisible. Thus, with reference to Castalla Castle and Sax Castle, the concept of heritage site will be defined, cultural and natural assets that make them up will be listed, their similarities and differences will be showed and it will be reflected on the need to understand them as heritage sites that are cultural and natural landscapes, larger or smaller, to be integrally managed as the only way to achieve a proper administration.\n\nThe present work has as object of study the medieval tower of San Nicolás, in Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Avila (Spain), a building of uncertain chronology hidden in a later construction of early Renaissance period. We offer new graphic documentation, produced by direct surveying methodologies, which provides data to complete the typological analysis of the primitive tower and establish the formal relationships that allow us to identify its original proportions, the constructive limits between the medieval and Renaissance tower and gather new elements of judgment to identify the dates of construction of both interventions. KEY WORDS San Nicolás de Madrigal, medieval tower, constructive phases 0. INTRODUCCIÓN In the Castilian territory of Baja Moraña, northwest of Avila (Spain), a set of towers of a multifunctional character are to be found. They must have been built between the 12th and 13th centuries and combine typological, material, constructive and formal characteristics that allow them to be considered within a homogeneous group. The earliest towers are erected at a time when tensions between the kingdoms of Leon and Castile pose a threat to the civilian population, which was concentrated in small localities scattered throughout the territory of Baja Moraña, located in the border between both kingdoms. Inside the towers of our study there are two or even three overlapping chambers of sufficient size to accommodate the population and basic necessities that would allow survival in case of sieges not excessively prolonged. The belfries of the towers were used as a surveillance platform and place from which to communicate with other nearby towers to alert the imminence of the attacks. This set of towers is framed within the Mudéjar, Christian architecture constructed by alarifes (bricklayers) of Islamic origin or employing techniques and resources typical of this culture."
