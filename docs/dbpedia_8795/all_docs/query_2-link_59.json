        "text": "Geography\n\nThe Baetic Cordillera in the southern portion of Murcia borders the Mediterranean and declines eastward into the plain of Cartagena. The tableland of Jumilla and Yecla rises in the northern portion of Murcia. To the west of Murcia is the pre-Baetic cordillera. The Segura River runs northwest to southeast through the centre of Murcia, irrigating the rich huertas (irrigated farming plots that are usually family-run) in the valleys of the Baetic Cordillera. Annual precipitation in the region is very low, ranging from about 7 inches (170 mm) around Cape Tiñoso to about 11 inches (280 mm) in Cartagena. Temperatures are high and show relatively little seasonal variation.\n\nThe population of the plain of Cartagena is sparse, and the isolated farmsteads and small villages are located where there is water. Emigration from Murcia has been considerable since 1900. The dialect in the countryside is called Panocho, and it reflects Arab, Catalan, and Aragonese influences.\n\nIntensive irrigation supports a dense population in the huertas on the satellite farming communities around the city of Murcia. The autonomous community has relied on water transfer for irrigation since the 1960s, mainly through the Tagus-Segura river scheme. By the early 21st century, however, water supplies had been depleted, and the transfer of water had to be approved by the central government in Madrid. Minifundios (small farms) predominate in the huertas, while the growth of small-scale industries in the towns has allowed many underemployed agricultural workers to work part-time in factories. The traditional dwelling of the Murcian huerta is the barraca, a thatched farmhouse, oftentimes decorated with jasmine and geraniums. The populations of the ports of Cartagena, Mazarrón, and Aguilas have grown with the development of shipping and mining along the coastal plain.\n\nAbout one-half of the land under cultivation is dry-farmed, mainly for barley and grapes to make wine, but this accounts for only a small percentage of the autonomous community’s agricultural output and is gradually losing ground to irrigated farming. The principal crops of the irrigated huertas are tomatoes, peppers, plums, peaches, grapes, oranges, lemons, apricots, and melons. Pigs are bred."
