        "text": "The convent of Las Claras is built on the site of former Moorish palaces and is still home to nuns\n\nThe Monasterio de Santa Clara la Real in the city of Murcia, often referred to by locals simply as “Las Claras”, is a collection of buildings which are mainly in use these days as a museum and cultural centre run by the Fundación Cajamurcia, hosting frequent exhibitions and other events throughout the year. In the interior patio the decorative pond or “alberca” of Ibn Hud’s garden is still preserved, one of the oldest of its kind in Spain, while over the centuries the architecture has been enriched by addition of gothic and baroque structures alongside the Islamic features.\n\nPrior to Ibn Hud’s palace there is known to have been another one on the same spot build for Ibn Mardanis, the “Wolf King” of Murcia from 1147 to 1172. This palace was known as Al Dar al Sugra, but was destroyed by the Almohad dynasty when they conquered Murcia in 1172, and the following century was when Ibn Hud (1228-38) ordered that the “Alcázar Seguir” (minor alcázar, or palace) should be built.\n\nJust 5 years after Ibn Hud’s death Murcia was reconquered by Christian forces and the treaty of Alcaraz was signed, converting the “Taifa” of Murcia into a protectorate of the Crown of Castilla, and at this point a Christian garrison occupied the main “Alcázar” while the Alcázar Seguir became the residence of Ibn Hud al-Dawla, uncle of the former ruler.\n\nAfter the Moorish rebellion of 1264-66 had been quashed, though, the building as occupied by the Castilian monarchy, and Alfonso X “El Sabio” and Jaime I of Aragón are known to have spent time here.\n\nIn 1365, though Pedro I “El Cruel” donated the palace to Abbess Berenguela de Espín and the Order of “Hermanas Pobres de Santa Clara” (sometimes known in English as the “Poor Clares”), and the nuns continue to occupy part of the complex today. Under the Order the Moorish patio became the centre of daily life, and in the 15th century, under the patronage of the Catholic Monarchs, further additions were made in the form of the cloister and the Gothic-style church.\n\nFurther modifications were made in the 17th century including a new baroque church with only the choir of the previous one allowed to remain, but as the Order declined in the 20th century after they were temporarily evicted during the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) they eventually found themselves obliged to “downsize”.\n\nThus, the western wing was sold off, now housing the Centro Sociocultural de CajaMurcia and in the 1960s the southern wing was knocked down to make way for a garage. But in 1995 a new residence was built on the site of the southern wing, and at this point the remains of the palaces of Ibn Hud and Ibn Mardanis palace came to light. These can now be visited in the museum which houses the Islamic archaeology collection of the Museo Arqueológico de Murcia and a collection of religious art, and visitors can also see the interior of the cloister and the choir.\n\nOpening hours\n\nSeptember to June: Tuesday to Saturday 10.00 to 13.00 and 16.00 to 18.30, Sundays and public holidays 10.00 to 13.00\n\nJuly and August: Tuesday to Sunday 10.00 to 13.00\n\nAdmission is free of charge.\n\nGuided tours are available between September and June at 10.00, 11.00, 12.00, 16.30, 17.00 and 17.30, and in summer at 10.00, 11.00 and 12.00. In addition, evening tours at 22.00 can be organized in July and August.\n\nThere is easy access for those of limited mobility.\n\nAddress: Santa Clara 1, 30008 Murcia (click for map)\n\nTelephone: 968 23 46 47\n\narticle_detail"
