        "text": "Located in the mountains above the city of Murcia, Altorreal is a magnificent 18-hole course designed by Dave Thomas, characterized primarily by its innovation in water use, which comes into play especially in the 9th and 18th hole. The estate is located a few kilometers north of the capital of Murcia and only about 45 km from San Javier airport, 15 minutes from the airport of the future Murcia region and one hour from the airport of Alicante. Located in a natural environment with more than 20,000 trees, including olive trees, pines and locust bean gum, an almost deserted area, thus becoming a mountain of unique natural space. A big challenge for players of all levels."
