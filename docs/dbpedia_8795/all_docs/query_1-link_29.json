        "text": "April Molina, Guest Services Supervisor, Alcatraz City Cruises\n\nBorn and raised in San Francisco, April Molina found her ideal job as the guest services supervisor for Alcatraz City Cruises. Sheâs worked with the company for the past 15 years and shares her passion for her city and its rich history with the thousands of guests she meets daily.\n\nNi kitu gani cha kwanza unachokifanya unapoamka asubuhi?\n\nI turn off my alarm, then I pet my rescue dog and catâthey help me start off my morning right. I also say my prayers for a good and safe day for all of us and enjoy a coffee and breakfast sandwich.\n\nUtaelezeaje siku ya kawaida katika jukumu lako?\n\nWhen I arrive, I get the ticket booth ready for the day by checking ticket sales, printing out reports, etc. We assist about 4,000 to 5,000 guests daily at the landing.\n\nIkiwa unataka wageni wetu waondoe kitu kimoja wakati wa uzoefu wao, itakuwaje?\n\nAlcatraz has the most amazing views of San Francisco, and it is quite unique and will exist for many more years to come. A lot of people tell me that they came here as a kid, and now theyâre bringing their kids on a tour of Alcatraz.\n\nWhat amazing experience has this job created for you?\n\nMeeting people from all over the world is pretty amazing. I love to hear peopleâs different accents and see the different styles of clothing. They are excited as soon as they arrive at Pier 33, and I get excited with them!\n\nWhen guests visit your city, what is one local place you love that is a âmust see?â\n\nAlcatraz, the Rock, of courseâitâs a treasure trove of history. I also recommend Chinatown; thereâs lots of shopping and restaurants.\n\nWhat do you do outside of work?\n\nI help care for my 99-year-old mother, who was also born and raised in San Francisco. I also like doing home projects like painting and landscaping. Thank goodness for YouTube tutorials!\n\nIn three words, describe the City you work in.\n\nBeautiful, friendly, and unique."
