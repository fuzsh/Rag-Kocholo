        "text": "A tribute to the traditions of Jumilla and the world’s finest dinosaur footprint catalogue\n\nHoused in one of the majestic stately residences in the centre of Jumilla, next to the park known as the Plaza de la Constitución or the “Jardín de las Ranas”, are the Natural Sciences and Ethnography sections of the municipal museum, including very complete collections related to entomology, esparto grass, mineralogy, earthenware and pharmacy.\n\nOf special interest to many is what is judged to be the best fossil register of “ichnites” – fossilized footprints – dating from the Tertiary in the world, but alongside these are also tools and machinery related to the grape-growing and wine-making traditions of Jumilla, an exceptional collection of paleontological fossils found in the municipality and one of the most important entomological collections in Spain.\n\nThese collections are an overflow from the main Jerónimo Molina archaeological museum in the Plaza de Arriba of Jumilla.\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday to Saturday 10.00 to 14.00 and 17.00 to 19.00, weekends and public holidays 9.00 to 14.00.\n\n10.00 to 14.00 and 17.00 to 21.00 (18.00 to 21.00 in summer), Sundays and public holidays (except those that fall on Mondays) 11.00 to 14.00.\n\nFor more information about visiting Jumilla, including what's on, local news and all of the bodegas on the Jumilla wine route, visit the home page of Jumilla Today.\n\narticle_detail"
