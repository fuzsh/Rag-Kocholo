        "text": "The River Segura is the lifeblood of the región de Murcia and south Costa Blanca, it passes through many towns, villages and cities including the regional capital of Murcia and meets the sea in Guardamar del Segura. It has been a vital transport link throughout the ages and feeds the innumerable agricultural areas throughout the course of the river and has allowed population centres to thrive along its 325km course. There is no shortage of activities to choose from; from white water rafting in the town of Blanca in the region of Murcia for the adrenaline junkies, mountain hiking at the source of the river in the Natural Park Sierras de Cazorla y Segura or long walks across the course of the river in the Vega Baja region and take in the varied ecology and wildlife for a more relaxed experience.\n\nThe river Segura received the European river prize in 2015 due to the efforts of the regional government and local communities to reduce pollution and improve the cleanliness of the river and they continue to reduce plastic waste and other residue. since then it has become a hub for outdoor sports, nature trails and wildlife enthusiasts alike. Why not take a weekend away from the hustle and bustle of the coast, and delve into some of the rich history the river and its surrounding towns and villages have to offer?"
