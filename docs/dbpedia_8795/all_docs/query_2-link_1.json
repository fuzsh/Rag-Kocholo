        "text": "MOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nTop 10\n\nMolina de Segura, surrounded by mountains, is located on the left bank of the Segura River. This destination will surprise you not only by its industrial shapes and its extraordinary landscapes but also by all the fascinating adventures on offer.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nA MEDIEVAL CITY\n\nThis tour through the historical centre of Molina gives you the opportunity to discover 8 centuries of culture in less than two hours and a half. As you walk, you will be able to imagine how citizens lived during the Middle Ages. El Cid Campeador, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, passed by this part of the city, where the King Alphonse VI exiled him for the second time. The citadel on the top of the hill and the remains of the wall that protected the population will take you back to our most epic past.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nCHIM CHIMNEY...\n\nWe can't assure you that by snapping your fingers while taking the chimneys tour, everything will return to normal; nor that if you open your umbrella, you'll blow away to dance and jump on the chimneys of the city. However you will certainly travel back in time to the powerful industrial past of Molina. This journey will take you from square to square and from garden to garden to the ancient factories of the municipality. Currently, they are restored as leisure and cultural spaces guarded by showy contemporary sculptures and a play area.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nWITHOUT CURTAINS\n\nIn October, Molina celebrates its International Theatre Festival without curtains or seats. This is because it's the most important regional performance of street, experimental and claiming theatre. Although the festival consists mostly of open air plays, you will also be able to see more traditional ones or those requiring a room in the city pubs or the Villa de Molina Theatre. If you want to undertake a theatrical journey but you can't come during the festival, keep calm and come to any of the debuts the theatre offers throughout the year.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nMAN vs. WILD\n\nIf you want to know in advance what you're going to see during your trip, there isn't a shade of doubt: the white-headed duck -an unusual endangered waterfowl from the wetland of Campotéjar Lagoon- is looking forward to meet you. This natural area is an ornithological paradise where you will enjoy bird-watching and take memorable postcards of large irrigable fields, sensational sunsets and wonderful reflections on the wide water layers of the wetland.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nTABLECLOTH OR CANVAS?\n\nIf you want to go deeper into the cuisine of Molina de Segura, you have to follow two steps. Firstly, look for the establishments marked with La Dama -a logotype that represents all the top-quality restaurants supporting local products. And secondly, choose among our traditional dishes: \"migas ruleras\" (fried bread crumbs with cold meat), \"arroz a la huertana\" (rice with vegetables), \"olla de cerdo\" (pork with beans) or \"mondongo viudo\" (rice, potato, onion, chickpeas and garlic); or try our avant-garde cuisine and enjoy its most sophisticated tastes and mixes offered by the most innovative restaurants... and always with a Mediterranean touch!\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nGO SHOPPING\n\nThe shopping environment of Molina de Segura is unlike any other. The downtown streets are full of shops overflowed with souvenirs you won't be able to resist buying. One of the most suggestive offers for shopping lovers is the market celebrated on Saturday morning in the La Compañía Park. There is a high-quality exhibition of local products and traditions. The Guadalabiad Market -a craft market celebrated on the first Saturday of each month- holds activities and live demonstrations you can't miss. Molina is also known for its fur trade; its main clothes-making and fur sales workshops are located at the city entrance, on the Avenida de la Industria.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nIN GOOD COMPANY\n\nIn the midst of this industrial scenery, you will be amazed by this natural oasis in the heart of the city: the La Compañía Park (Company Park). This is a combination of green spaces and cultural elements, such as the Park Waterwheel, the Auditorium and the tree-lined avenues like Las Letras. The ground of this amazing boulevard is covered with plates with the names of the main writers of Molina. It was created to honour a successful literary generation known as Autores del Meteorito (Meteorite Authors). Legend has it that their talent is related to the enigmatic radiation produced by the impact of an enormous meteorite in Molina in 1858.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nA WINDOW TO THE PAST\n\nThe Albarda Museum is one of the most unusual and original museums of the area. As if it was a XXL Pandora's Box, the museum preserves all those traditions that have governed the locals' daily life since the ancient past. After an introduction about natural environment and anthropology, you will discover probably the flashiest room, containing all sort of things related to magical believes, traditional feasts, natural medicine, games and weather forecasts. This is a nod to some arcane rituals that sometimes are still very important nowadays.\n\nMOLINA DE SEGURA\n\nTHE ART OF SWING\n\nLike all types of art, golf requires dedication. If you are an amateur golf player, we encourage you to visit the Altorreal Course. After that, you won't be able to stop playing golf! It consists of a natural area, home to more than 20,000 trees, a golf school, all kind of facilities and a wonderful course with 18 holes characterized mainly by its innovative use of water. It's surrounded by semi-desert mountains and it's suitable for players at all levels."
