        "text": "Spain is the 29th most populous country in the world, and in order to reach that ranking, it has quite a few major cities that have very large populations. The biggest city in Spain is Madrid, which has a population of over 3.2 million. The next largest city, Barcelona, has approximately half as many residents as Madrid, but at 1.6 million, this is still impressive for a city's population. These are the only two cities in Spain that have populations exceeding one million. However, that doesn't mean that there aren't other large cities in the country. There are 88 countries that have populations that fall between 100,000 and 1,000,000, and an impressive 707 cities with populations exceeding 10,000. These cities are spread among Spain's 50 provinces.\n\nThis developed country has a smaller rural population, with just 20% of residents living in the rural towns away from the larger cities and metro areas. Not only are urban areas expanding throughout the country but many people are relocating to the cities of Spain for a variety of reasons, whether it is for work or to experience all that this country has to offer. With many cities including Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia only growing in popularity as tourist destinations, cities are continuing to grow and expand to attract tourists and natives alike."
