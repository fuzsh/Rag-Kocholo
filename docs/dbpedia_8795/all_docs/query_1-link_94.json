THE VISIGOTHS\n\nThey finally invaded Rome and that was the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was too big and divided into two, some Germanic tribes, called barbarians by Romans, moved into Roman territory. The Germanic tribes that entered Hispania were the Suevi, Alans and Vandals.Another Germanic tribe, the Visigoths, also came to the Iberian Peninsula and expelled the other barbarians (except the Suevi).\n\nA NEW KINGDOM APPEARS\n\nIn 589 AD, the Visigoths converted into Catholicism under the reign of Recaredo I.\n\nThe Visigoths finally established a kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula. Toletum (Toledo) became the capital city in 507 AD. They spoke Latin.\n\nVISIGOTHS\n\nBYE BYE VISIGOTHS\n\nIn 711 AD, Muslim armies from the north of Africa and the king Rodrigo fought them in the Battle of Guadalete. Visigoths were completely defeated and the capital was conquered. The Visigothic Kingdom of Toledo was over, but a few stayed strong in the north. The period of Al-Andalus has just begun.\n\nVisigoths made a lot of jewellery using gold and precious stones. They built small churches made of stone, with small windows and horseshoe arches.\n\nVISIGOTHIC ART\n\nIsidoro\n\nRodrigo\n\nRecaredo\n\nLeovigildo\n\nIMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE TIME\n\nVISIGOTHIC ART\n\nA PART OF A CALIPHATE\n\n2. AL-ÁNDALUS\n\nThis battle, won by Don Pelayo, is considered the start of the \"Reconquista\".\n\nMuslims defeated the Visigoths in 711 AD, so their territory, now called al-Ándalus, became part of the Caliphate of Damascus (or Omeya).Meanwhile the Moors conquered many cities (such as Zaragoza) a small group of visigoths continued fighting in the north. In 722 AD, muslims finally were defeated in the Battle of Covadonga.\n\nFIRST PROBLEMS\n\nIt was a very unstable period. Some Moors in Al-Andalus were against the new emir and rebelled.On the other side, the Christians saw Moors' weakness and took the chance by conquering many territories.\n\nAfter a coup, Abderramán, the last survivor of the Omeyas, run away and ended in Al-Ándalus.There, some loyal noblemen named him emir and in Al-Andalus he created an independent emirate in Córdoba.An emir was a ruler with the civic and military power. The religious power was owned by the caliph.\n\nMUSLIM CONQUEST\n\nGOLDEN AGE\n\nUnder his reign, Córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He made a palace known as the Medina Azahara, expanded the city's library and renovated the Mosque in Córdoba with Almanzor.\n\nIn 929 A.D., an emir called Abderramán III declared that Al-Andalus was an independent caliphate: the Córdoba Caliphate.\n\nART AND ARQUITECTURE\n\nRELIGION AND SOCIETY\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS AND LEGACY\n\nA CITY IN AL-ÁNDALUS\n\n3. LIFE IN AL-ÁNDALUS\n\nAverroes\n\nAbderramán III\n\nAbderramán I\n\nDon Pelayo\n\nIMPORTANT PEOPLE OF THE TIME\n\nA CITY IN AL-ÁNDALUS\n\nMuslims, Christians and Jews lived in peaceful coexistence together.However, Christians and Jews could practise their religion with some disadvantages: They had to pay special taxes, they had to wear a special badge, they had to obey Muslim laws....\n\nDuring Al-Ándalus period, the main religion was the Islam.Islam is a religion that began on the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century A.D. The followers of Islam are called Muslims. They believe in one god, Allah, and their sacred book is the Koran.\n\nRELIGION AND SOCIETY\n\nAL-ANDALUS SOCIETY\n\nBecause of these disadvantages, Christians could have the chance of changing their religion.When a Christian converted to Islam, it was called Muladi. If he lived in Muslim territory maintaining his faith, it was called Mozarab.\n\nART AND ARQUITECTURE\n\nMuslim arquitecture had some characteristics:Mathemathic perfection was seeked.Low height. More horizontal than vertical.Decoration using patterns and plants motifs.Lobed and horseshoe arches.\n\nWe can mainly find examples of muslim art in the arquitecture of alcázares and mosques. This is because in Islam, it wasn't allowed to represent religious characters in paints or sculpturesHowever we can find some examples of sculptures in \"The Patio of the Leones\" in Granada.\n\nMEZQUITA VR\n\nMEZQUITA\n\nMEZQUITA OF CÓRDOBA\n\nMUSIC AND DANCE\n\nLANGUAGE\n\nMATHEMATHICS\n\nFOOD AND FARMING\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS AND LEGACY\n\nWhat was life in al-Andalus like?\n\nMuslims, Christians and Jews lived in peaceful coexistence together. However, Christians and Jews could practise their religion with some disadvantages:— They could have a job, but they couldn't have authority over a Muslim.— They had to pay special taxes.— They had to wear a special badge.— They had to obey Muslim laws.- They couldn't carry weapons.Hence, Christians and Jews had fewer rights than Muslims.\n\nWhat was life in al-Andalus like?\n\nPeople\n\nMost people were farmers and agriculture was the most important economic activity. However, there were also artisans who made products such as textiles, leather goods and pottery. Merchants bought and sold these products in the souk.\n\nWhat was life in al-Andalus like?\n\nWhat did they do for a living?\n\nIt was a fortress.

A Visigoth noble called Don Pelayo was the Christian leader. Muslims were defeated. After this battle, Don Pelayo established the Kingdom of Asturias, which became the Kingdom of León after years.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms\n\nThe Battle of Covadonga\n\nSociety was divided into three groups: the clergy, nobles and peasants.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms\n\nSociety\n\nIn the monasteries, priests and monks copied and translated important books.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms\n\nClergy\n\nMaría de Molina presenta a su hijo Fernando IV en las Cortes de Valladolid de 1295.

There were two main styles of architecture: Romanesque and Gothic.\n\nThe Christian kingdoms\n\nBuildings\n\nChristian kingdoms expanded to the south because they wanted to recover the lands ruled by the Visigoths. Since al-Andalus was divided into small taifa kingdoms in the 11th century, the conquer was easier.\n\nThe Reconquista\n\nThe Reconquista\n\nIn 1212 the Christians won the Battle of Navas de Tolosa, in Jaén.\n\nDe Francisco de Paula Van Halen - Museo del Prado, Dominio público, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=75231086\n\nThe Reconquista\n\nBattles and important figures\n\nJaime I was king of Aragón.
