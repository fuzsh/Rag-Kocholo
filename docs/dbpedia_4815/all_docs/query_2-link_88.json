        "text": "Tapulous, part of Disney Mobile, released its music game \"Tap Tap Revenge 4\" for the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on Monday. With this update, the companies will also cross-promote their products via Disney and Tapulous apps.\n\nDisney recently released \"Tron: Legacy,\" a game app based on the movie of the same name. According to the AP, Tapulous games will be promoted in the Tron app and ads for Tron will appear in Tap Tap games. This is a strategy that Tapulous founders told the AP will help them stand out among Apple's more than 300,000 apps in the App Store.\n\n\"If you're not in the Top 100, if you're not featured by Apple, users don't know about you,\" Tapulous co-founder Bart Decrem told the AP. \"The only way to find out about an app is if they've heard of it, if they see it promoted, or if it's being promoted from one app to the other app. So building these networks of apps are really the strategy that we're all running towards.\"\n\n\"Tap Tap Revenge 4,\" meanwhile, is the first time \"Tap Tap Revenge\" has been updated since Disney acquired Tapulous in July. The free game features songs by popular artists like Katy Perry and Justin Timberlake, and players are awarded points when they tap along with the beat of the track. It also includes songs by Daft Punk from the \"Tron: Legacy\" soundtrack, deepening the partnership across different Disney-branded apps. Users have the option to add song bundles within the app.\n\n\"'Tap Tap Revenge 4' is a triumphant new addition to the hugely successful Tap Tap revenge franchise,\" Decrem said in a statement. \"Tap Tap Revenge has been a top ranked app over the past two holiday seasons, and this Christmas we're excited to offer fans and new players alike some great new features, awesome free tracks, and the ability to connect to Facebook and Twitter.\"\n\nDisney said that besides added social features, \"Tap Tap Revenge 4\" includes a new \"arcade-mode,\" high-resolution display, and Game Center integration.\n\nDisney's \"Tron\" is also the subject of Apple's first iAd for the iPad which was released last week."
