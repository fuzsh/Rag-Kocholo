        "text": "BURBANK, Calif. -- Disney says it is buying online social gaming company Playdom for more than $560 million. It's the latest sign the company is becoming a formidable player in the video game industry.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. said Tuesday it is buying Playdom to strengthen its digital gaming portfolio. Disney says the purchase will help bring its characters, stories and brands to customers in new ways, through Facebook and MySpace.\n\nPlaydom shareholders may also earn another $200 million if the company meets certain financial targets.\n\nMountain View, Calif.-based Playdom's games include \"Social City\" and \"Sorority Life.\"\n\nThe deal comes less than a month after Disney said it bought Tapulous, the maker of the popular iPhone music game \"Tap Tap Revenge.\""
