        "text": "An Australian entrepreneur living in Silicon Valley has just made a motza after Disney acquired his startup company, the leading game app maker for the iPhone and iPad.\n\nAndrew Lacy, from Melbourne, is the co-founder of Tapulous, which struck gold with its Tap Tap Revenge mobile music games.\n\nTap Tap Revenge is the most popular game series on the App Store, with over 35 million downloads and over a billion songs played.\n\nThere are versions for artists including Metallica, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and the Australian band Jet. A new game called Riddim Ribbon features The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nIt's a meteoric rise for Lacy, who founded the company with Bart Decrem in 2008. He will now join Disney as a senior VP on its mobile app development team.\n\nFinancial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but it's likely to be a significant windfall for Lacy, as the company's sales were $US1 million a month back in December 2009. A competitor, Playfish, was recently acquired by Electronic Arts for $US275 million in cash.\n\nLacy was unavailable for comment this morning but in an earlier email he said he spent \"most of my life in Melbourne and only moved to the US because I wanted a career as an entrepreneur\".\n\nHe previously worked for five years at McKinsey and Company in Australia, Asia and Europe, building internet businesses for several large corporations and advising telecommunication and media companies on digital distribution and content.\n\nLacy holds an MBA from Stanford university and Law and Commerce degrees from the University of Melbourne.\n\nDecrem said Tapulous had been on the leading edge of mobile gaming and \"by joining Disney, we will be able to continue to excel in this evolving industry and more quickly realize our vision to lead the mobile, social entertainment revolution\".\n\nWalt Disney Co. said it acquired Tapulous to bolster its ability to create mobile games and gain another toehold in Silicon Valley.\n\n\"It definitely is a strategic move and it highlights the importance we put on mobile,\" said Steve Wadsworth, president of Disney Interactive Media Group.\n\nTapulous's small staff will remain at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, which Wadsworth says is a benefit because it is in the high-tech developer community around San Francisco. Disney also owns Pixar Animation Studios."
