        "text": "A major update for the hugely popular iPhone rhythm game Tap Tap Revenge is awaiting approval from Apple and should be launching any minute now (or day, depending on Apple's mood) in the App Store, according to its developer Tapulous. What's new? Mainly, in-app purchases.\n\nDigital music enthusiasts should already be familiar with the idea after playing the hit console game Rock Band, which features a store selling songs for $2 a track. Tap Tap Revenge 3 will be selling songs for 50 cents each and will also distribute free tracks from indie artists.\n\nArtists selling songs through *Tap Tap Revenge 3 *include Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, The Killers and No Doubt. Each paid track will also come with its own theme to match the artist's music.\n\nAs for overall gameplay, not much has changed, but in social mode you can play online against friends. Playing in social mode you can grab goodies such as bombs and other weapons to mess with your opponent. You can also create your own profile and participate in a chat room.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 3 will cost $1 in the App Store when it launches. Have a favorite artist whose music you'd like to see in the game? Make a suggestion in the comments section below, and just maybe your wish will come true.
