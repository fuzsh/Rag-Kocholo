        "text": "Tap Tap Revenge 2 is the sequel to the popular game Tap Tap Revenge on iTunes. The game is much like a Guitar Hero game, but for iPhone and iPod Touch. With 150 three tracks, there are three colored dots the player has to press as they pass the white line near the bottom of the screen. Also there are arrows indicating which way to shake the device. In more difficult sections, Tap & Hold and Multi-Tap techniques are required.\n\nThe game offers three main modes: one player, two players and online play. There is also a very easy option for kids to play. In the Challenge mode players can set a score and then e-mail another player for them to beat the score. Their progress is then shown on a bar. Players can also earn achievements stored in a career menu."
