        "text": "ClubWorld\n\nTapulous, the developers of the Tap Tap Revenge series, has unveiled its first new app since being acquired by Disney last year. ClubWorld is a real-time social game in which players act as nightclub owners. Users hire bouncers, bartenders and can customize the club with their own style and music. That includes streaming music from iTunes and letting players buy/download music from iTunes within the app. The game features tracks by David Guetta and Tiesto. It sounds a lot like the Facebook game Nightclub City, but for the iPhone. The app lets club owners leave their venue and visit other establishments, choosing which to enter from a virtual “main street.” It also introduces users to each other through a matchmaking system based on each player’s music choices. And it has Tap Tap Revenge-like mini games to play within the virtual world. The app is free and available now.\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nOne of the more interactive ways artists can engage fans with their music on mobile devices is by offering the chance to remix it. And that’s what David Bowie is doing with a new app that will let fans remix the classic “Golden Years.” With help from original producer Harry Maslin, the iPhone app features eight tracks (stems) that users can either customize or create a random mix by just shaking the device. The resulting song can be saved as an MP3 and shared with friends. It is slated for release in June. The app is created by iKlax Media, which previously worked with Bowie on a similar remix app for “Space Oddity.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nInvisible Instrument\n\nIt’s not an available app, and may never be, but this is pretty cool regardless. Invisible Instrument is the winner of the most recent Music Hack Day in New York. Developer Tim Soo combined an iPhone with a Wii controller to put real music to the practice of air guitar. It plays drums, guitar, violin, piano and more. He’s even initiated a Kickstarter campaign to fund it for commercial use. Check out the demo video for the full experience."
