Ngmoco said in September that it would build Android versions of its most popular games, including Freeverse, Miraphonic and Stump Town. Eventually, Ngmoco's and DeNA's games will run on the single Mobage platform.\n\n\"In Ngmoco and its team, we see a lot of the same talent and dynamic traction that we have in the Japanese market, making the merger a perfect fit for us,\" Tomoko Namba, founder and chief executive of DeNA, said in a statement.\n\nNgmoco's social gaming network has more than 13.5 million registered users.\n\nNgmoco is the third deal involving DeNA and a U.S. company, according to the Bloomberg financial news agency. In September, DeNA bought mobile game-maker Gameview. Earlier this month, it purchased 20% of gaming network Aurora Feint, which claims to have more than 29 million users. As processing power and screen resolution increases, smartphones are challenging traditional video-game consoles in the casual gaming market. As a result, consolidation is ongoing in the mobile gaming industry.\n\nFor example, Walt Disney Co. in July acquired iPhone game developer Tapulous, which has become a part of Disney's Interactive Media Group. Financial details were not disclosed.\n\nIn August, social game developer Zynga acquired Unoh, a Japanese developer of social games, for an undisclosed amount. Zynga is the creator of the most popular games on Facebook, including Mafia Wars and Farmville.\n\nGames are the most popular downloads from mobile application stores provided by Apple and makers of Android handsets. Revenue from such online stores is expected to reach $6.8 billion worldwide this year, compared to $4.2 billion last year, according to Gartner.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nZynga Acquires Japanese Game Developer"
