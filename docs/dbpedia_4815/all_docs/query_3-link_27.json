        "text": "Disney Mobile?s Tapulous is marketing singer Katy Perry's new single \"Firework\" via a mobile application.\n\nThe \"Katy Perry Revenge by Bing\" game for iPhone and iPod touch features the latest single off Perry?s No. 1 album ?Teenage Dream,? one week prior to its radio debut. In Katy Perry Revenge by Bing players get to choose from four different Katy Perry inspired themes, and Bing, the decision engine from Microsoft, is integrated into the application so players can search for lyrics to Katy Perry songs.\n\n?Over the past few months the Bing team has been partnering with a number of companies on various apps for the iPhone, including the recent Katy Perry Revenge by Bing App with Tapulous,? said Wibe Wagemans, global marketing director, Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA.\n\n?Sponsoring apps similar to the Katy Perry Revenge by Bing, is another innovative way to introduce Bing to iPhone customers, encourage downloads of the Bing app and do it in a way that?s fun and engaging,? he said.\n\nDisney Mobile, a division of the Disney Interactive Media Group, is a mobile gaming and entertainment network, reaching more than one out of every three iPhone, iPod touch and iPad users.\n\nDisney branded applications include \"Disney Fairies Fly,\" \"Jelly Car 2\" and \"Toy Story 3.\" The applications bring Disney stories and characters to life in new ways on mobile devices.\n\nDisney Mobile?s Tapulous studio creates music and social applications including Tap Tap Revenge.\n\nKaty Perry?s Revenge targets teens\n\nKaty Perry iPhone App, is targeted towards the younger demographic, specifically age 17 and younger.\n\nThis is the first time Tapulous has included a title application sponsor, with Bing having signed on to bring fans of Katy Perry and Tap Tap Revenge this new game for free.\n\nMr. Wagemans said that Bing is proud to be associated with Katy Perry and Tap Tap Revenge.\n\nMusic and games are among the most popular categories of applications, and Microsoft is trying to show fans how Bing helps them make more informed decisions via its search experience.\n\nDisney Mobile?s goal is to continue to work with artists such as Katy Perry to create new and innovative ways for people to engage with their favorite music.\n\n?Katy Perry Revenge by Bing? is available for free in the App Store or at http://tapulous.com/redirect/katyperryfree.\n\n?Katy Perry Revenge by Bing is a great opportunity to bring a fantastic song and game to players for free, a full week before the new single hits the radio,? said Tim O?Brien, Palo Alto, CA-based vice president of business development at Disney Mobile. ?As the leader in music app games, we?re constantly looking for innovative ways to deliver our content to broader audiences and this sponsorship is a good example of that approach.\n\n?The target game demographic is teens, and all Katy Perry fans, which is fairly broad,? he said. ?We have a huge network of Tap Tap Revenge players with more than 35 million user on our platform, so we will promote Katy Perry Revenge by Bing to our network of players through in-game promos, an in-game contest and through Facebook and Twitter.\n\n?The Bing search engine is integrated into the game, allowing players to search for Katy Perry lyrics?additionally, Bing interstitials run in the game.?\n\nFinal Take\n\n/>"
