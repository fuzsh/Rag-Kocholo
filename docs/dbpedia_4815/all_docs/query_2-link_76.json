        "text": "Really, this is the moment iPhone developer Tapulous has been waiting for. It's free music/rhythm games have been mega-hits on the iPhone, with over five million downloads and about five trillion billion games played.\n\nIt's also shifted around 500,000 units of its various premium versions, but until the iPhone's 3.1 software was out there, Tapulous couldn't quite make the game it wanted: a version of Tap Tap Revenge that allowed you to purchase song packs from within the application.\n\nBut Tap Tap Revenge 3 should bring an end to those woes. Due on the App Store any minute now, this third game in the series is charged at 59p - an obligatory, minimal cost required by Apple so Tapulous can include microtransactions within the game.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 3 will allow you to purchase premium song packs (expected to cost around £1.99 for the six pack, and 59p for the two track packs), as well as delivering over 100 free tracks from the outset for you to tap along to.\n\nIn an interview on TUAW, Tapulous COO Andrew Lacy says, \"For the most part, people are going to get what they did in the past and then more.\"\n\nHe continues, \"The first big change was more music, and the next big change is that we believe that we have a really great [online] experience.\n\n\"We've added a whole bunch of arcade features, which include the ability to throw bombs at your opponent, or sort of unseat them in various ways, we have six or seven different weapons that are included. So... the online gameplay has become much more addictive and much more social.\"\n\nMusic is a social experience, so it makes sense that Tapulous has made a big effort in Tap Tap Revenge 3 to expand on the connected gameplay.\n\nTUAW also provided a complete list of premium song packs that'll be available when Tap Tap Revenge 3 goes live today. So get your knuckles cracked and your headphones ready.\n\nPremium 6-track bundles available at launch:\n\nBLINK 182 - \"Adam's Song\" / \"All the Small Things\" / \"Dammit\" / \"First Date\" / \"The Rock Show\" / \"What's My Age Again\"\n\nFALL OUT BOY - \"Thanks for the Memories\" / \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" / \"Dance, Dance\" / \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" / \"I Don't Care\" / \"American Suitehearts\"\n\nFOO FIGHTERS - \"The Pretender\" / \"Wheel\" / \"My Hero\" / \"Best of You\" / \"Monkey Wrench\" / \"All My Life\"\n\nTHE KILLERS - \"Mr. Brightside\" / \"Sweet Talk\" / \"Human\" / \"When We Were Young\" / \"All These Things That I've Done\" / \"Read My Mind\"\n\nNO DOUBT - \"Ex-Girlfriend\" / \"Don't Speak\" / \"Hella Good\" / \"Just A Girl\" / \"Spiderwebs\" / \"Hey Baby\"\n\nSMASHING PUMPKINS - \"Tonight\" / \"Cherub Rock\" / \"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\" / \"Today\" / \"Tarantulla\" / \"1979\"\n\nTIËSTO - \"Fresh Fruit\" / \"Ten Seconds to Sunrise\" / \"Driving To Heaven\" / \"Knock You Out\"(feat.
