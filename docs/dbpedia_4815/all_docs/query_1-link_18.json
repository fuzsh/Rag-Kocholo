        "text": "It’s confirmed: Tap Tap Revenge developer Tapulous has been acquired by Disney. Still no word on sale price, but the smartphone game developer is officially joining the Disney Mobile team, which is part of the Disney Interactive Media Group.\n\nCEO Bart Decrem will remain with the team as GM of Disney Mobile, reporting to Disney Interactive Media Group president Steve Wadsworth. Tapulous COO Andrew Lacy stays on as senior VP, with Tim O’Brien becoming VP of business development and Jessica Kahn VP of engineering.\n\nTapulous is known for creating several popular iPhone music games. The flagship is Tap Tap Revenge, now in its third iteration. The game is free, but sells downloadable songs as add-ons. It also created multiple artist-based versions of Tap Tap Revenge, including those based on Lady Gaga, Kings of Leon and most recently, Nickelback.\n\nEarlier this year, it created a new music game with Wil.i.am called Riddim Ribbon, and created a iPad version of Tap Tap Revenge called Tap Tap Radiation. And last month, it forged a deal with Warner Music Group to sell music through various Tap Tap Revenge games. Its various games have been downloaded 15 million times.\n\nAccording to Decrem, the acquisition will have not impact on its music-game activities.\n\n“We’re going to keep investing in Tap Tap Revenge, but also do other titles,” he tells Billboard. “Disney is probably second to none when it comes to building hugely compelling global brands. As part of Disney, we’re going to be looking to make Tap Tap Revenge that much bigger.”\n\nDisney has dabbled in mobile games, moving around 1 million apps in the last year based on its various content. The addition of Tapulous vastly expands its mobile development capabilities. Disney recently bought social gaming company Playdom for $33 million."
