        "text": "Among the talk of rising app prices on iPad, and concerns over what this will mean for the inferior iPhone versions, it's heartening to see there are still developers prepared to produce cheap, or even free launch games.\n\nTapulous, creators of the hit Tap Tap Revenge series, is just such a company, and has announced its iPad exclusive sequel Tap Tap Radiation. But Tapulous isn't just knocking out a quick port – despite the game being free, it has been rebuilt as a bespoke title.\n\nClap your hands\n\nAs players will have both hands free this time around, gameplay is more involved. Glowing orbs move across the screen, and must be rhythmically tapped in time with the music.\n\nBest of all, multiple players can join in at once.\n\nThe game will launch with eight tunes from Serge Devant, Richard Vission, Mos Def and The Features, and it also provides in-app purchases for premium tunes from the likes of Lady Gaga and Pink.\n\nHaving not yet played the game ourselves, we can’t speculate on its success, but if Tapulous’s track record - over 30 million downloads to-date - is anything to go by, this should be an instant hit."
