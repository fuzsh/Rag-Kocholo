        "text": "Tim O’Brien serves as Chief Revenue Officer of Scopely, one of the fastest-growing mobile games companies in the West. Scopely creates and publishes a highly-diverse, top-grossing games slate, including the award-winning MARVEL Strike Force, Scrabble® GO, Star Trek™ Fleet Command and YAHTZEE® With Buddies, among many others. Fueled by a world-class team, Scopely leverages its proprietary technology platforms to bring directed-by-consumer, interactive experiences to audiences around the globe.\n\nWith more than two decades of experience at both high-growth startups and major media companies, Tim joined Scopely in 2014 to further expand the company’s global strategic partnerships and help redefine its publishing model. Since then, Tim has exponentially expanded Scopely’s external relationships with platforms, IP holders and studios, and has driven the growth of its ads business, corporate and business development, marketing and creative, user acquisition and business affairs functions, among many other contributions. In 2019, he was recognized as a “Dealmaker of the Year” by Variety and joined the Scopely Board of Directors in early 2020.\n\nPrior to Scopely, Tim served as Vice President of Worldwide Business Development at Disney Interactive, where he oversaw business development, distribution, network operations and ad sales for a large slate of mobile, console and online digital properties. He launched some of the division’s most successful franchises including Disney Infinity, Where’s My Water, Marvel: Avengers Alliance and Club Penguin—helping establish the brand as a world-class publisher. Earlier in his career, Tim served as Vice President of Business Development at Tapulous, which was acquired by The Walt Disney Company during his tenure. Tim built the Tapulous business from the ground up, driving partnerships and content for its leading game Tap Tap Revenge. Prior to Tapulous, Tim served as Vice President of Business Development at Gydget (previously known as Attendio), one of the first companies to build a product on the Facebook platform. Prior to Gydget, Tim was Director of Business Development at StubHub where he created the industry’s first market-driven auction.\n\nTim holds a B.S. in Business from the University of California, Berkeley and began his career in concert promotions and artist management."
