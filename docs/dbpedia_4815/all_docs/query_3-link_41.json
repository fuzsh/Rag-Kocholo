Consider some of the most popular games – Tapulous for example. The game is nothing new, but imagine doing the tapping with your mouse. Not all that enticing. But with your fingers, it takes on a different meaning.\n\nThe accelerometer is also part of the new user interface.\n\nTherefore, here at InfoBeans iPhone development practice, we are focussed on incorporating some really cool and cutting edge user interface choices. We focus a lot on making our apps not just user friendly, but striving to surprise the user with some user interface designs.\n\nThat does not mean our apps do not have a solid back end. That for us, is a given. The user interface is where we can make a difference."
