        "text": "Perhaps not most smalltime guys, but I would think that major development companies don't like Apple's tax at all.\n\nFor example, companies like Sling and TomTom usually sold their apps through their own websites. Their apps are popular enough for people to seek out on their own.\n\nPerhaps not, but it's quite simple: if a developer doesn't like the deal, then don't develop for the iPhone.\n\nIf I were a big software house I'd be pissed too, but seeing as how 70% is better than 0%, and companies like this Tapulous are bringing in 12mil a year, it's not such a bad deal.\n\nIt depends on how much development time is spent. Either it's worth your time or it isn't. If your app generates 12mil in revenue a year, you get 8.4mil of it, but your development costs are 15mil, then clearly it's not a good investment of time.\n\nBut somehow I doubt it costs them that much to develop an iPhone app.\n\nIf I were a big software house I'd be pissed too, but seeing as how 70% is better than 0%, and companies like this Tapulous are bringing in 12mil a year, it's not such a bad deal.\n\nIt's not a good deal either, since that would mean they're paying 5 million a year to Apple.\n\nThere's also the problem of having to wait for Apple to approve an app and its updates. That results in lost revenue as well. Not to mention watering down the app itself at times, such as with the crippling of Slingplayer to only work on WiFi.\n\nIs it better than nothing? Sometimes. Better than not having an Apple tax? No way. Large companies should be able to distribute their app on their own, if they wish.\n\nIt's ironic that Jobs made fun of the carrier walled app gardens ... since it turns out that he simply wanted to own such a garden himself.\n\nTest of social skills\n\nAfter the final exam next month, maybe I'll do a dee research on the average revenue of developers on the app store, iTunes itself already hold the information we need\n\nWhile I'm sure that everyone who has an app on the store has good technical skills, it is ones social, interpersonal skills that makes the sales. If you have a brilliant app that is not selling well, you are not communicating how great it is to your market.\n\nI have no sympathy for those that write great apps and then ignore the public only to move on to their next great technical conquest. If you are a solo, independent developer, you should have at most one third -- yes one third! -- of your time to coding and other technical issues. The rest needs to be advertising, promotions and -- shudder! -- public gatherings to show off your app.\n\nI've been to many developer conferences and I can always spot those who's apps are not selling well from just how they work or don't work the crowd. A simple ad on a web site or in a magazine for your app can create a boost in sales.\n\nIn summary: poor sales = poor social skills\n\nThis also leads to why a lot of developers can't get dates!\n\nIt's not a good deal either, since that would mean they're paying 5 million a year to Apple.\n\nThere's also the problem of having to wait for Apple to approve an app and its updates.

For them I think the 30% is more than worth it and a great way to get their app out in front of millions that they couldn't do before.\n\nI do agree with you to an extent, I think large developers are hit from the 30% compared to a small dev who might not have the marketing presence but gets into the top 10 and starts to get the exposure they might not have received before. For them I think the 30% is more than worth it and a great way to get their app out in front of millions that they couldn't do before.\n\nI totally agree with you that it's a good deal for small developers.\n\nHeck, when I was selling personal computer apps back in the 1980s, developers only got 15-30%. Of course, there was physical media involved and actual mailing\n\nI would beg to differ. If your an excessively smart person in your field, then success is not pure chance.\n\nTrue, but success is not guaranteed in that case either. You still have to sell your skills or products.\n\nI'm surprised about the comments people make about the 30/70 split between Apple and developers. It's almost like no one on this board remembers (knows) what it's like (or used to be like) to get your software on a retail store shelf.\n\nWhen I was the buyer for a small, independently owned retail computer store back in the mid to late nineties, all of our software and supplies were purchased from a distributor like Ingram/Micro D. The distributors supplied a catalog of products they distributed and you would pick and chose the products you wanted to stock. If one distributor didn't have a product you wanted, you shopped another distributor. If the product was available from multiple distributors, you contact the buyer and negotiate the best deal you could get. Margins on software was typically between 25 and 50%. The larger your store, the more buying power you had, the better your margins. Our store typically dealt with 2-3 primary distributors for all the product we had to sell. We dealt with the hardware companies like Apple and IBM directly. Occasionally, we were prohibited from buying certain software applications because of requirements by the vender (a grey market for these products developed because of this).\n\nIf a small startup company, say Quark, wanted to sell their new desktop publishing application to us (we had our store in Boulder), the president or vice president would come by after jumping through a few of our hoops, to give us a demo, tell us about their promotions, give us demo copies, offer to train our sales reps, negotiate margins, offer exclusivity deals, and set up buying terms (we order the product, get net 60 and get to return unsold product after so many months). More often than not, we told them we were interested but only if they could negotiate a deal with one of our distributors because, our buying power, terms, bills we had to pay, all made it easier to deal with just a few distributors rather directly with the companies themselves. Fundamentally, getting your product on a store shelf hasn't changed much since those days. It is still basically the same where I used to work at Microcenter but the number of brick and mortar/Mom & Pop stores isn't what it used to be in the 80's and 90's. In fact, it's probably even more competitive now than it every used to be.\n\nThe bottom line, not even considering all the hoops a developer has to jump through for this, they are going to give up upwards of 60% of the retail cost of the product just to get it into a distributor. They'll have to have financing to do that, manufacturing and customer returns to deal with as well. There is a lot more infrastructure costs by far than those dealing with a 30/70 split with Apple. I'm just surprised no one else though about it sooner."
