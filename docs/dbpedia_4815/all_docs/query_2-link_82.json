        "text": "Here’s a cluster of four reviews, but they are very similar games. You may be familiar with the Tap Tap Revenge series by Tapulous since they had a large amount of success back a few years ago, and are still popping out new games very often. I’ll first give a bit of background on the series installments and features before I get into the gameplay. There are four main Tap Tap Revenge games, creatively named Tap Tap Revenge, Tap Tap Revenge 2, Tap Tap Revenge 3, and Tap Tap Revenge 4. The following one is named Tap Tap Revenge Tour, and I have never tried it because, frankly I got bored of these extremely similar games. All of the ones mentioned are free, with the exception of Tap Tap Revenge 3, which costs $1.99. Unfortunately, Tap Tap Revenge (2008) and Tap Tap Revenge 2 (2009) are no longer available for download, but if you already own them you’re fine. This franchise was extremely successful back in the early days because it provided an iOS equivalent of the famed Guitar Hero franchise. Nowadays, I think they’ve gone a bit too far with the new additions, which tend to stick to one artist or one genre. For example, new ones include Dance, Lady Gaga, Metallica, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Justin Bieber, and Green Day, just to name a few. These ones tend to be priced at $4.99, which might be a high price, but you must factor in the fact that you’re getting all this quality music that would normally cost much more. Tap Tap Radiation ($2.99), which is exclusively for the iPad has some pretty cool features to fit the bigger screen, but I don’t know much else about it. The more recent ones, like everything beyond Tap Tap Revenge 3, make the game much more social with an account and friend requests, an avatar, and a “level-up” system. At first, I did not like this at all, but the more I think about it, it’s a pretty good way to link all these various games together for those avid Tap Tap fans. Besides, I guess they had to keep up with the times.\n\nToday, I’m just going to provide some details for the first four installments, which are the only ones that I own:\n\nTap Tap Revenge: This game from 2008 started it all and boosted Tapulous to huge success and fame. As I mentioned, it’s an antique now, but still worthwhile to detail. This game has the majority of the features of all the rest, so I’ll discuss gameplay here. Just like Guitar Hero, Tap Tap Revenge plays a song and makes you tap colored “strums” to go along with it. There are three lanes (red, green, and blue). You watch these circles flow down the screen and when they reach the bottom, you must tap them as precisely as possible. There are a variety of games, which you’ll see become standard to the series: One-player, Two-player, and Online play, and each of these break down into Easy, Medium, Hard, and Extreme. There are very few tracks, and you may download more, however they shut down the servers for this one, so no new songs anymore.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 2: The sequel to the most downloaded free game of 2008 took an awesome game and improved it a bit more. The whole game is basically the same with new songs (same situation with the downloadable tracks, although this one had many more songs to start with), updated sleek looks, and the introduction of two pretty large elements into mainstream gameplay: sustained notes and tilts. Although these were present in the prequel, they were not in abundance. 2 puts some arrows down the lanes that require you to tilt your device in that direction at the right moment. In effort to make Tap Tap Revenge 2 more sustainable, a Career was added in which you just get check marks next to achievements. Nothing much, but a nice addition. These servers were shut down too to make users switch to the newer installments.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 3: This one costs two dollars and did introduce drastic changes, however not much to the gameplay. As always, new tracks were added and the design of the game was upgraded to a more sleek color scheme and look. But the real difference comes with the social aspect of this game. It requires people to create a Tapulous account with an avatar. Playing more gets you coins that can be used to purchase items for your avatar or more tracks. Experience points allow players to level-up. You can friend other users and chat with them.\n\nTap Tap Revenge 4: This installment finally adds some Retina graphics to the game, and they’re really nice looking. Besides newer songs and making you purchase song packs with real money, Tap Tap 4 doesn’t make many drastic changes.\n\nAnd it is for this reason that I don’t care for the rest of the series. After a while, you just can’t keep making simple updates under the name of a whole new app. I’m sure Tour and all the rest of them are great games, but I think the time for Tapulous has come and gone. Nevertheless, these games are considered classics on my iPhone and will always hold some memory of mine to keep them around. It’s a great series (a bit overdone) but if you have not tried them, I suggest acquiring the Tap Tap Revenge 4 or Tour, as they are both free.\n\n-TheAppEmperor *rocking* out"
