Through this deal, Tapulous founders, Bart Decrem and Andrew Lacy, as well as their development team in Palo Alto, California, will be joining DIMG’s mobile content group.\n\nDecrem and Lacy, previously CEO and COO of Tapulous, will now take on the leadership roles for the Disney mobile group with Decrem reporting to Disney president Steve Wadsworth.\n\nWadsworth says, \"Mobile gaming is seeing unprecedented growth and this is the right time to invest to strengthen our position in the mobile business. In a short time, Bart and Andrew have built Tapulous into a successful and accomplished mobile games developer that’s emerged as one of the most successful companies in the industry. We welcome the Tapulous team to the Disney family and look forward to integrating their popular games into Disney’s offerings.”\n\nDisney says that it has enjoyed many successes in its mobile business counting several “platinum” performing apps with more than one million downloads including Disney’s Alice in Wonderland Lite, Fairies Fly Lite and JellyCar 2, which is Disney’s most successful premium game in the app store to date."
