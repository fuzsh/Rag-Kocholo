        "text": "The Walt Disney Co. confirmed late Thursday that it had acquired Tapulous, the developer of the wildly popular \"Tap Tap Revenge\" and other games for the Apple iOS platform.\n\nThe deal was reported earlier by Mashable and TechCrunch. A Tapulous representative confirmed the transaction, but without disclosing the terms of the deal.\n\nTapulous will be a a wholly owned subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company reporting into Disney Interactive Media Group (DIMG). Tapulous founder and chief executive Bart Decrem, as well as chief operating officer Andrew Lacy, will join DIMG's mobile content group.\n\n\"As part of Disney Interactive Media Group, we'll develop more games, more quickly and with the resources of the world's leading entertainment company,\" Decrem wrote in a blog post. \"We will continue to develop apps that live at the intersection of music and gaming, but we'll also push into new and exciting areas of mobile social entertainment. We're literally bursting with ideas for new apps!\"\n\nTapulous is known for its \"Tap Tap Revenge\" app for the iOS platform, featuring moving icons that users must tap in rhythm. The application is modeled after \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and other rhythm games, but within the constraints of a touchscreen. Over a billion songs have been played within the \"Tap Tap\" framework, according to the company, and the \"Tap Tap Revenge\" app has been downloaded over 35 million times, Decrem claimed.\n\nBut the developers have also created custom versions of the app for Nickelback, Lady Gaga, and Justin Bieber, and some fans seemed genuinely concerned that a Miley Cyrus version would be forthcoming.\n\n\"Mobile gaming is seeing unprecedented growth and this is the right time to invest to strengthen our position in the mobile business,\" said DIMG president Steve Wadsworth, in a statement. \"In a short time, Bart and Andrew have built Tapulous into a successful and accomplished mobile games developer that's emerged as one of the most successful companies in the industry. We welcome the Tapulous team to the Disney family and look forward to integrating their popular games into Disney's offerings.\""
