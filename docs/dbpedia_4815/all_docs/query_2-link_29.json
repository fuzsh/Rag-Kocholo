Well, Disney has evidently been keeping an eye on the developer of those games, Tapulous, because it's gone and struck a deal to make the company a wholly-owned subsidiary. (Financial details of the deal have not been disclosed.)\n\nTapulous founders Bart Decrem and Andrew Lacy will take on new -- yet still key -- roles within the Disney Interactive Media Group. As for the Tapulous development staff, they're staying put, but will be required to wear comically large white gloves from now on. (We kid. Hopefully.)\n\nSteve Wadsworth, president of DIMG, commented on the deal, saying, \"We welcome the  Tapulous team to the Disney family and look forward to integrating their  popular games into Disney's offerings.\" Yes, Tapulous will keep making games for iDevices -- they'll just probably feature more anthropomorphic animals.",

Wednesday's consumer price index showed a moderate rise in July with the annual increase in U.S. inflation slowing below 3% for the first time in nearly 3-1/2 years. Following the July CPI data, the question investors seemed to be debating was not whether the Fed would cut rates at its Sept. 17 to 18 meeting, but by how much.\n\nGlobeNewswire\n\nGrant of Incentive Subscription Rights in IDEX Biometrics 14 Aug 2024\n\nThe board of directors of IDEX Biometrics ASA resolved on 14 August 2024 to issue 84,800 incentive subscription rights to a new individual contractor of IDEX Biometrics. The grant was made under the Company's 2024 Subscription rights plan. The exercise price of the subscription rights is NOK 1.37 per share, they vest by 25% per year, and will expire on 16 May 2029.
