        "text": "Tapulous is stepping it up a few notches, launching two new games for the iPhone, Tap Tap Dance and Christmas with Weezer.\n\nTap Tap Dance is a new for-pay version of the free Tap Tap Revenge game. It uses all the advanced features of the iPhone, including OpenGL for advanced graphics effects, and Tapulous is proud of the artists it has lined up to take advantage of the app, said CEO Bart Decrem. It features music from Justice, Moby, Daft Punk and Soul Magic Orchestra, among others.\n\nTapulous was founded in January for the sole purpose of creating great iPhone apps, according to Decrem. Tap Tap Revenge, which he describes as a simple music game, attracted 3 million unique users.\n\nWeezer recorded six songs exclusively for the Christmas with Wheezer app. The only way people can get the songs is through the app. The games cost $4.99 each.\n\nFuture developments could include developing for the Android platform or the Research In Motion (RIM) Storm, but Decrem said so far, Apple’s iPhone model is the most mature and has the most momentum. “We don’t know yet how well these other devices will do,” he said.\n\nHe said Apple currently offers a great device, a rich developer environment, a critical mass of engaged users and a distribution channel to bring the apps to market. “The iPhone is the one that excels at all four,” he said, and with a staff of eight, the company needs to focus its energy in the most promising area.\n\nTapulous’ games also work on the iPod Touch.\n\nFiled Under: Infrastructure"
