        "text": "Celebrities can get rich, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're good with money or that they'll always have wealth at their fingertips. Many well-known stars have had to declare bankruptcy.\n\nSonja Morgan of \"Real Housewives of New York City\" (seen here on \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\") is one of the many stars who has experienced financial trouble.\n\nWhich actors, musicians, comedians, athletes, and other entertainers have had fame without the fortune? Quite a few. For the record, we only counted celebrities who filed for personal bankruptcy, so celebrity-fronted businesses aren't included here.\n\nAlex Jones\n\nInfoWars founder Alex Jones filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2022, citing nearly $1.5 billion worth of debt. A court had ordered Jones to pay hundreds of millions in damages to the parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. Jones had repeatedly referred to the mass shooting as a \"hoax.\"\n\nAttorneys for the Sandy Hook families called the bankruptcy filing \"cowardly,\" but Jones says he will prove that he doesn't have any money. According to the filing, his assets are between $1 million and $10 million.\n\nTodd Chrisley\n\nTodd Chrisley of \"Chrisley Knows Best\" may not know best when it comes to finances. In August 2012, the business executive filed for bankruptcy, claiming $49.4 million in debt.\n\nTwo years later, his family got a reality show about its lavish lifestyle.\n\nIn 2019, Chrisley and wife Julie were indicted on tax evasion, bank fraud, and wire fraud charges. They were convicted and sentenced to 12 and 7 years in prison, respectively, in November 2022. \"Chrisley Knows Best\" was canceled.\n\nTeresa and Joe Giudice\n\nTeresa and Joe Giudice were first featured on \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" in 2009, the same year they filed for bankruptcy. They claimed they were nearly $11 million in debt. In 2013, they were charged for attempting to defraud lenders and hiding income during their bankruptcy. They both served prison time.\n\nToday, the Giudices are divorced. Joe was deported to his native Italy, and Teresa is remarried to Luis Ruelas.\n\nSonja Morgan\n\nTeresa Giudice isn't the only member of the \"Real Housewives\" family with financial issues. RHONY cast member Sonja Morgan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010 after divorcing her husband. She reportedly stated that she owed $19.8 million to creditors and had $13.5 million in assets.\n\nMorgan settled her debt in 2015.\n\nPK and Dorit Kemsley\n\nPaul \"PK\" and Dorit Kemsley of \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" fame also ran into financial (and legal) troubles. PK filed for personal bankruptcy in 2012 in the U.K., but a New York court ordered that his case be transferred to the U.S., since it's his primary residence.\n\nHe married Dorit in 2015. The drama has been ongoing. Fellow RHOBH castmate Camille Grammer confronted Dorit about her husband's debts in one contentious 2019 episode.\n\nAbby Lee Miller\n\nLifetime's show \"Dance Moms\" centered around Abby Lee Miller, the owner and instructor at a popular Pennsylvania dance studio.

Miller was released from prison in early 2018.\n\nAaron Carter\n\nThe late Aaron Carter once filed for personal bankruptcy in 2013, claiming to be $2 million in debt.

His financial troubles stemmed from the production of his 1982 musical film \"One From the Heart,\" which was a flop. Coppola had funded the movie with his own money.\n\nHe eventually paid off his debts, but Coppola is still funding his own projects, like the drama \"Megalopolis\" for which he spent $100 million.\n\nToni Braxton\n\nToni Braxton filed for bankruptcy twice: once in 1998 and again in 2010, when she claimed debts between $10 million and $50 million.\n\nIn an interview, Braxton said her her first bankruptcy was due to a spending addiction, but that the second occurred when she canceled her self-funded Vegas show after receiving a diagnosis of microvascular angina, which causes chest pain.\n\nBurt Reynolds\n\nBurt Reynolds has been a successful star, but after his marriage to actress Lori Anderson ended in an expensive divorce (combined with an extravagant lifestyle) he declared bankruptcy in 1996 with $11.2 million in debt.\n\nThe actor got himself out of bankruptcy two years later, but had ongoing financial issues. Reynolds died from cardiac arrest in September 2018, at the age of 82.\n\n50 Cent\n\nCurtis Jackson, better known by stage name 50 Cent, rose to fame with his album \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'.\" He certainly got rich, but in July 2015, the rapper filed for personal bankruptcy for debts between $10 million and $50 million.\n\nHis bankruptcy ended a year later with a payout of $23 million.\n\nYoung Buck\n\nDavid \"Young Buck\" Brown is a rapper who filed for bankruptcy first in 2010, and then again in 2020.\n\nThe hip-hop star owed money to not only to G-Unit Records, but also its co-founder, Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson. Brown has blamed Jackson for his bankruptcy.\n\nDina Lohan\n\nDina Lohan, mom to actress Lindsay Lohan, filed for bankruptcy in 2018 to save her family home.

But thanks to a lavish lifestyle, he was forced to file for bankruptcy in 2003 with a debt of around $23 million.\n\nTyson has since recouped his losses, thanks in part to taking on Hollywood film roles and a successful cannabis brand, Tyson 2.0.\n\nCyndi Lauper\n\nBefore she was a solo artist, Cyndi Lauper was in a band called Blue Angels. In 1980, the band's manager, Steve Massarsky, sued Lauper for $80,000.
