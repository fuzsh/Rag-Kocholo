        "text": "Nine voices weave a complex tapestry of horror and hope in an all-too-believable dystopian future. All the different narrators are somewhat confusing at first. However, they soon hit their stride and become an unparalleled cast. By 2140, sea levels have risen 50 feet. New York is still a vibrant city with horribly uneven income distribution, and all the angst that goes with it. The wonderful narrator Robert Blumenfeld often introduces whatever main character is featured at the time. This works beautifully to tie together the many characters and the voices that portray them. All the voices are distinctive and compelling--from the parentless urchins to the tough female cop and a dozen others. M.C.
