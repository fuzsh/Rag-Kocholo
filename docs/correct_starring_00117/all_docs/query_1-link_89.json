Recently tributed by Greta Gerwig in the highly memorable opening sequence of Barbie, 2001 looks at the evolution of the human race over millions of years, starting with a prehistoric encounter with a mysterious monolith. The film is available to stream on Max. – Matt Grobar\n\nBARBARELLA (1968)\n\nThe original Barbarella (1968) starring Jane Fonda, John Phillip Law, Anita Pallenberg and Mil O’Shea in addition to others involves the top secret mission of Barbarella (Fonda) to stop The Great Tyrant (Pallenberg) and her Concierge (O’Shea) who threaten to make space evil once more.

The thrilling film is available to stream on Max. – Dessi Gomez\n\nSPACEBALLS (1987)\n\nGiven the recent news of a sequel to team Josh Gad, Mel Brooks, and director Josh Greenbaum, there can be no greater time to revisit this classic parody co-written, directed and produced by Brooks. Lampooning space operas, and the Star Wars franchise in particular, the film follows the adventures of the mercenary Lone Starr and his sidekick Barf as they attempt to rescue Princess Vespa from the evil clutches of Dark Helmet and the sinister Spaceballs, who are plotting to steal all the air from her home planet. Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Daphne Zuniga were among the stars of this beloved send-up of sci-fi tropes.

The film, which told the true life story of how NASA made a heroic effort to bring Apollo 13 back to earth safely, not only smashed box-office records, it would also go on to land seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Apollo 13 is available to rent on Apple TV+, Prime Video, Fandango at Home and more. – Justin Kroll\n\nFROM EARTH TO THE MOON (1998)\n\nBefore HBO and Playtone captivated us with its World War II mini-series ‘Band of Brothers,’ they were blowing audiences minds with this 1998 NASA origin tale. The scope and attention to detail to this incredible story set the stage for those groundbreaking mini-series HBO is known for while also giving us a detail story of how the space race came to be. Yes, this one’s technically a miniseries, but it deserves to be in here. The series is available to stream on Max. – Justin Kroll\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nPixar’s take on a love story between two robots gives hope for the future and climate change as Wall-E — a trash-cube maker, holds onto a sapling sprouting in a boot for Eve (Extra-Terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator). Hopefully we don’t get to the point where this film’s premise becomes a reality. Wall-E is streaming on Disney+. – Dessi Gomez\n\nGRAVITY (2013)\n\nBefore Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar, there was Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.
