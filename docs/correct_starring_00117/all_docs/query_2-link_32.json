        "text": "Every once in a while, you discover that you’ve actually been saying a word wrong your entire life and you can’t believe you never knew. Names can be especially tricky to pronounce, and it turns out, we mess up the pronunciation of celebrity names all the time.\n\nThese are some of the most common celebrity names everyone mispronounces according to BuzzFeed, and the right way to say them.\n\nChappell Roan – The singer’s name may look like it should be “Sha-pell,” but it’s actually “Chap-uhl,” like the church. And her last name is “Rone.”\n\nTravis Kelce – In an episode of their “New Heights” podcast, Travis, his brother, Jason, and their dad, Ed, revealed that their last name, which is commonly pronounced “Kel-see” is really supposed to be a single syllable, “Kels.” The brothers and their mom have always said “Kel-see” and only recently learned that was technically incorrect.\n\nHozier – The Irish musician’s name is pronounced like cozier, but with an H, so it’s “Ho-zee-ur.”\n\nAnya Taylor-Joy – The actress says her first name “Anne-ya,” not “Aun-ya,” but she admits that she struggles to correct people’s pronunciation and even once filmed a whole movie before telling the director they’d been saying her name incorrectly the entire time.\n\nPaul Mescal – People often pronounce the Irish actor’s last name like the drink Mezcal, but it’s supposed to be “Mes-cuhl.”\n\nKeleigh Teller – The first name of one of Taylor Swift’s besties and Miles Teller’s wife is a lot more simple than people think, it’s pronounced “Kelly.”\n\nTove Lo – The Swedish singer’s name is often said “Tove-low,” but it’s actually “Too-veh-loo.”\n\nJake Gyllenhaal – We all think his last name is “Gill-en-hall,” but it’s Swedish and the correct pronunciation is “Yee-len-hyaal.”\n\nSteve Buscemi – The actor says he doesn’t correct people if they say his last name “Bu-shem-ee,” but he says it “Boo-sem-ee,” and he’s revealed that the proper Sicilian pronunciation should be “Boo-shay-me.”\n\nFlorence Pugh – Some people say the actress’ last name like the dog breed “pug,” but in a tweet, she reveals that it’s actually “like if you were pretending to have a shoot out and you make all the noises yourself … pew PEW pew pew.”\n\nLauRen Merola Strager is a former NFL & NBA cheerleader turned radio host.
