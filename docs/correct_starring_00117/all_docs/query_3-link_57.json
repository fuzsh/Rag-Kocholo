        "text": "Role in the film: Rose DaSilva\n\nBrief biography:\n\nRadha Mitchell was most recently seen in the critically acclaimed starring role of ‘Melinda’ in Woody Allen’s film Melinda and Melinda, opposite Will Ferrell.\n\nPrior to that she was seen in Finding Neverland, for which she and her co-stars Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet and Dustin Hoffman were nominated for a Screen Actors Guild ensemble award. The film was directed by Marc Forster (Monster’s Ball), with whom she worked in 2000 when she starred and produced the Independent Spirit Award-nominated film Everything Put Together.\n\nIn 2004, Mitchell starred opposite Denzel Washington in Man on Fire, playing the mother of a missing child who had been kidnapped. She starred opposite Colin Farrell in Joel Shumacher's Phone Booth and in the box-office hit Pitch Black opposite Vin Diesel. The actress gave a memorable performance as Syd, the young editorial assistant who falls in love with Ally Sheedy's heroin-addicted photographer character in Lisa Cholodenko's critically acclaimed drama High Art. Her role in Emma-Kate Croghan's romantic comedy Love and Other Catastrophes was highly praised at both the Cannes and Sundance film festivals.\n\nOther recent film credits include When Strangers Appear with Josh Lucas, the independent feature Dead Heat opposite Keifer Sutherland and Anthony LaPaglia, Nobody’s Baby with Gary Oldman and Skeet Ulrich, and Rodrigo Garcia's Ten Tiny Love Stories. On television, she starred with Hank Azaria and Donald Sutherland in NBC's critically acclaimed mini-series Uprising for director Jon Avnet Mitchell recently finished shooting two starring roles for release next year; PU 239 opposite Paddy Considine and Rogue which is directed by Wolf Creek’s Greg MacLean She will next be seen in Mozart and the Whale, written by Ron Bass (Rain Man), starring opposite Josh Hartnett.\n\nRole in the film: Christopher DaSilva\n\nBrief biography:\n\nSean Bean gained international fame as Boromir in the Academy Award®- winning Lord of the Rings trilogy. But while that may be his best-known role, it is only one in a career that includes more than 40 films, acclaimed stage performances and one of the most successful franchises in British television history.\n\nOriginally from Sheffield, Bean worked as a welder before turning to acting, and even his most polished characters retain a hard masculine edge. After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, and then won two career-making film roles, the first in 1990’s critically acclaimed The Field opposite Richard Harris, and the next in 1992’s Patriot Games, starring opposite Harrison Ford in a provocative and complex portrayal of the tragic antagonist. Clearly a romantic lead, he was cast as Richard Sharpe, hero of the Napoleonic Wars, in1993’s Sharpe’s Rifles. After 13 two-hour sequels, Bean was one of the UK’s best-known stars.\n\nHe also dazzled audiences in films as varied as Tom & Thomas, Essex Boys, Ronin and Anna Karenina, and more recently in Troy, with Brad Pitt; The Big Empty with Jon Favreau, Equilibrium with Christian Bale and Don’t Say a Word opposite Michael Douglas.\n\nOn stage in 2004, the classically trained Bean won raves in an acclaimed West End production of Macbeth, and recently starred in Henry VIII for Granada opposite Ray Winstone and Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nIn the last 18 months he has starred in the Bruckheimer/Disney blockbuster National Treasure, Dreamworks’ The Island, Flightplan with Jodie Foster and, in his first role as an American, the acclaimed North Country with Charlize Theron. He has just completed the final chapter of Sharpe, Sharpe’s Challenge, set in India and due out in 2006. Voted by readers of Empire Magazine “the second sexiest man in England,” Bean escapes madness by working non-stop in films around the world, and rooting for Sheffield United wherever satellite reception allows.\n\nRole in the film: Cybil Bennet\n\nBrief biography:\n\nLaurie Holden's acting career reads like a Cinderella story. While performing on stage at the world renowned Larry Moss Acting Studio, she was discovered by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile) who thought she was perfect for the lead in his capra-esque drama, The Majestic. Holden’s captivating feature film debut starring as Jim Carrey’s long lost love in the film was met with critical acclaim by the New York Times and film critics around the world. This film introduced audiences to her natural onscreen presence, which Darabont called “fresh, awesome – like an old Hollywood film star with a lovely twist.” Indeed, keeping things fresh is Holden’s passion and she’s created an arsenal of memorable characters in film and television since she began her career as a child. She appeared in last summer’s successful comic-action adventure, The Fantastic Four starring opposite Michael Chiklis’ portrayal of ‘The Thing.’ She recently shot the indie family film, Bailey’s Millions with Tim Curry, Jon Lovitz, Jennifer Tilly and Dean Cain and is attached to star in another indie opposite Ben Kingsley, The Knights of Impossingworth Park.\n\nA dual citizen of Canada and the U.S., Holden's career got off to the kind of start most actors can only dream of. Upon graduating from UCLA with honors, Holden received the \"Natalie Wood Acting Award\" for Best Actress. She went on to study the classics on the London stage at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. She co-starred in the TNT mini-series Young Catherine with Vanessa Redgrave, and gained notoriety playing ‘Marita Covarubbias,’ the UN Informant to Fox Mulder, on the long-running hit The X-Files. Her episodic work includes a comedic turn in the critically acclaimed Due South, for which she was nominated for a Gemini Award (Canada's Emmy).
