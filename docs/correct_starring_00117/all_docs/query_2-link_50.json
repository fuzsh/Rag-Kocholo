        "text": "If I could have been a famous American, I would be Rosa Parks because she was a leader of social change. She knew that if she refused to give her seat on a bus to a white man she would get arrested, but she didn’t care because she knew that way she would encourage every African-American to not be afraid and help each other to change the white people’s way of thinking so blacks and whites would be treated as equals. That’s why I would have wanted to be Rosa Parks because no matter what I would have done the same to help make change; help this world be a better place; make people help each other and live in peace.\n\nSTEPHANY RODRIGUEZ\n\nI would be Franklin Delano Roosevelt because he led America through the Great Depression and World War II. He also had polio and spent some time in a wheelchair and that’s inspirational because he lived through it even though he was disabled for a while. He also contributed the building of a swimming pool and a movie theater in the White House. That is why I chose Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nEVIE RODGERSON\n\nThe person I would most like to be is Bruce Lee. I want to be him because I admire his ability to bring martial arts into theaters with combined techniques. Also, for a very small man he can really self-defend himself. Not only did he do martial arts in the movies, he taught it in his own martial arts studio. I would give anything to learn the martial arts techniques he learned. My dream is to be a master in all the techniques that are being taught. The reason I chose Bruce Lee is because of the fact he proved that the size of a person doesn’t make a difference in defending yourself and I hope to continue his legacy some day.\n\nBRANDON\n\nSAKOUNMOUNG\n\nIf I could be any famous American, it would be an ice hockey goalie named Martin Brodeur. I would like to be him because he showed people new styles of play and became one of the best goalies in the world. I would also like to be him because he was one of the first and only goalies to score a goal. I would also like to be him because he played his first NHL game at the age of 17. He had also accomplished winning more than a Stanley Cup throughout his career. That is why if I could be any famous American it would be Martin Brodeur.\n\nJOSH GOLIBER\n\nIf I could be any famous person, I would be Martin Luther King Jr. because he stopped slavery and he did it without violence (with the help of Abraham Lincoln). He also did not have to do anything bad to get people to listen to him. He would hold up signs or make a speech. Martin was the youngest person to win a Nobel Peace prize.\n\nKASANDRA SELLARS\n\nIf I could be a famous American, I would be Albert Einstein. He was good at physics and science. He changed how we viewed space. He also liked painting. That is why I would be Albert Einstein.\n\nJOSHUA ALBERT\n\nThe person I would be is Elvis Presley because he is the king of rock and roll. He was born Jan. 8, 1935. Elvis got his first guitar when he was 11. His first breakthrough song was “That’s All Right.” His home was Graceland in Memphis, Tenn., and it is now a museum. He sold more than one billion records and had 149 songs on the billboard “Hot 100.” He starred in 83 movies. He is also in the Music Hall of Fame. He died Aug. 16, 1977. We will always remember his music.\n\nAARON BURKE\n\nI would be Michael Jordan. I would be a famous American because he has been on the cover of Sports Illustrated over 50 times. Also, because he is really good at basketball and basketball is my favorite sport.\n\nCRISTIAN LOPEZ\n\nIf I could be a famous American from the past, I would be Martin Luther King Jr. because he got rid of whites taking over water bubblers, stores and other things. He led marches and one march was for Rosa Parks because she went to jail. Martin Luther King Jr. thought all blacks shouldn’t ride the bus because they didn’t get to sit where they wanted and whites did. Martin Luther King Jr. also did other important things that helped change the way we are.\n\nEMILY O’REILLY\n\nI would be Harriet Tubman. In 1820 she was a slave when she was born. Later on in life, she risked her life to go back and free other slaves, including her own parents, through the Underground Railroad. She had made 18 trips and freed more than 300 slaves. She also was a cook, nurse and a spy in the Civil War.\n\nDAYNAH LEBLANC\n\nI would be Elvis Presley because he invented the best sandwich ever; the peanut butter and banana sandwich. He is the king of rock and roll. He has cool hair. He got his first guitar when he was 11 and starred in 33 movies. He is in the Rock and Roll, Country and Gospel Music Hall of Fame. He sold more than one billion records.\n\nJACOB OXFORD\n\nIf I could be any famous American, I would be Ciara Harris, the famous R and B singer. I love Ciara’s songs. My favorites are “Goodies” and “And I.” Ciara is so pretty. Ciara’s dad is in the Army and I’m kind of jealous because I would love to have a dad who fights for freedom. Before landing in Atlanta, Ciara went to Germany, New York, California, Arizona and Nevada. I always dreamed about adventuring in a different state. She lives in Austin, Texas and I love Texas. It seems so nice there. That is why I wish to be Ciara Harris.\n\nCHRISTINA HALFREY\n\nIf I could be any famous American I would be Bam Maregera because I would be a pro skateboarder and I would be sponsored by Element (that’s a skate brand). I would have my own show called “Viva La Bam” and I would have an awesome house called Castle-Bam. That’s why I’d be Bam Maregera for a famous American.\n\nBRYAN HEBERT\n\nIf I could be a famous American, I would like to be Harriet Tubman because she freed people that were slaves. She even saved her family from being slaves. It took her a lot of trips because there were a lot of people to be free from being slaves and she even freed a lot of people. That’s why I want to be like Harriet Tubman.\n\nLISA LABARGE\n\nIf I could be any famous American, I would be George Lucas because he wrote a lot of good movies like “Star Wars.” The reason why I like “Star Wars” is because it has a lot of good graphics and most of it takes place in space. It is very real looking.\n\nCARL CRAMM\n\nI would be Albert Einstein because he was a genius in math. I like math. He was the smartest mathematician of the world. He was born on March 14, 1879 and died April 18, 1955 (four days after my birthday). He also predicted the eclipse and was a professor at Zurich University. He came from Germany and became an American citizen.\n\nSHANE DRALEAU\n\nIf I could be any famous American, I would be Elvis Presley. I would like to be Elvis Presley because he was the fist ever rock and roll superstar. He sold more than one billion records and starred in 33 movies. He is in the Rock and Roll, Country and Gospel Music Hall of Fame. He has truly earned the nickname “King of Rock.”\n\nTYLER RICHARD\n\nIf I could have been a famous American from the past, I would have been Rosa Parks. I would have been Rosa Parks because if she hadn’t said no to the bus driver about getting out of her seat, we would probably still have slavery right now. So thank you Rosa Parks.\n\nDEZZIRREE RICHARD\n\nIf I could be a famous American, I would be Rosa Parks. I would be Rosa Parks because she had the courage to start a whole new chapter on the Civil Rights Movement by refusing to give up her seat to a white man on the bus on Dec. 1, 1955. She got arrested for that act. Then people started going on a strike to ride the buses. That caused the bus companies to lose money, so not too long after they had to allow blacks to sit wherever. So all because of her we have freedom. That is why I would be Rosa Parks as a famous American.\n\nASHLEY GREEN\n\nI would be Michelle Kwan because I love figure skating. In my opinion, I would say figure skating is the coolest, most fun sport ever and Michelle Kwan is the best figure skater in the world. She is really into what she does and that is fun to watch. Her skating is marvelous plus I would want to have the ability to do the stunts she does and be famous and have fans.\n\nTIERA MAILLOUX\n\nIf I could be a famous American, I would be Ella Fitzgerald because, in my opinion, she was the best jazz singer in America. She was the most popular jazz singer in America for more than 50 years and she was able to imitate any instrument in the orchestra with her voice.\n\nTIFFANY NGUYEN\n\nIf I were a famous American, I would be Maya Lin. I picked Maya Lin because I like drawing and coloring things and making origami with paper. I also would pick her because she is Asian and I’m half Asian. I really wanted to be her because she is creative and artistic and I want to be just like that. If you are wondering who Maya Lin is just read my words and you’ll soon find out who she is and what she did to be famous. Well, on Oct. 5, 1959 an artist was entering the world. When she turned 21 she took designing classes. When she made a design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., it came under attack for a variety of reasons but it would become the most visited monument in the country. I really want to be her because she is a good artist in everything.\n\nBRYANNA DUANGMANEE\n\nIf I were to be a famous American, I would be Maya Lin because she is an honorable woman who designed the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., which has the names of the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War and who died. Maya Lin is a woman of art and creation and has cared for people and then made a design of it. Why did I pick her? I picked her because she has a heart of care and art in her and she followed her dreams and her dreams led her to design a wonderful thing. Another reason is I love to draw and to be creative and Maya Lin inspires me a lot to open my dreams and to fill them. Maya Lin is my number one person who changed America. I know one day my dream will fulfill and lead me somewhere like Maya Lin.\n\nKIM KEOMANY\n\nIf I could be a famous American, I would be Mohammed Ali because I love boxing besides soccer and I think he was the greatest boxer in the 20th century. He was a great man. He is really famous even though he was the “Louisville Lip” and “The Blabber Mouth.” He has had a long life and that’s good; that’s another reason why I would want to be him. He got to be in the Olympics and he won. When he was young, he beat everybody in the ring. The one thing that makes me kind of not want to be him is that he has Parkinson’s disease. Parkinson’s is a disease that occurs when you get hit numerous times in the head and it will steadily erode your control over your body.\n\nJOSE HERRERA\n\nI picked Paul Pierce because I want to be a basketball star just like him. His team has helped with charities and shelters. Paul Pierce is six feet, six inches tall and weighs 230 pounds. He was born in Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 13, 1977. He went to college in Kansas and graduated in 1999. Pierce was named First Team All America by the AP after his junior season at Kansas. Pierce was picked 10 in the first-round draft by Boston. His position on the Boston Celtics is shooting guard. Pierce sets a new world record of beating 2,000 points score in one year. He became the first Celtics player to win NBA’s Player of the Month Award. He was named Rookie of the Month in February 1999."
