        "text": "MAPS OF THE SIERRA\n\nI have accumulated so many maps of the High Sierra that I can now spend hours armchair backpacking, which is considerably easier than the real thing. I like the most detailed topographic maps, but I keep a plan (the one found in the Starr’s Guide) of the whole range on my wall, marking where I’ve been, with the idea that I should go where I’ve yet to explore. I also like 3-D plastic maps, lame though they are, and, of course, Google Earth. Maps are such a great aid to winter dreams of summer trips!\n\nOBSIDIAN NECKLACE\n\nI made a necklace for my wife from obsidian I found in California’s High Sierra. Since there is no naturally occurring volcanic glass in the range, the flakes had to have been left by humans. We happened on this apparent knapping site at sunset, and gleaming in the angled sunlight were countless shards, suggesting hundreds or even thousands of years of people sitting around in that high place, catching the summer view, talking as they worked.\n\nMARS AS PICTURED BY NASA’S CURIOSITY ROVER\n\nI looked at Mars for fifteen years by way of NASA’s Viking photos, and then I saw the first images coming from Curiosity’s orbiters and landers. I was stunned. It was as though I had been nearsighted and color-blind all my life, and then suddenly could see the Red Planet with full sight. And what a beautiful sight it was: a million different textures and tints and colors articulating the ancient volcanoes, crater rims, and canyons. The wonderful new rovers have visited hilly areas that the two Viking landers had to avoid, and it’s become evident that long-distance views on Mars will be spectacular, despite the tighter horizons we’ll perceive on this smaller planet. Someday Mars will become a human space, and when we do inhabit it, there are going to be a lot of very happy artists there.\n\nLIONS ON THE HUNT, CHAUVET CAVE (VALLON-PONT-D’ARC, FRANCE)\n\nMade thirty-two thousand years ago in the depths of the Ice Age, this painting may be the greatest ever. The mural—which depicts a type of cave lion now long extinct—is so detailed that it has taught zoologists many things about the species, including the fact that its males had no manes. It also shows that these early artists were employing a technique akin to stop-motion: Note the lions’ detached forelegs, their bodies’ elongation, and the multiple versions of one of the beasts. We can see that two of the big cats, apparently distracted from the hunt, are touching noses in classic cat style. The people who made this art paid attention to animals with an intensity that comes from interdependence. Such focus is also a form of love and the foundation of all great art. I guess you could say that the lions in this painting are loving the bison. In such scenarios, best stay out of the lions’ way!\n\nACHEULEAN HAND AX\n\nSeveral hundred thousand of these early stone tools have been found in Africa, Europe, and Asia, so a lot are traded privately outside the museum circuit. I have one, but I bought it off the Internet, so it may be a fake. (Its patination is suspiciously smooth, as though the knapper sent it through a rock tumbler.) If my seller is to be believed, however, this hand ax was found in Spain in a soil layer some three hundred thousand years old (the oldest such axes date to 1.8 million years ago). Acheulean hand axes are a bit mysterious because they are pointed but often sharp all the way around their ovular form, so there is no way to hold one without cutting yourself, and yet they’re not fit for the end of a spear, either. Some have called them killer Frisbees, others the Swiss Army knife of the Paleolithic. In any case, this tool predates Homo sapiens, and I like being reminded that we’ve been technological since before we were even human.\n\nGOSSAMER GEAR’S ULTRALIGHT BACKPACK\n\nThis blue beauty weighs eight ounces and is so delicate that Gossamer Gear had to stop making them and shift to stronger materials. When they did, I bought three of them, and they came in the mail in 9 x 12″ flat envelopes—GG showing off. Now I treat the packs like eggs and hike the Sierra light as a bird. I might even float off."
