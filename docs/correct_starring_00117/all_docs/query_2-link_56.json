        "text": "Fertility is something that's important to many people, but we all know that there's a finite amount of time in which a woman can conceive a child. By the age of 37, it's believed that around 90% of a woman's eggs are gone, naturally reducing the chance of getting pregnant. For that reason, the idea of freezing your eggs has become increasingly popular in recent years, as it opens up the possibility of conceiving a little later on, or preserving your younger, healthier eggs for use in slightly later years.\n\nYou might have considered getting your eggs frozen yourself, if you're perhaps not in the right kind of relationship for starting a family, or if you're choosing to pause on baby making for other reasons, like progressing your career.\n\nAnd it's something that's slowly getting more popular; According to the latest report from the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority (HFEA), it's the UK's fastest growing fertility treatment, with a 64% rise in patients.\n\nHowever, it's an expensive treatment (the average cost of having your eggs collected and frozen in the UK is £3,350, with additional ongoing costs for storage), so you may not know that many people who have actually done it. But considering it's the kind of topic that's useful to hear personal perspective on, we thought we'd round up all the celebrities who have opened up about their own choice to freeze their eggs.\n\nSo, here are some celebrities you probably didn't even know had gone through the egg freezing process, or who say they plan to in the near future:\n\n1. Kristen Stewart\n\nThe former Twilight star revealed on the Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast that both she and her fiancée Dylan Meyer had chosen to freeze their eggs.\n\nWhen asked by host Amanda Hirsch whether children were on the cards in the future, the 34-year-old explained: \"We've done really annoying things like freeze our eggs and stuff. So, if we want to we can, you know what I mean? Like, keeping that open.\"\n\nStewart has previously expressed a desire to have a child, saying in her Rolling Stone interview back in February 2024 that she \"wasn't scared\" to be pregnant. However, she added she was \"f*cking scared\" of childbirth.\n\n2. Priyanka Chopra\n\nThe actor, now 41, opted to freeze her eggs in her early thirties, before she met her husband Nick Jonas.\n\nSpeaking on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast, Chopra explained that at the time, she hadn't met the person she wanted to settle down with.\n\n\"I could continue on an ambitious warpath that I wanted to achieve,\" she said. \"I wanted to get to a certain place in my career, and I also hadn't met the person I wanted to have children with or I didn't see that.\"\n\nAfter snagging a Jonas brother, Chopra has gone on to have children. She welcomed Malti Marie Chopra Jonas in January 2022, via surrogate.\n\n3. Emma Roberts\n\nSpeaking candidly in her Cosmopolitan cover interview, the Scream Queens star revealed the impact an endometriosis diagnosis had on her life. \"A few years ago, I learned that I’ve had undiagnosed endometriosis since I was a teenager. I always had debilitating cramps and periods... I mentioned this to my doctor, who didn’t look into it and sent me on my way. In my late 20s, I switched to a female doctor. She ran tests, sent me to a specialist. Finally, there was validation... but by then, it had affected my fertility. I was told, 'You should probably freeze your eggs or look into other options'.\"\n\nEmma, who now shares three-year-old Rhodes with ex Garrett Hedlund, said she was initially in shock at the thought of freezing her eggs. \"I said, 'I’m working right now. I don’t have time to freeze my eggs.' To be honest, I was also terrified. Just the thought of going through that and finding out, perhaps, that I wouldn’t be able to have kids. I did freeze my eggs eventually, which was a difficult process.\"\n\nShe added that speaking to other women helped her massively. \"I felt like I'd done something wrong [until] I started opening up to other women, and all of a sudden, there was a new world of conversation about endometriosis, infertility, miscarriages, fear of having kids. I was so grateful to find out I was not alone in this.\"\n\n4. Chrissy Teigen\n\nChrissy Teigen has always been open about her struggles with fertility, having conceived her first two children, Luna and Miles, via IVF. She welcomed daughter Esti Maxine in January 2023, also via IVF, while her son Wren was born via surrogate in June the same year.\n\nThe Cravings cookbook author used frozen eggs, and has previously revealed she wished she'd gone through the process while she was younger.\n\n\"I wish I had frozen my eggs earlier,\" she told People in 2016. \"The number of embryos we have left is not matching the number of people I want at my dinner table, so I'll have to do it again.\"\n\n5. Michaela Coel\n\nI May Destroy You creator Michaela Coel shared in an interview with GQ in 2020 that she is in the process of freezing her eggs, \"just in case.\" Opening up to actor Donald Glover, who conducted the interview, she said, \"I've never been too thinky about bearing my own children through my vagina,\" but is doing egg freezing \"in case I changed my mind.\"\n\nCoel acknowledged that there could be a point in time \"where suddenly you really want babies and all you can think about is you want a baby and the clock’s ticking.\" While she admits she's not had that feeling so far (\"I’ve never even said, 'I want to have a baby' ever in my life,\" she told Glover) she is taking the measures just as a precaution. \"I’m freezing them in case that hits me later.\"\n\n6. Rebel Wilson\n\n44-year-old Rebel Wilson has had a hectic career, juggling film stardom with writing – and while at these lofty heights, The Pitch Perfect actress revealed she opted to have her eggs frozen.\n\nSpeaking to show hosts Kyle and Jackie O, Wilson explained: \"It’s a back-up plan. Career women now have options. I think a lot women who are in their 30s and if they can do it, in their 40s should think about doing it now. A lot of my friends in Hollywood are doing it.\"\n\nWilson, who is now engaged to Ramona Agruma, has since gone on to have a baby - she welcomed her \"beautiful miracle\" Royce in November 2022.\n\n7. Kourtney Kardashian\n\nBack in 2018, the reality star was filmed on Keeping Up With The Kardashians while going through the process of freezing her eggs.\n\nSharing the details with her friends, Kourtney admitted she had been feeling \"so up and down\" after taking hormonal injections. Showing off the bruising on her stomach that had been left as a result, she continued: \"It’s like crazy. I feel like I want to jump out of my skin. I’m so crazy, I can’t take it.\"\n\nKardashian said at the time that she wasn't certain she wanted another child, but was choosing to freeze her eggs on the off-chance she might. \"I just feel like this is for safety,\" she explained, adding: \"I hope that going through all of this is worth it. I don’t want to put my body through something like this again. The emotions of it all are just a lot.\"\n\nHowever, after meeting drummer Travis Barker, Kardashian was keen to conceive again. She announced her pregnancy in June 2023 by holding up a sign that read \"Travis I'm pregnant!\" at a Blink-182 gig. They welcomed their son, Rocky, in November the same year.\n\n8. Amy Schumer\n\n42-year-old Amy Schumer got married to husband Chris Fischer in February 2018, and the couple welcomed their first child, Gene, in May the following year. But since then, they've been trying for a second baby and have come up against some difficulties. In a candid Instagram post, comedian and actress Amy shared an intimate photograph of her swollen, bruised stomach thanks to fertility treatment, and explained that she is freezing her eggs in a bid to have another child.\n\n\"I’m a week into IVF and feeling really run down and emotional,\" Amy posted. \"If anyone went through it and if you have any advice or wouldn’t mind sharing your experience with me please do. My number is in my bio. We are freezing my eggs and figuring out what to do to give Gene a sibling.\"\n\n9. Halsey\n\nSinger Halsey has been open about her health struggles with endometriosis, and the condition means she has also made the decision to be \"aggressive\" about preserving her fertility. Speaking to TV show The Doctors back in 2018, the then-23-year-old explained the criticism she had come up against for planning to freeze her eggs at such a young age.\n\n\"I’m 23 years old, and I'm going to freeze my eggs. And when I tell people that, they're like, 'You're 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?'\" she shared. Not that she should have to explain herself, but Halsey continued, saying: \"Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I’m fortunate enough to have that as an option. However, I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, and about protecting myself.\"\n\nHowever, in January 2021, Halsey confirmed the news she wanted - she was pregnant. She welcomed her son, Ender Ridley Aydin, in July after what she described as a 'euphoric' birth. She split with the father of her child, Alev Aydin, in 2023.\n\n10. Amy Hart\n\nLove Island's Amy Hart revealed in 2020 that she was going through the process of egg freezing after a fertility MOT showed she was liable to go through early menopause. The former air hostess also pointed to her lack of relationship success as another reason why she wanted a \"back up plan.\"\n\n\"When I was unlucky in dating, my whole thing was 'what if I never have children?',\" Hart said on Loose Women. The reality TV star's plan was to undergo the procedure in March 2020, but it seems that was disrupted after the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded and fertility treatment was largely put on hold.\n\nThankfully, Hart has now welcomed a son, Stanley, in 2023 with her fiancé Sam Rason.\n\n11. Kim Kardashian\n\nKimmy knew early on that she would struggle with fertility. \"A few years ago I was told I could never get pregnant,\" Kardashian once told ELLE UK. \"Three different doctors told me the same thing, which is why I wanted to have my eggs frozen.\"\n\nBut when she went ahead with the process back in 2013, she discovered she was actually pregnant with her first child, North. Since then, Kim Kardashian and ex-husband Kanye West have gone on to have three more children - Saint, Chicago and Psalm - with the youngest two being carried by a surrogate, due to it being deemed too risky for Kim to get pregnant again.\n\n12. Rita Ora\n\nYou might imagine that egg freezing is something women start to consider as they edge towards the end of their fertile years, but that wasn't the case for Rita Ora. Now 33, the singer revealed on Australian breakfast TV show Sunrise that she had undergone the procedure in her early 20s, following a recommendation from her family doctor. He told her: \"You’re healthiest now and I think it would be great, why don’t you put them away now and you’ll never have to worry about it again?\"\n\nShe added she hopes to have children with her husband, Taika Waititi. \"Family is so, so important to me,\" Ora said. \"I’d love to have children of course when the time is right. Fingers crossed.\"\n\nAnd her doctor's suggestion seems to be in keeping with what research has found; that the earlier you freeze your eggs, the higher the chance of conceiving with them later down the line. Scientists from Newcastle Fertility Centre previously presented research suggesting the average live birth rate using a patient's own frozen eggs (and considering most people don't freeze them until a little later on) is just 18% – so, a less than one-in-five chance. But Dr Mariano Mascarenhas, who was involved in the research, noted that people may see an improved chance of success if they have their eggs frozen younger. \"The chances of having a baby can improve if eggs are stored early in life,\" he said.\n\n13. Olivia Munn\n\nAll too aware of the 'ticking clock of her fertility' (as society likes to remind us!) Olivia Munn took action in her mid-thirties, and had some eggs frozen. Speaking to Anna Faris on her podcast back in 2016, the actress shared that she \"froze a bunch of eggs\" when she turned 35, because \"you're high risk [for difficulty conceiving]\" from then on.\n\n\"I think that every girl should do it. For one, you don't have to race the clock any more. You don't have to worry about it, worry about your job or anything. It's there,\" Munn continued.\n\nMunn has gone on to welcome her son Malcolm with comedian partner John Mulaney in 2021, but revealed she has since gone on to freeze her eggs again after she had a hysterectomy, following a cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"After my diagnosis, we decided to try one more round of egg retrievals and hoped it was a good month,\" Munn told Vogue. \"John and I talked about it a lot and we don't feel like we're done growing our family, but didn't know if I would have to do chemotherapy or radiation.\n\n\"This journey has made me realise how grateful I am to have options for not only fighting cancer, but also having more children if we want, because I know a lot of people don’t have those options.\"\n\n14. Paris Hilton\n\nWe take inspiration from our friends on a multitude of things, but for Paris Hilton, she sought family planning guidance from her pal Kim Kardashian. In conversation with , 43-year-old Paris explained what had happened.\n\n\"I had a really amazing conversation with Kim about [egg freezing],\" she said. \"She introduced me to her doctor, and I was so inspired by her to actually do it.\" For Hilton, she felt it was a move to reclaim focus on future relationships. \"I think every woman should do it because you can really control it and not have that ‘Oh my God, I need to get married.’\"\n\nHilton has since gone on to have two children. Alongside her husband Carter Reum, they welcomed their first child together, a son named Phoenix, via surrogate in January 2023. Less than a year later, they expanded their family in November 2023 with a daughter named London, also born via surrogate.\n\n15. Khloé Kardashian\n\nIn a series 18 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, enthusiastic grandma Kris Jenner can be seen badgering daughter Khloé to freeze her eggs, just in case she wants any more children after True. When Khloé announces she's \"not even thinking about\" dating anyone after breaking up with Tristan Thompson, Kris probes: \"Do you want another baby? Are your eggs frozen?\"\n\n\"No, if I want to I will one day. I'm not worried about it,\" replies a cool-headed Khloé, rejecting her mum's suggestion at first. But in later scenes, it seems the idea of freezing her eggs had gradually become more appealing . She was later filmed going through the procedure, and didn't seem to find it too troubling. \"I’ve been doing hormone injections for about five days, and the injection process has been fine,\" she said on her reality show.\n\nShe has since gone on to have a second child, welcoming son Tatum with Tristan Thompson in July 2022. Tatum was born via surrogate."
