        "text": "It’s hard not to be a football fan when your mother’s family founded the Pittsburgh Steelers and her father's family founded the New York Giants.\n\nAlthough the Mara sisters probably can’t be classified as “die-hard“ Steelers fans because of their links to the G-Men, their attachment to the team is good enough for me for to squeeze them onto my Top 25 list.\n\nRooney Mara is a actress who starred in The Social Network and made her claim to fame in 2011’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, where she starred as the title character, Lisbeth Salander.\n\nFor her performance she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture in a Drama.\n\nRooney’s sister Kate Mara starred in the movie Brokeback Mountain and the FX television series American Horror Story.\n\nOn CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman last year, Rooney Mara said she resented football growing up but told Letterman, \"Now I appreciate it. It's a very unique part of my family.\"\n\nWhen asked by the king of late night television which team she prefers to watch on Sundays, she said, \"The Giants. I mean, I like the Steelers, too, but my dad works for the Giants.\"\n\nThat's not much of an endorsement for the black and gold. But when your first name’s Rooney, you and your sister are the great-granddaughters of team founder Art Rooney and your great-uncle (Dan Rooney) is the team’s chairman, I feel I am forced to include these two by bloodline.\n\nBoth families have maintained at least partial ownership of both teams since they were founded.\n\nFour-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson may be a new-found Steelers fan, but he’s a fan nonetheless.\n\nJohnson told SportsIllustrated.com how he became a member of Steelers Nation when asked to make a pick in Super Bowl XLV: \"For me, I'm Steelers all the way,” he said. “When Madden Football first came out, my friends picked their teams and I picked the Steelers, so that is how I became a fan, because I worked my friends over as the Steelers.\n\n“I was at the Super Bowl when they beat the Arizona Cardinals in the last minute with that touchdown pass, pulling for them like crazy. I had my Steelers hat on when they played the New York Jets last week and I'm going to have my Steelers hat on Sunday, cheering for them.”\n\nSo he’s maybe not as die-hard a fan as some face-painting, Primanti Bros.-eating, Terrible Towel-waving Pittsburghers, but he certainly is on board.\n\nWorks for me.\n\nAmerican rapper Wiz Khalifa—government name Cameron Jibril Thomaz— busted onto the mainstream scene with his hit “Black and Yellow” last year, an homage of sorts to the famous colors of his favorite team, the Steelers.\n\nIn the video for \"Black and Yellow,\" Khalifa can be seen waving the team’s famous Terrible Towel while wearing a T-shirt bearing a Steelers Super Bowl ring.\n\nThe song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and Khalifa was named 2012 Billboard Music Awards Best New Artist winner in large part because of the success of that catchy song.\n\nPart of a military family, Khalifa lived in Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan before moving to the Steel City and settling down.\n\nThere he attended Pittsburgh’s Taylor Allderdice High School and his love for the hometown gridiron legends grew.\n\nKhalifa told MTV he hoped the song would become the team’s de facto anthem.\n\n\"We got two or three records that we're tossing around; it's just the order of which ones we're gonna put out,\" Khalifa said. \"Right now, there's one that's gonna be real big for Pittsburgh. It's gonna be the Steelers' anthem: It's called 'Black and Yellow.' \"\n\nWell, it worked and a hometown star was born. And apparently the anthem appealed to more than just Pittsburghers.\n\nHere are some appropriate lyrics from it:\n\nRepping my town when you see me you know everything\n\nBlack and yellow\n\nBlack and yellow\n\nBlack and yellow\n\nBlack and yellow\n\nAnd if you’re confused, you’ll have to just ask Wiz himself why “black and yellow” and not black and gold. And while you’re at it, you might want to ask him why he chose to go with the name Wiz.\n\nThe host of the nation’s most-listened to radio show, Rush Limbaugh has always been a big football fan. For a short time he was a member of ESPN's NFL Countdown and was also part of a group that made an attempt to buy the St. Louis Rams a couple of years ago.\n\nA devout Steelers fan, Limbaugh was recently urged by a caller to abandon his love for the black and gold because the team had presented President Obama with a game ball.\n\nI’d better move on to No. 20 on my list. Writing about Limbaugh or President Obama is sure to alienate half of the readers either way, and I really don’t to like to mix my dislike for politics with my love for football.\n\nAnd god would I love to see Wiz Khalifa (No. 22), Limbaugh and the guy I have listed next at No. 20 sitting back-to-back-to-back in the stands at Heinz Field.\n\nI’m sure Kim Kardashian will be single for a year straight before that ever happens.\n\nBest known for her role as Betty Draper-Francis on the television show Mad Men on AMC, January Jones makes no bones about it: she is a black-and-gold bleeding Steelers fan and knows her football.\n\nThe beautiful blonde told USA Today in an interview before the 2011 Super Bowl against the Arizona Cardinals, \"They're [the Steelers] my favorite team,\" before rushing “over to my sister's when I'm done. She's cooking and having some people over, which should be fun.\"\n\nAnd Jones really takes the game football seriously. \"I just don't like it when people are running around and being too animated, not caring about the game,\" she opined.\n\n\"I like to sit and actually watch the game. I'm like, 'Please stop talking about Lea Michele's performance!' When halftime's over, let's get back to the game.”\n\nA woman after my heart.\n\nSome have doubted country music legend Hank Williams, Jr.’s devotion to the Steelers (because he was wearing a Tennessee Titans jersey while singing the Monday Night Football theme), but it doesn’t take much research to see he’s a huge fan.\n\nBorn in same Louisiana hospital less than a year apart from legendary Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw, Williams was part of the Steelers’ 75th anniversary celebration and even sang the national anthem before the Baltimore Ravens game.\n\nIn an interview with the website PittsburghSteelers.com, Williams said, “The Rooney’s are great. “They have done so many special things for me. They know that my love for the team comes from inside my heart. I’ve worn so many Steelers things in so many auditoriums in my life. It doesn’t matter what city I am in.”\n\n”I talk to people in the Steelers office almost every week,” he continued. “We speak a lot. I went to training camp a few years ago. I don’t get to see all of the games, but I do watch a lot of them on tape because of my schedule.\"\n\nIf Williams Jr., who also performed at Heinz Field during the 2009 AFC Championship game, isn’t considered at least a part-time Steelers fan with all that, then I don’t know who is.\n\nTrust me, no one on the list knows more about the Pittsburgh Steelers and would be a better fan to talk with about the black and gold than Scott Ferrall.\n\nThe Pittsburgh-born, gravelly-voiced, speedy-talking host of The Scott Ferrall Show (Monday-Friday, 8 p.m.-12 a.m. ET) on SiriusXM Radio (channel Howard 101) is one of the most intelligent and honest voices in the history of sports radio. Trust me.\n\nFerrall's broadcasting career began at all-news KQV radio in his hometown of Pittsburgh. During their inaugural season, he was the play-by-play voice of the NHL’s Atlanta Thrashers.\n\nAlthough he is huge hockey (and Pittsburgh Penguins) fan, Ferrall—who was a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman in 1999—knows more and talks in-depth about a wider variety sports than anyone to ever grace the airwaves. Plus, he is as die-hard a Steelers fan as you will ever find.\n\nScouring the Internet, message boards and chat rooms, I came across enough famous names linked to the Pittsburgh Steelers that this very well could have grown into a Top 50 or Top 100 slideshow.\n\nThe two biggest names I found with even the remotest connection to the team were Frank Sinatra (pictured above with Franco Harris wearing a “Franco’s Army” helmet after being inducted as a “One-Star General) and, Elvis Presley, who according to one poster on steelersforum.com said to his nurse while watching Super Bowl X, “You know I'm not pulling for the Cowboys—I'm a Steelers fan\".\n\nHow do you like them apples, Bubba?\n\nAlso deemed a Steelers fan, although I couldn’t find enough real proof to justify his inclusion on this list was Burt Reynolds, who played college football at Florida State and was actually drafted by the Baltimore Colts.\n\nReynolds is well-known for his role as Paul Crewe in the original The Longest Yard, where he plays a former Steelers quarterback. He also starred as another former Steelers player in the television series Evening Shade.\n\nMarried With Children star Ed O'Neill was an undrafted free agent of the Steelers in the summer of 1969 and is also rumored to be a member of the Steeler Nation.\n\nSome of the many other famous folks whom I saw claims of being Steelers fans but could not confirm include musicians Charlie Daniels, Kid Rock (Detroit die-hard), Tim McGraw, Garth Brooks, Trace Adkins, P!nk, Chris Kirkpatrick (‘N Sync), Mac Miller (rapper) and Billy Talent (Canadian punk rock band).\n\nAlso, Hollywood types Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, David Boreanaz, Jake Gyllenhaal, Kevin Costner, Bruce Willis, Dennis Miller, Julie Benz (Dexter), Gwyneth Paltrow, Alyssa Milano, Sharon Stone, Zachary Quinto and Mr. T have all been rumored to be fans of the Steelers.\n\nAnd you can add Thomas Tobin (the Diocese of Providence), Michael Hayden (former CIA director), Jim Furyk (golfer), Rocco Mediate (golfer), Lucas Glover (golfer), Shawn Johnson (Olympic gymnast), Teresa Heinz (philanthropist and wife of John Kerry), and, believe it or not, girlfriend of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen (model).\n\nAnd wouldn’t that just be the bee’s knees if Gisele came out publicly and admitted she was a member of Steeler Nation?\n\nSo there you have it. That is almost everyone I could find—I kept a couple of controversial names out so as not to taint the Steelers name or stir up nasty debate in the comment section below—who is confirmed to be or even remotely linked to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nIf you have any others you know of, or have heard of, feel free to leave them below.\n\nAnd it’s never too early to get your Terrible Towels ready for the 2012 season."
