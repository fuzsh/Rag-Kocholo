Joplin achieved fame for his ragtime compositions and was dubbed the King of Ragtime. During his brief career, he wrote 44 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first and most popular pieces, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag.Joplin grew up in a musical family of railway laborers in Texarkana, Arkansas, and developed his own musical knowledge with the help of local teachers. While in Texarkana, Texas, he formed a vocal quartet and taught mandolin and guitar. During the late 1880s he left his job as a railroad laborer and travelled the American South as an itinerant musician. He went to Chicago for the World's Fair of 1893, which played a major part in making ragtime a national craze by 1897. Joplin moved to Sedalia, Missouri, in 1894 and earned a living as a piano teacher. There he taught future ragtime composers Arthur Marshall, Scott Hayden and Brun Campbell. He began publishing music in 1895, and publication of his \"Maple Leaf Rag\" in 1899 brought him fame. This piece had a profound influence on writers of ragtime. It also brought Joplin a steady income for life, though he did not reach this level of success again and frequently had financial problems. In 1901 Joplin moved to St. Louis, where he continued to compose and publish, and regularly performed in the community. The score to his first opera A Guest of Honor was confiscated in 1903 with his belongings for non-payment of bills, and is now considered lost.In 1907, Joplin moved to New York City to find a producer for a new opera. He attempted to go beyond the limitations of the musical form that made him famous, but without much monetary success. His second opera, Treemonisha, was never fully staged during his lifetime. In 1916, Joplin descended into dementia as a result of syphilis. He was admitted to a mental institution in January 1917, and died there three months later at the age of 48. Joplin's death is widely considered to mark the end of ragtime as a mainstream music format; over the next several years, it evolved with other styles into stride, jazz, and eventually big band swing. Joplin's music was rediscovered and returned to popularity in the early 1970s with the release of a million-selling album recorded by Joshua Rifkin. This was followed by the Academy Award-winning 1973 film The Sting that featured several of Joplin's compositions, most notably \"The Entertainer\", whose performance by pianist Marvin Hamlisch received wide airplay. Treemonisha was finally produced in full, to wide acclaim, in 1972. In 1976, Joplin was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize.\n\nBirthplace : St. Louis, Missouri, USA\n\nScott Stewart Bakula (; born October 9, 1954) is an American actor, singer and director. His primary lead roles were in two science-fiction television series: as Sam Beckett on Quantum Leap, and as Captain Jonathan Archer on Star Trek: Enterprise. For Quantum Leap he received four Emmy Award nominations and a Golden Globe Award. Bakula starred on the comedy-drama series Men of a Certain Age, and guest-starred in seasons two and three of NBC's Chuck as the title character's father Stephen J. Bartowski. From 2014 to 2015, he played entrepreneur Lynn in the only two seasons of the HBO show Looking. In 2014, he began playing Special Agent Dwayne Cassius \"King\" Pride on NCIS: New Orleans.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nScott David Mechlowicz (born January 17, 1981) is an American actor. Mechlowicz began his professional career in 2003, and is best known for his lead role in EuroTrip.\n\nBirthplace : Regina, Canada\n\nScott Wesley Hartnell (born April 18, 1982) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger who played 17 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Nashville Predators, Philadelphia Flyers and Columbus Blue Jackets. Hartnell was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, but grew up in Lloydminster, Alberta.\n\nBirthplace : Brooklyn, New York, USA\n\nScott Baio, a distinguished figure in the entertainment industry, carved out an exceptional career with his striking talent in acting and directing. Born in Brooklyn, New York, on September 22, 1960, Baio's interest in performing arts sparked at a young age. Baio's dedication led him to rise through the ranks, eventually becoming one of the prominent figures on American television. His journey in the world of acting commenced with commercials before he landed his breakthrough role in the sitcom Happy Days, catapulting him to stardom. Baio's impressive portrayal of Charles \"Chachi\" Arcola in Happy Days earned him wide acclaim, leading to his own spin-off series, Joanie Loves Chachi. His success was not confined to these roles alone. Baio went on to showcase his versatility by portraying various characters in TV shows like Charles in Charge, Diagnosis Murder, and Arrested Development. Baio's charm and charismatic screen presence made him a household name, and he remains an enduring figure in the entertainment industry. Beyond acting, Baio expanded his creative horizons into directing, most notably for the television series Charles in Charge and The Wayans Bros. His directorial pursuits further strengthened his foothold in the industry, proving his multi-dimensional skills. While Baio's accomplishments in the entertainment field are remarkable, his philanthropic efforts also deserve recognition. He established the Bailey Baio Angel Foundation, dedicated to raising awareness and providing financial aid to families affected by metabolic disorders.\n\nBirthplace : Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA\n\nScott Kevin Walker (born November 2, 1967) is an American politician who served as the 45th Governor of Wisconsin from 2011 to 2019. He is a member of the Republican Party. Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Walker was raised in Iowa and in Delavan, Wisconsin. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1992, representing a district in western Milwaukee County. In 2002, Walker was elected Milwaukee County Executive in a special election following the resignation of F. Thomas Ament; he was elected for a full term in 2004 and was re-elected in 2008. Walker ran for Governor of Wisconsin in 2006, but dropped out of the race before the primary election. He ran again in 2010 and won. Shortly after his inauguration in 2011, Walker gained national attention by introducing the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill; the legislation proposed to limit collective bargaining for most Wisconsin public employees. In response, opponents of the bill protested at the Wisconsin State Capitol and Senate Democrats left the state in an effort to prevent the bill from being passed. Nevertheless, the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill became law in March 2011. Opposition to the law led to an attempt to recall Walker from office in 2012. Walker prevailed in the recall election, becoming the first incumbent governor in the history of the United States to win a recall election. In 2014, Walker defeated his Democratic challenger, businesswoman and Madison School Board member Mary Burke. For a brief period in 2015, Walker was a candidate for his party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election. Walker sought a third term as governor in 2018, but was defeated by Democrat Tony Evers."
