        "text": "Emilia Clarke as Sarah in 'Terminator Genisys’\n\nWhile Clarke was trying to make a name for herself as a movie star and not just the star of Game of Thrones, she took a role in Terminator Genisys…something she now regrets.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, she said that she watched director Alan Taylor, who frequently directed GoT, get “eaten and chewed up on Terminator. He was not the director I remembered. He didn’t have a good time. No one had a good time.”\n\nShe added that she was “relieved” that the film didn’t do well at the box office so that she wouldn’t have to do any sequels.\n\nDev Patel as Prince Zuko in ‘The Last Airbender’ The Last Airbender never received great reviews: The movie was surrounded by controversy about whitewashing, and fans weren’t thrilled with the film’s take on the franchise. Apparently, neither was Patel, who starred in the film. During The Hollywood Reporter Actor Roundtable, Patel said he \"saw a stranger on the screen that I couldn't relate to\" when watching the film. He added, “I don't know what I would like to play, but I know what I'm afraid of playing: those big studio movies. After Slumdog, I did a film that was not well received at all. The budget of Slumdog was like the budget of the craft services of this movie. And I completely felt overwhelmed by the experience. I felt like I wasn't being heard. That was really scary for me, and that's really when I learned the power of no, the idea of saying no. Listen to that instinct you get when you read those words for the first time.\"\n\nThe Last Airbender never received great reviews: The movie was surrounded by controversy about whitewashing, and fans weren’t thrilled with the film’s take on the franchise.

Listen to that instinct you get when you read those words for the first time.\"\n\nGwyneth Paltrow as Rosemary in ‘Shallow Hal’\n\nShallow Hal isn’t a movie that aged very well, and Paltrow seems to know that, as she seriously regrets ever starring in it. In an interview with Netflix, Paltrow called the movie a “disaster.” She went on to say, “The first day I tried the fat suit on, I was in the Tribeca Grand and I walked through the lobby. It was so sad. It was so disturbing. No one would make eye contact with me because I was obese. For some reason the clothes they make for women that are overweight are horrible. I felt humiliated because people were really dismissive.”\n\nMark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams in ‘Boogie Nights’\n\nWahlberg dislikes his role in Boogie Nights so much that he has literally begged God for forgiveness just for doing it. In the film, Wahlberg plays Dirk Diggler, an A-list porn star. When speaking about it to Chicago Inc., he said, “I just always hope that God is a movie fan and also forgiving because I’ve made some poor choices in my past.” He added, “Boogie Nights is up there at the top of the list.”\n\nPenn Badgley as Joe in ‘You’\n\nJoe Goldberg, the main character of You, isn’t a good guy, and Badgley is fully aware of that. He’s also fully aware that many fans have developed a crush on Joe regardless, and he’s definitely not a fan of that. In an interview on The Today Show, Badgley explained, “He’s a pretty reprehensible guy. You start to discover his true motives pretty early on—eight minutes into the show. And he’s a guy who’s capable of stalking, he’s a guy who’s capable of murder, he’s a guy who’s capable of a lot of manipulation and abuse.”\n\nIn another interview with Vanity Fair, Badgley discussed the second season of the show and talked about his further dislike of Joe, saying, “He's always saying, ‘If only I could show you who I really am. Up until that point, he's never been able to do that…Then he gets it, and he's a total dick about it. That was when I was like, ‘Joe, I've never liked you less! I've never liked you less.’”\n\nMandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon in ‘Criminal Minds’\n\nMandy Patinkin starred in the CBS series, but abruptly left the show in 2007 after the second season, which was a shock to viewers. For Patinkin, it was the right decision. He told New York Magazine, “The biggest public mistake I ever made was that I chose to do Criminal Minds in the first place. I thought it was something very different. I never thought they were going to kill and rape all these women every night, every day, week after week, year after year. It was very destructive to my soul and my personality. After that, I didn’t think I would get to work in television again.”\n\nAllison Williams as Marnie in 'Girls'\n\n\"Marnie would drive me crazy if we were friends in real life,\" Williams told BuzzFeed. \"But I have to put that out of my head in order to play her. Like, sleeping with Elijah (Andrew Rannells) is crazy, sleeping with Ray (Alex Karpovsky) is crazy, furiously hitting on Desi (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) when he mentions his girlfriend in their first conversation is crazy; but I have to be on the couch with her and Elijah hoping they fuck, I have to be in that apartment with Ray kinda wanting it to happen, and I have to support her quest for Desi.\"\n\nThe thing that Marnie did that Williams' struggled with most was her decision to sleep with artist Booth Jonathan (Jorma Taccone) in season 2 of Girls. \"I was fighting that the whole time as Allison,\" she says, with a sigh. \"I did not want her to go down that road. I thought Marnie was better than that, but she wasn't, so I had to be okay with it too. I had to believe Booth was a genius when I walked out of that TV tower, whereas I, as Allison, couldn't stop thinking, It puts the lotion on its skin.\"\n\nRobert Pattinson as Edward Cullen in 'Twilight'\n\nRobert Pattinson hates Twilight, hates Edward, and hates how everyone likes both. (P.S. There's even a Tumblr devoted to his interviews where he has to talk about Twilight, and ultimately makes fun of it.) Perhaps the best quote: \"He's the most ridiculous person...the more I read the script, the more I hated this guy...Plus, he's a 108 year-old virgin so he's obviously got some issues there.\"\n\nKate Winslet as Rose in 'Titanic'\n\nEven though Kate doesn't hate Titanic the film, she's not too thrilled with her performance as Rose when looking back. \"Every single scene, I'm like 'Really, really? You did it like that?' Oh my God...Even my American accent, I can't listen to it. It's awful,\" she told the Telegraph. \"Hopefully it's so much better now. It sounds terribly self indulgent, but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, 'Oh God, I want to do that again.'\"\n\nAdam Brody as Seth Cohen on 'The O.C.'\n\nIt's not that Adam Brody hates the character he played on The O.C., it's that he hates talking about him now. (Understandable.) In an interview with the Huffington Post, the actor got candid about why he's kind of annoyed to keep talking about Seth. \"It gets boring, that's all. The only way it bothers me—it's not that I'm not proud of it—it's that I've exhausted the conversations about it, in my mind,\" Brody said. \"Forgive me for comparing myself in any way—and I'm not—but Harrison Ford, I understand why he would be crotchety talking about Star Wars.\"\n\nBlake Lively as Serena Van Der Woodsen on 'Gossip Girl'\n\nIn an interview with Allure, Lively explained that playing such a privileged and troubled character on Gossip Girl was at times \"personally compromising.\" \"It's a weird thing when people feel like they know you really well, and they don't,\" Lively said. \"I would not be proud to be the person who gave someone the cocaine that made them overdose and then shot someone and slept with someone else's boyfriend.\"\n\n\"People loved it, but it always felt a little personally compromising—you want to be putting a better message out there,\" she said. \"The lines become blurred…It doesn't help when everybody is dating who they're dating on the show, and you're also saying to the costume designer, 'Hey, can I take that home?'\"\n\nMegan Fox as Mikaela Banes in 'Transformers'\n\nAs the star of the first two Transformers films, when asked whether she'd star in the third, Fox told Entertainment Weekly, \"Sure. I mean, I can't sh-t on this movie because it did give me a career and open all these doors for me. But I don't want to blow smoke up people's ass. People are well aware that this is not a movie about acting. And once you realize that, it becomes almost fun because you can be in the moment and go, 'All right, I know that when he calls 'Action!' I'm either going to be running or screaming, or both.'\"\n\nShe also later called director Michael Bay both misogynistic and a \"nightmare,\" saying that he once had her clean his Ferrari and had her on a skin-tanning regimen.\n\nColin Farrell as Crockett in 'Miami Vice'\n\nFarrell starred in the 2006 film alongside Jamie Foxx and clearly wasn't a fan. \"Miami Vice? I didn't like it so much,\" Farrell said in 2010. “I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.\"\n\nJustin Guarini as Justin in 'From Justin to Kelly'\n\nOn a 2013 episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? Guarini called the 2003 film \"abysmal,\" although he did call the production an \"unbelievable experience.\" Guarini starred alongside Kelly Clarkson in the 2003 musical/comedy after Clarkson won the first season of American Idol and Guarini was the runner-up.\n\nKelly Clarkson as Kelly in 'From Justin to Kelly'\n\nClarkson wasn't a fan of the flick either. In a 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, she was asked whether she burned all of the copies of the film yet to which she replied, \"No, I think I would have to own it first. But that is something I will look into. I have a little joke with our nanny, because she told me she loves that movie. She was like, 'My roommate and I used to watch it all the time! I'm totally going to show your daughter From Justin to Kelly.' I'm like, 'I will fire you.'\"\n\nBrad Pitt as Rory in 'The Devil’s Own'\n\nIn a 1997 issue of Newsweek, Pitt admits the thriller/drama released the same year was \"the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I’ve ever seen.”\n\nPenn Badgley as Dan in 'Gossip Girl'\n\nThough Badgley didn't directly state he hated his character on Gossip Girl, he did reference the show and its flaws on multiple occasions. He tweeted in 2015, \"Lol shit we are *reclining* on New York City. I'm posted up like its a futon. Talk about an image of white privilege.\" He also told Salon back in 2013, \"To be proud of something is a really nice feeling...and it’s a new feeling. It’s something that I wanna keep going with.\" (Gossip Girl aired from 2007–2012.)\n\nCher in 'Burlesque'\n\n\"It could have been a much better film. It was always sad that it was not a good film,\" she told The Guardian in 2013, calling director Steve Antin a \"really terrible director.\" \"I remember [Antin] saying to me, 'I don't care about what you say, I just want to shoot the dance numbers.'\"\n\nJim Carrey as Colonel Stars & Stripes in 'Kick-Ass 2'\n\nCarrey starred in the 2013 thriller Kick-Ass 2, released less than a year following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. He tweeted, \"I did Kick-Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence.\"\n\nKatherine Heigl as Alison in 'Knocked Up'\n\nWhen asked about the 2007 film, Heigl told Vanity Fair, “It was a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight. I had a hard time with it, on some days. I’m playing such a b*tch; why is she being such a killjoy? Why is this how you’re portraying women?

My first reaction [to seeing the film] was that we took it too far,” said Lawrence. “But then after the images died down a little bit, [the movie’s] exactly what we’re supposed to be doing and what we need to be doing.
