        "text": "For the first time in 43 years, Hollywood’s actors will officially go on strike. SAG-AFTRA announced its approval of a walkout on Thursday, joining the ongoing writers strike that has delayed film and TV productions since early May. After the actors’ contract expired on Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. PT, SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee voted unanimously to recommend a strike.\n\nFran Drescher, the guild’s president, said in a statement, “SAG-AFTRA negotiated in good faith and was eager to reach a deal that sufficiently addressed performer needs, but the AMPTP’s responses to the union’s most important proposals have been insulting and disrespectful of our massive contributions to this industry. The companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us.”\n\nA strike will effectively bring Hollywood to a halt—just after splashy premieres for Barbie and Oppenheimer, as well as nominations for the 2023 Emmy Awards. Stars of those films, including Margot Robbie, Cillian Murphy, and Emily Blunt, have weighed in on an imminent demonstration, as have several newly minted Emmy nominees who spoke to Vanity Fair this week, before the strike was officially declared. Ahead, a collection of celebrity reactions to the strike.\n\nGeorge Clooney\n\nIn a statement shared with Deadline, Clooney said “actors and writers in large numbers have lost their ability to make a living,” adding, “This is an inflection point in our industry. For our industry to survive that has to change. For actors, that journey starts now.”\n\nKeke Palmer\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nCynthia Nixon\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKim Cattrall\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJessica Chastain\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBrian Cox\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJohn Cusack\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPadma Lakshmi\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nGlen Powell\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOctavia Spencer\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMark Ruffalo\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPatton Oswalt\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nYvette Nicole Brown\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMatt Damon\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRiley Keough\n\nThe actor told Vanity Fair: “Yeah, it’s a very strange time and we’re very uncharted, and I don’t know what to expect, but I feel proud to stand in solidarity with my fellow film community, like my second family. I love this community so much and I love the support within this community, and I’m hoping for a resolution soon.\n\n“I think, of course, there’s concern. There’s people that aren’t able to work at the moment who need to be working. I don’t think it would be good to put all these screenwriters and actors out of jobs for very long. So again, I’m really hoping that they can come to terms and figure it out sooner than later.”\n\nCillian Murphy\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph\n\nThe actor to VF: “Strikes are very difficult. Nobody wants to be in strike mode, but sometimes you have got to do what needs to be done. And I know as difficult as it is, people have to remember if real workers did not come together and organize, none of us would have a weekend. Because there was a time where workers worked seven days a week and it was unheard-of for them to get time off. So I just want everybody to understand that this isn’t about making more millions of dollars, because quiet as it’s kept, at least 80% of our union are plain old, ordinary, hardworking people who haven’t gotten a cost of living raise in 40 years, who are depending upon the kindness of big corporations, many of whom sometimes don’t really know what it is to be an artist. God bless them, you need people who can crunch numbers, but when it starts to crunch people, that’s not good. That is not good. And there’s something that must be changed about how business is done in show business in Hollywood, because the artists, the performers, the writers, are getting squeezed and it’s not right.”\n\nMargot Robbie\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe\n\nThe actor to VF: “The strike is what we’re all talking about at the moment. I am one of the very, very lucky and rare actors that has a strong position to negotiate from when I work. That is not the experience of most people, and I do think both the actors and writers who are currently striking, nobody wants these things to happen—but I think they’re incredibly necessary for the way the industry is going. Technology has changed so much about the industry in the last 10 years, it feels like it’s absolutely time. There will need to be a recalibration in order for everybody to work still, to be able to attract great people to the industry, great writers and great actors. And also along with all the AI stuff, which also—that feels very important right now. We are probably one of the first industries that’s going to have a say in how this stuff affects us. It’s going to be probably the first of many that will have some version of this conversation. I think it’s very important that we do take a stand on that.”\n\nEmily Blunt\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNathan Lane\n\nThe actor to VF: “It seems like everybody—people are painting signs, it seems like it’s gonna happen. One hopes there’s a deus ex machina.”\n\n(So will you be on the picket lines?) “Oh, sure. I’ll bring croissants and coffee; we’ll make a day of it. No, it’s obviously—just as it is for the writers, it’s an important thing; important issues to be dealt with, AI, all those issues. And compensation, with the streamers, I honestly don’t understand all of it, but I realize how important it is for everyone trying to make a living. So yes, I’m in full support. But I hope that maybe there might be a miracle.”\n\nKenneth Branagh\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAunjanue Ellis\n\nThe actor to VF: “It’s utterly frustrating. It really is the haves versus the have-nots, and just the incredible imbalance between folks who have most of the money and folks who don’t have the money at all. I did well this year and a half, but that’s this year and a half. The amount of money that I made last year, I haven’t made that because I’m working on a small, indie movie, and that’s not gonna pay me what I got paid to do Justified. There’s a lot of inequity, a lot of inequality. That has to be addressed. And I just feel that there is just a lack of respect. There’s a lack of respect for writers. There’s a lack of respect for actors, you know?\n\n“With the whole AI thing, it’s like, okay, if you’re gonna replace the writers, you’re gonna replace the actors—let’s replace some directors. Let’s replace some producers. You know what I mean? Since we are replacing folks, if we have no value other than our image—who ultimately needs to be replaced? I’m standing with the WGA. I stand with SAG-AFTRA. I’m probably going to hit the picket line today, actually, for a little bit.”\n\nJamie Lee Curtis\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nPaul Walter Hauser\n\nThe actor to VF: “I put my faith in God, not men, because powerful men are often greedy and they run these big companies, and you can’t really rely on them to look out for you. I’m hoping that the heart of the streamers and studios is a little more George Bailey and a little less Mr. Potter. I really hope the union flexes its muscles ’cause we are incredibly strong, especially with our siblings at the WGA.”\n\nMaria Shriver\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJ. Smith-Cameron\n\nThe actor to VF: “I hope we strike too, frankly.” If SAG-AFTRA does strike, the actor said, “I’m looking at some theater things. I’m just trying to think of plays I’ve always wanted to do. And I’m just trying to, in the back of my mind, think of maybe potential theater projects, because that’s really how I started and what I did for decades. So it’s a good opportunity for me to think about that. Other than that, I guess I just am trying to help manifest that all the—both for SAG and for the writers guild, that they reach some fair agreements and that we can go on working.”\n\nJosh Gad\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nDominique Fishback\n\nThe actor to VF: “I think I’m in a place in my life where I learned from past hardship and suffering that the suffering comes from resisting what is and trying to be in control of things that are just not in your control. So I’m not dwelling on the strike. I support actors. I am an actor. Especially for [a SAG strike] to happen possibly on this day where I’m also celebrating Dre [her Emmy-nominated role in Swarm]—there was a lot of hard work and heart and soul and time that went into that role. I stand with SAG and whatever choice that is made.”\n\nJack Quaid\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJames Cromwell\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMichael Rapaport\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJessica Williams\n\nThe actor to VF: “I’m nervous. I have a bit of anxiety. I’m picketing not only as a stand of solidarity with the writers and learning more about my union, but it also makes me feel good. It’s something to do because right now it feels pretty endless and complicated and sad. And it’s good to walk and stand in solidarity because it feels like we’re doing something.”\n\nClark Gregg\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBailee Madison\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWith additional reporting by Anthony Breznican, David Canfield, Rebecca Ford, Chris Murphy, and Katey Rich"
