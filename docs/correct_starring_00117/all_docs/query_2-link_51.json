He also directed a number of projects, including Stir Crazy, Hanky Panky, and Ghost Dad.\n\nAs well as being a decorated actor, he was also an international diplomat, serving as the Bahamian ambassador to Japan between 1997 and 2007, and to UNESCO between 2002 and 2007. Knighted in 1974, in 2009 he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the US, by Barack Obama.\n\nPoitier died aged 94, primarily of heart failure after also suffering from Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer, according to his death certificate.
