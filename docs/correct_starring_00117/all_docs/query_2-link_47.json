The sky’s the limit for this rising star!\n\nAyo Edebiri\n\nIf 2023 is an indicator of this breakout American actor, writer, comedian, and producer’s future success, Ayo is set to dominate 2024.

Although Pete may seem bemused at his fame, we see why this talented comedy star shines bright.\n\nBella Hadid\n\nThe American supermodel doesn’t restrict her influence singularly to the runway. Despite making 29 appearances on international Vogue covers, to date, and being crowned British Fashion Council’s Model of the Year in 2022, she often uses her platform to help others who struggle with mental health issues and in doing so has opened up about her own anxiety.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nFinding her calling early, Gigi landed her first modeling job aged two and could be called one of the first ‘Instagram models’. In the last ten years she’s walked in fashion shows for almost every major designer and has risen to become one of the industry’s highest paid models. Selling out everything she’s pictured in, her cool-girl status never wanes.\n\nHailey Bieber\n\nTrend-setters have been watching the American model and influencer’s rise to fame for years and her personal connections do no harm when it comes to keeping her in the spotlight. Daughter of Stephen Baldwin, niece of Alec, wife to Justin Bieber and best friend to Kendall and Kylie Jenner, she claims to wear the ‘nepo baby’ label with pride. Followers continue to pore over what she wears next.\n\nHalima Aden\n\nA role model for young Muslim women the world over, Halima is continuing to question fashion industry standards. The first hijab-wearing model to be signed to a major agency and to grace international runways as well as the cover of British Vogue. She is resolute in her commitment to maintain her identity while inspiring others.\n\nLeena Nair\n\nStanding out as a trailblazer in the corporate world, Indian-born Leena was appointed CEO of Chanel in 2022 and has made efforts to welcome diversity and bring the fashion house into the modern day. She regularly tops power lists as the only woman of colour leading a major global luxury brand. We can’t wait to see what her Chanel era will hold.\n\nLiu Wen\n\nThis supermodel boasts a career of firsts. The first Victoria’s Secret runway star, the first Asian rep for Estée Lauder, and the first Chinese model to appear on the cover of American Vogue three times. Her almost two-decade spanning career is showing no signs of letting up as she’s a staple for Alexander McQueen and Miu Miu. It’s no wonder she has one of the biggest social media audiences in the modeling world.\n\nSofia Richie\n\nHappily shaken off her early associations with other people, Sofia – still only 25 – is going at it alone in the fashion world and has never been more culturally significant or sartorially influential. Much more than just a model, she’s credited with the rise of the “quiet luxury” – glamorous but minimalistic way of dressing – and her 2023 wedding to music executive Elliot Grainge almost broke TikTok."
