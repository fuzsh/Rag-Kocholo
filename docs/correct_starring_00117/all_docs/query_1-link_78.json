Previously, the award-winning star impressed viewers with her acting skills in multiple projects. Some of Kim So-Hyun’s K-dramas and Korean movies include Love Alarm, The Last Princess, and My Lovely Liar.\n\nShe also starred in popular series like Goblin (Guardian: The Lonely and Great God), While You Were Sleeping, and The Tale of Nokdu. She will now feature in a rom-com drama, Serendipity’s Embrace, alongside Chae Jong-Hyeop. The storyline revolves around her character, Lee Hong-Ju, who had a huge crush on Kang Hu-Yeong in high school. Before graduating, she confessed her love to him but ended up heartbroken. As a result, she lacks confidence towards her romantic life.\n\nSeveral years pass and one day, Hong-Ju coincidentally bumps into her first love. A rollercoaster of emotions goes through the lead characters’ minds and hearts. Will Hong-Ju get a second chance? Serendipity’s Embrace will premiere on July 22, 2024, on tvN. Meanwhile, here are some of Kim So-Hyun’s best K-dramas and Korean movies.\n\nLove Alarm\n\nLove Alarm is a 2019 K-drama, starring So-Hyun, Jung Ga-Ram, and Song Kang. On Netflix, the synopsis reads, “In a world where an app alerts people if someone in the vicinity likes them, Kim Jojo experiences young love while coping with personal adversities.” It is a complicated love story between three characters — Kim Jo-Jo, Lee Hye-Yeong, and Hwang Sun-Oh. Jo-Jo is an orphan living with her aunt and doesn’t have a smartphone. Hence, she is one of the rare school students who has not used the Love Alarm app. Furthermore, she doesn’t know that Hye-Yeong likes her.\n\nMeanwhile, Sun-Oh is a popular student and Hye-Yeong is his best friend. But things get nasty when he decides to test Hye-Yeong’s love for Jo-Jo. He kisses her, which hinders Sun-Oh and Hye-Yeong’s friendship. The K-drama consists of two seasons, which are available to stream on Netflix.\n\nMy Lovely Liar\n\nMy Lovely Liar is a 2023 drama, featuring So-Hyun as Mok Sol-Hee and Hwang Min-Hyun as Kim Do-Ha. In the romance series, Sol-Hee is a young woman with the superpower of hearing lies. She can hear other people’s lies, no matter how much the person tries to hide them. Due to this, she has no faith in anyone as it turns out everyone is a liar in her life. However, things change when she meets her new neighbor Do-Ha.\n\nHe is a popular music producer who has somehow gotten entangled in a murder case. To hide himself, he has moved into the apartment next door to Sol-Hee. Interestingly, the latter’s superpowers do not work on Do-Ha. She believes he is a man who never lies. What happens when Sol-Hee learns his secret? Viewers can watch the K-drama on Viki.\n\nUnforgettable\n\nUnforgettable is a 2016 Korean movie, starring Kim So-Hyun and Doh Kyung-Soo in lead roles. It tells the story of a radio DJ named Hyung-Joon receiving a letter from his first love. It brings up the memories of his beloved from 23 years ago. The story focuses on those past moments of five friends spending summer together.\n\nSoo-Ok, who suffers a leg injury, finds comfort in Beom-Sil (adult name: Hyung-Joon). The latter is in love with her and shares heart-fluttering moments throughout the film. Does he get a happy ending? Viewers will have to watch the movie to find out.\n\nThe Last Princess\n\nThe Last Princess (2016) is another one of So-Hyun’s movie. It bagged numerous accolades. The synopsis reads, “The last remaining princess of the Joseon Dynasty leaves her home for Japan, under Japanese colonial rule. Her childhood friend makes a vow to retrieve her and help her make her way back to Korea.” Son Ye-Jin plays the character of Princess Deok-Hye while her younger version is played by So-Hyun. Park Hae-Il essays the role of her childhood friend, Jang Han.\n\nAside from the K-dramas and movies mentioned above, So-Hyun has also appeared in several other projects. She has showcased her acting talent for a long time since she started as a child actor. Meanwhile, the star will be next seen on tvN’s Serendipity’s Embrace.
