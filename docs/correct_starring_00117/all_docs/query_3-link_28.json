        "text": "Not all best picture reveals spark quite as much excitement as the Moonlight/La La Land snafu of the 2017 Oscars, but for the casts and crews of each, winning the Academy’s grand prize will always be a moment to remember.\n\nFrom 1929’s Wings to 2023’s Everything Everywhere All at Once, best picture winners throughout the years have spanned multiple subjects and genres, including period epics like Victor Fleming’s Gone with the Wind, musical adaptations like George Cukor’s My Fair Lady and athletic dramas like Clint Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby. Many, such as Michael Curtiz’s Casablanca and Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, have maintained their ranks among the most celebrated and studied films of all time.\n\nMore recent titleholders include Argo, 12 Years a Slave, Birdman, Spotlight, Moonlight, The Shape of Water, Green Book, Parasite, Nomadland and current champion Everything Everywhere All at Once. Leading the race for filmmakers with the most best picture nominations is Steven Spielberg, though he only took home the golden trophy once, for 1993’s Holocaust drama Schindler’s List. More repeat winners and nominees include Coppola, Eastwood, Sam Spiegel, Peter Jackson, Cecil B. DeMille and Christopher Nolan.\n\nSee the full list of all 95 best picture winners, as well as their directors, casts and additional Oscar wins, below."
