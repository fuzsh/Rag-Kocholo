        "text": "Elliot has been on several TV shows, including The Fosters. In one scene of the series, his transgender character had an intimate scene with a cisgender character, which is very likely the first time that's happened on U.S. network television.\n\n\"I hope that people watching this show can see how it's not only normal, but how loving and sweet and romantic it can be,\" he told TVGuide.com.\n\nJuliana made history playing Nikki on Raven's Home, the first trans character on Disney Channel.\n\n\"The reality is that most [people in] this country have never met a trans person, let alone knows and engages with one personally,\" she told Refinery29. \"What they see on TV about us is how they form their opinions and what they start to believe. We need to put [our stories] out there until they become the norm.\"\n\nHunter's portrayal of Jules in Euphoria is an example of the importance of trans representation for teens. In the show, Jules is very open about her identity and is confident in herself.\n\nStill, Hunter believes the media still has a long way to go when it comes to trans representation. \"There need to be more roles where trans people aren't just dealing with being trans; they're being trans while dealing with other issues,\" she told Variety. \"We're so much more complex than just one identity.\"\n\nSchwoz from Henry Danger told Time in 2019 he \"was misgendered at birth.\" He transitioned in 2000. \"I identify as male, and I am proud that I have had a transgender experience — a transgender journey.\"\n\nMichael's co-star and lead of Henry Danger, Jace Norman, told Time in an email that Michael's transition \"didn’t change anything about the high level of respect and admiration [he has] for the guy.\" Jace also said, \"It’s in the best interest of the entire world to have every type of person represented on TV.\"\n\nYou can currently see Hennessy in Broadway's Sweeney Todd revival. \"As soon as I started really coming into myself, being able to look in the mirror and recognize myself, people started wanting to work with me more,\" he told Playbill. According to the outlet, Hennessy is one of only a few openly out trans male Broadway actors.\n\nZaya Wade is the 15-year-old daughter of retired NBA player Dwyane Wade. After she publicly came out as trans in 2019, Dwyane told The Today Show that being her dad has helped him grow.\n\n\"I didn't know anything, really wasn't knowledgeable about the LGBTQ+ community,\" he said. \"What it has done is it opened my eyes and my ears to something greater and bigger than I, and my daughter has allowed us gracefully to be her support system. She's the strong one in this family. She's a hero.\"\n\nPetey played C on Alert: Missing Persons Unit and had a scene where his character revealed to his crush that he's transgender. This was also the moment the audience learned C is transgender.\n\n\"My greatest hope, for folks that don’t think they know a trans person, is that they are able to draw a straight line between having loved this guy before and finding out he’s trans,\" Petey told GLAAD. \"Now they know a trans person — a smart, trustworthy, loving guy who also is trans.\"\n\nAfter showing off photos of her changing style and appearance on Instagram for a year, Tommy Dorfman announced she's trans in an interview with Time in July 2021.\n\n\"I kept, on Instagram, a diaristic time capsule instead—one that shows a body living in a more fluid space,\" she explained about her decision to continue posting on social media. \"However, I’ve learned as a public-facing person that my refusal to clarify can strip me of the freedom to control my own narrative. With this medical transition, there has been discourse about my body, and it began to feel overwhelming. So, recently I looked to examples of others who have come out as trans. There’s the version I couldn’t really afford to do, which is to disappear for two years and come back with a new name, new face and new body. But that’s not what I wanted.\"\n\nIf you recognize Zión, it's because she's currently staring as Luna in the Gossip Girl reboot on HBO Max. Luna is actually the first trans character in the show's history, but showrunner Joshua Safran said Luna's identity won't come up in the plot this season.\n\n\"I don’t know how oblique there is of a reference to it,\" he told Variety. \"But yeah, Luna is a trans woman in the show. We decided as writers that this isn’t a show that’s about how she became her authentic self. That’s just not our story. Luna is Luna to these people, and that’s that.\"\n\nIn December 2020, Elliot revealed on social media that he is trans and goes by he/they pronouns. \"I feel lucky to be writing this. To be here. To have arrived at this place in my life,\" he wrote. \"I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey. I can't begin to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self. I've been endlessly inspired by so many in the trans community.\"\n\nThey ended their note, writing, \"I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive. To all trans people who deal with harassment, self-loathing, abuse, and the threat of violence every day: I see you, I love you and I will do everything I can to change this world for the better. Thank you for reading this. All my love, Elliot.\"\n\nAfter she landed a starring role on Netflix's Orange is the New Black, Laverne Cox quickly became one of the most visible trans actresses in mainstream media.
