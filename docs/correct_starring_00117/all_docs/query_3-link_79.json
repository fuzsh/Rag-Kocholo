        "text": "The late ’90s and early 2000’s were a grand time for television. The Moesha spinoff show The Parkers (1999-2004) was one show that guaranteed laughs. Viewers loved to see what situation the mother-daughter duo Nikki (Mo’Nique) and Kim Parker (Countess Vaughn) would get themselves into each week. Terms like “Heeeey” and “Dang Mama” made its way to mainstream lingo and made the series even more popular.\n\nAlmost 10 years after the show’s end, some of the cast has truly made it big, while others faded out of the limelight. Vixen decided to see what the funny cast has been up to after all these years.\n\nCheck it Out!\n\nPhoto Credit: Wikipedia\n\nMo’Nique – Nicole Ann “Nikki” Parker\n\nMo’Nique has journeyed a long way since her Nikki Parker days. Since the shows end, the actress has become a multifaceted Vixen. In 2006 she released a book Skinny Women Are Evil: Notes of a Big Girl in a Small-Minded World which quickly became a best seller.\n\nThe funny girl’s big claim to fame came with her role as an inner-city teenager’s abusive mother in the award-winning film Precious. She won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. BET also aired a late night talk show entitled The Mo’Nique Show in 2009, where the comedian interviewed other fellow celebs.\n\nCurrently, Mo’Nique has shed the pounds and is no longer a big girl. She posts updates to her Twitter of her journey to be fit.\n\nPhoto Credit: People\n\nCountess Vaughn – Kimberly Ann “Kim” Parker\n\nAfter making the familiar catch phrase “Heeeey” famous, Countess lives life in the quiet lane these days.\n\nHer path until now has been an emotional roller coaster, but she has survived. In 2006, she appeared in the third season of Vh1’s Celebrity Fit Club where fans got to see her go through an emotional divorce. A year later during filming of MTV’s Celebrity Rap Superstar, she became allergic to all the glue that she was wearing to keep her wigs on and her scalp became infected, causing her to leave the show.\n\nIn 2011, Vaughn made a return to TV series for one episode of BET’s Let’s Stay Together. She was able to tell her story of life after The Parkers in TV One’s Life After series. Currently, Countess plays mom to her three children and loves every bit of it.\n\nPhoto Credit: Twitter\n\nDorien Wilson – Professor Stanley De’Vanté Oglevee\n\nProfessor Oglevee’s character may have made him famous, but the show, he made several appearances on shows from That’s So Raven to Tyler Perry’s House of Payne.\n\nIn 2011 he was a guest on the Mo’Nique show where he discussed his struggle with being a functioning alcoholic and his one man show Unringing the Bell.\n\nCurrently he keeps himself busy by being a father, making appearances at events and continuing his road to sobriety.\n\nPhoto Credit: Wikipedia\n\nJenna von Oÿ – Stevie Van Lowe\n\nKnown as the white girl with a booty on The Parkers, the singer/actress remains under the radar these days. When the show ended, she appeared in a television movie Marsha Potter Gets a Life and an episode of Cold Case. She released her debut album in 2007 entitled Breathing Room.\n\nCurrently, she is a proud mommy to a baby girl named Gray Audrey. Jenna keeps relative as a celebrity blogger for People.com and her own blog The Cradle Chronicles.\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty\n\nKen Lawson – Thaddeus “T” Radcliffe\n\nThe cute yet thuggish bestie of Kim was always a nice piece of eye candy to behold. Once the show ended the actor/musician who goes by the name Ken L took a break to focus on his music.\n\nHe continues to make guest appearances on shows including TV One’s Love That Girl.\n\nPhoto Credit: IMDB\n\nYvette Wilson – Andell Wilkerson\n\nNikki’s partner in crime was always there for the good and bad. When the show ended, Yvette played one more acting role in the 2005 flick Ganked. She also appeared in HBO’s Def Comedy Jam. In 2012 Yvette passed away after a battle with cervical cancer. Her memory continues to live on through re-runs of Moesha and The Parkers.\n\nPhoto Credit: People"
