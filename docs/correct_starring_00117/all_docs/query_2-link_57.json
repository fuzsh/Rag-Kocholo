They include athletes, actors, inventors, business leaders, authors and artists.\n\nThere are about 180 famous autistic people I found as part of our research on Ongig‚Äôs series on neurodiversity. I felt inspired to list all these amazing people in one place!\n\nDisclaimers: This list includes famous people with Autism who have been diagnosed and those who have been reported or rumored to fall somewhere on the Autism spectrum. I do my best to list resources for any questionable ones and welcome feedback, additions and edits! I am not an expert on autism.\n\nCelebrities with Autism\n\nIf you had to list the very top celebrities with autism, it‚Äôd likely be this list:\n\nWoody Allen (rumored)\n\nDavid Byrne (diagnosed)\n\nDan Aykroyd (diagnosed)\n\nCharles Darwin (rumored)\n\nThomas Edison (rumored)\n\nAlbert Einstein (rumored)\n\nDarryl Hannah (diagnosed)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock (rumored)\n\nCourtney Love (diagnosed)\n\nLionel Messi (rumored)\n\nSir Isaac Newton (rumored)\n\nSteve Jobs (rumored)\n\nJerry Seinfeld (self-diagnosed)\n\nBut let‚Äôs break it down in more detail.\n\nThere are so many reported famous people with autism that I categorize them by their professional field (Actors, Athletes, Musicians, Leaders, etc.). I also added a section for celebrities with autistic children.\n\nI do my best to provide sourcing wherever I could.\n\nI hope you‚Äôre as inspired by these great humans as I am!\n\nFamous Actors with Autism (Other Entertainment Pros Too)\n\nThere are a number of celebrities with autism. Let‚Äôs start with actors:\n\nIs Sir Anthony Hopkins Autistic?

I do like to get inside their heads.‚Äù\n\nWhen asked if his Asperger‚Äôs helped him as an actor, he said:\n\n‚ÄúI definitely look at people differently. I like to deconstruct, to pull a character apart, to work out what makes them tick and my view will not be the same as everyone else. I get offered a lot of controlling parts, maybe because that‚Äôs how people see me. And maybe I am very controlled because I‚Äôve had to be. I don‚Äôt question it, I just take the parts because I‚Äôm an actor and that‚Äôs what I do.‚Äù\n\nHeather Kuzmich ‚Äì America‚Äôs Next Top Model Contestant\n\nPaige Layle ‚Äì TikTok Personality\n\nPaige Layle Talks Autism on TikTok\n\nPaige Layle is an eyelash technician from Ontario who recently went viral on TikiTok after posting a 4-part series about being an autistic woman.

Sam is autistic in the show, causing many fans to ask ‚Äúis Keir Gilchrist autistic?‚Äù\n\nThe answer is no:\n\nDespite playing an autistic character, Gilchrist is not autistic.

I Googled Jerry Seinfeld Asperger‚Äôs for a reason‚Äìbecause of how he struck me on the Garry Shandling documentary.‚Äù ‚Äî Keldra Alpine\n\n‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really look like autism. I could be mistaken but [Seinfeld] makes successful eye contact and he he can keep a conversation going. I have level 2 autism (by the new criteria, it‚Äôs moderate autism.). He doesn‚Äôt really seem autistic because 1. you need to have repetitive actions, or things, whatever 2. you need to have communication issues and 3. I can‚Äôt remember.‚Äù ‚Äî William Childs\n\n‚ÄúI am not in a position to say that he‚Äôs been misdiagnosed, but I cannot in any envision someone with ASD being a successful stand-up comedian. I could see an autistic person being comical for 10-15 minutes in front of a small group of people, but I cannot see them doing comedy night after night as a career. When I was diagnosed (in 1997, with Asperger‚Äôs, which has since merged with other forms of autism to become ASD), my understanding was that the prototype for Asperger‚Äôs were people like Isaac Newton and Immanuel Kant (both of whom neither married or had children and (in the case of Newton) quite possibly/likely died a virgin ‚Äì I guess you could say he had more interest in discovering g-forces than the g-spot). Both of these men were obsessed with discovering knowledge and (what they believed to be) eternal laws about the universe and had little interest in sociparl relations. Try as I may, I do not see any aspect of either Newton or Kant in Jerry.‚Äù ‚Äî Devin Elgert\n\nSeinfeld later walked back his comments on having Autism:\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have autism,‚Äù Seinfeld told ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not on the spectrum.‚Äù\n\nFamous Scientists with Autism, plus Inventors & Mathematicians\n\nDiagnosed with Autism\n\nBram Cohen ‚Äì Inventor of BitTorrent\n\nMichelle Dawson ‚Äì Researcher\n\nCarl Sagan ‚Äì Astronomer\n\nReported/Rumored to Have Autism\n\nHenry Cavendish ‚Äì Scientist & discoverer of Hydrogen (source: Applied Behavior Analysis Programs Guide)\n\nCharles Darwin ‚Äì Naturalist, Geologist, and Biologist (source: AspergerSyndrome.me.uk)\n\nPaul Dirac ‚Äì Professor & Physicist (source: NPR)\n\nThomas Edison ‚Äì Inventor (source: NPR)\n\nAlbert Einstein ‚Äì Mathmetician & Scientist (source: Spectrum News)\n\nAlfred Kinsey ‚Äì Biologist & Sexologist (source: Applied Behavior Analysis Programs Guide)\n\nBarbara McClintock ‚Äì Reproductive Scientist (source: Applied Behavior Analysis Programs Guide)\n\nSir Isaac Newton ‚Äì Mathematician, Astronomer, & Physicist (source: NewScientist)\n\nNikola Tesla ‚Äì Inventor (source: Applied Behavior Analysis Programs Guide)\n\nAlan Turing ‚Äì Mathematician (source: Wikipedia)\n\nFamous Writers with Autism\n\nDiagnosed with Autism\n\nMel Baggs ‚Äì Writer\n\nKage Baker ‚Äì Writer\n\nSean Barron ‚Äì Journalist\n\nLydia X.
