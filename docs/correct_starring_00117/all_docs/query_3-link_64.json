        "text": "This post will be updated frequently as movies enter and leave the service. *New titles are indicated with an asterisk.\n\nIn 2021, CBS All Access rebranded with the name Paramount+, reflecting the history of the legendary film and TV company with that nifty little mathematical sign that all the streaming companies seem to love these days. The name Paramount brings a deep catalogue of feature films, and the streaming service also includes titles from the Miramax and MGM libraries. They have also added a more robust original selection than at launch to complement the service’s classics like Gladiator, the Mission: Impossible series and Grease.\n\nFor now, Paramount+ can’t compare to the depth of a catalogue like Max’s or the award-winning original works at other streamers, but it has a solid library with at least 30 films you should see.\n\nThis Month’s Editor’s Pick\n\n*Trainspotting\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 34m\n\nDirector: Danny Boyle\n\nDanny Boyle really broke through with his second film, a beloved adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel about addiction. Ewan McGregor plays Mark Renton, the most charismatic member of a group of friends who became instantly iconic, including Spud (Ewan Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the sociopathic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Propelled by one of the best soundtracks of the ‘90s, Trainspotting has more energy than nearly anything else on Paramount+.\n\nA.I.: Artificial Intelligence\n\nYear: 2001\n\nRuntime: 2h 25m\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nThe most famous director of all time picked up the final project of Stanley Kubrick and completed it, resulting in one of the most divisive films of his career. Two decades later, it feels like most people have come around to recognize A.I. as a masterpiece. Based on a 1969 short story, it’s about an android (Haley Joel Osment) and the journey he takes to find himself. It’s really about humanity and it contains some of Spielberg’s most striking imagery ever.\n\nAnnihilation\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRuntime: 1h 55m\n\nDirector: Alex Garland\n\nParamount notoriously had no idea what to do with Alex Garland’s film and barely promoted it in American theaters, but it’s amazing. One of the best films of 2018 stars Natalie Portman as a woman who enters an alien occurrence to find out what happened to her husband there. Although that barely scratches the surface of this complex, already-beloved film.\n\nArrival\n\nYear: 2016\n\nRuntime: 1h 56m\n\nDirector: Denis Villeneuve\n\nThe beloved French director’s best film remains his adaptation of “Story of Your Life” by Ted Chiang, a tale of alien invasion that’s really more about the people on Earth than the interplanetary visitors. Amy Adams gives one of the best performances of her career as a linguist tasked with communicating with the aliens.\n\nBeverly Hills Cop\n\nYear: 1984\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Martin Brest\n\nIt’s hard to explain to people too young to experience it how big a star Eddie Murphy was in 1984 when his Axel Foley ruled the world. Murphy’s wit and charm were put to perfect use in Beverly Hills Cop that produced two inferior sequels, and both happen to also be on Paramount Plus.\n\nBig Night\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 49m\n\nDirector: Campbell Scott & Stanley Tucci\n\nIs this the best food movie ever made? It’s definitely in the top ten. Co-writer and co-director Stanley Tucci plays one half of a pair of Italian brothers—the excellent Tony Shalhoub being the other—who own a restaurant on the Jersey Shore in the ‘50s. As they struggle to keep their business afloat, we get hungrier and hungrier looking at all the mouth-watering meals they cook.\n\nBoogie Nights\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 2h 35m\n\nDirector: P.T. Anderson\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson is widely recognized as one of the best living American filmmakers now, but that wasn’t the case before the release of this masterpiece about life in the Los Angeles porn scene. Mark Wahlberg has never (and likely never will be) better than he is here, anchoring an ensemble that includes equally great work from Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds.\n\n*Caddyshack\n\nYear: 1980\n\nRuntime: 1h 38m\n\nDirector: Harold Ramis\n\nThis beloved comedy classic definitely has some funny dialogue and one-liners, but it’s also a phenomenal example of how far casting can go to make a movie timeless. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield weren’t just hysterical here, they were all perfectly cast to play off their comedy reputations. Most of all, it’s still damn funny.\n\nChinatown\n\nYear: 1974\n\nRuntime: 2h 10m\n\nDirector: Roman Polanski\n\nForget it Jake, it’s Chinatown. One of the best movies of the ‘70s, this Best Picture nominee (and Best Screenplay winner) tells the story of Jake Gittes, played unforgettably by Jack Nicholson, as he investigates an adulterer and finds something much more insidious under the surface of Los Angeles. It’s a must-see, as important as almost any film from its era.\n\nClueless\n\nYear: 1995\n\nRuntime: 1h 37m\n\nDirector: Amy Heckerling\n\nYou can keep all those stuffy Jane Austen adaptations—one of the best remains Amy Heckerling’s updating of the 1815 classic Emma to mid-‘90s L.A. Is this the most ‘90s movie ever? From its fashion to its references to its beloved characters, Clueless is certainly one of the most iconic, a movie that made a small impact when it was released but feels like it grows even more popular with each generation that discovers it.\n\nCollateral\n\nYear: 2004\n\nRuntime: 1h 59m\n\nDirector: Michael Mann\n\nTom Cruise gives one of his most fascinating performances as Vincent, the passenger to Jamie Foxx’s L.A. cab driver on a very fateful night. It turns out that Vincent is hitman and he needs Foxx’s character to drive him on a killing spree in this tense, gorgeously-shot thriller from the masterful craftsman Michael Mann.\n\nDevotion\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 2h 19m\n\nDirector: J.D. Dillard\n\nThe proximity to another little movie about pilots called Top Gun: Maverick likely hurt the bottom line of this excellent, old-fashioned drama based on a true story. The excellent Jonathan Majors plays Jesse Brown, the first Black aviator in Navy history, and Maverick star Glen Powell plays his co-pilot and friend Tom Hudner. Both young future stars are excellent in a film that viewers can now find at home.\n\nDog Day Afternoon\n\nYear: 1975\n\nRuntime: 2h 4m\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet\n\nAny list of the best performances of all time that doesn’t include Al Pacino’s work in this 1975 masterpiece is simply incorrect. Pacino plays Sonny Wortzik, a New Yorker who tries to rob a bank with his buddy Sal (John Cazale). Sidney Lumet directs a film that’s alternately as tense as any thriller and as illuminating as any character study. It’s a must-see.\n\nFinding Yingying\n\nYear: 2020\n\nRuntime: 1h 38m\n\nDirector: Jiayan “Jenny” Shi\n\nJiayan Shi directed and produced this heartbreaking documentary about the disappearance and death of Yingying Zhang in 2017. Shi has unique access to the story in that she knew Yingying, and so her film has an incredible you-are-there quality as Shi captures the investigation and grief that would emerge from this horrific crime. Paramount+ deserves credit for bringing smaller projects like this to their subscribers, ones that other major streamers might ignore.\n\nGladiator\n\nYear: 2000\n\nRuntime: 2h 34m\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nOne of the most popular films of its era, this action epic stars Russell Crowe as the legendary Maximus, a warrior whose family is murdered by the vicious Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Forced into slavery, Maximus has to rise the gladiator arenas to get his vengeance. The film made a fortune on its way to winning the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nThe Godfather\n\nYear: 1972\n\nRuntime: 2h 55m\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola\n\nMaybe you’ve heard of it? In all seriousness, there’s a very cool opportunity right now to watch the entire Godfather trilogy on Paramount+, including the superior recent cut of the third film. You could then slide from some of the best filmmaking of all time into the streaming service’s original series The Offer, about the making of Coppola’s masterpiece.\n\nInterstellar\n\nYear: 2014\n\nRuntime: 2h 49m\n\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\n\nNo one else makes movies like Christopher Nolan, a man who took his superhero success and used it to get gigantic budgets to bring his wildest dreams to the big screen. Who else could make this sprawling, emotional, complicated film about an astronaut (Matthew McConaughey) searching for a new home for humanity? It’s divisive among some Nolan fans for its deep emotions, but those who love it really love it.\n\nJackass\n\nYear: 2002\n\nRuntime: 1h 25m\n\nDirector: Jeff Tremaine\n\nJackass Forever helped 2022 start with a bang. Now you can go back and watch the whole series exclusively on Paramount+ right now! (Even the “alternate” ones like Jackass 3.5). Go back to the heyday of Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, and the rest of the dangerous idiots. These movies are often derided as being dumb but they’re a glorious, infectious kind of dumb that wants nothing more than to make you laugh.\n\nThe Lost City\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: Aaron Nee, Adam Nee\n\nWith echoes of beloved rom-coms like African Queen and Romancing the Stone, this film truly felt like an anomaly in 2022, and yet it turned into a pretty big hit at the theater. It’s already on streaming services, and it’s a great choice if you’re looking for some escapism tonight. Travel to the middle of nowhere with a romance novel writer (Sandra Bullock) and the cover model (Channing Tatum) who tries to save the day.\n\nMinority Report\n\nYear: 2002\n\nRuntime: 2h 25m\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nOne of Steven Spielberg’s best modern movies is this adaptation of a Philip K. Dick story about a future in which crime can be predicted before it happens. Tom Cruise stars as a man who is convicted of a crime he has no intent of committing in a fantastic vision of a future in which the systems designed to stop crime have been corrupted. It’s timely and probably always will be.\n\nMission: Impossible franchise\n\nYear: 1996-present\n\nRuntime: Varies\n\nDirector: Various\n\nThe whole series is finally here! For some reason, parts 1 to 3 and parts 4 to 6 have alternated residence on a lot of streaming services, but Paramount+ currently hosts the entire thing from De Palma’s first movie to Fallout. While we wait for Mission: Impossible 7, revisit the whole arc of the saga of Ethan Hunt to date.\n\nPast Lives\n\nYear: 2023\n\nRuntime: 1h 45m\n\nDirector: Celine Song\n\nA current Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay nominee, this phenomenal film isn’t on any of the other streamers. It stars the excellent Greta Lee and Teo Yoo as a couple who were close as children but reunite years later after she immigrated to the United States. It’s as much a story of what people leave behind when they change their entire lives as it is a traditional story of unrequited love. It’s beautiful and unforgettable.\n\nPineapple Express\n\nYear: 2008\n\nRuntime: 1h 52m\n\nDirector: David Gordon Green\n\nSeth Rogen gives one of his best performances as Dale Denton, an average guy who just wants to get high. He visits his dealer (played perfectly by James Franco) on the wrong night as the pair cross paths with hitmen and a police officer on the wrong side of the law. This is an incredibly funny movie, and you don’t need to be high to love it.\n\nA Quiet Place\n\nYear: 2018\n\nRuntime: 1h 30m\n\nDirector: John Krasinski\n\nWho could have possibly guessed that Jim from The Office would be behind one of the most successful horror films of the ‘10s? You’ve probably already seen this story of a world in which silence is the only way to survive, but it’s worth another look to marvel at its tight, taut filmmaking and a stellar performance from Emily Blunt. Plus, Paramount+ recently added the sequel, so: double feature time!\n\nRed Eye\n\nYear: 2005\n\nRuntime: 1h 25m\n\nDirector: Wes Craven\n\nWith one of his last great movies, the master of horror Wes Craven proved he could also do thrills without supernatural monsters. This is a film that Alfred Hitchcock would have loved, the story of an average woman (Rachel McAdams) terrorized by the guy in the seat next to her on a red-eye flight to Miami. Cillian Murphy is chilling in this memorable, tight little genre movie.\n\n*Rushmore\n\nYear: 1999\n\nRuntime: 1h 32m\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nWriter/director Wes Anderson’s best film is arguably still his second work, a brilliant coming-of-age comedy about a teenager named Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) and the love triangle that forms (at least in his mind) between him, a teacher named Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), and a wealthy man named Herman Blume (Bill Murray). Charming, eccentric, and hysterical, Rushmore is a modern classic.\n\nSaint Maud\n\nYear: 2019\n\nRuntime: 1h 24m\n\nDirector: Rose Glass\n\nRose Glass’s terrifying horror film is one of the best movies of 2021 and it’s already on Paramount+. Reminiscent of psychological nightmares of the ‘70s like Repulsion and Rosemary’s Baby, this is the tale of a hospice nurse named Maud (a fearless performance from Morfydd Clark) who becomes obsessed with saving the soul of one of her patients (Jennifer Ehle). It’s unforgettable.\n\nScream\n\nYear: 1996\n\nRuntime: 1h 51m\n\nDirector: Wes Craven\n\nThe Ghostface killer came back in January 2022 with the release of Scream, the fifth film in this franchise and the first since the death of Wes Craven, and the fun continued with another sequel in 2023 (although the troubles around the production of the seventh film have been, well, notable). Paramount+ is the best place for a marathon with the original trilogy and the fifth and sixth films (but, bizarrely, not Scream 4.) The first movie is still a flat-out genre masterpiece.\n\nThe Social Network\n\nYear: 2010\n\nRuntime: 2h\n\nDirector: David Fincher\n\nOne of the best movies of the 2010s has returned to Paramount after a brief hiatus to remind people how wildly far ahead of its time this movie was when it was released. With a razor-sharp screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and some of the best direction of David Fincher’s career, this is a flawless movie, one that resonates even more now in the era of constant internet than it did thirteen years ago.\n\nSomething Wild\n\nYear: 1986\n\nRuntime: 1h 53m\n\nDirector: Jonathan Demme\n\nJonathan Demme was a master of tonal balancing, finding a way to perfectly blend the comedy and the dread in this story of an average man caught up in a criminal’s web. Charlie (Jeff Daniels) is a milquetoast banker who goes on a wild ride with a girl named Lulu (Melanie Griffith), but everything changes when Lulu’s ex (an unforgettable Ray Liotta) enters the picture.\n\nThere Will Be Blood\n\nYear: 2007\n\nRuntime: 2h 38m\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nOne of the best films of the ‘00s, Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of Upton Sinclair’s Oil! won Daniel Day-Lewis his second Oscar as the unforgettable Daniel Plainview. As detailed and epic as great fiction, Anderson’s movie is one of the most acclaimed of its era, a film in which it’s hard to find a single flaw. Even if you think you’ve seen it enough, watch it again. You’ll find a new reason to admire it.\n\nTitanic\n\nYear: 1997\n\nRuntime: 3h 14m\n\nDirector: James Cameron\n\nMore than just a blockbuster, this Best Picture winner was a legitimate cultural phenomenon, staying at the top of the box office charts for months. There was a point when it felt like not only had everyone seen the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet), but most people had seen it twice. History has kind of reduced this epic to its quotable scenes and earworm theme song, but it’s a better movie than you remember, a great example of James Cameron’s truly robust filmmaking style.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nYear: 2022\n\nRuntime: 2h 10m\n\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\n\nIt’s the movie that saved movies last year! The truth is that Paramount wanted to drop this long-awaited sequel on a streamer during the pandemic, but Tom Cruise knew it was the kind of thing that should be appreciated in a theater. He bet on himself and the result is arguably the biggest hit of his career, a movie that made a fortune and seems primed to win Oscars in a couple months.\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street\n\nYear: 2013\n\nRuntime: 3h\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio should have won the Oscar for his amazing performance as Jordan Belfort, the financial criminal that rocked Wall Street and shocked audiences in one of Scorsese’s best late films. Arguments over whether or not this film glorifies a “bad guy” have become prominent—and could only really be made by people who haven’t actually watched it. Most of all, it’s a shockingly robust film, filmed with more energy in a few minutes than most flicks have in their entire runtime.\n\n*Zero Dark Thirty\n\nYear: 2012\n\nRuntime: 2h 37m\n\nDirector: Kathryn Bigelow\n\nIts legacy has been tarnished by history, but there’s no denying the craft at work in Kathryn Bigelow’s retelling of the hunt for Osama bin Laden, featuring one of the career-best performances from Jessica Chastain. Bigelow reunited with her The Hurt Locker writer, Mark Boal, to detail how the United States caught one of history’s most vile murderers in a film that was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIf you subscribe to a service through our links, Vulture may earn an affiliate commission."
