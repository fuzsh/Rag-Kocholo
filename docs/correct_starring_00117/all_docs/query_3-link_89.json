His other film credits include \"On the Waterfront,\" \"The Pawnbroker\" and \"Doctor Zhivago,\" among many others. His \"I coulda been a contender\" scene in \"On the Waterfront,\" with Marlon Brando, is legendary.\n\nMr. Steiger was born Rodney Stephen Steiger in Westhampton, Long Island. He attended high school in Newark, NJ, and studied at the Actors Studio. Among his contemporaries were Kim Stanley, Karl Malden, Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint and others, who stepped away from the declamatory, heightened Hollywood style of acting prominent before the 1950s.\n\nMr. Steiger's Broadway credits include Night Music, An Enemy of the People, Seagulls Over Sorrento, Rashomon and Moby Dick. The latter was the renowned 1962 production adapted by Orson Welles. His first stage appearance was in Curse You, Jack Dalton, at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark, in 1946."
