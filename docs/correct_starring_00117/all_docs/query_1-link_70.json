Backstage Books, $24.95 (376pp) ISBN 978-0-8230-8847-8\n\nA legend of stage, small and big screens, actress Kim Stanley (1925-2001) is vividly brought to life in this biography. Krampner (The Man in the Shadows) unravels many of the false stories surrounding Stanley's fabled life and career (several of which were perpetrated by Stanley herself) as he gets inside the head of the talented but troubled and difficult icon. As famous for her stage roles (Millie Owens in Picnic or Cherie the failed singer in Bus Stop) and film work (The Right Stuff and Frances) as for her affairs and heavy drinking, Stanley, an Actors Studio member and Method disciple, was often compared to fellow Methodist Marlon Brando and had an equally tumultuous off-screen life. Krampner lays out the facts but stops short of passing judgment on the mother of three who was married four times before turning 40, concluding, \"\"Kim's story is either the tragic tale of someone who failed to tame her demons or the exasperating story of someone who indulged them and expected others to pay the freight.\"\" This well-researched account of a scandalous icon will find a welcome audience among the actress's fans; refreshingly not the stuff of tabloids. 45 b&w photos.\n\nclose\n\nDetails\n\nReviewed on: 05/29/2006\n\nGenre: Nonfiction\n\nAmazon\n\nApple Books\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nBookshop\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nCopy Link\n\nPrint\n\nMore By and About this Authorchevron_right\n\nJon Krampner\n\nCoe will be familiar to students of TV's early years: he produced NBC's Philco-Goodyear Playhouse for several years in the 1950s, produced Mary Martin's Peter Pan as well as producing the Broadway Continue reading »\n\nPW EDITORS’ PICKS FOR\n\nTHE BEST NEW BOOKS\n\nPW EDITORS’ PICKS FOR THE BEST NEW BOOKS"
