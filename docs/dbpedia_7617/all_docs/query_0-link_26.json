        "text": "Ernst Lubitsch, Ernest Vajda and Samuel Raphaelson form a plenty smart trio working behind a camera. Any script or treatment springing from this source is bound to hold many things that are good and very few that are not.\n\nThe film’s real weakness is not theirs. The drought is in the disappointing Oscar Straus score of four numbers.\n\nIts story is a pert yarn of free morals and makes no attempt to be otherwise. Maurice Chevalier steals Claudette Colbert, a violinist, from Charles Ruggles. She moves in and stays until the officer becomes circumstantially embroiled with Miriam Hopkins as the unsophisticated and plain but willing princess whom he has to marry. Thereafter it’s something of a contest to lure the lieutenant into the princess’ chamber.\n\nOn performance Hopkins ranks equally with Colbert in doing the unattractive princess who sees her lieutenant and wants him at any cost. Colbert also plays well but lacks the opportunity to make the foremost impression. Neither of the girls seems happy when singing.\n\nNo question as to George Barbier’s valiant assistance as the king. He makes everything count and handles many a laugh on his own.\n\n1931/32: Nomination: Best Picture"
