        "text": "I am a sucker for comedies that seem to have the type of humor of wanting to hide that they’re comedies. The Smiling Lieutenant story and elements have a lot of typical romance-drama beats, though constructs them in a somewhat unique and unexpected way. Plenty of characters also have lines or little moments to be funny where you wouldn’t expect them. “I here with pronounce this royal bedchamber… a royal bedchamber.” Another is, “You know what you are? You are anti-Flausenthurm. You wouldn’t like this schnitzel even if it was good.” And one more, Niki responds to a knock on the door with, “I’m not at home.” Maurice Chevalier as the lead, Niki, and Claudette Colbert as Franzi are light and buoyant performances that are pleasant so as to greet you into the story. The “simplicity” to their characters makes them hard to hate and also to have a strong connection to them. Miriam Hopkins as Anne seems to want to give a little more to her character than meets the eye. While Niki and Franzi are normal people dropped in this story, Hopkins adds little bits of characterization to her to make her feel a little more layered. Take her being prone to crying and her wardrobe-change sequence at the end. One of her great lines is, “It’s a deliberate insult, Papa. They’re trying to make us feel, just because we’re a little country… we shouldn’t have so many letters.”\n\nThe tone is set well with the slow and quiet opening broken by a lively song that breaks the fourth wall. Niki seems likable for telling his friend that cheating on his wife is a bad idea, but then quickly changes his mind and seems happy to get involved in this. Niki mostly has this energy to him, like he’s willing to find joy in anything and specifically sing. Him and Franzi are both great singers, with a song about breakfast being particularly fun. The most enjoyable scene of the movie is simply Franzi and Anne just goofing around, with Anne getting her hair messy from dancing and them singing a song together. It doesn’t tonally fit very well, with that amount of electricity lacking from the rest, but it’s nice as is. Such an “electric scene in a tamer picture” is best done to punctuate a climactic moment, not just any ol’ incidental scene. Some of the concepts and ideas portrayed are not executed well and thus this isn’t a very satisfying film to watch. The reasons why will be covered in spoilers. For now I’ll leave non-spoilers by mentioning that there’s a shot where Maurice’s head is cut off due to him being so tall.\n\nSPOILERS\n\nFranzi shows disinterest in talking to Niki and his friend, yet Niki persists and quickly wins her over. Seeing as Niki and Franzi quickly fall in love, it’s amusing to think he wanted to take her from his friend and that’s why he went with him, though that isn’t very likely due to how subtly that would be portrayed if present. Sadly, the friend is now absent from the movie. Niki and Franzi don’t get much reason to love each other, though there is a nice scene of Franzi saying she won’t meet him for breakfast, only to next scene be with him at that time. The inciting incident is when Niki smiles and winks at Franzi as the royal Anne goes by. She takes that as an insult against her. Fortunately, Franzi never appears to feel like she owes Niki something for inadvertently getting him in trouble\n\nAnne gives a comedic cry at the end of, “No. I’m sorry, Father, but I don’t. This humiliation is too much. I know a princess can’t be insulted by a common lieutenant. I should be far above that, but besides being a princess… I’m a girl.” That line is so hard to take seriously that it’s relieving that Hopkins said it a little silly, as if she knows and is telling the audience it shouldn’t be taken straight. Later, she bursts into tears upon seeing Niki. Niki pretty cleverly gets everyone on his side by picking sweet and flowery language and things to say. He’s asked how to spell “Flausenthurm”, where Anne hails from. We get bit characters to say, “What a speller.” and “He certainly knows his alphabet.” Anne responding with a throat clearing suggests she’s trying to be the center of attention. Anne’s father, Adolf, shows Niki a dollar with his face on it and Niki pockets it when no one is looking. This doesn’t make sense as he’s trying to look good for them, but it’s still amusing. He also doesn’t appear to be hurting for money.\n\nNiki wins over Anne and tells her about winking, which she is unfamiliar with. There’s a great moment of Anne giving a wink like she’s never done it before. Anne predictably falls in love with Niki here. Possibly the reason Anne likes Niki is that she’s had to be reclusive and in a situation where she has to act proper and like royalty. Someone who apparently did something “dangerous” by winking at her because of her own beauty could make him attractive to her as he’s being a little taboo. That of course doesn’t make for a healthy relationship, but such is the way of people in these situations. This would be a fine story element if Anne is ultimately painted as wrong, but it seems her love isn’t portrayed as problematic based on the ending.\n\n“If you don’t let me have my lieutenant… you know what I’m going to do?” “What?” “I’m going to marry an American.” If Adolf cares, he could just shoot down the eventual marriage to an American, like he’s doing here. However, that convinces him and he is from here firmly in favor of the marriage. Later, Niki says, “I’m a Viennese, and I love this city. I can’t live without Vienna. You can’t tear a tree out of the ground and plant it somewhere else.” Adolf replies, “Tree, tree, tree! This has nothing to do with biology!” One of the best lines in the film.\n\nConvoluted marriage rules in movies have consistently resulted in people having to start or end relationships they don’t want for a social benefit. Adolf could get Niki in serious trouble for his smile and wink. Either he deserves to be punished or he doesn’t. If not, let him be and if so, punish him. Anne and Adolf not wanting him punished suggests they don’t really care about the rude gesture, but want to protect their status or some social understanding of royalty being able to have what they want. It’s so ridiculous Niki’s in a situation where either his life could be ruined by a man or he’ll be that royal man’s son-in-law. It’s strange to start Adolf with not liking the marriage and then quickly trying to keep him in the family. He takes joy at being called “Daddy” and wants Niki to eat and like his breakfast as an example. While this is truthfully poor characterization, you can look at this as him so wanting to avoid a divorce or the marriage even appearing unhappy that he will go through dealing with and accepting Niki. The real solution here is to let Niki live his life and not be married to Anne, yet no one can just do that. Also, we sadly don’t get a scene where Niki suddenly feels the weight on his shoulders of having to marry Anne. He simply goes from protesting to accepting and it feels jolty. The reason isn’t hard to realize and maybe that was in Niki’s mind, but as storytelling it’s a weak moment.\n\nThe movie was surprisingly explicit about Anne wanting to have sex with Niki. Niki refuses and avoids her. You can’t really judge Niki for constantly wanting to be away from his wife and father-in-law because they’re literally forcing him in their family. Any moments of Anne and Adolf trying to appear likable feel hollow as they’re doing something horrible. Niki continues to see Franzi, having her taken from her performances on violin to be with him. It’s strangely selfish and out of character for him to interrupt her show instead of meeting her before or after. Niki seemed slightly interested in Anne playing the piano, only to move along from it. In my notes I said, “I was worried that after Anne played the piano, Niki would actually fall in love with her, but fortunately he didn’t.” Anne and Franzi meet. Franzi teaches Anne to loosen up and Anne apparently portrays herself as charming, based on how Franzi describes her later. There’s one silly moment of the two crying in bed over Niki. It’s expected, but seems to demonstrate the sort of attitude black and white movies sometimes have about women. They’re interrupting their talking by crying over a man. Good luck taking that scene seriously. Hopefully it was intentionally goofy.\n\nThe ending is something. It seems the message of this film is that if you love someone who doesn’t love you back, force them to love you. Based on how warm Franzi and Niki were throughout the film, you’d think the ending would consist of Anne realizing the error of her ways and Franzi and Niki being together again. However, everybody at the end is happy because they just learned to accept what Anne wanted. That’s a disturbing moral and also raises the question, “Why include Franzi?” This could’ve been about Niki making a gesture at Anne because of a misunderstanding, then he struggles to accept being married to her because he prefers being single or a bachelor, then the end is the same with Niki learning to love Anne. Of course the reason he does is pretty pathetic, with Anne just acting looser and less like she’s an obligation. This could’ve worked a little better if the friend that loved Franzi at the beginning was shown to ultimately get her, but alas. Those scenes with Niki and Franzi loving each other now feel completely unnecessary. Admittedly, Franzi and Niki fall in love over nothing, but it’s the same way tons and tons of couples fall in love in these movies. Franzi “meaning nothing to the story” could’ve been fixed by giving her some sort of point to her and her scenes. She does get Anne to act differently, but that could’ve been done in other ways.\n\nIt’s a little interesting to have the idea of “start a romance (with Franzi), then it’s stopped suddenly and we get a new one (with Anne)”, but it fails due to the pointlessness of Franzi. Films like The Philadelphia Story avoid this problem by still having things for those red herring characters to serve. It is funny that the act that signified Niki and Anne finally finding unity with each other is them having sex. Shame we didn’t get a moment of Niki contemplating or realizing that he’s now in love with Anne or at least wants to sleep with her. He simply is now different.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nApparently the ending is a “Lubitsch Touch”. Director and co-screenwriter Ernst Lubitsch loves to add unexpected jokes. Thus, the ending is uncomfortable on purpose. It’s the opposite of what you’d expect. That concept might work better in a through and through screwball comedy, but here this film commits quite a bit to being a romance-drama, with its comedic flarings. The appeal to not concluding in an expected way is obvious, but the ending we get is like saying, “Well you didn’t expect me to fire a gun next to your ear? Did you?” Unexpected doesn’t mean cathartic.\n\nON THE CORNER AND OFF THE WALL\n\nTo those who know me, yes, I did watch this movie just for the perceived lesbian subtext in the scene of Miriam Hopkins and Claudette Colbert. Now that I’ve seen it, even I will say that such an interpretation is a stretch at best."
