        "text": "Sadly, the name Ernst Lubitsch isn’t one that’s batted around much by the hip young gunslingers of the movie world. Given that he passed away in the 1940s, there are many whose grandparents were barely out of short trousers the last time a Lubitsch picture was in theaters, and only a few filmmakers (Wes Anderson the most recent) mention him as a touchstone these days. But we’re firmly of the belief that cinema would be much improved if every screenwriter and director sat down for a weekend with the films of the much-missed director.\n\nLubitsch, born in Berlin in 1892 to Jewish parents, started off life as an actor before becoming a director in the Weimar era, quickly establishing himself as a promising filmmaker while still only in his 20s with melodramas like “The Eyes of the Mummy” and “Anna Boleyn.” In 1922, the director left for Hollywood to work for Mary Pickford and found success with a series of silent films, and eventually, musicals and talkies. Over the next twenty-odd years, he knocked out a string of outstanding comedies, each one displaying the famous, slightly intangible “Lubitsch touch” (Billy Wilder has a good explanation here), even running Paramount for a year in 1935, and picking up a Special Academy Award in March 1947.\n\nBefore the year was out, sadly, Lubitsch had passed away, dying from his sixth heart attack, 65 years ago today on November 30th, 1947. At the funeral, Billy Wilder (a protégé of the older director, who worked on him on films like “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife,” and “Ninotchka“) remarked sadly to another great director, William Wyler, “No more Lubitsch,” to which Wyler replied, mournfully, “Worse than that. No more Lubitsch pictures.” And while his influence lives on (Wilder hung a sign on his desk saying “How would Lubitsch do it?” for the rest of his life), it’s hard not to feel that sadness still today. To mark the anniversary of the director’s passing, we’ve picked out five of our favorites, which will serve as a good introduction to any of you unfamiliar with the director’s work. And there’s plenty more where that came from; feel free to add other recommendations in the comments section below."
