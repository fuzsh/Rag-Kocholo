        "text": "Hillel Slovak (Hebrew: הלל סלובק‎) was an Israel-born American musician best known as the original guitarist and founding member of the Los Angeles rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. Prior to his death of a heroin overdose in 1988, Slovak recorded one demo and two albums with the band, Freaky Styley (1985) and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). His guitar work was primarily rooted in funk and hard rock, although he often experimented with other genres including reggae and speed metal. He is considered to have been a major influence on the Red Hot Chili Peppers' early sound.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nBorn in Haifa, Israel, Slovak immigrated with his family to the United States in 1967 when he was five years old. Slovak met future bandmates Anthony Kiedis, Flea, and Jack Irons while attending high school in Los Angeles.\n\nWhat Is This and Red Hot Chili Peppers[]\n\nHe joined the group Anthym along with Irons while attending Fairfax High School; Flea would later join the group, though he quit to join the band Fear. Anthym later changed its name to What is This.\n\nSlovak, Flea, Kiedis, and Irons started Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1982, when Slovak and Irons were still members of What Is This.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers became popular in the Los Angeles area, playing various shows around the city. However, Slovak and Irons quit the band to focus on What is This, which had gotten a record deal, leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers to record their debut album without them. Slovak quit What Is This and rejoined the Chili Peppers in 1985, and recorded the albums Freaky Styley and The Uplift Mofo Party Plan with the band.\n\nDeath[]\n\nDuring his career, Slovak developed a serious heroin addiction. He attempted to quit the drug many times, but ultimately succumbed to his addiction, dying of an overdose on June 25, 1988 at age 26.\n\nHe was replaced by guitarist DeWayne McKnight, who was soon replaced by John Frusciante.\n\nSeveral Red Hot Chili Peppers songs have been written as tributes to Slovak, including \"Knock Me Down\", \"My Lovely Man\" and most recently \"Feasting on the Flowers\". In 1999, his brother James Slovak published a book entitled Behind the Sun: The Diary and Art of Hillel Slovak, which features Slovak's diaries and paintings. Slovak was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on April 14, 2012, with his brother accepting on his behalf.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nWith What Is This[]\n\nSqueezed (1984)\n\nWhat Is This (1985)\n\n3 Out of 5 Live (1985)\n\nWith Red Hot Chili Peppers[]\n\nDemos[]\n\n1983 Demo (1983)\n\nThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan Demos\n\nStudio Albums[]\n\nFreaky Styley (1985)\n\nThe Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987)\n\nMother's Milk (\"Fire\" only) (1989)\n\nGuest Appearances[]\n\nKeith Levene - Violent Opposition (1989)\n\nVideography[]\n\nWith Red Hot Chili Peppers[]\n\nRed Hot Skate Rock (1988)\n\nTourography[]\n\nWith Red Hot Chili Peppers[]\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers 1983 Tour\n\nPhoto Gallery[]\n\nSee Also[]\n\nHillel Slovak on the What Is This Wiki"
