        "text": "Red Hot Chili Peppers bring their hot spice to the Toyota Amphitheatre in Wheatland, CA, on June 2, 2024\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers extended their Unlimited Love Tour, which started in 2022, in a massive run across the country, and the band shows no signs of slowing down. As a result of the two album releases last year going to #1, RHCP notably stands out as the first rock band in 17 years to achieve this feat. Return of the Dream held strong at #1 on the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart, just like its predecessor Unlimited Love did in April 2022. Both albums were produced by longtime collaborator and creative confidant Rick Rubin. They also reached #1 in numerous countries around the world.\n\nLast year, RHCP were awarded the prestigious Global Icon Award and delivered a show-stopping performance at the MTV VMAs. Their No. 1 single “Black Summer” also won the Best Rock Video award. In addition, the band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2022.\n\nWithout a doubt, RHCP—Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), Chad Smith (drums), and John Frusciante (guitar)—have created some of the most incredible blends of funk, alternative, rap, and hard rock ever.\n\nThere was a bit of a traffic jam getting to the venue as the show was sold out, and there was only one lane in and one lane out in the outskirts of Sacramento, out in the farmland. The weather was thankfully perfect at 85 degrees, with a cool wind and some slight cloud cover, because it can get brutally hot out there, where the air is dusty and dry.\n\nI’m not even going to mention the opening act, as it was a complete disaster, and I’m still scratching my head as to how this individual even got the spot to open up for one of the most successful and incredible bands of all time.\n\nWhen the lights came down for RHCP, Flea came out stage left and walked a handstand all the way across the stage to his position on stage right. He is one of a kind across the board. It’s unbelievable how fit this man is. Smith and Frusciante strolled out, and the band segued into an intro jam. The fans were on their feet with thunderous cheers and phones in the air. Yes, we were about to see one of the greatest bands of all time! After a three-minute warm-up jam, the band rolled into “Dani California” off their Stadium Arcadium album released in 2006. Kiedis hopped out with a medical boot on his left foot and a knee brace on his right leg. Apparently, he has been giving it his all on tour. He was sporting a purple see-through knit shirt and white 3/4 length shorts with a studded outline of a Playboy bunny on his left pant leg. Flea was also sporting purple socks and a yellow kilt. They were clearly wearing LA Lakers colors, as they are huge fans of their hometown basketball team. Chad was wearing his Dodger blue ball cap, a blue shirt, and his kick drum sported the LA Dodgers emblem. Frusciante was casual in his attire.\n\nKiedis was a bit off on the vocals, missed a couple of cues, and seemed to be struggling a bit at first. I can only imagine how hard it is to be 100% with two injuries. He adjusted and slipped into a rhythm by the third song, “Scar Tissue,” off their 1999 album Californication. Flea is aptly nicknamed, as he hops around and often takes flight across the stage, all the while holding down his bass lines. Smith and Flea are so in sync on the low end; it’s truly powerful watching them play together. Frusciante is the quiet maestro, noodling his guitar like a meticulous surgeon. RHCP thrilled the fans with an array of songs spanning their 13-album discography, with 18 songs in total for the evening, which is clearly just the tip of the iceberg. Some of their most popular hits played were “Universally Speaking,” “Right on Time,” “Tippa My Tongue,” “By the Way,” and ending the night with their two-song encore, “Give it Away.”\n\nThroughout the set, Kiedis was hopscotching about, kicking his leg up and pumping up the fans. Smith appears to be the father duck of the band, watching every move, hoping Kiedis didn’t reinjure himself.\n\nEveryone seemed happy and fulfilled with RHCP’s performance. The band will continue on with their U.S. tour, ending on July 30th in St. Louis, Missouri."
