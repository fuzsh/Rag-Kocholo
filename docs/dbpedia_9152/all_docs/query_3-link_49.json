But 40 years since the release of their self-titled debut album, Red Hot Chili Peppers are evolving, producing new music and still thriving on the road. Known out of the gate for a unique blend of funk, metal and rock delivered through wild, clothing-optional stage shows, the Chilis have become six-time Grammy winners and a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Whether you know them from their silver-painted selves in the 1991 video for “Give It Away” or their recent hit “Black Summer,” the Chilis have been cool for ages. Learn more about the band’s origins and journey to their current tour in The Unofficial Story: Red Hot Chili Peppers, filled with fantastic photos."
