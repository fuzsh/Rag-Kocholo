        "text": "Acclaimed rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers today announced a show at Hersheypark Stadium on Wednesday, September 27, 2023, at 6:30 p.m. This concert marks the band’s first appearance in Hershey, Pa., since July 17, 2000.\n\nTickets are available at www.Ticketmaster.com and www.HersheyEntertainment.com.\n\nThis exclusive Hersheypark Stadium show is part of the Red Hot Chili Peppers 2023 Global Stadium Tour in support of their two No. 1 studio albums released in 2022, “Unlimited Love” and “Return of the Dream Canteen.”\n\nAs a result of the two album releases this year going No. 1, Red Hot Chili Peppers notably stand out as the first rock band in 17 years to achieve the feat. Moreover, “Return of the Dream Canteen” bowed at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart — just like its predecessor, “Unlimited Love,” did back in April. Both albums were produced by longtime collaborator and creative confidant Rick Rubin.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers recently took home the prestigious Global Icon Award and delivered a show-stopping performance at the MTV VMAs. Their No. 1 single, “Black Summer,'' also won the award for Best Rock Video. This year, the band also garnered an MTV Europe Music Award nomination for Best Rock and scored three American Music Awards nominations for Favorite Rock Artist, Favorite Rock Album for “Unlimited Love,” and Favorite Rock Single for \"Black Summer.\" Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Black Summer\" was nominated for a 2023 GRAMMY Award for Best Rock Song.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.HersheyEntertainment.com or www.RedHotChiliPeppers.com."
