        "text": "Red Hot Chili Peppers stopped by SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, CA on Sunday for a sold-out hometown show that also featured sets by Beck and Thundercat. The concert was part of the Chili Peppers’ ongoing tour in support of their recent release Unlimited Love.\n\nVirtuosic goofball bassist Thundercat kicked things off with a four-song set of flamboyant funk fusion. Opening with “Lost in Space / Great Scott / 22-26” off 2020’s It Is What It Is, he played fan favorite “Dragonball Durag” and “Funny Thing” from the same album before capping the set with his biggest hit, “Them Changes”.\n\nBeck’s set was more extensive, with 14 songs beginning with “Devil’s Haircut”, one of his biggest hits off of 1996’s Odelay. Following “Up All Night / Black Tambourine” and “Wow”, both from 2017’s Colors, Beck returned to his earlier work with “Qué onda güero / Nicotine & Gravy”, from the 1999 album Midnite Vultures. Next came “Girl”, “Mixed Business”, and “Go It Alone”, after which he offered another cut from Midnite Vultures, “Debra”, and “Dreams” from Colors.\n\nBeck then treated the audience to two of his most popular songs, “The New Pollution” and “Loser”, with a cover of Gorillaz‘s “The Valley of the Pagans” in the middle. He wrapped the set with “E-Pro” and “Where It’s At” before ceding the stage to the night’s headliners.\n\nRelated: Gorillaz & Thundercat Collaborate On New Single, “Cracker Island” [Listen]\n\nThe Chili Peppers opened their set with an “Intro Jam” followed by a few crowd favorites including “Can’t Stop”, “Dani California”, and “Scar Tissue”, which was preceded by a tease of “Fopp” by Ohio Players. They then worked in “Here Ever After”, the first song of the night from the band’s newest release, Unlimited Love. Returning to the hits, the band played “Snow ((Hey Oh))” next, followed by “Charlie”, both off of 2016’s Stadium Arcadium.\n\nRHCP then offered another selection from the new album, “These Are the Ways”, before taking it back to 2002’s By the Way with “Throw Away Your Television”. After a run through “Hard to Concentrate”, the band played a tease of “London Calling” by The Clash en route to “Right on Time”. “Otherside” then led to “Black Summer”, another off Unlimited Love, by way of “The Heavy Wing”. The band wrapped the set with “Californiacation” followed by a jam of “What Is Soul?” by Funkadelic and fan favorite “Give It Away”.\n\nAfter a brief encore break, they returned to the stage to offer a two-song, crowd-pleasing encore featuring “Under the Bridge” from 1991’s Blood Sugar Sex Magik and “By the Way”, the title track from the band’s 2002 album.\n\nClick below to view fan-shot videos from Red Hot Chili Peppers with Beck and Thundercat at SoFi Stadium and scroll down for galleries of photos courtesy of photographer Kevin Mazur.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers’ Unlimited Love Tour will continue Wednesday, August 3rd at T-Mobile Park in Seattle, WA, where they will be joined by The Strokes and Thundercat.
