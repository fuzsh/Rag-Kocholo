        "text": "Red Hot Chili Peppers launched their 2024 Unlimited Love North American tour on Tuesday night in Ridgefield, Washington.\n\nThe band played several of their best-known hits — \"Scar Tissue,\" \"Californication,\" \"By the Way\" and others — as well as song selections from more recent albums, like \"Whatchu Thinkin,'\" \"Black Summer\" and \"Eddie.\" A cover of Funkadelic's \"What Is Soul?\" was also included.\n\nYou can view fan-filmed footage from the show, plus a complete set list, below.\n\nWhere Are Red Hot Chili Peppers Heading Next?\n\nTuesday night's concert marked RHCP's seventh show of 2024, but they have a busy couple months ahead. Their next performance is scheduled for May 31 at the Gorge Ampitheatre, also located in Washington state.\n\nFrom there, they'll travel down to their home state of California and then head westward for shows in Florida, Ohio, Ontario and more, concluding the tour on July 30 in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nThe title of this year's tour comes from the first of RHCP's two 2022 albums, Unlimited Love, which was followed by Return of the Dream Canteen. Both were produced by Rick Rubin.\n\n\"When all was said and done, our moody love for each other and the magic of music had gifted us with more songs than we knew what to do with,\" the band said in a statement at the time. \"Well we figured it out. Two double albums released back to back. The second of which is easily as meaningful as the first or should that be reversed.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Why Red Hot Chili Peppers Struggled So Mightily With 'By the Way'\n\nWatch Red Hot Chili Peppers Perform 'Californication'\n\nWatch Red Hot Chili Peppers Perform 'What Is Soul?'\n\nWatch Red Hot Chili Peppers Perform 'Give It Away'"
