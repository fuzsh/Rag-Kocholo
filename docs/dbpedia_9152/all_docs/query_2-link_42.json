        "text": "If it's true that the city of Portland has been overrun with California transplants, Wednesday night's Red Hot Chili Peppers appearance was a few tube-socks away from being a hometown show. There was one fan in the Moda Center's front row with a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball cap; Flea himself felt comfortable enough to blaspheme the Trail Blazers' arena with a purple-and-gold Lakers signature bass. I didn't see anyone complaining. (I did see a lot of people passing vape pens.)\n\nBut the show, a stop on the long-running rock band's The Getaway World Tour, wasn't just for California pride--a killer rendition of \"Californication\" aside. Here's what we learned from the alternative rock band's blistering set.\n\n1. They connect generations. One dad in the front row paid for his bassist son and his six (!) band mates to come out to the show.\n\n2. Sensitivity is almost always an artist's best look: \"Under the Bridge,\" which drew an arena-sized sing-along, has aged much better than \"Beavis and Butthead\" anthems \"Suck My Kiss\" and \"Give It Away,\" which the band rolled out with a video of animated breasts and butts. Leave it in the '90s, bros.\n\n3. They keep their clothes on now. Mostly. Somewhere in the few minutes it took for me to drop off my camera after the first three songs, singer Anthony Kiedis lost his shirt.\n\n4. The band's chemistry is still palpable, from their opening three-man jam to the pleasure radiating from newcomer guitarist Josh Klinghoffer: the 37-year-old's delivery of songs such as \"Californication,\" a track he probably jammed in his college dorm, was like watching someone living the dream. He was so into the set he slipped during one song: \"That was my first fall on stage,\" he announced after. \"I missed it!\" Kiedis told him.\n\n5. Accidents aside, they stay in shape. Drummer Chad Smith pounded away like John Bonham. Flea did a handstand and walked himself halfway across the stage. Kiedis, shirtless and glistening, looked halfway between Iggy Pop and \"Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation\"-era Tom Cruise.\n\n6. The band keeps the set fresh. Most arena acts play the same songs night after night, but Red Hot Chili Peppers threw out the setlist, playing a handful of hits--\"Can't Stop,\" \"Dani California,\" \"The Zephyr Song\"--they traded in for songs that made the cut in Oakland in Sunday such as \"Scar Tissue\" and \"Aeroplane,\" alongside keyboard-driven new material from \"The Getaway.\"\n\n7. The quartet's formidable playing would've been enough for the night, but they brought production, too: an array of cylindrical lights that went up and down on strings over the crowd, arranging themselves into blinking levels or a hypnotic, lava-red spinning disc.\n\n8. Flea waited until the end to slip out his Lakers bass, his playing so mighty and chest-punching that even the home of the Trail Blazers had to respect it. \"I'll allow it. Just for tonight,\" the Moda Center tweeted."
