        "text": "Red Hot Chili Peppers, American rock band that combined funk and punk rock to create a new musical style in the 1980s.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nRock Music and Rock ’n’ Roll\n\nHeavily influenced by the Los Angeles punk music scene in the late 1970s, school friends vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak, and drummer Jack Irons formed Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The group performed along the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles during the early 1980s, wearing only strategically placed tube socks, which, as a stage gimmick, became their trademark. By 1983, under the name Red Hot Chili Peppers, they had a loyal underground following and a recording contract with EMI. Their first album to reach the Billboard 200 chart was The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987).\n\nJust as the band was beginning to enjoy commercial success, Slovak died of a heroin overdose and Irons left the band, leaving Kiedis and Flea to re-form with John Frusciante on guitar and Chad Smith on drums. Their 1989 album, Mother’s Milk, became a surprise hit. The album went gold by early 1990 and was followed by the more successful Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), which includes the band’s first top 10 single, “Under the Bridge,” as well as the Grammy Award-winning “Give It Away.”\n\nThrough a number of lineup changes, the Red Hot Chili Peppers continued to release well-received albums, including Californication (1999), By the Way (2002), and Grammy-winning Stadium Arcadium (2006). The band went on hiatus in early 2008, and the following year Frusciante announced that he had left the group to pursue a solo career. He was replaced on lead guitar by Josh Klinghoffer, who had previously played with the group on the Stadium Arcadium tour. Putting aside various side projects, the band returned to the studio and released I’m with You in 2011. The band exchanged longtime producer Rick Rubin for Danger Mouse (Brian Burton) for the group’s 11th studio album, The Getaway (2016). Its lead single, “Dark Necessities,” topped Billboard’s alternative, adult alternative, and mainstream rock music charts, the fourth song in history to do so.\n\nIn 2019 Frusciante returned to the band, and Klinghoffer was dismissed. Three years later the group released two albums, Unlimited Love (produced by Rubin) and Return of the Dream Canteen."
