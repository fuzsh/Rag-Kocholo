        "text": "Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Michael “Flea” Balzary has relisted his striking-looking compound in La Crescenta, an unincorporated area just beyond Los Angeles.\n\nThe alternative rock icon, 61, is seeking $6.99 million for the hilltop estate, significantly less than the $9.8 million he asked when he first listed it back early 2022, according to Robb Report.\n\nDespite the price reduction, the asking price is still much higher than the $4.3 million Flea paid the contemporary artists Lari Pittman and Roy Dowell for the compound back in 2018.\n\nSince purchasing the property, Flea has made a number of additions to its 5.7 acres, including a stand-alone cabin, a 50-foot Johnston Vidal lap pool and an 875-square-foot extension to the main house — a seven-sided-structure with an interior courtyard.\n\nAlso at the address is its original structure, a 1,350-square-foot two-bedroom, one-bathroom house built by legendary modernist architect Richard Neutra for his secretary, Dorothy Serulnic, in 1953 — as well as an outdoor movie pavilion with a wind screen and a catering kitchen.\n\nThe abode features walls of glass, a stone fireplace, and “a plethora of Neutra designed built-ins, including a sofa system with record player and concealed speakers,” according to the listing, which is held by Branden Williams and Rayni Williams of The Beverly Hills Estates, and Sherri Rogers and Anthony Stellini of Compass.\n\nThe heptagon-shaped primary residence was built some 50 years later by the architect Michael Maltzan.\n\nLocated at the end of a winding driveway, it features a primary bedroom with a penny-tiled, oval skylight-equipped ensuite bathroom; a covered balcony overlooking the valley below; and a galley kitchen sandwiched between the library and dining room, according to a profile in Architectural Record.\n\n“Built on a concrete slab with hidden steel columns and laminated-wood beams, the new, 2,500-square-foot house cost $1.5 million,” the profile added.\n\n“The property is literally your own midcentury space station right here in Los Angeles,” listing agent Branden Williams told Robb Report."
