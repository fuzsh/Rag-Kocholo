        "text": "Anthony Kiedis’ Grand Rapids roots are long and deep.\n\nAlthough the Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman hasn't lived here permanently since he was a 'tween, he still visits the area frequently to see his mother and other relatives. In anticipation of Kiedis' fourth RHCP/Van Andel Arena homecoming, here's a history of the rock star's ties to his hometown:\n\nNov. 1, 1962: Kiedis is born in Grand Rapids at St. Mary's Hospital to parents John Kiedis – a.k.a. Blackie Dammett – and Peggy Noble Idema. He attended Brookside Elementary School. Idema still lives in the area; Dammett lived in Rockford for many years, but recently moved out of the area.\n\n1974: Following his parents' divorce, Kiedis, 11, moves to Los Angeles with Dammett. He often returns to West Michigan to visit his mother and other family members, sometimes towing along his buddy Michael Balzary, who would later be known best as Flea.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Van Andel Arena\n\nTickets: Although previously announced as sold out, a few tickets have been made available; $38-$58 via Ticketmaster or at the Van Andel and DeVos Place box offices\n\nInfo.: vanandelarena.com, 742-6600\n\nAlso: RHCP will be performing at 8 p.m. June 1 at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit; tickets are still available, $42.50-$62.50 via Ticketmaster\n\n1983: Inspired by funk, rap and punk rock, Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons form a band: Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. They would eventually, and wisely, change their name to Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band gains notoriety by playing shows nude, save for one strategically placed sock on their nether-regions.\n\nNov. 4, 1984: Newly signed to label EMI and touring for debut album \"The Red Hot Chili Peppers,\" Kiedis and co. play at now-defunct Grand Rapids club Top of the Rock. They play a rowdy set, and at its conclusion, Flea drops his pants on stage. Notably, he's not wearing his sock. It's a moment that will live in local infamy. \"I thought we had an agreement that they wouldn't do the California thing,\" Alan Bashara, who promoted the show, told The Grand Rapids Press years later. \"But they were cool -- from the first note they played, I knew they were going to be huge. I couldn't believe the energy that came off the stage in that little club.\"\n\n1991-92: The band breaks through to mainstream audiences with the \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" album. The closest it plays to Grand Rapids is a headlining show in late '91 at Kalamazoo's State Theatre, with a couple of opening acts you may have heard of: Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam. Less than a year later, the Peppers were headlining the second annual Lollapalooza tour, which came to Pine Knob (now known as DTE Energy Music Theater) in Clarkston, near Detroit.\n\nJune, 1999: An episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music\" profiling the band reveals the storied history of Kiedis and his father, who encouraged his son's drug use and sexual activity. \"I was part of the hippie thing, where you think drugs are good for you, \" Dammett told The Press at the time. \"It was just normal, and it didn't seem like a bad thing to do around him. As for sex -- it was the same thing. In retrospect, of course, it's terrible.\"\n\nRelated links\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction: the ultimate retrospective playlist\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers release covers EP to celebrate Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction\n\nRHCP will be selling professional recordings of all the dates on its current U.S. tour, including its May 26 Grand Rapids date\n\nMarch, 2000: The Chili Peppers announce their first Grand Rapids date in 16 years, headlining at Van Andel Arena.\n\nLate June, 2000: I trek to St. Louis to meet and interview Kiedis prior to a Chili Peppers show at Riverport Amphitheater. His photo is among many lining the backstage area depicting major rock stars who have played the venue. He said many, many family members were going to attend the G.R. show, including his 90-odd-year-old aunt. Of returning to G.R. for the band's first gig since 1984, he said, \"It's a combination of excitement, trepidation and knowing that, on a good day, I can handle anything -- any kind of distraction, any kind of extracurricular duty, any kind of extra love I have to give up to friends and family, \" he said. \"I think we're at our best right now, and we're kind of connecting with and contributing to some positive energy in the air. It makes me happy to take that kind of a feeling and share it with my hometown.\" Looking back on the controversial 1984 Chili Peppers show at Top of the Rock, he told me they, essentially, were dumb kids who thought they were hotshots and, he said with a twinkle in his eye, \"had really cool haircuts.\"\n\nJuly 5, 2000: The Chili Peppers play their first G.R. gig in 16 years, at a sold-out Van Andel Arena. For the occasion, Kiedis, Flea and guitarist John Frusciante wear freshly shorn mohawks. Between songs, Flea talks about visiting West Michigan with Kiedis as youngsters, and how they used to climb on a railroad trellis and jump off of it. Everyone's pants stay on.\n\nMay 10 2003: Another homecoming show for Kiedis, another sold-out Van Andel Arena. \"I have nephews, grandfathers, aunts and uncles, cousins, brothers and sisters here tonight,\" the frontman said between songs. Of the show, I wrote, \"The band didn't pander to nostalgia. Could they have played more hits? Sure, but it's more daring to present newer material to an arena full of people and make the music effective and vibrant. For the most part, the Peppers successfully met this challenge.\"\n\nOct., 2004: Kiedis' autobiography, \"Scar Tissue,\" is published. In it, he talks about his life in Grand Rapids and Los Angeles, and shares explicit details about his struggles with drug addiction. He asked his mother not to read it: \"In my opinion, she's the only person in the book who comes out smelling like a rose,\" he told me in an interview. \"The idea of having to relive a tormented labyrinth of experiences that her son had to go through -- it just didn't seem purposeful to me.\" He also said his father could gain some perspective by reading it: \"He might learn something about himself and have a chance to take responsibility for some of his bizarre and not always mentally healthy behavior. I never, in the book, blame him for any of my problems, because that's bull.\" Kiedis reveals in the book that he spent time in a Grand Rapids-area rehab center in 2000 while visiting family for Christmas.\n\nOct., 2006: Kiedis explains the genesis of the song \"Especially in Michigan\" (from the album \"Stadium Arcadium\") to The Press: \"I have a connection to Michigan. There is something kind of off-the-beaten path and magical about the magic and the medicine that are Michigan. If you get out in the woods and out in those lakes and rivers, under those skies, there is a great sense of strength and wonder,\" he said. \"I'm constantly getting the sense-memory recollection of things that happened to me in my childhood in Michigan. I'll hear songs today on oldies stations that were playing on AM radio stations in the 1970s, and I'll get a flashback to when I'd be riding around in my mother's Chevrolet Impala listening to songs driving down Division or Burton or in Alger Heights.\"\n\nNov. 2, 2006: RHCP returns for a third show at Van Andel Arena. In front of a not-quite-sold-out crowd of 11,000, Kiedis asks fans if they're from Ionia, Muskegon or Sparta.\n\nFeb., 2007: After winning a pile of Grammys for \"Stadium Arcadium,\" Kiedis says in his thank-you speech, \"I love being in this band, I love these guys, I love doing what we get to do. I love my mama, thank you all.\" Idema was in the crowd.\n\nOct., 2011: \"Scar Tissue,\" long in development to become a TV series, is picked up by the FX network after HBO abandons the project. The series would focus on young Kiedis in California, living with Dammett, who for a time dealt drugs to celebrities. \"Entourage\" producers Marc Abrams and Mike Benson are tied to the project, which has no air date yet.\n\nDec., 2011: Asked if he could visit only one place in Michigan, Kiedis tells The Press, \"Mom's kitchen. An old dirt road along the shores of Lake Michigan. The smell of pine needles baking on the sandy shores of some forgotten bend in a faraway creek.\" He later adds, \"Michigan has a good reputation around the country. It definitely does in California. People may not realize just how much natural beauty the Mighty Mitten holds, but that's part of Michigan's charm. It's not an over-populated mess.\"\n\nApril, 2012: Both Dammett and Idema attend the Chili Peppers' Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame induction. In his speech, Kiedis thanks them thusly: \"I have a very wild father and a very mild mother and they both made me who I am. I'd like to thank my father for introducing me to the arts - for inspiring me to be a free thinker and to go find out myself. He's a big part of mine today. And although my mother was much more sort of mild and laid back about the whole thing, I realized years later as I watched her suit up and show up for about 40 years going to work she taught me the lessons of what it is to suit up and show up and go to work every day and the gratification that comes with it. Thank you mom and dad - I love you both.\" Unfortunately – and to the proud parents' chagrin – that portion of the speech is edited out of the truncated TV simulcast of the ceremony.\n\nThis Saturday: The Chili Peppers return to Van Andel Arena for the fourth time. Still vital and artistically viable, Kiedis and co. play on."
