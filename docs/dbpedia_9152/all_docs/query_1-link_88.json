        "text": "Part of this story\n\nWhen future historians and scientists reflect and debate and polemicize and determine which band was the essential Lollapalooza band - the band that perfectly exemplifies Lolla and captures the spirit of the music festival better than any other band - there will be only two bands to pick from, but only one correct answer.\n\nThere will surely be a few people who think the right answer is Jane's Addiction (one or two may even pick Pearl Jam). Even though Perry Farrell co-founded the festival in 1991 as a big farewell party for his band Jane's Addition, which has played more Lollapaloozas than any other band ever, the correct answer is Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nRelated\n\nBeginning with the second Lolla in 1992, RHCP have headlined the fest four times. They've been there since the early days, rocking one of the most important festival stages in history, and they have returned to do it again and again and again during pivotal moments in their evolution as a band, whose popularity has not really dropped off over the past 30 years.\n\nLike Lollapalooza, which was founded in 1991, the Chili Peppers, who were founded in 1983, are an institution. The band weathered the storms of the music industry and continued to stay relevant by constantly reinventing themselves. They've changed across the years, but they've always been a band unlike any other.\n\nLollapalooza celebrates its 25th anniversary this year and the Chili Peppers are headliners - so we took a look back at the long and storied relationship between them.\n\n1992: The Chilis pop their Lolla pepper\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers were invited to the second Lollapalooza in 1992. It was a huge year for the band. They had just released Blood Sugar Sex Magik, which many consider to be the greatest RHCP album of all time. It showed the band moving in a significantly more pop and radio-friendly direction following the goofy, hard, fun-boy funk that defined their previous four albums. There were still some super funky numbers on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but with the help of star producer Rick Rubin, they were able to craft several chart-topping, career-defining radio hits, like Under The Bridge and Give It Away.\n\nSo in '92, when RHCP stormed the stage at Lollapaloozas across the country - this was back when it was still a touring festival, before it made Chicago its permanent home - they were at the height of their game. Also it was the height of Alternative Nation, at the most alt-music festival that has ever existed and RHCP were the kings.\n\n1999: The Lolla that never was\n\nWell, everyone knows there was no Lollapalooza in 1999, but what this blurb presupposes is... maybe there was.\n\nSo Lolla took a break between 1997 and 2003, much to the dismay of the entire world. But there is no doubt about it that, if there was a Lolla '99, RHCP would've headlined it. It was the year they released Californication, arguably their second best album. The Rubin-produced masterpiece contained several hits, like Scar Tissue, Otherside and Around The World. It marked another big sea change for the Pepps, as they moved further into the pop world and proved themselves the greatest rock band of the moment. Californication radically increased their accessibility because, let's face it, it's alienating for even the coolest mom to hear Suck My Kiss while strolling the Gap, but Scar Tissue was a song everyone could get behind.\n\nLolla '99, if it had happened, would've been one for the history books. RHCP would've headlined and they've would've hit the stage armed with hits from the album that helped finally merge Alternative Nation with Adult Contemporary Nation. You can't get more hypothetically essential than this.\n\n2006: The return of the Lolla kings (aka Dani-palooza)\n\nLollapalooza returned in 2005, settling in Chicago's Grant Park. One month before the second revamped edition, RHCP dropped a massive double album, Stadium Arcadium, and it was impossible to turn on the radio or go to a convenience store without hearing Dani California, the song where Kiedis rapped a bunch of state names, and rhymed \"Mississippi\" with \"hippie\" and \"Alabama\" with \"hammer\".\n\nStadium Arcadium was a huge statement. The band were back and doing all the things they'd done on their previous eight albums, but somehow doing it all on a much bigger scale. They'd been playing stadiums for years, but now, as the outer space album art showed, the Chilis were ready to take their far-out sound even farther, to other planets and other beings.\n\nThey didn't play Mars in 2006, but they played the next best thing: Lollapalooza. They headlined alongside then-rising rapper Kanye West and were undoubtedly the biggest rock band on the bill, no offense to Wilco and Blues Traveler.\n\n2012: Rain Dance Maggie & the Pepps take the Lolla throne (once again)\n\nRHCP took some much needed time off after touring Stadium Arcadium. Along the way, they lost guitarist Frusciante, who was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer. But they got back on the horse in 2011 and dropped a new album, I'm With You, which didn't win a single Grammy but did deliver the ridiculous hit single The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie. It's a tight and clean and solid album that showed the band sounding brighter than ever; it was the first album ever digitally mastered specifically for iTunes Store purchasers, after all.\n\nSo with a new LP on the shelves, where did RHCP go? Straight to Lollapalooza. They headlined in 2012, alongside metal icons Black Sabbath and then-rising stars Florence + the Machine. They were the only act on the bill to play Lolla back in the day and they ended their set with an encore of Give It Away, which they also played during their first headlining set at the festival 20 years earlier. That's big history.\n\n2016: The Peppers getaway back to where they always belonged: Lollapalooza\n\nIt's 2016 and RHCP have recently released their 11th album, The Getaway. They've worked with Rubin since Blood Sugar Sex Magik, but this new one was produced by Danger Mouse and it's their best album since Californication. Another big moment for a band that never stops moving and keeps making magic.\n\nSo it's back to Lollapalooza for the Chili dudes, where Flea, Kiedis, Smith and Klinghoffer will perform songs from The Getaway on a festival stage for the first time in the US and no doubt crush the stage just like they've done so many times over the last 14 years. This is their fourth invitation to Lolla and it certainly won't be their last. Prediction: RHCP headline Lollapalooza 2018, the year they release album number 12.\n\nDon't miss a minute of Red Bull TV's Season of Festivals coverage.
