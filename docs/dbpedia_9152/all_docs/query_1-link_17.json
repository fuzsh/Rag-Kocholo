        "text": "Singer-songwriter Anthony Kiedis of Red Hot Chili Peppers fame has another hit on his hands, but it’s not a single or the rock band’s long-awaited studio album No. 12. It’s a custom home the frontman had built along Kauai’s North Shore, where stretches of boulder-strewn sand give way to stunning ocean views.\n\nPriced at $9.975 million and completed in 2008, the nearly 3,000-square-foot contemporary has a distinctly Hawaii vibe.\n\nThe single-story house dons the requisite low-profile roof-line and vertical plank siding. But the interior spaces of the house are set a story above the ground on lava stone pillars topped by the tapered columns one might expect on a Craftsman home. The configuration creates a shaded outdoor living area with direct access to the half-acre of grounds.\n\nThe use of vertical planks continues in the light and bright rooms. The white-walled great room, grounded by wide plank walnut flooring, sits under a tray ceiling and envelopes the living area, kitchen and dining room. A chandelier and windows on three sides bring light into to the airy dining nook.\n\nThe kitchen features an undermount sink, black basalt countertops and a mix of open shelving and cabinetry. Custom light fixtures hang above the large center island, which has both prep and eating space. The top-of-the-line stainless steel appliances include a Viking six-burner gas cooktop, a Viking oven and a Sub-Zero refrigerator.\n\nNearby, wide decking surrounded by resilient Ipe wood handrails creates an outdoor dining room. An outdoor stairway descends to the lawn.\n\nAmong the three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms is the primary suite. Set to one side of the house for privacy, it has a lanai, a soaking tub and a steam shower. Glass tile accents surround the top of the tub.\n\nThe top level of the house has two more en-suite bedrooms and a media room that could be converted to an additional bedroom. A child’s room features built-in bunk beds and a built-in desk.\n\nThere’s also a powder room with a rock sink basin. Other features include built-in bookshelves, built-in audio and automated blinds.\n\nTiffany Spencer and Ben Welborn of Hawaii Life are the listing agents for 7336 Alealea Road, Hanalei. The custom furnishings may be negotiated separately.\n\nThe home is about a 10-minute drive from downtown Hanalei. Surfing, hiking, diving and restaurants are all close at hand."
