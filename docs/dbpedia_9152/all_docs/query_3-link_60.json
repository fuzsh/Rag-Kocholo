John Frusciante and company did not disappoint us; they delivered an unforgettable concert to be remembered for a lifetime.\n\nAs pioneers of the funk-rock genre, Red Hot Chili Peppers has sold over 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Their impact extends beyond record sales, with their energetic live performances captivating audiences across the globe. With hits like “Under the Bridge,” “Californication,” and “Scar Tissue,” RHCP has cemented its legacy as a music icon.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers revealed that their “Unlimited Love Tour” would continue into 2024 across the U.S., following extensive tours in 2022 and 2023.

Already a massive success, it was the 7th highest-grossing tour of 2022 and the band’s highest-grossing ever, exceeding $300 million in revenue.\n\nThe newly announced dates will kick off on May 28 and keep the band on the road through July 30.
