        "text": "A few years ago, I found myself in the rather dubious position of defending the musical legacy of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A colleague was writing an essay on the popularity and permeance of “reggae-rap-rock party bands” — his words, not mine — and wanted my take on why the Peppers’ particular brand of music still resonated with audiences.\n\nI told him that the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ breakout album, 1991’s “Blood Sugar Sex Magik,” was the first album I ever bought with my own money. I told him that they’d been a consistent musical presence in my formative years throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. I even argued that the band’s 1995 album, “One Hot Minute” (their sole record with Jane’s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro), was criminally underrated.\n\nBut my main treatise within that conversation was this: That while it may be cool or indie to be dismissive of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ music if you live in Southern California, it’s important to remember that the vast majority of Peppers’ fans don’t live in California. They are, to quote frontman Anthony Kiedis, “all around the world.” For many fans, the band’s music defines the “California sound.” Just as previous generations had bands like the Beach Boys and The Eagles, and later, Sublime and 2Pac, I would argue that the Chili Peppers’ music defined the concept of the “California dream” for an entire generation of kids who were stuck in fly-over states that were anything but golden.\n\nGiven the amount of people who sang along to hits such as “Otherside,” “Snow (Hey Oh),” and, naturally, “Californication,” at the band’s packed concert at Petco Park on Wednesday, I wasn’t alone in this sentiment. I’m notoriously non-nostalgic about the music of my youth, but for the San Diegans who showed up on this night, seeing the Peppers live served as something of a reminiscence, an opportunity to see a band that helped define California in their minds.\n\nTake for example, Virginia Esteban, who flew into San Diego from the Dominican Republic to see the band with her daughter, Emily, who was literally wearing a chili pepper costume to the concert. Virginia commented that seeing the band was something that was on her “bucket list” while Emily added that attending the concert with her mom was a “dream come true.” There was also the Martinez family, who drove in from Goodyear, Ariz., and who were just hoping to hear the songs that bonded them as a family.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers at Petco Park\n\nEach of these fans had particular songs that hit home, almost all of which the band played Wednesday. And of the new songs the band played from its new album, “Unlimited Love,” most were of the mellow, anthemic power ballad variety the band perfected with hits like “Under the Bridge” and “Soul to Squeeze.” All the hallmarks were there: tender earnestness from Kiedis, dutiful drumming from Chad Smith, funky bass rhythms from Flea and soulful shredding from guitarist John Frusciante, who rejoined the band for the third time in 2019.\n\nAdmittedly, I’d been dismissive of the band’s output since 2006’s excessive double album, “Stadium Arcadium,” but found that the songs they played on this night from that album had aged quite well. Both “Dani California” and “Snow (Hey Oh),” especially the latter, now seem to rank with some of their best songs. Overall, the band brought a nice balance to the show, weaving in new songs with big hits without missing a beat.\n\nOne of those new songs they played, “She’s a Lover,” with its references to domesticity, parenthood and even a demand to “wake up and squeeze me,” very well could be a sequel of sorts to “Soul to Squeeze.” It’s a song that is much more lyrically mature, directly exploring more grown-up issues. Honestly, it’s a stance I hope they lean into on their second album to be released this year, “Return of the Dream Canteen” (due in October).\n\nStill, as grown up as they seemed on this song and others, the band still gyrated, thrashed and rocked out as if they weren’t all approaching their 60s.\n\n“We’re going surfing tonight,” exclaimed Flea just before the band launched into the classic “Suck My Kiss.” “If any of you mother-[expletive] want to go with us, we’ll be there around 11.”\n\nThere’s something to be said for a stadium band that still banters with the audience like this. Sure it’s immature, but it seemed to hit home the fact that, however big they get, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are still a band of the people, wherever those people may have come from.\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers, Petco Park setlist, July 27, 2022\n\n1.
