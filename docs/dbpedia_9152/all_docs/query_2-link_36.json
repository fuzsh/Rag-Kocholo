        "text": "Led by singer Anthony Kiedis, who grew up in the Grand Rapids area, the Chili Peppers uncorked a night to remember Sunday at Van Andel Arena. (Review, photo gallery)\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR PHOTO GALLERY\n\nAlthough the Red Hot Chili Peppers lace their songs with copious references to their home base of California, for one weekend, the legendary rock band gave all its West Coast love to Grand Rapids.\n\nFrom drummer Chad Smith’s eventful night on the town Saturday, sitting in with local bands at a few downtown watering holes, to singer Anthony Keidis on Sunday at Van Andel Arena recalling his childhood years growing up in Lowell, the concert proved to be a tender and heartfelt homecoming for a band with deep roots in West Michigan.\n\nIt was also an emotionally charged, energetic rock show by one of the biggest rock bands in the world, transcending the sold-out arena of 12,000 strong into a community of music lovers. A state-of-the-art light show, captivating performances and wild fans were among just a few of the highlights in this June tour stop behind the band’s new album, “The Getaway.”\n\nLaunching their set with a rollicking rendition of “Can’t Stop”, the Chili Peppers garnered an eruption of applause the moment Flea pounded out the rhythmic opening riff.\n\nPerhaps their biggest mainstream hit, “Dani California” saw the crowd mirror Keidis’ vocals on every word. A rambling guitar solo followed and the sold-out stadium rocked along to Josh Klinghoffer’s fretboard wizardry.\n\n“Californication” provided somber nostalgia, while “Dark Necessities,” a nearly new release, was a reminder of the band’s pop sensibility and timeless sound.\n\nAs is typical, Kiedis and Flea eventually rid themselves of their shirts and conjured up the psychedelic vibes for “Aeroplane,” an upbeat song with a catchy California groove as the chorus.\n\nPAYING TRIBUTE TO HILLEL SLOVAK AND BLACKIE DAMMETT\n\nIn between songs, Flea stepped to the mic, and while fighting back tears, commemorated the 29th anniversary of original RHCP guitarist, Hillel Slovak’s death, who died of heroin overdose on June 25, 1988.\n\nAfter a moment of silence for the late Chili Pepper, the band welcomed onstage another former member, drummer Jack Irons (who was also one of the evening’s openers, along with Deerhoof). Irons joined the group for “Fire,” doubling Smith’s rhythms on a second drum kit upstage.\n\nOnce again, a tender moment filled the space between songs. In an emotional and urgent tone, Kiedis took a moment to talk about his father, Blackie Dammett, who he said was expected to soon pass away.\n\n“But it’s OK. It’s his time,” Kiedis said. “He’s had a wild, colorful life. He’s had a hell of ride.”\n\nSo have the Chili Peppers, who concluded their Sunday night ride with an encore that boasted no shortage of energy, applause or funk.\n\nThe band performed “Give it Away” for their final song, firing on all cylinders.\n\nAs the last chords rang out in reverb-soaked unison, the mesmerizing lights offered up a final display: Descending in a staggered fashion, so perfectly coordinated, the red beams of light took the shape of the all-familiar Red Hot Chili Peppers star, glowing brightly and floating over thousands of screaming fans."
