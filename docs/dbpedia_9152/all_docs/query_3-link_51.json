        "text": "Red Hot Chilli Peppers on Tour\n\nTo many, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are more than just a Los Angeles rock band from the '80s -- they're musical pioneers who took the world by storm with their eclectic blend of funky, alternative punk rock laced with hip-hop that sounded unlike anything anyone had heard before. The band first formed in Los Angeles in 1983 and quickly gained a following large enough to sell 300,000 copies of their debut self-titled album. Over the next few years, the band experimented with different musical genres and went through lineup changes, proving themselves to be one of the most innovative and resilient rock groups in recent history. In 2022, the Grammy-winning band released Unlimited Love -- their 12th studio album and first one with original guitarist John Frusciante since 2006's Stadium Arcadium. Celebrating the release of the new album, the band hit the road for a global tour featuring all four original members -- vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and Frusciante. Be sure to see this legendary ensemble back in action performing classic hits and new songs by grabbing tickets to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers in a city near you today.\n\nTHE VENUE AT THUNDER VALLEY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY EVENT\n\nSat • Feb 17 • 8:00 PM\n\nThe Venue at Thunder Valley Casino Resort, Lincoln, CA\n\nImportant Event Info: ***THE VENUE AT THUNDER VALLEY ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY EVENT\n\nMUST BE 21 TO ATTEND.
