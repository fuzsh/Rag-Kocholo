The 2024 run kicks off in May and will include a stop inÂ Cincinnati, Ohio at Riverbend Music Center on Friday, July 5 with special guest IRONTOM.\n\nAfter wrapping up dates in North America and Europe last year, the band continued their global trek into 2023 with several dates across New Zealand and Australia in January, followed by another run of shows throughout North America, Europe, the UK, Singapore and Japan earlier this year. Most recently, Red Hot Chili Peppers concluded their sold-out Latin America leg of their 2023 tour with two shows in Buenos Aires.\n\nAs a result of the two album releases last year going #1, Red Hot Chili Peppers notably stand out as the first rock band in 17 years to achieve the feat. Moreover,Â Return of the Dream CanteenÂ bowed at #1 on theÂ BillboardÂ Top Album Sales Chart âjust like its predecessorÂ Unlimited LoveÂ did in April 2022. Both albums were produced by longtime collaborator and creative confidant, Rick Rubin. Plus, it reached #1 in numerous countries around the globe.\n\nLast year, Red Hot Chili Peppers took home the prestigious Global Icon Award and delivered a show stopping performance at the MTV VMAs. Their No. 1 single âBlack Summer” also won the award for Best Rock Video. In addition, “Black Summer” scored a Grammy nomination for “Best Rock Song” and the band garnered an MTV Europe Music Award nomination for Best Rock and earned threeÂ American Music AwardsÂ nominations for “Favorite Rock Artist,” “Favorite Rock Album” forÂ Unlimited LoveÂ and “Favorite Rock Single” for “Black Summer.”"
