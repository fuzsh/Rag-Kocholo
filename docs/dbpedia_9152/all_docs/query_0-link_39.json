        "text": "Resilient. Ambitious. Innovative. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been to hell and back wearing nothing but a tube sock.\n\nInspired by an eclectic mix of genres, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were the architects of a new sound, stretching the bounds of rock and their own creativity to their limit.\n\nThe word pioneers is regularly used to describe the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and with good reason: The band—which today consists of Anthony Kiedis on vocals; Michael Balzary, long known to fans as Flea, on bass; Chad Smith on drums; and recent addition Josh Klinghoffer on guitar—birthed a blend of punk, funk, and hip-hop that has since influenced every group to marry rap and rock.\n\nThe first of the early-nineties alternative bands to follow Nirvana into the upper echelons of the charts, the Chili Peppers injected a splash of color to that movement’s oft-gray canvas, their funky jams and flamboyant garb (or lack thereof) providing relief from grunge’s punk-metal sludge and flannel shirt uniform."
