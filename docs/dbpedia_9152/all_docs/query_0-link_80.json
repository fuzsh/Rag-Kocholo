        "text": "On the same day Blood Sugar Sex Magick celebrates its 30th birthday, the Red Hot Chili Peppers revealed that they will embark on a global stadium tour in 2022.\n\nThe band made the announcement in a faux-news broadcast, with co-anchors Johnson Hammerswaddle (or Anthony Kiedis) and Todd the Squirrel (Flea) alerting viewers of KHOT News about the band’s plans, but not before giving a rundown of the day’s news.\n\n“Half of humanity will boil alive by next Thursday, and there’s a new chicken sandwich coming out,” Todd the Squirrel said before kicking it over to weatherman Randy Raindrops (Chad Smith).\n\nGuitarist John Frusciante — as himself — then joined the broadcast to reveal, “We’re gonna do a tour starting in June 2022”; the U.S. leg will kick off in July.\n\nTrending\n\nThe trek will mark the band’s first in 15 years with Frusciante, who reunited with the band back in December 2019 following a 10-year absence. As Live Nation noted in a press release that accompanied the announcement, “All the tour dates, sales information, support acts and other factoids will be available shortly.”\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers last performed live together at a benefit show in November 2019, a gig that was guitarist Josh Klinghoffer’s final concert with the band.\n\nThe tour kicks off in Europe at Estadio La Cartuja in Seville, Spain on June 4th and runs through mid-July before a 19-date trek through North America. Tickets go on sale October 15th, with a RHCP fan presale beginning on October 9th. Guests in North America include the Strokes, Beck, HAIM, St. Vincent, Thundercat, and King Princess.\n\n2022 North American Tour Dates\n\nJuly 23 – Denver, CO @ Empower Field at Mile High*\n\nJuly 27 – San Diego, CA @ Petco Park*\n\nJuly 29 – Santa Clara, CA @ Levi’s Stadium+\n\nJuly 31 – Los Angeles, CA @ SoFi Stadium+\n\nAugust 3 – Seattle, WA @ T-Mobile Park^\n\nAugust 6 – Las Vegas, NV @ Allegiant Stadium^^\n\nAugust 10 – Atlanta, GA @ Truist Park^\n\nAugust 12 – Nashville, TN @ Nissan Stadium^\n\nAugust 14 – Detroit, MI @ Comerica Park^\n\nAugust 17 – E.
