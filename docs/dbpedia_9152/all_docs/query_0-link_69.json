        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nFormed in 1983 in Los Angeles, California, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' punk, funk, rap and rock sound really began to take off just as the alternative rock movement became popular. With their Grammy-winning singles, the band became international rock stars. Despite drug problems and line-up changes, the group has maintained their success and popularity throughout the years. In this http://www.WatchMojo.com video, we take a look at the history of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\n\nFormation\n\nAlternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers formed in Los Angeles, California in 1983. Consisting of vocalist Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Josh Klinghoffer, bassist Michael “Flea” Balzary, and drummer Chad Smith, the group went through several member changes before this current line-up.\n\nFirst Albums\n\nAfter playing local shows, the band was discovered by EMI and they released their self-titled debut in 1984. The funk rock record received college radio airplay and rotation on MTV. Their sophomore effort, 1985’s Freaky Styley¸ mixed the genres of punk and funk. Though the Red Hot Chili Peppers were more satisfied with this album, mainstream success continued to evade them.\n\nDrugs and Line-Up Changes\n\nAmidst their members’ growing drug addictions, they released The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, in 1987. The album was their first to chart on the Billboard 200. A year later, the band’s original guitarist, Hillel Slovak, died from a drug overdose and was ultimately replaced by John Frusciante. Shortly thereafter, Chad Smith replaced departed drummer, Jack Irons.\n\nGlobal Success\n\nThe Chili Peppers’ next album was 1989’s Mother’s Milk. With more focus on melody as opposed to rhythm, it gave the band their first taste of global success. The effort also generated the modern rock hit “Knock Me Down”) and the Stevie Wonder cover “Higher Ground”. The single, “Taste the Pain,” was also featured on the “Say Anything” movie soundtrack.\n\nRock Stars\n\nThe album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, dropped in 1991. Hitting the third position on the Billboard 200, it became one of the most influential albums to come out of the ‘90’s alternative rock scene. The well-received record turned the band into international rockstars. It also spawned several successful singles like the Grammy-winning, “Give it Away” and the number-two hit, “Under the Bridge”.\n\nDave Navarro and \"One Hot Minute\"\n\nThe band’s popularity grew so much that Frusciante quit in the middle of the subsequent tour. He was replaced with Dave Navarro, whose first and only album with the Red Hot Chili Peppers was 1995’s One Hot Minute. Featuring more heavy metal guitar riffs, the darker-sounding record received mixed reviews. It contained singles such as “Aeroplane” and “My Friends,” which was their third number-one on the Modern Rock chart.\n\nMovie Soundtrack\n\nIn 1996, the Chili Peppers released a cover of the Ohio Players song “Love Rollercoaster,” from the “Beavis and Butthead Do America” film soundtrack. Then, after spending some time on tour, the Red Hot Chili Peppers replaced Navarro with Frusciante in 1998.\n\n\"Californication\"\n\nThe group’s next album was 1999’s Californication. With more melodic guitar riffs, the critically acclaimed disc reached the third spot on the Billboard chart and was their most commercially successful effort to date. It yielded singles such as the popular title track, the number-one Modern Rock song, “Otherside” and the Grammy-winning tune, “Scar Tissue”.\n\nTouring and Another Album\n\nThat same year, they embarked on an international world tour and they released their first concert DVD, “Off the Map” in 2001. The next year, the band came out with By the Way. The album had more ballads and less rap-propelled funk jams than previous efforts and peaked at number two. Though it was a bit of a departure for the Chili Peppers, it still produced numerous hits, including “Can’t Stop” and the title cut.\n\n\"Stadium Arcadium\"\n\nIn 2006, the double album, Stadium Arcadium was released. Not only did the disc premiere at number one on the Billboard 200 but it became the best-selling album of that year. It won multiple Grammys and contained successful singles such as “Tell Me Baby,” “Snow (Hey Oh),” and “Dani California”.\n\nDepartures and New Record\n\nAfter another world tour that ended in 2007, the Red Hot Chili Peppers went on hiatus to work on personal projects. Two years later, with Josh Klinghoffer replacing Frusciante on guitar, the band began work on their tenth record.\n\nTenth Album\n\nI’m With You was released in 2011 and its first single was the song, “The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie”.\n\nA Funky Band\n\nKnown for their alternative rock-style mixing funk, punk and rap and for their fun live shows, the Red Hot Chili Peppers have certainly made a solid name for themselves in the world of rock music."
