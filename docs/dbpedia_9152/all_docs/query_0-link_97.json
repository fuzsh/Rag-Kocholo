        "text": "RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS ANNOUNCE 2023\n\nGLOBAL TOUR\n\nTickets On Sale Starting Friday, December 9th at 10am Local at RedHotChiliPeppers.com\n\nFor approved artist images and hi-res tour art, please download HERE.\n\nToday, acclaimed rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers announced their 2023 Tour, in support of their two #1 studio albums that were released in 2022, Unlimited Love and Return of the Dream Canteen. Following a recent Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song for “Black Summer,” the band will embark on a 23-date global trek that kicks off on Wednesday, March 29th at BC Place in Vancouver, BC with stadium shows and festival stops across North America and Europe in Las Vegas, San Diego, Houston, Lisbon, Madrid, Vienna and more before wrapping up on Saturday, July 23rd in Glasgow, UK at Hampden Park. The Strokes, Iggy Pop, The Roots, The Mars Volta, St. Vincent, City and Colour, Thundercat, and King Princess will join the band on select dates.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers 2023 Tour comes close on the heels of the band’s largest 40-date stadium tour to date, which included massive sold-out shows in London, Paris, Los Angeles, and more. Notable artists such as A$AP Rocky, Anderson .Paak, Beck, HAIM and more joined the band on the road through 2022. After completing the wildly successful tour across North America and Europe this year, Red Hot Chili Peppers continue into January 2023 with 8 dates across New Zealand and Australia, featuring Post Malone.\n\nTICKETS: Tickets go on sale starting Friday, December 9th at 10am local time at redhotchilipeppers.com.\n\nPlease note, the Red Hot Chili Peppers show originally scheduled for Summer 2022 in Glasgow, UK will now take place on Sunday, July 23, 2023 at Hampden Park Stadium. Existing tickets remain valid, but will be re-issued for the new date. Limited tickets remain and will be available during the general on sale.\n\nAs a result of the two album releases this year going #1, Red Hot Chili Peppers notably stand out as the first rock band in 17 years to achieve the feat. Moreover, Return of the Dream Canteen bowed at #1 on the Billboard Top Album Sales Chart —just like its predecessor Unlimited Love did back in April. Both albums were produced by longtime collaborator and creative confidant, Rick Rubin. Plus, it reached #1 in numerous countries around the globe.\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers recently took home the prestigious Global Icon Award, and delivered a show stopping performance at the MTV VMAs. Their No. 1 single “Black Summer'' also won the award for Best Rock Video. This year, the band also garnered an MTV Europe Music Award nomination for Best Rock and scored three American Music Awards nominations for \"Favorite Rock Artist,\" \"Favorite Rock Album\" for Unlimited Love and \"Favorite Rock Single\" for \"Black Summer.\"\n\nRED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 2023 NORTH AMERICA TOUR DATES:\n\nWed Mar 29 – Vancouver, BC – BC Place *~\n\nSat Apr 01 – Las Vegas, NV – Allegiant Stadium #~\n\nThu Apr 06 – Fargo, ND – FARGODOME ^~\n\nSat Apr 08 – Minneapolis, MN – U.S. Bank Stadium ^~\n\nFri Apr 14 – Syracuse, NY– JMA Wireless Dome ^~\n\nFri May 12 – San Diego, CA – Snap Dragon Stadium >+\n\nSun May 14 – Phoenix, AZ – State Farm Stadium ^+\n\nWed May 17 – San Antonio, TX – Alamodome ^+\n\nFri May 19 – Gulf Shores, AL – Hangout Music Festival =\n\nThu May 25 – Houston, TX – Minute Maid Park ^+\n\nRED HOT CHILI PEPPERS 2023 EUROPE TOUR DATES:\n\nSun Jun 18 – Landgraaf, NL – Pinkpop =\n\nWed Jun 21 – Warsaw, Poland – PGE Narodowy <\n\nSat Jun 24 – Odense, DK – Tinderbox =\n\nMon Jun 26 – Mannheim, DE – Maimarktgelände <\n\nFri Jun 30 – Leuven, BE – Rock Wercther =\n\nSun Jul 2 – Milan, IT – I-Days =\n\nThu Jul 6 – Lisbon, PT – NOS Live =\n\nSat Jul 8 – Madrid, ES – Mad Cool =\n\nTue Jul 11 – Lyon, FR – Groupama Stadium <~\n\nFri Jul 14 – Vienna, AT – Ernst-Happel Stadion <~\n\nMon Jul 17 – Carhaix, FR – Les Vieilles Charrues =\n\nFri Jul 21 – London, UK – Tottenham Hotspur Stadium %~\n\nSun Jul 23 – Glasgow, UK – Hampden Park %~\n\nKey\n\n^ The Strokes\n\n< Iggy Pop\n\n% The Roots\n\n# St. Vincent\n\n> The Mars Volta\n\n* City and Colour\n\n+ Thundercat\n\n~ King Princess\n\n= Festival Date\n\nCONNECT WITH RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS"
