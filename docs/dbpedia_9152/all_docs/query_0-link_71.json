        "text": "Where Everybody Knows Your NameGary Portnoy\n\nThe TV show Cheers was nearly canceled after its first season, but the theme song, \"Where Everybody Knows Your Name,\" was very popular. To satisfy viewer demand, the theme was made into a full song and released as a single.\n\nHow Sweet It Is To Be Loved By YouMarvin Gaye\n\n\"How Sweet It Is To Be Loved By You\" by Marvin Gaye was inspired by Jackie Gleason's saying, \"How Sweet It Is!\"\n\nYou Are Not AloneMichael Jackson\n\nMichael Jackson's 1995 song \"You Are Not Alone\" was the first single in US history to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart at #1\n\nHound DogElvis Presley\n\nThe songwriting team Leiber and Stoller wrote \"Hound Dog\" for a blues singer named Big Mama Thronton, who first recorded the song in 1953. Elvis covered it in 1956, and it became his biggest hit.\n\nRun To YouBryan Adams\n\n\"Run To You\" by Bryan Adams was written for Blue Oyster Cult, and the guitar part is modeled after \"Don't Fear The Reaper.\" BOC turned it down, so Adams recorded it for his album Reckless.\n\nHappiness Is A Warm GunThe Beatles\n\nJohn Lennon got the title of the Beatles song \"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\" from an article in a magazine published by the National Rifle Association.\n\nArrested For Your Art - The Story Of 2 Live Crew's \"Obscene\" AlbumSong Writing\n\nIn the summer of 1990, you could get arrested for selling a 2 Live Crew album or performing their songs in Southern Florida. And that's exactly what happened.\n\nThey Might Be GiantsSongwriter Interviews\n\nWho writes a song about a name they found in a phone book? That's just one of the everyday things these guys find to sing about. Anything in their field of vision or general scope of knowledge is fair game. If you cross paths with them, so are you.\n\nDirector Wes Edwards (\"Drunk on a Plane\")Song Writing\n\nWes Edwards takes us behind the scenes of videos he shot for Jason Aldean, Dierks Bentley and Chase Bryant. The train was real - the airplane was not."
