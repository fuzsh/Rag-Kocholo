Their show in Anthony’s hometown with a critic review in the local newspaper, …Dressed in what looked like executioner’s mask and striped pajamas, the long blonde-haired Kiedis often became a whirling dervish on stage as he flew into wild, spastic movements. Kiedis took off the mask and exposed his face by the fourth song, which is when Flea took the opportunity to expose a part of his anatomy. The Red Hot Chili Peppers left after playing only 35 minutes – this after taking the stage more than an hour later than scheduled. The Chili Peppers, who had earlier done a deliberate, funked-up version of country crooner Hank Williams’ “Why Don’t You Love Me,” came back for an encore several minutes later. More than half the crowd had left by that point, but there were still a couple dozen fans crowded near the front of the stage waiting for more when a stage hand announced: “That’s all. They’ll be back another time.”\n\nNovember 5 – Pittsburgh, PA – The Decade\n\nNovember ? – Philadelphia, PA – Love Hall\n\nNovember 8 – New York City, NY – The Ritz (CMJ Music Marathon) with What Is This?\n\nNovember 11 – Boston, MA – Rathskeller\n\nNovember 14 – Hoboken, NJ – Maxwell’s\n\nNovember 15 – Columbus, OH – Little Brother’s (Setlist:: 1.

This was a one-time opening act for Gary Allen from Neighbor’s Voices.\n\nIn the autobiography by Blackie Dammet “Lords of the Sunset Strip”, he writes: the Grandia Room on Melrose was by day and most nights an unpretentious pub but one night a week they turned it into the Rhythm Lounge wich booked cabaret artists and underground bands to perform on a tiny platform. Cheap became priceless on that memorable Thursday night in February 1983 when the dynamics of music changed dramatically and altered the balance of the L.A. scene. In a MTV interview Anthony said that he and Flea where pretty sure about the date february 13 which was on a Sunday. In the official published book, “an Oral Visual History”, Flea and Gary Allen discuss the Thursday night at the Rhythm Lounge which should make it february 10 because Flea made a comment on a gig he played with Fear at Devonshire Downs on feb.4 that this was just before the red hots. While the timeline in the book states that it was on january 6 wich was also Thursday.\n\nHillel and Jack had a gig on Thursday feb.24 with their band What is This? at Madam Wong’s.\n\nThis makes it all pretty sure that it all happened on a Thursday night but\n\nthe exact date of this memorable one song gig is still not confirmed.\n\nFebruary 17 – Hollywood, CA – Rhythm Lounge @ the Grandia room\n\nThe French manager/DJ who had been blown away by their first performance at the Rhythm Lounge invited them over one week after to play again they only had two songs. This was the premiere of “Get Up And Jump”\n\nAround this time, the band kept jamming songs by day and rocking the Rhythm Lounge by night. This went on until they had about 9 songs.\n\nMarch 5 – Hollywood, CA – The Cathay de Grande\n\nThis was their third show possibly called the “RapBeatFunkOff” and supposedly the first they played as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. They played two new songs: “Nevermind” and “Police Helicopter” and some acappella interludes, one of those being “Stranded”\n\n– March 31 – Hollywood, CA – Rhythm Lounge @ the Grandia room\n\n– April 13 – Hollywood, CA – The Anti Club (with Green On Red)\n\n– May ?? – Hollywood, CA – The Cathay de Grande\n\nCathay de Grande (1600 N. Argyle Avenue 90028) was a Chinese restaurant in Hollywood that in 1980 turned punk when Fred Paterson began DJing and then booking bands here. Closed in 1985. There was a little confusion that it was also called the China Club around this time but that happened after closing, maybe around 1989.\n\nMay ?? – Hollywood, CA – The China Club (setlist; 1.Out in LA 02. Sex Rap 03. Stranded 04. Police Helicopter 05. Green Heaven 06. Get Up And Jump 07. Dum Chucka Willie 08. Fire 09. Flea Fly 10. Nevermind) This setlist comes from a tape that stated “China Club” and is the earliest recording of the band till now.\n\nMay 28 – Hollywood, CA – Fiesta House This show was in the last weekend of May, so it also could be the 29th. They played a 15 minute set according to Peter Wesley Bastone who was forced to do the sound at that gig.\n\nJune 4 – Hollywood, CA – The Anti Club (Other acts; Tex & the Horseheads, The Beat EE ‘Os, Carmaig The Forrest) They told back then to the Scratch magazine that this was their best show.\n\nJune 11 – Los Angeles, CA – The Vex (with The Mutants) This was about the RHCP’s 10th gig ever.\n\nJune 17 – Hollywood, CA – The Anti Club (Headliner; The Alley Cats)\n\nJune 18 – Ventura, CA – The Plant (with The Mentors and Tex & the Horseheads)\n\nJuly ?? – Hollywood, CA – The Mix Club @ Stardust Ballroom (with; Circle Jerks, Social Distortion, Fear, Fishbone) A special event for the opening of this new club under the Stardust Ballroom. Run Dmc should be headlining the show but they arrived after closingtime so they never played that night.\n\nJuly 3 – Hollywood, CA – Kit Kat Club (The Peppers made a name for themselves after this gig at this local strip joint called the Kit Kat Club. The people were concentrating much more on girl than on them so they returned for the encore ‘Fire’ wearing nothing but socks over their manhoods. After the show, Lindy Goetz became their manager. Together with Roid Rogers And The Whirling Butt Cherries with Cliff Martinez on drums.\n\nJuly 4 – Hollywood, CA – Music Machine (with; Blood On The Saddle, Flesheaters, and Electric Peace)\n\nJuly 18 – Hollywood, CA – Club Lingerie (Headliner; Bad Brains – setlist; 1. Green Heaven, 2. Thirty Dirty Birds, 3. Baby Appeal, 4. You Always Sing The Same, 5. Get Up And Jump, 6. Nevermind, 7. Fire) ‘They opened for Bad Brains and at end of the gig they jammed together, they also had their first review in the L.A. Times which said that they where great when playing their songs but when playing around between songs, it seems to amuse only them and a few unlookers so they would better concentrate on music!\n\nJuly 25 – Hollywood, CA – Music Machine (with; Psychobud and Blood On The Saddle)\n\nJuly 31 – Hollywood, CA – Al’s Bar (with; Necropolis of Love)\n\nAugust 4 – Ventura, CA – The Plant (with; Tex & the Horseheads and Tupelo Chain Sex)\n\nAugust 17 – Universal City, CA – Universal Amphitheater (Headliner; Oingo Boingo – ‘In Anthony’s Autobiography Scar Tissue, he writes about opening up for Oingo Boingo on page 125: “…I had other things to attend to, one of which was opening up for Oingo Boingo at the Universal Amphitheater. Oingo Boingo had come up from the same club scene we were in, and they’d just kept going. They weren’t our favorite band in the world, but they had some interesting instrumentation. We knew their trumpet player, and he offered us the opening slot for their big show. Here we were with no record deal, a ten-song repertoire, and we were going from playing in a club before two hundred people to playing to an audience of four thousand. We went out onstage that night wearing our weirdest clothes. Right in the middle of the first song, Flea broke a bass string. suddenly, it was crickets time, and I had to talk to the audience while Flea changed his string. Withing seconds, the crowd was booing and throwing stuff at us, chanting, “We want Oingo Boingo.” But it was combustible material for getting the energy going. We started in again, and Flea was so wound up that he broke another string. At this point, Danny Elfman, who was the lead singer of Oingo Boingo and also a fan of ours, strolled onstage wearing a bathrobe and with a face full of shaving cream, as if he was coming straight from his dressing room. He took the mike and told the crowd that he really liked us and they should be respectful, and then he left, but the few unruly guys in the crowd didn’t heed his endorsement. We soldiered on and got cooking, and by the time we were finished, I think we let them know that we were for real and that they had just been hit with something they wouldn’t soon forget.\n\nSeptember ?? – Hollywood, CA – Club Lingerie\n\nSeptember 9 – Hollywood, CA – Radio City\n\nSeptember 10 – Hollywood, CA – Kit Kat Club This was the triumphant return to the Kit Kat Club after their first historical socks performance in July.\n\nOctober ?? – Aspen, CO – The Cathay Grand Club The first out of town gig.\n\nOctober ?? – Hollywood, CA – Cathay de Grande\n\nOctober ?? – Irvine, CA – The Heritage Room\n\nOctober 29 – Ventura, CA – The Plant (with The Minutemen and Blood On The Saddle)\n\nNovember ?? – Costa Mesa, CA – The Concert Factory\n\nNovember 7 – Hollywood, CA – Club Lingerie (with Tex & the Horseheads and Screamin’ Sirens)"
