Forty years on the road, and these gentlemen continue to amaze us.

On July 6, 2023, we fulfilled a dream: seeing Red Hot Chili Peppers live for the first time. We were at NOS Alive in Portugal, and the anticipation was immense to witness a performance by one of our favorite bands of all time. John Frusciante and company did not disappoint us; they delivered an unforgettable concert to be remembered for a lifetime.

As pioneers of the funk-rock genre, Red Hot Chili Peppers has sold over 80 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Their impact extends beyond record sales, with their energetic live performances captivating audiences across the globe. With hits like “Under the Bridge,” “Californication,” and “Scar Tissue,” RHCP has cemented its legacy as a music icon.

Red Hot Chili Peppers revealed that their “Unlimited Love Tour” would continue into 2024 across the U.S., following extensive tours in 2022 and 2023. With their relentless momentum, the band shows no indication of slowing down, as they unveil their forthcoming US tour scheduled for this year, 2024.

If you want to know the tour dates, if they will be performing in your city, and where to buy tickets, then this article is for you.

Red Hot Chili Peppers Concert Tour Dates

The Red Hot Chili Peppers are still rocking on their epic tour featuring the classic hits and new ones from their latest chart-toppers, “Unlimited Love” and “Return of the Dream Canteen.” They’re not slowing down anytime soon!

The “Unlimited Love Tour” across the United States is part of the Global Stadium Tour, which began in June 2022 in Seville, Spain, and will span the globe until concluding in July 2024 in St. Louis, Missouri.

It’s worth noting that the current Red Hot Chili Peppers tour marks the return of the talented guitarist John Frusciante, fifteen years later. Already a massive success, it was the 7th highest-grossing tour of 2022 and the band’s highest-grossing ever, exceeding $300 million in revenue.

The newly announced dates will kick off on May 28 and keep the band on the road through July 30. This time, they’re bringing some artists along for the ride, including Kid Cudi, Ice Cube, Ken Carson, Otoboke Beaver, Sean Kuti, Wand, and Irontom.
