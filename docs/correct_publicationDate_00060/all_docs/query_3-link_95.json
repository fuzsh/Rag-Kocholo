        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nDoes Knoebels REALLY offer free parking, admission, entertainment and picnic facilities?\n\nYes! Knoebels is America’s largest free-admission amusement park and also offers free parking, free daily entertainment and free picnic facilities. We take pride in being not only a place the whole family can enjoy, but also a place for families with any budget! During your visit, you’ll have the option to pay per ride with \"Ticket Books\" (available every day), or get unlimited rides for one low price with a \"Ride All Day Pass\" (available weekdays). Learn more about how to reserve a picnic pavilion or hire Knoebels to cater your picnic.\n\nWhat types of rides are at Knoebels?\n\nStrap in and get ready for some of the best amusement park rides anywhere! Kiddie rides, thrill rides, family rides and attractions—Knoebels has something for everyone. Enjoy the Grand Carousel, one of the very few where you can still catch the brass ring, or check out the Phoenix Roller Coaster and the Twister—our two world-class wooden roller coasters! Take a look around and check out all of the rides; there are over 60!\n\nWhat is the Knoebels dress code?\n\nFor your safety, guests are required to wear shirts and shoes at all times. Closed-toed shoes are strongly recommended.\n\nRevealing or offensive clothing is not considered park-appropriate attire. In keeping with a family-friendly atmosphere, modest dress is expected. Bikini bottoms or tops, exposed undergarments, see-through attire, speedos, and thongs are not permitted.\n\nWhile at the Crystal Pool or riding Sklooosh, swimsuits can be worn but must be changed to park-appropriate attire immediately afterwards.\n\nSome language, gestures and suggestive art on apparel or tattoos may be considered inappropriate.\n\nKnoebels reserves the right to address any attire concerns with guests.\n\nIs smoking/vaping permitted at Knoebels?\n\nKnoebels is committed to clean air. At Knoebels, we care about all of our guests, and as part of our clean air commitment, smoking (including vapor and e-cigarette usage) is restricted to designated areas throughout the park. These areas are marked on our park maps. You can recognize the designated smoking areas in the park by their blue benches. We have created nine smoking areas within the park and one in the pool area. We hope to help preserve the safety and health of our guests. Your cooperation is appreciated. The campground, pavilions and parking area are not included in this policy.\n\nWhat are Knoebels’ hours of operation?\n\nThe park’s schedule of operation varies throughout the seasons. Please see the official website calendar for official park hours. In order for the park to close at an appropriate time, some rides require the lines to be cut prior to the park’s official closing.\n\nWhat if it rains during my visit?\n\nSeveral rides will close due to weather conditions such as rain, high winds, and/or lightning. A specific answer as to which rides close or remain open is not possible because of the varying degrees of inclement weather. Knoebels makes every effort to reopen the rides as quickly and safely as possible following the end of adverse weather conditions. We do not offer rain checks or refunds; however, our individual ride tickets never expire!\n\nAre wheelchairs, wagons and electric convenience vehicles available for rent?\n\nYes! Visit the Rent-All building off of the park’s main boulevard near the parking lot to rent wheelchairs, wagons and electric convenience vehicles for a daily fee. All rentals require that you leave a valid driver’s license at our desk, which will be returned to you upon return of your rental.\n\nFor more information and pricing, please click here!\n\nFor the safety of all guests, golf carts, segways, bicycles (or devices with bicycle-like wheels), scooters, shoes with built-in wheels, ATVs, UTVs, remote controlled devices, and hoverboards are not permitted. Personal ECVs are permitted, however they must travel no faster than 3mph, have three or more permanently fastened wheels that are the size of a standard ECV, and be similar in size to those available for rental at Knoebels. All personal ECVs are subject to approval by Knoebels' management. To check in advance please contact Guest Services seven or more days prior to visit.\n\nAre pay-one-price plans available on weekends?\n\nWith the exception of select pre- and post-season weekends, pay-one-price plans are available Monday through Friday only.\n\nAre pets permitted at Knoebels?\n\nKnoebels insists that all pets be on leashes and kept under control, and all pet owners are required to clean up after their pets. We do realize, however, that not all pets that visit the park are comfortable with their surroundings. It is for that reason that we reserve the right to ask anyone whose pet appears to be uncomfortable or is not under control to please take the pet out of the park.\n\nGuests may not leave pets unattended at any time, including our guests staying at Knoebels campgrounds. Pets are not permitted in any restaurant, gift shop, cabins, cottages, eagle roosts, trailers, and most rides. Knoebels does permit service animals. Please download the Guest Accessibility Guide for a list of Rides that accommodate service animals.\n\nWhere is first aid located?\n\nThe first aid station is located at the end of the main park office building across from The Flyer. It is staffed from 9:00 a.m. until approximately one hour after the park closes by a professionally trained Emergency Medical Technician, Paramedic, and/or Licensed Practical Nurse.\n\nDoes Knoebels make charitable donations?\n\nKnoebels receives many donation requests on a daily basis, and the number has become somewhat overwhelming. Although most of the requests come from worthy organizations, unfortunately we can’t honor every one of them. We have decided to limit our donations to school fundraisers directly related to the needs of academic programs and serving as much of the entire student body as possible. We provide a standard donation of two ride all day passes. We also work with a select few larger partner organizations, such as Give Kids the World. To find out if your organization qualifies for a donation, please click here.\n\nDoes Knoebels offer military discounts?\n\nKnoebels is happy to honor our heroes! Once per season, all Active Duty members of the military can receive a $40 book of ride tickets. Retired/disabled veterans can receive a $20 book of ride tickets.\n\nWhat items should I not take on a ride?\n\nKnoebels suggests that visitors planning to go on rides only bring items that can be safely secured by zipper, Velcro or buttoned pockets.\n\nDue to the dynamics of some of our rides, loose articles are not permitted and should be left with non-riders or secured in lockers. Loose or hand-held articles include, but are not limited to, cameras (including handheld, mounted, and video), cell phones, selfie sticks, pagers, purses, stuffed animals, basketballs, prizes, hats, loose-fitting jewelry, glasses, backpacks, etc. Knoebels is not responsible for lost or stolen items, which include items that fall out of pockets. Ride operators and attendants are not responsible for articles left by patrons at the ride stations. Neither Knoebels nor its employees assume responsibility for the loss of, or damage to, personal property. Locker storage is available throughout the park (see next question).\n\nAre lockers available for rent?\n\nLockers are available on a first-come, first-serve basis and located at various locations throughout the park for a nominal fee.\n\nAcross from the Security a-frame building\n\nOn the side of the Sklooosh restrooms\n\nAcross from Stony Gables near the handstamp building\n\nOn the side of the Phoenix restroom\n\nOn the side of the Big Wheel restroom\n\nA locker is provided at the Crystal Pool with admission\n\nWhat forms of payment are accepted at Knoebels?\n\nThe Pay-One-Price Ride Pass Building, Guest Services, ticket booths, major food stands and our gift shops accept:\n\nCash\n\nVISA\n\nMasterCard\n\nDiscover/Novus Card\n\nAmerican Express\n\nBank debit cards\n\nKnoebels Gift Cards\n\nApple Pay\n\nGoogle Pay\n\nPlease note that while credit cards are not accepted at our midway games, we do sell special games tickets at any ticket booth and Guest Services.\n\n*Personal checks are not accepted in the park.\n\nIs alcohol allowed at Knoebels?\n\nAlcoholic beverages of any type are not permitted in the park, catering or parking areas."
