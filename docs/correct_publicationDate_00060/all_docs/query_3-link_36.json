        "text": "Hey everyone, welcome to or welcome back to my blog! Today I’m going through how to read Mariana Zapata’s books. Mariana Zapata is one of my favourite authors of all time and definitely my favourite romance author. her books can all be read as standalone but a lot of the later ones included cameos with other characters so today I’m writing up a quick summary of which books are connected and how you should read them.\n\nHonestly, I started with The Wall of Winnipeg and Me and then went from there and I think it’s fine to just pick and choose whatever most interests you and then go on from there. The cameos rarely impact the plot in any major way and you can treat all of MZ’s books as standalones, but if you want to read in either publication or chronological (from what I can guess) order, that’s what I’m going through today!\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick graphic to save to your phone I highly recommend this one I found on Pinterest.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL ORDER\n\n*the best that I can guess\n\nLingus\n\nUnder Locke\n\nKulti (connected to Under Locke)\n\nRhythm, Chord & Malykhin (small mention of Kulti)\n\nLuna and the lie (connected to Lingus, The Best Thing & Hands Down)\n\nThe Wall of Winnipeg and Me (connected to Hands Down)\n\nDear Aaron (Small mention of RC&M + TWOW&M. Connected to From Lukov with Love – mc is Jas’ sister)\n\nFrom Lukov with Love (connected to Dear Aaron)\n\nThe Best Thing (connected to Luna & The Lie & Hands Down)\n\nHands down (cameo from Jas & Ivan [FLWL])\n\nWait for It (set 2/3 yrs after TWOW&M. Connected to Winnipeg, Kulti, Under Locke & Hands Down)\n\nAll Rhodes Lead Here (mentions Kulti)\n\nAs of Nov 2022, When Gracie Met The Grump (2022) is part of a different universe & Lingus has no cameos.\n\nAs you can see, MZ’s later books have more mentions or others characters & cameos. These are really fun to spot if you’ve read her other books but they’re not important to the story most of the time so you really don’t have to read them in chronological order unless you’re super adamant about it.\n\nPUBLICATION ORDER\n\n2012 – 2022\n\nLingus (2012)\n\nUnder Locke (2014)\n\nKulti (2015)\n\nRhythm, Chord & Malykhin (2015)\n\nThe Wall of Winnipeg and Me (2016)\n\nWait For It (2016)\n\nDear Aaron (2017)\n\nFrom Lukov with Love (2018)\n\nLuna and The Lie (2018)\n\nThe Best Thing (2019)\n\nHands Down (2020)\n\nAll Rhodes Lead Here (2021)\n\nWhen Gracie Met The Grump (2022)\n\na\n\na\n\nA\n\nA\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nA\n\nA\n\na"
