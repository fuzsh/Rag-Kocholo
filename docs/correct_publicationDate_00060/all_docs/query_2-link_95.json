        "text": "Born on September 21 in the year 1866, Herbert George Wells cannot just be called a sci-fi writer, a socialist or a futurist. A mastermind is the closest we can get to describing him, and if you don't already know why, read on.\n\nIntroducing Wells to someone who doesn't know him\n\nProlific in many genres, HG Wells has written dozens of novels, short stories, and works of social commentary, satire, biography, and autobiography, including even two books on war games.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHe was most prominent as a futurist; a prophetic social critic who devoted his literary talents to the development of a progressive vision on a global scale.\n\nThe sci-fi king foresaw the advent of aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television, time travel, alien invasion, invisibility, biological engineering and something resembling the World Wide Web.\n\nReferred to by some as the Shakespeare of science fiction, he is the mind and wordsmith behind sci-fi romances like 'The Time Machine', 'The Invisible Man' and 'The War of the Worlds'.\n\nEven though Wells has been accredited with being the most influential writer by many, he is among those unsung heroes who don't even have the most prestigious award -- the Nobel -- to call their own.\n\nHe was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times -- but never bagged it.\n\n6 futuristic prediction by Wells that came true\n\n1. War and nuclear and laser weapons\n\nIn his 1914 novel 'The World Set Free', Wells envisioned 'atomic bombs' that could explode continuously using the power of radioactivity.\n\nHe also warned that a global government was the only way of preventing nation states from destroying themselves with nuclear weapons, and predicted biological conflict and laser weaponry in his 1898 novel The War of the Worlds.\n\nHe signalled us the Star Wars before it was cool!\n\nEven in 1933 'The Shape of Things to Come', Wells spoke of global conflict, world superpowers, bombing raids and gas attacks.\n\nIf the world read these works of his, the Second World War could probably have been skipped!\n\n2. Wireless communication\n\nIn Wells' alternate reality novel 'Men Like Gods' (1923), people communicate exclusively with wireless systems that employ a kind of co-mingling of voicemail and email-like properties.\n\n3. Moon and space exploration\n\nIn 'The First Men in the Moon' (1901), Wells imagined a lunar adventure of two characters.\n\nThis is said to have anticipated the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing.\n\nIn Wells' 'When the Sleeper Wakes', he also mentioned Martian tripods, moving walkways and aircrafts.\n\nIn 'Anticipations' (1900), Wells predicted the 'abolition of distance' by real-life technologies such as the railway, by stressing on the now-true fact that since the inhabitants of different nations can travel towards each other more quickly and easily, they should do it peacefully.\n\n4. Genetic science\n\nDr Moreau's experiments in 'The Island of Dr Moreau' (1896) involved vivisection, creating human-animal hybrids, surgical transplants and blood transfusions -- things that are now routinely conceived for medical research-- presaged the age of genetic engineering.\n\nIn addition to that, it is also concluded that the novel was the first prediction of the now-real concept of humans playing God by controlling nature.\n\n5. Freedom in the true sense\n\nIt was Wells who envisioned a Utopia-like government ruling nation states which would give every person the right to be as well-educated as possible (especially in the field of science), have work which satisfies them, and the freedom to enjoy their personal life with privacy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAlong with that, he visualized trade and property for every man and woman on Earth, and 'freedom from any sort of mutilation or sterilisation' and from torture.\n\nThe rights he spoke of now have legal force in nations (as can be seen in the United Nations 1948 Declaration of Universal Human Rights) if not universal existence, so can still be called an aim he has passed on to generations.\n\n6. The World Wide Web\n\nIn 1937, the writer laid out a vision for something he called the 'Permanent World Encyclopaedia,' which was published as an essay and later in the book World Brain.\n\n\"A great number of workers would be engaged perpetually in perfecting this index of human knowledge and keeping it up to date,\" he wrote in the essay.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFurther, he added that \"[It] will be made accessible to every individual...It need not be concentrated in any one single place...It can be reproduced exactly and fully, in Peru, China, Iceland, Central Africa.\"\n\nIn case you haven't already guessed, the living example of this 'World Wide Web' prediction of Wells' is what we call Wikipedia, Google, or the internet as a whole.\n\nLearning from Wells\n\nHailed as a genius, Wells has helped shape the imagination of a range of writers from George Orwell, to Jorge Luis Borges, to every science fiction writer who has gained fame after him.\n\nWhile political leaders globally use nationalism as a way to distinguish between humans, Wells' ideology of our shared origin, evolution, universal rights and international co-operation leads us to a more unanimous future.\n\nAlso read: Why Michael Jackson's songs on climate change and racial inequality need to be youth anthems now\n\nAlso read: World Poetry Day: Some exceptional pieces from the most remarkable poems ever written\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
