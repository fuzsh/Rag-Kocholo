        "text": "If you have ever wondered how the universe physically works, then this book focusing on the central role that rotational motion plays in our daily lives will lead you to new discoveries, knowledge, and wisdom.\n\nRotation is found everywhere but often overlooked. There are rotating wheels on cars, wheels that spin in games of chance, Ferris wheels at city carnivals, and other manifestations of rotation that play an essential role in virtually everything we do. Even more important is how everyday phenomena driven by rotation make up life’s intrinsic components.\n\nSupported by historical information about the lives of individuals who have contributed to the understanding of rotation, this book delves into the physical principles that explain hurricanes, trade winds, gravity measurements, and much more.\n\nRotation continues to play a large role in the world, and it’s possible that the universe itself rotates. Take a journey defined by new ideas and little-known facts in Wheels in the Sky, a must read for anyone interested in the origin and workings of the universe."
