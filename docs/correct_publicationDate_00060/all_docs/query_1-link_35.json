        "text": "San Diego author’s “Hell on Two Wheels” takes readers inside the 3,000 mile Race Across America.\n\nWhen Amy Snyder first pitched the idea of writing a book about long-distance bike racers, the response was quick and to the point.\n\n“If it’s not written by Lance Armstrong”, a publicist told her, “you don’t stand a chance.”\n\nLast week, Snyder’s book “Hell on Two Wheels” was released and quickly became the No. 1 cycling book on Amazon.com.\n\nSynder, who has called La Jolla home for the past six years, is a first-time author and she says every day is a new adventure in her life thanks to her new book.\n\n“In the first 24 hours it became the No. 1 book in Amazon’s cycling category,” Synder said. “And it was No. 767 overall. I was just astounded by that — to break 1,000 on the first day was just crazy.”\n\nSnyder’s journey to writing a book on an endurance sport is a bit unconventional. It was only after she retired in 2005 that she took part in her first Ironman Triathlon. At age 45, Snyder found that experience “taught me a lot about myself, failure … it taught me that being vulnerable and asking for help is OK.”"
