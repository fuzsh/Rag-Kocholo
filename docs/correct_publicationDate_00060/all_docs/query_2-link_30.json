        "text": "Herbert George Wells, better known as H.G. Wells, was a prolific English writer who is widely considered one of the founders of science fiction. Born in 1866, Wells’s life and work were deeply intertwined with the rapid technological and societal changes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His novels, often exploring themes of time travel, alien invasion, and social commentary, continue to captivate readers and inspire filmmakers to this day.\n\nEarly Life and Influences\n\nWells’s early life was marked by both privilege and hardship. He was born into a lower-middle-class family in Bromley, Kent. His father, a shopkeeper, struggled financially, and Wells was forced to leave school at a young age to work as a draper’s assistant. Despite his limited formal education, Wells was an avid reader and possessed a voracious appetite for knowledge. He later received a scholarship to attend the Normal School of Science in South Kensington, where he studied biology and zoology.\n\nWells’s scientific background profoundly influenced his writing. He was fascinated by the potential of science and technology to shape the future of humanity. This fascination is evident in his most famous works, such as The Time Machine (1895), The War of the Worlds (1898), and The Invisible Man (1897). These novels explore the consequences of scientific advancement, both positive and negative, and challenge readers to consider the ethical implications of technological progress.\n\nA Visionary Writer\n\nWells’s science fiction was not merely escapist entertainment. He used his stories to address social and political issues of his time. The Time Machine, for example, is a critique of social inequality and the potential for humanity to destroy itself. The War of the Worlds, set against the backdrop of British imperialism, explores themes of xenophobia and the dangers of unchecked power. Wells’s work was often controversial, but it always aimed to provoke thought and inspire debate.\n\nLegacy and Impact\n\nH.G. Wells’s influence on science fiction and popular culture is undeniable. His novels have been adapted countless times for film, television, and radio. His ideas about time travel, alien invasion, and the potential for human evolution continue to resonate with audiences today. Wells’s work also inspired generations of science fiction writers, including Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, and Ray Bradbury.\n\nIn addition to his science fiction, Wells wrote extensively on social and political topics. He was a vocal advocate for socialism and world peace. His non-fiction works, such as The Outline of History (1920), are considered classics of historical writing. Despite his diverse interests and accomplishments, Wells is best known for his pioneering work in science fiction. He is considered one of the most influential writers of the 20th century, and his legacy continues to inspire and challenge readers around the world.\n\nKey Works"
