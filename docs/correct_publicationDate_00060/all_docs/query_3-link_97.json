        "text": "Mary McLain/NPR\n\nAny time is a good time for a hot read — and just in time, our annual reader poll is here! We're celebrating the NPR Books Summer of Love, and we have 100 great romance novels for you, from historical to paranormal to LGBTQ to the subgenre that started it all, category romance (the slim-spined Harlequins of your childhood).\n\nBack in June we asked you to tell us about your favorite romantic reads, and you responded in droves. (We had to shut the poll down early after more than 18,000 nominations flooded in!) Once the votes were tallied, we turned to our expert panel, reviewers Bobbi Dumas and Sarah Wendell, and authors Sherry Thomas and Michelle Monkou, to help us break down the categories and shape the final list into a love story for the ages.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope and belief that readers new to the romance genre can pick up any recommended title on the list and find an interesting, affecting and satisfying read,\" says Thomas. We hope new readers and longtime fans alike will find a happily ever after here — but if we've left out one of your favorites, please tell us about it in the comments!\n\nHere's a printable list to take to your local library, and here are some quick links to make it easier for you to navigate: Historical, Classics, YA, Suspense, Science Fiction and Fantasy, Paranormal, LGBTQ, Erotic Romance, Inspirational, Contemporary, Category Romance.\n\nHistorical\n\nLord of Scoundrels (Scoundrels series)\n\nby Loretta Lynda Chase\n\nWe recommend the entire Scoundrels series in any order, but Lord of Scoundrels stands out for the matchless banter between gruff, unruly Sebastian Ballister, Marquess of Dain, and his lovely nemesis Jessica Trent — an unrepentant bluestocking who's determined to wrest her dimwitted brother Bertie away from Ballister's crowd of rowdies.\n\nIndigo\n\nby Beverly Jenkins\n\nLike so many of the authors whose names came up in this poll, it was hard to pick just one Beverly Jenkins book, but both our readers and our panelists agree, this story of love on the Underground Railroad is a standout favorite. Coming in a close second was another historical romance, Topaz, about a feisty newspaperwoman who ends up married, only slightly against her will, to a handsome deputy marshal.\n\nBuy Featured Book\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nOutlander (series)\n\nby Diana Gabaldon\n\nOne of the most popular picks in our poll, Diana Gabaldon's swashbuckling, century-spanning tale of a World War II nurse who tumbles backward in time to the Scottish Highlands in 1743 — and falls in love with a roguish young soldier — is now a hit television series.\n\nBuy Featured Book\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nTexas Destiny\n\nby Lorraine Heath\n\nHouston Leigh survived the Civil War, though badly scarred both inside and out. But will he survive a dangerous journey along the wild trails of Texas with Miss Amelia Carson, his handsome brother's mail-order bride?\n\nThe Serpent Garden\n\nby Judith Merkle Riley\n\nLeft in debt when her philandering artist husband is murdered by his mistress's own jealous husband, Susanna Dallet must rely on her skills as a painter of miniatures to survive her new position at the court of the devious Cardinal Wolsey. Luckily, there's a wayward angel and a handsome but easily ruffled court secretary looking out for her.\n\nThe Madness of Lord Ian MacKenzie (MacKenzies series)\n\nby Jennifer Ashley\n\nAs with so many entries in this list, you really should read the whole series. But if we had to pick just one, it'd be this one. Brilliant and yes, troubled, Ian MacKenzie has been banished to an asylum by his cruel, powerful father. Freed upon his father's death, Ian makes an impulsive marriage proposal to Beth Ackerly, a wealthy widow who decidedly wants no more drama in her life.\n\nThe Bedwyn Saga\n\nby Mary Balogh\n\nMary Balogh is a prolific historical romance author, and readers gave the most votes to her books about the spectacular, seductive Bedwyn brothers and sisters. But we'd be remiss if we didn't also mention her excellent Survivor's Club series, about seven survivors of the Napoleonic wars who find themselves convalescing together at a stately home in England.\n\nRavished\n\nby Amanda Quick\n\nFossil-hunting rector's daughter Harriet Pomeroy summons the notorious Viscount St. Justin to sleepy Upper Biddleton to hunt the thieves who've been hiding loot in the caves where she works. Love, intrigue and a lot of old bones can't be far behind. Amanda Quick is a pseudonym for the prolific contemporary romance author Jayne Ann Krentz (who also writes futuristic romance under the name Jayne Castle).\n\nBuy Featured Book\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nThe Wallflowers (series)\n\nby Lisa Kleypas\n\nLisa Kleypas writes solid contemporary romances too, but this series about a quartet of 19th-century young women who band together to conquer the London marriage market was a favorite with our voters and our panelists.\n\nThe Bridgertons (series)\n\nby Julia Quinn\n\nYou can start pretty much anywhere in this beloved series about an alphabetically named family (Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Daphne ... all the way to Hyacinth). The Bridgertons are some of the most famous siblings in romance — and the books are also a lovely example of familial love surrounding the individual love stories.\n\nThe Brothers Sinister (series)\n\nby Courtney Milan\n\nThere's nothing actually sinister in this interconnected series of stories about very smart women (a chess prodigy, a newspaper publisher, a scientist and an astronomer, among others) and the left-handed men they fall for. Courtney Milan is a master of the intelligent relationship discussion — which, trust us, is incredibly romantic.\n\nThe Rules of Scoundrels (series)\n\nby Sarah MacLean\n\nFour notorious aristocrats — Bourne, Cross, Temple and the mysterious Chase — have built their lives around London's most notorious gambling hell, The Fallen Angel. But love has a way of offering absolution (without making you give up the baccarat table).\n\nFlowers from the Storm\n\nby Laura Kinsale\n\nThe dissolute Duke of Jervaulx is brilliant at both seduction and writing scientific papers — which he does with a blind Quaker mathematician. But when he's left speechless and straitjacketed by a stroke, it's up to the mathematician's daughter, Maddy Timms, to see that there's still a man inside the restraints — and to reconcile her Quaker faith with her growing love.\n\nSpindle Cove (series)\n\nby Tessa Dare\n\nThe seaside town of Spindle Cove is often known as \"Spinster Cove\" because of its lively population of unmarried women. But even in this haven for disaffected or delicate ladies, love finds a way in.\n\nMaiden Lane (series)\n\nby Elizabeth Hoyt\n\nRegency England is one of the most popular settings for historical romance, but Elizabeth Hoyt steps back a century for the Maiden Lane books, set in a bustling, grimy 1730s London that teems with gin sellers and foundlings, noblemen and small, irritating dogs. And in the background is the mysterious Ghost of St. Giles, a sword-wielding vigilante who may be a guardian of the city's poor — or something more sinister.\n\nPennyroyal Green (series)\n\nby Julie Anne Long\n\nThe Everseas and the Redmonds rule the lovely Sussex, England, town of Pennyroyal Green — and the two powerful families can't stand each other. Naturally, that leads to secrets, grudges and all kinds of attraction, for the Everseas and the Redmonds, and anyone else who comes to town.\n\nThe Bride\n\nby Julie Garwood\n\nWhen the king orders Scottish laird Alec Kincaid to take an English bride, he sets his sights on Jamie, the youngest daughter of Baron Jamison. But Jamie has sworn she'll never love such an arrogant, brooding Highland barbarian — and that's even before murderous rumors begin to circulate about Alec.\n\nThe Pink Carnation (series)\n\nby Lauren Willig\n\nLauren Willig takes the plot of The Scarlet Pimpernel and runs wild with it in this swoon-worthy series about florally named spies battling it out against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. Bracketing the historical romance is modern-day historian Eloise Kelly, who unmasks the titular Pink Carnation (and finds a love of her own) while researching her dissertation.\n\nA Knight in Shining Armor\n\nby Jude Deveraux\n\nWe couldn't quite decide where to file this time-traveling romance, but eventually we went with the setting for the start of Nicholas Stafford's story. He's a 16th-century knight reincarnated in the 20th to clear his unjustly tarnished name, with the help — and soon the love — of Dougless Montgomery, an American abandoned in England by her faithless fiance.\n\nNot Quite a Husband\n\nby Sherry Thomas\n\nOur expert panelist Sherry Thomas landed on the list with this emotionally intense story of a young Victorian nobleman who travels the world to find his estranged wife — a rare-for-her-time surgeon who has made a new life for herself in a far corner of India.\n\nDesperate Duchesses (series)\n\nby Eloisa James\n\nEloisa James is a professor of Shakespeare when she's not writing romance, and it shows in these sparkling stories, laced not just with Shakespeare, but also with Marlowe and Christopher Smart. It's almost as fun to play spot-the-literary-reference as it is to follow the adventures of James' exquisite duchesses.\n\nSomething Wonderful\n\nby Judith McNaught\n\nOne of Judith McNaught's most beloved books, Something Wonderful is the story of innocent country girl Alexandra, who saves cynical nobleman Jordan from a highway robbery — and winds up married to him after a misunderstanding. But Jordan doesn't quite know what to do with his young and very unexpected bride.\n\nThe Windflower\n\nby Laura London\n\nAt over 500 pages, The Windflower may be a little dense for some readers, but this tale of a gently reared young American miss swept away by a dashing English pirate captain is a classic of old-school romance — and it's finally been reissued after years out of print.\n\nThe Spymasters (series)\n\nby Joanna Bourne\n\nThe lure of the Napoleonic Wars proves strong again in Joanna Bourne's Spymasters books, featuring a cast of dashing French and British spies finding love amid the danger. Bourne's ability to write convincingly French dialogue — in English — makes this series a standout.\n\nThe Duke of Shadows\n\nby Meredith Duran\n\nEmmaline Martin, betrayed by her caddish fiance, meets soon-to-be-duke Julian Sinclair in India just before the sepoy uprising of 1857. They fall hard for each other, but a deception keeps them apart until a cold London spring, years later.\n\nBeast\n\nby Judith Ivory\n\nLouise Vandermeer is 18, beautiful, rich, bored and very aware that her life is limited by those factors. To escape, she agrees to marry aristocratic rake Charles d'Harcourt sight unseen, unaware that a scar and a limp mar his looks. For a lark, Charles decides to travel on his fiancee's ocean liner and seduce her secretly in her darkened stateroom — but the prank backfires when he falls madly in love with his own wife to be.\n\nBuy Featured Book\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nTo Have and to Hold\n\nby Patricia Gaffney\n\nRachel Wade is finally free after years in prison for the death of her husband, a crime she did not commit. But as a thoroughly fallen woman, the only work she can find is as housekeeper to the cynical, jaded Viscount D'Aubrey.\n\nThe Captive\n\nby Grace Burrowes\n\nGillian, the Countess of Greendale, has survived a brutal first marriage. Christian, Duke of Mercia, has survived capture and torture by the French. When she takes over the management of his household upon his return to England, these two terribly damaged people begin to build a new life together. (This, too, is part of a series that's worth checking out in any order you want to read them.)\n\nThe Lotus Palace (series)\n\nby Jeannie Lin\n\nSet in colorful Tang Dynasty China, these richly detailed romantic mysteries center on the celebrated courtesans of the Lotus Palace, who seem to attract as much trouble as admiration.\n\nAll Through the Night\n\nby Connie Brockway\n\nAnne Wilder leads a double life: respectable war hero's widow by day, roof-crawling jewel thief by night — a dangerous pursuit that leads her straight into the arms of Colonel Jack Seward. But Jack doesn't know that the seductive thief who charmed him, and the honorable widow he loves, are one and the same.\n\nBlaze\n\nby Susan Johnson\n\nPortrayals of Native Americans in romance can be problematic, but our judges loved this story of a spoiled Boston heiress who heads west with her father to inspect some gold mines, and the Harvard-educated Absarokee leader who challenges their claims.\n\nBuy Featured Book\n\nYour purchase helps support NPR programming. How?\n\nMorning Glory\n\nby LaVyrle Spencer\n\nWidowed Elly Dinsmore has been treated cruelly in her small Georgia town. She's got two young boys and a third on the way, and she needs a man to help out. So she places a classified ad for a husband — and gets Will Parker, a lonely drifter condemned to live on the fringes of society after serving time for murder. Morning Glory takes readers on an emotional rollercoaster of love, betrayal, war and trials, but Will and Elly finally get their happy ever after.\n\nSimple Jess\n\nby Pamela Morsi\n\nIn the aptly named town of Marrying Stone, Ark., widow Althea Winsloe has been given an ultimatum by the townsfolk: Find a husband by Christmas, or they'll find one for her. The last thing she expects is to fall for farmhand Jess Best, a good man who's been written off by the town because he doesn't think quite as fast as they do.\n\nThe Morning Gift\n\nby Eva Ibbotson\n\nRuth Berger, daughter of a Jewish professor, was meant to escape Vienna, but her plans went awry. As the Nazis march on the city, her father's colleague Quinton Somerville decides to rescue her with a quick marriage of convenience — he'll sweep her away to England, and they'll get a quick annulment. But neither Quin nor Ruth counted on falling in love.\n\nA Lady Awakened\n\nby Cecilia Grant\n\nButtoned-up widow Martha Russell is desperate. If she doesn't produce evidence of an heir soon, her late husband's cruel family will seize the estate she loves.
