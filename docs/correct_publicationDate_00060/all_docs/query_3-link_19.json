        "text": "I enjoyed Towers of Midnight, but of the final three books, it has the most problems. Not big problems, but noticeable ones. It's here that we see how difficult it must have been for Sanderson to effectively split the single narrative Jordan had planned into three separate but well-structured novels.\n\nWhen you first read Towers of Midnight, nothing seems out of the ordinary. The plot carries on from the previous book, as you would expect. But then, you realise something is wrong. First, Tam Al'Thor ended the last book with Rand, but now he's with Perrin and doesn't seem bothered by what happened between him and Rand. When Perrin's army arrives at a location, they had already been camped at in the previous book. And then, about halfway through the book, characters start discussing the climax of the previous one as if it's currently happening.\n\nYes, Rand's plotline in The Gathering Storm is happening halfway through everyone else's storylines in Towers of Midnight.\n\nIt's confusing. But also necessary.\n\nLessons learned\n\nEveryone who has read The Wheel of Time knows that the most poorly received book in the series - at publication, at least - was Crossroads of Twilight. Why? Because it didn't address the fallout of a major plot event at the climax of the previous book but went back to other characters prior to it happening.\n\nThis is what Sanderson needed to avoid. The Gathering Storm needed to end with Rand's big climax. But in order to make the final three books equal in size, Sanderson had to rearrange the characters as best he could.\n\nWrapping up plotlines\n\nThe other issue Sanderson had to deal with in Towers of Midnight was wrapping up all the loose plotlines. We're about to go into the Last Battle. Anything that doesn't get tied up now isn't going to have time later.\n\nSome characters have endings that feel satisfying. Berelain and Galad, for example, I find extremely adorable. These two have been secondary characters throughout the series, both doing what they feel they believe is right, only in different ways. Seeing their instant infatuation is a wonderfully fitting climax for them.\n\nBut then there are those that feel shoehorned in. Morgase and Tallanvor's relationship, for example, smacks of a loose end that should have been quietly tied up several books ago.\n\nMoiraine and Thom\n\nOkay, this is the third time I've read through The Wheel of Time. I do not see any indication of a relationship between Moiraine and Thom anywhere. I'm sorry, it just comes out of nowhere. I don't mind it, but if someone can show me any evidence this was foreshadowed, that would be great.\n\nWhat happens afterwards\n\nWhat happens in a story after the good guys win? I mean, this story takes fourteen books to reach its climax. It would be understandable for the characters - or the readers - to not think beyond the Last Battle. After all, if they lose, there won't be a future, so why expend effort into planning for it?\n\nNot Robert Jordan. I'm pretty sure this is one of the ways his time in the Vietnam War influenced his writing. He saw first-hand the dangers of going into a conflict with no end goal. And so he intended for Rand to be better than that.\n\nWe first saw it with Rand's schools, intending to gather and preserve as much knowledge as possible. Now we see him making plans for what will happen to the world when they win the Last Battle and no longer have a common enemy. Especially after the Dark One has been sowing chaos for so long.\n\nBut this mindset also gives us a repeat of one of my favourite moments in the entire series.\n\nBack in Book Four, The Shadow Rising, we were shown the history of the Aiel in what remains one of my favourite pieces of writing of all time. In a masterpiece in minimalist world building, we were shown history in reverse, using small glimpses at key points in time to build a story that spanned hundreds of years.\n\nNow we get this again but in the opposite direction, with Aviendha being shown a possible future for the Aiel. Again, through the smallest vignettes, we are given just enough information to create an entire timeline."
