        "text": "Welcome to our annual Most Anticipated post!\n\nThat’s right, if our 2023 Awards didn’t destroy your TBR, this list will be sure to finish it…\n\n(Note: The list was curated by our contributors, and is ordered by expected publication date. All blurbs and publication information have been gathered from Goodreads, Amazon, and publishers’ websites. We’ve included links to Goodreads and to sites where you can pre-order the books where available\n\nadding not-yet released books to your “want to read” list massively helps authors, especially debuts, and pre-ordering them even more so – please go make someone’s new year extra happy!)\n\nJANUARY\n\nThe Sunlit Man\n\nBrandon Sanderson\n\nYears ago he had comrades in arms and a cause to believe in, but now the man who calls himself Nomad knows only a life on the run. Forced to hop from world to world in the Cosmere whenever the relentless Night Brigade gets too close, Nomad lands on a new planet and is instantly caught up in the struggle between a tyrant and the rebels who want only to escape being turned into mindless slaves-all under the constant threat of a sunrise whose heat will melt the very stones. Unable to understand the language, can he navigate the conflict and gain enough power to leap offworld before his mind or body pay the ultimate price?\n\nFrom his record-breaking Kickstarter, The Sunlit Man is one of four incredible new novels by one of the world’s biggest fantasy writers.\n\nExpected release: 2nd January (Gollancz)\n\nGoodreads | Gollancz.co.uk\n\nThe Atlas Complex\n\nOlivie Blake\n\nThe Atlas Complex marks the much-anticipated, heart-shattering conclusion in Olivie Blake’s trilogy that began with the internationally bestselling dark academic phenomenon, The Atlas Six.\n\nOnly the extraordinary are chosen. Only the cunning survive.\n\nAn explosive return to the library leaves the six Alexandrians vulnerable to the lethal terms of their recruitment.\n\nOld alliances quickly fracture as the initiates take opposing strategies as to how to deal with the deadly bargain they have so far failed to uphold. Those who remain with the archives wrestle with the ethics of their astronomical abilities; elsewhere, an unlikely pair partner to influence politics on a global stage.\n\nAnd still the outside world mobilizes to destroy them — while the Caretaker himself, Atlas Blakely, may yet succeed with a plan foreseen to have world-ending stakes. It’s a race to survive as the six Society recruits are faced with the question of what they’re willing to betray for limitless power — and who will be destroyed along the way.\n\nExpected release: 9th January (Pan Macmillan)\n\nGoodreads | Bookshop.org\n\nThirteen Ways to Kill Lulabelle Rock\n\nMaud Woolf\n\nA washed up star creates a clone tasked with eliminating other clones of herself; a whip-smart and thrilling sci-fi read that’s perfect for fans of Orphan Black, Killing Eve and Keeping it Real by Justina Robson.\n\nSet in a world of the near future, the celebrity elite have access to a technology that allows them to make perfect copies of themselves, known as Portraits. These Portraits exist to fulfil all the various duties that come as the price of fame.\n\nOur protagonist is the thirteenth copy made of the actress known as Lulabelle Rock. Her purpose is very to track down and eliminate her predecessors.\n\nWhile initially easy, her task is made difficult by the labyrinthine confusion of Bubble City and the unfortunate stirrings of a developing conscience. When she makes the mistake of falling in love with one of her targets, the would-be assassin faces the ultimate question; when you don’t want to kill yourself, what’s the alternative?\n\nExpected release: 9th January (Angry Robot)\n\nGoodreads | Bookshop.org | Nils’ Review\n\nFaeboundSaara El-Arifi\n\nFrom the Sunday Times bestselling author of THE FINAL STRIFE, comes an enchanting new trilogy.\n\nDIVIDED BY BLOOD.\n\nIMPRISONED BY FATE.\n\nBOUND BY DESIRE.\n\nWELCOME TO THE INTOXICATING WORLD OF THE FAE.\n\nYeeran is a warrior in the elven army and has known nothing but violence her whole life. Her sister, Lettle, is trying to make a living as a diviner, seeking prophecies of a better future.\n\nWhen a fatal mistake leads to Yeeran’s exile from the Elven lands, they are both forced into the terrifying wilderness beyond their borders. There they encounter the impossible: the fae court.\n\nThe fae haven’t been seen for a millennium.
