        "text": "I have been a huge fan of the author Lindsey Kelk ever since I read I Heart New York many years ago. I have gone on to read pretty much all of her books over the years and I will buy her new releases without even reading the blurb.\n\nMany of them were read before I started reviewing books but I decided that she deserved an author spotlight here on the blog. Read on for reviews of her latest novel “In Case You Missed It” as well as several back titles.\n\nLindsey Kelk Book Reviews & Recommendations\n\nOn a Night Like This (December 2021)\n\nOn a Night Like this by Lindsey Kelk is her best work to date in my opinion. I couldn’t put it down.\n\nSet on a yacht in the Med, our main character Fran, is acting as a PA to popstar Juliette, on the way to the exclusive Crystal Ball. There is plenty of fun and chaos along the way as Fran gets to experience the celebrity lifestyle. Now whilst this is a perfect bit of escapism into a world that most of us could never even imagine, the characters feel real which makes it even more enjoyable.\n\nA real page turner which I highly recommend.\n\nIn Case You Missed It (July 2020)\n\nIn Case You Missed It is the 2020 release from Lindsey Kelk and is another winner in my opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed this story about Ros who returns home from working in the USA and wants everything to go back to how it was before she left. There’s lots of fun to be had and some life lessons to learn until she finally comes to realise that the present is what’s important. There is a predictable “will they, won’t they?” but it kept me wanting to read on to make sure the happy ending happened. A fun read.\n\nI heart New York, Hollywood, Paris, Las Vegas, London, Christmas, Forever, and Hawaii\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, many years ago I bought a book from a car boot sale for 20p called I heart New York. It was written by the then-unknown author to me called Lindsey Kelk. I find that borrowing from a library, or buying the first book secondhand is a cost effective way to try a different author.\n\nBuying I heart New York turned out to be a very good buy as I couldn’t put it down. It was such a pleasure to read. Chick lit at its finest.\n\nAs it was an older release, I was delighted to discover there were several more titles in the I heart series. Obviously, I went out and bought the rest immediately and have continued to buy each new book as it has been released.\n\nThe I heart stories follow the life of blogger and writer Angela Clark, and her friends/loves along the way. She stumbles from one disaster to the next in the glamourous world of journalism and fashion. Dates, weddings, jobs, births, and plenty of catastrophes – it’s all in this series as Angela visits, or in some cases moves, to each country.\n\nI originally read this series a few years back but having now visited Hollywood and Las Vegas myself, I decided to read them again. I enjoyed them just as much. I have to say that Lindsay Kelk is definitely one of my favourite authors.\n\nThe books can be read as stand-alone stories or you can follow Angela and Co through the whole series. They don’t necessarily have to be read in order, although it’s best if you do. Great fun, very light and easy to read. Give them a whirl.\n\n1. I Heart New York\n\n2. I Heart Hollywood\n\n3. Paris\n\n4. Las Vegas\n\n5. London\n\n6. Christmas\n\n7. Forever\n\n8. Hawaii\n\nThere are also two 2 novellas that focus more on Angela’s crazy best friend Jenny:\n\nJenny Lopez Has A Bad Week\n\nJenny Lopez Saves Christmas\n\nI heart Hawaii – The Grand Finale\n\nThe grand finale to the I heart series is set in both New York and Hawaii.\n\nWe join Angela as she starts work again following the birth of her baby who is now 11 months old. Best friend Jenny Lopez persuades Angela to join her for an all-expenses paid “work” trip to Hawaii. Tag on English best friend Lou, gay best friend and Hollywood actor James, and new boss Paige and what could possibly go wrong?\n\nIn true Angela Clark fashion, she gets herself into several scrapes.\n\nIt’s very funny, fast paced and easy to read. This is exactly why I love Lindsey Kelk’s writing. Perfect holiday reading or a great bit of trip fiction if you’re having a staycation.\n\nIt has a clever ending that leaves you with a warm feeling. There’s an interesting interview at the end of the book with Lindsey. She says its the end of this story, but maybe one day …\n\nAlways The Bridesmaid\n\nIn true Lindsey Kelk fashion, Always The Bridesmaid is very funny. Bride-to-be Lauren asks best friends Sarah and Maddie to be her bridesmaids and presents them with a bridesmaid journal for them to log all the happy moments and feelings on the lead up to the wedding. The story is told through Maddie’ s journal entries.\n\nNeither are that enamoured with the idea of being bridesmaids – Sarah because her husband had just asked her for a divorce, and Maddie because she is single and is ALWAYS the bridesmaid!\n\nAs Maddie is an events planner, Lauren presumes that she will plan her lavish wedding with just three months’ notice.\n\nThe story follows the trials and tribulations of the three friends and Maddie’s new romance as the wedding and other events progress. I didn’t foresee the ending. A brilliant read.\n\nThe Single Girl’s To Do List\n\nThe Single Girl’s To Do List is another cracker from Lindsey Kelk. When Simon breaks up with list-loving Rachel, her friends Em and Matthew set about compiling a Single Girl’s To Do List.\n\nAs you’d expect there are some pretty standard moves to help you get over a break-up, as well as a whole lot more that the trio of friends concocted whilst getting drunk.\n\nThe list comprised of:\n\nA complete makeover of body and home.\n\nExercising.\n\nDoing something extreme such as a bungee jump.\n\nFinding a date for dad’s impending wedding.\n\nDoing something the ex wouldn’t approve of.\n\nBuying something obscenely expensive and selfish.\n\nWriting a closure letter to the ex.\n\nTraveling to a new place abroad.\n\nHunting down the first crush.\n\nBreaking the law.\n\nThe story follows the trio as Rachel works through the list.\n\nA fun story with likable main characters with a bit of on-location travel experience too. I enjoyed this as much as the I heart series.\n\nLindsey Kelk’s Girl Trilogy\n\nAbout a Girl\n\nAbout a Girl is part one in the “Girl” trilogy. Things start to go wrong for Tess Brookes when she loses her job and declares love for her male best friend Charlie. To escape it all, she pretends to be her flatmate Vanessa, and goes off on a work trip to Hawaii. Throw in a handsome lothario, a handful of models, and lots of booze, and what could possibly go wrong?\n\nLots of far fetched fun, some sexy times, and a little bit of romance. If you loved the “I heart” novels, you’ll love this too.\n\nWhat a Girl Wants\n\nWhat a Girl Wants is part two in the Tess Brookes “Girl” series. Now I will admit that it took a while to get into this one and I almost gave up. However, once the characters travel to Milan, it started to get interesting.\n\nIt was great to be reacquainted with characters from book one especially Al and Kekipi. No spoilers though.\n\nA Girl’s Best Friend\n\nA Girl’s Best Friend is the final part of this trilogy and it is written to the usual high standard of Lindsey Kelk novels. This time Tess heads off to New York at Christmas where she gets another shot at being a photographer and another chance at love.\n\nI love that some of the characters from the I heart series appear. Angela, Jenny, Cici, and Delia all feature alongside the great personalities from the Girl series which works really well. Join them on this fabulous journey to see which way Tess’s career and love life end up.\n\nThere’s plenty of slapstick surprises that are written with such clarity, you can picture the events.\n\nDespite not liking book 2 so much, I loved part 1 and 3 and highly recommend the Girl series. The “Girl” trilogy by Lindsey Kelk was part of my 20 Books of Summer reading challenge.\n\nHave you read any books by Lindsey Kelk or similar authors?\n\nWhich ones have been your favourites?\n\nOr have you discovered an author by buying or receiving a book second-hand then gone on to buy the whole back catalogue?\n\nYou can find out more about Lindsey Kelk on her website and social media.\n\nYou may also like to read:\n\n* Author Spotlight with Portia MacIntosh\n\n* Author Spotlight with Jane Fallon\n\n* Author Spotlight with Ali McNamara\n\n* Author Spotlight with Veronica Henry\n\n."
