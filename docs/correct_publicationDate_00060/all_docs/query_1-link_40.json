        "text": "1GardenOfForkingPaths\n\nEdited: Sep 20, 2023, 3:45 pm\n\nThis may be of interest:\n\nThe Wheels of Chance by H.G. Wells from a new-to-me Australian press called Kings Langley Press.\n\nPrice ($115 AUD/$77 USD/€72/£62) and quality seem comparable to a Folio Society book. It features 10 new colour illustrations, 40 black and white illustrations from the first edition, maps of the cycling tour for the endpapers, and a slipcase.\n\nThey're offering free worldwide shipping today, for H.G. Wells' birthday, which prompted me to place an order.\n\nSomeone has done an unboxing and short review on youtube here\n\nNot a novel I've ever read before, but I've enjoyed some of Wells' other non sci-fi works; notably The History of Mr Polly, which was published by FS in 1957.\n\n2Shadekeep\n\nSep 20, 2023, 2:59 pm\n\nThat does sound interesting, a sort of Wellsian version of Three Men on the Bummel. I think I might pick that up as well, thanks! Curious to learn what the next title (a \"new illustrated edition of a famous mystery novel\") will be, too.\n\n3BooksFriendsNotFood\n\nSep 20, 2023, 3:02 pm\n\nThe color illustrations look brilliant!\n\n4Shadekeep\n\nSep 20, 2023, 3:08 pm\n\n>1 GardenOfForkingPaths: As the USD price is only $77 and the shipping free, there really is no reason for me to hesitate. Ordered!\n\n5Dr.Fiddy\n\nSep 20, 2023, 3:33 pm\n\n>1 GardenOfForkingPaths: Thanks for posting this. I've never heard of it either; ordered as well!\n\n6GardenOfForkingPaths\n\nEdited: Sep 20, 2023, 3:44 pm\n\n>3 BooksFriendsNotFood: Yeah, I think so too!\n\n>4 Shadekeep: Free shipping is always a great sweetener! The normal shipping rates weren't actually too bad (under £20 for shipping to the UK, if I remember correctly). I'm curious about the next title too.\n\n>5 Dr.Fiddy: Cool. Hope we all like it!\n\n7davidjbrown10\n\nSep 20, 2023, 7:03 pm\n\n>1 GardenOfForkingPaths: And again thank you—duly ordered. It looks the sort of thing I used to relish ordering from the FS before it went down the Marvel and Martin, etc, path.\n\n8DanielOC\n\nEdited: Sep 20, 2023, 7:37 pm\n\nOrdered, thank you! Looks like a typical FS title from the membership era. My YTD purchases: FS 0, Abe FS 13, Slightly Foxed 4, Kings Langley Press 1.\n\n9emgcat\n\nSep 20, 2023, 8:06 pm\n\n>1 GardenOfForkingPaths:\n\nI have just ordered as well. Thank you for bringing this new press to my attention.\n\n10Charon49\n\nSep 21, 2023, 5:25 am\n\nI have a copy and it’s really great quality for the price point definitely on par with folio.\n\n11vmb443\n\nSep 21, 2023, 7:55 am\n\nThanks for the information. I ordered as well and am interested to see what they come up with in the future. I agree with some of the comments here - reminds me of what would be a Folio Society choice from a few years ago - which is a good thing!\n\n12Tamachan00\n\nEdited: Sep 21, 2023, 11:24 am\n\nYeah I went for this too, having read 3 men in a boat recently.\n\n13vmb443\n\nOct 4, 2023, 5:07 pm\n\nMy copy arrived today. I am very pleased! Came safely packaged, book was shrink wrapped, printed in Slovakia, lovely illustrations (some from the first edition, others newly crates for this edition), bound in cloth with a ribbon marker, paper is thick, maps on endpapers, and nice slipcase. I am excited to see what they publish next - it’s very similar to a classic Folio Society book.\n\n14davidjbrown10\n\nOct 4, 2023, 6:59 pm\n\nMine came a couple of days ago, and I echo all the praise above; just one small cavil—the gilded titling on the spine is a little faint compared to that on the front cover. Otherwise it's everything I hoped for, and am looking forward to an enjoyable read.\n\n15Shadekeep\n\nOct 5, 2023, 7:44 am\n\n>14 davidjbrown10: Still waiting on mine, but I've seen that difference on other books as well. Enough to wonder if there is perhaps a reason for it, such as a difference in printing on the cover versus the spine, or adjustment for the expectation of wear.\n\n16sdawson\n\nEdited: Oct 5, 2023, 9:39 am\n\nThanks folks, missed this thread earlier. Book looks lovely, and while I missed the free shipping, I have placed my order.\n\nThread caught me at a good time, as I just finished watching the wonderful 'Time After Time' movie from 1979. Recalled enjoying it as a teenager when it came out. But had not watched it since. It holds up well all these years later. It's a romantic, time travelling thriller from the 70's; H.G. Wells has to chase down Jack the Ripper who escaped in Well's time machine to 1979 San Francisco. All three main characters are superb -- Malcom McDowel as Herbert, a lovely Mary Steenburgen as his love and guide in modern day, and a sinister David Warner as Jack (who has very strong Professor Severus Snape vibes). As this was 25 years before Harry Potter, it makes me wonder if Alan Rickman took cues from David Warner when he took on the role of Professor Snape.\n\n17davidjbrown10\n\nOct 5, 2023, 1:56 pm\n\n>15 Shadekeep: Agreed: I wonder whether it's something to do with the spine being curved and the cover being flat.\n\n18Tambien\n\nOct 31, 2023, 1:57 am\n\nLooks like they’ve got a pre-order up for a new title! The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins. I haven’t heard of this one before - anyone else read this one?\n\n19wcarter\n\nOct 31, 2023, 2:38 am\n\n>18 Tambien:\n\nIts a very good crime mystery story. The Folio Society published it way back in 1951. See here.\n\nThe Kings Langley release can be seen here.\n\n20DramPan\n\nOct 31, 2023, 7:55 am\n\nI'm excited for their Moonstone! It's a favorite of mine\n\n21Shadekeep\n\nOct 31, 2023, 8:01 am\n\nA couple of fine choices indeed!\n\n22DanielOC\n\nOct 31, 2023, 9:37 am\n\nThe Moonstone pre-order price is 85usd and their email indicates a sale price of 130usd. Significant pre order savings.\n\n23vmb443\n\nOct 31, 2023, 10:10 am\n\nLooks good to me - I’ll put in a pre-order.\n\n24Shadekeep\n\nOct 31, 2023, 12:25 pm\n\nOrdered, looking forward to the next offering as well.\n\n25antinous_in_london\n\nOct 31, 2023, 3:58 pm\n\n>22 DanielOC: With the Wells book they offered free shipping on Wells birthday. Given Collins birthdate is 8th January i’m guessing they may make a similar offer, so if someone is not in a hurry to order it may be possible to take advantage of the pre-order price with the potential additional sweetener of free shipping\n\n26DanielOC\n\nOct 31, 2023, 4:04 pm\n\n>25 antinous_in_london: Yes, smart move. I jumped the gun and pre ordered with a 13 usd (AU to NYC) delivery fee for a 98 usd total.\n\n27elladan0891\n\nOct 31, 2023, 4:06 pm\n\n>1 GardenOfForkingPaths: Thanks for sharing! This looks like a very promising new publisher, picking up exactly where FS left off a few years ago. Not interested in The Moonstone because I already have a very nice, albeit overpriced, AP edition. But for those who don't have a copy of this classic yet and not prepared to pay AP prices, this looks like a solid choice. And twenty color illustrations is a very generous number - more than in a typical comparable FS edition.\n\nThe Wheels of Chance - I'm placing an order.\n\n28elladan0891\n\nOct 31, 2023, 4:10 pm\n\n>24 Shadekeep: looking forward to the next offering\n\nThat will be The Woman in White, designed in series with the upcoming The Moonstone by the same artist. More details to follow early next year:\n\nhttps://kingslangleypress.com/pages/upcoming-publications\n\n29GardenOfForkingPaths\n\nEdited: Oct 31, 2023, 5:36 pm\n\n>27 elladan0891: I hope you like it. Although I haven't read it yet, I'm really pleased with the quality of binding and printing. Text layout is clean and tidy. I can't really fault it. It feels like a FS book with some added value inside.\n\nWith Hand & Eye Letterpress planning an edition of The Woman in White for 2024 too, we're going to be spoilt for choice!\n\n30RRCBS\n\nOct 31, 2023, 8:04 pm\n\nI would def order it if I didn’t have the FS Collin’s set!\n\n31Shadekeep\n\nOct 31, 2023, 9:43 pm\n\n>28 elladan0891: Yes, I saw that announcement too, another one I plan to get. I'm curious about where they might go next. It would be pretty smashing if they picked up a title like Two Years Before The Mast, or something fine and obscure like their first Wells offering.\n\n32Dr.Fiddy\n\nNov 2, 2023, 10:30 am\n\nI think the Collins books will be great, and I would have gotten both if it wasn’t for the newly released Moonstone LE from the Folio Society (which I just ordered) and the upcoming edition of The Woman in White from Hand & Eye.\n\n33A.Nobody\n\nJan 18, 8:42 am\n\nKings Langley announced that their international shipping fees have been reduced, so they are passing the savings on to customers. Here's the breakdown:\n\nUK: £8.00 (previously £18.00)\n\nUS: $9.00 (previously $22.00)\n\nCA: $24.00 (previously $30.00)\n\nEU (selected countries): €11.95 (previously €20.95)\n\nAlso, there's a delay in The Moonstone production: \"We expect to have a definitive production date in the next couple of weeks and will provide another update as soon as everything is confirmed. Although we are still aiming to commence shipping in Q1/24, these delays mean it will likely be towards the end of Q1, specifically by the end of March 2024.\"\n\n34sdawson\n\nJan 18, 10:29 am\n\nWow, that is a huge drop in shipping.\n\n35Shadekeep\n\nJun 25, 8:24 am\n\nThe Wheels of Chance is on sale for 20% off until the end of the month - https://kingslangleypress.com/products/the-wheels-of-chance\n\n36sdawson\n\nJun 25, 10:02 am\n\nThis is a nice production of a lesser known Wells book. I enjoyed it. I am looking forward to \"The Moonstone\". Hoping it comes this fall, and hoping this company continues.\n\n37Pendrainllwyn\n\nJun 25, 11:24 am\n\nI have been keeping an eye on King's Langley's output but haven't purchased yet. I welcome any thoughts on how the quality of a King's Langley edition stacks up against a Folio Society SE. From the KL website they look reasonably similar.\n\n38Shadekeep\n\nJun 25, 12:22 pm\n\n>37 Pendrainllwyn: A dedicated Folio-head could probably give you a better side-by-side, but to me it looks and feels very comparable to FS SE editions. Better than some now, as many of those have switched to paper covers.\n\n40Tambien\n\nJun 27, 1:22 am\n\n>37 Pendrainllwyn: Agreed with everything said in >38 Shadekeep:. Kings Langley is comparable to or slightly better than Folio. Wheels of Chance in particular is delightful, and far more illustrated than most Folios are these days.\n\n41Pendrainllwyn\n\nJun 27, 1:34 am\n\n>40 Tambien: Thank you. I might give Wheels of Chance a go.\n\n42wcarter\n\nJun 27, 2:00 am\n\n>41 Pendrainllwyn:\n\nDo so, it is an excellent and delightful book.\n\n43Shadekeep\n\nJul 16, 9:44 am\n\nJust received notice that The Moonstone is shipping now from Kings Langley."
