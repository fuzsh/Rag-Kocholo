        "text": "Conversation about The Time Machine (his first novel, published in 1895) addressed the idea of future vs. past time-travel. There could be benefits as well as downfalls when considering how to improve life in the present. It could be a good thing to go back and stop horrible things from occurring, but that would certainly have a ripple effect for changing the course of where we are today. It would be a risk we may not want to undertake. As for a glimpse into the future, we may be hesitant to know what will come around each corner. On the other hand, knowing what could come may inspire changes or inventions to meet the unknown.\n\nThe Time Traveler in the Time Machine was aware that things may go wrong, but he was brave enough to test his invention with a trip to the year 802,701. Only the imagination of Wells could ever describe the place this traveler landed. There was a horrible monster-race known as the Morlocks that lived below ground and fed on a childlike population, known as Eloi. A female Eloi, named Weena befriends the traveler and takes him to a museum of sorts that includes such things as matches. With this, the traveler is able to start a fire, distracting the Morlocks, and make his escape. The 1960 film version of this story, starring Rod Taylor as the time traveler, is an entertaining and timeless classic.\n\nIn Wells’ fiction, there are futuristic elements that are commonplace today, supporting his futuristic and progressive visions. His ideas proceed modern aircraft, tanks, space travel, nuclear weapons, satellite television and even the Internet. His social commentary on the times as he knew it then, were prophetic as we look at history and life today.\n\nWells, who suffered from diabetes, was also famous for co-founding the Diabetic Association. What I found most interesting was how Wells was inspired to become a writer. In 1874, while laid up with a broken leg, his father would bring home books from a local library to help him pass the time. Reading about other worlds and lives in books gave him the desire to become a writer.\n\nThe Reading Trap Book Club is currently reading The White Tiger, by Aravind Adiga (b. Oct 23, 1974). This novel comes from the perspective of an impoverished Indian village boy who struggles to overcome a caste system. Copies are available for borrowing and the film version of this book is on Netflix. Conversation about The White Tiger will take place on October 12, at 6:00 p.m. in Traphill Branch Library. A free showing of “Article 15,” a film to complement the theme of Adiga’s novel, takes place at 1:00 p.m. on October 7 at Two Rivers Cinema. We hope you will join us for these special library programs; Keeping it Reel and The Reading Trap. Call 336.818.2818 x 241 for more details."
