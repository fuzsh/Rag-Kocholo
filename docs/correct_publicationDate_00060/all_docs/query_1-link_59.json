Wells’ 1985 comedy The Wheels of Chance, recorded while reading live at The Listening Room in Edloe.\n\nMr Hoopdriver, a draper from Putney, has no idea that his decision to undertake a Cycling Tour for his holiday will land him in such affairs. Runaway girls, gentlemen of Nefarious Bent, famous lady Authors who pen under masculine names, and so on and so forth make up the fabric of poor Hoopdriver’s escapades."
