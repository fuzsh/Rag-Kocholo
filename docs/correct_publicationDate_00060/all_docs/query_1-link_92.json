        "text": "You know I love lists. I’m a listophile. This blog features t a list of 500+ Things that Kids Like, Things They DON’T Like, and a list of over 200 fun, cool and interesting words. List-o-mania! List-o-rama! The lister! (Pretend I’m talking in Rob Schneider’s SNL “annoying office guy” voice.)\n\nToday I invited debut author Darlene Beck Jacobson to the blog to share the Top 10 Toys and Candies of the early 1900’s, the time when times, well, they were a-changin’. It was also the time during her new middle grade novel, WHEELS OF CHANGE! (Don’t you just LOVE that cover?)\n\nTOP TEN TOYS OF 1900-1920\n\nTeddy Bear (1902)—in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt who, on a hunting trip, had an opportunity to kill a bear and didn’t.\n\nErector Set—invented by AC Gilbert, a gold medal Olympian in the 1908 Pole Vault.\n\nLionel Trains (1901)\n\nLincoln Logs (1916)\n\nRaggedy Ann Doll\n\nRadio Flyer Wagon (1917)\n\nTinker Toys (1914)\n\nCrayola Crayons 8 pack (1903)\n\nTin Toys\n\nTiddlywinks\n\nOther popular toys of the time included: Baseball Cards (1900), Ping Pong (1901), Jigsaw Puzzle (1909), Snap Card Game, playing cards, marbles, checkers, chess, yo-yos, wooden tops and (of course) dolls.\n\nLet’s see, what would the top 10 toys of today be? I think Teddy Bears might still have a shot at it. Maybe Crayola crayons, too. But I bet no one back then could envision an app being the most popular toy. (An app? they might say. You mean a tiny apple?)\n\nNow let’s devour the top tasty treats of the era!\n\nPOPULAR CANDY FROM 1900-1920\n\nCandy Corn (1880-s)\n\nJuicy Fruit Gum, Wrigley’s Spearmint Gum (1893)\n\nTootsie Rolls (1896)\n\nHershey’s Milk Chocolate Bar (1900) with Almonds (1908)\n\nNecco Wafers (1901)\n\nConversation Hearts (1902)\n\nBrach Wrapped Caramels (1904)\n\nHershey Milk Chocolate Kisses (1906)\n\nPeppermint Lifesavers (1912)\n\nHmm, I think Hershey would still rank pretty high today. But my kids love Sour Patch and Fun Dip and AirHeads and all kinds of gross things now. Give me a Hershey’s any day (although make it a Cookies-n-Cream bar).\n\nLast night was back-to-school night at my daughter’s elementary, and I’m astounded every year when the principal says, “Our children will be working in fields that haven’t even been invented yet.” That’s how fast things are moving. I’m sure in another hundred years the top toys will be time machines and molecular transporters that will bring the catchphrase “Beam me up, Scotty” back in style.\n\nToday’s world is moving fast, and that tempo is paralleled in WHEELS OF CHANGE with racial intolerance, social change and sweeping progress. It is a turbulent time growing up in 1908. For twelve year old EMILY SOPER, life in Papa’s carriage barn is magic. Emily is more at homehearing the symphony of the blacksmith’s hammer, than trying to conform to the proper expectations of females. Many prominent people own Papa’s carriages. He receives an order to make one for President Theodore Roosevelt. Papa’s livelihood becomes threatened by racist neighbors, and horsepower of a different sort. Emily is determined to save Papa’s business even if she has to go all the way to the President.\n\nSounds exciting, right? IT IS!\n\nAnd guess what, you have yet another chance to win another book! Leave a comment stating what YOU think the #1 toy and #1 candy is right now, in 2014. You have until the last seconds of September 29th to enter. The winner receives WHEELS OF CHANGE."
