        "text": "Start here: Don’t write your book proposal before completing this crucial step.\n\nWe’ll get to everything you need to write a kick-ass book proposal, but there’s something you need to do first.\n\nAnyone can hammer out the sections of a proposal (which I’ll get to in the template below), but before we break down what goes into your proposal, we need to talk about your concept or your “hook.”\n\nThe biggest mistake I see in book proposals—and self-published nonfiction books for that matter—is a flabby concept.\n\nIt’s not enough to write just another book on your topic. No matter how you publish, in order to stand out, you need to understand what has already been published and what makes you and your message special.\n\nWhen I work with a client on their book proposal, I make sure we both think their concept is fresh and utterly brilliant before we start writing the proposal itself.\n\nIf you don’t, you’re wasting your time on busy work just to throw together a bunch of pages that kinda describe a book that you think maybe people will like if you get lucky because it’s all just a crap shoot, right? Wrong.\n\nIf you take the time to develop an irresistible hook or concept, you will:\n\nMaximize your chance of selling your book to publishers\n\nWrite the book way more easily in far less time\n\nShare a meaningful book with the world, a book that matters, rather than just another pile of words that adds to the noise\n\nLet’s make this proposal (and your book!) matter. If you can do these three things—tightly dial in your concept, know how it stands out in the market, and articulate your irresistible hook—then you’ll be able to ensure every part of your proposal works together to convince agents and publishers it simply must be published.\n\nFor instructions on how to do that, download my FREE Book Proposal Blueprint, where I walk you through the exact method I use to help my clients get book deals.\n\nWhat goes into a book proposal?\n\nBook proposals aren’t one-size-fits-all and you may choose to highlight your book’s strengths in a different way, depending on your genre, your format, your personal strengths, or whatever you want. But it’ll really help to keep the proposal’s purpose in mind before you stray from the template and make it your own.\n\nI’ll give you a template in a moment, but first…the purpose of a proposal. However you decide to format your proposal, it should tell publishers 4 things:\n\nWhat’s so great about it\n\nWhy the world needs it and why we need it now\n\nWhy it’s marketable\n\nWhy you’re the one to write it\n\nHow you’re going to get word out\n\n(+ 1-3 sample chapters that prove you can pull it all off)\n\nIn other words, as long as you understand the goal and what they’re expecting to see, write this in any way that shows off your unique genius!\n\nFAQs about proposals\n\nDo I need a book proposal if I’m going to self-publish?\n\nTechnically you don’t need anything at all to self-publish, and you can upload anything you want. But to be successful, I highly recommend creating a modified proposal for your own use. It doesn’t have to be quite as formal, but think of it like opening a restaurant—you wouldn’t do that without a watertight business plan, right?\n\nThere’s a reason publishers want to see a proposal before investing their time and money: The odds of successfully marketing a book (let alone engaging readers once they buy it), are infinitesimally low if you aren’t crystal clear on exactly how your book fits into the market, what makes it (and you) special, how you will create a cohesive book that delivers on your promise, and precisely how you’re going to get it into the hands of readers.\n\nDo I need a book proposal for hybrid publishing?\n\nDepends entirely on the publisher, but I’ll tell you that reputable hybrid publishers definitely want to see a well-conceived plan by an author who knows what they’re doing. More often than not, they’re almost as selective as traditional publishers and you’ll have to stand out from the competition.\n\n(Side note: Before working with any hybrid publisher, make sure they’re legit. Unfortunately there are a lot of scams out there.)\n\nDo I need to read all of the books I use as comps?\n\nNope, not in their entirety. But you should definitely familiarize yourself well enough to know what’s in them, what makes them different from each other, and how you offer something new.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bad news: If you thought you could just throw together a book and wow the world, I’m sorry to disappoint you. Take a look at how many books get published each year—the noise is deafening! The only way to stand out is to offer something unique that readers want and that they want from you.\n\nAlthough, there’s definitely a case for self-publishing, don’t think you can skip the work and self-pub successfully. In fact, if you’re going to get a significant audience with a self-published book, you need an even more solid plan and an even bigger platform because you don’t have the publisher’s resources and reputation behind you.\n\nThe good news: If you’re truly compelled to write this book, I’m willing to bet you have that special sauce. You just need to find it and showcase it!"
