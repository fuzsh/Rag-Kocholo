This volume contains H. G. Wells's early comic novel, ""The Wheels of Chance"". It was written at the peak of the bicycling craze of the late nineteenth-century when practical, comfortable bicycles first became easy and cheap to obtain for the general public. The advent of the personal bicycle saw significant changes in English society, and ushered in a new, exciting age of mobility. These social changes are among the themes explored in this clever and witty tale of young love and adventure - all atop two wheels. Herbert George ""H. G."" Wells (1866 - 1946) was a seminal English writer who is best remembered for his masterful works of science fiction. Many antiquarian texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this volume now in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author. | The Wheels of Chance - A Bicycling Idyll by H G Wells, Paperback | Indigo Chapters
