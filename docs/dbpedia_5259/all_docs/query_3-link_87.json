        "text": "STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Staten Island is no stranger to the mob, whether it be the historical violence on the streets or the setting for iconic scenes in “The Godfather.” There’s no denying that this subgenre of crime storytelling has resulted in the creation of captivating, cinematic classics. Often the protagonists of these films lead lives of violence, acting on allegiances and loyalty to family. Enter the Amazon Prime Video film, “Bless Me Father,” from New Jersey Filmmaker Gianni McLaughlin, 31.\n\nThe film follows Vinny Dapello, a hitman for the New Jersey Italian Mob, who is killing the same man that killed his father. Dapello, portrayed by McLaughlin, confesses his sins and unveils the dirty history of his life. At a critical crossroads, Vinny must decide whether to follow in his father’s footsteps in the crime family or sacrifice his life to save his soul. The film thus explores the moral quandary posing Dapello.\n\nGrowing up an Italian-Irish American in Hoboken, N.J., McLaughlin was raised on the films that came to define Mafia cinema, a genre engrossed in grandeur just as much as violence.\n\n“I just wanted to make a gangster film that’s going to get everybody to want to watch it, but then there’s a moral message at the end of the story, and throughout the story, of not trying to glorify the mob life, and not trying to glorify doing bad things,” McLaughlin said.\n\n“Bless Me Father” was filmed entirely along the Hudson River and the Lincoln Harbor, with most of the picture captured in Hoboken and Jersey City. However, much like “The Godfather,” Staten Island played a fair part in bringing the story to life. McLaughlin’s Staten Island friend lent his boat to be of service, resulting in the scenes shot on the Hudson. Additionally, an array of crew members hailed from the Island.\n\nFive total Staten Islanders took part in the film’s production, including Salvatore Cipriano of Eltingville. Cipriano depicts a Mafia figure toting the shortened moniker, “Sal,” in the movie. Other cast members have familial connections to the borough.\n\nIn the hopes of creating a film with a grounded, authentic feel, McLaughlin opted to use local non-actors for all his roles, many of which are family and friends. Aside from the Italian Mafia classics, McLaughlin feels that too often, many Italian Mafia actors are “blown out of proportion.”\n\n“We didn’t want to do that, we wanted to make this as if you’re watching like a documentary, or you’re watching real life happen...,” McLaughlin said. ”It’s neorealism. My mother is my mother in the movie, and my grandfather is my grandfather. The priest that I confess my sins to is played by my father. If there were somebody else in there, the movie would have never gone to where it was because it got really deep and emotional, and really passionate in that confessional between me and my father.”\n\nHelping bring this vision to life was McLaughlin’s wife, Milly-May, who co-produced and directed the film alongside her husband — a journey of filmmaking that is cinematic in its own right.\n\n“It was a dream come true because I’ve always wanted to be able to be equal with my wife,” McLaughlin said. “I always wanted to be like we can motivate each other, and it’s more than just a loving relationship; it’s a business relationship, and it’s an investment into our future.”\n\nInitially, the couple aimed to have a grand wedding in southern Spain, but the COVID-19 pandemic had other plans. With celebrations derailed, Milly-May suggested they put funds towards producing McLaughlin’s script, his second script following the making of his shorter film, “The Sorrento Job,” a film that served as an opportunity to bring the crew together for work before devoting the time and resources necessary for “Bless Me Father.”\n\nMcLaughlin, who originally sold real estate, was encouraged by his mother to pursue his passion, even registering him for classes. After auditioning for the hit series “Peaky Blinders,” McLaughlin secured a film role as a member of the Italian-American Mafia under the leadership of Luca Changretta, played by Adrien Brody.\n\n“That experience changed my life,’' McLaughlin said. “That’s where I went and met Adrien Brody, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy, and they changed my life. Adrien Brody gave me advice that changed my life.”\n\nBrody’s advice led McLaughlin to return to his hotel room and write out the entire script of “Bless Me Father” that very same night. Upon returning home, the future filmmaker, then 24, quit his job and attended the New York Film Academy, eventually making the film he wrote during that experience.\n\nIt was a vision that would come to earn 12 awards and six nominations. McLaughlin especially noted that the film was awarded best ensemble cast in the New Jersey Film Awards. The film has also snagged other top awards and recognitions at international festivals, including “Best Acting” at the Athens International Art Film Festival.\n\n“For me, it’s all about the team...,” McLaughlin noted. “I’m not saying I don’t care about myself, but I played football my whole life, and I didn’t play tennis my whole life. I played with a team, and it’s not about me; it’s about everybody else. Once everybody else is happy and good, then I could be good.”\n\nMcLaughlin said he looks to continue pursuing this passion and developing more films in the future.\n\n“You’re damn right I’m going to be writing,” McLaughlin said."
