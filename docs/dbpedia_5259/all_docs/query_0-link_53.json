        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Grindstone Entertainment has acquired the North American rights to the crime drama Mob Cops, we’ve learned. A release date will be set in the future.\n\nThe pic directed by Danny A. Abeckaser and written by Kosta Kondilopoulos, is based on true events in mobster crime lore: When the two dirtiest cops in NYPD history pop up on a veteran detective’s radar, he goes on a hunt to discover the truth and bring them to justice. The saga takes place across the 1980s, ’90s, and the year 2005.\n\nIn addition to producing through 2B Films, Abeckaser also stars with David Arquette, Kevin Connolly, Jeremy Luke, Joseph Russo, Montana Tucker, Leila Ben Khalifa, Darren Weiss, Rick Salomon, Mike Young, Christian Paciello, Bo Dietl, Lorenzo Antonucci, Kyle Stefanski, Graham Sibley, Julian Brass, Lynn Adriana Freedman, and Jeffrey Vincent.\n\nAlso producing are Kyle Stefanski and Gusatvo Nascimento of Wild7Films. Pic’s EPs are Eli Wise and Julian Brass.\n\nSays Abeckaser, “I’ve always been fascinated with dirty cop stories, and this one is the biggest in the history of the NYPD – so I was extremely intrigued to turn this into a feature film. Our incredible cast, producing team, and script bring this to life in a dynamic way for audiences. I am equally thrilled to partner again with Grindstone, my partner for The Engineer.”\n\nAbeckaser previously directed, starred in, and produced the successful mob features Mob Town, also starring Arquette; Inside Man, starring Emile Hirsch, which is currently streaming on TUBI; I Love Us; and First We Take Brooklyn. He also had pivotal supporting acting roles in The Irishman and Lansky. His latest film release, The Engineer, starring Emile Hirsch, recently debuted on Netflix and has been trending worldwide."
