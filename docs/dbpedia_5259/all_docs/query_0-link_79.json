        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Director Danny A. Abeckaser (Mob Town) has set the cast for his newest film, the indie Mob Cops, in which he’ll also star. Joining him in prominent roles are David Arquette (Scream franchise), Kevin Connolly (Entourage), Leila Ben Khalifa and Jeremy Luke (The Featherweight).\n\nBased on true events, the film is set in motion when the two dirtiest cops in NYPD history pop up on a veteran detective’s radar, and he goes on a hunt to discover the truth and bring them to justice. Kosta Kondilopoulos wrote the script. Kyle Stefanski and Gustavo Nascimento are producing the pic currently shooting in Los Angeles, with Julian Brass serving as executive producer.\n\nNathaniel Buzolic, Joseph Russo, Montana Tucker, Darren Weiss, Rick Salomon, Mike Young, Christian Paciello, Bo Dietl, Lorenzo Antonucci, Kyle Stefanski, Mike Young, Julian Brass, Graham Sibley, Lynn Adriana Freedman and Jeffrey Vincent Parise round out the cast.\n\nAbeckaser is no stranger to the mob genre, having directed, starred in and produced such features as Mob Town (also starring Arquette), the Emile Hirsch-led Inside Man, I Love Us and First We Take Brooklyn. On the acting front, he’s been seen in supporting roles in titles like The Irishman and Lansky.\n\nSaid the actor-filmmaker in a statement to Deadline, “I’ve always been fascinated with dirty cop stories. And this one is the biggest in the history of the NYPD. So I was extremely intrigued to turn this into a feature film. Our incredible cast, producing team and script, will bring this to life in a dynamic way for the viewer.”\n\nAbeckaser is repped by IAG and LBI Entertainment; Arquette by Innovative Artists, LBI Entertainment and Brecheen Feldman Breimer; Connolly by IAG and LBI Entertainment; and Luke by Luber Roklin, Zero Gravity Management and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman."
