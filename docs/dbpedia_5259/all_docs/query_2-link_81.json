        "text": "Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman is available on Netflix Wednesday.\n\nThe film recounts the life of Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran, and his supposed murder of Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nHere’s a look at what's true and what's not in the movie.\n\nMartin Scorsese’s The Irishman is set to make a bloody splash. Based on the book I Heard You Paint Houses, the 2004 work by prosecutor Charles Brandt, the film is based on the true stories of supposed mafia hitman Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran and his confessed killing of Jimmy Hoffa.\n\nScorsese frames his film using old, wheelchair-bound Sheeran (Robert De Niro). Sheeran recounts his rise from meat-packing WWII vet to confidant and hitman of the Bufalino crime family, an Italian-American crime syndicate active in parts of Pennsylvania. Sheeran’s ascent then takes center stage, and we watch as he meets union leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), becomes his protection, and then later, apparently, murders Hoffa. The end.\n\nWhile Scorsese’s adaptation seems to follow these real-life events closely—or, at least, these real confessions—there are also a spattering of narrative liberties.\n\nHere’s what's true and what's not in The Irishman.\n\nJimmy Hoffa did disappear in 1971\n\nIn July 1975, Jimmy Hoffa, former president of the Teamsters’ union, disappeared. Hoffa had by then served out a prison sentence for jury tampering. He maintained dubious financial connections with the Bufalino crime family and had been charged with fraud after using union pension funds as loans to organized crime members. Hoffa’s prison sentence had been commuted, however, and he was released in 1971. Back on the street, Hoffa tried to regain control over the union, angering organized crime families. And then he disappeared.\n\nFrom left to right: Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), and Ray Romano (Bill Bufalino)\n\nWhich was about as much as anyone knew. That is, until a man considered just another low-bit mobster, Sheeran, took credit for the killing in 2003. He also took credit for other killings. Because, hey, why not.\n\nBut there's some doubt around Sheeran's confession\n\nSheeran's confession may be where The Irishman is spinning yarns. Many people, including former Irish mob leaders, FBI agents, and persecutors, doubt Sheeran was capable of killing anyone. And after Sheeran “confessed” to the crimes, not even the police bothered to charge or arrest him.\n\nSheeran continues to be held as nothing more than a union thug, someone who, at worst, ordered the killings of union rivals. Still, Sheeran’s confession offered both a nice explanation for Hoffa’s disappearance, as well as an exciting story to go along with it.\n\nIn dramatizing Sheeran’s words, Scorsese likely isn’t conceding to his account, and viewers are encouraged to take his testimony with a lot of proverbial salt. Part of what will make the film interesting is how well De Niro (as Sheeran) sells his tale. But be warned: nothing he says has been verified.\n\nFrank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran\n\nPolice aren't sure who killed Hoffa\n\nA common telling of Hoffa's murder goes something like this: After his release from prison, Hoffa started pissing off the mob, particularly Anthony Provenzano, who had taken over for Hoffa as head of the Teamsters union in Union City, New Jersey. Provenzano then arranged the killing with the help of the Detroit mob. Provenzano’s man, Salvatore Briguglio pulled the trigger. Sheeran merely rode with Hoffa in a car to calm his nerves.\n\nSheeran, however, claimed that the Bufalino family organized the killing, and that it was he himself who carried it out, shooting Hoffa in an abandoned house.\n\nBut again, many journalists, investigators, and FBI agents, reject Sheeran’s claims. They also reject his other supposed confessions, including the killing of Joe Gallo. In a recent interview with Slate, Nicholas Gage, a New York Times reporter at the time of the killing, said “I haven’t read the script of The Irishman, but the book on which it is based is the most fabricated mafia tale since the fake autobiography of Lucky Luciano.”\n\nWhich is to say the source material for The Irishman could be just a bunch of malarkey. And maybe that's Scorsese's point."
