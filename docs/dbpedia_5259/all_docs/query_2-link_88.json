        "text": "The film Bugsy, released in 1991, based on Dean Jennings’ 1967 book We Only Kill Each Other, depicts the life of Bugsy Siegel. The film looks beautiful and it’s always nice to see 1940s Los Angeles recreated, but like the source material itself, it is rather loose with the facts. No one expects a documentary, but if films use real historical figures and supposed real-life events, they really shouldn’t bend the truth. Better to just change the names and have it be fictional, as in the 1950 film noir 711 Ocean Drive.\n\nThe biggest deviations from the truth are in the timeline of events. Some characters are sort of melded with real-life persons and fictionalized. And the motive for the murder, presented as truth, is really only speculation. It’s a 1991 film but nevertheless, if anyone hasn’t seen it you are hearby warned that spoilers follow!\n\nThe film opens in Winter of what is apparently c. 1940-1941 with Siegel leaving the wife and kids behind while he makes a brief trip to Los Angeles to take over the gambling rackets of Jack Dragna.\n\nAs I wrote in my previous post, Bugsy Siegel in LA Pt. 1, Siegel had made at least two known trips to LA with Esta and family in the early 1930s. The California Crime Commission, formed by Governor Earl Warren in October 1947 as a result in part of the Siegel murder, would later state that he settled in LA with his family full time in 1937.\n\nSeeing Siegel off on the train are Charles Luciano and Meyer Lansky, Joey Adonis, etc. These are real persons. However, Luciano at this time was in New York state prison serving time for his 1936 conviction for compulsory prostiution. Harry Greenberg approaches Siegel to ask for more money, implying that he may “sing” if he doesn’t get it. In real life, “Big Greenie” was murdered in Hollywood in November 1939. This character seems to be a blend of Greenbaum and Abe Relles, another Murder Inc. hitman, who had turned informant. See my previous post on Greenberg.\n\nThe “boys” remind Bugsy that Dragna “has been running the California rackets for 20 years with no competition.” “Except for Mickey Cohen.”\n\nDragna had come to LA from New York in 1914 after being suspected in the murder of “chicken king” Baret Baff. He did time in California’s San Quentin prison for “Black Hand” style extortion and was extradited to New York in 1917 where he served time in prison for the Baff murder. He returned to LA in 1919 and worked for Italian crime boss Joe Ardizzone. He took over for Ardizzone after Ardizzone’s mysterious vanishing on October 15, 1931 and around 1933, according to LAPD records compiled for the Crime Commission, muscled in on the gambling rackets of LA’s non-Italian underworld boss Guy McAfee. In a similar fashion, McAfee took over the rackets of his former boss, Charles Crawford, who was murdered in his Sunset Boulevard office along with journalist Herbert Spencer in May 1931.\n\nCohen’s importance is likewise overstated. Mostly because information on Cohen comes from Cohen himself and biographers accept his version of events as fact. In reality, Cohen was Siegel’s hired muscle and bagman. The Crime Commission wrote in its third report of January 31, 1950 that the importance of Cohen was “minimal” during Siegel’s lifetime.\n\nThe US Senate Crime Committee later agreed. The committee chair Sen. Estes Kefauver opined that while Cohen was involved in a lot of matters, he was no “big shot” on a national scale and “pretty far down the line” even among West Coast racketeers.\n\nSo Bugsy arrives in LA where he is picked up at Union Station by his actor pal George Raft.\n\nUnion Station opened in 1939, replacing several older railroad stations. Read my post on the earlier stations here.\n\nThey drive to the studio (presumably Warner Brothers in Burbank) where George is filming the movie Manpower with Marlene Dietrich. Manpower, which also starred Edward G. Robinson, was a real movie, release in Los Angeles in July 1941. Siegel meets Virginia Hill on the set in 1991’s Bugsy. Hill does have a bit part in the film. She plays a hatcheck girl and is costumed in a black uniform, not a fancy gown like Annette Benning’s Virginia Hill wears in Bugsy.\n\nAfterward, George is driving Siegel through Beverly Hills to his hotel when Siegel asks him to stop at the home of opera singer Lawrence Tibbett. Siegel hands Tibbett a pile of cash for the home and buys it on the spot. In reality, the Siegel family may have rented the Tibbett abode for a brief time. However, Tibbett was no longer its resident at the time. Born in 1896, he was also younger than his fictional counterpart.\n\nTibbett’s house that the Siegels rented was at 933 N. Rexford Drive. Strangely, it was next door to the residence of the late Charles Crawford, who had lived at 929 N. Rexford Drive. Tibbett and his first wife Grace bought 933 N. Rexford in October 1929 when Tibbett was making movies for MGM. The couple publicly separated in July 1931 and Lawrence Tibbett moved out.\n\nThe house used in 1991’s Bugsy as Tibbett’s home is not 933 N. Rexford Drive. It is located in Pasadena.\n\nBy October 1937, Siegel was building a large home for his family on Delfern Drive in exclusive Holmby Hills. It was completed in 1938 and occupied by the family until Ben and Esta Siegel separated in 1944. See my previous post, Bugsy Siegel In Los Angeles Pt. II.\n\nIn the film, Siegel then meets with Jack Dragna at his home to discuss Siegel taking over his bookmaking operations. Accounts of Siegel’s takeover are sketchy and unreliable at best. However, it’s clear that in 1937 Siegel with Dragna’s grudging help was squeezing out the Guy McAfee/ Tutor Scherer/ Farmer Page/ Zeke Caress LA mob. The attempted and ultimately successful murder of Les Bruneman, a one-time henchman of Farmer Page’s in Page’s bootleg Trust days, is likely also related. At the same time, the citizen-led reform effort of CIVIC and cafeteria owner Clifford Clinton was underway. My previous post on that can be found here. By June 1939 McAfee et al had showily decamped for Las Vegas (though they retained underworld ties to LA) ostensibly due to new mayor Fletcher Bowron’s reform policies. While that may have been part of it, it was widely hinted at the time that they had been squeezed out by a new man in town: Siegel.\n\nIn Bugsy, Siegel is in with the Hollywood crowd, hanging out at Ciro’s on the Sunset Strip, pursuing Virginia Hill and rubbing elbows with the American Italian countess by marriage, Dorothy di Frasso. Dorothy di Frasso was a real person. She and Siegel had made a strange and ill-fated sea voyage together in 1938.\n\nCiro’s was opened by Billy Wilkerson at 8433 Sunset Boulevard on January 30, 1940. A society column about Siegel from the Los Angeles Examiner (a real paper at that time) is fictional. It reads “Gangster or Star? Rackets King in Social Swirl” and refers to Siegel as “the ever dapper Bugsy Siegel.” “I’m a sportsman,” Siegel is quoted as saying in the piece. The Examiner was ahead of other local papers in exposing sportsman Siegel as a New York racketeer. The Crime Commission later wrote a blistering admonishment of how easily the gangster was taken under Hollywood’s wing.\n\nOne issue with the fictional timeline in the film: this article is dated January 4, 1945! Later in the film, Cohen reads an article dated 1944.\n\nIn the film, at Ciro’s, Siegel is seen talking to DA “James McWilde” who is up for relection. Siegel expresses a desire to contribute to the campaign and McWilde refers him to his aid to arrange a donation. LA had no DA McWilde. The DA from 1928 to 1940 was Buron Fitts. Fitts was finally defeated by John F. Dockweiler in November 1940. Siegel was in jail on murder charges at the time. He did make a donation to the campaign of Dockweiler, who would now be in charge of Siegel’s case. Dockweiler, however, was not corrupt and could not be bought. Really. When he learned of the donation, he returned it. The LA mob wanted to get rid of Dockweiler in the worst way. See my post on Mumsie McGonigle, here. Dockweiler, though a young man, died in office on January 31, 1943. Fred N. Howser, who much more to the underworld’s liking, was appointed to replace him on February 2, 1943.\n\nIn the film, Jack Dragna calls Siegel to report that Mickey Cohen had just held up Dragna’s Franklin Street bookie joint for $56,000. Siegel drives over there. The location he visits, pretty faithfully recreated here, is Vine Street, however, not Franklin.\n\nIn this scene, Bugsy observes a “Back the Attack” war bond rally going on across the street from Dragna’s bookie joint. “Back the Attack” was the real slogan of the 1943 war bond drive, which kicked off in September of that year.\n\nAs for the robbery, Cohen described the incident. It’s his version of events. The way the film depicts him, as a near-equal to Siegel, is not accurate as noted above. In the bar meeting of Cohen and Siegel, Cohen mentions he dates stars like Ava Garder or Betty Grable. George Raft, whose fictional counterpart lets this remark pass without comment, dated Betty Grable in real life. In his “as told to” memoir, Cohen describes holding up a gambling joint run by the LA mob’s Eddie Nealis. Grable was present but as Cohen tells it, he didn’t recognize her. See my post about this robbery, here.\n\nIn the film, Virginia Hill, Siegel and Cohen go to Las Vegas. The depiction of Vegas as a sleepy berg with dirt streets and run-down casino is a far cry from reality. Wartime Las Vegas was booming. Siegel’s LA rivals, Guy McAfee, Tutor Scherer and Farmer Page, had established legitimate casinos downtown on Fremont Street by 1942. Siegel’s interest in Las Vegas was related to the race wire. Nevada had legalized off-track betting in 1941. Any Las Vegas casino that wanted to offer betting on horse races had to subscribe to the Siegel-controlled race wire. Moe Sedway (who has a fictional counterpart in Bugsy) fronted for Siegel in this venture. See my previous post on the race wire situation.\n\nOn the return trip to LA, Bugsy’s Siegel has a vision in the deserted desert of building an oasis- a resort hotel casino. Great idea! Only Tommy Hull thought of it first. He opened El Rancho Vegas, the first hotel on what later became the Las Vegas Strip, in April 1941. My previous post on El Rancho Vegas can be found here. The second hotel on the Strip was the Last Frontier, built on the site of a previous club owned by Guy McAfee. There were also numerous small motels, nightclubs and restaurants along this stretch of what was then Highway 91.\n\nAs the film continues, Siegel and Cohen are seen at Union Station with Siegel departing for New York to “visit” Esta and ask for a divorce. Cohen is reading the LA Times, a headline story about “Un-lucky” Luciano and stoolie Harry Greenberg. “Greenie canery sings Charlie into his cage.” The date reads March 30, 1944.\n\nIn real life, Luciano had been in prison since 1936 (and Harry Greenberg had nothing to do with that). Harry Greenberg was killed in November 1939. Greenberg had been demanding money for his silence in the 1930s when New York’s “gangbuster” Thomas Dewey was prosecuting Murder, Inc. boss Louis (Lepke) Buchalter for labor racketteering, then went on the lam. Another “stoolie,” Abe Relles, who was in a position to convict both Siegel and Buchalter for Greenberg’s murder, had “fallen” out of a window in 1941. The Luciano character in Bugsy seems to be a meld of Luciano and Buchalter, though the time-frame still doesn’t work.\n\nIn real life, as noted earlier, Esta and the girls lived with Siegel in Beverly Hills.\n\nOn returning to LA, he finds Virginia’s brother Chick visiting. Chick Hill was an actual person. Siegel puts Hill in charge of planning the Flamingo.\n\nThe role of former Ciro’s owner Billy Wilkerson in the Flamingo operation isn’t mentioned. Del Webb, the contractor depicted in the film, was a real person. The original name of the project was The Flamingo Club.\n\nIn this scene, Siegel is reading the LA Times newspaper about the murder of Italian dictator, Beinito Mussolini, which occurred on April 28, 1945. The headline and photo have been changed, but the paper shown in the film is the actual LA Times front page from April 30, 1945. The adjacent stories are actual articles published that day.\n\nAs the film continues, Harry Greenberg arrives at Siegel’s house in a taxi. Siegel takes him for a ride. In real life, as noted previously, Harry Greenberg was murdered in November 1939 while sitting in his car parked out in front of his house. He’s been hiding out from Siegel and the New York mob- he certainly wouldn’t seek out Siegel! His presence in Hollywood was inadvertantly exposed by the LA Times, when it ran a human-interest story about the chance meeting of Greenberg’s wife and her long-lost sister at the corner of Hollywood and Vine- conveniently listing Greenberg’s address in the piece. As Siegel is seen reading the paper so often in Bugsy, this would have been a fabulous and more true to life scene to recreate- though problematic since Bugsy’s Harry Greenberg is sort of a combo of both Harry Greenberg and Abe Relles and therefore could not be both the murder victim and witness who could link Siegel to said murder.\n\nThe film’s Siegel goes back to New York to attend a “deportation party” for Charlie Luciano and while there he and Esta call it quits.\n\nThomas Dewey, who had successfully prosecuted Luciano in 1936, was elected governor of New York in 1943 and in 1945 commuted Luciano’s sentance, ostensibly in exchange for Luciano’s wartime behind the scenes assistance to the Allies. The film timeline is mixed up here. Mussolini’s death was in April 1945. Luciano was deported on February 10, 1946. His “bon voyage” party in New York coincides with Siegel and Esta agreeing to divorce as well as the Japanese surrender. The latter occurred August 14, 1945. The Siegels agreed to separate in June 1944 and it was at that time that Esta and the girls moved back to New York.\n\nBack on the Coast, with the war over, contruction is underway on the Flamingo. In real life, constuction began, to some extent, in December 1945. But with building materials in short supply and a high priority for veterans’ housing, non-essential building was soon halted by the Civilian Production Administration (CPA), the successor to the War Production Board, created in October 1945. Read more about the CPA in my previous posts here and here. Siegel wrangled with the CPA and at one point constuction was halted while a hearing was held on the matter in San Francisco. Ultimately, the Flamingo was given the go-ahead to proceed.\n\nIn the film, Federal Marshals arrive at the construction site to arrest Siegel for the murder of Harry Greenberg. In reality, Siegel was charged in Big Greenie’s murder on August 16, 1940 at his Delfern Drive mansion, let go, and arrested again on October 10, 1941.\n\nIn the film, the taxi driver who brought fictional Harry to Siegel’s house is a key witness and is spirited out of town (with help from Cohen and the corrupt DA) so he can’t testify. In reality there was no taxi driver. The key witness was Abe Relles, who “fell” out of his window, never to sing again. Another witness, Al Tannenbaum, testified to Siegel’s personal involvement in Greenberg’s murder- but as a con-conspirator, Tannenbaum’s testimony alone could not convict and Siegel was indeed let off “scot-free” as the movie depicts. That much was true.\n\nAlso true was the special treatment Siegel received while in the County Jail awaiting trial. He had meals delivered from Ciro’s and the jail doctor, a pal he met at Countess di Frasso’s, Dr. Benjamin Blank, allowed Siegel out of jail for supposed medical reasons as many as 18 times. It’s unlikely Hill really joined him in his cell for dinner, but on one of his visits to the outside, he was spotted having lunch at Lindy’s on Wilshire Boulevard with actress Wendy Barrie.\n\nFreed, it’s full steam ahead for the Flamingo, which Bugsy told reporters is opening Christmas Day. To raise cash, he sells his house and the contents. In fact, Siegel did put Delfern Drive on the market – in June 1944- after Esta moved back to New York. (Her divorce was granted in Reno in August 1946).\n\nThe filmmakers did a great job recreating 1946’s Flamingo casino building (the seperate hotel structure isn’t shown). The Flamingo vertical sign, however, capped by a neon Flamingo, is not the signage that existed in Siegel’s lifetime. It is actually the second sign, added circa 1948-1949. The original sign, shown below, was a pylon with neon on either side. The highway frontage sign also appears to be one that was added later c. 1948-1949.\n\nMeanwhile, the film has Cohen warning Bugsy that Virginia has a Swiss bank account with $2 million in it. The exiled Luciano, still running the outfit from afar, has gathered the “boys” in Cuba for a meeting at the Hotel Nacional to complain about Siegel’s cost overruns for the Flamingo. Lansky advocates giving him a chance to make good. Uh-oh.\n\nIt’s the Flamingo’s opening night, December 25, 1946. It’s a bust. No patrons in sight. The celeb guests are no-shows, grounded by a terrible rain storm. Virginia is absent- having fought with Siegel after he confronted her about the $2 million. Siegel announces on the spot that the casino is shutting down temporarily.\n\nOk. In real life, the Flamingo had a 3-day gala opening December 26, 27, and 28 1946. Virginia was there (as was Billy Wilkerson) with a different hair color and fabulous designer gown for each evening. It was well attended by locals (including rival Guy McAfee and his former starlet wife June Brewster who broke the bank) and some celebs. Critics wrote glowingly of the fabulous decor, comparing it to a Hollywood movie set. (Also the rainstorm that some celebs used as an excuse not to come was in Los Angeles). Financially it was a bust. The hotel portion of the resort was not yet open. The casino continued in business for a few weeks, then it shut down, reopening n March 1947.\n\nAs the movie winds to a close, Virginia and Siegel make up. She admits to skimming the $2 million and offers to give it back. Siegel tells her to hang on to it. He flies back to LA that very evening, Christmas night, for a meeting with the boys. Cohen, who was at the opening in Las Vegas, somehow beats him to LA, and drives him to Virginia’s house. While reading the newspaper, he is gunned down through the window by multiple assailants and collapses on Virginia’s floral couch.\n\nAs everyone knows, in real life, Siegel was killed on June 20, 1947. He was not alone. Pal Al Smiley was next to him on the couch and Chick Hill and his girlfriend (Virginia’s former secretary) were upstairs at the time.\n\nSiegel’s death indeed took place at Virginia Hill’s rented house, which was located at 810 N. Linden Drive. It’s not the house depicted in the film.\n\nIn the film, Moe Sedway and Gus Greenbaum arrive at the Flamingo to announce they’re taking over and tell Virginia of Siegel’s death. They did arrive the same day as the murder and took over. However, Hill was Paris at the time of Siegel’s death. The film ends by telling us Virginia gave the $2 million back to Lansky and also informs us she died by suicide in Austria. Which she did- in 1966. There’s no evidence that she stole money or that the Flamingo finances was the motive for Siegel’s execution. The race wire is a more likely scenario, but a less romantic one.\n\nA select Siegel timeline 1936-1947\n\n1936\n\nJan 18 New head of the State Board of Equalization (SBE) recommends yanking the Clover Club’s license over gambling.
