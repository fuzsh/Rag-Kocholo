        "text": "We lost a lot of bad men this summer, as fans of mobster movies will know all too well. In the wake of the sudden death of 67-year-old Goodfellas star Ray Liotta, we lost the inimitable James Caan, swaggering he-man of ‘70s Hollywood and Sonny Corleone in The Godfather, then Tony Sirico, the unforgettable supporting actor and real-life ex-con who played beloved character Paulie ‘Walnuts’ Gualtieri in The Sopranos; finally, the veteran actor Paul Sorvino, who among his many talents played the role of Paulie in Goodfellas.\n\nThese veterans passing can’t help but to underline the ageing out of a particular type of actor, and along with them a particular type of film from American cinema, posing the question: where next for the mobster flick?\n\nCentral to the appeal of these actors was a streetwise authenticity that made them feel so real. Paul Sorvino was of a gentle, artistic temperament, but he was still an Italian-American born and raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn alongside the same quiet but menacing mobsters he often played. James Caan was the son of a butcher, fighting neighbourhood boys in the Bronx with cue balls in a sock. Ray Liotta, notoriously intimidating, bust the gate wide open in his first major role as a volatile newly-released jailbird in Something Wild; he had a knack for playing psychopaths. And Tony Sirico, the most ‘authentic’ of the bunch, had a rap sheet featuring assault, extortion and robbery. So committed was he to being a true mafia man that the actor demanded that whatever character he played on The Sopranos never ‘be a rat’, or he wouldn’t do the part.\n\nWhile these men had singular styles and paths to Hollywood, they still had a startling amount in common, even beyond their tough guy personas. Each came from the ethnic American enclaves (Italian, Jewish, and Irish) of the tri-state area: Liotta was from New Jersey, Caan from the Bronx, and both Sirico and Sorvino came from the same neighbourhood in Brooklyn. Liotta grew up working part-time for his dad’s auto supply shop; Caan driving a meat delivery truck; Sirico described his neighbourhood as a place where “you either had to have a tattoo or a bullet hole” to prove yourself. Yes, some of them went to college, or studied acting in some respect, but crucially, none were from cosy backgrounds. Each either participated in or witnessed the behaviour of the types of people they would later play, not so much via the Method school as the school of hard knocks. And each, with a downturned grin or a cutting sideways look, could strike fear into the hearts of the bravest amongst us. Think of Paul Sorvino, as Paulie in Goodfellas, when his lackey Henry (Liotta) takes the witness stand against him. His silent, bury-you-alive glare would stop anyone selling him down the river.\n\nWithout their combined menace and idiosyncrasies, the great age of the screen gangster is looking down the barrel at an uncertain future. As it turns out, it’s another Martin Scorsese film that provides the best swansong for the loss of actors like these. In 2019’s The Irishman, the cast is a veritable who’s-who of crime genre stalwarts of the past half-century: Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino among them, all heavily-lined and ageing out of the firecracker toughs they played in their youths. The film itself is in part a meditation on the death of the mobster movie. A slow fade into unglamorous old age shows us exactly where these movies – and sadly, the actors that made them sing – are going.\n\nThe mob movie did try its luck again last year, with James Gandolfini’s son playing a younger version of his father’s most iconic role in Sopranos prequel, The Many Saints of Newark. It was an exciting premise, not least the prospect of seeing a youthful version of Tony Soprano made in the image of his own son, but the film indulged in hollow nostalgia for the original TV series and little beyond. A similar story surrounded the release of The Offer in June, where the Paramount series about the making of The Godfather cashed in on prestige of the beloved Francis Ford Coppola films but failed to meaningfully build on what fans already knew. Rounding out a trilogy of nostalgic mobster projects, there's also the forthcoming Francis and the Godfather, about the director facing off against producer Robert Evans while making the titular movie, and starring Oscar Isaac, Elisabeth Moss and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nGiven this backward-facing outlook, it might be that the genre is in need of reinvention, and for the mobster movie to move forward it needs to offer more than a fix of nostalgia and instead tell stories that speak to new fans as much as committed devotees. In this way, the trajectory of another genre, the murder mystery, might hold some answers for where the mobster movie could go. The whodunit was another genre that seemed on its last legs until the string of starry reimaginings that have come in recent years. While Kenneth Brannagh’s Poirot franchise has been underwhelming, Rian Johnson’s excellent Agatha Christie nod in 2019 film Knives Out shows that it’s possible to take the farcical elements of a genre and spin it into something fresh. This year will see the release of a trio of awaited detective dramas in See How They Run, Amsterdam and Knives Out 2, suggesting we could be in the midst of a new golden age for crime flicks.\n\nWhile the classic mobster flick doesn’t have the same hold on cinema it once did, you can still see traces of it in cinema today if you look carefully. Take Joaquin Phoenix’s brooding, eccentric turn in Lynne Ramsay’s masterful hitman film You Were Never Really Here, where part of the film’s intrigue is how it focuses on the cycles of violence within one man rather than a broader crime infrastructure. It’s clear that the enduring power of the mob movie still has its fingerprints on film and TV today if you look carefully, and the outpouring of love and grief for Caan, Liotta, Sirico and Sorvino has shown that while the old era might be as good as buried, the appetite for a new one is still strong."
