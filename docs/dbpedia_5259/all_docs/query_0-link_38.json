        "text": "Bronx-born and raised Chazz Palminteri was a natural choice to continue the Italianate torch in film. In the tradition set forth in the 1970s by such icons as director Martin Scorsese and actors Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, John Cazale and Joe Pesci, Palminteri has brought grit, muscle and an evocative realism to the sidewalks of his New York neighborhood, violent as they are and were.\n\nChazz was born Calogero Lorenzo Palminteri in 1952 in the Bronx, New York, the son of Rose, a homemaker, and Lorenzo Palminteri, a bus driver. He grew up in a tough area of the Bronx, giving him the life lessons that would later prove very useful to his career. He graduated from Theodore Roosevelt High School and started out pursuing his craft in 1973 studying at the Actor's Studio. He appeared off-Broadway in the early 1980s while paying his dues as a bouncer and doorman in nightclubs, among other jobs.\n\nIn 1986 he headed west and found that his ethnic qualifications was well-suited for getting tough-talker parts. Slick attorneys, unflinching hoods and hard-nosed cops were all part of his ethnic streetwise persona in such TV shows as Kampf gegen die Mafia (1987), Matlock (1986) and Polizeirevier Hill Street (1981). In films he started off playing a 1930s-style gangster in Sylvester Stallone's Oscar - Vom Regen in die Traufe (1991). Although his roles were sharp, well-acted and with a distinct edge to them, there was nothing in them to show that he was capable of stronger leading parts.\n\nIn 1988 he wrote for himself a play entitled \"A Bronx Tale,\" a powerful one-man stage commentary in which he depicted his bruising childhood in great detail, which included witnessing gangland slayings. Palminteri brought each and every character to life (18 in all) in this autobiographical piece -- his friends, enemies, even his own family. He showcased for years in both Los Angeles and New York, finally sparking the interest of his film idol, Robert De Niro. DeNiro, wanting to direct for the first time, saw the potential of this project and brought both it and the actor/writer to the screen. Palminteri played one of the flashier roles, Sonny, a gangster, in the movie version. An unknown film commodity at the time, Chazz had stubbornly refused to sell his stage property (the offers went into the seven figures) unless he was part of the package as both actor and screenwriter. DeNiro, who became his mentor, backed him up all the way, and the rest is history. In den Straßen der Bronx (1993), which featured his actress/producer/wife Gianna Palminteri, earned strong reviews.\n\nAt age 41 Palminteri had become an \"overnight\" star. Other important projects quickly fell his way. He received a well-deserved Oscar nomination the following year for his portrayal of a Runyonesque hit man in Woody Allen's hilarious jazz-era comedy Bullets Over Broadway (1994). He was on the right side of the law in both Die Perez Familie (1995), his first romantic lead, and then the classic crimer Die üblichen Verdächtigen (1995). He played the ill-fated brute in Diabolisch (1996) and wrote a second screenplay, Der Hochzeitstag (1996), in which he again plays a hit man, terrorizing both Cher and Ryan O'Neal.\n\nThough Palminteri was invariably drawn into a rather tight-fitting, often violent typecast, it has been a secure and flashy one that continues to run strong into the millennium. Surprisingly, the one obvious show he missed out on was HBO's Die Sopranos (1999). True to form his trademark flesh-lipped snarl was spotted in gritty urban settings playing a \"Hell's Kitchen\" cop in Hell's Kitchen (2001) starring actor/producer Armand Assante; a pool hustler and mentor in Poolhall Junkies (2002); a mob boss in In the Fix (2005); a dirty cop in Running Scared (2006); the titular scam artist as Yonkers Joe (2008); a karaoke-loving Italian psychiatrist in Once More with Feeling (2009); and an abusive husband and father in Mighty Fine (2012).\n\nOther millennium filming includes starring presences in Der Bodyguard - Für das Leben des Feindes (2007), The Dukes (2007), the title conman as Yonkers Joe (2008), Once More with Feeling (2009) and Mighty Fine (2012), as well as prime supports in Running Scared (2006), Kids in den Straßen New Yorks (2006), Push (2006), Jolene (2008), Last I Heard (2013), Legend (2015), Vault (2019), Clover (2020). TV crime continues to occupy his time as well, clocking in such series' credits as Kojak (2005), Rizzoli & Isles (2010) and Godfather of Harlem (2019). Occasionally he will lighten up -- as in his recurring role as Shorty on the popular sitcom Modern Family (2009).\n\nCompact Italian-American actor Joe Pesci was born February 9, 1943 in Newark, New Jersey, to Mary (Mesce), a part-time barber, and Angelo Pesci, a bartender and forklift driver. Pesci first broke into entertainment as a child actor, and by the mid-1950s, was starring on the series \"Star Time Kids\". In the mid-1960s, he released a record under the stage name Joe Ritchie titled \"Little Joe Sure Can Sing\", and was also playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and The Starliters. He even joined with his friend Frank Vincent to start a vaudeville-style comedy act, but met with limited success (interestingly, Pesci and Vincent would later go on to co-star in several gangster films together, including GoodFellas - Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990) and Casino (1995).\n\nPesci's first film role was as an uncredited dancer in Twist... das die Röcke fliegen (1961) and then he had to wait another 15 years for a minor role in Blutiger Zahltag (1976). His work in the second film was seen by Robert De Niro, who convinced director Martin Scorsese to cast him as Joey LaMotta in the epic boxing film Wie ein wilder Stier (1980), which really got him noticed in Hollywood. He played opposite Rodney Dangerfield in Monty, der Millionenerbe (1983), was with buddy DeNiro again in Es war einmal in Amerika (1984), nearly stole the show as con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 2 - Brennpunkt L.A. (1989) and scored a Best Supporting Actor Oscar playing the psychotic Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas (1990).\n\nHis comedic talents shone again in the mega-popular Kevin - Allein zu Haus (1990), and he put in a terrific performance as co-conspirator David Ferrie in JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991). Pesci was back again as Leo Getz for Lethal Weapon 3: Die Profis sind zurück (1992), and was still a bumbling crook in Kevin - Allein in New York (1992), and had a minor role in the Robert De Niro-directed In den Straßen der Bronx (1993). He was lured back by Scorsese to play another deranged gangster named Nicky (based on real-life hood Tony Spilotro [aka \"The Ant\"]) in the violent Casino (1995), and starred in the comedies Kopflos - 8 Köpfe im Koffer (1997) and Der $100.000 Fisch (1997), although both failed to fire at the box office.\n\nPesci returned again as fast-talking con man Leo Getz in Lethal Weapon 4 - Zwei Profis räumen auf (1998). In 1999, he announced his retirement from acting and since then, he appeared only occasionally in films, including a cameo appearance in Der gute Hirte (2006). He also appeared in the music documentary I Go Back Home: Jimmy Scott (2016).\n\nSylvester Stallone is an athletically built, dark-haired American actor/screenwriter/director/producer, the movie fans worldwide have been flocking to see Stallone's films for over 40 years, making \"Sly\" one of Hollywood's biggest-ever box office draws.\n\nSylvester Stallone was born on July 6, 1946, in New York's gritty Hell's Kitchen, to Jackie Stallone (née Labofish), an astrologer, and Frank Stallone, a beautician and hairdresser. His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother's heritage is half French (from Brittany) and half German. The young Stallone attended the American College of Switzerland and The University of Miami, eventually obtaining a B.A. degree. Initially, he struggled in small parts in films such as the soft-core Randy - Die Sexabenteuer des Sylvester Stallone (1970), the thriller Klute (1971) and the comedy Bananas (1971). He got a crucial career break alongside fellow young actor Henry Winkler, sharing lead billing in the effectively written teen gang film Brooklyn Blues - Das Gesetz der Gosse (1974). Further film and television roles followed, most of them in uninspiring productions except for the opportunity to play a megalomaniac, bloodthirsty race driver named \"Machine Gun Joe Viterbo\" in the Roger Corman-produced Frankensteins Todesrennen (1975). However, Stallone was also keen to be recognized as a screenwriter, not just an actor, and, inspired by the 1975 Muhammad Ali-Chuck Wepner fight in Cleveland, Stallone wrote a film script about a nobody fighter given the \"million to one opportunity\" to challenge for the heavyweight title. Rocky (1976) became the stuff of cinematic legends, scoring ten Academy Award nominations, winning the Best Picture Award of 1976 and triggering one of the most financially successful movie series in history! Whilst full credit is wholly deserved by Stallone, he was duly supported by tremendous acting from fellow cast members Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young, and director John G. Avildsen gave the film an emotive, earthy appeal from start to finish. Stallone had truly arrived on his terms, and offers poured in from various studios eager to secure Hollywood's hottest new star.\n\nStallone followed Rocky (1976) with F.I.S.T. - Ein Mann geht seinen Weg (1978), loosely based on the life of Teamsters boss \"Jimmy Hoffa\", and Vorhof zum Paradies (1978) before pulling on the boxing gloves again to resurrect Rocky Balboa in the sequel Rocky II (1979). The second outing for the \"Italian Stallion\" wasn't as powerful or successful as the first \"Rocky\", however, it still produced strong box office. Subsequent films Nachtfalken (1981) and Flucht oder Sieg (1981) failed to ignite with audiences, so Stallone was once again lured back to familiar territory with Rocky III - Das Auge des Tigers (1982) and a fearsome opponent in \"Clubber Lang\" played by muscular ex-bodyguard Mr. T. The third \"Rocky\" installment far outperformed the first sequel in box office takings, but Stallone retired his prizefighter for a couple of years as another series was about to commence for the busy actor.\n\nThe character of Green Beret \"John Rambo\" was the creation of Canadian-born writer David Morrell, and his novel was adapted to the screen with Stallone in the lead role in Rambo (1982), also starring Richard Crenna and Brian Dennehy. The movie was a surprise hit that polarized audiences because of its commentary about the Vietnam war, which was still relatively fresh in the American public's psyche. Political viewpoints aside, the film was a worldwide smash, and a sequel soon followed with Rambo II - Der Auftrag (1985), which drew even stronger criticism from several quarters owing to the film's plot line about American MIAs allegedly being held in Vietnam. But they say there is no such thing as bad publicity, and \"John Rambo's\" second adventure was a major money spinner for Stallone and cemented him as one of the top male stars of the 1980s. Riding a wave of amazing popularity, Stallone called on old sparring partner Rocky Balboa to climb back into the ring to defend American pride against a Soviet threat in the form of a towering Russian boxer named \"Ivan Drago\" played by curt Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV - Der Kampf des Jahrhunderts (1985). The fourth outing was somewhat controversial with \"Rocky\" fans, as violence levels seemed excessive compared to previous \"Rocky\" films, especially with the savage beating suffered by Apollo Creed, played by Carl Weathers, at the hands of the unstoppable \"Siberian Express\".\n\nStallone continued forward with a slew of macho character-themed films that met with a mixed reception from his fans. Die City-Cobra (1986) was a clumsy mess, Over the Top: Mein Daddy schlägt sie alle (1987) was equally mediocre, Rambo III (1988) saw Rambo take on the Russians in Afghanistan, and cop buddy film Tango und Cash (1989) just did not quite hit the mark, although it did feature a top-notch cast and there was chemistry between Stallone and co-star Kurt Russell.\n\nPhiladelphia's favorite mythical boxer moved out of the shadows for his fifth screen outing in Rocky V (1990) tackling Tommy \"Machine\" Gunn played by real-life heavyweight fighter Tommy Morrison, the great-nephew of screen legend John Wayne. Sly quickly followed with the lukewarm comedy Oscar - Vom Regen in die Traufe (1991), the painfully unfunny Stop! Oder meine Mami schießt! (1992), the futuristic action film Demolition Man (1993), and the comic book-inspired Judge Dredd (1995). Interestingly, Stallone then took a departure from the gung-ho steely characters he had been portraying to stack on a few extra pounds and tackle a more dramatically challenging role in the intriguing Cop Land (1997), also starring Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta. It isn't a classic of the genre, but Cop Land (1997) certainly surprised many critics with Stallone's understated performance. Stallone then lent his vocal talents to the animated adventure story Antz (1998), reprised the role made famous by Michael Caine in a terrible remake of Get Carter - Die Wahrheit tut weh (2000), climbed back into a race car for Driven (2001), and guest-starred as the \"Toymaker\" in the third chapter of the immensely popular \"Spy Kids\" film series, Spy Kids 3: Game Over (2003). Showing that age had not wearied his two most popular series, Stallone has most recently brought back never-say-die boxer Rocky Balboa to star in, well, what else but Rocky Balboa (2006), and Vietnam veteran John Rambo (2008) will reappear after a 20-year hiatus to once again right wrongs in the jungles of Thailand.\n\nLove him or loathe him, Sylvester Stallone has built an enviable and highly respected career in Hollywood, plus, he has considerably influenced modern popular culture through several of his iconic film characters.\n\nFrank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey. With the help of George Evans (Sinatra's genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in Urlaub in Hollywood (1945) with Gene Kelly, a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In (1945). His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical Das ist New York (1949) and Spiel zu dritt (1949). A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Zu allem entschlossen (1952), and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Der Attentäter (1954). Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama Der Mann mit dem goldenen Arm (1955).\n\nKnown as \"One-Take Charlie\" for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Schwere Jungen, leichte Mädchen (1955), Schicksalsmelodie (1957) and Verdammt sind sie alle (1958). In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as Eine Nummer zu groß (1959), Die siegreichen Drei (1962) and the very successful Sieben gegen Chicago (1964). Lighter roles alongside \"Rat Pack\" buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960). On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as Botschafter der Angst (1962), regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture Der Lohn der Mutigen (1965), which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year Colonel von Ryans Expreß (1965) was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie's Der Mann am Draht (1967), once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in Der Schnüffler (1967), a role he reprised in the sequel, Die Lady in Zement (1968). He also starred with Lee Remick in Der Detektiv (1968), a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success.\n\nAfter appearing in the poorly received comic western Dirty Dingus, der scharfe Bandit (1970), Sinatra didn't act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller Das Cherry-Street-Fiasko (1977), which he also produced. Based on the novel by William Rosenberg, this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in Die erste Todsünde (1980), once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in Auf dem Highway ist wieder die Hölle los (1984) and a final acting performance in Magnum (1980), in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled Laura (1987).\n\nAlfredo James \"Al\" 'Pacino established himself as a film actor during one of cinema's most vibrant decades, the 1970s, and has become an enduring and iconic figure in the world of American movies.\n\nHe was born April 25, 1940 in Manhattan, New York City, to Italian-American parents, Rose (nee Gerardi) and Sal Pacino. They divorced when he was young. His mother moved them into his grandparents' home in the South Bronx. Pacino found himself often repeating the plots and voices of characters he had seen in the movies. Bored and unmotivated in school, he found a haven in school plays, and his interest soon blossomed into a full-time career. Starting onstage, he went through a period of depression and poverty, sometimes having to borrow bus fare to succeed to auditions. He made it into the prestigious Actors Studio in 1966, studying under Lee Strasberg, creator of the Method Approach that would become the trademark of many 1970s-era actors.\n\nAfter appearing in a string of plays in supporting roles, Pacino finally attained success off-Broadway with Israel Horovitz's \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", winning an Obie Award for the 1966-67 season. That was followed by a Tony Award for \"Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" His first feature films made little departure from the gritty realistic stage performances that earned him respect: he played a drug addict in Panik im Needle Park (1971) after his film debut in Ich, Natalie (1969). The role of Michael Corleone in Der Pate (1972) was one of the most sought-after of the time: Robert Redford, Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Ryan O'Neal, Robert De Niro and a host of other actors either wanted it or were mentioned, but director Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino for the role.\n\nCoppola was successful but Pacino was reportedly in constant fear of being fired during the very difficult shoot. The film was a monster hit that earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. However, instead of taking on easier projects for the big money he could now command, Pacino threw his support behind what he considered tough but important films, such as the true-life crime drama Serpico (1973) and the tragic real-life bank robbery film Hundstage (1975). He was nominated three consecutive years for the \"Best Actor\" Academy Award. He faltered slightly with Bobby Deerfield (1977), but regained his stride with ... und Gerechtigkeit für alle (1979), for which he received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Unfortunately, this would signal the beginning of a decline in his career, which produced flops like Cruising (1980) and Daddy! Daddy! Fünf Nervensägen und ein Vater (1982).\n\nPacino took on another vicious gangster role and cemented his legendary status in the ultra-violent cult film Scarface (1983), but a monumental mistake was about to follow. Revolution (1985) endured an endless and seemingly cursed shoot in which equipment was destroyed, weather was terrible, and Pacino fell ill with pneumonia. Constant changes in the script further derailed the project. The Revolutionary War-themed film, considered among the worst films ever made, resulted in awful reviews and kept him off the screen for the next four years. Returning to the stage, Pacino did much to give back and contribute to the theatre, which he considers his first love. He directed a film, The Local Stigmatic (1990), but it remains unreleased. He lifted his self-imposed exile with the striking Sea of Love - Melodie des Todes (1989) as a hard-drinking policeman. This marked the second phase of Pacino's career, being the first to feature his now famous dark, owl eyes and hoarse, gravelly voice.\n\nReturning to the Corleones, Pacino made Der Pate 3 (1990) and earned raves for his first comedic role in the colorful adaptation Dick Tracy (1990). This earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and two years later he was nominated for Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). He went into romantic mode for Frankie und Johnny (1991). In 1992, he finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing performance in Der Duft der Frauen (1992). A mixture of technical perfection (he plays a blind man) and charisma, the role was tailor-made for him, and remains a classic.\n\nThe next few years would see Pacino becoming more comfortable with acting and movies as a business, turning out great roles in great films with more frequency and less of the demanding personal involvement of his wilder days. Carlito's Way (1993) proved another gangster classic, as did the epic crime drama Heat (1995) directed by Michael Mann and co-starring Robert De Niro. He directed the film adaptation of Shakespeare's Al Pacino's Looking for Richard (1996). During this period, City Hall (1996), Donnie Brasco (1997) and Im Auftrag des Teufels (1997) all came out. Reteaming with Mann and then Oliver Stone, he gave commanding performances in Insider (1999) and An jedem verdammten Sonntag (1999).\n\nIn the 2000s, Pacino starred in a number of theatrical blockbusters, including Ocean's 13 (2007), but his choice in television roles (the vicious, closeted Roy Cohn in the HBO miniseries Engel in Amerika (2003) and his sensitive portrayal of Jack Kevorkian, in the television movie Ein Leben für den Tod (2010)) are reminiscent of the bolder choices of his early career. Each television project garnered him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.\n\nNever wed, Pacino has a daughter, Julie Marie, with acting teacher Jan Tarrant, and a set of twins with former longtime girlfriend Beverly D'Angelo. His romantic history includes Jill Clayburgh, Veruschka von Lehndorff, Carole Mallory, Debra Winger, Tuesday Weld, Marthe Keller, Carmen Cervera, Kathleen Quinlan, Lyndall Hobbs, Penelope Ann Miller, and a two-decade intermittent relationship with \"Godfather\" co-star Diane Keaton. He currently lives with Argentinian actress Lucila Solá, who is 36 years his junior.\n\nAs of 2022, Pacino is 82-years-old. He has never retired from acting, and continues to appear regularly in film."
