        "text": "Forget family ties. Forget the much-vaunted code of honor. Forget the tragic, eloquent grace of Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' movies and the cheerful inanity of Jonathan Demme's ''Married to the Mob.'' Martin Scorsese's blood-splattered new film, ''Goodfellas,'' is a splash of ice-cold water in the face of a public grown drunk on romantic myths about the mob.\n\nThe film, a faithful adaptation of Nicholas Pileggi's 1985 nonfiction best seller, ''Wiseguy,'' chronicles the rise and semi-fall of Henry Hill, a half-Irish, half-Italian Brooklyn kid who gets his first Mafia job at the corner cab stand while still in grade school. ''At the age of 12, my ambition was to be a gangster,'' Henry says. ''It meant power among people who had no power.'' ''Goodfellas,'' which opens on Wednesday, stars Ray Liotta as Henry; Robert De Niro (in his sixth collaboration with Mr. Scorsese) as Jimmy (The Gent) Conway, an extremely efficient hitman; Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito, whose rambunctious enthusiasm for his job might be more welcome in another profession; Paul Sorvino as Paulie Cicero, the Lucchese crime boss for whom they all work; and Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill, the nice Jewish girl from the suburbs who becomes Henry's wife and gives new meaning to the phrase ''for better or worse.''\n\nUnlike other Mafia films and books, ''Goodfellas'' is not about loyalty - by the end of the film, all the members of Henry's ''crew'' have either betrayed, or been killed by, each other. It is not about justice or salvation - although Henry does eventually face stiff charges, he almost immediately becomes a snitch, testifies against his buddies and is now, courtesy of the Federal Government's witness protection program, living a nice life in a nice house somewhere in America. And despite Henry's clearly passionate relationship with Karen - not to mention his various mistresses - it is not about love, or even sex.\n\n''Goodfellas'' - which Mr. Pileggi, who co-wrote the script with Mr. Scorsese, describes as ''a mob home movie'' - is about a far grubbier, simpler, more American obsession: How to make a buck. And about the many heads that may be cracked if they get in the way of that buck."
