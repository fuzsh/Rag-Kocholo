        "text": "\"I cento passi\" (one hundred steps) was the distance between the Impastatos' house and the house of Tano Badalamenti, an important Mafia boss, in the small Sicilian town of Cinisi. The movie is the story of Peppino Impastato, a young left-wing activist who in the late seventies (when almost nobody dared to speak about the Mafia, and several politicians maintained that the Mafia did not even exist) repeatedly denounced Badalamenti's criminal activities and the whole Mafia system, by using a small local radio station to broadcast his political pronouncements in the form of ironic humour. In 1978 Peppino (30 years old) was killed by an explosion. The police archived the case as an accident or a suicide, but his friends never accepted this conclusion. Note: This is a true story. More than twenty years after Peppino's death, the case has been re-opened. Tano Badalamenti, meanwhile, has been convicted in the USA for drug trafficking.\n\nThe story of the first ever \"anti-mafia judges pool\" established in the '80s at the Palermo Courthouse, in Sicily, in the '80s, while two mafia families started a 10-year-long war to obtain the complete control of smuggles. Giovanni Falcone was the most important of them: he discovered the liaisons between mafia and politicians, working along with Rocco Chinnici and Paolo Borsellino. Rocco Chinnici was killed by Mafia in the middle '80s, with a bomb. Giovanni Falcone was killed by mafia in 5/23/1992, with more than 100 kilograms of TNT placed under the highway between Palermo and the Punta Raisi airport, and he died along with his wife and three police officers from the VIP Protection Bureau. Paolo Borsellino was killed by mafia 50 days later, with a bomb-car placed under his mother's house, and he died along with many police officers from the VIP Protection Bureau.\n\nThe story of a man who murdered thirty-two people, gained power, and then got afraid because too many people wanted to kill him. One August morning, he disappeared. For fifteen years, everyone believed him dead. Instead, he was living in a little hotel near Frankfurt, with a wife and a young German son. Then, when the trains filled with waste departed from Naples, the past climbed on board. This is the story of a man who, while trying to kill a chestnut tree with a copper nail, was grabbed from behind by his past. And was forced to settle the score.\n\nThe film is the story of the 57 days that separate the death of Giovanni Falcone from that of Paolo Borsellino. The drama begins with a date: May 23, 1992, the day when Falcone was murdered. On the same day the judge was to meet for lunch the friend Paul to celebrate his appointment to the \"superpower of attorney\". From this day Borsellino runs against time to search for truth, however, aware that his fate is linked to that of his friend, who died in his arms after the attack suffered.\n\nFact based story about the political battle that was waged against the Mafia in Sicily during the late 1980's and early 1990's. Chazz Palminteri plays Giovanni Falcone, a crusading prosecutor who tried to use money trails as a way to attack the mobsters. He is aided by a former mobster (F. Murray Abraham) who volunteers to turn state's evidence after his sons are killed by a renegade mob chief. With the mobster's help, the prosecutor was able to obtain over 300 convictions."
