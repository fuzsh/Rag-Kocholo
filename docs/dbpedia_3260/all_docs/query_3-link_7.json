SLY, attorney, Ripley, is a son of Joseph and Eliza (Laymon) Sly, and grandson of Jacob Sly who pioneered his way to Cincinnati in 1792, and made his residence in the old block house until he had selected a home on the East fork of the Little Miami, in Clermont County, where he cleared a farm, raised a family, and lived his allotted years. On this farm, Joseph was born, who, in 1826, moved and settled on Glady Run, Brown County, where he and his companion lived to attained the age of seventy-four years. The subject of this sketch was born on the homestead Feb. 12, 1824. His early years were spent in working on the farm and securing such education as could be gathered in the winter months from the rude cabin schoolhouses of that day. By perseverance and close application to study, he obtained a good common school education. In 1844, he began the study of law in the office of Sheets & Howard, of Batavia. After three years of legal tuition, he was admitted to the bar. Subsequently, he was engaged in teaching school, and on May 1, 1851, began the practice of his profession at Fayetteville, Ohio. In the summer of 1855, he removed to Georgetown, and in the fall of the same year was elected Prosecuting Attorney. This office he filled two years with great satisfaction to his constituents. In April, 1869, he settled in Ripley, and has since been successfully engaged in his professional calling. His service one year (1873) as Grand Master of the State I. O. O. F., Mayor of Ripley two years, and his rank in Masonic fraternity afford evidence of his esteemed citizenship and professional abilities. Mr. Sly has always been an active participant in political affairs, and taken a deep interest in public and private enterprise. During the rebellion, his energies were directed in raising the Fourth Ohio Cavalry, and was elected First Lieutenant but resigned the position. His marriage to Miss Mary E. Gray, daughter of John and Nancy Gray, occurred Sept. 12, 1855.

Augusta, Ky., was born June 17, 1822, in Mecklenburg, Germany, and is a son of John Jacob and Christiana Smith, who were both natives of that country, where she died in 1879. John was by occupation a turner, and turned many articles of great value from ivory, horn and fine metals. His military service was under Napoleon. He was the father of eleven children, five of whom are now living, one being a professor in a university. John came to the United States in 1838, and remained in Philadelphia until 1847, when he came to Augusta, Ky., where he followed his trade until his death, in 1852. He had almost reached the allotted time of man - threescore and ten years. Our subject is the seventh child, and he as well as his other brothers and sisters came to America subsequently to their father at different intervals. He brought his sister Philipine to the United States, in 1841, stopping in Philadelphia, where he, in 1842, enlisted in the United States Navy as a musician, and made a trip with Caleb Cushing to China, remaining in service three years, and making a trip around the globe. His sailing aggregated 67,000 miles. His discharge dates 1845, at Norfolk, Va. He then followed his profession (teaching music), until 1853, when he settled in Brown County and bought his present farm of twenty-five acres, in Lewis Township. He then began cultivating grapes, but finding it different to what he expected, and that it did not justify him to devote his entire time thus, he resumed the teaching of music a part of the time, and finally began the raising of tobacco and other small fruits, which receives his attention at present. In 1857, he married Johanna Cramer, a native of Germany, born in 1837, but since 1850, a resident of the United States. The issue of this union is nine children, eight of whom are still livng, and under the parent roof.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 116\n\nF.

Here the wild beast roamed at will, and was seldom molested in his forest home among the hills and along the valleys. Contentment reigned supreme, and the Indian was monarch of all he surveyed. But at an unguarded hour the civilizer crossed the beautiful Ohio, pitched his tent upon its shore, and proceeded to take possession of the fertile spot now known as Brown County; and with the oft repeated blows from the pioneer's ax the giant trees fell as doth the grass before the scythe. With strong arms and brave hearts, homes were established in the face of the savage and to the dismay of the wild beast, and now as we look upon the broad meadows covered with green verdure and golden fields of grain, and enjoy our pleasant homes, our hearts swell with gratitude to our fathers who braved the storms and disappointments of a then new and unbroken country, and established for us a free government. Among the early settlers of Brown County were Benjamin and Rachel Smith, who were both born in Maryland of Scotch and English parentage. From Maryland they emigrated to Kentucky, where they lived several yeas; in 1804, they came to Brown County, Ohio, and settled where Georgetown at present is built. They cast their lot with others who preceded them, and made a purchase of a considerable tract of land. They had nine children whose names were respectively James, Nancy, Benjamin, Rachel, Mary, Benton, Rebecca, Nicholas and Elizabeth. However, the father did not live long to enjoy his home; for, soon after the close of the war of 1812, he died, leaving his family in comfortable circumstances. The children proceeded to add to what was left them by their father, and gradually increased their possessions of this world's goods. But that spirit which characterized their father was inherited by the children, and they began to think of pitching their tents toward the setting sun; so they continued to travel Westward until several of the families are represented in California. However, one Nicholas, the youngest son and father of the subject of this sketch, remained in this county. He was born in September, 1801, and when twenty-four years old, married Mrs. Sally Richards, a widow with two sons - John and William. They enjoyed the blessings of wedded life for more than half a century, when death called him away to the bright land above from whence no traveller returneth. He was the father of ten children, of whom four are now living - Alexander, resides in Illinois; James G., Rebecca J. and Francis M., our subject, who still lives near the old homestead. Richard fell, defending the flag of the Union in the late rebellion, at the battle of Pittsburg Landing, in April, 1862. About 1830, Nicholas Smith moved to what is now known as Green Township, and began to establish for himself a home in the forest. He participated in the organization of the first Methodist Episcopal Church in the township, of which he was a member, also a member of the first Sunday school, and is said to have been the second Whig voter in Green Township. He had served as Justice of the Peace, and was respected and honored by all who knew him. His wife, Sally, was born in Maryland Apr. 13, 1800, and is of English descent. With her parents, Richard and Rebecca Spires, she came to Ohio in 1812. She was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church when first organized in Brown County. She is still living and enjoying good health at the ripe old age of eighty-two years. Their son, Francis M., subject of this sketch, the youngest child and seventh son of the family, was born in Brown County July 10, 1844, at the old homestead, two miles north of Mt. Oreb. He received a good common school education, and when twenty yeas old began teaching school, which he followed for perhaps three years. When twenty-four years old, he went on a Western tour, visited a brother in Illinois and returned home in March, 1868. On Feb. 16, 1870, he married Miss Sarah E. Rice, daughter of Benjamin and Eliza Rice, now of Clermont County, Ohio. At an early day, July 3, 1871, death entered his home, robbed him of the companion of his youth, and his home became broken up. On Oct. 28, 1871, he formed with Joseph Clare, Esq., of Bethel, Ohio, a partnership in the mercantile business at Mt. Oreb, and continued therein six years, a portion of the time they having the only store in town. In April, 1875, our subject was again married; this time to Mrs. Mary E. Cochran, widow of the late John G. Cochran, son of Joseph Cochran, President of the First National Bank at Georgetown, Ohio. She was the mother of two children - Ella and Peggie. Soon after his marriage, Mr. Smith quite the mercantile business and retired to his farm north of and adjoining Mt. Oreb, where he now resides. He became identified with the Cincinnati & Eastern Railway Company, in the infancy also one of the incorporators of the Columbus & Ohio River Railway Company, and was elected one of its Directors at the first election held by the company, and now holds the office of Secretary. He has been repeated elected and re-elected to office in Green Township, notwithstanding his being a Republican and the township largely Democratic. He has also been connected with nearly every public enterprise which would prove beneficial to the township in which he resides. Mr. Smith has for nearly nineteen years been identified with the Methodist Episcopal Church; has held nearly every office in the church, and has repeatedly been elected lay delegate to the Annual Conference. He is now in the ninth year of his superintendency of the Methodist Episcopal Sunday school at Mt. Oreb, which is in a flourishing condition. He has on child living - Sallie V., born June 14, 1876. As a leading and respected citizen of Brown County, there are none who are more worthy of representation in this work.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 269 Scott Twp. -\n\nJAMES J. SMITH. Mr. Smith is about a year younger than Henry Young, and these two gentlemen are the oldest persons in the township. Mr. Smith is one of those fortunate persons who have a real history, that is to say, an eventful life whose incidents are not all merely personal. He was born Sept. 8, 1803, in what at that time was called Tinkey Bottoms, in Hamilton County, Ohio. His mothers maiden name was Morris, and she was a sister of Hon. Thomas Morris, who acquired fame in the Senate of the United States by the fearless advocacy of certain political innovations of his day. Her father was Isaac Morris, a native of Harrison County, Va., and as Mr. Smith styles it, an old-side Baptist preacher. Mr. Smiths father dying when he was only six years of age, he was left to the care of relatives, and thus became the ward of his uncle Thomas Morris. At the age of ten years, he was placed in the office of the Western American, a paper published at Williamsburg, Clermont Co., Ohio, by Mr. Morris, to learn the art of printing. Here he was diligently employed for a year, and then was intrusted with the distribution of the paper to the much scattered subscribers of the county, although he was scarcely more than eleven years old at the time. He did not ride part of the distance on stage coach, or cart, or in a buggy or wagon, but made the entire voyage on horseback through a wilderness where roads were not one of the conveniences of traveling. While in the family of his uncle, Thomas L. Hamer, then a student of law, joined it to read law in the office of Mr. Morris. The friendship and intimacy that sprung up between the young printers apprentice and the young law student and future statesman continued till the death of the latter in Mexico after a meteoric career, crowded with brilliant achievements. Prior to the year 1829, Mr. Smith was employed in different printing offices, sometimes as journeyman, and others as superintendent. He and Mr. Hamer owned and conducted the Benefactor, a weekly published at Georgetown, Thomas L. Hamer, editor, and James J. Smith, printer. Subsequently, he served one year in the office of the Ohio Monitor, published in Columbus, and one year in the State Printing Office, also in Columbus. He worked one year in the office of the Star, printed in Cincinnati, and, finally, in 1827 or 1828, co-operated with Samuel Medary in the management of the Ohio Sun, printed at Bethel, Clermont Co., Ohio. Mr. Smith was married to Rosanna Wood, of Clermont County, Sept. 16, 1835, John Quinlan, Justice of the Peace, officiating. He has been several times chosen Justice of the Peace, has filled nearly every office in the township, was elected Auditor of Brown County in 1840, and re-elected in 1842, has a commission of Coroner dated 1836, and signed by Gov. Lucas, and was appointed by John Patterson, United States Marshal, to take the sixth census in 1840.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H.

Samuel Bernard Smith, a son of William and Elizabeth (Hoover) Smith, was born in Bath County, Va., Mar. 24, 1820, both natives of Virginia. Grandfather Hoover was a native of Germany; served six years and nine months in the Revolutionary war, and died in 1844 at the advanced age of 107 years. The subject of this sketch, while young, had the advantage of only a meager common school education, and came to Ohio in 1841 and engaged in the ministry two years later, and which he was engaged for thirty-six years, serving two years as Presiding Elder of the M. P. Conference. Mr. Smith was one of the mild, quiet, persuasive preachers, and never inclined to be stormy, but the high estimation in which he was held is attested by the honor conferred by being twice Presiding Elder. He was retired to the superannuated list in 1879. Mr. Smith was married, in 1846, to Ellen Jane, widow of Samuel Davis, and daughter of Robert and Margaret (White) Kennedy (see Clark Township history). They have five children - Samuel K. (married and living at Piketon, Ohio, and Principal of Schools), Ella Bell (widow of Elsberry Young, killed by the falling of the C., G. & P. R. R. Bridge across the Little Miami July 24, 1877), Emma (wife of Thomas M. Lucas), Charles Garwood, Jessie Estella. Grandfather William Smith, of English descent, was a soldier in Gen. Marion's army, and lived to be one hundred and four years old. Mr. Smith is an honored member of Fayette Lodge, No. 107, F. & A. M. Was initiated in West Union Lodge No. 43, I. O. O. F., and is now a P. G. of De Soto Lodge, No. 374, and officiating Chaplain.

In the fall of 1858, he settled on a farm in the eastern portion of Jefferson Township, where he still lives. His farm is in a high state of cultivation, and thereon he has erected commodious and substantial buildings. He has been successful as an agriculturalist, owing to his good management and having a thorough knowledge of those principles upon which the successful agriculturist must rely. He has served as Trustee for Jefferson Township, is a member of the Methodist Church, a Republican, and the owner of about 230 acres of land.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W.

Felicity, Clermont Co., Ohio, is a son of Christian Snider, who was born near Reading, Penn., and in early life learned the tailor's trade, but followed it comparatively little after reaching Ohio early in the present century. In his native State, he married, about 1802, Catharine, daughter of Jacob Miller, who is mentioned in Samuel Wise's sketch of this township. The settlement of Christian and wife dates in the same year as the Wise settlement - 1806. They located on part of the 1,000 acres in the forks of Bullskin Creek, having at that time two children. The 160 acres of land given him by his father-in-law was all in the woods, but in due time they had a few acres cleared on which could be raised the most necessary crops for a living, and with energy and industry the little opening grew to a large open and productive farm. Thus they trod the path of life in union until 1855, when his death occurred; she followed in about one decade. Their connection with the Presbyterian Church dates to an early period of their lives. They reared a family of six children, of whom four now survive, viz.: David, John, Eliza A., Ruggles and our subject, Jacob. He was born in Center County, Penn., Mar.3, 1803, but from the date of emigration above given, he resided in what is now Brown County, Ohio. Here he has passed over three-fourths of a century. His marriage was celebrated Jan. 1, 1833, with Rachel Park, who was born Dec. 29, 1812. To this union have been given seven children of whom six are now living, viz.: Laura E., Elizabeth J., William R., Mary E., Martha P. and Emma N., the third and fourth being twins, one of whom, William R., Mary E., Martha P. and Emma N., the third and fourth being twins, one of whom, William R., the only son, was born May 12, 1842, in Lewis Township.

STIERS, Postmaster, Hamersville, was formerly a well-known practicing physician of Hamersville and Brown County. He was born in Clermont County, Ohio, Oct. 21, 1820. His parents were Ralph and Elizabeth (Aldrich) Stiers, natives of Pennsylvania, of German and English descent. The former was a soldier in the war of 1812. His grandfather Aldrich enlisted under Gen. Washington in the Revolutionary army, when but seventeen years of age. Dr. Stiers' paternal grandfather, Jacob Stiers, was an early settler in Pennsylvania and twice married. His first wife and children were captured by the Indians, and the mother and children all killed except two daughters. These were carried into captivity and one finally suffered the same fate as the preceding ones. The remaining daughter grew to womanhood among the savages, and was subsequently discovered by her relations. They endeavored to induce her to return to her old home, but it had been so many years since she had been abducted, that she did not recognize her father. She asked to see a step-brother, and when brought before her, she lifted his hat and discovered a knife wound on his head which she had inflicted in her childhood days. Thus she knew it was her brother, but still refused to go back to her friends. She believed she could never again accustom herself to the habits and customs of the white people, and remained with the Indians until her death. Dr. Stiers came to Brown County in 1848, and located at Hamersville. His early education was obtained in the common schools, and subsequently he attended the Ohio College of Medicine, at Cincinnati. He commenced the practice of his profession at Hamersville, the year of his location in this county. He is a member of the Allopathic School of Medicine. For fourteen years he practiced his profession, and administered to rich and poor alike, never holding back on account of a person's financial standing, but, full of sympathy and kindness, he treated all alike. During the last seven years of his practice, he rode night and day, only being at home one whole night in this period of time. In 1860, premonitory symptoms of that dreaded disease, amanrosis appeared in his eyes, and within two years his eyesight totally left him. This terrible affliction called forth and sympathy and kindness of his many friends and neighbors, and although the Doctor was forced to give up his practice, yet his subsequent life, with this one exception, has been peaceful and quiet. He and his wife are well known in Hamersville and the surrounding country and beloved for their kind hearts and cheerful dispositions. He owns the property where he now resides, also the small store on the premises. In 1880, he was appointed Postmaster, and the duties of that office are faithfully attended to by his son, Robert, a young man of good morals and industrious habits. The Doctor was united in marriage, in 1851, to Emily J. Moore, born at Hamersville Mar. 16, 1832, and daughter of Eliakim and Jane (Francis) Moore, of German and Scotch descent. They have two children - Robert M., born Mar. 2, 1864, and Anna M., born Dec. 12, 1871. These children were born after the Doctor's eyesight disappeared, and he has never enjoyed the privilege of seeing their forms and features. Since this affliction, the Doctor has been a faithful and earnest expounder of the Gospel, and is a man of more than ordinary intelligence.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 192\n\nEagle Twp. -\n\nB. J. STIVERS, banker, Ripley, is a son of Robert and Jane (Meharry) Stivers. His maternal relatives were among the respected families of Virginia, who subsequently settled in Pennsylvania, where Robert was born. He moved to the West at an early day, and located in Adams County, where he was married. He was among those of the early pioneers of that county, and resided there until his death, which occurred in 1855. The subject of this sketch was born on the homestead in 1818. His early educational advantages were limited, and, when he had attained his majority, moved to Ripley and began the labor of life with nothing but his energies and ambition for capital. He secured a position with A. Leggett, a prominent merchant of that day, as a clerk, which proved to be the foundation stone of his success. After a service of some years, he was admitted a partner, and the firm of Leggett & Stivers did a large business in pork and general stock. In the fall of 1847, he was called to fill the position as Teller of the Farmers Branch of the State Bank of Ohio, in which institution he has since been an officer. His election to the position of Cashier, in 1877, he respectfully declined, feeling its duties too great. Mr. S. has for years been largely engaged in the trade of leaf tobacco, flour and pork, and his success is due to his tireless industry and unquailing purpose, making every opportunity useful. He was united in marriage to Miss Harriet N. daughter of John McLain, in 1845. She died in 1851. His present wife, Mrs. Kate Stivers, was a daughter of John T. Maddox, an early pioneer of Adams County. To this union two children have been born - John R. and Frank A., both residing at home. Mr. Stivers is a strong advocate of temperance, and has filled offices of trust. Politically, he is an adherent of Republican principles, and a descendant of the Old-Line Whigs.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 230"
