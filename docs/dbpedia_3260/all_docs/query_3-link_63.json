There is nothing that I would change about this town!\n\nGeorgetown is a rural, conservative, family-oriented community. It is safe and has an all-American small town feel. We have shopping, a courthouse, a small theater, summer concerts, a park, restaurants, historical buildings, many churches, and schools. There are opportunities in Georgetown that are not available in more urban settings. These include agricultural endeavors such as farming and gardening. Also, there many places to enjoy hobbies such as hunting and fishing as we are near many forests and the beautiful Ohio River."
