        "text": "March 17th 1956-September 12th 2019\n\n63 years young\n\nDave was born on March 17, 1956 in Saskatoon, SK. to Jessie and Clarence Fisher.\n\nHe passed away peacefully with his loving wife Betty Anne at his side.\n\nAfter graduating from Mount Royal Collegiate he remained in Saskatoon and began a career in sales with Sears Canada. His attention to customer care left people with a memorable experience for years to come.\n\nHe retired after 38 years giving him ample time to spend caring for his yard, golfing, fishing, enjoying the cabin at Meeting lake and spending quality time with his family and son Steven.\n\nDave and Betty Anne looked forward to their annual vacations to Las Vegas and warm sunny destinations. One of their most recent trips was a Caribbean cruise where they renewed their wedding vows.\n\nDave celebrated every possible occasion and his passion and love for life was very contagious. He was an enthusiastic sports fan and loved cheering on the Toronto Maple Leafs, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Roughriders.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 17 years, Betty Anne; his 5 children, Kristie Leslie (Ryan) Harper, Jarad Fisher(Jenny), Adam Kinakin(Megan) Emerson, Addison and Rhyerson, Steven Kinakin, and Andrew Kinakin(Heidi Merkosky) Madison, Parker; his mother, Norene Penner; 6 brothers and sisters and their families, and an abundance of close friends.\n\nA celebration of Dave’s life will be held at The Cathedral of the Holy Family 123 Nelson Road (use Forestry Farm entrance)on Tuesday, September 17th, at 2pm.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, we would appreciate your generous donations to Cosmo Industries( cosmoindustries.com – 306-664-3158 ) on behalf of Dave Fisher to support adults with intellectual disabilities.\n\nDave was a bright light that spread joy to everyone he met, and will be missed immensely. Our lives are forever changed because of him."
