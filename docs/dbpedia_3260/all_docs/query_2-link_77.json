        "text": "Clinical Trials in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Hodgkin's Disease\n\nOur primary focus is the comprehensive treatment of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This clinical work includes the expert use of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplant procedures. Our practice, located at the Lymphoma Clinic at Dana-Farber, is a combined clinic that includes radiation oncologists who specialize in lymphoma. Dr. Fisher attends on the Lymphoma and Bone Marrow Transplant services at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is the oncologist providing specialty care in the Cutaneous Lymphoma Clinic in conjunction with the Department of Dermatology. This large-volume practice allows us to provide expertise in all types of lymphoma.Our research interests are in the use of novel drug combinations to improve therapy for different subtypes of lymphoma, and in the evolving field of immunotherapies and radioimmunotherapies for this population of patients. We are also conducting clinical trials evaluating the use of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant. The latter includes the use of ablative and nonmyeloablative preparative regimens with both related and unrelated donors. The focus of these studies is the optimal use of each of these strategies for the many types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. This focus allows for continuity of care for patients with lymphoma who require expert management of these modalities."
