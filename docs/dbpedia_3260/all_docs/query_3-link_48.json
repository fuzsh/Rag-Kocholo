        "text": "Description\n\nThe Georgetown Bicentennial Committee, the Brown County Historical Society and M.T. Publishing Company, Inc. have joined forces to create a new, all-color, coffee-table-style photographic history book in celebration of the Georgetown Bicentennial. Have you ever wondered why patent medicines like Hadacol, Peruna, and Lydia Pinkham’s “vegetable compound for women” were so popular at Donohoo’s Drug Store? Or what ever became of Bart Bailey after he left West Point, making it possible for Ulysses Grant to enter the academy? Or if there is any truth to the rumor that a revolving restaurant is being planned for the top of the landfill? This new book will answer these and many other questions as we explore the history of our local businesses, schools, politics, churches, major events, famous residents, and much more.\n\nThis 8.5 x 11 inch, coffee-table style book with a deluxe hard bound cover features 264 glossy, double-coated pages allowing for superior photo reproduction."
