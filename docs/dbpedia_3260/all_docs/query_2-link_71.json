November 1, 2004 On a warm summer day in 1983 A beautiful child was born to me And on that day I learned that love Was a gift for me sent from above A miracle, a wonder, a little boy Who filled my life with endless joy. Watching him grow through the years Certainly not without any tears Still a gift, like no other I'd known But now I am left here all alone One more miracle if it can be? Please bring him safely back to me. After December 1st The Lord has decided to change the plan a bit Beside you now, he shall sit I thank you for his time with me I trust you now for eternity. Love, Mom",
