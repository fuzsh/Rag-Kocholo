Her father is Thomas Stanley, a native of Virginia, and her mother is Rachel (Hoskins) Stanley, born in Clinton County, Ohio. The Stanleys are of English and the Hoskins of Welsh descent.

He remained there but a short time, however, going to Louisa County, Iowa. He attended the first land sale in the State of Iowa, at Burlington. At that time the Indians were numerous, and would frequently come into Mr. Stanley's cabin to smoke. After several years' residence in Louisa County Mr. Stanley moved to Whiteside County, Illinois, in the Rock River country.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Fisher were born four children who reached maturity. The first three were born in Whiteside County, Illinois, and the youngest in Jefferson County, Iowa.

Transcribed by Marthann Kohl-Fuhs\n\nJONATHAN WYLAND was born in Pennsylvania, January 1, 1797. His father was Christian Wyland, whose ancestors came from Switzerland. When our subject was a boy his parents moved to Greene County, Ohio, where they followed farming, having cleared a farm from out the dense forests, a task that would now seem too great to be undertaken by any one. Jonathan learned the cooper's trade and worked at that as well as farming. His first wife was Catherine Plum, by whom one child was born, named Washington. His second wife was Elizabeth Van Ausdell, a native of Ohio; her parents moved from New Jersey to Ohio and were from Holland originally. After his second marriage Mr. Wyland moved to Mercer County, Ohio, where he remained until 1832 and then moved to Goshen, Elkhart County, Indiana, where his wife died in 1858. They reared a large family of sons and daughters, named as follows - Catherine (deceased), Rachel (deceased), William, Isaac P., Mary (deceased), Christian J., Lovina, Barbara, Jasper Newton, who was a soldier from Shelby County, Iowa, member of Company I, Ninth Iowa Cavalry, and who died from wounds received July, 1864, at Duval's Bluff; the other children are - David M., Thomas Jefferson and Elizabeth. In Indiana Mr. Wyland followed farming and milling, owning a woolen-mill, flouring mill and saw-mill and carrying on an extensive business in both. He first came to Shelby County in 1855 with his oldest son, William, and at that time entered a large tract of land, including a half section in Shelby County and a full section in Pottawattamie County; he afterward purchased 200 acres in that county and a good sized tract in what is now Shelby County, in addition to that entered there. After entering this land he returned to Indiana and remained until May, 1861, when he moved to Shelby County, coming overland, bringing his effects in three two-horse wagons and driving several cows. The journey consumed three weeks, and, like all journeys of that day, was very tedious as there were no bridges and very little improvement along the way. They crossed the Mississippi at Davenport, Iowa. Mr. Wyland furnished the means with which to build the first saw-mill in the eastern part of the county, the same being erected at Bowman's Grove. It was put into operation in 1857, the machinery being hauled by team from Iowa City. While on his first trip to Iowa our subject received a paralytic stroke from which he had much trouble and which finally caused his death, May 28, 1864, while stopping with one of his daughters on a farm four miles from Goshen, Indiana. He was a man of rugged constitution and full of energy, having always been a hard-worker at what- ever he undertook to accomplish. He was a faithful member of the Dunkard or German Baptist church. He never sought public office, but was one of the Elkhart County, Indiana, commissioners for a term of fourteen years. A number of his children are among the most highly esteemed and public-spirited men of Shelby County at the present time; sketches of them will be found elsewhere in this volume.\n\nSource: 1889 Biographical History of Shelby County, Iowa, pp. 327-328.

Transcribed by Marthann Kohl-Fuhs.\n\nForeign countries have bequeathed to America some of her best and most brilliant citizens, and the Emerald Isle has not been behind in the quality of her contribution to the strong and vigorous growth of this country. To her Shelby County is indebted for her greatest benefactor and best beloved citizen, Thomas McDonald, now at rest, the rest won by a life of tireless activity in the interests and welfare of those whose lives touched his; and these were not few, as will be attested by numbers of citizens of western Iowa. Thomas McDonald was a most remarkable man; to meet him was to be attracted to him; to know him was to be won as a fast friend, and hearty admirer. He was kind and obliging, and possessed the faculty of adapting himself to all sorts and conditions of men, who always found in him the satisfaction of their pressing needs. He had within him a strong public spirit, ever willing to sacrifice his own interests to those of the majority, in his home he was all that a wife and children could desire, and only those who have been blessed by the association of such a beautifully rounded and perfect character can know the loss of the family in his death. Thomas McDonald was born in Bandon, twenty miles southwest of the city of Cork, Ireland, July 20, 1843. His parents came to America when he was four years old. They settled in Massachusetts, but remained there only a year; they then went to LaSalle, Illinois, where Thomas resided with his parents until he was nineteen years old, when he enlisted in the army, pledged to defend the flag of his adopted country; he joined the Ninetieth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, of which he was Sergeant Major. He served through the entire war and was honorably discharged at its close.

He then came to Iowa and settled in Dunlap, Harrison County, where he resided six years; he then settled on his farm of 600 acres, six miles south of Harlan, and lived there until his death. During his residence in the county he filled various offices of honor and trust. He was elected county treasurer in 1875, and re-elected in 1877. It was due to his untiring energy and good management that the A.H. & N. R. R. was secured to Harlan; he was president of the company.
