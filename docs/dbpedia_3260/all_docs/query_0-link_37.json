        "text": "Established by Arthur St. Clair, the governor of the Northwest Territory, Adams County was one of the first four counties in the region. It was named after then-president John Adams. Adams County is home to the Great Serpent Mound, one of the largest prehistoric Native American effigies on the continent. The Adena culture, one of the mother cultures for Midwestern Native American nations, is believed to have built the mound possibly as far back as 300 BCE. The mound is a 1,335-foot effigy of a partially coiled snake with an egg in its jaws.\n\nAllen County was named after Colonel John Allen, who was killed during the War of 1812. The region was at first largely covered by a forbidding wetland called the Great Black Swamp. The treaty that ended the Ohio Indian Wars ceded the area to the Shawnee Tribe and other Native groups, slowing European colonization. But after the War of 1812, the Shawnee were pushed to reservations and settlers began moving in. The discovery of oil in the region fueled its growth and transformed Lima into an industrial center. Named after the home of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, Ashland County was settled by migrants from New England. This gave the county a distinct abolitionist stance. Lorin Andrews, an early advocate for public education in Ashland, was the first Ohioan to volunteer in the Civil War. He led the 4th Ohio Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Rich Mountain. Ashtabula County is named for the Ashtabula River. \"Ashtabula\" comes from Algonquin, possibly meaning \"river of many fish.\" Before the Civil War, the county served as an important stop on the Underground Railroad. It was the last place in Ohio freedom-seekers would pass through on the route to Canada. During the Civil War, the 29th Ohio Infantry Regiment, which fought in the Atlanta Campaign, was organized at Camp Giddings in Jefferson. After the rise of railroads, Ashtabula also became the unfortunate site of one of the U.S.'s deadliest railroad accidents. In 1876, a bridge over the Ashtabula River collapsed under a train, killing 92. Home to Ohio University, the first institute of higher education in the state, and the Coonskin Library, the first library in the state, Athens County was named in honor of Athens, Greece, a center of learning in ancient Europe. Ohioans from Athens made up four companies in the 36th and 116th Infantry Regiments in the Civil War. These companies took part in notable battles including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Siege of Richmond, and Appomattox Court House. Auglaize County gets its name from the French words for “clay-filled water,” a name it shares with the river that runs through it. The territory of current-day Auglaize changed hands many times. Initially inhabited by the Shawnee Tribe, the French claimed it until 1763, when Britain gained control. However, neither the British nor the newly independent Americans settled the area immediately, despite having its land rights. Settlement began in the 1830s after the Shawnee in the area were removed to Kansas. Belmont County was named after the French for “beautiful mountain.” Many of Belmont County’s early inhabitants were Quakers from Pennsylvania. Belmont was one of nine counties established before Ohio achieved statehood. During the Civil War, many of the county’s soldiers joined the 98th Ohio Infantry Regiment and took part in the pivotal March to the Sea, led by General William Tecumseh Sherman. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Belmont’s economy was driven by the coal, iron, and steel industries due to its position on the Ohio River. Today the county is one of Ohio’s largest natural gas producing counties. Brown County is named for Major General Jacob Brown, a general in the War of 1812. Ulysses S. Grant, the Commanding General for the Union Army at the end of the Civil War and the 18th President of the U.S., spent much of his childhood in Georgetown. There he attended an academy operated by another notable Brown County resident, abolitionist John Rankin. In the 1860s, Brown County was the first site of burley tobacco production in the U.S. That tradition has continued, as the county now grows the second most tobacco in the state. Butler County is comprised of land acquired by John Symmes, which was purchased from Congress in 1788. The county draws its name from Revolutionary War General Richard Butler, who was killed in the Battle of the Wabash against the United Indian Nations. Butler County was gravely affected by the Great Flood of 1913, which killed more than 100 residents. During the flood, the county’s courthouse was repurposed as a temporary morgue. Butler County is home to Miami University in Oxford, the second-oldest public institute of higher education in the state. Carroll County is named for Charles Carroll, a signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence who passed away just months before the county’s creation. Like its neighbors Columbiana County and Tuscarawas County, Carroll County’s earliest European settlers were Moravian missionaries. During the Civil War, a Carroll County family known as the Fighting McCooks had fifteen members fight for the Union. Six of them reached at least the rank of general. A county native played an important role in World War II as well. Charles Wilson, born in Minerva, was the president of General Motors during the war and oversaw the company’s manufacturing of armaments. Champaign County was inhabited by the Adena culture two millennia ago. Its first European settlers were Swedenborgians, followers of a Christian denomination originating in Sweden. Less than one percent of the county is urban. Champaign County residents fought with the 113th Ohio Infantry Regiment during the Civil War, notably taking part in the March to the Sea led by General William Tecumseh Sherman. More than 570 Champaign men gave their lives to the Union cause. Clark County was named for George Rogers Clark, a Revolutionary War colonel who pushed the British and their Native American allies from the Trans-Appalachian frontier. The county began to prosper in the 1830s, as the completion of the National Road through Ohio opened trade routes and spurred immigration. In the 1850s, Springfield industrialist William N. Whiteley invented a combined reaper and mower. It soon became an agriculture-industry mainstay, and Springfield became a leading manufacturer of farm equipment. One of the earliest of the 4-H club’s “learning by doing” programs also began in Springfield, in 1902. Clermont County’s name comes from the French for “clear mountain,” which is how explorers described it in the 1600s. Before colonization, Clermont was home to Native peoples including the Shawnee, Miami, Delaware, Seneca-Cayuga, Ottawa, Cherokee, and Wyandotte. The Wyandotte maintained a village in present-day Jackson Township until 1811. The region’s first settler village, Williamsburg, was established in 1796. Clermont County has attracted a variety of businesses in recent years. Nestle Purina is building an ultra-modern pet food plant that will employ 300. FC Cincinnati, the professional soccer team, opened a state-of-the-art training facility in the county. Clinton County is named after George Clinton, the US Vice President from 1805-1812, serving under both Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. The first white settlers in the area arrived between 1797 and 1799 and are believed to be three men by the names of Morgan Van Meter, Amos Wilson, and David Sewell. Many of the county's early residents were members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). They played an important role in the Underground Railroad from the 1830s through the 1860s, helping runaway slaves find freedom in the North. The Quakers also established Wilmington College during the 1870s. Columbiana County is named for Christopher Columbus and Queen Anne of Great Britain. Located in the heart of Appalachia, its leading industry early on was agriculture. The Ohio River and other waterways connected the county to markets in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Roadways built in the early 1800s spurred development. Industry expanded with the construction of railroads in the 1840s and 1850s. During those years, James Bennett, an English potter, opened a pottery plant in East Liverpool to capitalize on local clays. The city soon became a center ceramics production. The county remains one of the world’s largest suppliers of kaolin for ceramics. Early inhabitants of present-day Coshocton County were the Delaware Tribe. The Delaware gave the county its name, meaning “black bear crossing.” The convergence of the Tuscarawas and Walhonding rivers in Coshocton County provides it with rich soil. The rivers motivated the designers of the Ohio and Erie Canal to pass it through the county, which fueled the county’s agricultural and industrial growth. The canal later played an important role in the Underground Railroad, as freedom-seekers followed it to Canada. Crawford County is named after William Crawford, a Revolutionary War soldier. In 1782, Colonel Crawford led an army to what is now Crawford County. Their mission was to quell raids on the frontier settlements from the Wyandotte, Delaware, and Shawnee tribes. The army encountered tribespeople and British soldiers, and eventually retreated. While retreating, Crawford became separated, and his troops, now led by Major Rose, engaged in combat in “The Battle of Olentangy,” the last battle of the Revolutionary War involving British regulars. Colonel Crawford was captured and killed by the Delaware in retaliation for the massacre of Lenape and Mohican tribes in the area. Before the Revolutionary War, the region that would become Cuyahoga was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. The state ceded control to the Northwest Territory after Independence, shortly before Ohio became a state. Cuyahoga’s name was drawn from a Native American term for “crooked river.” It borders Lake Erie, the fourth largest of North America’s five Great Lakes. The county’s location at the crossroads of shipping routes along the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Erie Canal made it a major turn of the century industrial center. Though industry has declined, Cleveland is still one of Ohio’s largest cities. The area that is now Darke County was once home to several Native American nations, including the Wyandotte, the Shawnee, and the Potawatomi. The area was opened to European settlement after the Treaty of Greenville, signed at the site of modern-day Greenville. The county is named after William Darke, a military leader in the colonial and independence era. Darke was a foster father to Thomas Worthington, an early advocate for Ohio statehood. Darke County is one of the highest-producing agricultural counties in Ohio, ranking first in crop production and second in livestock and poultry production. Defiance County has been home to several military installations during its history. In the 1790s, General Anthony Wayne built Fort Defiance, from which the county gets its name. The name was inspired by a statement made by Charles Scott, leader of a Kentucky militia in support of Wayne, “I defy the English, Indians, and all the devils of hell to take it.” During the War of 1812, Fort Winchester was built in the county as a forward site against the British and their Native American allies. Finally, during the Civil War, Camp Defiance was built to assist training Ohio volunteers. Delaware County was formed by the Ohio Legislature in 1808. It was named after the Delaware Native American nation. Delaware County is a rapidly growing and diverse county. Northern Delaware County remains heavily rural with significant agricultural production, while the southern portion of the county experiences significant business and residential development. Delaware County is also home to popular tourism destinations, including the Columbus Zoo and Olentangy Indian Caverns. Erie County takes its name from the Erie, a Native American tribe that once lived in the region. Lake Erie brought the first European settlers to the area in the 1700s through the trapping and fur trading industry. Later, Erie County became an important stop along the Underground Railroad, with \"abolition boats\" transporting freedom seekers to Canada. Today, Erie County is a center for agriculture, manufacturing, and tourism. It is also home to Cedar Point, one of the largest and most visited amusement parks in the world. Named for its \"fair fields,\" the area comprising modern day Fairfield County has been inhabited for thousands of years. When Christopher Gist, one of the first European explorers to map the area, reached Fairfield County, it was inhabited by the Shawnee Tribe, as well as the Iroquois and Wyandotte. Like many other regions in the state, the county saw its economy and population grow after the construction of the Ohio and Erie Canal. The Fairfield County fairgrounds are on the site of Camp Anderson, an army base established in the early days of the Civil War to help train Ohio soldiers. Fayette County takes its name after the Marquis de Lafayette, a French military officer who supported colonial forces during the American Revolution. The historic Fayette County Courthouse features paintings and frescos by Ohio artist Archibald Willard, who is best known for his patriotic painting, \"The Spirit of '76.\" Murals by Willard in the courthouse include \"The Spirit of the U.S. Mail,\" \"Spirit of Electricity\" and \"Spirit of the Telegraph.\" Fayette County is known for being a prominent horse breeding center. Named for inventor Benjamin Franklin, Franklin County has been home to Ohio's capital since 1812. The capital moved from Chillicothe to Zanesville and back before settling in Columbus, a brand-new city designed for that purpose. Before the abolition of slavery, the county's central location in a free state bordering slave states made it a hub on the Underground Railroad. One conductor, Ozem Gardner, helped an estimated 200 formerly enslaved people reach freedom in Canada. In 2018, Columbus was selected as the site for the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, a museum focusing on veterans themselves rather than the conflicts they fought in. Fulton County was named for Robert Fulton, the inventor of the steamboat. The northern portion of Fulton County was part of the \"Toledo strip,\" a strip of land that became the subject of a border dispute between Ohio and Michigan over which entity \"owned\" it. The disputed territory was eventually awarded to Ohio. During the Civil War, men from Fulton County primarily served in the 100th Ohio Infantry Regiment and the 111th Ohio Infantry Regiment. Both regiments took part in the March to the Sea campaign. Today, the county is a productive agricultural site, particularly of floriculture and sod. Gallia County was originally settled by French immigrants. The name is derived from \"Gaul,\" the Latin word for the area comprising much of modern-day France. Gallipolis was one of the earliest settlements in the Northwest Territory. When the first French settlers arrived in the region, they discovered that the company that had sold them the land did not legally own it and were forced buy it a second time. Congress offered free land to those settlers in current-day Scioto County. While some settlers took the offer, others remained in Gallia and gave the area its name. Geauga County is named after the Onondaga word meaning \"racoon.\" The name is an homage to the Iroquois Confederacy, which had used the area as a hunting ground since the 1650s. The first permanent white settlement was Burton, founded in 1798. Other towns cropped up in the years that followed. An early industry in the county was syrup production. This tradition continues to this day with the Geauga County Maple Festival. The county is home to the second-largest Amish population in the state and the fourth largest in the country. Greene County is named after Nathanael Greene, a general in the Revolutionary War. The first white settlement in the area was founded in 1796, when John Wilson and his four sons each built a log structure in the southwest portion of the county. Greene County has an important place in aviation history. In 1905, the Huffman Prairie Flying Field became the site of the flight of the first practical airplane, the Wright Flyer III, by the Wright brothers. The county lies on a tornado plain. One of the country's strongest recorded tornados passed through Xenia in 1974. Guernsey County draws its name from the Isle of Guernsey in the English Channel, from which many of its original settlers emigrated. The construction of the National Road, the first formal highway in the U.S., passed through Guernsey County and stimulated its economy. One of the only Civil War skirmishes in Ohio took place in the village of Old Washington, where Union soldiers killed three Confederate cavalrymen. In the 1900s, the county was a significant glass manufacturing site. Hamilton was the second county formed from the Northwest Territory, after Washington. It was named for U.S. Founder Alexander Hamilton. Its early years were shaped by the Ohio Indian Wars. While most Native peoples were pushed from eastern Ohio during the Revolution, the Shawnee, Delaware, and Wyandotte continued to fight to hold their western territories until 1795. After the war's end, Hamilton County grew quickly, buoyed by its proximity to Ohio River trade routes. Its location across the river from Kentucky, a slave state, also made it an important site for Abolitionist activism and a stop on the Underground Railroad. Hancock County was formed from land previously reserved for Ohio's Native Americans under the Treaty of Greenville. The county harbored many safehouses on the Underground Railroad, which assisted Black people fleeing slavery on their northward journey to Canada. Later, the county became home to a large natural gas development, leading many glass-based manufacturers to locate themselves in and around Findlay. Hancock County's manufacturing tradition continues today, with companies such as Whirlpool Corp. and Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. located within the county. Named after the Revolutionary War officer John Hardin, Hardin County is on land that was once reserved for Native American nations under the Treaty of Greenville. Much of the county's terrain can be traced back to glaciers that receded from the area more than 10,000 years ago. The Scioto Marsh was created by the retreating glaciers. When it was drained by Hardin County residents in the late 1800s, it became the fertile farmland the county is famed for. Agriculture remains the prime industry in Hardin County. Harrison County is named after General William Henry Harrison, an Army officer during the War of 1812, future Ohio senator, and future U.S. President. Franklin College, an early educational institute in the county, educated many future leaders including eight U.S. senators, nine U.S. representatives, and two governors. Several prominent figures in the Civil War hailed from the county, including John Bingham, Edwin Stanton, and General Thomas Vincent. Harrison County has a long history of energy production, producing oil in the 1890s, coal throughout much of the 1900s, and natural gas currently. Named after the revolutionary statesman Patrick Henry, Henry County was formed from land once part of Northwest Ohio's famous Great Black Swamp. Early settlers, primarily German immigrants, worked to clear the land and drain the swamp. Agriculture quickly became a prominent industry in Henry County and remains important to this day. Early development was also fostered by the completion of the Miami Erie Canal in 1845. This led to the rise of \"canal towns\" such as Florida, Damascus, and the county seat, Napoleon. Following the Civil War, small towns began to develop throughout the county along railroad junctions and commercial stops. Highland County is named after its terrain because it is located on the high land between the Scioto River and the Little Miami River. While the Shawnee Tribe resided in what is now Highland County long before Europeans moved past the Appalachian Mountains, the first white settlement in the county is believed to be New Market, founded in 1797. Many Highland County men who served in the Civil War were in the 1st Ohio Cavalry Regiment. The regiment fought as part of General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea campaign, which played a major role in defeating the Confederacy. Hocking County's name is believed to be derived from a Delaware word meaning \"bottle.\" The name refers to the shape of the river, also named Hocking, that flows through the county. The Hocking Canal, a splint of the Ohio and Erie Canal, opened in 1838 and helped spur economic growth in the county. One of the county's main industries is tourism thanks to the Hocking Hills State Park. The park's moist, cool climate preserves tree species that are more typically found at latitudes further north, such as eastern hemlock and Canada yew. Holmes County is named for Andrew Holmes, an Army officer killed in the War of 1812. Some of the earliest settlers in the area were the Pennsylvania Dutch, more commonly known as the Amish. In the 1850s and 1860s, Holmes County was a stronghold of the Democratic Party. That, combined with the county's Amish and German population, caused opposition to the Civil War, particularly the draft. In June 1863, residents rioted against the draft for two weeks. Huron County's name derives from one of the names for the Wyandotte Nation, who lived in the area when European settlers first made contact. Much of Huron County is made up of land once known as the Firelands. During the Revolutionary War, the British army burned down several towns in Connecticut. After the war, Connecticut set aside land in its Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory for those displaced by the burnings. This land later became part of Ohio. Today, Huron County is one of the most heavily agricultural counties in the state, producing more vegetables than any other county. Jackson County is named after Andrew Jackson, a prominent general at the time of the county's founding and a future U.S. President. The area of present-day Jackson County has been inhabited for centuries. The Leo Petroglyph, located in the village of Leo, is a series of 37 human and animal stone engravings believed to date back to 1000 BCE. The county is within the Hanging Rock Iron Region. For much of the 1800s, this region was one of the leading iron producing sites in the country. Jefferson County is named for Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and the sitting Vice President at the time. Its county seat, Steubenville, is named after Fort Steuben, which hosted the first federal office in Ohio. One of the earliest Quaker congregations was formed in Jefferson County and served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. President Abraham Lincoln gave a speech in Jefferson County on his way to his first inauguration. For much of the 20th century, the county's economy was primarily built on coal and steel production. Knox County is named after General Henry Knox, a Revolutionary War general and the nation's first Secretary of War. One of Knox County's early residents was John Chapman, or \"Johnny Appleseed.\" He lived in the area from 1806 to 1828, when he moved on to western Ohio and Indiana. Many county residents joined the Union Army during the Civil War. One notable regiment featuring Knox County soldiers was the 96th Ohio Infantry. The unit traveled more than 9,000 miles to take part in battles between Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, making it one of the most traveled units in the war. Originally part of the Northwest Territory, Lake County is named for its connection to Lake Erie. It played an important part in the history of Mormonism. Joseph Smith, leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), settled in Kirtland and established the LDS headquarters there. The LDS built the Kirtland Temple, which has been standing since 1833. While the county is Ohio's smallest in terms of land area, it has the longest beach on Lake Erie. Mentor Marshes, the largest natural marshland remaining along the Lake Erie shoreline, was established as Ohio's first nature preserve in 1971. Lawrence County is Ohio's southernmost county. It is named after James Laurence, a naval captain during the War of 1812. The county became known for its iron production, with its first iron blast furnace built in the 1820s. Some of the iron used to build the U.S.S. Monitor, the first ironclad warship built for the U.S. Navy, came from Lawrence County furnaces. At the start of the Civil War, the state established Camp Ironton on the site of the county fairgrounds to help prepare troops for the war. Named for the Licking River, Licking County was originally part of neighboring Fairfield County. The Ohio and Erie Canal, a vital part of the nation's economy during the first half of the 19th century, broke ground near Newark in 1825. During the Civil War, the 76th Regiment of Ohio was comprised largely of Licking County residents. It fought at the battles of Shiloh and Vicksburg. In the 1900s, Licking was home to two of the country's most significant glass companies, the Heisey Glass Company and the American Bottle Company. Logan County is named for General Benjamin Logan, an early American war leader against Native American nations in present-day Ohio. Early settlers in Logan County were Revolutionary War veterans who had received tracts of land in the area in lieu of payment for their service in the war. Through the 1800s, the county was a major thoroughfare for the railroad industry, at one point hosting the largest railcar maintenance facility between New York and St. Louis. The first concrete street in the U.S. is in Bellefontaine. Paved in 1891, Court Avenue remains paved with the original concrete. An influential figure in Lorain County history was Heman Ely. Ely not only suggested the county name in homage of France's Lorraine region, but also donated the land where the first Lorain County Courthouse would be built. In 1833, Oberlin College was founded and immediately became a leading inclusive institution of higher education. Coed from its founding, it began admitting Black men and women in 1835, and graduated the first U.S. women to receive bachelor's degrees in 1841. Shipbuilding was the county's main industry for much of its history, beginning with timber ships in 1819 to steel vessels in 1981. The region that would become Lucas County was first settled by European colonists in the 1790s, after the Battle of Fallen Timbers ended the Northwest Indian Wars. Established in 1835, the county was named for then-governor Robert Lucas, who led the state during the outbreak of the Toledo War. This \"war\" was a border dispute between Ohio and the Michigan Territory over land that included strategically located Toledo. Lucas County was formed at the height of the conflict from the disputed land. With its proximity to Lake Erie, Detroit, and Chicago, the county soon grew into a transportation hub and industrial center. Madison County was named after James Madison, the fourth President of the U.S. The county's first white settler was Jonathan Alder. Alder had been captured by a Native American war party in Virginia and brought back to the area that is now Madison County. Growing up with the tribe, he served as an interpreter when additional white settlers began to enter the area. During the Civil War, men from the county served in the 1st Ohio Cavalry Regiment and the 113th Ohio Infantry Regiment, both of which took part in the March to the Sea campaign. Mahoning County draws its name from the Lenape word for \"at the licks,\" a reference to the salt licks on the shores of the Mahoning River. The early settlers in the area were from Connecticut and western Pennsylvania, including many Scots-Irish and French Calvinists. The first iron blast furnace in Ohio, constructed in 1803 in Poland Township, marked the beginning of the region's iron and steel industry. Throughout the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, Mahoning would become a major coal, iron, and steel industrial center. Marion County was named after Francis Marion, a general during the Revolutionary War. During the War of 1812, the county was the site of a U.S. Army fort to guard against Native American tribes who had allied with the British. The county also played an important part in the war effort during WWII. The Scioto Ordnance Plant and the Marion Engineer Depot were responsible for producing and shipping munitions, while Camp Marion served as a camp for German prisoners of war. The area that is now Medina County was once inhabited by the Clovis culture, one of the first cultures in North America. Artifacts found in the county date back more than 13,000 years. The county and its county seat are named after Medina, a Saudi Arabian city that is the second holiest city in Islam. The area has been historically rural, one of its most prominent businesses was founded in 1869 when Amos Ives Root founded the A.I. Root Company. It became a world-renowned beekeeping and candle-making company that advanced and promoted the knowledge of science of beekeeping. Meigs County is named in honor of Return Jonathan Meigs, Jr., the fourth governor of Ohio. The county was the site of the largest Civil War engagement to be fought in Ohio. Known as the Battle of Buffington Island, 3,000 Union men fought back a raiding group of 1,800 Confederates. The battle was a success for the Union and largely ended any attempt by the Confederacy to invade the Union. For much of the county's history, its economy was centered on coal mining, iron ore excavation, and salt processing. Mercer County is named after General Hugh Mercer, a Revolutionary War general who fell in the Battle of Princeton. St. Clair's Defeat, the U.S. Army's worst defeat by Native Americans and one of the earliest major military defeats in U.S. history, occurred in modern day Mercer County in 1791. When construction on the Miami and Erie Canal passed through the county, Grand Lake St. Marys was constructed to serve as a reservoir. At the time, it was the world's largest artificial lake. Miami County is named after the Native American tribe that once lived in the area. In 1752, a battle between the French and their allied Native American tribes and the British at Fort Pickawillany became a prelude to the French and Indian War. The Miami County city of Piqua sits near the site of the fort. White settlement in the county began in earnest after the Treaty of Greenville opened the area by relocating the Native American tribes that were living there. Monroe County was named after James Monroe, the Secretary of State at the time and a future president. Its rugged terrain in the Appalachian Mountains initially hindered its growth. In the 1870s, businessmen from Woodsfield sponsored the extension of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Monroe County. While the railway struggled financially, the discovery of oil and coal in the county helped keep it afloat. During the Vietnam War, the village of Beallsville lost 11 residents in the line of duty. Given its small population, this gave Beallsville the unfortunate distinction of suffering the war's highest known per-capita casualty rate. Montgomery County was named for Richard Montgomery, a Revolutionary War general. It prospered in the 19th century. Canals and turnpikes transformed it into a transportation hub, fueling Ohio industry. Aviation innovators Wilbur and Orville Wright developed designs for the first powered aircraft while running a Dayton bicycle shop. They tested their craft at nearby Huffman Fields. At the dawn of World War I, the U.S. Army established a center near Dayton to research military uses of aircraft. Its current name, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, honors the brothers as well as Lt. Frank Stuart Patterson, who was killed while conducting a training mission there during WWI. Morgan County gets its name from Daniel Morgan, a Revolutionary War officer who also helped suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Before the county was organized, it was the site of a major turning point for relations between the Native Americans and white settlers who came into the area. A battle at the settlement of Big Bottom resulted in the death of twelve settlers, including a woman and two children. The battle galvanized armed resistance to the Native American nations in the region, eventually culminating in the 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers, the deciding battle of the Northwest Indian Wars. Morrow County is named after Jeremiah Morrow, who served as Ohio's governor from 1822-1826. White settlers began to move into the area during the late 1810s, many of whom were Quakers. Morrow County gained national attention for his monetary support of the World War I war effort. The county won a national contest in 1918 by selling more War Savings Stamps than any county in the U.S. It won a similar statewide contest in 1919. An obelisk commemorating the citizens of Morrow County who fought in the war, as well as the county's support, was awarded to the county in 1919. Muskingum County's name comes from the Delaware tribe's word for \"near the river,\" which it shares with the river that flows through it. The county quickly grew thanks to its location on Zane's Trace, an early road through the Northwest Territory. For a two-year period, Muskingum County was the center of Ohio politics. In 1810, the state capital moved from Chillicothe to Zanesville. It later moved back to Chillicothe in 1812. During the 20th century, Muskingum County was known nationally as a leading pottery producer. The origin of Noble County's name is disputed. Some sources claim it refers to the Noble family that had settled in the area and for whom a township was already named. Others suggest that the name was chosen to appeal to state representative William P. Noble, who served as chairman of the committee on new counties. Noble County holds an unfortunate place in aviation. The U.S.S. Shenandoah, a naval airship, broke apart in the sky above Noble County and crashed there, killing 14 of its crew. The crash was one reason the U.S. Navy began to move away from rigid airships. Ottawa County's name is drawn from the Ottawa Tribe who lived in the area. The word itself means \"trader\" in the Ottawa language. The county borders Lake Erie, and one of the most important battles in the War of 1812 occurred off the shores of the county. In the Battle of Lake Erie, Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry led the U.S. Navy fleet to victory over a squadron of British warships. At least one battle in the War of 1812 was also fought within the county. The Ohio National Guard's main training base, Camp Perry, is named for Commodore Perry. Paulding County is named after John Paulding, a New York militaman who helped capture Major John Andre. Andre was a British spy who assisted the treasonous Benedict Arnold. The county's early economy was dependent on logging, as the thick forests in the area were well suited to provide timber for ship masts. The county grew with the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal and the Wabash and Erie Canal, both of which flowed through Paulding County. The county was once covered by the Great Black Swamp. After the swamp was drained, Paulding County's economy shifted primarily towards agriculture. Perry County is named for Oliver Hazard Perry, a War of 1812 naval commander. In 1884, striking coal miners pushed burning carts into the mines around New Straitsville, causing them to catch fire. The fire, dubbed \"The World's Greatest Mine Fire,\" continues to burn. Perry County was the site of many breakthroughs for Black Ohioans. Dr. Isaiah Tuppins, the first Black man to earn a medical degree in Ohio, became the state's first Black mayor in 1888. In 1969, Sophia Mitchell became the first Black woman elected mayor. Both Tuppins and Mitchell served as mayors of the village of Rendville. Pickaway County is named after a branch of the Shawnee Tribe, the Piqua. The area was once a center of the Hopewell culture, which thrived from 100 BCE to 500 CE. Circleville, the county seat, was built atop a Hopewell earthwork, with the city's original layout following the contours of the earthwork. During the Civil War, county residents served in the 90th and 114th Ohio Infantry regiment, both of which fought in pivotal battles such as Vicksburg and General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea. Pike County is named after explorer and military officer Zebulon Pike, who helped explore the Louisiana Purchase and for whom Pikes Peak is named. The area was once inhabited by the ancient Mound Builders and, later, by the Shawnee. One of the first European settlers in the area was Hezekiah Merritt, who moved to the area in 1795 to grow corn. The county has long been primarily agricultural, but in 1953, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission located a gaseous diffusion plant there. The plant produced enriched uranium for the nuclear weapons program and, as the Cold War ended, commercial reactors. Portage County's name is derived from the seven-mile Native American portage path between the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas Rivers, on which early travelers carried their boats overland. Like many Northeastern Ohio counties, Portage County was originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve. As settlement continued, a number of unique industries developed in Portage County. Garrettsville was a center of maple syrup production by the 1880s, and the Silver Creek Cheese Factory was a leading cheese producer, shipping over four million pounds of cheese in 1904. Today, Portage County is a source of higher education, hosting both Kent State University and Hiram College. Names throughout Preble County have an intimate connection with the Tripolitan War, the first overseas military endeavor in U.S. history. The county itself is named after Edward Preble, who served as the Commander of the American Naval Fleet during the war, while the county seat is named after William Eaton, who served as the consul general to Tunis during the war. Preble County is rural and raises the most cattle of any county in the state. Putnam County draws its name from Israel Putnam, a veteran of the French and Indian War who later served with distinction as a U.S. army officer during the Revolutionary War. The county seat, Ottawa, is named after the Ottawa Native American tribe. The Ottawa lived throughout the area along the Blanchard River, including the land that makes up the present-day city of Ottawa. Following Putnam County's creation, agriculture became its dominant industry. Over 90 percent of the county's land area is under cultivation today. Richland County was established on land that was opened to settlement by colonists after the 1805 Treaty of Fort Industry. The first permanent white settler in the area arrived two years later, in 1807. So named for its fertile soil, Richland was originally covered predominantly by forests. The early residents cleared many of the forests to use the land for agriculture. During the Civil War, Camp Bartley (on the site of the Ohio State Reformatory) was used to house individuals who were arrested for opposing the war or dodging the draft. Before Europeans reached the Western Hemisphere, the Ross County area was a center of the Hopewell culture, which thrived from 100 BCE and 500 CE. Ross County is named after James Ross, who was a senator from Pennsylvania at the time. The county played a key role in the early history of state government. Chillicothe served as Ohio's capital from 1800 (when Ohio was still a territory) to 1810 and hosted the first Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802. After a brief move to Zanesville, the capital returned to Chillicothe from 1812 to 1816, before settling in Columbus. Scioto County is named after the river of the same name that flows through it, which in turn got its name from the Wyandot Nation's word for \"deer.\" Thanks to its position at the intersection of the Scioto River and the Ohio River, the county was prosperous in its early days, when river travel was the fastest means to transport goods. Some river counties struggled as the canal system gave way to rail lines. Scioto County, however, was located at the site of an important junction for two major railroads and continued to enjoy economic prosperity through the early 1800s. Seneca County draws its name from the Seneca Native American nation, the westernmost nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. The land comprising Seneca County originally was set aside for native peoples as part of the Treaty of Greenville. Settlement by white settlers accelerated in the 19th century as the Great Black Swamp was drained. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the discovery of abundant natural gas deposits led to a robust glass-making industry in the Fostoria area. Today, Seneca County is known for agriculture, manufacturing, and higher education. At the nation's founding, the area that would become Shelby County was inhabited by Native Americans, including the Shawnee, Iroquois, and Seneca-Cayuga. The county is named for Isaac Shelby, a Revolutionary War leader and the first governor of Kentucky. While the county's first white residents were Americans heading west, the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal soon brought an influx of immigration, primarily from England and Germany. After World War II, Shelby residents created the Neighbors in Action program, which prepared and donated 8,000 food packages to Germany to aid its recovery. Stark County is believed to be the site of the earliest European settlement in Ohio. French explorers traveled the area in 1669, and members of the Moravian Church settled in the 1760s. It is named for General John Stark, a Revolutionary War hero who defeated the British at the Battle of Bennington. The first Black settlement in the county was in Lexington Township. Called New Guinea, it was home to about 200 free Black people and freedom seekers. The county boasts many museums, including the First Ladies National Historic Site, located at the home of Ida McKinley, and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Summit was named for Akron's Portage Summit, the highest point on the Ohio and Erie Canal. Originally part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, the region was ceded to the Northwest Territory in 1800. When the Ohio and Erie Canal was completed in 1832, Summit became an important hub for travel from the east coast to the Ohio River and beyond. The county's abundant coal, iron ore, and steel drove development. In the 19th century, Akron became an important producer of rubber, cereal, and other products. Home to tire companies B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, and Goodyear, Akron was known as \"Rubber Capital of the World.\" The land encompassing Trumbull County, as well as much of Northeast Ohio, was originally claimed by Connecticut. This area was known as the \"Western Reserve.\" Following the organization of the Northwest Territory, Connecticut sold its stake in the Western Reserve to private development. Trumbull and other counties were then organized. Trumbull County is named for Jonathan Trumbull, who served as Connecticut's governor during the American Revolution. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Trumbull County developed into a center for manufacturing and industry, particularly steel production. Tuscarawas County derives its name from a Native American word translated as \"open mouth.\" Interactions between white settlers and Native American nations constituted much of Tuscarawas County's early history. Some of the earliest settlers in the county were German-speaking Moravian missionaries who sought to convert the native peoples who lived there. Early settlements from the 1770s include their German-named villages of Schoenbrunn and Gnadenhutten. Later, a group of separatists fleeing persecution in Germany established the village of Zoar, becoming known as the Zoarites. Today, portions of both Schoenbrunn and Zoar are maintained as historic sites. Union County was formed in 1820 from parts of Franklin, Delaware, Logan, and Madison Counties. Colonel James Curry, who represented the area at the time, lobbied the Ohio legislature for the formation of the county. The founders chose its name to represent the \"union\" of these counties. While the first meeting of the Union County commissioners took place in 1820, construction on the county's first courthouse did not begin until 1835. Over the years, the county has cultivated rich manufacturing and agricultural industries. Van Wert County is named for Isaac Van Wart, one of three men who captured the British spy John Andre during the Revolutionary War. In the late 1890s, the county made history as the site of the first countywide library in the U.S. A local businessman named John Sanford Brumback bequeathed funds to build it. The Great Black Swamp once covered part of modern-day Van Wert County, giving it the fertile soil the county is known for. As a result, Van Wert County is heavily rural. Nearly 90% of the county's land is used to grow crops. Vinton County draws its name from Samuel Finley Vinton, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio during the 1800s. The county's landscape has changed since its founding. It was an early hotspot for iron production, and producing the charcoal required to power the iron furnaces resulted in the deforestation of parts of the region. Trees returned to the area the 1800s, when iron production slowed as higher-quality ore was discovered elsewhere. The county also became a prominent ceramic producer in the 1800s, manufacturing both pottery and bricks. Warren County is named for General Joseph Warren, a hero of the American Revolution. Warren dispatched Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride and was later killed in the Battle of Bunker Hill. Warren County's early days in the early 19th century were modest. Lebanon's \"Black Horse Tavern,\" a simple log structure, served the role of inn, merchant's building, courthouse, and center of county government. Today, Warren County is one of Ohio's fastest-growing counties. Prominent employers in the county include Proctor and Gamble, Macy's Credit and Customer Service, and the corporate headquarters of LensCrafters. Washington County is named for George Washington, commander of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and the first U.S. President. Ohio's first permanent settlement, Marietta, was founded in the area that would become Washington County in 1788. Settlement began in earnest after the Revolutionary War, when Congress compensated veterans with Ohio land grants instead of money. The county was formally established just four weeks after the U.S. Constitution was ratified, making it the first county carved from the Northwest Territory. Wayne County is named for General \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne. Wayne served during the American Revolution and in the Northwest Indian Wars, during which he led U.S. forces to victory at the decisive 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. Wayne County was drawn before Ohio became a state and originally spanned much of northern Ohio and Michigan. Modern-day boundaries were established in 1808. Amish community members were some of the county's earliest residents. An emphasis on production agriculture continues in Wayne County to this day, as it is home to the Ohio State University's Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Williams County was named after David Williams, one of the captors of the British spy John Andre during the Civil War. The county has been occupied for millennia. The Nettle Lake Mound group dates to the Hopewell culture, which lived in the area from 300 BCE to 500 CE. Like other Northwestern counties, a portion of Williams County was at the center of the \"Toledo War\" border dispute between Ohio and Michigan in the 1830s. Williams County is heavily rural, with more than three-fourths of its land used for crops or pasture. Wood County is named after Captain Eleazer D. Wood. Wood constructed Fort Meigs in modern-day Perrysburg under the command of General William Henry Harrison during the War of 1812. The fort later repelled attacks by the British army and its Native American allies. Following the war and the draining of the Great Black Swamp, which covered Wood County, the county quickly became a center for agricultural production. Later in the 1890s, an oil and natural gas boom brought further development to the county, spurring population growth and manufacturing and commercial development."
