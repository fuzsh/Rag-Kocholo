        "text": "Where is the Brown County Common Pleas Courthouse?\n\nThe Courthouse is located at 101 South Main St., Georgetown, OH. 45121.\n\nIs parking free?\n\nYes, there is free parking on the streets surrounding the courthouse. There is no single court parking lot. DO NOT PARK in the spots directly in back of the courthouse, as these are reserved for probation and police vehicles.\n\nWhen is the court open?\n\nThe Court is open for operation from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.Monday through Friday and Saturdays (if need be) at the direction of the Judge, and closed on Sundays and all legal holidays. It is generally a good idea to arrive at the courthouse early to go through security and find the right courtroom.\n\nHow can I go through security without a long delay?\n\nAll visitors to the Courthouse must pass through the security metal detectors at the front entrance. No one may enter the building with a cell phone or any other audio or video recording devices, any and all types of knives (no matter how small), scissors, box cutters, etc. or other weapons. No aerosol cans are permitted in the building. If you bring these items to the courthouse, you will be ordered to take them back to your vehicle. You can reduce delay in getting through the checkpoint if you avoid wearing work boots with steel toes or steel shanks, and coats or jackets with lots of metal zippers or chains. Please make sure all pockets are empty, watches and large jewelry items such as bracelets, necklaces, watches, and earrings are removed and placed in the plastic tubs for X-ray screening.\n\nWhere are the courtrooms?\n\nThe CriminalDivision is located on the second floor of the courthouse. Domestic Relations Division and the Civil Division are located on the first floor as you enter the courthouse from the front door, Main St.\n\nI don’t get around well because of my health. Can I still access the courthouse?\n\nYes. The courthouse is renovated and is accessible to individuals with canes, walkers, or crutches. The facility is wheelchair accessible. There is an elevator that serves the criminal courtroom floor. If there are very special needs that you have, please contact the Court in advance to make arrangements.\n\nWhere can I find the court schedule?\n\nThe Assignment Officers print a weekly docket listing for all court proceedings, which is posted outside the door of the courtrooms; all docket listings are also located at the front security desk. You may also access the court dockets on our website, browncountyohiocommonpleascourt.us\n\nWhere are the restrooms?\n\nThere is a restroom located on the basement floor of the courthouse.\n\nCan I come to court just to watch?\n\nYes. By law, the courts in Ohio are generally open to the public; you may sit in the back of the courtroom and watch a trial or hearing. In rare instances, a courtroom may be closed to public access. You must enter the courtroom prior to the starting of the case. Once the courtroom door is closed and hearings are in session, you may not enter until the courtroom door is reopened.\n\nI’m coming to court as a witness. Can I use my laptop while waiting?\n\nYes.\n\nI have some legal questions. Can someone at the court give me answers?\n\nNo. The Judge, Magistrates and the court staff are not permitted to give you legal advice. You are permitted to research legal matters at the Brown County Law Library located in the Georgetown Public Library at 200 West Grant Ave.\n\nAre kids allowed in court?\n\nIt might be a better idea to leave young children at home or with relatives. Court proceedings can last longer than a child’s patience, and it is important to avoid interruptions to the Court’s business. Please remember that the Judge is not influenced in making any sentencing decisions by the physical presence or absence of children.\n\nCan I smoke while I’m in the Courthouse?\n\nNo. The Brown County Common Pleas Courthouse is a non-smoking building, as are all government buildings in Brown County. You are permitted to smoke outside the courthouse.\n\nWhat should I wear to court?\n\nBecause participating in a court proceeding or being a witness is an important and solemn obligation as a citizen, please wear comfortable clothing that enhances the dignity of the Court and emphasizes the seriousness of your responsibility. Business casual attire is suggested. Shorts, mini-skirts, hats, tank tops, and shirts with suggestive language or logos are considered inappropriate attire for the courtroom. Temperatures between the jury room and individual courtroom can fluctuate, so you may want to bring a sweater or jacket with you.\n\nIf I have to pay my traffic ticket, where do I go?\n\nBrown County Municipal Court handles routine traffic cases, not Common Pleas. For traffic court matters, go to the Brown County Municipal Court at 770 Mt. Orab Pike, Georgetown. The Municipal Court’s website is www.browncountycourt.org\n\nI want to pay my taxes. Is the Auditor’s Office here?\n\nNo. The Auditor’s Office is located at the Administration Building, 800 Mt. Orab Pike, Georgetown.\n\nWhere do I get a marriage license?\n\nYou can obtain a marriage license at Probate Court, which is not in this courthouse. The address is 510 E. State St., Georgetown. Probate Court can be reached at (937) 378-6549.\n\nWhere do I get an auto, truck, or boat title?"
