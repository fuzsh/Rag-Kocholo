        "text": "PREFACE\n\nTHE generation of hardy men who first settled the region comprising Brown County has nearly all passed away. The names and deeds of those who encountered the perils of Indian warfare, endured the privations of pioneer life and, with rifles by their sides, cleared away the giants of the forest, rescuing from savages and wild beasts the lands the present generation possesses in peace, should not be forgotten. It is the purpose of this volume to give the history of their achievements, and to record the growth and development of this county, that the present and future generations may know something ofwhat it cost to give them this fair land, and who were the brave men and noble women who converted a wilderness into the smiling region we now behold.\n\nThe volume has been prepared in strict accordance with the announcement made in the prospectus of the work. Brit/ histories of the Northwest Territory and the State of Ohio are first given. The outline history of the county contained in Part III was prepared by Josiah Morrow, the author of the history of Warren County, recently published. Mr. Morrow has devoted much attention for several years past to the history of the Miami Valley. In collecting materials for this work, he has examined the records of the county, explored the earlier history of the original counties from which Brown was formed, and searched out every book, pamphlet and manuscript relating to the history of the Virginia Military District in the State Library at Columbus; the Library of the Ohio Historical and Philosophical Society ; the Young Men's Mercantile Library and the Public Library at Cincinnati.\n\nThe township histories contained in Part IV are designed to chronicle the annals of each neighborhood, thus rescuing from oblivion much interesting and valuable local history that would otherwise be lost through the death of early settlers and the ravages of time. Interest in local annals has much increased in recent years. The joint resolution of Congress in 1876, recommending the preparation of a sketch of the history of each town and county to be preserved in the Library of Congress, gave an impetus to local historical studies. In addition to the writers of the township histories, whose names are placed at the head of their articles, grateful acknowledgments are due to Dr. I. M. Beck, of Sardinia, and Peter L. Wilson, Esq., of Georgetown, for valuable assistance and suggestions.\n\nThe biographical sketches in Part V were prepared for the most part by the soliciting agents of the publishers, The personal and family histories given in these sketches may be found in succeeding years to possess an interest and value, which will cause the book to be much sought' after by explorers in genealogies and pedigrees. The study of family history is not for the purpose of ministering to an aristocratic pride ; it is perfectly consistent with democratic simplicity and Christian humility. It is not necessary to have noble blood in our veins to give us an intelligent interest in our\n\niv - PREFACE.\n\nancestral relations. It is desirable that the genealogical story of at least every old and long-settled family in each county should be recorded in a form both permanent and readily accessible.\n\nThe writers have faithfully aimed at accuracy, but he who expects to find the work entirely free from errors or defects has little knowledge of the difficulties attending the preparation of a work of this kind. To procure its materials, its compilers have explored many hundred pages of manuscripts and written records. In some cases, it was necessary to reconcile contradictory statements. Some errors are unavoidable. The publishers trust that the book will be received in that generous spirit which is gratified at honest efforts, and not in that captious spirit which refuses to be satisfied short of unattainable perfection.\n\nTo the county officers, town and township officers, editors, members of the bar, and many intelligent citizens of Brown County, the publishers are indebted for favors and generous assistance.\n\nTHE PUBLISHERS.\n\nCONTEANTS.\n\nPART I & II NOTED INCLUDED.\n\nThese Parts are found in other county histories.\n\nPART III.\n\nHISTORY OF BROWN COUNTY."
