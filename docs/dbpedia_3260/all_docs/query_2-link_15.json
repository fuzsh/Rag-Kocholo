        "text": "David \"JP4\" Fisher is a character role-played by SergeantWumbo.\n\nOrigins[]\n\nDavid Fisher was born in rural Michigan, in the winter of 1995. He grew up a normal boy, getting in trouble, going to school and making friends. It was his thirteenth birthday when he was gifted a dirt bike, and he instantly fell in love. He began racing in small tournaments, and quickly got better, to the point of winning most of them. This garnered attention from some local racing teams, one of which he joined. He was gaining traction in the racing world. His days consisted of school, and dirt bike practice when he got home. Life was good.\n\nOne weekend morning, David's father was making breakfast when he heard a loud crack come from outside. He knew David was outside practicing his biking skills, and ran outside. He found David, head split open, from a dirt bike crash. There was a thunder storm the night before, and one of the trees on his familiar trail through the woods near his house had fallen over. David had hit it, and flew into a different tree, splitting his head. He was rushed to the hospital, where a brain surgeon had to operate on him. That day will be etched into both his father's and his memory for the rest of their lives.\n\nAfter the surgery, he had to re-learn most of his daily activities. It took a lot of effort from everyone involved, but one thing about him did not see right. It seemed that David had trouble making decisions for himself. If someone told him to do anything, he would do it without hesitation. On top of this, the hospital bills kept piling up, forcing him and his father to move to a low-income development in a nearby city. Word of David's condition quickly got out to the local gangs and organizations. He was taken advantage of quickly after, being told to peddle drugs and murder. David's crimes caught up with him soon after, and he was sentenced to life. Over crowding of the prison he was in cause him to be selected to be deported to an island called Los Santos, never to return. He flew into Los Santos on September 17th, 2022 for the first time.\n\nCrime[]\n\nFisher quickly got into the crime life of Los Santos, even helping rob a bank within his first week of being in the city, after being taken under Zee Davis' wing. He met Zee his first day in the city, along with Jay Gamble, who eventually recruited him into GSF. Some of his favorite activities include boosting, pushing drugs, and robbing houses.\n\nHe also managed to meet Connell Macgregor, a member of RUST who took him along on various activities.\n\nGang life[]\n\nAt first, Fisher was trying to join RUST as his schedule lined up nicely with theirs and he really liked and vibed with the members. Unfortunately, Fisher's schedule was changed and he wasn't able to meet up with Macgregor or any RUST members for about six months.\n\nDuring this time, he got closer to Jay Gamble, a friend he had met his first day in the city. Jay was a Goon in GSF, and recruited Fisher as his hang around. Fisher quickly got into the GSF lifestyle. He enjoyed pushing meth on Forum Drive and holding down the block. He participated in the Street Team/Chang Gang war, and helped with the very short Mayhem war. He got promoted to Prospect after showing he was dedicated to helping GSF with their activities.\n\nSoon after being promoted to prospect, GSF went to war with RUST. Fisher did not participate in this war, as he knew that GSF were not prepared for it, and even spoke to RUST members about potentially leaving GSF. After Fisher found out about Billy Sprinkle shooting Mr. K in the middle of an already losing war, he decided his time with The Families was over, and left."
