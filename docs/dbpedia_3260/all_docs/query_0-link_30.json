        "text": "This township lies in the north-west corner of the county. It was organized Jan. 2, 183, by taking a territory from the west side of Scott, four by six miles, and from the north end of Wayne, four by two miles, making an area of thirty-two square miles. It was called Winchester, from the village of that name embraced within its limits.\n\nSURFACE.\n\nIts surface is moderately rolling, but somewhat hilly along the water courses. the soil is a clay of medium fertility, that in early years, produced fair crops of corn and wheat, which were the farmer's principal reliance for money. This continued cropping of grain after awhile began to exhaust the soil and other methods of farming became necessary. For the last few years more attention has been paid to stock raising, and with good results. commercial fertilizers have, also, been successfully applied to the lands. with more attention to stock raising, and proper methods of farming, this would be a good agricultural township.\n\nCREEKS.\n\nThe principal stream is the west branch of brush creek which passes nearly centrally through it from west to east. It received its name from the original forests that lined its banks.\n\nLIMESTONE,\n\nWhich underlies the whole area of the township, crops out in endices quantities all along the banks of Brush creek, is of easy access, and when burned in kilns makes a superior quality of lime for plastering and other mechanical purposes.\n\nEARLY SETTLERS.\n\nIt is generally more or less difficult to ascertain with certainty, who were the first settlers in a community, or just when, or where they located. As near as can be gathered it is probable the first in this township came about 1805. It is supposed that McIntire was the first man who settled within its present limits. He came in 1805, and located about a mile and a half south of where the village of Winchester now stands. Israel Rhodes and Andrew Clemmer came in the same year, and located in the same neighborhood.\n\nFIRST CHURCHES.\n\nThe first church built in the township was the M. E. church, erected in 1830.\n\nThe second one was the Baptist, built in 1831. This was a brick edifice, and is now used as a wagon shop. The society, however, retains an organization, and has another house of worship. The third church was built by the Presbyterians in 1839.\n\nTHE FIRST SCHOOL HOUSE.\n\nThe first school house was log cabin, that stood where the village cemetery is now located.\n\nFIRST TEACHER.\n\nThe first teacher was Richard Cross. He taught in the above mentioned log school houses.\n\nJUSTICES OF THE PEACE.\n\nThe following is a list of the Justices of the Peace, who have served since the organization of the township; William McNeal, Samuel Homes, Rezin T. Fowler, Richard Ramsey, (Mr. Ramsey, who is now acting, has served in that capacity 27 years), William Long, Turner Osborne. A. Mr. Thomas was elected, and served a few months in 1861, and resigned.\n\nFIRST MILLS.\n\nThe first mill was built in 1809 or '10, by Richard Cross, near the north-east corner of South Winchester. It was propelled by horse power.\n\nThe second one was a tramp mill, located on Main street, erected by Ezra Sparks in 1820.\n\nThe first water mill was started on Brush creek in 1820, by Joseph Mariatt, and the second one by Stephen Tolle, in 1835, on Elk Run.\n\nThe first saw-mill was built by Joel Bailey, in 1825, on Elk Run, a mile an a half east of the village.\n\nThere are at present but two grist mills in the township: Thomas M. Young's steam mill in the village, and James M. Rees', situated on Brush creek, 2½ miles east of Winchester. It runs by water and steam.\n\nFIRST PHYSICIANS.\n\nThe first physician to locate in the village was Dr. Mahan, who came in 1832.\n\nThe second one was Dr. A. C. Lewis, who came in 1835.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nThe township exclusive of the village, is divided into seven sub-districts, with a school enumeration in 1878, of 261 children of school age, as follows: White males, 150; white female, 109; colored males, 2.\n\n[Page 55]\n\nINDEPENDENT AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL ASSOCIATION OF ADAMS, BROWN AND HIGHLAND COUNTIES, OHIO.\n\nThis is a joint stock company, incorporated under the laws of he State, in1859.\n\nMoses J. Patterson, Edward E. Wilkins, George H. Dixon and I. H. deBruin were the incorporators. It has a paid up capital of $3,985. The original subscribed stock was $6,000, in shares of $5. It owns twenty acres of land, one-half mile south of the village of Winchester, arranged with all the necessary conveniences, where its annual fairs are held.\n\nIt held its first fair, Oct. 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th, 1860. Its usual attendance is from 8,000 to 15,000 people. The first dividend to stock holders was made in1865, since which, there ha been annual dividends, amounting in all to $1,241 on the paid up stock. It is in a Flourishing condition, well managed, and profitable to the association.\n\nCHURCHES\n\nThere are in the township seven churches, four in the village, and three in the country.\n\nThose in the village are; One Methodist Episcopal, one Disciple, one Presbyterian, one Baptist.\n\nIn the country are: One Methodist Episcopal, called \"Centennial;\" one Methodist Protestant, called \"Calvary;\" one Christian church, called \"Oakland.\"\n\nWINCHESTER VILLAGE.\n\nThis is the only village in the township. It was laid out by Joseph Darlinton, Nov. 8, 1815, on a plat of 70 lots. Mr. Darlinton came from Winchester, Virginia, hence the name of his new town.\n\nThe first sale of lots was at auction, Nov. 28, 1815.\n\nOn the 10th and 12th days of August, 1833, Joel Bailey surveyed and laid off an addition of 82 lots, with a public square, containing 80 square rods. This addition is known as South Winchester. Richard Cross was the surveyor.\n\nThe village was incorporated in 1865, and is now governed by corporation laws, with officers to execute them.\n\nFIRST HOUSE.\n\nThe first house in the limits of the village, was built by Mr. Mcintire in 1807, before the town was laid out. It was of hewed logs; was weather-boarded by Hamilton Dunbar in 1832; is still in a good state of preservation, and at this date - 1880 - is owned by occupied by David Young as a dwelling.\n\nFIRST STORES.\n\nThe first store was opened by James and Joseph Bailey in 1818 or '19. It was on lot 44, opposite the Post office. The property is now owned by Mrs. M. J. Snodeker.\n\nThe second one was started by - Cunningham, on the east side of Main street. The building in which it was carried on, has long since been removed.\n\nOIL MILL AND CARDING MILL\n\nIn 1831, Levi Sparks built an oil mill and carding mill where he made flax seed oil and carded wool. They were operated by Milton Cutter until 1840, when the manufacture of oil became unprofitable and it was discontinued. The carding was, was continued, and the mill passed through several hands until 1852, when M. J. Patterson became proprietor, who built in connection with it a flouring mill, which he carried on until in the fall of 1863, when the mill, carding machinery and tannery adjoining, were all consumed by fire.\n\nMr. Patterson was a member of the Legislature in 1860-61. He entered the army early in the war. He died on Cheat Mountain in 1862.\n\nHOTELS.\n\nJoseph Eyler started the first hotel in the village about 1810. It stood on the north-west corner of South street. The property is now owned by John Erthal.\n\nThe second tavern was owned by Lindsey Gossett, about 1830. It stood on the opposite side of the street from the first one.\n\nThe third one was started by Mr. Goldsbury in 1834, in a brick building now owned by A. L. Robbins.\n\nThere are at the present time four hotels, kept by the following proprietors: D. F. Wilson, John Bradley, William Long, Mrs. Stevenson.\n\nTANNERIES.\n\nThe first tannery was started in 1812 by Joseph Eylar, by whom it was carried on until near the time of his death in 1851. It was soon after discontinued.\n\nThe next one was started by Andrew Davidson, about 1835. L. H. de Bruin has owned this establishment for several years, and worked it until within a few months past. It is still in complete order, though at present idle.\n\nPOST OFFICES.\n\nThere are two post offices in the township, Winchester and Emerald.\n\nWINCHESTER.\n\nWas established about 1820, and called Scott, from the name of the township in which it was then being a part of Scott. The office retained this name until Apr. 1, 1830, when it was changed to Winchester.\n\nThe first Postmaster was Joseph Eylar, who served until 1841, when he was succeeded by James Sparks; the third was Isaac Prutzman; the fourth, John Frow,1847-61; the fifth, Jos.

Clark.\n\nThe history of the Winchester public schools extends over a period of seventy-two years, during the first fifty-seven of which it existed as a sub-district, first of Scott, then of Winchester township. A correct chronology of the events of this period would be difficult to obtain. No certain record can be found, and we are forced to rely solely upon the personal recollections of individuals.\n\nFor thirty years prior to the organization of Winchester township in 1838, the school was a sub-district of Scott township. From 1838 to 1865, it was known as \"District No,\" of Winchester township. In 1865 it was organized into a special district. Under this new organization, which was that of schools in corporate villages, it had six directors and a board of examiners. This special board of examiners was discontinued several years ago.\n\nThe first school house within the present limits of the village was a log house built in 1808, upon a little eminence east of town. This knoll is now the cemetery grounds; and the graves of Judge Eylar and wife mark the site of the building. This house was used for school and church purposes for eighteen years. In 1826 another building for school purposes was erected on the public square. This was also a log structure, and is still standing in the rear of the residence of J. A. Lemons. It was occupied until 1848. In 1839 the Legislature by a special act authorized the sale of the building, together with the ground upon which it stood, Col. Wm. Robbins, H. I. de Bruin, Esq., and Dr. N. D. Thompson were appointed commissioners for that purpose. They effected a sale, and applied the proceeds to the erection of a new building. A lot of land was bought of J. M. Darlinton, on the west side of town; and on it was erected a one-story brick building of one room, the third school house built for the district. This building was used for school purposes until 1855, when it was found to be insufficient for the accommodation of the district, and was sold. It is now occupied by David Fisher as a private residence. Thos. Ramsey was the contractor for the new building, and received eight hundred dollars and the old house for building the new one. This house is a frame with two rooms, and a hall, and was built upon a lot 13 rods square, purchased of James Dunlap for $30.50. It was occupied until 1871, when the present building was erected. The present house is the fifth school house built for the district. It is a two-story brick, 32x68, containing [four commodious rooms and hall ways, and cost $4,000. The frame house after being sold and passing through several parties hands, was finally purchased by the school board, and is now used for the colored school,\n\nThe first teacher who taught in the district - in the log cabin on the cemetery grounds - was Richard Cross. This school was taught in 1808. For forty years following that time one teacher seems to have been sufficient, but he undoubtedly had at times a full school. In the records of 1847, is found the following: Report of Quarter of Schools, commencing Aug. 2d. and ending Oct. 22d, 1847:\n\nNo. in attendance ...........95\n\nMales ........................50\n\nFemales .....................45\n\nAverage daily attendance 60 1-6\n\nOct. 23, 1847\n\nA. C. Di_old, Teacher.\"\n\nOne man taught this school for less than $25 per month! From 1848 to 1855, the date of the building of the fourth school house, two teachers were employed for the schools, with one or two exceptions. Since the year 1855, the number employed in the while schools, has in one or two instances reached four. The following persons have held the position of principal teacher since the organization of the special district, in 1865:\n\nJohn B. Campbell.........1865-66\n\nJohn Rea.......................1866-67\n\nC. L. Bennett................1867-68\n\nL. J. Fenton.................. 1868-69\n\nG. F.

Adams, Term Expires, 1881\n\nWm. Smith, Treas. \" \" 1881\n\nJ. H. Bradford, \" \" 1882\n\nN. R. Thompson, Clerk, \" \" 1882\n\nJ. W. Rothrock \" \" 1883\n\nA. L. Robins, Pres., \" \" 1883\n\nThe enumeration for the year 1879, shows a school population of 181, of which 14 are colored. The schools are in session about eight months in the year.\n\nHISTORY OF THE WINCHESTER BAPTIST CHURCH.\n\nBy The Pastor.\n\nThe history of this church cannot be given as fully as is desirable, owing to the fact that there are several breaks in the records of its earlier transactions; we give, however, its history, with as much regularity and consecutiveness as the records will permit.\n\nThe first church meeting, of which the records give account, was held at the house of Spencer Records, south of Fincastle, Brown county, O., Sept. 18th, 1813. At this meeting Elder Chas. B. Smith was called to the pastorate of the church, and Brother Records was chosen Deacon, and Brother Laycock, Clerk of the church. On the 28th of August, 1814, the church held a meeting at the house of Brother Records, at which, the church chose to be known as the Regular Baptist church at Brush creek, in Adams county, State of Ohio; and adopted the Articles of Faith. The constituent members signing the Articles of Faith at that meeting were as follows:\n\nJohn Murphy, Mary Murphy, Solomon Sparks, Catherine Sparks, Spencer Records, Elizabeth Records, John Pile, Rebecca Pile, William Laycock, Mary Barngrover, Abraham Thomas and Rachel Bailey.\n\nBrother Thomas was the first person baptized by the church, his baptism occurring in June, 1814. From this date to 1818, the church met very irregularly and with but little success, Elder Chas. B. Smith continuing with them as Pastor. On the 23d of May, 1818, the church dissolved, and on Jan. 28th, 1820, a meeting was held at the house of Bro. Spencer Records, at which time a reorganization of the church was consummated on their former Articles of Faith. There were present at this reorganization of the church, Spencer Records, Deacon; Wm. Laycock, Clerk ; Solomon Sparks, Abraham Thomas, Henry Pile, Elizabeth Records and Catherine Sparks. At this meeting the church dismissed b\\ letter Brother and Sister Records, and Brother Wm. Laycock. From 1826 to April 20th, 1828, the church failed, through various causes, to have meetings. Elder H. Johnson began to preach for the church about this time, whether as pastor or not, the records do not state. During the time that Elder Johnson preached for the church, there were received by baptism 18, and 15 by letter and experience. The Strict creek Association held its first session with this church, August, 1829. In 1830, the church began to build a meeting house, and appointed John Wallace, Salomon Sparks and Nathaniel Cloud, Trustees, to attend to the building of the new church house, to be erected on a lot in Winchester, purchased of Samuel Bawldrige. Brother Rhoads was also afterward appointed as Trustee of the church. The church had no pastor, so far as His records show, until 1832, but during the interval Elders Johnson, Smith, Spohn and others, preached occasionally for them. Elder Hiram Bennett was called to the pastorate in June, 1832, and continued his labors with the church about nine years. During his pastorate about 150 were received by baptism, 60 dismissed by letter, and 15 excluded.\n\nElder Wm. Allgood was called to take charge of the church in Sept. 1841, and entered upon his pastoral labors Nov., 1841. He resigned in July, 1848, the church having received during his pastorate, 5 by baptism, 9 by letter, dismissed by letter, 25, and excluded 9.\n\nAt the September meeting, 1848, Elder Eli Fry was called, and partial arrangements made, but were dissolved at the next meeting. In Nov., 1851, the church called Elder James Gabri c to the pastorate, who began his labors at once, and continued to\n\nPage 56 -\n\nserve the church until 1863. While Elder Gabriel was pastor, the church received 28 by baptism and 13 by letter; dismissed by letter, 37, and excluded 6.\n\nElder Gilman Stone, a licentiate of Providence, R. I., was soon after called, and was ordained in July, 1853. He resigned in April, 1854, and th3 church immediately recalled Elder Gabriel, who continued until Sept. 1855. During the pastorate of Elder Stone and the second pastorate of Elder Gabriel the church received by baptism, 3; dismissed by letter, 17; excluded 1. On the 27th of February, 1830, the church agree to build a brick church in Winchester, 30x40 feet, and the building committee report the house completed Jan., 1833.\n\nIn Oct., 1855, Elder Huson took charge of the church, and at their meeting the following month the church resolved to build a new meeting house, 36x54 feet, with 14 feet to ceiling. The building committee consisted of Samuel McNeil, Ezra Sparks, Jas. Carson and B. C. Colburn, who were instructed to sell the old house and lot, and to purchase a new site for the new building. This, the second house of worship built by the church, was dedicated the 29th of March, 1857.\n\nDuring the time that Elder Huson was pastor, the church received 5 by letter, and dismissed 4 by letter. Elder Samuel Wallace next took charge of the church in 1857, and resigned March, 1861. While he was pastor the church received 55 by baptism, 15 by letter, and excluded 5. Elder A. B. White was called, March, 1861, and began labor in May, 1861. He was ordained in June following, and while he was with the church, 7 were received by baptism and 4 by letter; 9 dismissed and 7 excluded.\n\nIn April, 1864, Elder G. W. Taylor was called, and continued with the church about one year, during which, 1 was received by baptism, 4 by letter; 2 dismissed by letter, 7 excluded. Elder F. C. Fear was called Sept., 1865, and continued until Nov. 1867. While he was pastor the church received 2 by baptism, 4 by letter; 10 dismissed and 1 excluded. Elder Wm. Haw was called Jan., 1868, and continued as pastor until Dec., 1872. During his pastorate the church received by baptism, 13; by letter, 8; dismissed 10, excluded 4. No pastor from Dec., 1872 to Oct., 1873, but had occasional preaching by Elder D. Trichler.\n\nElder G. W. Thompson was called Oct., 1873, but resigned March, 1874. Charles A. McManis was licensed to preach Nov., 1873, and was ordained in March, 1874, the church having called for his ordination in February previous.\n\nElder Joseph Smith was called to the care of the church April, 1874, and closed his pastorate April, 1879. During the time he served the church, 5 were received by baptism, 3 by letter, 2 restored; and 8 dismissed by letter, 1 excluded.\n\nFrom April, 1879, to Nov., 1879, the church had no pastor, but occasional preaching by Elders Joseph Smith and S. G. Lindsey. During this interval the church received 1 by baptism and 1 by experience.\n\nIn Oct., 1879, the church called Elder L. H. Denman to the pastorate, who is now acting pastor. He entered upon his pastoral duties Nov., 1879, and from that time to the present (July, 1880) the church has received by baptism, 6; by letter, 8; dismissed by letter, 3.\n\nThe total membership at present is 71. The church has had in all 11 Deacons, 9 Clerks, 9 Trustees, and 6 Treasurers, during her existence of over 66 years. And in that length of time, 15 different ministers have been in the pastorate, an average of a little over 4⅓ years to each pastorate.\n\nMay thorough consecration and an unwavering faith mark her future course and progress, and success crown her every effort for God's glory!\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES\n\nJOHN N.

In 1855, he bought the farm on which he now resides, and has improved, adorned and beautified it, until to-day there is no more comfortable or prettier residence in Adams county. In 1860, he married Sarah J. Moreland, daughter of Thomas Moreland, who was a native of Ireland. Mr. Moreland came to this country at an early day, and in 1826 married in Green county, Ohio, Miss Anna Reed, who was a native of Penn. David M. and Sarah J. Kane are the parents of four children; Rosa M., Dora A., Willie M., and Jennie Maud. The Kane family are cultured and refined, and we record with pleasure that Mr. Kane takes an interest in education, which is rapidly placing his family in the front ranks of education lovers in the country. Rosa M., is already in the teachers profession, and the other children are given the benefit of the best educational advantages in the country.\n\nA. C. LEWIS, M. D.\n\nThe subject of this sketch was born in Herkimer, N. J., June 17, 1709 - came to Gallipolis, Ohio, in 1828 - studied medicine with Dr. S. S.

He reared a family of three children, Alice, Emma, and Annie. His wife died Feb. 7, 1857. He married for a second wife Francis A. Hopkins, of Greene county, Ohio. There is but one person now living in Winchester that was here when Mr. Lewis came to the place in 1835. At that time there was but one church in the village, the Baptist Church, which is used by W. T. Hughes as a wagon shop. A small log school house stood on the public square. It had a few small windows in it, and slab seats. There were then but two regular physicians in the county; there are now thirty. Mr. Lewis is the oldest resident physician in Adams county.\n\nT. M.

In 1873 he bought the flouring mill of James Rees, in Winchester, which he has continued to run to the present date. This is one of the boat mills in the county, and under the management of Mr. Young is doing a large business. It was built by Mr. Rees about 1868.\n\nW. R. DUFFEY\n\nThe ancestors of W. R. Duffey wore natives of Ireland. His grandparents, both paternal and maternal, lived near Londonderre. His paternal grandfather, Michael Duffey, was horn in 1753, and died in June 1838, and his maternal grandfather, Thomas Ramsey, was born in 1749, and died in Sept. 1833.

His grandfather Duffey married Nancy Cross. They raised four children, James, William, Francis and Elizabeth. Mr. Duffey and all his family emigrated to Ohio in the spring of 1807. They came down the river on a flatboat - there were no steamboats then - and landed at Manchester. From there they went to Brown county, Ohio, and settled about three miles northwest of Winchester, where his wife died, he married for a second wife Mrs. Nancy Boatman. By this marriage he had a son named Michael, who is now living in Hendricks county, Indiana. Of the four children by Mr. Duffeys first marriage we know but little. James died, leaving a widow who still survives. She is now in the 89th year of her age and in reasonable good health. William served in the war of 1812, and he died in Brown county, Ohio, aged about 70 years. Elizabeth died in Scott township, Oct. 5, 1877, in her 92d year. Francis was born in Pennsylvania in 1784.

John C., married Martha A. Patton, Aug. 27, 1851. His wife died Sept. 9, 1857, leaving three children. He was again married in Aug. 1860 to Satyra Waite. By this marriage were born unto him three children. His second wife died in July 1870, and in Sept. 1872, he married for a third wife Mrs. Druzilla J. Wallace. In 1875 Mr. Duffey died, and his last wife still survives, living at the pleasant home with her parents near Winchester. Tabitha R., married John M. Humes, Dec. 16, 1852. They were the parents of five children. Mr. Humes died a soldier in the Union army in May 1862. Elizabeth J., married John B. Breckinridge, May 30, 1857. She died leaving one child, May 20, 1858. Martha A., married James Bierley in March 1865. They live in Manchester, Ohio, and have had two children, one survivor. Thomas Ramsey, the maternal grandfather of W. R. Duffey, married a Miss Elizabeth Cross. They were the parents of eleven children, William, Samuel C., Rebecca C., Charles, Thomas, Isabel, Joseph. Robert W., Elizabeth, James C., and one that died an infant. Of these children we can gather but little. Thomas and Charles died in the army in the war of 1812, and Elizabeth married Francis Duffey, who were the parents of W. R. Duffey. Thomas Ramseys first wife died, and he afterwards married for a second wife Mrs. Elizabeth Mears, who survived him several years. Mr. Ramsey and both his wives died in Penn., on the farm where he first settled. In 1825 Francis Duffey bought of James Wells, of Wellsville, Ohio, a farm in Wayne township, now Winchester, two and a half miles southeast of the village of Winchester and settled on it, and there lived until his decease, Mar. 1, 1846. His widow continued to occupy the old home until her death, July 5, 1856. This old farm was originally settled by Nathaniel Patton in 1801. Mr. Patton cleared up a considerable portion of the land and planted an orchard on it over seventy-five years ago, some of the trees of which are still living. The first school house in the neighborhood was built on this farm. The large elm tree seen in the engraving in front of the house, was but a small shrub when the settlement was first made. In the eighty years that have since passed by, it has grown to be a tree of three feet in diameter. In April 1872. this tree was struck by lightning and considerably shattered, but it is now regaining its former vigor, and promises to be good for another century of healthy growth. Mr. Patton, who bought this land of Beasley and Ellison, found his title defective and lost most of his labor. He left it and moved to Indiana in the full of 1824, where he\n\nPage 57 -\n\nagain settled in the wilderness. W. H. Duffey who is the principal subject of this sketch, and eighth in the family of Francis and Elizabeth Duffey, was born in Brown county, Ohio, in 1820. married Catherine Moore as before staled. He now owns and occupies this old farm - the homestead of his father. He is a gentleman of good taste, an original thinker, and farms intelligently. For the last twenty years he has been more or less extensively engaged in sheep-raising, keeping from 100 to 400 heads and with satisfactory results, he thinks sheep and cattle are the most profitable stock for a farmer to raise to improve the soil of the land; more grass and less grain is his motto, he is from experience a strong advocate for the use of fertilizers to improve the productive properties of the land, though it pays a good percent, to set the hind in grass alone. Mr. Duffey has a taste for keeping a pair of good horses in saleable condition with fine harness, and saddles for them. He says a team will eat loss grain in good flesh than when in poor condition, and will always be readier sale and command better prices than in poor condition. In politics he is a straight Republican from conscientious convictions of duty and right. His sentiments were anti-slavery from his early years, and he advocated and voted that ticket, apparently unsuccessfully until 1860, when Abraham Lincoln was elected to the Presidency. He has voted with that party since, and thinks that under Republican management every branch of the Government has been admirably successful, and that financially it stands the second nation on the globe, that the financiers of the world concede this, and that they are not likely to he mistaken. Mr. Duffey and his wife are kind, good people, always ready to aid the poor and relieve the needy; none are ever turned from their door hungry or in want. After Mr. Humes lost his life in his countrys service, the widowed mother and her orphan children were kindly provided with a comfortable home on Mr. Duffeys farm, and have since shared his hospitalities. Of Mrs. Humes five children two are dead, the other three, John M., Martha E., and Mary B. Humes are all married. John M., married C. A. Freeland, Dec. 21, 1876. He lives on Mr. Duffeys farm, is a Republican, and prospering financially; has one child named Thomas Clyde. Martha E. married R. S. Black, Sept. 11, 1878, and resides at Unity, Adams County, Ohio. Mary B., married N. M. Brown, Oct. 1, 1879. They reside at Unity, and have one child. Although never blessed with children of their own, Mr. and Mrs. Duffey have generally had children about them. Martha C., the youngest daughter of John C. Duffey is now living with them and is quite a pleasant girl.\n\nISAAC ROBERTS\n\nStephen Roberts, the grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was born in Bucks county, Pa., Apr. 29, 1702. He came with his father to what was then Fairfax county, now Louden county, Va. He married Deborah Williams, whose ancestors came from England, and were members of the society of friends, some of her relatives being opposed to war remained loyal to the British Crown during the Revolution, and with others got the appellation of Tory, which perhaps was no undeserving. Miss Williams relatives settled at the same place and about the same time that Mr. Roberts did. The fruits of their marriage was eight children, six sons and two daughters all of whom married, raised families and have since died except John Roberts, who was the third oldest, being born on the 22d of August, 1792, and who is the father of the subject of this sketch. War having been declared by the United States against Great Britain in June, 1812, he, on the 13th of April of the following year volunteered for six months in Capt. Landen Osburns Com___Fifth Regiment, Va., Militia, and served out his time of e___ment in the vicinity of Norfolk, and was honorably discharged. Again in the following year, 1814, came a general call for all able take up arms, as the British were threatening the Capitol, and to this call he responded, and was on his way to gain his company which, by some means had got in the advance of him, but before our troops had reached the Capitol it had been fired, and the light of the burning buildings could be distinctly seen, he also served one month in the vicinity of Baltimore, which city the American troops were shielding from. Gen. Ross, who after burning the Capitol determined on its destruction, but in the skirmish which ensued Gen. Ross was killed, and before day the campfires of the British were extinguished by throwing hides of cattle over them which they had slaughtered, and in the darkness moved off and took shipping near North Point, and the d___ of Baltimore was at an end. This ended Mr. Roberts military ___. In the fall of 1835 he came to Adams county, of which he has been a citizen since. An anniversary scene occured in the haying season of this year - 1880. If the passer-by had chanced to look into the meadow he could have seen this man who has seen the sun of eighty summers out with his old-time ___, while his son Isaac and grandson Samuel were each laying the grass behind them with the improved mower; and what was more interesting was the ages of the parties at work. Samuel, 29: Isaac, 62, and John Roberts, 88. Isaac Roberts the subject of this sketch, was born Aug. 36, 1818, in Loudon county, Va., and as his parents possessed little of this worlds goods Isaac was early learned to labor, and after becoming quite a large boy has worked for 12½ cents per day. In the summer __ 1835?, while working on a farm for the enormous sum of $5.50 per month, he formed the acquaintance of a millwright by the name of Joshua Harlen, who lived in Washington county, Maryland, and contracted with him to learn the trade. He was to serve as an apprentice for three years for the sum of $50 per year and to clothe himself, which, by close economy he did, and never received all of his money at that. Having finished his apprenticeship he worked as a journeyman two or three years then went into business for himself and met with good success. On the 18th of Oct. 1846, he married Lucinda E. Wince, of Loudon county, Va. She was the daughter of Phillip and Catherine Wince, whose maiden name was Shaffer, and who was from the above county. Phillip Wince was born in Pa., on the Delaware river near Phila. These parents are buried in Loudon county, Va. Mr. Roberts remained in Va., and followed his trade until two children were born to them. He being away from his children much of the time he decided to change his occupation. Having friends in Ohio, he in the fall of 1850 brought his little family and located in Adams County. There has been eleven children in all born to them, six sons and three daughters, but in the month of Jan. 1865, three children were taken from them two sons and one daughter; their ages being four, five and eleven years. The remaining children are all at home except the oldest who is married and lives in the neighborhood. The home of this family is a pleasant one, adorned by flowers and surrounded by ornamental trees and foliage as can be seen in the engraving."
