        "text": "Passionate. Energetic. Dedicated. These are a few words that describe me. Hello, I am Courtney Worley, your candidate for Brown County Municipal Court Judge - a judge for the people.\n\nI want to help make Brown County a better place to live, work, and raise a family. Why? Because we deserve that. I am a lifelong resident who sees first-hand the benefits, challenges, and amazing potential of our rural county that is full of caring, hard-working individuals.\n\nGrowing up on the family farm, my parents and grandparents instilled values, morals, and the importance of hard work to accomplish any goal – big or small – in me and my siblings. That determination and drive led me to graduate from Fayetteville High School where I played varsity sports and earned my American FFA degree, to college and eventually law school, and to my current position as Brown County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney.\n\nAfter law school, I decided to remain in Brown County because I believe in the communities and people here. My husband Michael, a local business owner, and I made our home in Georgetown with our fur baby, Winston. We love traveling, hiking, and spending time outdoors. Yardwork, mowing to be specific, is something I really enjoy thanks to my farmgirl roots. Michael and I were married in the beautiful St. Monica-St. George Parish in Clifton where we attended mass while Michael was a student at University of Cincinnati. Today, we attend services at several area Brown County Catholic churches because we enjoy worshipping with friends and family throughout the area. Please say hello if you see us on Sunday.\n\nFamily is important and every decision I make for the betterment of my community and county is a reflection of my parents, Kathy (Huber) Adams and Gail Adams, as well as my in-laws, the Honorable Joe and Debbie Worley. Love, support, appreciation of public service, respect for self and others, and faith run deep in our lives. I count myself blessed and fortunate to be surrounded by such wonderful people.\n\nI am ready to further serve my fellow Brown Countians as your Municipal Judge. I promise to lead with passion, zest, and commitment no matter what challenges lie ahead. I personally thank you for visiting my Facebook page where I will continue to share more about me, my judgeship goals and specific plans for Brown County. Additionally, I invite you to share your ideas, join me at community events, and collaborate on issues important to you. Together, we will make a positive impact on Brown County now and in the future years to come."
