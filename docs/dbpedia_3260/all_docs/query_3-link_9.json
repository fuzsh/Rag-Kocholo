        "text": "Buying his freedom in 1845, John Parker was a successful entrepreneur, inventor, and Underground Railroad conductor. Helping hundreds of fugitive slaves cross the Ohio River into safety, he became a wealthy industrialist after the war and owned one of the largest ironworks in region. Nestled with many other historic sites in Ripley, his home is open to the public today as a museum.\n\nBuilt for a family friend of the Grant's in 1832, the Bailey House has served as Georgetown's premier accommodation for over 20 years. One of the oldest homes in the area, it's located just a block away from the Grant homestead and the historic town square. Information and reservations can be made here.\n\nLocated just outside of town, the Ohio Department of Veterans Services operates a hospital and nursing home for local veterans. The grounds feature a brass statue of US Grant, which combined with the Native Son statue in the square, makes Georgetown one of only two places in the world to have more than one statue of Grant, the other being Washington DC. Directions and more information can be found on the Veterans Services website.\n\nGist Settlement\n\nFormed in the early 1800's, the settlement of Gist was comprised of 1,100 acres divided between 150 freed slaves from Virginia. Descendants still live there today, and members of the 5th United States Colored Troops are buried in the Carthagenia cemetery. There is one Historic Marker, which can be located from Remarkable Ohio.\n\nThe Squirrel Hunters\n\nLocated in front the Ripley Library at 27 Main Street, this Historic Marker commemorates the impromptu defense of Cincinnati in September of 1862. The text of both sides can be read on Remarkable Ohio, and the official USGHA write-up.\n\nRipley Civil War Sites\n\nSeveral civil war sites can be seen in Ripley, including a cannon that defended the town from Morgan's Raid, a Soldier & Sailor monument where Reverend John Rankin and many Civil War veterans are buried, and a freedom monument on the banks of the Ohio River.\n\nBethel Historical Society\n\nHoused in the Grant Memorial building on the corner of Main and Plane street, the museum is open the first and third Saturday of the month, and Society meetings are every third Wednesday of each month. For more information, including special exhibits and membership, visit their website.\n\nShuster's Mill\n\nBuilt in 1843 by Edward Thompson as the second of three mills in the area, it ran faithfully for over 40 years as the 'Tunnel Mill'. A mile South of Georgetown, it has been the subject of an intensive renovation project. Purchased in 2012 by Ken and Judy Klosterman, the outside of the structure has been restored to its original appearance, and the inside is nearing completion. While on private property, the mill can be viewed from the road. Directions and a brief history can be found here.\n\nRosemary Clooney House\n\nLocated in Augusta Kentucky, this historic building is a brief drive along the Ohio River from Georgetown. Open to the public since 2005, this museum acts to preserve the home and memorabilia of local actress and vocalist from the golden age of Hollywood. To schedule a tour, please visit their website.\n\nDecatur Park and 70th OVI Monument\n\nDedicated in 1906 to the men and officers of the 70th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, the statue stands proudly over the public park and commons. One of the oldest villages in Brown County, it's town square serves as a memorial for the 265 casualties taken during the regiment's service. Open to the public from dawn-to-dusk, the park marks the ending point for a parade every Memorial Day, and a spot for concerts in the spring and fall. Additionally, the grounds host a Historical Marker.\n\nRipley Tobacco Museum\n\nBuilt in the 1850's as a Federal and Georgian style home, the museum was opened to the public in 1988. The only one of its kind in the state, it documents the history and contributions of Brown county to tobacco development and production.\n\nTours are available to the public by donation, visit their website for more information.\n\nQuilt Barn Trail\n\nBrown County is home to at least 19 quilt barns, all of which can be seen from public roads. Many of the patterns belong to family quilts, which have been passed down over generations of use. Brown County is a member of the Ohio Clothesline of Quilts and has an official listing and map. Further reading can be found at Ohio Magazine.\n\nTri-State Warbirds\n\nA few miles west on OH-32, the Tri-State Warbird museum quietly works to preserve and restore more than a dozen aircraft and vehicles from WWII. Open Saturdays and Wednesdays, it is one of the few facilities of its kind in the country. For information on tours and private parties, visit their website."
