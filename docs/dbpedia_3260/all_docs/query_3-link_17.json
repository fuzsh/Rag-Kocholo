Luckily for the local residents, the soldiers only stole a few horses and didn’t do any other damage. The railroad is currently owned by Norfolk Southern.\n\nBloom Rose (Bloomrose) (Prall) – Sterling Township\n\nPost Office: 1854 – 1869\n\nLocation: 39.103999, -83.998125\n\non Bloomrose Rd at the intersection of Blue Sky Park Rd along Fivemile Creek\n\nRemnants: Bloomrose Church and Cemetery on the east side Bloomrose Rd south of the GPS coordinates\n\nDescription: The town had a school (Sterling Township No. 3) on the south side of Blue Sky Park Rd and a shoe shop on the west side of Bloomrose Rd south of the GPS coordinates.

Their son Joseph Bennett Brown was the first interment. Joseph was also the town’s postmaster and married Ruth Brown (1821 – 1886) after Zelinda passed away. The current brick church structure was built in 1883. In the late 1800s to early 1900s the town was called Prall and was named after the most prominent family in the area at the time. Several of their family members were also buried in the cemetery, dating back to Thomas Prall (1813 – 1874) from New Jersey and Catharine (Lefler) Prall from Ohio (1817 – 1895). The area lacked industry though and couldn’t compete with several other villages in the township which were more prosperous. Bloomrose Church is still in operation.\n\nClover Valley – Pike Township\n\nPost Office: 1858 – 1861\n\nLocation: 38.989562 -83.979175\n\non Oakland – Locust Ridge Rd (Co Hwy 20B) at the intersection of Gargonia Rd (Township Hwy 145) along Polecat Run\n\nRemnants: none known\n\nDescription: It had a steam-powered saw mill in the northwest corner of the intersection and a school (Pike Township No. 2) a mile east of the GPS coordinates in the northwest corner of the intersection of Oakland – Locust Ridge Rd & New Harmony Shiloh Rd.

There are a few variations to the family surname, including Gilet, Gillet, and Gillett. John and Tirzah were buried with relatives in Confidence (Georgetown) Cemetery on Mt Orab Pike on the north side of Georgetown. The railroad ran from 1877 – 1936. Its tracks started in Columbia – Tusculum in Hamilton County but only made it as far as Russellville in Brown County due to funding problems.

Hillman had a school (Pleasant Township No. 6) across the road from the cemetery and a Christian church called Olive Chapel on Old State Rte 68. Evans Run Rd went from Old State Rte 68 across the creek and headed west over to Hillman Ridge Rd south of the GPS coordinates in the mid to late 1800s.\n\nLewis – Lewis Township\n\nPost Office: 1819 – 1862\n\nLocation: unknown\n\nDescription: The town was listed in the 1843 A Table Of Post-Offices In Ohio, Arranged By Counties, Townships, And Towns as 8 miles away from Georgetown with no village.\n\nLiberty – Byrd Township\n\nLocation: 38.817028, -83.735336\n\non SR 353 along Eagle Creek between SR 125 and W Fork Rd\n\nRemnants: Liberty Chapel and Cemetery at the GPS coordinates\n\nDescription: This small farming town’s existence was solely due to its church congregation which formed in 1810. A creek stone chapel was constructed in 1817 and was replaced with the current wood frame structure in 1874 at a cost of $1200. Although the church and cemetery are still in use, the town never grew much and didn’t have any other industries besides farming. It fell off of the maps before the late 1800s.\n\nMonroe – Pleasant Township\n\nLocation: 38.810526, -83.890714\n\non Old State Rte 68 along Sheep Run\n\nRemnants: none known\n\nDescription: Amos Mitchell platted the town with 46 lots in the late 1810s before Georgetown was laid out, naming it after the 5th U.S. President James Monroe.

The dam was destroyed almost every time the creek flooded and they simply grew tired of rebuilding it. Todds Run also had a blacksmith shop and a Baptist church that was built in 1882. Archibald was buried with relatives in Williamsburg Cemetery on Gay St in Williamsburg, Clermont County. Curtis Wilson’s grave hasn’t been located yet.\n\nTracys (Traceys) – Pleasant and Lewis Township\n\nLocation: 38.873170, -83.921468\n\non SR 125 along White Oak Creek\n\nRemnants: old farm and mill buildings in the area\n\nDescription: Tracys was another stopping point on the Cincinnati, Georgetown, & Portsmouth Railroad between Sunshine Station and Georgetown.

There were a few mills next to the creek along what was called the Cascade Falls running through the border of Pleasant and Lewis Township near SR 125. Some of the mill buildings on private property appear to still be intact on satellite maps, although in poor shape due to time and Ohio’s seasonal weather changes. Francis and Julia were buried with relatives in Confidence (Georgetown Cemetery) on Mt Orab Pike on the north side of Georgetown.\n\nWhiteoak Springs – Scott Township\n\nLocation: 38.945852, -83.923667\n\non Smoky Row Rd at the intersection of Vinegar Hill Rd\n\nRemnants: none known\n\nDescription: It was named after the natural springs in the area fed by White Oak Creek.\n\nDe La Palma, OH (early 1800s – early 1900s post office and farming town)\n\nClassification: ghost town\n\nLocation: Sterling Township, Brown County – On Dela Palma Rd near the intersection of Bardwell West Rd\n\nDe La Palma was founded by Absalom Day (1773 – 1839) Elizabeth (Earhart) Day (1776 – 1843). They were one of the original 10 families in Williamsburg, Clermont County and received a land plat for settling there when it was a newly formed town. Their daughter Mary, born June 28, 1797, was the first child born in Williamsburg. A few years later, sometime around 1800, the Day family moved to a farm next to Dela Palma Rd. Absalom and Elizabeth had 12 children. Most of them married into families from nearby towns and moved away.\n\nThe road into what would become the tiny town of De La Palma provided a good traveling route between Clermont County and that section of rural Brown County. In the mid-1800s, William Weeks (1810 – 1875) and Sophia Weeks (1814 – 1885) bought the Day farm and opened up a post office and general store. It ran from 1850 – 1882 and helped get De La Palma mentioned in the 1883 History of Brown County, Ohio as a postal town. The name later went by Delapalma with a post office of the same spelling from 1898 – 1903. There was also a cooper shop near the post office and a one-room schoolhouse (Sterling Township No. 2) which operated for a few decades and still stands at the corner of Dela Palma Rd and Bardwell West Rd.\n\nAbsalom and Elizabeth were buried with some of their family members and other early families from the area in Price Cemetery near the bank of Four Mile Creek in Clermont County. It’s on private property between Zimmer Rd and Ireton Rd. Abasolom’s father, Revolutionary War veteran Jeremiah Day (1752 – 1820), was also buried there. His mother’s grave, Sarah (Dod) Day’s, hasn’t been located yet.\n\nGeorgetown, OH (1819 – present farming, mill, and merchant town)\n\nClassification: historic town\n\nLocation: Pleasant Township, Brown County – on SR 125\n\nAllen Woods (1767 – 1862) immigrated to the United States from Ireland and married Hannah (Galbreath) Woods (1767 – 1852) in Pennsylvania. They moved to Ohio in 1803-1804. Allen platted Georgetown along what is now State Route 125 with 22 lots and 2 outlots in 1819. It quickly acquired more plat additions from local landowners and became the county seat in 1821. The town was attracting everything it needed, including mills on White Oak Creek, grocery stores, hardware stores, blackmiths, and doctors. Public buildings such as new schools and churches were constructed whenever necessary. The population was at 618 in the 1850 census.\n\nIt was stated in the 1883 History Of Brown County, Ohio that Georgetown’s growth was slow but steady. The town had a train station on the Cincinnati, Georgetown, & Portsmouth Railroad from 1886 – 1936 but its arrival and existence didn’t create a major population boom for the town. Businesses usually did well in the town square and were rarely unoccupied. The Georgetown Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It consists of 17 acres with 42 buildings and offers an alternative to the normal shopping experiences of the era. Parking is free in the town square and many historic structures are within walking distance.\n\nIn accordance with agreeing to be the county seat, Georgetown’s first courthouse was built in 1823 and eventually needed replaced. A much larger courthouse was completed in the town square in 1852. During the Civil War, and on the same day they reached the Wickerham Inn, a Confederate detachment of 200 – 300 of Morgan’s Raiders cavalry unit took control of the town square while stealing horses and goods from stores and residents. Long After surviving that day, a section of the courthouse was destroyed in an arson fire in 1977. Local citizens formed the Brown County Courthouse Reconstruction Association and raised funds for its restoration. The courthouse was rededicated in 1982.\n\nGeneral of the Union Army in the Civil War and 18th President Of The United States, Ulysses S. Grant, spent his childhood in Georgetown before leaving for the West Point Military Academy in 1839. His father Jesse Grant (1794 – 1873) and mother Hannah (Simpson) Grant (1798 – 1883) saved up $1100 in Point Pleasant, Clermont County. They moved to Georgetown and built their family home on Grant Avenue in 1823 when Ulysses was just a year old. Jesse owned a tannery across from the house and ran a construction business. He was the mayor of Georgetown from 1837 – 1839.\n\nThe Grant’s home was purchased by Judge George Campbell and Teresa Campbell, who started its restoration. It was sold to John and Judy Ruthven in 1977 and they donated it to the state in 2002. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark by the federal government and a total restoration was finished in 2013. The school Ulysses attended is restored on S Water Street. Both are museums run by the Ulysses S. Grant Homestead Association. Georgetown is also home to the annual Brown County Fair. The population in 2010 was 4,331. It’s one of few old towns in Ohio that can boast of never having a lower 10 year census count than the prior one.\n\nHigginsport, OH (White Haven) – (1816 – present farming, mill, and river town with less residents than in the past)\n\nClassification: small town\n\nLocation: Lewis Township, Brown County – On US 52 at the intersection of SR 221\n\nHigginsport was basically platted on top of what was already a ghost town. In 1804 Revolutionary War veteran Colonel Robert Higgins (1746 – 1825) from Pennsylvania settled next to the Ohio River near mouth of Red Oak Creek with his wife Mary (Jolliffe) Higgins (1763 – 1806). Robert platted a village called White Haven and offered incentives to new settlers. Only a few families took him up on the offer though. The would be town was scratched and Robert tried again, platting Higginsport in 1816 with 114 lots, a public square, and the town named after his family.\n\nThere were about a half dozen log cabins in 1828. Higginsport got its first store that same year, followed by several more stores and a post office in 1829. The first brick house in town was built in 1835 at the corner of Water St and Brown St. A brick church constructed in 1842 replaced the earlier stone and log cabin chapels. One of the main sources of income for local residents was farming corn and tobacco. White Burley tobacco was named after the color of the plants and is know to have been grown in the area before 1850. A steam-powered grist mill was built in 1855 by Henry Davidson and William Dugan. They added a whiskey distillery in 1861 and a warehouse in 1863.\n\nThe 1880s was probably Higginsport’s heyday with a population of around 850. The town had a couple dozen small businesses including general, dry goods, clothing, and grocery stores, 2 tin shops, 2 drug stores, a hardware store, and tobacco store. There was also a blacksmith, doctor, 17 tobacco warehouses at the peak of production, and several churches over the decades. A large school was constructed on Gaines St in 1880. One of the last major businesses in Higginsport was a steam-powered saw mill built by Boyd & Co. of Levanna in 1887. The town never had a railroad and didn’t get any big businesses in the 1900s to create another population boom.\n\nThese days, Higginsport has around 250 residents and the number is likely to decline in the future. Most of the original streets remain intact with older buildings scattered around. An abandoned bridge crosses Red Oak Creek between SR 221 and Old A and P Rd. It was built with steel made by the Carnegie Steel Co. whose owner Andrew Carnegie (1835 – 1919) was once one of the richest people in the world. A stone building on the south side of US 52 just east of town next to the Ohio River was confirmed by a local resident to be the former jail. Robert and Mary Higgins are buried with some of their family members and other early settlers in Higginsport Cemetery north of town on SR 221. The school closed in 1987. It’s one of the most photographed and popular abandoned schools in the state.\n\nLevanna, OH – (1799 – present river town with less residents than in the past)\n\nClassification: semi-ghost town\n\nLocation: Union Township, Brown County – On US 52 at the intersection of Pisgah Hill Rd\n\nIt was settled in 1799 by John Liggett, followed by a few other families and businessmen. Levanna had a log cabin school in 1800, the first ferry boat in Brown County around 1810, and was also where the first newspaper in the county was printed. The town didn’t grow fast, but kept growing and had its heyday in the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThere was a saw mill, lumber yard, and a small manufacturing factory operated by Boyd & Co., which also did business in nearby Higginsport and Ripley. Levanna had a one-room schoolhouse (Union Township No. 10), a blacksmith shop, church, planing mill, and a cooperage that made wine and whiskey casks. The abandoned house attached to this listing was the hotel. Vineyards were another source of income as grapes grew well on the ridges above the Ohio River and made good wine. In the early 1900s, the town had a train station on the Ohio Valley & Columbus Railroad but it went out of business before the 1920s.\n\nLevanna doesn’t have any stores or businesses today, but there are a few old abandoned houses around town and its a nice drive along US 52 (Ohio River Scenic Byway). Some of the early settlers of Levanna were buried in Pisgah Ridge Cemetery north of town on Pisgah Hill Rd.\n\nMurrays Corners, OH (1810s – early 1900s farming and stagecoach stop town)\n\nClassification: ghost town\n\nLocation: On US 50 at the 4-way intersection of SR 251 and Murray Corner Rd\n\nThe Thumann Log House was originally a log cabin structure built as a tavern in 1811. It was remodeled with wood frame in the 1840s and turned into an important stagecoach stop between Chillicothe and Cincinnati. The Murray family purchased the property in 1851 and operated the tavern and hotel into the 1900s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.\n\nNew Hope, OH (1810s – present farming town with less residents than in the past)\n\nClassification: small town\n\nLocation: Scott Township, Brown County – On New Hope – White Oak Station Rd at the intersection of Main St off of US 68\n\nNew Hope was settled by Daniel Holloway (1795 – 1842) and Dillany (Reynolds) Holloway (1795 – 1881). They were already married when they arrived in the area sometime around 1818 and built their cabin on the plateau where New Hope currently sits. The town formed as more families moved there over the next few decades. In 1849 a cholera epidemic swept through New Hope, as it did in many other places in Ohio and around the country. It could have been much worse for New Hope, but just 22 of the approximately 100 residents perished from the disease. Populations in some other towns were completely exterminated.\n\nNew Hope started growing again after that and in 1876 the town had a wool mill, saloon, 3 stores, a school, church, blacksmith, doctor, and a wood frame bridge that crossed White Oak Creek. The population in 1880 was 138 and never boomed due to the lack of a canal or railroad. New Hope’s post office ran from 1828 – 1906. Today the town probably has less than 100 residents who we’d like to thank for keeping it clean and preserving their history. We didn’t see any abandoned houses, and there are many old buildings and structures that are well worth stopping by to take photos of.\n\nThe old hotel and stagecoach stop built in 1846 is on the left side of Man St and a former grocery store and Odd Fellows meeting hall is across from it. A small building marked Scott Township Hall is in the lot behind the town marker on Main St. Over on New Hope – McKinley Rd, the Methodist church built in 1851 is still open. A little on down the road is the abandoned Scott Township School that was built in 1935 and closed in 1971. There are also a few old cemeteries on the outskirts of town.\n\nRipley, OH (Staunton) – (1812 – present farming, abolitionist, and river town)\n\nClassification: historic town\n\nLocation: Union Township, Brown County – On US 52 at the intersection of US 62 and US 68\n\nRipley was settled by Revolutionary War veteran Colonel James Poage (1760 – 1820) and Mary (Woods) Poage (1766 – 1830). James received 1,000 acres in Ohio from the state of Virginia for his service and moved his family there in 1804. They built a cabin on their land next to the Ohio River near the bank of Red Oak Creek. James was an abolitionist but couldn’t free his slaves in Virginia, for obvious reasons at the time, so he let them go upon arrival in the safety of Ohio. A few years later, James platted the town of Staunton, named after Staunton, Virginia. It only attracted a few families though, and the town was renamed Ripley after General Eleazer Wheelock Ripley (1782 – 1839), a hero of the War of 1812.\n\nMore families moved to the area and Ripley’s growth began. It got a very early post office in 1816 and was involved in a bitter dispute for the Brown County seat of justice. The county courts were temporarily held in Ripley for a few years until moving to Georgetown. During the 1820s – 1860s, Ripley became an important shipping point on the Ohio River for crops from the county to be transported to towns along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Corn and tobacco farming were the 2 main sources of income for local residents. The town was second place in Ohio, just behind Cincinnati in 1846, for pork packing.\n\nIn 1860 the Ripley Gas-Light and Coke Company installed gas powered lights in 75 homes and 16 streetlamps, making Ripley one of the first night time illuminated towns in Ohio. Ripley also had a strong abolitionist movement led by Rev. John Rankin (1793 – 1886), a Presbyterian minister from Tennessee, and his wife Jean (Lowrey) Rankin (1795 – 1878). They hid runaway slaves in their home at night and helped them escape to freedom on the underground railroad during the day time. When the Civil War began in 1862, Ripley’s old fairgrounds were used as a mustering and training point for Union Soldiers. The end of the war created an industrial and population boom for the town.\n\nThe 1870s were probably the peak of Ripley’s heyday. It had multiple mills, a lumber yard, 2 boatyards, a school, hotel, town hall, pork packing and slaughterhouses, a couple of cooper shops, several churches, and a large tobacco warehouse. There was also a train station on the Ohio River & Columbus Railroad in the first couple decades of the 1900s. Much like its nearby neighbors of Levanna and Higginsport, Ripley didn’t get big businesses in the 1900s to create another population boom in that century. However, it did maintain much of its population since then, which is around 1750 today.\n\nThere are several historical markers and old buildings around town. Ohio Historical Marker # 8 – 8 on N Front St has info about river town life in the 1800s. At the Union Township Library on the corner of Main St and Market St, Ohio Historical Marker #9 – 8 has a story about the Civil War and a restored cannon in the yard. Ohio Historical marker #7 – 8 at 502 S Second St tells the tale of Camp Ripley during the Civil War. Another Ohio Historical Marker, #4 – 8 at 300 N Front St is for the John P. Parker House. John Parker (1827 – 1900) was a freed slave, inventor, and businessman who helped slaves on the underground railroad. Both the Parker House and The Rankin House on Rankin Hill Rd are on the National Register of Historic Places. The Rankin’s were buried in Maplewood Cemetery next to US 52 in the middle of town. James and Mary Poage were buried in Old Ripley Cemetery next to the bank of Red Oak Creek in the woods at 4th and Cherry St where the end of 5th St once was.\n\nRussellville, OH – (1817 – present farming and merchant town)\n\nLocation: Jefferson Township, Brown County – On SR 125 at the intersection of US 52\n\nClassification: small town\n\nAn extremely uncommon sight in Ohio is the restored W.L. Johnson Carriage Factory built in 1850 on SR 125 in Russellville. Although carriage factories were abundant in the horse and buggy days, just a few of the original ones survived into the new millennium. Civil War veteran William Johnson (1838 – 1921) and Cindora (Shaw) Johnson (1845 – 1917) owned the factory and had 5 children. Cindora was a granddaughter of Russell Shaw (1781 – 1864) and Josanna (Reynolds) Shaw (1779 – 1864) who founded the town in 1817. William and Cindora were buried with relatives in Linwood Cemetery on the east side of town on Russellville – Winchester Rd.\n\nBrown County, Ohio Ghost Towns Research Resources\n\n1876 – Brown County atlas\n\nhttp://www.historicmapworks.com/Atlas/US/7674/Brown+County+1876/\n\n1883 – The History of Brown County, Ohio\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=udUyAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\n1913 – History of Clermont and Brown Counties, Ohio – Vol. 1\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ENYyAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\n1913 – History of Clermont and Brown Counties, Ohio – Vol. 2\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=bdYyAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false"
