Ewing\n\nFor nearly twenty years the interesting subject of this brief review has been a resident of Colorado and has been a potent factor in the progress and development of the portion of the state in which he has resided. He is now one of the prosperous and successful farmers of Mesa county, living on a fine ranch which he has improved and cultivated for a number of years in the vicinity of Plateau City, and is connected in a leading way with the agricultural and commercial interests of the section, and contributes to its public life the force of his energy and the inspiration of a good example of upright and serviceable citizenship. Mr. Ewing is a native of Brown county, Ohio, where he was born in 1837, and is the son of Robert and Elizabeth (Milton) Ewing, now both deceased. His father was born and reared in Ohio, and was a prosperous farmer in that state, remaining there until 1837, when he moved to Illinois and in 1857 to Kansas, where he passed the residue of his life, dying at the age of eighty-four. He served as a member of the convention which framed the constitution of the state. His wife as a native of Virginia, who moved with her parents to Ohio in early life and there grew to womanhood and was married. She died in in 1876. Their offspring numbered eight, of whom S.E. was the fifth born. He was an infant when the family moved to Illinois, and he lived in that state until he became twenty-five years of age, being educated at the public schools in the neighborhood of his home, and assisting in the work on his father's farm until the time mentioned, when he migrated to Kansas and started a farming enterprise of his own which he conducted successfully for a period of twenty-two years. He then came to Colorado and settled in Boulder county. For six years he lived there engaged in the same line of activity, then moved to where he now lives, taking up his present ranch on the Kansas mesa in 1888. Here he has since been operating as a farmer and stock-grower, and has prospered in the business and won a high place in the regard of his fellow citizens in this section. He was first married in 1861 to Miss Sarah A. Goode, a native of Illinois. They became the parents of nine children, eight of whom are living, William E., Frederick G., Oliver, John, Robert, Elizabeth, Hattie, Rose A. and Sylvanus V. The other one, a son named Thomas, died when he was ten years old. The second marriage occurred on May 15, 1902, and was to Miss Lillie Kerr, a native of Arkansas. They have one child, George E. Ewing. Mr. Ewing has ever been zealous and persistent in pushing forward works of public utility for the improvement of his neighborhood. He was active in promoting the construction of the Big creek reservoir for purposes of irrigation, and is now a stockholder in the enterprise, holding sixteen shares. Many other works of importance have had his earnest and serviceable support, and all of commendable value may count upon his countenance and substantial aid, for nothing of worth to the community fails to meet his approval and enlist his interest.

[The History of Holt and Atchison Counties, Missouri;St. Joseph, Mo.: National Historical Company, 1882. Transcribed by K. Mohler]\n\nAmos Shinkle\n\nThe helpless failures cumber the sod, and hope and inspiration are inspired when it is given us to take cognizance of those who have wrought well in the stern battle of life and have made of success not an accident but a logical result. Such a man was the late Amos Shinkle, of Covington, whose patent of sterling character was that designated by his being numbered among the worldâs noble army of productive workers. His energies were not parasitic, but he was conscious of his powers and properly exercised them, in the meanwhile maintaining a high sense of stewardship. There is all of consistency in offering in this publication a brief review of his earnest, worthy and prolific life.\n\nAmos Shinkle was born on a farm on White Oak creek, Brown county, Ohio, on the 11th of August, 1818, and was a son of Peter and Sarah (Day) Shinkle. This father was born at Slab Camp, Bucks county, Pennsylvania, a place whose name was later changed to the more suggestive one of New Hope, which it still bears, and the date of the latterâs nativity was July 26, 1795. In his native state Peter Shinkle was reared to manhood and there he learned the trade of cabinetmaking under the careful and effective system of apprenticeship observed by German forbears. As a young man he removed to Higginsport, Brown county, Ohio, where he eventually engaged in the manufacturing of furniture, which he shipped by flat-boat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans, where he found ready demand for his sturdily constructed products, all of which were made by hand. His domestic and business relations and responsibilities were such as to render it virtually impossible for him to serve as a soldier in the war of 1812, for which conflict he hired a substitute. In 1844 he removed with his family to Kentucky and purchased a farm near Catlettsburg, Boyd county, but in 1847 he established his home in Covington, which was then a mere village. Here he was engaged in the coal business for a number of years, and he became one of the substantial and honored citizens of the community, to whose civic and material progress he contributed his quota. In 1813 was solemnized his marriage to Miss Sarah Day, who was born in October, 1796, and who bore him four sons and four daughters. After the death of his first wife, and when he was eighty-seven years of age, he contracted a second marriage, which caused an estrangement with his eldest son, Amos, with whom he was living at the time, and he thereupon established a separate home for himself and his bride, who survived him by a number of years. He lived to attain to the patriarchal age of ninety-one years and his death occurred in the year 1886.\n\nAmos Shinkle was reared under the conditions and environments of the pioneer epoch, his parents having been children at the time of the removal of the respective families to what was then the Northwest Territory, in 1797, when they left their old home in Pennsylvania. Owing to the exigencies of time and place the early educational advantages of Amos Shinkle were necessarily very meager, but he had an alert and receptive mind and made excellent progress in his studies, which he prosecuted at home as well as in the primitive schools, the result being that he proved himself eligible for pedagogic honors, according to the standard of the locality at that time. He thus had the distinction of becoming the teacher in the same school which he had himself attended as a pupil. With a natural predilection and aptitude for business, he soon found for himself other employment than that of the school-room. At the age of seventeen years he assumed charge of his fatherâs books, but his sturdy independence caused him to differ with his father in regard to his actions and business privileges, and while still a youth he left the paternal home, having at the time capitalistic resources amounting to only seventy-five cents. He secured a position as cook on a flat-boat, and while retaining this position he made a number of trips down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans. He was well endowed with the cardinal virtues of industry, integrity and frugality, and he carefully conserved his earnings, with the result that he finally became the owner of a flat-boat. He went into the woods of eastern Kentucky, where he felled trees, after which he manufactured the timber into furniture, which he transported to New Orleans, where he found a ready market for his goods. After accumulating some money through his operations in this line, he engaged in the grocery business, but this venture proved unsuccessful, owing to the loose credit system then in vogue, the result being that he found himself bankrupt before he had attained to his legal majority. The law would have rendered every action of his creditors of no avail against him, but he took no advantage of these conditions, thus showing his intrinsic honesty of purpose and his determination to do right under all circumstances. In due time, through unremitting effort and much self-denial, he paid every cent of his indebtedness, and he thus gained that invaluable asset, a reputation for integrity, that proved the foundation of his future success and definite prosperity.\n\nIn August, 1846, fortified with a hard-earned capital of fifteen hundred dollars, Mr. Shinkle located in Covington, and, in the face of past experience, he determined to succeed through more careful methods. At this time was given inception to his real business career, which was distinguished throughout by wise forethought and inflexible integrity of purpose, permitting no compromise with expediency. He engaged in the coal trade, in which his principal operations were in supplying fuel to steamboats plying between Cincinnati and New Orleans. He was conservative to a degree, but missed no opportunities, and through his indefatigable energy, fair dealings and progressive methods he built up a large and prosperous business, by medium of which he was a substantial capitalist at the time of his retirement therefrom, in 1864. During his many years of active and noteworthy identification with navigation interests on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers Mr. Shinkle did much to improve facilities in this important field of enterprise, having been the owner of a number of steamboats and having, in fact, put into commission one of the first vessels of this kind on the Ohio river. At the time of the Civil war the United States government purchased two or more of his boats, which were converted into iron-clads and which were utilized in a number of the naval battles on the lower Mississippi. Mr. Shinkle was the owner of two boats that were sunk during the war, at Pittsburg Landing, and though the same were laden with valuable merchandise he made no effort to secure indemnity for his losses.\n\nWhile living at Higginsport, during his early years, Mr. Shinkle took an active interest in military affairs, and he received from Governor Shannon commission as first lieutenant of artillery in the Eighth Division of the Ohio militia. He offered his services and those of his company to the government at the time of the Mexican war, but when he arrived with his command at Cincinnati, for the purpose of being mustered in, he was disappointed in his patriotic designs, by reason of the close of the war. This early training and experience in military affairs served him well in later years, when, as colonel of Kentucky Home Guards, he was in command at Covington during the raid of the Confederate officer, General Kirby Smith. During the Civil war his executive ability and mature judgment proved of great value in maintaining peace and order in his section of the state. Covington was on the border between the north and south as aligned in contest, and a dominant element of the community advocated stateâs rights, with the attending justification of secession, the success of which would have disintegrated the nation. At this time, when Kentucky was trembling in the balance and multitudes were uncertain which cause to espouse, Mr. Shinkle promptly called for volunteers to form a guard for the protection of the city. The result was the organization of the historic âShotgun Company,â which speedily expanded into the Forty-first Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. As has been well said, \"This challenge of wavering minds defined at once the position of the many, and a rallying center was provided for vacillating Union sentiment.\" Mr. Shinkleâs rapid rise as a man of affairs placed him in commanding position among the leading capitalists and business men of this section of the state, and he carried into successful operation extensive and important enterprises. The reorganization of the company to complete the Covington and Cincinnati suspension bridge was consummated by him in 1856, and concerning his efforts in this and other directions the following pertinent statements have been written: âThrough numerous and almost appalling discouragements he never lost faith in the success of this great project until he beheld its grand actuality ten years later, becoming president of the company at the time of its reorganization and giving to its affairs the benefit of his splendid administrative powers and capitalistic support. Likewise he founded and promoted successfully the Covington Gas Company, of which he continued president until his death. He was also the founder and the first president of the First National Bank of Covington, and was director or president of other corporations too numerous to mention. Throughout his long and useful career he had at heart the advancement of every good interest of the community. Many of the financial enterprises that eventually contributed to his own fortune were conceived in a large-minded and generous desire to help the city of his adoption, and upon every hand can be seen substantial proofs of his disinterested sagacious activity in the interest of the social and material progress and prosperity of the people among whom he had cast in his lot. His public-spirited endeavor that Covington should take proud position among sister cities was a strong and constant impulse. His connection with the board of education inaugurated a change in the architectural beauty and utility of the public-school buildings. As a member of the city council he made his influence always felt for good. He was long and prominently identified with the Masonic fraternity and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and in local politics he was an unostentatious but a recognized power.\n\n\"It was division of opinion during the Civil war that made Mr. Shinkle a member of the Methodist Episcopal church, though he had all along been an occasional attendant upon public worship and had for a number of years been a pew holder in several prominent churches. The churches generally showed the prevailing feeling as to the great questions of the day, and he was not satisfied with their attitude. The Methodist Episcopal church on Greenup street, unpretentious in appearance and limited in resources, represented unhesitating loyalty to the nation, and to this church Mr. Shinkle was drawn by patriotic considerations as well as by the attraction of some strong personal friendships among its members. He threw himself unreservedly and with characteristic zeal into the work of building up the organization and its interests. A new and stately edifice replaced the old one. That there might be no question as to the loyalty of those who worshipped therein, its windows and woodwork were painted red, white and blue, and by common consent it was called Union church. From a helpful business connection with this church Mr. Shinkle grew, almost inperceptibly yet rapidly, into a positive spiritual relationship, and he soon established a family altar. The Sunday school invited him, almost as soon as he entered the church, to become its superintendent, and his activity in that capacity was terminated only by his death. His piety was a primary and inwrought conviction and he consecrated to the church and to his fellow men that which was his to bestow. It would be a violation of the modesty of those who bear his name to enumerate the gifts to various causes which signalized the period of his religious life, but it is simple justice to his memory to state that always munificent in his benefactions, he in some years distributed to charity sums which many an ambitious man would regard as adequate fortunes. The Protestant Childrenâs Home, a costly edifice devoted to useful purposes, was a gift for a home for the orphaned or otherwise uncared for Protestant children of Covington. He was actively engaged in the preliminary movement which led to the introduction of a lay representation in the Methodist Episcopal church, and in 1872, as well as at each succeeding session, he was a member of the general conference of the church. Devoted to the interests of the Methodist Book Concern, watching its growth with peculiar pride; thoughtful for the Freedmanâs Aid Society and its wide benevolent work in the south; busied with plans for the aid of poor clergymen in the Kentucky conference; a pillar and pride of the local church â he was a noble specimen of the devout, God-fearing, diligent Christian. His beautiful life ended at his beautiful home in Covington on the 13th of November, 1892.\"\n\nOn the 10th of November, 1842, was solemnized the marriage of Mr. Shinkle to Miss Sarah Jane Hughes, and she survives him. They became the parents of only one child, Bradford Shinkle, and concerning him individual mention is made on other pages of this work. [A HISTORY OF KENTUCKY AND KENTUCKIANS By E.
