In some cases, if a famous person was born in one place but raised in another, we associated them with the county they grew up in.\n\nThe most famous person from each county in Ohio\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio â€” The Buckeye state has no shortage of celebrities. Famous musicians, all-time great athletes and coaches, even a few presidents were born and raised within the state lines. War heroes, businessmen and industrialists also count themselves among those from the great state of Ohio.\n\nWith no shortage of famous people, many of you may have wondered, \"Who is the most famous person from my part of the state?\"\n\nWorry not, you're about to get your answer.\n\nWe've compiled a list of the most famous person from each of Ohio's 88 counties. We considered people who were born and raised in each county. In some cases, if a famous person was born in one place but raised in another, we associated them with the county they grew up in.\n\nFor example: Urban Meyer was born in Toledo (Lucas County) but grew up in Ashtabula (Ashtabula County) and is more associated with that city. Warren G. Harding, on the other hand, moved to Marion County when he was 20, but grew up in Morrow County. And as a result, we listed him as Morrow County's most famous resident.\n\nSome counties have several famous natives, so we picked runners-up for those places. The project prompted a lot of conversation around the office, with folks arguing passionately about the relative \"famous-ness\" of some of our selections. We imagine you'll have some issues, too. Be sure to share your thoughts in the comments section.\n\nBy Patrick Cooley\n\nCleveland.com\n\nJ Pat Carter\n\nAdams County\n\nJack Roush is the chairman of the board of the engineering firm Roush Industries, but most readers probably know him as the owner of NASCAR team Roush Fenway Racing.
