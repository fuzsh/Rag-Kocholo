The Judge or Magistrate may, but is not required to, meet with the applicant or attorney filing the Application.\n\nAn emergency guardianship will be granted only if there is reasonable certainty that immediate action is required to prevent significant injury to the person or estate of the individual. The Probate Court recognizes that an emergency guardianship\n\nshould not be granted where another remedy may be appropriate.\n\nIf the Judge or Magistrate declines to grant an emergency guardianship, the Probate Court may, in its discretion, schedule the matter on an expedited basis.\n\nIf the Judge or Magistrate approves the request for emergency guardianship, the following will occur:\n\nA Judgment Entry will issue granting emergency guardianship for a period of seventy-two (72) hours.\n\nA hearing will be scheduled within seventy-two (72) hours in order to determine whether to extend the emergency order for up to thirty (30) days.

Due to the short time constraints the law imposes in emergency guardianship proceedings, the Court requires that all notices be served in person. If necessary, the applicant must file an application for appointment of a special process server, who must file a return of the service before expiration of the initial 72 hour emergency guardianship period or within three Court Days after filing of the entry granting an extension.\n\nAs soon as possible after the issuance of the emergency guardianship order, a Probate Court Investigator will visit with the ward.\n\nFollowing hearing, the Probate Court may extend the seventy-two (72) hour emergency guardianship for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, in which case a Judgment Entry will issue.\n\nShow More\n\nThis local rule is applicable to all guardians appointed by the Court pursuant to R.C. 2111.02. Comments and complaints (hereinafter collectively referred to as \"complaints\") received regarding the performance of guardians and the resulting documents and correspondence are considered to be case documents and accessible to the public, unless otherwise excluded pursuant to Superintendence Rule 44 (C)(2).

The Court will not accept an anonymous complaint. When the Court receives the written complaint regarding a guardian's performance, it will date-stamp the complaint. Complaints received by fax on days the Court is closed shall be deemed to have been received on the next day the Court is open.\n\nWhen a complaint is received at the Court by hand-delivery, fax, or mail:\n\nWithin five (5) court days of receipt of the complaint the Court shall send a letter to the complainant acknowledging the receipt of the complaint and providing a copy of this rule. A copy of that letter, the complaint and the rule shall be provided to the guardian and guardian’s counsel, unless previously mailed.\n\nWithin ten (10) court days of the mailing to the complainant, the Court shall perform an initial review of the complaint after a study of the guardianship case, and\n\nSend the complainant a letter dismissing the complaint as unsubstantiated/unspecific/insufficient and send a copy of the complaint and response to the guardian and guardian’s counsel; or\n\nSend a copy of the complaint to the guardian and guardian’s counsel and request a response to the complaint within fifteen (15) court days from the date of mailing. The forwarding letter shall advise the guardian and guardian’s counsel that a failure to respond will result in a show cause hearing being set with the attendance of the guardian required. A copy of the forwarding letter shall be provided to the complainant; or\n\nNotify the complainant, the guardian and guardian’s counsel and refer the matter to the Court Investigator for an investigation and a report within fifteen (15) court days from the date of referral; and/or\n\nWhen appropriate, refer the matter to the appropriate law enforcement agency pursuant to R.C. 2101.26 if the complaint alleges abuse, neglect, or exploitation of the ward. When the Court refers a complaint to law enforcement, the Court will take such emergency action as it determines necessary to protect the interests of the ward while being cognizant of the need to have minimal impact on investigation by law enforcement.\n\nUpon the expiration of the period for the responsive reports from the guardian or Court Investigator to be filed, or upon their earlier filing, the case file (including the written response(s) and the complaint) shall be submitted to the Magistrate and within fifteen (15) court days the Magistrate shall do one or more of the following:\n\nFind the complaint to have been resolved or unsubstantiated and advise the complainant, guardian and guardian’s counsel accordingly by letter;\n\nSet a review conference or a show cause hearing with notice to the complainant, the ward, the guardian and guardian’s counsel, and other interested parties; or\n\nAppoint a guardian ad litem or attorney to represent the best interests of the ward.\n\nExcept when administratively dismissing a complaint or acting in an emergency, the Court shall not act without a hearing.

At the hearing, the applicant must present satisfactory evidence of why one or both of the powers of attorney are ineffective in meeting the ward’s needs. The Court establishes a rebuttable presumption that valid durable powers of attorney are less restrictive alternatives to guardianship.\n\nIf the Court appoints the guardian, and the guardian is also the designated ward’s agent under a valid durable power of attorney or durable power of attorney for health care that remain in effect, the Court may order that one or both powers of attorney are deemed terminated and void, or may order that one or both powers of attorney remain valid and effective for purposes that the Court directs. If the guardian is permitted to use either or both powers of attorney the guardian is accountable as may be expressly ordered by the Court for all activities undertaken as agent under the powers of attorney.\n\nIf the Court appoints the guardian, and the guardian is not the designated agent under a valid durable power of attorney or durable power of attorney for health care, the powers of attorney are automatically deemed terminated and void, unless the Court orders otherwise.\n\nShow More\n\nAn applicant for appointment as a guardian, including as an emergency guardian, must submit to a civil and criminal record check satisfactory to the Court and execute and file with the Court an Authorization for Release of Information (Form 271.00) expressly authorizing the Brown County Probate Court to obtain from Ohio Courts Network (OCN) and any other law enforcement information system, any court system, current and previous residences, civil and criminal history records, driving records, birth records, public records or any criminal justice records that the applicant may have in any federal, state, county, and municipal jurisdictions.
