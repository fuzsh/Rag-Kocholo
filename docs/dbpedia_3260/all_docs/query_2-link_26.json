        "text": "Hi,\n\nMy name is Harvey Miller. I don't think that any of Dave's family will know who I am. I was Dave's roommate for our Freshman year at the U of R.\n\nWe had an exciting year together. Our first time away from home. (even though we both grew up locally) We had a lot in common. On Wednesday nights we would take a break from studying to watch our favorite TV programs in the lounge of our dorm.\n\nI played basketball that year and Dave became the manager on that team. We joined different Fraternities and I lived in the Fraternity house the next year, so we didn't spend as much time together.\n\nAfter graduation we went our separate ways, as most college friends do. I did see him on occasion at university functions and often thought of him.\n\nDave was a fine person. A good friend and gentleman. I can see from the pictures that he was a great family man.\n\nMy thoughts and Prayers are with all of you in this difficult time. My Wife passed three years ago, so I know the emotions you are dealing with. Rely on your Faith, Family and Friends.\n\nMy Condolences.\n\nHarvey"
