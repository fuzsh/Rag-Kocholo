        "text": "David W. Fisher\n\nHILTON – After a full and rich life, David W. Fisher, 82, passed away on December 12, 2020, at home with his wife and family by his side. He was born in Hornell, NY, and is predeceased by his parents, Ethel and Harold Fisher, and his sister, Kay Varlan-Britt.\n\nDavid is survived by his loving wife, Mary; children, David (Kristin Shields), Andrew, and Timothy (Megan) Fisher, Wendy (Richard Sheldon) Salamone; Habteab (Saba) Yemane; grandchildren, Cassidy (Landon Allen) and William Salamone, Hannah and Nathan Yemane, Kailyn and Anthony Sheldon, and Brandon O’Brien; sister-in-law, Christine (Christopher) Casaccia; brothers-in-laws, Lawrence Britt, William (Eileen) Perkins, Thomas (Ethel) Perkins, and Timothy (Anne) Perkins, and many nieces, nephews, cousins and dear friends. A special thank you to Tom and Eileen Henion for their love and support.\n\nAfter 30 years of service in financial positions in the U.S. and Europe, David retired from the Eastman Kodak Company in 1994. He joined the staff of Oak Orchard Community Health Center and after 15 years, retired as the President/CEO in 2013. In 2012, he was honored to be the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Community Health Care Association of NYS.\n\nDavid was active in the Parma community, serving 20 years on the Town of Parma Zoning, Planning, and Town Boards. He was a member of the Hilton Board of Education for ten years, including three as President. For 16 years, he served on a number of advisory and governing boards with the Park Ridge Health System.\n\nDavid was a friendly, caring, kind person who always had a twinkle in his eyes. He was a dedicated, active member of Hilton Baptist Church. He loved to entertain his family and friends and was known for his clambakes, picnics, Easter egg hunts, cross country ski parties and game nights. Most of all, he loved his family and found great joy in spending time with his grandchildren.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to David's Memorial Service on Saturday, September 11, at 11:00 am, at the Hilton Baptist Church, 50 Lake Ave, Hilton, NY.\n\nDave loved hosting picnics and parties. Following the service, we will remember and celebrate him with a picnic at the Fisher home (maps will be available at the church).\n\nThose wishing may make memorial donations in David's name to the Hilton Baptist Church, 50 Lake Ave., Hilton, NY 14468.
