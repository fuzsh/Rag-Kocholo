        "text": "CINCINNATI — During a presentation in Georgetown, Ohio, Spectrum joined Ohio State Representative Adam Bird and Brown County Commissioners in announcing a project that, along with a previously announced project, will provide gigabit speed broadband access to a projected 6,160 homes and small businesses in Brown County.\n\nFunding for the projects comes from Charter Communications (Spectrum), the Federal Communication Commission’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), Brown County and the Ohio Residential Broadband Expansion Grant Program.\n\nOhio State Representative Adam Bird said today’s announcement will have a significant impact on the county’s future economic growth and quality of life.\n\n“High-speed internet has become an integral part of life – for our businesses, homes, and communities. Spectrum’s commitment to bring its high-speed internet access to my constituents through federal and state programs is a boon for our area,” he said.\n\nSpectrum serves nearly 2.8 million customers and employs almost 8,000 residents in Ohio.\n\n“Spectrum is bringing gigabit broadband to unserved communities across America through RDOF and other state and local programs such as our agreement with Brown County,” said Jeff Gehrig, Regional Vice President. “Our investment is making it possible to deliver the high-value broadband, mobile, TV and voice services which is already available in parts of Brown County. We are providing residents and small businesses superior connectivity at highly competitive prices, backed by a team of skilled local technicians and U.S.-based customer service.”\n\nBrown County Board of Commission President Barry Woodruff said broadband connectivity is important economic prosperity and residents’ quality of life.\n\n“Today, we’re celebrating the next step in our journey to 100% access for all of Brown County with the Ohio Residential Broadband Expansion Grant Program and the federal RDOF buildouts. Our residents and businesses need access to reliable and fast broadband speeds, and Spectrum will deliver that for Brown County. We look forward to the future of connectivity,” he said.\n\nBroadband Speeds up to 1 Gbps, Plus Money-Saving Mobile Options and 85,000 On Demand Choices\n\nSpectrum Internet delivers speeds up to 1 Gbps and Advanced WiFi for both residential customers and small business clients, featuring starting speeds of 300 Mbps, with no modem fees, data caps or contracts.
