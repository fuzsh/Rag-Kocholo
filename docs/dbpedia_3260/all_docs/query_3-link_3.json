H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 274 Jefferson Twp. -\n\nJAMES BAIRD, farmer, P. O. Russellville. Among the pioneer families of Brown County, there are but few whose names are so well known and who are as highly esteemed by the community as are the Bairds. George Baird, the pioneer, was born June 15, 1771, in Pennsylvania. His father, William Baird, was an old Revolutionary soldier, who settled in Virginia some time after the close of the war. On Sept.15, 1796, were celebrated the nuptials of George and Jane (Moore) Baird. By this union there were born ten children, five in Virginia, and subsequently five in Ohio. In the year 1803 - 04, they emigrated to Ohio, and settled in what is now known as Jefferson Township, Brown Co., Ohio, on 300 acres of land about where James, their son, at present resides. He built his log cabin and prepared himself for the more arduous task of clearing the land. He served during the war of 1812 for about thirty days, but was not under fire. About the year 1817, he built a large two story hewed-long house, which was more commodious and better adapted to the wants of his family. The family continued to occupy this building till about the year 1835-36, when James, his son, the subject of this sketch, built a new brick house near the site first occupied by the log cabin, in which house he remained for perhaps two years, when he died in December, 1838, his wife having died in October, 1820. The cares of the household were then devolved upon his daughters, who performed them for the greater part of the time. His daughter Elizabeth, being the last one at home, having married, he was obliged to substitute in her stead foreign domestics. This state of affairs existed until the marriage of his son James, whose wife then took charge of affairs. Mr. Baird was of a kind and generous nature, given to hospitality, especially to the poor and needy. IN his transactions with his fellow-men, he was always strictly honorable, and his death was the occasion of considerable sorrow and regret. James Baird, our subject, was born in June, 1809, in Brown County, Ohio, and received but a limited education. On Nov. 8, 1832, he married Miss Martha Bowar, who emigrated from Pennsylvania to Brown County about 1812. After remaining in the neighborhood of Ripley for a short time, they (Mr. Bowar and family) moved into the neighborhood of Pilson's Mill, where they became permanently settled. Mr. Baird claims that from the time his wife's parents settled there to the present time, \"they have not lived one-half mile apart.\" To them have been born nine children - William S., George N., Robert B. (deceased, who enlisted in the Seventieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry during the war of the rebellion, and participated in the battle of Pittsburg Landing, in the attack on Fort McAllister, and subsequently was with Sherman in his grand march to the sea), Lewis W. (who enlisted in the Seventieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and continued in the service until the close of the war, and participated in the attack on Fort McAllister; carried into the ramparts, facing shot and bayonets, the first Union flag), James A., Albert M., Sarah E., Jesse L. and Jane (deceased, who married William B. Carey). Mr. Carey was a soldier in the Union Army, was captured by the rebels in Virginia and thrown into different Southern prisons until he was sent to Andersonville, where he met with the fate of starvation. Mr. Baird has also reared three of his grandchildren from infancy - George B., Ella C. Carey (deceased) and William C. son of James A. Baird. Mr. Baird states that since the new house has been built on the homestead, it has never been left a night without an occupant, which is an uncommon occurrence. He has served as Trustee for Jefferson Township, and is a member of the Presbyterian Church, in which denomination he has acted as Elder for perhaps thirty-nine years. He received from his father eighty acres of land as his inheritance, and by his industry, perseverance and good management had at one time about three hundred acres. He is still hale and hearty, of a pleasant nature and veryentertaining.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H. Beers & Co. - 1883 - Page 232 Eagle Twp. -\n\nJESSE J.

He married Katherine Yockey a native of Alsace, Lorraine, and while Burgeomiester of the village, had six sons born to him. During this period, the French and German empires were constantly quarrelling over the possession of his native villages, and each had it garrisoned at frequent intervals. The first son was born while the town was under German rule, the other while under French, and so on, alternately, till our subject, the sixth son, was born, the town at that time being a French possession. Of the six sons born in one house, three were German by birth, and three French. Mr. Biehn had a good position in his native country, and was a man well to do in life. He did not like the cramped position which liberty was forced to occupy, and a hope of freedom, coupled with a strong desire to find, a better home for his children, induced to him to come to America. In 1835, he made the journey, and located in Washington Township, Brown County, Ohio, where he was engaged in farming. He died in February, 1862, and is buried on the homestead farm.

In 1874, he commenced dealing in leaf tobacco, barreled pork and flour, having at one time 75,000 pounds of tobacco, 1,000 barrels of flour and 250 barrels of pork.

Mr. Burgett is probably the oldest inhabitant, by birth, in Pleasant Township, and none is more highly esteemed.

His long life has not been a failure financially, for he has amassed a sum sufficient for old age, and to benefit those who survive him.\n\nSource: The History of Brown County Ohio - Chicago - W. H.
