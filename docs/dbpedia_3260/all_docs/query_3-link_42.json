        "text": "This year’s Brown County Fair saw a huge turnout of crowds looking to enjoy some of the best family fun the area has to offer.\n\nThis year’s Brown County Fair theme was “Harvest the Memories” and the grand marshals were Gene and Bev Lawwill.\n\nThe Brown County Fair opening parade began its journey through Georgetown at 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 25 with crowds of people lining the streets to witness the official start of the Little State Fair.\n\nFrom there, the parade made its way to the Brown County Fairgrounds where crowds then made their way to the Danny Gray Activity Center for the annual Brown County Fair King and Queen Contest.\n\nThis year’s judges were faced with tough decisions, judging a crew of outstanding contestants in this year’s king/queen contest.\n\nIn the end, it was Bailey Joy Davis, of the Red Oak Ranchers 4-H Club, being crowned the 2023 Brown County Fair Queen; while being crowned this year’s Brown County Fair King was Kyle Berry, of Eastern High School FFA.\n\nFirst runner-up in the queen contest was Rose Steigerwald, of Georgetown FFA. Second runner-up was Emma Attinger, of New Hope 4-H. Third runner-up was Leah Patchell, of Georgetown Hooves and Halters 4-H Club. Fourth runner-up in the queen contest was Makenna Scott, of Ripley-Union-Lewis-Huntington FFA.\n\nFirst runner-up in the king contest was Aiden Wilhelmy, of the Ringleaders 4-H Club. Second runner-up was Ely Hatten, of Georgetown Hooves and Halters. Third runner-up in the king contest was Bailey Kirker, of New Hope 4-H.\n\nSpecial 4-H awards are also handed out each year.\n\nThe Outstanding 4-Her Award is the highest honor a 4-H Club member can receive each year. Receiving Outstanding 4-Her awards this year were Bailey Joy Davis, of the Red Oak Ranchers and Cecelia Clubb, of the Ringleaders 4-H Club.\n\nThe 4-H awards were handed out by Ohio State University Extension Educator Christy Clary.\n\nReceiving 4-H Alumni awards were Dara Landess and Christi Rockey.\n\nReceiving the Friend of 4-H Award this year was Tina Howser. Tina Howser was unable to attend this year’s king/queen contest, so receiving the award on her behalf was her son, Jesse.\n\nThe popular Junior Fair animal sales were held on Friday and Saturday with many in attendance.\n\nWhile there are numerous events and forms of entertainment to enjoy at the Brown County Fair, many would agree that the best thing about the fair is having fun with family and friends. It’s a chance for the people and businesses of Brown County to come together each year and show support for local youth. It’s an opportunity to “harvest memories” that will last a lifetime.\n\nFor more information on this year’s Brown County Fair, visit https://thelittlestatefair.com."
