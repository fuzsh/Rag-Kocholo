        "text": "“David J.P. Fisher (D. Fish) is a sales expert, professional keynote speaker, and best-selling author. Building on over 20 years of experience as an entrepreneur and sales professional, he combines nuanced strategy and real-world tactics to guide individuals and organizations as they navigate and leverage the evolving landscape of sales.”\n\nThat’s a pretty good summation of my work. But what does it mean?\n\nI’ve built a career that spans many different areas, from sales and entrepreneurship to marketing and personal development. In doing so, I’ve noticed that the world has continued to become more and more interconnected.\n\nThat’s why I focus a lot of my work on the growing slice of business where digital selling, relationship-building, and old-school sales skills converge. My goal is to help create sustainable business growth by enabling those I work with to build robust relationships with their clients and prospects…relationships that lead to more opportunities, easier conversations, and faster sales cycles.\n\nI have written extensively on both online and offline relationship-building and business development. (Some sources call me a thought-leader, whatever that means). I’m the author of 12 best-selling books in the Networking in the 21st Century series as well as Hyper-Connected Selling. I’m a contributing influencer to the LinkedIn Sales and Marketing Blogs, Saleshacker’s Blog, and the Hubspot Sales Blog and I’ve contributed to sites such as The Social Media Examiner, Forbes, and Spin Sucks.\n\nI also host the Beer, Beats, & Business Podcast – where I get a chance to interview leading experts, entrepreneurs, and authors (and share a great beer in the process).\n\nI’ve built a reputation for bringing energy and humor to the room while working with organizations across the globe as a consultant and sales trainer. I’m able to draw on decades of experience as a performer and speaker, which helps me mix information, education, and entertainment into a combination that makes the time fly and audiences eager to engage with the material.\n\n(And though I might not have become a RockStar through music, I did pick up my nickname on the stage – D. Fish is certainly not a name you can give yourself. I was the drummer in a band and every once in a while would rap. My bandmates would jokingly call me “MC D. Fish”. And as nicknames have a tendency to do…it stuck).\n\nFor years I lived next to a beautiful cemetery which reminded me every morning of how precious life is. It’s hard to waste time when you know that one day you’re going to be on the other side of that fence. (It also made it a very bad idea to watch zombie movies right before bedtime). And now I live in Glenview, Illinois with my family.\n\nI’m a speaker, coach, salesman, writer, husband, father, meditator, marketer, musician, son, friend, brother, slam poet, comedian, salsa dancer, lover of life, teller of bad jokes, yoga enthusiast, and about average cook.\n\nBut that’s enough about me. What can I do for you? Let me know."
