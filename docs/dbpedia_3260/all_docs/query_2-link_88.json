        "text": "Chef David Fisher began his culinary career when he first served a beautifully executed grilled cheese at his parents' family restaurant. After attending Johnson and Wales, he competed in ACF Competitions and medaled—twice! David amassed an impressive repertoire of cooking techniques, from barbecue in Oklahoma to Michelin in New York City. He met his wife Serena while cooking at Pearl & Ash before they went on to create a 12-course pop-up at BoxKite in the East Village.\n\n​\n\nIn June 2017, David moved to California to pursue his interest in the legendary California produce. He held Chef de Cuisine roles at Bird Dog in Palo Alto and Sorrel in Pacific Heights. In 2020, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, David and Serena opened Marlena in Bernal Heights, which received one Michelin Star the following year (and retained it through their tenure). In 2022, David was inducted into StarChef's Class of Rising Star Chefs.\n\n​\n\nOn his days off, you can find David at the park playing fetch with their dog or on the ice playing hockey.\n\nChef Serena Chow Fisher's love of pastry stems from sharing Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream with her childhood best friend and making FunFetti cakes for her stuffed animals. Her first kitchen job was at a West Village cupcake, wine, and beer bar until she graduated from New York University. She decided to pursue her love of pastry at the French Culinary Institute before landing the prestigious gig working under Angela Pinkerton at Eleven Madison Park.\n\n​\n\nSince then, she's been the Pastry Chef at Pearl & Ash (where she met her husband, David) and Kat & Theo before moving to California to be closer to her family. Before opening Marlena with David, she held the roles of Pastry Chef at Bird Dog and Bakery Manager at Backhaus. In 2021, Esquire Magazine featured Serena as the Best Pastry Chef in America before she was inducted into StarChef's 2022 Class of Rising Star Chefs.\n\n​\n\nIn 2023, Serena fulfilled her lifelong dream of ice cream by opening Jack & Remi (named after their two pups), available for pick-up throughout San Francisco. On her days off, she can be found reading a book in bed or powerlifting in the gym.\n\nDaniel Urrutia was born and raised in the food-centric city of Mexico City. Some of his fondest moments were that of cooking with his father over the grill, the charcoal and smoke creating visceral memories for years to come. Daniel moved to the United States in 1998 to pursue his career and love of the restaurant world. His very first restaurant job was as a dishwasher at The Macaroni Grill.\n\n​\n\nAs Daniel's appetite for learning and experience grew, so did his passion for providing excellent and unique dining experiences. He's been privileged to work and mentored in some of San Francisco's most beloved and highly-awarded restaurants, such as Atelier Crenn, Saison, and Chef's Table Brooklyn Fare. Daniel has done it all—Captain, General Manager, Maitre'd, and Sommelier—and he joins 7 Adams to create a welcoming atmosphere that feels like a warm family meal, executed with meticulous details and calibrated excellence.\n\n​\n\nDaniel's favorite activity on his days off is watching his son grow up and playing soccer in the sun."
