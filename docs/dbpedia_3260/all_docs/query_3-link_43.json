        "text": "The legendary Brown County Bluegrass Festival, takes place annually at the Brown County Fairgrounds in Georgetown, Ohio. The dynamic Brown County Bluegrass team has pulled together the very best talent, venue, and special events required for an enjoyable bluegrass festival experience. The lineup is always first class with three full days of some of the hottest names on today’s bluegrass music circuit taking the stage.\n\nAmple electrical and water hookups for camping, newly renovated bath houses, and food/merchandise vendors are offered to make everyone comfortable while they enjoy great music all weekend long.\n\nCampers are permitted to move in on the Monday before the festival begins. Early camper arrivals are invited to join the gang for three nights of “Dinner on the Grounds”\n\nMonday–Chili Cook Off; bring a big pot of your best chili recipe and see how it stands up to the “taste test” of those in attendance. We also invite you to bring a “dish to pass” to help fill out the table.\n\nTuesday–Southern Bean Supper; we supply the beans, cooked southern style, and you bring along a “dish to pass” or cornbread or that favorite dessert you love to share. Or perhaps you have THE best southern-style bean recipe on the face of the earth and you’d like to share a pot of your beans…please do so!\n\nWednesday– Edgar’s Famous Fish Fry…Edgar Loudermilk has caught the fish, cleaned the fish, and will fry the fish! Again, if attendees would please bring along a “dish to pass,” the gang would be much obliged. This is a BIG night at the festival!\n\nFestival Seating–There is plenty of room for lawn chairs on the infield of the equestrian area of the grounds (just in front of the covered stage) and a large covered grandstand directly behind the infield for shade seekers. Year in and year out there are many return visitors, in addition to many new faces as our “family friendly” festival continues to grow. Please see our Festival Guidelines for lawn chair requirements.\n\nOh, and did we mention campground jamming?! Music, non-stop all week long! Tune up your fiddle, bring along your banjo, get out the guitar, bust out the bass, and make tracks with that mandolin to the Brown County Bluegrass Festival. Pick a tune, sing a song, catch up with old friends, and make a few new ones along the way!\n\nCome be a part of the Brown County Bluegrass Festival family!\n\nIn addition to tickets being available at the gate, we offer advance ticket-ordering options for your convenience.\n\nTICKETS\n\nBeware of on-line ticket scams from “third party” individuals. This site will be the ONLY official ticketing site for the Brown County Bluegrass Festival. Tickets offered on other sites or by scammers will not be honored.

We would rather measure at the beginning than to have you have to move/relocate your camper after you’re already set up and parked. Thank you!\n\n—Arm bands must be worn at all times. Please note, you must also wear your arm band to be admitted to our early camper “Dinner on the Grounds” events (we’ll be checking arm bands at the door).\n\n—Show is rain or shine. In the case of inclement weather, show will be moved to one of the fairground’s indoor facilities.\n\n—Pets: No pets within the stage/arena area, nor the concession area. Please keep pets leashed and tended to within the fairgrounds. Pets must be up-to-date on all shots.\n\n—No golf carts inside the arena; golf carts should be operated by licensed drivers; golf cart owner assumes all liability.\n\n—We request no smoking in the concert seating area; this is for the comfort of not only the audience members, but also the performers. In addition, by order of the fire marshall, no smoking in the grandstand.\n\n–Please silence cell phones within the concert seating arena/grandstand.\n\n–We request that conversations within the concert seating arena/grandstand be kept to a whisper and to a minimum. Folks have spent good money to hear the performers and we would like for all of our patrons to have a wonderful experience listening to the talent on stage. Feel free to step outside of the concert seating arena/grandstand and enjoy visiting with your friends. Thank you.\n\n—Alcohol is permitted on the festival grounds; however, we request no “open containers” within the concert arena/grandstand (please use a can/bottle koozie.)\n\n—Standard height lawn chairs only within the infield seating arena.

No high back or reclining chairs in the middle sections.\n\n–Performers and schedule are subject to change.\n\n—Tickets are non refundable.\n\n—PLEASE NOTE BEGINNING IN 2025, the Brown County Fairgrounds does NOT have a public pumping station available on site. However, our festival will offer pumping service through the week where you will schedule/pay.\n\nFAIRGROUND DIRECTIONS\n\nBrown County Fairgrounds\n\n325 W State Street\n\nGeorgetown, Ohio 45121"
