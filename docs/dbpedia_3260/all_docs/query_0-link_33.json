        "text": "Jacob FISHER (1801-1858) and Juliana Asia BOYD (1810-1870)\n\nmy 3g-grandparents\n\nJacob FISHER, my 3g-grandfather, was born about 1801 in Kentucky, and moved to Indiana by 1830. I have not found any records for him before 1830. There were many Jacob FISHERs!\n\nA gravestone in Prickett Cemetery, Jalapa, Grant County, IN for Jacob R. FISHER has birth date 10 May 1800 and death 5 Feb 1857, age 56 y, 8 m, 26 d. [The gravestone in the photo is hard to read; I assume that the transcriber had a better look at it.] This matches the known details, so I tentatively accept these as the dates for our Jacob FISHER, and his middle initial, R. It is curious that the grave is in Grant County, not close to Martin or Lawrence Counties. The death date also makes sense, as our Jacob was not with the family in the 1860 Census, and no later record of him seems to exist.\n\nHowever, [JBBC, p.27] says that Jacob died on 14 Dec 1858. But it also says that \"he was thought to be an immigrant from Germany\". There does seem to have been another Jacob FISHER in the area, who was born in Germany. There are many mistakes in the records.\n\n[There was also a Jacob R. FISHER, born about 1804 in NC, lived in Huntington County, IN, but he married Amelia M. LANE on 4-5 Nov 1829 in Wayne, IN. He died 4 Mar 1883 in Polk, Huntington, IN. His wife was Catherine in the 1850 US Census.]\n\nJuliana/Julia Asia BOYD, my 3g-grandmother, was born 27 May 1810 in Nicholas County, KY, the daughter of John BOYD Jr and Ann \"Nancy\" MARTIN. [JBBC] Her family moved from KY to IN in 1826. The BOYD ancestry can be traced back 2 more generations. See the John BOYD Jr page.\n\nThe current map above shows the location of Daviess, Martin and Lawrence counties in southwestern Indiana. In Martin County, the northern part of Mitcheltree Township used to be called Baker Township. It was the home of a large FISHER family in 1850.\n\nFISHER families in the 1870 US Census for Baker, Martin, IN\n\nThe 1870 Census has several FISHER families in Baker Township, listed consecutively or close, so they probably lived close together, and must be related. This provides several clues about family relationships.\n\nElisha FISHER (39) was head of family 147. His wife was Mary C (27) and children Amanda E (12), William G (4), Wickliff D (2) and Joseph A (6/12). The birth of Joseph A was explicitly given as Dec 1869. The eldest child present, Amanda E, was a daughter of Elisha and his first wife. See the section on Elisha, below.\n\nNearby, family 149 was Jacob A FISHER (43) and Perlitha A (33). I believe he was a nephew of Jacob the subject of this page. Jacob A was born about 1827, in IN.\n\nNext, family 150 was Elias FISHER (37), Alaertta G (35), Thomas J (15), Sarah M (10), Mary J (8), Nancy A (5), Mary E (3), and Fany E (1). Elias was probably Elijah, the younger brother of Elisha. See the section below. Elijah and Agnietta (spelled various ways) also appeared with his mother, Julian(a), in the 1860 Census, above.\n\nFamily 159 was Nathan FISHER (31), Elizabeth (37), Margaret (13), Manda A (11), James A (9), and John William (6/12). Nathan was another son of Jacob and Juliana.\n\nMigration\n\nJacob and Juliana were both born in KY. Juliana came to Lawrence County, IN with her parents and siblings in 1826, and Jacob was there by 1830, as they were married 6 Oct 1830 in Bedford, Lawrence County. Jacob bought land near Bedford, on 1 Aug 1837.\n\nThe 1840 US Census finds them in neighboring Martin County, IN, and in 1850 they were in Baker Township, Martin County. On 1 Sep 1852, Jacob bought land in Martin, this time in Rutherford Township. I don't know if the family ever lived there. Most of the children seem to have been born in Martin, probably in Baker Township, and most were still in Baker in 1860 and 1870. (Baker later became the northern part of Mitcheltree Township.)\n\nChildren of Jacob FISHER and Juliana Asia BOYD\n\nJacob and Juliana had 11 children. A main resource is [JBBC], which lists the 11 children on p. 27, and has a chapter for each of their families, except Nancy and Noah, on pp. 303-324. This book seems very authoritative, but has a few mistakes, and I use its data as a starting point, trying to verify the details.\n\nJacob died shortly before the American Civil War, and 3 of his sons were killed in the war.\n\nFor brevity: Martin and Lawrence are counties in IN.\n\nJacob FISHER b: 10 May 1800 in KY, d: 5 Feb 1857 or 14 Dec 1858 in IN, age 56 or 58\n\n+ Juliana Asia BOYD b: 27 May 1810 in Nicholas, KY, m: 6 Oct 1830 in Bedford, Lawrence, d: 1870 in Martin, age 59-60\n\n......1.

He married (1) on 28 Nov 1858 Leanna J. MITCHELL, b. about 1839 in Lawrence, IN, (2) about 1900 Mary Chilton BAKER, and (3) Polly H. CRAIG, b. 1839. Also, the children of Elisha FISHER, born 1858-1882, were from Mary Chilton BAKER, which doesn't see reasonable if Elisha and Mary were married about 1900. Clearly the marriages of Mary BAKER and Leanna J. MITCHELL are conflated.\n\nAfter much research, I think the correct order is this. Elisha married (1) Leanna J. MITCHELL on 26 Feb 1852, in Martin, IN. They had 1 child, on 1 Jan 1858, and Leanna died 5 months after giving birth. Elisha married (2) Mary Chilton BAKER on 28 Nov 1858 in Lawrence, IN. They had 5 children. Late in life, Elisha married (3) Mary Hubbard \"Polly\" (CRAIG) HACKLER on 22 Nov 1900 in Lawrence County.\n\nMary Chilton BAKER has a gravestone in Silverville First Baptist Church Cemetery, Silverville, Lawrence, IN. From the stone, it looks like she died 18 Jul 18?? at age 54. From the census records, she was born about 1841-3 in IN.\n\nLeanna MITCHELL/MITCHEL was known by many names: Leanna, Leaner, Jane, Ellen. Her name was spelled Leaner on her gravestone, in Dog Trot Cemetery, Martin County, IN. But I believe that Elisha only married one MITCHELL. They were married less than 7 years. The gravestone has birthdate 9 Dec 183? with the last digit transcribed as 0 on Findagrave. The 1830 date makes more sense than 1839 since she was married in 1852. The death date is 1? Jun 1858 and the transcriber has 1 Jun 1858.\n\nMary Hubbard \"Polly\" CRAIG was born 6 Dec 1838 in Lawrence, and died 9 Jan 1914 in Lawrence. She was the widow of William Boyd HACKLER when she married Elisha. Both of her husbands had the middle name Boyd.\n\nChildren of Elisha Boyd FISHER\n\nHere is a summary of the children of Elisha Boyd FISHER, that I have found, citing evidence that our Elisha is their father.\n\ni. Amanda Ellen SEARS b: 1 Jan 1858 in IN, d: 25 Mar 1937 in Bedford, parents Elisha FISHER and Ellen MITCHELL. This comes from her death certificate. Amanda also provides the proof that Mary and Ellen were both wives of the same Elisha B. FISHER, since she appears as Manda E. FISHER (2) in the household of Elisha and Mary, 1860 US Census, above.\n\nii. William G. FISHER b: 1866 in IN. The only evidence for William is that he appears at age 4 in the 1870 US Census, in the household of Elisha and Mary, in Baker, Martin, IN.\n\niii. Wickleff Doden FISHER b: 27 Feb 1868, Mountain Spr, IN, parents Elisha B FISHER and Mary BAKER. (I don't know where \"Mountain Spr\" is, but this comes from his SSACI file.) His death certificate names his parents as Elijah FISHER and Mary BAKER, but I think Elisha is correct. He appears in the household of Elisha and Mary in the 1870 US Census, above.\n\niv. Joseph Alonzo FISHER b: 4 Apr 1870 in IN, d: 20 Mar 1929 in Owen, Jackson, IN, parents Elisha FISHER and Mary BAKER. This information comes from his death certificate. He appears as Joseph A FISHER, an infant in the household of Elisha and Mary in the 1870 US Census, above, although his birth date in the census is Dec 1869.\n\nv. Elmer Alexander FISHER b: 9 Aug 1875 in IN, parents Elisha FISHER and Mary BAKER. This comes from his death certificate.\n\nvi. Clara Fisher WAGNER b: 14 Aug 1882, b. IN, d. 11 Jun 1935 in Silverville, Lawrence, IN, parents Elijah FISHER and Mary BAKER. This comes from her death certificate.\n\nChildren of Elijah and Amasetta:\n\nThomas J. FISHER, age 25, was briefly admitted to the Lawrence County Asylum, from 30 Mar 1883 to 22 Jun 1883. His gravestone indicate that he was born in 1855 and died in 1936. His wife was Nancy C, born 1855 and died 1935.\n\nThomas J. FISHER b: 7 Feb 1855 in IN, d: 17 Sep 1936 in Loogootee, Martin, IN, parents Elijah FISHER and Everetta MITCHELL. This is all based on his death certificate. Other records indicate that his middle name was Jefferson, although he was probably the one called Jacob FISHER (43), with wife Perlitha (33), in the 1870 US Census. They appear near the families of brothers Elisha, Elijah and Nathan, in Baker, Martin, IN.\n\nMary Jane FISHER was born 13 April 1862, in Indiana, and died 16 Mar 1939, in the town of Williams, Lawrence County, Indiana, at age 76. She married Richard CLEMENTS. Her mother's maiden name was Amasetta MITCHELL. This is according to her death certificate.\n\nNancy A. FISHER was born 18 Mar 1865 in Martin County, Indiana. She married (1) CONDIFF, and (2) on 11 Sep 1911 to Thomas J. BRANNON, in Martin County, Indiana, his 4th marriage, and (3) John Spoonmore. This information comes from a marriage certificate and death certificate. The former says her mother was Aneesetta MITCHELL and the latter says Emma MITCHELL. Nancy died on 10 Apr 1939 in Bedford, Lawrence County, Indiana, at age 74, of breast cancer.\n\nFannie Ellen FISHER married Ira Lark FIELDS, son of William FIELDS and Margar et Ann LANTER. Fannie was born on 8 Sep 1869 in Indiana, and died 31 Oct 1933 in the town of Williams, Lawrence County, Indiana, at age 64. Her death certificate also names her parents as Jacob FISHER and Amesetta MITCHELL.\n\nMartha Ennis FISHER was born 23 Jun 1878 and died 24 May 1940.
