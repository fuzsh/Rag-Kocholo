Georgetown, Me., May 7, 1758; recorded July 7, 1758; d. at Amelia, 0H., Oct., 1830. About 1815 he moved to Amelia, Ohio, arriving there in the fall; he always made his home in that town, and is buried in the family cemetery near there. \"He made his way in a rough cart over the mountain roads to Pittsburg, Pa. He and his family went down the Ohio River on a raft of logs which they made. In 1827, when he was nearly 70 years old, he built a church. It was dedicated to God alone; to the free worship of every people who wished to learn of God. It did not belong to any denomination; it was not built for any sect; it was not erected to further his opinions, or any man's opinions about God and religion. No intermediary of saint or book, or tradition, was to come between the devout soul and the God of its worship. It was not even called a church of the Christian religion, but free for every people to worship God in. Climbing upon the frame of this new meeting house as it neared it neared completion, Alexander Thompson dedicated it with these words: \"Here stands a fine frame, and it should have a good name. It shall be called Republican-- free for all denominations to worship God in.\" And nearly every denomination in that part of Ohio at some time worshiped in the Republican Meeting House, including Jews and Mormons. Among the denominations which used the church with some regularity in those early days were Christians, Universalist, Protestant, Methodists, and Presbyterians. In it was held a memorable debate, said to have been of several weeks duration, between Hon. David Fisher, a neighbor of Mr. Thompson and a Universalist missionary.\"[1]\n\nM.
