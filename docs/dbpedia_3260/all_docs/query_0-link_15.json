It has been the intention to bring together genealogical material not already assembled, although much valuable work has been done previously in separate lines. However, diligent research was required, and numerous historical accounts of immigration, settlements of frontiers, and county histories have been carefully read, many court records deciphered, and hundreds of letters written.\n\nMost sincere thanks are expressed to those members of other branches of the family who have lent aid so generously.\n\nNumbers placed before names of individuals are for convenience and do not indicate the number of descendants, many of whom have not been included. A page number placed in parentheses at the left margin before a name indicates where the short biographical sketch of that individual may be found.\n\nG. F. H.\n\nJune 1, 1942.\n\nI.\n\nSEBASTIAN FISHER\n\nSEBASTIAN FISHER, a native of Germany, with his wife Susanna and their two small children, embarked for England at Rotterdam, Holland, on July 28, 1708. Just how long they had been in Holland is uncertain, but they embarked with a group of emigrants from devastated regions of Germany, mostly from the Palatinate which suffered even more than other regions from the terrible scourges of wars that Germany had been engaged in for a long time. Queen Anne of England invited these people to go to England, and promised that they should be sent later to America to settle in new homes. It was in one of the boatloads of these Germans that Sebastian left for England.\n\nThe case of Sebastian Fisher was different from the majority\n\nof these emigrants, although some were similar. He was a refugee,\n\naccording to tradition that seems to have some foundation in fact,\n\nwho was obliged to leave Germany, losing his title and estate, because\n\nhe had become involved in the poaching laws. However, there was\n\nmore to it all than a mere infringement of poaching laws. He was\n\nheir to a vast estate on which the more modern part of Hannover has\n\nsince been built. His family was important enough in political affairs\n\nfor him to incur the displeasure of those in power with whom he\n\nhad disagreed politically. Hence, the necessity for leaving his home-\n\nland with only what means he could carry with him.\n\nSebastian Fisher was a man of good intellect, and he had received\n\na good education from the standpoint of those days, probably at a\n\nGerman University. He possessed a great amount of courage and\n\ntenacity of purpose. Hardships and misery visited all the emigrants\n\nalike, for there was inadequate provision made for them in England,\n\nand it was almost as bad after they arrived in America a year later.\n\nOn the 13th or 14th of June. 1709, Sebastian and Susanna Fisher\n\nreached New York with only one of their children surviving. It was\n\nnecessary for all these immigrants to have shelter provided and\n\nrations of food and clothing until they could get established and\n\nprovide these things for themselves. There were others among them\n\nbeside Sebastian Fisher who had money with them, but supplies\n\ncould not be bought in those days. Many were given work on a pro-\n\nject established for them, but trouble came almost at once between the\n\nGermans and the English Colonists. Small villages were built along\n\nthe Hudson River on the Livingston Manor in which to house the\n\nGerman immigrants, and in 1711 Sebastian Fisher lived at Annsburg,\n\none of the villages. Later he was at Berne, N. Y. He was one of the\n\nmen who engaged in trying to get justice for his countrymen. Sev-\n\neral excellent accounts of the German immigrants have been con-\n\nsulted by the compiler, among them, Early Eighteenth Century\n\nPalatine Emigration by W. A. Knittle, and Oscar Rutins’ The Ger-\n\nman and Swiss Settlements of Colonial Pennsylvania : A Study of\n\nthe So-called Pennsylvania Dutch.\n\nBefore 1717 Sebastian Fisher and others purchased and paid for\n\nland in the Schoharie Valley and removed to Gerlachsdorf, which\n\nwas at first called Neu Cassell. Cassell in Germany was at that time\n\nthe seat of one branch of this Fisher family to which Sebastian\n\nFisher belonged. “Deutches Geschlecter Buch,” a compilation of\n\nmany volumes, states that members of this family were emigrants at an\n\nearly date to North America, it being the only Fisher family of which\n\nthis fact was recorded. They bore the same Christian names as did\n\nthe early American branch, Sebastian and Adam, for instance, and\n\nwere men of higher learning, holding responsible positions. It may\n\nbe of interest to note here that at the beginning of this century a\n\nwell-to-do descendant of Sebastian Fisher sent a lawyer to Hannover,\n\nGermany, to look into a supposed fortune due the American branch.\n\nNeedless to say the trip bore no results except to verify some of the\n\nfamily traditions.\n\nThe German immigrants who purchased land in the Schoharie\n\nValley in New York state could get no title to their land for the\n\nreason that the English had no title from the Indians. Since the\n\nimmigrants had paid their money in good faith they were angry and\n\ndisgusted when this became known to them.\n\nIn the spring of 1723 fifteen families, including Sebastian Fisher,\n\ndecided to go to Pennsylvania, hoping for better treatment than they\n\nhad received in New York. They traveled across the Schoharie Valley\n\nto the Susquehanna River. There they built boats and rafts, and with\n\ntheir families proceeded down the Susquehanna to the mouth of\n\nSwatara creek, a distance of about 150 miles. Ascending the Swatara\n\nthey crossed over the watershed into Tulpehocken Valley which is\n\nabout seventeen miles northwest of the present city of Reading, Pa.\n\nHere they prospered and others joined them, from New York and\n\nfrom Germany. At first there was trouble in procuring title to their\n\nland, and a petition is recorded in Pennsylvania Archives regarding\n\nthe matter. To this petition Sebastian Fisher signed his name in\n\nLatin. Although he was taxed in 1725, it is doubtful if Sebastian\n\nFisher ever received title to any land in Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles A.\n\nFisher, Selinsgrove, Pa., genealogist for the Fisher and many other\n\nPennsylvania families, states that he has searched thoroughlv and has\n\nfound no record of title.\n\nSebastian Fisher helped to found two of the oldest Lutheran\n\nchurches in Pennsylvania. Reeds, or Reids, Lutheran Church situated\n\nabout two miles east of the present town of Stouchsburg. and the\n\nTulpehocken Lutheran Church, now Christ Church, about a mile\n\nsouthwest of Stouchsburg. Reeds Church was founded in 1727, (and\n\nin 1730 they built a log schoolhouse near the church and hired a\n\nschoolmaster). When the Reeds, who were of the fifteen families\n\nwho came from N. Y. began to lean toward the Moravian doctrine,\n\nSebastian Fisher headed a list of 150 members who withdrew from\n\nReeds Church in 1743 and founded the Tulpehocken Church. Se-\n\nbastian’s name was signed to many petitions — for roads, and for\n\nother improvements. Sometimes he signed as “Sebastine Piscator.”\n\nHis name has not been found in the Pennsylvania records since\n\n1743. Dr. Charles A. Fisher who has so kindly furnished so much\n\nmaterial on the Pennsylvania history of the family thinks that he\n\nmay have migrated with one of his sons or perhaps returned to New\n\nYork state. The compiler offers the suggestion that he may have gone\n\nto Virginia. The opportunity has not come during any one of the\n\ncompiler’s several trips east to search the o’.d Fisher graveyards in\n\nVirginia, but there is some likelihood that his grave may be found\n\nthere.\n\nNo record of Susanna Fisher seems to have been found, but she\n\nbore one child after the removal to Tulpehocken, Pa.\n\nChildren :\n\nPage\n\n(7)2.

John Adam Fisher, b. ca. 1724; d. March, 1783.\n\nSECOND GENERATION\n\nII.\n\nLudwig (Lewis) Fisher (Sebastian) whose name seems to have\n\nbeen erroneously translated Lawrence in some instances, was, ac-\n\ncording to evidence from widely separated sources, the one surviving\n\nchild of Sebastian and Susanna Fisher when they arrived in America.\n\nMr. Charles B. Heinemann who furnished a very substantial portion\n\nto the compiler of the material on this branch, states that he hasn’t\n\nthe slightest doubt that Ludwig Fisher and Adam Fisher of Hamp-\n\nshire County, Va. (proven to have been a son of Sebastian) were\n\nof the same family, but that he has no proof that they were. Mem-\n\nbers of the compiler’s family, which is that of Adam of Hampshire\n\nCounty. Va., have been closely associated with proven descendants\n\nof Ludwig, or Lewis, Fisher in Missouri for more than one hun-\n\ndred years, and there has never been a doubt that they were all de-\n\nscended from the same immigrant ancestor.\n\nLawrence Fisher appears on the tax list in Tulpehocken, Pa. in\n\n1732 with Sebastian Fisher, but in no published history has the com-\n\npiler found the German equivalent, Lorenz. Lawrence and Ludwig\n\nmust have been the same person ; it cannot be otherwise, for on the\n\nSubsistance List in New York state in 1717, Sebastian and Susanna\n\nFisher are credited with only three children, who were — the eldest,\n\nborn in Germany; George Ulrich Fisher, born in N. Y. in 1712, died\n\nin Berks Co.. Pa. 1770; Peter Fisher, born Oct. 4, 1714, near Berne,\n\nN. Y. Furthermore, from Morton L. Montgomery’s Historical and\n\nBiographical Annals of Berks County, Pa. is quoted: “It is traditional\n\nthat this branch of the Fisher family had its origin in Sebastian\n\nFisher who in 1723 * * * came from Schoharie Valley, N. Y. and\n\nsettled in Tulpehocken and Heidelberg townships. In 1759 these\n\nFishers were taxables in Heidelberg township ; Jacob who paid\n\ntwenty pounds, Ulrich who paid five pounds, and Adam and Ludwig\n\nwho paid one pound each; and from one of these ancestors * * *.”\n\nLudwig Fisher was then a resident of Virginia, and may have been\n\na non-resident land owner.\n\nShortly before 1736 Ludwig Fisher was married to Anna Barbara\n\nBlankenbaker, daughter of Balthaser Blankenbaker. The Blanken-\n\nbakers were recent arrivals from Germany. They, with the Garrs\n\nand others, migrated to Spottsylvania Co., Va., and settled on ad-\n\njoining lands at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains and between\n\nthe Robinson and Rapidan Rivers, in what is now Madison Co., Va.\n\nRecords in Spottsylvania, Orange, and Culpeper Counties con-\n\ntain many entries concerning Ludwig Fisher. Often he is called\n\nLewis Fisher. At least once the name is spelled Lodowick. Lewis\n\nFisher was often in court to sue for debt. Once he was charged with\n\nassault and battery. On the 29th of October, 1753, Ludwig Fisher\n\nwitnessed the will of Lorenz (written Larence) Garr.\n\nIn Henning’s Statutes, Vol. VII, p. 22-23, Lewis Fisher is men-\n\ntioned as a foot soldier in the Culpeper Militia in March, 1756.\n\nLewis Fisher’s will was proved Julv 19, 1773, and is given here\n\nin full :\n\n“In the name of God, Amen. I, Lewis Fisher of Culpeper County,\n\nbeing in a low state of health, but sound and perfect memory, thanks\n\nbe to Almighty God for it, and calling to mind the uncertainty of\n\nthis-worldly affairs, have thought fit to make and ordain this my\n\nlast will and testament, in manner and form following:\n\n“I desire my body may be buried in such decent and Christian-like\n\nmanner as my Executors shall think fit. and as to those worldly goods\n\nwherewith it hath pleased God to bless me. I will and bestow in man-\n\nner and form following, viz. :\n\n“I give and bequeath to my loving wife, Barbara Fisher, all my\n\npersonal estate, to dispose of as she shall think proper. Likewise I lend\n\nto my loving wife the plantation and land whereon I now do live,\n\nduring her life ; after her decease I give it to my son, Barnet Fisher.\n\nIt is my will that Barnet Fisher and Adam Fisher shall pay my son\n\nStephen Fisher twenty pounds, as the land I gave them was of more\n\nvalue than Stephen’s. Barnet must pay fifteen pounds and Adam\n\nfive pounds, which is the difference of their lands.\n\n“Also my will is if my Germany estate should be recovered it\n\nshould be equally divided among all my children. And I do hereby\n\nconstitute and appoint my sons, Stephen Fisher and Adam Fisher,\n\njoint Executors of this my last will and testament, hereby revoking\n\nand disannulling all other will or wills, testament or testaments, be-\n\nfore made by me. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand\n\nand seal, this fourth day of February, One Thousand Seven Hundred\n\nand Seventy-three.”\n\nSealed and delivered in the presence of John Tompkins, Jacob\n\nWilhoit, Mark Finks.\n\nLewis Fisher was buried on his plantation a few miles from Crig-\n\nlersville, Madison Co., Va. No one of his descendants by the name\n\nof Fisher remained in Virginia, all his sons having removed to\n\nKentucky after the close of the Revolutionary War. A daughter and\n\nher husband were at one time living on the old Lewis Fisher place,\n\nbut nothing further is known of these Virginia descendants.\n\nChildren :\n\n(13) 8.

Eve Wilhoit.\n\nIII.\n\nGeorge Ulrich Fisher (Sebastian) was born in New York state\n\nabout 1712, and died in Tulpehocken Township, Berks County, Pa.,\n\nabout 1770. He was a farmer and in 1765 was a trustee of the Alta-\n\nlaha Lutheran Church at Rehersburg, Pa. His wife’s name has not\n\nbeen obtained.\n\nChildren :\n\n14. Martin Fisher ;\n\n15. Paul Fisher;\n\n16. Catherine Fisher;\n\n17. Magdalene Fisher, b. ; d. ; m. Daniel Angst;\n\n18. Barbara Fisher, b. ; d. ; m. Adam Redenbach.\n\n9\n\nIV.\n\nPeter Fisher (Sebastian) was born in the vicinity of Berne, X. Y..\n\nOct. 4, 1714. according to records in the Schoharie Lutheran Church.\n\nTradition says that Peter Fisher was married to Dorothea Ball either\n\nin Albany or Schoharie, N. Y. She may have been his second wife.\n\nFurther information regarding this son of Sebastian Fisher is lack-\n\ning, except that he had the following children :\n\n19. Elizabeth Fisher ;\n\n20. Anna Margaret Fisher ;\n\n21 Dorothea Fisher.\n\nJohn Jacob Fisher (Sebastian) was born in the Schoharie Valley.\n\nN. Y., about 1720. He was very small when his family brought him\n\nto the wild, Indian inhabited Tulpehocken Valley in what is now\n\nBerks County, Pa.\n\nOn December 9, 1743, John Jacob Fisher was married to Mary\n\nElizabeth Frederick, daughter of John Frederick. In the spring of\n\nthe same year Jacob and his father were among the founders of\n\nTulpehocken (Christ) Lutheran Church near Stouchsburg. Pa. In\n\n1747, he and his wife deeded five acres of land to this church. He\n\nwas an elder in this church for many years.\n\nIn 1771, the Rev. Frederick A. Muhlenberg wrote in his diary\n\nthat he met “old man Fisher” at the home of “J. F.” The latter was\n\nprobably Jacob’s son John who lived at this time six miles east of\n\nthe Susquehanna River in what is now Jordon Township. Northum-\n\nberland County, Pa. Dr. Charles A. Fisher, a descendant of John\n\nJacob Fisher, who has furnished so much information on this branch,\n\nbelieves that it was on this visit to his son that John Jacob Fisher\n\nexamined the Isle of Que land which he bought in 1773 from the\n\nmissionary’s father and mother.\n\nJacob, as he was known, was too old for active duty in the Revolu-\n\ntionary War. but he served on a relief committee in Tulpehocken\n\nTownship. Reference to this patriotic service is mentioned in Amer-\n\nican Archives.\n\nJacob Fisher and his wife are buried in the cemetery of the church\n\nwhich they helped to found. His will was recorded’ at Reading in\n\n1803. and it mentions the following children:\n\n(17)22. John Adam Fisher, b. Oct. 7, 1744; d. 1825; m. Mary\n\nElizabeth Ried ;\n\n23. J«.hn Fisher, b. 1746; d. ; m. Magdalene, probably daughter of Peter Meffert ;\n\n10\n\n24. Anna Catherine Fisher, b. 1747; d. 1837; m. Christian\n\nNoecker ;\n\n25. Magdalene Fisher, b. 1749; d. ; m. Jacob Reed;\n\n26. Christian Fisher, b. 1751 ; d. ; m. Maria Breitenbaugh.\n\nVI.\n\nAnn Elizabeth Fisher (Sebastian) was born in Schoharie Valley,\n\nN. Y., about 1722, and was brought to Pennsylvania when one year of\n\nage or less. In 1744 she was married to John Anspach, son of Balthaser\n\nAnspach, who also came from N. Y. John Anspach was born about\n\n1720 and died in 1777. His will mentions their children:\n\n27. John Adam Anspach ;\n\n28. John Jacob Anspach ;\n\n29. Eva Christina Anspach ;\n\n30. John Peter Anspach ;\n\n31. Mary Elizabeth Anspach.\n\nVII.\n\nJohn Adam Fisher (Sebastian) founder of the West Virginia\n\nbranch, was the youngest child of Sebastian and Susanna Fisher,\n\nand was born after they removed to Pennsylvania. No birth record\n\nhas been found, but proof of his place of birth and of his parentage\n\nhas been established. In the old Christ Church near Stouchsburg,\n\nPa., it is recorded that John Adam Fisher was sponsor for the son\n\nof his brother, John Jacob and wife, Mary Elizabeth, on Dec. 13,\n\n1747; and on Sept. 17, 1749, Adam Fisher and Christina Burkstoler\n\nwere sponsors for a child of Peter Wagner. On Aug. 29, 1757,\n\nJacob and his wife were sponsors for a daughter of Adam and\n\nChristina Fisher, named Mary Elizabeth; then on Oct. 29, 1758,\n\nJacob and his wife were again sponsors for a child of Adam and\n\nChristina — a son named John Jacob. The birth of Adam Fisher’s\n\nfourth child, John, is also recorded at Christ Church.\n\nChristina, wife of Adam Fisher, is believed to have been Christina\n\nBurkstoler, but there is no proof. Nor is there a record found of the\n\nbirth of their eldest son, Adam Fisher. It is clear, however, that\n\nwhen Adam and Christina set out for Virginia to establish a home,\n\nthey were the parents of four little children.\n\nThe land on which Adam Fisher settled was a part of the Lord\n\nFairfax Manor, and records and maps show that this was part of the\n\nland surveyed by the young George Washington. Land on which no\n\n11\n\nwhite man had ever lived, and to the present day it has remained in\n\nthe Fisher family. Hampshire County, Va., where Adam Fisher\n\nsettled was afterward divided, and the Fisher lands were then a\n\npart of Hardy County. Still later when West Virginia was created.\n\nHardv County became a county in the new state. In his will, how-\n\never. Adam called himself Adam Fisher, County of Hampshire,\n\nwhich distinguishes him from the other Adam Fishers then living\n\nin Virginia, among whom were Adam Fisher son of Lewis, in\n\nMadison County, and in Augusta County. Va.. Adam Fisher, one\n\nof four brothers who were sons of another Adam Fisher who\n\ndied of small pox near Philadelphia. Pa., in 1757. This father of\n\nfour sons is said to have been a younger son of a nobleman who\n\ncame to America in the 1740s. He may well have been a brother of\n\nSebastian, but no effort has been made here to run this branch to\n\nits source, although the compiler has a lifelong friend, now a resi-\n\ndent of St. Louis, who is descended from this Fisher line. Mention\n\nhas been made here only because of the proximity of the two dis-\n\ntinct families in Virginia. Kentucky and later in Missouri.\n\nAt the time that Adam and Christina Fisher left Pennsylvania\n\nmany Indian raids were being experienced in the Tulpehocken Val-\n\nley, and some feared that the entire country would be laid waste.\n\nConrad Weiser wrote in 1755 that another raid would be the destruc-\n\ntion of the settlers, but this did not come to pass as he predicted.\n\nIndian raids occurred in western Virginia too, and there are vivid\n\ndescriptions of them, written by eyewitnesses. With due allow-\n\nance made for exaggeration, the facts could have been nothing but\n\nterrifying to all the settlers. It is believed by some of the family that\n\nCatherine Fisher, youngest daughter of Adam and Christina, met her\n\ndeath in an Indian raid, but it was a subject which her brother. Dr.\n\nJacob Fisher would never talk about, but there is no doubt that he\n\nknew the facts.\n\nAdam Fisher, too frail and along in years, could not serve in the\n\nArmy during the Revolutionary War, but provided flour and other\n\nsupplies to the Army. Records in Romney. Hampshire Co. in the\n\nform of a receipt signed by Abel Randall, show that at one date, two\n\nyears before his death Adam Fisher. Senior, furnished six hundred\n\nand sixty-nine pounds of flour. There are other records, earlier. Three\n\nof Adam’s sons served in the Army.\n\nAdam Fisher’s will was recorded March 11, 1783. The inventory\n\nof his movable property is a history of the lives of these hardy pio-\n\nneer families. It lists no luxuries, but there was an abundance of the\n\nnecessities. Even in this wilderness they had their books and slates, for\n\nthe education of their children was never neglected.\n\nChildren of Adam and Christina Fisher:\n\n(18)32.

He was born in\n\nCulpeper County, Va., in 1736, and remained a resident of that state\n\nuntil after the close of the Revolution. During that war he served\n\nas pack horse master under Col. Bowman, and was wounded in the\n\nright shoulder during an engagement with the Indians. As soon as\n\nhe recovered he returned and served to the end of the war. He was\n\nassigned during his service to duty in Kentucky, and after the war he\n\nbegan to acquire land in that country ; some was in grants for military\n\nservice, but he sold his lands in Virginia and bought vast holdings\n\nin Kentucky. His home was in Mercer County, now Boyle County,\n\nKy. where he died about May 20. 1817.\n\nStephen Fisher’s wife, before her marriage was Mary Magdalene\n\nGarr, and all their descendants have been carefully traced and re-\n\ncorded in The Garr Genealogy, bv John C.

He served as a private in the First\n\nVirginia Line Regt. from Culpeper County. Many of his descendants\n\nhave entered the Daughters of the American Revolution through\n\nthis record of service.\n\nAdam Fisher’s activities following the Revolution are very closely\n\nassociated with those of his brother, (8) Stephen, and like him\n\nAdam went to Kentucky, acquiring a great amount of land and mak-\n\ning his home in Mercer County.\n\nIn 1787 Adam Fisher signed a petition in Kentucky with his\n\nyounger brother (13) Barnett and his nephew (41) Elias Fisher\n\nasking for a right to establish a new state.

Mr. Charles B. Heinemann, com-\n\npiler of “Fisher Families of Virginia” has personally furnished the\n\nmaterial given here, except for such of the more recent generations\n\nwho lived in Missouri, some of whom have been closely associated\n\nwith the present compiler’s family.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 1781, Barnett Fisher was given a warrant in Cul-\n\npeper County, Va., for two hundred pounds of grass beef for the\n\nArmy. He also supplied brandy for the troops, as is recorded on page\n\n27 of the order book of Culpeper County.\n\nFollowing the example of his brothers, Barnett Fisher began ac-\n\nquiring land in Kentucky. As early as Oct. 15, 1779, he received a\n\ngrant of 500 acres in Jefferson County ; and on March 5, 1782, he re-\n\nceived by pre-emption warrant 1000 acres in Mercer County. Other\n\ngrants and patents between 1780 and 1783 amounted to 3,253 acres.\n\nOn April 29, 1786. Bernard Fisher (the English version being\n\nBarnett), Eve his wife, and Barbara his mother, sold land in Cul-\n\nI>eper County. Va.. to Leonard Christler and Solomon Carpenter, as\n\nrecorded in deed book N.p. 439 and 444. He first appeared on the\n\nMercer County, Ky. tax list in 1789.\n\nBarnett Fisher died intestate in what was then Mercer County, now\n\nBoyle County. Ky. and his estate was appraised on Feb. 12, 1824, and\n\n10\n\nrecorded in will book 8, p. 127. He and his wife, who died Sept. 28,\n\n1823, are buried in the family burying ground.\n\nChildren :\n\n(28)77. John Fisher, b. ca. 1770; d. 1834; m. Anne , in Virginia;\n\n(29)78.

His is the only\n\nfamily of this Pennsylvania branch of the Fishers that will be car-\n\nried further than the second generation in America, since all the\n\ndescendants of John Jacob Fisher have been traced and included in\n\nthe work that Dr. Charles Fisher of Selinsgrove, Pa. has done.\n\nJohn Adam Fisher was named for his uncle, John Adam Fisher,\n\nfounder of the West Virginia branch. He was born Oct. 7, 1744, in\n\nTulpehocken Township, Berks County, Pa., and was married on\n\nApril 26. 1768, to Mary Elizabeth Ried whose family came to\n\nPennsylvania at the time of the Fishers’ migration.\n\nIn 1774 John Adam removed to the land on the Isle of Que that\n\nhis father had bought from Rev. Henry Melchoir Muhlenburg and\n\nhis wife Mary, daughter of Conrad Weiser. In 1784 Adam pur-\n\nchased his father’s share of this land, and in 1787 he bought at\n\nsheriff’s sale the farm of Benjamin Weiser which joined his land\n\non the north.\n\nFrom 1779 to 1781 Adam Fisher was road supervisor in Penn\n\nTownship, Snyder County, Pa., and in 1791 he established a ferry\n\nacross the Susquehanna River, the eastern end of which was at the\n\nvillage of Fisher’s Ferry, and the western end at the present home\n\nof Michael Oliver and Frank Fisher on the Isle of Que. This ferry\n\nwas the direct route from Berks County and the whole southeastern\n\nsection of the state into the Middle Creek and Penns Valleys which\n\nwere rapidly filling up with settlers from the lower part of the com-\n\nmonwealth. In 1794 he was taxed with a ferry and a store besides\n\nhis land holdings.\n\nIn 1801. he and his sons, Christian and John, contributed heavily\n\nfor the First Lutheran Church in Selinsgrove. In 1807 he bought\n\n144 acres along the banks of Middle Creek, later owned by his son\n\nJohn. In 1811 Adam sold the upper half of the Isle of Que to his\n\n17\n\nson, John George, and the lower half to his son. Christian. To the\n\npresent time the lower part remains in the Fisher family in direct\n\nline of descent.\n\nAdam Fisher received depreciation pay for Revolutionary service\n\nin Berks County Militia, and in 1780 he was a private in Lieut. Jacob\n\nSpeece’s Company of Rangers from Northumberland County, Pa.\n\nJohn Adam Fisher died in Penn Township. Snyder Co.. Pa. on\n\nNov. 24. 1825. He and his wife are buried in the old Lutheran ceme-\n\ntery at Selinsgrove.\n\nChildren :\n\n83. John Adam Fisher, b. 1769; d. Dec. 12, 1798; m ;\n\n84. Christian Fisher, b.

Polly Yocum.\n\nXXXII.\n\nAdam Fisher (Adam, Sebastian) was undoubtedly the eldest son\n\nof Adam and Christina Fisher, although thus far his birth record has\n\nnot been found. Adam Fisher. Sr.. in his will was careful to name\n\nhis six sons in order of age and Adam, Jr. is named first.\n\nAdam Fisher. Jr. was married to Jemima Mace, who survived him.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Jemima’s surname is spelled with a “c”\n\nas was originally correct in England, although the members of the\n\nMissouri branch use the “s”.\n\nAdam. Jr. served in the Revolution, and there is a record also of\n\nhis receiving a warrant for supplies of flour for the Army. He also\n\nserved two sessions in the General Assembly. Nov. 10. 1795 to Dec. 29,\n\n1795 and Nov. 8. 1796 to Dec. 27, 1796.\n\nHenning’s Statutes. Vol. XVI. p. 51 states that on Jan. 16. 1804.\n\nAdam Fisher was authorized to raise by lotteries the sum of $2,000\n\n18\n\nfor improving a wagon road from the South Fork, of the County of\n\nHardy, over North Mountain into Brock’s Gap into Rockingham\n\nCounty.\n\nAdam Fisher died about 1816, and was buried in the Fisher family\n\nburying ground. Jemima Fisher died in 1829. Adam left his entire\n\nestate to her during her lifetime, and as a consequence the final set-\n\ntlement could not be made until after her death. It is recorded in Will\n\nbook 6, p. 64, that final settlement was accomplished in 1835. In the\n\nmeantime Adam’s brother, Solomon Fisher, had contributed trouble\n\nfor Adam’s executors by gaining a favorable decision in 1826 to a\n\nlawsuit, begun in 1809, asking for a new appraisement of their\n\nfather’s estate and for a redistribution of it. The property due Solomon\n\nthrough this turn of affairs was bought from Solomon by Adam’s\n\nson (93) William Fisher, in 1829.\n\nChildren of Adam and Jemima Mace Fisher:\n\n(32)93.

He was born in Tulpehocken Valley in Penn-\n\nsylvania and his christening is recorded in the old Christ Lutheran\n\nChurch near Stouchsburg.\n\nJacob Fisher was married to Susanna Burns, after the close of\n\nthe Revolution. He served in all the sessions of the General Assembly\n\n19\n\nfrom November, 1798, through the session ending February 6, 1806.\n\nHe was a physician of considerable ability.\n\nA copy of Jacob’s application for pension as a Revolutionary\n\nsoldier is given here, since this and the record of his brother, (35)\n\nJohn Fisher’s application for pension constitute the proof that their\n\nfather, Adam Fisher, was the Adam Fisher, born in Tulpehocken\n\nValley. Pa., the son of Sebastian and Susanna Fisher.\n\n“I, this 21st day of May. personally appeared in open court before\n\nthe Justices of the Court of Hardy County now sitting, Jacob Fisher,\n\na resident of said County and State, aged 75 years on the 24th day\n\nof October, next, he being first duly sworn according to law, etc.,\n\non his oath makes the following declaration in order to obtain the\n\nbenefit of the Act of Congress, June 7. 1832.

John Fisher was a soldier in the\n\nRevolution, and his application for pension is on file at the Offices\n\nof Veterans’ Administration at Washington, D. C. This application\n\nwhich states that he was born on Tulpehocken Creek, Berks County,\n\nPennsylvania is of equal value with his elder brother, Jacob’s appli-\n\ncation as proof of their father’s descent from Sebastian Fisher.\n\nJohn Fisher served three months in the Virginia Troops in 1781\n\nunder Captain Michael Stump and Major McPherson ; later he\n\nserved three months under Captain Sylvester Ward in the Virginia\n\nTroops. He was allowed pension on the application executed August\n\n10. 1832. while a resident of Picqua County, Ohio.\n\nAfter the war John Fisher was married to Mary Baylor, daughter\n\nof Jacob Baylor. John was a lawyer, and represented Hardy County,\n\n21\n\nVa.. in General Assembly. Later, he moved to Pendleton County, Va.,\n\nwhere he was a member of the General Assembly in 1810-11. He\n\nthen removed to Picqua (now Pickaway) County, Ohio. After the\n\ndeath of his first wife he married a Miss Levens. John Fisher was\n\nliving in 1840, according,” to the U. S. Census of Pickaway County.\n\nChildren :\n\n107. Elizabeth Fisher, b. ; d. ; m. Reubin Dice; son.\n\nPleasant Dice ;\n\n108 Fisher ; b. ; d. ;m Brett:\n\n109.

Jacob Fisher, d. young.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nGeorge Fisher (Adam, Sebastian) was the fourth son of Adam\n\nand Christina Fisher of Hampshire County, Va., and the eldest of the\n\nthree minor sons named in Adam’s will. He came of age about three\n\nyears after his father’s death, and a court record shows that he re-\n\nceived the portion of his inheritance on March 1, 1786. The tax\n\nlist of 1787 gives his name with three in his family, with four slaves.\n\nIt is traditional that he went to Germany to study medicine, but\n\nnothing to show it to have been a fact has been found.\n\nGeorge Fisher removed to Randolph County, in the Territory of\n\nIllinois about 1798, and became a prominent citizen of Kaskaskia.\n\nMoses” History of Illinois states that he was sheriff of Randolph\n\nCounty in 1801. George IV. Smith’s History of Illinois and her\n\nPeople, says that he was a member of the Indiana legislature, and\n\nwas a member of the first Territorial legislature of Illinois. Another\n\nauthority states that the convention that framed the first Illinois\n\nConstitution was held at the home of George Fisher, and it is, of\n\ncourse, a fact that it met at Kaskaskia, in 1812, and George Fisher\n\nwas chosen Speaker. He was Speaker of the House at the sessions\n\nof 1816-17 and of 1817-18.\n\nDr. George Fisher, according to another reliable History of Ran-\n\ndo’ph County removed from the village in 1808 and bought a farm\n\n“at the ford of the bluff six miles above Kaskaskia on the Prairie du\n\nRoche road.” A short time after he moved to his farm, smallpox broke\n\nout in the vicinity of Kaskaskia. and Dr. Fisher built a hospital on\n\n22\n\nhis farm, and there the greater part of the French population passed\n\nthrough the dangerous malady under his skillful treatment. The\n\nAmerican settlement escaped the epidemic due to the fact that guards\n\nwere placed on the outskirts of all the villages, and that Dr. Fisher\n\nreceived and cared for all that were afflicted with the disease.\n\nDr. George Fisher served in the War of 1812 as surgeon in Stephen-\n\nson’s Brigade. He was an active Mason and helped to organize a\n\nLodge at Kaskaskia. He died in 1820. His estate was large, and litiga-\n\ntion lasted for years. His son Jacoh was Executor of his will.\n\nSo much confusion exists as to whether or not he was the George\n\nFisher who married Elizabeth Conrad, and went first to Pendleton\n\nCounty, Va., that the compiler has decided to omit any attempt to\n\nname his children.\n\nXXXVII.\n\nMichael Fisher (Adam, Sebastian) was born on Sept. 15, 1767,\n\non the Fisher lands which were at first leased by Adam Fisher from\n\nLord Fairfax, and later deeded to him. It would seem, so the story\n\ngoes, that Lord Fairfax did not wish to sell any part of his grant, but\n\ndesired to establish a tenanted Manor such as was common in England.\n\nFinally, the Courts decided against him, and Adam Fisher and other\n\nsettlers were given title to their lands.\n\nMichael Fisher went to Bourbon County, Ky., after he grew up,\n\nand was married there to Sarah Petty, daughter of Joseph and Mary\n\nAnn Petty, who had previously migrated from Hampshire County, Va.\n\nMichael bought land in Kentucky, but about 1798 he removed to\n\nOhio, and purchased a military claim consisting of 800 acres of land\n\nin Franklin County, west of the Scioto River, opposite the present\n\ncity of Columbus, Ohio. This was new country, and it was declared\n\nthat there were one hundred Indians to one white man when Michael\n\nFisher settled there ; but there were only two white men besides\n\nMichael.\n\nAfter a few years, Michael Fisher sold part of his tract, and bought\n\nabout 600 acres across the Scioto, and on higher ground. On the bank\n\nof the river he built a home and a sawmill, about four miles south of\n\nthe present court house, on the Chillicothe Road. This sawmill re-\n\nmained in operation until a canal which was put through necessitated\n\nthe removal of the mill.\n\nMaxamilla Fisher, the fourth child of Michael and Sarah Fisher,\n\nwas the first white child born in Hamilton Township, where Columbus\n\nis situated.\n\nMichael Fisher was an early Justice of the Peace in Hamilton Twp.\n\nHe died January 15, 1824, and Sarah, his wife, died January 2, 1843.\n\nSome of their descendants still reside in Columbus. In 1901, William\n\n23\n\nM. Fisher, a lineal descendant of Michael’s son Jacob and Mary\n\nBriggs Fisher, was a well known wholesale produce merchant in\n\nColumbus, and the father of six children. His wife was the former\n\nKatherine Monheny.\n\nMichael and Sarah Fisher are buried in the old Franklinton ceme-\n\ntery in Columbus.\n\nChildren :\n\n1 16. Christina Fisher, m.

(now\n\nHardy County, W. Va.). In the Autumn of 1792 he was married to\n\nMary Ann Petty, daughter of Joseph and Mary Ann Petty, of the\n\nsame district in Hampshire County. Within two or three years he\n\nwent to Bourbon County, Kentucky, with his wife and one small\n\nson, Adam.\n\nIn 1795 Solomon Fisher appeared on the Bourbon County Tax Lists,\n\nand on August 22, 1796, he was appointed a Lieutenant in the 14th\n\nRegiment. 2nd Battalion. Bourbon County Militia, by Gov. Garrard.\n\nSolomon Fisher, dissatisfied with the way in which his father’s\n\nwill had been interpreted in tbe matter of his own inheritance, sued\n\nin 1806 before “the Honorable John Brown, Judge of the Superior\n\nChancery Court held at Staunton” in Virginia. The case dragged on\n\nuntil 1826. when Solomon finally won the decision. On January 3,\n\n1829, he sold to (93) William Fisher his interest in the estate of (32)\n\nAdam Fisher, Jr. “including lands, slaves, and personal property of all\n\ndescriptions” for $1200.00, this being the property given him by\n\nthe decree. Solomon had already, in 1820 soM for $2700.00, his\n\nshare of the undivided third of his father’s estate held by his mother\n\nuntil her death. Thus, Solomon seems to have severed all connection\n\nwith his family in Virginia.\n\nThe History of St. Charles, Warren and Montgomery Counties,\n\nMissouri, states that Solomon Fisher was a Captain in a Kentuckv\n\nRegiment in the War of 1812. The same is recorded in Bryan and\n\nRose’s “Mississippi Valley Pioneers.”\n\n24\n\nSolomon was a Mason, serving as both Junior and Senior Deacon\n\nin the Lodge in Paris. Bourbon County. Ky.. from which he demitted\n\nat the time of his removal to Missouri, Sept. 13, 1817.\n\nTwo hundred acres of land on Green Creek, Bourbon County, Ky.,\n\npurchased on Sept. 16, 1807. from his father-in-law. Joseph Pettv.\n\nfor $2000.00 was sold to Robert Cunningham, March 11. 1818, for\n\n$6000.00. The description of this land in the deed is included here\n\nbecause it is so typical of the times, and shows why disputes often\n\ncame up in later years regarding boundaries of land thus described.\n\n“Beginning at a buckeye, hickory and elm in a line of James\n\nParberry. corner to Parberry’s settlement; thence south thirty-four\n\ndegrees west two hundred and twelve poles to two sugar trees and\n\nash; thence north fifty-six degrees west one hundred and fifty-two\n\npoles to a stake buckeye and iron wood ; thence north thirty-four\n\ndegrees east two hundred and twelve ]x>les to a stake and two buck-\n\neyes ; thence south fifty-six degrees east one hundred and fifty-two\n\npoles to the beginning.”\n\nWhen it became known that Congress had passed several Acts\n\nproviding for the sale of Public Lands in that part of the northwest\n\nthat later, in 1821. became the State of Missouri, Solomon Fisher\n\nand others, in the spring of 1818, provided themselves with keel\n\nboats, loaded all their movable property and their families on them,\n\nand made their way down the Ohio River into the great Mississippi,\n\nand fought their way against that huge stream up to St. Louis and\n\nbeyond for many miles to the mouth of the Salt River. Turning into\n\nthis small river they proceeded until they came to the mouth of\n\nPeno Creek. L T p this creek some miles they discovered a large cave\n\ncontaining a cool spring, and here Solomon Fisher remained. “He\n\npitched his tent in the heavy timber land.” and lived in tents until\n\nhe had cut logs and built a home — a two-story house where he dwelt\n\nfor many years. His home until his death was on this farm. Only a\n\nfew miles distant the town of Frank ford was laid out in 1819. The\n\npreliminary work of founding this new town was done by Solomon’s\n\nson. Adam Fisher, but after the untimely death of Adam Fisher in\n\n1825. Solomon continued the undertaking. In 1831 he had the town\n\nplotted and filed for record. He donated and deeded the streets,\n\nand a public square to be used for the erection of public buildings.\n\nHe also gave land for a church and a park.\n\nSolomon Fisher always resided on his farm, although his interest\n\nin Frank ford continued until his death. Many of his descendants\n\nreside in and about Frankford. to the eighth generation. Frankford\n\nis most picturesque, and is a thriving agricultural town.\n\nMary Ann Fisher was accidentally shot by one of her sons. Her\n\ndeath occurred about 1826. Solomon Fisher was married a second\n\ntime, to Susan Thompson Stark from whom he was divorced. He\n\nwas married the third time, to Flizabeth Hostetter. known as Aunt\n\nBetsey Hostetter. who survived until after 1850.\n\nSolomon, late in life, received a gunshot wound in the leg which\n\nnecessitated an amputation.\n\nHis death occurred on May 28, 1841, after a protracted illness.\n\nHe was buried on the farm, but many years later his remains were\n\nremoved to the cemetery in Frank ford Park — the Park that he gave\n\nto the Public. A large boulder from the Fisher farm has been placed,\n\nappropriately inscribed, as a monument to Solomon Fisher by the\n\nDaughters of the American Revolution.\n\nChildren :\n\n(37)123.

All\n\nthese Fishers were as one family, in fact their descendants have al-\n\nways believed Joseph and Solomon to have been brothers.\n\nIn 1848 Joseph Fisher moved to Pike County. Mo., where he was\n\nnear others of the Solomon Fisher branch. In 1850 he was in Cuivre\n\nTownship. Pike County, Mo., where he and his wife were listed in\n\nthe U. S.

They went overland\n\nwith five yoke of oxen, and were four months on the journey.

He was the only one\n\nof his immediate family too young to remember the long journey by\n\nway of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. He must have remembered\n\nthe excitement and sometimes tragedy of the early years of this\n\nfamily in Missouri. For instance, he was still a young boy when his\n\nmother was accidentally shot by one of his brothers. Hunting was a\n\npart of everyday life then, and such accidents occurred in many\n\nhomes, sometimes more than once. Solomon’s father received a gun-\n\nshot wound in the leg in his later years. It does not follow that they\n\nwere either inexpert or careless. They were skilled in the use of fire-\n\narms from childhood, many times their very life depending on their\n\nskill.\n\nSolomon Fisher’s wife was Caroline Matilda Payne. The date of\n\nhis marriage is not at hand. Their large family has for the most part\n\nremained in Frankford, and there are many substantial citizens among\n\nthe descendants of Solomon and Matilda Fisher living in and around\n\nFrankford. The compiler can testify to their friendly hospitality,\n\nenjoyed during a visit to Frankford in 1928, and is indebted to\n\nthis branch particularly for most of the genealogical data given here.\n\nMrs. Robert L.

Family\n\n46\n\ntradition claims that she then went to Virginia, presumably to the\n\nhome of her father, William Power (s) in Lewis County, now in\n\nWest Virginia. Later the widow was married to Thomas Buchanan,\n\na widower, and they reared a family of four children by this second\n\nmarriage.\n\nAt the age of twenty-two William P. Fisher was married in Lin-\n\ncoln Co., Mo. to his cousin, Sarah Settle(s). They resided in Pleasant\n\nHill township. Pike County. Illinois, until 1845 when they returned to\n\nLincoln Co.. Mo. In 1847 they removed to Prairie Township, Mont-\n\ngomery Co., Mo. where Mr. Fisher bought land, surveyed and laid\n\nout a beautiful farm of two hundred sixty-six acres. Much of the\n\nland surrounding his property was also surveyed by Mr. Fisher.\n\nA substantial log house was built first, but some years later a large\n\nframe house was erected. The original log structure was still in good\n\ncondition and occupied by renters in the year 1890. In early days\n\nWilliam and Sarah Fisher, while roaming through the woods in\n\nsummer came upon a wild rose bush bearing large blooms with a\n\ndouble row of petals.

Early the next spring they transplanted the\n\nbush to their door-yard where it grew and bloomed for many years.\n\nWilliam P. Fisher enlisted in the Union Cause at Louisiana.

Colonel of the Seventy-third Regiment, Missouri Militia.\n\nHowever, the regiment was never mustered in.\n\nIn 1866, Mr. Fisher was elected County Assessor in which service\n\nhe served four vears. He possessed considerab’e skill as a physician,\n\nbut never practiced outside his family. It is a fact, however, that his\n\nskill saved the life of one member of his family, and relieved suf-\n\nferers many times.\n\nHe died at his home in the early spring of 1888. His wife died in\n\n1870, after a long illness. Mr. Fisher did not marry again, but\n\nreared his younger children with great affection and strict discipline.\n\nChildren :\n\n(60)306.

On August 5. 1897 he was\n\nmarried to Ella Byrd Corbett. who was born July 16, 1871. He\n\nbraved the strong disapproval of his father and others of his family\n\nwhen he studied law. but he has had a most eminent career in his\n\nchosen profession.\n\nFrom 1899 to 190$ the Honorable Jake Fisher was a member of\n\nthe West Virginia House nf Delegates, and in 1904 he was a mem-\n\nber of the Senate. He took his present position, that of Judge of the\n\nFourteenth Circuit, on January 1. 1913. He very modestly states that\n\ndue to good health he has been permitted to make something of a\n\nrecord on the bench, — he has been neither absent nor late at a session\n\nof Court which it was his duty to attend, although he has presided\n\nover four Counties and there is but the one court in these counties.\n\nHe states that he has had the remarkable experience of having less\n\nthan two hundred persons in his circuit who were other than native\n\nborn white. Judge Fisher’s term of office is due to expire in 1944. and\n\nhe says that he will regret to take leave of his people for they have\n\nbeen so very good to him. He has been a member of the State\n\nJudicial Council since its institution in 1934. In 1924. Judge Fisher\n\nwas the Democratic nominee for Governor of West Virginia.\n\nThe few words with which Judge Fisher has complied with the\n\ncompiler’s request for something about his work have expressed his\n\ntrue greatness; they have given us a glimpse of his deep feeling of\n\nresponsibility, and of affection for those who have come under his\n\ncare. While a more detailed account of his work would be desirable,\n\nit would of necessity have been furnished by someone other than\n\nhimself.\n\nChildren :\n\n378. Frank Corbett F"
