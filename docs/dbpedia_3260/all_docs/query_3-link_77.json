        "text": "BROWN COUNTY BLUEGRASS FESTIVAL\n\nThe legendary Brown County Bluegrass Festival, takes place annually at the Brown County Fairgrounds in Georgetown, Ohio. The dynamic Brown County Bluegrass team has pulled together the very best talent, venue, and special events required for an enjoyable bluegrass festival experience. The lineup is always first class with three full days of some of the hottest names on today’s bluegrass music circuit taking the stage.\n\nAmple electrical and water hookups for camping, newly renovated bath houses, and food/merchandise vendors are offered to make everyone comfortable while they enjoy great music all weekend long.\n\nCampers are permitted to move in on the Monday before the festival begins. Early camper arrivals are invited to join the gang for three nights of “Dinner on the Grounds”\n\nMonday–Chili Cook Off; bring a big pot of your best chili recipe and see how it stands up to the “taste test” of those in attendance. We also invite you to bring a “dish to pass” to help fill out the table.\n\nTuesday–Southern Bean Supper; we supply the beans, cooked southern style, and you bring along a “dish to pass” or cornbread or that favorite dessert you love to share. Or perhaps you have THE best southern-style bean recipe on the face of the earth and you’d like to share a pot of your beans…please do so!\n\nWednesday– Edgar’s Famous Fish Fry…Edgar Loudermilk has caught the fish, cleaned the fish, and will fry the fish! Again, if attendees would please bring along a “dish to pass,” the gang would be much obliged. This is a BIG night at the festival!\n\nFestival Seating–There is plenty of room for lawn chairs on the infield of the equestrian area of the grounds (just in front of the covered stage) and a large covered grandstand directly behind the infield for shade seekers. Year in and year out there are many return visitors, in addition to many new faces as our “family friendly” festival continues to grow. Please see our Festival Guidelines for lawn chair requirements.\n\nOh, and did we mention campground jamming?! Music, non-stop all week long! Tune up your fiddle, bring along your banjo, get out the guitar, bust out the bass, and make tracks with that mandolin to the Brown County Bluegrass Festival. Pick a tune, sing a song, catch up with old friends, and make a few new ones along the way!\n\nCome be a part of the Brown County Bluegrass Festival family!"
