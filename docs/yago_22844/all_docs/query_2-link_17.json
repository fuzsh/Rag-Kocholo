        "text": "Clifford Parker Robertson III became a fairly successful leading man through most of his career without ever becoming a major star. Following strong stage and television experience, he made an interesting film debut in a supporting role in Picknick (1955). He then played Joan Crawford's deranged young husband in Herbststürme (1956) and was given leads in films of fair quality such as Die Nackten und die Toten (1958), April entdeckt die Männer (1959) and Die große Attraktion (1961).\n\nHe was born to Clifford Parker Robertson Jr. and Audrey Olga (nee Willingham) Robertson. Robertson Jr. was described as \"the idle heir to a tidy sum of ranching money\". They have divorced when he was a year old, and his mother died of peritonitis a year later in El Paso, Texas. Young Cliff was raised by his maternal grandmother, Mary Eleanor Willingham as well as an aunt and uncle.\n\nHe supplemented his somewhat unsatisfactory big-screen work with interesting appearances on television, including the lead role in Days of Wine and Roses (1958). Robertson was effective playing a chilling petty criminal obsessed with avenging his father in the B-feature Alles auf eine Karte (1961) or a pleasant doctor in the popular hospital melodrama Männer, die das Leben lieben (1962). However, significant public notice eluded him until he was picked by President John F. Kennedy to play the young JFK during the latter's World War II experience in Patrouillenboot PT 109 (1963).\n\nMoving into slightly better pictures, Robertson gave some of his best performances: a ruthless presidential candidate in Der Kandidat (1964), a modern-day Mosca in an updated version of Ben Jonson's \"Volpone\", Venedig sehen - und erben... (1967), and most memorably as a mentally retarded man in Charly (1968), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Actor. His critical success with Charly (1968) allowed him to continue starring in some good films in the 1970s, including Himmelfahrtskommando Okinawa (1970), Der große Minnesota Überfall (1972), and Schwarzer Engel (1976).\n\nHe starred in, directed and co-produced the fine rodeo drama Der Cowboy (1971) and, less interestingly, Der Pilot (1980). He remained active mostly in supporting roles, notably playing Hugh Hefner in Star 80 - Tod eines Playmates (1983). More recently, he had supporting parts in Flucht aus L.A. (1996) and Spider-Man (2002).\n\nRobertson died on September 10, 2011, just one day after his 88th birthday in Stony Brook, New York."
