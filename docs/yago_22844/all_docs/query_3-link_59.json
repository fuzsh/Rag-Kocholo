        "text": "R24 . . .\n\n“EAST HAMPTON, L.I., Sept. 9—Rescuers in boats and helicopters searched all day today for David Post Rumbough, 23‐year‐old son of Dina Merrill, the actress, and her first husband, Stanley M. Rumbough Jr., the New York industrialist.\n\nCoast Guard patrol boats, police land and sea units and Army Reserve helicopters joined the hunt for Mr. Rumbough, who was reported missing yesterday after a racing craft in which he was riding apparently went out of control and capsized in choppy water in Gardiner's Bay at the eastern end of Long Island. The search, halted this evening, was to resume tomorrow morning.\n\nMr. Rumbough's companion in the 27‐foot boat, 25‐year‐old Jonathan Keith, was rescued and taken to Southampton Hospital, where he was reported in satisfactory condition this morning.“\n\nI like watching her in old episodes of To Tell the Truth. This one has Betty White and Johnny Carson in it too.\n\nHer mother, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had three girls and Dina was the youngest one with a big gap between the others. From what I read her mother really doted on her. Her bedroom at Mar-a-Lago looked like something out of a fairytale. (Later it was made into Ivanka’s room.) I would love to read a biography on Dina.\n\nI’ll try to find the quote from Dina about what she said about Donald regarding the sale of Mar-a-lago. I know he wanted her to include the dining room table in the sale, but Dina refused and ended up sending it to her mother’s museum in Washington D.C., Hillwood.\n\nIn the Mar-a-Lago chapter, Trump has harsh words for Dina Merrill, Marjorie Merriweather Post's daughter, who sold him the historic Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\nHe calls Merrill an \"arrogant and aloof daughter [of Post], who was born with her mother's beauty but not her brains.\n\n\"During my fight to save Mar-a-Lago, Merrill would constantly criticize me and say things behind my back, all of which would get back to me. She should have been the one to save Mar-a-Lago. Mommy had given her the money, and it would have been an easy and popular thing to have done.\n\n\"Instead, she lives in a terribly furnished Palm Beach condominium, thinking about her failed acting career and how she can make me look as 'nouveau' as possible.\"\n\nMerrill said Friday from New York that she has not read the book. But she began to giggle when a reporter began to read passages from it.\n\n\"How lovely,\" she said after parts about her were read. \"He's a charming man, isn't he?\"\n\nMerrill said Trump probably was not pleased with a letter she wrote to him stating that turning Mar-a-Lago into a club was not good for Palm Beach.\n\n\"It is in a neighborhood of single-family residences, with large houses up and down South Ocean Boulevard,\" Merrill said, adding that when the owners of nearby estates die, their children may want to turn their homes into clubs as well.\n\n\"That [Mar-a-Lago] is a single-family residence,\" Merrill said. \"If he wants to live there, wonderful. But don't turn it into something it isn't. It doesn't need to be a bed and breakfast.\"\n\nMerrill said Trump invited her and her husband to Mar-a-Lago one night for a drink. She said he has done an excellent job of keeping up her late mother's home.\n\nWhen asked whether she was surprised at Trump's biting comments, she replied, \"I wouldn't be surprised at anything the man does, quite frankly. But I don't want to stoop to his level. I would rather not comment more.\""
