Hadrian’s Arch (Αψίδα του Αδριανού) is a monumental gateway in Athens, Greece. It once spanned an ancient road from the center to the eastern side of the city.

History of Hadrian’s Arch

Hadrian’s Arch, also known as Hadrian’s Gate (Πύλη του Αδριανού), was built in 131 to honor Roman emperor Hadrian for his many contributions to the city. It’s unknown who commissioned the arch, but it’s likely it was a gift from the citizens of Athens.

In 1778, the arch was incorporated into the Wall of Haseki, built by Ottoman governor Hacı Ali Haseki (d. 1795). It was converted to a gate and was known as Vasilopoula’s Gate or Kamaroporta.

Architecture

Hadrian’s Arch is 18 meters high, 13.5 meters wide, and 2.3 meters deep. The upper level resembles a Greek propylon while the lower level takes the shape of a traditional Roman arch. The passageway on the lower level is 6.5 meters wide. The design is fully symmetrical from front to back and side to side. It’s made of Pentelic marble, which was also used for the Parthenon, and it’s possible that statues once stood in the niches on the upper level.

Inscription

There are two inscriptions on the arch. On the side facing the Acropolis and Plaka, it reads “This is Athens, the former city of Theseus”. The other side, facing the Temple of Olympian Zeus, reads “This is the city of Hadrian and not of Theseus”. It was originally believed that the arch separated the “old” city and the “new” city of Athens, but it’s not clear whether the inscriptions refer to the city as a whole or intend to divide it in two parts.

Visiting the Arch

The arch is free and open to the public 24 hours a day. There are beautiful views of the Acropolis and the Temple of Olympian Zeus from the arch.
