        "text": "When you think of Athens, what is the first thing that comes to your mind? It is very likely that the city is most famous for all its ancient sights. When you think of it, how many places can compete with such a rich history that the Greek capital has? The Arch of Hadrian is one of many remains of this city’s ancient past and one dating back to the Roman era. It is a quick stop between sights, but one that is well worth visiting. Standing next to the road, it is a fairly impressive attraction, too.\n\nWhat You Should Know About the Arch of Hadrian\n\nThe arch dates back to the second century. Back then, it was probably constructed for the Roman emperor Hadrian. The exact reason seems to have been forgotten in the passing of time. However, it is believed that the arch was built to celebrate and honour the emperor. The arch spanned an ancient road connecting the center of Athens with the area that includes structures such as the temple of Olympian Zeus. In many ways, it resembles a Roman triumphal arch,\n\nVisit the Arch of Hadrian\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian is one of the ancient sights in Athens that has no admission fee. The arch is located at Vasilissis Amalias Avenue, not far from Syntagma Square. The Acropolis is some 300 meters away, so within walking distance also. The arch is located just next to the Temple of Olympian Zeus and from here it is possible to get a great view also over the remains of the temple. In other words, it’s the perfect option if you don’t want to pay the 6-euro admission fee to the temple."
