As the name suggests, this arch is dedicated to the Roman king Hadrian. The arch is made of brick and has an outer covering of limestone. Initially, the arch was designed to have three pylons while only one survives today. This arch boasts of the typical Roman architecture and is a popular tourist attraction.",
