        "text": "In Athens, reminders of ancient civilizations are never far from view. The famous Acropolis, the hill where the ancient Greeks built their Parthenon, stands taller than any building in town. And collections of ruins sit in underground metro stations, behind fences in the middle of neighborhoods and even beneath the Acropolis Museum, which was built over the remains of a post-Roman settlement.\n\nPanathenaic Stadium\n\nThe enormous, gleaming white marble Panathenaic Stadium offers a free audio tour in multiple languages.\n\nThe Acropolis\n\nThe Acropolis, the hill atop which sits the ancient citadel, with famous buildings like the Parthenon and the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the Temple of Athena Nike. Make time to stop by the associated museum, which houses important artifacts and art.\n\nThe Greek Agora\n\nThe Greek Agora has the well-preserved Temple of Hephaestus and other ruins like the Stoa (marketplace).\n\nThe Odeum of Herodes Atticus\n\nThe Odeum of Herodes Atticus is a restored Roman theater sitting just beneath the Acropolis. An array of plays and concerts are still held here, with world-renowned performers filling the calendar. Bonus points if you can find one that fits with your visit.\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian was built to welcome the ancient Roman emperor Hadrian."
