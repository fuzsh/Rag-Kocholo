He passed under this glorious gate when he came for the inauguration of the temple of Olympian Zeus. This gate was the separation landmark of the old city of Athens and the new district created by Hadrian. The eastern frieze over the arch is still existing with a sign saying \"this is the city of Hadrian and not the city of Thesseus\". The sign of the western side of the gate says \"here is Athens, the former city of Thesseus."
