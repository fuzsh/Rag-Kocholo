        "text": "Hadrian’s Arch is a nearly 60-foot arch gateway made of Pentelic marble. Historians speculated that the Greeks constructed this arch for the arrival of the Roman Emperor Hadrian in 131 or 132 AD to honor the emperor’s many contributions to the city of Athens. The arch holds two inscriptions, one honoring Theseus and one honoring Hadrian as the founders of Athens. The inscriptions are on opposite sides of the archway, possibly signifying the founders of “old” and “new” Athens, both in terms of the city’s geographic region and its social and cultural progress under Roman rule. While the structure does echo the shape of Roman triumphal arches, the construction and message of Hadrian’s arch differs dramatically in its design and scale, making it a unique, Greek-style monument to a Roman emperor.\n\nThe arch is symmetrical, with Corinthian columns adorning both sides of the lower arch. The arch is also adorned with sculptural decorations as well as the inscriptions mentioned above. The upper arch contains a series of 6 Corinthian columns with a pediment in the center of the arch. Historians suggested that statues adorned the top half of the archway, with Theseus and Hadrian as the most likely candidates.\n\nBoth writing and drawing the arch brought out significantly different elements of the structure. When drawing the arch, I placed extra focus on the shape of the arch and the Corinthian columns, particularly in the top half of the arch. When writing about the arch, I placed more focus on the inscriptions, which I found difficult to see in person and did not even include in my drawing. I knew the inscriptions were there but got lost in the grandeur and scale of the monument. This comparison certainly illuminates the visual effects of monuments and the need to pair the monument with written context to fully understand a monument’s historical and political functions. A small sign was available on the arch of the site but did not seem to make the same impact as the monument itself. I definitely believe that attractive, engaging signage should be available at all historical sites to capture audience interest and provide an objective historical narrative to pair with this enormous structure."
