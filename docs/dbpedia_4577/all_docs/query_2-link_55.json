A monumental gateway, it resembles a Roman triumphal arch. It is just off Ataturk Boulevard and has three double arches, which were erected to celebrate the visit of Emperor Hadrian. Located 325 m southeast of the Acropolis, this arch has inscriptions which state Hadrian and Theseus as its two founders. The entire gate is made of Pentelic marble, which was also used in the construction of Parthenon and many other structures in Athens.

A monumental gateway, it resembles a Roman triumphal arch. It is just off Ataturk Boulevard and has three double arches, which were erected to celebrate the visit of Emperor Hadrian. Located 325 m southeast of the Acropolis, this arch has inscriptions which state Hadrian and Theseus as its two founders. The entire gate is made of Pentelic marble, which was also used in the construction of Parthenon and many other structures in Athens. However, it is of a lower quality than what is used in the best constructed Athenian buildings. The building is symmetrical from side to side and from front to back.\n\nThe Hadrian gate also has a glass pathway which separates the old Kaleici (historic city center of Antalya) from the city. There are park benches outside the gate offering for a quiet retreat, while allowing you the time to observe locals and surroundings. The gate is situated amidst shops so once you get free from your walk in the bazaar, you can visit the place to go back to old times and see the old architecture. It is one of the few spots with well-preserved history and as one tourist aptly puts it across, the gate is a good reminder of times gone by and the people who have passed through it. The gate is standing with its grandeur of coffered ceilings in arches and decorative marble columns. The deep grooves in the stone pavement bears testament to the thousands of carts that have passed through this gate over centuries.\n\nend of article\n\nNext story\n\nKekova Island\n\nAlso Read"
