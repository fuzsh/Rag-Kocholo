        "text": "Our guide was amazing, made a conscious effort to keep us cool. Stopping in the shade to talk and kept us engaged with relevant history/facts often relating it to where we were from.\n\nRyan | Jun 24 | Acropolis & Museum Tour\n\nNiobe was fantastic, so knowledgeable and took wonderful care of us. It was warm but we always stopped in the shade. So much information on the history of Greece & the Acropolis. We had a wonderful walk. Recommend booking early morning if possible.\n\nJohn | Jun 24 | Acropolis Tour\n\nVery well organized tour. Extremely knowledgeable and friendly Guide. Seeing the temperatures and the crowds really the best way and time to visit the Acropolis.\n\nMarco | Jun 24 | First Access Acropolis Tour\n\nMargarita was the absolute best — amazing English, full of information, fun to hang out with, etc. Book this tour asap!\n\nJason | Jun 24 | Athens City, Acropolis & Museum Tour\n\nAngel was a wonderful and entertaining guide! He provided great descriptions and cultural contexts for each delicious dish we enjoyed. Angel also provided excellent and informative histories of the various sites and places we passed on our tour. My wife and I raved about our experience with our family. I highly recommend this tour, and Angel as a guide.\n\nJack | Jun 24 | Athens Old Town Food Tour\n\nEasy skip the line - early entry allowed for good photos without the crowd. Tour was quick (1.5 hours) and left most of the rest of the day to explore on our own.\n\nBarry | Jun 24 | First Access Acropolis Tour\n\nRina was amazing for our first ever walking tour. Incredibly knowledgeable and very easy to listen to. We learnt and enjoyed it so much. Great experience - our 11 and 9 year old got so much out of it. Thanks Rina!\n\nNicola | Jun 24 | Athens City & Acropolis Museum\n\nThe Acropolis and museum tour was great. Alice provided good historical context and explanations without overwhelming with too many facts. We were so glad we did the tour vs. going on our own and learned a few things along the way. Definitely recommend.\n\nMaya | Jun 24 | Acropolis & Museum Tour\n\nWe had such a great Acropolis tour, Niiloletta was such a personable and informative tour guide, we learned so much and the tour went a good pace where we were truly able to experience the history of Acropolis!\n\nY Tresnan | Jun 24 | Acropolis Tour\n\nI loved everything about our tour but mostly I loved Margarita! She was wonderful! So knowledgeable, just lovely, took such good care of us! You should give her a raise! She certainly deserves one! Thank you Margarita for a perfect first day in Athens!\n\nKim | Jun 24 | Athens City, Acropolis & Museum Tour\n\nGreat tour! It’s a really special experience to be one of the first groups to climb the Acropolis, and Niobe was a friendly and knowledgeable tour guide! Would recommend this tour to anyone visiting Athens.\n\nRachel | Jun 24 | First Access Acropolis\n\nThis was the highlight of our Athens stay! Eva was excellent - she was super knowledgeable, warm, friendly and funny! We learned a ton about Greek culture and tasted some awesome authentic Greek food. Would highly recommend especially with Eva - we loved her!\n\nKelly Cullen | May 24 | Athens Street Culture & Food\n\nThe private tour of the acropolis + museum was so much fun! My parents aren’t as agile as they used to be, and our guide Nikoletta was EXTREMELY accommodating and made sure they could both reach the top. She was also very knowledgeable and friendly. I would highly highly recommend this tour.\n\nLeah Procopi | May 24 | Private Acropolis & Museum Tour\n\nOrestis led our group of four on a fabulous tasting tour of authentic Greek food. He was very knowledgeable, pleasant, and lighthearted. Great experience, delicious food, so glad we did this tour!\n\nSusan | May 24 | Athens Food Tour"
