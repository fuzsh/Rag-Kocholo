        "text": "A thread where to post/discuss Greek and Roman architecture of any kind.\n\nThis is one the capitals of the cella of the temple of Mars Ultor, in the Forum of Augustus. During the Augustan age there was a general architectural experimentalism: many aspects of the Augustan architecture would not be reprised in later decades, even for centuries. Such are the figured capitals like this, which would not be reprised by later architecture for almost two centuries. Why Pegasus though? It has been suggested that they're referencing the equi Martis, through which Mars carried Romulus-Quirinus to the heavens. The Mars Ultor temple is a prime example of the exceptional naturalism of the Augustan architecture, which is especially evident in the leafs of the capitals of the porticus of the Forum. The shaft is made with marmor Numidicum. The Forum of Augustus truly embodies the peak refinement of Roman architecture to that point.\n\nI have to say all this talk of capitals goes slightly over my head [pun not intended, but I'm still very pleased with it ]. I've never been able to really understand all this jargon with acanthus leaves this and entablature that. I'm too much of a theorist by trade, and that all smells like Rutherford's \"stamp collecting\". I guess I should settle down with a proper book on the terminology (and plenty of pictures) and learn what it all means someday...\n\nWhat I do \"get\" however, is the geometric symmetries and proportions that underlie the design of much Roman architecture. Based on Janet DeLaine's book, it starts off with pure geometric shapes like squares and circles, and then builds upon it with small integer ratios - things like 1:2 or 2:3 that also give rise to harmonics in music. The numbers 6 and 10 were also thought very fundamental, giving ratios like the height to diameter of columns. That's not to say that these things determined floor plans of individual rooms, but they were the heart of the layout. Here's some of the examples from said book:\n\nThe two equal circles (one parallel to the floor, the other vertical) that define the Pantheon. Note also that the inscribed square of that circle is doubled to define the portico in front.\n\nThe baths of Caracalla, with the same double square defining the main baths, with the symmetric wings aligned to those edges\n\nThe baths of Thaenae, Tunisia. Blue squares added by me, the outer square has exactly triple the side length of the inner one (inscribed by the frigidarium).\n\nEDIT: Added the red circle that goes along the curved sections of the tepidarium and the pools - it has exactly 6/5 (a minor third in music) of the radius of the frigidarium itself. Spotting these patterns and ratios is actually quite a fun game!\n\nA thread where to post/discuss Greek and Roman architecture of any kind.\n\nExcellent idea for a thread. I remember having a discussion with you some time ago, I think we were musing over the possibility to discuss architecture in connection to social and historical developments, maybe social values and aesthetics. How societies and history got reflected on architectural developments. I find the idea very appealing and something not often discussed.\n\nVery glad to see you back and talk to you again Tibs! I'll see if I can dig some of my photos later on.\n\nA thread where to post/discuss Greek and Roman architecture of any kind.\n\nThis is one the capitals of the cella of the temple of Mars Ultor, in the Forum of Augustus. During the Augustan age there was a general architectural experimentalism: many aspects of the Augustan architecture would not be reprised in later decades, even for centuries.

The shaft is made with marmor Numidicum. The Forum of Augustus truly embodies the peak refinement of Roman architecture to that point.\n\nEh ... even with my German roots, I was born in Italy: Roman architecture is everywhere, even among the Alps.\n\nDon't think that Romans didn't build something remarkable here, in the far North. Pay a visit to Northern Piedmont ...\n\nAnyway, just the word \"architecture\" should make us think to a pivotal aspect of Roman architecture: the arch.\n\nThe arch is fantastic: it enjoys gravity to become substantially indestructible. It's the lateral pressure on the sides of the central brick to ensure that the arch will stand for a very long time ...\n\nIt's the form.\n\nAnd this is the same about domes. Romans were able to realized domes made by stone [!!! What?].\n\nThink to the Pantheon ...\n\nThe dome of the pantheon is concrete, not stone. I guess technically concrete contains sand which is small stone, but it's a very different construction material.\n\nYes, you've been saying that in every other post for a while, I think everyone knows by now...\n\nRepetita iuvant.\n\nWhat I don't add is something else which is not so relevant.\n\nAbout the pantheon you're technically right. That wasn't properly stone.\n\nBut I was underlining that Romans were able to make domes using very heavy materials, because the shape of a dome is like a arch, so that the physical forces work in the same way."
