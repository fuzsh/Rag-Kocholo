To this day, the grand Propylaea remains the primary entrance and exit, up and down steep marble steps.\n\nOther temples, sanctuaries, altars, and statues grace the plateau. Two notable landmarks are the small but striking Temple of Athena Nike and the unique Erechtheion.\n\nLocated to the right of the Propylaea, the Temple of Athena Nike celebrates Victory. The architect Kallikrates designed the Ionic temple.\n\nThe workshop of sculptor Agorakritos created statues and friezes, including Nike the Sandalbinder. Wings closed, the Nike lifts her foot to slip off her sandal before entering the temple.\n\nThe Acropolis Museum displays the Sandalbinder in its priceless collection of Acropolis art and artifacts.\n\nLittle Legend of the Acropolis of Athens\n\nOf all the historic landmarks on the Acropolis of Athens, one special landmark is the personal favorite of this writer and this photographer: the Erechtheion.\n\nThe Erechtheion is the Temple of Athena Polias, Protector of the City, with Ionic columns and intricate detailing.\n\nWhat chiefly sets the Erechtheion apart are two uncommon aspects:\n\nIn the first place, the Erechtheion’s asymmetrical design is unlike other classical architecture; for example, the Parthenon’s perfect symmetrical balance.\n\nIn the second place, its Southern Porch incorporates female figures instead of columns to support the roof.\n\nSix harmonious marble maidens hold aloft the Southern Porch of the Caryatids.\n\nToday, because of Athens’ pollution, these six sisters are exact reproductions of the original statues.\n\nFive original Caryatids are in the Acropolis Museum; the sixth original is in the British Museum of London, England.\n\nPS: The Caryatides’ birthplace is a true hidden gem, a little-known Greek landmark off the beaten path.\n\nTips to Visit the Acropolis of Athens\n\nExpert insight enhances everything there is to see and understand about the Acropolis of Athens, the first and foremost of Greece’s most important archaeological sites.\n\nSo the best way to elevate your experience on the Acropolis of Athens is with a professional local tour guide.\n\nDiscover the best tour options.\n\nThe best time to visit typically is either early morning or late afternoon.\n\nThe Acropolis of Athens is open daily year-round, from sunrise to sunset, with the raising and lowering of the Greek flag.\n\nWeather permitting, of course. During the extreme heat wave of Summer 2023, for instance, the Acropolis closed in the hottest hours.\n\nWhenever you visit, the best things to bring are bottled water, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Because the ancient citadel has no services and little shade.\n\nWear comfortable and ideally sturdy shoes to climb up and down the Acropolis’ steps and on its uneven plateau.\n\nAdditionally, an elevator on the northern side provides access for mobility-impaired visitors and parents with two or more infants.\n\nThe Greek government’s official agency Hellenic Heritage has information on Acropolis elevator access.\n\nNotes on Entry to the Acropolis 2024\n\nFrom early spring through late fall, the line to enter the Acropolis is always long, very long. For everyone, yes, even those with skip-the-line tickets.\n\nIn order to provide greater protection to this iconic monument and a better experience for tourists, the government announced tentative entry limits, which started in September 2023.\n\nFrom April 1, 2024, the entry limits should be permanent, allowing a maximum of 20,000 visitors daily in timed entries per hour.\n\nAncient Agora of Athens\n\nDating from the 6th century BC, the Ancient Agora of Athens was an essential hub of classical urban life.\n\nFrom libraries to law courts, artists to assemblies, socializing to shopping, the Ancient Agora of Athens encompasses a broad spectrum of stoas, temples, monuments, and even a mint for coinage.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the Apostle Paul preached daily in the Agora, the synagogue, and the Aeropagus. Atop the rocky outcrop of the Aeropagus, a bronze plaque memorializes his powerful sermon in Acts 17:16-34.\n\nIn the summer months, the Ancient Agora of Athens is a great place to escape from the hot sun. A short walk along paths lined with trees, shrubs, and lawns is a refreshing respite.\n\nFifth century BC Temple of Hephaestus stands among the Ancient Agora’s most impressive landmarks.\n\nWell preserved and almost wholly intact, the Hephaisteion helps to imagine the Parthenon in its original state.\n\nSyntagma Square and Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nAthens’ heart and city center is Syntagma Square, a vast plateia in front of the Old Royal Palace, housing the Greek Parliament since 1934.\n\nAmalia Avenue, Otto Street, and King George I Street flank the square and lead to popular tourist attractions in nearby neighborhoods such as Plaka, Monastiraki, and Psiri.\n\nStadiou Street, Athens’s top shopping street, links Syntagma and Omonia Squares.\n\nConstitution Square is a busy transportation hub with Metro and Tram stations, bus stops, taxis, non-stop traffic, and pedestrians galore.\n\nBroad marble steps lead to the Old Royal Palace, a neoclassical historical landmark completed in 1843 and currently in use as the Parliament Building; and to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, dedicated in 1932.\n\nOn the hour, the elite Evzones perform a slow and serious choreographed ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Eternal Flame.\n\nThe Presidential Guard selects its members from Hellenic Army standouts. Evzones are famed for their height, discipline, and ceremonial uniform.\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus\n\nNot to be confused with Olympian Land in Western Greece, the Temple of Olympian Zeus dominates a vast archaeological site in Athens.\n\nThis largest temple in the ancient world took centuries to complete. Construction began more than 500 years before Christ. Under Roman Emperor Hadrian, construction eventually finished in the 2nd century AD.\n\nOn one side, the gate to the Temple of Olympian Zeus proclaimed, “This is the Athens of Theseus, the old city.”\n\nThe opposite side of the gate asserted, “This is the city of Hadrian, not of Theseus.\n\nPanathenaic Stadium\n\nThe Modern Olympics originated in Greece, not only in Ancient Olympia but also here in Athens at the Panathenaic Stadium.\n\nThe site of a racecourse since the 6th century BC, the Panathenaic Stadium originally hosted the Panathenaic Games every four years from the 4th century BC until the 3rd century AD.\n\nAbandoned for centuries, the ruined stadium was restored and refurbished in the 19th century.\n\nIn 1896, the world’s only all-marble stadium hosted the first international Modern Olympic Games, the Games of the 1st Olympiad; as well as the 2004 Summer Olympics, the Games of the 28th Olympiad.\n\nAdditionally, before every Olympics, the Panathenaic Stadium hosts the formal ceremony wherein Greece hands over the Olympic flame, lit in Ancient Olympia, to the host city.\n\nLastly, the Panathenaic Stadium is the finish line for the Athens Marathon.\n\nThis classic route retraces the legendary run of Phiedippides in 490 BC, bearing the message of victory from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, 26.2 miles (42 km) away.\n\nTips to Visit the Panathenaic Stadium\n\nThe Panathenaic Stadium opens to visitors year-round.\n\nThe best time to visit in the summer months is early morning and late afternoon.\n\nBecause the stadium is entirely open to the elements, make sure to bring water, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen in the summer months. In cooler months, wear layered warm clothing.\n\nAnd oh yes, do bring sneakers! Because the entrance fee includes access to run the track.\n\nAfter that triumphant lap around the track, commemorate the moment with your photo atop the medal podium. In the first-place gold medal position, of course.\n\nFor another fabulous photo, climb to the upper tier of Stand 21.\n\nThis perspective shows the Acropolis, Filopappou Hill, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, Zappeion Megaron in the National Gardens, and Mount Lycabettus.\n\nMount Lycabettus\n\nThe highest point in Athens is Mount Lycabettus, rising 908 feet (277 m) in the city center.\n\nFrom the top, sweeping views encompass the entire capital city. From ancient history to modern metropolis, the Athenian sights dazzle and delight.\n\nBesides the panorama, there is a cafe-restaurant and two churches: 19th century Agios Georgios on the plateau; and Agios Isidoros, circa 15th to 16th century, on the western slope.\n\nThe 1960s Lycabettus ampitheatre awaits restoration and is thus closed at this time of publication.\n\nTo ascend or descend Mount Lycabettus, either drive or take a taxi up the Lycabettus ring road. Or climb a long, steep hike up zig-zagging stairs.\n\nThe fun thing to do is ride the Lycabettus Funicular, a three-minute tunnel ride up and down the hill between Konolonaki Station and Agios Georgios.\n\nTemple of Poseidon\n\nThe magnificent Temple of Poseidon commands the Cape of Sounio on mainland Attica’s southern coast. Protected since 1974, Sounio is the smallest of Greek National Parks.\n\nThe Saronic Gulf Islands set the stage for this spectacular site of two Greek gods.\n\nDedicated to the mythological sea god, the ancient Temple of Poseidon dates from the 5th century BC. Of the original 34 Doric columns, 13 still stand in stark splendor.\n\nNearby on a lower level, the Temple of Athena Souniados leaves behind only a few ancient stones.\n\nConstructed in the same 5th century BC timeframe as the Temple of Poseidon, Athena’s temple was less important. Because the entire structure was later disassembled in order to build other structures in Athens.\n\nNot only is the sanctuary a historical landmark, but it also serves as a nautical landmark.\n\nFrom the sea, ancient sailors saw these mighty marble pillars and knew they were nearing Athens. In the same way, modern-day cruisers thrill at the sublime sight.\n\nOn land, the Temple of Poseidon is a perfect place to watch the sunset into the Aegean Sea.\n\nTips to Visit the Temple of Poseidon\n\nFor a standard starting point, the driving distance between Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” (ATH) and Cape Sounio is about 28 miles (45 km).\n\nThe route takes roughly 1.5 to 2 hours, depending on traffic and weather conditions.\n\nIf you choose to drive, be aware; because the final stretch of road can be challenging, especially after dark.\n\nPublic KTEL buses, the OASA subway, and long-distance taxis are further options.\n\nOr, for comfort, convenience, and expert insight, consider a guided sunset tour with round-trip transportation between Athens and Cape Sounion.\n\nDiscover the best tour options.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Central Greece\n\nSanctuary of Delphi\n\nMount Parnassus in Central Greece holds an archaeological site of immense importance and wealth: the Sanctuary of Delphi.\n\nFor millenia, visitors traveled from afar to consult Pythia, the mysterious Oracle of Delphi by whom Apollo spoke.\n\nToday, visitors travel from afar to explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site, among Greece’s most important landmarks.\n\nThe god Apollo ruled supreme at the Sanctuary of Delphi. And the Temple of Apollo was his seat of supremacy.\n\nInside the Temple of Apollo, the high priestess Pythia sat on a tripod seat and proclaimed Apollo’s mystical Delphic Oracles.\n\nThe massive Apollon dates from the 4th century BC built over ancient ruins of earlier temples.\n\nThe site encompasses plentiful altars, stoas, treasuries, stoas, and temples. A gymnasium, hippodrome, stadium, and theatre attest to the festivals held throughout the ancient calendar.\n\nThe elegant Tholos of Athena Pronoia is perhaps the most photographed monument in Delphi. This circular temple to the goddess Athena of Providence has three Ionic columns on its round edge.\n\nLittle Legend of Delphi\n\nThe ancient Greeks believed the Sanctuary of Delphi to be the center of the earth. Literally.\n\nLegend tells us that Zeus sent two eagles in flight from opposite ends of the earth; their paths crossed here, between the Phaidriades peaks.\n\nInside the Temple of Apollo, the Omphalos monument marked the eagles’ intersection and the earth’s “navel.”\n\nTips to Visit Delphi\n\nThe driving distance between Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” (ATH) and Delphi is approximately 124 miles (200 km).\n\nKTEL public transportation buses and long-distance taxis are options without a car.\n\nTransportation aside, the best way to experience this far-reaching and far-flung archeological site is with a professional local guide.\n\nCheck the best tour options.\n\nModern Delphi and Arachova are two nearby towns, convenient locations for meals, coffee breaks, and hotels.\n\nThis author chose Arachova, about 6.5 miles (10.6 km) away from the Sanctuary of Delphi.\n\nAlthough especially popular in winter for Athens’ “ski and be seen” crowd, Arachova is postcard pretty all year.\n\nArachova’s historic center is a great place to stay. Quaint shops, restaurants, and cafes are within walking distance along its cobblestone streets.\n\nJust off the main plateia, Koukoura Square, the Ampolis Guest House welcomes you with charm and taste. In addition to a fireplace in each suite, heating and air conditioning ensure all-season comfort.\n\nIf you prefer, of course, the area overall has ski resorts, villas, and chalets.\n\nCheck the best rates for your stay.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Central Macedonia\n\nThessaloniki\n\nThe second-largest city in Greece, Thessaloniki bridges the past and present.\n\nAs Central Macedonia’s regional capital city, and the nation’s cultural capital, Thessaloniki (also known as Saloniki, Thessalonica, and Salonica) is an urban hub for the arts, fashion, finance, technology, and gastronomy innovations.\n\nFurthermore, Thessaloniki is a top tourist destination. CNN names Thessaloniki among the 23 Best Destinations 2023.\n\nWhite Tower of Thessaloniki\n\nFew sites impart the city’s influential status better than its once fearsome and infamous landmark: Lefkos Pyrgos, the White Tower of Thessaloniki.\n\nFormerly a defensive fortress and a notorious prison, the centuries-old tower remains an imposing fixture on the waterfront.\n\nIts severe stone exterior is unmistakable, at 112 feet (34 m) in height, topped by a turret another 20 feet (6 m) high.\n\nTradition maintains that the Venetians built this current tower circa 15th or 16th century. Meanwhile, scholars ascribe its construction to the Ottomans and debate its exact date of construction.\n\nLittle Legend of the White Tower of Thessaloniki\n\nThe White Tower of Thessaloniki has different names: Lion Tower, Tower of Janissaries, Tower of Blood, Red Tower, and the Bastille of Thessaloniki.\n\nThe origin of the White Tower name comes from the official White Tower source:\n\nIn 1883, Sultan Abdul Hamid II ordered the tower to be painted white to indicate that “winds of reform were blowing in the Ottoman Empire”.\n\nIn short, a convicted prisoner named Nathan Guiledi volunteered to paint the tower white. Offer accepted and the work completed, Guiledi thus gained his freedom.\n\nTips to Visit the White Tower of Thessaloniki\n\nBefore the 20th century, fortifications fully encircled the White Tower of Thessaloniki. In 1911, the defensive walls came down.\n\nNow that means visitors today can walk right up to the Tower, wander its circumference, and of course, take photographs.\n\nThe Museum of Byzantine Culture oversees the Museum of the White Tower.\n\nMount Olympus\n\nThe mythical home of Greek gods, Mount Olympus is Greece’s highest mountain and tallest natural landmark.\n\nPiercing the sky above the Macedonia and Thessaly regions, the highest point is Mytikas Peak at 9,572 feet (2,917 m) above sea level.\n\nIn 1938, Greece created its first National Park across 92 square miles (238 km2) on this most legendary mountain.\n\nIn 1981, Mount Olympus National Park became a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.\n\nThe reserve protects forests, gorges, ravines, rivers, waterfalls, and over 1,700 species of flora and fauna. Several species are rare and endangered, such as the bearded vulture and golden eagle.\n\nThe main attraction is hiking and climbing Mount Olympus. Trails range from gentle mountain paths to serious summit ascents.\n\nLittle Legend of Mount Olympus\n\nGreek mythology and Homeric traditions describe Olympus as the ethereal realm of the Panhellenic gods.\n\nTwelve Olympian gods resided in these celestial heights, inhabiting palaces and meeting together at the Pantheon of Mount Mytikas.\n\nMuses and other immortals lived in its foothills. In due time, real-life Iron Age mortals followed and built their villages here.\n\nTips to Visit Mount Olympus\n\nNestled on Olympus’ northern slope under Mytikas’ peak, Litochoro is the main town for visitors, walkers, mountain bikers, canyoners, climbers, and mountaineers.\n\nLitochoro is the home base for the main hiking associations because the most popular climbing route starts here to the Enipeas Gorge.\n\nAdditionally, Litochoro hosts the official Olympus National Park Information Center, an invaluable information resource.\n\nThe town itself is charming and historic, with a well-developed tourism infrastructure.\n\nAccommodations run the gamut from traditional guest houses and pensions to upscale boutique properties like Robolo Boutique Hotel.\n\nBonus, Litochoro overlooks the Thermaic Gulf. Yes, the Aegean Sea is only a few kilometers and a short drive away from Mount Olympus.\n\nAkrotiri Olympus Luxury Suites, a posh hotel in Gritsa Litochorou, boasts its own private beach on the Aegean Sea.\n\nInside Mount Olympus National Park, refuges accommodate overnight stays. Most are organized refuges; several have restaurants. Six refuges are emergency shelters.\n\nA few refuges remain open year-round; others open seasonally from May or June through October.\n\nThe Olympus National Park has refuge details, reservations, and contact information.\n\nIf you desire a delightful day in nature, then a slow-paced guided excursion is a great choice here.\n\nWhen you want serious hiking or high-adrenaline outdoor adventures, then a certified mountaineering guide is necessary.\n\nExplore the best tour and adventure options.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Crete\n\nAmong thousands of Greek Islands, Crete is the largest island and the most populated island. Numerous small islands and islets throng the coast, completing the Region of Crete.\n\nFurthermore, its land mass, shaped rather like a long spearhead, demarcates the South Aegean Sea from the Libyan Sea.\n\nMountain ranges, rivers, lakes, and coastlines define the dramatic terrain.\n\nCrete is blessed not only with great natural beauty but also agricultural bounty and bustling urbanity in its cities, towns, and villages.\n\nMinoan Palace of Knossos\n\nJust beyond the capital city, Heraklion, lies Crete’s top tourist attractions and most famous historical landmark: the Minoan Palace of Knossos.\n\nThis royal palace and four other archaeological sites display the arts and sciences of a highly advanced prehistoric culture: the Minoans.\n\nAltogether, Crete’s Minoan Palatial Centres make the UNESCO World Heritage Centre Tentative List.\n\nThe Bronze Age Minoan civilization dates from the 28th century BC to the 15th century BC. In sum, Minoans pre-date the Myceneans.\n\nFirstly, local Greek amateur archaeologist Minos Kalokairinos discovered the site in 1878.\n\nSecondly, from 1900 to 1931, British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans directed excavations of the Knossos labyrinth, ancient city, cemeteries, and more.\n\nEvans determined the singular aspects of the ancient site, art, and artifacts. Additionally, he deciphered Minoan Scripts Linear A and Linear B.\n\nMoreover, Evans reconstructed and repainted certain areas; for instance, the Northern Entrance, Throne Room, and Royal Villa.\n\nWith the result that the Minoan Palace of Knossos is surely Greece’s most colorful historic landmark.\n\nLittle Legend of Knossos Palace\n\nIn his epic Metamorphoses, the poet Ovid narrates the cautionary tale of Daedalus and his son Icarus.\n\nArchitect and inventor Daedalus designed the labyrinth at Knossos. But he yearned to elude King Minos, escape the ancient city, and return home to his native land.\n\nSo, clever Daedalus crafted great wings of feathers held together by beeswax. Accordingly, the pair escaped.\n\nAlthough his father had instructed Icarus to fly neither too high nor too low, the lad couldn’t withhold his exuberance. Higher and higher, he flew.\n\nUntil, alas, young Icarus flew too close to the sun. The scorching heat melted the wax.\n\nWith wings disintegrated, Icarus plunged to his death in the dark sea below.\n\nTips to Visit Knossos Palace\n\nWith the Minoan Palace of Knossos such a popular destination, the best time to visit in high season is either early morning or late afternoon. If the latter, then arrive 2 hours before closing to allow sufficient time to explore.\n\nThe best things to bring are bottled water, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.\n\nAlso, do wear sturdy shoes. Like many ancient sites, some sections are covered, and some paths are paved; otherwise, Knossos Palace is open to the elements.\n\nThe official government agency Hellenic Heritage provides opening hours, accessibility access, and other information.\n\nOn the whole, a guided tour deepens appreciation of the advanced civilization and refined culture in effect on Crete and elsewhere.\n\nCheck out the best tour options.\n\nSamaria Gorge\n\nCrete’s mountain ranges and gorges protect forests, flora, and fauna, including the vulnerable kri-kri Cretan goat.\n\nThe world-famous Gorge of Samaria National Park is between the White Mountains and Mount Volakias, on the southwest coast near Chania.\n\nPart of the EU Natura 2000 Network, Samaria Gorge is a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve.\n\nEurope’s longest gorge is the Samaria Gorge, extending about 8 miles (13 km) from north to south. With an additional 2 miles (3 km) stretch to the village of Agia Roumeli to return via ferry boat, the total distance is 10 miles (16 km).\n\nThe Gates are the most distinctive part of the trek. Here, the width narrows to about 13 feet (3 m) wide, and steep walls reach 980 feet (298 m) high.\n\nTips to Visit Samaria Gorge\n\nIn season, that is, May 1 to October 31, Samaria Gorge National Park opens daily from either 6 am or 7 am until 4 pm, weather permitting.\n\nOverall, Samaria Gorge is a challenging trek. The trail is a long, steep descent; with rocky outcrops and several river crossings either by small wooden bridges or stepping stones.\n\nIt’s a full-day hike, so the best time to start is early morning. Then, to return from Agia Roumelia to Chania requires a boat passage.\n\nThe Gorge has two access points: north at Xyloskalo near Omalos Plateau and south near the village of Aigia Roumeli.\n\nXyloskalo is the highest point at 4,025 feet (1,227 m) and the logical entrance. Because the trail descends from Xyloskalo to the lowest point Agia Roumeli, on the sea.\n\nThe best things to bring are water, layered clothing, a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen; and proper hiking shoes or hiking boots.\n\nNatural springs flow within the Gorge to re-fill bottles or canteens with fresh water.\n\nAlso, plan to put food and any essentials in your daypack. Because there are no shops or services inside Samaria National Park.\n\nFor public transportation, KTEL buses run to Omalos.\n\nAgia Roumeli has no access except by sea. Anendyk Seaways operates the Aiga Roumelia ferry service.\n\nFor ease and convenience of round-trip ground transportation and ferry ticket, as well as the benefit of a professional local trekker, consider a guided hike.\n\nSee the best options for hikes and outdoor adventures.\n\nSpinalonga Island\n\nNearby Elounda’s chic resorts on Crete’s eastern coast, Spinalonga Island makes the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List.\n\nFrom the late 1500s to 1903, a medieval fortress protected this strategic location for the Venetians and then the Ottomans. The latter also built homes and businesses here.\n\nLastly, from 1904 to 1957, Spinalonga served as one of Europe’s last leper colonies.\n\nThis small island may seem an unlikely tourist attraction in light of its sorrowful history and melancholy mood.\n\nBut in this case, its one-of-a-kind setting and story reveal the resilience, fortitude, and hope of the human spirit.\n\nAfter entering through Dante’s Gate, the best place to begin is the interpretative museum. Then wander the archeological site at leisure.\n\nSome buildings are restored; others remain ruined and abandoned throughout the archeological site.\n\nClimb up to the old citadel for a panoramic tableau and respectful reflections.\n\nBecause Spinalonga Island is, as UNESCO describes, “imbued with the aura of the people who lived here.”\n\nTips to Visit Spinalonga Island\n\nIn season, April to October, boats depart daily for Spinalonga Island from Plaka village (less than 10 minutes one-way ride), Elounda (about 30 minutes), and Agios Nikolaos (approximately 45 minutes).\n\nBefore or afterward, read The Island, an award-winning historical novel by British author Victoria Hislop.\n\nMega Channel Greece produced the international bestseller book as a 2010 Greek television series.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Eastern Macedonia and Thrace\n\nGreece’s remote Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (EMT) shares borders with Turkey and Bulgaria.\n\nAgriculture and viniculture have always been crucial to the economy here. Tsipouro brandy is a Greek Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) spirit. Sericulture (silk) also supports EMT’s ancient traditions.\n\nThe pristine natural environment, together with traditional culture, draws visitors to this area of the Balkans.\n\nDadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park\n\nPart of the EU Natura 2000 Network, the Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park is on the UNESCO World Heritage Centre Tentative Lists.\n\nRich biological diversity fills the park’s pine and oak forests with hundreds of species of plants, butterflies, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals.\n\nMoreover, Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park has over 200 species of birds. Its nickname is “the Land of the Birds of Prey.” There’s even a Birds of Prey Observatory.\n\nSo binoculars for bird watching are among the best things to bring along.\n\nOn the park’s outer edge is a geological landmark distinct in Europe: the Lefkimi-Fylkato Fossilized Forest.\n\nGreece’s oldest petrified forest features fossils in their original natural environment. Scientists attribute the oldest fossils to volcanic eruptions anywhere from 25 million to 40 million years ago.\n\nTips to Visit Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park\n\nFlights between Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos” (ATH) and the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (EMT) serve two airports:\n\nPrimarily, Dimokritos International Airport “Democritus” (AXD) in Alexandropoulis. Secondarily, Kavala International Airport “Megas Alexandros” (KVA).\n\nThe best way and also the fastest way to visit Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park is by car.\n\nThe driving distance between Dimokritos International Airport and Lefkimi is approximately 36 miles (59 km).\n\nPublic transportation options include KTEL and local buses to EMT’s towns and villages. Long-distance taxis also serve Lefkimi.\n\nAs EMT’s largest city, Alexandropoulis provides the most tourist infrastructure.\n\nBut consider Lefkimini as a perfect place to try rural Balkan life. Not to mention early morning immersion into the great outdoors.\n\nAdjacent to the Lefkimi-Fylkato Fossilized Forest, Apolithomeno Dasos Holiday Villas is an all-season bungalow resort.\n\nStone fireplaces, beamed ceilings, and warm woods enhance the cozy appeal. Updated bathrooms, fully equipped kitchens, and furnished patios complete each comfy cottage.\n\nCheck the best rates for your stay.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Epirus\n\nVikos Gorge\n\nDramatically deep Vikos Gorge is a must-see natural landmark in Zagori, the northwestern Region of Epirus.\n\nThe Guinness Book of World Records 1997 affirms Vikos Gorge to be one of the world’s deepest canyons for its width.\n\nIn essence, Vikos Gorge is “the Grand Canyon of Greece.”\n\nVikos Gorge lies within the Northern Pindos National Park, combining the National Forest of Vikos-Aoos and the National Forest of Pindos, i.e. Valia Calda UNESCO Global Geopark.\n\nNorthern Pindos National Park also contains other highlights: Mount Smolikas, Greece’s second-highest mountain at 8,651 feet (2,637 m) above sea level; as well as the Voidomatis River, Aoos River, Aoos Gorge, and Dragon Lake.\n\nTips to Visit Vikos Gorge\n\nIf trekking Vikos Gorge end to end is your goal, then the best time to visit Vikos Gorge is summer through early fall. Because at this time, the Voidomatis River is passable.\n\nNorthern Pindos National Park is open year-round, weather permitting. However, given that snow is heavy in winter months, access and access roads can be minimal.\n\nFive official Information Centers provide updated weather information as well as maps, hiking trails, sightseeing, observation platforms, and vista points in the National Park:\n\nZagori – Aspraggeli Information Center\n\nZagori – Vovousa Information Center\n\nMetsovo – Metsovo Information Center\n\nGrevena – Mavranaioi Information Center\n\nPapigo – Papigo Information Center\n\nThe centers further provide exhibitions, historical and other educational information.\n\nWith trails ranging from easy walks to adventuresome challenges, Vikos Gorge and the Zagorochoria reveal a phenomenal array of flora and fauna, stone villages, and stone bridges.\n\nDiscover an exciting array of guided tours, treks, and adventures.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Ionian Islands\n\nCorfu\n\nAs the “Door of Venice” in the Ionian Sea until the 17th century, Corfu Island embraces Venetian legacy, Italian spirit, and Greek vitality.\n\nFully surrounded by fortifications, Corfu Old Town is a true kastropolis (castle city) and UNESCO World Heritage Centre.\n\nThe Old Fortress protects the peninsula promontory, complete with the Contrafossa moat and drawbridge. Nowadays, the moat is a canal, and the bridge is permanent.\n\nWith pastel-hued neoclassical architecture in contrast to the ancient citadel and medieval walls, Old Town is a wonderful place to wander.\n\nTips to Visit Corfu\n\nTake a little break around the island, at its beautiful beaches, and on the azure Ionian Sea.\n\nOr, breathe in the fresh mountain air on Mount Paktokrator. Corfu’s highest point. Mount Pantokrator reaches 2,972 feet (906 m) above sea level.\n\nOn the slopes of Mount Pantokrator, an easy trail leads from Nymfes village to the Nymphs Waterfalls. These pretty waterfalls cascade from 49 feet (15 m) high into a natural pool.\n\nThe summit rewards with stunning seascapes across Corfu, Italy, and Albania. This vista point houses a communication station, a 17th-century chapel, and a cafe.\n\nSee Corfu’s best tour and activity options.\n\nZakynthos\n\nOne of the most touristed Greek Islands, Zakynthos vies with Corfu for the top spot in the Ionian Sea.\n\nName-dropped by Homer, Zakynthos mixes archeological sites and medieval elements. But the best landmarks are its natural marvels.\n\nGreece’s first National Marine Park in 1999, the beautiful Bay of Laganas is part of Europe’s Natura 2000 network.\n\nThe bay and Marathonisi islet protect the nesting grounds of endangered Caretta Caretta, loggerhead sea turtles. Marathonisi is often called “Turtle Island” because the turtles come to its fine white sands to dig their nests.\n\nZakynthos’ coastline features striking rock formations and sea cliffs. In particular, the Blue Caves are a series of sea caves carved by azure blue waters.\n\nThe island’s hottest hot spot is Navagio Beach. Fondly known as Shipwreck Beach due to the rusting ship MV Panagiotis, abandoned in 1980 on this white pebble beach.\n\nEnclosed by high cliffs in a cove accessible only by boat, Navagio Beach is extremely popular for swimming, picnicking, and photo ops. Indeed, some say it’s the number one most photographed beach in all of Greece.\n\nTips to Visit Zakynthos\n\nDue to Zakynthos International Airport “Dionysios Solomos” (ZTH) and ferry service, Zakynthos Island is easily accessible.\n\nThe most popular attractions, nevertheless, require some advance planning.\n\nIn the Bay of Laganas, the small island of Marathonisi requires a boat to visit. Then, only a fraction of the small island beach is open.\n\nBecause its white sands are protected breeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles.\n\nFurthermore, boat traffic can negatively affect the endangered Caretta Caretta, whose sightings are never guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, see and learn more at the Zakynthos Sea Turtle Rescue Center and Information Center on Gerakas Beach.\n\nIn any case, to reduce the impact on turtles and other marine life, please read and follow these guidelines from the Mediterranean Marine Life Center.\n\nNavagio Beach also requires a boat to visit. The beach has, at times, been restricted or limited due to landside concerns, such as in 2018 and again in 2023.\n\nBy sea, smaller excursion boats can access the Blue Caves in good weather and maritime conditions. Larger boats must remain outside the caves.\n\nThese landmark locations are very popular in the summer months. So the best time to visit is as early as possible in the morning.\n\nNavagio Beach (Shipwreck Beach) and the Blue Caves combine well on a boat excursion with a professional captain.\n\nCheck the best tour options and boat excursions.\n\nOn foot, the Blue Caves are accessible via a staircase by the Potamitis Windmills and Potamitis Brothers Restaurant.\n\nThe staircase zig-zags down the steep cliffside to the Blue Caves.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: North Aegean Sea\n\nChios\n\nThe birthplace of Homer, Chios offers Byzantine churches, a Genoese castle, lively towns, and lovely beaches.\n\nYet what most distinguishes Chios is its exclusive cultural landmark of mastic agriculture and Mastic Villages.\n\nMastic Villages and Sfgraffito\n\nA natural resin from trees, mastic is grown, harvested, and produced by hand only on Chios. Mastic is a Greek Protected Domaine of Origin (PDO) crop.\n\nMastic cultivation is part of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Greece.\n\nThe translucent resin droplets are used in mastic gum, oil, powder, mastiha ouzo, mastiha liqueur, and much more.\n\nTwenty-four villages comprise the landmark Mastic Villages, the Mastichochoria, in southern Chios.\n\nPyrgi is the largest Mastic Village, distinctive for its decorative sgraffito facades. The sgraffito painting technique layers tinted plaster to create ornamental designs.\n\nFortified gates, archways, alleys, and stone architecture amplify a romantic medieval mood in the Mastichochoria.\n\nNea Moni\n\nAdditionally, Chios is home to Nea Moni, an 11th-century Byzantine monastery and UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nImperial patronage endowed the monastic complex with marble, mosaics, and other “indisputable masterpieces” from “the second golden age of Byzantine art.”\n\nTips to Visit Chios\n\nChios Airport “Omiros” (JKH) serves flights from Athens and Thessaloniki regularly, other destinations in season.\n\nFerries run between Piraeus, Lesbos, and Thessaloniki, as well as Cesme, Türkiye.\n\nA quick and easy day trip from Chios is Oinousses. Part of EU’s Natura 2000 Network, this group of nine small islands and islets are serene hidden gems.\n\nSculpted by Chios’ award-winning artist Mary Papaconstantinou, a bronze mermaid perches on a rock in the harbor, greeting visitors since 1986.\n\nTake a look at the best tour options.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Peloponnese\n\nCorinth Canal\n\nLong and narrow, the Corinth Canal unites the Region of Peloponnese and mainland Greece.\n\nEnvisioned and attempted since antiquity, the Canal of Corinth is not one of Greece’s ancient monuments.\n\nSurprisingly, the canal is a 19th-century project. Groundbreaking began in 1881, and the canal opened in 1893.\n\nThe Corinthian Canal proceeds in a single straight line for about 4 miles (6.4 km) between the Gulf of Corinth in the Ionian Sea and the Saronic Gulf in the Aegean Sea.\n\nTowering limestone walls emphasize the canal’s narrow width, less than 81 feet (24.6 m) at sea level.\n\nThe dimensions limit the types and size of ship traffic, of course, so you won’t see the big commercial ships as on the Suez Canal or Panama Canal.\n\nBesides watching sailboats, yachts, and tourist boats sail through, people cheer to watch adventurers bungee jump from the bridge with the official outfitter, Zulu Bungy.\n\nWelcoming you to Mythical Peloponnese, the Corinth Canal Tourist Information Center highlights the region’s considerable landmarks and major attractions.\n\nAncient Corinth\n\nThrough the ages, the city-state of Ancient Corinth exerted might, wealth, and influence far beyond its borders.\n\nWith two harbors, one on the Corinthian Gulf and another on the Saronic Gulf, and a formidable fortified acropolis, Ancient Corintha remained viable and valuable for millenia.\n\nAncient ruins include the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore, Peirene Fountain, Roman Odeon, and portions of the Long Walls leading to Lechaeum, the primary port.\n\nTwo monumental landmarks emphatically convey the power of Ancient Corinthia:\n\nFirstly, the Temple of Apollo in the Agora of Corinth dates from the mid-6th century BC. Seven of the original 42 Doric columns stand tall on this Archaic Greek temple.\n\nSecondly, the Acropolis of Acrocorinth dominates the Isthmus of Corinth. Beginning late 7th century or early 6th century BC, first Greeks, then Romans, Crusaders, Venetians, and Ottomans continually strengthened and expanded Acrocorinth\n\nWith its prime position on a high rocky hill and its freshwater spring, the citadel continues to demand respect today.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: South Aegean Sea\n\nSantorini\n\nBright white cubes and bold blue domes define the Cyclades, nowhere more astonishing than Santorini.\n\nSailing into the caldera, Santorini’s volcanic crater is one of the world’s great arrival experiences.\n\nSantorini Island (also known as Thira, Thera, and Fira) is itself a geological landmark formed by volcanic eruption.\n\nAgainst the sapphire South Aegean Sea, the contrast of dramatic landscape and brilliant colors astonish and amaze.\n\nSantorini’s breathtaking sunsets, black sand beaches, luxurious lifestyle, and endless photo ops are irresistible.\n\nRegrettably, it must be said that photo ops too often intrude on the roofs of private homes and blue domes of churches.\n\nDespite these understandable allures, Santorini boasts one especially important ancient landmark to visit: Minoan Akrotiri.\n\nDestroyed in a volcanic eruption circa 17th century BC, Akrotiri of Thera links to the Bronze Age Minoan civilization so well developed on Crete.\n\nAkrotiri was a sophisticated city with multi-story architecture, paved streets, and plumbing. Elaborate frescoes and elegant furnishings decorated the homes.\n\nIn a similar fashion to Pompeii in Italy, volcanic ash preserved the furniture outlines and also protected the ornate paintings.\n\nLittle Legend of Santorini\n\nVarious traditions deem Santorini to be a leading candidate for the lost island of Atlantis and Akrotiri as the lost city of Atlanteans.\n\nWas submerged Atlantis either actual history, historical fiction, or mythological invention?\n\nWell, come visit prehistoric Akrotiri and decide for yourself.\n\nTips to Visit Akrotiri\n\nGiven that a modern climate-controlled shelter envelops the site, which is fully accessible to all, Akrotiri is pleasant to visit any time.\n\nAkrotiri is compelling, too, not only for the ruins but also for its legends and real stories.\n\nAccess the best tour options.\n\nMykonos\n\nThe trend of Mykonos as a glitterati magnet is nothing new. Because the VIP scene on this Cycladic Island goes back to the 1960s.\n\nFirst came the artists, the bohemians, and the romantic travelers. Then came the celebrities, the jetsetters, and their entourages. The paparazzi straightway followed the stars.\n\nAmidst swanky beach clubs, stylish nightlife, and the best luxury hotels, its most famous landmark has humble, hard-working origins:\n\nStout and sturdy Mykonos windmills once powered the island from the 16th century to the 19th century. The windmills captured the Meltemi winds blowing from the North.\n\nToday, these white-washed Venetian-built windmills still dot the island. Many are restored, and some are renovated for vacation rentals.\n\nArrayed in a tidy line in Mykonos Town, the much-photographed Kato Mili windmills are quintessential Mykonos landmarks.\n\nLittle Venice is another Mykonos landmark. These picturesque houses with cute wooden balconies cluster on the Aegean’s edge.\n\nRhodes\n\nMedieval City of Rhodes\n\nPresiding over the Dodecanese Islands, Rhodes plays a starring role in medieval history and contemporary tourism.\n\nFor over 200 years, from 1309 to 1522, Rhodes was a Crusader stronghold and headquarters for the Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem.\n\nThe Knights Hospitaller fashioned Rhodes, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre, in Gothic glory.\n\nThe ancient citadel city withstood earthquakes and onslaughts, shielded by a 2.4 mile (4 km) long wall, stalwart ramparts, and medieval know-how.\n\nBut at last, following a long siege by Suleiman the Magnificent, the Knights surrendered in 1522 and departed Rhodes in 1523.\n\nUNESCO notes that “the chain of history was not broken in 1523 but rather continued up to 1912.”\n\nThis unbroken chain makes medieval Rhodes one of the most fascinating historical sites.\n\nPalace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes\n\n“One of the most beautiful urban ensembles of the Gothic period,” to quote UNESCO, the Palace of the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes astounds in scale and style.\n\nSimply put, the Grand Master Palace is among the most impressive medieval landmarks anywhere.\n\nFrom 7th-century Byzantine fortress to 14th-century Gothic grandeur to 20th-century Italian restoration, the Kastello continues to be relevant in 21st-century events.\n\nLittle Legend of Rhodes\n\n“One of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World Becomes the No. 1 Wonder of the Modern Screen” declares the trailer for a 1960s scandalous (and fabulous!) film by Italian director Sergio Leone.\n\nYes, the Colossus of Rhodes was one of the real Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nSimilar to the golden statue of goddess Athena on the Acropolis of Athens, this gigantic bronze statue of Helios glimmered from Rhodes far across the sea.\n\nAncient accounts agree that Chares of Lindos was the sculptor. But its exact location in Rhodes’ harbor, construction methods, and height description differ in ancient accounts.\n\nNonetheless, consensus holds the Colossus was about 105 feet (32 m).\n\nDuring the 3rd century BC, the Colossus inspired awe and wonder throughout the ancient world. Until it fell over in an earthquake.\n\nTips to Visit Rhodes\n\nWith Rhodes a top tourist destination, even in shoulder season and especially in summer, timing matters to visit the Grand Masters Palace, its top attraction.\n\nThe best time to go is either at opening hour or in late afternoon. Correspondingly, a stroll along the Street of the Knights satisfies the senses. Also, it’s a fabulous photo op when empty.\n\nThen, if schedule permits, take a short walk or long stroll along the castle walls. Bring water, a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen.\n\nLastly, consider a professional guided tour to understand Rhodes’ complex history and equally complex architecture.\n\nView the best tour options.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Thessaly\n\nMeteora\n\nAbove Thessaly’s golden fields and green mountains, soaring sandstone pillars rise in sheer splendor against the sky.\n\nAtop these individual towering peaks, monumental faith built the monasteries of Meteora, a UNESCO World Heritage Centre.\n\nIn the 11th century AD, hermits seeking solitude first scaled these steep rock formations.\n\nOver time, hauling up stone after stone, the monks built by hand a total of 24 monasteries atop 24 peaks.\n\nToday, six remain as living monasteries, inhabited and active.\n\nThese six Meteora monasteries differ in accessibility for present-day visitors:\n\nWith 300 steps each, the Holy Monasteries of Great Meteoron and the Holy Trinity are the longest climb up and down.\n\nThe Holy Monasteries of Rousanou, Saint Nicolaos Anapfasas, and Varlaam each have approximately 140 steps.\n\nThe Holy Monastery of Saint Stefanos has the easiest accessibility, thanks to a small bridge instead of steps.\n\nOh yes, and Saint Stefanos is a thriving convent.\n\nIn 1961, a small group of Orthodox nuns petitioned for permission to reside in and restore the 15th-century monastery.\n\nToday, Saint Stefanos’ religious community continues to grow, attracting women of all ages to godly service.\n\nTips to Visit Meterora\n\nWhether you arrive by train, bus, or car – which you can certainly do on a day trip from Athens or Thessaloniki – a guided tour is the best way to visit Meteora.\n\nThe access road up and down to the monasteries is crowded with buses, bicyclists, and occasionally pedestrians.\n\nSo leave the driving to the expert, relax in plush leather seats, and listen to the professional local guide.\n\nSince narration isn’t allowed at the monasteries, your newfound knowledge deepens your experience and appreciation at each monastery.\n\nExplore the best Meteora tour options.\n\nThis author and this photographer highly recommend the small group tour experience with the award-winning local agency Visit Meteora.\n\nThe town Kalampaka, along with neighboring village Kastraki, is the gateway to visit Meteora.\n\nKalampaka is worthwhile for an overnight stay, with lively shops, restaurants, and its own special landmark off the beaten path.\n\nBuilt from the ground up in a central location, The Storyteller Boutique House opened in 2022. This family-owned boutique luxury hotel purposefully designed quality and comfort in every detail:\n\nFrom free secured guest parking to barrier-free entrances and an elevator. Five serene guest rooms, sleek bathrooms, and thoughtful amenities. As well as fine books curated to different literary and film themes.\n\nCheck the best rates for your stay.\n\nTips to Visit Monasteries\n\nModest attire is necessary for all visitors; bare shoulders, arms, and legs are not allowed. Each monastery should have inexpensive shawls to purchase at its entrance.\n\nWhether on your own or a guided tour, monastery admission is additional. So, bring cash for the nominal admission fees; 3 Euros at this time of publication.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Western Greece\n\nAncient Olympia\n\nBroadcast to billions around the world, the Modern Olympic Games trace their origins to Ancient Olympia in Olympian Land, the western Peloponnese peninsula.\n\nAncient Olympia is a UNESCO World Heritage Centre.\n\nEvery four years starting circa 776 BC, the Ancient Olympic Games welcomed the Pan-Hellenic world to this verdant valley. Athletes and spectators gathered at the confluence of two rivers.\n\nThousands of years later, officials continue the rituals by lighting the Olympic flame for all Modern Olympic Games here.\n\nThe ancient Greeks celebrated more than athletic prowess and peaceful competition here. The ancient archaeological site of Olympia was a sacred complex, the Sanctuary of Zeus.\n\nAs such, the site in ancient times held hundreds of buildings, few more famous than the Temple of Zeus and the Ancient Olympic Stadium.\n\nTemple of Zeus at Olympia\n\nBefitting the King of Greek gods, the Doric Temple of Zeus contained one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World:\n\nIn the 5th century BC, eminent Phidias of Parthenon fame sculpted a superlative statue of Zeus enthroned in gold and ivory.\n\nExcavations in the 20th century AD uncovered Phidias’ workshop on-site, complete with tools, molds, and material remnants.\n\nUnfortunately, like the goddess Athena on the Acropolis of Athens and the Colossus of Rhodes, this exquisite sculpture from the Temple of Zeus in Ancient Olympia disappeared long ago.\n\nStadium at Ancient Olympia\n\nOne of the best places and most beloved attractions in Olympian Land, the Stadium invites you to follow in the footsteps of ancient athletes:\n\nFirstly, walk through the vaulted tunnel into the stadium. Take your position on the marble starting blocks.\n\nThen, hear the starting whistle silently blow. Then run like the wind down the track.\n\nFinally, cross the finish line in triumph. Raise your arms in a “V” for victory.\n\nLastly, visualize the enthusiastic crowd leaping to their feet. Their applause is a thunderous barrage.\n\nNow feel the eternal thrill to place the victor’s wreath of olive leaves on your brow.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Western Macedonia\n\nLake Orestiada, Kastoria\n\nIn the Region of Western Macedonia, Lake Orestiada (Orestias) is a Greek National Monument of Natural Beauty.\n\nRugged mountains frame the tranquil lake, approximately 11 square miles (28 km2). With the historic town Kastoria rising on the promontory, the alpine ambiance enchants.\n\nA long waterfront promenade connects bustling New Town Kastoria with Byzantine Kastoria.\n\nThe lakefront is the best area for locals and visitors alike to exercise, see, and be seen at one or another of the numerous waterfront cafes.\n\nWithin the EU Natura 2000 network, the lakeshore makes a perfect location for year-round bird watching.\n\nOver 50 species of birds, including threatened and rare species, flock to Lake Orestiades.\n\nKastoria’s famous mute swans, pelicans, mallard geese, and other water birds remain year-round. More species migrate here to nest and breed during the winter months.\n\nAnother lakeside natural attraction is Spileo Drakou, Cave of the Dragon. It’s located on the peninsula, about 1.5 miles (2.5 km) beyond Kastoria Old Town.\n\nSignificantly large, the Dragon’s Cave has underground freshwater lakes, the only ones in Greece; bridges, halls, tunnels, and of course, countless stalactites and stalagmites.\n\nTips to Visit Lake Orestiada, Kastoria\n\nThe driving distance between Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venezilos” (ATH) and Kastoria is about 370 miles (595 km).\n\nKastoria National Airport “Aristotelis” (KSO) is a small local airport, busiest in peak season.\n\nTo clarify, the peak season here in Kastoria is the winter months. When snow falls on the mountains, Mount Visti ski resort opens, and Lake Orestiades occasionally freezes.\n\nIn all four seasons, Hotel Doltso is a great option in Kastoria. In the heart of Old Town’s best district, Hotel Doltso has an ideal location with easy access to New Town.\n\nThe owners renovated the family’s 19th-century stone manor house into a boutique luxury hotel. The historic building imparts a touch of French flair in its 10 modern rooms and bathrooms.\n\nCheck the best rates for your stay.\n\nFamous Landmarks in Greece: Mount Athos\n\nThe Holy Mountain and Mount Athos peninsula form an ancient, sacred, and somewhat autonomous region in Central Macedonia’s Chalkidiki peninsula.\n\nSince AD 972, when Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimiskes signed its first constitution, Mount Athos has been the spiritual heart of all Orthodox monastic communities. As well as a UNESCO World Heritage Centre.\n\nToday, more than 1,000 monks from Greece, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and other Orthodox countries live, work, and worship in approximately 20 historic monasteries.\n\nFaith permeates every aspect of life. From religious pursuits; for example, liturgical services and icon painting. To practical vocations; for instance, farms, forestry, kitchens, libraries, etc.\n\nMount Athos is like nowhere else. So much so that Guinness World Records 1977 records Mount Athos as the world’s most male-dominated society.\n\nBecause a law from AD 1066 specifies no females of any age, or boys under 18 without fathers or guardians, may set foot on Mount Athos.\n\nLittle Legend of Mount Athos\n\nTradition tells us that in the 1st century AD, Saint John the Evangelist and the Holy Mother sheltered on Mount Athos during a storm.\n\nFrom that time on, Athonite traditions, and the 1066 law, state the Virgin Mary would be the only female to set foot on Holy Mountain.\n\nTips to Visit Mount Athos for Male Pilgrims\n\nAs mentioned, only males may visit Mount Athos. All male pilgrims, whether Orthodox or not, must seek a date-specific permit or visa before the pilgrimage.\n\nAge and other regulations apply to receive this written permission. Agioritiki Estia, the official Mount Athos Center, explains the application protocol and process for potential pilgrims.\n\nTo make reservations up to six months prior, contact the Pilgrims Bureau Office in Thessaloniki via phone, fax, or email at:\n\nThe Mount Athos Pilgrims’ Bureau\n\nEgnatia Street 109\n\n54622 Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nPhone: +(30) 2310-252578\n\nFax: +(30) 2310-222424\n\nE-mail: athosreservation(at)gmail(dot)com\n\nTips to Visit Mount Athos for Everyone\n\nFor women, couples, families, and everyone else, the best way and, in truth, the only way to see Mount Athos is on a boat tour.\n\nSmall cruise ships and private boats with local guides can sail as close as 1,640 feet (500 m) to the Holy Mountain’s shoreline.\n\nCertain cruises and private boats take a sacred approach, a pilgrimage by sea if you will.\n\nOther group tours are secular in nature. Some excursions include a visit to Ammouliani, the inhabited island of Chalkidiki, or other scenic spots.\n\nThe best time to plan an Athonite pilgrimage, by land for men or by sea for others, is either mid-April to mid-June or mid-September through October.
