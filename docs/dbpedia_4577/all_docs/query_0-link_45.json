It was manufactured by the Athenians in 132 AD to honor the emperor Hadrian for the several developments he made in Athens. At the time of its construction it was a landmark between the old and the new city of Athens.\n\nHadrian's Gate combines Roman and Greek architecture, having the Roman arch at the bottom and the Greek portico at the top. It is 18 meters high and has a width of 13 meters."
