        "text": "The inscription on the façade of the Pantheon translates to Marcus Agrippa, the son of Lucius, three times consul, built this. Generally such an inscription clarifies confusion surrounding the origins of a monument; in this case, it has been the source of conflict in the debate over when and by whom the Pantheon was built. Descriptions of the Pantheon are not prevalent in ancient literature, and so for a long time scholars hypothesized about the origins of the building.\n\nThe architecture only added to the confusion surrounding the Pantheons origins because there is a certain degree of discontinuousness between the three parts: the porch, the intermediate connecting block, and the rotunda. The Greek style columnar portico contrasts the Roman style rotunda. In addition, the relatively low porch next to the exceptionally high impediment of the rectangular intermediate block proves an awkward combination.\n\nIn an attempt to explain the inconsistencies of the building, many theories have been developed. Michaelangelo suspected that portions of the Pantheon were built by different architects who had varying levels of skill. Palladio believed that Agrippa had merely added onto an already existing Republican-era building. Beltrami recognized a Hadrianic influence, but also mistakenly believed that the Pantheon was built in separate portions.\n\nIt was not until the early 1900s that the controversy surrounding the origins of the Pantheon was brought to rest. Bricks from all parts of the building were studied for their stamps indicating the date when they were made, as well as the names of prominent government officials at the time. Dating of the bricks conclusively set the time range in which the Pantheon was built to be 120-128 AD. The beginning of construction may have begun as early as 118 AD to clear the space for the buildings foundations. This time period for construction proves the Pantheon was built under the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL BUILDING\n\nThe name Pantheon comes from the Greek words pan and theon, which mean all and gods, respectively. The Pantheon as it is known today was actually built on the site of another Pantheon that served as a temple for all the Roman gods. The first building was built by Marcus Agrippa around 27 AD to celebrate the victory of his father-in-law, the emperor Augustus, at Actium over Antony and Cleopatra. Located in the Campus Martius, the original building was rectangular and faced south. However, this building was completely destroyed by a fire. Domitian had the Pantheon restored in 80 AD, only to have it struck by lightening and burnt to the ground again in 110 AD. The destruction of the original Pantheon was considered a bad omen suggesting that the pagan gods were unhappy with the temple that was built to honor them. The remains of the Pantheon were thus left in place for nearly eight years until Hadrian became emperor and began his building program, which produced the Pantheon that still stands today.\n\nHISTORY OF THE SPACE\n\nSince its inception in 128 AD, the Pantheon has had a long history. Renovated by Septimius Severus and Caracalla, the Pantheon fell into disrepair, as did many Roman buildings, after Constantine moved the center of the empire from Rome to Constantinople. During the rise of Christianity, the Pantheon was abandoned and then pillaged by the Goths. By 600 AD, after the Tiber flooded, mud accumulated around the building and it is believed that the Pantheon might have become filled with dirt, allowing trees to grow inside. In 609 AD, Pope Boniface IV rededicated the Pantheon as the Church of Sancta Maria ad Martyres and according to legend a multitude of devils fled shrieking through the oculus when he did so. It is rumored that at this time, twenty-eight wagonloads of martyrs' bones were brought to rest at the Pantheon from the catacombs. The Pantheon was the first Roman temple to be consecrated as a church, and doing so saved it from ruin because the church dedicated a great deal of wealth to maintain the building. In 1101, after the popes moved to Avignon, the Pantheon served as a fortress in the struggles between the Colona and the Orsini, two rival Roman aristocratic families. Bernini also added two bell towers in the 1500s, which made the Pantheon appear more like a traditional church. However, the awkward appearance of the bell towers quickly earned them the nickname of the ass-ears of Bernini and they were consequently removed in 1883.\n\nHaving been built between 118-128 AD, the Pantheon possesses architectural features that were popular during its construction, while also maintaining its own uniqueness. The porch and the intermediate block assume a Greek style, with an entablature resting on sixteen columns. After passing through the portico, one encounters the large rotunda that follows a Roman style because the large dome is supported by exerting strain on the walls of the cylinder on which it rests. The particular design of the Pantheon, including the unification of Greek and Roman style, has led to speculation as to who the architect of the Pantheon was. While conclusive evidence of the identity of the architect has yet to be found, some believe Hadrian might have designed the entire building. Hadrian had a strong interest in architecture, and had a love for both Greek and Roman culture. Thus, the Pantheon symbolizes his attempt to combine both cultures architectural styles in one building.\n\nThe building of the Pantheon would have been a huge undertaking. In total, five thousand tons of concrete were used to build the rotunda by pouring successive rings of concrete into a previously constructed wooden framework. The walls of the cylinder were six meters wide to support the strain of the entire dome on the foundation. The height and diameter of the interior rotunda both measure 43.3 m; the implication of this is that a perfect sphere with a same diameter would fit just perfectly inside the rotunda. The oculus, or opening at the top of the dome, measures 8.8 m across and significantly lightens the load on the foundation of the structure. It is also in keeping with the belief that there should not be a roof on a Roman temple. Serving as the major source of light in the Pantheon, the oculus also allows in rain and snow, setting a different atmosphere throughout the seasons. The floor is sloped towards drains that are present to collect rain. Blind windows line the rotunda, probably meant to let light into the extensive network of passageways that are used by maintenance crews. William MacDonald, a Pantheon expert, believes that the windows also allow the building to breathe by circulating air to prevent moisture collection that could cause cracks in the cast cement. The marble work on the floor containing patterns of circles and squares is a 19th century accurate reproduction of the original floor.\n\nWhen observing the Pantheon from outside, the columns play a significant role in adding to the grandeur. The sixteen monolithic columns are made of red and gray granite and the shafts stand 40 Roman feet tall. Carved in eastern Egypt, the transport of the columns to the construction site required them to be floated up the Nile River on a barge, through Mediterranean Sea and up the Tiber River. Once they reached Rome, they were carried down the streets of the city and then erected. Three of the columns on the east side of the building fell, and were replaced by the Pope Urban VIII and Alexander VII. The columns of the Pantheon have prompted a lot of discussion because scholars believe that if the columns had only been 10 Roman feet taller, they would have allowed for continuity between the porch and intermediate block that is lacking in the current structure. Certainly 50 Roman foot monolithic columns were considerably more difficult to acquire; it is quite possible that the larger columns were instead used for the Temple of Trajan, which was being built by Hadrian around the same time for his adoptive father. Problems with obtaining larger columns may have thus prompted the architect of the Pantheon to compromise and use smaller columns. Politically, it would have been important for Hadrian to devote the larger columns to the Temple of Trajan to show respect for Trajan, especially because the size of the columns was very important to the Temple of Trajan since it dictated the size of the entire building, whereas it was not as crucial to the structure of the Pantheon.\n\nWhen it was first built, the entire exterior of the dome, as well as the interior of the coffered ceiling, would have been covered in bronze. However, some of the bronze was removed to make the 80 cannons at Castel SantAngelo, Hadrians mausoleum, but was eventually returned when it was melted down for the tomb of Vittorio Emanuele II, which now rests at the Pantheon. Some more of the bronze was pilfered by the Goths, but most of it was taken by the Barberini Pope Urban VIII, prompting the expression what the barbarians did not do, the Barberini did.\n\nMany aspects of the exterior as evident today would have been very different when the Pantheon was first built. The brickwork covering the outer wall of the rotunda would have been covered in stucco, marble paneling, or even travertine. Currently, the Pantheon sits somewhat sunken into the floor because the street level has risen around the building. Originally, the Pantheon would have sat high above street level, with five steep stairs used to reach it.\n\nSince it was rededicated as a church, the Pantheon houses a collection of religious art and several tombs. Upon entering the rotunda, the first chapel to the right is a fresco of The Annunciation, attributed to Melozzo da Forli or Antoniazzo Romano, and two 17th century angel statues flank the fresco. In the aedicule is a 14th century fresco of The Coronation of the Virgin. The second chapel contains the tomb of the first king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II. In the main apse is an icon of The Virgin and Child, dating from the 7th century. The tomb of the artist Raphael also lies in the Pantheon, as requested by Raphael when he studied the Pantheon during his report on the state of monuments, after he was appointed to serve as the superintendent of antiquities in 1515. Other artists buried in the Pantheon include Giovanni da Udine, Perino del Vaga, Taddeo Zuccari, Annibale Carraci, and Baldasare Peruzzi. The niches contain statues of various saints and priests.\n\nWhen it was initially built, the Pantheon was meant to serve as an assembly hall where the public could gather. Hadrian would have sat in a throne to oversee public gatherings. While meant to represent all gods as its name suggests, the Pantheon was not necessarily used as a temple because it lacked the rectangular shape of previous temples. In part, the Pantheon was meant to appease the gods because the destruction of the previous buildings in its place was seen as a sign that the gods were unhappy. In the niches would have originally stood statues of various gods, and deified emperors. For example, a statue of Augustus was placed in one of the main recesses.\n\nOne of the main purposes of the building, was for Hadrian to give the Roman people something to be proud of. A viewer approaching the Pantheon when it was first built would have had to look up to see the entire front porch. The bronze covered rotunda would have glowed in the sun. Upon entering the rotunda, the viewer would have been stunned by all the exquisite marble and grandeur of the dome. The interior of the rotunda was also symbolic of the greatness of the empire. The domes lack of corners shows no beginning or end, symbolizing continuity, perfection, and permanence. This was meant to demonstrate how the Roman empire was to be seen. The perfection of the dome also reminded the viewer of the continuity of the heavens, showing a connection to the Roman gods. When Hadrian had court under the dome, he would have appeared to have great power by being watched over by the gods. The pattern of circles and squares on the floor would have also symbolized the order of the empire. In addition, the construction of the Pantheon in a relatively short time of ten years would have undoubtedly provided work for thousands."
