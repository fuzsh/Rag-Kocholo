        "text": "First of all, let me introduce myself, my name is Glykeria. I am a 24 year old, full-blooded Greek, living in Greece. I have studied tourism and hospitality for the last 4 years and have been working during the summer seasons as a waitress at the luxurious- Grecotel Amirandes Exclusive Resort on the greek island of Crete. The Dupert’s love for Greece started back in 2012 with Jared’s first mission trip. In 2015 during his fourth trip (along with a group of teens on their first mission trip) Jared met me and I gave them their first guided tour around Thessaloniki and Kavala. Later that year was Ashley’s first trip to Greece, they both started to really bond with the people here and they have been in our lives ever since. I always remember them having a heart for Greek ministry and this article is a small glimpse into why they love Greece so much; the people, lifestyle, design, culture and of course the FOOD! As the years have gone by their love only grows bigger and their relationships get stronger. This country holds a special place in their hearts and I am really blessed to be part of their extended family here. So when they asked if I would write a guest blog inspired by Ancient Greek architecture, it’s evolution through history and the modern side of Grecian design- I was thrilled and thankful for their trust. So here we go!\n\nCharacteristics of Ancient Greek Architecture\n\nOne of the main characteristics of the ancient buildings in Greece is the absolute harmonization with the natural environment. Everything in their construction was designed to blend perfectly, depending on the landscape that existed and to emphasize those characteristics in a unique way. The choice of location, altitude, sunlight and natural environment were parameters that the architects of that time took into account in order to achieve these amazing results. Ancient Greece has influenced many world architectural movements throughout the centuries, for example the Renaissance movement and the Neoclassical style. Many worldwide masterpieces were inspired by the Classical architecture in Greece, particularly the ancient Greek style of Doric, Ionic or Corinthian order.\n\nThe most recognizable “Greek” structure is the temple. The term temple is derived of the Latin word, templum and the Greeks refer to temples as ὁ ναός (ho naós) meaning \"dwelling.\" The earliest temples were built to honor divinities and were made from materials such as a wood and mud brick- materials that typically don't survive very long. The most basic form of these dwellings emerged as early as the 10th century BC as a simple, rectangular room with projecting walls that created a shallow type of porch. This basic form remained unchanged in its concept for centuries. In the 8th century BC Greek architecture began to transition from ephemeral materials (wood/mud brick) to more permanent materials namely, stone & marble.\n\nPerhaps the most famous expression of Classical Greek architecture, is the temple on the hill of the Acropolis, Parthenon, in Athens—a Doric order structure. The Parthenon represents the maturity of the Greek classical form. Despite the fact that the Doric and Ionic orders were used side by side, there are other elements that make the Parthenon very unique. To get a more satisfying and ecstatic result, the builders used some architectural “tricks.” The horizontal surfaces of the building are geometrically curved, not completely flat. The columns become smaller as they move upwards and tilt slightly towards the middle of the temple. Also the columns located in the corners of the temple have a larger diameter than the rest. In this way the temple’s characteristics deviate from the norm but are automatically corrected by the human eye- much like an optical illusion where uses of color, size, light and pattern send a misleading picture to our brains. The information gathered by the eye is processed by the brain and creates a perception of perfection, that in reality, does not match the true image.\n\nMinoan vs. Mycenaean Architecture\n\nDespite the fact that both of them flourished in Crete, they are completely different. The most famous architectural achievement of the trade based, Minoan civilization is definitely the impressive Palace of Knossos. On the contrary, the Mycenaean people were frequently involved in wars and that is why the towns had such large, defensively strong structural walls.\n\nRoman/Byzantine Architectural Influence\n\nRoman architecture is a mixture of ancient Greek, Phoenician and Etruscan styles. In Athens, there are many structures from the Roman period such as the Arch of Hadrian. The Byzantine Empire had a strong religious base and Christianity was quickly made the official religion. Although the first Byzantine churches were oblong in size and had one central aisle, with time a great innovation appeared… the dome. The most common material used for their construction, was brick. As the Byzantine Empire started to fall, Greece was gradually conquered by the Venetians. The most famous Venetian towns in Greece are the Old Town of Rhodes, Corfu, Chania, and Rethymno in Crete. After the 16th century, almost the entire country had fallen to the Ottomans, which left a vivid signs in many towns and islands. Very characteristic Ottoman monuments are the mosques in Kos, Crete, and Rhodes as well as the Ottoman baths in the Old Town of Chania.\n\nModernizing Neoclassical Greek Architecture\n\nThe establishment of the modern Greek state in the late 1820s, after four centuries of Ottoman rule, marked a crucial point in the historical course of Greece. King Otto, the first king of modern Greece, in this effort to connect the glorious classical past with the present, made Athens the capital of Greece. He also invited the famous Austrian architect Theophil Hansen and his student Ernst Ziller to design and build monuments of Neoclassical style all over Greece. Among their most famous works are the “Neoclassical Trilogy of Athens” (the Academy, the Library and the University of Athens) and many others including: the Presidential Mansion of Athens, the Athens Numismatic Museum and the Church of Saint Gregory Palamas in Thessaloniki.\n\nGreek Island Inspired Design\n\nThe Greek islands are known for their special architecture. More specifically, the ambassador of Greek island architecture is the Cyclades. The local Cycladic architecture has a special interest, highlighting beautiful houses, stone churches and paved town streets. The most characteristic feature of Cycladic architecture is the dominating blue and white colors, seen on all of the islands. These two colors are also used for churches; as the walls are painted white and the domes are blue. The houses in the Cyclades are a small, rectangular shape with a flat roof, as strong winds do not allow the construction of triangular roofs. They are built with stones and bricks and most of them have flowered yards or gardens.\n\nDue to the rich diversity throughout the centuries, the architectural styles are divided into several periods. You can see samples of all types of architecture in Greece with a simple walk through the center of Athens. A great example of modern architecture in Greece is the Grecotel Amirandes Exclusive Resort in Heraklion, Crete. It’s designed with basic, pure orthogonal geometrical shapes and also the use of large clean rectangular openings. In order to enhance the color white, which is the main color, materials such as concrete, wood and glass are strategically used. A very important part is the use of water. One of the first things you see when you enter the resort is the the tranquil lagoon waters that meet the sea which gives you the feeling of Eternal Blue! I definitely recommend you visit Greece and explore the local beauty through architecture, cultural heritage, food and the never-ending hospitality of the Greek people.\n\nΤα λέμε στην Ελλάδα (“SEE YOU IN GREECE!”)"
