        "text": "A solid roof over one's head is one of the prime requirements of a civilised existence, but permanent roofs are heavy and the struggle to support them is as old as civilisation itself. The essential problem is how to span the gap between the walls to leave a habitable space underneath. The simplest solution is laying horizontal beams across the gap between the walls supported where necessary by vertical pillars. ie a post and lintel construction. Classical Greek architecture - as exemplified by the Parthenon in Athens (completed in 438 BCE) and numerous other magnificent buildings throughout the Hellenic world - is rightly lauded for its elegant form, balanced proportions, pleasing symmetry and quality of construction. Nevertheless for all their beauty, classical Greek temples are, almost without exception, still essentially of simple post and lintel type of construction and so structurally are really not much more sophisticated than Stonehenge.\n\nSimple wooden lintels are generally limited by the length of available timber and also by the strength and flexibility of wood, and in classical Greece timber in suitable long lengths was already in short supply and also in great demand for ship-building. According to the Bible the massive wooden roof beams for King Solomon's enormous temple in Jerusalem were 17 cubits (about 7 metres) long and these he had specially imported from Lebanon, but of necessity many buildings in classical Greece had to make do with considerably shorter lengths of timber. Stone was readily available but simple stone beams or lintels, although suitably rigid, generally have poor tensile strength and so cannot in practice be used to span distances of more than about 2.5 metres, otherwise they are liable to crack under their own weight.\n\nAn internal view of the Parthenon.\n\nClose-up of the outer peristyle of the Parthenon. The central lintel in this image is cracked across (and repaired with a modern metal clamp) but it cannot fall as it is wedged by the heavy blocks on either side, but this would not be the case if the cracked block was on the end. The lintels of the peristyle are actually all composed of three separate blocks laid side-by-side (just about visible in this picture) in part to allow for a certain amount of cracking as well as being easier to handle during construction.\n\nThat is not to say that Greek buildings were necessarily small: the Parthenon's floor plan is bigger than many medieval cathedrals, while nearby at the foot of the Acropolis, Hadrian's temple of Olympian Zeus (a 2nd century Roman construction but in the same Greek style), at 108 by 52 metres, would fill most of Trafalgar Square. But to cover such an area with a roof did require the interior to be a veritable forest of closely-spaced massive columns (the columns in Hadrian's temple are each 1.9m in diameter, 17m high and spaced 5.4 m apart, leaving gaps of 3.5m between them). This mass of internal masonry was necessary to support the huge stone lintels, which in turn supported the wooden ceiling rafters, and finally on top of all that, the heavy, pitched timber-and-tile roof.\n\nThe fragmentary remains of Hadrian's enormous temple of Olympian Zeus with the acropolis and Parthenon in the background.\n\nArches do not suffer from the severe limitations of lintels and a simple masonry arch - and its related forms; the barrel vault and the circular dome - can readily span a gap of over 60m. Moreover an arch will still support its load even when the blocks themselves are cracked or indeed if the whole structure becomes deformed through shifting of the foundations.\n\nArches however are not generally a feature of classical Greek architecture and it appears that there is no archaeological or historical evidence of true arches in the Greek world that can be dated with certainty to a period earlier than the late fourth century BCE. However the true arch had been used extensively throughout Mesopotamia since at least 2100 BCE and it is hard to see how generations of Greek mercenaries, military engineers, merchants and other travellers had never encountered them, or at least not recognised them as a very effective way to span the gap between walls. For example ...\n\nThe brick arch entrance to the Edublalmahr Temple in ancient Ur (now in Iraq) was built c. 2100 BCE.\n\nA brick barrel-vaulted tomb in Haft Tepe in SW Iran c. 1500 BCE. This is actually constructed using the more sophisticated inclined brick technique where successive brick layers lean against those already in place, allowing it to be built without the need for any temporary support from below while the bricks are laid in place.\n\nThe splendid Ishtar Gate to the city of Babylon, completed circa 575 BCE and now located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin.\n\nThe Greeks of Mycenae used simple stone lintels but also extensively used corbelling; that is where the successive layers of stonework project out over the layers below so that with enough height the gap is eventually bridged. Using this method they built corbelled arches, vaults and even domes :\n\nThe corbelled vaults under the walls of Tiryns, which were already very old when Homer marvelled at them. They probably date from about 1800 BCE and despite the legends were almost certainly not built with the aid of the Cyclops.\n\nThe famous Lion Gate into the city of Mycenae dating from about 1500 BCE, with a post and lintel doorway and a corbelled 'arch' above the triangular bas relief, which serves to take much of the weight of the wall off the horizontal lintel.\n\nLintel and corbelled 'arch' doorway to the Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae - and the splendid corbelled 'beehive' dome of the interior, from 1250 BCE. The wide-angle lens for the interior photo is a bit misleading: in reality, as with all corbelled structures, the height of the roof is rather greater than the width of the enclosed space.\n\nThe true arch seems to have been first used in Greece when the barrel-vaulted tomb was introduced in Macedonia (in the late fourth century BCE) and it is certainly plausible to see this as being a direct consequence of military engineers and architects returning from Alexander the Great's campaigns in Mesopotamia. But did it really just need a few suitably-qualified militarty engineers and architects returning to Greece with memories of what they had seen and for the first time truely understood, from when they marched in triumph into Babylon through the arch of the Ishtar Gate.\n\nBarrel-vaulted tomb at Amphiopolis, northern Greece, currently dated to the last quarter of fourth century BCE.\n\nFrom these first tentative usages in Macedonia, the arch did then spread throughout the Hellenic world, but it still remained a relatively minor architectural form, until the Greek states were conquered by Rome and Roman architectural styles and practices became more prevalent.\n\nThe barrel-vaulted entrance tunnel to the stadium at Nemea, circa 340 BCE.\n\nThe greatly restored west parados arch to the theatre at Philippi, Greece circa 200BCE.\n\nAll that remains of the krypte, the vaulted official entrance tunnel to the stadium at Olympia, Southern Greece, late third century BCE.\n\nI find it difficult to accept that they simply did not know about arches, especially when they had successfully been using corbelling for centuries. So why did the ancient Greeks - generally no slouches in exploiting and developing new technologies - not use arches more often?\n\nWas it due to cultural reasons? Was the 'forest' of pillars in a temple seen to be reflecting the idea of the sacred grove perhaps? Or, somewhat like the House of the Vestals in Rome which, despite being rebuilt several times in ever more lavish stone, marble, tile and brick, was still always made to resemble the (supposed) original vestals' round thatched wooden hut. Or was it due to artistic esthetic reasons? Perhaps the four-square, post and lintel temple design was seen as reflecting in its relative proportions the 'perfection' of the geometric golden ratio ... or something like that?\n\nOr maybe it was simple xenophobia? Were arches seen as too 'exotic' or too 'alien' in a similar way that separate church bell towers rarely took off in Northern Europe as they were seen as suspiciously like the minaret of a mosque; while European medieval churches themselves usually remained cruciform, or at least rectangular, in shape, as circular churches were again thought too dangerously similar to mosques or synagogues.\n\nOr was it due to simple practicality, although I find it hard to envision what these practical reasons might have been? While construction of an arch or dome usually requires a lot of wooden scaffolding, the finished thing need not contain any timber at all: there's no wood in the construction of, for example, the magnificent dome of the Pantheon in Rome. Furthermore another problem with post and lintel designs is the difficulty of extracting flawless blocks of sufficient size for the lintels, and then transporting these large and heavy stones to the construction site. But an arch or dome does not require especially long blocks of stone. For example the large dome of the Byzantine basilica of Hagia Sophia in Istambul (completed 528 CE), or that of Brunelleschi's Rennaissance masterpiece, the dome of Florence cathedral (completed in 1432), were both constructed from thousands of relatively small, easily handled, bricks. Or to cite the Pantheon in Rome once again, most of that dome uses no solid blocks at all: it was poured into place as liquid concrete. But that is another matter entirely.\n\nOr is there another reason why the Greeks, for all their 'cleverness', failed to see the great potential uses of arches and so rarely, if ever, used them?\n\nLast edited by Meles meles on Wed 04 Sep 2019, 11:26; edited 9 times in total (Reason for editing : many pics requiring some resizing)\n\nMM,\n\n\"I find it difficult to accept that they simply did not know about arches, especially when they had successfully been using corbelling for centuries.

The primary factor was cultural. Similar to the Egyptians, the Greeks established a formal language for their architecture at a very early date and never deviated from its rules. Their architecture was of a trabeated type, composed of columns and beams, originally of timber and later translated into stone. Every element and detail of the Classical canon of architecture that the Greeks used in their monumental temples constructed of stone, such as the Parthenon, has a direct correlation to a timber component in their archaic domestic buildings. It was for cultural reasons that the Greeks chose not to use any structural system other than a trabeated system in their major civic and religious buildings. Their urban form, the polis, was the basis of Greek identity and defined a group as a distinct racial entity with an unbroken historical and mythic connection to the origins of their civilization. Likewise, their ancestral architectural form was the megaron, a small dwelling composed of a more or less cubic interior volume, with a colonnaded porch, both protected by a single gable roof. This was the archetypal building from which the Greeks derived the designs for all of their civic and religious structures. Even their grandest and most elaborate buildings were variations on the theme of the simple megaron. The Greek temple was foremost a symbol of the sanctuary, or shelter for a cult deity, a deity that protected and perpetuated the identity of a people. As a symbol for an immutable principle, its form could not change. Therefore, the entire architectural project of the Greek canon, extending over a millennium, was to only make incremental refinements to an established model. Furthermore, monumental Greek architecture was to be contemplated as sculpture in brilliant sunlight and in relation to its surrounding landscape; it was not dedicated to enclosing interior space. Therefore, the Greeks lacked an incentive to experiment with structural systems such as the arch, vault or dome that would have expanded or elaborated\"\n\nMM, and the Greeks saw it also as a estetic (spelling? Dutch:esthetisch. French: esthétique) eye catcher. I made here on the board a thread about the bullding of the Parthenon, with the colums deformed from the bottom to the top, so that the eye would see the colums parallel to each other, while if they were of the same thickness on their whole length, the eye wouldn't them see as parallel.\n\nKind regards from Paul.\n\nHanlon's article is interesting, Paul. Thanks for the link.\n\nHe makes two statements within it which are both correct, though for some reason he chooses not to link them. One, that the Greeks for a thousand years or so never really experimented much once they had hit upon a dependable method of supporting large structures using cut stone, is certainly true and automatically includes a failure to experiment therefore with arch construction. Secondly, he cites their reticence to employ bricks and the poor quality of Greek brickwork that has survived. This is also true.\n\nBut then a third thing he says, and presents without any attempt to explain, is that the Greeks were certainly aware from contact with Eastern cultures not only how to make good arches but also how to make them using better bricks than the sun-dried variety they commonly used.\n\nI actually think this reticence to industrialise brickwork or take the technique further is probably key to understanding therefore why a disinterest in arches also occurred within dominant architectural styles in any culture, including the Greek. I've been looking at soil distribution maps throughout Greece and Anatolia and what strikes one immediately is the almost complete absence of vertisols in the entire region. These are soil groups that contain very high clay or loamy content and are by far the best brick material as the sintering process (chemical bonding of the active components with the silty content to make a strong cohesive mass) requires less heat to achieve. In other words sun-drying alone is sufficient to create a very strong brick. If you compare this distribution with that which pertains in areas of great alluvial deposit, flood plains, and areas with more regular intervals between saturation and de-saturation, then you can see immediately just how lacking the Greeks were in obtaining this material when compared with other areas, such as almost the whole of the Mesopotamian fertile zone, or even the plains of North Italy for that matter.\n\nTo get around this deficiency the solution is to use soil with less clay content but fired to a higher temperature, but even then a clay content below 50% is pretty useless and further processes are required to achieve consistency of materials in the right proportions (ie. suddenly it becomes much more labour intensive an operation). If you download the map linked below you can see that even when it came to these lesser quality materials the Greeks didn't have access to very much at all within their own cultural area, or at least the land area in which their culture originated and thrived most (the soils with the deepest purple/red being indicative of such clay content). So, even if they understood the theory (and we know they did), they simply did not have any economical method of obtaining the resources required, or at least certainly not on the larger industrial scale that has to be employed once one has to artificially recreate the sun-drying of high clay content soil using vast quantities of inferior material (\"extrusion\" being a principal element of the process in which the inferior material is industrially removed to a point where a good enough ratio to allow sintering to occur remains).\n\nThose who did develop and use bricks on industrial scales seemed to have started out with an ample supply of the \"good stuff\", enough certainly to encourage experimentation using the material as a load bearing element of design. Then, once they had incorporated a dependency on this architectural style in their culture, the same people had access to enough second grade material, along with a huge financial incentive, to then concentrate on refining kiln firing processes and expanding the industry in terms of labour to meet their own demands.\n\nThe Greeks had none of this at home, and their expansion abroad in terms of government and area, even when it included access to loamy soils that might have kick-started this cultural development, was never one best suited to the level of exploitation of local labour and material required. Maybe, with an expansion model more on Roman lines, and given a little more time, they might have got there. But otherwise they seemed resigned to operating within functional parameters set by both their geographical location and geopolitical model of federation and colonisation, a model that wasn't especially conducive to either cooperation or coercion enough to exploit resources at the levels required. Had Alexander's conquests retained even a little homogeneity for a period long enough, for example, maybe this might have been such a catalyst for change. However Alexander was by far an exception to the usual Greek expansion model and, with such a cultural norm established, then the incentive just wasn't there to invest effort or expense enough to make them into an overly experimental society when it came to architecture, especially since they had long ago arrived at a style and method that worked more than reasonably well anyway. In fact given their otherwise fantastic record in both absorbing new knowledge from without and experimenting just for the fun of it in almost every other respect, then I am even more convinced that the root of the matter when it comes to both bricks and arches boils down to access to material. In their place, and in the time they were at their most powerful and influential as a dominant culture, the elements required to start an architectural revolution based on innovation using materials to hand just didn't exist.\n\nHere's a link to the soil map - it takes ages to download on my machine, but if you can manage it it's interesting.\n\nGreece soil distribution\n\nnordmann,\n\nI think it was this sentence in the Hanlon text, which sparked your comments?\n\n\"The arch and the vault had been used in Western Asia for many centuries prior to the Greeks arrival, but these examples were composed of brick, a material in which the Greeks showed little interest [Lawrence 1983, 170]. \"\n\nBut then when I read it this morning I wanted already say that the Greeks didn't need bricks, if the wanted to build arches. They could it do with limestone, which was available overthere. I saw I think even blue stone cut in the documentary about the Guédelon project. Constructing a medieval castle with the comtemporaneous methods.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5gFm6_1FkM\n\nAns yes Priscilla seems to have the same opinion;\n\n\"On the other hand some rock appears to be easy to chip into keystone and arch building shape. I saw this in 18th Cent Raj houses in the subcontinent. When being demolished for high rises the sandsstone arches used quite extensively for shaded verandahs and doorways was left till last to be more carefully removed for reuse. Marble obviously chips away quite easily (well for some, in my art training days all the rocks I used needed muscle....and talent).\n\nYou think material and I think mindset i.e. that they liked the linear design, it conformed and brought unity throughout their home and colonial expansion and the proportions pleased the eye and agreed with the setting -often on raised ground. Making bricks needs fuel and that the Greeks did not have with huge forests to hand.\"\n\nI think Hanlon has a point, when he said the Greeks stuck to their old style of building for traditional? religious? reasons.\n\nDigged a bit everywhere, not exactly to get confirmation of that theory, but more to seek if the materials available, as limestone, marble were easy to cut, saw...\n\nhttps://www.ancieanalysis_of_important_themes_in_greek_architec/ntgreece.com/essay/v/\n\nhttp://learnmore.ancienttemple.gr/constructing-the-temple/?lang=en\n\n[size=50]T[/size]\n\nhe early Archaic temples were of rather makeshift construction. The walls were of mud bricks and only the lower sections (socle) were built of small stones. The first columns were wooden.The roof, always gabled, was also of timber. The tiles were of fired clay (terracotta), as were the various decorative elements that completed or protected the timber or mud-brick constructions.\n\nFrom 620 BC, however, the use of ashlar blocks in Greek temple architecture began. During the sixth century BC this became generalized, with the resultant abandonment of timber and mud brick as building materials, at least for the most important monuments.\n\nIt has been ascertained that the architectural features established in the wooden temples of the previous period were transferred to stone, in both orders. Morphological analysis, particularly of the Doric order, shows that the entire building was close to its timber precursors and models. Even details were reproduced in stone, such as the nails used to join the wooden members together. Thus, in Greek temples we have, as it were, a ‘petrified timber structure’. This conservatism of the Greek architects is interpreted as confidence in forms that had acquired aesthetic value after many years of development.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashlar\n\n\"Thus, in Greek temples we have, as it were, a \"petrified timber structure. This conservatism of Greek architects is interpreted as confidence in forms that had acquired aesthetic value after many years of development.\n\nKind regards from Paul.\n\nnordmann wrote:\n\nIf you can convince me that quarried limestone (or quarried any stone) matched brick made cheaply from abundant sources elsewhere in terms of economy and general availability, and therefore could have facilitated that critical level of application in sufficient instances within the Greek culture to emulate what developed elsewhere regarding evolving methods of structure and design, then I'll agree with you that they seem to have missed a trick. But I'm more prepared to take the simple evidence of what we know happened in all these places, the materials each had to play with, and the relative costs to each culture of the construction they engaged in using those resources most readily available (all construction, not just that on a grand scale) as sufficient reason to assume that it was very much more practical circumstances that dictated the aesthetic involved and not the other way round.\n\nnordmann,\n\nthere you can have a point. I spent my evening by searching again to my hobbyhorse about the reintroduction of the brick in Northern and Central Europe in the 12th century...\n\nAnd yes it were just these countries, which had perhaps the neccessary clay layers, especially at the coast as in the Flemish Plain along the Channel. And they had the wood. First letting the clay bricks drying in the sun and later fire them in a kiln. (in the childhood i had a closed kiln as neighbour and an open one some hundreds meter further).\n\nThere is still no firm evidence that the Cisterians reintroduced the bricks and the kilns again after some 4 centuries of wood and natural stone constructions.\n\nI will make a new thread about it, as there is news about more sophisticated methods as luminisence to date bricks if they are reused Roman bricks or new ones from new kilns.\n\nI put here the entries to later use them in the new thread:\n\nhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/85086.pdf\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/296865148_Brick_Production_and_Brick_Building_in_Medieval_Flanders\n\nhttps://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/190364\n\nThat said nordmann and I think it was that too that you wanted to emphasize (?), first you need the material to make bricks, but that is not enough, you need also the knowledge to do the work and have the organisation to do it on some industrial scale?\n\nAnd it is there, that, although there is controversy about some intermediary brick making as in Saxon England, only the Cisterians started kilns on an industrial scale and organised the whole processus from clay to brick and only then that in my opinion the real start came from the Brick Gothic\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Gothic\n\nFor instance:\n\nEven the Westhoek region in the very north of France, situated between Belgium and the Strait of Dover participates in northern Brick Gothic, with a high density of specific buildings. For example, there is an amazing similarity between the belfry of Dunkerque (FR) and the tower of St Mary's church in Gdańsk.\n\nand the\n\nChurch of Our Lady in Bruges and that of Saint Salvator also in Bruges.\n\nWhat I meant, although the clay and the wood was available for making bricks, the technology and the will had to be present to start this new cultural design?\n\nAnd yes where these materials were not present in abondance, they still stuck to the natural and other material to build their cathedrals?\n\nhttps://www.abelard.org/france/stone-in-church-and-cathedral-construction.php\n\nnordmann, or was it this that you wanted to explain?\n\nKind regards from Paul.\n\nWell, you're addressing the challenge society faced when it already had access to the knowledge required not only to use brick but also how to use it in adventurously practical ways, but was lacking either access to the materials involved or the social infrastructure required to exploit that knowledge on a grand scale. Until a means of re-introducing this market demand could be found then the industry, the expertise required to exploit the market, and by inference local development of this expertise could not be re-introduced either.\n\nIreland actually represents a very good example of this - even more profoundly than mainland Europe in that there is a common but incorrect belief that Ireland had always lacked both the knowledge and the incentive to acquire this knowledge or to generate a brick-making industry right up to Norman times or later, and it is certainly true that pre-Norman society did not use bricks as standard building material. The belief then is that when brick-making was introduced it was therefore completely new, as were the market forces of supply and demand to sustain this industry as defined by Norman society. The picture is therefore of a local community happily sitting in brick-making ignorance and requiring a huge social upheaval and imposition of standards, methods and styles by an invading elite before it even grasped the concept of bricks at all.\n\nHowever there are two instances which contradict this perception and which show that Ireland in fact was in the same boat as much of the rest of Europe in the first millennium CE but just to a more pronounced degree - one being a Roman villa/trading post/military base complex that has been excavated in North County Dublin in recent years. Despite contradicting the notion that \"the Romans\" never reached Hibernia, the excavation has revealed a settled community existing for at least a century and probably longer in which all the building techniques one would normally associate with that period of Roman architecture is evident, including some very well made bricks. The clay used was of a good quality for firing, but was not sourced locally, the best guess being that it came from near the Boyne Valley, about 50km distant. This suggests an infrastructure and local economy which hitherto had been presumed to be alien to Ireland at the time, the know-how for both probably also introduced by the same Romans, which at least briefly provided the market, means and incentive to run a brick-making industry. Small by European standards elsewhere under Roman occupation, but nevertheless there.\n\nThe second instance is even more intriguing, in that one could be forgiven for assuming (as many historians did) that this nascent industry died a death once whatever the Romans were up to in the area also died out. However in the thousand years between then and the Normans there is more than enough evidence at this stage to indicate that the industry continued, this time completely within the ambit of religious orders, who not only employed well made bricks but obviously sponsored brief flourishing of that industry in various localities at different times. In other words a limited market continued to exist that exploited knowledge first introduced by the Romans, but which never reached a size that led to imposition of whatever architectural styles the material facilitated into secular society. This correlates completely with what we know about Gaelic society's attitude to local settlement - the economy did not depend on villages and towns, or even great masonry projects for the elites, so that wider market simply could never exist. However in fits and starts the techniques survived, and innovations developed locally and elsewhere were utilised by that limited market throughout this time.\n\nWhat I was addressing however wasn't so much how, when and to what extent brick-making and construction with this material existed within any society, but to what extent it has to exist before it kick-starts architectural innovation to a point where structures like arches not only become a prominent feature of a local architectural style, but also a point where local manufacturers and builders can unilaterally develop and refine these techniques further. This became easier to achieve as time went on and knowledge was disseminated throughout the European continent with some rapidity, but when one goes right back to those early European societies embarking on the continent's first great experiments in solid structures on a huge scale then even more of these factors have to coalesce in one spot before a common dependency on the product generates a market large enough to sustain both the industrial process and the innovation process this engenders. Greece, I reckon, definitely falls into this category, and one result of this therefore was a lack of access to dependable bricks on the scale required to experiment and develop radically new architectural concepts compared to those which already prevailed using more accessible materials and which worked reasonably well for the purpose intended.\n\nAnd, as Priscilla has noted several times, when this existing style was done well it looked well too, so good in fact that it still persists as a pleasing aesthetic to this day, even though the necessities that engendered it have long been met using more advanced and often more practical means. Greece wouldn't be the last society either to doggedly stick with a predominant architectural style even when feasible alternatives presented themselves for consideration. In fact I reckon that right up to the very recent modern age this was the norm rather than the exception within European society (and probably elsewhere too - I am less familiar with the development of architectural styles and their adoption in Asia, for example, but I imagine the same economic, material and social parameters applied wherever communal societies developed)."
