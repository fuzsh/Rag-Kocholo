        "text": "I’m thrilled to share with you one of the most magnificent and historically significant monuments in Athens, Greece – the Arch of Hadrian. As we delve into its history, beauty, and the stories it holds, I’m sure you’ll feel the irresistible urge to witness this stunning marvel in person.\n\nImagine standing before a structure that has withstood the test of time, a testament to the ingenuity and artistry of a bygone era. The Arch of Hadrian, also known as Hadrian’s Gate, is an architectural gem dating back to 131 AD. It lies at the heart of Athens, just four minute’s walk from the Acropolis Museum, Ioannis Makriyiannis Statue, and the Temple of Olympian Zeus, making it an essential stop for anyone visiting this incredible city.\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian stands tall at approximately 18 meters (60 feet) and is made of Pentelic marble, the very same used in the construction of the iconic Parthenon. Now, who built this stunning piece of history, you might ask? The arch was constructed in honour of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who had a great fondness for Athens and contributed significantly to the city’s development. The Athenians, in return, held him in high regard, and as such, they built this magnificent structure to celebrate his generosity and influence.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of the Arch of Hadrian is the ongoing debate about whether it’s an arch or a gateway. You see, while it may resemble a Roman triumphal arch, it lacks the typical three openings found in such structures. Instead, it has only one central opening, leading some historians to believe it was originally intended as a gateway. But, regardless of its classification, the Arch of Hadrian serves as a powerful symbol of the blending of Greek and Roman cultures.\n\nAs you stand beneath the arch, gazing up at its intricate design and craftsmanship, you’ll discover two inscriptions etched just above the peak on opposite sides. These inscriptions pay homage to both Hadrian and Theseus, the mythical founder of Athens. On one side, the inscription reads: “This is the city of Hadrian and not of Theseus,” while on the other side, it states: “This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus.” This dual recognition highlights the importance of both figures in the city’s history and gives you a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Athens.\n\nSo why should you visit the Arch of Hadrian? Besides its undeniable historical and architectural significance, it’s completely free and open 24 hours daily. It also offers a unique opportunity to connect with a rich and storied past. As you walk beneath its towering presence, you can almost hear the whispers of ancient Athenians and Romans who once stood where you now stand. It’s a reminder of the enduring legacy of human ingenuity, creativity, and our innate desire to honour those who have shaped our world.\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian is more than just a monument; it’s a gateway to a deeper understanding of the entwined histories of Greece and Rome. As you explore its majestic beauty, you’ll find yourself immersed in a world that has long since vanished yet continues to captivate the hearts and minds of those who encounter it.\n\nSo, dear traveller, the next time you find yourself wandering the streets of Athens, I urge you to pay a visit to the Arch of Hadrian. Lose yourself in its grandeur, soak in its history, and let the stories of Hadrian and Theseus inspire your journey through this ancient city.\n\nCapturing the perfect photos and videos of the Arch of Hadrian is all about finding the right angles and utilizing Athens’s stunning backdrop. Here are my tips for the taking the best photos, videos and the perfect Instagram of the Arch of Hadrian:\n\nDirectly in front of the Arch\n\nStand directly in front of the Arch of Hadrian to capture its full grandeur, with its Corinthian columns and detailed inscriptions in the frame. This classic shot will showcase the monument in all its glory.\n\nFrom the side\n\nCapture the arch from one of its sides, highlighting its depth and intricate design. This angle will also give you a sense of scale as the arch towers above you.\n\nDiagonal perspective\n\nPosition yourself at a diagonal angle to the arch, allowing you to capture both its height and width in one stunning shot. This perspective offers a unique view that emphasizes the arch’s imposing presence.\n\nArch with the Acropolis\n\nTo include the majestic Acropolis in the background, stand at a distance from the Arch of Hadrian, where both monuments are visible in your frame. This shot will showcase the connection between these two iconic landmarks and provide a beautiful representation of Athens’ historical landscape.\n\nTemple of Olympian Zeus\n\nCapture the Arch of Hadrian with the towering columns of the nearby Temple of Olympian Zeus in the background. This juxtaposition of two ancient structures will create a visually striking image that highlights the rich history of Athens.\n\nNight-time shots\n\nVisit the Arch of Hadrian in the evening when it’s illuminated by soft, warm lighting. This will add a magical and dramatic atmosphere to your photos, making them stand out on your Instagram feed.\n\nCandid moments\n\nDon’t forget to include yourself or your travel companions in some of the shots!
