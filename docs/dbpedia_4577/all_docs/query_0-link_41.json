        "text": "What I can see\n\nHadrian’s Gate is a triumphal arch built by the Athenians in honour of the Roman emperor Hadrian. It is built with Pentelic marble, decorated with columns of corinthian order and had a height of 18 metres and a width of 13 metres. It is still in good condition as it was part of the Ottoman city wall, which has a surviving section further to the south, along Amalias Avenue. The building is divided into two parts: the lower part is shaped like a Roman honorary arch, while the upper part is inspired by the traditional Greek portico. On both sides of the arch, two inscriptions are barely discernible. On the west side we read “this is Athens, the old city of Theseus”; on the east, “this is the city of Hadrian, not Theseus”. The two signs separate the old town from the new.\n\nWhat I can't see\n\nThe affection between the Athenians and Emperor Hadrian was mutual. Hadrian was a great benefactor of the city and the Athenians honoured him, not only by constructing buildings and statues in his honour, but also by deifying him. This gate is built on the road that led from the Temple of Olympian Zeus to the eastern end of the Acropolis.\n\nInfo\n\nAddress: Amalias Avenue\n\nBibliography"
