        "text": "This article provides a study of Hadrian arches from three main locations: Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. Collectively within these countries, four arches have been found the Hadrian arch at Jerash (Gerasa) in Jordan, the Hadrian arch in Antalya and Ephesus, both in Turkey, and the Hadrian arch in Athens, Greece. The units of our analysis include all the different designs and plans used in constructing these arches. The analyzed design and planning units constitute a database that enables the identification of similarities and differences between these four arches. The study included is descriptions of the arches, which are then compared with one another. although many can be found from the time of the Roman Emperors in the Eastern and Western Roman Provinces. it is generally considered that the Hadrian Period is one of the more important Roman periods, something evident through that period's architectural elements and decorations. Though we only find the Hadrian's Arches at four locations, there are many locations where we can find such Hadrian building as baths or theaters, and others coming from the time of this emperor's reign. This article has examined the architectural elements and decorations found on the Hadrian's Arches, as well as other buildings dating from the Roman period, both in the Near East and elsewhere.\n\nThe syncretism typical for the Romans was thus reflected also in architecture. One of the diverse architectural elements applied was a so-called Syrian arch. A typical feature of buildings with the Syrian arch is the distinctive arrangement of the entablature, which unlike in the Classical Greco-Roman architecture does not travel horizontally along the entire circumference of the structure, but in some places – most often in the middle of a building’s façade – bends up in an arch form. Formally, it is important to differentiate between the ways in which the arch was connected to the architrave. Based on this distinction, the structures can be divided into two basic groups: first, structures with the entablature itself curving up into an arch without interruption (the so-called arcuated lintel), and second, structures with an arch “separated” from the entablature, resting on the top of the entablature (sometimes referred to as serliana). Both groups occur concurrently in the same time period. The basic differences between them can be demonstrated on two monuments from Asia Minor: so-called Temple of Hadrian in Ephesus and the Tetrapylon in phrodisias. The arch, either as an individual feature or as part of a pediment, exemplifies the adoption of foreign elements by Roman architecture. At first sight it seems to have been used as a decorative element, but a more thorough research into its occurrence clearly shows that it is mainly found in religious buildings and has a symbolic value. The finds from late antiquity clearly show that this element was in all its forms incorporated into the early Christian architecture, and became its inseparable part."
