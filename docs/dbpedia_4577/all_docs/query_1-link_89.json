Thanks for your support!\n\nThe Best Athens Itinerary - How Long Will You Really Need?\n\nI fell in love with Athens, Greece, just moments after arriving on my solo Greece trip. Before making my trip, I wondered how many days in Athens I would need to properly see all the highlights. A lot of guides recommended spending only one day in Athens before jetting off to one of the Greek islands like beautiful Rhodes, Mykonos, Naxos, or Crete. But I can promise you, you’ll want to spend as much time here as possible before doing some solo Greek Island hopping. The city is stunningly beautiful, very welcoming, and has plenty to offer. Need proof? Just check out these gorgeous pictures that will convince you to visit Athens, Greece.\n\nI hope my Athens 3-day itinerary has you falling in love with this beautiful city as much as I did. That said, you could easily spend more than three days in Athens. While it’s possible to visit all the highlights and enjoy some incredible Greek food in just 3 days, you’ll get a far better understanding of the city, the culture, and the people if you have more than just 3 days in Athens. You’ll also be able to see all the famous Athens landmarks… and there are a lot! But as I know travel can be expensive and not everyone has a week or more to spend in one location, so I’m here to offer you the very best accessible itinerary for Athens in 3 days.\n\nHow to Get Around Athens\n\nThanks to recent renovations, Athens' entire public transportation is wheelchair accessible. I took the metro during my stay and found it quite easy to get around the city. In fact, you can easily take the metro from Athens International Airport to your hotel and avoid the price of a taxi.\n\nYou might also opt to purchase tickets for one of Athens’ hop-on hop-off buses during your stay. In fact, I encourage it. All Athens sightseeing buses have a dedicated area large enough to accommodate any type of wheelchair. If you purchase a 2-day pass it will take you to most of the city’s major sites.\n\nWhat To Pack for Athens\n\nIf you’re wondering what to pack for your Greece Trip It will depend on where your itinerary takes you. I always air on the side of packing light. Remember, you’re visiting a thriving metropolis with tons of great shopping, so you’ll want to leave some room in your suitcase for those great Greek souvenirs. Just make sure you bring comfortable walking shoes and pack all of your medicines, essential items, and a spare change of clothes in your carry on. I always like to pack a change of clothes in my carry on in case the airline loses my luggage.\n\nWhere to Stay In Athens\n\nDuring my stay in Athens, I stayed at the Divani Palace Acropolis Hotel. The Divani is a 5-star hotel located conveniently blocks from the Acropolis museum with breathtaking views of the Acropolis. For just $190/ night I got a superior room with an Acropolis view and balcony. Since I was visiting for New Year’s Eve, it was the perfect way to watch the fireworks over the Acropolis and ring in the new year.\n\nThe Divani offers wheelchair-accessible rooms and common areas. They also offer wheelchairs for rent onsite.\n\nI plan on making a future post with more suggestions on where to stay in Athens. But rest assured, there are tons of affordable, accessible, and beautiful hotels within the city.\n\nAthens 3-Day Itinerary\n\nDay One\n\nAcropolis\n\nAcropolis Museum\n\nTemple of The Olympian Zeus\n\nMonastiraki Square\n\nDinner in the Plaka\n\nDay Two\n\nStreet Art Tour\n\nNational Archaeological Museum\n\nDay Three\n\nHop-On Hop-Off City Tour including:\n\nHadrian’s Arch\n\nSyntagma Square Athens\n\nGreek Parliament\n\nErmou Street\n\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nRoyal Palace and the changing of the guard\n\nPanathenaic Stadium\n\nSunset Tour to The Temple of Poseidon\n\nDay One\n\nDay one of our 3 day Athens Itinerary kicks off with the Acropolis. Because let’s face it, it’s probably what you came all this way to see, especially you first-time visitors to Athens. It’s the most famous landmark in Athens and is filled with important Greek history.\n\nGreece was once home to 2 of the original 7 wonders of the world, the Colossus of Rhodes and the Statue of Zeus. Sadly, only one of the original wonders of the world exists today and you’ll have to visit Egypt to see it. But you can still get a great idea of ancient history by visiting the Acropolis.\n\nAfter we finish seeing the Acropolis, we’ll pop over to the Acropolis Museum and Temple of the Olympian Zeus. From there we’ll head over to the popular Monastiraki Square before having dinner in the popular Plaka district.\n\nThe Acropolis\n\nThe ancient Greek Acropolis of Athens is a fortified center of town located atop a rocky hill. But don’t worry, it’s wheelchair accessible. If you have mobility issues, walk to the back of the Acropolis where you can be escorted up in a golf cart to the top of the hill. From there, an elevator can take you to the top of the Acropolis for views of the Parthenon and other ruins. If you decide to brave the walk, know that not only is it a steep hill, but the walkway is also made of uneven stones. Not knowing about the accessible back entrance, I walked up the hill, which took me about an hour and had me biting my nails, worried I would roll an ankle. I saw several other visitors walking up with canes. I can only assume this is due to the poor signage and lack of information about the newly constructed accessible route. Of course, it’s always great to get advice on visiting the Acropolis from an Athens resident.\n\nThe Acropolis is actually a collection of ancient buildings, the most famous of which are the Parthenon, Propylaea, the Erechtheion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. During ancient times the Acropolis was known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent man. There is evidence the hill was populated as far back as the fourth millennium BC. However, the remains of the structures you see now were constructed in the fifth century BC during the height of ancient Athens.\n\nTo see the Acropolis, I recommend this skip-the-line Acropolis tour.\n\nThe collection spans from the seventh century BC to the second century BC. Highlights include the original Caryatids from the Erechtheion, the fifth-century-BC relief of Mourning Athena, the sixth-century-BC Moschophoros statue of a young man carrying a small calf, and the series of reliefs from the Temple of Athena.\n\nThe Acropolis Museum charges a separate entrance fee and is not part of the admission to the Acropolis. Acropolis Museum tickets start at 12 Euros. If you want to see both the Acropolis and Acropolis Museum I recommend this combination skip-the-line Acropolis and Acropolis Museum Tour.\n\nLocation: 15 Dionysiou Areopagitou Street, Athens\n\nIf you’d like to grab lunch there are a number of great restaurants across from the museum. My favorite is God’s Restaurant. I ate here twice during my stay in Athens because the food was out of this world good. For more restaurant suggestions check out my Food Guide to Athens.\n\nTemple of The Olympian Zeus\n\nIf you haven’t gotten your fill of looking at ancient ruins, you can head over to the Temple of The Olympian Zeus. A five-minute walk from the Acropolis Museum, the Temple is a former colossal temple in the center of Athens. Dedicated to Zeus, the head of the Greek Gods, construction began in the 6th century BC. However construction was not completed until the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian in the 2nd century AD, some 638 later. Proving even in BC times, contractors were just the worst.\n\nIt was once the largest temple in Greece, featuring 104 colossal columns. Sadly, all that work was for naught as the temple was quickly pillaged by barbarians in 267 AD just a century shy of its being finished.\n\nYou can easily view the temple from the surrounding sidewalks, making it wheelchair accessible.\n\nLocation: Athens 105 57, Greece\n\nFrom here it’s a 14-minute walk to our next stop, Monastiraki Square.\n\nMonastiraki Square\n\nMonastiraki Square, Greek for “the little monastery,” is a popular neighborhood with tons of great shops. The Monastiraki area is famous for great bargains on things like clothing, fantastic Greek gifts and souvenirs. The area is named for the Church of the Pantanassa which is located within the square. The main streets to hit up are Pandrossou Street and Adrianou Street. While most days the area can best be described as a grand bazaar a la Istanbul’s grand bazaar, the proper Monastiraki flea market takes place on Sundays.\n\nIf you’re not into shopping it’s still worth checking out this neighborhood for the people-watching, as well as the church of Pantanassa, Hadrian’s Library, and the Tsisdarakis Mosque. (The big domed building pictured above.)\n\nIf you choose not to walk from the Acropolis Museum, Monastiraki Square is conveniently located right next to The Monastiraki Metro Station, serving both Line 1 and Line 3 of the Athens Metro.\n\nLocation: Agias Eleousis 3, Athens 105 55, Greece.\n\nStreet Art Tour\n\nIf you’ve been reading my blog for a while, you’ll know I love street art, having published guides to street art in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. I was excited to check out Athens’ street art scene which is world-renowned.\n\nI know a lot of people like to explore on their own and skip formal tours, but I swear to you this is the best tour I have ever been on and it’s an absolute must for your time in Athens. This 3-hour Street Art walking tour will take you through some of Athens' less touristy neighborhoods. It will also give you a better understanding of recent Greek history and politics. You’ll see some of the best murals and street art in Greece with a local street artist as your guide. And don’t worry, they keep it to a small group and we took plenty of breaks on our walk to use the restroom and grab some coffee.\n\nDay Three\n\nDay 3 of our 3-day Athens itinerary involves getting tickets to the Athens Hop-On Hop-Off tour bus. It’s a great way to see the city without having to pay for expensive cabs or doing a ton of walking while visiting Athens. The Hop-On Hop-Off bus stops at all the best Athens attractions and gives you time to hop off and further explore, or simply snap photos from the comfort of the air-conditioned bus.\n\nIn the afternoon we’ll take a day trip and ride along the Athens coast to the beautiful Temple of Poseidon to watch the sun set over the Agean. You can purchase a combination ticket for both trips making the price a bit cheaper.\n\nHop-On Hop-Off Sightseeing\n\nStart your day at the Acropolis station where you’ll catch the orange line, taking you through some of the top attractions in the Athenian historic center.\n\nSunset Tour of Cape Sounion\n\nThe Sunset Tour departs at 2 pm and takes you for a beautiful guided ride through Athen’s Riviera. See the stunning Athenian beaches and beautiful homes as you make your way to Cape Sounion.\n\nCape Sounion lies on the southernmost tip of the Attic peninsula, 43 miles south of Athens. It’s most famous for the Temple of Poseidon, one of the major monuments of the Golden Age of Athens. The remains of the temple are perched at the top of the hill, surrounded on three sides by the Aegean sea.\n\nAdmission to the Temple of Poseidon is not included in your ticket price. Admission is 10 Euros. There is a paved hill leading up to the Temple, though this may be a somewhat difficult climb for those with mobility issues.\n\nEven if you don’t make the climb, there’s a small museum at the base as well as a cafe and seating to watch the sunset over the Agean."
