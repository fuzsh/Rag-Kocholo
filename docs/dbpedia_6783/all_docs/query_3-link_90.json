        "text": "Geography\n\nGeographic overview\n\nThe surface of the Earth is approximately 70.9% water and 29.1% land. The former portion constitutes the World Ocean, the single largest feature of the planet and one that connects all places on the globe. The World Ocean is divided by the intervening continental landmasses into five major ocean basins, which are (in decreasing order of size) the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern, and Arctic. The World Factbook describes each of these five as oceans. Given the significant differences in direction and temperature of major ocean currents, as well as the effects of the major air masses above them, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are generally divided at the equator into the North and South Pacific Oceans and the North and South Atlantic Oceans, thus creating seven major water bodies -- the so-called \"Seven Seas.\"\n\nAbout 97.5% of the Earth's water is saltwater. Of the 2.5% that is fresh, about two-thirds is frozen, mostly locked up in the Antarctic ice sheets and mountain glaciers worldwide. If all the surface ice on earth fully melted, the sea level would rise about 70 m (230 ft).\n\nIn a 100-year period, a water molecule spends 98 years in the ocean, 20 months as ice, about two weeks in lakes and rivers, and less than a week in the atmosphere. Groundwater can take 50 years to just traverse 1 km (0.6 mi).\n\nEarth's land portion is divided into several large, discrete landmasses called continents. Depending on the convention used, the number of continents can vary from five to seven. The most common classification recognizes seven, which are (from largest to smallest) Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia and Europe are sometimes lumped together into a Eurasian continent, resulting in six continents. Alternately, North and South America are sometimes grouped as simply the Americas, resulting in a continent total of six (or five, if the Eurasia designation is used).\n\nNorth America is commonly understood to include Greenland and the Caribbean islands and to extend south to the Isthmus of Panama. The Ural Mountains and the Ural River are usually considered the easternmost part of Europe, the Caspian Sea is the limit to the southeast, and the Caucasus Mountains, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean to the south. Portions of five countries -- Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey -- fall within both Europe and Asia, but in every instance the larger section is in Asia. These countries are considered part of both continents. Armenia and Cyprus, which lie completely in Western Asia, are geopolitically European countries.\n\nAsia usually incorporates all the islands of the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Pacific islands are often lumped with Australia into a \"land mass\" termed Oceania or Australasia. Africa's northeast extremity is frequently delimited at the Isthmus of Suez, but for geopolitical purposes, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula is often included as part of Africa.\n\nAlthough the above groupings are the most common, different continental dispositions are recognized or taught in certain parts of the world, with some more heavily based on cultural spheres than physical geographic considerations.\n\nBased on the seven-continent model, and grouping islands with adjacent continents, Africa has the most countries with 54. Europe contains 49 countries and Asia 48, but these two continents share five countries: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey. North America consists of 23 sovereign states, Oceania has 16, and South America 12. In total, the United States recognizes 197 countries.\n\ncountries by continent: Africa (54): Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\nEurope (49): Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan*, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia*, Germany, Greece, Holy See (Vatican City), Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan*, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia*, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey*, Ukraine, United Kingdom (* indicates part of the country is also in Asia)\n\nAsia (48): Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan*, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, China, Cyprus, Georgia*, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan*, North Korea, South Korea, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Russia*, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Turkey*, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Yemen (* indicates part of the country is also in Europe)\n\nNorth America (23): Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, United States\n\nOceania (16): Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu\n\nSouth America (12): Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela\n\nThree of the states described above â France, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom â consist of smaller political entities that are referred to as countries. France considers French Polynesia an overseas country; the Kingdom of the Netherlands refers to all four of its constituent parts (Netherlands [proper], and the islands of Aruba, Curacao, and Sint Maarten) as countries; and the United Kingdom is composed of the countries of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. While not recognized as sovereign states, The World Factbook does include descriptive entries for the French and Dutch island \"countries.\"\n\nthe World from space: Earth is the only planet in the solar system to have water in its three states of matter: liquid (oceans, lakes, and rivers), solid (ice), and gas (water vapor in clouds). From a distance, Earth would be the brightest of the eight planets in the solar system; this luminous effect would be because of the sunlight reflected by the planet's water.\n\nEarth is also the only planet in the solar system known to be active with earthquakes and volcanoes due to plate tectonics; these events form the landscape, replenish carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and erase impact craters caused by meteors.\n\nEarth has a slight equatorial bulge -- a difference between its equatorial and polar diameters -- because of the centrifugal force from the planet rotating on its axis. The equatorial diameter is 12,756 km, but the polar diameter is 12,714 km; this results in the Earth's circumference at the equator being 40,075 km, while the polar circumference is 40,008 km.\n\nthe physical World: the Earth is composed of three layers: the outer lithosphere (with its crust and uppermost solid mantle), the mantle (the thickest layer, with distinct upper and lower layers), and the core (with an outer liquid core and inner solid core). Researchers have discovered that a transition zone (at a depth of 410-660 km, or 255-410 mi) between the upper and lower mantle may well be hydrous (water-bearing). But this hydrous rock would neither feel wet nor drip water. At that depth, high temperatures and pressures structurally transform a mineral called olivine into another mineral, ringwoodite, which can incorporate water, but not in a liquid, solid, or gas form. The high temperatures and pressures cause: 1) water molecules to split, creating hydroxide ions (hydrogen and oxygen atoms bound together), and 2) create structural changes in ringwoodite so that it is able to contain hydroxide ions. Ringwoodite can hold 1 to 3% of its weight in hydroxide ions. Considering that the 250 km-transition zone is about 7% of the Earth's mass (the crust is only about 1%), it could include at least as much (if not several times more) water than all the Earth's oceans.\n\nThe internal structure of the Earth :\n\nArea\n\ntotal : 510.072 million sq km\n\nland: 148.94 million sq km\n\nwater: 361,899,999 sq km\n\nnote: 70.9% of the world's surface is water, 29.1% is land\n\nArea - comparative\n\nland area about 16 times the size of the US\n\nAfrica-US area comparison map :\n\nAntarctica-US area comparison map :\n\nAsia-US area comparison map :\n\nAustralia-US area comparison map :\n\nEurope-US area comparison map :\n\nNorth America - US area comparison map :\n\nSouth America-US area comparison map :\n\nArea - rankings\n\ntop fifteen World Factbook entities ranked by size: Pacific Ocean 155,557,000 sq km;

Australia has no interior national river borders\n\nCoastline\n\n356,000 km\n\nnote: 95 nations and other entities are islands that border no other countries, they include: American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, The Bahamas, Bahrain, Baker Island, Barbados, Bermuda, Bouvet Island, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands, Cabo Verde, Cayman Islands, Christmas Island, Clipperton Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Comoros, Cook Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Dominica, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), Faroe Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, French Southern and Antarctic Lands, Greenland, Grenada, Guam, Guernsey, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Howland Island, Iceland, Isle of Man, Jamaica, Jan Mayen, Japan, Jarvis Island, Jersey, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Malta, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mayotte, Federated States of Micronesia, Midway Islands, Montserrat, Nauru, Navassa Island, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Norfolk Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Palmyra Atoll, Paracel Islands, Philippines, Pitcairn Islands, Puerto Rico, Saint Barthelemy, Saint Helena, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Seychelles, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Solomon Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Spratly Islands, Sri Lanka, Svalbard, Taiwan, Tokelau, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Virgin Islands, Wake Island, Wallis and Futuna\n\nMaritime claims\n\na variety of situations exist, but in general, most countries make the following claims measured from the mean low-tide baseline as described in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea: territorial sea - 12 nm, contiguous zone - 24 nm, and exclusive economic zone - 200 nm; additional zones provide for exploitation of continental shelf resources and an exclusive fishing zone; boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many countries from extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200 nm\n\nClimate\n\na wide equatorial band of hot and humid tropical climates is bordered north and south by subtropical temperate zones that separate two large areas of cold and dry polar climates\n\nten driest places on Earth (average annual precipitation): McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica 0 mm (0 in)\n\nArica, Chile 0.76 mm (0.03 in)\n\nAl Kufrah, Libya 0.86 mm (0.03 in)\n\nAswan, Egypt 0.86 mm (0.03 in)\n\nLuxor, Egypt 0.86 mm (0.03 in)\n\nIca, Peru 2.29 mm (0.09 in)\n\nWadi Halfa, Sudan 2.45 mm (0.1 in)\n\nIquique, Chile 5.08 mm (0.2 in)\n\nPelican Point, Namibia 8.13 mm (0.32 in)\n\nEl Arab (Aoulef), Algeria 12.19 mm (0.48 in)\n\nten wettest places on Earth (average annual precipitation): Mawsynram, India 11,871 mm (467.4 in)\n\nCherrapunji, India 11,777 mm (463.7 in)\n\nTutunendo, Colombia 11,770 mm (463.4 in)\n\nCropp River, New Zealand 11,516 mm (453.4 in)\n\nSan Antonia de Ureca, Equatorial Guinea 10,450 mm (411.4 in)\n\nDebundsha, Cameroon 10,299 mm (405.5 in)\n\nBig Bog, US (Hawaii) 10,272 mm (404.4 in)\n\nMt Waialeale, US (Hawaii) 9,763 mm (384.4 in)\n\nKukui, US (Hawaii) 9,293 mm (365.9 in)\n\nEmeishan, China 8,169 mm (321.6 in)\n\nten coldest places on Earth (lowest average monthly temperature): Verkhoyansk, Russia (Siberia) -47Â°C (-53Â°F) January\n\nOymyakon, Russia (Siberia) -46Â°C (-52Â°F) January\n\nEureka, Canada -38.4Â°C (-37.1Â°F) February\n\nIsachsen, Canada -36Â°C (-32.8Â°F) February\n\nAlert, Canada -34Â°C (-28Â°F) February\n\nKap Morris Jesup, Greenland -34Â°C (-29Â°F) March\n\nCornwallis Island, Canada -33.5Â°C (-28.3Â°F) February\n\nCambridge Bay, Canada -33.5Â°C (28.3Â°F) February\n\nIlirnej, Russia -33Â°C (-28Â°F) January\n\nResolute, Canada -33Â°C (-27.4Â°F) February\n\nten hottest places on Earth (highest average monthly temperature): Death Valley, US (California) 39Â°C (101Â°F) July\n\nIranshahr, Iran 38.3Â°C (100.9Â°F) June\n\nOuallene, Algeria 38Â°C (100.4Â°F) July\n\nKuwait City, Kuwait 37.7Â°C (100Â°F) July\n\nMedina, Saudi Arabia 36Â°C (97Â°F) July\n\nBuckeye, US (Arizona) 34Â°C (93Â°F) July\n\nJazan, Saudi Arabia 33Â°C (91Â°F) June\n\nAl Kufrah, Libya 31Â°C (87Â°F) July\n\nAlice Springs, Australia 29Â°C (84Â°F) January\n\nTamanrasset, Algeria 29Â°C (84Â°F) June\n\nTerrain\n\ntremendous variation of terrain may be found on each of the continents, and a compilation of terrain extremes can be found in the World \"Elevation\" entry;

Lake Superior (Canada, United States) 82,100 sq km; Lake Victoria (Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda) 62,940 sq km; Lake Huron (Canada, United States) 59,600 sq km; Lake Michigan (United States) 57,750 sq km; Lake Tanganyika (Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Zambia) 32,000 sq km; Great Bear Lake (Canada) 31,328 sq km; Lake Baikal (Russia) 31,500 sq km; Lake Malawi (Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania) 22,490 sq km; Great Slave Lake (Canada) 28,568 sq km\n\nnote 1: the areas of the lakes are subject to seasonal variation; only the Caspian Sea is saline, the rest are fresh water\n\nnote 2: Lakes Huron and Michigan are technically a single lake because the flow of water between the Straits of Mackinac that connects the two lakes keeps their water levels at near-equilibrium; combined, Lake Huron-Michigan is the largest freshwater lake by surface area in the world\n\nnote 3: if ranked by water volume, the Caspian Sea would still be first, but it would be followed Lakes Baikal, Tanganyika, Superior, and Malawi; Lake Superior contains more water than the other four North American Great Lakes (Erie, Huron, Michigan, Ontario) combined\n\nMajor rivers (by length in km)\n\ntop ten longest rivers: Nile (Africa) 6,650 km; Amazon (South America) 6,436 km; Yangtze (Asia) 6,300 km; Mississippi-Missouri (North America) 6,275 km; Yenisey-Angara (Asia) 5,539 km; Huang He/Yellow (Asia) 5,464 km; Ob-Irtysh (Asia) 5,410 km; Congo (Africa) 4,700 km; Amur (Asia) 4,444 km; Lena (Asia) 4,400 km\n\nnote: there are 21 countries without rivers: three in Africa (Comoros, Djibouti, Libya), one in the Americas (Bahamas), eight in Asia (Bahrain, Kuwait, Maldives, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen), three in Europe (Malta, Monaco, Holy See), and six in Oceania (Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Tonga, Tuvalu); these countries also do not have natural lakes\n\nMajor watersheds (area sq km)\n\na watershed is a drainage basin on an area of land where precipitation collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a river, bay, or other body of water; oceans ultimately take in the drainage from 83% of all land area; the remaining 17% of the land drains into internal (endorheic) basins, e.g., the Caspian Sea\n\nThe World Factbook lists 51 different watersheds across 102 countries:\n\nAsia - 18\n\nEurope - 9\n\nAfrica- 9\n\nNorth and Central America - 8\n\nSouth America - 5\n\nAustralia - 2\n\nall watersheds with an area of at least 500,000 sq km have been included, along with a number of smaller, regionally significant watersheds; together, these represent the surface hydrology water flows that are the world's primary sources of fresh water for individual consumption, industry, and agriculture\n\nMajor aquifers\n\naquifers are underground layers of water-bearing permeable rock formations; they include alluvial formations such as unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers, sedimentary rock formations of sandstone and karst (carbonate rocks such as limestone) aquifers, as well as volcanic aquifers, and basement aquifers (igneous and metamorphic rocks that underlie sedimentary and volcanic rock sequences); groundwater from aquifers can be extracted using a water well\n\nThe World Factbook lists 37 major aquifers across 52 countries:\n\nAfrica - 13\n\nAsia - 10\n\nNorth America - 5\n\nSouth America - 3\n\nEurope - 4\n\nAustralia -2\n\nalthough aquifers can vary in size, the major aquifers listed in The Factbook contain the bulk of the stored volume of groundwater; the fresh water held in these aquifers represents more than 30% of the world's fresh water; in the US, groundwater is primarily used for irrigation, and globally, 70% of groundwater withdrawn is used for agriculture; groundwater also supplies almost half of all drinking water worldwide\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nsix of the world's seven continents are widely and permanently inhabited; Asia is the most populous continent with about 60% of the world's population (China and India together account for over 35%); Africa comes in second with over 15%, Europe has about 10%, North America 8%, South America almost 6%, and Oceania less than 1%; the harsh conditions on Antarctica prevent any permanent habitation\n\nNatural hazards\n\nlarge areas of the world are subject to severe weather (tropical cyclones) and natural disasters (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions)\n\nvolcanism: volcanism is a fundamental driver and consequence of plate tectonics, the physical process reshaping the Earth's lithosphere; the world is home to more than 1,500 potentially active volcanoes, with over 500 of these having erupted in historical times; an estimated 500 million people live near volcanoes; associated dangers include lava flows, lahars (mudflows), pyroclastic flows, ash clouds, ash fall, ballistic projectiles, gas emissions, landslides, earthquakes, and tsunamis; in the 1990s, the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior created a list of 16 \"Decade Volcanoes\" worthy of special study because of their great potential for destruction: Avachinsky-Koryaksky (Russia), Colima (Mexico), Etna (Italy), Galeras (Colombia), Mauna Loa (United States), Merapi (Indonesia), Nyiragongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Rainier (United States), Sakurajima (Japan), Santa Maria (Guatemala), Santorini (Greece), Taal (Philippines), Teide (Spain), Ulawun (Papua New Guinea), Unzen (Japan), Vesuvius (Italy); see second note under \"Geography - note\"\n\nVolcano statistics:Â\n\ncountries with the most volcanoes (Holocene Epoch, the past 12,000 years): United States (162), Japan (122), Indonesia (120), Russia (117), Chile (91); note - roughly 1,350 volcanoes have erupted over this time period; about 40-50 eruptions are ongoing at any one time; the frequency of volcanoes has not increased\n\nlongest erupting volcano: Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala has been constantly erupting since 22 June 1922; note - Captain Cook observed the Yasur volcano on Tanna Island in Vanuatu in 1774, and it has since been in constant activity but is not cited due to lack of a clear start date; research (tephra stratigraphy and radiocarbon dating) shows that activity may have begun on Yasur ca. A.D. 1270 and so has persisted for over 750 years\n\nhighest volcano (above sea level): Nevado Ojos del Salado (6,893 m; 22,615 ft) on the Chile-Argentina border is the world's highest volcano above sea level and the highest peak in Chile\n\nhighest volcano (from base): Mauna Kea (United States) is the world's tallest mountain as measured from base to summit; the peak of this volcanic colossus lies on the island of Hawaii, but its base begins more than 70 km offshore and at a depth of about 6,000 m; total height estimates range from 9,966 m to 10,203 m\n\nWonders of the World\n\nThe Seven Wonders of the Ancient World:\n\nThe conquests of Alexander the Great (r. 336-323 B.C.) in the fourth century B.C. fostered the spread of Greek culture to the lands bordering the eastern Mediterranean and through much of the Middle East, ushering in what is today referred to as the Hellenistic Period (323-31 B.C.). Hellenistic sightseers compiled guidebooks focused on outstanding monuments in those parts of the world, including Persia, Egypt, and Babylon. Generally, seven sites were emphasized since that number was considered magical, perfect, and complete. Not all Wonders lists from ancient times agreed, but six sites consistently appeared (the massive Walls of Babylon sometimes substituted for the Lighthouse of Alexandria). The seven described below represent the âclassicâ Seven Wonders most often cited.\n\n1. The Great Pyramid of Egypt\n\nThe oldest of the Seven Wonders, the Great Pyramid, is the only one that remains largely intact. Commissioned by the Pharaoh Khufu (r. ca. 2589-2566 B.C.), it is the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. It served as the rulerâs tomb and was built over a period of about 20 years, concluding around 2560 B.C. The pyramid is estimated to have been 146.5 m tall when completed and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years (until the 14th century A.D.). Most of the original limestone casing stones that formed the outer smooth surface of the pyramid are gone. Today, the pyramidâs height is about 139 m.\n\n2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon\n\nThis is the only one of the ancient Seven Wonders for which a definitive location has never been established. No surviving Babylonian texts mention the Gardens, nor have any archeological remains been discovered in todayâs Iraq. According to tradition, the Gardens were a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of mud-brick-tiered gardens containing a variety of trees, shrubs, and vines that, when viewed from below, resembled a leafy green mountain. The Gardens are frequently attributed to the Neo-Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605-562 B.C.), who may have had them built for his Median wife Queen Amytis because she missed the green hills and valleys of her homeland.\n\n3. The Temple of Artemis (Artemision) at Ephesus\n\nThis Greek temple at Ephesus (3 km southwest of Selcuk in present-day western Turkey) was dedicated to the goddess Artemis and was completely rebuilt twice: once after a 7th century B.C. flood and then after a 356 B.C. act of arson. In its final form, it was judged to be one of the Seven Wonders and survived for 600 years. The magnificent building was composed entirely of marble, with massive dimensions reported to be 130 m by 69 m, and included 127 columns, each some 18 m tall. The Temple was damaged in a Gothic raid in A.D. 268, and Christians finally closed it in the early-to-mid 5th century. The structure was dismantled in succeeding centuries, and today almost nothing of the temple remains.\n\n4. The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus\n\nConstructed in about 350 B.C., the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus was located on the site of the present-day city of Bodrum in southwestern Turkey. It was the tomb of Mausolus, a Persian ruler, and his wife -- the term \"mausoleum\" is derived from his name. The structure stood about 45 m high and took some 20 years to complete. A series of earthquakes between the 12th and 15th centuries A.D. devastated the structure, which was the last of the original Seven Wonders to be destroyed.\n\n5. The Colossus of Rhodes\n\nThis statue of the Greek sun god Helios, constructed to celebrate Rhodesâ successful repulse of a siege, was made of iron tie bars to which brass or bronze plates were attached to form a skin. Contemporary descriptions list its height at about 70 cubits or some 33 m â approximately the same height as the Statue of Liberty from heel to top of head (34 m) â thus making it the tallest statue in the ancient world. Completed in about 280 B.C. at the entrance to the Rhodes harbor, the monument stood for only about 54 years until it toppled in an earthquake in 226 B.C. The impressive remains lay on the ground for over 800 years before finally being sold for scrap.\n\n6. The Lighthouse (Pharos) of Alexandria\n\nCompleted around 275 B.C., the lighthouse stood on Pharos Island at the entrance to the Egyptian port city of Alexandria for some 1,600 years. Three earthquakes severely damaged it between A.D. 956 and 1323, when it was deactivated. The shape of the structure appeared on a number of ancient coins: a solid square base, which made up about half of the height, supported an octagonal middle section and a cylindrical top. The height of the structure is thought to have been at least 100 m and perhaps as high as 140 m. (The tallest lighthouse in the world today is the Jeddah Light in Saudi Arabia, which stands at 133 m.) At its apex stood a mirror that reflected sunlight during the day; a fire burned at night.Â\n\n7. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia in Greece\n\nThe giant seated statue of the king of the Greek gods in the sanctuary of Olympia was completed by the Greek sculptor Phidias in approximately 435 B.C. Roughly 13 m tall, it was constructed of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden framework, and the godâs throne was ornamented with ebony, ivory, gold, and precious stones. With the rise of Christianity, the sanctuary at Olympia fell into disuse; the details of the statueâs final destruction are unknown.\n\nnote: The Lighthouse of Alexandria may have been the last of the Wonders to be completed (ca. 275 B.C.), and the Colossus of Rhodes was the first to be destroyed in about 226 B.C., so the Seven Wonders existed at the same time for only about 50 years in the middle of the third century B.C.\n\nThe New Seven Wonders of the World:\n\nA private initiative to come up with a new list for seven of the worldâs wonders sprang up early in the new Millennium. Worldwide balloting â via internet or telephone â took place, covering a list of 200 existing monuments. Over 100 million votes were reportedly cast over a period of several years and the final list was announced on 7-7-2007. Even though the polling was unscientific, the seven âwinnersâ were a worthy compilation of extraordinary Wonders to be found around the world. All seven of the New Wonders are inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are frequently cited in the literature.Â\n\n1. Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico\n\nThis archeological site includes the impressive remains of a large pre-Columbian Mayan city that flourished from ca. A.D. 600-1100. Among the outstanding structures at the site are the massive Temple of the Warriors complex, an Observatory (El Caracol), the Great Ball Court, and the Sacred Cenote (sinkhole) where offerings were made. The most famous building, however, is the step-pyramid known as the Temple of Kukulcan that dominates the center of the site and serves as the symbol of Chichen Itza. The pyramidal structure is 24 m high; the crowning temple adds another 6 m. Although located in the dense jungles of Yucatan, it remains one of the most visited tourist sites in Mexico.\n\n2. The Colosseum, Rome, Italy\n\nThe Roman Emperor Vespasian began construction on the Colosseum in A.D. 72, and his son Titus completed it in A.D. 80. Further modifications were made by Domitian (A.D. 81-96). The three emperors make up the Flavian Dynasty, thus providing the structure's alternate name, the Flavian Amphitheater. The massive structure is estimated to have seated, on average, about 65 thousand spectators and was most famously used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles. Earthquakes and thieves destroyed much of the original structure, but it nonetheless remains an iconic symbol of Rome. The Colosseum is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the World.\n\n3. Christ the Redeemer Statue, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nBuilt between 1922 and 1931, the 30-meter-tall sculpture is reputed to be the largest Art Deco statue in the World. Its pedestal provides another 8 m in height and the arms stretch out to 28 m. Constructed of reinforced concrete and soapstone, the statue has become the cultural icon not only of Rio, but also of Brazil.\n\n4. Great Wall, China\n\nThe name refers to a remarkable series of fortification systems that stretched across China's northern historical borders and served as protection against various nomadic peoples. An archeological survey revealed that the Wall and all its associated branches measures 21,196 km. The earliest of these walls date to the 7th century B.C.; certain stretches began to be linked in the 3rd century B.C., and successive dynasties added to or maintained various sections of the walls. The best-known and best-preserved portions of the wall are those built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Winding through amazingly varied terrain, the Great Wall is acknowledged as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history.\n\n5. Machu Picchu, Cuzco Region, Peru\n\nPerhaps the most spectacular archeological site in the Americas, the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, situated on a 2,430 m Andean mountain ridge, is now thought to have been erected as an estate for the Inca Emperor Pachacuti (r. 1438-1471) and may have also served as a religious sanctuary. Built between about 1450 and 1460, it was abandoned approximately a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. Construction was carried out in the classic Inca style of polished, fitted, dry-stone walls. Some 750 people lived at this royal estate, most of them support staff to the nobility. The site is roughly divided into an agricultural sector (with myriad terraces for raising crops) and an urban sector. The latter is composed of an upper town (with temples) and a lower town (with warehouses). Some of the religious monuments include: the Intiwatana (a carved, ritual stone that served as a type of sundial and that is referred to as âThe Hitching Post of the Sunâ); the Torreon or Temple of the Sun, a small tower that likely served as a type of observatory; and the Intimachay, a sacred cave with a masonry entrance.\n\n6. Petra, Maâan, Jordan\n\nPetra is believed to have been established in the 4th century B.C. as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom, an entity that grew fabulously wealthy as the nexus of trade routes in the southern Levant. The kingdom retained its independence until the Roman Empire annexed it in A.D. 106. The city is famous for its stunning rock-cut architecture and its water conduit system, which allowed the Nabataeans to control and store the water supply in this desert region and create an artificial oasis. At its peak in the 1st century A.D., the city may have had a population of 20,000.\n\n7. Taj Mahal, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India\n\nThis gorgeous ivory-white mausoleum â described as âone of the universally admired masterpieces of the worldâs heritageâ â was commissioned in 1632 by Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658) as the final resting place for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The building also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The Taj Mahal is the centerpiece of an entire 17-hectare complex that also includes a guest house, a mosque, and formal gardens. The entire project was not completed until about 1653. The Taj Mahal remains one of the most visited tourist sites in the world.\n\nnote: The Great Pyramid of Egypt, the only surviving Wonder of the ancient Seven, received an honorary status among the New Seven Wonders.
