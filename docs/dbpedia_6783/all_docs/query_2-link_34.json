        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nDengue is an important, rapidly spreading, mosquito borne viral infection and is endemic in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries around the world [1]. A recent study estimated that 390 million infections occur globally each year with 25% manifesting clinical symptoms, rendering dengue virus the most common mosquito born viral pathogen in humans [2]. Susceptible humans, dengue virus and Aedes mosquitos make up the cornerstones of the transmission cycle of dengue, but the transmission dynamics is further implicated by the environment, human behaviour, and globalisation [3,4].\n\nClimate, as an environmental factor, plays a major role in global and local spared of dengue. Due to the location of Sri Lanka, within the tropics between 5°55′ and 9°51′ North latitude and between 79°42′ and 81°53′ East longitude, the climate of the island could be characterized as tropical. Rainfall in Sri Lanka has multiple origins. The dominant weather systems that are responsible for rainfall in Sri Lanka are the two monsoons and the convectional activity during the intervening periods. These four seasons are described as first inter-monsoon (FIM) from March to April, Southwest monsoon (SWM) from May to September, second inter-monsoon (SIM) from October to November and Northeast monsoon (NEM) from December to February. SWM and to a lesser extent NEM are the two most important seasons in terms of temporal distribution of rainfall in western parts of the country. Extreme phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) more than 0.5 have been identified as a contributory factor on the seasonal rainfall of Sri Lanka [5,6,7]. Regional differences observed in air temperature over Sri Lanka are mainly due to altitude, rather than to latitude. The mean monthly temperature differs slightly depending on the seasonal movement of the sun, with some modified influence caused by rainfall. The mean annual temperature in Sri Lanka manifests largely homogeneous temperatures in the low lands and rapidly decreasing temperatures in the highlands [5].\n\nDengue is caused by a flavivirus with four distinct but closely related serotypes (DENV 1 to 4) and transmitted by female mosquito vectors of the Aedes species [8]. Ae. aegypti is the primary dengue vector in most endemic countries and a highly domesticated urban mosquito that lives close to human dwellings. It prefers to feeds on humans and lays eggs in artificial man-made containers. Aedes albopictus also contributes to dengue transmission, but serves as a vector primarily in rural areas [9].\n\nThe immature aquatic cycle of the dengue vector from egg to adult is about 7 to 9 days in conducive climate conditions [10]. The vector becomes infected by biting infected humans (or non-human primates) during the infective stage. Thereafter it can transmit the infection to non-infected humans following an extrinsic incubation period ranging from 5 to 12 days [11,12]. The clinical manifestations of dengue appear in the host following an intrinsic incubation period of 4 to 10 days. The host then goes through 2 to 10 days of viraemic or infective stage, completing the transmission cycle [8]. Infection can be asymptomatic; however, the disease leads to a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms and may result in clinical manifestations ranging from mild febrile illness to severe haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome, irrespective of age and gender [13].\n\nDengue was first serologically confirmed in Sri Lanka in 1962. The first island-wide outbreak was reported in 1965 [14]. Progressively larger epidemics have occurred since early 2000s with inter-annual cyclic returning patterns, reaching much higher magnitudes after 2009 [15]. Dengue is now reported from almost all the districts in the country and considered to be hyper-endemic with co-circulation of all four serotypes. DENV-1 replaced DENV-3 in 2009 triggering a wave of severe dengue epidemic in Sri Lanka. During 2012 to 2014 all laboratory confirmed cases were due to either DENV-1 or DENV-4, with DENV-1 being the predominant serotype (85%) [16,17]. In 2012, 44,456 cases were reported corresponding to an incidence rate of 220 per 100,000 population [18,19,20]. Nearly 60% of the total dengue cases in the country are reported from Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts in the Western province. Determinants of dengue epidemiology appear to vary island wide. In combination with weather variables, unplanned urbanization and lack of garbage disposal methods along with scarcity of recycling produce abundant breeding sites leading to the proliferation of disease vectors. The peak transmission period occurs usually in June following the SWM, followed by a less severe peak in December–January after the NEM in some districts [18,19].\n\nDengue control efforts in the country focus on disease and vector surveillance, integrated vector control, social mobilization for source reduction and emergency response activities during outbreaks in terms of intensified vector control measures and public awareness campaigns. A national-level multidisciplinary task force on dengue was established since May 2010 to coordinate the dengue control activities at national, provincial and district-levels. Each district has several Medical Officer of Health (MOH) divisions in which MOH is the responsible officer in implementing dengue control activities in the respective MOH division.\n\nThe effect of weather conditions on dengue vector life cycle and the vector’s ability to spread disease among humans (vectorial capacity) is well documented [12,21,22,23]. Rainfall affects vector abundance by replenishing breeding sites and stimulating egg hatching [24]. Even though heavy rainfalls may transiently reduce the risk of transmission by flushing larvae and pupae away from breeding sites or killing them, residual water collections increase the future risk for longer periods of time [25]. The risk of dengue transmission can increase with elevated temperatures by increasing the reproductive rate and biting rate of vectors and the probability of human to vector transmission per bite, as well as by reducing the extrinsic incubation period [12,21,26,27]. Other important factors affecting dengue epidemiology; urbanization, human behaviours, population growth and mobility, interactions between virus and hosts, and vector control programs [28,29].\n\nIdentification of time lags between the onset of certain weather observations and subsequent increases in dengue cases can provide important information on lead times for the implementation of response activities. Furthermore, the relationship of weather and climate to dengue incidence is important for an in-depth understanding of global climatic variability and change [30]. Scientific studies identifying and explaining such relationships in multiple areas by combining and contrasting temporally derived relationships between weather and dengue incidence at smaller geographical scales are, at present, lacking [31,32]. Understanding the heterogeneous spatio-temporal distribution of risk associations for dengue transmission is important in planning and implementing effective infection control measures [33]. In view of the increasing frequency and severity of dengue epidemics in Sri Lanka, it is important to understand how such associations can facilitate effective control of dengue in MOH divisions in a given district.\n\nThe objective of the study was to characterise the relationship and time lag between rainfall and temperature conditions and dengue incidence, to describe how the weather patterns associate to the ONI, and how the ONI associate directly to dengue incidence. We quantify a joint estimate of the relationships, and the spatial heterogeneity across MOH divisions of a district, using a statistical methodology developed for studying risks related to time varying exposures in multiple geographical areas. Kalutara district was selected because it is one of the highly dengue endemic districts in Sri Lanka and a wide variation is observed in geography and population densities.\n\n3. Results\n\nA total of 7412 dengue cases were reported across all MOH divisions in Kalutara district from January 2009 to December 2013 with an average annual incidence rate of 151.8 per hundred thousand populations. Panadura MOH division, the most populated area situated close to the border with Colombo district, contributed to 40% of the total dengue cases reported in Kalutara district throughout the study period. Matugama, Horana and Bandaragama divisions routinely contributed to around 25% of the total dengue cases each year. Despite being a rural area with low population density, the Walallavita division reported a higher proportion of dengue cases during the 2012 dengue epidemic compared to other years. The rest of the divisions consistently reported low numbers of dengue cases annually during the study period.\n\ndescribes land area, population density, dengue incidence and weather patterns in all MOH divisions in Kalutara District, Sri Lanka, 2009–2013.\n\nTable 1\n\nMOH DivisionLand Area (km2)Population Density (Per km2)Average Annual Dengue Cases (2009 to 2013) Average Annual Incidences (Per 100,000 Population)Weekly Cumulative Precipitation (Range; mm)Weekly Mean of Evening Temperature (Range; °C)Panadura723352.4590235.350.0 (0–508)29.43 (25.50–31.55)Matugama268507.2179131.763.2 (0–569)29.43 (25.50–31.55)Walallavita210279.5126206.359.6 (0–521)29.86 (25.72–33.63)Horana1101077.9124108.453.2 (0–570)29.86 (25.72–33.63)Bandaragama552090.510995.753.2 (0–570)29.43 (25.50–31.55)Ingiriya93639.299168.777.3 (0–630)29.86 (25.72–33.63)Madurawala135665.48292.752.7 (0–521)29.43 (25.50–31.55)Palindanuwara270208.074129.769.7 (0–460)29.86 (25.72–33.63)Bulathsinhala210333.85276.177.3 (0–630)29.86 (25.72–33.63)Agalawatta88414.849121.352.7 (0–521)29.86 (25.72–33.63)\n\ndescribes the distribution of rainfall in all MOH divisions during the study period in Kalutara district, Sri Lanka.\n\nshows the monthly ONI, cumulative average of weekly weather predictors and dengue cases reported in all MOH divisions in Kalutara district, Sri Lanka, 2009–2013.\n\nExcept for the period 2012–2013 during which a prolonged but flattened dengue epidemic was observed, all the other years displayed distinct annual seasonal peaks of dengue cases from May to September. The maximum number of cases per week for the study period was observed at the 24th week of the year 2009 with 98 cases. Since 2009, however, a gradual increasing trend for all weeks was noted. During the study period ENSO extreme event (ONI more than 0.5) reported only once from July 2009 to April 2010. The annual average rainfall in Kalutara was 3260 mm with the bulk of the rain falling during the SWM and NEM where highest rainfall reported during 2010. The lowest annual average rainfall of 1600 mm was reported in the coastal regions, and the highest, 4280 mm, was reported towards the inner mountain areas illustrating substantial heterogeneity among MOH divisions. Rainfall pattern showed bi-annual peaks coinciding with the monsoon periods in June following the SWM, and in November with NEM. Temperature was gradually increasing reaching its maximum around April and decreasing thereafter towards the end of the year ( ). During 2012–2013, which was an epidemic period, there were more rainfalls throughout the district. The average temperature ranged between 25.5 °C and 33.6 °C [5]. The divisional dengue and weather variables followed the same annual pattern with some variation in the amount and the time scale.\n\n3.1. Rainfall-Dengue Association\n\nThe overall rainfall-dengue associations in the 10 MOH divisions in Kalutara district obtained through meta-analysis are illustrated in and .\n\nAs shown in , a minimal increase in relative risk of dengue was observed with rainfall at 50 mm per week. With the increase in rainfall form 100 mm per week to 250 mm per week, the relative risk of dengue is increasing becoming statistically significant from the lag around 8 weeks. With further increase in rainfall, the relative risk becomes significant and stronger earlier around 6 weeks. Even though, statistically not significant, the relative risk of dengue appears to be lower than 1 with more extreme rainfalls more than 350 mm per week at early lags up to around 3 weeks, while such events have a net strong positive influence on dengue at longer lags of 6–12 weeks.\n\nAs shown in , it is clear that the relative risk of dengue sharply increased with increasing rainfall starting after 6 weeks of lag. At lower rainfall levels the relative risk becomes significant at longer lags while at higher rainfall levels it becomes significant at shorter lags and more pronounced at longer lags. The longer the lag the higher the relative risk and the highest risk was observed at around 10 weeks. At 0-week lag, the risk appeared to be decreasing compared to the reference for rainfall levels more than 300 mm per week.\n\nFigure S2 (See supplement) shows the rainfall-dengue associations in each MOH division obtained through first stage division specific models.\n\n3.2. Temperature-Dengue Association\n\nand show that when temperature increased, the relative risk of dengue increased over its full range in reference to the relative risk at a mean temperature of 29.8 °C. When temperature was below this reference temperature the relative risk of dengue was reduced, while above the reference value and at extreme temperatures, the relative risk of dengue was increased to 1.2 at lag 4–12 weeks. An approximately linear increase in the relative risk of dengue was observed with increasing temperature.\n\n3.3. ONI-Dengue Association\n\nAnalysis of rainfall and dengue association with ONI showed that extreme ENSO events (ONI more than 0.5) are significantly associated with temperature, rainfall and dengue in Kalutara. For the temperature, a significant increase in relative risk is seen starting from early as 1 month and extending up to 6 months with ONI more than 0.5 ( ). Increasing ONI more than 0.5 caused increased relative risk of rainfall from a lag period of one to four months. The maximum intensity was seen around three months ( ). Relative risk of dengue was seen to be significantly increasing with ONI more than 0.5 at a lag of six months ( ).\n\n3.4. Assessment of Heterogeneity in Associations among MOH Divisions\n\nThe overall estimated heterogeneity of the pooled exposure-response curves amounted to a Cochran Q test value of 105.7 (I2—74.5% and p value < 0.000) for rainfall and a value of 52.9 (I2—66% and p value < 0.000) for temperature indicating substantial differences between the MOH divisions in the estimated location specific responses. A closer assessment of the heterogeneity revealed that it was larger for very low and very extreme rainfall values, and for lower and average temperatures. Higher than average temperatures exerted a more consistent positive effect on dengue incidence.\n\nTable S2 in the supplement shows that substantial heterogeneity existed among 10 MOH divisions for different exposure levels of rainfall. Lowest I2 and least significant Cochran Q test were observed for a rainfall level of 300 mm per week. Higher I2 values with highly significant Q test were seen for rainfall values deviating from 300 mm per week.\n\nThe divisional heterogeneity for different exposure levels of temperature appeared to be decreasing with increasing temperature values. Temperatures higher than the mean value had lower heterogeneity and less significant Q test compared to lower temperatures (see Table S3 in the supplement). Figure S3 (see supplement) shows the temperature-dengue associations in each MOH division obtained through first stage division specific models.\n\nHeterogeneity for ONI associations was not statistically significant at p value of 0.05. Highest I square statics and Q test was observed for overall ONI and dengue associations (see Table S4 in the supplement).\n\nVariable selection was done by a preliminary analysis using generalised additive model. We have considered rainfall, relative humidity, morning (minimum) and evening (maximum) temperature and ONI as explanatory variables. We found that only the rainfall, evening (maximum) temperature and ONI are significantly (at a p value of less than 0.05) influencing the dengue in the study area. Relative humidity was not significant. The model selection procedure regarding the natural cubic spline functions, as described in the methodology section, used a spline with 4 knots for rainfall and a single knot for temperature. As a sensitivity analysis, we compared the results using different number and positioning of knots. The resulting exposure-response curves were very similar to those showed in and for rainfall and those in and for temperature. We added seasonality to the model to explore the variability explained by underlying seasonality if exists. This addition to the final model changed the AIC only minimally (Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials). This could be due to the seasonality of dengue is mostly explained by and related to weather. Residuals sequence plots in a majority of the MOH divisions from the first stage model indicated constant location and scale between observed and predicted dengue cases while the histogram of residuals showed approximately normal distribution and independent residuals. Please see supplement for more information (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur findings showed that both rainfall and temperature were significantly associated with relative risk of dengue in the district. Increasing weekly cumulative rainfall was associated with increased dengue risk starting after 6 weeks of lag. The most significant positive association was seen at lag weeks 8–10 for cumulative rainfall above 300 mm per week. Compared with a reference value of 29.8 °C, increasing weekly mean temperature over its full range was associated with an elevated risk of dengue starting after 4 weeks of lag. The study also illustrates the presence of considerable heterogeneity in temperature and rainfall effect on dengue among 10 MOH divisions.\n\nThe lag associations observed in this study is compatible with dengue vector life cycle and transmission dynamics [8,9,10,11,12,13]. A 4–12 weeks lag period is a summation of the necessary time for dengue vectors to complete development cycle from eggs, become infected with the virus, extrinsic incubation period and biting activities in the gonotrophic cycle, and the intrinsic incubation period in the host, as well as the time for the patient attending health facility to be notified as a dengue case.\n\nWe found a strong association between both rainfall and temperature in the study district to the ONI with several months latency. We further found the ONI more than 0.5 associated to dengue cases directly with the additional time lag of rainfall and temperature to dengue. This suggests ONI may be used for informing on dengue fluctuations with longer lead times. Findings of the analysis of ONI and rainfall support the existing climatological evidence on the influence of ENSO extremes on the rainfall for the Western part of the Island. Studies conducted by the department of meteorology Sri Lanka have shown that there is a trend for below normal rainfall for the southwest monsoon season (May–September) during El Nino situation, while the trend is above normal during Second Inter-monsoon (October–November) [6,7]. This phenomenon indicates shifting of rainfall for 1 to 5 months during ENSO extremes and is compatible with above findings of ONI and rainfall. This may partly explain the maximum annual rainfall and subsequent surge of dengue cases during 2010. Relative risk of dengue was seen to be significantly increasing with ONI more than 0.5 at a lag of six months. This again highlights our previous finding on rainfall and dengue association with the lag period of 8 to 10 weeks. Highest dengue peak observed during 2009 may be due to introduction of DENV-1 in to Sri Lanka and may be further augmented by ENSO activity.\n\nThe mosquito vectors have aquatic larval and pupae stages; hence water is essential to sustain their life-cycle. Rainfall proliferate breeding grounds for mosquitoes in discarded man-made receptacles scattered outside human habitats in multiple geographical locations. The availability of ample breeding sites, in turn, leads to an increase in the number of mosquitoes. Warm temperatures further augment dengue transmission dynamics by increasing survival and biting rates and decreasing the extrinsic incubation period of the virus in mosquitoes [22,54]. Increasing temperature shortens the gonotrophic cycle and reduces the EIP from 5–33 days at 25 °C to 2–15 days at 30 °C [11]. It is shown that at higher temperatures the vector needs more frequent blood meals to complete the gonotropic cycle, and more than one gonotropic cycle during the vector’s lifecycle may increase the risk of dengue transmission [54,55,56]. With these favourable environmental conditions, it is biologically plausible that dengue epidemics could follow as early as 4 weeks form the exposure. The most significant lag dimension of 6 to 10 weeks for increased relative risk for notified dengue cases identified in our model explains the increased dengue risk observed in the district following such rainfall and temperature events. Our observation of an initial reduction in dengue risk at early lags following extremely heavy rainfalls may be related to the flushing of larvae from breeding sites, disturbing their habitats and lifecycle.\n\nThe findings of the study support the existing evidence on the association between weather variables and dengue incidence [57,58,59,60]. Many studies have identified an overall increased risk of dengue for rainfall and temperature at lag weeks 9–16 [21,61]. A two months lag period for rainfall was documented in other statistical and mathematical modelling studies [22,62,63]. The vectorial capacity of Aedes mosquitoes is highly dependent on temperature. Subsequently the transmission of dengue virus may increase under warmer temperatures as more mosquitoes become infectious during their lifespan [12]. Statistical inferences obtained through our study are also compatible with dengue vector biology and transmission dynamics [33].\n\nOur study has the added advantage of identifying and contrasting the heterogeneous nature of weather-dengue associations across small geographical divisions with different social and bio-ecological factors. Such heterogeneity in local settings has not been quantified in Sri Lanka to the best of our knowledge [31,64]. We observed the presence of considerable heterogeneity in dengue risk among the 10 MOH divisions for different rainfall and temperature values. The heterogeneity was specifically related to the lower and higher range of the observed rainfall distribution and the lower and medium range of the observed temperature distribution. Particularly, higher temperatures seem to be more consistently associated with higher dengue risk. The homogeneous behaviour of the exposure-response relationship across 10 MOH divisions at moderately high rainfalls around 300 mm per week and temperatures higher than 30 °C from February to April appeared to be related to subsequent increases in dengue from May to September in the district, as seen in . It is interesting to note that heterogeneity is not statistically significant and I square value is 1% for overall ONI-rainfall and ONI-temperature associations. Reasons could be that ONI is signalling a more complete and consistent weather change in the district. It is also natural to see the absence of such consistent pattern for ONI-dengue associations (I square statistic 27.2%) as many other factors governing dengue outbreaks.\n\nConsiderable heterogeneity might have arisen from other covariates that are not explained by weather associations. Reasons explaining the heterogeneity between MOH divisions may include differences in human behaviour, population movement patterns, herd immunity, circulating dengue viral strains, and land use. Furthermore, the effectiveness of control and prevention activities depends on community support, inter-sectoral participation, and the availability of health staff in each MOH division. Panadura, Horana, Bandaragama, Matugama, Madurawala and Walallavita divisions account for 77% of the population, 57% of the land area and 80% of the total dengue cases reported in the district during the study period. Since most of the public and private institutions, including schools and factories, are located in these divisions, there is a constant movement of people within and across these divisions. Lack of proper waste management system and poorly developed urban infrastructure along with high population densities may result in an accumulation of multiple outdoor artificial breeding places for Aedes mosquitoes. Panadura reported about 40% of the total dengue cases in the district during the study period. In this MOH division, the increase in the relative risk of dengue appears to be started 2 weeks prior to other divisions in the district. The division is situated adjacent to the Western margin of the Colombo, which is the most highly affected district in the island. This and abundant mosquito breeding sites and high population density might have led to the distinct pattern observed with an increased relative risk of dengue at short lags for both rainfall and temperature (see Supplementary Materials Figures S2 and S3). In contrast, Ingiriya, Bulathsinhala, Agalawatta and Palindanuwara, characterized by rain forests and mountain ranges, are more rural and reported low numbers of dengue cases during the study period. The livelihood of the people in these divisions is mainly dependent on agriculture. People are clustered in villages in which basic needs are met, where one could see a picture similar to other high risk divisions. Entomological surveillance conducted in these MOH divisions revealed a mixture of natural and manmade mosquito breeding places. These division specific characteristics might have influenced the dengue epidemiology and the observed heterogeneity of weather variables across the divisions.\n\nA limitation of the study originates from the fact that temperature data were available from only 2 stations located in the district. This limitation was partly overcome because of the presence of a more uniform spatial pattern for temperature [63]. We found spatial correlation of 85% between our observational stations. Further the temperature observed from 2009 to 2013 in the district was always within the favourable range for mosquito development and dengue transmission. Analysis using remotely sense gridded data did not change the central conclusions of the study (see Supplementary Materials Figures S4 and S5 for validation of homogenous spatial distribution of temperature across all divisions using MODIS data). The presence of asymptomatic cases and underreporting of dengue cases are inherent limitations of a dengue incidence study. Even though the Epidemiology Unit monitors notifiable diseases in each MOH division regularly, dengue cases from private health institutions and general practitioners are still poorly captured. A sero-prevalence study conducted in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 2009 showed that for every dengue fever case notified, an additional 30 primary dengue infections occur in the community [19]. Considering cost effectiveness with rapid diagnostics, laboratory diagnosis is not widely used particularly in government hospitals. Therefore unfortunately, since data with laboratory confirmed cases are not uniformly available for this analysis at the regional and sub-district level. Available scientific evidence suggests in Sri Lanka, that clinicians’ diagnosis for dengue at time of admission had a high sensitivity of 84.7% but the specificity of 32.5% is questionable [17]. However, this type of surveillance data is still the prevailing methods observing dengue disease patterns in most endemic countries.\n\nGiven the weight of evidence on the impact of climate change on dengue, it is widely accepted that the risk of dengue infection in tropical regions, including Southeast Asia, may intensify in the future. As an example, the El Niño driven prolonged outbreak seasons in the late 1990s may be a manifestation of the impact of climate variability on the disease [65]. Therefore, further studies on the impact of climatic factors on both regional and national dengue incidence are essential to understand what actions are needed to control the disease under aggravated conditions of climate variability and change. At the same time, it is important to consider how other factors, such as urbanization and population density [29], effectiveness of dengue control measures, viral genetic configuration, immunity status of the population and population mobility [66], co-facilitate dengue epidemics in order to strengthen dengue surveillance at local and global levels and reduce its public health burden."
