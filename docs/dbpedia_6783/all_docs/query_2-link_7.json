Warm temperatures and ample sunlight facilitate the growth of aquatic plants, while the monsoon patterns contribute to nutrient-rich upwelling in coastal waters, fostering productive fisheries and aquaculture. Sri Lanka’s prime location in the Indian Ocean positions it along significant ocean currents and migratory routes for marine species. This creates opportunities for fishing, both artisanal and commercial, as well as for marine biodiversity research and conservation.\n\nWater Supply\n\nAdequate rainfall, especially during the monsoon seasons, helps replenish water reservoirs and groundwater resources, ensuring a consistent water supply for various uses, including agriculture, industry, and domestic needs.\n\nWeathering and climatic disadvantages for Sri Lanka as a tropical region island\n\nLike any other region, Sri Lanka also experiences certain climatic and weathering disadvantages due to its tropical location and island geography. Sri Lanka grapples with a multifaceted array of hazards, encompassing a spectrum of weather-related phenomena, from cyclones and monsoonal rains to consequential flooding and perilous landslides, as underscored by the Ministry of Disaster Management (2019). The nation’s susceptibility to droughts is amplified by the capriciousness of monsoon patterns, compounded by the menace of lightning strikes, coastal erosion, epidemics, and environmental contamination. Among these hazards, the preeminence of localized and seasonal flooding looms large, posing a grave menace to the populace. This threat is further exacerbated by the escalating anticipation of heightened impact and frequency of hydrometeorological perils, as expounded by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR, 2017). The cataclysmic Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 resoundingly underscored Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to infrequent yet catastrophic events, spotlighting the nation’s susceptibility to rare, high-impact occurrences, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management (2019).
