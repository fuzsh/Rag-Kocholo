        "text": "Sri Lanka has three main geographic areas based on elevation - highlands, uplands, and lowlands. It also has six climatic zones - Arid, Dry, Intermediate, Lowland Wet, Sub-Montane Wet, and Wet Highlands. These zones vary in rainfall, temperature, humidity, and vegetation types. The Wet Highlands in the central highlands have extensive forests and receive the highest rainfall, while the Arid zones in the northwest and southeast are very dry with inadequate rainfall to support abundant vegetation. Sri Lanka's geography and climate zones contribute greatly to its high biodiversity."
