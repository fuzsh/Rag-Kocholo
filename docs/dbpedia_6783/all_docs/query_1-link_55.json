        "text": "Every location in the world can be identified by a set of coordinates using intersecting vertical and horizontal grid lines, indicated by numbers and / or letters.\n\nBut the question is, “Do you know how to read them? And, do you know what they mean?”\n\nIn this blog, we will explain the correct way to read grid coordinates, as well as knowing what the words “latitude” and “longitude” mean, so you can engrave your special place on a piece of jewellery you’ll love.\n\nWhat is Latitude?\n\nBefore we can get into how grid coordinates are read, we must first understand the meaning of latitude and longitude.\n\nLatitude is a coordinate that specifies the North-South position of a point on the surface of the Earth. Latitude is given as an angle that ranges from -90° at the South pole to 90° at the North pole, with 0° at the Equator.\n\nWhat is Longitude?\n\nUnlike latitude, longitude specifies the East-West position of a point on the surface of the Earth. Longitude is measured 180 degrees both East and West of the prime meridian, and is measured in degrees (°), minutes (‘), and seconds (“).\n\nHow to measure latitude and longitude?\n\nLatitude and longitude are measured by using three lines – the equator, the tropics, and the prime meridian. They are then divided into 60 minutes, which can then be further divided into 60 seconds.\n\nFor example, the longitude of Paris, France, is 2° 29' E (2 degrees, 29 minutes east).\n\nThe easiest way to know the exact location of a set of grid coordinates is to enter it into Google Maps, or what3words.com\n\nHow detailed are grid coordinates?\n\nGrid coordinates can be measured using degrees, minutes, and seconds. Remember that one degree equals 364,000 feet (69 miles or 111,045 meters), one-minute equals 6,068 feet (1.15 miles or 1851 meters), and one second equals 101 feet (31 meters).\n\nFor example, 35° 44’ 27”. For 35°, this means it’s the general location. With 35° 44’, it is a more precise location because the 44’ measures the minutes and therefore gives a more detailed location. Lastly, 35° 44’ 27” is the most detailed you can get as the added minutes and seconds show an exact location.\n\nWhat can you use grid coordinates for?\n\nBecause grid coordinates can be used to find any location in the world, they can be quite handy in finding lost items, or if you want to remember a special place.\n\nCoordinates can be used to find an exact location, e.g., your home. This can be very useful if your dog goes missing, as you have listed your home coordinates on its collar. It’s much easier to help people return them to you.\n\nOther than using latitude and longitude to find lost pets, you can use it to remind yourself of a special place you once visited, whether it’s your honeymoon, the place you got married or somewhere that holds sentimental value. Where did you meet your partner? Or where did you have your first kiss?\n\nWe can help you design latitude longitude jewellery that reminds you of your special place every day. Check out the full range here.\n\nAs you can see, we have a range of latitude / longitude products to remember your special place, whether it’s on a bracelet, necklace, or even a keychain.
