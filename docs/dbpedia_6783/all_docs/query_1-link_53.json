        "text": "Classroom Activity\n\nMaterials | Procedure | Activity Answer | Links & Books | Standards\n\nObjective\n\nTo research and chart the shortest course to circumnavigate the globe.\n\ncopy of \"Voyage Around the World\" student handout (HTML)\n\nworld map, globe or atlas, with a scale\n\nsmall tacks, pins or self-stick notes (for marking locations)\n\na 12-inch piece of string (for measuring distances)\n\nOrganize students into groups and distribute student handouts and materials to each group. Explain that the challenge is to research and chart a course that takes them to each Checkpoint Destination on their way around the world once. Have students review the Nautical Rules and Checkpoint Destinations before beginning. (You may delete or change Checkpoint Destinations to best suit your students' abilities.)\n\nHave students research locations that match the Checkpoint descriptions, plot these locations on a map, record the latitude and longitude for each, and plan their course from one location to the next. Then have them estimate the distance between locations, using the string and a map scale.\n\nWhen teams have completed their routes, have them exchange maps and recording charts to compare Checkpoint locations and estimated distances. Then, as a class, come up with the shortest route possible.\n\nAs an extension, you can have students convert the estimated distances from statute miles to nautical miles.\n\nBecause the Checkpoint Destinations are open-ended, the locations and courses students choose will vary (see sample course below). When students present their locations, courses and estimated distances, they should be able to explain why each location matches the Checkpoint description, how they chose the course, and the method they used for estimating distances. Most maps students will be using show statute miles, the unit of measurement for distances on land. Distances at sea are measured in nautical miles. A nautical mile is found by dividing the Earth into 360 degrees, and then dividing each degree into 60 minutes. One nautical mile equals one minute, or 1/21,600 of the Earth's circumference. Students can convert statute miles to nautical miles by dividing the number of statute miles by 1.1508.\n\nSample Course\n\nBooks\n\nHobden, Heather, and Mervyn Hobden. John Harrison and the Problem of Longitude. Lincoln, England: Cosmic Elk, 1989.\n\nIncludes a history of John Harrison and his invention of the maritime chronometer, which solved the problem of finding longitude at sea.\n\nSobel, Dava. Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time. New York: Walker, 1995.\n\nTakes the reader back to the maritime world of 1714, when finding the solution to the problem of determining longitude at sea was of the highest scientific, political and economic priority.\n\nWeb Sites\n\nNOVA Online—Lost at Sea: The Search for Longitude\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/nova/longitude/\n\nWill include an interactive game that provides a way to understand why knowing the time at your home port allows you to fix your longitude at sea. The site will also feature how the Global Positioning System works, a time line of ancient navigation, and contributions from leading experts on what they believe are some of the greatest scientific challenges of our day. Launch date: Currently available.\n\nThe \"Voyage Around the World\" activity aligns with the following National Science Education Standards and Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics:\n\nGrades 5-8\n\nScience Standard G:\n\nHistory and Nature of Science\n\nScience as a human endeavor\n\nScience requires different abilities, depending on such factors as the field of study and type of inquiry. Science is very much a human endeavor, and the work of science relies on basic human qualities, such as reasoning, insight, energy, skill and creativity—as well as on scientific habits of mind, such as intellectual honesty, tolerance of ambiguity, skepticism and openness to new ideas.\n\nMathematics Standard 7:\n\nComputation and Estimation\n\nMathematics Standard 13:\n\nMeasurement\n\nGrades 9-12\n\nScience Standard G:\n\nHistory and Nature of Science\n\nScience as a human endeavor"
