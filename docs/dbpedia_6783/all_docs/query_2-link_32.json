        "text": "The spatial and temporal uncertainty of water availability is one of the major challenges in water resource management. Understanding patterns and identifying trends in seasonal to annual precipitation are very important for water infrastructure management. In particular, forecasts that incorporate such information can be used to inform decisions about the operation of multipurpose reservoir systems in the face of changing climate conditions.\n\nSuccess in making useful forecasts is often achieved by considering climate teleconnections such as the ElÂ NiÃ±oâSouthern OscillationÂ (ENSO) as related to sea surface temperature variations and air pressure over the globe using empirical data (Amarasekera et al., 1997; Denise et al., 2017; Korecha and Sorteberg, 2013; Seibert et al., 2017). Also, modes of variability of other tropical oceans can be related to regional precipitation (Dettinger and Diaz, 2000; Eden et al., 2015; Maity and NageshÂ Kumar, 2006; Malmgren et al., 2007; Ranatunge et al., 2003; Suppiah, 1996; Roplewski and Halpert, 1996). For example, the effect of the Indian Ocean DipoleÂ (IOD) is identified as independent of the ENSO effect (Eden et al., 2015). Pacific decadal oscillationÂ (PDO), Atlantic multi-decadal mode oscillationÂ (AMO), ENSO, and IOD teleconnections to precipitation have been found by many studies over the globe. Variations in precipitation in the United States are explained by ENSO, PDO, and AMO (Eden et al., 2015; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017; Ward et al., 2014); in African countries by ENSO, AMO, and IOD (Reason et al., 2006); and in southeastern Asian countries by ENSO: Indonesia (Lee, 2015; Nur'utami and Hidayat, 2016), Thailand (Singhrattna et al., 2005b), China (Cao et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2014), Australia (Bureau of Meteorology, 2012; Verdon and Franks, 2005), and central and south Asia (Gerlitz et al., 2016).\n\nThe impact of ENSO and IOD on the position of the intertropical convergence zoneÂ (ITCZ) has been identified as a primary factor driving south Asian tropical climate variations. South Asian countries get precipitation from two monsoons from the movements of ITCZ in boreal summer (2ââN) and boreal winter (8ââS). The southwestern monsoon (summer monsoon) is during JuneâAugust and the northeastern monsoon (winter monsoon) is during DecemberâFebruary (Schneider et al., 2014). Climate teleconnections have been studied for summer monsoons (Singhrattna et al., 2005a; Surendran et al., 2015) and winter monsoons (Zubair and Ropelewski, 2006). A negative correlation of ENSO with the Indian summer monsoon has been identified (Jha et al., 2016; Surendran et al., 2015).\n\nThe objective of this study is to explore the climate teleconnection to dual monsoons and inter-monsoons. Water resource management decisions are typically based on precipitation throughout the year, and it is extremely important to explore the possibility that rainfall might be related to teleconnection indices for which seasonal forecasts are available. Sri Lanka is a south Asian country that gets rainfall from two monsoons and two inter-monsoons. We explore ENSO and IOD climate teleconnection to Sri Lanka precipitation throughout the year. Past studies have identified a climate teleconnection linking precipitation to climate indices for several months and monsoon seasons, and shown the importance of these for forecasting rainfall in river basins (Chandimala and Zubair, 2007; Chandrasekara et al., 2017). We extend these analyses across monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons.\n\nAlthough rainfall anomalies may be correlated strongly with teleconnection indices, the scatter in the data can be large, making predictions from regression models have high uncertainty. However, water managers may act on information about whether rainfall is expected to be abnormally low or high. Seasonal precipitation is generally forecasted in broad categories. For example, the USÂ National Weather Service forecasts seasonal precipitation as above normal, below normal, and normal (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2018). The International Research Institute for Climate and Society also forecasts seasonal precipitation as above, below, and near normal (International Research Institute for Climate Society, 2018). We chose to follow a similar approach and investigate river basin rainfall teleconnections to climate indices with classification models. If reasonably accurate relationships can be developed, they will be useful for water resource management. For example, in Sri Lanka decisions about allocations of water for irrigation and hydropower could be improved with estimates of when low rainfall seasons are likely.\n\nSri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean (latitude 5â55â²â9â50â²âN, longitude 79â40â²â81â53â²âE). Mean annual rainfall varies from 880Â to 5500âmm across the island. The rainfall distribution is determined by the monsoon system of the Indian Ocean interacting with the elevated land mass in the interior of the country. The country is divided into three climatic zones according to the rainfall distribution: humid zone (wet zone) (annual rainfallâ>â2500âmm), intermediate zone (2500âmmâ<ârainfallâ<â1750âmm), and arid zone (dry zone) (rainfallâ<â1750âmm) (Department of Agriculture Sri Lanka, 2017).\n\nSri Lanka, a water-rich country, has 103Â river basins varying from 9Â to 10â448âkm2. A large fraction of the water resource management infrastructure of the country is associated with the Mahaweli and Kelani River basins. The catchment areas of the Mahaweli and Kelani are 10â448Â and 2292âkm2, respectively. The two rivers start from the central highlands. Mahaweli, the longest river, travels to the ocean 331âkm in the eastern direction and the Kelani 145âkm in the western direction. Average annual discharge volume for the Mahaweli and Kelani basins is 26â368Ã106 and 8660Ã106âm3 respectively (Manchanayake and MaddumaÂ Bandara, 1999). The Kelani River basin is totally inside the humid zone, whereas the Mahaweli River basin migrates through all three climate zones (Fig.Â 1).\n\nThe temporal pattern of rainfall in Sri Lanka can be divided into four seasons as follows.\n\nGenerally there is low precipitation across the country from the northeastern monsoonÂ (NEM), which includes most precipitation during January to February. The arid zone of the country receives significant precipitation from the NEM, while the humid zone receives very little rainfall during this period.\n\nThe whole country receives precipitation from the first inter-monsoonÂ (FIM) during March to April. However, rainfall during this period is not very high across the country.\n\nThe highest precipitation for the country is from the southwestern monsoonÂ (SWM) during May to September. However, only the humid zone receives high precipitation during this season.\n\nThe whole country receives precipitation from the second inter-monsoonÂ (SIM) during October to December. Generally, precipitation from SIM is higher thanÂ FIM.\n\nThe time periods of the NEM and SIM are generally considered to be December to February and October to November, respectively (Department of Meteorology Sri Lanka, 2017; Malmgren et al., 2003; Ranatunge et al., 2003). However, considering the bulk amount of water received from the monsoon, we consider January and February as the period of NEM and October to December as the period ofÂ SIM.\n\nReflecting the rainfall seasons, the country has two agriculture seasons: âYalaâ (AprilâSeptember) and âMahaâ (OctoberâMarch). Because the arid zone receives minimal precipitation during the SWM, the agricultural systems (165â000âha) developed under the Mahaweli multipurpose project depend on irrigation water during the Yala season. The country depends on stored water to drive hydropower year round. The Mahaweli and Kelani hydropower plants of 810Â and 335âMW capacity serve as peaking and contingency reserve power to the power system (Ceylon Electricity Board, 2015). Management of reservoir systems is performed to cater to both irrigation and hydropower requirements.\n\n2.1âSubbasin rainfall (areal rainfall)\n\nMonthly rainfall data for the yearsÂ 1950â2013 are used for the study (Ceylon Electricity Board, 2017). River basin rainfall was calculated using the Thiessen polygon method (Viessman, 2002). The Mahaweli River basin is divided into 16Â Thiessen polygons and the Kelani River basin is divided into 11Â Thiessen polygons (Fig.Â 1). Since this study does not aim to explore rainfall across subbasins, we do not use digital elevation maps to define the subbasins. Considering the importance of subbasins for the reservoir catchment and for water use, eight subbasins are selected for analysis. Morape, Randenigala, Peradeniya, Manampitiya, and Bowatenna represent the major Mahaweli reservoir catchments and irrigation tanks, and Norton Bridge, Norwood, and Laxapana represent the Kelani basin reservoir catchments. The catchment of the major Mahaweli River reservoir cascade (Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe, Bowatenna) is represented by Morape and Peradeniya located in the humid zone and by Randenigala and Bowatenna located in the intermediate zone. The major arid zone irrigation catchments of the Mahaweli are represented by Manampitiya. The catchment of the Kelaniya reservoir cascade (Norton Bridge and Moussakele) in the humid zone is represented by Laxapana, Norton Bridge, and Norwood.\n\nWe calculate the rainfall for the four seasons, NEM, FIM, SWM, and SIM for 64Â years of historical data. Rainfall anomalies are calculated by reducing the seasonal mean rainfall (Eq.Â 1) and standardized anomalies are calculated by dividing the rainfall anomalies by the standard deviationÂ (SD) (Eq.Â 2).\n\n(1) X ANM = X - X â¾ t\n\n(2) X S _ ANM = X - X â¾ t / SD t\n\nHere Xâ¾t Â is the average of seasonal rainfall, XANMÂ is the rainfall anomaly, and XS_ANM is the standardized rainfall anomaly.\n\nStandardized rainfall anomalies are divided into three classes as dry, average, and wet (TableÂ 1). A normality test for the rainfall data classes is performed using the ShapiroâWilk test. If the rainfall data are not normally distributed, logâ(e), square root or square functions are used to transform the data into normally distributed data sets (Fig.Â A1). Extreme seasonal precipitation has been defined statistically in different ways using statistical thresholds (Easterling et al., 2000; Jentsch et al., 2007; Smith, 2011). We use 0.5Â as a threshold to define three classes, which results in fairly evenly distributed data across the three classes (Fig.Â A2).\n\n2.2âENSO and IOD indices\n\nThe ENSO phenomenon is represented by the multivariate ENSO index (MEI) and NINO34, NINO3, and NINO4 indices, and the Indian Ocean Dipole phenomenon is represented by the dipole mode index (DMI) index. The NINO34, NINO3, and NINO4 indices are based on tropical sea surface temperature anomalies (National Center for Atmospheric Research, 2018), and the multivariate ENSO indexÂ (MEI) is based on sea-level pressure, zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, sea surface temperature, surface air temperature, and total cloudiness fraction of the sky (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017). The Indian Ocean DipoleÂ (IOD) is an oscillation of sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean between the Arabian Sea and south of Indonesia (Bureau of Meteorology, 2017). The IOD is identified as relevant to the climate of Australia (Power et al., 1999) and countries surrounded by the Indian Ocean in southern Asia (Chaudhari et al., 2013; Maity and NageshÂ Kumar, 2006; Qiu et al., 2014; Surendran et al., 2015). The dipole mode indexÂ (DMI) is used to represent the IOD capturing the west and eastern equatorial sea surface temperature gradient.\n\nData used for the analyses are NINO34, NINO3, NINO4, and MEI monthly data from the yearsÂ 1950â2013 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2017; National Center for Atmospheric Research, 2018) and the DMI monthly data from 1950 to 2013 (HadISST data set, Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology, 2019). Because we analyzed the data in rainfall seasons, values of the climate indices over the season are averaged. For example for the NEM season, the MEI value is the average of January and February monthly values and for the SWM season, DMI is the average of May, June, July, and September values.\n\nSeasonal values of MEI and DMI were used as the predictors to classify seasons into the three rainfall classes. The total data set is divided into 75â% for training the model and 25â% for testing model performance. Quadratic discriminant analysisÂ (QDA) and classification trees were selected for the analyses. A random forest model also was applied to investigate the reliability of a cross-validated statistical forecast tool based on an advance estimate of MEI and DMI. We used the RÂ programming language to carry out the statistical analyses. RÂ packages caret, tree, randomForest, fitdistriplus, devtools, and quantreg are used for the studies.\n\n3.1âQuadratic discriminant analysisÂ (QDA)\n\nThe mathematical formulation of QDA can be derived from the Bayes theorem assuming that observations from each class are drawn from a Gaussian distribution (James et al., 2013; LÃ¶we et al., 2016).\n\nThe prior probabilityÂ Ïk represents the randomly chosen observation coming from the kthÂ class with density functionÂ fk(x). The Bayes theorem states that\n\n(3) Pr ( Y = k | X = x ) = - Ï k f k ( x ) â l = 1 K Ï l f l ( x ) .\n\nIn Eq.Â (3), the posterior probability Pr(Y=k|X=x) indicates that observation X=x belongs to the kthÂ class. For pÂ predictors, the multivariate Gaussian distribution density function is defined for every classÂ k (Eq.Â 4).\n\nfk(x)=-1(2Ï)p/2Î£k1/2(4)exp-12x-Î¼kTÎ£k-1x-Î¼k\n\nIn Eq.Â (2), Î£kÂ is the covariance matrix and Î¼xÂ is the mean vector. The covariance matrixÂ (Î£k) and meanÂ (Î¼x) for each class are estimated from the training data set (Eqs.Â 5 andÂ 6).\n\n(5)Î¼k=-1Nkâi:yi=kxi(6)Î£k=-1Nk-1âi:yi=kxi-Î¼kTxi-Î¼k\n\nSubstituting a Gaussian density function for the kthÂ class (Eq.Â 4) into the Bayes theorem and taking the log values, the quadratic discriminant function is derived (Eq.Â 7). Prior probabilities for classÂ kÂ (Ïk) are calculated by the frequency of data points of classÂ k in the training data (Eq.Â 8). For a total number of NÂ points in the training observations, NkÂ is the number of observations belonging to the kthÂ class.\n\n(7)Î´k(x)=-12x-Î¼xTâk-1x-Î¼x+logÏk(8)Ïk=-NkN\n\nCovariance, mean, and prior probability values are inserted into the discriminant functionÂ (Î´k(x)) together with the state variables (Eq.Â 5). The corresponding class is selected according to the largest value of the function. The number of parameters to be estimated for the QDA model for kÂ classes and pÂ predictors is kpâ (p+1)/2 . For this study, the QDA model output is the probability that an observation of a climate category will fall into each of the rainfall classes.\n\n3.2âClassification tree model\n\nFor the classification tree model the predictor space is divided into nonoverlapping regions (R1ââ¦âRj). A classification tree predicts each observation as belonging to the most commonly occurring class of the training data regions (James et al., 2013). Recursive binary splitting is used to grow the classification tree.\n\nClassification error rate, Gini index, and cross-entropy are typically used to evaluate the quality of a particular split (James et al., 2013), and in our study we used the first two indices. Classification error rateÂ (E) gives fraction of observations that do not belong to the most commonly occurring class of the training data regions (Eq.Â 9). However, for the tree growing, the Gini indexÂ (G) is considered to be the criterion for splitting into regions (Eq.Â 10):\n\n(9)E=1-maxkp^mk,(10)G=âk=1Kp^mk1-p^mk.\n\nIn Eqs.Â (9) andÂ (10), p^mk Â represents the fraction of observations in the mthÂ class that belong to the kthÂ class. The Gini index is considered to be a measure of node purity of the tree model, since small values of the index indicate that node has a higher number of observations from a single class.\n\nThe complexity of the trees is adjusted using a pruning process to produce more interpretable results. Complex trees reduce training error by overfitting the training data. Simple trees can be interpreted well; however, selecting a model which can find the pattern of data is important. In order to achieve the low classification error (training error plus testing error), a pruning technique is used. First, grow the very large tree, and sub-tree is obtained by removing the weak links of the tree. Using a tuning parameter to examine the trade-off between complexity of tree and the training error and defining minimum samples for a node, maximum depth of the tree, and maximum number of terminal nodes are some of the pruning methods (Analytical Vidhya Team, 2016). For this study, we defined the maximum number of nodes to obtain the simple tree (pruned tree).\n\nTree models give the probability that an observation falls into each of the three rainfall classes. The predicted class is assigned based on the highest probability. Tree models handle ties of probability values by randomly assigning the class.\n\n3.3âRandom forest\n\nA random forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression problems. The method is based on a multitude of decision trees based on training data with the final model as the mean of the ensemble (Breiman, 2001). Individual trees are built on a random sample of the training data with several predictors from the total number of predictors. Individual trees are built from the bootstrapped training data set.\n\nThere are some features that can be tuned to make the better performed random forest model. Maximum number of predictors from the total predictors for individual trees, maximum number of trees, maximum node size of the trees, and minimum sample leaf size are some of these features (Analytical Vidhya Team, 2015). In our study, we use the maximum number of trees as the main tuning parameter.\n\nIn a random forest model the importance of the variable is measured as the decrease in node impurity from the splits over the variable. This value is calculated by averaging the Gini index over the multitude of trees with a larger value indicating high importance of the predictor (James et al., 2013).\n\nMonthly rainfall box plots of eight subbasins over the year forÂ 1950â2013 illustrate the seasonal and the spatial variation in rainfall patterns (Fig.Â 2). The largest fraction of total rainfall in the arid zone occurs at the end of the SIM (December) and during the NEM (JanuaryâFebruary) with correspondingly high variability, whereas there is little rainfall in the arid zone during the SWM (MayâSeptember) with correspondingly little variability (Fig.Â 2h). The intermediate zone receives approximately 60â% of total rainfall from the SIM and NEM. Although the variability of the rainfall is low in the intermediate zone, high rainfall can occur in all seasons (Fig.Â 2c andÂ d). In the humid zone, a large portion of rainfall occurs in SWM and early months of the SIM (OctoberâNovember). High variability of humid zone rainfall is observed at the end of the FIM (April), in the SWM (MayâSeptember), and at the start of the SIM (October) (Fig.Â 2a,Â b,Â eâg).\n\nSimilar to other investigators, we observe several strong correlations between rainfall anomalies and the climate indices (TablesÂ A1 andÂ A2 and Appendix). Higher correlation values between MEI and rainfall anomalies can be seen compared to the correlation with other ENSO indices (TableÂ 1). In addition, rainfall in the SWM is very important for stations in the humid zone of the country which is the source of a large amount of water stored in reservoirs (TableÂ A2). Correlation coefficients between SWM rainfall at Norton Bridge are negative and strong, â0.31Â for MEI (p=0.01) and â0.37Â for DMI (p<0.01). The strength of the correlation notwithstanding, the residuals from a regression model indicate that high uncertainty would be associated with any forecast (Fig.Â 3). Thus, we are led to explore the efficacy of classification methods (Appendix).\n\nWe present classification results for two subbasins, one that has the highest rainfall during the NEM, Manampitiya, and one that has the highest rainfall for the SWM, Norton Bridge (Fig.Â 4). Norton Bridge represents the areal rainfall of reservoir catchments in the wet zone and Manampitiya represents the rainfall that contributes to irrigation tanks in the dry zone. Results of other subbasins are presented in the Appendix (Figs.Â A4âA7, Appendix). Because MEI has a higher correlation with rainfall anomalies than other ENSO indices, classification was done with only MEI and Â MI.\n\nThe SWM is a season when the humid zone receives the bulk of rainfall. At Norton Bridge, the occurrences of the dry rainfall anomaly class in the SWM are seen to âclumpâ in the region of relatively high MEI and DMI. Both the classification tree and the QDA successfully identify the pattern (Fig.Â 4a andÂ c) with an overall accuracy of 73â%, 19Â and 16Â correct out of 22Â occurrences (TableÂ 2). In the arid zone the NEM season is one of the most important for rainfall. At Manampitiya, the MEI provides the primary variable in the classification, with the dry anomaly class being correctly selected in 52â% by tree model and 95â% with the QDA model. The results suggest that it may be possible to identify seasons when it is expected to be anomalously dry. The correct classification of âaverageâ conditions likely has less importance for water managers. We explored classification using two classes, âdryâ and ânot dryâ. In this case, the classification model again correctly classifies 86â% of the anonymously dry cases and gets more than 69â% of the not dry cases correct (Fig.Â 5).\n\nClassification trees are known to be unstable. That is, small changes in the observations can lead to large changes in the decision tree. The random forest approach overcomes the issue by building a âbagâ of trees from bootstrap samples. The robustness of the model can then be checked by considering the âout-of-bagâ error. The results of the random forest indicate that predictions of three rainfall anomaly classes using MEI and DMI are not feasible (TableÂ 3). The out-of-bag error rate is close to two-thirds, which for three categories is equivalent to a random selection.\n\nHowever, the results of the random forest for a classification as either dry or not dry suggest that there may be skill in such a prediction. The out-of-bag error rates for this case range from 22â% to 38â% for Norton Bridge and Manampitiya (TableÂ 3) and from 20â% to 39â% across all stations (TableÂ A7).\n\nThe QDA method produces results that are promising with respect to identification of extreme dry events as indicated by seasonal rainfall (TableÂ 5).\n\nUnderstanding seasonal rainfall variability across the spatially diverse Mahaweli and Kelani River basins is important for irrigation and hydropower water planning. The SWM and SIM are the key rainfall seasons for subbasins in the humid zone (Norton Bridge, Morape, Peradeniya, and Laxapana), delivering 80â% of annual rainfall (Fig.Â 2a, b, e, f). For the arid zone (Manampitiya) and intermediate zone (Randenigala, Bowatenna) subbasins, the major season is SIM, which delivers more than 40â% of annual rainfall (Fig.Â 2c, d, h). The arid zone also receives rainfall during the NEM (24â% of annual rainfall at Manampitiya) and the intermediate zone receives rainfall during the SWM (25â%â30â% of annual rainfall at Randenigala and Bowatenna).\n\nClimate teleconnection indices are related to rainfall anomalies observed during the two main growing seasons, Yala and Maha. The Maha agriculture season (OctoberâMarch) depends on rain from the SIM and NEM. During ElÂ NiÃ±o events rainfall increases for the first 3 months of the Maha season (SIM: OctoberâDecember) (Figs.Â A4, A5, A6, A8) (Ropelewski and Halpert, 1995) and decreases during the last 3 months (NEM: JanuaryâMarch) (Fig.Â 4b). In the Yala season (AprilâSeptember), LaÂ NiÃ±a events enhance the rainfall during the SWM (Figs.Â 4a,Â c, A4, A5, A6, A8) (Whitaker et al., 2001). During ElÂ NiÃ±o events the SWM rainfall is reduced (Figs.Â 4a, c, A8, A9) (Chandrasekara et.al, 2017; Chandimala and Zubair, 2007; Zubair, 2003). The ElÂ NiÃ±o impact during the SWM is not as significant as it is during the NEM season (International Research Institute, 2017a). We find, however, that there is an interaction between two teleconnection indices, MEI and IOD for SWM rainfall. During the Yala season there is a high probability of having a drought when both the IOD and MEI are positive (Fig.Â 5). Also, not having drought is probable when both the IOD and MEI are negative (Figs.Â 5, A8,Â A9).\n\nClassification of wet, average, and dry rainfall anomalies using the MEI and DMI indices is successful. For example, a dry SWM season for Norton Bridge (TableÂ 2) and other humid zone stations (TableÂ A4) is classified correctly with greater than 70â% accuracy with QDA and tree models. However, a random forest approach demonstrates that there is little skill in identifying a full wetâaverageâdry classification. However, a random forest model using only two rainfall categories shows more than 60â% accuracy in identifying dry and not dry classes of key rainfall seasons of the humid zone (TablesÂ 4 andÂ A7). Similarly, for arid zone locations such as Manampitiya, the dry rainfall class identification for NEM and SIM seasons is about 60â% (TablesÂ 4 andÂ A7).\n\nOur statistical classification models can be combined with MEI and DMI forecasts to indicate the season-ahead expectation for rainfall. ENSO forecasts are available from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (International Research Institute, 2017b) and IOD forecasts are available in the Bureau of MeteorologyÂ (BOM), Australian Government (Bureau of Meteorology, 2017). ENSO and IOD predictions are also associated with the uncertainty. Therefore, final forecast accuracy is a combination of the MEI, DMI forecast uncertainties, and model's accuracy rate in each class. Although overall prediction accuracy is not extremely high, a forecast of an anomalously low rainfall season can have value for risk-averse farmers (Cabrera et al., 2007) and can guide plans for hydropower management (Block and Goddard, 2012).\n\nThe electricity and agriculture sectors of Sri Lanka heavily rely on Mahaweli and Kelani River water resources so season-ahead forecasts of abnormally low rainfall should be useful for decisions on adaptation measures. For example, water availability of the first 3 months of a growing season is important for crop selection and the extent of land to be cultivated. Hydropower planning and scheduling of maintenance of the power plants can also benefit from season-ahead forecasts. The damage that can occur due to incorrect rainfall forecasts in the agriculture and energy sectors can be minimized with emergency planning during the season, which is the usual practice.\n\nAlthough the accuracy of predicting low or not low seasonal rainfall is not very high, decisions based on forecasts that are improvements over climate averages should be an improvement over current practices. The accuracy of statistical models can be improved with longer records, which are important to train the classification models. Also, models can be fine-tuned for important shorter periods such as crop planting months and harvesting months for irrigation water planning.\n\nAmarasekera, K. N., Lee, R. F., Williams, E.
