        "text": "This is a case study that shows how the Indian Ocean was a major maritime hub up to the 15th century and was gradually replaced by the Atlantic Ocean after the discovery of the Americas by the Europeans and Christopher Columbus. The Arabs and Chinese played a major role in it up to 1433, but for domestic political reasons, the Chinese dropped all practice of ocean navigation and commerce even before the arrival of the Europeans, which contributed to its decline. Right now we are witnessing a reversal, both the come-back of the Indian Ocean as a crucial global area as well as the come-back of the Chinese as the main actor in this area in the present global context. We are going to show striking similarities between the two historical periods (pre-14th century and 21st century). We will consider the central features of this form of the evolution of the Indian Ocean and consider it in terms of the basic perspective of recent post-civil-conflict in Sri Lanka.\n\nThis article investigates the period before Sri Lanka was engulfed by civil war and ethnic strife and how things changed so rapidly following colonial rule. Sri Lanka’s independence was seen as a model to be followed in the decolonisation of the British Empire due to the island’s peace, prosperity, indigenous leadership and its preference for British institutions. However, behind this façade the years surrounding Sri Lankan independence also saw the foundations for the vicious civil war that has dominated all recent coverage of this Indian Ocean state. This article assesses how warning signs were misread or ignored and how early political decisions in this era forged the beginnings of the future problems ahead."
