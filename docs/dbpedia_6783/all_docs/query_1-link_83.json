        "text": "Study in Sri Lanka\n\nIf you are looking for somewhere to complete your higher education, begin a rewarding career path and experience the diverse culture of Asia, then Sri Lanka should be on the top of your list. With centres offering world class education at affordable prices, a comparatively low cost of living and a multicultural, multi-lingual society, an education in Sri Lanka will perfectly suit your needs.\n\nSri Lanka is an island country in the northern Indian Ocean off the coast of South India in South Asia. Approximately 100 American students study abroad in Sri Lanka each year. Sri Lanka is a diverse country, home to many religions, ethnicities and languages where Sinhala and Tamil are the official languages, but English is widely spoken. Sri Lanka has a rich Buddhist heritage, and the first known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka date back to 29 BC. Sri Lanka contains tropical forests and diverse landscapes with a high amount of biodiversity, more reasons students consider study abroad in Sri Lanka.\n\nBelow you will find our list of Study Abroad programs in Sri Lanka. It is an index to international education in Sri Lanka listing university level study abroad, internships, volunteer and intensive language school programs oriented to American college and university students. Some pre-college and post-graduate options are also included. We invite you to read the student reviews, see the ratings scores and use this site to compare programs and understand what other students have encountered during their education abroad.\n\nHigher Education in Sri Lanka\n\nHigher education in Sri Lanka is strictly controlled by the government. At one time, the government actually owned all of the institutions of higher learning. Now there are four types of higher education institutes of learning.\n\nPublic institutes controlled by the University Grants Commission\n\nPublic institutes not controlled by the University Grants Commission\n\nPrivate non-profit institutes\n\nPrivate institutes\n\nWhile there are private institutions of higher learning, these are very difficult to find, and they seem to be autonomous only in theory. In one way or the other, they are all ruled by the Sri Lankan government and are monitored closely.\n\nLiving in Sri Lanka\n\nTuition Fees\n\nOne of the best parts about higher education in Sr. Lanka is the low cost. Compared to other countries, Sri Lanka's education fees for higher learning are very inexpensive. This offers a cheaper alternative to going to school in a more expensive European school. They are most known for a program they call \"twinning,\" whereby students are allowed to couple their educational plan with other universities in Australia, the UK, or the US, by completing one year in Sri Lanka, and the other two or three in these countries. This saves them up to $50,000 in tuition overall by following this plan and they acquire a diverse education.\n\nAbout Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka, officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in the northern Indian Ocean off the southern coast of the Indian subcontinent in South Asia. Known until 1972 as Ceylon, Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the southwest. It is the only country in South Asia that is currently rated 'high' on the Human Development Index. Main economic sectors of the country are tourism, tea export, clothing, rice production, and other agricultural products. In addition to these economic sectors, overseas employment contributes highly in foreign exchange, most of them from the Middle East.\n\nSri Lanka is an island in the Indian Ocean off the Southeastern tip of India. For this reason, it is called the \"pearl of the Indian Ocean.\" The land is flat and rolling, featuring lovely mountains in the south-central region which rise to over 8000 feet. Tourists are attracted to Sri Lanka for the sunny beaches, rainforests, and lovely vistas.\n\nEssential Facts about Sri Lanka\n\nSri Lanka is a middle income developing nation.\n\nThey have a per capita income of $1355.\n\nAbout one-fourth of the nation's population is considered impoverished.\n\nThe current population is 19.8 million.\n\nThey have a working government but have been in the midst of civil unrest for over 30 years.\n\nDespite the dark history of unrest which continues today, they are a country which is politically sound.\n\nTheir economy is in trouble but they keep the cost of living low, so people who are more middle class can do well financially in Sri Lanka.\n\nClimate\n\nThe climate of Sri Lanka varies dependent more upon the altitude rather than the latitude. Much of the country is tropical but hot and the climate fluctuates between dry and rainy seasons. There are some monsoons and many of the rains come from either monsoon, convectional showers, or tropical storms. In December of 2004, a tsunami hit the coast of Sri Lanka killing some 32,000 people and doing over $1 billion in damage.\n\nReligion\n\nA variety of diverse religions are practiced in Sri Lanka. In a recent census, there were reportedly 70.2% Theravada Buddhists, 12.6% Hindus, 9.7% Muslims, 7.4% Christians, and a small percentage of other religions being practiced. In a 2008 Gallup poll, Sri Lanka was ranked the 3rd most religious country in the world. In a recent survey of the Sri Lankan people, 99% of Sri Lankans reported that religion was an important part of their daily lives.\n\nStudent visa for Sri Lanka\n\nEligibility for Student Visas\n\nStudents who plan a program of study from a government accepted school of higher education are allowed to apply for a student visa which will be approved by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship.
