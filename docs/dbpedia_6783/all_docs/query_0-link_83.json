This report evaluates Sri Lanka's new geodetic coordinate system (SLD99) by comparing it to the old system using control points that are common to both systems. Several methods are used to determine transformation parameters between the systems and compute coordinates in the new system from the old. The best method is identified by comparing residual errors, with the 7-parameter Bursa-Wolf formula providing the most accurate transformation of coordinates between the two datums.",
