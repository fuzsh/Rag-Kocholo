        "text": "Continental climate\n\nThe enormous expanse of Asia and its abundance of mountain barriers and inland depressions have resulted in great differences between regions in solar radiation, atmospheric circulation, precipitation, and climate as a whole. A continental climate, associated with large landmasses and characterized by an extreme annual range of temperature, prevails over a large part of Asia. Air reaching Asia from the Atlantic Ocean, after passing over Europe or Africa, has had time to be transformed into continental air—i.e., air that has often lost much of the moisture it absorbed over the ocean. As a result of the prevalent eastward movement of the air masses in the midlatitudes, as well as the isolating effect of the marginal mountain ranges, the influence of sea air from the Pacific Ocean extends only to the eastern margins of Asia. From the north, Arctic air has unimpeded access into the continent. In the south, tropical and equatorial air masses predominate, but their penetration to the centre of Asia is restricted by the ridges of the moutainous belt stretching from the highlands of West Asia through the Himalayas to the mountains of southern China and Southeast Asia; in the winter months (November through March), such penetration is further impeded by the density of the cold air masses over the interior.\n\nThe contrast between the strong heating of the continent in the summer months (May to September) and the chilling in winter produces sharp seasonal variations in atmospheric circulation and also enhances the role of local centres of atmospheric activity. Winter chilling of the Asian landmass develops a persistent high-pressure winter anticyclone over Siberia, Mongolia, and the Plateau of Tibet that is normally centred southwest of Lake Baikal. The area affected by the anticyclone is characterized by temperature inversions and by very cold, calm weather with little snowfall. The winter anticyclone is fed by subsiding upper air, by bursts of Arctic air flowing in from the north, and by the persistent westerly air drift that accompanies the gusty cyclonic low-pressure cells operating within the Northern Hemisphere cyclonic storm system. The high pressure propels cold, dry air eastward and southward out of the continent, affecting eastern and southern Asia during the winter. Only a few of the winter cyclonic lows moving eastward out of Europe carry clear across Asia, but they do bring more frequent changes in weather in western Siberia than in central Siberia. The zone of lowest temperature—a so-called cold pole—is found in the northeast, near Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, where temperatures as low as −90 °F (−68 °C) and −96 °F (−71 °C), respectively, have been recorded.\n\nThe outward drift of winter air creates a sharp temperature anomaly in eastern and northeastern Asia, where the climate is colder than the characteristic global average for each given latitude. On the East Asian islands, the effect of the winter continental monsoon is tempered by the surrounding seas. As the air masses pass over the seas, they become warmed and saturated with moisture, which then falls as either snow or rain on the northwestern slopes of the island arcs. Occasionally, however, strong bursts of cold air carry cold spells as far south as Hong Kong and Manila.\n\nThe polar front\n\nCyclonic storms form and move eastward through the zone where the temperate and tropical air masses are in contact, called the polar front, which shifts southward in winter. The winter rainy season in the southern parts of the West Asian highlands, which is characteristic of the Mediterranean climate, is associated with that southward movement of the polar front. In northern areas of West and Middle Asia, the effect of cyclonic action is particularly strong in the spring, when the polar front moves north and causes the maximum in annual precipitation to occur then.\n\nDuring the northern winter, South and Southeast Asia are affected by northeasterly winds that blow from high-pressure areas of the North Pacific Ocean to the equatorial low-pressure zone. Those winds are analogous to the trade winds and are known in South Asia as the northeast (or winter) monsoon. The weather is dry and moderately warm. Rainfall occurs only on the windward side of maritime regions (e.g., Tamil Nadu state in southeastern India and southern Vietnam). Some of the cyclonic storms that move eastward through the Mediterranean Basin during the winter are deflected south of the Plateau of Tibet, crossing northern India and southwestern China. Such storms do not often bring winter rain, but they create short periods of cloudy, cool, or gusty weather and are accompanied by snow in the higher mountain ranges.\n\nIn summer the polar front shifts northward, causing cyclonic rains in the mountains of Siberia. In West, Middle, and Central Asia, a hot, dry, dusty, continental tropical wind blows at that time. Over the basin of the Indus River, the heating creates a low-pressure area. Known as the South Asian (or Iranian) low, it appears in April and is fully developed from June to August. The onset of monsoon in India and mainland Southeast Asia is related to changes in the circulation pattern that occur by June—specifically, the disintegration of the southern jet stream and the formation of low pressure over southern Asia. The monsoon air masses flow into that monsoonal low-pressure zone from a cell of high pressure just off the eastern coast of southern Africa. Because of the Coriolis force (the force caused by the Earth’s rotation), winds south of the Equator change direction from southeast to southwest in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The southwest monsoon bursts upon the Malabar Coast of southwestern India in early June and gradually extends northward over most of the Indian subcontinent and mainland Southeast Asia. It brings considerable rainfall, which in most of those areas accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the total annual precipitation.\n\nIn eastern Asia the Pacific Ocean polar front creates atmospheric disturbances during the summer. From a summer high-pressure centre over the western Pacific, the warm and moist summer monsoon blows from the southeast toward the continent. To the south of latitude 38° N, where the warm Kuroshio (Japan Current) approaches the coast of Japan, the summer monsoon brings protracted rains and high humidity; together with high temperatures, that creates a hothouse atmosphere. Becoming chilled as it passes over cold ocean currents to the north, that air brings fogs and drizzling rains to northeastern Asia."
