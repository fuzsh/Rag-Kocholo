        "text": "climate change is a global crisis impacting the entire world. in July 2023, the severity of this crisis became clearly evident, as it marked the hottest month ever recorded in history. Sri Lanka in particular, faces a critical situation, with temperatures soaring to unprecedented levels, surpassing the global average by about 1.8 °c per decade. These changes have important implications for the country's food security, particularly during the two main cultivating seasons, Dry (March-September) and Wet (october-february), especially in terms of crop production. This study employed the Mann-Kendall Trend test, Sen's slope estimator, Coefficient of Variations (cV), and Z statistics to examine the trends in rainfall in the Dry and Wet seasons using data from 13 rain guage stations encompassing all three climatic zones (Wet, intermediate and Dry) from 1994 to 2020. notably, in the Dry season, two rain gauge stations Anuradhapura and Mahailluppallama in the Dry Zone (DZ), exhibited a significant increasing trend, and a majority of the stations showed an increasing trend potentially linked to the growing occurrence of extreme rainfall events. conversely, none of the rain gauge stations showed a notable trend, but a majority of the stations showed a decreasing trend in the Wet seasons. While a north-South gradient is discernible, the diversity of trends observed in different regions highlighted the need for localized climate studies bolstered by cutting-edge climate models that peer into Sri Lanka's climate future. Such knowledge would better support climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, securing a sustainable future for Sri Lanka.\n\nIn this study, the rainfall variability and trend of the Northern Region of Sri Lanka (NRSL) isexamined. Long term monthly rainfall data (1881-2015) were obtained for sixrain gauge stations of Jaffna, Mannar, Kanukkeni, Vavuniya, Pavatkulam and Muttayankaddu. To study the inter-annual and decadal variability and trend, Coefficient of Variation (CV), least square trendand Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were used as descriptors of rainfall variability. The SPI had computed for 1, 2, and 3-month time scale for all six rain gauge stations.The mean annual rainfall of NRSL is 1233mm and its CV range is varies spatially from 24.8% to 33.1%. The analysis demonstrates the intensity of flood, drought and normal years. Out of 135 years,40 years were experienced as flood and 20 years as drought. The probability flood year is 0.296 and drought year0.148. The study revealed that the occurrences of flood years are more (30%) than the drought years (15%). The decadal variability and trend of rainfall results revealed that the decreasing trend was prolonged in the decades of 1881-1890, 1901-1910, 1921-30, 1931-40, 1971-80 and 1981-90 and increasing trend noticed in the decades of 1891-1900 and 1951-1960.\n\nSurvival of every species in a place is controlled by weather factors. Rainfall is the important weather parameter that influences all sectors of the economy of the study area viz the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Rainfall pattern of the study area varies from other regions of Sri Lanka. In this respect this study focuses on the trend and distribution of the rainfall in the study area. The main objective of this paper is to discuss the spatial and temporal pattern of the rainfall in the northern province of Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected using direct observation, which helped to identify the spatial variations of the rainfall of the study area. Secondary data were collected mainly from two sources i.e Department of Meteorology and the Statistical Handbook of the Northern Provincial Council. Data related to rainfall from department of meteorology were collected for forty-four years from 1972 for the analysis. Data have been analyzed using excel worksheet and they were mapped using the ARC GIS software 9.1 version to identify the temporal and spatial pattern of the rainfall in the study area. Annual average rainfall of the study area varies from year to year. Seasonally Second Inter Monsoon Season and the North East Monsoon Season receive 85% of rainfall and South West Monsoon Season receives 17% of rainfall. The Months, November, December and January receive 90% of the total rainfall. Spatially eastern part of the study area receives the highest amount of rainfall and the western area receives the lowest amount of rainfall. Number of rainy days decrease year by year and the depression in the Bay of Bengal is the main reason for the92%of the total rainfall of the study area.\n\nAnalysis of long-term rainfall trends provides a wealth of information on effective crop planning and water resource management, and a better understanding of climate variability over time. This study reveals the spatial variability of rainfall trends in Sri Lanka from 1989 to 2019 as an indication of climate change. The exclusivity of the study is the use of rainfall data that provide spatial variability instead of the traditional location-based approach. Henceforth, daily rainfall data available at Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation corrected with stations (CHIRPS) data were used for this study. The geographic information system (GIS) is used to perform spatial data analysis on both vector and raster data. Sen&#39;s slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test are used to investigate the trends in annual and seasonal rainfall throughout all districts and climatic zones of Sri Lanka. The most important thing reflected in this study is that there has been a significant ...\n\nChanges in extreme weather and climate events are among the most serious challenges to society in coping with a changing climate. Occurrence of extreme rainfall events with higher intensity accomplishing flash floods is becoming a common phenomenon. It is timely important, identifying spatial and temporal characteristics of intensity of extreme rainfall events by countries. Maximum 5 day rainfall (Rx-5day) is an effective index which leads to identify intensity of rainfall extreme events, recommended by World Meteorological Organization. This considers the highest total rainfall within a consecutive 5 day period. This study focuses on spatial and temporal characteristics of Rx-5day in Sri Lanka from 1981 to 2010. Daily rainfall data collected from Meteorological Department, Sri Lanka is used in the study and extremes are calculated using RClimDex 1.0 package, designed by Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). IDW interpolation technique in GIS, non-parametric ...\n\nUtilizing over 100 years of rainfall records in 15 meteorology stations, an analysis was carried out to extract the trends of annual rainfall depth in Sri Lanka over the last century. A statistically significant increasing trend of rate 3.15 mm/year was observed at Colombo and decreasing trends were observed at Nuwara Eliya and Kandy with rates of 4.87 mm/year and 2.88 mm/year respectively. Since no coherent increase or decrease of rainfall in any group of stations in the wet or dry zones was observed, the possibility of large scale change over the past century was ruled out. However, more recent data records (1949 onwards), revealed a decreasing trends in 13 of the15 stations. Thus, traces of a temporal change seem to be apparent in the rainfall records over the last half century. In general, the downward trends in recent decades are steeper than the long term variations. For the recent data records, the largest downward trend of 11.16 mm/year was observed at Batticaloa.\n\nClimate change-related changes in temperature and precipitation trends must be investigated at local, regional and global levels. Temperature and precipitation trends in two selected regions having tropical wet and tropical montane climates (i.e., Colombo and Nuwara Eliya respectively) in Sri Lanka were studied for a 30 year period from 1989 to 2019, to evaluate the temporal dynamics of climate change. Precipitation trends were analyzed on annual, monthly, and seasonal scales, while the trends in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures were examined on annual and monthly scales. Decadal time series plots were used to study decadal variations in average temperature and precipitation. The trends in extreme temperature and precipitation events were also evaluated. In addition, the trends in diurnal temperature range (DTR), cool and warm nights, and heat index (HI) were studied. The significance of trends was evaluated using the Mann-Kendall test, while the magnitude of the slope was as...\n\nOne of the most important climatic element is Rainfall, that directly influences on the agriculture. As a real world practice, the rainfall data has a seasonal trend with short term and long term oscillations; especially, monthly rainfall forecasting is significant to make decisions in management of agricultural scheme and manage daily human activities. In this current study monthly average rainfall of Nuwara eliya district, Sri Lanka since 1996 to 2015 were considered. According to the unit root study, original observations are non-stationery. So, we moved 1 st difference for further study. Furthermore, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model was fitted for analyzing and validation 228 monthly observations. According to minimum Akaike information criteria (AIC), SARIMA (1, 0, 0) (1, 0, 2) (12) is selected as a best model for forecasting rainfall in this selected region.\n\nIdentifying rainfall trends in highly urbanized area is extremely important for various planning and implementation activities, including designing, maintaining and controlling of water distribution networks and sewer networks and mitigating flood damages. However, different available methods in trend analysis may produce comparable and contrasting results. Therefore, this paper presents an attempt in comparing some of the trend analysis methods using one of the highly urbanized areas in Sri Lanka, Colombo. Recorded rainfall data for 10 gauging stations for 30 years were tested using the MannKendall test, Sen’s slope estimator, Spearman’s rho test, and innovative graphical method. Results showcased comparable findings among three trend identification methods. Even though the graphical method is easier, it is advised to use it with a proper statistical method due to its identification difficulties when the data scatter has some outliers. Nevertheless, it was found herein that Colombo..."
