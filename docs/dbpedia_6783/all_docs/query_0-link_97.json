The sun, moon and stars served as their basic guide to local time. To determine their position on Earth, they required a reference point. The point chosen was Greenwich, England, through which the Prime Meridian passes, and the line where east meets west. In this chapter we shall explore questions such as the following. 1. Why is Greenwich so important in our daily lives? 2. Since the Earth approximates the shape of a sphere, the distance between two points on its surface is not represented by the length of a straight line, but by the length of an arc of a circle. How is this distance measured? 3. How do we measure time? What is Greenwich Mean Time? 4. At any particular instant, how can we compare the times at different positions on the Earth? Let us begin by researching the historical signiﬁcance of Greenwich and the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian Resources: Searching via the World Wide Web. A great deal of information about the Prime Meridian (or Greenwich Meridian) and related topics is available on the Web. This investigation is designed to enhance your research skills in retrieving relevant information using the World Wide Web. As a starting point, you may wish to explore the following web sites, then discover others for yourself. 1. http://greenwichengland.com/ 2. http://greenwich2000.com/ 3. http://greenwichmeridian.com/ 4. http://ordsvy.gov.uk/ 1 Systematically search the Web to answer the following questions. a Just where in England is Greenwich? b Why is Greenwich the centre of time and space? c What is meant by the term Prime Meridian? d Why does the Prime Meridian pass through Greenwich? What difference would it make if the Prime Meridian passed through another place on Earth, for example Brisbane? e There have been many ‘Greenwich Meridians’. How did this occur? f Why is the date October 1884 so important? 2 After gathering information from the Web (and other sources if necessary), write up your report as a practice research assignment.Your presentation should indicate evidence of detailed research into: a the difﬁculties faced by the early explorers in navigating around the globe b the signiﬁcance of Greenwich c the importance of the Prime Meridian and its history d the effect on the whole world of choosing another position for the Prime Meridian. This research could form the basis of a more formal assessment item. inv estigat ioninv estigat ion MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 208 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n3. C h a p t e r 6 E a r t h g e o m e t r y 209 1 Lines of latitude and longitude are imaginary lines which circle the Earth. Explain the difference between the two. 2 Draw a sphere to represent the shape of the Earth. a Mark the equator, Tropic of Cancer, Tropic of Capricorn, North and South Poles. b Give the position of each of these lines of latitude in degrees. 3 Draw another sphere. On it mark lines representing: a 0° longitude b 20°E longitude c 50°W longitude. 4 Draw one more sphere. On it mark: a the radius and circumference of the equator b the radius and circumference of the Tropic of Capricorn. 5 The surface of the Earth approximates the shape of a sphere. We would normally consider the shortest distance between two points to be a straight line. Explain why this is not the case when measuring the distance between two points on the Earth. 6 If the radius of the equator is 6371 km, what is the length of the equator? 7 Eplain the following: a GMT b International Date Line c EST. 8 How many time zones exist within Australia? What are they? 9 What is daylight summer time? 10 Explain EST with respect to GMT. Position on Earth As previously mentioned, the shape of the Earth approximates a sphere. This means that, in measuring the distance between two places on its surface, we are really meas- uring the distance along the arc of a circle. To measure the distance around the equator, we are actually ﬁnding the length of the circumference of a circle. To calculate distances between points on the Earth’s surface, we must ﬁrst consider the location of points. Great circles and small circles Consider the sphere drawn on the right. The axis of the sphere is a diameter of that sphere. The ends of the axis are called the poles. If we draw any direct line around the sphere passing through both poles, a great circle is formed. A great circle is the largest possible circle that can be drawn around the sphere. Pole Axis Pole MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 209 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n4. 210 M a t h s Q u e s t M a t h s A Ye a r 1 1 f o r Q u e e n s l a n d The length of a great circle is found using the formulas for the circumference of a circle: C = πD, where D is the diameter of the sphere or C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the sphere. Now consider a circle drawn perpendicular to the axis of the sphere. Only one circle, called the equator, will be a great circle. The centre of the equator will be the centre of the sphere as shown on the right. Other circles that are perpendicular to the axis of the sphere will be smaller than a great circle and are called small circles. To calculate the length around a small circle, we need to know the small circle’s radius. The small circle will have a radius smaller than that of the great circle, as shown in the ﬁgure on the right. Great circle\n\n5. C h a p t e r 6 E a r t h g e o m e t r y 211 Latitude and longitude As the Earth is a sphere, great circles and small circles on the surface of the Earth are used to locate points on the surface. Consider the axis of the Earth to be the diameter joining the North Pole and the South Pole. The only great circle that is perpendicular to this axis is the equator. The angular distance either north or south of the equator is the latitude. Small circles parallel to the equator are called paral- lels of latitude. These small circles are used to describe how far north or south of the equator a place is located. For example, Brisbane lies close to the small circle 27°S. This means that Brisbane subtends a 27° angle at the centre of the Earth and is south of the equator. The maximum latitude for any point on the Earth is 90°N or 90°S. The North and South Poles lie at these points. For latitude, the equator is the line of reference for all measurements. To locate a place on the globe in an east–west direction, the line of reference is the Greenwich Meridian. The Greenwich Meridian is half a great circle running from the North to the South Pole. The Greenwich Meridian is named after Greenwich, a suburb of London. All other places on the globe can be described as being east or west of the Greenwich Meridian. The half great circle on which a place lies is called a mer- idian of longitude. Each meridian of longitude is identiﬁed by the angle between it and the Greenwich Meridian and by whether it is east or west of Greenwich. The meridian of longitude opposite the Greenwich Meridian is the International Date Line. The Inter- national Date Line has longitude 180° either east or west. On either side of the International Date Line the day changes. (This will be explained in more detail later in the chapter.) For the convenience of some small island nations and Russia, the International Date Line is bent so as not to pass through them. World maps or globes are drawn with both parallels of latitude and meridians of longitude shown and can then be used to locate cities. Each point can then be given a pair of coordinates. First, the parallel of lati- tude it lies on, followed by the meridian of longitude. For example, the coordinates of Brisbane are 27°S, 153°E.

GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite navigation system that can be accessed by users on the land, at sea, or in the air. It is operated by the US Department of Defence. Anyone wishing to use the system may do so free of charge. Information provided by the system includes the position on the Earth’s surface (latitude and longitude), altitude, speed, direction of travel and time. 1 Your school may possess a GPS device. If so, read the instructions for its use. Move around your school grounds and note the change in latitude and longitude readings that the device indicates. See whether you can use the device to map a route around your school. 2 Education Queensland has established a web site detailing information about satellite information systems at http://education.qld.gov.au/tal/kla/compass/ Access the web site and investigate its features. It provides information such as history, practical activities and exercises, worksheets and assessment items. These could form the basis of an assignment. 3 Following your research, record your ﬁndings in the form of a presentation to your fellow class members. investigat ioninv estigat ion remember 1. A great circle is any circle of the greatest possible size that lies on the surface of a sphere. 2. The length of a great circle is calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle. 3.

The only great circle perpendicular to the Earth’s axis is the equator. 6. Places are located either north or south of the equator using parallels of latitude. Each parallel of latitude is a small circle parallel to the equator and is identiﬁed by the angle it subtends at the centre. 7. Places are located as being east or west of the Greenwich Meridian. The Greenwich Meridian is half a great circle from the North Pole to the South Pole. 8.

Points on the same great circle All meridians of longitude are half great circles. The equator is also a great circle. This means that measuring the distance between two points on the same meridian of longitude, or between two points on the equator, involves calculating the length of an arc of a great circle. Consider a meridian of longitude on the Earth’s surface with two points on it. The angular distance between them will be the difference between their latitudes. The angular distance is calculated by subtracting the latitudes of points if both are on the same side of the equator and adding the latitudes if on opposite sides of the equator. The radius of the Earth is 6371 km. Calculating the circumference of a great circle on the Earth, we ﬁnd: C = 2πr = 2 × π × 6371 km = 40 030 km So the distance around a great circle on the Earth is 40 030 km. This also represents an angular distance of 360º. So 360º is equivalent to a distance of 40 030 km; that is: 360º ≡ 40 030 km therefore 1º ≡ 111.2 km Therefore, we have calculated that an angular distance of 1º on a great circle represents a distance of 111.2 km on the surface of the Earth. θ The coordinates of A are (20°S, 130°E) and the coordinates of B are (15°N, 130°E). Find the angular distance between them. THINK WRITE A and B are on opposite sides of the equator on the same meridian (130°E), so add the latitudes. Angular distance = 20° + 15° = 35° 5WORKEDExample 6371 km MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 216 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n11. C h a p t e r 6 E a r t h g e o m e t r y 217 Points on the same small circle Points on the same parallel of latitude (other than the equator) lie on the circumference of a small circle. To ﬁnd the distance between two such points, we need to calculate the length of the arc of the small circle. This means that we need to know the radius of the small circle. Consider the diagram at right, showing a parallel of latitude at an angular distance θ from the equator. (This could be a parallel of latitude north or south of the equator.) To calculate the radius (r) of this small circle, we need to apply trigonometry. Angle ABC is equal to θ because of alternate angles on parallel lines. (The equator’s radius is parallel to the radius of the parallel of latitude.) The radius of the Earth is 6371 km, so: cos θ = = ∴ r = 6371 cos θ To calculate the circumference of the small circle: C = 2πr C = 2 × π × 6371 cos θ km = 40 030 cos θ km The circumference of the circle represents an angular distance of 360°, so: 360° ≡ 40 030 cos θ km ∴ 1° ≡ 111.2 cos θ km It is not necessary to reproduce the previous working in calculating distances between points on the same parallel of latitude. If we ﬁnd the angular distance between the two points, we can then apply the relationship that every degree of separation on a small circle is equivalent to a distance of 111.2 cos θ km where θ is the angular distance of the parallel of latitude from the equator. P and Q are two points on the Earth’s surface with coordinates (27°N, 30°W) and (39°N, 30°W) respectively. Calculate the distance between P and Q (to the nearest kilometre). THINK WRITE P and Q are on the same great circle. Calculate the angular distance, PQ. Angular distance = 39° − 27° = 12° Convert the angular distance to kilometres using 1° = 111.2 km.

We must bear in mind that, in determining the distance between two points on the Earth’s surface, we require the shortest distance. This means that if the angular distance between two points is greater than 180º, a shorter distance would be obtained by measuring the distance on the minor arc, rather than the major arc. Arc length Find the distance (to the nearest km) between two places whose positions are (40°N, 170°W) and (40°N, 26°E). THINK WRITE These points are on the same parallel of latitude (40°N) so both lie on a small circle. Calculate the angular distance between points. They are on opposite sides of the Greenwich Meridian; so add degrees. Angular distance = 170° + 26° Angular distance = 196° This angular distance is >180°, so the shorter distance is required. Shortest angular distance = 360° − 196° Shortest angular distance = 164° Use the conversion equation for distance on small circles: 1° ≡ 111.2 cos θ Distance = 164 × 111.2 cos 40° Distance = 13 970 km 1 2 3 4 7WORKEDExample remember For points on the same great circle 1.

Consider two lines of longitude, 0º and 100ºE with point P1 on 0º and point P2 on 100ºE, both on 0º latitude; that is, the equator. As these points move from the equator to the pole on the same line of latitude we are going to investigate the distance separating the two points. 1 Copy and complete the following table. For point P1 on 0º longitude and point P2 on 100ºE: 2 Describe what happens to the distance between P1 and P2 as we move from the equator to the pole. Is there a constant change? 3 You would perhaps assume that, at a latitude of 45º, the distance between P1 and P2 is half the distance between the points at the equator. This is not the case.

C h a p t e r 6 E a r t h g e o m e t r y 221 Time zones As the Earth rotates, different parts of the globe are experiencing day and night at the same instant. This means that each meridian of longitude on the Earth’s sur- face should have a different time of day. To simplify this, the Earth is divided into time zones. Time on Earth Resources: Searching via the World Wide Web and a telephone directory. Our Earth takes 24 hours to complete one revolution on its axis. During that time, it rotates through 360º, and each place on earth experiences a period of daylight and a period of night time (except for places close to the poles where extended periods of day and night occur). So a 360º movement around the globe takes 24 hours; that is, a 1º movement around the globe takes hour. This means that every degree difference east or west on the globe is equivalent to a time difference of hour or 4 minutes. It would be an advantage to print out some of the time zone maps available on the Web for reference later. 1 This investigation requires research via the World Wide Web to provide answers to questions such as: a How did the early explorers determine local time? b What is a chronometer? c What is ZULU time? d What is the signiﬁcance of GMT? e What are ‘time zones’?

C h a p t e r 6 E a r t h g e o m e t r y 223 Greenwich Mean Time Time zones are all calculated in relation to Greenwich. The time on the Greenwich Meridian is known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Time zones are then stated in terms of the number of hours they are ahead or behind GMT. All places with longitudes east of Greenwich are ahead of GMT while all place with longitudes west of Greenwich are behind GMT. For example, Eastern Standard Time in Australia is GMT + 10, meaning that Brisbane is 10 hours ahead of GMT. When GMT is 12 noon, EST is 10:00 pm. The International Date Line is 12 hours ahead of Greenwich when travelling east and 12 hours behind when travelling west, so this totals 24 hours, or one day. Therefore, the day is always different on either side of the International Date Line. The time difference between two places is calculated by subtracting the comparative time with GMT. Once we have calculated the time difference, we are able to calculate the time in one place given the time in another. To calculate the time in a city which is further ahead of GMT we add time, or to calculate the time in a city further behind GMT we subtract time. The time as calculated by the longitude is called the standard time. Time zones are cal- culated to approximate all the standard times within a region. As there are 24 hours in a day and 360° of longitude (180°E and 180°W), we can calculate that: 1 hour = 15° of longitude 1° = 4 minutes Brisbane is GMT + 10 while New York is GMT − 5. Calculate the time difference between Brisbane and New York. THINK WRITE Subtract the comparative times. Time difference = 10 − (−5) = 15 State the difference and which city is ahead in time. Brisbane is 15 hours ahead of New York. 1 2 8WORKEDExample Perth is GMT + 8 while Cape Town is GMT + 1. When it is 11:00 am in Cape Town, what is the time in Perth? THINK WRITE Calculate the time difference and state which city is ahead. Time difference = 8 − 1 = 7 hours Perth is 7 hours ahead of Cape Town. Add the time difference to the time in Cape Town to calculate the time in Perth. Time in Perth = 11:00 am + 7 hours = 6:00 pm 1 2 9WORKEDExample MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 223 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n18. 224 M a t h s Q u e s t M a t h s A Ye a r 1 1 f o r Q u e e n s l a n d We are now able to compare the time in various cities, given the longitude of each. It is important to note that, for convenience, places that have almost the same longitude have the same time. An example of this is Australia’s time zones where all of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania are in the same standard time zone although there is a difference of 12o in longitude between the easternmost and westernmost points in this zone. These calculations can then be used to calculate the arrival and departure times for international travel. More challenging examples will require you to allow for daylight saving time. When daylight saving time applies, we add one hour to the standard time at that location. Calculate the time in Los Angeles (34°N, 120°W) when it is 8:00 am on Wednesday in Sydney (33°S, 150°E). THINK WRITE Calculate the difference in longitudes. Longitude difference = 150° + 120° = 270° Convert this angular distance into hours using 1° = 4 minutes. Time difference = 270 × 4 = 1080 minutes = 18 hours Subtract the time difference from the time in Sydney.

Unfortunately time is limited and you are required to be in the solicitor’s ofﬁce within two days. Upon contacting the solicitor, you receive the following instructions. 1. Your great, great grandfather lived in Strahan on the central west coast of Tasmania. You must meet the solicitor at the Strahan visitor centre within two days. 2. You must ﬂy from Queensland to either Melbourne or one of the airports in Tasmania. 3. If you ﬂy to Melbourne, you would reach Tasmania by taking the Spirit of Tasmania across Bass Strait. 4. Bus travel to Strahan is not available, so you must hire a car to travel there. Your task is to plan your trip to Strahan to arrive there within two days. 1 Consult the Web to access airline timetables. 2 Next, consider local timetables of buses and/or trains that could transport you from your home to connect with your ﬂight. 3 Refer to a map of Tasmania and plan a road route to Strahan. 4 Prepare your itinerary, detailing: a travel arrangements from your home to the airport (means of transport, departure and arrival times, etc.) b ﬂight details (departure and arrival times, destination, etc.) c road transport routes (sketch routes, estimated distances and travelling times, etc.). 5 Estimate how long it would take you to travel from your home to the visitor centre in Strahan. Would you be able to arrive in time for the reading of the will? inv estigat ioninv estigat ion MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 227 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n22. 228 M a t h s Q u e s t M a t h s A Ye a r 1 1 f o r Q u e e n s l a n d Great circles and small circles • An axis of the sphere is any diameter. A diameter must pass through the centre of the sphere. The end points of the axis are called poles. • A great circle is any circle of maximum diameter that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere. The circumference of a great circle can be found using the formula C = 2πr. • A small circle is any circle on the surface of the sphere that is smaller than a great circle. Latitude and longitude • A point on the Earth’s surface is located using a pair of coordinates. • A point is located as being either north or south of the equator using latitude. Latitude is the angle subtended at the centre of the sphere by the small circle on which the point lies. • A point is located as being either east or west of the Greenwich Meridian by the meridian of longitude. Each meridian of longitude is measured by the angle between the meridian of longitude and the Greenwich Meridian. Points on the same great circle • If two points lie on the same great circle, the angular distance between them can be calculated by ﬁnding the difference between their latitudes. • The distance between the points, in kilometres, can be calculated using the relationship 1° ≡ 111.2 km Points on the same small circle • The angular distance between two points on the same small circle can be calculated by ﬁnding the difference between their longitudes. • The distance between the points, in kilometres, can be calculated using the relationship 1° ≡ 111.2 cos θ km where θ = degree of latitude • Remember to ﬁnd the shortest distance between the two points. Time zones • The longitude of a city determines its time zone. • The standard time at any location can be calculated using 15° = 1 hour or 1° = 4 minutes. • Points to the east of the Greenwich Meridian have standard time ahead of GMT while to the west of Greenwich, GMT standard time is behind. summary MQ Maths A Yr 11 - 06 Page 228 Wednesday, July 4, 2001 5:39 PM\n\n23.
