        "text": "Temperature\n\nLike in the tropical rain forest climate, temperatures remain high all year in the monsoon climate. As shown in the climograph for Mangalore, India (Figure \\(\\PageIndex{1}\\)), the average annual temperature is 27.05oC (80.7oF) but only has an annual temperature range of 3.6oC (2oF). The monsoon climate's temperature range is somewhat similar to that of the rain forest, but it exhibits a slightly different temporal pattern. In the rain forest we noted two periods of maximum temperature in association with the migration of the Sun's vertical rays. The monsoon climate tends to have its highest temperature just before rainy period. Once the rainy period starts, clouds block incoming solar radiation to reduce monthly temperatures.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nSeasonality of its precipitation is the hallmark and most well-known characteristic of the monsoon climate. Many think that the term \"monsoon\" means wet weather, when in fact it describes an atmospheric circulation pattern. Though the annual amount of precipitation is quite similar to that of the rain forest, monsoon precipitation is concentrated into the high-sun season. Maritime equatorial and maritime tropical air masses travel from the ocean on to land during the summer, where they are uplifted by either convection or convergence of air to induce condensation. Locally, orographic uplift is an important mechanism for promoting precipitation. As air travels into the Indian subcontinent, it is uplifted by the Himalayas, causing cloud development and precipitation.\n\nThe low-sun season is characterized by a short drought season when high pressure inhibits precipitation formation. In the case of the Asian monsoon, the replacement of the thermal low with the subsidence of the Siberian High suppresses uplift. Air masses that dominate this period are dry given their continental origin (cT, cP) or stability (mTs)."
