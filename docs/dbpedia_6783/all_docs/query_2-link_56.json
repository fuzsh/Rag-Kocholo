        "text": "Latitude and climate significantly influence biome types by determining temperature and precipitation levels, which affect plant and animal life.\n\nLatitude and climate are two fundamental factors that shape the characteristics of a biome. Biomes are large ecological areas on the earthâ€™s surface, with fauna and flora (animals and plants) adapting to their environment. Latitude is the distance of a place north or south of the earth's equator, and it influences the amount of solar energy an area receives, thus affecting its temperature. The closer a region is to the equator, the warmer it tends to be, leading to biomes such as tropical rainforests. Conversely, regions near the poles receive less sunlight, resulting in colder climates and biomes like tundra and boreal forests.\n\nClimate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term weather patterns of an area, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind. These factors greatly influence the type of vegetation that can grow in a region, which in turn affects the types of animals that can survive there. For instance, deserts are characterised by low precipitation, while grasslands receive moderate rainfall, and forests require high levels of precipitation.\n\nThe interaction between latitude and climate creates a diversity of biomes. For example, at tropical latitudes, high temperatures and rainfall create conditions suitable for dense forests. In contrast, at higher latitudes, lower temperatures and varying levels of precipitation result in biomes such as grasslands, deciduous forests, or tundra.\n\nFurthermore, altitude can also mimic latitude and climate effects. Higher altitudes have cooler temperatures, similar to higher latitudes. This is why you can find similar biomes, such as alpine tundra, on tall mountains and in high-latitude regions. Understanding altitudinal zonation provides further insights into how altitude impacts biome distribution similar to latitude.\n\nExploring the major world biomes offers a broader perspective on how diverse the ecosystems can be under varying climatic and latitudinal influences."
