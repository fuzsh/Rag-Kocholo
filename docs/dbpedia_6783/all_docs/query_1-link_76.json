        "text": "This Celestron CGX-L Computerized Equatorial Mount and Tripod is an Open Box item and, therefore, in Open Box Condition. All Open Box items come with a full manufacturer's warranty.\n\nThe CGX-L GoTo German Equatorial Mount From Celestron!\n\nUpgrading their principal CGX telescope mount, Celestron introduces the CGX-L! This new and improved equatorial mount features a whopping payload capacity of 75lbs, a more robust design, thicker tripod legs, and plenty more. While still containing all of the incredible aspects of the CGX, such as precise tracking and a user friendly design, this CGX-L supports a wider range of equipment for increased applications. Push the limits of amateur astrophotography with this heavy duty Celestron equatorial mount!\n\nJust like its predecessor, this CGX-L is assembled with a belt drive system for optimized performance. Larger worm wheels have been integrated to manage the higher payload capacity and delivers smooth tracking across the night sky! A longer dovetail saddle accommodates sizable OTAs and is compatible with both CG-5/Vixen and CGE/Losmandy dovetails. While having a 20lb increase in payload than the CGX, the mount head of the CGX-L weighs only ~8lbs heavier! Nicely positioned handles make carrying and setting up the CGX-L a breeze, and internal cabling help prevent dreaded cable snags. The included NexStar+ hand controller makes it easy to choose your target, star align, and even polar align! With characteristics like these, the CGX-L is a must have for those wanting to take their astronomy journey to the next level!\n\nErgonomically Designed\n\nCelestron has furnished this CGX-L with useful additions to maximize user experience! With the mount head coming in at ~53lbs, two befitting handles can be found at the base of the mount as well as below the dovetail saddle for easy, comfortable transport. This 270mm dovetail saddle makes it easy to balance heavy OTAs and features large, easy to grip tightening knobs to secure your equipment into place. While polar aligning, the robust latitude adjustment offers smooth, seamless maneuvering even under heavy loads. Celestron has redesigned the azimuth adjustment with low-friction Teflon bearings to further enhance your polar alignment experience! Cable management is made easy with the internal cabling system, and strategically placed ports to minimize loose cords that can get caught while tracking. Also included is the ability to focus the center of gravity over the tripod with an adjustable EQ head position. This further enhances stability as well as optimizes the increased 3°-65° latitude range.\n\nA High Caliber, Substantial Payload Telescope Mount\n\nThis feature-packed equatorial mount is a must have for those looking to upgrade their astronomy experience. With qualities such as high precision internal mechanics, the ability to pack on heavy, premier equipment, and a user friendly design, its easy to see why this the CGX-L is a prime option for backyard and remote observers.
