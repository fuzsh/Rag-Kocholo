        "text": "Where to Go\n\nUnwind among the coconut palms on Sri Lanka’s endless tropical beaches\n\nExperience Sri Lankan culture in living colour at one of the many religious festivals\n\nExplore the lush forests, rock-top temples and sacred peaks of the Central Highlands\n\nSee majestic palaces, monasteries and the sacred Bodhi tree in Anuradhapura\n\nVisit ancient architecture and Buddhist relics in the sacred city of Kand\n\nMarvel at the lion-shaped palace of Sigiriya, perched atop a colossal rock\n\nWalk among incredible temples, tombs and monuments in the ancient city of Polonnaruwa\n\nWalk through the 2,300-year-old Buddhist cave-temples of Damballa\n\nEnjoy exotic charm and colonial architecture in the fortified city of Galle\n\nSee the majestic Sri Lankan elephant in the wild, in one of the country’s lush wilderness areas\n\nShop for colourful textiles, leatherwork and handicrafts in Sri Lanka’s bustling markets\n\nTry a cooking class or simply sample as many Sri Lankan dishes as you can\n\nWeather\n\nSri Lanka is very much a tropical country, with distinct dry and wet seasons and a generally warm and humid climate. This is caused by the island’s equatorial tropical latitude and the influence of the northeast and southwest monsoons, in which alternating wet/dry periods are caused by the seasonal reversal of prevailing winds.\n\nElevation and rainfall are the two key factors in Sri Lanka’s daily and seasonal climate variations, and your experience of Sri Lanka’s different seasons will depend largely on your location on the island. It’s never really a bad time weather-wise to visit Sri Lanka; you just need to know which side of the island to head to.\n\nThe southwest monsoon brings rain and winds to Sri Lanka’s southwestern regions between May and September, and a dry season between December and March. The northeast monsoon brings a dry season to the northeastern regions between May and September, and rain and winds between October and January. The crossover period from October to mid-November can see rain and thunderstorms across the whole island. Despite the seasons, the humid coastal plains of the southwest (Wet Zone) receive much more reliable rainfall that the more arid plains of the north, east and south (Dry Zone).\n\nThe driest and best months to visit are generally Dec-Mar for the southwest and hill country, and Apr-Sep for the northeast and ancient cities.\n\nThere is negligible variance is annual temperature ranges in all but the Central Highlands region, where elevation moderates the tropical climate and you will experience milder conditions and wider daily and yearly temperature ranges.\n\nIn Colombo, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 22.3°C (72°F) to a maximum of 30.9°C (88°F) in January, to a minimum of 25.5°C (78°F) to a maximum of 30.4°C (87°F) in June.\n\nIn Kandy, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 18.4°C (65°F) to a maximum of 28.3°C (83°F) in January, to a minimum of 21.4°C (71°F) to a maximum of 28.4°C (83°F) in June.\n\nIn Anuradhapura in the central-north, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 20.9°C (°F) to a maximum of 29.6°C (°F) in January, to a minimum of 24.5°C (°F) to a maximum of 34.3°C (°F) in April.\n\nIn Nuwara Eliya in the Central Highlands, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 9°C (48°F) to a maximum of 20°C (68°F) in January, to a minimum of 11.4°C (53°F) to a maximum of 22.8°C (73°F) in April.\n\nVisas\n\nTravellers from AU, NZ, CA, US and UK can get and pay for a Sri Lanka ‘Electronic Travel Authorisation’ (ETA) online, a few days before you arrive. You should get your approval notice within 24 hours, and you can use this to enter Sri Lanka. You can apply here at the official website of the Department of Immigration and Emigration www.eta.gov.lk.\n\nIt is also possible for travellers from AU, NZ, CA, US and UK to apply for a 30-day tourist visa on arrival if you land at Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo. However, the Department for Immigration strongly advise visitors to apply for an ETA before entry to Sri Lanka, as the approval of an arrival visa cannot be guaranteed. A visa on arrival costs 60 US dollars, which is 10 US dollars more than the ETA.\n\nTravellers from AU, NZ, CA, US and UK can complete an online arrival form 3 days before arriving in Sri Lanka. The service is free and may save time when you arrive. If you want to stay for more than 30 days, up to 180 days, you need to apply online as you cannot apply on arrival.\n\nPlease ensure that your passport has an expiry date of greater than 6 months during your visit to Sri Lanka.\n\nSafety\n\nYour safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.\n\nPlease refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.\n\nWe strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.\n\nWe suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.\n\nMoney and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum."
