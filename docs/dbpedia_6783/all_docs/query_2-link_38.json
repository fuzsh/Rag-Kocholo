        "meta_description": "Abstract In regions of climatic heterogeneity, finescale assessment of drought risk is needed for policy making and drought management, mitigation, and adaptation. The relationship between drought relief payments (a proxy for drought risk) and meteorological drought indicators is examined through a retrospective analysis for Sri Lanka (1960–2000) based on records of district-level drought relief payments and a dense network of 284 rainfall stations. The standardized precipitation index and a percent-of-annual-average index for rainfall accumulated over 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were used, gridded to a spatial resolution of 10 km. An encouraging correspondence was identified between the spatial distribution of meteorological drought occurrence and historical drought relief payments at the district scale. Time series of drought indices averaged roughly over the four main climatic zones of Sri Lanka showed statistically significant (p < 0.01) relationships with the occurrence of drought relief. The 9-month cumulative drought index provided the strongest relationships overall, although 6- and 12-month indicators provided generally similar results. Some cases of appreciable drought without corresponding relief payments could be attributed to fiscal pressures, as during the 1970s. Statistically significant relationships between drought indicators and relief payments point to the potential utility of meteorological drought assessments for disaster risk management. In addition, the study provides an empirical approach to testing which meteorological drought indicators bear a statistically significant relationship to drought relief across a wide range of tropical climates.",

        "text": "a. Precipitation and drought relief data\n\nMonthly rainfall data covering the period from January 1960 to December 2000 were obtained from the Sri Lanka Department of Meteorology for 22 of its synoptic stations and secondary sources for a total of 284 stations across the country. We subjected the data from the synoptic stations to quality-control procedures as outlined by the Global Historical Climatology Network (Peterson et al. 1998) and established that they were reliable for the period 1960–2000 with just a few exceptions. Data from the remaining stations were compared with the quality-controlled Department of Meteorology stations and with nearby stations to identify extreme outliers, transcription errors, and calibration errors. Based on these comparisons, a small subset of stations (<5%) was discarded. This database was then utilized to generate gridded drought indices at a spatial resolution of 10 km using the Weaver interpolation scheme developed at the U.S. Climate Prediction Center. The Weaver analysis scheme is a simplified version of the Cressman (1959) analysis, performing unweighted spatial interpolation without the use of radii of influence. When used to interpolate to an equally spaced latitude/longitude grid, only observations located within each grid box are used to calculate the interpolated value for that grid box. (At the time of writing, further details on the Weaver analysis scheme could be found online at http://ingrid.ldeo.columbia.edu/dochelp/StatTutorial/Interpolation/.)\n\nDrought relief payment data at the district level (25 in Sri Lanka, identified in Fig. 3 below) were obtained from the Sri Lanka Department of Social Services, the Sri Lanka Department of Census and Statistics, and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Incidences of disasters (here, substantial impacts from drought) are reported through the government hierarchy beginning at the village level, are then aggregated to subdistrict (Divisional Secretariat), and then are further aggregated up to the district level before being reported to both provincial and national disaster management agencies. Over this period, the Ministry of Social Services and its subordinate institution, the Department of Social Services, are charged with monitoring disasters and associated relief payments. Issuance of relief payments is based on the severity of the disaster, on the availability of funds, and on the number of people affected. At the time of issuance, a classification is also made as to whether the disaster is considered to be a minor event, a medium event, or a major event. The Sri Lanka Department of Census and Statistics subsequently records and archives these data. Relief payments are issued from weeks to within a few months of drought impacts. Information on the classification of drought relief payments and affected districts was obtained from the Department of Census and Statistics.\n\nDrought relief payments afford a proxy for drought risk and indicate when and where drought has occurred. Such consistent records for periods extending to 40 years are rare in the tropics. In taking relief payments as a proxy for drought risk, we are assuming that the drought reporting and record-keeping mechanisms described previously are comprehensive through time and that political factors do not alter the distribution of relief significantly. If political and administrative factors were to affect drought relief, then it would compromise the evidence for relationships between meteorological drought and relief payments in the analysis.\n\nb. Meteorological drought indices\n\nMultiple drought indices are in use (e.g., Keyantash and Dracup 2002), but those presented here were chosen primarily for their computational simplicity. Indices based on variables such as streamflow, vegetation condition, or soil moisture estimates were either not available at adequate spatial resolution or lacked reliability and/or sufficient historical extent for the analysis. All of the meteorological estimates of drought were therefore based solely on monthly rainfall observations across Sri Lanka. These drought indices were initially computed at individual stations and then gridded to 10-km resolution. To take into account spatial variations in climatological rainfall, absolute measures of rainfall variability were avoided in favor of two alternative approaches. In one approach, time series of accumulated monthly rainfall anomalies (departures from a 1971–2000 base period mean) were assessed for time intervals of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months at each station using overlapping, running, sums. These sums were then expressed as a percentage of average annual precipitation at each station to yield indices hereinafter called PRCT-3, PRCT-6, and so on. The percentage of annual precipitation was used instead of subyearly totals to avoid inflated percentages during relatively dry seasons that do not necessarily represent a correspondingly large quantity of water.\n\nIn a second approach, the standardized precipitation index (SPI; McKee et al. 1993) was computed at each station for the same time intervals as for the PRCT index, and it will similarly be referred to as SPI-3, SPI-6, and so on. The SPI is computed by using all the historical data available (here 1960–2000) to fit a cumulative probability distribution for rainfall amounts observed over a particular period of interest (e.g., 3, 6, or 9 months). This cumulative probability distribution is then translated to a normal probability distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The SPI-3, SPI-6, and so on will thus all have equal probabilities of exceeding a given index value. For example, the probability of the SPI-6 being < −1.0 is the same as that for SPI-3 being < −1.0, and so on, because this represents Pr(x < −1) for a normal probability distribution of x having zero mean and unit variance.\n\nThe periods of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were selected for both indices to capture rainfall variability on time scales ranging from a single season (i.e., 3-month period) to multiple seasons. As such, these indices cannot fully capture more protracted droughts that last longer than 1 yr. However, many droughts in Sri Lanka are associated with the ENSO, with its cold phase typically leading to anomalously dry conditions from October to December (Zubair et al. 2008). For example, the spatially averaged, temporal correlations between SST (from Smith and Reynolds 2004) anomalies1 averaged over the Niño-3.4 region (5°S–5°N, 120°–170°W) and the SPI-3 index are plotted in Fig. 2 for the four regions of Sri Lanka delineated in Fig. 1 as a function of overlapping 3-month seasons. During boreal autumn, statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations are seen for all four regions of Sri Lanka, indicating the well-established tendency for warm (cold) ENSO events to be associated with above (below) expected seasonal rainfall during this period (Zubair and Ropelewski 2006). However, the correlations weaken and then reverse sign in all locations of Sri Lanka later in the boreal winter into early spring, with statistically significant negative values observed for the January–March and February–April seasons. Given this seasonally varying relationship with ENSO, temporal correlations between Niño-3.4 SST anomalies and longer-term drought indices such as the SPI-24 and PRCT-24 do not reveal any statistically significant relationships (not shown), with corresponding correlations typically not exceeding ±0.1. Factors other than ENSO can also lead to drought in Sri Lanka such as Indian Ocean SSTs (e.g., Zubair et al. 2003), but the role they play has not been explicated fully.\n\nGiven the strong seasonality of climatological rainfall in Sri Lanka, a weighted version of the PRCT indices was also examined to test the sensitivity of drought impacts to the timing of rainfall anomalies during a given year. The monthly weights were larger for climatological “wet” months and also take into account monthly rainfall variability at each station to allow for comparisons at locations across the country. The weighted sums used to construct the time series at a given station may be expressed mathematically as where P′ is the precipitation anomaly for the ith month in the N-month sum (here N is 3, 6, 9, or 12), which has been weighted by the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of monthly precipitation αi, computed over the 1971–2000 base period. As with the unweighted measures, the sum is then expressed as a percent of the annual-average precipitation . The weighting scheme is mathematically equivalent to that used in previous studies of tropical drought by Lyon (2004) and Lyon and Barnston (2005).\n\na. Spatial distribution\n\nA drought risk map for Sri Lanka was constructed by summing the occurrence of drought relief payments made at the district level over the study period after weighting individual events according to their severity. Relief payments are thus used as a proxy for drought risk. In terms of severity, the Sri Lanka Ministry of Social Services has categorized each drought (i.e., when relief was provided) as being of minor, moderate, or major severity. We accordingly have arbitrarily assigned weights of 0.5, 1, and 1.5 for the minor, medium, and major droughts, respectively. The results reported here are robust with respect to moderate changes to this weighting scheme. The resultant risk map (Fig. 3) shows marked spatial variability, with relatively low drought risk in the western climate zone and higher risk in the northern, eastern, and southern zones. The highest drought risk occurs in Anuradhapura district (northern climate zone) followed by Puttalam (north), Vavuniya districts (north), and Hambantota district (southern climate zone). Note that northern districts in Sri Lanka have higher relief payments per capita because they are sparsely populated.\n\nHow do spatial variations in estimated drought risk compare with meteorological drought occurrence? To answer this question, the spatial variation of meteorological drought was assessed by mapping the relative occurrence of drought “events,” identified (at each grid point) when a given drought index exceeded prescribed thresholds of magnitude and duration. Several such analyses were generated based on the PRCT and SPI and various magnitude and duration criteria. Results based on the SPI, for different time periods (not shown), revealed a tendency to have too many drought events (relative to the risk map) in the west and too few elsewhere. A better correspondence to the drought risk map was found using the PRCT-6 or PRCT-9 index to define drought events.\n\nIn comparing the drought risk map (Fig. 3) with meteorological drought frequency (Fig. 4), we see several general similarities. Meteorological drought events based on the PRCT-6 and PRCT-9 indices are seen to be less frequent in the southwestern coastal areas of the country (Galle, Kalutara, Colombo, and Gampaha districts in the western climate zone) than in other areas. The hill districts of the western climate zone, including Nuwara, Eliya, and Ratnapura, do however have greater drought occurrence than in the southwestern coastal areas using these measures. There are also some notable differences in the spatial patterns of the two figures. For example, the comparatively high drought frequency in the Trincomalee district in the eastern climate zone and in the Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, and Jaffna districts in the northern climate zone is not reflected in equally high and/or frequent relief payments. Normalizing the number of relief payments by population of each district does, however, bring higher per capita payments in these sparsely populated districts relative to other areas (not shown). In addition, the Anurhadhapura district in north-central Sri Lanka and neighboring Puttalam district appear to garner a substantial number of relief payments in comparison with historical meteorological drought events. If the total number of drought relief payments for these districts is normalized by population, then the rank of these districts is somewhat reduced relative to other areas, but they are still seen as outliers when compared with the relative frequency of meteorological drought events. Among the factors that could be affecting relief payments generally are the percent of the population engaged in agriculture (e.g., coastal districts are likely to have substantial populations engaged in fishing) and the caliber of the government administrative machinery and political clout of each district.\n\nThe reasons why the SPI did not capture similar spatial patterns for drought occurrence when compared with the PRCT index were examined in more detail. The differences were found to be related to regionally varying features of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the PRCT index relative to that of the SPI. By design, the pdf of the SPI has a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance. As mentioned previously, the probability of the SPI exceeding a given index value is therefore the same at all locations. The PRCT index, however, is not similarly constrained, and therefore the probability distribution may vary regionally. Why this should lead to fewer drought events in the west and comparatively more in the north when using PRCT versus SPI can be seen schematically in Fig. 5 in which the pdfs of the PRCT-9 index are shown for both regions. The figure indicates that the probability of the PRCT-9 index being less than approximately −15% is greater in the north than in the west because of the greater dispersion in the distribution in the north. Thus, drought events defined using a PRCT-9 index threshold of less than −15% have a higher probability of occurrence in the north relative to the west. The result is that the map of meteorological drought frequency (Fig. 4) and the proxy map for risk (Fig. 3) have generally similar spatial distributions when using the PRCT index, with dissimilar patterns found based on the SPI. This result does not imply, however, that fluctuations in the PRCT index will necessarily be more closely related to drought relief payments than the SPI when the climate zones are evaluated individually. In that case, different thresholds of the SPI can be used in each region to determine which has the best relationship to the occurrence of drought relief. This is described in more detail in the next section.\n\nb. Regional drought indicators and occurrence of drought relief\n\nTo compare the regional occurrence of drought relief payments with measures of meteorological drought through time, the relief payment information and drought indices were first aggregated (approximately) to the scale of the four climatologically homogeneous regions. To do this, the occurrence of drought relief payments for all districts within a given climate zone was flagged, generating a binary (yes/no) time series of monthly observations for each zone. Time series of drought indices were then computed as the area average of all grid point values within the rectangular box that most closely fit that climate zone (as delineated in Fig. 1). The drought index time series were detrended to emphasize the interannual variations of interest here. Periods of drought identified in the PRCT and SPI time series were then compared with the occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of drought relief payments over the period 1960–2000. Time series of the PRCT-9 index generally showed the best correspondence to drought relief for each of the four climate zones shown in Fig. 6, where the black bars indicate the occurrence of drought relief within each zone. The length of the black bars in the figure is 0.5, 1, or 1.5 for drought classified as minor, moderate, and major, respectively.\n\nFor all four regions, drought relief payments are generally seen during periods with contemporaneous negative drought index values, especially when the index drops below values roughly between −15% and −20%. There are a few cases, however, when drought events developed but relief payments were not made. For example, in all four regions a period of fairly substantial drought occurred in the mid-1970s with no relief payments. During this period, the government was under significant financial stress due to national budget deficits (Zubair 2005, and references therein), likely affecting the decision to issue relief payments.\n\nThese general associations between meteorological drought occurrence and relief payments were also considered more quantitatively. Results that contrast the dry north with the wet climate of the west are provided here. For this comparison, time series of monthly values of the drought indices averaged over each climate zone were compared with the corresponding, binary time series of the occurrence of drought relief payment for each calendar year and the first 3 months of the subsequent year. Including the first 3 months of the subsequent year recognizes that there may be a lag between meteorological drought occurrence and subsequent government relief. Various thresholds of the drought indices were then used to construct 2 × 2 contingency tables indicating the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a drought relief payment when a drought index exceeded these thresholds. The contingency table entries for each climate zone were then used to test for statistical significance using the Fisher exact test (Sheskin 2004). The contingency tables were also used to compute several other performance measures for each zone including the 1) hit rate (HIT), 2) threat score (TS), 3) probability of detection (POD), 4) false-alarm rate (FAR), 5) bias (BIAS), and 6) Heidke skill score (HSS) [see Wilks (1995) for more details on these measures].\n\nFor the north, statistically significant results were obtained for both the SPI and PRCT evaluated at time periods of between 3 and 12 months. However, based on the various performance measures, statistical significance levels, and testing several drought index thresholds, the strongest relationship (p < 0.01) between drought occurrence and drought relief was found for the PRCT-9 index and a threshold of −15%. Results for the weighted versions of the PRCT indices [i.e., using Eq. (1)] were generally similar to the unweighted results although a somewhat better relationship was found for the weighted version of the PRCT-3 index in the north, indicating the importance of the boreal autumn rainy season there. For the west, neither the SPI-3 nor PRCT-3 showed a statistically significant relationship with drought relief occurrence across a number of drought index thresholds. The closest correspondence in the west (p < 0.01) was found using the 6-month PRCT index and a threshold of −10%. For both the north and the west, the SPI did show statistically significant relationships (p < 0.05), but the other performance measures yielded somewhat poorer results when compared with the PRCT index. Sampling issues may have also played a role in this finding. A summary of performance measures based on the PRCT index results is shown in Fig. 7, which uses the abbreviations defined in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe overall results suggest that in the dry north relatively short-lived drought events (i.e., those captured by the PRCT-3 index) can cause substantial impacts. It is hypothesized that because the north receives more than 55% of its annual rainfall during the 3-month period of October–December deficient rainfall in this single season can be particularly detrimental to agriculture. This was suggested by the closer correspondence between relief payments and the weighted PRCT-3 index and can also be seen in Fig. 8, which shows the monthly distribution of drought relief payments for the full 41-yr study period for both the west and north. Two-thirds of the payments in the north occurred after January (Fig. 8a), whereas for the west they were evenly divided between boreal autumn and the subsequent spring seasons. The best overall relationship with drought relief in the north is captured by the 9-month PRCT index, which suggests that the north, while impacted by shorter-lived droughts (e.g., 3 months), is also susceptible to more protracted drought events. In the north there is a high probability of failure of agriculture due to drought from April to September because this is the water-constrained, secondary agricultural season there (Zubair 2002). In the much wetter west, single-season droughts do not appear, in general, to be as detrimental to agriculture as in the more-water-limited north—in particular, in the April–September agricultural season. This is suggested in Fig. 8 by the overall lower number of drought relief payments made to the west (10, vs 16 for the north)."
