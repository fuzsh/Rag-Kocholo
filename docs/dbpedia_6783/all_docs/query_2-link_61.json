        "text": "Making sense of the Sri Lankan Monsoon\n\nRainfall in Sri Lanka is not predictable and monthly averages mean very little. Although the 3 main rainy seasons start pretty much on time (give or take a fortnight) the amount of rain that falls during those seasons is variable from year to year,and in the North and East the dry season may be getting drier. So why is the monsoon so variable both from one year to the next and over longer periods?\n\nUpdate (24/07/20)\n\nThe 2019 season was one of the wettest on record in India. From June to September 2019, India received the highest amount of monsoonal rain in the past 25 years. and the Monsoon season carried on well into October. At the same time Sri Lanka experienced extreme rainfall in September leading to flash floods and damage to property. So why did that happen? The increase in extreme rain events is associated with a phenomenon called the Indian Ocean Dipole and you can read all about it later in this article.\n\nBut first a little bit of simplified theory.\n\nSurface temperature, air pressure and surface winds\n\nthings you need to know if you don’t already:\n\nrising air = low pressure: it is caused by one of three mechanisms:\n\na. heating from below – convection\n\nb. warm ( less dense ) air rising over cooler (more dense air ) – frontal rainfall\n\nc. where two air masses meet or converge – convergence.\n\nRising air is associated with cloud formation and rainfall. (air cools, condenses – cloud and rain)\n\ndescending air = high pressure, the result of:\n\na. cooling from below which causes air to become heavier at the base and sink towards the surface.. or\n\nb. upper atmosphere convergence below the tropopause which forces the air downwards\n\nDescending air is associated with dry conditions ( descending air heats up)\n\nThe diagram below gives a general idea of how that works. Air in a low pressure cell rises into the upper atmosphere until it reaches the boundary with the troposphere ( the tropopause) where it is prevented from rising and moves sideways. Being much colder and/ or where there is upper atmosphere convergence, the air sinks back to the surface creating a circuit if you like.\n\nFig 1\n\n3. Surface winds move from high pressure to low pressure\n\nWhat controls the monsoon\n\nThere are three processes at work and because they operate semi-independently of one another it makes the understanding of how the monsoon operates tricky.\n\nThe Inter – Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) and the way it moves explains the seasonal reversal of winds over the Indian Ocean basin; the change from the South West Monsoon to the North east Monsoon\n\nThe ENSO Pacific Ocean events (EL Nino and La Nina) impact on the Indian Ocean by causing winds and rainfall to shift around in response to what happens in the Pacific Ocean\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole where changes to Sea Surface temperatures (SST’s) also re-organise circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean\n\nThe Inter – Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ )\n\nThe ITCZ is a zone of rising air (Low Pressure) located around the equator where the water (SST’s) is warmest. This is convective uplift. Rising air is associated with cloud formation and rain. At around 30 degrees of latitude either side of the ITCZ are regions of descending air. The sub-tropical high pressure belts. Surface winds blow from the high pressure belts inwards towards the ITCZ.\n\nFig 2. Global Circulation Patterns\n\nNotice the don’t flow at right angles to the equator. The actually move as curved lines; north -east to south – west in the northern hemisphere, ( The North East Trade winds) and south – east to north west in the southern hemisphere (the South East Trade winds). This is due to the coriolis force; check it out here.\n\nSo why do winds migrate?\n\nRemember, the SST’s control the location of the ITCZ. As the sun (which heats the ocean) moves north in the northern summer, it follows the highest SST’s will migrate north and that drags the ITCZ north.It also follows that the reverse will happen in the southern summer and the ITCZ will migrate southward.\n\nFig 3 The migration of the ITCZ\n\nNow that is going to have an impact on the pattern of surface winds, as this simple diagram shows;\n\nFig. 4\n\nand what this shows is that:\n\nin January the N.E. Trades are pulled south of the Equator, deflecting to the left of their path. This is the North east Monsoon.In July the opposite occurs.\n\nThe S.E. Trades are pulled across the equator, and as the coriolis forces deflects the wind to the right of its path instead of being S.E. trades they become S.W monsoon winds.\n\nFigure 5 is a more detailed version of the process.\n\nFig 5\n\nNotice the region of high pressure in the southern Indian Ocean. This is called the Mascarene High; for more try out this link. I will get back to this later in the blog.\n\nSo the migration of the ITCZ explains the seasonal reversal of wind patterns and broadly when that happens. However, it doesn’t explain why both the North East and the South West monsoons are so variable in terms of how much rain falls. That is because there are other forces at play which have a direct impact on the pattern of SST’s which in turn control surface air pressure and winds.\n\nThey are\n\nEl Nino/La Nina events\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole which has three phases; positive, negative and neutral\n\nThe influence of El Nino / La Nina on the monsoon\n\nEl Nino is a Pacific Ocean event, right? Well yes it is, but what happens in the Pacific Ocean has a knock on effect on the circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean; and it is complicated.\n\nA. More backgound: The Walker Circulation Pattern\n\nThe Walker circulation is an ocean-based system of air circulation that influences weather and is the result of the difference in surface pressure and temperature over the western and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. Normally, the air over the tropical western Pacific is warm and wet with a low pressure system, (rising air) and the cool and dry eastern Pacific lie under a high pressure system (descending air).\n\nThis creates a pressure gradient and causes surface air to move east to west, from high pressure in the eastern Pacific to low pressure in the western Pacific. Higher up in the atmosphere,west-east winds move in the reverse direction to complete the circulation.\n\nFig 6 ENSO neutral\n\nWhat you need to notice is that there is a major zone of uplift over south east Asia. Also note the area of descending air over the Middle East and the weaker uplift zone over East Africa. That helps to maintain a predominant west to east surface air flow over the Indian Ocean Basin which reinforces the monsoon.\n\nSo if you are ok with that then let’s look at how the El Nino upsets everything;\n\nB. ENSO events; El Nino and La Nina\n\nEl Nino is an ocean sea surface temperature event that is now pretty well understood. During El Nino events the normal Walker circulation pattern weakens, allowing warmer water to migrate eastwards towards the coast of South America. At the same time the main zone of uplift (low pressure) moves towards the central Pacific and in the western Pacific the surface airflow reverses to become west to east.\n\nNotice now that there is descending air (high pressure) over South East Asia, and a strengthened zone of upfift over East Africa. The net effect is to establish an easterly airflow over the Indian Ocean, working against the South West Monsoon in particular.\n\nFig 7\n\nSo what you might expect is that in El Nino years the South West Monsoon is weaker over South Asia. This in turn can lead to reduced rainfall, and possibly, drought conditions.\n\nLa Nina is the reverse of El Nino so far as the Pacific Ocean circulation is concerned. Here the warmer water moves into the western pacific intensifying the zone of uplift over South East Asia ; the cell moves westwards effectively. Notice the zone of uplift over East Africa has gone.. bad news for those areas.. but the west to east airflow over the Indian Ocean pattern strengthens intensifying the South West Monsoon.\n\nFig 8\n\nSo to summarise so far: the two influences on rainfall we have looked at are\n\nThe movement of the ITCZ\n\nEl Nino/La Nina\n\nIt is worth noting that these events act independently of one another..\n\nBut now we have to add the third element; The Indian Ocean Dipole\n\nC. The Indian Ocean Dipole\n\nFirst identified in 1999, the Indian Ocean Dipole refers to spatial differences in sea surface temperature over the tropical Indian Ocean. There are three phases:\n\nA neutral phase; when the SST is broadly the same across the tropical ocean basin.\n\nThe positive phase; this is where there is cooler than normal water in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and warmer than normal water in the tropical western Indian Ocean.\n\nFig 9\n\nIncreased convection over the western Indian Ocean (warmer air rise = low pressure = rain) has a knock on effect for the monsoon; why?\n\nok so remember that the SW Monsoon rules in May – August; the ITCZ migrates northward and the winds blowing from the SE become south westerlies when they are dragged across the equator into the northern hemisphere. ( check out figs 3&4 ) Plus being warmer the relative humidity of the air is increased. This should mean the monsoon intensifies\n\nThe negative phase; this is where there is warmer than normal water in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean and cooler than normal water in the tropical western Indian Ocean.\n\nFig 10\n\nHere the pattern reverses. To the west of India there is a zone of descending air which surpresses the moisture content of the surface winds and leads to lower rainfall.\n\nD. Putting it all together\n\nThese three influences don’t necessarily synchronise with one another and are pretty much independent of one another as well.\n\nGenerally ENSO impacts the Indian Ocean by re-organising the atmospheric circulation but so does the Indian Ocean Dipole.\n\nSo\n\nEl Nino = drought\n\nLa Nina = enhanced monsoon\n\nPositive Dipole = enhanced monsoon\n\nNegative Dipole = surpressed monsoon\n\nBut as I wrote earlier.. it now gets tricky.\n\nDon’t forget the system can also be in neutral!\n\n2. Not only that but the ENSO and Dipole events vary independantly, in intensity and impact.\n\nLast point; various phases of both ENSO and the IOD can occur concurrently but at different relative strengths. Confused yet?\n\nOne example; a moderate El Nino such as occurred in 1997 should have lead to a poor monsoon over India but it didnt. this was because it was outweighed in influence by a stronger positive IOD event and in 1997/8 India received above average rainfall. This puzzled many meteorologists and led to the discovery of the IOD in 1999.\n\nSo what doe the evidence show? The following table illustrates how the different events have come together to affect the monsoon in recent years.\n\nDates of positive IOD: 1994, 1997, 2006, 2012\n\nDates of negative IOD: 1992, 1996, 1998, 2010 (Australian Bureau of Meteorology)\n\nAn IOD event can offset the impact of El Nino or La Nina although in 2004 it was El Nino that “won”.\n\nImpact of ENSO events\n\nyear occurrence Impact % normal monsoon rainfall 2004 El Nino Drought 88 2005 Neutral Normal 101 2006 Neutral/positive IOD Normal 103 2007 La Nina Excess 110 2008 La Nina/negative IOD Above normal 105 2009 El Nino Severe drought 79 2010 La Nina/negative IOD Normal 100 2011 La Nina Normal 104 2012 El Nino/Positive IOD below normal 92 2013 Neutral above normal 106\n\nSo that’s what it comes down to.. a dynamic system driven by variations in sea surface temperature which drive atmospheric circulation patterns.\n\nThe complicating factors are that:\n\nThe time spans between ENSO events are not even.\n\nThe ENSO events vary in strength.\n\nOccasionally the IOD intervenes\n\nLooking then at all of this: It does shed some light, however, on why monsoon rainfall is highly variable and, therefore, so difficult to forecast. It also may help us to understand why South Asia is prone to periodic drought; the subject of the next article.\n\nFootnote: Don’t forget Global Warming!!\n\nAccording to Dr. Evan Weller abased at Monsah University in Australia global warming is set to complicate matters even more.\n\nAs climate changes, so sea surface temperatures will rise, but the increase won’t be even. Some regions will warm more than other regions. Over the eastern Indian Ocean, the waters to the north are predicted to warm faster than those in the south. This will have the effect of pushing the ITCZ further north over the eastern Indian Ocean. It will also affect the SST gradient north to south and that impacts on pressure differences and ultimately circulation patterns. The question is how will this interact with ENSO and IOD events and what effect will that have on the climate of South Asia. It may well serve to intensify the south west monsoon but there is no agreement on that at the moment. It is also possible that the location of the warmer water pool in the Indian Ocean (both positive and negative phases) may shift in location and this could also affect the local surface wind patterns. There is still much that is not understood!\n\nThe South Asian Monsoon; same as it ever was?\n\nWhat is happening to the Indian Ocean monsoon? Has it become less predictable? Is it becoming affected by global warming? and finally, are droughts in Sri Lanka getting worse as a result?\n\nThe monsoon rains are important not only for agriculture in the region but also power generation. Sri Lanka generates around 40% of its electricity from H.E.P. for example. So getting an understanding of how the monsoon seasons work is really quite important for a whole range of reasons.\n\na. In the first of three linked articles I am going to be analysing rainfall and drought data to find out what is actually going on.\n\nb. The second article will look at what drives the monsoon, in particular the interplay of 3 factors and how they lead to changing patterns of sea surface temperature ( SST ), pressure and wind patterns, and how this affects rainfall. The three phenomena are:\n\nThe migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ )\n\nThe El Nino/La Nina events which occur in the Pacific Ocean ( ENSO )\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole ( IOD )\n\nc. The third article will focus on patterns of drought in Sri Lanka.\n\nAnalysing Rainfall: getting the data\n\nFor this article I am using rainfall data for 4 stations; Batticaloa, Jaffna, Colombo and Galle. I had data for the period 2000 – 2015 and added to that data for the same locations for the period 1985-90. (I would have liked more ie; 1980 – 2000 but I couldn’t access the data).\n\nSo my sample size is small and skewed towards the later period but it does give some indication of trends.\n\nI chose some simple statistical methods to analyse the data; I looked at each month in turn over the 15 year period and calculated for each month and for each station:\n\nthe mean rainfall\n\nstandard deviation\n\ncoefficient of variation; it was this measure that I was really looking for; see below:\n\nThe coefficient of variation ( Cv )is a measure of the spread of data that describes the amount of variability relative to the mean. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean.\n\nvalues close to zero indicate that the the data set shows a lower degree of variability and vice versa; In the results section I will give just the Cv (not the mean or SD )\n\nSo if the data shows a Cv of say 0.50 what that suggests is that for any one year the actual rainfall received will be in a wide range: 50% above and below the mean. Let’s say average rainfall is 500mm for a month then with a Cv of 0.5 the actual rainfall could be expected to fall within a wide band 250 mm to 750 mm.\n\nNot very predictable.\n\nI carried out the same calculation for the 1985-90 periods so that I could compare the two. I also looked at the pattern of rainfall through the year to see if it changes at all. I wanted to know the following:\n\nHow variable is the annual rainfall total from year to year for each station\n\nFor any given month how variable is the rainfall total over the 15 year period, and in comparison with the shorter 1985-90 period.\n\nWhether the amount of rainfall during the monsoon periods changing and if so how?\n\nWhether the distribution of monthly rainfall changed significantly over the period; is the monsoon coming earlier or later?\n\nThe location of the 4 weather stations\n\nThe monsoon seasons in Sri Lanka;\n\nThere are four monsoon seasons in Sri Lanka:\n\nPeriod Name Comment Regions Affected March – Mid May First Inter-monsoon (FIM) limited impact May-July South West Monsoon (SWM) S.W. Winds Heavy rain Southern Coast, South West, West October- November Second Inter-monsoon (SIM) S.W. winds Heavy rain and tropical cyclones possible South and South West, East coast November – December North East Monsoon (NEM) North east Winds North and East\n\nThat has an impact on the rainfall distribution for different parts of the country;\n\nColombo and Galle in the south west of Sri Lanka both show two rainfall peaks during the year coinciding with the SWM and SIM periods. (not one as I guess many studnets living in Europe ans Notice that the rainfall for SIM is higher on average than for the SWM; not what you would expect from the text books?\n\nSWM SIM\n\nnote: what becomes apparent is that where the monsoon seasons are concerned you cannot generalise; Sri Lanka is different from the sub continent of India. Even within India there are significant departures from the generalised “norm”; so the lesson is not to accept broad generalisations from text books where climate is concerned.\n\nBatticaloa is on the east coast and has a different rainfall pattern; one that is dominated by the NEM.\n\nNEM\n\nnote the vertical scales on the two graphs are not the same; the graphs are there for illustrative purposes only\n\nOf the two, Batticaloa looks like it is the most vulnerable to drought for two reasons;\n\nthere is a long dry period from March through to November when temperatures and evapotranspiration rates are high\n\nThe east coast is heavily dependent therefore on the NEM; if it fails to produce enough rain in November and December, or fails altogether then there is much less groundwater available for crops following on. Reservoirs (called tanks locally) and rivers dry up.\n\nwhen the rains fail\n\nWhat the data shows\n\nLooking at the data there are a couple of general points to begin with:\n\nThe onset of each monsoon period is pretty much fixed give or take a week or so although there is a suggestion that the SWM is arriving slightly earlier ie late April / early May rather than later in May.\n\nActual rainfall for any given month varies quite substantially from average values for that month. The coefficient of variation is high. That is true for both the 1985 period and also the 2000-2015 period. So the monthly averages don’t mean a great deal. Rainfall is variable for any given month and from year to year. From the data I have, I suggest it always has been.\n\nThe NEM is a changeable event; some years wetter some years drier., but not predictable\n\nThe SWM rainfall is on the increase since 2007\n\nIn the North and East the dry season seems to be getting drier, if you add that to a significantly lower monsoon rainfall total as in 2005 – 8, it can spell big problems for farmers: in particular, drought.\n\nWhich bring me on to the last point in part one; why is the rainfall so unpredictable? The reason is that there are several factors at play.\n\nRainfall in the Indian Ocean basin is determined by wind direction; which in turn is heavily influenced by the migration of the ITCZ.\n\nHowever it is also influenced by two other phenomena; which are at least partially dependent on one another..\n\nThe ENSO or El Nino event\n\nThe 3 phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole;\n\nall of which affect sea surface temperatures, and therefore pressure and wind systems.\n\nSimple it isn’t?\n\nAs a taster then here is something to be thinking about.\n\nENSO events:\n\nweak 2004/5, 2006/7\n\nmoderate 2002/3, 2009/10\n\nvery strong 2015/6\n\nIOD dipole:\n\npositive: 2006, 2012\n\nnegative: 2010\n\nYou could have a look at the summary of rainfall data above and see where there may be potential match – ups.\n\nPart 2 looks at how it all works\n\nAppendix: Summary of Results\n\n( for those who are interested in the detail; I have the raw data available on request )\n\nBatticaloa; main rainfall season is the North East Monsoon (NEM)\n\nThe average Cv for 1985-90 is 0.67; the average Cv for 2000-2015 is 1.01\n\nHowever the Cv for the NEM is marginally lower for the period 2000-15\n\nConcentrating on the period 2000-2015:\n\nCv is higher during March to October (dry season); generally >1.0\n\nCv falls slightly during the NEM season; between 0.38 and 0.56\n\noverall drier years in 2001, and 2005/6/7: ? drought ?\n\nJuly is the driest month and there is a suggestion that July is becoming drier over the period: (2000-07 av. 35.75; 08-15 av 24.7)\n\nThe NEM generally starts in November although in 2004,2011,and 2015 it arrived in September\n\nDecember is the wettest month\n\nNEM rainfall was less for the period 2005-2008 and also 2013\n\n2011 was the wettest year during the period at 3581mm (80% above average\n\n2. Jaffna: main rainfall season is the North East Monsoon (NEM) plus possibly the Second Inter-monsoon (SIM)\n\nThe average Cv for 1985-90 is high; 0.86 and is even higher in 00-15; 0.97\n\nLooking at the period 2000-15\n\nCv is much higher during drier months; range 0.72 – 1.46 and lower during the NEM at around 0.47\n\nCv is also lower at 0.44 during October (SIM)\n\ndrier years were; 2002/3, 2005/6, 2009, 2012/3\n\nJune/July are the driest months and are becoming drier; 2002-7 av 48.5mm, 08-15 av 18.4mm\n\nNEM arrives in November in 12 of 15 years\n\nNovember is wettest month\n\nNEM rainfall was much lower 2006-8 and 2013/4; 2009/11 NEM rainfall was above average\n\n2015 was the wettest year in the period at 1839 mm but was only 10% above the average for the NEM\n\nA possible question to investigate is the degree to which Jaffna may be affected by the SIM given its location.\n\nCommon to both\n\nhigh variability from year to year especially in the dry season\n\ndecreasing rainfall in June/July\n\ndrier 2005-8 and 2013\n\n3.

Galle: affected by 3 seasons. First Inter Monsoon (FIM), South West Monsoon (SWM), Second Inter Monsoon (SIM); although FIM impact is negligible\n\nIn comparison with Colombo the Cv’s are slightly lower than for Colombo but still >0.5 for both periods but there is no significant difference between the Cv values for the two time periods.\n\nLooking at the period 2000-15\n\nCv is does not drop during SWM although it does so for the SIM\n\n2001/2 and 2013 were drier years,\n\nSWM shows increasing average 00-07 av 162.3 mm; 08-15 av 268.1 with similar increase for May; The SIM data does not show a trend betond a slightly drier October and a slightly wetter November\n\nJanuary shows a decreasing average from 00-07 av 116mm to 08-15 av 82mm\n\nJanuary is the driest month, October is the wettest month\n\nOctober marks the arrival of the SIM\n\nApril/ May marks the arrival of the SWM\n\nAs with Colombo signs are that the onset of the SWM is bring heavier rainfall; 00-07 av for April was 162mm for May was 241mm and for 08-15 av for April increased to 268mm and 298mm respectively.\n\n2007 and 2010 were the wettest years (32% above average)\n\nCommon to Colombo and Galle\n\nrainfall is decreasing in January\n\nrainfall is increasing in April; onset of SWM is bringing heavier rainfall\n\nsuggestion that monsoon is getting earlier\n\nColombo floods; getting relief to the victims\n\nAs flood waters start to recede they have been replaced by a different flood; the flood of blame and recrimination. A number of journalists have been quick to lay blame in several areas, including the meteorological office, the disaster management centre and the government. However, whilst journalists and politicians wasted time looking for scapegoats others got on with a much more important job; getting help and aid to the flood victims\n\nThe government would have it that the flood was the result of all those poor people who built on marshland. As a result they have said that they will be removing upwards of 2500 families from unauthorised sites; (see Sunday Times 12th June) This is either ignorance or political sophistry.\n\n“The squatter families will not be offered compensation or alternative locations, Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLRDC) Chairmnan W.M.A.S. Iddawala told the Sunday Times. He said that in a survey carried out after last month’s devastating floods, the corporation had identified the squatter families which should be evicted.” Sunday Times\n\nWhile some properties may have inhibited the flow of flood water in and around the canals they did not cause the flood.\n\nBuilding on marshland does not cause a flood. It might put people in harm’s way, but it doesn’t cause a flood to happen.The sheer volume of water falling on an unprotected catchment is what caused the flood.\n\nSo why the evictions? We can only guess\n\nit is always convenient to have a scapegoat to divert attention away from the failings of the government and its officials\n\nthey will not have to pay compensation to these families\n\nit is part of a broader government strategy of relocating families in unauthorised settlements into the government built apartment complexes currently springing up around the city\n\nA vulnerable population\n\nA good place to start is to define what vulnerable means in this context. Two aspects need to be borne in mind;\n\nthe immediate physical vulnerability to the danger of flood\n\nthe longer term vulnerability to the economic impacts of the flood\n\nWhy were so many people exposed to this devastating flood and its longer term impacts? A number of factors contributed to render the population vulnerable;\n\nThe areas around Colombo are low-lying and flood prone\n\nthere are no effective flood defences in place to control the Kelani Ganga\n\nSuburban population densities are high quite close to the main river and its tributaries\n\nPopulation densities in the Colombo area source: researchgate\n\nHousing density is high and many of the side lanes are narrow which would later hamper rescue and relief efforts\n\nMost households are in the lower middle to low income bracket and not able to withstand the financial impact of losses due to the flood\n\nHow many had adequate insurance cover? None; as one person told me; “it isn’t in the Sri Lankan culture to purchase home insurance”\n\nFlood Impact\n\nIn all more than 150,000 people were temporarily displaced by the flood. Although relatively few homes were completely lost many have suffered water damage, small shops kades and bakehouses have lost their stocks of goods to sell, livelihoods have been wrecked, many have lost all their possessions in the flood and will find it hard t replace them.\n\nThis is Imi’s story. She lives with her mother and infirm grandparents in Welivita, part of Kaduwela to the north-east of the city. This is what the flood meant to families such as hers.\n\nDisaster Relief\n\nThe Disaster Management Centre should have been the body to co-ordinate flood relief efforts. However, at the height of the flood it was under 2 metres of water; not ideal. They did warn of the impending flood and they did issue evacuation alerts and to be fair other measures were put in place once the flood struck:\n\n1500 military personnel were organised into 81 teams and deployed to the flood areas, as were the police\n\nboats were provided to rescue trapped households from roofs and upper stories\n\nsafe areas were identified and evacuation centres set up\n\nrescued families were transported to the evacuation sites where there were emergency rations, blankets etc\n\nHowever, good as this was there doesn’t seem to have been much coordination of the relief effort. The President did instruct the local officials the Grama Niladahri to visit all affected areas and people in their districts to get an idea of what the problems were, and who was in most need of help but according to this Sunday Times report the response was at best patchy.\n\nand there were problems:\n\nsome evacuation centres were overrun and became heavily congested\n\nthe emergency relief packages were pitifully small and not everyone got them\n\nthere was a mismatch in terms of what was needed and what was given; victims urgently needed clothing, sanitary wear and medicines; they didn’t receive much of any of these\n\nthere were not enough boats available to rescue people\n\nsome houses, especially the less accessible, were never visited by the rescuers\n\ncalls for help made to the disaster centres went unanswered in some cases. For many help never came.\n\nQuestions have also been raised about where all the foreign aid went because it certainly didn’t reach many of the victims if newspaper reports are to be believed. This from the Sunday Times 12th June:\n\n“Three weeks after floods ravaged many of the areas adjoining the Kelani river communities are waiting for the government machinery to move in to provide aid, rebuild houses and provide other relief. Flood victims stranded in Kelaniya, Kelanimulla and Angoda areas, this week, claimed there was no responsible officer at grassroots level to monitor the process of distributing dry rations to the destitute.”\n\nLocal Volunteers\n\nIn the vacuum left by what some see as government ineptitude local volunteer groups sprung up in different districts across the city. One such group was the Welivita volunteers. Initially they came together to help their friend Imi (see above) However, they could see the need for a wider effort and within in a short time they:\n\norganised themselves into a coherent group with a steering commitee\n\ncreated a facebook page for the group\n\nvisited the area to get an idea of the extent of the problem\n\nwent to the local Grama Niladhari (government official) to identify the families most in need\n\nlaunched an online campaign on facebook for donations\n\nput out regular bulletins on the progress of donations\n\nitemised a list of essential items for relief packs and school packs; all costed out; each cost around 5000 rupees and was paid for by donations. (the value of government aid packs was 1500 rupees and wasnt necessarily what people wanted or needed)\n\ncollected the packs and then distributed to needy families\n\nwhen that was done they embarked on a clean up of Imi’s house and the areas nearby\n\nThey did this in the space of two weeks: and you can check out their page Welivita Volunteers where you will get full details on what they did, how they did it and also a good selection of photos which graphically illustrate their work;\n\nSo the point about their work was that it was:\n\ncarefully structured and organised throughout\n\nbureaucracy was kept at a minimum\n\ntargeted at those in most need\n\ndelivered quickly and without fuss into the hands of the needy\n\nnot expensive\n\nComment\n\nAfter the 2004 Tsunami the people were told that in future the government would be ready; those scenes of chaos in 2004 could not happen again..that does not seem to be the case. Looking through recent newspaper articles it would seem that the government effort raises more questions than answers;\n\nWhere did all the emergency aid go? Many complain that they have not seen any of it.\n\nJournalists slate the government for complacency and inactivity\n\nWhy was the Disaster Management Centre located in a flood prone area? It is worth noting that millions of rupees worth of telecommunications equipment stored at the DMC has also been ruined in the flood\n\nWhere was the co-ordination necessary to mount a coherent disaster management plan.. indeed where was the plan?\n\nAfter events like this one governments all over the world (certainly in the UK) drone on about lessons to be learned.. evidence is that those lessons are rarely learned. However, there are some take away points:\n\nMaybe it is time to look at flood prevention especially in the upper Kelani basin. It will be expensive in the short run but will save in the longer term. Have a look at flood prevention schemes on the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers, in Los Angeles, USA for an example. flood retention dams in the upper course, flood spreading zomes in the lower course, channel improvements, engineering of the channel of the kelaqni, raising the river banks.. these could all be looked at.\n\nBy all means give people alternatives to living in marshy areas and on the banks of the Kelani, but these should be viable alternatives and in consultation with those living in those areas.\n\nA proper disaster management contingency plan for flooding needs to be in place. Military personnel need to be trained. Boats need to be available.\n\nThere needs to be someone of ministerial rank in charge of flood relief; clearly the DMC is not up to the job.\n\nThere needs to be some recognition that roles need to be specialised.\n\nThere are two stages to a flood event like this:\n\nInitially the need is for search and rescue; the military are best placed to do this; I suspect that if they had been in charge the rescue operation would have been properly coordinated and way more efficient. They have the helicopters to overfly flooded areas and provide first hand intelligence to direct the rescue effort plus they have a command network that would be effective in these situations\n\nOnce rescue is underway the focus is on relief and the government could learn a great deal from the work of the local volunteers; how they organised themselves, targeted relief on those in greatest need, paid heed to what the victims needed and so on.\n\nThey might also consider how they might utilise the power of social media to better direct their efforts.\n\nThey could think of building on the huge amount of good will shown by local people to the victims by setting up local part time or volunteer flood relief groups who could be trained as a first line of the relief effort and mobilised at times of flood.\n\nOne thing is for sure; the river will flood again whether people are living on marshland or not. The question as ever, is will the government be ready?\n\nColombo Floods 2016\n\nThe South West Monsoon hit Sri Lanka hard in 2016. The heavy rains have resulted in landslides in Kegalle and flooding in Colombo for example, which have displaced more than 300,000 across the island with at least 58 left dead and a further 130 missing.\n\nNow in 2017 the monsoon season has been accompanied by large scale flooding and mudslides which have left 202 dead and 600,000 people displaced. The areas around Rathnapura and Kalutara have been badly affected but, Matara in the south of the island has also suffered serious flooding. In all the floods and landslides have destroyed 1,735 houses and damaged 9,432 while 146 schools were also damaged –\n\nPredictably, for some it all turns out to be the government’s fault; but it isn’t.\n\nClimate change in South Asia is a reality and one of the outcomes is that rainfall will become less predictable and the frequency of extreme rainfall events is set to increase. Sri Lanka needs to brace itself for more events like this, and do you know what? In the short run there isn’t much anyone can do about it.\n\nThe 2016 flood; what happened?\n\nMay is statistically the start of the South West Monsoon in Sri Lanka and brings rain to the South and West of the country.\n\nAs any A level geographer will tell you (putting it simply); the South West monsoon season is the result of a seasonal reversal in wind direction, from North East ( off the landmass) to South West (off the ocean)\n\nThis year the Indian sub-continent ( and also Sri Lanka) has been suffering big time from heatwaves which have seen the temperatures soar above 40 deg C. for weeks on end. High land temperatures vis-a-vis the ocean, create an air pressure imbalance; lower air pressure over the land higher over the ocean, an creates an airflow from the Indian Ocean on to the land masses of Sri Lanka and India. The bigger the difference in temperature and air pressure between the two the stronger the inflow of air towards the continent. Warm wet air rising over the landmass = rain.\n\ntypical SWM situation; credit: one data.edu\n\nBut this year the monsoon has arrived with a vengeance\n\nWhy the heavy rain?\n\nSo we already have a set up whereby the winds are coming from the South-West.. from the warm ocean surface. However, you have to factor in a low pressure system that formed in the Indian Ocean to the East of the island and developed into a tropical storm which has moved northwards towards India. As it developed it set up a strong inflow of “wet” air coming off the Indian Ocean and the Island land mass forced that wet air upwards, leading to torrential rain. So this is just a sketch to give the reader an idea of what is going on, where the winds are coming from.\n\nsatellite image of the depression\n\nso the depression is the white blob of cloud north of Sri Lanka.It is now moving North -East. What you have to imagine is that the air flow is inward/upward and anti-clockwise reaching way back into the western Indian Ocean; those thicker cloud elements suggest more rain to come!\n\nA note on depressions for the uninitiated\n\na low pressure system or depression creates an inflow of air in a broadly anti-clockwise spiral. Warm air heated from below rises.. the warmer the air the faster and higher it rises. As it rises it cools, condenses and produces cloud and rain.\n\nhere we are interested in the diagram on the right; credit the britishgeographer\n\nThe Indian Ocean this time of year is warm in any case; but I read that the surface ocean temperature may be around 31deg C. which is way above where it should be, and that is only likely to make things worse.\n\nNb; This isn’t a local effect however as some seem to think, but related to global circulation patterns\n\nSo in this case very warm moist air spirals upwards. As air condenses to form water droplets it releases heat back into the rising air.. it fuels more uplift.. clouds reach up higher into the atmosphere resulting in the formation of cumulus clouds stretching high up towards the tropopause. As a rule of thumb the stronger the uplift the lower the air pressure and with it the stronger the inflow of surface winds at the base of the depression.\n\nThe net result; torrential rainfall, strong winds and violent thunderstorms.\n\nFlooding in Colombo\n\nAccording to some, the construction of the large lakes such as the Diyawanna lakes and the improvements to the canals and drainage systems was supposed to mean that Colombo would not suffer any more from floods like the 2011 flood. Maybe this was wishful thinking, however.\n\nColombo district will always be vulnerable to flash flooding because:\n\nlarge areas are low lying; no more than 5 metres above sea\n\nthe land gradient is slight so water has nowhere to drain away\n\nlarge areas are urbanised which reduces infiltration, and exacerbates surface flow\n\nRivers like the Kelani river flow off the west flanks of the central highlands which have been receiving high levels of precipitation. That flood water is eventually going to end up on the lowland. Colombo sits on the natural flood plain of the Kelani Ganga and the river does periodically what rivers do.. it floods especially when it is choked with sediment washing done from the central uplands.\n\non top of this heavy rainfall and intense thunderstorms are common occurrences in the Colombo district\n\nThis does seem to be an extreme event, however. Over 300mm of rain fell right across the catshment, both in the upper and lower reaches ( as much as could be expected in a month) Intense rainfall on to an urban surface had nowhere to go.\n\nThe Kelani Hydrograph\n\na hydrograph plots the way rivers react to an intense rainfall event. I found this one which is taken from the 2005 flood. What you can see is that the river reacts quite quickly to rainfall events.. less than 24 hours it seems:\n\nPoints to note:\n\nvery steep rising limb\n\nshort time lag from peak rainfall to peak discharge\n\nhigh volume of peak flow\n\ngentle falling limb; flow is still high3 days later\n\nIf you study the Kelani valley in the hills where it rises you can see why it will flood downstream\n\ncredit: Dhammika Heenpalla\n\nthe valley is steep sided which would accelerate rainfall into the channel as surface flow and throughflow\n\nthe slopes are long and locally rainfall is high so a large amount of rainfall will end up in the channel very quickly\n\nthere is no flood plain for flood water to spread over\n\nso all the floodwater is penned up in the valley unable to escape; instead thundering down to the lowland plains to the west.\n\nImpact\n\nIt’s too early to assess the damage caused by the landslides and flooding across the island. What we do know is that over 200 families are missing with 58 pronounced dead following landslides in the central uplands that engulfed 3 villages.\n\nAcross the island upwards of 300,000 people have been rendered temporarily homeless. The cost in terms of damage to property will become clearer as time passes. In the meantime a huge relief operation is swinging into place with the Sri Lankan armed forces at the forefront of rescue and relief efforts.\n\nWho will be shouldering the cost?\n\nMore than likely the lower middle and low income groups whose homes have been engulfed or inundated.\n\nIn Colombo, those living in unofficial shelters next to the Kelani river, those in the low lying suburbs around Colombo;\n\nand it is just worth thinking about what it means for a family to see their home flooded, their possessions ruined; and in the main these are families who cannot easily bear the cost of putting there home back together\n\nMy friend Imi’s house; this is the reality of flooding: putting her mother’s house back together will take way more money than they have; life is set to be difficult for sometime to come and what you need to do is multiply that by 300,000 to get an idea of what this means for a small island like Sri Lanka\n\nWe might “study” this as a hazard event BUT let’s also remember that this is very much a human tragedy.\n\nFor some stark video footage check out http://www.sundaytimes.lk the online page and scroll down the front page to the video links.\n\nLast thought\n\nAs with the UK a couple of years ago, when we get an extreme weather event it is almost “de rigeur” to blame the authorities for not anticipating the event and protecting against it. It seems it always has to be someone’s fault. The same appears to be happening in Sri Lanka. I saw a Sunday Times.lk opinion piece asking; ‘why is this happening again?” Well unfortunately that is nature for you. What did people expect? That the government could simply tell the rain to go away?\n\nPoint is that we live in an increasingly hazardous world which we do not control and cannot always predict. If we choose to live in areas which can become vulnerable to hazards such as flooding and landslides we need to accept that when these extreme events occur we are at risk. That doesn’t mean that efforts should not be made to moderate the impact of these events\n\nGiven that the outcome of climate change may well mean an increase in extreme weather events (among other things) a question that might be asked is what is being done to moderate the impacts of future events\n\nThe meteorological department based in Colombo is already on the case; a great deal of research is already underway on a range of issue related to weather and climate and is well worth checking out: try this out: http://www.meteo.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=200&lang=en\n\nBut the met office need access to much more powerful computing power and technology if the aim is to improve the forecasts\n\nSo knowledge is the first step but then it comes down to what the government intend to do with that knowledge. The danger could be that in the rush for economic development planning for an increasingly hazardous environment may not be a high priority.. that would be a mistake.\n\nSo what might need to be done.\n\nSeems to me understanding where the flood water comes from is a starting point. Does the Kelani River need for its banks to be raised higher?\n\nIs there a need for engineering solutions to control/impound water in the central highlands in the event of high rainfall as for instance the Los Angeles river in southern California so that Western Province is less at risk?\n\nCan anything be done to increase the flow of floodwater from drains and canals to the sea?\n\nIn the highlands is it time to re-forest the slopes of the hills to stabilise them and reduce the landslide hazard? Should geological surveys be undertaken to identify and map areas of high vulnerability\n\nShould people be moved away from dangerous locations?\n\nAll basic stuff isn’t it but that’s where the thinking needs to go; its an old saying but prevention is much better than a cure and in the long run less expensive.\n\nThe point is that this type of extreme event will happen again and again; all the predictions point in that direction. What the government needs to do now is put in place a coherent disaster management plan, with a senior minister at the helm to co-ordinate rescue and recovery and possibly to take control away from ineffective and self seeking officials and politicians who have shown that they are not up to the task.\n\nIn the follow on article i will be looking at the relief effort, the declaration of flood areas as high security zones and what can be done to help mitigate against future floods.\n\nJust published; have a look also at this from CEPA\n\nSri Lanka Floods 2016: Avoiding the Mistakes of 2004\n\nWaldringfield UK; a community led flood protection project\n\nIn 2013 a storm surge in the North Sea threatened communities up and down the East coast of the UK. Whilst many coastal settlements had benefited from flood protection schemes others like Waldringfield, a small village on the Deben estuary in Suffolk were left out of the loop and vulnerable. So when the surge came the inevitable result was flooding to the village.\n\nDespite the flood there were no plans to put flood protection in place. Instead of taking a fatalistic view, however, the local community came together to raise the funds to create, not only an effective flood protection scheme (one of the first of its kind in the UK), but at the same time create a nature reserve to enhance the local area. This case study is the story of how this project developed.\n\nWhat is a storm surge?\n\nStorms along the coast can cause sea levels to rise way above their normal level which leads to coastal flooding. So what causes a storm surge? The two diagrams taken from the UK Meteorological Office site explain how this can happen.\n\nA deep low pressure cell (depression) moves eastwards into the North Sea basin.\n\nThe low pressure at the centre of the storm “pulls” the water level up, by about 1 cm for every 1 millibar change in pressure.\n\nsource: UK meteorological office\n\nAs the depression moves down the North Sea basin it generates high winds from a northerly direction. The winds push the sea water southwards and towards the coast, causing it to “pile up” along the coast, raising the sea level and creating a “surge”. This is a predictable event. The residents in Waldringfield knew 24 hours in advance that the surge was on its way, for example.\n\nThe strong winds in the storm generate large waves on top of the surge which can cause damage to sea defences, or spill over the top of sea walls adding to the flood risk.\n\nsource: UK meteorological office\n\nIntroducing Waldringfield\n\nWaldringfield is a small village on the west bank of the river Deben in Suffolk, on the East coast of the United Kingdom. The village comprises 225 houses with a population of 464 (2012). The village has a village hall, pub, boatyard and is home to Waldringfield Yacht Club.\n\nThe maps below show the location of Waldringfield in Suffolk and in the UK\n\nThe 2013 Flood\n\nOn the 5 December, 2013 a large storm surge hit the east coast of the UK causing widespread flooding along the coast. This was a prime example of low pressure, high winds and high tidal conditions combining to create surge conditions;\n\nIt was the largest tidal surge since 1953 and water levels were actually higher than in 1953\n\nMany East coast estuaries were flooded; The Stour, Deben and Orwell rivers all reported flood damage.\n\nWaldringfield is on the Deben estuary and suffered significant flooding on the river frontage. The following is the list of damage:\n\nThe river wall to the north of the village was overtopped, causing flooding of the meadow behind it.\n\nThe boatyard and about 18 residences on the Quay were also flooded to a depth of about 5 feet, as well as several beach huts and land to the south of the village.\n\nThere was one casualty, who was taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\nThe fire service attended to a fire around 1.30am, which was caused by the flood water shorting the electric gates of a property on the Quay.\n\nA heating oil tank and a gas tank floated off it stand, but, fortunately, remained attached to it feed pipes\n\nThe river wall was badly damaged in places, but it wasn’t breached.\n\nThe total cost of the damage and repairs was estimated to be: £10 million overall\n\nThe Waldringfield Flood Defence Group (WFDG)\n\nThe group got together informally 6 months prior to the flood. They were aware of the flood risk plus they were also aware that Waldringfield was not included in existing flood protection schemes for the Deben estuary. This was possibly because only 18 properties and the boat yard were at risk of flood at that time. (even though the real estate value of those properties is possibly above £20 million\n\nNote: The village of Waldringfield stretches about 1km inland from the river Deben and the majority of the village sits well above flood level. The lane known as The Quay is the area liable most likely to flood in the village, see map below:\n\nWhen the flood occurred, and with no direct help from the government forthcoming, the 18 affected households formed The Waldringfield Flood Defence Group (WFDG). It had significant support from a number of sources including: The Environment Agency, Suffolk Coastal District Council. The Deben Estuary Partnership, Waldringfield Parish Council, Lord Deben, Chairman of the UK’s Independent Committee on Climate Change, and the local MP, Dr Therese Coffey. Very quickly the group came up with a plan to create a two stage project for the immediate area area: this involved:\n\nan outline plan for the design of new flood defences; including a raised sea wall 1km in length, flood gates, and movable flood barriers to protect the boatyard (completed within 3 months)\n\nthe protection and preservation of a freshwater meadow and marshland habitat north of the village through the repair and strengthening of the river wall.\n\nrestoration of salt marsh which would add to the protection the sea wall.\n\nFunding for the £1million project was achieved mainly through grants, including £633,000 from the Government’s Coastal Community Fund. The initial work on the salt marsh was partly funded by the Suffolk Coast & Heaths Area of Outstanding Beauty unit.), and is visible at low tide. A further 1,000m of protection is being funded by the Coastal Communities fund at a cost of £100,000\n\nHow do salt marshes protect flood defences?\n\nSalt marshes play a major role in flood defence. Salt marshes are effective buffers to wave action, by creating shallow water which reduces the power of waves. The wider the salt marsh the the more effective it is in protecting the sea wall. One study carried out at Cambridge University found that “salt marshes can reduce the height of damaging waves in storm surge conditions by close to 20%”\n\nWhat has been achieved?\n\nStage 1: Raising the flood defences: protecting homes, businesses and jobs.\n\nThe live link will take you to the project page which details each step in the process. Stage 1 was completed in February 2015. The main points are as follows:\n\nA new reinforced wall was built in front of the properties on The Quay at 3.5m OD. Each of the riverside properties now has its own steel reinforced gate to allow access to the footpath\n\nA steel flood barrier was erected next to the boatyard. This can be closed by the Environment Agency in the event of a flood warning.\n\nRemovable steel barriers have been erected in the boatyard; they will be removed to allow boats access to the river for launching but can be put in place in the event of a flood warning. (see below)\n\nStage 2: Raising the river wall: repairing a footpath and creating a freshwater wildlife reserve\n\nThe live link will take you to the project page which details each step in the process. Stage 2 was completed in October 2015.\n\nThe main object of the scheme has been to create a wildlife reserve on a freshwater marsh area, which was formerly owned by the local vicar. When he died his executors agreed to allow the conversion of part of the farmland to a lagoon and nature reserve.\n\nThe lagoon area at present is bare.. it looks like a building site.. but it has been planted with sedges and within a few years it will naturalise to form an attractive habitat for birds and mammals, such as the water vole and a family of otters.\n\nsee small scale map for location\n\nAfter the flood there was concern over state of sea wall to north of village and the footpath which was also damaged when flood water overtopped the wall. So a decision was made to flatten the top of the wall and to widen the footpath.\n\nThe footpath is now much wider and more level as the photo below shows. Some locals probably feel that it is unnatural but access has been improved, and the path is accessible and usable all year. Access to the nature reserve will also be improved for locals and visitors alike.\n\nthe footpath looking north; now wider and flatter\n\nSalt marsh restoration\n\nThe saltmarsh in front of the sea wall to the north of the village varies in width. Immediately north of the village it is quite degraded; see below but widens out . The WFDG scheme allows for the installation of brushwood fences which have been installed in the marsh in front of the sea wall. The hope is that these fences will trap sediment on the outgoing tide and help to build up the marsh in front of the sea wall to add some degree of additional protection to the sea wall and the footpath. There remains another 1000 metres of fencing to install to complete the job.\n\nthe degraded salt marsh\n\nbrushwood fences in place to protect the sea wall\n\nLocal community action: is this the way forward?\n\nThis scheme is the first of its kind so far as I can tell and The Environment Agency is keen to use this project as a pilot to demonstrate how local communities projects such as this one can be the forerunner for other schemes which fall outside of government support.\n\nThe WFDG were successful because:\n\nthey were already organized\n\nthey had the necessary skills to produce a fully drawn up and costed project plan\n\nthey had the skills to lobby for financial support\n\nthey acted quickly\n\nthey worked together and without internal wrangling/disagreement\n\n2. The value of the community based approach was that they designed it themselves and so it was fit for their purpose; basically they got what they wanted but also created a scheme with significant utility and value to the village as a whole.\n\n3. At the same time they turned it into a multi purpose project by:\n\nprotecting the sea wall\n\ncreating a much more accessible and usable footpath alongside the river, an improved amenity for all\n\nworking with the estate of the recently deceased vicar to create the wildlife reserve which will be of broad ecological value but also will provide a real amenity to be enjoyed by locals and visitors and will add to the attractiveness of the riverside\n\nI recently interviewed Janette Brown, the secretary of the Waldringfield Flood Defence Group and started by asking her to take us back to the night of the flood.
