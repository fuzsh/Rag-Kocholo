It is a place where the original soul of Buddhism still flourishes and where natureâ€™s beauty remains abundant and unspoilt.\n\nFew places in the world can offer the traveller such a remarkable combination of stunning landscapes, pristine beaches, captivating cultural heritage and unique experiences within such a compact location. Within a mere area of 65,610 kilometres lie 8 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 1,330 kilometres of coastline - much of it pristine beach - 15 national parks showcasing an abundance of wildlife, nearly 500,000 acres of lush tea estates, 250 acres of botanical gardens, 350 waterfalls, 25,000 water bodies, to a culture that extends back to over 2,500 years.\n\n(Courtesy:www.gov.lk /Sri Lanka Tourism)\n\nFlag description:\n\nThe National Flag of Sri Lanka represents the country and her heritage as rallying device that integrates the minorities with the majority race.\n\nSri Lanka National Flag is an improvisation of the civil standard of the last king of Sri Lanka, Sri Wickrama Rajasingha.\n\nThe civil standard had a passant royal lion with a sword in its right fore paw at the center, and a bo-leaf on each of the four corners on a plain border.\n\nWhen Sri Lanka gained her independence from Great Britain on February 04, 1948, it was the lion flag of the last king of Sri Lanka was hoisted once again.\n\nThe first Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka, D.S.Senanayake, appointed a committee to advice the government on the design of a new national flag. The design approved by the committee in February 1950 retained the symbol of the lion with the sword and the bo-leaves from the civil standard of the last king of Sri Lanka, with the inclusion of two vertical stripes green and orange in colour. the significance of each symbol of the national flag is as follows:\n\nThe lion in the flag represents the Sinhala race.\n\nThe sword of the lion represents the sovereignty of the country.\n\nCurly hair on the lion's head indicates religious observance, wisdom and meditation.\n\nThe beard denotes purity of words.\n\nThe handle of the sword highlights the elements of water, fire, air and earth.\n\nThe nose indicates intelligence.\n\nThe two front paws purport to purity in handling wealth.\n\nThe vertical stripe of orange represent the minority Tamil race and the green vertical stripe the minority Muslim race.\n\nThe four virtues of kindness: KINDNESS, FRIENDLINESS, HAPPINESS, EQUANIMITY are also represented in the flag.\n\nThe border round the flag, which is yellow in colour, represents other minor races.\n\nThe bo-leaves at the four corners of the flag represent Buddhism and its influence on the nation. They also stand for the four virtues - Kindness, Friendliness, Happiness and Equanimity.\n\nThe maroon coloured portion of the flag manifests the other minor religions.\n\nThe national flag was hoisted for the first time on March 3, 1950\n\n(Courtesy: www.gov.lk )"
