Definitions

the invention relates generally to the fields of both artificial intelligence and machine consciousness and, more particularly, to a method and device for the unification and origination of knowledge within connectionist systems.

the thalamus has been described as the âeyeballâ or âprojection screenâ of the brain, monitoring the continuously evolving cortical activity that may be thought of as the brain's âmultimedia show,â while also serving as a trigger for global or âvolumeâ release of neurotransmitters into the cortex.

memory and processors are so heavily taxed that any monitoring algorithm needs to run either intermittently as a separate thread or process on the same computational platform.

these synthetic cortical systems become more extensive and complex it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate the formation of associative chains that reveal important relationships or the emergence of novel patterns tantamount to ideas and improvisational strategies.

a mechanism is provided for herein which locates unusual or useful neural activation patterns and chains arising within the entire neural assembly that could qualify as potential ideas or action plans.

a confabulation may be thought of as a false memory activating within either a biological or synthetic neural net, which may or may not prove useful or informative to a critic agency, the latter being either protoplasmic or artificial.

neurotransmitter release is thought of as localized, as in the transmission of packets of molecules across the synaptic cleft between neurons, tantamount to the current in an artificial neural network between two computational processing units.

volume or global neurotransmitter release is not specific to any synapse and is the result of biological neurons specialized in suffusing many synapses simultaneously within the brain's neural networks with neurotransmitters.

global neurotransmitter release is simulated though various forms of perturbations and disturbances to connection weights and/or computational neurons.

This patent teaches various methods for the unification and origination of knowledge as well as both exteroceptive and interoceptive awareness within artificial neural systems consisting of a plurality of artificial neural modules.

the unification process occurs at several levels:

the cortical and thalamic functions may be divided between at least two separate computational platforms or subsystems.

cortical function is generated, driven by both external events and/or internal noise so as to produce a succession of activation chains tantamount to ideas.

the thalamic system the second subsystem, may be implemented on a separate processor, platform, or thread using a sensor to monitor a display (e.g., visual, auditory) of neuronal activations within the cortical simulation.

the thalamic algorithm may asynchronously scan this cortical display to glean the succession of cortical states, typically at much higher rates than could be attained via multithreading or serial communications.

filters in the form of adaptive anomaly and/or rhythm detectors isolate newly emerging concepts in the form of chaining or networking neural modules.

Subsequent stages within the cortical or thalamic system consist of one or more neural modules that map the patterns or topologies collectively represented within such chains to metrics of utility, value, or novelty. These subsequent stages may themselves take the form of chains of neural modules, the location, shape, and/or topology of which represents some figure of novelty, utility, or value.

Topology refers to the connectivity between neural modules determined either through connection weight pathways or the learned order of pattern broadcasts among them.

the same thalamic system may have the ability to modulate global noise levels within the cortical subsystem via serial or parallel communications or reciprocal sensor schemes, allowing it to raise perturbation levels should satisfactory solution patterns not be initially found. Having found a valuable associative chain or network, tantamount to a concept or action plan, the thalamic system has the ability to cease perturbations and harvest the notion or trigger other algorithms to implement the idea or strategy.

the same thalamic algorithm also has the ability to trigger adaptive learning in the case that a potentially useful ideational chaining topology forms, thus strengthening the connectivity of that topology as a latent memory that may later be called upon under similar environmental circumstances, be activated through stochastic/perturbative processes, or to be used as a component of more complex notions, through the fusion of it with other such memories.

Such a system may serve as a laboratory to observe the emergence of consciousness from component neurons and neural modules, using various affordances to monitor for the evolution of self-reflection and interpretation (i.e., the invention of significance to itself). Used in this way, the displays of cortical activations, along with thalamobot detection/feedback, will become an important research tool for identifying the neural correlates of cognition, creativity, and consciousness.

the current system relates to an enhanced manner of operation of Creativity Machines, imagitron-perceptron coalitions between which inventive dialogs occur, such as are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,659,666 and 7,454,388, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Inherent to such neural architectures is a bottleneck between the imagitron and perceptron components that becomes more pronounced as the generative network, tantamount to the brain's cortex, is increased in size or if it becomes compound in nature, encompassing myriad sub-networks.

the system may involve the use of an output device, such as a computer monitor (e.g. CRT flat panel LED, LCD, etc.) or other visual media (e.g., LCD, LED, projectors) or other sensory output devices, to present the neural activation patterns of an imagitron or other connectionist architecture that can in turn be sensed or scanned by an input device in communication with filtering and evaluation systems (e.g., perceptrons).

the output is via a visual output that can in turn be scanned for valuable or novel activation patterns via a camera or other such sensors.

a linear or raster scan is utilized to observe the succession of patterns.

a foveational scheme such as that described in U.S. Pat. No.

this âfoveationalâ process corresponds to the population polling of a collection of neurons whose activation center of gravity dictates where the eyeball looks.

this cognitive process corresponds to the movement of an internal attention window over visual cortex to focus on certain pieces of the brain's working image of the external environment.

this process is achieved using internally perturbed neural nets to chaotically move an attention window around an environment until it clips or captures an item or activity of interest to a critic algorithm or neural net that then reduces the noise within the former net so that the attention window becomes trapped on the item of interest.

the environment is not the external environment, but a model of an environment that may be attained via a system of chaining neural modules.

the system operates similarly to the interaction between the cortex and thalamus in the human brain, with the monitoring sensor and thalamobot, tantamount to the reptilian brain, shifting its attention to newly emerging neural activation patterns appearing within the visual display. If multiple visual outputs are used, the system can serve in the detection of important spatial-temporal connections/correlations between emergent patterns in the various displays thus unifying them into more complex associations, achieving complex graph analysis without a super-computer.

a technique is taught herein for using sensor based technology such as cameras to scan two or three dimensional displays of global neural activation so to either (1) focus in on novel pattern formation within the connectionist array, or (2) eliminate all but the factual associations forming as in an advanced data mining applications, or (3) integrate the activations of multiple neural modules so as to achieve highly complex mappings.

the systems described herein may be implemented with neural network simulations or hardware-implemented neural networks such as GPUs, FPGAs, specialty ASIC chips, as well as non-silicon-based computational systems.

a system for monitoring an environment comprises: an input device for monitoring and capturing pattern-based states of a model of the environment; a thalamobot embodied in at least a first processor, in which the first processor is in communication with the input device.

the pattern-based states of the model of the environment may be generated by an output device which outputs the pattern-based states in the form of reconstruction errors of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron, or in the form of a topology of chains forming in an imagitron, or in the form of activation histories of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron, or in the form of topological chain formation histories of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron.

the model of the environment may be a brain scan.

the thalamobot may be in communication with the computer system on which the model of the environment is generated to modify a level of noise injected into the model, in which raising the level of noise to the model generates new ideas within the model. Alternatively or in addition, the thalamobot may be in communication with the computer system on which the model of the environment is generated to promote learning within the model.

the neural modules may be embodied on an array of processors, or on a single processor.

a system comprises: an imagitron embodied on at least a first processor, in which the imagitron includes a first plurality of neural modules and is capable of accepting environmental inputs; an output device in communication with the imagitron for outputting a state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules; an input device for monitoring the state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules output via the output device; a thalamobot embodied on at least a second processor separate from the at least one first processor, in which the second processor is in electronic communication with the input device and includes at least one filter for monitoring captured data from said input device and for identifying at least one state change data within the captured data; and at least one critic.

the at least one filter forwards the at least one state change to said at least one critic, which judges merit of the at least one state change.

the output device may be a display screen which displays the data in the form of respective reconstruction errors of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules, or in the form of activations of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules.

the output device may also be a speaker.

the filter may be an anomaly filter or a rhythm filter.

the input device may be a camera which captures and transmits data output from the output device in the form of respective reconstruction errors of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules, or in the form of activations of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules.

the input device may be a microphone which transmits output data as captured audio to the thalamobot.

the âsubjective feel of consciousness,â often referred to as âqualia,â are the ineffable and private sensations that are difficult to communicate to an outside observer or to duplicate in machine intelligence.

this phenomenon is simulated through the formation of associative chains of artificial neural nets coined âassociative gestalts,â the term inspired by the fact that memories within such chains likely activate serially in a succession of stored sensory experiences, but the overall impression encoded in such chains is more than the sum of these individual experiences. The whole chain's total significance cannot be surmised in any instant.

FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an example system according to one embodiment.

the system 100 includes a compound imagitron 110 that is comprised of a plurality of neural modules 115 , which serve as the equivalent of a hidden layer within a multilayer perceptron.

the imagitron 110 may be thought of as a model or replica of an environment.

Environmental inputs, E are fed into the imagitron 110 , which forms an intermediate stage between the environment and the input device/thalamobot 130 / 125 .

Non-limiting examples of environments include musical notes, brain scans, video feeds (such as from security cameras, etc.), natural language, packet capture from local and wide area networks, as well as router tables therein, behavioral spaces of robots and control systems, databases, abstract conceptual spaces, etc.

This imagitron 110 /neural modules 115 /hidden layer may be implemented in a first computer system, or a first set of computer systems. Resulting neuron activations or â -error (or 1 â , for instance) of these neural modules 115 may be output via an audio/visual output device (shown in FIG. 1 as an output device, 120 ), which may be an LED monitor or other video or audio display, for example.

An input device 130 such as a camera, is employed to monitor the output device 120 and track the resulting â -errors and/or neural activation chains.

the acquired hidden layer â -errors or chaining topologies are then passed through the remainder of this compound perceptron, which may be implemented on a second computer system or second set of computer systems (referred to herein as the client or thalamobot 125 ).

the thalamabot 125 may be capable of triggering learning or adjusting noise levels within itself or within the imagitron 110 . Such triggering of learning may be achieved by allowing the thalamobot 125 to increase learning rate and/or momentum within the neural modules 115 of either the imagitron 110 or thalamobot 125 .

the output device 120 may incorporate any detectable encoding scheme.

the output device 120 may create a virtual reality environment, thereby allowing the thalamabot 125 to not only translate and rotate its perspective along the x, y, and z axes, but to also âflyâ through the virtual reality representation of the neural system in depth.

the thalamobot 125 may be implemented as a virtual input device or camera in the virtual reality environment the inputs of which are processed by thalamobot algorithms.

the output device 120 may be truly parallel arrays of lights, for examples, LEDs, or laser-based imagitrons, i.e., an optical neural network.

An auditory equivalent output device could emit concurrent frequencies that are frequency filtered by the thalamobot.

the output device 120 may generate concurrent electromagnetic signals.

substantially any form of output/detection may be used.

the input and output devices preferably refer to more than merely a circuit of electronic components in direct electronic communication with one another (insofar as such a structure could be called an âinputâ and an âoutputâ). This is not to say, of course, that such output/detection hardware is generic or common with neural systems.

input device 130 will be referred to herein as a camera

output device 120 will be referred to herein as a video display. However, these are again merely non-limiting examples.

a particularly attractive way of avoiding the above discussed processing bottleneck of prior art neural systems is to display the neural activation state of the neural modules 115 of the imagitron 110 while using the input device 130 attached to the thalamabot 125 to detect the evolution of activations/chains/reconstruction errors of the neural modules 115 (e.g., at approximately 30 frames per second or more).

At least one filter which may be an adaptive anomaly filter, running on the thalamabot 125 may selectively pass only those activation patterns that include state changes from a previous cycle (e.g., newly arising data and/or data that is âunusualâ).

the thalamabot 125 may isolate those regions of the imagitron 110 evolving novel and potentially useful patterns of activation. If the chains representing these ideas connect with modules 115 predicting reward or benefit, the thalamabot 125 could trigger learning among the modules 115 so as to strengthen the chain embodying a promising notion, thus committing this freshly formed idea, possibly along with its evaluation, to memory. The thalamabot 125 may also raise or lower the level of noise introduced into the collection of modules 115 constituting the imagitron 110 .

multicore processors may be used to implement the chaining of neural modules 115 , with each processor implementing its own initially auto-associative neural module.

individual processors may implement multiple neural modules 115 .

An off-board thalamobot 125 on a separate machine or processor, may determine the value of chains as they form, to trigger their strengthening and/or weakening.

FIG. 2 illustrates a representative response of a neural system to increasing levels of mean stochastic synaptic perturbation, â w>.

â w> is defined as mean variation of weights from their trained-in values during any given perturbation cycle in which positive disturbances of equal magnitude are randomly applied to each of the net's weights:

the dashed line of FIG. 2 represents the probability of an intact memory being produced by such weight variation.

the dotted line is the overall rate of pattern generation.

the solid line is the rate of memory generationâthe product of the previous two curves.

the low frequency and tentativeness of pattern delivery, as mean synaptic perturbation is raised, may be exploited by the thalamabot 125 as an indicator that the imagitron 110 is generating novel patterns rather than intact memories.

This is shown by the graph of FIG. 3 , in which D 0 is charted against 1/ln(N), and the more novel and less novel pattern generation areas of the graph are specified.

the ratio of synaptic perturbations and the number of neurons, Np/Nn has been held constant.

the thalamabot 125 may observe which of these nets are involved in novel pattern generation by observing (1) how novel their output patterns are, and/or (2) whether the frequency of their output has slowed and become sporadic.

Such temporal inhomogeneity of pattern output among these nets appears to be the result of local fluctuations in what would be assumed to be a uniform density of synaptic perturbations injected into the neural system at the command of the critic. It is noted that if the perturbed module is connected to a chain, the chain as a whole tends to flicker at the same rhythm.

FIG. 4 shows an associative chain 410 forming among modules 115 as a result of a noise-driven pattern within a seed module 115 A.

GMF group membership filter

One non-limiting approach used to chain individual neural modules 115 relies upon so-called auto-associative neural nets serving as GMFs. Having trained upon patterns representing some genre or subject matter, they respond or âresonateâ to related patterns by generating a low reconstruction error â .

a given âseedâ module 115 A generates an output pattern (due either to an input pattern applied to it, and/or to its internal perturbation shown as starbursts in FIG. 4 ), that pattern may be broadcast to other modules 115 in the system 100 until another module 115 B resonates with that pattern through low reconstruction error â .

the responding module 115 B may broadcast its output pattern to other modules 115 until a third resonant module 115 C is found, etc.

a chain 410 of similar memories forms. It has been found that such chains 410 often (but do not necessarily) terminate upon themselves to form closed loops.

the resulting chain 410 becomes strengthened as the memories within each module 115 come closer to one another. Then with subsequent application of low levels of noise to the system, such self-strengthened chains 410 become more likely to activate. In effect, a neural pathway is worn between certain modules 115 that collectively represent some complex notion or strategy. If all network modules 115 in the chain 410 are perturbed within the U regime of FIG. 1 , then the chain 410 represents a potential discovery of the type U1U2 . . . UN. If the ith module within such an activation chain 410 enters the V or W regimes, it will be of the type U1U2 . . . Vi . . . UN or U1U2 . . . Wi . . . UN, respectively.

U, V, and W refer to the regimes of synaptic perturbation labeled in FIG. 2 .

Another non-limiting variation upon the above similarity linking is hetero-associative bridging.

an intermediate GMF module 115 E which is being perturbed by the addition of noise, is found to resonate with the pattern output by a preceding module 115 D, this intermediate module 115 E may then seek another module 115 F within the ensemble based upon its own perturbed output pattern. Due to such perturbation, the input and output patterns of module 115 E will significantly differ.

the intermediate module 115 E may train to reinforce the hetero-associative map between the input pattern fed to it by a previous module 115 D and its own output pattern fed to the subsequent module 115 F. Cumulatively, such a module 115 E specializes itself into becoming a bridging network to other network modules such as 115 F within the ensemble, rather than expressing content in the form of memories or confabulations thereof.

relational chains e.g., directed graphs, Bayesian nets, and Markov Chains

Another non-limiting approach is a mixed auto- and hetero-associative bridging scheme.

Individual network modules 115 are allowed to train upon input and output patterns representing both auto- and hetero-associative mappings. Subject matter would be encoded as 1s complement of a given pattern and the net trained to replicate that complemented pattern at its output layer. For example, a module 115 G outputs a pattern (act). This pattern is then complimented (actâ²) and transmitted to other modules 115 . The resulting output pattern of node 115 H (actHâ²) is compared with actâ² to determine the reconstruction error â H thereof.

the original output pattern (act) is then fed into module 115 H, resulting in a hetero-associative output of actH.

â H is below a threshold value

the original output pattern (act) is then fed into module 115 H, resulting in a hetero-associative output of actH.

extensive directed graphs would form that could be excited by the application of an appropriate seed pattern.

steps could occur in a different order.

the output of module 115 G (act) may be broadcast before it is complimented.

a resonating module 115 H, whose output has a low reconstruction error â H with output pattern act may then be fed actâ², resulting in the hetero-associative output pattern actHâ².

a network module 115 may also consist of both auto- and hetero-associative portions, the former serving to recognize pattern-based content they are familiar with, and the latter activating through stochastic means to generate an associated pattern that then seeks another module experienced with such content.

the hetero-associative portion of a mixed hetero- and auto-associative module 115 H may broadcast its output actH.

the auto-associative portion of module 115 I may produce an output pattern actI which has a low reconstruction error â with the original input pattern actH, such that module 115 I resonates with hetero-associative output pattern of module 115 H.

module 115 I may then be excited with stochastic inputs to produce an output pattern to be broadcast to all modules 115 .

this network module 115 I would redirect âflowâ to other modules 115 depending upon the information activated within its auto-associative portion, followed by a broadcast of related content by its hetero-associative portion.

anomalous or sporadic activation chains 410 could be located, isolated, and evaluated by the thalamobot 125 for potential utility or value. Those chains 410 having positive or negative significance to one or more critics residing in the thalamobot component 125 or within the imagitron 110 itself could respectively be strengthened through reinforcement learning or weakened through stochastic noise applied during learning.

Modules 115 may be capable of Hebbian learning through chain strengthening, in which connections form between two modules i and j proportional to the product of some function of their simultaneous reconstruction errors (e.g., (1/2 â i)(1/2 â j)). For instance, the equivalent of back propagation among assemblies of GMF modules 115 may occur if some general function of â , F( â ), (e.g., 1/2 â ) is considered its output signal. Then, weight updates between such modules may occur in similar manner to the back propagation weight update rule between individual neurons:

â â â w ij â â â F â ( â i ) â â â â j â F â ( â j ) â F â ( â j )

â w ij is the weight or broadcast channel update between i th and j th GMF modules 115

â is a learning rate

â i and â j are the reconstruction errors of the i th and j th GMF modules 115 .

the resulting weights may be used to bypass the need for exhaustive broadcasts between modules 115 , since broadcast to target modules 115 are temporally prioritized according to the strength of the weight channel leading to them, resulting in more efficient pattern broadcast schedules.

numerical connection strengths may be formed between individual neurons within the modules, modulated in proportion to the weightings developed via the above equation.

chain breaking is chain breaking. If an undesirable chain is recognized, even as it is forming, one or more linked modules may be signaled to complement their output pattern during training so as to spoil their reconstruction errors, â , and hence their auto-associative mappings for a particular input pattern. This leads to the dissolution of the chain. Thereafter this so-called ânaughto-associative netâ will not respond to the same input pattern or patterns, thus detaching itself from any network module broadcasting such a pattern or group of patterns to it. Alternately, noise levels may be elevated during training so as to cause the targeted modules to learn the noise patterns and forget their stored memories.

associative chains within system 100 become unique to a particular environmental feature so that the chains, loops, and supersets 410 repetitively forming become token representations of environmental or noise-activated patterns, in analogy to the hidden layer activations of a multilayer perceptron that are interpreted by downstream layers.

the interpretation of these chains 410 especially in their visual presentation, becomes tantamount to object recognition in the physical world.

One example scheme utilizing acoustic sensors involves the use of different audible tones having characteristic frequencies and durations for each portion of the display (e.g., x coordinate represented by frequency, and y-axis, duration). Novel chains may be detected through low frequency, sporadic pulses characterized by such frequencies and durations.

a thalamobot 125 may take an active role in chain formation, such as by breaking chains, reinforcing chains, etc. Additionally, as shown in FIG. 5 , a thalamobot 125 (with spatial and temporal filters not shown) may be used to suggest and influence chain formation as well. A thalamobot 125 may detect the activation of any first neural module 115 A and use an onboard neural system, in the form of an associative memory, to determine which of the remaining modules 115 first module 115 A should link to, repeating this process for subsequent states of the growing chain.

This process can sidestep some or all of the need for general and inefficient broadcasts to all neural modules 115 , since the neural system residing within the thalamobot 125 can, at any stage of chain growth, prioritize the order of broadcasts of the last pattern output by the chain 410 to the most likely recipient modules, as is depicted in FIG. 5 .

the thalamobot 125 may be a neural network based associative memory that has cumulatively learned past neural chains 410 forming in the collective as the entire ensemble of modules 115 is suffused with noise. Therefore, given a partial associative chain or supernet, the thalamobot 125 may suggest one or more alternative ways of completing the chain 410 based upon the stochastic excitation of input nodes of said associative memory to supply the missing elements of the sequence of chaining modules. As a non-limiting example, in FIG.

the thalamobot 125 may have previously learned that nodes 115 I and 115 J are likely candidates for completing the chain 410 . Once those candidate modules 115 I, 115 J have been determined, they may be conveyed to the neural collective in the imagitron 110 to determine the order of broadcast of the last pattern in the chain 410 to the neural modules 115 identified by the thalamobot 125 . It is noted that all stages of associative chain formation may be governed in this way, starting with the activation of a first seed module by noise. The thalamobot's associative memory could be continuously training upon chains 410 as they are forming so that they may later supply the identities of candidate modules to complete any chain that is forming.

the Thalamobot Looking to the mammalian brain, its underlying reptilian brain, in particular the thalamus, is able to locate and focus upon notions as they form.

research indicates that the foremost affordances that may be used to identify novel pattern formation are (1) auto-associative novelty filters that may isolate patterns having threshold novelty value, and (2) the rhythm with which such patterns are forming. It is strongly suspected that thalamus functions in this way, constantly taking in a digest of cortical activity, sensing anomalies, and focusing in on areas producing slow, hypnotic, and tentative output, the signature of original ideas forming (Thaler, 2014).

FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of one example of a simple thalamobot 625 , which is in communication with a sensor 130 monitoring an imagitron 110 (both as discussed above).

a raw image and/or acoustic map for example, is fed into an anomaly filter 650 of thalamobot 625 .

An anomaly filter 650 may be an auto-associative neural net that habituates to repeating activation patterns from the imagitron 110 , or may be an alternative algorithm (e.g., frame subtraction).

Anomaly filter 650 highlights fresh activation chains 410 , and passes anomalous patterns to one or both of a penalty detector 655 and a reward detector 660 .

a penalty detector 655 may be a neural net that maps raw chaining patterns with patterns representing associated past costs or penalties. As can be seen, penalty detector 655 may cause adjustment of noise levels within imagitron 110 resulting either in stimulation of novel chains 410 by raising noise levels, or the breaking of unwanted chains 410 .

a reward detector 660 may also be a neural net that that maps raw chaining patterns with patterns representing associated rewards or benefits. As can be seen, penalty detector 655 may lower noise levels within the imagitron 110 , as individual modules continue training and linking within a more quiescent environment allowing the strengthening of meritorious chains 410 therein. Meritorious (or âusefulâ) chains may be newly forming ideas, rehashing of recently formed memories/chains that demonstrate a factual association.

FIG. 7 illustrates a block diagram of another example of a thalamobot 725 âin this case a foveating thalamobot 725 âwhich is in communication with a sensor 130 monitoring an imagitron 110 (both as discussed above).

sensor 130 acquires data by monitoring imagitron 110 , and transmits a raw image or acoustic map, e.g., to thalamobot 725 .

the sensor 130 may have a sensor attention window which chaotically or systematically focuses upon different regions of the output device 120 .

a wandering attention window may be implemented, even with a fixed camera/input device.

thalamobot 725 includes a rhythm filter 750 which monitors frequency and fractal dimension of the pattern stream of imagitron 110 .

Rhythm filter 750 may instead calculate statistical temporal distribution of pattern formation in the imagitron 110 .

Rhythm filter 750 may cause sensor 130 to focus on a given area of output device 120 upon detection of novel chaining. Patterns may then be passed from rhythm filter 750 to one or both of a penalty detector 755 and a reward detector 760 , as discussed above.

a thalamobot 125 may also include other modules, such as:

Novelty filter may be implemented as an auto-associative neural net that has absorbed memories of past activation patterns within the imagitron 110 and is able to detect false or novel memory generation therein.

General ANN Mappings may capture any mapping relationship between activity presented by output device 120 and other pattern-based metrics.

a mapping system may detect states of neural modules 115 within the imagitron 110 (as monitored by the input device 130 ), and may map such states to a predetermined output pattern.

Timers may track the number of cycles of perturbation of the imagitron 110 , and may increase perturbation level in proportion to elapsed time to emulate frustration.

Noise Injectors simulate global or more localized neurotransmitter release within the imagitron.

a perturbed net may generate successive positions to place an attention window within the output device 120 until a critic net detects spatial or temporal anomalies within the window. Thalamobot 125 attention may then gravitate toward such anomalies, as noted above.

Flatteners may be implemented as an auto-associative net that flattens 2-D or 3-D representations of activation chains 410 into 1-D patterns. These nets may be used as associative memories to coax the completion of chains 410 within imagitron 110 .

Buffers may be used to track the time evolution and hence chronology of activation chains 410 output via output device 120 . Such 1-D patterns may then be applied to the penalty/reward detectors 655 / 755 , 660 / 760 , to which ordering of events may be meaningful.

buffers allow the classification of chains and supernets 410 of neural modules.

the activation of hidden layers serves as the classification of any pattern applied as an input to the net, typically without regard to the order with which such neurons activate therein.

chains and networks of neural nets (rather than individual neurons) serve as the classification that in turn is sensitive to the order with which these modules are incorporated into a given chain.

the thalamobot 125 classifies 2-D (e.g., flat panel display) and 3-D (e.g., virtual reality depiction of imagitron 110 ) shapes formed by the chaining neural modules.

Audio Frequency Detectors if the output device 120 is frequency/duration coded to coordinates in the output device 120 , a neural net may be used to convert such audio signals to such coordinates and direct the attention window of thalamobot 125 to the appropriate region of the output device 120 or a particular output device 120 among a plurality thereof.

Three general but non-limiting modes of operation are presented, characterized by the level of noise injected into the imagitron 110 .

data patterns are fed from the environment, E, into imagitron 110 without noise or learning.

Passive discovery occurs as the thalamobot detects anomalous chains forming as a result of such applied environmental patterns.

a new data pattern may be introduced from the environment into the imagitron 110 in the presence of a relatively low level of noise.

the system would thereby generate alternative interpretations of the environmental input, which could be coaxed via perturbation introduced by the thalamobot 125 into a consistent interpretation and then frozen in as a memory through triggered learning.

Contextual discovery, disambiguation, and sense-making occurs.

the system could be allowed to freely âdreamâ as a result of higher levels of noise injected by the thalamobot 125 to find new associations of value or utility. This is so called âeyes shutâ discovery and invention which is typically inattentive to environmental input patterns.

a thalamobot 125 which is capable of globally monitoring the neural activation state to of the entire imagitron 110 assembly of neural modules 115 in visual (or other) format is a particularly attractive way of avoiding this bottleneck.

10,000 auto-associative, multilayer neural network modules 115 were generated that formed memories of randomly generated byte patterns. When an input byte was applied to all such group membership filters in this array, their resonances with the input pattern were measurable by a reconstruction error ( â that could in turn be displayed as gray scale values between 0 and 255, equating to a â between 0 and 1, on the monitor.

the auto-associative filter array acts as a compound classification layer within a multi-layer perceptron, with each 8/4/8 auto-associative network therein activating with a â error somewhere in the range of 0 to 1.

the input device 130 in this case, a camera

thalamobot 125 then read such activations and used its portion of the composite multi-layer perceptron to map to an output pattern.

This architecture may be run adaptively so as to learn an overall input-output mapping.

the thalamobot 125 allows the individual modules 115 to form deeper memories of the patterns that they resonate with.

the thalamobot 125 may also adapt so as to improve the mapping between group membership activation errors ( â s) and the desired output patterns.

the thalamobot 125 may also be able to recover latent ideas that form within the imagitron 110 as associative chains and networks 410 of networks 115 that form therewithin.

Noise e.g., synaptic perturbation

an association chain 410 develops incorporating certain modules 115 but not others, via the aforesaid chaining mechanism.

These chains 410 may strengthen their association on their own, i.e., forming a latent idea.

an adaptive anomaly filter in the thalamobot 125 that has been cumulatively observing the swarm of adaptive artificial neural network modules 115 may have developed a normalcy model of how such modules routinely connect.

This filter may be implemented integrally within the thalamobot 125 or as a sensor-based scanning system that monitors the activation patterns and/or connectivity of the swarm of modules 115 .

New associative chains 410 will be identified by this filter, essentially ignoring the more persistent activation states of those neural modules 115 unrelated to the novel associative chain 410 .

Critics that may be resident within the thalamobot 125 or scanning activation displays may be used to strengthen the connections within the associative chain 410 by (a) signaling the swarm to adaptively reinforce such links, or (b) train a proxy network to learn the connectivity within the connectionist swarm.

the critic within the thalamobot 125 may take the form of specialized neural modules 815 , shown in FIG. 8 , that are capable of sensing penalty or reward for the system 100 as a whole, and raising or lowering the level of perturbation throughout the system.

FIG. 8 the critic within the thalamobot 125 may take the form of specialized neural modules 815 , shown in FIG. 8 , that are capable of sensing penalty or reward for the system 100 as a whole, and raising or lowering the level of perturbation throughout the system.

specialized neural module 815 which may be triggered by a forming chain 410 , is shown within the imagitron 110 , but it is noted that this specialized neural module 815 may instead be located within the thalamobot 125 .

an ideational chain or network 410 of modules 115 may link up (e.g., U1 â U2 â U3 â U4), to form some concept that a perceptual or affective chain (e.g., O1 â O2 â O3 â O4 â O5 â O6), may link to so as to render an opinion about the U1-U4 concept.

Module O6 in this example integral to a strong positive association may trigger the thalamobot 125 to inject simulated reward-related neurotransmitters into the imagitron 110 via specialized neural module 815 so as to strengthen the entire chain 410 .

O6 may trigger simulated stress-related neurotransmitter release by the thalamobot 125 to strengthen or weaken the chain 410 , or to induce the formation of alternative chains 410 .

critic modules may be located within the imagitron 110 or thalamobot 125 , and may serve as triggers for simulated neurotransmitter release.

merit is generally judged by some metric that could for instance be the single numerical output of a simple hetero-associative net registering its satisfaction with any applied input pattern on a 0-10 point scale.

the utility or appeal of a network's input pattern might be the Euclidean distance of the net's output patterns from some desired target pattern.

suitability of any input pattern becomes a scalar quantity that may be used to modulate various forms of influence within an imagitron 110 through the equivalent of stress-induced adrenergic neurotransmitter release or dopaminergic reward neurotransmitters preparative to learning.

the thalamobot 125 may therefore includeâfor lack of a better nameâan associative gestalt detector (or ârecognition systemâ). Such a recognition system does not necessarily compute a numerical measure of novelty, utility or appeal, but is instead on the lookout for sub-pattern geometries or topologies within the imagitron (or even in the thalamobot) formed as chains of neural modules 115 .

the thalamobot 125 may identify such shapes at specific locations within the collective (e.g., a circular chain centered at position x, y and radius r) as they form in reaction to some core ideational chain 410 which itself may also be viewed as a location, shape, or topology.

Certain modules 115 within these reactive associative gestalt chains may serve as hot buttons that may trigger simulated neurotransmitter release either directly or through the thalamobot intermediary. If the core ideational chain 410 activates a subsequent associative gestalt chain whose location and/or topology encodes failure, the thalamobot 125 may inject noise into the imagitron 110 to spoil the ideation, as shown in FIG. 8 . If the associative gestalt chain spawned by the core ideational chain 410 contains modules that singularly or collectively encode success, then the thalamobot 125 may trigger a hippocampal-like function of increasing learning rate and momentum in the imagitron 110 in proportion to the promise offered by said core idea.

This recognition system may be based upon a logical system that triggers with activation of any said hot button modules, or a neural system serving as a shape or topology detector searching among the chaining neural modules 115 .

this system is not purposely introduced or engineered.

this system is not purposely introduced or engineered.

the initial ideational chain it âcarvesâ itself out of the matrix of neural modules.

certain modules that activate within an associative gestalt may be bound congenitally or through cumulative or episodic learning to neural modules specialized in volume or global release of neurotransmitters.

volume neurotransmitter release is triggered by the recognition of such reactive chains or the by the activation of such a hot button module incorporated by said gestalt chain.

gestalt is meant to convey the notion that the associative chain 410 forming in reaction to any seed ideational chain conveys more than the information conveyed by any hot button modules 115 therein (e.g., the idea triggering the associative gestalt solves the problem, but it reminds the system also of notions x, y, and z, and the system lacks the ability to concentrate on all of these associated ideas simultaneously).

the injection of noise would take the form of stress neurotransmitters such as adrenaline and noradrenaline, released by specialized neurons, and reward neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, should promising associative chains be formed.

the utility of this mechanism is that as the thalamobot 125 watches the display of activations/reconstruction errors of the imagitron 110 , it may sense the activation of a negative associative gestalt within the imagitron 110 , which may signal the thalamobot to elevate perturbation levels within the imagitron 110 to create more âtwistedâ notions, if need be, to solve a problem, when those already memorized fail to meet the demand.

associative chains 410 may be spoiled from forming by alert associative gestalts/chains 815 through elevation of synaptic noise into the W regime of FIG. 2 .

chains 410 linking to a positive associative gestalt/chain may trigger the equivalent of potentiating neurotransmitters to strengthen such compound notions.

camera frames constituting the video stream may be divided into 8 â 8 pixel (24 â 24 byte) squares, each monitored by its own auto-associative net within the thalamobot 125 .

the camera frames may each come from a separate camera 130 , or multiple camera frames split off from the output of a camera 130 .

a thalamobot 125 may also operate by entering into a so-called âfoveationalâ mode wherein one stochastically perturbed network generates a succession of positions to place an attention window on the display 120 depicting the chaining, as another net monitors for spatial or temporal anomalies within said attention window focusing upon some region within that display 120 . Once such anomalies are located, the latter may attenuate perturbation level within the stochastic net, the result being that the attention window gravitates toward any spatially or temporally anomalous chain of activating neural modules.

the critic in the thalamobot 125 may introduce randomization of links so as to weaken such associative chains 410 should the associations (the latent idea) be deemed not useful, unappealing, or insignificant.

An advantage of using a sensory output/input pair is the avoidance of combinational explosion in assessing the topology of network modules through a probing algorithm that is tracking through all connections in an imagitron 110 .

Another advantage is the asynchronous scrutiny of chaining neural modules, and the anomaly-rhythm filtering to prioritize freshly emerging associative chains on the basis of novelty.

a swarm of 10,000 group membership filter modules 115 may be allowed to absorb memories of 10,000 random melodies of one measure, four notes, each.

one of these modules 115 When one of these modules 115 is synaptically perturbed (or externally excited) it generates a 4-note theme that is then applied to all group membership filters 115 in the swarm.

the group membership filter 115 containing the closest memory of this theme then produces a variation on this theme in the next bar or measure.

these notes continue to chain, they frequently loop back to the initial theme to form a closed loop, forming the basis of a novel melody.

These chains 410 and loops would then be isolated so that their activations may be passed to a critic within a thalamobot 125 .

the group membership filter swarm consists of 10,000 adaptive neural modules 115 continually chaining with their reconstruction errors or activation patterns, which may be portrayed on a monitor 120 .

a camera 130 viewing the monitor 120 relays the image to an adaptive, auto-associative neural network functioning as an anomaly filter in thalamobot 125 .

the thalamobot may operate on another computer or processor, and may constantly adapt to the neural swarm's activations/reconstruction errors. Only the latest activation changes may be revealed by this adaptive anomaly detector. Thusly extracted, these activation chains 410 and loops may be passed to various critics in the thalamobot 125 .

An adaptive filter may be used to isolate freshly forming associative chains.

the temporal sequence of activations of group membership filters and general network modules is displayed. Allowed to fill a buffer or stack in this viewing order, the sequence may be passed to the critic.

One or more of these critics may be a prosody detector, or a system for determining fractal dimension or other temporal measures.

a related aspect is the task of identifying novel associative chains 410 on the basis of prosody. Identification of novel associative chains 410 is achieved for the above musical example through the use of a prosody detector sensing the activation rhythm and/or fractal dimension of these chains 410 as they match that of their initiating/driving neural module(s) 115 .

sub-networks within a constituent system may be subliminally knit into a coherent, associative whole. For example, intact memory chains may be created.

This modality is particularly useful in intelligence applications in which important relationships are established between tokenized neural representations of real world entities. In fact, anywhere one sees graph analyses and semantic networks, this technique offers many advantages.

multiple nets vie to capture and learn environmental input patterns. Thereafter, these nets may link either autonomously or through human guidance. Subsequent perturbation of the connections joining such nets may result in juxtapositional invention or inductive/deductive discovery chains.

novelty chains may be formed. More specifically, juxtapositional associative modules are produced that incorporate elements, or combinations thereof, that have not been directly experienced by the system of sub-networks. Such are subjected to increasing levels of internal noise to soften network constraints and produce environmental-like features that differ from the training exemplars of the nets. The perturbations to the nets may be further increased to produce myriad unconstrained notions that generally fall outside of the knowledge domain of the nets.

the basic process of perturbation of associative chains as utilized in the preceding two modalities is described in the 1996 Thaler article referenced in the preceding paragraph and âThe Creativity Machineâ Paradigmâ, Thaler, S. L. [2013], Encyclopedia of Creativity, Invention, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, which is also incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

the networks may alternatively be of hetero-associative design initially and subsequently interacting and chaining as referenced in the above discussion of the formation of intact memory chains.

auto-associate sub-networks for example, auto-associative nets, may be converted to hetero-associative mappings through learning.

One embodiment involves taking the output pattern from a given neural module, resulting from noise and/or input patterns to it, finding an auto-associative net within the swarm containing the nearest memory to that of the first net's output pattern, via reconstruction error ( â ) and then training the target net so as to make it map from the impressed to a subsequent pattern, the latter introduced either from the environment or from other neural modules.

Any pattern introduced to the compound imagitron 110 from the environment, or from other networks internal to this imagitron 110 is allowed to propagate in parallel or serially through all or a portion of the ensemble of neural modules.

the auto-associative group membership filter having the lowest, or some nominal reconstruction error, is the one within the ensemble holding a memory close to that of the applied input pattern.

any new input pattern from the environment or from the ensemble of neural modules 115 is applied to the output of this targeted group membership filter as it is subjected to training cycles, making it a hetero-associative bridge between the input and output patterns it has trained upon. This process may be repeated to build up extensive associative chains from the original ensemble of auto-associative networks.

compatibility chains 410 for example, linking of similar or complementary memories into useful coalitions may be isolated with adaptation taking place within the nets comprising such chains so as to adapt the memories therein into closer compliance with one another.

a random or constant seed pattern is applied to a group membership filter module within the assembly whose output pattern is applied in turn to a multitude of other modules within the ensemble until another group membership filter is found containing a similar memory. Allowing patterns to circulate through these chains as the underlying group membership filter's train, the connections between modules effectively strengthen since tapped/recruited modules become more selective for the common memory (i.e., reconstruction error falls for the circulating pattern) and are more easily recruited when the governing algorithm searches once again for a compatible group membership filter.

Auto-associative modules can be addressed as compound neurons.

the reconstruction error of an auto-associative module is used analogously to the activation of an individual computational neuron in adaptive learning schemes.

the weights feeding the inputs of the auto-associative module are updated in proportion to the reconstruction error â (or its complement 1 â ), the differential such as d(1 â /dnet, and the current x (e.g., the â or 1 â from the previous GMF) being transmitted through them.

the auto-associative module's internal weights may be adjusted in proportion to some function of the reconstruction error.

This chain 410 will activate subsequently with the presentation of one or more of such entities or activities or spontaneously from noise internal to the imagitron 110 .

Such chaining may be achieved by starting with a collection of auto-associative nets. As subsequent nets resonate with environmental patterns they have formed memories of, they recruit a subsequent module's memories as their training output targets. In this way, the net effectively becomes a bridge mapping between one entity/activity and the next.

the next series of modalities address the detection and/or differentiation of associative chains 410 formed through one or more of the modalities described above.

audio-visual cues and prompts are used to attract attention of a thalamobot 125 .

any visual or auditory clues could be used to attract the attention of the thalamobot 125 .

the average color (encoding the mean activation of all its neurons) of any neural module within display offers an affordance.

different acoustic frequencies are used to differentiate which activation display is requesting attention of the thalamobot 125 .

the degree of novelty represented by the activation may be indicated through the intensity level of the audio-visual cues, for example, more tentative flashes or auditory report may signal the arrival of a novel thought taking the form of a novel associative chain.

the thalamobot 125 arrangement similarly allows for the use of prosody or rhythm filters to detect a succession of novel associative chains 410 .

Noteworthy associative chains are detected by processing of raw activation of the compound imagitron 110 and/or anomaly filtering as described in the immediately preceding paragraph.

the imagitron 110 and thalamic 125 subsystems may be implemented on separate hosts via a network connection.

the described systems advantageously also allow for the management of associative chains 410 through noise injection and reinforcement learning.

the system may trigger higher levels of synaptic and/or neural noise within the system of sub-networks in order to trigger generation of novel ideational chains 410 .

the system may trigger even higher synaptic noise levels within the sub-networks in the event that the generated associative chains 410 are undesirable. The higher synaptic noise levels spoil the formation of the anticipated chain 410 .

the system may trigger reinforcement learning to strengthen the links between the component neural modules of said chains.

An important capacity of the system is the emulation of the process of subconscious incubation of ideas that occurs in the brain.

the entire system both the compound imagitron 110 and the thalamobot 125 , may undergo cycles of excitation and relaxation.

the entire system is immersed in noise as latent ideational chains form in sub-networks of the compound imagitron 110 .

the noise level is then lowered, thereby allowing the compound imagitron 110 to visit newly formed memories as the now more lucid thalamobot 125 or other chains within the imagitron 110 identify those associative chains 410 having utility and/or value.

a key limitation of the basic model of human thought is that it involves a bottleneck in that all cortical activity must pass through the single monitoring/thalamic system.

the system described herein is capable of overcoming this limitation through the use of multiple thalamobots 125 , as shown in FIG. 9 .

Multiple thalamobots 125 may monitor a single audio/visual output 120 , or multiple audio/visual outputs 120 may be used with the multiple thalamobots 125 monitoring those multiple outputs 120 .

the responses of each of the individual thalamobots 125 are integrated into a single perceptual pattern with a downstream network.

Embodiments of the system may also be integrated to learn complex input-output mapping.

sub-networks of the compound imagitron 110 are used to form the equivalent of a hidden layer within a conventional, multi-layer perceptron.

the thalamobot 125 forms the equivalent of the output layer(s) of the multi-layer perceptron and has the ability to trigger learning or noise within the cortical sub-networks.

the connections within the compound imagitron 110 and thalamobot 125 are iteratively corrected to achieve a more accurate mapping.

Neural modules 115 in the compound imagitron 110 bathed in various forms of noise, are continuously chaining to produce the equivalent of a stream of consciousness while a monitoring thalamobot 125 governs the simulated injection of stress and potentiating neurotransmitters through the adjustment of noise and learning parameters to the neural modules 115 of the imagitron 110 . Ideations seeded by any combination of environmental inputs and/or noise will trigger subsequent associative chains 410 representing a progression of related past experience that will likely incorporate neural modules 115 encoding existential significance (e.g., threats or fulfillment).

the thalamobot 125 may trigger reinforcement of such ideational chains 410 or erase or modify them through the introduction of perturbations.

components of the system will invent significance, valid or not, to the activations of its neural collective as it would normally attach significance to environmental patterns.

the system may also be adapted such that the thalamobot 125 is used to combine multiple neural audio/visual outputs 120 into a projective distillation of thoughts forming therein. Additionally, one or more thalamobots 125 may be used to observe any environment (e.g., a monitor displaying a functional brain scan) to detect the rhythm with which anomalous chaining is occurring among the features of said environment.

any environment e.g., a monitor displaying a functional brain scan

Novel methods of computing may also be employed, in which an imagitron 110 is built upon a multi-core architecture, distributing its GMF modules into separate processors. If the GMF/module aboard a processor outputs a pattern, only a select few processors will respond to that pattern to initiate a linking process. The most resonant processor will be the next to join the chain. With an associative memory in the thalamobot 125 suggesting the next member(s) of the processor chain, this chaining of processors may be further improved.

a GMF may be incorporated into the registers, stack, or heap space (i.e., RAM or cache) associated with any given processor to govern how it will cooperate with other such GMF-equipped processors in generating associative chains within imagitrons 110 or thalamobots 125 in a system.

a broadcast of a pattern to one or more processors takes place, with reconstruction error being calculated on each said processor. That processor-based GMF with the lowest reconstruction error then triggers other functions on the thusly selected processor, such as adaptive training so as to convert the resonant associative network to a hetero-associative one or to deepen a memory therein.

a collection of GMFs may respond to a pattern broadcast, with the GMF most resonant with said pattern triggering functionalities of the one or more processors associated with it.

GMF modules may be assigned to separate processors ( 0 , 1 , 2 , . . . N). If the GMF operative within each processor resonates through low reconstruction error with the input pattern, P, reinforcement learning of said pattern by the same resonant GMF then occurs or other such functionality may be triggered within the same processor. In some cases, several GMFs may be delegated to a single processor, with each responsible for triggering other functionality of said processor.

Description

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/924,624, and incorporates the entirety of the disclosure therein by reference.

TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates generally to the fields of both artificial intelligence and machine consciousness and, more particularly, to a method and device for the unification and origination of knowledge within connectionist systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The thalamus has been described as the âeyeballâ or âprojection screenâ of the brain, monitoring the continuously evolving cortical activity that may be thought of as the brain's âmultimedia show,â while also serving as a trigger for global or âvolumeâ release of neurotransmitters into the cortex. When attempts are made to build artificial neural systems approaching the size and complexity of the human cortex, memory and processors are so heavily taxed that any monitoring algorithm needs to run either intermittently as a separate thread or process on the same computational platform. Furthermore, as these synthetic cortical systems become more extensive and complex it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate the formation of associative chains that reveal important relationships or the emergence of novel patterns tantamount to ideas and improvisational strategies. Should the monitoring thalamic portion be run on a separate platform, communication is limited by serial protocols (e.g., TCP/IP over Ethernet) that must transmit billions of bytes of information to broadcast just one of myriad states of the cortical algorithm. In the first case of intermittent execution of the monitoring algorithm, valuable activation patterns may be missed within the cortical algorithm. In the second case of threads executing the thalamic algorithm in parallel with the cortical, the states of the synthetic cortex must be passed via immense data structures, resulting in significant delays in the evaluation of cortical activation patterns. The same may be said of transmission protocols between separate machines.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5,659,666, simulated volume release of neurotransmitters was controlled through at least one critic or neural net that was capable of graduating mean synaptic perturbation level to create more âtwistedâ pattern-based notions until it was âsatisfiedâ with one or more of them. Later, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,454,388, those false memories deemed valuable or useful by this critic were reinforced in a process that simulates serotonin and dopamine release preparatory to the brain's memorization of useful confabulations. That system thus bootstraps itself through cycles of idea generation followed by memorization of such notions, along the way hybridizing ideas into more useful or interesting concepts. However, such systems were restricted in part by typical processing bottlenecks.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

In a system in which a synthetic cortex is composed of a multitude of neural modules, and in which the generation of potentially useful confabulation states therein are governed through the global release of simulated neurotransmitters, a mechanism is provided for herein which locates unusual or useful neural activation patterns and chains arising within the entire neural assembly that could qualify as potential ideas or action plans. A confabulation may be thought of as a false memory activating within either a biological or synthetic neural net, which may or may not prove useful or informative to a critic agency, the latter being either protoplasmic or artificial. Typically, neurotransmitter release is thought of as localized, as in the transmission of packets of molecules across the synaptic cleft between neurons, tantamount to the current in an artificial neural network between two computational processing units. Volume or global neurotransmitter release is not specific to any synapse and is the result of biological neurons specialized in suffusing many synapses simultaneously within the brain's neural networks with neurotransmitters. Herein, such global neurotransmitter release is simulated though various forms of perturbations and disturbances to connection weights and/or computational neurons.

Methodologies are discussed herein for implementing both spatial and temporal anomaly detection to locate and identify freshly forming candidate notions from extensive ensembles of neural nets, prior to their passage to critic systems for evaluation. With the ability to promote the formation of the chains of neural modules, disparate information is being combined so as to unify memories, both true and false, into more complex concepts and strategies.

This patent teaches various methods for the unification and origination of knowledge as well as both exteroceptive and interoceptive awareness within artificial neural systems consisting of a plurality of artificial neural modules. The unification process occurs at several levels:

1. Continuous connection/disconnection of neural modules to produce ideational chains and networks among neural modules.

2. Bridging of those chains and networks under the scrutiny of the computational equivalent of a reptilian brain and limbic system (e.g., thalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus) that triggers the formation of more original chains or the reinforcement of those deemed useful. Such chains are the basis of ideas.

3. Classification of the state of the entire collective of neural modules, treating their joint activations and network chains as if they were objects (e.g., 2- or 3-dimensional geometric forms) in the natural environment, detected via machine vision or acoustic processing algorithms, thereby departing from the traditional paradigm of critic functions that produce numerical figures of merit for ideational neural activation patterns, in that locations, topologies, and shapes of chaining patterns serve as a qualitative evaluation of any forming concept or action plan.

4. More effective monitoring/unification via the equivalent of multiple reptilian brains monitoring and controlling such ideational chaining (i.e., a multitrack synthetic mind).

5. The reciprocal bridging of reptilian component back to the collective of neural modules via axonal feedback connections as well as simulated chemical connectionism (e.g., synaptic and neuronal noise through stress neurotransmitters as well as potentiating neurotransmitters to trigger learning/strengthening of newly formed associative chains deemed meritorious by the system).

6. The integration of multiple cortical simulations into one through at least one final network layer.

7. The invention of significance to the totality, or any part thereof, of neural activations and chaining topologies within such a system through the formation of reactive neural activations and chaining topologies that constitute a subjective or emotional response thereto, regardless of their veracity (i.e., consciousness) and the use of such subjective response to strengthen or weaken the system's self-reflective notions as they form.

In embodiments of the described device and method, the cortical and thalamic functions may be divided between at least two separate computational platforms or subsystems. In one subsystem, cortical function is generated, driven by both external events and/or internal noise so as to produce a succession of activation chains tantamount to ideas. The thalamic system, the second subsystem, may be implemented on a separate processor, platform, or thread using a sensor to monitor a display (e.g., visual, auditory) of neuronal activations within the cortical simulation. The thalamic algorithm may asynchronously scan this cortical display to glean the succession of cortical states, typically at much higher rates than could be attained via multithreading or serial communications. The incorporation of filters, in the form of adaptive anomaly and/or rhythm detectors isolate newly emerging concepts in the form of chaining or networking neural modules. Subsequent stages within the cortical or thalamic system consist of one or more neural modules that map the patterns or topologies collectively represented within such chains to metrics of utility, value, or novelty. These subsequent stages may themselves take the form of chains of neural modules, the location, shape, and/or topology of which represents some figure of novelty, utility, or value. Topology refers to the connectivity between neural modules determined either through connection weight pathways or the learned order of pattern broadcasts among them.

The same thalamic system may have the ability to modulate global noise levels within the cortical subsystem via serial or parallel communications or reciprocal sensor schemes, allowing it to raise perturbation levels should satisfactory solution patterns not be initially found. Having found a valuable associative chain or network, tantamount to a concept or action plan, the thalamic system has the ability to cease perturbations and harvest the notion or trigger other algorithms to implement the idea or strategy. The same thalamic algorithm also has the ability to trigger adaptive learning in the case that a potentially useful ideational chaining topology forms, thus strengthening the connectivity of that topology as a latent memory that may later be called upon under similar environmental circumstances, be activated through stochastic/perturbative processes, or to be used as a component of more complex notions, through the fusion of it with other such memories.

Such a system may serve as a laboratory to observe the emergence of consciousness from component neurons and neural modules, using various affordances to monitor for the evolution of self-reflection and interpretation (i.e., the invention of significance to itself). Used in this way, the displays of cortical activations, along with thalamobot detection/feedback, will become an important research tool for identifying the neural correlates of cognition, creativity, and consciousness.

The current system relates to an enhanced manner of operation of Creativity Machines, imagitron-perceptron coalitions between which inventive dialogs occur, such as are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,659,666 and 7,454,388, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Inherent to such neural architectures is a bottleneck between the imagitron and perceptron components that becomes more pronounced as the generative network, tantamount to the brain's cortex, is increased in size or if it becomes compound in nature, encompassing myriad sub-networks.

The system may involve the use of an output device, such as a computer monitor (e.g. CRT flat panel LED, LCD, etc.) or other visual media (e.g., LCD, LED, projectors) or other sensory output devices, to present the neural activation patterns of an imagitron or other connectionist architecture that can in turn be sensed or scanned by an input device in communication with filtering and evaluation systems (e.g., perceptrons). In one embodiment, the output is via a visual output that can in turn be scanned for valuable or novel activation patterns via a camera or other such sensors. In another embodiment, a linear or raster scan is utilized to observe the succession of patterns. In a preferred embodiment, a foveational scheme, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,545,388, wherein a camera is operated with a wandering attention window or where a camera is able to pan, tilt, and zoom so as to locate interesting and newly emergent patterns having utility or value, is utilized to monitor a visual output. This same foveational scheme may take the form of a fixed camera whose video stream may be searched by a wandering attention window. In other embodiments, change detection techniques via group membership filters, see U.S. Pat. No. 7,545,388, are used to filter for the evaluation of newly emerging patterns from the imagitrons.

In the brain this âfoveationalâ process corresponds to the population polling of a collection of neurons whose activation center of gravity dictates where the eyeball looks. Alternately, this cognitive process corresponds to the movement of an internal attention window over visual cortex to focus on certain pieces of the brain's working image of the external environment. Herein this process is achieved using internally perturbed neural nets to chaotically move an attention window around an environment until it clips or captures an item or activity of interest to a critic algorithm or neural net that then reduces the noise within the former net so that the attention window becomes trapped on the item of interest. Also, herein, the environment is not the external environment, but a model of an environment that may be attained via a system of chaining neural modules.

The system operates similarly to the interaction between the cortex and thalamus in the human brain, with the monitoring sensor and thalamobot, tantamount to the reptilian brain, shifting its attention to newly emerging neural activation patterns appearing within the visual display. If multiple visual outputs are used, the system can serve in the detection of important spatial-temporal connections/correlations between emergent patterns in the various displays thus unifying them into more complex associations, achieving complex graph analysis without a super-computer.

In addition, a methodology is taught for isolating such notions and relationships utilizing recent research findings that indicate a relationship between the novelty and rhythm of idea generation within connectionist architectures as described in the paper âSynaptic Perturbation and Consciousnessâ, Thaler, S. L., published in International Journal of Machine Consciousness, December 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Considering the stream of complex activation patterns forming within such computational systems as ideas nucleating within cortex, various external agencies are recruited to emulate the function of the reptilian brain, on the lookout for activation patterns among cortical modules that are anomalous spatially or temporally. Aside from purely algorithmic routines that scan such neural ensembles for valuable notions, a technique is taught herein for using sensor based technology such as cameras to scan two or three dimensional displays of global neural activation so to either (1) focus in on novel pattern formation within the connectionist array, or (2) eliminate all but the factual associations forming as in an advanced data mining applications, or (3) integrate the activations of multiple neural modules so as to achieve highly complex mappings. The systems described herein may be implemented with neural network simulations or hardware-implemented neural networks such as GPUs, FPGAs, specialty ASIC chips, as well as non-silicon-based computational systems.

In one example embodiment, a system for monitoring an environment comprises: an input device for monitoring and capturing pattern-based states of a model of the environment; a thalamobot embodied in at least a first processor, in which the first processor is in communication with the input device. The thalamobot includes at least one filter for monitoring captured data from the input device and for identifying at least one state change (e.g., newly arising data) within the captured data. The system also includes at least one critic. The at least one filter forwards the at least one state change to the critic, and the critic judges the merit of the at least one state change.

The filter may include an anomaly filter and/or a rhythm detector. The input device may be a camera which transmits pattern-based states as captured images to the thalamobot. The input device may be a microphone which transmits pattern-based states as captured sound to the thalamobot. The critic may include a plurality of neural modules, which may chain together in patterns which serve as a figure of merit for the at least one state change. The thalamobot may be embodied on the at least one processor in a computer system which is separate from a computer system on which the model of the environment is generated. The pattern-based states of the model of the environment may be generated by an output device which outputs the pattern-based states in the form of reconstruction errors of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron, or in the form of a topology of chains forming in an imagitron, or in the form of activation histories of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron, or in the form of topological chain formation histories of a plurality of neural modules in an imagitron. The model of the environment may be a brain scan. The thalamobot may be in communication with the computer system on which the model of the environment is generated to modify a level of noise injected into the model, in which raising the level of noise to the model generates new ideas within the model. Alternatively or in addition, the thalamobot may be in communication with the computer system on which the model of the environment is generated to promote learning within the model. The neural modules may be embodied on an array of processors, or on a single processor.

In another example embodiment, a system comprises: an imagitron embodied on at least a first processor, in which the imagitron includes a first plurality of neural modules and is capable of accepting environmental inputs; an output device in communication with the imagitron for outputting a state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules; an input device for monitoring the state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules output via the output device; a thalamobot embodied on at least a second processor separate from the at least one first processor, in which the second processor is in electronic communication with the input device and includes at least one filter for monitoring captured data from said input device and for identifying at least one state change data within the captured data; and at least one critic. The at least one filter forwards the at least one state change to said at least one critic, which judges merit of the at least one state change.

The output device may be a display screen which displays the data in the form of respective reconstruction errors of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules, or in the form of activations of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules. The output device may also be a speaker. The filter may be an anomaly filter or a rhythm filter. The input device may be a camera which captures and transmits data output from the output device in the form of respective reconstruction errors of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules, or in the form of activations of at least some of the first plurality of neural modules. The input device may be a microphone which transmits output data as captured audio to the thalamobot. The critic may include a second plurality of neural modules, and the filter may include a third plurality of neural modules. Respective clusters of one or more neural modules of the third plurality of neural modules may be assigned to monitor pre-assigned portions of the output data. The thalamobot may be embodied on a processor in a computer system which is separate from the environment from which output data is captured by the input device.

The thalamobot may be in electronic communication with the imagitron for controlling a noise level within the first plurality of neural nodes. The thalamobot may cause an increase in the noise level within the first plurality of neural nodes in response to a lack of meritorious chaining data as determined by the at least one critic. The thalamobot may be in electronic communication with the imagitron for controlling chain cancellation and chain reinforcement within the imagitron. The input device may foveationally monitor the data output from the output device. The thalamobot may include a plurality of thalamobots, each analyzing respective portions of the output data captured by said input device. The input device may include a plurality of input devices. The thalamobot may include a plurality of thalamobots, each analyzing respective portions of the output data captured by one or more of the plurality of input devices. The thalamobot may be in communication with the imagitron to raise the level of noise in the imagitron to generate new chaining within the imagitron, or to raise the level of noise in the imagitron to generate variations in interpretation of the environmental inputs to the imagitron. The thalamobot may be in communication with said imagitron to promote reinforcement of desirable chains within the imagitron, or to discourage undesirable chains within the imagitron.

A plurality of any of said neural modules may be embodied on an array of processors. The critic may be embodied within said thalamobot by one or more neural modules of a second set of neural modules, or may be embodied within the first set of neural modules of the imagitron. The thalamobot may further be in communication with the imagitron to instruct one or more of the neural modules in the first plurality of neural modules to operate hetero-associatively or auto-associatively. The input device may be a camera which captures and transmits data output from the output device in the form of topology of chains forming in the imagitron. The thalamobot may further include at least one buffer to capture ordinality of chain formations.

The first plurality of neural modules of the imagitron may emulate a stream of consciousness, and the thalamobot may promote or impede associative chains within the s imagitron representing a subjective feel of the stream of consciousness. The âsubjective feel of consciousness,â often referred to as âqualia,â are the ineffable and private sensations that are difficult to communicate to an outside observer or to duplicate in machine intelligence. Herein, this phenomenon is simulated through the formation of associative chains of artificial neural nets coined âassociative gestalts,â the term inspired by the fact that memories within such chains likely activate serially in a succession of stored sensory experiences, but the overall impression encoded in such chains is more than the sum of these individual experiences. The whole chain's total significance cannot be surmised in any instant. With chains consisting of stressful memories, collateral effects such as sweating and vasodilation take place, while the more positive memory chains may trigger neurotransmitters encoding pleasure or euphoria (Thaler, 2014). In support of arguments that such feelings cannot be numerically reproduced, the current invention partially relies upon non-numerical measures of merit to any initial thought or perception, namely the location, shape, and topology of such reactive chains within an assembly/collection of artificial neural modules.

In another example embodiment, a system for monitoring an environment comprising: an imagitron embodied on at least a first processor, in which the imagitron including a first plurality of neural modules that is capable of accepting environmental inputs; an output device in communication with the imagitron for outputting a state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules; an input device for monitoring the state of one or more of the first plurality of neural modules output via the output device; a thalamobot embodied on at least a second processor separate from the at least one first processor, in which the second processor is in electronic communication with the input device. The thalamobot also includes at least one recognition system which recognizes sub-pattern states, in which the sub-pattern states have formed in reaction to ideational sub-patterns within the first plurality of neural modules. The recognition system is then capable of determining merit or lack thereof by virtue of at least one of the location, shape, and topology of said sub-patterns.

The recognition system may control injection of noise into the imagitron and reinforcement learning within the imagitron. The thalamobot may direct chaining of neural modules within the imagitron through an associative memory. Injection of noise into the imagitron may cause the formation of latent ideas via wearing-in of pathways between modules when the thalamobot is inattentive. At least some of the first plurality of modules may each be embodied on a separate processor, in which such a processor includes registers, RAM, and a cache. A GMF may be incorporated into at least one of the registers, RAM, and cache. Each GMF may govern how its respective processor cooperates with other such GMF-equipped processors in generating associative chains within the imagitron. The thalamobot may include at least one filter for monitoring captured data from the input device and for identifying at least one state change within the captured data. The filter may pass the at least one state change to the recognition system or thalamobot.

In another example embodiment, a system for monitoring an environment comprising: an imagitron embodied on at least a first processor, in which the imagitron including a first plurality of neural modules that is capable of accepting environmental inputs; an output device in communication with the imagitron for outputting a state of one or more of the
