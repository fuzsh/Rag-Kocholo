Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal is one of Sentient's core contributors.\n\nThe project aims to address concerns about the proliferation of AI whereby the underlying code is concentrated in the hands of a few superpowers like Google or Meta.\n\nOpen-source code is that which is shared publicly allowing anyone to use it and is something of a backbone of the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.\n\n\"By building an open platform for AGI development, we aim to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably and that its development aligns with the interests of humanity as a whole,\" Nailwal said in an emailed announcement on Tuesday.\n\nSentient will enter the testnet phase this quarter., using the funds from this seed round to develop its platform and attract talent from AI research and blockchain engineering to its team.\n\nThe round was co-led by Pantera Capital and Framework Ventures and included participation from multiple other high-profile investors such as Robot Ventures, Delphi, Republic, and Arrington Capital.\n\nThiel's Founders Fund and Thiel Capital participated in a 2021 funding round for the Bullish group, which two years later acquired CoinDesk.\n\nRead More: Hut 8 Receives $150M Investment as Thirst for Energy Brings AI Firms to Bitcoin Miners\n\nUPDATE (July 15, 2024, 19:15 UTC): Adds disclosure of Thiel's past connection to CoinDesk's parent.\n\nEdited by Parikshit Mishra.\n\nDisclosure\n\nPlease note that our privacy policy, terms of use, cookies, and do not sell my personal information has been updated .\n\nCoinDesk is an award-winning media outlet that covers the cryptocurrency industry. Its journalists abide by a strict set of editorial policies. In November 2023 , CoinDesk was acquired by the Bullish group, owner of Bullish, a regulated, digital assets exchange.
