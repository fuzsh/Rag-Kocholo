        "text": "Tobii Technologyâ€™s May 2014 acquisition of DynaVox merged two companies dedicated to raising the quality of life for people with communication and mobility challenges. While Tobii had become the leading provider of eye tracking solutions for communication and computer access for individuals with ALS, Rett syndrome, spinal cord injury and cerebral palsy, DynaVox was the premier source for AAC solutions for speech, language and learning challenges related to autism, aphasia, cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders.\n\nThe union of the two companies gave the new entity an even stronger geographic presence in existing and emerging markets around the globe.\n\nToday Tobii Dynavox has a presence in over 60 countries via a network of direct and partner sales, with offices in Sweden, the US, Norway, Germany, France, the UK, China, and Japan. Through its nearly 500 employees and a global network of partners, the company reaches thousands of people, empowering them to more fully engage in life via technology.\n\nTobii Dynavox seeks to acquire companies who share its vision of a world where all people can communicate, and its commitment to empowering people with disabilities to do what they once did, or never thought possible.
