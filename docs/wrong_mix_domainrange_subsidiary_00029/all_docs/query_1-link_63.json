        "text": "G&A Institute Team Note: We continue to bring you news of private (corporate and business), public and social sector developments as organizations in the three societal sectors adjust to the emergency.\n\nThis is post #15 in the series, “Excellence in Corporate Citizenship on Display in the Coronavirus Crisis” – April 10, 2020\n\n#WeRise2FightCOVID-19 “Corporate Purpose – Virus Crisis”\n\nBy Hank Boerner –Chair & Chief Strategist – G&A Institute\n\nThe team members at G&A Institute are in conversations throughout the day with corporate managers, with the discussions centering on sharing “what companies can do / what companies are doing” to meet the challenges of the cororanvirus pandemic.\n\nThat consideration for many companies today is both internally and external focused — the key tasks are keeping people safe, serving the community’s needs, keeping the corporate operations going to be best of their ability, and looking forward to the post-crisis era.\n\nHere are a few selections of what executives and managers and their organizations are doing. As we are thinking…\n\nLife hands you the lemon / squeeze! / make the lemonade!\n\nAnd get it around to others as fast as you can.\n\nSetting An Example: Cut My Pay, Says Schein CEO\n\nStanley M. Bergman, CEO of Henry Schein Inc. (important suppliers to the medical community) is taking a temporary cut in salary during the virus crisis. As his company’s client base experiences hazards and cares for patients, the CEO (in SEC filing) will take 100% pay cut.\n\nThe company also stopped its share buyback program. The company markets equipment and supplies for clinics, dentist & doctor offices, and other segments of healthcare.\n\nSchein is a co-founder of the Pandemic Supply Chain Network, using its own supply chain for distribution of testing supplies. The network was created at the 2015 Davos meeting as a public-private partnership. Now, the PSCN is part of the global COVID-19 response.\n\nInformation for you if would like to become a part of the effort: https://www.weforum.org/projects/pandemic-supply-chain-network-pscn\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nApple & Google Teaming For New “Contact-Tracing” Bluetooth App\n\nIt’s hard to get one’s head around the pandemic: millions, tens of millions, yes billions of people are stationary, immobile, not able to move around, sheltered at home, working remotely.\n\nAnd tens of millions of us are not able to not move around, we must be at our posts, picking the crops, stocking the warehouse, driving the truck, stocking the shelves, manning the cash registers at retail.\n\nOr more frightening, driving the ambulance, being on post in the emergency room or in the ICU, or in the wards with non-COVID patients.\n\nOr driving the police car to respond to “the unknown”, or the fire truck to extinguish the blaze and save lives. Think about the EMT in the ambulance, hour after hour, running to danger.\n\nKeeping on touch, virtually all of us, mobile and immobile rely on our cell phone…the lifeline to loved ones as well.\n\nFor those who must be on their designated post, moving around, interacting, the fear is that the virus could be too close, within reach to infect. To the rescue: Apple Inc. and Google – in a rare partnership, the rivals are adding technology to the phone to alert us if we’ve come into contact with a person with the virus.\n\nThis is to be an opt-in feature – “contact-tracing” – that immediately alerts us: quarantine and isolate and then treat or seek treatment because we have been in close contact with an infected person.\n\nOver time we can expect to see this application added to the basic phone operating systems.\n\nWatch for the news in May for iPhones and Android; the management of the system will be by public health agencies. The reports to the phone will be on anonymous basis. As the two companies announced the collaboration, The phone owner must opt-in to be part of the network.\n\nMIT says it is developing a similar system. Of course, there are numerous privacy protection issues – we’ll see how that goes on the rollout.\n\nFacebook Joins the Tracing Effort\n\nFacebook is one of the world’s leading social media platforms (claiming 2 billion-plus of the “connected”). Users are invited to share their own coronavirus symptoms and experiences to help researchers pinpoint “where” the disease is occurring.\n\nCarnegie Mellon, the great tech school, is using the data in pilot effort to try to see where data is telling us help is needed. Such as the all-important ventilators that are in such short supply. Or where “go home/stay home” guidance or orders are needed. The output is going to be shared with public sector health managers.\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nHeaded to the Drug Store? How Do You Know What You Need is There?\n\nThe CEO of the nationwide CVS drug store network, Larry Merlo, was interviewed by Barron’s Jack Hough. The CVS stores are in the midst of becoming “HealthHUBS” (to provide medical services) and strengthening is “Caremark” program for pharmacy benefits management. And now, the CVS workforce is pressed to help customers in the midst of the virus crisis.\n\nExplains CEO Merlo: Home deliveries are up by three times the usual volume. Tele-medicine connections are up two times. CVS waived copays for tele-medicine and for deliveries. COVID-19 testing was starting in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts (in a store parking lot) to do 100-plus test a day. Stores are being kept stocked. Limits are applied to prevent hoarding.\n\nThe company maintains close contact with suppliers to keep the pipeline stocked and moving to stores. CDC guidelines are followed in the stores. Cash bonuses are being doled out to hourly store staff, pharmacists, managers. There is day care service where possible; sick leave is granted to part-timers.\n\nLessons Learned: Keeping mind the Chinese sign for crisis (“danger” and “opportunity”), we learn that the CVS CEO thinks the crisis has helped to strengthen the firm’s confidence in what CVS can do to help to change the trajectory of healthcare delivery.\n\nPharmacies (local) and tele-medicine (distant) are key elements. The critical role that healthcare professionals play in local communities (where CVS outlets are located) is really being demonstrated today.\n\nMarriott and Hilton have been working with CVS to create a transition for those folks who are furloughed. Speaking of Marriott…\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nHolding on to Customers / Serving the Local Community & Responders\n\nMarriott CEO Arne Sorenson in communications to patrons explains that cancellations for scheduled trips are being adjusted out to June 30th (usually 24 hours notice is required). Expiration of points accrued for use at the properties is being extended. “Experience flexibility” is the theme.\n\nAnd about helping the communities in which the resorts and hotels are based:\n\nMarriott properties are donating food, pre-cooked and cooked meals to crisis responders, as well as a supply of cleaning products, masks, gloves, sanitizers, wipes, shower caps, anti-microbial wipes, and other supplies to local communities. Hotel windows sport signs and symbols of love and support to those passing by.\n\nWorking with American Express and JPMorgan Chase (two credit card partnering organizations), Marriott committed to provide $10 million worth of hotel stays to professionals on the front lines of the crisis. “Rooms for Responders” are being made available in New York City, New Orleans, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington DC, and Newark, New Jersey.\n\nTo reach the responders, Marriott is working with the American College of Emergency Physicians and Emergency Nurses Association to help match doctors and nurses with available rooms.\n\nAnd the “Community Caregiver Program” initiative (coordinated by franchisees and property owners) provides deep discount accommodations near to hospitals to first responders and healthcare professionals stepping up to serve local communities. This is available in North America, the Caribbean and Latin America (at 2,500 hotels to date).\n\n* * * * * * * *\n\nThe Food Supply in the Crisis – Changes in Post-Crisis Behaviors\n\nWhat is happening in the food sector? Mike Geraghty writing on the Sensient Technologies Corporation platform shares the results of a mid-March 2020 study by Nielsen that forecasts six key consumer behavior shifts happening during the crisis.\n\nThe findings will have a major impact on the food industry and will/could lead to permanent changes in the way consumers shop for food.\n\nThese are (by their headlines):\n\nProactive Health-Minded Buying\n\nReactive Health Management\n\nPantry Preparation\n\nQuarantined Living Preparation\n\nRestricted Living\n\nLiving a New Normal\n\nUnder each category headlines there are explanations of the shifts seen in consumer behavior and COVID-19 event markers. There’s valuable findings and shared perspectives here for you from the Sentient folks (providers of color technologies and services for the food and beverage industries).\n\nThe commentary: https://sensientfoodcolors.com/en-us/global-markets/covid-19-changing-food-industry/?utm_source=FoodNavigator&utm_medium=Email%20Top%20Text%20US&utm_campaign=COVID&utm_content=Apr%202020\n\n* * * * * * * *"
