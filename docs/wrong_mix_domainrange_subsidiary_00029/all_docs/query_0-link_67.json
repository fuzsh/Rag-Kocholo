        "text": "Public Policy Studies (PBPL) Courses\n\nPBPL 20000. Economics for Public Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course develops the microeconomic theories of consumer and producer choices, as well as demonstrates the application of these theoretical tools to policy problems. Supply, demand, and competitive markets are examined, along with the conditions under which government policy can increase efficiency.\n\nInstructor(s): Carolyn Sloane Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Completion of two quarters of calculus required; prior knowledge of economics not required. For ECON majors and students who have taken ECON 20000: consent of instructor required.\n\nNote(s): PBPL 20000 or ECON 20000 is required of all students who are majoring in public policy. PBPL 20000 satisfies the ECON 20000 prerequisite for PBPL 22200. Students who have taken ECON 20000 require the instructor's consent to enroll in PBPL 20000.\n\nPBPL 20115. Women, Peace and Security. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on critical feminist theorizing and scholarship on militarization, war and masculinities, and on feminist articulations of peace and (demilitarized) security. Students will learn about the transnational feminist research, policy and advocacy network known as the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda, and the important inroads this network has made in establishing international and national policies in the fields of gender, conflict, peace and development. The course highlights the background, history and policy significance of the historic Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security, as well as subsequent and related UN resolutions. Students will also learn about alternative feminist approaches and visions for international peace and security, through powerful case study examples of feminist activism, solidarity and diplomacy.\n\nInstructor(s): Maliha Chishti Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): PBPL 28498 Women, Development and Politics (recommended)\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 47420, GNSE 40115, GNSE 20115\n\nPBPL 20150. Sustainable Urban Development. 100 Units.\n\nThe course covers concepts and methods of sustainable urbanism, livable cities, resiliency, and smart growth principles from a social, environmental and economic perspective. In this course we examine how the development in and of cities - in the US and around the world - can be sustainable, especially given predictions of a future characterized by increasing environmental and social volatility. We begin by critiquing definitions of sustainability. The fundamental orientation of the course will be understanding cities as complex socio-natural systems, and so we will look at approaches to sustainability grouped around several of the most important component systems: climate, energy, transportation, and water. With the understanding that sustainability has no meaning if it excludes human life, perspectives from both the social sciences and humanities are woven throughout: stewardship and environmental ethics are as important as technological solutions and policy measures.\n\nInstructor(s): Winter: Staff, Spring: Evan Carver Terms Offered: Spring Winter\n\nNote(s): ENST 21201 and 20150 are required of students who are majoring in Environmental and Urban Studies and may be taken in any order.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARCH 20150, ENST 20150, CEGU 20150, GLST 20150\n\nPBPL 20170. Pandemics, Urban Space, and Public Life. 100 Units.\n\nMuch of the cultural vibrance, economic strength, and social innovation that characterizes cities can be credited to their density. Put simply, cities bring people together, and togetherness allows for complex and fruitful exchange. But togetherness also brings risks, notably from infectious disease. A pandemic feeds on propinquity. \"Social distance,\" while a short-term public health imperative, is antithetical to the very idea of the urban. In this seminar, we will explore these competing tensions in light of current and past disease outbreaks in urban settings. Drawing on a range of texts from history, design theory, sociology, and anthropology, as well as cultural artifacts like film, graphic memoir, and photography, we will engage questions like: How are the risks of contagion balanced with the benefits of density? How are such risks distributed throughout society? What creative responses have architects, urban designers, and planners brought to this challenge? Most importantly, how can we respond constructively to the challenge of pandemic to create cities where the benefits of togetherness are maximized, perhaps even improved on compared with the pre-outbreak condition? Students will have the opportunity to propose design or policy interventions to help their own communities respond to the coronavirus/COVID-19 crisis, return to a vibrant post-pandemic life, and prepare for the pandemics of the future.\n\nInstructor(s): Evan Carver Terms Offered: Autumn Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 20170, CEGU 20170, ARCH 20170, GEOG 20170, HLTH 20170\n\nPBPL 20305. Inequality in Urban Spaces. 100 Units.\n\nThe problems confronting urban schools are bound to the social, economic, and political conditions of the urban environments in which schools reside. Thus, this course will explore social, economic, and political issues, with an emphasis on issues of race and class as they have affected the distribution of equal educational opportunities in urban schools. We will focus on the ways in which family, school, and neighborhood characteristics intersect to shape the divergent outcomes of low- and middle-income children residing with any given neighborhood. Students will tackle an important issue affecting the residents and schools in one Chicago neighborhood. This course is part of the College Course Cluster: Urban Design.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Keels Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): CHDV Distribution: B; 2*\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 20305, EDSO 40315, CHDV 30315, CHDV 20305\n\nPBPL 20521. Sociology of urban planning: cities, territories, environments. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides a high-intensity introduction to the sociology of urban planning practice under modern capitalism. Building upon urban sociology, planning theory and history as well as urban social science and environmental studies, we explore the emergence, development and continual transformation of urban planning in relation to changing configurations of capitalist urbanization, modern state power, sociopolitical insurgency and environmental crisis. Following an initial exploration of divergent conceptualizations of \"planning\" and \"urbanization,\" we investigate the changing sites and targets of planning; struggles regarding the instruments, goals and constituencies of planning; the contradictory connections between planning and diverse configurations of power in modern society (including class, race, gender and sexuality); and the possibility that new forms of planning might help produce more socially just and environmentally sane forms of urbanization in the future.\n\nInstructor(s): N. Brenner Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): KNOW 30521, ENST 20521, GEOG 20521, PLSC 20521, CHST 20521, PPHA 30521, CEGU 20521, SOCI 30521, PLSC 30521, ARCH 20521, SOCI 20521\n\nPBPL 20555. The Sociology of Work. 100 Units.\n\nFrom the Great Depression to the Great Resignation, paid work has played a central role in American life. The average American spends 1/3 of their life at work - making it an area of the social world heavily examined by politicians, journalists, and social scientists. In this course, we will look at the structural and interpersonal dynamics of work to consider the questions of what makes a \"good job\" in America and who gets to decide? Our topics will include low-wage work, the stigma of \"dirty jobs,\" gender and racial inequality at work, physical and emotional labor on the job, side hustles and the gig economy, and life after retirement. Students will be required to write a 15 page research paper that draws on interview data they will collect over the quarter. No prior background in doing interviews is required!\n\nInstructor(s): K. Schilt Terms Offered: Winter. Not Being offered in 2024/25\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHDV 24711, SOCI 20555, GNSE 20555\n\nPBPL 21011. Clinical Research Design and Interpretation of Health Data. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will introduce the interdisciplinary field of clinically oriented health services research with a focus on the interpretation of health-related metrics and policy-related applications. We will examine how translational medical science informs healthcare providers, payers, and professional societies. COVID-19 and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy will illustrate the challenges of data interpretation, translation of research findings into clinical medicine, and the adoption of evidence-based guidelines. Using a highly interactive approach, students will gain experience in selection of research study designs, measurement of health status, risk adjustment, causal inference, and understanding the placebo effect. We will discuss how clinicians, administrators, and public reporting entities judge and use information derived from investigations. The COVID-19 pandemic will demonstrate the challenges that varied clinical presentations, diagnostic accuracy, and case definition (identification of diseased patients) create in the formulation of health statistics (e.g., case-fatality rates and disease attribution of mortality). We will also discuss methods of defining study populations for both clinical research and public health reporting.\n\nInstructor(s): Gregory Ruhnke Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HLTH 21011, CCTS 21011, CCTS 41011, BIOS 29331\n\nPBPL 21425. Health in a Changing America: Social Context and Human Rights. 100 Units.\n\nIn this interdisciplinary course, students will consider the social context of health and the social and political commitments necessary to protect health as a human right. We will analyze recent trends in population health, such as the obesity epidemic, the opioid crisis, and the large gaps in life expectancy between neighborhoods in urban centers. Using case studies, students will envision a human rights-based response to these and other health challenges. We will examine the ways that framing health as personal versus public responsibility is consequential for social policy.\n\nInstructor(s): Alicia Riley, Graduate Lecturer in Human Rights Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HMRT 21403\n\nPBPL 21800. Economics and Environmental Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course combines basic microeconomic theory and tools with contemporary environmental and resources issues and controversies to examine and analyze public policy decisions. Theoretical points include externalities, public goods, common-property resources, valuing resources, benefit/cost analysis, and risk assessment. Topics include pollution, global climate change, energy use and conservation, recycling and waste management, endangered species and biodiversity, nonrenewable resources, congestion, economic growth and the environment, and equity impacts of public policies.\n\nInstructor(s): S. Shaikh Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): ECON 10000 or higher, or PBPL 20000\n\nNote(s): Not offered in Autumn of the 2020-21 academic year.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 21800, ENST 21800, ECON 16520\n\nPBPL 21850. Legislative Politics. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the policymaking process and politics of legislatures. We will study legislative institutions; the decision-making processes of individual legislators; and the role of outside advocates and interests. Our goal is to understand how legislatures work - in terms of producing policy that incorporates expertise and responds to policy demands from the public - and why they often don't.\n\nInstructor(s): Zelizer, A Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 31850\n\nPBPL 22006. Decision Modeling for Health Economic Evaluation. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces decision science and economic evaluation that has been increasingly used to inform public health and health care decisions. With a specific focus on the development and application of decision-analytic models, students will learn the state of the current practice of economic evaluation, new tools and methodologies to conduct decision modeling, and emerging areas of research, including the value of information analysis. The course will provide hands-on computer-based learning using the R programming language for data analysis and modeling. A prior experience in R is welcomed, but not required. Applying the concepts and techniques learned in the course, students will undertake a course project of their choice to conduct economic evaluation using decision-analytic models. By the end of this course, students will gain knowledge and practical skills in economic evaluation and decision modeling to help make informed decisions.\n\nInstructor(s): David Kim Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CCTS 22006, CCTS 42006, PPHA 42006\n\nPBPL 22100. Politics and Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course has two fundamental aims. The first is to introduce students to a set of analytical tools and concepts for understanding how political institutions generate public policy. The second is to apply these tools in examining the major institutions of democracy in the United States. Note(s): Public Policy 22100-22200-22300 may be taken in any order.\n\nInstructor(s): C. Berry Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Public Policy 22100-22200-22300 may be taken in any order.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DEMS 22100\n\nPBPL 22200. Public Policy Analysis. 100 Units.\n\nThis course reviews and augments the basic tools of microeconomics developed in ECON 20000 and applies these tools to policy problems. We examine situations in which private markets are likely to produce unsatisfactory results, suggesting a potential rationale for government intervention. Our goal is to allow students to comprehend, develop, and respond to economics arguments when formulating or evaluating public policy.\n\nInstructor(s): J. Leitzel Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): PBPL 20000 or ECON 20000\n\nNote(s): PBPL 22100-22200-22300 may be taken in any order. PBPL 22200 is not intended for students majoring in public policy who are planning to specialize in economics or to take advanced economics courses; those students should meet with the program director or administrator to arrange an alternative.\n\nPBPL 22300. Policy Implementation. 100 Units.\n\nGood public policy has the potential to advance justice in society. However, once a policy or program is put in place, policymakers often face challenges in getting it carried out in the ways it was intended. This course explores some of the structural and cultural challenges that government and organizations face as they attempt to put policies into effect. Focusing on the United States, we will draw on organizational theory as well as case studies from education, policing, healthcare, and the corporate world in order to investigate the broader context of policy implementation. In addition to the lectures, there will be a weekly discussion section with the TA, the exact time of which will be determined during Week 1 of the quarter.\n\nInstructor(s): Chad Broughton (Autumn); Karlyn Gorski (Winter and Spring) Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): Second-year standing is recommended.\n\nNote(s): PBPL 22100-22200-22300 may be taken in any order.\n\nPBPL 22312. Cities, Nature and the Planet. 100 Units.\n\nCities face major challenges in addressing environmental risk and vulnerability, but also great opportunity to reconsider the design, planning and economic systems upon which they have traditionally relied. This course takes a contemporary look into how urbanization affects planetary health, focusing on cities as sites of global resource extraction, waste generation, biodiversity loss, and increasing social inequality and climate vulnerability; but also as centers of population, innovation and social organization, which can facilitate climate solutions. Using a range of social science approaches and methods, students will consider critiques of historical urban planning and linear city resource economies, and analyze contemporary approaches related to climate action, green space planning, and nature-based solutions, with specific attention on environmental goals and equity outcomes. Through critical exploration of both historical urban planning, and contemporary frameworks for sustainable city agenda setting, students will consider the environmental past, present and future of global cities. In Autumn 2024, this course will be part of the Paris Urbanism Study Abroad program. Students will focus on Paris but take a comparative look at cities across the Global North and Global South.\n\nInstructor(s): Sabina Shaikh Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course is part of the Paris Urbanism Study Abroad program\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 22312, GLST 22312\n\nPBPL 23007. Clinical and Health Services Research: Methods and Applications. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will introduce the interdisciplinary field of clinically-oriented health services research with a focus on policy-related implications. Through exposure to theoretical foundations, methodologies, and applications, students without significant investigative experience will learn about the design and conduct of research studies. We will cover the integration of research within the stages of translational medicine, and how science conducted across the translational medicine spectrum informs policy through purveyors of clinical services (e.g. physicians, hospitals), government, insurers, and professional societies. We will use the examples of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation to illustrate pitfalls in the progression from basic science research to clinical trials leading to diffusion in clinical medicine that can complicate the creation of logical, evidence-based practice guidelines, reimbursement, and clinical practice.\n\nInstructor(s): Greg Ruhnke Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): BIOS 29329, CCTS 21007, CCTS 43007, HLTH 21007\n\nPBPL 23011. Beyond the Culture Wars: Social Movements and the Politics of Education in the U.S. 100 Units.\n\nPassionate conflicts over school curriculum and educational policy are a recurring phenomenon in the history of US schooling. Why are schools such frequent sites of struggle and what is at stake in these conflicts? In this discussion-based seminar, we will consider schools as battlegrounds in the US \"culture wars\": contests over competing visions of national identity, morality, social order, the fundamental purposes of public education, and the role of the state vis-à-vis the family. Drawing on case studies from history, anthropology, sociology and critical race and gender studies, we will examine both past and contemporary debates over school curriculum and school policy. Topics may include clashes over: the teaching of evolution, sex and sexuality education, busing/desegregation, prayer in schools, multiculturalism, the content of the literary canon, the teaching of reading, mathematics and history, and the closure of underperforming urban schools. Our inquiry will examine how social and political movements have used schools to advance or resist particular agendas and social projects.\n\nInstructor(s): Lisa Rosen Terms Offered: Spring. Offered spring 2025\n\nEquivalent Course(s): EDSO 23011, SOCI 20588, HIST 37718, CHDV 23011, SOCI 30588, CHDV 33011, EDSO 33011, HIST 27718\n\nPBPL 23100. Environmental Law. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the bases and assumptions that have driven the development of environmental law, as well as the intersection of this body of law and foundational legal principles (including standing, liability, and the Commerce Clause). Each form of lawmaking (statutes, regulations, and court decisions) will be examined, with emphasis on reading and understanding primary sources such as court cases and the laws themselves. The course also analyzes the judicial selection process in order to understand the importance of how the individuals who decide cases that determine the shape of environmental law and regulations are chosen.\n\nInstructor(s): Ray Lodato Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): 3rd or 4th year standing, or consent of instructor\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 23100, CEGU 23100\n\nPBPL 23200. The Economics of Crime. 100 Units.\n\nThis course uses theoretical and empirical economic tools to analyze a wide range of issues related to criminal behavior. Topics include the police, prisons, gang behavior, guns, drugs, capital punishment, labor markets and the macroeconomy, and income inequality. We emphasize the analysis of the optimal role for public policy.\n\nInstructor(s): S. Levitt\n\nPrerequisite(s): ECON 20100/20110; STAT 23400, ECON 21010, or ECON 21020 strongly recommended\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ECON 28700\n\nPBPL 23300. Justice, Equity, and Opportunity: Shifting Approaches to Criminal Justice Reform. 100 Units.\n\nThe events revolving the death of George Floyd have proliferated the discourse about the criminal justice system in the United States, including the role of police and incarceration. Historically, this public discourse has been dominated mostly by media and political advocacy, with the balance of evidence-based policy solutions and political acumen receiving relatively short shrift. In this practicum, students will be trained to approach these issues from the perspective of a senior criminal justice policymaker in government who has practiced multiple theories of change, from community organizing to litigation. In turn, we will develop criminal justice policy intelligence and knowledge on the history, core themes, debates, and concepts, such as the movement to defund the police, abolish the cash bail system, and decriminalize drugs. The discussions will allow students to interrogate the extent to which efforts have been successful, imagine new strategies in the future, and learn from additional visiting guests, including politicians, community organizers, academics, artists, and formerly incarcerated individuals. We will exit with a sophisticated understanding of the skills and tools necessary to handle criminal justice policy problems raising complex legal, political and social questions.\n\nInstructor(s): Rallins, Quinn Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): In addition to a seminar component examining criminal justice policy, students engage in a hands-on policy project involving identifying and defining key criminal issues, conducting primary and secondary research, analyzing research findings and making policy recommendations to a client in the criminal justice policy arena.\n\nPBPL 23305. Justice in an Unjust World: Theories of Justice. 100 Units.\n\nJustice as a possibility, an ideal, and as a telos is fundamental to theological and philosophical systems of ethics. Yet, each theory was formulated within and against a deeply unjust world. Every theory of justice implies an anthropology and an ontology, and each asks the question: Why isn't life fair? How can we can we create a just society against a world that is so obviously unjust? Each theory then proposes a just solution and every theory implies a set of practices that can be interrogated. As our contemporary society becomes more sharply divided, the issues of distribution, obligation, entitlement, fair exchanges of social goods and labor, and the fair sharing of social burdens becomes more important and demanding of more inquiry. This seminar will interrogate several theories of justice, beginning in classic Hellenistic texts and moving forward to the animating theories of the classic liberal tradition: libertarianism, utilitarianism, social contract theory, and Marxism. We will then turn to other sources of justice theory such as Catholic liberation theology, capacity theory, and Jewish justice theory. We will also use our seminar to explore contemporary cases in law, medicine, science and policy that raise issues of justice and injustice. While the seminar will focus on distributive practices, we will also explore how these practices structure our systems of retributive and restorative justice.\n\nInstructor(s): Laurie Zoloth Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): This course counts as an elective course for the \"Inequality, Social Problems, and Change\" minor.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLST 24102, GLST 24202\n\nPBPL 23550. Urban Ecology and the Nature of Cities. 100 Units.\n\nUrban ecology is an interdisciplinary field derived from the academic discipline of ecology. How well does classical ecological theory, typically formed from reductionist views of nature without humans, describe and predict patterns in human-dominated landscapes? Students will learn fundamental concepts in ecological theory, examine how these concepts apply to urban systems, and explore the paradigms of ecology in, of, and for cities. Readings and discussions will focus on classical research papers from the ecological literature, history of modern ecology, and contemporary approaches to studying biotic systems in cities.\n\nInstructor(s): Alison Anastasio Terms Offered: Winter. Not offered Winter 2021\n\nNote(s): Not offered Winter 2021\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 23550\n\nPBPL 23604. Rockonomics: Public Policy and Creative Sectors. 100 Units.\n\nThis course delves into major topics in public policy through the lens of the music industry and other creative sectors. We will use an applied microeconomist's toolbox to explore issues such as intellectual property protection, collective bargaining, music royalties in a digital age, consolidation, proposed regulations to live events pricing and much more. As part of this class, we will engage in conversations with professionals working in creative sectors.\n\nInstructor(s): Carolyn Sloane Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPBPL 23606. Political Culture, Social Capital, and The Arts. 100 Units.\n\nMany analysts like Robert Putnam hold that bowling alone signals a decline in social capital, with major consequences for trust and legitimacy of the political system. But new work finds that certain arts and cultural activities are rising, especially among the young, in many countries. This course reviews core related concepts--political culture, social capital, legitimacy-and how they change with these new developments. We lay out new concepts and related methods, such as a grammar of scenes, measured for 40,000+ U.S. zip codes. Scenes, nightlife, design, the internet, and entertainment emerge as critical drivers of the post-industrial/knowledge society. Older primordial conflicts over class, race, and gender are transformed with these new issues, which spark new social movements and political tensions. The course has two halves: first to read and discuss major works and complete a mid-term exam, second to continue as a seminar where the main requirement is writing a paper.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SOCI 30184, SOCI 20184\n\nPBPL 23700. Geographical Issues in Housing and Community Development. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is part of the College Course Cluster, Urban Design.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Conzen Terms Offered: Spring. This course offered in even years.\n\nPrerequisite(s): Open to Chicago Studies Program students.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ENST 23777, GEOG 33700\n\nPBPL 24005. Chicago Neighborhoods. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an applied learning experience in which students explore the many dimensions of Chicago neighborhoods, with a particular focus on the built environment and how it impacts - and is impacted by - the social and economic life of the city. Students will observe, interpret and represent neighborhoods through a series of exercises designed to deepen knowledge about the significance and meaning of neighborhood form. Readings and fieldwork will engage students in neighborhood analysis and observation techniques that explore contemporary issues about public life, diversity, and social equity. This course is part of the College Course Cluster, Urban Design.\n\nInstructor(s): Emily Talen Terms Offered: TBD. Not offered in 2023-2024 academic year.\n\nNote(s): Restricted to 3rd and 4th years This course counts towards the ENST 4th year Capstone requirement.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GEOG 24000, ENST 26000, CHST 26000, SOSC 26000\n\nPBPL 24102. Environmental Politics. 100 Units.\n\nPolitics determines not only what particular faction holds power, but the parameters upon which contests for power are conducted. Competing political factions may diverge in the details of the policies they favor, but may agree on a central organizing principle upon which their policy differences are contested. This course acknowledges that such principles exist and structure politics, economics, and social arrangements, but also challenges the notion that these are immutable, and argues that other principles could be substituted which would drastically change these arrangements. The course introduces students to alternative theories of economics, politics, and environmental policy that challenge mainstream notions of what is acceptable under the current structural and institutional constraints, including how the retreat to notions of realism and practicality place limits on changes necessary to preserve and protect the natural environment.\n\nInstructor(s): R. Lodato Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 24102, ENST 24102\n\nPBPL 24105. Urban Design: The Chicago Experience. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the theory and practice of urban design at the scale of block, street, and building--the pedestrian realm. Topics include walkability, the design of streets, architectural style and its effect on pedestrian experience, safety and security in relation to accessibility and social connection, concepts of urban fabric, repair and placemaking, the regulation of urban form, and the social implications of civic spaces. Students will analyze normative principles and the debates that surround them through readings and discussion, as well as firsthand interaction with the urbanism of Chicago.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GEOG 24100, SOSC 36001, SOSC 26001, GEOG 34100\n\nPBPL 24540. Weak Regimes and the Politics of Development. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to specialized set of topics and concepts that are of particular relevance to policy making in developing countries. The course begins by providing an overview on the functioning of politics in weakly institutionalized settings, and explores the ways in which political institutions in these settings hinder or contribute to economic development. Topics of this course include but are not limited to: State formation and state capacity, political regimes and development, foreign influence, resource curse, and civil conflict. Methodologically, this course introduces to students basic techniques of using formal model to analyze political phenomena. This course aims at enhancing student's understanding about politics from the perspective of a policy entrepreneur who develops strategy in order to advance policy changes.\n\nInstructor(s): Zhaosong Ruan Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Prerequisites: PBPL 20000 required. PBPL 26400 recommended but not required.\n\nPBPL 24599. Historical and Contemporary Issues in U.S. Racial Health Inequality. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores persistent health inequality in the U.S. from the 1900s to the present day. The focus will be on racial gaps in urban health inequality with some discussion of rural communities. Readings will largely cover the research on Black and White gaps in health inequality, with the understanding that most of the issues discussed extend to health inequalities across many racial and ethnic groups. Readings cover the broad range of social determinants of health (socioeconomic status, education, access to health care, homelessness) and how these social determinants are rooted in longstanding legacies of American inequality. A major component of class assignments will be identifying emerging research and innovative policies and programs that point to promising pathways to eliminating health disparities.\n\nInstructor(s): M. Keels Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Only students with 2nd year standing or above.\n\nNote(s): Fulfills grad requirement: 2,4 and undergrad major requirement B.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHDV 24599, HLTH 24599, CHDV 44599, RDIN 24599, CHST 24599\n\nPBPL 24605. Introduction to Urban Sciences. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is a grand tour of conceptual frameworks, general phenomena, emerging data and policy applications that define a growing scientific integrated understanding of cities and urbanization. It starts with a general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic and environmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics and geography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and other facets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as social networks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated in different geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergent institutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth. The second part of the course will deal with issues of inequality, heterogeneity and (sustainable) growth in cities. We will explore how these features of cities present different realities and opportunities to different individuals and how these appear as spatially concentrated (dis)advantage that shape people's life courses. We will show how issues of inequality also have consequences at more macroscopic levels and derive the general features of population and economic growth for systems of cities and nations.\n\nInstructor(s): Luis Bettencourt Terms Offered: TBD\n\nPrerequisite(s): STAT 22000\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GISC 34600, SOCI 20285, ENST 24600, GISC 24600, CEGU 24600\n\nPBPL 24701. U.S. Environmental Policy. 100 Units.\n\nHow environmental issues and challenges in the United States are addressed is subject to abrupt changes and reversals caused by extreme partisanship and the heightened significance of the issues for the health of the planet and all its inhabitants. The relatively brief history of this policy area, and the separate and distinct tracts in which public lands and pollution control issues are adjudicated, makes for a diverse and complex process by which humanity's impact on the natural world is managed and contained. This course focuses on how both types of environmental issues are addressed in each branch of the Federal government, the states and localities, as well as theories of how environmental issues arrived onto the public agenda and why attention to them is cyclical. Students are encouraged to understand the life cycle of public policy from its initial arrival on the public agenda to the passage of legislation to address adverse conditions, as well as how changes in the policy occur after the inevitable decline of intensive attention.\n\nInstructor(s): R.

Impact investing: Using Impact Capital to Address Social Problems. 100 Units.\n\nWhile modern-day impact investing (investing with the goal of generating both financial and positive social/environmental returns) has been around for fifty years, only in the last decade has this movement really caught on achieving mainstream levels of attention and awareness. Investors of all types are seeking to align their values with their investments and every day we see more examples of companies being held accountable (either by themselves or by their stakeholders) for the social and/or environmental externalities of their operations. Through a combination of readings, case studies, class discussion and projects, the course provides an introduction to and overview of the impact investing landscape, the range of investment opportunities across asset classes, and the opportunities and challenges for investors seeking meaningful impact investment vehicles. Students will learn the entire impact investment process from deal sourcing, financial and programmatic due diligence, to investment structuring to monitoring financial and social returns. Led by an experienced practitioner and supplemented by guest speakers, this course will provide both an intellectual and experiential understanding of double-bottom-line investing.\n\nInstructor(s): Christa Velasquez Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): Suggested prior coursework: PBPL 24751 The Business of Non-Profits and The Evolving Social Sector\n\nPBPL 24776. International Environmental Policy. 100 Units.\n\nEnvironmental issues have become a prominent part of the work of international organizations and their member nations. However, the resolution to issues and concerns shared in common by the nations of the world often faces obstacles based on access to wealth and resources, political and military power, and the demands of international economic institutions. While multinational agreements have been achieved and successfully implemented, resolutions to issues such as climate change have been harder to achieve. The course will look at the origins of international cooperation on environmental issues, several case studies of issues upon which the international community has attempted to bring about cooperative solutions (climate change, the ozone hole, climate refugees, etc.), and the work that regional associations of nations have done to jointly address shared environmental challenges. In addition, speakers from various consulates have addressed the class to discuss environmental policymaking in their countries.\n\nInstructor(s): R. Lodato Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 24776, ENST 24776\n\nPBPL 24800. Urban Policy Analysis. 100 Units.\n\nCities are sites of challenge and innovation worldwide. Dramatic new policies can be implemented locally and chart new paths for national policies. Five main approaches are compared: Leadership patterns: are business, political, or other kinds of leaders more important--and where, when, and why do these matter? Second do capitalism, or more recently, global markets, make specific leaders irrelevant? Third: leaders like mayors are weaker since citizens, interest groups, and media have grown so powerful. Fourth innovation drives many policy issues. Fifth consumption, entertainment, and the arts engage citizens in new ways. Can all five hold, in some locations? Why should they differentially operate across big and small, rich and poor neighborhoods, cities, and countries? The course introduces you to core urban issues, whether your goal is to conduct research, interpret reports by others, make policy decisions, or watch the tube and discuss these issues as a more informed citizen. Chicago, US and big and small locations internationally are considered; all methods are welcome.\n\nInstructor(s): T.

Trade, Development and Poverty in Mexico. 100 Units.\n\nWith a focus on the past two decades, this interdisciplinary course explores the impact of economic integration, urbanization, and migration on Mexico and, to a lesser extent, on the United States-in particular, working class communities of the Midwestern Rust Belt. The course will examine work and life in the borderland production centers; agriculture, poverty, and indigenous populations in rural Mexico; evolving trade and transnational ties (especially in people, food products and labor, and drugs) between the U.S. and Mexico; and trade, trade adjustment, and immigration policy.\n\nInstructor(s): C.

Inequality at Work: The Changing Nature of Jobs and Prospects for Improvement. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will consider sources of inequality in the labor market and in workplaces. Empirical evidence and theory on labor markets and job conditions will be analyzed to provide insights into the changing nature of work and workplace inequality for the majority of Americans -- who do not hold a four-year college degree. Although the course will consider ways to ready workers for good jobs in the economy, the emphasis will be on improving jobs themselves, through voluntary employer behavior, collective action, and public policy. The assignment for the course involves observing and/or interviewing workers in an occupation chosen by the student.\n\nInstructor(s): Susan Lambert Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): SSAD 25005\n\nPBPL 25120. Child Development and Public Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThe goal of this course is to introduce students to the literature on early child development and explore how an understanding of core developmental concepts can inform social policies. This goal will be addressed through an integrated, multidisciplinary approach. The course will emphasize research on the science of early child development from the prenatal period through school entry. The central debate about the role of early experience in development will provide a unifying strand for the course. Students will be introduced to research in neuroscience, psychology, economics, sociology, and public policy as it bears on questions about \"what develops?\", critical periods in development, the nature vs. nurture debate, and the ways in which environmental contexts (e.g., parents, families, peers, schools, institutions, communities) affect early development and developmental trajectories. The first part of the course will introduce students to the major disciplinary streams in the developmental sciences and the enduring and new debates and perspectives within the field. The second part will examine the multiple contexts of early development to understand which aspects of young children's environments affect their development and how those impacts arise. Throughout the course, we will explore how the principles of early childhood development can guide the design of policies and practices that enhance the healthy development of young children, particularly for those living in adverse circumstances, and thereby build a strong foundation for promoting equality of opportunity, reducing social class disparities in life outcomes, building human capital, fostering economic prosperity, and generating positive social change. In doing so, we will critically examine the evidence on whether the contexts of children's development are amenable to public policy intervention and the costs and benefits of different policy approaches.\n\nInstructor(s): A.

Constructing a Society of Human Rights: A Psychological Framework. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is designed to discuss the ways that cultural and social psychology contribute to understandings about human rights conceptually, and how human rights issues emerge from social dynamics. Over the course of the quarter, students will learn about theories on intergroup conflict and prejudice, how an individual's beliefs emerge from social contexts and shape their relationships with others, how obedience to authority is created and abused, and how social positioning and narratives influence conceptions of self and other. We will also discuss the relevance and impact of psychological study and data on human rights issues.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CHDV 25220, INRE 30600, HMRT 25220\n\nPBPL 25500. Introduction to U.S. Health Policy and Politics. 100 Units.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to introduce students to the concepts needed to critically evaluate U.S. health policy issues. The course will 1) provide an overview of the U.S. health system including its institutions, stakeholders, and financing mechanisms, 2) describe the politics of health and illuminate how the structure of our political system shapes health policy outcomes, and 3) offer a framework for assessing the critical features central to health policy debates. Building upon this knowledge, the course will conclude with a discussion of strategies for influencing the health policy process and how they might be employed in future leadership roles within the health sector.\n\nInstructor(s): Loren Saulsberry Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPrerequisite(s): None\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HLTH 25500, SSAD 45011, PBHS 35500, PPHA 37720\n\nPBPL 25510. Issues in Health Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course introduces students to contemporary issues in health care policy. Topics will fall into three broad groups: (1) corporatization of health care providers and its effects on patients; (2) health insurance reform; and (3) government policy towards public health and disease, including HIV/AIDS, obesity, and mental health. Students will develop the ability to assess empirical evidence and use it to inform recommendations for potential corrective policy.\n\nInstructor(s): Brot-Goldberg, Z Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 38050\n\nPBPL 25550. Economic Development and Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThe course will introduce students to the main concepts in development economics, such as modern growth theories and their relevance for low-income countries, and major topics in policy and research within the field. In the first part of the course, we will concentrate on the development facts, the main explanations highlighted in the field of economics for differences in growth and income levels between rich and poor countries, and the concept and measurement of poverty. In the second part of the course we will study microeconomic fundamentals of economic development. We will concentrate on topics such as fertility, nutrition and health, education, labor markets, intra-household allocation of resources and infrastructure and the relation among them. Empirical evidence from developing economies will be employed extensively paying special attention to the methods used.\n\nInstructor(s): Menendez, A. Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nPBPL 25563. Does American Democracy Need Religion? 100 Units.\n\nIn the United States, we find ourselves living as part of a democracy. But that simple fact doesn't necessarily make us fans of democracy by default. In fact, it leaves many questions unanswered: Is democracy a good thing? If so, why and on what grounds? Why should you or I value democracy and its ideals (e.g., equality, liberty, fraternity)? If we do, what (if anything) grounds our devotion to this shared political tradition? And does, can, or should religion have a role to play? In this course, we will explore American democracy as a normative tradition and its relationship to various religious traditions in American society. Through examining key interpreters of American democracy such as Danielle Allen, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., Cornel West, Joshua Abraham Heschel, and Amanda Gorman, we will approach the question of how religion and democracy relate to one another. We'll investigate the relative independence of democracy and religion, focusing on philosophers and poets who emphasize American democracy as tradition in its own right. We will also consider \"Civil Religion in America,\" through the work of sociologists and historians who suggest the dependence of the democratic on religion or something like it. Finally, we'll question the relative interdependence of American democracy and religious traditions by turning to claims of influential religious and political leaders and activists. No prerequisite knowledge required.\n\nInstructor(s): Derek Buyan\n\nEquivalent Course(s): AMER 25563, RLST 25563, DEMS 25563, CRES 25563\n\nPBPL 25585. The Chinese Economy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course provides an overview of the Chinese economy, with two main focuses. First, we will review the significant reforms that happened in China in the past four decades, which fundamentally reshaped the modern China as we see today. Second, we will discuss some of China's key political and economic institutions, and their implications on China and the rest of the world. Throughout the course, special emphasis will be given to the role of the state in China's growth experience, at both the central- and local-levels.\n\nInstructor(s): Wang, S Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ECON 22030, PPHA 35585\n\nPBPL 25595. Power and \"Development\" 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers a perspective on the role of power in the evolution of societies. First, we will study narratives of political economy of development, dominant until recently, which draw on explanations for what made Europe, and parts of North America, exceptional, such as their innovation, trade, culture, or institutions. Second, we will explore research by historians, anthropologists, and sociologists that challenged these narratives on the grounds that they silenced the role played by European military domination over the rest of the world in the rise of Europe; the rise of the \"West\" coincides with the exceptional use of power at a global scale to expropriate, enslave, and even replace other societies whose welfare is not even part of current GDP calculations. Third, we will explore institutions, historical processes, worldviews, socio-political traditions, and ideas in societies outside the so-called West, and how those have contributed to the history of human societies but also to the set of possible ideas and models for \"development.\" One ambitious aim of the course is to make sense of how we got into the world of today while navigating this epistemic imbalance, beyond \"us\" vs. \"them,\" and through research and policies that do not carry the presumption of pitying, saving, or fixing as the main starting point. This course was previously name Political Economics of Developing Countries offered as PBPL 28776.\n\nInstructor(s): Sanchez de la Sierra, Raul Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 35556\n\nPBPL 25600. Why We Fight: The Roots of War and the Paths to Peace. 100 Units.\n\nMost countries in the world have been independent for about 50 years. Some are peaceful and have prospered, while some remain poor, war-torn, or both. What explains why some countries have succeeded while others remain poor, violent, and unequal? Moreover, fifty years on, a lot of smart people are genuinely surprised that these countries' leaders have not been able to make more progress in implementing good policies. If there are good examples to follow, why haven't more countries followed these examples into peace and prosperity? Finally, we see poverty and violence despite 50 years of outside intervention. Shouldn't foreign aid, democracy promotion, peacekeeping, and maybe even military intervention have promoted order and growth? If not why not, and what should we do about it as citizens? This class is going to try to demystify what's going on. There are good explanations for violence and disorder. There are some good reasons leaders don't make headway, bureaucrats seem slothful, and programs get perverted. The idea is to talk about the political, economic, and natural logics that lead to function and dysfunction.\n\nInstructor(s): Blattman, Chris Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PLSC 25601\n\nPBPL 25630. Poverty, Work, and Family Policy. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines contemporary policy questions regarding the dual spheres of work and family life, with a particular focus on economically impoverished families and communities. Students will analyze the relative merits of different policies designed to improve the conditions of work and family life and mitigate the effects of poverty on children's wellbeing. Throughout the ten-week quarter, we will consider demographic, labor market, and policy trends contributing to family poverty and income inequality in American society; interrogate policy debates concerning the responsibility of government, corporate, and informal sectors to address these critical social problems; and examine specific policy and program responses directed at (1) improving employment and economic outcomes and (2) reconciling the competing demands of employment and parenting. Although our primary focus will be on policies that promote the wellbeing of low-income families in the United States, relevant comparisons will be made cross-nationally, across race/ethnicity, and across income. This course is part of the Inequality, Social Problems, and Change minor.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CRES 25630, SSAD 25630\n\nPBPL 25640. Labor Markets: a Global Perspective. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we will explore standard models that form the core of labor economics including labor supply, labor demand, job search models, wage setting, discrimination, and migration. For each topic we will then examine empirical applications of these models with a focus on middle and low-income countries. We will discuss how these traditional models are useful, or not, in understanding labor market outcomes in these settings and how they can be expanded to better capture relevant features of labor markets outside high-income countries.\n\nInstructor(s): Lane, G Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 44302, ECON 14020\n\nPBPL 25663. Urban Studies: Placemaking. 100 Units.\n\nThis course considers the values that drive neighborhood transformation, how policy is shaped and implemented, and the role that arts and culture can play in mindful city-building. Classroom hours will be spent with Theaster Gates, professor, Department of Visual Art, in addition to other UChicago faculty, discussing key principles in guiding city redevelopment in mindful and equitable ways. Students will gain field experience working with Place Lab, Gates's multidisciplinary team that documents and demonstrates urban ethical redevelopment strategies initiated through arts and culture. Working across a variety of projects, students will be exposed to programming, data collection, development, community building, strategy, and documentation. Weekly site visits will give students the opportunity to see analogous projects and meet practitioners throughout Chicago.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTV 20663\n\nPBPL 25704. Environmental Justice in Chicago. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine the development of environmental justice theory and practice through social scientific and ethical literature about the subject as well as primary source accounts of environmental injustices. We will focus on environmental justice issues in Chicago including, but not limited to waste disposal, toxic air and water, the Chicago heat wave, and climate change. Particular attention will be paid to environmental racism and the often understudied role of religion in environmental justice theory and practice. Throughout the course we will explore how normative commitments are expressed in different types of literature as well as the basis for normative judgments and the types of authorities authors utilize and claim as they consider environmental justice.\n\nInstructor(s): Sarah Fredericks Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Graduate students can enroll with permission of instructor and will have additional requirements.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 25704, HMRT 25704, CHST 25704, KNOW 25704, AMER 25704, RLST 25704, RDIN 25704, ENST 25704\n\nPBPL 25834. Independence Movements. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will examine independence movements around the world. We will primarily focus on the politics of secession while also discussing its ethics, legality, economics, violence, and aftermath. Many different movements will be discussed including Scotland, Quebec, Northern Ireland, and South Sudan, although particular attention will be paid to Catalonia.\n\nInstructor(s): Anthony Fowler Terms Offered: Spring.

The Political Economy of Cities. 100 Units.\n\nThe course introduces students to the latest scholarship on the political economy of cities and metropolitan areas. We will focus on a few basic concepts of urban political economy (e.g., externalities, agglomeration, fragmentation, sorting), and explore how the interaction of economic forces and political institutions forms the foundation of many current policy challenges facing cities. We analyze the sources of urban growth, the institutions of local government and their role in the federal system, competition among cities, and the importance of real estate markets in shaping local politics.\n\nInstructor(s): Christopher Berry Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): Admission to Barcelona Pub Pol Program\n\nPBPL 25850. No Justice, No Speech! Free Speech and Palestine in the University and Beyond. 100 Units.\n\nAre there-or should there be-limits to free speech? What is the relationship between free speech and hate speech? Does speech deserve special kinds of protections (or limits) in the context of the university campus? In this course, we will critically engage with these questions as they relate to political organizing and political expression on (and in) Palestine. Our course will examine these foundational questions before turning to some of the sticking points in the debate over free speech and Palestine today: What is freedom of expression in Israel-Palestine, and what does it have to do with the politics of US campuses? What is BDS, and is it intended to foster or limit academic freedom? Is anti-Zionism anti-Semitic? To consider these questions, we will do critical readings of primary texts such as the BDS guidelines issued by PACBI (Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel) and the definition of anti-Semitism issued by the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance), as well as ethnographic and other accounts of the problem of political expression in Palestine today.\n\nInstructor(s): Callie Maidhof Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GLST 25850, LLSO 25850, NELC 25850, PARR 22100\n\nPBPL 26002. Urban Design Studio: Reconstructing Chicago's Lost Neighborhoods Using Machine Learning. 100 Units.\n\nThis course offers a hands-on learning experience in which students will digitally recreate the \"lost neighborhoods\" of Chicago using machine learning techniques. Students will be guided through the process of turning historical Sanborn maps into 3D models of historic urban neighborhoods. The creation of these historic urban models will be contextualized through archival research at the Chicago History Museum, as well as readings and lectures designed to advance student understanding of urban development within the historical context of U.S. cities in the 20th century, and Chicago specifically. Programming experience is helpful, but not required.\n\nInstructor(s): Talen, E Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): PPHA 36002, CHST 26002, SOSC 26002, ENST 26002, GEOG 24200\n\nPBPL 26005. Cities by Design. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the theory and practice of city design-how, throughout history, people have sought to mold and shape cities in pre-determined ways. The form of the city is the result of myriad factors, but in this course we will hone in on the purposeful act of designing cities according to normative thinking-ideas about how cities ought to be. Using examples from all time periods and places around the globe, we will examine how cities are purposefully designed and what impact those designs have had. Where and when has city design been successful, and where has it resulted in more harm than good?\n\nInstructor(s): Evan Carver Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GEOG 26005, ARCH 26005, ENST 26005\n\nPBPL 26021. Sense & Sensibility & Science @UChicago. 100 Units.\n\nIn Sense & Sensibility & Science, you will learn how to better incorporate into your thinking and decision making the problem-solving techniques of science at its best. Many insights and conceptual tools from scientific thinking are of great utility for solving problems in your own day-to-day life and in a democracy. Yet, as individuals, as groups, as whole societies we fail to take full advantage of these methods. The focus in this course is on the errors humans tend to make, and the approaches scientific methodology has developed (and continues to develop) to minimize those errors. The course includes a discussion of the nature of science, what makes science such an effective way of knowing, how both non-scientific thinking and scientific thinking can go awry, and how we can reason more clearly and successfully as individuals, as members of groups, and as citizens of a democracy. The undergraduate course will be simultaneously taught at UC Berkeley, Harvard and UChicago in spring 2024, with an opportunity for students from all three courses to participate remotely in the same deliberative polling capstone experience. UChicago's spring 2024 course premiere builds on a decade of experience developing and teaching the popular course at Berkeley and Harvard's adoption of its own version in 2021.\n\nInstructor(s): Reid Hastie, Jordan Kemp, Julia Koschinsky Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): PQ: Third or fourth-year standing.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIPS 26021, SCPD 26021, DIGS 26021, SOSC 26021, BPRO 26021\n\nPBPL 26080. The Challenge of Government Oversight. 100 Units.\n\nCan governments hold themselves accountable? How have they tried to do so, and with what results? Students will evaluate these questions by examining how different models of government oversight work in practice. The quarter will be split attention between federal and local government structures and oversight mechanisms. At the federal level, we will discuss special prosecutors, inspector general audits, models of judicial review and oversight, and the transformation of oversight institutions in the Trump era. At the local level, our focus will be on policing as a government function uniquely in need of effective oversight and uniquely difficult to oversee effectively. As a \"windows\" course, this course will ask students to engage in class discussions and written assignments with current, real-world challenges facing government oversight professionals.\n\nInstructor(s): Robert Owens Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): DEMS 26080\n\nPBPL 26255. Environmental Justice Field Research Project I. 100 Units.\n\nThis two-quarter sequence will expose students to real-world policy-making questions and field-based research methodologies to design an environmentally based research project, collect data, conduct analyses, and present findings. In the first quarter, we will follow a robust methodological training program in collaboration with University partners to advance the foundations laid elsewhere in the public policy studies program. In the second quarter, this expertise in a full range of research methodologies will be put into practice to tackle public policy problems in the city and neighborhoods that surround the University. PBPL 26255 and PBPL 26355 satisfy the Public Policy practicum Windows and Methods requirements.\n\nInstructor(s): Lodato, R.

Environmental Justice in Principle and Practice I. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will investigate the foundational texts on environmental justice as well as case studies, both in and out of Chicago. Students will consider issues across a wide spectrum of concerns, including toxics, lead in water, waste management, and access to greenspaces, particularly in urban areas. These topics will be taught in accompaniment with a broader understanding of how social change occurs, what barriers exist to producing just outcomes, and what practices have worked to overcome obstacles in the past. The class will welcome speakers from a variety of backgrounds to address their work on these topics.\n\nInstructor(s): Ray Lodato Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): This course counts towards the ENST 4th year Capstone requirement.

Environmental Justice in Principle and Practice II. 100 Units.\n\nIn this quarter, students will learn and practice methods to conduct a research project with a local environmental organization. Building on knowledge gained in the first half of this course, students will examine what makes a condition an environmental justice issue, how to conduct a literature review, how to develop and administer a questionnaire for key informant interviews, and how to access, understand, and utilize Census data. Students should expect to work in the community as well as the classroom, and in close collaboration with classmates. The class will conduct \"deep-dive\" research into the community selected, and will learn not only about the area, but techniques for how to do community-based research in a manner that acknowledges and appreciates the lived wisdom of the neighborhood's residents. The result will be a research report delivered to the community organization with students in the class listed as co-authors.\n\nInstructor(s): Ray Lodato Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CEGU 26261, CHST 26261, ENST 26261\n\nPBPL 26302. Public Policy Practicum: Interview Project on Gun Violence. 100 Units.\n\nThis one-quarter practicum in qualitative methods aims to develop interview research skills, including instrument design, questioning, transcription, thematic analysis, and write-up, in the context of a mini-BA thesis trial run. The topic of this version of the practicum is gun violence in Chicago. Students will engage in weekly in-class interviews with informants with wide-ranging vantage points on gun violence as a social and policy problem including community members, scholars, and policy-makers.
