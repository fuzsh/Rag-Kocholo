        "text": "I am having trouble finding out which visa I need for visiting the US headquarter of my new company.\n\nBackground: I'm starting as a software engineer in my European company. The employment is through a local PEO since the US company has no presence there yet. To get acquainted with the business, it'd make sense to go to the US and talk to the new colleagues as early as possible. On the other hand, I also don't want to be denied entry for obvious reasons.\n\nUK citizen, US company, living in UK: Can I use an ESTA? is the best discussion of this topic that I could find so far. However, it is from 2012 and @Doc was working for the local subsidiaries of much larger organizations. Would this still apply to my situation (PEO not subsidiary, new at the company, 2017)?\n\nThe documents I could find mostly mention that business meetings fall under the scope of ESTA. Training is also mentioned in many places but it is never clear what is allowed and what is not. Employer information bulletion 99-03 (unfortunately without date and official download) mentions that \"Alien trainees who seek merely to observe the conduct of business or other professional or vocational activity may qualify for B-1 or B-2 classification if the US business does not pay or reimburse expenses. The foreign employer must continue to be the principal employer and pay wages, salary, and/or other compensation from a source abroad.\" The document goes on to say \"Hands-on training, deigned to provide on-the-job experience, is not deemed to fall within the B-1 (or B-2) classification. Even if the foreign employers pays salary and expenses, B-1 classification is inappropriate if the hands-on services performed by the trainee will benefit the US-based company and/or the US-based company would have had to hire an employee but for the services of the alien 'trainee.'\" (emphasis mine)\n\nThe official flyer from 2015 does not mention training and mainly refers to the business visa center While I cannot find details at the BVC website either, this looks like the best authority to ask for clarification.\n\nThe official VWP page says that I may \"attend short-term training (you may not be paid by any source in the United States with the exception of expenses incidental to your stay)\" and \"consult with business associates\".\n\nQuestions:\n\nVWP is essentially the B1/B2 program for people from pre-approved countries, right? That means that there is no use in applying for B1 because I wouldn't be allowed to do more than on ESTA either, correct?\n\nDoes it make a substantial difference whether I come for 2 or 6 weeks? I'd argue that a shorter period may look more like discussions and meetings while a longer period would look more like employment.\n\nWhere does a PEO come in with regards to \"not being paid by any source in the United States\"? I feel like I could argue either way.\n\nIs there any way to get our plans pre-approved without a denial being treated as a \"visa rejection\" or even a \"refusal to enter\"?\n\nThank you for your help."
