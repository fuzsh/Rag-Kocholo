        "meta_description": "As the firm’s Patent Litigation Group Global Leader, Blair is first and foremost a nationally recognized trial attorney with extensive experience trying and winning cases in courts throughout the country. From his time in the Department of Justice forward, he has been sought out and has led teams in bet-the-company cases destined for trial from the outset.  Blair has also served as lead appellate counsel on several well-known, precedential opinions shaping patent law. His experience has earned him recognition as one of only a small handful of attorneys in the United States ranked at the highest levels by IAM for patent litigation regionally. He is also a Fellow of the Litigation Counsel of America, an honor limited to less than one-half of one percent of North American lawyers, judges and scholars.  Blair routinely handles high-stakes disputes in the most active patent forums including the District of Delaware, Eastern District of Texas, Western District of Texas, Eastern District of Virginia, and Northern and Central District of California, among others. After leading a series of trial teams in the District of Delaware, he was selected as one of the few outside counsel to serve as a member of that court’s Patent Study Group, created to advise on best practices in complex patent litigation.  Blair also has litigated extensively before the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), representing both complainants and respondents in Section 337 investigations involving a wide range of products and technologies. He has successfully handled numerous cases through trial and Commission review, and he has a deep understanding of the unique rules and practice in this forum as well as related proceedings before the Customs and Border Protection, the Federal Circuit, and the Court of International Trade.  Over more than three decades of practice, Blair has handled a myriad of patent competitor and trade secret cases and has resolved disputes across the gamut of contentious IP issues. He is often selected to lead teams in matters requiring the highest level of trial acumen and planning and prides himself in working collaboratively with in-house counsel on trial strategy from the outset. And when it comes to trial, Blair has led trial teams through multi-week jury trials on numerous occasions and this has provided unique insights on what it takes to win. According to IAM Patent 1000, he “creatively puts arguments together in a way that juries find entertaining – and persuasive.”  Blair frequently lectures and writes on trial tactics and trial advocacy, patent litigation strategies, practice before the ITC and Customs, strategies concerning allegations of trade secret misappropriation, appellate advocacy, and issues associated with complex trial strategy.  Prior to entering private practice, Blair served in the Army and then with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), where he acted as first-chair trial counsel in highly publicized civil cases brought against various agencies of the federal government. While at DOJ, he was selected to serve at the White House as counsel for the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board on investigations involving human rights issues and the intelligence community. He also served on the faculty of the Attorney General’s Advocacy Institute.",
