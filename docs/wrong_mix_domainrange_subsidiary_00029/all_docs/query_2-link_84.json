        "text": "Next gen radio delivers more transmit power, advanced security and communication options\n\nAtlanta, GA and Burlingame, CA /PRNewswire/ - Landis+Gyr and Sentient Energy announced the integration of Landis+Gyr's Network Node radio into the S610 Line Sensor developed by Sentient Energy, increasing the transmission range and edge computing capabilities of the device.\n\nLandis+Gyr's Network Node delivers greater transmission output and computing power than previous radio designs in a small, coin-sized package. At the same time, it supports multiple communication protocols, including IPv6 and advanced security. This makes it an excellent choice for integration into a vast array of grid devices where edge computing capabilities are required. Additionally, the power supply design of the radio allows the S610 to harvest operational energy from lower voltage lines, expanding deployment opportunities for utilities.\n\n\"The S610 is a key part of our connected platform of intelligent distribution devices and the Network Node's advance in integrated radio technology will bring value for any sensing application,\" said John Radgowski, Vice President of Solutions Product Management at Landis+Gyr. \"The ability to automate the flow of sensor data and enable remote decision-making is the backbone of our network platform.\"\n\nThe S610 Line Sensor is an intelligent fault sensor that further extends the distribution monitoring capabilities of Landis+Gyr's RF mesh network for distribution automation. It delivers fault location and accurate load logging from any point on the distribution network, improving visibility of distribution grid performance. The device is capable of sensing current, conductor temperature and voltage characteristics.\n\n\"The amount of data that S610 line sensors and analytics systems process is growing exponentially as the devices are becoming more intelligent,\" explains Sentient Energy CEO, Jim Keener. \"That means that more and more of the processing will have to be done on the device. The Network Node provides superior distributed processing and faster data communications necessary to make grid sensors and analytics more intelligent and efficient.\"\n\nSentient Energy line sensor deployments at leading U.S. utilities have demonstrated significant improvements in System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI).\n\nAbout Sentient Energy, Inc.\n\nSentient Energy makes power delivery safe, reliable and solar ready. We provide the industry's only Grid Analytics System that covers the entire distribution network with quickly deployed intelligent sensors and analytics that identify and analyze potential faults and other grid events. Sentient Energy leads the market with the largest mesh network line sensor deployments in North America, and partnerships with Landis+Gyr and other leading utility network providers.
