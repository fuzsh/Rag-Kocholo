        "text": "Historically, art has been for the wealthy. Only children from prosperous families could afford to study art, and only the most wealthy people could afford to buy it. Today, that legacy has only changed a little. Afterall, the ten most expensive colleges in the United States are schools for the arts.\n\nSentient's Mission is to put the legacy of art inaccessibility firmly in the past. Sentient works hard to make art education affordable and accessible. We are so grateful to our artist instructors who share our vision and have joined us to make this a reality.\n\nCo-Founder & CEO\n\nKeith Huang\n\nKeith lost his art school dream and a $300 non-refundable deposit when the school accidentally gave his scholarship to another student. He ended up going to a local State College. Although he acquired industry-relevant skills as the Art Student of the Year, without business knowledge, he failed to provide for his wife and baby boy. This ultimately led Huang to quit art professionally, get a business degree, and pursue a career in finance. After years away from the art world, he finally found himself in a position to make a difference and founded Sentient to pave the road for his 3 creative kids."
