        "text": "ACT Rules Community Group\n\nThe ACT Rules Community Group (previously known as Auto-WCAG), is an open forum set up to document and harmonise the interpretation of W3C accessibility standards, such as WCAG and WAI-ARIA, for testing purposes.\n\nThe ACT Rules Community Group (ACT-R) achieves this by bringing together the people developing, implementing and using various accessibility testing tools and methodologies to document interpretations as test rules. Test rules are defined using the ACT Rules Format, and reviewed by the community. The process of researching, documenting, and sharing knowledge from different perspectives within the group, builds towards a common understanding. Publishing rules is not an end point for harmonization, it's a starting point. By publishing such test rules, ACT-R hopes to motivate organisations to share their own insights, and encourage adoption of commonly agreed test rules.\n\nACT-R is not set up to remove differences or impose changes on accessibility testing tools and methodologies. There is value in innovation and diverse approaches. Rather it aims to contribute to more consistent results, regardless of how the testing is done. Knowing when something meets a requirement, and when it does not, should be clear and consistent.\n\nThis group will not publish specifications.\n\nAudiovisual Media Formats for Browsers Community Group\n\nOver the past decade, a growing number of sound and imaging media formats have been established offering increasingly sophisticated user experiences such as High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Spatial Audio. On the imaging side, these media formats provide the technical means to facilitate increased spatial and temporal resolutions, higher bit depths, as well as varying color volumes and the mapping between them. Similarly, on the audio side, higher bit-depth, sample rates and more immersive surround sound and speech processing options are available. These experiences are facilitated through tools and technical mechanisms available to both professional and consumer content providers and are readily available for linear content types. However, options to provide such experiences through the web are still limited as potential solutions are fragmented and often insular or significantly limited in capabilities among open source as well as proprietary options. This typically results in incorrect presentation to an end user or even error messages. Therefore, there is need to consider how to support modern audiovisual formats in a W3C context. To alleviate friction in development and deployment, it seems highly beneficial to our community to synchronize open and proprietary solutions so that they can co-exist within a W3C framework. The scope of this community group is to provide a forum for those discussions.\n\nEcosystem\n\nMedia & Entertainment\n\nCognitive Accessibility Community Group\n\nMission\n\nThe mission of the COGA Community Group is to work with and support the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility (COGA) Task Force to improve web accessibility for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.\n\nThis group supports the COGA Task Force by supplying user needs and feedback.\n\nScope\n\nThe COGA Community Group’s work will include:\n\n- Sharing challenges when using the web and other digital displays\n\n- Suggesting user needs\n\n- Helping with research\n\n- Suggesting ways to improve accessibility for the community\n\n- Reviewing COGA’s drafts\n\n- Outreach and collecting feedback from the community\n\n- Helping with policy and the business cases for COGA guidance\n\n- Having open meetings to discuss these points\n\nOpen meetings may be live video conferences or in other discussion formats\n\nParticipation\n\nYou do not need to be an expert in all topics related to cognitive accessibility to join the community group. The COGA Community Group will work in smaller groups for specific subjects, giving you the opportunity to participate on the topics you choose.\n\nThe COGA Community Group will also work together on some topics, brainstorming and building a community dedicated to improved access for all.\n\nAnyone can join this group as long as they follow the community guidelines.\n\nHowever, the community group will specifically benefit from including:\n\n- people with learning and cognitive disabilities,\n\npeople with mental health challenges,\n\n- caregivers, therapists and people who work with people with learning, cognitive challenges and in mental health,\n\n- researchers,\n\ndevelopers, quality assurance professionals, and user interface experts,\n\nindustry, looking to share and support ideas, and\n\npolicy makers.\n\nAdditional details of participation\n\n- Joining the COGA Community Group does not involve joining the COGA Task Force.\n\n- If you would prefer to join this group anonymously, please send an email to ran@w3.org.\n\n- The community group will not publish specifications, but may make suggestions to the COGA taskforce.\n\n- For more information about community groups, please visit Community and Business Groups Frequently Asked Questions.\n\n- Short link to this document: bit.ly/coga-community\n\nConsent Community Group\n\nThe concept of consent plays an essential role in the use of digital technologies as an enabler of the individual’s ownership, control, and agency. Regulations such as the GDPR assert this relationship by permitting use of consent as one of the possible legal bases for the lawful practice of data processing. Through this, obtaining consent is widely practised in the digital world, and can be perceived as an essential means to enable the individual’s agency regarding the management and ownership of their personal data. While different legal frameworks specify various requirements and obligations regarding the legal validity of consent, which should be, e.g. valid, freely given, specific, informed and active; existing and ongoing research shows that the majority of people are not empowered to practice their digital right to privacy and lawful \"consenting\" due to various malpractices and a lack of technological means acting in the individuals' interest. This group aims to contribute towards the empowerment of humans concerning their rights of privacy and agency, by advocating interdisciplinary, pluralist, human-centric approaches to digital consent that are technologically and legally enforceable. The mission of this group is to improve the experience of digital \"consenting\" while ensuring it remains adherent to relevant standards and laws. For this, the group will: (i) provide a space for people and stakeholders to come together (ii) highlight and analyse concepts, issues and problems about digital consenting (iii) propose and develop solutions. Some concrete areas for the working of this group are: (a) developing interdisciplinary solutions; (b) documenting and achieving legal compliance; (c) improving the user experience; and (d) utilising existing and developing new concepts and standards for digital consent.\n\nCredible Web Community Group\n\nThe mission of the W3C Credible Web Community Group is to help shift the Web toward more trustworthy content without increasing censorship or social division. We want users to be able to tell when content is reliable, accurate, and shared in good faith, and to help them steer away from deceptive content. At the same time, we affirm the need for users to find the content they want and to interact freely in the communities they choose. To balance any conflict between these goals, we are committed to providing technologies which keep end-users in control of their Web experience.\n\nThe group's primary strategy involves data sharing on the Web, in the style of schema.org, using existing W3C data standards like JSON-LD. We believe significant progress toward our goals can be reached by properly specifying \"credibility indicators\", a vocabulary/schema for data about content and the surrounding ecosystem, which can help a person and/or machine decide whether a content item should be trusted.\n\nPlease see the group wiki for more details.\n\nData Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group\n\nThe mission of the W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls CG (DPVCG) is to develop a taxonomy of privacy and data protection related terms, which include in particular terms from the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), such as a taxonomy of personal data as well as a classification of purposes (i.e., purposes for data collection), and events of disclosures, consent, and processing such personal data.\n\nThe DPVCG was created as an outcome of the W3C Workshop on Data Privacy Controls and Vocabularies in Vienna in 2017, and started on 25th May 2018 – the date of the enforcement of GDPR. Since then, the DPVCG has worked to fulfil its aims and objectives, and produced the Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) as a deliverable.\n\nMembership to the group is open to all interested individuals and organisations. To join the group, you need a valid W3C account – which is free to get and can be requested here. The group meets usually through online meeting calls, details of which, including past minutes, can be found here. The group also interacts through a mailing list regarding topics, discussions, sharing of agendas, actions, and other relevant items. The resources and work relevant to the group is hosted on the GitHub platform under the DPVCG name.\n\nThe group is currently chaired by:\n\nHarshvardhan J. Pandit (ADAPT SFI Research Centre, Trinity College Dublin)\n\nPreviously, it was chaired by:\n\nBert Bos (ERCIM W3C)\n\nAxel Polleres (WU Wirschaftsuniversitat Wien – Vienna University of Economics and Business)\n\nParticipation in Group Activities\n\nThe working of the group is fairly open and transparent in its process, with most of the information present on the wiki. For past work, actions, issues, and records – please refer to the wiki and threads on the mailing list. Anyone can use the mailing list to ask questions, suggest topics, raise issues, and offer solutions. Non-members might receive an automated reply asking them to authenticate their email or email address for posting.\n\nSimilarly, calls are usually open to attend, with the agenda shared on the public mailing list. Call details may be shared on the internal mailing lists accessible to only members for security purposes – so it may be best to ask the chair(s) or a member for attending a call.\n\nGeneral questions regarding what the group considers in scope can be determined from the aims and objectives. Specific queries or propositions should be conveyed to the mailing list. For issues regarding the DPV, including addition of concepts or a query or other relevant topics – you can use the mailing list or the issues feature in a GitHub repo.\n\nData Privacy Vocabulary (DPV)\n\nThe DPV is a vocabulary (terms) and an ontology (relationships) serialised using semantic-web standards to represent concepts associated with privacy and data protection, primarily derived from GDPR. It enables representation of which personal data categories are undergoing a what kind of processing by a specific data controller and/or transferred to some recipient for a particular purpose, based on a specific legal basis (e.g., consent, or other legal grounds such as legitimate interest, etc.), with specified technical and organisational measures and restrictions (e.g., storage locations and storage durations) in place.\n\nThe DPV is useful as a machine-readable representation of personal data processing and can be adopted in relevant use-cases such as legal compliance documentation and evaluation, policy specification, consent representation and requests, taxonomy of legal terms, and annotation of text and data.\n\nThe DPV is an evolving vocabulary – as the DPVCG continues to work on updating it with broader concepts as well as enriching its hierarchy of concepts. For this, we invite contributions of concepts, use-cases, requirements, and applications.\n\nHydra Community Group\n\nBuilding Web APIs seems still more an art than a science. How can we build APIs such that generic clients can easily use them? And how do we build those clients? Current APIs heavily rely on out-of-band information such as human-readable documentation and API-specific SDKs. However, this only allows for very simple and brittle clients that are hardcoded against specific APIs. Hydra, in contrast, is a set of technologies that allow to design APIs in a different manner, in a way that enables smarter clients.\n\nThe foundation is laid by the Hydra Core Vocabulary. It defines a number of fundamental concepts, such as hypermedia controls and collections, which allow machines to understand how to interact with an API. Since all information about the API is available in a machine-readable form, completely generic clients become possible. The Core Vocabulary is complemented by Linked Data Fragments, a set of specifications that enable advanced yet efficient client-side querying of Web APIs.\n\nMore information about these technologies can be found on our homepage: http://www.hydra-cg.com/\n\nLinked Building Data Community Group\n\nThis group brings together experts in the area of building information modelling (BIM) and Web of Data technologies to define existing and future use cases and requirements for linked data based applications across the life cycle of buildings. A list of recommended use cases will be produced by this community group.\n\nThe envisioned target beneficiaries of this group are both industrial and governmental organisations who use data from building information modelling applications and other data related to the building life cycle (sensor data, GIS data, material data, geographical data, and so forth) to achieve their business processes and whom will benefit from greater integration of data and interoperability between their data sets and the wider linked data communities. For example, benefit may be obtained by publishing and combining localised data on new cheaper building materials, energy efficient building devices and systems, along with real time data on weather patterns, energy prices and geodata. By making this data available to applications, they will be better able to support decision makers during the whole of the building life cycle, which includes design, construction, commissioning, operation, retrofitting/refurbishment/reconfiguration, demolition, and recycling of buildings.\n\nThe group will engage with these beneficiaries through surveys and events organised in conjunction with the affiliated workshop series on Linked Data for Architecture and Construction (LDAC).\n\nOntology-Lexica Community Group\n\nThe mission of the Ontology-Lexicon community group is to: (1) Develop models for the representation of lexica (and machine readable dictionaries) relative to ontologies. These lexicon models are intended to represent lexical entries containing information about how ontology elements (classes, properties, individuals etc.) are realized in multiple languages. In addition, the lexical entries contain appropriate linguistic (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) information that constrains the usage of the entry. (2) Demonstrate the added value of representing lexica on the Semantic Web, in particularly focusing on how the use of linked data principles can allow for the re-use of existing linguistic information from resource such as WordNet. (3) Provide best practices for the use of linguistic data categories in combination with lexica. (4) Demonstrate that the creation of such lexica in combination with the semantics contained in ontologies can improve the performance of NLP tools. (5) Bring together people working on standards for representing linguistic information (syntactic, morphological, semantic and pragmatic) building on existing initiatives, and identifying collaboration tracks for the future. (6) Cater for interoperability among existing models to represent and structure linguistic information. (7) Demonstrate the added value of applications relying on the use of the combination of lexica and ontologies.\n\nPermanent Identifier Community Group\n\nThe Permanent Identifier Community Group maintains a secure, permanent UL re-direction service for the Web located at w3id.org. Web applications that deal with Linked Data often need to specify and use URLs that are very stable. They utilize services such as the one run by this community to ensure that applications using their URLs will always be re-directed to a working website. The concept operates much like a switchboard, connecting requests for information with the true location of the information on the Web. Entries in the switchboard can be reconfigured to point to a new location if the old location stops working.\n\nThe community is responsible for all administrative tasks associated with operating the service. The social contract between organizations involved in the community gives each of them full access to all information required to maintain and operate the website. The agreement is setup such that a number of these organizations could fail, lose interest, or become unresponsive for long periods of time without negatively affecting the operation of the site.\n\nThe service operates in HTTPS-only mode to ensure end-to-end security. This means that it may be used for Linked Data applications that require high levels of security such as those found in the financial, medical, and public infrastructure sectors.\n\nAll identifiers associated with the service are intended to be around for as long as the Web is around. This means decades, if not centuries. If the final destination for popular identifiers used by this service fail in such a way as to be a major inconvenience or danger to the Web, the community will mirror the information for the popular identifier and setup a working redirect to restore service to the rest of the Web.\n\nYou may join this community by getting a W3C account and clicking the join button. If you wish to engage the community in discussion about this service for your Web application, please send an e-mail to the public-perma-id@w3.org mailing list.\n\nThis group does not create specifications.\n\nScreen Capture Community Group\n\nBackground\n\nScreen capture is useful in many contexts, such as when delivering presentations, collaborating with remote colleagues, or producing local recordings. The Web Platform offers APIs to that end, allowing Web applications to capture screens, windows or tabs, and allowing the captured media to be manipulated in various productive ways.\n\nThe popularity of these APIs, and the ubiquity of the applications that use them, are a testament to the importance of the work that has been done thus far.\n\nMission\n\nWe believe that there is yet more untapped potential in the realm of screen capture. It is our mission to innovate further and unblock additional novel uses of screen capture, creating new business opportunities for developers and enriching the lives of users.\n\nScope\n\nAs part of this charter, the Screen capture Community Group is focusing its activities on producing new screen capture APIs and extending existing ones. APIs directly involving screen capture are in scope, as are APIs that would typically be used in tandem with screen capture.\n\nWork mode\n\nThe group will conduct all of its technical work in public, on GitHub repositories, with a supporting mailing list for logistical and administrative purposes.\n\nMeetings will normally be public and open to anyone to join. Should the need arise, meetings may be restricted to Community Group participants and guests invited by the group chairs. In either case, a public summary or minutes will be made available publicly.\n\nAmendments to this charter\n\nThe group chairs can amend the charter.\n\nSemantic HTML-vocabulary Community Group\n\nThe mission of this community group is to establish a draft standard for a RDF-based representation of the HTML-vocabulary. With the HTML-vocabulary in RDF, any type of an HTML-document can be meaningfully represented, generated and validated using nothing but standard semantic technologies, without any vendor lock-in. In addition, full provenance can be provided for a generated HTML-document, as every atom of the document can be described and semantically enriched, ex ante (RDF) and ex post (Rdfa). For instance, the originating algorithm that calculates a certain budget amount in a governmental HTML-document can be linked to the table cell containing the very value. HTML-documents have a wide variety of use and so has the HTML vocabulary. The HTML-vocabulary can be used to generate 100% correct HTML or xHTML and to validate this. The HTML vocabulary can be used to model the front end of a website or application, whereas the logic behind the front end can be captured in SHACL Advanced Features, making for a full semantic representation and execution of digital infrastructure, without any vendor lock-in. An HTML-document can be generated with full compliance to laws and regulations, as these norms can be linked and applied while using the HTML-vocabulary. With full provenance, an HTML-document can battle fake news and show realtime how certain sensitive data in the document (privacy, security) was derived.\n\nThe community group will come up with a 0.1 draft specification. This will be input for a future working group within W3C. The community group can make use of the currently available draft specification as developed by the Dutch Ministry of Finance in a working prototype for the Dutch governmental budget cycle. By starting this community group, the Dutch Ministry wants to contribute to an open source based digital infrastructure.\n\nTalent Marketplace Signaling Community Group\n\nMuch is said about the mismatch between the needs of employers for qualified employee candidates and a pool of available candidates. One major factor contributing to this mismatch is the signaling between the demand-side (i.e., employers) and supply-side (i.e., education, training and credentialing providers, students and workers) of the talent pipeline. This mismatch frequently results in neither party coming into view of the other. The goal of the Talent Marketplace Signaling (TalentSignal) Community Group is to assist Schema.org in improving workforce signaling by refining existing schema.org types serving the talent pipeline and suggesting new types and properties where improved signaling cannot otherwise be achieved. Currently, workforce signaling sits at the intersection of a number of existing schema.org types: Course, JobPosting, Occupation, Organization, Person and the proposed EducationalOccupationalCredential.\n\nThe TalentSignal Community Group will focus initially on refinement of the JobPosting Schema and related types as it survey's specifications from domain entities such as HR Open Standards and PESC as well as the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation's Job Data Exchange (JDX) and T3 Innovation Network initiatives for better means to strong, more effective supply- and demand-side signaling.\n\nUpdate robots.txt standards Community Group\n\nRobots.txt is currently based on opting out of what you do not want your website to be a part of.\n\nThis is hard to maintain (almost a full time job right now) if you do not wish for your websites content to be applied for e.g. training AI, be a part of market research (e.g. price robots), to be a part of non-search engine databases and more.\n\nThis proposal is to update what type of instructions robots.txt should support to rather be treated as an opt-in, where you can give instructions based on intent of robots rather than a wildcard or in granular detail.\n\nExample: Agent-group: searchengines\n\nApplies to all robots that seeks to update, process or maintain websites for search engine databases. Does not grant permission to apply scraped data for AI purposes (this should have its own Agent-group).\n\nAlso, the absence of instructions should be treated as not having opted in, and for robots working on behalf of AI, there might need to be additional instructions (e.g. max-snippet and if you require a citation if your content is applied to provide an answer).\n\nVoice Interaction Community Group\n\nExisting W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input.\n\nMany of these new applications take the form of \"virtual assistants\". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion. Speech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.\n\nWeb Media Text Tracks Community Group\n\nThis group will work on text tracks for video on the Web, applied to captioning, subtitling and other purposes. This group plans to work initially on:\n\n1) Documenting a semantic model underlying the caption formats in use, notably TTML, CEA 608/708, EBU STL, and WebVTT.\n\n2) Creating a community specification for WebVTT.\n\n3) Defining the mappings between WebVTT and some selected formats, including at least TTML (W3C/SMPTE), and CEA 608/708.\n\n4) Creating web developer reference and tutorial material, including worked examples.\n\n5) Creating a test suite and/or tools.\n\nA possible transition to REC-track for some of these document(s) is envisaged and that possibility will be used to guide the work and procedures.\n\nThe group may produce recommendations for work in other groups, such as CSS, HTML5, and TTWG."
