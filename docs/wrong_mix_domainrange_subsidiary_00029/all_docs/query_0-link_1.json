In this paper we consider the question whether a distributed network of sensors and data processors can form ``perceptions`` based on sensory data. Because sensory data can have exponentially many explanations, the use of a central data processor to analyze the outputs from a large ensemble of sensors will in general introduce unacceptable latencies for responding to dangerous situations. A better idea is to use a distributed ``Helmholtz machine`` architecture in which the sensors are connected to a network of simple processors, and the collective state of the network as a whole provides an explanation for the sensory data. In general communication within such a network will require time division multiplexing, which opens the door to the possibility that with certain refinements to the Helmholtz machine architecture it may be possible to build sensor networks that exhibit a form of artificial consciousness.},\n\ndoi = {},\n\nurl = {https://www.osti.gov/biblio/293601}, journal = {},\n\nnumber = ,\n\nvolume = ,\n\nplace = {United States},\n\nyear = {Sun Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 1998},\n\nmonth = {Sun Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 1998}\n\n}"
