The plan is to design machine learning techniques that make effective use of sensor data to perform automated activity monitoring and prompting-based interventions that are beneficial for the residents as well as for their caregivers and family. The environment is human-centric because it learns information about its human residents and uses this information to provide activity-aware monitoring and intervention services. By transforming everyday environments into smart environments, many older adults with cognitive and physical impairment can lead independent lives in their own homes. A key component of this project is an evaluation of the technologies in actual homes with volunteer older adults and thus will assess the technologies for acceptance with the target population.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\n“Quality and Context-Aware Smart Healthcare,” N.

In the long-term, the state transition network of a GRN converges to a set of attractors that make the organism resilient to removal or functional impairment of genes. In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), such attractors refer to a group of sensors serving as sink nodes for packets sent over multiple hops. This project maps such attractor based genomic robustness onto WSNs to infer optimal topologies and routing strategies that mitigate both sensor failure and a noisy wireless channel. This is being achieved by conducting experiments in silico gene by simulating the functional removal of a gene from sample GRNs, to understand the dynamics of the attractor state space. This information is next used to design WSN topologies and routing protocols that are resilient to network uncertainty, node breakdown and compromise. This project also pursues the design of optimal wiring rules between sensors in a robust WSN that guarantees maximum probability of successful packet transmission under a given routing strategy. Validation and testing are accomplished on real life WSN testbeds.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\n“DRIH-MAC: A Distributed Receiver-Initiated Harvesting-aware MAC for Nano-Networks,” S. Mohrehkesh, M. Weigle, S.

The basic idea is to exploit graph sparsification techniques to divide the network into sparse subgraphs (certificates) that form the leaves of a sparsification tree. This innovative approach leads to the design and analysis of efficient parallel algorithms for updating dynamic networks, and reduction of memory latency associated with parallelizing unstructured data. Specifically, parallel algorithms will be designed for maintaining network topological characteristics and updating influential vertices and communities. The portability and performance of algorithms will be demonstrated via implementation on distributed memory clusters, shared memory multicores, and massively multithreaded parallel computers.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\n“PIS: A Multi-dimensional Routing Protocol for Socially-aware Networking,” F.
