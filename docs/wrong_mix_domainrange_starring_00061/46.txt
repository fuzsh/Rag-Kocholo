Career

Throughout the rest of the 90s, Peet shifted her focus towards a number of independent films. These included "One Fine Day" and "She's the One." While these films fell under the radar for the most part, they starred several notable actors, such as George Clooney, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jennifer Aniston, and Cameron Diaz.

Another major step forward for Amanda came in 2003 when she starred alongside Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson, and Keanu Reeves in the well-received romantic comedy "Something's Gotta Give." The film also performed well at the box office, generating $125 million in North America alone. That year, she also appeared in another critically-acclaimed film called "Identity." The psychological horror starred John Cusack and Ray Liotta. In 2004, Peet reprised her earlier role in the sequel "The Whole Ten Yards," but it proved to be a massive flop commercially and critically.
