Amanda Peet is an actress and vaccine ambassador for the United Nations. She is married to David Benioff, a screenwriter best known for co-creating HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones."

After studying at Columbia University, Peet began her acting career with small parts on television, and made her film debut in 1995's Animal Room. Her featured role in the 2000 comedy The Whole Nine Yards brought her wider recognition, and she has since appeared in a variety of films, including 2003's Something's Gotta Give, 2003's Identity, 2005's Syriana, 2008's The X Files: I want to Believe, 2009's 2012, and 2013's The Way, Way Back.

Peet has advocated on behalf of vaccines for children everywhere. After her youngest daughter contracted whooping cough, she became even more passionate about bringing vaccines to children throughout the globe.
