The production will use 35 spaces in Car Park 4 next to School Street (the northeast section of the lot), for box truck staging.\n\nIn addition, the studio will use 4 spaces in front of Sunshine Coffee Roasters on Purdy Ave. and 2 spaces in front of the Rye Metro Nails across the street. 4 spots on the west side of the coffee shop will be used to stage the shoot.\n\nRye police will be on-site to monitor traffic flow in the area.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nTV Series Starring Jon Hamm, Amanda Peet & Olivia Munn To Film In Rye\n\nJon Hamm Show Looks To Cast Teens For Filming In New Rochelle\n\nEarlier this year, in April, the Rye City Council approved the closure of the Highland parking lot on Monday, April 29, for Apple to film scenes for the same show, along with the use of parking spots on Purdy Ave. and Purchase St.\n\nAccording to Deadline, in the series mostly referred to as \"Your Friends And Neighbors,\" Jon Hamm stars as \"Coop, a recently divorced hedge fund manager who, after being fired, resorts to stealing from the wealthy residents in his tony upstate New York suburb in order to keep his family's lifestyle afloat.
