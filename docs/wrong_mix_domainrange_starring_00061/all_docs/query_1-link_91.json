        "text": "1) Changing Lanes (2002)\n\nEssential Credentials has always been kind to this eternally underappreciated drama. Props have already been given to stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson, and one day Sydney Pollack will be mentioned for his fine work in Changing Lanes. Now it is Amanda Peet’s turn and this film was chosen because she absolutely chews up scenery in a riveting bit of acting when she confronts her husband (Affleck) in a restaurant and pretty much tells him how it is, and how it will be. The scene alone should have gotten Peet a Best Supporting Actress nomination that year at the Oscars (because it probably would have back in the ‘70s.)\n\n2) A Lot Like Love (2005)\n\nThis romantic comedy tops the indie comedy Igby Goes Down because Peet’s overall performance may not be on the same level as Igby’s, but her presence is as a female lead. She and co-star Ashton Kutcher have nearly perfect chemistry and keep this movie afloat by carrying scenes with genuine interaction as opposed to recited dialogue and affectionate glances. Peet plays the love interest role so naturally in this movie (which spans years in the lives of its characters) that it’s almost frighteningly real.\n\n3) Igby Goes Down (2002)\n\nNow we get to this one, a movie that not too many people have seen. Watch it. Peet got some well deserved raves and has quite interesting fling with Macaulay Culkin’s little brother if that interests you.\n\n4) Syriana (2005)\n\nAs Matt Damon’s grieving wife, Peet takes full advantage of her screen time with a performance that lends some domestic depth to this layered film that shuffles between people, and places, affected by the oil crisis in the Middle East. Particularly moving is her final confrontation on screen with Damon as their eyes meet from across the living room of their home after one of them has been through quite a lot in the past few days.\n\n5) Identity (2003)\n\nA particular comedy starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry was overlooked in favor of this ensemble thriller set in a motel. As the cast is killed off one by one, tension and mystery starts to mount as everyone is dead set on surviving and figuring out what the fuck is going on. Peet’s solid in the cast and is fortunate enough to last long enough to make an impact and keep on pace with heavyweights like Ray Liotta and John Cusack.\n\nTune in next week for more Essential Credentials, yet another ongoing saga brought to you by southcoast247.com.
