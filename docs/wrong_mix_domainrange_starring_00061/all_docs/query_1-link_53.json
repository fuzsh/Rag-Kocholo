        "text": "Amanda Peet is an actress and vaccine ambassador for the United Nations. She is married to David Benioff, a screenwriter best known for co-creating HBO's hit series \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nAfter studying at Columbia University, Peet began her acting career with small parts on television, and made her film debut in 1995's Animal Room. Her featured role in the 2000 comedy The Whole Nine Yards brought her wider recognition, and she has since appeared in a variety of films, including 2003's Something's Gotta Give, 2003's Identity, 2005's Syriana, 2008's The X Files: I want to Believe, 2009's 2012, and 2013's The Way, Way Back. On television, Peet has starred in \"Jack & Jill\" (1999–2001), \"Togetherness\" (2015–2016), \"Brockmire\" (2016–2020), and the second season of \"Dirty John\" in 2020.\n\nPeet has advocated on behalf of vaccines for children everywhere. After her youngest daughter contracted whooping cough, she became even more passionate about bringing vaccines to children throughout the globe.\n\nPeet is also an author, having published a children's book, \"Dear Santa, Love, Rachel Rosenstein,\" about a Jewish girl during the Christmas season in 2015. Peet is also a playwright: her play \"Our Very Own Carlin McCullough\" ran for two months in 2018 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles to positive reviews.\n\nThere’s no doubt that Peet nows all about putting your talent, your passions, and your personal life out on public view, and she knows it requires courage and commitment. She also knows first hand that life as a working actor and a mother requires balance, resilience, and determination. Through balancing family and work, she’s found that bringing these passions and platforms together can create compelling content, a full life, and a changed world. Her life experiences have come together to a place where she can do what she loves and make the world better at the same time. Peet has been an Ambassador for Every Child By Two for several years and has supported the Shot@Life campaign since its launch in 2012."
