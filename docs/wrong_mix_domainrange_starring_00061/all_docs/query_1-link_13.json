        "text": "Amanda Peet is attracted to good writing—and, thankfully, she can afford to be picky. “Because of Game of Thrones”—the monster hit her husband, David Benioff, cocreated— “I am able to say no to some of the lousy writing,” she says. But the new Paramount+ limited series Fatal Attraction, a remake of the iconic 1987 psychological thriller, presented an irresistible package: Great scripts, from a writer she had previously collaborated with, and a chance to work with two of her biggest crushes in costars Joshua Jackson and Lizzy Caplan.\n\nWhile Jackson and Caplan take on the lead roles that Michael Douglas and Glenn Close memorably played in the film, Peet stars as Beth Gallagher, whose world is shattered when her husband, Dan (Jackson), has an affair with a colleague (Caplan’s Alex Forrest). Anne Archer was Oscar-nominated for her performance as Beth—but with more real estate and a 2023 outlook, Peet and showrunner Alexandra Cunningham (Dirty John) expanded Beth’s presence, showing more of the story from her point of view. With the series jumping between two timelines, Beth deals both with the immediate impact and fallout of Dan’s actions, as well as his eventual reentry into her life and that of their adult daughter.\n\n“The movie’s so brilliant, but there just isn’t enough time,” Peet tells Vanity Fair. “And, because it’s 1987, we’re going to be in the perspective of the middle-aged white man. So it felt like there’s a huge opportunity here, and Alexandra was interested in having Beth be a bit more than just a lovely homemaker.”\n\nAhead of the first three episodes of Fatal Attraction dropping Sunday on Paramount+, we spoke with Peet about being obsessed with Jackson and Caplan, feeling grateful for Bruce Willis, and our love of her short-lived 2012 sitcom Bent.\n\nVanity Fair: What are your memories of first seeing Fatal Attraction?\n\nAmanda Peet: I saw it on 19th Street and Broadway, opening weekend, packed theater. I went with a girlfriend and her boyfriend, and he fainted on the way out, which made us think that he might have cheated on her. But he hadn't; he was just a sensitive soul.\n\nFrom your view, why was Fatal Attraction ripe for a new, updated version?\n\nI had worked with Alexandra [on Dirty John], and I love her and her writing. For my generation, Glenn Close's character became a joke. Like, if you were dating somebody and that person became super clingy or seemed a little too eager, you'd be like, \"Oh, be careful or she'll boil your bunny!\" And despite Glenn Close's insanely nuanced, masterful performance, it just wasn't enough screen time or character development for you to sympathize with her. So that's what Alexandra wanted to play with. And, also, Dan's accountability, which was non-existent.\n\nWhat was like working with Josh to explore this complicated dynamic and marriage?\n\nJust a total delight. I had a crush on him before, and now I feel like I have a talent crush on him. And a crush on him! It's not like he got less attractive. He's the real deal. He can play anything; he can be a monster, he can be so winsome and adorable. I'm blown away by his performance. And then he's also really lovely to work with. Being famous for that long, you’d think you would end up being an arrogant schmuck, but he isn't. He's very self-deprecating and goofy and generous and thoughtful to other people on set.\n\nYou being paired up with Josh got me thinking about your interesting résumé of onscreen romantic interests, which includes Bruce Willis, Jason Biggs, Jack Nicholson, Jason Bateman, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. And somehow you’ve managed to have chemistry with all of them! What do you attribute that to?\n\nI think I've been really lucky. Bruce Willis [in 2000’s The Whole Nine Yards] was my first break. I remember we had callbacks and there were probably about 20 actresses there, and we were all lined up outside to read with Bruce Willis. It was so scary, but he was just so fun. He was so flirty, so present, and just started improvising with me. And he picked me! So I feel very sentimental about Bruce right now. Because I was nobody. I was just some rando. Like, I showed up for my callback and he was like, \"That girl.\" And then I was like, \"Okay, I'll do it, but I'm not going to take my clothes off,\" and they were like, \"Okay, bye!\" I was like, \"Wait! Okay, fine, I'll take my top off,” and they were like, \"Bye!\" I was like, \"Okay, fine, I'll take my undies off too!\" It was a different era.\n\n“But, if there ends up being a sequel, that’s gonna be a no!”\n\nExactly! The sequel, I was like, “I'm going to put my foot down now that you've seen my entire…”\n\nThere’s only a couple scenes where you get to act opposite Lizzy, but they’re all electric. Did you have those days circled on your calendar?\n\nI did, because I love her! I'm obsessed with Party Down. It was one of those things where you like someone’s character too much, so it was weird for me to see her in real life. Because of Party Down, I had to quickly just get rid of all that backstory in my head.\n\nWhat was it like simultaneously playing this woman at two very different stages of her life?\n\nWell, what was really depressing is that Josh had to have old age makeup added and I just had to show up. Because I’m older than he is, I actually have the wrinkles that they tried to put on him. And so, mentally, that was kind of a bummer for me. [Laughs.]\n\nAt this point of your career, what are you looking for in projects and characters?\n\nNow that I have a family and my husband has a career, we try to have one of us home as much as possible. But I think the thing that really just gets me going is good writing. And then the hope that I won't suck. Twenty-five years ago, the actor Josh Hamilton and I were talking about acting or something, and he was like, \"God, it's just really hard not to suck,\" and I feel that way before every take—and after every take. I'm still trying to be real in front of the camera and for it to seem like it's happening for the first and only time, and, weirdly, it’s really hard to do.\n\nOver the last decade, it seems like you’ve found a consistent home on TV without having to commit to some series that might run for like seven seasons.\n\nTrust me, I would commit to a seven season series. I just haven't been offered one. [Laughs.]\n\nOkay, never mind. Amanda Peet is open for business!\n\nThere's very little good writing coming my way, and because of Game of Thrones, I am able to say no to some of the lousy writing and stay with my kids and write. I actually wear a necklace that has a charm for Belfast, which is where Game of Thrones was shot, and it’s a city that I'm in love with and count as a home of sorts. So I wear it around my neck to always remind myself that what happened to us is bananas.\n\nSpeaking of Game of Thrones: your husband was an executive producer on the Netflix series that you wrote and co-created, The Chair.\n\nHe didn't do shit! Dead weight!\n\nJust a producer in name, good to know. But have you guys talked about writing something together, or maybe him writing something for you?"
