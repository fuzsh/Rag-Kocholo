        "text": "By Mick La Salle San Francisco Chronicle\n\nREVIEW **1/2 out of ****\n\n‘Please Give’\n\nRated: R (language, sexual situations)\n\nRunning time: 1:30\n\nDirector: Nicole Holofcener\n\nCast: Catherine Keener, Amanda Peet, Rebecca Hall, Ann Guilbert, Oliver Platt\n\nShowing: Lynwood (Bainbridge Island)\n\nThough I wish “Please Give” were a little better, there aren’t enough American movies like it. Written and directed by Nicole Holofcener, it contains five vivid women’s roles and deals with normal life, with how people live, think and feel, as opposed to what most movies do, which is show how people react in a crisis.\n\nHolofcener takes a set of themes — privilege and guilt and the need to give and receive generosity — and explores them through the lives of a half dozen characters who intersect in modern-day Manhattan. With an approach like that, a film either coalesces into something larger and more meaningful, bigger than the sum of its parts, or it remains pleasing in spurts. “Please Give” is in the latter category — it’s a likable, intelligent film that, in the end, doesn’t fully arrive.\n\nThis is said reluctantly. In Europe, where personal women’s films are common, “Please Give” would be a pigeon. Here it’s a whooping crane, and there’s an argument to be made that an OK-not-bad whooping crane is in itself worth seeing. I wouldn’t make that argument, but I would happily watch a new Nicole Holofcener movie every month or so, because I enjoy her world and the people in it.\n\nOne person always in Holofcener’s world is Catherine Keener, as the face of sensitive, confused humanity wondering about her place in the moral universe. In “Please Give,” she and her husband (Oliver Platt) own an antique furniture shop, for which they acquire pieces by buying them from adult children liquidating their parents’ estates. Like everybody in business, she buys for as little as she can and sells for as much as she can get away with. A little over a year ago, people stopped doing that, and the economy nearly collapsed.\n\nBut still, Kate (Keener) feels guilty about this, as well as guilty about having a fairly prosperous upper-middle-class existence when other people are homeless. What’s really happening is that suddenly, in midlife, Kate finds herself plugged into the suffering of the universe. This can happen. So she starts handing out 20s to panhandlers and reaching out to her neighbor, Rebecca (Rebecca Hall), a socially withdrawn X-ray technician who does mammograms for a living.\n\nRebecca is another downbeat, sad-sack character, a young woman who slaves for her grandmother, a bitter old lady who was once a nasty middle-aged lady and before that an equally awful young lady, played by Ann Guilbert (Millie from the old “Dick Van Dyke Show”). In this hangdog mix, Amanda Peet, as Rebecca’s older sister, is like a breath of fresh air — spontaneous, confident, the enemy of guilt and introspection, determined to break free of the past and live her life.\n\nIn a way, Peet plays the most interesting character, the one who shows that living in reaction to the past is just another form of being imprisoned by it. But Holofcener has a knife out for her. Holofcener seems to prefer her more indecisive creations, as though feeling guilty or lost were not just evidence of potential virtue but virtuous acts in themselves.\n\nThis is where “Please Give” becomes less than satisfying. Holofcener asks moral questions and then is too easy on her characters, too taken in by gestures and too appalled by surface attitude to demand anything more than benign posturing. Though she calls the movie “Please Give,” Holofcener demands only easy giving, and the film’s conclusion — in which a surrender to crass commercialism is offered as a moment of spiritual bliss — shows a filmmaker who has tied herself into an intellectual knot. Far from challenging, the film consoles the complacent, saying basically that you can do whatever you want, so long as you feel (or pretend to feel) a little guilty about it."
