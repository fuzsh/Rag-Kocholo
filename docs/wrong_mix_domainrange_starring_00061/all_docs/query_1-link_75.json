        "text": "Hallie Rich, Jul 01, 2024\n\nAs library leaders contemplate retirement, are their libraries—and the next generation of leaders—ready for the change?\n\nElisa Shoenberger, Jun 26, 2024\n\nOn November 2, 1929, at Curtiss Airfield in Valley Stream, NY, 26 female licensed pilots, mostly from the East Coast, gathered to form the Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to support and advance women in aviation. Famed aviator Amelia Earhart, the first president of the Ninety-Nines, came up with the name in honor of the 99 charter members. Almost 95 years since its founding, the Ninety-Nines has about 7,000 members in 44 countries.\n\nHallie Rich, Jul 01, 2024\n\nFrankly, I should have seen it coming, but personal growth and change can be so subtle that you sometimes don’t realize you’re doing it until you’ve done it. When I literally squealed with delight upon discovering “Gardening with Monty Don” on the Hoopla BingePass at PLA 2024, it dawned on me that I was no longer someone who just liked plants...I’d become a gardener.\n\nLisa Peet, Jun 27, 2024\n\nOn Thursday, June 27, at the American Library Association Annual Conference and Exhibition in San Diego, CA, the Institute of Museum and Library Services announced the launch of its nationwide Information Literacy Initiative. The multipartner project provides a website, InformationLiteracy.gov, that offers a wide range of ready-to-use tools and resources for library and museum professionals—trusted educators—to engage their communities to find, understand, evaluate, and share accurate information.\n\nBarbara Hoffert, Feb 04, 2021\n\nCOVID shifts drove falling print circ and rising ebooks. But will it last? LJ's 2021 Materials Survey looks at some of the last year's trends.\n\nKeith Curry Lance, Dec 21, 2020\n\nThis is the 13th year of the LJ Index of Public Library Service and Star Library ratings. The 2020 scores and ratings are based on FY18 data from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Public Library Survey (PLS). Because of that delay, they don’t reflect the impact of the coronavirus; that won’t be reflected in the data until 2022. The big news in this year’s edition is that successful retrievals of electronic information (e-retrievals)—measuring usage of online content, such as databases, other than by title checkout—joins the six other measures that determine the LJ Index.\n\nMahnaz Dar, Nov 10, 2020\n\nWhether librarians are providing services in-person or virtually, reference has changed with the pandemic.\n\nSuzie Allard, Oct 15, 2020\n\nLibrary Journal’s annual Placements & Salaries survey reports on the experiences of LIS students who graduated and sought their first librarian jobs in the previous year: in this case, 2019. Salaries and full-time employment are up, but so are unemployment and the gender gap; 2019 graduates faced a mixed job market even before the pandemic.\n\nLisa Peet, Feb 09, 2021\n\nWhen the long-awaited COVID-19 vaccines began to roll out in mid-December 2020, their distribution was immediately complicated by a shortage of doses and widespread uncertainty about who would be given priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued suggested guidelines for phased allocation. When it was not yet clear who would be next, many library workers, leaders, and associations began advocating for public facing library workers to be vaccinated as soon as feasible.\n\nErica Freudenberger, Feb 02, 2021\n\nIn the messy middle of the pandemic, library leaders share how things have changed since March 2020, their takeways, and continuing challenges.\n\nMahnaz Dar, Nov 10, 2020\n\nWhether librarians are providing services in-person or virtually, reference has changed with the pandemic.\n\nLJ Reviews, Oct 14, 2020\n\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of books on the subject has been increasing exponentially. This introductory list, which will be updated regularly, is meant to help collection development librarians get started on determining which books work best for their collections.\n\nThank you for visiting.\n\nMost LJ reviews are exclusive to subscribers.\n\nAs a subscriber, you'll receive unlimited access to all reviews dating back to 2010.\n\nTo access other site content, visit our homepage.\n\nAlready a subscriber?
