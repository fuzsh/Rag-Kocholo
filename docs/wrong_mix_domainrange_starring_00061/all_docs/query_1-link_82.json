        "text": "Movie and television production sets can be dangerous places, for others in addition to crew and stunt performers. Actors also can find themselves in harm’s way, often in an unexpected fashion. Actress Amanda Peet recently found this out the hard way, as she recently revealed she was injured while on the set of her new IFC show Brockmire.\n\nIn an interview on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” Ms. Peet revealed the show had to shut down production because of an accident involving a beer can. “I was really cocky. It was like a Tom Cruise thing. I wanted do my own thing with a full beer can,” she said.\n\nThe scene involved Peet’s character catching a beer in her left hand, stabbing it open, and drinking it shotgun-style in one motion. She insisted on doing the scene on her own in one take with a real beer can, but things went south when they attempted the stunt. Peet failed to catch the can in her left hand; instead, the beer can hit her in the forehead. As a result of the accident, the show ceased production for a month to allow her to recover.\n\nEven for stars, there are risks on sets, and, for this reason, many actors have stunt doubles to perform stunts like this, even though they may seem harmless at first.\n\nIf you have been injured on the set of a film, television, or web production, it’s important that you seek counsel from an actor injury lawyer as soon as possible.\n\nAt Plotkin, Vincent, & Jaffe, LLC, we are dedicated allies for actors and stunt performers who are injured on set. We are experienced with litigation involving on-set injuries. We are familiar with insurance coverage issues that can make these claims difficult, and we have a track record of helping our clients obtain the compensation they deserve.
