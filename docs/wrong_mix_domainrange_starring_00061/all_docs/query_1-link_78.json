(McKay, Ferrell, and Elbaum produced Headland’s previous feature, Bachelorette.)\n\nSKE is financing the comedy, which will shoot in New York in June.\n\nPeet most recently appeared in The Way Way Back alongside Steve Carell and Toni Collette for Fox Searchlight.\n\nMantzoukas, who stars on the hit FX comedy The League, can be seen in the Seth Rogen-Zac Efron hit Neighbors.\n\nLyonne currently stars in the critically acclaimed Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black."
