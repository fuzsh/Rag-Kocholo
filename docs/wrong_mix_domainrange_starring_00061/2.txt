Amanda Peet, Jason Mantzoukas and Natasha Lyonne are joining the cast of Sleeping With Other People, Sidney Kimmel’s romantic comedy written and to be directed by Leslye Headland.

The ensemble cast already includes Jason Sudeikis, Alison Brie, and Adam Scott.

IM Global is selling international rights for the film in Cannes.

SKE describes the project as an “edgy romantic comedy about a womanizer named Jake (Sudeikis) and a serial cheater (Brie) who form a platonic relationship to overcome their chronic infidelity in this witty, contemporary take on modern dating — in the vein of When Harry Met Sally … but with assholes.”

Kimmel will produce along with Adam McKay, Will Ferrell and Jessica Elbaum of Gloria Sanchez Productions. (McKay, Ferrell, and Elbaum produced Headland’s previous feature, Bachelorette.)

SKE is financing the comedy, which will shoot in New York in June.

Peet most recently appeared in The Way Way Back alongside Steve Carell and Toni Collette for Fox Searchlight.

Mantzoukas, who stars on the hit FX comedy The League, can be seen in the Seth Rogen-Zac Efron hit Neighbors.

Lyonne currently stars in the critically acclaimed Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black.
