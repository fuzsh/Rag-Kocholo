        "text": "Carlton has stormed back in the second half for its first win of the AFL season, beating St Kilda by 40 points in Wellington.\n\nLachie Henderson and Tom Bell stood up in attack for the Blues, who won the league's opening match on Anzac Day 18.13 (121) to 12.9 (81).\n\nCaptain Marc Murphy was also outstanding in the midfield, despite heavy tagging attention.\n\nMurphy won the inaugural Crowl-McDonald Medal as best afield.\n\nThe medal was named St Kilda's Claude Crowl and Carlton's Fen McDonald, who made their senior debuts against each other in 1911 and died on April 25 at Gallipoli.\n\nHenderson kicked five goals and Bell's four goals in the second half were crucial as Carlton made their comeback.\n\nOnly 12,125 fans attended the game, the lowest attendance at the Cake Tin since the Saints started hosting Anzac Day games there two years ago.\n\nOfficials are about to start a review of the five-year Wellington deal.\n\nThe Saints are yet to win in their New Zealand campaign.\n\nIt was a crucial win for the Blues, who are recovering from a poor start to the season and plenty of media attention.\n\nCarlton's Mick Malthouse also coached his 414th game, officially equalling Jock McHale's AFL record.\n\nThe Blues were down by 25 points at quarter time and 26 midway through the second term.\n\nBut they had reduced the margin to 13 points at the main break.\n\nThey doubled their score in the third term, kicking six goals to two and taking the lead for the first time.\n\nCarlton's onballer David Ellard was forced off in the last term under the blood rule after a heavy collision."
