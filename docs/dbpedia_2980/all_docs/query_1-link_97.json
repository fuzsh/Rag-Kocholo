        "text": "All witnesses agreed that the remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun were taken to the garden of the Chancellery, sprinkled with essences, and were incinerated. To question Hitler's suicide is not the subject of debate in this book. I assert as a lawyer, coupled with my experience as a career judge, to say that the investigation on the crimes committed by the Nazis during the Nuremberg trial, which resulted in the judgment of twenty-four senior Nazi officers before the military tribunal of Nuremberg, did not meet all elements of evidence of Hitler's death. Even in the case of a cripple who doubted in the death of the German dictator - we had enough at the time of the trial - Hitler should be tried in absentia at Nuremberg. This book aims to correct the deficiencies committed in Nuremberg where the name of Hitler does not appear in the list of the accused. Thus, in carrying out Hitler's fictitious judgment in absentia, the aim is to show how the initial Nuremberg judgment prevented humanity from knowing the whole truth about the material and intellectual authors of the Second World War, a plot fomented by the economic, political, religious, and financial powers hidden behind Hitler, who used his charisma, and his demonic nature, to start the war and lead humanity to disaster. Thus, since the immediate fallout of the Nuremberg trial was to impose the victor's law on the vanquished, and not to repair the social injustices and the damage done to humanity by the Nazi madness, we open the first chapter of the book on a contextualization of this trial conveying the benefits of a trial in absentia of Adolf Hitler, which would have seized the assets of the dictator and also pursued his accomplices. To do this, we will proceed to the historicity of the Nazi regime by developing the march into the political power of Hitler to lead to its advance to the war. ___________________________________________________________________ Hirohito: Guilty or Innocent: The Trial of the Emperor The book opens the debate on Hirohito's responsibility during World War II with a posthumous trial against the Japanese emperor before the Permanent People's Court for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It provides an understanding of the atrocities of the Japanese army and navy during World War Ii, particularly the crimes of Unit 731.\n\nEmperor Hirohito's Accountability \"It's a mistake to regard the trend in the world at large as a movement toward individualism… Democracy in Europe and the United States is an outgrowth of individualism in the past. But how do you regard the enactment of the prohibition law in the United States? As individualistic? How do you account for the fact that men in England died for their nation in great herds during the last world war? Emperor Hirohito Before commencing research I assumed that Japanese aggression did not begin in earnest until Pearl Harbor, that the U.S. bore the brunt of fighting against Japan, and that Emperor Hirohito (retrospectively known as Emperor Showa) was a figurehead rulerlike Britain's King George VI-who didn't directly impact foreign policy. These uninformed impressions all proved erroneous. Japanese imperialism started with the Kwantung Army's invasion of Manchuria in May, 1928. Japan waged a devastating war against China between1928 and 1945. The Japanese military machine killed nearly three times more civilians than Chinese Army regulars. That sobering statistic puts the situation in perspective:"
