        "text": "A rusted bayonet recovered from the fields of France sticks out as unusual amongst decades' worth of priceless St Kilda memorabilia.\n\nBut it is perhaps one of the more pertinent treasures belonging to the St Kilda Heritage Museum, gifted to the club by the Mayor of Pozières in 2014 in recognition of two former Saints who never made it home.\n\nThe footballing careers of John (Jack) P. Walker and Jim Farnan didn't overlap.\n\nFarnan played one senior game for the Saints in 1899, while Walker played four games over a decade later.\n\nFarnan grew up in South Melbourne and was 40 years old when he enlisted in 1915; Walker, a Moorabbin boy, was just 22.\n\nIt's unlikely the pair ever actually met, but their joint sacrifice in the name of their country means their stories are now intertwined forever.\n\nMembers of the 8th and 46th Australian Infantry Battalions respectively, Sergeant Walker and Private Farnan's military service coincides when both Battalions were called up to join the fighting at Pozières.\n\nOne of the major combats in the infamous 1916 Battle of the Somme, it heralded the start of one of the deadliest single conflicts for Australian soldiers to date.\n\nThe Battle of Pozières took place at the small French village of the same name and the surrounding ridge, a place which has been described by renowned Australian historian Charles Bean as “more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth”.\n\nAnd it was in this unimaginably brutal battle where Sergeant Jack Walker and Private James Farnan would lay down their lives for their country.\n\nThey were killed less than two weeks apart.\n\nHONOUR ROLL: Saints to Soldiers\n\nWalker’s final resting place is not known, and he is commemorated at Villers-Brettonneux, while Farnan is buried at the Pozières British Cemetery in France.\n\nTheir names are commemorated at the Australian War Memorial and RSEA Park in Moorabbin.\n\nThis Remembrance Day, we remember Jack, Jim and the other 23 Saints who gave up their lives so that we may continue to live ours freely, and we pay our respects to the 286 ex-St Kilda footballers who served in the two world wars.\n\nSt Kilda Football Club Honour Roll"
