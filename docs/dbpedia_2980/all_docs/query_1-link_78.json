        "text": "Collingwood once again showed their modern-day dominance of Anzac Day football, earning a tough 20-point win over Essendon.\n\nNathan Buckley’s side won their fifth Anzac Day contest in six years, triumphing 9.15 (69) to 6.13 (49) on a wet MCG. Rain through the morning ensured a scrappy contest, which finished with almost twice as many behinds as goals.\n\nLed by Anzac Day medallist Paul Seedsman, who kicked the Magpies inside 50 a remarkable 14 times and charged into every contest, Collingwood prevailed.\n\nMedal judges had a pack of Magpies to pick from, with Jack Crisp, Taylor Adams, Jamie Elliot and their entire back line all making strong contributions.\n\nCollingwood’s win was earned through effort rather than statistical domination.\n\nThe Bombers set themselves to play uncontested football, chipping and marking their way across the MCG. In contrast, Collingwood set themselves for a scrap, often kicking long to contests and looking to dominate at ground level.\n\nThe Magpies plan worked in the first term, though Jamie Elliot’s opening goal from outside the boundary line was highly dubious.\n\nIt wasn’t until mid-way through the second quarter that Essendon’s engine started to work, though James Hird’s team were guilty of wasting opportunities. The Bombers were on a run of five straight behinds until Dustin Fletcher in his 18th Anzac Day game broke the deadlock.\n\nThe veteran’s bomb from 60 metres was just his second goal in three seasons and richly savoured by Bombers among the 88,395 crowd. Brent Stanton’s goal shortly after put Essendon nine points ahead, their greatest lead of the match.\n\nBut Collingwood returned to the front with another Elliot effort and never gave their advantage up. The impressive Seedsman, Crisp and Dane Swan booted third quarter goals.\n\nRain teemed down to begin the fourth quarter, making Collingwood’s 14-point lead seem unassailable.\n\nJake Carlisle had the chance to put Essendon back within range but fluffed his kick from 15 metres out. Five minutes later, Travis Cloke marked strongly in the goal square to goal and make the game safe.\n\nIn the final game of the night, Jay Schulz slotted five goals to steer Port Adelaide past reigning AFL champions Hawthorn in stunning fashion.\n\nThe Power, touted as the club most likely to knock the Hawks off their premiership mantle, won 15.9 (99) to 13.13 (91) at Adelaide Oval.\n\nHawthorn, who lost backman Brian Lake (knee) and forward Paul Puopolo (hamstring) to injury, trailed by 58 points midway through the second quarter. But the Hawks kicked eight of the last nine goals to give the Power a fright before 50,675 spectators.\n\nLake hurt his left knee in the seventh minute of the game and was substituted, his injury coming as Port ran amok. The Power kicked eight goals to one in the first quarter, with Schulz potting three.\n\nThey booted seven unanswered goals in the initial 17 minutes - from Chad Wingard’s opening snap to remarkable long-range goals by Justin Westhoff and Hamish Hartlett, the home side’s touch was golden.\n\nThe Power led 8.2 to 1.2 at quarter-time then potted the next three goals for a 58-point lead at the main break.\n\nThe match was seemingly in Port’s keeping before a late Hawthorn charge.\n\nPort’s captain Travis Boak collected 30 disposals and formed a commanding midfield with Hamish Hartlett (22 possessions) and Brad Ebert (25 touches), while Nathan Krakouer gathered 18 damaging disposals from defence.\n\nAnd led by Schulz, Port’s forward line fizzed with Westhoff, Paddy Ryder and the Jared Polec each booting two goals.\n\nThe Hawks were overwhelmed, despite the best efforts of Isaac Smith (28 disposals, two goals), Jordan Lewis (36 possessions), Luke Hodge (28 disposals) and defender Josh Gibson.\n\nAnd forward Jack Gunston (three goals) was integral in their late rally - the Hawks booted five goals to Port’s one point in the final quarter. But Port held firm for a result which leaves both clubs with a pair of wins and losses this season.\n\nEarlier, Carlton stormed back in the second half of their match against St Kilda, to record their first win of the season by 40 points.\n\nLachie Henderson and Tom Bell stood up in attack for the Blues, who won the league’s opening match on Anzac Day 18.13 (121) to 12.9 (81). Captain Marc Murphy was also outstanding in the midfield, despite heavy tagging attention.\n\nMurphy won the inaugural Crowl-McDonald Medal as best afield. The medal was named St Kilda’s Claude Crowl and Carlton’s Fen McDonald, who made their senior debuts against each other in 1911 and died on April 25 at Gallipoli.\n\nHenderson kicked five goals and Bell’s four goals in the second half were crucial as Carlton made their comeback.\n\nIt was a crucial win for the Blues, who are recovering from a poor start to the season and plenty of media attention. The Blues were down by 25 points at quarter time and 26 midway through the second term.\n\nBut they had reduced the margin to 13 points at the main break. They doubled their score in the third term, kicking six goals to two and taking the lead for the first time.\n\nOnly 12,125 fans attended the game held in Wellington, the lowest attendance at the Cake Tin since the Saints started hosting Anzac Day games there two years ago. Officials are about to start a review of the five-year Wellington deal, and on current signs the league may abandon the plan.\n\nIn Canberra, Gold Coast slumped to their fourth straight AFL loss of 2015, thrashed by 66 points in a one-way clash with Greater Western Sydney. Despite being the youngest of the two expansion teams, the Giants were too quick and powerful for a floundering Suns outfit to win 16.23 (119) to 7.11 (53).\n\nIt marked GWS’s biggest victory since joining the competition in 2012 and third of the season, with last round’s narrow loss to cross-town rivals Sydney the only blemish.\n\nThe Suns, on the other hand, remain winless.\n\nIt was GWS’s spread and quick transition that proved too much for the Suns, who were under pressure across the park.\n\nThe Giants’ 26-point lead at the main break was their biggest halftime margin since their inception."
