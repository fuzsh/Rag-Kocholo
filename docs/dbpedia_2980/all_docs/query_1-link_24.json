Paul was an outstanding country athlete from Shepparton, having previously won the Shepparton gift. Paul was in demand with approaches from Hawthorn and South Melbourne, before joining Richmond. After playing reserves for Richmond for a season, Paul returned to the country and was pursued by a variety of clubs again, with this time joining St Kilda.\n\nPaul Bell played for St Kilda for 15 games, 8 games in 1937 and 7 games in 1938 he returned to Shepparton. When asked about his time at St Kilda he spoke fondly and listed playing with the St Kilda champion full forward Bill Mohr as his highlight.\n\nPaul Bell on the return to the country opened bicycle stores in Shapparton and Cobram, married his local sweetheart Rennie and had two daughters.\n\nLance Corporal Paul Bell enlisted in 1942 and was a member of 2/5th Australian Commando Squadron and tragically lost his life on July 4th, 1945 at Balikpapan, an island off Borneo. Such was the comradeship in his group, that his commanding officer went back to retrieve his body and sadly also lost his life. Paul Bell is buried at Labuan War Cemetery, Labuan Malaysia.\n\nPauls legacy lives on with his grandsons all being excellent country footballers, with seven of the grandsons (Brooks) all playing for Barooga in the Picola/Murray Leagues.\n\nLest We Forget\n\nAthletic Team, 2/7th Cavalry Commando Regiment, the winners in their event at the 7th Division Sports Meeting.

He was the cousin of Geelong footballer Captain Joseph Terrell Crowl who also died at Gallipoli, 27 June 1915.\n\nClaude attended Caulfield Grammar where he was an outstanding athlete. At Caulfield Grammar sports day, he won 100 yd, 220 yd and was second in 440 yd as a 14 year old. Two weeks later running in the Victorian Athletics Championships he came third in the Under 14, 100 yards sprint.\n\nIn a recruiting coup, while Claude had been training with Carlton, he played his first senior game for St Kilda, ironically against Carlton on 29 July 1911 (round 15). He was one of nine men who took the field for St Kilda for the first time on that day, due to a large number of regular St Kilda players being on strike. One of the first game players that day was the great Roy Cazaly.\n\nClaude enlisted in the First A.I.F on 25 August 1914. He listed his occupation as a farmer at Poowong Victoria.

This was largely a forgotten battle until recent years when a number of historians, writers and researchers brought it to the attention of the Australian public.\n\n“Fromelles may well be the most tragic battlefield of Australia’s history” (Les Carlyon)\n\nAt Fromelles, in a 24 hr period 1,299 Australians were killed in action, 314 of those killed were in Hugh Plowman’s 60th battalion. Hugh was born in March 1889. He was a good all round sportsman and in his late teens he played first grade cricket with Prahran and VFA football for Brighton. He made his VFL debut for the Saints in Round 5, 1910 against Essendon.\n\nAfter playing for St Kilda he joined the AIF with the rank of Corporal in 1915. After a short period of officer training he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in July 1915. He was later promoted to Captain while in France. In July 1916 Hugh was a Captain in the 60th Battalion part of an Australian force made up of the 4th and 5th Divisions AIF. In overall command of Australians were Generals White and Birdwood. The commander of Hugh’s brigade was Brigadier General H.E (Pompey) Elliott.\n\nLieutenant-General Richard Haking, Commander of the 11th British Corps had put a plan in place to attack the German trenches at Fromelles. He was no stranger to such a plan having unsuccessfully committed British troops to similar attacks with devastating results.\n\nThe Australians were set a task to attack an area known as the Sugarloaf salient south of Armentiers. Pompey Elliot believed this attack was at a grave risk of disaster and although Generals White and Birdwood agreed they were unable to convince the British General and his superiors Generals Gough and Haig to cancel the attack. After two days of delay the Australians attacked the salient manned by the 6th Bavarian reserve. The Australians met a withering tempest of machine gun and rifle fire that decimated their numbers. Lines of Australians went over the top never to return. In the 5th Division, 35 officers were hit, half mortally.\n\nHugh Plowman is presumed to have died in No Man’s Land, although there were conflicting reports. Soldiers from his battalion variously reported him as killed by machine gun fire, wounded and taken prisoner, or mortally wounded and crawling back to the lines. It is therefore possible that he is one of the fallen interred by the Germans following the battle and now the subject of the recovery of Australian remains from Pheasant Wood. Whatever the truth of the matter he has no known grave like many of his comrades. He is remembered at VC Corner, Australian Cemetery Memorial just outside the village of Fromelles.\n\nLest We Forget\n\nHi guys,\n\nI'm going to do a few of these, too. But if you want to do some, the resources for researching them are very easily available, and very accessible.\n\nYou can see that Sunshine has been using the Australian War Memorial site, which is fantastic. You can just look the person up via their search: http://www.awm.gov.au/search/all/?op=Search&format=list . Just type in the name, and then unclick the boxes for everything other than \"people\" under the searchbox. Easy as.\n\nAnother great place to get stuff is at the National Library of Australia. Just go here: http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NameSearch/Interface/NameSearchForm.aspx . Type in the name, then click \"World War I\" or \"World War II\" (as appropriate) from the list under \"Category of Records\". You'll often find some great stuff - All service records for the army at the time have been digitised, so you'll be able to see where they served, injuries, illnesses, disciplinary problems etc - if there's ever something that looks interesting, but that you can't read (not always the best handwriting in a foxhole...), let me know, as I am kinda used to that kind of thing.\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/bill+downie/4968\n\nhttp://boylesfootballphotos.net.au/Bill Downie\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1709408/?query=William Downie&op=Search&format=list&rows=20&section[0]=people\n\nhttp://hellfire-pass.commemoration.gov.au\n\nWilliam Downie\n\nPrivate 105 Transport Company, Australian Army Service Corps\n\n99th Player to Represent Footscray\n\n54 Games / 26 Goals - 1929-1932\n\n675th Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n15 Games / 2 Goals - 1933\n\nAge at Death: 34\n\nBill Downie was originally from Eaglehawk, Bill Downie was a solidly built, strong marking ruckman who gave fine service to three top level clubs. He began with Footscray, where he played 54 VFL games and kicked 26 goals between 1929 and 1932. A single season stint with St Kilda followed, where he added 15 games and two goals, before moving to Northcote where he rounded off his career. A member of the Brickfielders' 1937 premiership team, Downie won the following year's Recorder Cup (jointly with Williamstown's Arthur Cutting), and, for good measure, topped the club's goal kicking list with 48 goals.\n\nBill was captured by Japanese forces in the Second World War and interned at Prisoner of War camps working on the infamous Burma Railway. There are several references to his death, with the Australian War Memorial listing his death as due to illness, but also references to war crimes and the cowardice and brutality of a Japanese guard.\n\nTo highlight the dramatic experience of working on the Burma Railway, it is worth noting the huge numbers of Australian prisoners that died whilst being held by the Japanese and working on the Burma Railway. Over 22 000 Australians were captured by the Japanese when they conquered South East Asia in early 1942. More than a third of these men and women died in captivity. This was about 20 per cent of all Australian deaths in World War II. Of those who worked on the Burma Railway more than half died there. The shock and scale of these losses affected families and communities across the nation of only 7 million people.\n\nThe railway was never completed and was of no use to the Japanese war effort.\n\nBill is buried at the Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery Myanmar (Burma)\n\nLest We Forget\n\nThanbyuzayat War Cemetery Myanmar (Burma)\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1669131/\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/Jack+Walker/2772\n\nhttp://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/v...retonneux/the-town-of-villers-bretonneux.php#\n\nJohn Preston Walker\n\nSergeant 8th Battalion, First A.I.F\n\n351st Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n4 Games / 2 Goals - 1910-1911\n\nAge at Death: 23\n\nJohn \"Jack\" Walker started his football careers with Melbourne Grammar and then Dandenong before coming to St Kilda. Before enlisting Jack Walker was a law clerk in the city and lived in Moorrabbin.\n\nJack Walker died in the Battle of Pozieres.\n\nThe Battle of Pozières was a two-week struggle for the French village of Pozieres and the ridge on which it stands, during the middle stages of the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Though British divisions were involved in most phases of the fighting, Pozières is primarily remembered as an Australian battle. The fighting ended with the Allied forces in possession of the plateau north and east of the village, in a position to menace the Germanbastion of Thiepval from the rear. The cost had been enormous for both sides and in the words of Australian official historian Charles Bean, the Pozières ridge \"is more densely sown with Australian sacrifice than any other place on earth.\"\n\nJack Walker is buried at Villers-Bretonneux Picardie France. Villers-Bretonneux is well known to many Australians for their ongoing association and appreciation of Australia. It was Australian troops who liberated the town from German occupation. After the war the school in Villers-Bretonneux was rebuilt with donations from school children in Victoria (many of whom had relatives who died in the liberation of the town). The school is known as the Victoria school.\n\nTo reinforce their appreciation for Jack Walker and his fellow Australians, there is a large war memorial honouring the fallen dead, an Australian museum at the local school and the renaming of a number of their streets after Australian cities. Villers-Bretonneux still celebrates ANZAC Day each April 25th.\n\nLest We Forget\n\n........James Thomas \"Jim\" Farnan\n\nPrivate 46th Australian Infantry Battalion\n\n95th Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n1 Game\n\n0 Goals\n\nAge at Death: 23\n\nJim Farnan born July 12, 1875 was one of five children to William and Bridget Farnan of Emerald Hill (now known as South Melbourne).\n\nJim was recruited from Montague and played 1 game for St Kilda on the half back flank against Essendon at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground on 8 July 1899 (round 9). Essendon won by 79 points that day, with the Saints failing to score in the last 3 quarters of the match.\n\nHe enlisted aged 40, in the First A.I.F on 7 August 1915. Jim gave his occupation as packer and marital status as single. Jim embarked Australia on 23 November 1915 on the HMAT Cermic A40. He was part of a contingent of Australian reinforcements for the Western Front in France.\n\nJim was killed in action on 9 August 1916. Like fellow Saints player Jack Walker, Jim Farnan also died in the battle of Pozieres. Jim is buried in the Pozieres British Cemetery at Ovillers-la-Boisselle Picardie France.\n\nJim died at 41yo (not at 23 as Jack Walker did).\n\nAlso noticed the \"electronically translated text\" on Trove had misspelt his surname as \"Farnam\". So I corrected it.\n\nThanks for telling us about Private Farnan, Sunshine Saint.\n\nRIP Jim.\n\nPS - Still a Saint, mate.\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1710696/?query=comte&section[0]=people&op=Search\n\nhttp://www.bigfooty.com/forum/threads/st-kilda-all-time-draft.1083920/page-31#post-36551357\n\nhttp://boylesfootballphotos.net.au/Harry Comte\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/Harry+Comte/5197\n\nWilliam Henry (Harry) James Comte\n\nPrivate 2/24th Australian Infantry Battalion\n\n633rd Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n104 Games / 55 Goals - 1930-1937\n\nAge at Death: 36\n\nHarry Comte was born in Moama NSW and had a decorated football career playing with St Kilda and Sandringham.\n\nHarry Comte played over a hundred games as a rover and sometime small defender with St Kilda.Described as having formidable strength, and 'great determination and vigour', his tenacity belied his slight frame and made him a monster in close. Harry won St Kilda's best & fairest in 1933. Tough and fearless in football and in life.\n\nAlso playing some games with Sandringham, Comte retired from the Saints in 1937 before serving in World War II with the 2/24th Battalion, Second A.I.F. Sadly, at the age of 36, Private Comte was killed in action in the 1945 Battle of Tarakan. The Battle of Tarakan was the first stage of the Borneo campaign and was an amphibious landing by Australian forces. Tarakan is a small island 24 kms by 11 kms. Harry sustained wounds in the battle and died 5 days after Australian troops captured the island. It is agreed that the cost of life, was not worth the loss of life suffered for this tiny island.\n\nHarry is buried in Labuan War Cemetery, Labuan Malaysia. Harry left a widow Ruby. As St Kilda's longest serving player to have died in the service of Australia, he rightly deserves a special place in the history of the club and country.\n\nLest We Forget\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1717493/\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/Beres+Reilly/5924\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beres_Reilly\n\nBeresford Stanley (Beres) Reilly\n\nPilot Officer No 454 Squadron\n\n754th Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n8 Games / 2 Goals (North Melbourne) 1935-6\n\n3 Games / 1 Goal (Melbourne) 1937\n\n2 Games / 0 Goals (St Kilda) 1938\n\nAge at Death: 28\n\nBeres Reilly when representing a Victorian schoolboys team, tried out with Footscray. He wasn't given a game and as such moved on to North Melbourne. Two seasons at North Melbourne, a season then at Melbourne followed by one year at St Kilda.\n\nHe was a good friend of Keith Truscott (Melbourne 50 games / 31 goals), who was also killed in World War II. Serving as a Pilot Officer in the RAAF, Reilly was killed when his Martin Baltimore aircraft crashed off Crete.\n\nThe battle to recapture Crete in 1943, had followed on when Crete originally fell to the Axis powers in 1941. This battle to retake Crete, followed on shortly after the infamous Viannos massacre, it which German troops killed all residents of 20 villages as punishment for partisans who were preparing for the Allied troops landing in confronting German troops stationed there. One of the darker episodes of the war.\n\nAs seen in the R.A.A.F letter to Reilly's mother, that he was on his last flight, the wireless airgunner in a Baltimore aircraft detailed to take part in a low level bombing attack on the central section of Crete, on the 23rd July 1943. An SOS message was received from the aircraft and its position was fixed on the south coast of Crete. She was advised that in the view of the Defence Department his ultimate fate may never be known.\n\nReilly was married for only a month, before he enlisted.\n\nAs Beres body was never been recovered from his plane crash, he has no listed cemetery with the Australian War Memorial, but is listed on the Alamein Memorial, El Alamein War Cemetery, El Alamein, Marsa Matruh, Egypt.\n\nLest We Forget\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1702146/\n\nhttp://boylesfootballphotos.net.au/Bob Flegg\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/Bob+Flegg/6730\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Flegg\n\nhttp://www.ww2roll.gov.au/Veteran.aspx?ServiceId=R&VeteranId=1013664\n\nhttp://www.bigfooty.com/forum/threads/st-kilda-all-time-draft.1083920/page-34#post-36605105\n\nRobert (Bob) Barnes Flegg\n\nWarrant Officer No 70 Squadron RAF (R.A.A.F)\n\n785th Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n18 Games / 47 Goals (St Kilda) 1941\n\nAge at Death: 25\n\nBob Flegg was born in Hampton Victoria on Aug 19, 1918.\n\nAn undeniable talent, in 1937 - at only 18 years old - Flegg kicked a mighty 130 goals from full forward for the fledgling Ormond Football Club in the VAFA, before transferring to Sandringham (then in the VFA) for seven games in 1940/41 where he kicked an incredible 26 goals.\n\nPoached by the Saints for the 1941 season, the now 22 year old Flegg dutifully topped the goalkicking with 47 goals after the sudden retirement of legendary spearhead Bill Mohr, including kicking 7.6 in a two-point loss - in only his second game - against Geelong in round 2, in the first game at Kardinia Park. He kicked further bags of 5, 6 and 7 against Essendon, eventual premiers Melbourne and Carlton in the next three rounds, and a further bag of 5 - again against Geelong - in round 15. In a team that won only 3 of 18 games for the season, Flegg was clearly a standout.\n\nSadly, the war called and Flegg signed on with the RAAF. He was attached to the 70 Squadron RAF and served on transport and bombing missions in North Africa and over Europe. On 7 July 1944, the Vickers Wellington X bomber MF138 piloted by the now-WO Flegg was shot down over Feuersbrunn, Austria with the loss of all on board; he was not yet 26.\n\nHe is buried with his crew in Klagenfurt War Cemetery, Klagenfurt, Austria.\n\nThough I can't specifically identify Flegg from the above photo of the 70th - it's the not the bloke marked 'me' - it's tempting to assume the lad in the second row with the Aussie-style slouch hat may be our fella.\n\nA clear talent, taken way too young.\n\nThanks to Daddy_Barrels for this write up and information on Bob Flegg\n\nLest We Forget\n\nhttp://www.awm.gov.au/people/rolls/R1500374/\n\nhttp://www.saints.com.au/news/2012-04-23/former-saint-honoured-in-anzac-match\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Parker_(footballer)\n\nhttp://australianfootball.com/players/player/Harold+Parker/2903\n\nHarold Parker\n\n2nd Lieutenant 37th Battalion Infantry\n\n369th Player to Represent St Kilda\n\n3 Games / 0 Goals - 1911\n\nAge at Death: 24\n\nThe son of Robert Grainger Parker and Eva Parker, Harold Park was born in Elsternwick, Victoria on 26 September 1892. He attended Essendon State School. He married Jessie Parker (she remarried after the war and became Mrs. Cumming). At the time of his enlistment, he gave his occupation as warehouseman.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 1911 season, the St. Kilda Football Club and its off-field operations, and its on-field performances were very seriously affected by a players' strike due to protracted disputes with the committee relating to its (mis-)management of club affairs.\n\nDue to the sudden decisions of various players not to play in a particular match, the club used a total of 62 players that season, the most ever used in a single season by a VFL club. This indicates that, given Parker only played towards the end of the season (rounds 9. 13, and 14), he may not have been selected at all if all of the regular players were available.\n\nWhen measured on his enlistment in the army in 1915, he was 5 ft 9in tall, and weighed 13 stone.\n\nRecruited from the Essendon District Football League, aged 18, Parker played his first senior VFL match for St Kilda, against Collingwood, at Victoria Park on 17 June 1911. He played his second, against Fitzroy, at the Junction Oval, on 15 July1911. He played the last of his three VFL senior matches against Melbourne on 22 July, at the Junction Oval.\n\nParker was a well known oarsman, and was a member of the Civil Service Rowing Club. Prior to his enlistment on 11 October 1915, Parker had 3½ years experience in the Citizen's Military Force. Parker was promoted to Second Lieutenant on 21 Feb 1916.\n\nHe was badly wounded in action with the 37th Infantry Battalion of the 3rd Division of the AIF, during a trench raid in France on the night of 29 January 1917, when he was struck in the groin by German machine gun fire. He was lying in a shell hole, and was too badly wounded to be carried back to the Australian lines. The entire stretcher party that had gone to retrieve him were shot down before they could reach the shell-hole; and, by the time a patrolling party could reach the site, Parker was no longer there. (Read the first hand accounts below this)\n\nHe was taken prisoner by the Germans, and was admitted to the Bavarian Field Hospital, Lambersart, Lille, France. He died of his wounds in the German hospital the next day.\n\nBuried at the Rue-Petillon Military Cemetery, Fleurbaix, France, Parker is commemorated in a two-panel memorial window installed at St. Johns Uniting Church, at the corner of Mount Alexander Road and Buckley Street, Essendon (\"In Loving Memory of Lieut Harold Carlyle Parker, 27th Battln, Died of wounds within the German Lines at Armentieres, 30th Jany 1917, aged 25 years.

Madden played his first senior match, in the first round, against Carlton, at Princes Park on 2 May 1908. Of the three St Kilda debutants, Madden, Bismarck Kulpa and Alby Landt, he was considered to be \"the most promising\" of all the new St Kilda players. Although not a tall man, he played as a backman, a forward, and a ruckman, with an equally high level of skill and performance during his senior VFL career.\n\nIn his first season at St Kilda (1908) he played in every senior match, including the Semi-Final against Carlton, at the M.C.G. on 19 September 1908. Carlton thrashed St Kilda, by 58 points (12.12 (84) to 3.8 (26), Madden was selected as the forward pocket resting ruckman for St Kilda. The match was played in extremely wet and muddy conditions, and the umpiring was of such a poor standard that St Kilda lodged a complaint.\n\nIn his second season (1909) he only played seven matches, the last of which, against Melbourne at the Junction Oval on 24 July 1908 (round thirteen) was only possible because he was needed to replace an unavailable player.\n\nBill Madden prior to entering the Australian military was a tinsmith. Madden enlisted on March 30, 1916. Madden departed Melbourne on July 28, 1916 and arrived in Plymouth England on Sept 11, 1916. Madden was sent to fight in France on the Western Front. On May 3, 1917 at Bullecourt France, Madden was seen by a fatigue crew in a newly dug trench with a wound to his right arm, or shoulder. He was never seen again. His body was never recovered.\n\nBill Madden left a widow Priscilla and two children William and Dorothea.\n\nLest We Forget"
