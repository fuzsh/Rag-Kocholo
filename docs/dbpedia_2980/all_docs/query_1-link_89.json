        "text": "The Australian rules football team St Kilda have lost their annual ANZAC Day fixture in Wellington to fellow Melbourne side Carlton.\n\nThe Blues came from 26 points down to beat the Saints by 34 for their first win of the season, 18.13 (121) to 12.9 (81).\n\nSt Kilda have yet to win in Wellington, three years into their five year commitment to playing there, where 12,125 people watched Saturday's match, compared with 13,285 the previous year.\n\nBoth numbers are dwarfed by the 22,183 strong crowd who turned up for the inaugural fixture in 2013.\n\nThis year's match commemorated a remarkable AFL coincidence that is also one of the First World War countless tragedies.\n\nFen McDonald made his debut for Carlton in round 15 of the 1911 season at Princes Park.\n\nTheir opponents were St Kilda, who also featured first-gamer Claude Crowl.\n\nTheir paths would also come together, for the last time, four years later when it's understood they were killed during the April 25 Gallipoli landing.\n\nFollowing Saturday's game, Carlton's Marc Murphy was awarded the Crowl McDonald Medal after being voted the player best afield."
