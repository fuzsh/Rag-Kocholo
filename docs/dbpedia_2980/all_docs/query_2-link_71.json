At rest.\n\nThe Argus newspaper, Melbourne, Wed 5 Oct 1932, p 9. Transcript: Letters Witheld at Inquest. The city coroner (Mr Grant, PM) would not allow letters produced at an inquest yesterday and written by Josephine Kleiner, aged 48 years, married, St Kilda Street, Brighton, to be published. He found that Mrs Kleiner committed suicide on September 24 by taking poison. Mr R J Ramsay, who appeared for the husband, Hans Joseph Kleiner, asked that the letters might be returned to his client. Their purport was purely domestic, and Mr Kleiner had already been embarrassed by their publication in a weekly newspaper. Mr Grant advised that the application be made to the Crown Law Department. Evidence was given that Mrs Kleiner and her husband had domestic differences and that she was very upset when her husband left for Sydney on September 14. She had threatened to poison herself several times, and had been in ill-health for five years.\n\n\"National Archives Australia\", Series no D596 Henry Hans KLEINER, Mrs Nellie STUART, passport, 1932-33; Series no A1336 AUTHOR Henry Hans Kleiner: ADDRESS Melbourne: TITLE OF WORK The Hollywood Personality Register: TYPE OF WORK Literary Work: APPLICANT Henry Hans Kleiner: DATE OF APPLICATION 29 May 1934: DATE COPYRIGHT REGISTERED 12 Jun 1934: WORK ENCLOSED?

Mary Fraser was a companion of Helen Kendall and Katherine McLennan. Online\n\nPart transcript: Miss Kendall and Miss McLennan never traveled together except to Australia, they went to Australia twice together because Miss Kendall's brother had gone to Australia. The tie between the two was that Miss Kendall's father had married Miss McLennan's sister Margaret, it was his second wife. But before that the families had... Dr. Kendall and his wife and the McLennans, they had been very close friends and they spent Christmas and so on and they would be spending their Christmases together. But Miss Kendall had trained in the Royal Victoria and then she went overseas, so did Miss McLennan, went overseas. Did Helen Kendall have her own money? Now that was one thing, she was a nurse in the Royal Victoria operating room and then her father, you see, married Margaret and moved elsewhere and it turned out latterly that Miss Kendall was very comfortable, but it never really meant anything to her, that was the sad thing because she... but she was not the kind who would accept Katharine's, she would not accept anything. She must have had fairly slim... but she always drove a good car though. But her brother became very wealthy, he founded steel mills in Australia. He moved out with a suit and a pair of pajamas. He and Katharine McLennan's brother Hugh were very close friends and they had, as young men, had worked over at the steel plant in summers and then Hugh was killed.\n\nAnyway, Jim- James Kendall- decided he'd see the world so he took a tramp steamer. He found himself in Cape Town and he didn't have any money and he wore his pajamas on the boat, that was his garment on the boat because he was saving his suit for the land. Anyway, he put on the suit and hitched a ride, he wanted to see the diamond fields in South Africa because the tramp steamer was going to be in for a few days so he had a two or three days off so he got on this train and this was quite an offense in South Africa and he got put in jail and he was desperate because he had to get back on the boat, but he got out and on to the boat and went to Australia. And it just happened that he had enough experience with the steel plant to at least talk about steel and he became extremely wealthy and he married a Baroness or something or other, a great socialite in Sydney, Australia and they had one son anyway. But when he died, rather when he died I don't think money came to Miss Kendall, she may have got some at that point, but when the wife died, quite a nice income came from Australia, but by then Katharine was dead and the money was just going into the bank. Miss Kendall had plenty around for her care, but she would have enjoyed the money so much more if she'd had it back then. But the two of them had two trips to Australia, I think two years in succession or maybe a year in between and that would have been when they were well up in their... well, they must have been eighty. I don't know if there was a year in between the trips or not, but the first one was so successful, they took a second one. They did quite a bit of sightseeing in Australia. But it was a very close relationship between them, they fought, they disagreed on things, but were very fond of one another.\n\nIndex to Unassisted Inward Passenger Lists to Victoria 1852-1923, Public Record Office Victoria.

Transcript: ICE HOCKEY. Contests at the Glaciarium. The ice hockey test matches, between women's teams and men's teams representing Victoria and New South Wales, were played at the Glaciarium on Saturday. These games are annual fixtures. Three tests are played and the team winning the majority of them receives, in the women's competition, custody for one year of the Gower Cup. In the men's section, the trophy is the Goodall Cup, which was presented for competition in 1909 (appears as 1904) by Mr J E (K?) Goodall, and has been held four times by New South Wales and four times by Victoria. It is at present in the hands of the New South Wales Association. The Gower Cup was given by Miss K Goodall almost two years ago. In the men's match, the Victorian's were outclasssed by a heavier, faster and more systematic team. On the other hand, the women of both teams displayed a vast knowledge of the finer points of the game, and provided one of the finest women's matches ever witnessed at the Glaciarium. Victoria one by two goals to one. In the evening, the women were entertained at a dinner at Scott's Hotel. The women's teams were: - Victoria - M Kendall, W Williams, M Maloney, A Wilson, D Callaway, and M Lucas. New South Wales - N. ?, V Kerr, E Wallack, K Lauder, M Gourlay and I Waite. Final scores: - Victoria, 2 goals; New South Wales, 1 goal. Goal-hitters: - Mrs Kendall, Miss Moloney; New South Wales, Miss Kerr. Misses Lucas and Maloney and Mrs Kendall were the most prominent for the winners. On the visitor's side serviceable work was performed by Misses Kerr, Gourlay and Lauder. The men's teams had their first contest in the evening. The teams were: - New South Wales, Point, J Kendall (captain); Cover-point, L. Reid; Centre, J H Pike, Left Wing, G Slade; Right wing, N Turner; Goal, W Cairns. Victoria: - Point, M. Bilsborrow, Cover-point, M. Harris; Centre, K Collins; Left wing, R Dyer; Right wing E Moloney (captain); Goal W Dow. Final scores: - New South Wales won by 2 goals to nil. New South Wales was best served by Kendall who was perhaps the best player of the match, Slade and Pike. For Victoria, Dow in goal was twoer of strength, and saved many possible goals. Dyer, Maloney and Bilsborrow also played well. The trophies will be presented to the winning teams Thursday, prior to the return of the victors to Sydney.\n\n[133] The Argus, Sat July 31st, 1926, p. 20. Transcript: Ice Hockey. Interstate Championships. Preparations are being made for the Interstate ice hockey championship games in Melbourne and, with the approach of the carnival, increased interest is being taken in the sport and in the selection of the team to represent Victoria against New South Wales. A series of three matches will be played at the Glaciarium, the first on August 7, and the others on August 9 and August 11. The Victorian Team will be selected from the following: - C. Kershaw (St Kilda), E. (F?) A. Collins (Brighton), J. Donovan (Essendon), C. Hayward (Brighton), W. Grier (?) (St Kilda), C. Fox (Essendon), J. Armstong (Brighton), W. Billsborrow (St Kilda), C. M Napthine (Essendon), A. D. Long (St Kilda), and C. Dixon (Brighton). New South Wales will send their representatives to Melbourne for the championships. They are S. Reid (captain), J. Pike (vice-captain), N. Turner, G. Slade, J. Kerr, J. Harriett, T. Wells, T. Gibson, and H. Roth. The ? men who will comprise the team will be selected in Melbourne immediately before each match. A notable absence from the New South Wales team is J. Kendall, who has retired from the game. With the exception of Kenny, the personnel of the New South Wales team is the same as last year, when NSW easily defeated Victoria. Competition matches for the Goodall Cup will be continued at the Glaciarium on Monday night, when Brighton will meet Essendon. Having defeated Brighton last night, St Kilda is at the top of the Premiership list, with Brighton second and Essendon third. The number of points scored by each team is as follows: - St Kilda, 7; Brighton, 3 (?); Essendon, 2. The last round of matches will decide which team will hold the Sutherland Cup.\n\n[134] The Argus, July 9th, 1931. Transcript: The second series of tests for the Grice cup was held at the Glaciarium last night, and resulted: - Mis D. Tickle, 1; Miss W. Thackeray, 2; Misses K. Magill and V. Pincott (drawn?), 3.

The women's team will be represented by Misses Winsome Thackeray, Phyllis Turner, Vera Pincott, and Dorothy Tickle.\n\n[135] The Argus, Friday, 31 July 1925, p. 4. Transcript: INTERSTATE ICE HOCKEY. Goodall Cup Competition. The Victorian Team to play the remaining three ice hockey test matches against New South Wales will leave for Sydney on Thursday, August 6, and probably will return on Monday August 17. The matches will be played at the Sydney Glaciarium. The Victorian Team, which will be under the management of the Secretary of the Victorian Ice Hockey Association (Mr W. Bannerman) will be chosen from the following: - E J Molony (captain), E A Collins (vice captain), D Armstrong, A De Long, C Dixson, J Donovan, J Goodall, C Kershaw, F Kinnear and M Kendall (McKendall?). Three matches of the series of six for the Goodall Cup, which at present is held by New South Wales, were won by the New South Welshmen, at the Melbourne Glaciarium. As the American sailors are not ice hockey players, it has not been possible, as was intended, to arrange a match between a second Victorian team and a Fleet team.\n\n[136] The Argus, Monday 11 August 1930, p. 12. Transcript: INTERSTATE ICE HOCKEY. New South Wales Wins. The first of the three hockey matches between Victoria and New South Wales for the Goodall Cup was played at the Glaciarium on Saturday evening, and resulted in a win for the visitors by two goals to nil. The second and third matches will be played this evening and on Wednesday evening. The first puck on Saturday evening was thrown by Miss Gladys Moncrieff. From it the visitors set up an attack which they maintained. They played with splendid combination, while the Victorian team appeared to rely mainly on individual effort, Cullen, making most of the pace in the first half, playing a splendid game, but being poorly supported. The visitors first line of defense was particularly impenentrable, Brown playing a particularly fine game in both attack and defence. The Victorian attacks were generally broken down before the New South Wales goal-keeper was relied upon to do anything, while, at the other end, Darke, in goal, was kept working hard. The two New South Wales goals were scored one in each half, that in the first half being credited to Brown, though only the goal umpire saw it. That in the second half was an entirely individual effort by Gallecher, who took the puck from loose play in the centre. Gallecher was also responsible for saving the position for New South Wales in the only really dangerous attack by Victoria.\n\n[137] The Argus, Monday 28 Aug 1916, p 10. Transcript: Both floor and seating space at the Glaciarium, despite their extent, were fully engaged on Saturday night, on the occasion of a fancy-dress carnival.

Claiming £1,516/12/ for damage alleged to have been caused to poultry, owing to defective or careless storage, Lewis Raphael of Brunswick and Melbourne, proceeded against the Melbourne Ice Skating and Refrigerating Co. Ltd. The action came before Mr. Justice Mann, in the Bank Court yesterday, and, although a defence had been entered, there was no appearance of the defendant company. It was alleged that after the poultry which Raphael had sent to the defendant company had been in store for some time, it was discovered to be badly affected with mould, and, as a result, became useless. Evidence was called to show that the presence of mould indicated an absence of reasonable care. Judgement was entered for the amount claimed with costs. Mr. Ah Ket (instructed by Messrs. W. Pembrey and ?) appeared for Raphael.\n\nThe Argus Thur 26 April 1923. MELBOURNE ICE SKATING AND REFRIGERATING CO. LTD. (In Liquidation). PRELIMINARY NOTICE. TENDERS will be invited, 1.

Property Realises £35,800. On March 28 last the Melbourne Ice and Refrigeration Company Limited went into voluntary liquidation. Yesterday afternoon, acting under instructions from the liquidator, Bailieu Allard Pty Ltd, offered for sale by auction the Company's property in City road, South Melbourne, known as the Glaciarium, together with all plant and fittings, as a going concern. The land has a frontage to Bright Street. Apart from the main building there are engine and machinery rooms. The bidding commenced at £25,000 and after a brisk contest, the property was finally sold to Cameron, Sutherland and Seward Pty Ltd for £35,800. At the time the company went into liquidation the cause was stated to be the falling off in revenue from the storage plant from £10,000 per annum to £1,500. The liabilities amounted to £38,000 (?) and the building, plant and machinery originally cost £70,000. Approximate Area 26,000 Square Feet Land Measures 217ft.

A meeting of ice-skaters will be held at the Playhouse on Tuesday evening, at 8 o'clock. The future of ice-skating in Melbourne will be discussed, and an effort made to form a new company strong enough to provide it's own ice-skating rink.\n\nThe Argus, Dec 16 1925, Transcript: Ice Skating, New Glaciarium Needed. As the proposed sale of the Glaciarium threatens to deprive skaters of their recreation in the winter of 1926, a meeting was held at the Playhouse last night to consider what precautions should be taken to ensure proper facilities for ice skating next winter. It was stated that it was very probable that the Glaciarium would be sold before the end of the year, and the building converted for some other class of entertainment. It is thought that it will be possible to obtain from the new proprietors a lease of the premises for the 1926 season, but it will be necessary to find a new rink in 1927. For this purpose an option is held of a site in Toorak Road, South Yarra. The estimated cost of a new rink is between £40,000 and £45,000. Adequate financial support for this proposal has been promised and it is expected that a company will be formed shortly to build a new rink. At the meeting last night, the following committee was appointed to make arrangements for the provision of facilities for ice skating next winter: - Dr C MacGillicuddy and Messrs F Turner, J G Beaver, H W Allen, J Williams, K Gardner, H Goldman, J Telfer, M Peck, A de Long, C Langley and H Kendall. Mr L R Molloy was appointed Secretary to the committee, and a guarantee of £1,000 was given by the meeting to cover necessary expenses.\n\nThe Argus, Tue 11 Jan 1927 p 2.

New Company Formed. Having obtained from the Metropolitan Gas Company a five years' lease of the Glaciarium building, in City road, South Melbourne, Mr. L. R. Molloy has formed a new Ice skating company, to be known as The Glaciarium Limited. Mr. Molloy, who has been manager of the Glaciarium for several seasons, has been engaged as managing director and secretary of the new company for the period of the lease. This season was one of the most successful in the history of the Glaciarium. The season will open in May, and in the interval it is proposed to install new and up to date refrigerating machinery, and to renovate and redecorate the building.\n\nThe Argus, Feb 28, 1931. Glaciarium Sold. The Glaciarium, 16 City Road, South Melbourne, has been acquired by Glaciarium Ltd, which has held a lease of the property since 1926.
