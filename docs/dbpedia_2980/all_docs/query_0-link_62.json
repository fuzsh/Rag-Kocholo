        "text": "It is most likely his thoughts were with his wife May and their two boys — one of whom, Teddy, was carried on Larkin's shoulders while he was cheered at a torchlight procession by supporters who celebrated the Labor Party's underdog snaring the Liberal stronghold of Willoughby in 1913.\n\nAs Ted Larkin lay bleeding, probably praying that he would somehow return to his family, the tough-as-granite rugby league forward Stan Carpenter, who had captained Newcastle in the 1908-09 NSWRL premierships, was up to his garters in blood and gore as a stretcher bearer.\n\nThe beach was already littered with corpses when Carpenter charged ashore with the third wave of Anzacs. Within 24 hours the forward who had played under Larkin's administration and represented Australia, was recommended for the Victoria Cross after he braved murderous machine-gun fire to rescue four wounded Diggers who screamed for help from their bullet-riddled boat as it floundered in the sea.\n\nTed Larkin might have been thinking about Martin, aka \"Paddy\", as he probably attempted to dress his own wounds. As one of the founders of the Newtown Pastime Club Paddy Larkin was a boxer who, The Referee sports newspaper noted, fought the likes of \"Otto\" Cribb, Hock Keys, \"Psycho\" Hansen and \"Poet\" McCoy — one of the best of his day.\n\nNow, in the blink of an eye, the noble pugilist was gone.\n\nAs Ted Larkin lay dying, Blair Swannell, who represented his native England and then Australia in rugby, was pinned down by enemy fire as he and his troops prepared to assault the hill known as Baby 700. Swannell probably thought that, at 40, campaigning in the Dardanelles would add another tale to his litany of life adventures which included being a sailor, serving in the Boer War, fighting among the insurrectionists in Uruguay, hunting seals and playing rugby in France, South Africa, Germany, India and America.\n\nEver the mentor, he coached hockey and rugby; was the vice-president of the Sydney Swimming Club and he trained military cadets for their surf-lifesaving exams. Swannell's last mortal act was to show his boys how to aim their rifles at an enemy who held the high ground.\n\nAs a footballer criticised by even his own teammates for his \"give no quarter and expect none\" approach it is possible Swannell would have copped his fate as being part of the \"game\" when a Turkish sniper shot him in the head.\n\nTed Larkin might have been thinking about his football career before it dawned on him his chances of survival were slim. He played rugby for St Joseph's College at Hunters Hill before joining Newtown's Endeavour club, who he captained in 1903, the year he was selected for NSW against Queensland and Australia against the All Blacks.\n\nHe was so committed to the game he turned out for NSW the day after his wedding. However, Larkin never took himself too seriously and laughed loudly the morning he was on the beat and realised the \"old grey-headed beggar\" a fellow cop was referring to when he spoke about the match he watched over the weekend was, in fact, him.\n\nAs Ted Larkin started losing consciousness because of his blood loss, the friends of Lieutenant Rupert Balfe, a medical student, talented athlete and VFL player for University, were still coming to grips with his death, which occurred at 5.20am when a shell burst above his boat, raining shrapnel.\n\nBalfe was one of six VFL players who died that first Anzac Day. When the news finally reached Australia a friend from the University of Melbourne, Robert Menzies, who would become Australia's 12th prime minister in 1939, wrote a poem to vent his anguish:\n\n\"His was the call that came from far away;\n\nAn Empire's message flashing o'er the seas\n\nThe call to arms! The blood of chivalry\n\nPulsed quicker in his veins; he could not stay.\"\n\nAs Anzacs rushed past him Ted Larkin might have wished he was back in Sydney and being treated at the Royal North Shore Hospital where he served on the board.\n\nHe may have even shook his head in disbelief at the violence of his impending death because for four years he was a police officer who maintained law and order on Sydney's streets before resigning in 1909 to assume the role as the NSWRL's first full-time secretary.\n\nWhile Dally Messenger drew the crowds as the professional code's superstar, Larkin's brilliance as an organiser straightened out a shambolic administration and he established rugby league as the city's preferred code.\n\nHe pushed league, believing in \"honest professionalism as against quasi-amateur football\" and his being a devout Catholic and Labor politician helped convince Marist Brothers' schools to adopt the code. He devised a plan to have the Wallabies play the Kangaroos in a three-match series but it fell through because the rugby players feared they would be tainted as professional. He also drew up a blueprint in 1910 to take the game to the United States.\n\nAs Ted Larkin would have started to tremor from shock Alan Cordner, who played for Geelong and Collingwood, was fighting for his life after being cut off from his battalion six kilometres inland at Cape Helles. It took 12 months before the Red Cross confirmed he died that day.\n\nJoe Pearce, who represented Melbourne in 152 games, perished long before his boat hit the sand; Claude Crowl, from St Kilda, and Fen McDonald, who opposed Crowl the day he made his VFL debut against Carlton in 1911, gave all they had at the so-called birth of a nation. Yet another, Charlie Fincher, of South Melbourne, was doomed to an unmarked grave when he was shot dead in a boat hundreds of metres off Anzac Cove.\n\nSouth Australian cricketer Charles Backman made it to the beach with the men of the 10th Battalion but no one knows what happened to him amid the confusion. While the sergeant's dog tags were found, the body of the right-arm bowler wasn't. Wisden notes in the one first-class match he played in 1911-12 Backman took 3-53 against the touring MCC with Plum Warner and Frank Woolley among his victims.\n\nTed Larkin couldn't have imagined the outpouring of grief that followed his final desperate breath. Headlines proclaimed \"Ted Larkin, a fellow of infinite jest, brimful of fun\", and The Sydney Morning Herald war correspondent Charles Bean would describe him as \"a man with a fine influence in his battalion\".\n\nPoems immortalised his courage, political foes agreed he had the qualities to become premier. St Joseph's established a scholarship in his name. A plaque was unveiled in the Legislative Assembly Chamber to commemorate him and George Frederick Braund, the member for Armidale, who also died at Gallipoli, and there were promises his family wouldn't go without."
