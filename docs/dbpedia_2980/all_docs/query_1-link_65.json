        "text": "Post by miletus12 on\n\nThis is a timeline, possibly related to the Showboat vs. The Iron Chancellor.\n\nStart point (Actual history)\n\nThe Washington Naval Conference, 1921–1922\n\nIntroduction\n\nBetween 1921 and 1922, the world’s largest naval powers gathered in Washington, D.C. for a conference to discuss naval disarmament and ways to relieve growing tensions in East Asia.\n\nIn the wake of World War I, leaders in the international community sought to prevent the possibility of another war. Rising Japanese militarism and an international arms race heightened these concerns. As a result, policymakers worked to reduce the rising threat. Senator William E. Borah (R–Idaho) led a congressional effort to demand that the United States engage its two principal competitors in the naval arms race, Japan and the United Kingdom, in negotiations for disarmament.\n\nSenator William E. Borah (He was not too bright between the ears.)\n\nIn 1921, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes invited nine nations to Washington, D.C. to discuss naval reductions and the situation in the Far East. The United Kingdom, Japan, France and Italy were invited to take part in talks on reducing naval capacity, while Belgium, China, Portugal, and the Netherlands were invited to join in discussions on the situation in the Far East. Three major treaties emerged out of the Washington Naval Conference: the Five-Power Treaty, the Four-Power Treaty, and the Nine-Power Treaty.\n\nThe Five-Power Treaty\n\nThe Five-Power Treaty, signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France and Italy was the cornerstone of the naval disarmament program. It called for each of the countries involved to maintain a set ratio of warship tonnage which allowed the United States and the United Kingdom 500,000 tons, Japan 300,000 tons, and France and Italy each 175,000 tons. Japan preferred that tonnage be allotted at a 10:10:7 ratio, while the U.S. Navy preferred a 10:10:5 ratio. The conference ultimately adopted the 5:5:3 ratio limits. Since the United States and the United Kingdom maintained navies in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to support their colonial territories, the Five-Power Treaty allotted both countries the highest tonnage allowances. The treaty also called on all five signatories to stop building capital ships and reduce the size of their navies by scrapping older ships.\n\nThough the treaty was widely regarded as a success; the inclusion of Article XIX, which recognized the status quo of U.S., British, and Japanese bases in the Pacific but outlawed their expansion, created a controversy amongst U.S. policymakers. Many members of the U.S. Navy in particular worried that limiting the expansion of fortifications in the Pacific would endanger U.S. holdings in Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines.\n\nAdditionally, although the Five-Power Treaty controlled tonnage of each navy’s warships, some classes of ships were left unrestricted. As a result, a new race to build cruiser ships emerged after 1922, leading the five nations to return to the negotiating table in 1927 and 1930 in an effort to close the remaining loopholes in the Treaty.\n\nThe Four-Power Treaty\n\nIn the Four-Power Treaty, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and Japan agreed to consult with each other in the event of a future crisis in East Asia before taking action. This treaty replaced the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902, which had been a source of some concern for the United States. In the years following World War I, U.S. policymakers saw Japan as the greatest rising military threat. Heavily militarized and looking to expand its influence and territory, Japan had the potential to threaten U.S. colonial possessions in Asia and the profitable China trade. Because of the 1902 agreement between the United Kingdom and Japan, however, if the United States and Japan entered into a conflict, the United Kingdom might be obligated to join Japan against the United States. By ending that treaty and creating a Four-Power agreement, the countries involved ensured that none would be obligated to engage in a conflict, but a mechanism would exist for discussions if one emerged.\n\nThe Nine-Power Treaty\n\nThe final multilateral agreement made at the Washington Naval Conference, the Nine-Power Treaty, marked the internationalization of the U.S. Open Door Policy in China. The treaty promised that each of the signatories—the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China—would respect the territorial integrity of China. The treaty recognized Japanese dominance in Manchuria but otherwise affirmed the importance of equal opportunity for all nations doing business in the country. For its part, China agreed not to discriminate against any country seeking to do business there. Like the Four-Power Treaty, this treaty on China called for further consultations amongst the signatories in the event of a violation. As a result, it lacked a method of enforcement to ensure that all powers abided by its terms.\n\nIn addition to the multilateral agreements, the participants completed several bilateral treaties at the conference. Japan and China signed a bilateral agreement, the Shangtung (Shandong) Treaty, which returned control of that province and its railroad to China. Japan had taken control of the area from the Germans during World War I and maintained control of it over the years that followed. The combination of the Shangtung Treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty was meant to reassure China that its territory would not be further compromised by Japanese expansion. Additionally, Japan agreed to withdraw its troops from Siberia and the United States and Japan formally agreed to equal access to cable and radio facilities on the Japanese-controlled island of Yap.\n\nTogether, the treaties signed at the Washington Naval Conference served to uphold the status quo in the Pacific: they recognized existing interests and did not make fundamental changes to them. At the same time, the United States secured agreements that reinforced its existing policy in the Pacific, including the Open Door Policy in China and the protection of the Philippines, while limiting the scope of Japanese imperial expansion as much as possible.\n\nTimeline alterations I propose.\n\n1. The Spanish American War results in American seizure of the Caroline, Gilbert, Marshall and Marianas Islands groups from Spain as well as the Caribbean territories, the Canary Islands and La Ceuta in North Africa.\n\n2. The Philippine Islands gain their independence, but in a situation similar to Cuba, the United States foists on the Aguinaldo government a treaty allowing for a lease of naval bases in Subic and Manila Bays and the construction of a largish American colonial presence at those bases. The theory here is that the Americans are a little smarter about how this colonial imperialism thing is supposed to work (Not really, as evidenced by Cuba, but one can dream. M.).\n\n3. Because of a much better Spanish Armada in the Spanish American war and extensive Spanish commerce raiding; the American navy is a bit less battleship happy and becomes excited about trade protection at sea, both the attack and defense of. After all, the whole point of destroying Cervera’s squadron off Tenedos, when he put in for supply and Schley surprised him, was because it was snapping up American cross-Atlantic trade. So… fast long-ranged armored cruisers play a prominent role in American thinking, while the Germans and British, misreading Mahan, go into their battleship building frenzy. Congress goes along with the balanced fleet plan, because of the Spanish American War history lesson and via Teddy Roosevelt, who Bull Mooses that large navy into existence to serve the new American commercial interests in the Pacific.\n\n4. WWI as scheduled, but without Wilson, happens with the results that the Americans do a little bit better than historically. They show up fewer, a bit earlier, (1916), but far more prepared and trained. One major help is that instead of the incompetent John Pershing, Frederick Funston leads the AEF with TR’s blessing . He quashes the incompetent Billy Mitchell and favors the Scofield Gang. And thus the navy gets its hands on all things; aeroplanes, it having had previous technical successes with Samuel Langley, Orville and Wilbur Wright, and Glenn Curtiss to steer them to their aerial future.\n\n5. The lessons of WWI, especially of seaplanes versus U-boats are USN remembered. Also USN remembered; is just how fouled up Jutland was, with the Royal Navy falling for Speer’s ambush and Beatty losing all of the battle cruisers, which left Jellico functionally blind. Instrumental in Scheer’s escape / victory was the use of Zeppelins as the German fleet’s eyes. Those big lumbering, blundering gasbags, as vulnerable as they were, still had radios and shadowed the Grand Fleet virtually unmolested. The British answer to the problem, the aircraft carrying ship, was not ready in time, and so Scheer had the reconnaissance advantage in spite of the North Sea weather. The USN vowed it would not be so caught in any future naval war with any possible adversary.\n\n===========================================================\n\nThe Washington Disarmament Conference of 1922 takes place in that above background and with some minor technological differences at least for the Americans.\n\na. The Americans, early during WWI, converted two colliers, the USS Jupiter (USS Langley) and the USS Neptune (USS Wright) into ocean going airplane carrying ships to shoot down Zeppelins. While very slow, these “aircraft carriers” had more or less proven aircraft reconnaissance from them was also viable by 1918, during the Battle of the Atlantic, while they protected American troop convoys, and thus the Lexington class was designed as “aircraft carriers” from the keel up. This was in keeping with the American navy’s thinking about aerial scouting for fleets being quite important after the Jutland (1916) and Rosyth Raid (1917) fiascos of WWI.\n\nb. The U-boat menace had impressed the Americans to no end. 1 in 5 US ship transits in 1916 and 1917 had resulted in a lost US-flagged ship. Although the Germans had to hand over their U-boats to the Allies as a result of the Versailles Truce (Late 1917), as Admiral Sims laughingly called it, there was no guarantee that U-boats or someone else’s submarines would not menace American commerce in the future. This would require attention in a practical application as well as an international legally binding treaty sense.\n\nc. Battleships, at least the American ones, had played negligible roles in the war at sea. However the role of cruisers had shown that the Americans had too few of them and of the wrong kind.\n\nd. So with all of the above in mind, not only were the Americans very keen to halt a battleship building arms race that might lead to another general war, but they were also eager to play in the chinks to hobble or at least limit the attack /offense options of their main naval rivals.\n\n=====================================================\n\nSo there was some trading to be had. What was the result in this alternate timeline?\n\n1. The battleship tonnage limit of 535,000 long tons for Great Britain and 375,000 for Japan was capped. France and Italy were limited to 310,000 tons. Technical armament limitations for main armament limited gun bore size to 40.6 cm or 16 inches. Unit displacement limits were set at 35,000 long tons. Similar limitations for cruisers’ bore size armament at 20.3 cm or 8 inches followed. The unit displacement limit for cruisers was capped at 10,000 long tons.\n\n2. Britain could keep her 6 flattops already built, with replacement aof them fter 20 years. The Americans got 2 new builds, Japan got 2 new builds and the Italians and French got 2 each of their own, if they could build them. Unit tonnage limit was pegged at the American limit for 27,000 tons (See 4.).\n\n3. The capping tonnage for American battleships was ostensibly 535,000 tons, but a clause was inserted that allowed the Americans to redirect 115,000 tons into aircraft carrier construction if they reduced their battleship tonnage.\n\n4. With the two aircraft carriers allowed by treaty, the Americans could build, if they chose, the other four Lexingtons as flattops. They just had to scrap 115,000 tons of more battleships to get there. Goodbye; Arkansas, New York, Texas, and possibly Nevada and Oklahoma, and definitely Utah. Nevada would be the artillery training ship allowed in the exceptions clause as long as she was demilitarized.\n\n5. Whether or not the Americans could get the torpedo clause to limit diameter to 53.3 cm or 21 inches and caliber to no longer than 15 bore lengths (315 inches or 800 cm.), well: we assume that they do and Japan legally had to scrap its WWI 24 inch torpedoes and the British never got to equip their NELRODs with their 24.5 inch diameter fish. Both of them will cheat and of course that will prompt a response.\n\n6. Fortifications clauses in the Pacific generally very much hold as in the real history, and so does the contemptible nine-power China trade and exploitation treaty. The differences are Chu'uk and Singapore and Taipei are exempted from the restrictions. The Philippine Republic, being an independent nation, as is Thailand, are not covered by the non-fortifications clauses. Interesting?\n\n7. The British Japanese alliance was decoupled over Canada’s protest. (Thanks Canada, we DO remember that Dominions conference where you argued against ending the Japanese alliance. M.).\n\n8. Submarines should have been outlawed, but America and France insisted on a tonnage limit of 50% of capital ship tonnage. That is a lot of U-boats (88 each for France and Italy, possibly 180 for Japan.). The Americans with their own ideas would settle for about 100.\n\n9. Cruiser tonnage caps was set at total capital ship tonnage limits.\n\n10. There was a set cap tonnage for destroyers of 75% of Capital ship tonnage, except that individual units could not exceed 1,600 tons for leaders and 1,200 tons for standard destroyers. Main armament could not exceed 5.25 inches bore size or 13.35 cm for guns or 21 inches diameter and 15 calibers for torpedoes.\n\n11. An exception for destroyers was that you could build as many destroyers as you want as long as they were of 600 tons displacement or less. Italy insisted on that clause.\n\nOne last note. With the Caroline Islands in America's hands and the Philippine Islands independent (sort of) the main American west Pacific naval base is Ch'uk.\n\nGuess where December 7th will happen?\n\nSo where do we go from 1922? This is an open participation timeline.\n\nPost by miletus12 on\n\nFallout from the Treaty: Years 1922-1930.\n\nThe British:\n\nThe Exchequer or Treasury as it now styled itself, was more or less tight with the monies allocated to the fleet. These post WWI realities of trying to pay down the national debt, rebuilding a shattered economy and massive demobilization of millions to be unemployed young men, hit the British admiralty like a pyramid dropped upon them. Their massive fleets of the glorious empire, with hundreds of ships scattered across the world ocean was an expensive luxury the bankrupt His majesty's government could not afford. THAT was why the British reluctantly agreed to the American treaty in the first place. The RN was about to be chopped in half, and it would have to accept naval parity with the upstart colonials. This did not sit well with the bigots in the admiralty.\n\nPolitically and militarily the Royal Navy was dominated by the Beatty Crowd who did not like the treaty at all because it brought about that parity. As background, this cabal of cads and alibiers had rewritten / mangled WWI naval and army history to obscure David Beatty's absolute incompetence during the various battle cruiser actions he fought with Franz von Hipper, as well as the amateurishness of the British army command ashore. The two items were sort of intertwined, since the British upper classes had botched the war in two horese tamden. They, the clubbers, were deathly afraid that the Commons would find out the truth and turn them out, (As they did after WWII).\n\nThat truth was remarkably dark. The British army had planned and fought the war with the well placed belief that the issue would be settled on land in France. This idiocy was straight out of Clauswitz. The expletive deleted of it, was that the Royal Navy should have known from the Napoleonic Wars; if not from Alfred Thayer Mahan, that the issue should have been settled at sea. The admiralty, however, plonked their chips on Julian Corbett and politically, until he expletive deleted the war at sea up, on the incompetent Winston Churchill. The RN did not prepare for the trade war, nor did it fight the trade war. It sought myopically to bring the German fleet to battle somehow, while also \"blockading\" the North Sea. Feints and grand sweeps and the Jutland battle and the botched battle cruiser battles, all looked good in the British post war naval annals, but the U-boat war came within a few hundred thousand tons of sunk shipping of doing the British in. THAT was what the Americans *(ADM William Sims) told Braindead Beatty and the Admiralty in 1917.\n\nThey did not learn anything, the Royal Navy, at least not until Backhouse came in later and cleaned out the Beatty riff-raff.\n\nThe RN, thus, went into the treaty to at least preserve some battle fleet \"Paper Superiority\". And in so doing, they missed the plot of what mattered. They were quite willing to argue battleships and cruisers with all the technical details. They did want to \"outlaw\" submarines, but they ignored such things as naval geography and fleet logistics in the treaty and thus cut their own naval throats when it came to their vital naval interests.\n\nSome of their junior officers (Andrew Cunningham), did argue that maybe the agreed cap ratios on destroyer tonnage was not too smart as it was too low, and meybe the submarine caps were too high for the treaty powers, but those junior officerss were ignored.\n\nThe RN needed modernized battleships and battle cruisers and it needed trade protection cruisers. That was what mattered to the Beatty Crowd.\n\nThe British especially wanted to finish the two G-3 plan battlecruisers that they had underweigh on the stocks and abuilding. These 40,000 ton 30 knot monsters along with the Hood, Repulse and Renown would restore the fast wing of the battle fleet and erase the memory of the battle cruiser slaughter at Jutland. That was the paramount Brtitish demand. With the R class and Q class battleships (10 ships with 80 barrels) and the battle cruisers (5 ships with 38 barrels) the Royal Navy would have their throw weight and speed advantages over the Americans and the Japanese. For trade protection, 53 and a half cruisers was not as many as 64, but the cap was on overall tonnage and did not specify how many cruisers had to fit into that tonnage. The competitors could not build anything equal to British ships anyway *(arrogance), so it was all right to live with 535,000 tons as the overalll cap and build a heavy cruiser class at 10,000 tons and make up the numbers with lots of light cruisers of 5,000 to 7,000 tons. 200,000 tons of heavies and 335,000 tons of lights yeilded 20 heavy cruisers and 47 light cruisers for 67, thank you.\n\nAircraft carriers? Britain had 6, and everyone else who mattered had 2. Besides the Japanese could not fly according to Lord Sempill.\n\nIt was not what Britain wanted ideally, but it was a better result than what anyone else got. Hah!\n\n=======================================================\n\nThe Japanese:\n\nWWI had not been kind to the Japanese. They had been loyal British allies and had expected to share in the spoils of conquest. For Japan this meant the German holdings in China was a given and their continued expansion along and into the Chinese coastal provinces would be accepted, if not actually welcomed (especially by the Americans. M.). The Japanese were also irritated that the British (and the Americans) hemmed in their trade and treated them as \"racial inferiors\".\n\nWhen the \"racial equality\" clause posed by the Italians first at the Versailles Treaty negotiations was squashed and then again at the contentious Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, again by the Anglo-Americans the Japanese made it a point of national honor to insist on a 70% tonnage ratio. This was not so much a mathematical defense ratio as the Japanese publically argued as it was a way to impose a practical recognition that the Japanese were an equal naval power, who had a right to force some concession of recognition from the racist westerners. This viewpoint tended to color much of the Japanese naval calculations more than practical technical details like unit bcharactersitics or mixes and matches and unit parities.\n\nIt resulted in the 375,000 ton cap for the Japanese that allowed them 1 additional \"inferior\" battleship.\n\nIt resulted in the two new Mutsu class battleships to match the four Colorados in gun bore diameter size.\n\nIt resulted in the two new aircraft carriers to add to the two small experimental ones they had, which were conveniently classified as auxilliaries, instead as actual aircraft carriers as the Langley class were for the Americans.\n\nThe Japanese got recognition, but they had no military rationale for what they wanted and obtained. They would manufacture an after the fact rationale and plan in time for the London 1930 Conference, but the naval treaty for them really made (in real history and in this timeline) no logiclal military sense.\n\n=======================================================\n\nFrance and Italy:\n\nBoth nations were lock-mirrored into each other and for much the same reasons. They both had bankrupted themselves in WWI. They both abandoned any naval pretensions they had to fight ruinous and politcally national psyche shattering land wars. They both reagarded each other as the principle threats to their African colonial impoerialist empires and ambitions, and they were within ten hours steaming time/ distance of each other's bases at La Spezia and Toulon. NEITHER could build massive fleets of battleships and neither could afford a naval arms race in case the Germans became frisky again.\n\nThe French were the main drivers. They quibbled over minuitia and argued legalities endlessly and whenever the French obtained a tonnage definition or a bore / caliber limitation or exception, the Italians would proclaim; \"Chiediamo esattamente la stessa cosa.\" (We demand the exact same thing.) If the French Marine National wanted two aircraft carriers, then the Regia Marina wanted them, too. Neither nation might know how to build them; nor what to do with them when constructed, but if the British, Americans and Japanese had them, then France and Italy wanted a couple each of their own, because the French would not want Italy to have them and they did not and so vice versa.\n\nThere is naval logic for you.\n\nWhat made a lot more sense, was the arguments over cruisers and destroyers and submarines.\n\nSee MAP.\n\nToulon is just east of the bulge on the Riviera. You see where La Spezia is? The French argued for 2,500 ton destroyers as leaders. They got 1600 ton destroyers. The French did get 5.25 inch bore diameter guns. The British wanted 4.7 inch bore diameter guns limitations. The French also joined the Americans on the torpedo question. The Italians sided with the Japanese in the one startling difference of lockstep Franco-Italian opinion. Go figure. Anyway, the Italians and the Japanese also pressed for the 600 ton destroyer tonnage cap exemption. THAT was an error that the others let slip through.\n\nPost by miletus12 on\n\nTreaty fallout from the American point of view: 1922 to 1930.\n\nHow does one answer the question of the aircraft carrier clauses in this alternate treaty?\n\nYou amswer it with what knowledge the people of the time knew or would have known with their experience, either real or as described in this timeline.\n\nName ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.Lexington class\n\nBuilders................................Fore River Shipyard' New York Shipbuilding Corporation\n\nOperators.............................United States Navy\n\nPreceded by.........................

In the century since the Navy first started experimenting with shipboard takeoffs and landings, analysts have debated the merits versus the weaknesses of aircraft carriers.\n\nDetractors maintain that carriers are too costly and too vulnerable, while proponents have held that the big flattops have consistently proven their worth and will remain the key to sea power well into the future. This battle over carriers has been raging in the pages of the U.S. Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine for decades:\n\nDeveloping the Aircraft Carrier\n\nSeptember, 1922\n\n“All the principal admiralties of the world are paying marked attention to the provision of aircraft carriers, a type which is now regarded as only second in importance to the capital ship, some naval experts both here and in the United States believing it to be even more indispensable.” – Naval and Military Record, 19 July 1922\n\nAt this break, in the real history, the Americans had planned on building a small purpose designed aircraft carrier, something along the lines of the Zeppelin-killer, HIJMS Hosho. (See photo).\n\nImperial Japanese Navy aircraft carrier Hōshō conducts tests in Tokyo Bay in December 1922.\n\nUnknown author - Kure Maritime Museum, Japanese Naval Warship Photo Album: Aircraft carrier and Seaplane carrier, Supervisory editor: Kazushige Todaka, p. 12.\n\nIn the real history, as a result of negotiations, the Americans and the Japanese were allowed to keep their \"experiments\" as training ships, while they could each take two capital ships building on the weighs and convert them into aircraft carriers, to \"match\" existent or planned British construction permitted by the actual Washington Treaty. Akagi and Amagi were the Japanese candidates. They were monsters, even by the Lexington class standards.\n\nThe British would be stuck with Argus as their \"experiment\" and would have Eagle and Hermes and the three \"Curiosities\" (Courageous Class) as their core naval aviation afloat strength.\n\nIn the alternate timeline treaty, the Americans can either keep their first four battleships or opt to build their six \"battle cruisers\" as aircraft carriers. With the limitations and knowledge they had, they will in this timeline build all six Lexingtons, and through most of the 1930s, regret that decision as each flattop costs 4X the cost of a battleship to crew, logistically support, and maintain. It appears for most of that decade, that the trade in gun-line firepower for about 400 ineffective airplanes might have been a bad bargain, even if the 4 scrapped and or demoted battleships were pieces of junk.\n\nSeagoing Aircraft\n\nNovember, 1924\n\n“At the time of the Washington Conference the only aircraft carriers afloat were a few experimental craft converted from other types. Had that gathering been a disarmament conference, as it is so persistently regarded, the simple and logical thing to do would have been to scrap the few carriers already built and forbid more. It was recognized that air warfare is more susceptible of barbarous abuse than submarine warfare.”\n\nStrategic Value of the Aircraft Carrier\n\nJanuary, 1925\n\n“The arrival of the aircraft carrier offers material for speculation as to its spheres of usefulness. There is scarcely any room for doubt that is has definitely arrived, as a formidable weapon of offense and defense; there has been no spectacular debut, such as established the submarine as a commerce destroyer, because, of course, there has been no set of circumstances to render its rapid development an imperative necessity for national preservation.”\n\nAirplane Carriers\n\nMay, 1925\n\nThe cover of the May 1942 issue of Popular Mechanics.\n\n“The naval carriers of airplanes are limited in operations to navigable waters. The carrier airships would not be limited by sea or land. The naval carriers are subject to land, sea, or air attack. The airships would be subject only to air attack.” “But there is a need of economy and efficiency in providing for the national defense. If airships are better than naval vessels for carrying airplanes, they should be used.”\n\nAircraft Carriers – An American Viewpoint\n\nAugust, 1928\n\n“In effectiveness there must be little to choose between the airplane carrier Lexington, which has just broken speed records on a run from California to Honolulu, and her sister ship, the Saratoga. Each of these carriers has accommodations for seventy-six planes. British critics have said that this is putting too many eggs in on basket. Theoretically that may be so, since it is as easy to bomb a carrier as any other large ship of war. But two things would favor the Lexington: the great number of planes she could use to defend herself, and her high speed.”\n\nCovered Wagons of the Sea\n\nNovember, 1931\n\n“The airplane carrier has become an indispensable type of vessel to any fleet. With its brood of planes and its high speeds it has the greatest potential strength of any fighting ship in the world.”\n\nThe Need for Additional Aircraft Carriers\n\nJuly, 1932\n\nUSS Saratoga (CV-3) landing planes in 1935. US Navy Photo\n\n“The aircraft carrier, a sort of floating nest for winged guns, is a craft of comparatively recent development, and we are only just beginning to realize how valuable these ships can be. At the time of the Washington naval conference so little was known regarding their usefulness that it was believed that 135,000 tons of these ships would be all that any nation would need or would ever build. The potency of the modern airplane has since shown how wrong that estimate was.”\n\nLet’s Try a New Weapon\n\nMay, 1941\n\n“The aircraft carrier, which is the Navy’s primary means of exerting air power at sea, imposes further restrictions upon the performance characteristics of the planes which must operate from them. The lack of space for landing and take-off is compensated for by other means, but the relatively unhampered shore-based landplane enjoys a considerable superiority over is carrier-based counterpart in almost every respect. The desirability of operating higher performance aircraft at sea is obvious. But how are we to get them there? This is clearly the role for the rigid airship. It alone can satisfy the desirable but not quite attainable conditions unfulfilled in the problem of exerting air power at sea by other approaches.”\n\nAircraft Carriers, Dive Bombers, and Torpedo Planes\n\nOctober, 1942\n\n“[The] thesis that with the increasing range of land-based army bombers aircraft carriers will become obsolete as they are forced to operate within that range will simply not hold water. They are already operating practically with impunity where land-based bombers can and have reached them. As fighter aircraft become more and more effective the carrier will have stronger and stronger aerial protection and the job for the attacking bombers will become harder and harder. Our large carrier building program is sound indeed and will give us complete control of the oceans of the world.”\n\nThe Aircraft Carrier – The Backbone of Aero-Sea Warfare\n\nDecember, 1942\n\n“[T]he war was started with all the world’s navies thinking in terms of Jutland and the battleship as the principal weapon – the aircraft carrier was an untried weapon. It is an untried weapon no longer and the Navy that is going to win this war is the Navy that thinks in terms of Midway and the aircraft carrier. Air power had not displaced sea power – air power is sea power.”\n\n“In Any Operation” – Aircraft Carriers\n\nMarch, 1955\n\n“The recent development of the H-bomb has cause many well-intentioned persons with limited naval or air experience to advise us, in effect, to abandon control of the sea. Actually the advent of the H-bomb should make the fast carrier task force even more effective. While carrier aircraft can use the H-bomb in attacking fixed shore targets with greater destructiveness than ever, the task force has only to use wider dispersions to minimize the damaging effect of the H-bomb and mobility and speed to avoid radio-active fall-out. The relative gain appears to be on the side of the mobile base of unpredeterminable position, the aircraft carrier.”\n\nA Case for the Attack Carrier in the Missile Age\n\nJuly, 1958\n\n“The fact that the USSR has no aircraft carrier does not militate against the value; for the Soviets would be hard pressed to operate carriers from their land- and sometimes ice-locked bases. It may be, realizing the potency of this weapon, that Russia fears to lend credibility to it be embarking on such a venture at this time in history.” “The aircraft carrier has been attacked as a bad investment because of it alleged vulnerability in the missile age, a vulnerability which precludes spending large sums of money. First of all, nothing is absolutely invulnerable. Everything is, under certain conditions. Of course carriers can be sunk, if they can be found, fought, and hit directly. Men can be killed; yet we do not argue that, ipso facto, we should not out money into training a soldier. Aircraft can be shot down, but we do not advocate abandonment of all aircraft.”\n\nFuture of the Carrier?\n\nAugust, 1959\n\n“It would seem to me that for the attack carrier to be effective in time of nuclear unlimited war, our country would have to keep prohibitive number of carrier task forces on, or near, station. How many missile submarines could be kept on patrol for the same amount of money?”\n\nThe Attack Carrier – Mobile Might\n\nMay, 1961\n\n“Mobile, flexible and versatile – these are the words that Navy proponents apply to the modern attack aircraft carrier. Obsolete, vulnerable and exorbitantly expensive are adjectives that are applied on occasions by others. Perhaps no single weapon system or element of military strength has been the subject of as much controversy and dispute as have aircraft carriers in the nearly 40 years they have been part of our seapower.”\n\nLone Carriers…Fact or Fancy?\n\nApril, 1962\n\n“Some iconoclastic ideas of carrier operation may allow full realization of the potential of the nuclear-powered Enterprise and her combat air group never before available to any navy. It is feasible to operate the carrier independently as a single ship? And how effective would this utilization be? The mere statement of such a suggestion may, of course, cause some professional navy readers to stop reading at this point. New concepts must necessarily involve some shattering of old ones.”\n\nDiminishing Returns in the CVA\n\nAugust, 1964\n\n“In our carriers, there is a never-ending battle for space. Our advertising, ever-changing technology continues to create shortcomings in the availability of support and maintenance equipment and the attendant space requirements. The jet/missile/electronic revolution as applied to carrier-based aircraft, points up the many facets of this problem. The sophistication and complexity attained is gradually creating a loss of efficiency in maintaining these combat aircraft. Furthermore, future requirements indicate an even greater need for space.”\n\nCarrier Air and Vietnam…an assessment\n\nOctober, 1967\n\n“Not too many years or even months ago, it was a popular pastime for amateur military strategists to speak and write words that questioned the U.S. investment in in aircraft carriers in the U.S. Navy. These capital ships, termed “supercarriers” in the press, were considered to be great white elephants, vulnerable to whatever force an enemy chose to throw at them; costly dinosaurs that plodded the seas at 30 knots in an era when air speeds above a thousand knots were commonplace.” “Today, as the continuous pounding from the three attack carriers at ‘Yankee Station’ grinds on, this criticism is seldom heard. Instead, there are repeated requests for more carriers on the line, and expressions of approbation from quarters once opposed to the carrier weapon system.”\n\nCarriers Sail On\n\nJune, 1989\n\n“Navies also offer reach into otherwise inaccessible areas, putting fighters, strike aircraft, and accompanying escorts into positions to mount offensive operations. Because public opposition to some types of weapons is growing, carriers may even become the only available home for some necessary elements of the deterrent arsenal. Fleets with their own air cover and offensive capability will also continue to carry the capability to confront an opponent with the threat of a protracted war. Without carriers, U. S. leaders would, for the foreseeable future, have only the options of nuclear escalation or surrender and isolation in response to any successful Soviet conventional probe on the Eurasian rimland. Carriers would not only be essential to maintain forward-based forces in a long war, but if the early stages of that war were lost those carriers and SAC remain the only way of holding the ring and taking the war to the aggressor.”\n\nThe Last Days of Carrier-Based Aviation?\n\nJanuary, 1999\n\n“The bell-tolls announcing the slow death of carrier-based aviation were sounded on 20 August 1998 by the 75 Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. In terms of naval history, the 20th century has been the era of the aircraft carrier. The carrier spearheaded the victory in the Pacific during World War II, played decisive roles during Korea, Vietnam, and the Gulf War, and has long been the hallmark of America’s prowess on the high seas. As we enter the new millennium it will become more and more obvious, however, that technology that earlier favored the aircraft carrier will dictate its demise.”\n\nGet the Carriers!\n\nSeptember, 2007\n\n“There’s a misconceived belief among them that the need for air power is on the wane. One basic line of argument is that surface ships with missiles can replace carriers in littoral attack. Branching out, critics contend that since the revolution in strike warfare increased precision strike capacity by an order of magnitude, then micro-air wings on small carriers can do the job. It’s all framed in lurking suspicions about the vulnerability of carriers and a vague desire not to put all the eggs in one basket.”\n\nOpportunity at Hand: New Roles for Carriers\n\nJune, 2008\n\n“The carrier debate should not be related to that of its historic battleship predecessor, nor should it devolve into an inter-service domain supremacy or roles-and-mission budget battle. It should be viewed simply as an opportunity to collaborate on leveraging extant joint force capabilities to enhance strategic agility, thus providing the joint force commanders with more options to successfully meet growing operational challenges”\n\nIt Takes a Carrier: Naval Aviation and the Hybrid Fight\n\nSeptember, 2009\n\n“The final argument in favor of continued aircraft carrier construction might be the fact that everybody else seems to be building them. Last November, an official in China’s Ministry of National Defense mentioned for the first time in a public venue the possibility of his nation acquiring aircraft carriers. Around the same time, Admiral Hu Yanlin, former political commissar of the People’s Liberation Army Navy, stated ‘China has the capability to build aircraft carriers, and should do so.’ His country has already purchased three carriers built by the former Soviet Union and one built by Australia. It has also been reported that, since 1987, China has been training PLA pilots to one day command aircraft carriers. The United Kingdom, Russia, and India have all shown a keen interest in building carriers.\n\nFortress at Sea? The Carrier Invulnerability Myth\n\nJanuary, 2010\n\n“The recently renewed debate over aircraft carrier requirements has focused mainly on the factors of cost and utility. These issues notwithstanding, analysts often overlook or understate the carriers’ inherent vulnerabilities. Regardless of the number of carriers national leadership decides to maintain, because they remain the U.S. Navy’s preeminent capital ship and a symbol of American global power and prestige, they are a potential key target for both unconventional and conventional adversaries. Carrier proponents, however, universally seem to accept on faith alone the premise that a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (CVN) is essentially invulnerable.”\n\nTwilight of the $UPERfluous Carrier\n\nMay, 2011\n\n“Continuing to invest in platforms such as the supercarrier—which are expensive to build, cost-prohibitive to operate, and increasingly vulnerable in anti-access/area denied environments—is to repeat the mistakes of the battleship admirals who failed to recognize air power’s potential in the 1930s.”\n\n‘Responsive and Relevant’\n\nFebruary, 2014\n\n“If value is defined as worth, importance, or usefulness, then it can be argued that over the course of the past 100 years no single asset in the U.S. military arsenal has provided more value than the aircraft carrier—nuclear-powered (CVN) for the last 50 years—and its embarked air wing (CVW). The integrated CVN/CVW remains the most effective instrument for shaping the national military strategy, with proven applicability across the range of military operations from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) to high-end maritime strike warfare.”\n\nToo Big to Sink\n\nMay, 2017\n\n“The aircraft carrier has had a long and illustrious history, but it cannot continue forever. Instead of waiting for budgetary challenges or an enemy combat success to force it to radically change its structure, the U.S. Navy should begin the transition on its own terms today. By building larger numbers of smaller combatants, relying more on missiles and less on expensive aircraft, and acknowledging trends in scouting technology, the Navy can take advantage of carriers’ many attributes without being completely dependent on them. The alternative is for the Navy to continue to rely on a ship so vital that it has become too big to sink.”\n\nThat was a short synopsis of the debate after 1930 down to the present.\n\nPost by miletus12 on\n\nARTICLE\n\nStrategic Failures Are Often Failures of Imagination\n\nThe Washington Naval Treaties had different effects on interwar innovation in Britain, Japan, and the United States—and their abilities to wage war.\n\nBy Kori Schake\n\nJuly 2021 Proceedings Vol. 147/7/1,421\n\nThe Washington Naval Accords of 1922, an interlinked series of eight treaties, addressed the drivers of geopolitical competition in East Asia by constraining the militaries of the major powers, rupturing the Anglo-Japanese alliance, opening China to trade, and ending Japanese control of Shandong, China. The administration of President Warren G. Harding believed the Washington Treaties would prevent war, reduce the cost of the Navy, and have more public appeal than continued naval building programs. France’s government summarized the treaties’ purpose: “The pretended disarmament of the accords of Washington is not a disarmament of peace, but a disarmament of war.” The powers negotiated, France believed, “with the idea of being able, if the occasion arises, to make war in the best conditions and cheaper.”1\n\nThe treaties limited warship types, tonnage, and armaments as well as expansion of shore facilities. In particular, the numbers of battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers for each country were subject to numerical limits; CRUISERS, submarines and destroyers were instead limited by magnitude to 10,000-ton displacements (CRUISERS). But the restrictions came alongside treaties that gave each major power something: Britain, the largest fleet affordably; the United States, an end to the Anglo-Japanese defense agreement and naval parity with Britain; and Japan, international stature and prevention of new defenses on U.S. and British holdings in Asia.\n\nBy setting fixed ratios for the size and numbers of capital ships, the Washington Naval Accords advantaged innovation in new forms of maritime power. The navies of the United States and Japan accelerated in creative ways; Britain’s Royal Navy did not. The respective successes and failures provide insight into why and how militaries innovate—and how to think about the challenges of innovation in the present.\n\nBritain. To the extent the accords were deleterious to Britain, it is mostly because the Royal Navy innovated less urgently and interestingly than the United States or Japan.\n\nAfter World War I, the United Kingdom still had the world’s paramount naval force, but the United States and Japan were rising fast; postwar Britain was unable to match their naval spending and conscious of its evaporating hegemony. Allied with Japan since 1902, the British were more concerned with U.S. ambitions. Britain’s military in 1921 confronted “prolonged political hostility” domestically because of World War I casualties, humiliating failures at Gallipoli and Jutland, and popular disarmament campaigns.2\n\nThe restraints in the Washington Naval Treaties had a disproportionate effect on the Royal Navy. Fleet reductions in the treaties were greatest for Britain, which had to scrap 20 extant capital ships. Hulls already laid for Nelson-class ships had to be redesigned for smaller displacements to remain within Britain’s apportionment. (These would come to be referred to as “cherry tree classes” because they were “chopped down” by Washington). In constraining dreadnought battleships, the Washington Naval Treaties checked Britain’s strongest suit.\n\nThe British government accepted the 1:1 ratio of maritime power with the United States and conceded its alliance with Japan because it saw no way to fund the alternative. U.S. naval planners thought the Washington Naval Accords left the Royal Navy superior in fighting strength, but London disagreed. Even decades later, an eminent British historian described the treaties as “one of the major catastrophes of English history.”3\n\nBritain expended most of its operational and doctrinal effort repairing failures of fleet operations at Jutland, increasing independent maneuvering and prioritizing contact with the enemy. Historian David MacGregor concludes: “Surface combat was the Navy’s own idea of its reason for existence, and consequently received the highest priority throughout the interwar period.”4\n\nHMS Nelson was the first of two ships in a class that was redesigned to comply with the Washington Naval Treaties. Among their nicknames was “the cherry tree class,” because they were “chopped down” by Washington.

But perhaps because of its humiliation, its studies uniformly concluded that the invention of the machine gun, modern artillery, and aircraft made amphibious assaults impossible. As a result, the army and navy developed neither landing craft nor procedures for naval gunfire or air support of a landing force.5\n\nBritain’s services remained intensely parochial, suffering from a “debilitating complacency” about amphibious (and antisubmarine) warfare.6 As late as 1938, the Royal Navy insisted, “The Admiralty cannot visualize any particular combined operation taking place and are not therefore prepared to devote any considerable sum of money” to studying it.7 Christopher Bell captures the culture exactly: “Naval decision-makers never wavered in their conviction that sea power had always been, and should ever remain, the preeminent weapon in Britain’s arsenal, and they instinctively accepted the idea of a ‘British way’ in warfare.”8 Nor did the British establishment appreciate the “anti-intellectual aspects of such a cohesive culture.”9 As a result, when faced with the most demanding reconsideration of the three naval powers, Britain innovated the least.\n\nIn his relentless history of the corrosion of British naval power from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I, The Rules of the Game, Andrew Gordon concludes that agile adapters win wars, writing: “If doctrine is not explicitly taught, vested interests will probably ensure that wrong doctrine is ambiently learnt.”10 Britain’s record of tepid innovation in the 1921–35 treaty period of naval armament constraints suggests Gordon’s criticism remained trenchant long after his period of study.\n\nThe United States. The least economically constrained treaty party in the 1920s was the United States, its manufacturing output larger than that of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Soviet Union, Italy, and Japan combined.11 Despite how events are commonly presented today, U.S. funding for defense was not wholly deficient in the interwar period—not by comparison with Britain and Japan at the time, nor by the historical U.S. standard. As John Braeman argues, “Perhaps at no time in its history—before or since—has the United States been more secure.”12 But even before the Great Depression, commitment had waned to seeing through the naval expansion begun in 1916.13\n\nAnd threats were mounting, with Japan openly acknowledged as the pacing threat. Over U.S. objections, the World War I settlement gave to Japan Germany’s colonial possessions in the Pacific and established the prohibition against fortifications. Given Pacific distances, this was a strong advantage for Japan over Britain and the United States.14 U.S. war plans of the interwar years never solved the problem that Philippine harbors were both indispensable to wartime operations against Japan and indefensible.15 But as Williamson Murray concludes, the eventual U.S. success “rested on serious intellectual effort that came to grips with intractable problems.”16\n\nMany changes in military capabilities that would become revolutionary were pioneered in World War I—combined-arms tactics, submarine warfare, strategic bombing, carrier warfare—but interwar experimentation drove operational concepts that were essential to their effective use.17 In some cases, exercises even drove the technology, as with a 1921 S-boat experiment that revealed incapacities that were not remediable until 1939. The period of the Washington Naval Accords saw ships transition from coal to oil to increase speed and range; introduction of electrical power systems, radio, radar, and radio-controlled torpedoes; and improved elevation of turreted guns increasing firepower. Tonnage limits also spurred submarine designs to maximize cruising distance and torpedo power and encouraged improvements in ship design by requiring substitution of plastic and aluminum for heavier metals.18\n\nThe Washington Naval Accords required efficiency of the U.S. Navy. The 394 destroyers built at the end of World War I precluded construction of more for 12 years, so the Navy channeled modernization efforts into light cruisers.19 The treaty restrictions, coupled with the demands of security in East Asia, created a general atmosphere of innovation in the service.20 Even so, military historians—and the military leaders of the time—derided the unwillingness of the Presidents and Congress to fund the military more fulsomely, especially before the Depression.\n\nWhen the Naval Accords went into effect, the Navy was still in thrall to Mahan’s grand fleet actions; that changed dramatically across the accords’ duration.21 War plans evolved through the 1920s and 1930s from incompatible Army and Navy propositions to encompass combined-arms operations, Marine Corps doctrinal development of amphibious operations, island-hopping (since bases could not be reliably held), and acknowledgment of the need for unrestricted submarine warfare at least in “strategical areas.”22\n\nProfessional development and wargaming explored naval aviation as an independent strike force, and the operational navy experimented with implementing aircraft carrier concepts that increased the pace of aircraft operations, use of arresting cables, development of crash barriers, and optimization of flight deck operations.23 The experimentation was so effective that, in 1934, Rear Admiral Ernest King, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, claimed that U.S. naval aviation had “reached a degree of efficiency not equaled by any other power.”24\n\nAdmiral King proved incorrect in that assessment. The Imperial Japanese Navy innovated even more spectacularly in many ways.\n\nU.S. Marines practice amphibious assault tactics and techniques at an unidentified location in the 1930s. The United States and Imperial Japan each spent much of the 1930s developing the methods that would define their approach to defending and assaulting the islands on which so much of the Pacific war would be fought.

The Washington Accords affected Japan’s threat perceptions, national strategy, technology, military buildup, and operational concepts tested by exercises—as well as drove radicalization of the officer corps, which saw purges of accommodationist officers and even assassinations. For no other country were the effects as significant.\n\nJapan became a great power via “catch-up” industrialization through technology-transfer agreements made with Western firms and imitation of foreign products; half of those foreign firms were American.25 Britain and France supplied Japan with technology, advisors, and ships and celebrated their effectiveness during the Sino-Japanese War.26\n\nImperial Japanese Navy leaders were dedicated Mahanians; their 1918 Imperial National Defense Policy planned to take the Philippines in the initial phase of any war, then engage the United States in a decisive battle in the western Pacific.27 But they had assessed that a 70 percent ratio “assured Japan ‘a strength insufficient to attack and adequate for defense,’ and imperative as a deterrent to the United States.”28\n\nFrom its inception, attitudes about the Washington Accords were deeply divided in Japan. Japan’s objective in the negotiations was to minimize differences with Britain and especially the United States.29 Whereas Navy Minister (and active-duty Admiral) Kato Tomosaburo supported arms limits because of U.S. economic superiority, Vice Admiral Kato Kanji argued that superiority required Japan’s peacetime force to deter or conclude the war before U.S. advantages could be brought to bear. The “battle of the two Katos” resulted in acceptance of the Washington Naval Accords at the cost of military embitterment. On the day Japan accepted the treaty, Vice Admiral Kanji “was seen shouting, with tears in his eyes, ‘As far as I am concerned, war with America starts now.’”30\n\nJapan’s attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrated both Japan’s interwar innovations in carrier aviation and naval warfighting and that country’s desire to win the war with the United States quickly, before U.S. industrial might could be brought to bear. This photo was taken by a Japanese pilot during the attack.

During its time as a party to the Washington Naval Accords, Japan developed large high-speed submarines to implement the strategy and mastered night attacks by surface vessels; matured joint doctrine for amphibious operations and pioneered the first amphibious assault ships; and designed and built Nakajima Type 97 attack bombers, Aichi Type 99 dive bombers, the Zero fighter plane, rockets, dive-bombs, and advanced aerial torpedoes.32 New tactics such as the employment of the carrier task force in a box formation also allowed the massing of naval aviation for greater operational effects.33\n\nJapan respected the Washington system until 1931 and formally withdrew in 1935, setting off “the race to Pearl Harbor.”34 Williamson Murray writes, “The record of the U.S. military is far and away the most impressive of any nation in the 1920s and 1930s.”35 This undervalues the remarkable innovations Japan achieved with even more tightly constrained budgets.\n\nA Victory of Imagination\n\nSuccessful innovation requires a demanding and specific problem; organizational openness to new thinking; an ability to test and compare alternative solutions; money to develop new technology and build equipment; and leaders dedicated to forcing advantageous change into routine practice.\n\nSuch reengineering does not mean solutions will necessarily be optimal—or even correct—but without them, innovation is stifled.36 And innovation is not always the solution; as businessman Bill Turpin cautions, sometimes there will not be a silver bullet, and a whole lot of lead bullets will have to suffice.37 But faced with common constraints and a common inability to spend their way out of their problems, the militaries of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan spent 13 years grappling with how to innovate their way to success in a war over East Asia.\n\nCharles O’Reilly argues that successful organizations struggle to innovate because innovation requires challenging the culture that made for success. Successful organizations, he says, “actively try to preserve their core competencies.”38 All three great power navies were successful organizations in 1921, but the Washington Naval Accords disrupted the core competencies of all three navies. Each understood its enemies were innovating whether or not it was.\n\nTwo of the three navies found paths to success, and then those two navies fought each other. At the end of the war, both of the two Katos from Japan’s delegation to the Washington Naval Accords were proved right: U.S. economic superiority meant Japan gained advantage by accepting arms control limits on its forces, and U.S. economic superiority became decisive because the war was not quickly won by Japan.\n\nBritain’s failure was, ultimately, one of imagination; it could not imagine itself as other than what it had always been, even as Washington and especially Tokyo imagined new ways to fight. The U.S. military innovated before the war just enough to hold its own until those economic advantages could be brought to bear. Today, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps should ask themselves whether the current force more closely approximates the one that burst into being during the Washington Naval Accords years—or the Royal Navy that remained so beholden to its past successes and ashamed of its failures that it stifled the creativity and experimentation needed to face the looming challenges. It may be propitious that (as Andrew Gordon notes) then–Vice Admiral John Richardson encouraged the Naval Institute Press to publish the 2013 edition of The Rules of the Game: Jutland and British Naval Command.\n\n1.

I changed the naval geography by suggesting a Philippine Islands in a Cuban type \"protectorate\" status and a Theodore Rooseveltian type America more aggressive and successful in the Spanishj American War and WWI, with a more nuanced Micronesian presence in the Pacific. That was a bit of cheek on my part, because I always thought that McKinley and Roosevelt handled the Philippine Revolution the wrong way. It was worse than what happwened to Cuba, but it could have been better. The pieces for a Philippine self governing and associative partner were there. All we had to do, was \"cut a deal\".\n\nSome might think that is funny. If it was possible, and it surely was, then it is not funny.\n\nBut as to innovation and to treaty effects. In this alternate timeline, I incorporated a few London Naval Treaty clauses to spice up the 1922 alternate Washington treaty. I also added a guided weapon clause *(the torpedo limitation) to reflect a more modern mindset about limiting effectors as much as launch platform characteristics and assumed that both the British^1 and the Japanese^2 would CHEAT on both as they did.\n\n^1 The British built their Town class heavy cruisers with mounting straps for applique belt armor to increase their cruiser side protection. Did not work at all, but the cheat was there, for WE noticed it and created superheavyweight shells to defeat it.\n\n^2 The Japanese bored out their guns and enlarged them on their battleships. They supercharged their propellant charges and in their modernizations easily exceeded the 3,000 tons \"pad\" allowed to rearrange existent protection allowed in the London Naval treaty for battleships. The Kongos grew fat by 5000 tons and doubled their watts.\n\nThe interesting thing to me is how would the Americans \"cheat\"? I supplied a real history example in the deepening of the gunpits on the real Standazrds and the replacement of the real defective engine sets with the better ones intended for the South Dakota (1923) class iintended and subsequently installed into the \"Big 5\". I also postulated that the Americans would complete all of their Lexingtons and accept a reduced battleline tonnage as a result of hypothetical WWI experience in the uselessness of battleships.\n\nMy assessment of Jutland, by the way, in that context was absolutely historical and real. The RN would be Jutland fixated as would be the USN gunclubbers. This would blinker in this altered treaty environment as well, hence the failure to develope submarine technology or a defense against it.\n\nPost by miletus12 on\n\nSome more real history; this goes to some crucial 1920s mistakes in how a navy went about its personnel management.\n\nHISTORICAL EVENTS | Aug. 20, 2021\n\nThe Investigations\n\nOn 6 December 1941 a 14-part message was sent from Tokyo to the Japanese ambassador to the United States. The entire message was to be presented to President Roosevelt at approximately the same time as the attack on Pearl Harbor, breaking off relations between Japan and the United States. The fourteenth part of the message arrived somewhat later than the thirteenth. In that same vein, we offer the fourteenth installment of our series on Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 7 December 1941 Japanese naval aircraft swept in on an unsuspecting U.S. Pacific Fleet and Army in the Hawaiian Islands and destroyed many American ships and aircraft. In a little over 2 hours, 18 warships--including 8 battleships--and over 160 aircraft were knocked out of action. Japan's eastern flank secured, its forces would rampage through the rest of the Pacific virtually unopposed.\n\nWithin days of the disaster, calls resounded from the public, press, and the government itself for an investigation into how and why such a thing could happen. To many, it was not just the magnitude of the defeat; the extraordinary unpreparedness of U.S. forces in Hawaii seemed almost criminal. Someone had to pay.\n\nHowever, fixing responsibility for the debacle at Pearl Harbor was complicated by the revelations about the MAGIC decryptions. MAGIC was the covername assigned to the intelligence garnered from the decryptions and translations of Japanese diplomatic messages. From mid-1940 until the attack on Pearl Harbor, American cryptologists had read the most sensitive Japanese diplomatic messages and had kept President Roosevelt informed of every Japanese diplomatic and political policy turn. But MAGIC didn't tell Roosevelt and other government leaders what the Japanese military was planning. Those ciphers and codes had largely resisted the efforts of American cryptologists to break them. Any investigation of the Pearl Harbor disaster would be as much a revelation of what we DIDN'T know as of what we DID know.\n\nThe issue of culpability would not be settled in one investigation; in fact, for many people it was never really settled at all. Ultimately, EIGHT hearings would be held over the course of World War II, culminating in a joint congressional investigation beginning on 15 November 1945. What follows is a brief summary of each.\n\nThe Roberts Commission, 18 December 1941-23 December 1942:\n\nThis commission, set by presidential executive order, and chaired by Owen Roberts, a justice of the Supreme Court, was charged to determine the facts of the Japanese attack and establish if any dereliction of duty had occurred. MAGIC was discussed, but who received it and the details of the reports were not covered. Not surprisingly, the hearings were hostile to the area commanders, General Walter Short and Admiral Husband Kimmel. The major political and military figures in Washington were exonerated.\n\nThe Hart Inquiry, 15 February 1944-15 June 1944:\n\nThe Navy Department ordered Admiral Thomas Hart, former commander of the Asiatic Fleet, to conduct a one-man inquiry on Pearl Harbor so that important testimony would not be lost by hazard of war.\n\nThe Army Pearl Harbor Board, 20 July 1944-20 October 1944:\n\nIn response to an act of Congress on 13 July 1944, the army's adjutant general convened hearings which took testimony from 151 witnesses. MAGIC evidence was taken only during the last week of the hearings. Surprisingly, and perhaps because radio intercept information was downplayed, the board censured Generals George Marshall and Leonard Gerow (War Plans Division) for not fully advising General Short of the situation.\n\nThe Naval Court of Inquiry, 24 July 1944-19 October 1944:\n\nA court of inquiry was convened in response to the same congressional act of 13 July 1944. The hearings made full use of MAGIC, though the testimony on it was classified and kept from the public. The findings of the inquiry completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel. Instead, Admiral Harold Stark, chief of naval operations at the time of Pearl Harbor, was blamed for failing to adequately advise Kimmel of the critical situation prior to the attack.\n\nThe Clausen Investigation, 23 November 1944-12 September 1945:\n\nBy personal direction of the secretary of war, a one-man inquiry conducted by Major Henry Clausen was detailed to obtain testimony to supplement the Army Board's completed investigation.\n\nThe Hewitt Inquiry, 14 May 1945-11 July 1945:\n\nSimilar to the Clausen investigation, the navy secretary ordered Admiral Kent Hewitt to continue the naval inquiry.\n\nThe Clarke Investigation, 14-16 September 1944 and 13 July 1945-4 August 1945:\n\nThe secretary of war ordered Colonel Carter Clarke, head of the Military Intelligence Division, which, in turn, oversaw the army's COMINT efforts, to investigate the handling of communications by the military intelligence division prior to Pearl Harbor.\n\nOn 15 November 1945, the Joint Congressional Committee Investigation into the Pearl Harbor disaster held its first session. Established by a Joint Congressional Resolution, this investigation promised to be the most thorough possible. The Truman administration released all of the relevant classified documents, including the MAGIC translations. All of the participants still alive, with the exception of the seriously ill Secretary of War Stimson, were examined. In 1946 the committee's findings were released in forty volumes. A single volume report contained twelve findings that apportioned the blame among all the principals: Hawaiian area commanders and the War and Navy Departments. A minority report also censured Roosevelt but concluded, like the majority findings, that Secretary Stimson, Secretary Knox, Generals Marshall and Gerow, and Admiral Stark, as well as General Short and Admiral Kimmel, were culpable for the disaster.\n\nThe hope that the investigations would finally determine who was responsible was never fulfilled. Although many figures in Washington were blamed, Kimmel and Short would bear the onus for the disaster. But the fifty years following the investigations would see a stream of \"revisionist\" histories and rationalizations for the major figures, such as Admiral Kimmel. Conspiracies to suppress intelligence by Churchill, Roosevelt, and others would be \"exposed.\" Other historians would \"discover\" new intelligence that existed which would have saved Pearl Harbor. However, the phoenix-like nature of the Pearl Harbor controversy proved only what one of Admiral Kimmel's lawyers wrote to him in 1953: \"Pearl Harbor never dies, and no living person has seen the end of it.\"\n\nI would draw particular attention to future ADM Harold Stark.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and into the mid 1930s, he served in Washington D.C. as the Naval Aide to the Secretary of the Navy. His military career from there led him to become Chief of the Bureau of Ordinance from 1934 to 1937, where he spent his time organizing and structuring the Navy. He also had shown his natural ability of being a successful diplomat, and this particular skill became a highlight of his naval career. In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt promoted him to Chief Naval Operations at the onset of World War II.\n\nFurther:\n\nAs Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark oversaw the expansion of the United States Navy as the threat of the Axis Powers grew throughout Europe. Through his proposed “Two-Ocean Navy Bill” that was granted by Congress on July 19th,1940, the policy allowed for a 70% increase in navy forces with the ability to relocate 30% of the funding as needed by himself and the President. He would later take over as the commander of the U.S. forces in Europe, and step down from his position as Chief of Naval Operations in March 1942 following a controversial miscommunication that some historians believe led to the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Some historians believe Stark is to blame over the failure to provide sufficient information of the imminent attack on Pearl Harbor, and changing the wording of Admiral Richmond K. Turner’s warning over a possible attack to less threatening sounding language. Other historians argue that the blame fell directly on the Director of War Plans, Admiral Richmond K. Turner. Turner’s blame is thought to have originated from the failure to send this imminent threat to Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, The Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet stationed in Hawaii, and provide sufficient time to prepare for a surprise attack.\n\nThe points you should take away from this information, about Stark of the 1920s, are threefold.\n\na. Stark was a careerist politician ladder climber who evaded the teaditonal USN ship-shore-ship-shore-career cycle to test out an officer's ability to lead as well as to manage.\n\nb. Stark never schooled through the Navy education system to learn \"grand strategy\" and the \"operational art\".\n\nc. Stark was ignorant of the technical tracks, that sea service would have driven home to him in day to day ship operations.\n\nAnd yet this utter fool was made Chief of the Bureau of Ordnanmce. When was that?\n\nRear Admiral Claude C. Bloch, 1923–1927.......................not responsible for the mess, and proved competent. He started the new torpedo programs.\n\nRear Admiral William D. Leahy, 1927–1931......................imbecile; failed to advance any of the urgent projects that Bu-Ord had in hand.\n\nRear Admiral Edgar B. Larimer, 1931–1934......................knew what he was doing. Advanced the 1.1 inch AAA gun and the torpedoes program. Brought the 5 / 38 gun into service after exhaustive tests. Solved or at least pointed out the shell dispersion and duds problem with the main USN naval artillery.\n\nRear Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark, 1934–1937..............expletive deleted. Why? He failed to TEST the ordnance or follow up Larimer's work. Hid the torpedo program failures from the USN operating forces, the Congress and the President.\n\nThat goes beyond 1930. Why was it important in reference to the Washington Treaty?\n\nThe Mark 14 Torpedo.\n\nTHE MARK 14 TORPEDO — WHEN JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING GOES WRONG, EVEN THE TESTING\n\nby: Al Williams\n\nI am a fan of the saying that those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it. After all, humans have been building things for a number of centuries and we should learn from the engineers of the past. While you can learn a lot studying successes, sometimes — maybe even most of the time — we learn more from studying failure. The US Navy’s Mark 14 torpedo certainly has a lot to teach us.\n\nThe start of the story was the WWI-era Mark 10 torpedo which was fine for its day, but with faster destroyers and some additional data about how to best sink enemy ships it seemed necessary to build a new torpedo that would be faster, carry more explosive charge, and use a new method of detonation. Work started in 1931 with a $143,000 budget which may sound laughable today, but that was a lot of coin in the 1930s. Adjusted for inflation, that’s about $2.5 million.\n\nCHANGES NEEDED\n\nData from the earlier war indicated that you got the most effect by detonating explosives underneath a ship. This was especially true since warships were adding torpedo blisters to absorb strikes along the hull. With a contact fuse, you would tend to explode on the hull somewhere along the perimeter of the ship’s envelope and a ship — especially one with blisters — was more likely to survive the strike.\n\nContact triggers were out and instead the torpedo would read the change in the magnetic field caused by the enemy ship’s hull and detonate under the ship, splitting the target in half. Unfortunately, the Earth’s magnetic field varies based on location and this made the new detonators unreliable. Some estimates are that the torpedo had at least a 50% fail rate in combat. In 1942, out of 800 torpedoes fired, 80% failed to do their job.\n\nIn the 1930s, this torpedo was as complicated as you could get. Clearly, you’d want to test this new design pretty exhaustively, right? The cost of the torpedo and some political wrangling thwarted testing that would have uncovered many problems. Cutbacks meant there was only one company making the torpedo, at a slow rate, and with little oversight. In 1937 the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island employed 3,000 workers working three shifts and still only produced 1.5 torpedoes per day.\n\nThe the Navy’s Bureau of Ordnance not only produced a bad design but then failed to test. The real root cause for the high failure rate was this lack of testing.\n\nCOMPLEX HARDWARE: THE MARK 6 MAGNETIC INFLUENCE DETONATOR\n\nThe Mark 14 steam torpedo had the option of using a traditional contact detonator, or the magnetically triggered Mark 6 exploder, which was a marvel in its day.\n\nParadoxically, the Mark 6 was so secret that its manual was never printed and the original was locked away in a safe where it didn’t do anyone any good. It derived from German magnetic mines and that might have been part of the motivation for the secrecy. Oddly enough, you can read some of the manuals online now. The Mark 14 maintenance manual is pretty interesting.\n\nDespite the promise of the new technology, in war crews noticed the new torpedoes were either exploding too early or going too deep. The Bureau of Ordnance dismissed reports that the torpedoes were not effective, blaming the crews for not operating the devices correctly.\n\nTHAT NOBODY CAN DENY\n\nThe little official testing conducted before production was done with a light dummy torpedo. When post-production testing finally took place they showed the torpedo was running deep. Naturally the dummy didn’t sink as far as a fully-operational torpedo in the previous tests.\n\nFaced with direct evidence that the torpedoes were failing, the Bureau finally conceded there was a design problem with the depth mechanism. It would turn out that in addition to the depth problem, the magnetic detonator was too sensitive. There was a backup contact detonator, but it used a firing pin that often failed when it hit enemy ships. That was odd since the system had worked on earlier torpedoes.\n\nThe Mark 14 was faster, so striking a ship involved more force than before and it was enough to bend pins in the firing pin block.^1 The designers apparently noticed this early in the design and added stronger springs, but as the torpedo’s maximum speed increased the new springs were not enough and there was no further testing.\n\nOne quick fix for the firing pin problem was to machine down lightweight aluminum alloy to make a stronger and lighter firing pin. Oddly enough, some of the material they used was from Japanese planes shot down over Pearl Harbor.\n\n^1 What actually happened was the guide cage bent and the pin jammed in the travel before it hit the shotgun shell that was supposed to set off the ignition charge. The heavy pin traveled too slowly before the cage bent due to impact. The USN operating forces in the field once, they understood the problem, greased the guide cage with graphite, and milled a new pin out of aluminum, and installed a much stronger spring as a driver. The difference was only about a millisecond in time difference, but the faster travelling pin worked as intended before the guides distorted the from the impact and jammed it in mid career. M.\n\nPASSING THE BUCK (Stark was the second to do it. Leahy was first.)\n\nThis is a sad story that has been repeated many times since then. Budget and schedule pressures short cut technically sound judgment. Then no one wants to admit that there is a problem because that would look bad. As engineers, we should sound the alarm when things are not done right and management should be willing to take a hard look at the cost of doing it right versus the cost of having to redo it later.\n\nThe hero of this story, by the way, is Charles “Swede” Momsen. He was an engineer who had proposed the submarine rescue chamber and developed the Momsen lung, which was not entirely successful. When the commander of the Southwest Pacific submarine fleet decided to solve the problems with the Mark 14, he turned to Swede. He carried out the tests that should have been done during development.\n\nThe other heroes are the crews that managed to work around these problems as best they could. Despite the Bureau ordering the exploders to have painted screw heads to deter tampering, crews found matching paint and removed them anyway. We’ve seen a lot of ingenuity like that during war. Not the least, of course, is hacking foxhole radios.\n\nWe know not everything we work on is a life or death project. But when people do depend on your work to either behave or not behave in a certain way, saving money on testing often goes badly in the worst way. That’s the lesson of the Mark 14, the Mars Climate Orbiter, autonomous vehicle crashes, or a failed software update bricking devices.\n\nDrachinifel still gets most of it wrong. M.\n\nAs you might expect, this story has been told many times. I liked [Drachinifel’s] video about the history of the Mark 14. Some people don’t think the real impact of the torpedo issues were as great as reported, but I imagine if you were on a sub crew effectively firing blanks, you might not agree. [Military History Not Visualized] has an interesting video about the real impact of the failure on the course of the war.\n\nNow how did the Japanese achieve under-keel detonations successfully?\n\nThe Japanese had this curious custom. They assigned a line officer and a school trained technician to their weapon projects and made it clear that the price of failure would be significant as in \"loss of face\". Rear Admiral Kaneji Kishimoto and Captain Toshihide Asakuma.were the fortunate people assigned to make the Type 93 and Type 95 work in 1928. Since they both survived the experience, it could be assumed that they made sure the Japanese torpedo worked.^2\n\n^2 Remarkably, they sort of failed. In the many destroyer brawls the USN and IJN fought, the Japanese only sank 22 US ships and only 1 of those was a capital ship in surface combat. (USS Hornet after she was abandoned as a wreck. USS Wasp and USS Yorktown were I-boat kills due to post battle stupidity.) Going the other way, once the Mark 14 and Mark 15 was fixed, the tally was about 49 IJN ships with 3 battleships, 3 aircraft carriers and 4 cruisers being put down by US destroyer and submarine torpedoes.\n\n=============================================================\n\nThe peculiarities of either the real history or the alternate history of the WNT, plus the peculiarities of naval doctrines, within that treaty regime that each navy developed was bound to influence how each navy \"looked\" as it developed inside the treaty limitations.\n\nFor the specific case of the British, they started with an early lead in naval aviation that they tried to maintain with a vigorous program of 1920s development, that surprisingly included an emphasis on anti-ship strike. They lost the plot with repeated aircraft program failures and with the political decision to roll the fleet air arm into their Royal Air Force going into the 1930s, but we are not that far yet. We just have the record of \"mixed success\" in which they still held a substantial lead.\n\nAs for their technical development in the realm of torpedoes and guns?\n\nBritain held a technological lead in torpedo development for much of the period between the World Wars, but they were overtaken by the Japanese with their use of pure oxygen. However, the British remained ahead of all other nations. This success was mainly due to the adoption of the Brotherhood burner-cycle engine. The burner-cycle engine was in effect a semi-diesel. Typically, air pressurized to about 840 lbs./in2 (59 kg/cm2) was heated to about 1,800ºF (1,000ºC) by burning a small amount of atomized kerosene-type fuel. This hot air/gas mixture was then fed into the engine via poppet valves and more fuel was injected into each cylinder a little before TDC (Top Dead Center). The spontaneous ignition of this mixture powered the engine.\n\nOxyen-enrichment was employed for the large 24.5\" (62.2 cm) Mark I torpedoes used on the Nelson class battleships and for the 21\" (53.3 cm) Mark VII torpedoes used on cruisers, but they were not well regarded as the oxygen enrichment process was cumbersome and difficult to use. The performance of these torpedoes was far below the much more successful Japanese oxygen-fueled torpedoes which were, ironically, developed when a Japanese officer overheard a conversation about the use of oxygen. Cruiser torpedoes were converted to natural air in the early part of World War II.\n\nHydrogen peroxide for propulsion had been studied in 1923, but its innate instability and procurement problems meant that work was quickly abandoned. Following the end of World War II, German and USA work was investigated and a few 21\" (53.3 cm) Mark 12 Ferry/Fancy were issued starting in 1954, but following the destruction of the submarine HMS Sidon and an explosive failure on the Arrochar test range, the project was cancelled in 1959.\n\nThe Royal Navy had no great interest in using electric motors for torpedoes prior to World War II as they had relatively poor performance and because there was no demand for tracklessness. During the war, experiments were conducted using captured German G7e torpedoes, but the war ended before British-produced versions were in service. Captured examples of German electric torpedoes were given to the USA, who used them in developing their own electric torpedoes. A program for an electric-powered 22.4\" (56.9 cm) torpedo developed by the RAF was abandoned before entering production.\n\nTorpedoes developed after World War II are either Hap-Otto fueled pump-jet powered (Spearfish) or else use high-capacity battery-powered electric motors.\n\nSo much for that. The British understood their industrial plant limitations better in the real history and presumably in the alternate history, as well. They made several forays into modern gun development. Their cruiser gun armaments seemed to have been no worse than anyone elses'. Their new battleship guns were simply awful.\n\nAs to the destroyer guns, the confusion engendered by the industrial base existent and the miscues as to how dangerous the air threat was, and size limitations inside the (alternate history) treaty, meant that manually loaded main armament was about the best the British could do for this class of ship. The British had 4 inch, 4.7 inch and 5 inch guns left over from the days when they were the principle designer and exporter of naval artillery to the world. None of these guns based on their heavy shells was capable of true dual purpose fire without powered assist. The British tried to get away with it anyway. They failed. They would relaize their mistake in the real history and try to design a power assisted ram 5.25 gun (1935) which they completely botched up as they had their 14 and 16 inch bore guns. Their second attempt would be a 4.5 inch bore gun which would be somewhat successful, but long after the crisis for which it was intended was over and had made the gun moot. (1950s.)\n\nThere was the last question of AAA, or air defense. Ther British had a WWI solution in the scaled up 2 pounder, an oversized Maxim machine gun. It was what was had in 1922, if somewhat sporadically as a spray the sky and hope the enemy flies into it solution. It worked after a fashion. This would fail as planes improved.\n\n======================================================\n\nAmerican torpedoes both in the real history and in this alternate history are a sad story which the treaty impacted.\n\n1885 to 1905\n\nThe first USN torpedo was the Howell which used a flywheel for power. Although modestly successful, the Whitehead type using compressed air was adopted as it was suitable to improvements to increase range and warhead size.\n\nWorld War I and World War II\n\nUnlike other nations, the United States abandoned the Whitehead compressed air torpedoes in favor of turbine propulsion as early as November 1907. Wet-heater propulsion systems were introduced to USN torpedoes during the 1920s and became the primary motive power for the next two decades.\n\nThe Bliss torpedoes were all WETHEATER from 1907 forward. THAT was the reason for the turbine.\n\nFor example, the Mark 13 airborne torpedo of the 1930s-1940s was an alcohol-fuelled freshwater wet-heater using a two-stage impulse type turbine with contra-rotating rotors, no stator and three nozzles. More energetic fuel systems including ones using pure oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (\"Navol\") instead of air were tested in the 1930s but these developments were dropped due to technical difficulties.\n\nLack of money and nervousness of the endusers. Those torpedoes' motors worked. The front end that went \"bang\" was another story. M.\n\nNewport Station worked intermittently on electric torpedoes between the wars, but it was not until a captured German G7e was supplied by the British in 1941 that interest was aroused enough to place a development contract. These torpedoes were very popular with the US Submarine force as they were essentially wakeless. However, post-war analysis showed that Japanese merchantmen rarely noticed a wake and the rather slow speed of the Mark 18 resulted in the standard wet-heater torpedoes having a 17% better hit rate against merchant ships and 250% better against escort ships.\n\nSame again. The point is that both systems came into service inside of two years once the order to make them was given. You do not cram a decade's worth of engineering into 22 months unless you have that decade's worth of successful engineering as runners. M.\n\nExperiments with Navol were revived during World War II with about 1,000 torpedoes being completed too late to see service.\n\nPost war torpedoes have been mainly electrics and otto-fueled pistons.\n\nProduction during World War I\n\nBetween 01 January 1917 and 30 November 1918, a total of 5,910 Mark 7 and Mark 8 torpedoes were ordered with 1,982 being actually delivered during this time period. However, the massive numbers of \"flush-decker\" destroyers completed during and after the war resulted in a total production of about 3,000 Mark 8 torpedoes.\n\nProduction during World War II\n\nMark 13 Aircraft 17,000\n\nMark 14 Submarine 13,000\n\nMark 15 Surface 9,700\n\nMark 16 Hydrogen peroxide 1,000\n\nMark 18 Electric 9,600\n\nMark 23 Mark 14 variant 9,600\n\nTotal 59,900\n\nThe numbers above are rounded off and include all torpedoes produced during the 1930s.\n\nThe United States manufactured a total of 57,653 torpedoes between 1 January 1939 and 1 June 1946. Newport built 18,751, Alexandria built 9,920, Westinghouse 8,250, Forest Park 8,391, St. Louis 6,257, Keyport 795, and Pontiac and International Harvester built 5,289.\n\nWarhead Explosives\n\nThe earliest weapons used wet gun-cotton. Just prior to World War I, this was replaced with TNT. Torpex (TPX) was introduced in the Fall of 1942. In the late 1940s Torpex was replaced by HBX, then H-6 in the 1960s and by PBX in the 1970s.\n\nApproximately 1.9 lbs. (0.9 kg) of wet gun-cotton is equivalent to 1.0 lbs. (0.45 kg) of TNT.\n\nTorpex is a mixture of 37-41% TNT, 41-45% RDX (cyclonite, cyclomethylene trinitramine) and 18% aluminum. HBX and H-6 are also TNT based with additives to increase their explosive power or increase their stability.\n\nTorpex is attractive because of the increased explosive energy and higher detonation velocity of RDX as compared to TNT and the prolongation of the pressure wave by the aluminum. On a weight basis, Torpex is conservatively estimated to be about 50% more effective than TNT as an underwater explosive against ships. However, Torpex is more sensitive than TNT and RDX is expensive and difficult to make safely.\n\nWarhead Pistols\n\nThe failure of the US Magnetic Pistol and backup striker gear is well known. Much of this was due to peacetime economies, but excessive secrecy and far too little communications between the Naval Torpedo Station and the Fleet were also to blame, as well as the reluctance of the Bureau of Ordnance to accept good evidence of defects.\n\nAlready covered. The British and Germans had the same failures for the same reasons. M.\n\nThe result was that it was not officially announced until August 1942 that the standard submarine torpedo Mark 14 ran 10 feet (3 m) below its depth setting and not until June 1943 that the magnetic pistol was ordered to be disabled. However, long before this time, many submarine commanders were putting to sea per orders with activated pistols only to deactivate them once out of sight of land. The contact exploder faults were finally rectified in September 1943 but magnetic exploders were distrusted as late as thirty years after the war ended.\n\nThe Americans invented wake-homers and tested them in a crude form as soon as they realized the physical operating principles. Suffice it to say that the principles were available and understood from 1943 forward.\n\nGuns.\n\nThe Americans did no worse than the British as to native designs which were original with the Fletcher and Seabury pattern guns of the 1890s. They had a dud shell problem when they migrated from 12 inch bore to 14 inch bore around 1912, that they did not solve until George Blandy urgently tested the shell designs in 1941-1942. Their gun salvo dispersion problem lasted into the middle of 1927 when it was noticed during a scout cruiser shoot-ex that the new treaty cruisers were dropping ladders a mile in radius in spot splashes apart. That is radius of the aim circle, NOT diameter. The problem"
