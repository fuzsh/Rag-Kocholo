Loss of Salary for Performances. Missed to Be Imposed. Delay May Oblige Split Weeks to Become Full Weeks. Last week the members of the Vaude- ville Managers' Protective Association compiled statistics on the movement of trains and the report following showed that exactly 8! per cent, of the acts moved in and out of towns ar- rived without the necessary baggage to do their specialties. The V. M. P. A. has issued instruc- tions to its members to urge all acts U. take a suit case carrying make-up and costumes so that in the event of trunk delay, the act can work. Trunks and heavy baggage are being held up to allow the transportation of food and fuel and as a result the traveling public suffers. Any act failing to take heed of the instructions will lose the proportionate amount of salary for performances lost through its inability to appear, pro- vided of course a suit case would carry sufficient paraphernalia ,to avoid the loss of time. The vaudeville houses playing split weeks (two bills weekly) commenced to wonder this week with the cold, de- layed transportation and the expecta- tion a large number of railroads will remove many scheduled trains, what is going to be the ultimate result. Some of the vaudeville booking men thought the split week theaters might be forced to adopt a full week policy in time, while others said the booking offices might play acts in splits where the turns would virtually be obliged to lose a half week through travel to make the connecting stand positively before the first show. No concerted thought or action has been taken by the bookers of the split time houses, however. They are wait- ing to see what develops. A notice has been posted in the United Booking Offices asking agents to urge their act6 to take the first available train, when making a jump, to provide against delays. baker as it9 permanent home.

During the engagement of \"Mother C&rey's Chickens\" at the Majestic, opening next week, the admission scale •top will be $1, NEW CONTRACT TRIED. The new theatrical equity contract, recently ratified by both the Actors' Equity Association and the United Managers' Protective Association, worked out harmoniously during the recent holidays, although the managers made ' no kick about paying for the week before Christmas \"lay-off,\" when business conditions were anything but rosy anywhere. ^layers not having the contracts with certain managerial interests that recognized the Equity's contract shared in the new provision of the latter's playing agreement, the man- agements making no discriminations.

Seattle, Jan. 2. Seattle was floodbound early this week for the second time within two weeks. All vaudeville anji..jyna....ex- changes were hard hit by the tie-up of the boat lines to Tacoma and Vancou- ver. North gives city only transporta- tion facilities. The Hippodrome (vaudeville) bill, due to open at the Regent, Tacoma, Sunday, was held up by the floods. The Recent show closing Saturday was sent to the local Hip by boat. A make- shift program was arranged for Ta- coma. The Orpheum bill arrived there by boat from Vancouver in time to open. Ranta^es Circuit acts came in Tuesday from Portland, routed by the way of Pendleton. Only two of the six turns due to open at the local Orpheum reached here in time to play the Sunday matinee. NO \"PLAYLESS DAYS.\" Washington, Jan. 2. George Creel, in response to a rumor in New York the Government would establish a \"playless day,\" when all the- atres in the United States will be closed one day a week, stated there was no truth in the report, the mat- ter not even under consideration. He added that the \"lightless\" nights were for the conservation of coal, t which comes under the head of necessity. NOT UNUSUAL Chicago, Tan. 2. One of the biggest men in Chicago's theatrical walks, a showman of modern enterprise and methods, is on the war- path regarding a \"deal\" he got recently in New York, where he chose to buy some seats to a legitimate attraction rather than ask for passes. He was asked by a friend to get him eight seats inside the first three rows at a certain theatre. He went to the box office, and the treasurer, not knowing the Chicr.goan. laughed in his face. He went to one scalper and managed to get two in the fourth row. He went to another and got two in the sixth row and four behind it. in the seventh, making his eight seats. With some pride he presented the seats to his friend, explaining the difficulties he had had, and not even mentioning the heavy premiums he had paid. Next dav he met his friend and got the ha-ha. The eiefy seats the Chicago show- man had bought at war orices were eight of the onlv IS seats inside the first seven rows that were occupied, and his two the only ones used in the second or third, rows. \"I don't mind getting robbed,\" said the theater man, \"but when they take the extra money, make me walk mv legs off and plead as though I were a beggar, it makes me a trifle sore to have them show me up, besides.\" COL'S HEADLINERS THIS WEEK. London, Tan. 2. The headline features at the Coliseum • his week are Violet Vanbrugh and Co. in a new nlavlet, \"The Woman on the Window Sill\"; Lydia Kyasht in a new comedy ballet, \"Cnoid's Conspiracy,\" composed by Sir Frederick Cowen ; Marguerite Scialtiel in \"Maid of France,\" and Grock. MAY BE \"COMMONWEALTH.\" Tndications Wednesday pointed that \"The Grass Widow.\" which moved from the Liberty to the Princess Christmas night, was having pretty t^ugh sledding v.itl; the weather against thcatrcgoinjj and that arrangements were pending whereby the show would be continued on the \"commonwealth\" plan. This plan would be along the same lines used by the Richard Lambert company playing \"Art and Oppor- tunity\" at the Cort before the holidays. WASH. SQ. FINISHING? According to report the Washington Square Players will continue for but an- other week at the Comedy, after having occupied the house for two seasons and one half of the current one. The reason is that even with the reduction in prices they have been unable to attract sufficient business to meet the house rental. They are said to be in arrears for five weeks at present \"Success,\" the Theo. Leibler, Jr., pro- duction, is slated to go into the house, according to present arrangements. SACK'S WINNING CHANCE. J. L. Sacks, the London producer, is a winner on a long shot that he took last August when he contracted with Cohan & Harris for the London rights to \"Going Up.\" That was months be- fore the piece was produced on this side. Sacks paid the managers $1,000 advance royalty on the show and secured the piece for abroad. Sacks intends to present the piece in London in February with Robert Era- mett Keane in the role played here by Frank Craven Arthur Voegtlin and William J. Wil- son are co-partners in 50 per cent, of the production which Sacks holds. APPOINTING CAMP MANAGERS. During the current week there is ex- pected to arrive from Washington the appointments for a number of mana- gers of camp theaters. The managers are to be assigned to various theatres in the army cantonments through .the country, according to recommendations that have been made from the offices of the Committee on Training Camp Activities in New York City. At present there are approximately a half dozen theaters at various encamp- ments ready for the housing of attrac- tions of a local nature, but it is doubtful if they will be in shape to receive trav- eling attractions for another month or more. HITCHCOCK'S TRAVESTY PLAN. According to report the next piece Hitchcock & Gest will do, on musical comedy lines, will be a burlesque of current legit hits, with a cast that has two prominent artists mentioned for its leaders. One of these is Clifton Crawford, another a woman star now in a Broadway dramatic success. KREISLER COMPOSING SCORE. Fritz Kreislcr and Guy Bolton are to collaborate on a musical comedy in which Margaret Namara is to be starred. She is the wife of Bo'ton and is to give a matinee concert at the Princess Jan. 8. f CABLES i 4 V By E. G. Paris, Dec. 20. Failing to obtain any notable success with the new productions recently of- fered at the Comedie Francaise, the management (or rather the committee) has secured for the regular repertoire Alfred de Mussefs \"Lorenzaccio,\" last played by Sarah Bernhardt at the Re- naissance. Theodore de Banville's \"Beau Leandre\" and Paul Verlaine's \"Les Uns et les Autres\" will also be revived at the first national comedy house of France. It is rumored De Max will soon retire from the Comedie Francaise troupe, feeling he has not sufficient scope at the House of Moliere, where the acting is regulated by tradition, following Le Bargy, Coquelin, Bern- hardt and other famous artists. Re- quired at this famous theatre is a man- ager with power of control, who is not liable to the little susceptibilities of the troupe forming the committee or the influences of politicians. The organ- ization of the House of Moliere is ex- cellent (on paper), but Napoleon I, when he drew up his famous decree on the battlefield governing the manage- ment of the Comedie Francaise did not reckon with the petty jealousies of the actors and actresses when they become societaires\" and to a great extent con- trol the destinies of this theatre. An artist of talent may decide to play a role as he understands it and not be constrained to keep to the tradition because a predecessor played the part in another manner. The important feature of a great artist is individual- ity and such individuality, which the public admires, is discouraged at the Comedie Francaise. Tradition is the motto there. A revue will be given this winter at the Concert Mayol by O. Dufrenne. It will be signed by H. Varna and Le- lievre, and entitled \"Cest Fantastique.\" During the summer an operetta by Bataille-Henri, \"Les Profiteurs de 1'Amour,\" will probably be mounted. The revue, \"Laisse les Tomber,\" pro- duced at the new Casino de Paris, when Gaby Deslys made her reappearance before a French public, is a magnificent show and met with approbation. Gaby sings, dances and acts with Harry Pil- cer, and the couple stand out in an important cast recruited by Leon Vol- terra. The costumes are gorgeous, par- ticularly for war time! Various flowers are represented by some of the pret- tiest dresses seen on the stage. The ladder scene has been introduced as the three colors (red, white, blue), and pleased immensely. Murray Piker's sherbo band made good, but rather frightened some gentle folk. The shoot- ing star dance by a troupe of English girls creating sparks on a special car- pet by the movement of their feet was found a novelty here. Boucot, Mag- nard. Miles. Rose, Amy, Louvain, Pretty Myrtill and all concerned worked hard to make the witless revue go. But wit is not required at the Casino de Paris; there is a feast for the eyes. Mile. Deslys is quite dramatic in a sketch portraying her obsession by sensational pictures, in which she makes a few Fregoli changes. Her rich costumes did not seem to please and were thought eccentric. There is every pos- sibility the Casino de Paris (a white elephant since Borney's departure), will be once more one of the chic resorts of the French capital. Many structural alterations have been made, and as a matter of fact the Casino is not yet completed. A large gallery now runs from the fauteuils to KENDREW. the front wall of the hall, pasing as a covering to the promenade, very much on the same lines as at the Olympia. A special entrance is being made to these seats.. The upholstery is in pome- granate red; the decorations in the auditorium are not particularly har- monious, but no real judgment can be rendered until the hall is quite finished, which may be another month. How- ever, Volterra and Gaby opened in time for the Christmas vacations, and that is an important result. Nedelec fills the functions of assistant manager, Leh- man is producing manager and Soulaire musical leader. Eugenio has charge of the stage. The program even goes so far as to tell the name of the chief electrician and the principal carpet- man. The reopening of the Casino de Paris is a success and was a big event. \"La Marraine d'Escouade,\" the oper- etta given by the intermediary of Broussan (formerly co-director of the Opera), at the Theatre du Vaudeville, is a musical version of Les Fiancees de Rosalie, a farce played at the De- jazet last season. A party of French soldiers, who have been adopted as \"godsons\" by a young woman, turn up at her parents' home to pass their fur- lough and commit all sorts of pranks, interlaced with singing and dancing. This forms the story. One of the group is an ecclesiastic in peace times, and has proved himself a real poilu. He feels he will be unable to follow his calling in future, renouncing the flesh and the devil, so he marries his pretty Marraine. The music is diverting, but not particularly original. Some radical changes are taking place at the Comedie Francaise : Hector Cremieux's \"Abbe Constantine,\" good old-fashioned melodrama, has been added to the repertoire and will be revived shortly. Criticism has been expressed relative to the noisy antics of Murray Pilcer's ragtime Sherbo band at the Casino de Paris, considered inappropriate in war time. The pitch of this music, which is discoursed also during the entr'acte, has been somewhat toned down. No- tices to this effect are published in the local press. , A musical comedy by Gignoux and Barde, music by Cuvillier, which will bear the name of \"Judith, Courtisane,\" will shortly be produced at the little Theatre Michel. Cleo de Merode will make her reappearance in the work, which, if rumor is correct, will run a big risk of being barred by the British and American censors should exact English versions be adopted. Biblical characters seem in favor in Paris as subjects for risky operetta. The field has not been exploited hitherto and brain fever is not to be feared in adapt- ing it to the stage. But such efforts do not add lustre to the French stage. \"Grand-Pere,\" by Lucien Guitry, re- cently produced at the Porte St. -Mar- tin, is meeting with a success which places the author-actor in a respectable position among French playwrights. It is difficult to summarize the story; the comedy describes the petty quarreling of a family. Due to the tact and good nature of a grandfather, whose son lias disgraced the clan, a young girl is able to marry the man she loves after being frequently rebutted by her supposed family during three acts. This is the first dramatic work of this French actor, who is following in the footsteps of Sacha Guitry, his son, rather late in life. It is well mounted and neatly told. PARIS MUSICIANS ON STRIKE. Paris, Jan. 2. The strike of the theatre musician! in Paris continues. Some of the larger houses have female orchestras and say there they will hold them indefinitely. A few of the picture places have gotten along with piano only. The vaudeville theatres compromised when the female orchestras engaged by them were re- cruited to the strikers. The musicians struck unexpectedly Christmas Day, demanding two francs extra a show. The performances throughout the city that day were ac- companied by pianos. ALL SEYMOUR HICKS. London, Jan. 2. At St. Martin's theatre, Dec. 31, was produced \"Sleeping Partners,\" a new three-act comedy adapted from the French, in one scene, four characters — Eternal Triangle, Husband, Wife, Friend. It is light, audacious, often witty, with little action, practically a monolog for Seymour Hicks — the best he has ever done. He is well supported by Madge Lessing and Stanley Turnbull. WONDERFUL SHOW BT BLIND. London, Jan. 2. Dorothy Minto has engaged to play Nothing, the lead in the wood panto- mime recently presented by blinded soldiers and sailors at St. Dunstan's wonderful performance. King, the star blind dancer, gave an extraordinary exhibition with a dummy of Charlie Chaplin, danced a wild fox trot with remarkable sureness, and so on Will Broadbent, chief comedian, gave an astounding performance. A most prpular chorus was a skit of Braille, \"Another Little Dot Won't Do You Any Harm.\" \"ALADDIN,\" BEST YET. London, Jan. 2. \"Aladdin\" at the Drury Lane is the best production Arthur Collins ever presented there. It is better described as a musical fairy play than a panto- mime, with a capital book, plenty of comedy, gorgeous scenes, original mu- sic by Glover and Gideon, splendidly p!ayed by Madge Titheradge, Daisy Bindley, Lennie Deane, Robert Hale, Will Evans, Caleb Porter, Harry Gaff, Stanley Lupino, the latter the out- standing success who promises to re- place the late Dan Leno in popularity. HOLIDAY'S PACKED BUSINESS. London, Jan. 2. The legitimate and variety business is splendid during the holidays. More money is being spent on amuse- ments than ever previously. Most of the houses are packed twice daily. A MARTINI DIES. London, Jan. 2. William Martini, one of the orig- inal Martini gymnastic troupe, is dead, aged 69. GERTRUDE ROBINS DEAD. London, Jan. 2.

The Pierrots and orchestra, 50 sol- diers, disqualified from further arduous fighting and entertaining the 25th Div- sion at the front, have arrived in Lon- don on short leave. They are giving a series of concerts at Wigmore Hall to secure funds to provide comforts for men in the trenches, offering a capital program, in- cluding songs, serious acting, comedy, dances, sketches, burlesque, etc., all good, with several high class artists. They were enthusiastically received by a large audience. ADA REEVES MAINTAINS CLAIM. Paris, Jan. 2. It is reported from Sydney, Australia, Ada Reeves has successfully maintained her claim in the Supreme Court over there that her husband, Wilfred Cotton, has no partnership in her theatrical in* terests. Miss Reeves is the widely known English artist, now in Australia on a re- turn engagement. TES UNCLE\" IS MERRY. London, Jan. 2. At the Prince of Wales, Grossmith & Laurillard produced \"Yes Uncle\" Dec. 29. It is a merry, bright musical pro- duction reflecting credit on Austin Hurgon, part author and sole pro- ducer and Nat D. Ayer, composer. The piece was an instantaneous suc- cess. The chief scorers are Leslie Henson, Davy Burnaby, Robert Nainby, Frank Hector, Lily St. John, Julia James. CORLETT KILLED IN ACTION. London, Jan. 2.

F. Albee Issues Mandate Wherein Status of United Booking Offices Is Clearly Defined as to Exact Amount Agents Can Charge Acts for Booking— U. B. O. Wants Complaints to Come Direct. In an announcement issued this week by E. F. Albee, vaudeville artists are informed what amounts should be paid for securing an engagement through the United Booking Offices. The notification Was caused through an anonymous letter, reproduced in the announcement, alleging some U. B. O. agents book their big-time acts on the small-time circuits when the big tim- ers have open dates, the letter charging that through this the acts must pay commission amounting to 20% in all. The Albee notice says that custom provides for a five per cent, fee to an agent for representative and that the U. B. O. charges five per cent, com- mission, which would be the full amount charged if an act booked direct with it. Any commission, says Mr. Albee, paid to U. B. O. agents for ap- pearing in small-time houses is un- necessary, and he invites artists who have paid over 10 per cent, on engage- ments to submit their grievances to the managers, who guarantee them protection. The U. B. O. is open to re- ceive at all times, the announcement states, any complaint by an artist an agent has charged an excessive amount. The communication causing the Albee statement was unsigned, which Mr. Albee refers to. He adds that artists with grievances should come forward with them instead of making sidewalk gossip, if they wish io better vaudeville conditions. The anonymous letter refers to a matter of booking frequently reported, that of big-time acts playing small time intermittently and intermediately dur- ing the fulfillment of a big-time route. There are agents doing business with the United Booking Offices who are said to have direct connections with small-time agents, through which both place when opportunity offers acts from each division on the . other. Though this booking is conducted secretly with the original agent of the turn always ready with a plea he did not book it in the other held (and in a position where his statement can not be dis- proved), it is quite well established this sort of booking by agents has been go- ing on for a long while. What amount of commission the big acts have paid when placed in the smaller houses to fill in open time has been kept as secret as the booking connection. SENTENCED FOR 30 YEARS. Chicago, Dec. 29. About a year and a half ago, Edmund Norton, who played -the rube kid in the vaudeville act known as \"Christ- mas at Higgins',\" was arrested at Ft. Worth, Tex., under the name of Fred Lloyd, for attempted rape. Without friends or money, his case was rushed to trial with the court ap- pointing an attorney to defend him. The trial was in a way only perfunc- tory, and as the laws through the south are severe for this charge, Nor- ton, or Lloyd, was sentenced to 30 years in the penitentiary. New evidence was later found and the young lawyer who represented him at the trial asked for a rehearing and retrial of the case by the Court of Appeals. With the request for a rehearing however, his interest in the case lapsed and with no one to push it, the matter has been allowed to drag until this time, with Norton still con- fined in the county jail at Ft. Worth, as he had not informed his friends about it, as he disliked the notoriety. Now, after 18 months, he has written to Lew N. Goldberg, the Chicago agent, stating that the court will set Jan. 16, at Ft. Worth, and if granted a new trial by the court, he will be rushed to trial, and won't have a chance un- less furnished with an attorney to look after his interests, and one who can give a bond to stay the case until he is prepared to present his case. C S. (\"Tink\") Humphrey, Karl Hob- litzelle, president of the Interstate Cir- cuit, Lew M. Goldberg, Irving Simon, John Simon, Dave Baehler, Bert Cor- telyou, Will Jacobs, Marius Heinaw, Coney Holmes, Glenn C. Burt, Chas. Crowl, J. T. Keeler, Edgar Dudley, Ir- ving Yates, Lew Earl, J. C. Elias, Tom Carmody, Eddie Shayne, Sam Nahl, Asher Levy, Harry W. Spingold, Jesse Freeman, Dick Hoffman, Charlie Free- man, H. J. Allardt, Chas. Hoyland, Cal Grims, Walter Downie, Geo. Van, Sam Thall, Andy Talbot, C. W. Nelson, Paul B. Powell, Paul Gordon, Tom Powell and others have interested themselves in the matter and will see that Norton secures a bond and a regular attorney to not only push the case, but to see that the matter is adequately presented when the case comes up for trial. Mr. Hoblitzelle, who as president of the Interstate, has property interests in Texas, will attend to the giving of any necessary bond for appearances as well as the selecting attorneys to look af- ter Norton's interests, both before and at the trial. Any friends of Norton who desire to assist him with money in order that he may have a fair chance in court, may send remittances to either C. S. Hum- phrey, manager of the Chicago office of the United, or to Lew W. Goldberg, Suite 806, Majestic Theatre Bldg. Those who have gone into the case to any extent, claim that with a proper showing of the evidence at hand, Nor- ton cannot be convicted of the charge. KIDNAPPING CHARGED. New Orleans, Dec. 31. Evading the authorities for more than a year, Charles Schaefer, a Hungarian, was arrested in San Antonio, on a tip from New Orleans federal officers, and is being held pending the development cf white slave charges. Schaefer is charged with kidnapping Mathew and Bailor Matina, twin Lilli- putians, aged 14, located in a carnival playing El Paso. The local authorities received infor- mation through Lew Rose, manager of the Dauphine theatre here. CHICAGO PALACE GROSS. Chicago, Jan. 2. The gross at the Palace (vaudeville) last week (Xmas) without an extra per- formance beats all the box office records of that theatre for the past three years. KEANE HELD OVER 3rd WEEK. Robert Emmett Keanc will remain at the Palace, New York, next week, his third consecutive one. He is also ap- pearing in \"The Grass Widow\" at the Princess. Mr. Keane is the only \"single'* male act ever holding over for three weeks at the New York Palace. FRIARS 9 DINNER FOR MORRIS. There is some talk of the Friars giving William Morris a dinner during April next. It may be held at one of the big hotels. Commencing April 22, Harry Lauder, under Morris' management, goes into the Metropolitan, New York, for two weeks, with Morris renting the house. It will mark the close of Lauder's present tour over here. He will return to England, probably coming back here in the fall on his way to Australia, for a return engagement over there, also under Morris' direction. Mr. Morris has instructed his attor- neys, House, Grossman & Vorhaus, to commence actions to recover against the Shuberts and the New York Cen- tral R. R., alleging that through negli- gence on their part the Lauder show missed three performances, two at the Shubert, New Haven, and one at the Academy of Music, Brooklyn. The suit against the Shuberts is for the New Haven lost shows, for which there had been an advance sale of $800 for the matinee and $2,496 at night. In Brooklyn the matinee's advance sale was $1,800, and the claim against the Central will be fcased upon that through delay in moving the Lauder special car from Albany to New York. In New Haven the theatre could not supply heat. PHILA. BLOOMER. Philadelphia, Jan. 2. The \"Supreme Vaudeville\" show given at the Academy of Music proved a gigantic flivver. First Grace La Rue was announced as the headliner, but her name appeared in the ads. only one day and Ralph Herz, the musical comedy comedian, topped the bill, which also included the Courtney Sis- ters; Bennett and Richards; Dancing LaVars; Four Musical Hodges; May Marvin, a \"single\"; Walter Percival and Co. in a sketch called \"The Way Out,\" and the Three Kramers, a ring and bar act. The first show given Monday night diew less than $1,000 and the New Year's evening performance even less. The afternoon show had the audience i hilled to the bone in the poorly heat- ed house, kidding the artists and walk- ed out on the acts. It was reported when Grace La Rue was lost to the show, the original backers dropped out and it was diffi- cult to learn just who was behind the bloomer. GASTON AND DINGLE TEAM. Billy Gaston and Tom Dingle have teamed. Gaston has been off the stage for some years, devoting his time to writing popular songs.

Judge Reviews Vaudeville Act and 'Tress Matter.\" Equity Calls for \"Clean Hands,\" Says Court. Chicago, Jan. 2. The Supreme Court of Michigan, by an opinion handed down at Lansing Dec. 27, reversed the decree of the Circuit Court of Wayne County, entered Feb. 29, 1916, which, at the suit of Joseph Cohen, alias Joseph B. Howard, alias Joseph Mercedes, per- petually enjoined Mercedes Crane from the use of her own name. \"Mercedes\" in connection with the production of any theatrical performance. In his bill of complaint filed in that case Cohen claimed he conceived the act which he has entitled \"Mercedes,\" and was the first to use the word \"Mer- cedes\" in connection with his act; and alleged that Elizabeth M. Crane (as he called her in the bill), who was then, with others, producing an act in the Miles theatre, Detroit, under the name of \"Concentration,** was im- properly using the name \"Mercedes** Crane (with the emphasis on the Mer- cedes) in connection with that act greatly to the injury of the com- plainant. In her answer filed to the bill Miss Crane set up that her name was Mer- cedes Crane, by which she had been known all her life; that she used the name Mercedes when she first went with Cohen in 1910; that Cohen called her Mercedes and advertised her as Mercedes, and that when she left Cohen In 1911 Cohen, in order to take advantage of the reputation which had been established by Miss Crane, began calling himself Mercedes and later had his name changed from Joseph Cohen to Joseph Mercedes by the Circuit Court, Cook County, on an ex parte petition, of which she had not notice. The opinion of the Supreme Court says Cohen did not originate the act \"Mercedes,** and conceived the name \"Mercedes.** as he testified, from read- ing the \"Count of Monte Cristo.** Justice Fellows, who wrote the opin- ion of tl.e court, is convinced, so states the opinion, that the act \"was gotten up by the joint efforts of plaintiff, defendant and defendant's father.** And ihc idea for the act. the court holds, was obtained from a book owned by Miss Crane' father, J. M. Crane, then a newspaperman, connected with a \"prominent Chicago newspaper.\" The opinion of the Supreme Court further recites that the plaintiff, who commenced the suit as Joseph B. Howard, was by birth Joseph Cohen, and changed his name when only a youngster to Joseph B. Howard, \"one Joseph Howard being somewhat promi- nent in the theatrical world, later causing his name to be changed to Joseph Mercedes.\" Justice Fellows further states: \"But there is another feature of this case which I think should work its reversal. It is said that plain- tiff has built up a valuable busi- ness in giving this performance, which should be protected by a court of equity. I realize that a certain degree of altitude is allowed in praising pne's wares, but there is a limit to All things. The methods used by trris plaintiff to establish his reputation and build up his business are not such as to appeal to the conscience of a court of equity for relief through that court by the strong arm of a writ of injunction. We may lay aside the fact that the performance sought to be protected is a trick pure and simple; that the so-called 'thought transfusion,' 'mind read- ing' or 'psychic wonder' is simply the carrying out of a carefully devised code, understood alone by the performers; that while it amuses and interests, it at the same time deceives, the public. All these may be laid aside while we ex- amine the methods used by the F lain tiff to establish his reputation, quote from one of his press notices, published after he had ap- propriated to himself the word ^Mercedes.'** Here the justice quotes from the press notice referred to, a most romantic story of \"Mercedes\" (Cohen) being the son of a Scot and a \"Spanish Lady,** *he boy being compelled early in life to seek work in a factory because of his father's \"reverses' ; how the labor galled the \"tempera- ment\" and 'soul\" of an artist. The romance set f rth by this press clip- ping begins with Nellie Stantone, a neighbor girl\" of Frer-h parentage. Then follows an incident to the \"soul- ful.\" young factory hand, followed by blood poisoning and a delirium pf weeks' duration, all during which the young \"artist\" remembered \"Ave Maria,\" the last piece he had played on his violin. And on his first return to home after his recovery h* visited Nellie and\" said to her, \"I wish you would play that piece for me.\" And Nellie, without any suggestion as to the name of the piece, \"whirled\" around on the piano stool and played Gounod's great composition. How the boy was startled; how they began' f practicing together along \"psychic\" ines; how the parents of both ob- jected; how her family moved to Battle Creek; how the youthful \"artist\" fol- lowed her and sold papers on the street in order to \"be by her,\" follow. Then another sickness, during which he was allowed to pursue his study of \"telepathy.\" and the final produc- tion of the act. Of this story Justice Fellows says in the opinion : \"Admittedly there is not one state- ment in this entire article that is true. To put our approval on such methods by protecting with a writ of injunc- tion a business built upon S*uch a foundation would, to my mind, dis- regard that maxim of equity that is hoary with age, That he who comes into a court of equity must come with clean hands.' The writ of injunction is not a writ of right, but its issuance rests in sound judicial discretion. That discretion should not be moved where the partv applying docs not bring his case within equitable principles, does not show superior equities that are entitled to protection at the hands of a court of equity, does not make such a case as moves the conscience of the court to grant the relief.\" And the Supreme Court accordingly reverses the decree of the lower court with an award for costs in favor of the defendant, Miss Crane.

George Castle, of the Kohl & Castle theatrical firm, died Sunday morning, Dec. 30, at Miami, Fla., aged around 70 years. His body was removed to Chi- cago for interment in the family plot in that, his home city. Mr. Castle's sudden end came rather unexpectedly, although he had been ailing for many years with chronic asthma, and at the first sign of winter weather always left his Chicago home and journeyed to the extreme south. He had a string of trotting horses in Florida and devoted his activity in that section to racing and breeding. He is survived by a wife and daughter. George Castle owned the second largest share of the Kohl & Castle en- terprises and owned one-seventh of the Western Vaudeville Managers* As- sociation. He started his business career as a butcher boy on a western railroad and later entered theatricals in the office of his brother-in-law, who owned the King Dramatic Agency in Chicago. Vaudeville, then known as variety, was in its infancy. Mr. Castle picked up stray bits of information about the new business from artists who applied at King's for engagements. Later he opened a variety agency and booked a number of houses in the northwest, many known as museums and hnnky tonks. Ed. Kohl and George Middle- ton were conducting two dime mu- seums in Chicago and Castle was dele- gated to supply th^m with attractions. Later he became their exclusive agent. Castle was famous for his thorough- ness in booking at that time and after booking an attraction would foi'ow it around until it took the train for its destination. When the Olvmnic thea- tre. Chicago, went on the market. Cas- tle induced Kohl and Midd'eton to take it over and the three took equal parts in the investment. Then the firm se- cured the Chicago oo^ra house, and later the Havmarket, Chicago, making it a circuit of three. Later when the Vaudeville Man- agers* Association was formed with John J. Murdock (now eeneral execu- tive manager of the United Booking Offices) the bookinor list was length- ened into a profitable li«t. When the Orpheum Circuit ioined the organization and the building of the Majestic theatre was suggested, Mr. Castle refused to have anything whatever to do with the nroject. The others interested with him. however, went right ahead with the new build- ing, declaring Castle in for his pro- portionate share. With the building completed the Association was moved from the Ashland Block to the Maies- t!C. hut Castle would not move his desk or effects and for an entire month re- mained religiously away from the new headquarters. He came around, how- ever, and after looking over the of- fices^ quietly moved in without men- tioning it to anyone and from that time on headquartered with his asso- ciates. George Middleton afterward retired and moved to Los Angeles, selling out his interest to Ed. Kohl. Mr. Kohl's death followed that event and left no one but Castle and Murdock of the onVinal crowd. Mr. Castle remained active and was always to be found at his office during the summer months. He was officially known as the treasurer of the corporation, but Frank Rivers always attended to the active part of th*» office, and does yet. With the passing of George Castle goes the last of the western vaude- ville founders who remained in har- ness in. their original location. His rirath will make no difference in the management of the Kohl-Castle affairs or the Western Vaudeville Managers' Association, preparations for such an event having been made prior to the rVmise of his late partner. Mr. Castle was born in Syracuse, \\ T . Y. His estate will run into the mil- lions. GILCHRIST GETS APPOINTMENT. Theatrical interests of New York were concerned in the appointment of John F. Gilchrist as Commissioner of Licenses. Theatrical labor bodies sent commit- tees to Mayor Hylan prior to his tak- ing office and recommended Peter J. Brady be named License Commissioner. Brady, who is secretary of the Allied Printing Trades, was appointed Super- visor of City Record, however. The new Brady job pays $5,000 per annum. The Gilchrist salary will be $7,500. The labor unions, including the the- atrical federated bodies, have made a personal request that Mayor Hylan, in plums yet to be distributed, hands one to Frank X Sullivan, the present at- torney of the State Federation of Labor and who also legally represents the New York City Federated Union. Sullivan may be appointed a magistrate. EDDIE SHAYNE RETIRES. Chicago, Jan. 2. Edward Shayne, one of the leading bookers of the W. V. M. A., has an- nounced his retirement from active ser- vice after a connection with the Asso- ciation of many years. The retire- ment is due to ill health, Mr. Shavne having recently suffered a complete nervous breakdown. He will go to Red Bank, N. J., to recuperate. Charles Freeman, for the past few years assistant to Sam Kahl. of the Finnan-Heiman circuit, takes over Mr. Shayne's bookings. He is being con- gratulated on this advancement, as he is one of the youngest men on the booking floor. It is rumored Mr. Shayne, after he has recuperated, may become a ten per cent, agent in the East. ANOTHER KEENEY THEATRE. Plans are being drawn by Architect William Lehman for a big film theatre, seating 1,800, to he built by Frank A. Keeney, in Third Street, near Pine, Williamsport. Penn. A Hral for the site of the old Lycoming playhouse in Wil- liamsport was consummated last week by Keeney. The equipment and cost of construction is estimated at $200,000, work starting about March 15. Keenev's plan provides a stage large enough for vaudeville should he desire at anv time to change his straight feat- ure film policy. Architect Lehman planned the new Keeney theatres in Newark and Brook- lyn and only last week turned over specifications for a new $100,000 film palace in Kingston, N. Y. WAITING FOR \"MOVIE WEEK.\" \"Making Movie Stars\" as next week is billed for at the Harlem On*»ra house is being awaited to see what Bob O'Donnell, manager of the onera house, will secure out of the odd idea of hav- ing competitions on the vaudeville stage to uncover latent talent for mov- ing picture playing. Quite some interest appears to have been aroused in Har- Itm through the announcement. The \"episodes\" taken daily as made by the amateurs will be shown later at the opera house. The \"ens\" will be taken by an expert picture staff on the stage and before the audiences assem- bled. The full assemblage of \"eps\" gives the title for the period when it takes place, Jan. 7-12. The plan was set forth in more detail in Variety's Anniversary Number. PRINCESS OPENS. Montreal. Tan. 2. The new Princess opened Dec. 31 with a matinee. The house has a seat- ing capacity oi 2 500 and is (he hirge^t one in Cnnnda. plaving big-lime vaude- ville. The bill offered was the same as which had been at the Orpheum all week. There were a number of nrom- inent civilians and many army officials present as invited guests. Next week Lady Duff-Gordon is the headliner. VAUDEVILLE I \"JOURNAL'S\" PLEA FOR THEATRES The Christmas edition of the New York \"Journal,\" a Hearst publication which formerly devoted some space to vaudeville, its reviews and advertising depart- ment being conducted by \"Zit,\" printed an editorial by Arthur Brisbane which has occasioned considerable talk in and out of the profession. Vvm.e Air. brisuane has little or no inside knowledge of vaudeville, he selected a theme for his discourse which pleased the managerial faction very much and according to word received at the headquarters of the Vaudeville Managers' Protective Association, members of that organization propose to petition various other newspapers throughout the country to reprint the edi- torial figuring it a perfect method of encouraging patronage at this most serious time for the theatres. The article follows: THE ACTOR AND SELF-SACRIFICE. « The Most Ungrateful of All Economies Is Economising at the Actor's Expense. Copyright, 1917, Star Company. You know in a general way that theatres, and consequently actors, managers, playwrights and that great industry made up of modern genius and energy culled \"the moving picture\" arc suffering because of the war. In England, close to the war, theatres of all kinds and the moving picture houses especially are crowded and have been since the war started. But here, for reasons difficult to understand, the idea of the citizen seems to be that it is wise economy to indulge in FALSE ECON- OMY and abandon the theatre-going habit.

Es53E35EE We say that to stay away from theatres, destroying their prosperity, discouraging the men that supply the nation with amusing inspiration and iniormation is FALSE ECONOMY. And FALSE ECONOMY it is, for many reasons. In the hrst place, one of the great assets in war, as in peace, is CHEERFULNESS. The machine that wins the war through fighting or through industry is the human brain. And what the brain requires the theatre gives — change of thought, relaxation, the real rest that makes the brain better fit for work next day. The theatre is a necessary part of life, its prices are adapted to all pockets, all classes. And to practice economy at the expense of the theatre is practicing economy falsely. What is more important, such economy is not only unwise, it is ex- tremely UNGRATEFUL. Year in, year out, actors, managers, owners of theatres are called upon to contribute to charities of every conceivable kind. For a disaster at home or abroad the first call is upon the theatre. For the money necessary to give happiness to children at Christmas time the first demand is upon the actors — a demand always cheerfully and generously met. Winnipeg, Dec 26. Editor Variett: In your isue of Dec. 21 under Wash- ington, D. C, news briefs, your cor- respondent advised of the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Peyton, saying that Mrs. Peyton had been playing leads in \"a stock company at Winni- peg.

Private E. W. Adams. No. 2,250,431 57th Co, C. F. C, B. E. R, France. The theatre means cheerfulness in the nation, and cheerfulness means success. The actor is one of the nation's hardest workers, one whose career as a rule is made short by difficult, exacting work that eats up youth rapidly. Ihe actor is called upon by the public and always responds. He deserves from the public the generous response that he always gives to the public. For actors of all kinds, on the stage and on the screen, for managers, for the army of those represented in the modern great moving picture industry we bespeak of the public their most generous patronage. For these cheerful, generous, hard-working buildert-up of national cheerfulness we wish a new year full of happiness, prosperity and the recognition that they deserve. THEATRES WERE WARM. Theatrical managers and others plan to use soft coal during the short- age to heat theatres but it is neces- sary to pass an ordinance through the board of aldermen. Conservation f what little coal on hand to heat theatres has resulted in a low pressure of steam and many New York houses have been frigid ever since the sub-zero weather made the fuel shortage a problem. None of the houses intended closing and as a matter of fact they were a great deal warmer than hundreds of apartment houses. Residents along Riverside Drive flocked to theatres. A number of vaudeville agents and film offices outside of the bigger buildings were closed for the first half of the week, there being no heat supplied. Youngstown, O., Dec. 26. Editor Variett : In reference to a letter published Dec. 14 from Harry Hanson of Soul!* Africa would say I received Mr. Han- son's letter and answered it at once, telling him that owing to present book- ings and as I am featuring \"Manikin Baseball\" (an American game only), could not consider his offer. Should any manikin act desire to take advantage of Mr. Hanson's splen- did offer we will gladly send it his correspondence. Lillie Jewel Faulkner. Fort Munroe, Va., Dec. 28.

The cold spell with the thermometer hovering below what Perry discovered the temperature to be at the Pole brought to New York an experience with hot and cold audiences. The busi- ness in the majority of vaudeville houses was off, while that in the pic- ture houses was above par. The only . trouble with the picture houses was that once the audience was in, there was no way to get them out again. This was particuarly noticeable in the Loew houses. Incidentally the Loew management was exceedingly fortunate to lay in coal last summer, with the re- sult that during the current shortage of fuel the Loew houses remain as warm as toast. Another reason is that in picture houses there is no draught from back stage. That the cold air chills an audience was brought home forcibly in the vaudeville houses whenever there was a full stage act in progress. Dur- ing those moments the audiences in front shivered, while when an act in \"one\" was on the front of the house escaped the blasts from back stage. The cold snap also affected the New Year's Eve business materially. In the legit houses the business was off be- cause the cold weather of last week killed all advance sales and on the holi- day eve there wasn't any box office sale for the same reason. In the vaudeville houses (where two shows are the usual order of things on that night) the first show, usually the big one from the point of attendance, was off. The second show was away below the usual in the matter of gross. There was a general complaint on all sides over the busi- ness done on the last night of the old year. The theaters were not the only ones complaining. The restaurants also had a plaint. There was a remarkable dearth of reservations in advance this year an J the general program was for house parties all over town. Raymond and CaveHy left the Pan- tages Circuit their opening week at Minneapolis, alleging Pantage* bad headlined a colored troupe above them, to play over the time on the same bill. Lawrence Johnston and Mile. Fleury, who were to open the follow- ing week, substituted, with Hope Ver- non and \"Fat\" Thompson and Co. fill- ing in their position. Illness kept Brosius and Brown from opening at the Palace, Brooklyn, Mon- day. Call on and Park substituted. Same cause prevented \"Over Where\" appearing at the Warwick, Brooklyn, with Harry Brooks and Co. stepping in. Delayed baggage was the reason Gard- ner's Maniacs could not open at Loew's, New Rochelle, with Elizabeth Mayne going in. Train delays were responsible for many disappointments in opening bills this week. The cold spell made every- thing late into New York. Baltimore trains were coming in Sunday and Monday eight hours behind; Boston four to six hours, up-State, six to eight hours. Eva Tanguay's voice obliged a can- cellation of her Alhambra engagement for this week. Valeska Suratt is sub- stituting. Miss Tanguay is expected to resume her vaudeville engagements at Keith's, Boston, next week. Owing to the falling out of Jimmy Hussey and Co. of the Fifth Avenue program Tuesday, Con Conrad was rushed in without \"props\" or rehearsal and was retained Wednesday for the remainder of the week. The Ahearn Troupe, billed to open at Miles, Cleveland, Monday, was shift- ed at a late hour to the Regent, De- troit. The Five Jacksons opened at the former house instead. The Bessie Clayton act was obliged to cancel next week at the Bushwick, Brooklyn, through the Mosconi broth- ers being ordered to report under the draft in their home town, Philadelphia. Berrick and Hart cancelled Spring- field, HI., this week through the death of Mr. Berrick's father. The latter was assistant corporation counsel of the city of New York for many years. Gick Watson dropped out of \"Fol- low the Girl,\" which opened in Phila- delphia this week, and has returned to New York to go into the \"Words and MUsic\" show at the Fulton. Harry LaVail and sister were obliged to cancel all of their time while on the Coast, upon receipt of the sad news their mother was dying. Mitchell and Mitch left the American Roof bill Saturday through one of the members having a bad cold. Jesson and Jesson filled in. \"Sherman Was Right\" did not open on the Pantages Circuit at Minneapolis lis scheduled, with Roscoe's Minstrels showing instead. The Hawthornes cancelled the Ri- alto, Chicago; last week replaced by Rector. Weber and Talbot. Golding and Eyres opened at Pan- tages, Minneapolis, Monday instead of the Australian Trio. The Aloha Trio, a coast turn, joined the Pantages show in Vancouver, B. G, Monday. Allen Shaw replaced Adeline Francis at the Colonial, commencing Wednes- day. The Geralds substituted for Dooley and Nelson, after the Tuesday shows, at the Riverside. NEW ACTS. Jack Gardner is to return to vaude- ville after a couple of years as lead- ing man for the Kleine picture people out west. His vaudeville vehicle is to be constructed by Jean Havez (Harry Weber). George Morton (Kramer and Mor- ton) and Sydney Clare (Clare and Weston) have formed a new talking act. \"The Mississippi Misses\" is the Ralph Dunbar girl act first billed as \"The Dancers of the World.\" Edwin Arden in sketch. VAUDEVILLE AMONG THE WOMEN BY \"PATSY\" SMITH \"Les Miserables,\" featuring William Farnum, is remarkable for the number of clever children in it. Cosette is seen at different ages — five, ten, and twice in her teens — at each age being truly beautiful. Gus Edwards' \"Song Revue\" is a big offering for vaudeville and has the quality of growing better as it pro- gresses. Olga Cook, the star, affects pink with her blonde beauty. A pink satin brocade with embroidered sil- ver moons, has bustle drapery at sides and back, but a more simple frock of pink georgette worn at the closing is far more effective. Miss Starbuck is another pretty blonde — not a principal — but promising, and Mr. Edwards' eagle eye hat undoubtedly singled her out ere this. Persian silk puff dresses, simple coral pink soubret dresses (worn in the audience number) and the floral basket dresses (from the Hen- derson Review) were the most effective chorus outfits. They wore odd little hats that looked as if the backs had been chopped out of them. Two cute little kiddies made their appearance in the school room bit and in the last act. The Vampire maids and the National costume suggestions were showy bits. The Farber Girls in their artistic silver cloth and silver lace gowns daintily decorated with touches of blue and pink ribbon flowers were the \"class\" at the Colonial Monday. Irene flashed a rose silk wrap with rhine- stone collar and cuffs over a costume of black net sparkling with rows of brilliants. Constance flashed a sense of real humor and ability to \"put it over.\" The Lightner Sisters, appeared in fresh looking dresses. The larger one looked particularly well in a drapery black crepe de chine brocaded in large cherry designs. This over orange georgette, the whole over a silver lace skirt outlined with a design in bril- liants. The Columbia matinees last week were swollen considerably bv the over- flow from the Palace. Rose Sydell's \"London Bells\" entertained auditors who had set out to see Sarah Bern- hardtl A barnyard scene with drop showing farm lands in the perspective lifted the company out of the \"palace set atmosphere\" Titian-haired Kate Pullman, said to be an Eva Tanguay ( I), is featuied with the show. She pulled tom-boy stunts (some cartwheels she did were sad), and danced much throughout the show. Whether her manner meant self-satisfaction or in- difference it is hard to say. She was energy without personality. She looked best in the red, purple-lined dress worn at opening. Pretty blonde Dorothy Earle in peach silk and black-haired Frankie Burns made good opposites and should work more together than they do. A novelty worn by the chorus for the \"Dixie\" number was coarse- knitted wool one-piece bathing suits, looking like sweaters. The belts and collars were of a contrasting color. The girls were most all young and good looking with quantities of hair which they wore becomingly — but all seemed to have hard eyes, which may have been due to their makeups. One of the best workers in the show was a pretty blonde — first row, second from the end. As time tolled out the old year, at the Palace Monday night, Robert Em- mett Keane was in the middle of one of his best stories. After New Year gteetings were exchanged with the audience, Conductor Daab and Pat Rooney (who butted in from one of the wings), Mr. Keane asked the audi- tors to give three cheers for the big- gest man in American history — Wood- row Wilson. This they did right heart- ily. Stella Mayhew replaced Bern- hardt at this performance — looking ex- ceptionally well in black panne vel- vet. The long loose sleeves and front of bodice were of georgette — the lat- ter handsomely embroidered in jet. Two large diamond brooches seemed to hold up the back of bodice and an- other novel touch to the outfit was the white and black embroidered inserts on the insteps of her black silk hose. Miss Mayhew deplored the fact that she had to work alone now and pressed herself as surprised that \"Bill\" (Billie Taylor) had to go away to learn to fight when he had had so much expe- rience at home. On closer inspection the smart coat-dress worn by Inez Plummer (with Paul Dickey) appears to be sand instead of gray and the \"brown fur\" is beaver. Marion Bent opened in a white satin one-piece dress, its irregular side pan- els, collar and sleeves trimmed with bands of seal. Many buttons and but- ton holes, edged with emerald green, also trimmed frock. A cerise velvet wrap was worn over a lemon and orange georgette — the full overskirt held up at intervals by strings of col- ored beads. The girdle bodice, sash bustle and little Jap hat were of orien- tal brocade in variegated colors. Tas- sels of the colored beads fell from either side of hat. BY THE SKIRT. The \"Cohan Revue of 1918,\" while not as interesting as other things Mr. Cohan has done in the past, is so well dressed one doesn't mind the lack of snap and dash of other revues by this brilliant writer. What the chorus lacked in voice they made up in style. The first ensemble found the girls in ankle length dresses of all the pastel shades. A Spanish number headed by Fanny Stedman was beautifully dressed in crinolines of orange and yellow, while some of the girls wore lemon and red with black velvet rib- bons and mantels of chiffon with chen- nile balls. Miss Stedman was draped in a handsome white shawl. An effec- tive set of costumes were in shot silk made very short. Mauve net in many luffles was combined with white fur. Modern evening gowns were in excel- lent taste. There was a slave scene in which the costumes were a riot of color. The finale of the first act was done in that most effective combination black and white. Nora Bayes, looking years younger in a blonde wig, chose for her entrance a blue velvet dress c'raped tightly around the ankles. A squirrel cape and hat were also worn. In a red and white dress Miss Bayes looked exceptionally well. For her specialty a green velvet dress had a huge meline bow forming a bustle. For the Florence Reed impersonation Miss Bayes wore a green chiffon with a plum colored chiffon mantle. In a Red Cross costume Miss Bayes looked quite ordi- nary, which may prove fine feathers make fine birds. The girls of the chorus quite outshone her. Mary Garden at the Strand this week was a slim Thais, but not a young one. The picture is done in the best of style aiid spells expensiveness and with a younger star might have created a furore. Miss Garden dresses the role to perfection, as to be expected from her. Had she learned the art of film a«:tinR as well, \"Thais\" would have been worth while. The many costumes are of the clinging Grecian fashion, show- F */^ il CABARE/T*. ac=3E t— rv the ^aniza- power *>day. ■uch tic, Tke restriction against anyone in U. S. service uniform being served with liquor has been of late enforced upon instructions in the New York restau- rants to the extent that no liquor may be served at a table where a man in uniform is seated, regardless the num- ber of civilians who may be at the same table The favorite plan to obtain^ a drink for one of the boys in service was to order one ginger ale high ball and one straight ginger ale. This often happened where one of the boys was accompanied only by a young woman. Then the drinks were switched. It ex- tended to parties and there was a gen- eral mixing of drinks often until the order was made in its present rigid form. At one restaurant not so long ago a small flock of little decanters such as are served in a buffet car were found beneath a table where ginger ale and soda had been the only drinks ordered from the bar. It has been hard to resist slipping a drink to anyone in the U. S. service on leave when all around a restaurant could be seen men of other allied nations in uniform drinking to their heart's content, the no-drink ukase affecting none but this country's boys. A lariat expert has been added to Healy's Golden Glades entertainers. He is Cuba Crutchfield, who first showed around here in a vaudeville act as The Crutchfields. Such an eminent authority as Will Rogers says Mr. Crutchfield is one of the best ropers the west ever held. He has many little tricks with t he ropes the east has not yet, seen. ing much back and Mary has a real Kittie Gordon back. I have never heard such hearty laughter as that caused by the latest Douglas Fairbanks picture, \"The Three Musketeers\" at the new Rivoli this week. The audience fairly howl- ed. Mr. Fairbanks was ably assisted by a pretty miss called Marjory Daw, in several well made frocks. Olive Tell, of the legitimate stage and also films, does very well with a rather inane picture called \"Her Sis- ter.\" Miss Tell's exquisite coloring is somewhat lost on the screen and in some close ups she looked rather aged, but that will probably be altered when she is more familiar with the peculiar- ities of picture make up. Tailored things are most becoming to this miss. A strikingly smart costume was a checked skirt with a sleeveless vest and a hard hat. An evening dress was of tulle with a sequin bodice. \"The Gown of Destiny,\" featuring Alma Reuben is a picture of unusual merit. An interesting story and war scenes make it a pleasure to watch. The gown around which the story is woven was well worth the title. The bodice of the sleeveless variety was of heavy lace. The skirt draped tight- ly around the figure was of silk, having a wide stripe. Several well made gewns as worn by Miss Reuben places her almost in a class by herself. What \"Parlor, Bedroom and Bath\" would have been without Florence Moore at the Republic is difficult to imagine. The farce is quite the raciest here in many a day. Miss Moore is surrounded by a cast (with the ex- ception of John Cumberland), who lore you to extinction. Three costume changes are made by Miss Moore. One a blue velvet and a rose velvet is fol- lowed by an ugly pair of pink satin pajamas. But it mattered not what Miss Moore wore — she has never been funnier than in this play. Crutchfield also talks wfiK through his tricks. It's an expe* at Healy's and the roper will work. the carpet over the ice. Morris Silver of Chicago has placed the following acts in middle west cabarets: Count Peronne and Trix Oliver for the Grand Pacific hotel, Chi- cago, and Beatrice Bosdyn for the same place ; Flo Jacobson and Lucille Palmer tor the Green Mill Gardens, Chicago; six acts for the Miami Hotel. Dayton, O. ; six acts for the Severn hotel, In- dianapolis. New Year's Eve the New York res- taurants remained open as long at they liked, despite all newspaper talk to the contrary before New Year's. Seme of the Broadway places closed Tuesday morning any time after six. The better known restaurants did a thriving trade with large buying crowds. Tke opening of the new \"Midnight Frolic\" last Saturday night was little short of a preliminary dress rehearsal The show was being shaped up this week. Realizing the performance was not in perfect condition, it is said Flo Ziegfeld wanted to announce it as a dress rehearsal, but was dissuaded. Jack LaFallotta, Forster representa- tive in San Francisco, appearing nightly at Solari's, boosting his firm's songs, did so well he was made an offer by the management which he could not ac- cept on account of his present affilia- tions. Tke Kenned? Bratkars, who former- ly conducted \"Kennedy's\" at 38th street and Broadway, have taken over the cafe that adjoins the Amsterdam thea- tre. Tke Moulin Range Gardens, Chicago, has added several new entertainers to the bill. Among them are Thelma Wil- liams, Mae Norton, Olive Morgan and Bud Worth. No liquor was sold in San Francisco cafes after two o'clock New Year's eve in compliance with Chief of Police White's orders. Tka Eastman sisters, '\"Florence of Denishawn,\" the St. Denis dancer and the U. S. Four are at the Edelweiss Gardens, Chicago. Art Penny closed at Levy's, Los An- geles, last week and opened at Solari's, J?un Francisco. Mabal McKinley is singing at the Vogue restaurant. SHOWS IN FRISCO. San Francisco, Jan. 2. \"Turn to the Right\" at the Columbia drawing big holiday business. The Alcazar, with Harry Corson Ciarke in \"Hello Bill,\" is drawing fairly. Considering a previous run of 10 weeks, \"Canary Cottage\" is doing well at the Cort in its second week. New AlwoocU Opens Feb. 22. Chicago, Jan. 2. The Alwoods Theatre will not be ready to optrn Feb, 1, as announced, and will probably swing its doors apart to the public Washington's birthday. Woods returned to New York on New Year's eve after patting his O. K. on the final details. 8 VAUDEVILLE t m • \\1 ' -. i ■ . IN THE SERVICE Harry J. Powers, Jr., son of the man- ager of Powers, Chicago, recently took his first flight in an aeroplane at an aviation school in California and wrote his father about the experience. He said: \"I went up about 5.500 feet and you get a wonderful view from that height. It certainly was a thrill. I can't begin to describe the feeling you have when you are that high up in the air. You don't feel a bit unsafe. Land- ing is the hardest at first, because it's difficult to tell how far from the ground you arc.\" Young Powers will shortly receive his commission as lieutenant. Billie Fordyce is in an English hos- pital, through wounds received in France. Oscar Mouvet, brother of the dancer, Maurice (Maurice and Walton, now dancing at the Hotel Biltmore, New York), has been severely wounded.

This over orange georgette, the whole over a silver lace skirt outlined with a design in bril- liants. The Columbia matinees last week were swollen considerably by the over- flow from the Palace. Rose Sydell's \"London Bells\" entertained auditors who had set out to see Sarah Bern- hardt! A barnyard scene with drop showing farm lands in the perspective lifted the company out of the \"palace set atmosphere.\" Titian-haired Kate Pullman, said to be an Eva Tanguay ( 1), is featured with the show. She pulled tom-boy stunts (some cartwheels she did were sad), and danced much throughout the show. Whether her manner meant self-satisfaction or in- difference it is hard to say. She was energy without personality. She looked best in the red, purple-lined dress worn at opening. Pretty blonde Dorothy Earle in peach silk and black-haired Frankie Burns made good opposites and should work more together than they do. A novelty worn by the chorus for the \"Dixie\" number was coarse- knitted wool one-piece bathing suits, looking like sweaters. The belts and collars were of a contrasting color. The girls were most all young and good looking with quantities of hair which they wore becomingly — but all seemed to have hard eyes, which may have been due to their makeups. One of the best workers in the show was a pretty blonde — first row, second from the end. As time tolled out the old year, at the Palace Monday night, Robert Em- mett Keane was in the middle of one of his best stories. After New Year gteetings were exchanged with the audience, Conductor Daab and Pat Rooney (who butted in from one of the wings), Mr. Keane asked the audi- tors to give three cheers for the big- gest man in American history — Wood- row Wilson. This they did right heart- ily. Stella Mayhew replaced Bern- hardt at this performance — looking ex- ceptionally well in black panne vel- vet. The long loose sleeves and front of bodice were of georgette — the lat- ter handsomely embroidered in jet. Two large diamond brooches seemed to hold up the back of bodice and an- other novel touch to the outfit was the white and black embroidered inserts on the insteps of her black silk hose. Miss Mayhew deplored the fact that she had to work alone now and pressed herself as surprised that \"Bill\" (Billie Taylor) had to go away to learn to fight when he had had so much expe- rience at home. On closer inspection the smart coat-dress worn by Inez Plummer (with Paul Dickey) appears to be sand instead of gray and the \"brown fur\" is beaver. Marion Bent opened in a white satin one-piece dress, its irregular side pan- els, collar and sleeves trimmed with bands of seal. Many buttons and but- ton holes, edged with emerald green, also trimmed frock. A cerise velvet wrap was worn over a lemon and orange georgette — the full overskirt held up at intervals by strings of col- ored beads. The girdle bodice, sash bustle and little Jap hat were of orien- tal brocade in variegated colors. Tas- sels of the colored beads fell from either side of hat. BY THE SKIRT. The \"Cohan Revue of 1918,\" while not as interesting as other things Mr. Cohan has done in the past, is so well dressed one doesn't mind the lack of snap and dash of other revues by this brilliant writer. What the chorus lacked in voice they made up in style. The first ensemble "
