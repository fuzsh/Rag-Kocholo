        "text": "St Kilda's match against Carlton in Wellington will commemorate a remarkable AFL coincidence that is also one of World War One's countless tragedies.\n\nFen McDonald made his debut for Carlton in round 15 of the 1911 season at Princes Park.\n\nTheir opponents were St Kilda, who also featured first-gamer Claude Crowl.\n\nSadly, their paths would also come together, for the last time, four years later.\n\nIt is understood they were killed 104 years ago during the April 25 Gallipoli landing.\n\nThe player voted best afield in Saturday's match will be awarded the Crowl McDonald Medal.\n\nThe two teams are also playing for the annual Simpson Henderson Cup.\n\nMost Australians have heard of Simpson and his donkey, Murphy, at Gallipoli.\n\nBut very few would know that after Simpson was killed, New Zealander Dick Henderson continued to use Murphy to ferry wounded soldiers to safety.\n\nHenderson also took enormous risks but, unlike Simpson, he survived the war.\n\nLike Simpson, he is a national hero.\n\nHenderson is honoured at Wellington's Pukeahu National War Memorial, which features the outstanding Great War exhibition.\n\nFamed movie director Sir Peter Jackson is behind the exhibition, which gives a small understanding of the hell soldiers went through on the Western Front.\n\nSt Kilda players Jarryn Geary and Josh Bruce were given a special tour of the exhibition on Friday.\n\n\"That was a whole new level in terms of interaction and putting you in the scene of being in there - it's a remarkable set-up,\" Geary said.\n\nThis is the third year St Kilda will host an AFL match in Wellington on Anzac Day.\n\nSaints chief executive Matt Finnis said commemorating the day overseas made it particularly poignant.\n\n\"It was really noticeable last year, attending the dawn service in Wellington, how much they incorporate the partnership between Australia and New Zealand in their ceremonies - perhaps more so than we do (in Australia),\" Finnis said.\n\n\"For us to be able to commemorate the centenary of Anzac in New Zealand, it's a really special opportunity.\""
