        "text": "Fourteen Saints were killed in action during the bloody war, which claimed the lives of over 40 million people. A further ten paid the ultimate sacrifice during World War II some decades later.\n\nSt Kilda added a Union Jack to its guernsey for the last two games of 1914, before trading out its white for yellow in a sign of solidarity for Allied Force, Belgium, who had several current and former St Kilda players fighting in their country.\n\nSt Kilda entered a period of recession during 1916 and 1917, reforming just shy of a year before the close of the war in November 1918.\n\nThe club’s traditional colour scheme of red, white and black was reinstated by 1923, complete with the tri-panel motif that would be engrained into the club’s visual identity for the next century.\n\nUnfortunately, the onset of the Roaring Twenties – the post-war period known for its prosperity, wealth and success – began with its 10th wooden spoon in 21 seasons of VFL. The Saints instigated another climb up the ladder in the ensuing years and – save for a last-place finish in 1924 – pieced together consistent and competitive football.\n\nThe invincible performances of Bill Mohr ushered in St Kilda’s most optimistic era since its formation some 50 years prior.\n\nThe powerhouse forward led the club’s goalkicking from 1929-1940, slotting an almighty 735 goals across his 195 games in the red, white and black.\n\nMohr became the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals in a season – taking out the League Goalkicker Medal in 1936 – and remains just one of three Saints to achieve the remarkable feat.\n\nThe boy from Wagga Wagga could boot goals from any angle, mastering the art from any distance, position or in-game predicament through any variety of kick.\n\nLike his successor Tony Lockett would in later years, Mohr had the capacity to provide a spark of hope to Saints fans on even the darkest of days. Likewise, he became one of the most outstanding full forwards in an era noted for producing the greatest batch of goalkickers in the game’s history.\n\nMohr left an indelible mark on the club that wouldn’t be filled until Lockett, but he wasn’t the only legend to find a unique place in club history during the 1930s.\n\nSt Kilda President Fred Arlington-Burke ordered medals adorned with the St Kilda Crest to be struck for every player. Ever since, the iconic emblem has been present on every single St Kilda guernsey.\n\nIt has become synonymous with the club motto Fortius Quo Fidelius – Strength Through Loyalty – and remains one of St Kilda’s most enduring symbols. It serves as a sign of bravery in the face of adversity, unwavering resilience and a reminder to never give in, even under the most dire of circumstances.\n\nThe VFL Lightning Premiership, or Patriotic Premiership, was organised between Rounds 14-15 of the 1940 VFL Season to raise funds for the wartime effort, which had broken out the year prior.\n\nThe one-day knockout competition saw all 12 teams compete in 20-minute matches, with the last team standing awarded a “fine cup” in reverence of their accomplishment.\n\nBill Mohr recovered sufficiently from injury to take part in the tournament, playing a hand in steering St Kilda to victories over Hawthorn, Carlton and Richmond.\n\nFootball was surrounded in a state of contention during wartime, but overseas, it became a uniting force for those far away from their homeland.\n\nThe Changi Football League, played at Changi Prison in Singapore, brought in excess of 15,000 Australian prisoners of war together during a time of incomprehensible suffering.\n\nThe makeshift league purportedly boasted some of the best talent ever seen.\n\nThe Corryong farmer was taken prisoner in March 1942 during the Fall of Singapore, but even in the worst conditions imaginable at Changi Prison proved an inspiration among the competition.\n\nChitty, who represented ‘Geelong’ in the league, was awarded the one and only Changi Brownlow after he led a side of Victorians against the best players across the rest of Australia, being presented the medal by former Brownlow medallist Wilfred ‘Chicken’ Smallhorn in front of his peers and captors.\n\nIt remained one of his most prized possessions after his eventual release and return to Australia by October 1945.\n\nJames “Jim” Wandin was St Kilda’s first ever Indigenous player, making 17 senior appearances from 1952-1953. Only nine other Indigenous players had debuted in the VFL before him.\n\nDespite racial vilification on and off the field, Wandin was proud that his struggles were part of reason why conditions improved for Indigenous players in later years.\n\nWandin was great-great nephew to William Barak, the last traditional ngurungaeta (tribal leader) of the Wurundjeri-Willam clan. He assumed the title following his football career and was involved in Indigenous Affairs with the Victorian Government.\n\nAlthough a diminutive figure, Killigrew was a towering and fearsome presence. His firebrand approach was pivotal in dragging the side he represented for 78 matches out from the depths.\n\nKilligrew’s pointed declaration was the impetus behind St Kilda’s subsequent rise, move to its spiritual home of Moorabbin and most importantly, long-awaited Premiership success.\n\n“Nobody would laugh at St Kilda.”"
