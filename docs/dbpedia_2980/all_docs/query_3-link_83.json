Wadleigh On October 6, 1884, the Secretary of the Navy, William E. Chandler, founded the Naval War College by a General Order which said simply, \"A college is hereby established for an advanced course of professional study for naval officers to be known as the Naval War College.\" Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce became the first president of what is now the oldest continuing institution of its kind in the world. Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of Pacific Forces in World War II, later recalled: The war with Japan had been reenacted in the game rooms at the Naval War College by so many people, and in so many different ways, that nothing that happened during the war was a surprise . . . absolutely nothing except the kamikaze tactics toward the end of the war; we had not visualized these. A book about an institution — especially a government institu- tion— can be deadly dull. Particu- larly if watered down to elimin- ate all the controversies, leaving only a bland recital of facts and figures.

Naval War College Executive Policy Group, May 1984, plus CNO 228 PRESIDENT'S FOREWORD One spring day in 1978 at a long forgotten meeting in Conolly Hall the idea of a centennial history was discussed. The Naval War College would be 100 years old in 1984 and its inception, growth and contribution spanned a period of incredible expansion in the history of the United States. The Navy's participation and that of its War College were inextricably woven into the fabric of those times and plainly deserved to be told. What better way than with a Centennial History? Vice Admiral James Stockdale, then President of the Naval War College, lent his prestige and support to the project and discussed it frequently and enthusiastically at meetings that followed in spring and summer of that year. It was no secret that preparation of a credible history took great patience, talent and time. A start in the near term, by qualified authors and researchers, was absolutely necessary if the work was to be finished in time for the Centennial celebration in 1984. In August, Jim Stockdale received his first serious proposal. Retired Rear Admiral John R. Wadleigh wrote that, \"such a history can be of benefit to the Navy and the War College and can serve as a worthwhile addition to naval and academic history.\" Jack Wadleigh proposed to team up with retired LCDR B. Mitchell (Tony) Simpson, III and compile \"a volume which will suitably commemorate the first century of service of the world's oldest senior military educational institution.\" Wadleigh and Simpson's proposal was everything it needed to be — detailed, logical and doable. In due course it was approved and the project was launched. By the time I arrived in Newport in the fall of 1982, the lion's share of the research was finished and drafts for many chapters had been prepared for comment. Fred Hartmann, my Academic Advisor and an experienced, accomplished author in his own right, became the project manager. Publishing a book, I was to learn, was not an uncomplicated effort and I needed a solid professional to navigate around the currents xii PRESIDENTS FOREWORD and shoals of the publishing world. Professor John Hattendorf, newly returned from the University of Singapore, joined the team next as the deadline loomed ever larger. John's expertise as an author and historian were invaluable ingredients that added to the already high quality of the research and assured us of success — on time. It was a collaboration that was close and continuous and one in which I took immense personal pride. Other principal members of the Naval War College team have contributed substantially to the production of this book. Mr. Frank Uhlig contributed wise counsel, sound editorial advice, and consistent guidance on style. Mr. Robert Laske handled printing arrangements for Library of Congress cataloging and provided a priority listing for distribution of the finished work. Mr. Roger Levesque handled the difficult and complex problem of the production of print-ready copy. Mr. Anthony Nicolosi made the initial selection of pictures and wrote the captions. Mr. Tony Sarro, with his usual flair, coordinated the design for the covers and the Centennial insignia. Special thanks go to Mrs. Carole Boiani for her outstanding work of phototypesetting, and to Barbara Atkins, Rose Lundy, and Rachelle Lapre of the Word Processing Branch, who made the initial inputs of the entire text. The demanding requirements of the final layout and pasteup of camera-ready copy were efficiently handled by Mrs. Eleanor Silvia, Mrs. Margaret Corr, and Mrs. Jackie Audet Cayer of the Editorial/Copyright Branch. My appreciation also extends to Ian Oliver, John Ramos, and Gerard Lamothe in the Graphics Arts Department. Photography was handled by James Deffet, William Arnold, and Thomas Cookinham. The Naval War College Foundation generously provided the financial backing which assured production of a book whose quality would in every way reflect the prestige and academic excellence of the Naval War College. It is my great personal pleasure to commend this history to you. It has been a rewarding professional opportunity for me, as 41st President, to direct the activities of the Naval War College in the last two years. The College continues to grow in importance and to justify the expectations of the Naval Establishment and the nation. I am sure that, as you read this history of the College, you will come away with some real sense of the human dramas which have marked the institution's evolution during a period which is almost exactly the second century of the national existence of the United States of America. James E. Service Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy President AUTHORS' PREFACE The Naval War College was founded in October 1 884 at a time when the U.S. Navy was a minor force among the world's naval powers. In the century since, extraordinary changes have taken place in the life of the nation, the role and size of its Navy, and the role and size of the Naval War College. This account of the life of the college in its first century is intended to present an overview of the major events and developments the college has experienced. It is not an \"institutional history,\" narrowly confined to events at the War College — a dry-as-dust recital of curricula changes. Since the Naval War College is the professional intellectual extension of the U.S. Navy, we thought it would be practical and useful to link the development and changes at the War College to the events affecting its parent and sponsor. And in portraying the Navy's development as a continuous background theme, we have also shown the gradual expansion of national policy. We believe that the history of the War College is made both more meaningful and certainly more interesting through this effort. Previously published accounts of the college's history have concen- trated on one period or another, or on a single aspect of concern. But there has been no reasonably concise history of the entire first century of the Naval War College for the informed reader. This volume seeks to fill that gap. Achieving a well balanced account is always challenging. The later history of the War College has its share of controversies (just as in the early decades] but with the difference that many participants in recent events are still alive to comment! We made it a rule to show all later sections of the manuscript to every principal participant. In some cases xiv PREFACE we had the demanding responsibility of deciding between directly opposing viewpoints. In writing this centennial history we had the considerable college archives at our disposal, which we have used and relied upon extensively. Unfortunately, for the early period of the college's history, up to about 1920, there was no deliberate and orderly collection or preservation of administrative documents. Valuable material remains from other aspects and other periods of the college's history. All the remaining records have been brought together and arranged in the Naval Historical Collection of the Naval War College in a readily accessible way for scholarly research through the dedicated effort of Anthony S. Nicolosi. Little of value could have been achieved without his preliminary work, and that of his assistant, Dr. Evelyn Cherpak. As archivists and manuscript curators their contribution is significant. We have gratefully utilized the valuable research on various periods carried out by scholars such as Rear Admiral John D. Hayes on Luce, Doris Maguire on Mahan and Chadwick, Dr. Robert Seager on Mahan, Dr. Ronald Spector on the early years of the college, Commander Thomas Buell on Spruance, King and Sound Military Decision, Dr. Gerald J. Kennedy on the inter- war years, and Commander Nepier Smith on the post war years. In addition we are deeply in debt to earlier college historians who blazed the trail for us with unpublished, typescript histories. We are particularly grateful for the work of Rear Admiral Austin Knight and Captain W. D. Puleston who prepared a draft history in 1916, and to the many college staff members who endeavored to up-date it in the years up to 1937. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, officers such as Captain Paul R. Schratz and his successors recorded useful data in their efforts to meet the requirement for the annual command history. The work of Dr. John T. Mason with the Naval Institute's Oral History Program has proved very useful and the copies of the growing collection of transcripts deposited in the college's Naval Historical Collection provided a valuable source. In preparing this history for publication, the detailed, candid and constructive editorial criticism of Frank Uhlig, Jr., quickly established high standards. We have gratefully followed his sound advice. We are particularly grateful to Frederick H. Hartmann, the college's Special Academic Advisor since 1966, for his patient and sustained advice, comments and suggestions. As our \"project manager,\" he piloted this project through all its phases. As a knowledgeable witness to many of the events since 1966, he provided valuable insights.

Wadleigh CHAPTER 1 THE NAVY THAT THE WAR COLLEGE JOINED A navy and its institutions reflect the nation they serve. In 1 884, the year the Naval War College was founded, the United States felt no great or imminent danger from the sea. Since the Civil War, the Navy's strength and capability had withered away because there had seemed no immediate need for a large navy. Writing in 1880, Chief Engineer J.W. King noted that epochs of exceptional naval activity alternated with periods of decay during the first century of American naval history. \"The several great national emergencies have each called forth most remarkable displays of maritime capabilities and powers,\" King wrote, \"to be followed, when the crisis is past, by a reversion to the other extreme of inefficiency and neglect.\"1 By comparison to Britain's Royal Navy, the largest in the world, the U.S. Navy with 92 ships, 32 of them in commission, and 8,000 officers and men, was small indeed. Britain had 359 ships with 63,598 officers and men, followed closely by France with 329 ships and 47,950 officers and men. There was then a large gap in relative numbers to the level of the Russian, Spanish, Italian, and German navies. After them ranked the navies of Brazil, Chile, and Argentina.2 Some people argued that its total numbers placed the U.S. Navy in the middle group. Others said it ranked only among the other navies of the western hemisphere, considering its poor equipment and training. A U.S. Senator from South Carolina declared that in battle with a \"vessel of any other power in the civilized world our guns would compare with theirs almost as a popgun with a long range rifle.\" Going further, he told the Senate I venture to say that the most insignificant, the least valuable ship of the Italian Navy is better than the best one in the American Navy.3 2 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS In 1 884, the only vessel classified as a first-rate ship on the U.S. Navy list was the wooden, steam frigate Tennessee, flagship of the North Atlantic Squadron. When the ship was sold in 1887, Secretary of the Navy William Whitney commented in his annual report for that year, \"She had a short life, but as a consumer of money, a brilliant one.\"4 Earlier the Secretary had reported to the President, \"It is questionable whether we have a single naval vessel finished and at sea at the present time that could be trusted to encounter the ships of any important power — a single vessel that has either the necessary armor for protection, speed for escape, or weapons for defense.\"5 In Washington, the Secretary directed the U.S. Navy from his office in the State-War-Navy building overlooking the west side of the White House. He was the only central figure in a cumbersome, decentralized administrative scheme that spawned bureaucratic competition. Since 1842, Secretaries had administered the Navy through eight indepen- dent Bureaus, each headed by a senior officer and each competing for prestige, power, and money. Often the lines of responsibility among the Bureaus were indistinct, and sometimes they overlapped. The Secretary personally sent all operational instructions, by mail or cable, to the five squadrons in the North and South Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, East Asian, and European waters.6 The most important of these petty principalities in 1884 was the Bureau of Navigation, headed by Commodore John G. Walker. Although the Secretary made all decisions on fleet operations, Walker's Bureau served as the means of implementing instructions. In the absence of the Secretary, the Chief of that Bureau became Acting Secretary. In addition, the Bureau of Navigation was responsible for officer assignments, for the Naval Academy, for the Office of Naval Intelligence, and for the Office of Naval Records and Library. When the Naval War College was established in 1 884, it was added to the Bureau's responsibilities. In Newport, Rhode Island, two other Bureaus had interests. The Bureau of Ordnance, under Commodore Montgomery Sicard, controlled the Naval Torpedo Station and its school on Goat Island, and the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting, under Commodore Earl English, was responsible for recruit training at the Naval Training Station, which shared Coasters Harbor Island with the College. Each head of a Bureau was equal to the heads of all the others. In the administrative structure, there was no single naval officer senior to any one of them. However, there was an Admiral of the Navy, the most senior officer on active duty. Although he held a position of great prestige and status, he had little authority or power. Since 1870, Admiral David Dixon Porter had held this position. Although his attempts to bring power and authority to his exalted rank ended in frustration, Porter remained an influential figure in naval affairs.7 THE NAVY THE WAR COLLEGE JOINED 3 To the casual observer, the U.S. Navy appears to have been at a low point in its history. Its ships were outmoded, it had little financial support from Congress, and it had a confused and overlapping system of administration. Yet beneath that superficial impression, deeper streams of development pointed toward a dramatic resurgence of American naval power over the next quarter century. Spur to World Naval Revival In international terms, 1884 was a turning point for navies. In England, the year marked the end of public complacency toward the Royal Navy. \"The Dark Ages of the Admiralty\" began to give way to the era of naval revival. Relations among the great powers had been generally calm for several years, but in 1884 the situation changed. Russian moves in Central Asia seemed to menace British India. Britain's refusal to evacuate Egypt irritated France, and German relations with England grew tense as Chancellor Bismarck encouraged German colonial expansion in Africa and the Pacific. To make matters worse, good relations between France and Germany created rumors that a continental maritime league was about to be formed against England. In September 1884, the Pall Mall Gazette published a series of anonymous articles which exposed the need for naval improvements at a time of growing crisis. Even the First Sea Lord joined the critics, asking for increased naval expenditure to keep pace with France, Germany, and the other great powers.8 The public outcry in 1884 forced the British government to increase dramatically its expenditures for warships, naval ordnance, and coaling stations.9 This political discus- sion was reported widely, bringing to the attention of the reading public in America the intensive naval building programs that were under way in Europe. By following the English political situation, readers learned of naval developments in France, Italy, Germany, and other countries and began to realize that the American Navy lagged far behind.10 In the United States, professional naval officers knew of these developments long before the public became aware of them. In 1877 and 1878, Chief Engineer J. W. King, USN, had been ordered to investigate European naval construction. He published his findings in 1880 in his book, The Warships and Navies of the World. American perceptions of these naval developments abroad helped to form criteria by which both the public and the professional naval officer judged the capabilities of the U.S. Navy. These perceptions were as important as those which correlated the Navy to American foreign policy. In 1884, the principal concern of American naval men was the U.S. Navy's traditionally defensive posture. Responsible American officials 4 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS focused entirely on two primary roles for the Navy, the defense of overseas trade and coast defense. It would be several years before imperialism and ideas of overseas expansion began to have a serious influence on naval policy and development. There were, however, a number of forces already at work that were turning American interests outward and that made possible future use of the Navy as an effective tool in seeking political goals beyond American waters.11 At the close of the American Civil War, the United States had the most numerous and innovative fleet of ironclad warships in the world. John Ericsson's monitor designs had provided the seed for future battleship design, but it was not developed in America after 1863. The decline from this far-reaching pinnacle down to a motley collection of obsolete and unarmored, steam-sailing vessels, armed largely with smooth bore ordnance, gave pause for reflection. One Secretary of the Navy reported that the accumulation of old hulls, machinery, and stores in the navy yards \"presents an unsightly appearance sometimes ghostly and discouraging to those whose labors are to be performed near it.\"12 The situation suggested, without any other factors, that a cleanup was necessary. It encouraged officers to seek a variety of ways to build up the Navy at a time when the prospects for future advancement, and even employment, in the Navy caused a great deal of anxiety.13 While the U.S. Navy had seriously declined in strength and capa- bility, it was not moribund. Its ships cruised worldwide. Although there were few ships in the fleet, perhaps insufficient for their limited purposes, they represented an established pattern of wide-ranging activity. Beginning with USS Ticonderoga's world cruise in 1878, the Navy Department was preoccupied with the Navy's role in protecting American overseas commerce. Naval officers commonly based their strategic views on the belief that a growing industrial nation, like the United States, must export its products in order to maintain harmony and prosperity at home.14 Several events in the 1870s and 1880s forced American naval men to think clearly and sensibly about the Navy's ability to carry out its traditional role in a period of decline. The first event was the Virginius affair in 1872-1873. This incident in the Cuban Revolution of 1868- 1878 had a profound effect by creating a situation which could have been dealt with by combined fleet action and amphibious operations. The inability of the U.S. Navy to act effectively raised a series of questions for American naval men about tactics, training, ship types, roles and the direction of the Navy in wartime. Although a minor incident in overall terms, the situation illuminated important and basic issues which were continually discussed by professionals over the next two decades.15 The importance of these same issues was THE NAVY THE WAR COLLEGE JOINED 5 underscored for American naval officers by the victory of Chile's new navy in the War of the Pacific, the threats to American interests created by French plans for a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, and German moves in Samoa.16 The means by which these various incidents were translated into impulses for a revived American Navy were complex, but the ideas that this process engendered were also those that contributed to the foundation of the Naval War College. Several subsequent developments that occurred in the 1 870s created the means of progress. First, the relationship between the Navy and Congress underwent a subtle transition. A change in the relative continuity of duties for congressmen, senators, and naval officers played an important part. In the early years, the Chiefs of Naval Bureaus remained in office for many years. Rear Admiral Joseph Smith, for example, headed the Bureau of Yards and Docks for a record 23 years between 1846 and 1869. On the other hand, there was a fairly rapid turnover in the memberships of the congressional committees dealing with naval affairs. By 1875, the situation had reversed so that Chiefs of Bureaus, and even Secretaries of the Navy, changed rapidly, while the average length of service on the congressional committees became much longer. In this way, men such as Eugene Hale could dominate the Senate Naval Affairs Committee from 1883 to 1911, and Washington C. Whitthorne and Benjamin Harris could serve important and continuing roles on the House committee which outlasted institutional conser- vatism within the Navy and changes in the White House. Second, the means to reform the Navy were facilitated by growing professionalization within the Navy. During the last decades of the 1 9th century, many occupations in America began to develop a sense of group identity, which was expressed by the formation of professional associations and journals that promoted the development of a specialized and theoretical knowledge relating to the occupation. In America, no occupational group had fully developed this status, but lawyers, doctors, educators, and engineers were each moving in this direction. Within the armed forces, the same developments were discernible. Since 1 845, the Naval Academy had provided a basis for the naval profession by creating a standard system of education and a means of officer selection. About the same time, naval lyceums were established at several navy yards as a means to promote discussion on naval issues. The New York Naval Lyceum published the first, but short-lived, professional journal, The Naval Magazine.16 A more effective and lasting professional organization, the U.S. Naval Institute, appeared in 1873. Organized by Stephen B. Luce, Foxhall Parker, and David Dixon Porter, the organization and its Proceedings became a primary vehicle for the advancement of professional and scientific knowledge among American naval officers. It became the 6 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS organization which was needed to elevate the naval officer's occupa- tion to professional status.19 By providing a means for officers to publish their professional thoughts, the Naval Institute cultivated a sense of mental determination and self-discipline among its members, which provided guidance and constructive thought for the naval revival in the United States. By 1884, the Naval Institute had served this function for more than 10 years and had made a great contribution by providing a basis for the formulation of a theoretical and compre- hensive maritime philosophy in the future as well as helping to define the need for professional education.20 Professional Development The professional development in the Navy took two forms which were, at the same time, complementary and competing. On one hand, officers saw the need to develop technical and scientific expertise which would allow full use of modern armaments. The establishment of the Torpedo Station on Goat Island in 1869 is an example of this approach. On the other hand, they also saw the need to develop the critical and analytical skills which would facilitate a full examination of the purposes, functions, and limitations of naval power and allow Officers to formulate effective strategy, tactics, and logistics. These two lines of development were complementary in their purpose, but they were built on quite different intellectual foundations that required different sets of academic values and different approaches in solving problems. Some, but not many, naval officers have excelled in both lines of professional development. This has created tensions and rivalries between those officers who favored one side of the professional outlook and those who chose the other. Members of each group supported the establishment of institutions that fostered and promoted their own professional outlook. Not uncommonly, some individuals believed that one or the other outlook should be not only preeminent but the exclusive basis of development. The tension between the two groups is readily discernible in the pages of the Naval Institute's Proceedings in the 1880s.21 In origins, however, one must go back to the controversy between the line and the staff which broke out following the estab- lishment of the engineer corps in 1 842. The wide-ranging and entangled debate was complicated by the fact that both groups were struggling for professional standards without clear-cut or fully developed concepts. It was an intellectual contest blurred by issues of status, authority, pay, and promotion.22 While the Naval Institute Proceedings provided the jousting ground for these debates, it, like other professional publications such as the THE NAVY THE WAR COLLEGE JOINED 7 Army-Navy Journal, was not an official journal and was not formally backed by any official organization. The first important, official organizational change within the Navy Department that reflected the new thinking was the establishment in 1882 of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI] within the Bureau of Navigation. In its early work, the Office of Naval Intelligence concentrated on collecting technical data about foreign naval construction, organization, and equipment. The information was useful and welcomed by Bureau Chiefs involved in planning the new American steel warships. Less welcome to such technical specialists was the tendency among officers in ONI to be distracted by broader war problems, higher strategy, and naval history.23 Link Between Historical Study and Naval Intelligence Naval history was a new area of inquiry. It was part of the development of the serious academic study of history that was only just beginning to be accepted. The first doctorates in history were awarded by Harvard University in 1876, and in 1881 the first academic chair in history was established at Cornell. In both America and England, the study of history was growing up outside the universities and then \"crashed the conservative academic portals\" to secure a permanent place. The early practitioners of naval history, such as John Knox Laughton, John Colomb, and A. T. Mahan, became more perceptive and accurate as they carried on with their pioneer work in the 1870s and 1880s. The impulse which set naval men reading about the past was clearly a growing dissatisfaction with the increasing narrowness of the technical viewpoint within the naval service.24 Increasing emphasis on naval improvement, material change, and industrial development was so readily accepted that little thought was given to the purpose and the use of the new machines. The newly forming school of history offered a means to consider naval issues in broad perspective unencumbered by the distractions of either contemporary political passion or rapidly advancing technology. Several American officers had already demonstrated a keen interest in naval history and had written historical articles for the Naval Institute's Proceedings during the 1870s. One of the leaders in this endeavor was Professor James R. Soley, a prolific writer, Naval Academy instructor, and international lawyer. In 1882, he was appointed Librarian of the Navy Department Library, in the Bureau of Navigation. Immediately upon taking up his duties, Soley consolidated the rare books scattered throughout Navy Department offices, established a collection of historical naval prints and photographs, and began to build the 7,000 volume collection. He also made the first serious attempt to collect and preserve American naval records. In 1884, 8 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS Congress encouraged Soley's efforts further by appropriating funds for the publication of the documents on naval operations in the Civil War. Although this series did not begin to appear in print until 1894, Soley began the initial work and research to gather and use these historical records as a means of \"ensuring the efficiency of the naval service.\"25 As a matter of administrative convenience during their early years, the newly established Office of Naval Intelligence and the Office of Naval Records and Library shared the same rooms in the State-War- Navy Building. The location of this early historical work close to the work of intelligence compilation created a link in the approach and concerns of both enterprises. Intelligence officers seemed to become increasingly interested in historical insight while the historical work was kept specifically on the professional and service aspects of the topic. The development of professionalism within the United States Navy, engendering both technological and analytical progress, was the hallmark of the naval revival in the 1880s. Numerous obstacles stood in the path, deflecting and slowing growth. Party rivalry in Congress, inexperience, defective administrative organization, lack of manu- facturing facilities, prejudices from the earlier period, as well as geographical and political isolation were all obstacles to be overcome but the work of naval reconstruction was clearly under way. In 1882, Congress had limited the amount of money that could be spent for repairing the old wooden ships, as a means to phase out the old ships. In the following year, Congress took the first step in replacing the old ships by authorizing four steel vessels, the nucleus of the \"New Navy.\" These were tentative steps which signified further change to come but required great effort in the future. By the end of 1884, Congress had compelled the retirement of many outmoded ships, but provision for an adequate number of new ships to replace them was still needed along with clear ideas for their design and use. In 1 884, the United States Navy was in a period of transition which reflected the broad developments in American intellectual per- ceptions, the growth of industrial power, technological progress, and general professional development. The undercurrents that created a new navy were already discernible even while the old appearances remained. Change was in the air, and suggestions for future development were heard in many different areas. In Newport, Rhode Island, The Mercury reported in the spring of 1884 that Coasters Harbor Island in Narragansett Bay might be the site of either a school for the advanced instruction of naval officers, or perhaps it would become the site of a naval asylum.

EN CHAPTER 2 A STRUGGLE FOR EXIS- TENCE: THE ERA OF LUCE AND MAHAN, 1884-1893 The idea of the Naval War College was conceived in the mind of Stephen B. Luce. Through Luce's outspoken leadership, the institution formed on his concept was both an expression and a part of the forces that were leading toward America's naval revival. All the reformers met many of the same obstacles, but the college represented a new element in the reform movement. Luce always saw the require- ment for a practical testing of ideas, but his college clearly emphasized the analytical line of professional development and, by its very intellectual foundations, differed from the technological approach. This different outlook created tension, and the War College became fair game in the endemic rivalry among the Bureaus in Washington. In July 1 884, Stephen B. Luce was appointed Acting Rear Admiral, in command of the North Atlantic Station. Having served more than 40 years on active duty, he had attained the senior and most prestigious flag assignment at sea. Luce was widely recognized as one of the most capable officers in the Navy at that time. He had served at sea in a variety of capacities, including the command of seven different ships under sail and steam. In 1863, Luce had commanded one of the Navy's most modern warships, the Ericsson-designed monitor Nantucket. Promoted to commodore in 1 88 1, he gained further practical experience for fleet work when he commanded the squadron of ships devoted to sea training for apprentice seamen.1 Training, administration, organization, and education were the princi- pal underlying themes of Luce's career. These were unusual types of activity for a naval man at the time, but Luce devoted his life to improving the Navy in these areas. Much of his experience and practical achievement and most of his published works were related to these professional subjects. 1 2 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS From his earliest days in the Navy, he expressed an interest in naval administration and education. As a lieutenant and instructor at the Naval Academy in 1861, Luce complained of the Navy's weakness in intellectual pursuits. \"Compared to the Army with their wealth of professional literature,\" he wrote, we in the Navy \"may be likened to the nomadic tribes of the East who are content with the vague tradition of the past.\"2 Even then, Luce was determined to do something about it. He started with practical textbooks. His first publication was a revised and updated gunnery manual. In the same year, he compiled the first seamanship textbook for the Naval Academy, a volume which would become, through later revision, the standard American work on the subject for nearly 30 years.3 Luce's association with the Naval Academy in 1860-1863 was important not only for his contributions to professional literature at that time but for his first close acquaintance with Newport, Rhode Island, where he would later choose to establish both a Naval Training Station and the Naval War College. Soon after the beginning of the Civil War in 1 86 1, the Naval Academy was moved north to Newport where it could continue its work more safely.4 There Luce saw that Newport offered some great advantages in education for naval officers. In Annapolis, \"it is always the battalion, the musket, a banner, and a drum and fife!\" But at Newport \"it was different; there in a seaport town the youngsters inhaled the sea breezes by day and at night were lulled to rest by the roar of the Atlantic surf.\" Above all, Newport offered a location where students \"can come in daily contact with seamen fresh from the ocean.\"5 It was not only Newport, but Coasters Harbor Island in Narragansett Bay, which struck Luce as an ideal place for a naval school. Remem- bering his days as a lieutenant commander at the Naval Academy in Newport, Luce recalled that in 1863 \"Commodore Blake, the superin- tendent of the Naval Academy, at that time in the Atlantic Hotel, Touro Park, Newport, R.I. invited me to accompany him on a drive to look at a site at Coasters Harbor Island for a new building for the Naval Academy. Mr. George Mason, an architect of Newport, made one of the party. Mr. Mason was then engaged in preparing plans under the Commodore's direction for the building; for there was good reason then for thinking that the Naval Academy would remain in Newport permanently . . . , The proposed site was on Coasters Harbor Island. As we stood on the highest point of the Island . . . and looked upon the broad expanse of the waters of Narragansett Bay, the Commodore grew very eloquent upon the many advantages of the harbor and bay as a naval station, and the perfect adaptability of the site where we stood for a Naval Academy. The very favorable impression made upon my mind at that time was never effaced.\"6 Despite Commodore Blake's plans, the THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1893 13 Academy returned to Annapolis, but even before that Luce was ordered to command the monitor Nantucket in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. While in command of Nantucket, Luce began to write his first series of articles which suggested plans for improving naval apprentice training and creating a parallel program for the merchant marine. With these articles, the young naval officer began a long connection with W. C. Church's Army and Navy Journal and publicly laid the foundation for his lifetime campaign to improve nautical education and training. Luce's first success came in the campaign for merchant marine schools. His active work directly resulted in the Marine Schools Act passed by Congress in 1874 and the establishment of what later became the State University of New York Maritime College at Fort Schuyler.7 Luce's campaign for the improvement of professional naval education and training proved to be a far more complicated affair. He had in mind a complete view which included the training of apprentice seamen, chiefly in gunnery, engineering, and practical seamanship. Luce added both religious and naval instruction and stressed the value for apprentice training in old Navy ballads and songs as well as in naval history. Luce's plans came to fruition with congressional authorization in 1875 for the enlistment of 750 sixteen to eighteen-year-old boys into the Navy. The USS Minnesota was made the naval apprentice training ship.8 At the same time, Luce approached the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and pointed out that the new Marine Schools Act of 1874 authorized the establishment of a branch, in an already established institution, for instruction in naval architecture and marine engineering. Although the MIT president encouraged Luce and others to join in the effort, a school of naval architecture was not established at MIT until 18 years later.9 In 1877, Luce took command of the Minnesota and devoted himself to developing an enlisted training program on a permanent and uniform basis. The acrimonious debate that ensued centered on such issues as the value of sail training, the control of training by a Bureau that would support it, and the location of a base for enlisted training.10 By the 1 890s Luce's position on sail training had been soundly defeated, and young apprentices were moved ashore where close order drill replaced the discipline of handling yard, sail, and sheet. Despite this setback to his ideas, Luce remained a major force in developing the enlisted training program.11 In the process, he achieved one success which later found a place in his plans for advanced officer education. Luce believed that the apprentice training program could reach its potential quickly if the various elements of training were united in one place, under one man. In November 1880, the Secretary of the Navy appointed Luce to a board of officers to select a location for, the headquarters of the 14 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS apprentice training squadron. After careful consideration of both New London, Connecticut, and a site near Newport, Rhode Island, the board chose Coasters Harbor Island in Narragansett Bay. Luce had already prepared the way for this decision by encouraging in 1 878 the establishment of a committee of the Rhode Island General Assembly to select a suitable site in Narragansett Bay for a training station and, at the same time, encouraging the city fathers of Newport to give to the Navy Coasters Harbor Island where the city poorhouse was located. \"The object and sole object,\" Luce wrote, \"in getting possession of the Island was to have a place where the boys might land occasionally for drills under arms and recreation.\" The apprentices lived on board the anchored ship-of-the-line New Hampshire, swinging to the wind and tide just to the south of Coasters Harbor, where the apprentices could become accustomed to shipboard life. On 16 December 1880, the Secretary of the Navy designated the island a temporary training station. Following this, on 9 February 1881, the State Assembly of Rhode Island ordered the island to be ceded to the federal government by a deed dated 2 March 1881. The station was made a permanent one on 4 June 1883 after Congress formally accepted the gift.12 With this work done, Luce wrote to his son-in-law in July 1883: My great hobby now — now that the Training System is fairly established — is to erect a \"War School\" for officers, the prime object being to teach officers the science of their own profession, the Science of War ... I have the plan roughly mapped out and the Alms House on this Island is to be the College . . . Whether it will end in smoke or not I cannot say . . . . 13 The Concept of the War College The idea of a college for professional naval officers to study the science of warfare was a much more complex and intellectual problem than Luce had faced in his plans for merchant marine or apprentice training. Those had required training in specific, practical skills. The War College, in Luce's mind, went far beyond that to educating the mind for perception and analysis. Luce, a self-educated man, was well read and sensitive to the new intellectual trends of his day. Following Herbert Spencer, the English philosopher, who applied the principles of evolutionary progress to all branches of knowledge, Luce believed that education was a process through which each individual discovered for himself the nature of the world around him. To Luce, truth and understanding were found through the discernment of basic and immutable laws in nature. As scientists had demonstrated that there were basic physical laws of the THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1 893 1 5 universe, Luce and many others believed that similar laws could be found in human affairs. These, however, were to be discovered by individual reading and research in a cooperative effort by a wide variety of people. Luce thought that laws of human nature could be found through two complementary methods of reasoning, the comparative and the inductive. The comparative method was reasoning by analogy. Here Luce saw great relevance in examining the recent developments in studies of law, history, literature, science, technology, and education. In this he was profoundly influenced by his reading of the historian Thomas Buckle and the philologist Friedrich Max Miiller, both of whom were great exponents of comparative study. Luce drew from them his conviction that the comparative method was essential to establishing a science of naval warfare. Going a step further, he saw that the study of naval warfare must be coordinated with military science and art. The complementary approach to the comparative method was through inductive reasoning, by which a person proceeded from thinking about specific events to making broad generalizations. The generalizations, however, were conceived at a level of understanding that was thoroughly steeped in theoretical developments in a wide variety of fields. In all of this, the study of history was important. Luce thoroughly agreed with the historian Macaulay that \"no past event has any intrinsic importance; the knowledge of it is valuable only as it leads to form just calculations for the future.\" Like Lord Bolingbroke, Luce firmly believed that \"History is philosophy teaching by example.\"14 The value in historical study was to be found in its effects on individual thinking, on the process which comes from dealing with a range of specific examples and developing generalizations from them. Luce believed that a theoretical basis could be developed for the naval profession. He saw the technological revolution that was about to transform the Navy, and he proposed an intellectual method by which professional officers could effectively deal with the technolog- ical conundrums of the new Navy. Luce believed that first one must understand what a Navy does and why it exists, before one can effectively select the means, the tactics, and the weapons by which it is to be employed. Luce developed his ideas largely through his wide reading and extensive professional experience, but he was also influenced by several individuals in the process. He believed that the seed of his thinking was planted in January 1 865, when he met General William T. Sherman during the siege of Charleston, South Carolina. Sherman explained the Navy's strategic failures in a few sentences and declared that he would make the city fall without a battle. \"I will cut her 1 6 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS communications and Charleston will fall into your hands like a ripe pear\" Sherman said, \"and that is just exactly what came to pass,\" Luce related.15 This demonstration of military thinking was a revelation for Luce and opened his eyes to the proposition that certain fundamental ideas underlay operations. \"In other words,\" Luce wrote later, \"the Civil War demonstrated conclusively the necessity of a War College and a general staff.\"16 In Luce's mind, the War College was the essential prerequisite for the establishment of proper military direction of the armed forces, so it was on education that he concentrated first. Establishing a College About 1877, Luce encountered a second Army officer who stimulated his thought further along this line. This was Brigadier General Emory Upton, then commanding the Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Hampton Roads, Virginia. Based on ideas that had come out of American military experience in the Civil War and were merged with the new trends in thought revealed by German success in the Franco-Prussian War, the Army's Artillery School had become America's model institution of higher military learning. Like the Navy, the U.S. Army was passing through a period of decline, neglect, and struggle for professional identity. Upton was one of the Army's leaders who fostered the cultivation of professional study and encouraged others along the same lines.17 It is not surprising that two like minded men found much to share. While in command of a ship at Norfolk, Luce had met Upton and had an opportunity to examine the curriculum of Upton's school. On 8 August 1877, Luce wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, forwarding a copy of the \"Programme of Instruction\" at the Artillery School and recommending that a similar school be established for the Navy. \"The leading feature of the postgraduate course would be the carrying of the young officers through a course of instruction in the Art of War,\" Luce wrote, adding Extraordinary as it may appear, the naval officer whose principal business is to fight is not taught the higher branches of his profession. The U.S. is not singular in this respect. The defect is common to nearly all navies and is an inheritance of a past and less enlightened age. But with the recent revolution in naval warfare comes a demand for a higher order of talent in the conduct of naval operation . . . . 18 Luce shared his ideas with Upton who supported and encouraged them. After reading one of Luce's articles, Upton wrote to him, \"It gave me quite new ideas as to the similarity between land and naval tactics, and I can now fully comprehend your scheme in relation to a THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1893 17 postgraduate course as a means of educating the officers of the Navy in the strategy and tactics of their profession.\"19 Although the Secretary of the Navy seemed to receive Luce's proposal favorably, no action was taken to establish a new school. In April 1883, Luce again took the initiative. In a lecture before the recently formed Newport Chapter of the United States Naval Institute, he described the various \"War Schools\" that the Army had established, and focused primarily on the Artillery School at Fort Monroe. Luce emphasized the Army's precedent and stressed that naval officers, as well as army officers, should have the basic knowledge of the art and practice of war \"so far as it can be acquired from books.\" In addition, the naval officer \"should be led into a philosophic study of naval history\" so that he might see the manner in which theory has been illustrated and where a disregard of it had led to disaster.20 During 1 883, Luce found another means of getting his ideas across to the people who could implement them. In the summer of 1882, he had been appointed senior member of a commission to investigate Navy yards. The Commission's final report was completed in December 1 883, and gave Luce the additional opportunity to present to the Secretary of the Navy and senior officers his ideas on naval education, strategy and administration. At the same time, he encouraged the editor of the Army and Navy Journal to publish articles on the subject, and \"thus start a controversy and a BOOM.\"21 On 6 November 1882, Luce wrote a formal letter to Secretary of the Navy W. E. Chandler recommending a naval school for \"the higher branches of the naval profession: the science of war, naval tactics, military and naval history, international law, military and naval law, modern languages, and such elective branches as might be found desirable.\"22 Citing the Artillery School at Fort Monroe and the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth \"as examples worthy of imitation,\" Luce went on to point out that with the land and buildings on Coasters Harbor Island readily available, the plan could be put into effect immediately with no congressional action required \"and but trifling expense.\"23 Following conversations with Chandler and Admiral of the Navy D. D. Porter in early 1884, Luce submitted a draft General Order for the Secretary to issue.24 In response to this letter, Chandler ordered on 30 May 1884 that Luce be president of a board to consider and report on the subject. Lieutenant Commander Caspar F. Goodrich and Captain William T. Sampson were ordered as members of the board. Before meeting, Luce wrote to both younger officers, suggesting that they read his article on \"War Schools\" and consider his opinion \"that we should have for the Navy what the Army has in the schools at Fort Monroe and at Fort Leavenworth.\"25 They were also asked to review, as a possible 1 8 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS model, the organization of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich, which was described in Professor Soley's book on Naval Education.16 Greenwich and its predecessor at Portsmouth had offered higher technical training to officers since 1 839. It was at Greenwich that John Knox Laughton began the modern study of naval history in 1874, although the subject played little role in its curriculum. The purpose of this board was to discuss the proposal and to draw up a plan of organization for the proposed college. It was not a forum for discussion of opposing views. Luce had already raised strong opposition by his published article. Notable among the opponents was Captain F. M. Ramsey, the Superintendent of the Naval Academy, who believed that the War College would detract from the Academy's course of instruction by creating a rival academy.27 Others wanted to amalgamate it with the Torpedo Station School on Goat Island, but Luce, with Sampson and Goodrich, set out to define the character of the new college. In a report written on board the flagship of the Training Squadron, USS New Hampshire, then moored at South Point on Coasters Harbor Island, the three agreed that naval officers are \"too apt to lose sight of the ultimate object of all\" and become devoted to the application of electricity to torpedoes, chemistry to explosives, or metallurgy to ordnance instead of the central issue, \"success in war.\"28 The board of officers declared that the United States Navy should have a place where our officers will not only be encouraged, but required, to study their profession proper — war — in a far more thorough manner than has ever heretofore been attempted, and to bring to the investigation of the various problems of modern naval warfare the scientific methods adopted in other professions.29 The fact that the United States had no adequate naval force at the time made it even more difficult for officers to gain professional knowledge. Luce, Goodrich, and Sampson believed that a War College was an absolute necessity in that situation. Like other professions, the Navy was beginning to form specialties of knowledge among its officers, and the board believed that in this process, warfare, \"the one subject par excellence of the naval profession\" was being ignored. \"Failing to produce specialists in this one branch, we fail utterly in our whole system of naval education, for all others are but subordinate or accessory.\" The board also outlined a proposed course for the college. To appease the opposition, the board suggested that the course could be linked with and supplement the technical course in ordnance at the Torpedo Station on Goat Island by offering an additional six months' study in the science and art of war, law, and history. The courses in war would include study of strategy, tactics, and campaigns, from the military, THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1893 19 naval, and joint standpoints. \"As the principles underlying all hostile movements are at bottom the same, whatever be the nature of the field of action, the board is of the opinion that an intimate knowledge of military operations is essential to the naval strategist.\"30 The war course would also be paralleled by a study of modern political history and general naval history. In addition, international law was added as a subject \"of the utmost importance in its bearing upon action taken by our naval commanders abroad.\" The board recognized that the college would eventually need to provide additional courses that would accommodate \"the increased complexity of certain branches of the profession,\" but these should be offered as electives in a way that did not detract from the main thrust of the study of warfare. For all the college's academic work, the board recommended that no one should be permitted to engage in the courses who could not pass a satisfactory examination. Additionally, those who finished the instruc- tion with credit were to receive certificates of proficiency and a signifying letter or mark would be placed by their names in the Navy Register as a means of denoting their professional attainment. The board, however, did not conceive only of academic and library study. Luce, in particular, believed that practical tactical exercises were an important part of the curriculum. The board suggested that \"the North Atlantic Squadron affords the nearest approach to be found to a proper course in naval tactics.\" It also suggested that at a stated time, once a year, the squadron should demonstrate the whole range of its operation for the college class. That factor made Newport the best choice among the other locations contending for the school: Washington, Annapolis, New York, and Boston. Among them, only Boston and Newport had buildings and ground readily available. Boston had the eminent professors and excellent libraries available, but they were also within reach of Newport. As a seaport with ready access to the fleet, Newport offered \"exceptional advantages,\" as Luce had seen many years before. In addition to an excellent anchorage for the fleet, the Torpedo School could readily extend its technical instruction in sciences in a way that would complement the War College's course of study. War College students could also avail themselves of special courses at \"the great institutions of learning at Boston.\" When the report was submitted in mid-June 1884, Luce was still Commander of the Training Squadron. A month later he was ordered to command the North Atlantic Squadron with the rank of acting rear admiral. With approval for his fledgling Naval War College imminent, Luce preferred to continue his work for the college rather than accept permanent appointment as rear admiral in command of the squadron. 20 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS Before relinquishing his command, and resuming the rank of commodore, Luce welcomed home from the Arctic the Greely Relief Expedition, entertained President Chester A. Arthur when he visited the squadron, and conducted one of the Navy's first amphibious exercises at Gardiners Island, near the eastern end of Long Island. As early as February 1 884, Luce had begun to cast about for possible faculty members. He first approached Caspar Goodrich to take up the position in naval strategy and tactics, which later was given to Mahan.31 Among others, he requested Richard Wainwright and Professor J. R. Soley and began to search for an Army officer as well.32 Even before the War College was formally established, Luce was detached from command of the squadron and ordered to assume the duties as \"Superintendent of the College at Coasters Harbor Island.\" Reporting the changes of command which took place on board USS Tennessee in Newport Harbor, the Army and Navy Journal noted Commodore Luce is expected to come to Washington shortly for the purpose of consulting with Secretary Chandler regarding the establishment of the postgraduate school. He has not been communicated with on the subject, but his coming is regarded as a matter of course. He was relieved from the command of the North Atlantic Station by Commodore Jouett on the 20th of September, with the usual ceremonies, with the addition of a salute from the Torpedo Station. The two officers made brief addresses to the officers and crew. Immediately after being relieved of the command of the squadron, Commodore Luce proceeded in his barge to Coasters Harbor Island to carry out his orders. He was accompanied by Captain Yates and Lieutenant Symonds, of the New Hampshire, and by the members of his late staff, Lieutenants Very, Tilley, and Mulligan, Ensign Everett, and Midshipman Wells. Arriving at the building on the island, he put his hand on the door and said: \"Know all men by these presents, and in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I christen this building the War College of the American Navy.\"33 Three weeks later the same journal reported, \"the new col- lege . . . has been dubbed by naval officers at the Navy Department, the 'Trinity College,' a name they have derived from the manner in which the institution was christened.\"34 On 6 October, Secretary of the Navy Chandler signed General Order 325 which formally estab- lished the Naval War College as \"an advanced course of professional study.\" The principal building on the island with the surrounding structures and immediately adjacent grounds was thereby transferred from the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting to the Bureau of Navigation. At the same time, the War College was placed in charge of a president, not to be below the rank of commander. He, with the faculty, constituted a board that was given authority to arrange the THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1893 21 course of instruction. The course was to be opened to all officers above the grade of naval cadet.35 With its formal establishment, the Naval War College entered the endless bureaucratic struggle within the Navy. From the outset, the placement side by side on the same island of two separate entities, belonging to two different bureaus, created difficulty. Even though both were the product of Luce's effort, the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting saw the War College as an intruder from the Bureau of Navigation on an island that rightly belonged to the Training Station. At the same time, officers at the Naval Academy in Annapolis feared that the War College was a kind of academic postgraduate school that would become a rival. Despite the orders given to establish the Naval War College, no immediate action was taken to carry them out. Only Luce was on the scene. In order to draw attention to the new enterprise, he wrote an article for the United Service Magazine, clearly pointing out the rationale behind it, and simultaneously persuaded the Army and Navy Journal to publicize the college. Luce was also in close contact with Rhode Island Senator Nelson Aldrich in making plans for the college. By early February 1885, still no action had been taken for the college. To inquire into this matter, the U.S. Senate adopted a resolution directing the Secretary of the Navy to report to the Senate on the steps that were being taken. The report was made, but no funds were allotted to the college. Eventually, naval officers were ordered to the college as students. In the first class there would be four lieutenant commanders and five lieutenants. The First Course At the opening ceremony of the War College, on 4 September 1885, Rear Admiral Daniel Ammen, a distinguished officer and author of a naval history of the Civil War, gave the main address. Aware that he was dedicating a new enterprise, he told the students that it was a matter of prime necessity for the nation to have officers who under- stood the nature of war. A school such as Annapolis provided a basis of understanding the special appliances required for war. But here, in Newport, he said, the \"economy of war\" should be a specialty, \"that we may not sacrifice ourselves and those under us unnecessarily.\"36 With those thoughts in the minds of the small audience, Luce brought attention to the fact that it was an inauspicious beginning for such a serious and important purpose. With no money for books, furniture, heat, or light, Luce reminded the audience that the building offered little but shelter from the winds of Narragansett Bay. The cornerstone for the building had been laid on 25 June 1819 to be Newport's 22 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS poorhouse and deaf and dumb asylum. Luce declared the college open by saying, \"poor little Poorhouse, I christen thee the United States Naval War College.\"37 The class that convened for the next four weeks made do with borrowed furniture and could hear only the visiting lecturers who were willing to spend their own time and money to come to the college. The first course was hardly what Luce had hoped to have, but it was the best he could get. Professor James Soley temporarily left his duties as librarian in the Navy Department to lecture on international law. The Army sent Lieutenant Tasker Bliss to lecture on military affairs, and Luce gave several lectures.38 Less than a week after the opening of the first class, Admiral Luce participated in the dedication ceremony of a statue to one of Newport's naval heroes, Oliver Hazard Perry. Ironically, the ceremony brought Luce together with another important figure in naval education, the Newport summer resident and historian George Bancroft, who as Secretary of the Navy in 1845 had established the Naval Academy. Luce took the opportunity to point out the difference between the two institutions. The War College was designed, he said, to take the academy graduate, only after an interval of sea service, into the highest realm of professional thought: war. \"That particular name has been given to the college in order that its special mission may be kept steadily in view — that it may never be lost sight of,\" he said. \"War and its cognate branches constitute the college curriculum. It is only by a close study of the science and art of war that we can be prepared for war, and thus go very far toward securing peace.\"39 Luce explained that the college was not an ordinary course of instruction, \"not teaching war,\" but giving the student the opportunity of understanding it.40 Many years later, he explained his idea further when he declared that \"there are no professors competent to teach\" warfare. \"All that the College can do,\" he said, \"all that it professes to do, is to invite officers to come to it; and to offer them every facility for pursuing the study . . . All here, faculty and class alike, occupy the same plane, without distinction of age, rank, or assumption of superior attainments . . . In the beginning I, myself, . . . announced myself as one of the class in attendance .... \"41 The War College, Luce believed, \"is a place of original research on all questions relating to war and to statesmanship connected with war, or the prevention of war.\"42 The concept that lay behind the college was not widely understood. Critics poked fun at the Navy for having as its only full-time staff member an Army lieutenant. Despite the criticism, Luce was generally pleased by the first experiment and set about plans for the next session to open in the following year. In January 1886, however, Luce was THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1893 23 promoted to the permanent grade of rear admiral and ordered again to sea in command of the North Atlantic Squadron. Mahan's Arrival In September 1885, Luce had arranged for Captain Alfred T. Mahan to be ordered to the college to be lecturer in naval strategy and tactics. Enroute from command of a ship on the South American station, Mahan was ordered home to New York to pursue studies at the Astor Library and the New York Public Library in preparation for the Naval War College course beginning in September 1886. Meeting Mahan at Newport on 20 October 1885 to discuss plans, Luce directed Mahan to work in two areas, fleet battle tactics and history. In Luce's mind, these two subjects were directly related. He stressed to Mahan that he should employ the comparative method, avoid the purely naval point of view, and consider the interrelationships among naval and military tactics, strategy, diplomacy, and national power. As Mahan wrote to his old friend and Academy classmate, Samuel Ashe, I want if I can to wrest something out of the old wooden sides and 24-pounders that will throw some light on the combinations to be used with ironclads, rifled guns, and torpedoes; and to raise the profession in the eyes of its members by a clearer comprehension of the great part it has played in the world than I myself have hitherto had.43 This work became his lectures in the following year and resulted five years later in Mahan's first famous book, The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1 660- 1 783. Although he would become the most famous member of the college in its early years, Mahan's work was only part of the concept that Luce had in mind. Luce had been able to win, at least temporarily, the favor of the Bureaus in Washington, gain an $8,000 appropriation for its maintenance, accumulate a small library through gifts, and arrange for the main lecturers. Tasker Bliss of the Army was still the only permanently assigned officer, other than the president of the college. With Luce's departure in June and Mahan's arrival delayed until August, there was no activity at the college that summer. When Mahan arrived to take up residence in the college building, he discovered that he was its sole occupant, Bliss having accommodations in town. \"As I walked around the lonely halls and stairways,\" Mahan wrote, \"I might have parodied Louis XIV, and said, \"Le College, c'est moi.\" Although there was a steward who made his meals and his bed, Mahan commented, There was but one lamp available, which I had to carry with me when I went from room to room by night; and indeed, except for the roof over my head, I might be said to be 'camping out.'44 24 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS When the class convened on 6 September for the two-and-a-half- month course, 21 officers attended, including two commanders, eleven lieutenants, six ensigns, and two Marine Corps officers. The course was more successfully modeled on Luce's plan than the first year had been. Sixteen lectures were on the tactics of naval gunnery, by Lieutenant William B. Hoff, the author of a recent book on the subject. Professor Soley returned again from Washington with a series of 20 lectures on international law dealing with the relations of states, in both peace and war. Lieutenant Bliss gave 18 lectures on military tactics, minor military operations, and the principles of modern strategy. Additional lectures were given on subjects of general interest such as coastal defense, hygiene, and Civil War history. During the first 10 days of the course, Rear Admiral Luce was present with his flagship, USS Tennessee, which he allowed the college students to use for practical exercises 45 In general, its friends praised the small beginnings of the college and were heartened by the progress of its second year. The Admiral of the Navy, David Dixon Porter, wrote in his annual report, \"The War College has had a struggle for existence owing to the prejudice existing against it in the Navy, although none of those who have antagonized the institution can give a single good reason why it should not be fostered.\"46 A retired lieutenant, William McCarty Little, was one of the enthusiastic supporters of the War College. Forced to leave active duty following an eye injury, McCarty Little volunteered his services to Luce at the opening of the college. He continued to work with Mahan by drawing some of the maps that Mahan used in his lectures and that later appeared in his books. At the same time, Mahan and McCarty Little, working together, devised a system to examine and to explain the tactics of historic battles by using cardboard vessels of different colors for the contending navies moved over a sheet of drawing paper. When satisfied that the graphic representation corresponded with the facts and the technical conditions, Mahan then fastened the cardboard in place. Through this method, Mahan and Little were able to apply their technical knowledge of ships and begin to work out with care the principles of naval tactics. This was the beginning of war gaming at the college. McCarty Little began to develop the idea further and suggested some broader uses of war gaming in his lecture on \"Colomb's Naval Duel Game,\" delivered to the 1886 class.47 As the second year of the War College drew to a close, Mahan reflected his thoughts and his new situation when he wrote to a friend, Our position entirely out of Newport, indeed in the very opposite direction from the fashionable quarter, has advantages of view and air over the latter. The island which is connected by causeway with THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1884-1 893 25 the main is windswept and almost treeless, but the old house (formerly an almshouse) faces the Seabreeze and looks straight down the narrow entrance through which, over a hundred years ago, D'Estaing sailed in with the French fleet under the fire of the English batteries . . . . 48 By the end of the course, Mahan was pleased that the college had managed to stay clear of the kind of postgraduate course that might be considered a follow-on to instruction at Annapolis. As Luce had planned, the War College devoted itself to the much needed, broadly based study of warfare. \"The want had been proved, and a means of filling it offered,\" Mahan wrote, and \"the listeners had been per- suaded.\"49 Mahan's optimism stemmed from his academic success, but at the same time a serious threat was brewing in Washington. In the autumn of 1886, Mahan suddenly realized that there was strong opposition to the War College in Congress. Hilary Herbert, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, considered the college a postgraduate school, and therefore, better placed in Annapolis where the laboratories and equipment already existed. He let it be known that he would prevent any appropriation to support the college. Mahan began immediately to develop a campaign to protect the college. He believed that if technical subjects were allowed into the curriculum, inevitably they would predominate over the study of warfare. The college would then decline into an instrumentality merely to promote mechanical perfection. He decided to avoid any discussion of materiel, thus removing grounds for the argument that the college was a postgraduate school. At the same time, influential officers such as Francis M. Ramsay and Winfield Scott Schley criticized the college for its emphasis on the comparative approach as a means of developing naval theory. Mahan pled his case before congressional leaders. He failed. About Herbert, Mahan later wrote, \"In vain did I try to divert his thoughts ... He stopped his ears like Ulysses, and kept his eyes fixed on the necessity of strangling vipers in their cradle.\"50 Despite the support of many others, the War College received no money for 1887. In writing to Senator Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island, Mahan apologized for the appearance of his letter, \"The poverty of the college does not admit of my having a clerk — and the typewriting is done by the kindness of my aide, who is not yet very expert.\"51 As winter came on, there was no fuel to heat the building. Mahan submitted a request through the routine channels, and coal was delivered before Washington noticed that there was no appropriation to pay for it. Finding that the delivery had already been made, officials in Wash- ington eventually decided not to freeze the college out literally, but paid for the coal through the Bureau to which the Training Station 26 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS belonged. A fact \"which would not nullify its feelings,\" Mahan commented. Mahan searched through the refuse left over from converting the poorhouse into a school and dwelling. He collected, sorted, and sold the bits and pieces to support the college, using some of it to purchase books for the college's small library. Later, Mahan looked back with pleasure on his two years living in the old building. In so isolated and exposed a location, the thick walls and small windows of the building proved to be a great advantage. After the first repairs were completed, Mahan and his family never suffered from cold in the winter or heat in the summer. The rooms on the front, or south side, were both warmer in winter and airy in the summer, and Mahan nearly always kept his office window open. Although it was not large, the building housed not only Mahan's quarters but also rooms for teaching, offices, library, and a lecture room. Mahan tried to separate home and school, but visiting lecturers slept, sometimes for weeks, in the college part of the building and dined with Mahan and his family. Despite all efforts the building was not well suited for teaching. The lecture room was not high enough to display properly the necessary large maps. There were too few rooms for student offices and too little space to use as a lounge between lectures. Makeshift arrangements were necessary for meals when the college remained in session during an entire day. Fortunately, the library was sufficient, but only because the collection of books was small. Toilets and washing facilities were available only in a run-down out building.52 Despite the strength of his feelings on the issue, Mahan assuaged the critics by modifying the course in 1887 to emphasize current naval issues. Nonetheless, he kept the substance of the course as it had been maturing over the previous two years. In reporting on the activities for the now lengthened three-and-a-half-month course, Mahan stressed that new material had been introduced, \"all bearing upon the practical question of carrying on naval war to the best advantage.\" In particular, the students considered the naval problems arising in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico out of French interest in an isthmian canal. That autumn Lieutenant Charles C. Rogers of the USS Galena delivered four lectures on duties of a general staff. This was the first presentation on a subject that would grow in importance for the War College in later years. In the same course, William McCarty Little gave the first series of six lectures on war gaming, reflecting the work he was doing to develop a system of naval war games. To emphasize the practical aspect of studies, Mahan reported that Admiral Luce had brought the North Atlantic Squadron into Narragan- sett Bay, and its exercises were arranged specifically \"to illustrate and give point to teaching given orally in the lecture room, as well as diffuse information connected with the new materiel of the Navy.\"53 These THE ERA OF LUCE & MAHAN, 1 884- 1 893 27 maneuvers were a major innovation by Luce. They were part of his plan to have a squadron of evolution that would test and put into practice the theories of sea warfare worked out by the college. The maneuvers, comprising one of the first fleet exercises of the U.S. Navy, involved the passage of five ships, including two of the new steel ships and four torpedo boats, through a minefield, under the opposing guns of Fort Adams at the entrance to Narragansett Bay, and a landing, repulse, and reembarkation of nearly 400 men, with artillery, at Coddington Point.54 Mahan was greatly pleased with the general program of the college and the success of his own series of lectures with the students. The opponents of the War College, however, were not to be silenced. Mahan commented privately, \"their ignorance and my success alike testify to the want of the college.\"55 After the course was over, Mahan returned to Washington to lobby for the college in 1888. Initially, it appeared as though 10 of the 13 members of the House Naval Affairs Committee would vote for a separate budget to sustain the War College. The Secretary of the Navy told Mahan that he would not oppose the college, but neither would he allow Mahan to report he approved of it. Mahan's plea for the War College was on the grounds that it was the world's only institution devoted to military and naval theory that was not domin- ated by reference to technological development. It was a plea that only a few in Congress understood or supported, but the initial appropria- tion measure supporting the college managed to pass the House and was referred to the Senate. Secretary of the Navy Whitney appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee and suggested, unexpect- edly, that the House legislation be amended. He suggested that, for reasons of economy and administrative efficiency, the War College be consolidated with the Torpedo School on Goat Island. The combined forces could then use the facilities on Goat Island under the control of the Bureau of Ordnance. The building on Coaster's Harbor Island could then be returned to the apprentice training station administered by the Bureau of Equipment and Training. With this change, Secretary Whitney recommended that the Senate approve the $ 1 0,000 budget for the college. This was approved by Congress. To make matters worse, Secretary of the Navy Whitney ordered on 1 August that the four month course of instruction that had been scheduled to begin in less than a week was to be shortened by a month. \"In view of the fact,\" the Secretary announced, \"that during the last year's course less than an average of two lectures per day were delivered, including Saturday and Sunday, the Department feels that the interest attached to the course will not be impaired by condensing the course into a shorter period.\"56 Both Mahan and Luce were livid with anger. Not only did the Secretary of the Navy fail to understand the educational approach of 28 SAILORS AND SCHOLARS the War College but he threatened its very existence. The college curriculum required large blocks of time for the students to read and to think actively about the abstract problems presented. It was not a course in which data was poured into the ears of the students by a series of lectures. The lectures were only a stimulus to the main thrust of the college. Mahan pointed out that the two schools could be joined in several ways, \"but if by consolidation is meant the merging of two lines of thought radically distinct and in temper of mind opposed, under a single directing intellect, the result will be the destruction of one or the other.\"57 Luce joined the protest with a formal letter to the Secretary of the Navy, signed by his ally, Admiral of the Navy David Dixon Porter, and six other officers. They suggested that consideration would best be carried out through the appointment of a high ranking officer to command all the activities on Narragansett Bay, but allowing each a separate and healthful growth. \"The subjects treated by the War College, though of the highest importance, have been and are neglected by naval officers generally, in favor of material,\" they wrote, adding \"the merging of the college will stifle at birth a movement which gives the highest promise of future usefulness .... \"58 In the midst of these protests, the course of 1888 was in session.
