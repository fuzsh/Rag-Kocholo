        "text": "To mark 100 days until their Anzac Day Centenary clash in Wellington New Zealand, St Kilda and Carlton today announced plans to honour two past players killed on the first day of the Gallipoli battle.\n\nThe round four AFL clash on Saturday, April 25 will honour all soldiers involved in World War I but with a special emphasis on former VFL players Claude Crowl (St Kilda) and Fen McDonald (Carlton).\n\nBoth men are believed to have died on April 25, 1915 when the ANZACs first stormed the beach at Gallipoli. Their bodies were never found.\n\nIncredibly, the two men not only lost their lives on the same day in Gallipoli, they also made their VFL debut against each other at Princes Park on Saturday 29 July, 1911.\n\nSix VFL players are believed to have died on April 25th and a further 11 lost their lives in the Gallipoli campaign.\n\nLaunching St Kilda’s Anzac Day Centenary match at the Shrine this morning, Saints coach Alan Richardson joined Carlton coach Mick Malthouse in paying homage to those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\n\n“We are privileged to have the opportunity to honor all past and present service men and women by playing in the Anzac Day Centenary clash,” Richardson said.\n\n“What makes this especially powerful is that, sadly, St Kilda and Carlton have a direct link to Anzac Day through the deaths of past players Claude Crowl and Fen McDonald.\n\n“It’s quite incredible and humbling to think that 100 years ago to the day when we play our game in NZ, those two young men and many others were killed at Gallipoli. They were just 22 and 23 years of age which is the average age of an AFL player.”\n\nMalthouse said the Blues were proud to be part of the Anzac Day Centenary commemorations.\n\n“We see this game as an important opportunity to educate our players and fans about the stories of those who fought and especially those who lost their lives in WW1,” Malthouse said.\n\n“The Anzac Day Centenary is an important moment in Australia’s history and I know both clubs are deeply honored to be part of the commemorations.”\n\nPeople interested in learning more about WW1 and the Anzac Centenary can research their own connection at: www.anzaccentenary.vic.gov.au.\n\nFor further information on how to purchase flights and tickets to this game, click here.\n\nWW1 VFL HISTORY FACTS\n\n• Six VFL players believed to have died on April 25th, 1915 at Gallipoli.\n\n• 17 VFL players died in the Gallipoli campaign.\n\n• 12 St Kilda players died in WW1.\n\n• 11 Carlton players died in WW1.\n\n• 94 VFL players were killed in WW1\n\nBIO\n\nClaude Crowl (St Kilda)\n\nAge: 22yrs – born 26 December 1892\n\nEnlisted: In the First AIF - 25 August 1914\n\nServed: Egypt, Gallipoli\n\nMedals: 1914-15 Star, British War Medal, Victory Medal\n\nLived: Poowong Vic, born in Stratford\n\nOccupation: Farmer\n\nDebuted: Aged 18 against Carlton, at Princes Park on Saturday, 29 July 1911 (round fifteen).\n\nGames: 3 games\n\nFenley (“Fen”) McDonald (Carlton)\n\nAge: 23yrs - 25 May 1891\n\nEnlisted: in the First AIF - 17 August 1914\n\nServed: Private, in the 7th Battalion, A.I.F.\n\nLived: born in Nagambie\n\nOccupation: Stock and station agent with Pearson, Rowe, Smith, and Co.\n\nDebuted: Aged 20, against St Kilda, on 29 July 1911 (round fifteen).\n\n- Played forward and kicked a goal\n\nGames: Carlton 1911 – 1912 – 10 games, 4 goals\n\nMelbourne 1913 – 1 game"
