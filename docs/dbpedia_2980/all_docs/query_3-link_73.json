A neglected aspect of the history of Marine Corps operations against Imperial Japan has been any close study of how the marines themselves shaped the landscape of the battlefields on which they created new institutional legends. Marines projected ideas and assumptions about themselves and their enemy onto people, situations, and events throughout the war, and thereby gave life to formerly abstract ideas and molded their behavior to expectations. Focusing specifically on the First Marine Division, this study\n\ndraws on a broad range of approaches to its subject. The book begins with a look at the legacy of the Marine Corps on the eve of\n\nPearl Harbor, and then turns to gender studies to shed light on the methods of “making” marines. At the heart of the book are close examinations of how three broad categories of myth and imagination directly affected the First Division’s campaigns on Guadalcanal, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The study concludes by considering what happened to the myths and images of the Pacific War in the Korean War, and how they have been preserved in American society up to the present.\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\nAMERICAN SAMURAI\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\nAMERICAN SAMURAI MYTH, IMAGINATION, AND THE CONDUCT OF BATTLE IN THE FIRST MARINE DIVISION, 1941-1951\n\nCRAIG M.

In writing about their interrelationships and discussing them with other scholars and students, I have often been left with the impression that such a study tends , to slip between the cracks of various subspecialties within the historical discipline. I offer a brief note of clarification here in order to avoid misplaced expectations of what follows and to clarify the nature of the book. As a piece of military history, this book does not conform to conventional narrative forms centered on a particular unit, service, campaign, or even a single war. It is not a social history “from the ground up” or an operational history except in the indirect sense of relating myths and imaginary constructions of the battlefield to actual events and decisions. This book is not about the First Marine Division per se: it is about myth and imagination within the First Marine Division. The categories into which these myths and images can be placed are nearly universally shared and are what give the “American samurai” some occasionally close similarities to their Japanese counterparts. Parallels present themselves in many places, with the experiences of the French colonial\n\nlight infantry and repeatedly with the language and images mobilized by the Germans on the Eastern Front. What sets the marines apart from those cases are the differences in specific context and\n\nthe cultural responses to the perceived threats. Strong traditionalists among military historians may find the scope of this project too broad and amorphous. Those with a special fondness for an instrumental approach have been disconcerted that definitions are often imprecise and that so many arguments cannot be sustained\n\nby definitive, incontrovertible proof of the kind that underpins other types of military history. Such evidential difficulties are an inherent drawback in dealing with cultural and social myth and imagination, and in places argument by inference is necessarily the only recourse. In contrast to the miltary historians, social historians and cultural xl\n\nXi PREFACE anthropologists may find the scope of this work too narrow. Rather\n\nthan using the First Marine Division as a case study, some have advocated expanding it to cover the entire Marine Corps experience in the Pacific War, or even including the Army as well. Unfortunately, it is exactly this sort of broad homogenization that dilutes and devalues most cultural and social histories related to military topics. Specific contexts are crucial in establishing bridges between cultural imagination and actual battlefield behavior. Generalizations destroy such connections. All historians establish arti-\n\nficial barriers, and I am as vulnerable to charges of intellectual gerrymandering as.anyone, but to stray too far from the experiences of the First Marine Division would undermine the particularistic imaginary constructions that are my subject. With these points understood at the outset, perhaps some of the old debates can be shifted to new ground. It is a pleasant obligation to acknowledge here those individuals and organizations that have helped me in formulating and revising my ideas and conducting my research. Old Dominion University awarded me a Summer Research Fellowship Grant and a yearlong release to take a postdoctoral fellowship and complete my work. The Department of History provided both collegial support as well as support for some of the production costs. As a 1991-1992 John M. Olin Postdoctoral Fellow at Yale University, I was freed from all teaching responsibilities and able to devote a full year to finishing revisions of the manuscript. To that end, the scholarly atmosphere\n\nin the International Security Programs, the outstanding libraries, and generous research funds were important and greatly appreciated. The Marine Corps Historical Foundation provided substantial funding through their dissertation fellowship program and then extended to me a second research grant so I could follow through on my revisions. Many archivists, curators, and librarians have helped me along the way. The entire staff at the Marine Corps Historical Center, Washington Navy Yard, were very kind and professional in their assistance and made the center a most congenial and fruitful place to conduct research. In particular, before their departures, Joyce FE. Bonnett, as head of the archives section, and J. Michael Miller, curator of the personal papers collection, repeatedly demonstrated\n\ntheir intimate knowledge of their respective holdings and helped greatly with their suggestions for finding the materials I sought. Head Librarian Evelyn A. Englander and Jack Dyer, curator of the Marine Corps Art Collection, were also friendly and went out of their way to help. The staff in the archives section at the U.S. Army\n\nPREFACE Xl Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, enabled me to make the most of the short time I was able to spend there. John Barnett, curator of the Naval Art Collection, U.S. Naval Historical Center, Ron Lunn of the Marine Corps Association, and Verne E. Schwartz of the Army Art Activity, U.S. Army Center for Military History, all helped me to assemble useful graphic materials. Deborah L. Miller and Susan T. Cooke of the Graphic Arts Department at Old Dominion University demonstrated great patience and skill in reworking the maps into their present form. Among individuals inside the academy I owe special thanks to my dissertation director, Michael Geyer, whose conceptual insights and questions helped me give form to this book. Omer Bartov, Bruce Cumings, Akira Iriye, Michael Sherry, and John Shy all toiled through the complete manuscript in one or another of its various stages and contributed their own insights and often highly detailed suggestions. Carl Boyd, my colleague at Old Dominion,\n\noffered a broad range of material and moral support and never failed to provide sound advice.\n\nI am indebted to Frank Smith, Russell Hahn, and Pamela J. Bruton for their meticulous attention to the editing and production of the book. Personal notes of thanks are due to Maxine Pilkington and to Becky and Arthur Amiot. And finally, I am most grateful to my wife, Lynn, who accepted uncomplainingly burdens far more onerous than mine during my extended absences and long preoccupation with this project.\n\nBLANK PAGE\n\nAMERICAN SAMURAI\n\n~ BLANK PAGE\n\nINTRODUCTION IMAGERY AND INSTRUMENTALITY IN WAR\n\n“The sincere admiration of the entire Third Fleet is yours for the hill{-]blasting, cave[-]smashing extermination of 11,000 slant-eyed\n\ngophers. It has been a tough job extremely well done.” So read Admiral William F. Halsey’s congratulatory message to the troops who had seized the island of Peleliu in October 1944. Coming from one of the most outspokenly racist officers in the Navy, Halsey’s epithet might be dismissed as nothing more, perhaps, than an example of typical wartime hyperbole and personal bombast except for the apparent coincidence that the language and imagery used by Halsey find echoes throughout the ranks of the American military services among those who contributed directly to the barbar-\n\nization of the Pacific War. Ernie Pyle, unofficial voice of the common GIs in the European theater of operations, recorded his impressions after he traveled to the Pacific in early 1945 and spoke at length with soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen about the enemy: “In Europe we felt our enemies, horrible and deadly as they\n\nwere, were still people. But out here I gathered that the Japanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive; the way some people feel about cockroaches or mice.” Simply seeing a group of prisoners, Pyle wrote, “gave me the creeps, and I wanted to take a mental bath after looking at them.” Whether a fleet admiral in command of devastating fast carrier\n\n| raids on the Japanese home islands or a common rifleman personally confronting “slant-eyed gophers” on Peleliu and elsewhere, what these Americans thought about the enemy, themselves, and the world around them shaped the character of the Pacific War. Combat between the Americans and Japanese was conducted with tremendous intensity and frequently punctuated by acts of savage barbarism, whether measured on the grand scale, like the Bataan 1 Halsey message is quoted in letter dated 14 May 1947 from Paul J. Mueller to Admiral William F. Halsey; Paul J. Mueller Papers, U.S. Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks. Ernie Pyle, Last Chapter (New York: Henry Holt, 1945), 5. Having survived some of the worst fighting in Europe, Pyle’s death on Ie Shima seemed to confirm the images he used here to describe the Japanese. ]\n\n2 AMERICAN SAMURAI death march and the bombing of Hiroshima, or on the level of the individual who collected bones or ears as trophies from the enemy dead.* What is left inadequately explored — indeed, often unquestioned — is how the barbarization of the war related to the often abstract images men carried onto its battlefields. Myth and imagination preceded and gave form to action by shaping expectations, and when combatants projected their assumptions onto people, events, and situations, they molded the landscape of their battlefields. The reification of abstract images gave them a historical identity and deadly role of their own. Any attempt to address the subject of the barbarization of the war requires closer consideration than hitherto given to the precise relationship among the acts themselves, the operative instrumentalities of war — those elements governed by putatively rational rules included under the general rubric\n\nof “doctrine” — and the underlying images and myths that determined the development and employment of the instrumentalities themselves.” More than a century before the “Fat Boy” culminated the slaugh-\n\nter of the Pacific War in a blinding flash of light, the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz wrestled with ideas about the\n\nnature of war and violence that defied exact or reassuring combination. How, he asked himself, do you define war, “a true chameleon” that changes color to match its changing background. In partial answer, he listed the composite characteristics that make war distinct from any other human endeavor:\n\nAs a total phenomenon, its dominant tendencies always make | war a paradoxical trinity — composed of primordial violence, hatred, and enmity, which are to be regarded as a blind natural force; of the play of chance and probability within which the\n\ncreative spirit is free to roam; and of its elements of subordination, as an instrument of policy, which makes it subject to reason alone.’ 2 James J. Weingartner, “Trophies of War: U.S. Troops and the Muulation of Japanese War Dead, 1941-1945,” Pacific Historical Review 61 (February 1992): 3 John Dower’s study War without Mercy (New York: Pantheon, 1986) examines graphic and verbal images in both Japan and the United States to demonstrate “how stereotyped and often blatantly racist thinking contributed to poor military intelligence and planning, atrocious behavior, and the adoption of exterminationist policies” (x). The scope of Dower’s study, however, does not include linking clearly the images he discusses, which were intended primarily for the consumption of civilians and raw recruits, to military doctrine and day-to-day behavior on the battlefield. 4 Carl von Clausewitz, On War, edited and translated by Michael Howard and Peter Paret (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 89.\n\nINTRODUCTION 3 Nobody who had fought across the hellish landscape of Iwo Jima,\n\nwatched kamikaze aircraft run the gauntlet of fire to hurtle into American warships, or witnessed from the ground the immolation of tens of thousands of civilians in mass incendiary raids would question the elemental power of Clausewitz’s first characteristic. Clausewitz himself, however, by dismissing wartime hatred as a\n\n“natural force,” effectively placed it beyond human control. He thereby dismembered his trinity and created a bipolar framework — the more familiar war as an art and a science — upon which he then erected his theory. Yet the ‘Pacific War witnessed the mobilization of ideas and images for the express purpose of stirring up the elemental force of wartime hatred and harnessing it to military policy. Whether in the context of the Pacific War or some other specific case, one challenge for military thinkers and _ historians today is to examine more closely the point at which all three elements of Clausewitz’s trinity meet. Historical tradition, like Clausewitz’s theory, has kept the indi-\n\nvidual elements artificially separate and compartmentalized. It would be unfair to hold Clausewitz responsible for this shortcoming, because he was understandably constrained by his interest in explicating a theory of broad applicability. Nevertheless, he represents better than anyone else the process by which this occurred. Giving careful consideration to the distinctions between art and science as applied to war, Clausewitz vaguely defined the object of art as “creative ability” and that of science as “pure knowledge.”\n\nIn the best Hegelian dialectic, he then concluded that war was neither art nor science but a synthesis of the two and distinct from\n\nboth. From the nagging question of how the elements actually combined, he sought refuge in two ways: first, he united the art and science of war in special individuals possessed of military genius; and second, he swept the messier aspects under the accom-\n\nmodating rug he labeled “moral factors.” Clausewitz plainly recognized that the towering majority of soldiers are not possessed\n\nof Napoleonic genius and that “moral factors” defied neat categorization or thorough treatment, but he had to settle for frequent, often pithy, admonitions not to ignore such intangibles while concentrating on the scientific principles.” For Americans in general, 5 The elements recur throughout Clausewitz’s work, but he most clearly states his\n\narguments in Book 1, Chapter 1, “What Is War?”; Chapter 3, “On Military Genius”; Book 2, Chapter 3, “Art.of War or Science of War”; and Book 3, Chapters 3-5, on moral factors. He warns against overemphasizing military genius, “which is above all rules; which amounts to admitting that rules are not only\n\nmade for idiots, but are idiotic in themselves” (184). He likewise writes that probing the moral factors “like a diligent professor” “all too easily leads to plat-\n\n4 AMERICAN SAMURAI as for Clausewitz in particular, reliance on a dualistic universe of art and science, mental and material, good and evil, has given rise to some very problematic historical thinking that has frequently spilled over into events. According to one Clausewitzian dictum, whether on a grand strategic scale or at the level of battle, the selection of political goals or military objectives dictates the level of force used to attain them. To explain events on the Pacific battlefields, however, requires looking beyond the objectives enunciated in abstract, ra-\n\ntional plans to grasp as well the unofficial goals or objectives pursued by the men charged with performing the missions. The latter virtually always had an agenda that diverged radically from the Clausewitzian ideal, with profound ramifications on the conduct of battle. Or as Clausewitz wrote in a typical corrective against leaping to easy generalizations, “we must face the fact that war\n\nand its forms result from ideas, emotions, and conditions prevailing at the time.” In the course of the Pacific War, Americans, like the Japanese, violated many traditionally accepted limits on the exercise of force such as sparing enemy wounded or prisoners and distinguishing between uniformed combatants and civilian noncombatants.’ Re-\n\nfusals to take prisoners might be dismissed as isolated acts of barbarity arising from the “passions of battle,” but the decisions to employ unrestricted submarine warfare and indiscriminate stra-\n\ntegic bombing by means of mass incendiary raids were systematized, approved policies that carried beyond former limits\n\nplaced on the use of violence. Did these policies represent a temporary expansion of such boundaries or their breakdown altogether? How this question has been answered illustrates an important problem that has plagued military historiography. The complex relationship among historical acts, instrumentality, and underlying purposiveness has become fragmented in contemporary histories. Consider those histories that focus on aspects of war supposedly governed by “rational” rules and conforming to Clausewitz’s disitudes,” and “unwittingly we find ourselves proclaiming what everybody knows”\n\n6 Ibid. 580. A slightly different translation of this passage (Anatol Rapoport, ed., Penguin, 1968) reads: “we shall have to grasp that the idea of War, and the form which we give it, proceeds from ideas, feelings, and circumstances which dominate\n\nfor the moment” (369-70). 7 Primarily in the Anglo—German context, Geoffrey Best discusses traditions and precedents concerning the subjects of “soldiers and civilians,” “sea war and the civilian,” and “aerial bombardment” in Humanity in Warfare (New York: Columbia University Press, 1980), 217-24, 240-41, 261-85.\n\nINTRODUCTION 5 tinction of the “scientific” side of military thought, to which I will\n\nhereafter refer as instrumental histories. Uniformed writers and official historians are quintessential “instrumentalists.” They invariably direct their attention to such issues as the organization, equipment, and the doctrinal foundations of armies for the purpose of instituting reforms based on their historical studies or publicizing the accomplishments of the services. Since source ma-\n\nterials on these topics are usually ample given the profusion of documents militaries manufacture, especially in this century, staff\n\nhistories may appear, if not convincingly “objective,”’ at least “scientific.”” The conventional instrumentalist argument maintains\n\nthat unrestricted submarine warfare and strategic bombing were rational policies arising simply from the concatenation of technological innovation and grand strategic aims. Likewise, the hill-\n\nblasting and cave-smashing side of the Peleliu battle is easily explained in most American histories of the subject by focusing on the weapons, tactics, organization, and logistics — the instrumentalities that enabled the soldiers and marines literally to burn and blast the island landscape, along with those who happened to occupy it.” But how were these instrumental or technocratic choices made? Assumptions made, for instance, about how long the Japanese would resist profoundly affected the Peleliu campaign; as did the interservice rivalry between the Marine Corps\n\nand Army, fueled by pride and resentment — themselves the products of myths and images. If instrumental history, representing the “science” of war, often falls short in explaining the forms of combat and battlefield behavior, simple battle narrative, more appropriately exploring the realm of war as art, seldom does much better. Relating the contributions of chance, spirit, military genius, and moral virtue, tra8 The problems of objectivity and thoroughness among staff historians associated with specific institutional factions go beyond the scope of my discussion here but are introduced well in Michael Howard, “The Use and Abuse of Military History,” Royal United Service Institute Journal 107 (February 1962): 4—8.\n\n9 Just as theorists like Clausewitz and Jomini were the products of the Age of Reason, so too did the mantle of scientific rationality surrounding the Rankian school transform military history in the late nineteenth century from a hobby of dilettantes into an instrument of policy that remains with us, in different form, to this day. See Gordon A. Craig, “Delbriick: The Military Historian,” in Peter Paret, ed., Makers of Modern Strategy (Princeton: Princeton University Press,\n\n1986), 326-53. 10 Representative of these conventional histories are Samuel Eliot Morison, Two Ocean War (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1963), 493-512; United States Air Force, Historical Division, The Army Air Forces in World War II, edited by Wesley Frank Craven and James Lea Cate, vol. 5, The Pacific: Matterhorn to Nagasaki (Chicago:\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1953), 608-27; and Frank O. Hough, The Island War (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1947), 291-313.\n\n6 AMERICAN SAMURAI ditional narrative sounds the vicarious call to arms with riveting and colorful accounts, just as staff histories, neatly dissecting plans\n\nand movements, emerge from the smoke and bedlam of the battlefield to bring order. Both historical methods clearly lay the groundwork for further scholarly development, but too often the best books inspire derivative reprises of the same stories without any new insights. John Keegan details well the deficiencies that have plagued what he labels “battle pieces.” Military historians have long employed euphemism, unstudied misrepresentation, and calculated omission to hide or skirt around disagreeable, unattractive,\n\n| or complex aspects of combat.'' Identifying the shortcomings of traditional approaches, however, has proved easier than redressing them.\n\nAs Keegan observes, the real dilemma plaguing military historiography does not lie exclusively with an incomplete and antiseptic view of the battlefield itself; it arises also from historians’ neglect of internalized ideas and values and the myths and images to which they give rise.'* Myths as well as machine guns can be highly effective weapons on the battlefield, but the former, being\n\nintangibles, are difficult to work with and by definition highly subjective. For these reasons ideas and images are grossly oversimplified or shunned altogether by uniformed and official historians.'” A balanced interpretation and analysis of any military subject require understanding that seemingly scientific or rational decisions are the product of, and in turn affect, myth and imagination. The trinity Clausewitz identifies is interactive and integrative. 11 John Keegan, The Face of Battle (New York: Viking Press, 1976). The historiographical first chapter remains among the best essays on the subject of writing operational military history. 12 Keegan does an excellent job of weaving a vast amount of detail into an interesting and enjoyable narrative, setting a new standard of technical accuracy and\n\ndirectness in the writing of operational history. But although he carries the “battle piece” to new heights of descriptive detail, he concentrates on the empirical aspects of his subject without developing the more problematic conceptual aspect he identifies. For examples see his brief references to British and Commonwealth troops’ refusals to take prisoners or his abbreviated treatment of the social origins, recruitment, and training of the Pals battalions (ibid., 48-51, 215—25).\n\n13 Machine guns are the subject of a fascinating history that blends the mythic and instrumental aspects of war to explain why there was so much opposition to | their development. Although it was a fabulously useful technological innovation, the machine gun aroused great and lasting opposition for “dehumanizing” combat and robbing it of its moral character. But chivalric or heroic images did not disappear with widespread use of the machine gun in the Great War; instead,\n\npraise was frequently heaped upon the enemy’s machine gunners for their courage and coolness, as if to attribute the terrific carnage to human, morally responsible agents rather than the machines they served. John Ellis, The Social History of the Machine Gun (New York: Arno Press, 1981).\n\nINTRODUCTION 7 The organization of mass violence in war revolves simultaneously around both personal and collective experience. Campaign histories can be misleading when they reduce individuals\n\nwho plan and conduct battle to their institutional and group identities to the exclusion of their personal attitudes. At the same\n\ntime, even soldiers who view their enemies as subhumans act within the framework of an organized military service. The reification of myth and imagination, however unrealistic they may be, often explains events, as Clausewitz suggested, that are incomprehensible according to any military logic. In contrast to the logic imparted to events in instrumental histories, impressionistic, anecdotal recollections, as compiled in Studs Terkel’s Pulitzer Prize—winning oral history, “The Good War,” offer vivid vignettes,\n\nbut they seldom establish a context in which to interpret events.'*\n\nSynthesizing the two extremes reveals the extent to which the rationalized and systematized management of war arose in reaction to a mythic understanding of events. The best history to date to provide such a detailed synthesis linking American mythology and imagination with the development of strategic thought and operational decision making is Michael Sherry’s The Rise of American Air Power. Sherry argues convincingly that the origins of air power are to be found in the American collective imagination: “The bomber was the product of extravagant dreams and dark forebodings about the role it might play in war and peace.” Significantly, what Sherry labels the “creation of Armageddon” reached its destructive apotheosis against Japan: not in the atomic bombings of August 1945 but in the mass incendiary raids that began in March. Military leaders, politicians, and the American public all contributed to the devastation visited on Japanese society. The use of the atomic bombs, like the history of strategic bombing, “resulted from choices but not from a moment of choice. Both were the products of a slow accretion of large fears, thoughtless assumptions, and incremental decisions.” The same arguments apply to the marines’ role in the ground war. To paraphrase Sherry, histories of the marines have been written from other perspectives — tactics, technologies, organizations, and campaigns — and these elements must be accounted for, but practical developments were usually secondary to imagination in shaping ground combat.’”\n\nThe trick for historians is to identify the vast array of ideas and images that may have influenced operations in such unpre14 Studs Terkel, “The Good War” (New York: Pantheon, 1984). 15 Michael S. Sherry, The Rise of American Atr Power (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987), x—xi, 363.\n\n8 AMERICAN SAMURAI dictable ways. Given the scope and elusive nature of the problem, there can be no definitive, comprehensive solutions; instead, clues\n\nto what ideas lay behind various policies and actions are often hidden after the manner of Poe’s purloined letter. Language, such as that contained in Halsey’s message, was a powerful tool for generating and reshaping images. Moreover, such images could directly alter perceptions and behavior, a fact certainly not lost on the Japanese, who very carefully intertwined linguistics with traditional myth to produce imagery supporting the prosecution of the war.'° The links between images, ideology, and history are inseparable, or as one scholar of the subject, W. J. T. Mitchell, writes,\n\nImages are not just a particular kind of sign, but something like an actor on the historical stage, a presence or character endowed with legendary status, a history that parallels and participates in the stories we tell ourselves about our own evo-\n\nlution from creatures “made in the image” of a creator, to\n\ncreatures who make themselves and their world in their own image.'’\n\nAlthough images should not be elevated to the status of autonomous “actors” removed from human control, they might accurately be described as props or costumes for the historical players. Imaginary constructs were key throughout the Pacific War: in precipitating it, in shaping the way it was fought on the battlefield, and in restoring a new equilibrium once peace returned. Imaginary constructions — groups of images, often of more than\n\none type — varied in form and content and derived from several sources. Mitchell separates images into rough categories, including\n\ngraphic representations (pictures, photographs), perceptual (appearances, sense data), mental (dreams, memories, ideas), and ver-\n\nbal (metaphors, descriptions). Paralleling the duality between “objective” and “subjective” in military histories, the first two are, arguably, the more “objective” or at least publicly shared images, and, in contrast, the last two are obviously solely creations of the individual mind.'® All images, however, are perceived and interpreted differently, depending on the background and experiences of the observer and on the specific circumstances under which the\n\nimages are encountered. The contextual element is particularly 16 For a specific example see Dower’s discussion of the so-called Kyoto School of ideologues (War without Mercy, 226—28). A more general polemic on the subject is Sabur6 Ienaga, The Pacific War, 1931-1945 (New York: Pantheon, 1978).\n\n7 Mee y Mitchell, Iconology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986), 9.\n\nINTRODUCTION 9 important for historians who explore the influence of images on behavior.\n\nAn excellent contribution to the subject of soldiers’ imaginary construction and ordering of their world is Eric J. Leed’s book No Man’s Land: Combat and Identity in the First World War. Far from obscuring the true nature of war, Leed maintains, myth and imagination often serve to amplify it: [I]t is arguable that, in general, the myths and fantasies of war cannot be regarded as false imprints of phenomenal realities. They were the necessary articulation of the combatant’s experience of realities. ... The technological actualities [of the front] ...eviscerated previous conceptions of war and the warrior. The myths and fantasies of war attempt to revive these conceptions in a new landscape. They attempt to close the gap between the surprising realities of life and initial expectations.'°\n\nMyth shaped expectations going into battle the first tume, the actual experiences of battle, and the ways those experiences were\n\nremembered and given meaning afterward. Paradoxically, for example, some Germans found liberation in images of the “machine,” whereas British memoirists tended to see the machine as their downfall.*° Given the imperfections of human perception, the limits of the combatants’ horizons, and the inadequacies of words to give expression and meaning to actual experiences, myth is, Leed argues, an essential outgrowth of war. Although it is not Leed’s purpose to go into operational details or explore in great depth how myth and imagination were manipulated to mold battle itself, he establishes a synthesis of myth and instrumentality that could significantly expand upon the traditional accounts. Within the context of the entire Pacific War it would be difficult\n\nto examine the influence of imaginary constructs — that is, groupings of images that define a “reality” — divorced from the objects or attitudes that gave rise to them. Aside from the sheer scope of such a project, the precise nature of this influence and its evolution over time and with experience differ drastically depending on where the\n\nfocus lies. Policy and doctrine governing air or naval warfare, for 19 Eric J. Leed, No Man’s Land (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1979),\n\n20 Comparing European memoirs of the First World War to American memoirs of the Second, British works, like Edmund Blunden’s Undertones of War and Robert Graves’s Goodbye to All That, are closer in tone to those of American citizen-soldiers, like J. Glenn Gray’s The Warriors (New York: Harper and Row, 1970), whereas the tone of German books, like Ernst Jiinger’s Im Stahlgeunttern and Feuer und Blut reflects more closely the warrior mentality and celebration of martial ability often present in the Marine memoirs to come out of the Pacific.\n\n10 AMERICAN SAMURAI instance, were largely the products of abstract conceptualization. The sites of decision making were much farther removed both spatially and emotionally from the scene of battle than was possible in the ground war. In addition, the informal, grass roots interaction and adaptation that characterized land battle resulted in myths different from those of the naval and air wars because there was no dominant technology or machine that mediated between men and events. The attitudes, images, and myths of the infantrymen who fought the Japanese at close quarters carried greater resonance on the battlefield and, however indirectly, within the planning agencies\n\nof ground commands than did those of the submarine captains or bomber pilots inside COMSUBPAC Or SAC.\n\nAn iconographic study of America in the Pacific War reveals many of the inconsistencies, ironies, and paradoxes in our conception of those events that left a swath of destruction extending from Pearl Harbor to Nagasaki. Ideas expressed through visual images were powerful and lasting, and none remains more famous in the American iconography of the war than Joseph Rosenthal’s Pulitzer Prize—winning photograph of the flag being raised on Mount Suribachi. But contrast the image conveyed by the Marine Corps War\n\nMemorial with those contained in the scrapbook of a common marine. As a young Marine corporal in the 3d Armored Amphibian Battalion (which was attached to the First Marine Division on Peleliu\n\nand Okinawa), Werner Claussen assembled a photo album that captured not only scenes he wanted to remember but ideas and feelings of the time. Rosenthal’s picture reflected a heroic and stirring reality of the Pacific War on one level, but just as surely,\n\nClaussen’s pictures of young American men grinning selfconsciously at the camera, bare-breasted Polynesian women provocatively posed, and badly disfigured Japanese corpses all cap-\n\ntured realities of the war on other levels.*' With the years of reassessment that followed the events and feelings captured in these pictures, the inter-relationships between these realities have been simplified and compartmentalized to the point that Rosenthal’s and Claussen’s photographs appear virtually unrelated. This process is in itself important for deciphering the meaning of events and as a mechanism for individual and collective healing. 21 Werner Claussen Papers, Personal Papers Collection (PPC), Marine Corps Historical Center (MCHC). Claussen’s pictures show slightly more variety than those in most of the other scrapbooks, but in terms of the general iconographic categories represented, his collection is quite typical. For insights into the shifting meanings ascribed to the Rosenthal picture see Karal Ann Marling and John Wetenhall, Iwo Jima: Monuments, Memories, and the American Hero (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991).\n\nCe DI .RRS ke SES OEEEISEeIIR,: EOE BIaSe eae Oeeeas Ce te: .ats . > nee. . en wos, wy Ot TER IS AE oda PIERPe IT EE POOR EEE EECE EEEA Eees eaeTy ee el yeeln veStet wey eS ey\n\nee Ee\n\nWN as Fenn eee nen eS AS LE SEIEE LIAL ESS HORII MD LEIS DEEN go Bi ON EE Oe OE EOE EEL OEE Ete eet CoN EN BEE ANCE EY BEET LCE EOE a Te ES en Ss ill Ke BO MEM REE ac eas eee ene ce rE De NOE OE ee Ee CE LEE EE EEE BEE EISELE EEE LS EDD EI IL DIET EEE Ce\n\noe ERT SSE AS ee. i ne SLE a a RS ORR TR ee ee\n\nAe ee re RL Ra NE A CLONAL: «| Sand t 7 Ene LL LE ILE PRI OEE EE Ee ESO ESS OIE ASS EE IEE EA EEE EE ONG eR EE EE EE EPEC LE OE ECE EEE.

High recruitment standards during the 1930s had “created something of an institutional memory of a ‘golden age’” that many prewar marines had in mind when they argued that standards would slip quickly unless harsher training and discipline were imposed on the newcomers. Typical of such men was one lieutenant colonel who warned of the chronic decline of military discipline and absolute obedience in an article entitled “The Secret Weapon That We Do Not Possess.”** He argued for better leadership, more carefully directed training, and draconian enforcement to solve the problem. The distinction between discipline and hazing, especially inside the training commands, became blurred. Hazing came as a response to a personnel crisis that the training command was not equipped to handle. Recruits before the war had been regarded as men, not boys, and although discipline was strict,\n\nit seldom took the form of regular corporal punishment. With wartime mobilization, however, many young and inexperienced DIs found it difficult to assert their authority over men their own\n\nage without disparaging them as children or boys and without relying “upon their fists and heavy doses of profanity to gain ascendancy over recruits who could not hit back.” The inexperience or acquiescence of supervisory officers and NCOs allowed abuses to spread, and so some untrained DIs spent more time hazing their\n\nrecruits than in productive training.”’ Significantly, as Eugene Sledge recalls, hazing tended to diminish significantly during marksmanship training: “the harassment that had been our daily diet gave way to deadly serious, businesslike instruction in marksmanship.” Range personnel were usually of the highest quality and took great professional pride in teaching a skill that even the green-\n\nest, most insecure DIs respected.”” The wartime generation of marines accepted whatever treatment they received at boot camp with little demur for many reasons: because the hierarchical and coercive system allowed few alternatives but acceptance; out of patriotism and the desire to serve; and as a natural outgrowth of the corps’s reputation for toughness.”’ Sixty-eight percent of all 24 Lt.

Letcher, “The Secret Weapon That We Do Not Possess,” Marine Corps Gazette 28 (January 1944): 47-50. 25 Keith Fleming, The U.S. Marine Corps in Crisis (Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 1990), 12—16. 26 Sledge, With the Old Breed, 12—14. 27 Marine Corps Reserve, 96-97. Fleming suggests that hard times suffered in the Depression also made toleration of abuses easier (Marine Corps in Crisis, 16).\n\nSome recruits accepted physical abuse as natural or even welcomed it as an element of discipline; William Manchester, Goodbye, Darkness (Boston: Little, Brown, 1979), 120-22.\n\n60 AMERICAN SAMURAI Marine Corps personnel during the war were reservists On active duty only “for the duration,” and the sense of urgency that brought the reservists onto active duty also helped to push into the background the difficulties endemic in the problem.” In an effort to get the most men into combat units as quickly as possible, Headquarters Marine Corps reduced the period of training from seven to six weeks immediately after Pearl Harbor, and down to only five weeks in January 1942 before restoring it to seven\n\nweeks in March. Changes were necessary in the types of subjects taught and the number of hours devoted to them. The five-week schedule devoted 96 hours of instruction to weapons training, 56\n\nto garrison duties, 32 to field subjects, and a mere 4 hours to physical training. The first seven-week schedule called for 138 hours on weapons training, 62 on garrison duties, 57 on field subjects, and 14 on physical training. Curiously, the two recruit depots functioned independently, and because the details were left up to the two commands, the precise course of training was never the same in both places until a master training schedule was finally issued in February 1944.” There was, from 1943 onward, a drive toward more technically oriented training in response to actual battlefield experience. The change was most readily apparent in the numbers of hours spent on related areas of training. Immediately before the master sched-\n\nule was issued, the San Diego and Parris Island recruit depots devoted twenty-four and forty-five hours, respectively, to physical\n\ntraining, a dramatic increase over the hurried training of early 1942. Moreover, this conditioning moved away from simple calisthenics to more useful exercises, including swimming and physical contact sports like boxing, wrestling, and judo. Similarly, much more time was spent on weapons training and “field subjects” relative to “garrison-type” subjects.*” Despite these efforts, however, complaints grew louder from organizations receiving incompletely trained men. Recruit training was supposed to produce basically trained riflemen; from the depot individuals would be sent on to 28 Marine Corps Reserve, 59.\n\n29 “Ground Training,” 159, 161-62, 170-72. It would be difficult to measure accurately any possible effect this may have had on the men in combat, nor has\n\nme reason for the absence of central control up to this time been clearly ex30 Ibid., 161, 164-65, 167. The eight-week master schedule called for 195 hours on weapons training, 98 on field subjects, 89 on garrison duties, and 39 on physical training. Except for the amount of time devoted to field subjects, the percentage of training time devoted to each area in the master schedule, 46%, 79} (172).22%, and 9%, respectively, was relatively consistent throughout the war\n\nCREATING MARINES 61 another school to receive extra training in their assigned specialty. The problem was that the Replacement Training Centers had to spend 25—50 percent of their time teaching fundamentals that should have been thoroughly learned at boot camp. Given all the different organizations crying for manpower from a limited pool, the only surprise about selective service catching up\n\nwith the Marine Corps was that it took fourteen months after the war started. Despite the early boom of enlistments following Pearl Harbor, by the end of 1942 Marine recruiters had trouble filling quotas as rapidly as Congress increased authorized manning levels, even after entrance requirements were lowered. In order to ensure that all the services met their personnel needs in the most equitable manner, the Marine Corps was placed under selective service guide-\n\nlines before the war was a year old. The first Marine draftees received their induction notices in November 1942 and reported to boot camp in February 1943. To protect their elitist image, the Marines found it essential to maintain some semblance of voluntarism. One largely cosmetic device, pushed by Marine recruiters, was to discharge willing inductees and allow them to enlist in the regulars or Reserves, thus dropping the damning “SS” (selective service) designation after their names.”' To obtain true volunteers, however, the Marines had to look outside the eighteen to thirtysix age group covered by selective service. The most profitable program drew almost 60,000 seventeen-year-olds into the Marine Corps Reserve between 1943 and 1945, calling them to active duty as they turned eighteen.” Despite their efforts at concealment, the\n\nMarine Corps depended heavily on the draft. Almost 80 percent of those who came into the Marine Corps in 1943 did so through the selective service, whether “volunteering” for the Marines at the induction centers or not (see Table 2), and without the men brought in by selective service, the Marines could not have recruited enough\n\nvolunteers to make up the difference.” It is difficult to gauge precisely what impact the appearance of\n\ndraftees had in the ranks of combat units. One reason for the\n\nincreased hazing in recruit training was the desire to compensate for the presence of presumably unmotivated draftees, and they were often singled out for attention. In the First Marine Division, 31 United States Navy Department, Administration of the Navy Department in World War II, by Julius Furer (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1959), 567 (hereafter cited as Navy, Administration). On the need to “sell” these voluntary inductions, see Farmer Seale, “Salesmanship Still Important,” Marine Recruiter\n\n3 (February 1943): 4-5. 32 Navy, Administration, 567-68. 33 United States Marine Corps, “Marine Corps Administrative History” (Washington: Marine Corps Historical Division, 1946, Typed manuscript), 15—17.\n\n62 AMERICAN SAMURAI draftees began to filter in as replacements before the Peleliu campaign. Among four rifle companies for which records exist, over one-quarter of the men were draftees.** It came as a mild shock among the older volunteers when these men first appeared in their midst, but as long as the draftees did not complain about being victims of a coercive system there was little friction.® Ironically, the Marine Corps found the draft useful, not only to provide recruits but also as a means, through their institutional histories, to emphasize the importance of the part played by volunteers. Selective service was depicted as a system forced upon the Marines, not — according to most histories — because of any inherent institutional\n\nproblems, but to democratize and rationalize the process on a national level. Even among draftees, they maintain, the spirit of voluntarism remained strong.”\n\nA conventional overview of personnel policies illustrates only a single dimension of a complex and important process that also built on unspoken assumptions and attitudes. Although not entirely hap-\n\nhazard, Marine Corps training procedures lacked the institutionalized structure that characterized most military training programs. This was not simply the result of disorganization arising from hectic wartime mobilization but rather was a product of years-long practices that did not begin to break down until 1944. The long absence\n\nof servicewide training schedules, close, uniform supervision of instruction, and explicit codification of general training principles made the Marines unique. As with virtually every military institution, there was a tension underlying the training program that, on the one hand, stressed the thorough teaching of rudimentary military skills and, on the other, emphasized those intangible qualities that constituted the core of its institutional identity. The latter was used to justify increased harshness in basic training. Neither of these two competing philosophies dominated to the complete exclusion of the other, and, indeed, every good marine had to have a mix of both. But the real history of this subject must go beyond issues like the number of hours spent in a particular type of instruction or the number of draftees inducted versus volunteers. ‘To 34 Embarkation Rosters, RG 127/65A-5188/Box 40/file B17-1. Of 890 men listed in A Company, 1/7, and I, K, and L Companies, 3/7, 239 were selective service. 35 Leckie, Helmet for My Pillow, 281; Sledge, With the Old Breed, 171-72. Selectees found “voluntary” inductions attractive as a way to avoid the stigma attached to draftees. 36 One official history published during the early buildup in Vietnam makes this argument explicitly and minimizes the influence of draftees by providing the (uncited) figure of only 75,000 inductees total over the course of the entire war; Marine Corps Reserve, 63.\n\nCREATING MARINES 63 be of any use on the Pacific battlefields, every man had to internalize an identity distinct from what he knew as a civilian. Understanding\n\nhow the Marines created their own traditions, defined a “Marine” identity, and conveyed them to new recruits is necessary for any interpretation of subsequent events.”’ Claiming for themselves an institutional “imprint” unique and distinct from any other service, the Marines, like every military organization, imposed it on their initiates as a rite of separation from civilian social experience.’ For DIs, the creation and incul-\n\ncation of this identity seemed to depend on an intuitive understanding and acceptance of a remote and abstract ideal of what the term “marine” should embody. Without this ideal the depots would not have been able to utilize privates first class for DI duty no matter how outwardly zealous or capable. Attempting to articulate this nebulous ideal, the product of film and fiction, “old corps” myth and wartime legend, seemed for some marines to strip it of symbolic\n\nvalue. Lindsay felt as both a marine and a historian that it was inexpressible. Another marine, a “mustang” (an officer commissioned from the ranks), expressed his understanding of that ideal: To the Marine, the Corps is his religion, his reason for being. He cannot be committed up to a point. For him, involvement\n\nis total. He savors the traditions of his Corps and doubts not the veracity of them. He believes implicitly that he must live up to those epics of physical and moral courage established by\n\nthose who preceded him. He believes that the Corps is truly unique — that it is the most elite military organization ever devised and that he, as an integral part of that organization, must never bring disgrace or dishonor upon it.” Allowing for no deviation, this is not an elucidation of values but a definition of a monolithic military identity. Since the identity was the product of “traditions,” however, it could be molded to serve shifting goals. Like most military institutions, the Marine Corps carefully choreographed key ceremonies to introduce members 37 The success of the Marine Corps at creating an institutional tradition is in one sense measured by how many Marine authors cited below and elsewhere can offer no definition of a Marine identity but simply assert it as a natural and\n\nunconscious fact of their existence. This point is brought up by Eric Hobsbawm, , “Introduction: Inventing Traditions,” in Eric Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger, eds., The Invention of Tradition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 38 Comimenting upon the idea of using rites of “initiation” Leed writes, “What is most often revealed in traditional rites is the sacred underpinnings of the group; what was revealed in war was not ‘sacred,’ even though it seemed to acquire a demonic force” (No Man’s Land, 29). 39 Gerald P. Averill, Mustang (Novato: Presidio Press, 1987), 3.\n\n64 AMERICAN SAMURAI into the secrets and the central tenets of the organization.*” The pervasiveness and the degree to which corps values were internalized were central in defining how the marines fought in the Pacific and will be considered further in connection with the Peleliu campaign. The means by which the identity was spread and so deeply instilled was through the manipulation and fabrication of gender roles.\n\nBy both design and circumstance the Marine Corps was an allmale world, effectively unpopulated by women, in which the influence of gender roles was constantly at play, even among combat troops. The sense of male identity was integral to unit cohesion and effectiveness and necessarily coexisted with a sense of what constituted female attributes and boundaries.*’ For many men, women occupied traditional roles and were symbols of home, fidelity, and peace, objects of longing, and hopelessly romanticized and idealized by lonely, homesick boys. This was the view taken in American propaganda, and at least some marines went to their graves sincerely believing in the romantic ideal. Shortly before he died of wounds received on Guadalcanal Harry G. Findlay wrote to his son, “[T]he true love of a woman is the most beautiful thing in the world. Value it beyond all else. Do nothing that will tarnish your memory in relationship to womanhood.” For others, women were simply sexual objects: much of one marine’s memoir, written\n\nover forty years after the events it chronicles, is devoted to recounting his sexual conquests and their often bizarre circumstances.** At an unspoken extreme, women could become objects of hatred, symbols of everything obscene that engulfed men in combat and the embodiment of all the indignities and injustices they had to suffer.** The precise forms of this objectification varied a great 40 The parallels with Theweleit’s account mentioned at the beginning of the chapter apply here as well: compare Male Fantasies, 2:143—53 with Lindsay, This High Name, 89-90. The British army and their regimental system, the SS and Blackshirts with their quasi-religious military rituals in Germany and Italy, the com-\n\nmissar system in the Red Army, and the Imperial Japanese Army’s stress on the bushido and the emperor all offer, to varying degrees, similarities in the close control and manipulation of mythic images in the process of training and\n\n| indoctrination.\n\n41 Although the Marine Corps accepted women, it was the most reluctant of the services to do so, and there remained throughout the enlisted ranks of the corps, as with all the services, tremendous antipathy toward women in uniform; D’Ann Campbell, Women at War with America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984), 39-42. 42 Diary entry dated 6 August 1942, Harry G. Findlay Papers, PPC, MCHC. 43 Typewritten manuscript, passim, Nolan V. Marbrey Papers, PPC, MCHC. 44 The theme of women as victimizers is powerfully conveyed in British literature of the Great War; the examples of Siegfried Sassoon’s “Glory of Women” and\n\nCREATING MARINES 65 deal, and none of them could be regarded as universal, but they nevertheless represented a tool by which men were manipulated to do battle. The Marines did not undertake the process of redefining social conventions and gender roles on their own; they exploited existing divisions and tensions. American propaganda supported familiar, dichotomous tropes: women as nurturers, healers, and victims; men as noble soldiers and protectors — traditional categories one author labels “Beautiful Souls” and “Just Warriors.”*? Commercial advertising as well as poster art supporting everything from war bond drives to recruitment or industrial productivity tended to objectify or trivialize women’s roles in society.*° American society as a whole\n\nbecame the major “theater of operations” in what some literary women perceived as an ongoing “war of the sexes.”*’ For example, the stories of Kay Boyle suggest, in the words of one scholar, “that what women face 1n wartime is not only the unleashed violence of sex-starved men but also the elaborate images such men construct\n\nas a compensation for and a retaliation against the sex they are presumably fighting to preserve.” Marines harnessed and appropriated the divisions arising out of the war of the sexes as a mechanism to prepare men for battle against the Japanese. At the same time, fighting in the Pacific added another arrow to the quiver from which men drew in this domestic struggle.*\n\nTo delineate their break from female domination of their en-\n\nWilfred Owen’s “Greater Love” are discussed in Gilbert and Gubar, No Man’s 45 Jean Bethke Elshtain, Women and War (New York: Basic Books, 1987), 3-13. 46 Susan M. Hartman, The Home Front and Beyond (Boston: Twayne, 1982), 41. See also Leila J. Rupp, Mobilzzing Women for War (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), 137-66; and Maureen Honey, Creating Roste the Riveter (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1984). 47 This is the general theme in Gilbert and Gubar, No Man’s Land. It is stated explicitly in the first chapter, “The Battle of the Sexes: The Men’s Case,” of vol. 1, The War of the Words (1988). In one example from around the turn of the century that ts particularly apposite of Marine attitudes in the Pacific War, at\n\nthe beginning of the chapter entitled “Fighting for Life” the authors quote George Egerton: “It seems almost congenital with some women to have deeply rooted in their innermost nature a smoldering enmity, ay, sometimes a physical disgust to men, it is a kind of kin-feeling to the race-dislike of white men to black [or ‘yellow’]” (1:65).\n\n48 Susan Gubar, “ ‘This Is My Rifle, This Is My Gun’: World War II and the Blitz on Women,” in Higonnet et al., Behind the Lines, 257. The title of this marvelous essay comes from the famous Marine rhyme referred to by Sledge (With the Old Breed, 10), Clark (Unlikely Arena, 10), and Leon Uris’s Battle Cry (New York: Bantam, 1953], 53) that distinguishes between the military weapon (rifle) and the sexual weapon (gun [penis]): “This is my rifle, / This is my gun, / This is for fighting, / This is for fun.”\n\n66 AMERICAN SAMURAI vironment, the marines reordered their world and reassembled it in a form that made greater sense to them, a world in which masculine virtues represented the highest standards of conduct and order. The process began in earnest with the arrival of new recruits\n\nat boot camp. The exaggeratedly all-male atmosphere of recruit training was part of what Theweleit labels the “crucial transformation” of eros.*” As psychogenic fantasy, this transformation created an antagonistic view across the gender line not unlike the race line that separated Americans from Japanese. The transformation of eros fostered the objectification of women. Signs of weakness,\n\nfailure, and denigration were often labeled in female terms, whereas strength, success, and praise emphasized an individual’s masculinity. In the atmosphere of the camps maternalistic or nurturing traits generally associated with women were inverted and became threatening, and individuals prided themselves on the extent to which they could remain untouched by such influences. Women also became objects of danger and disgrace in classes on sex hygiene. Marines were taught that syphilis was an invisible danger lurking everywhere, not just with prostitutes but even with a sweetheart back home. Under these circumstances, any sexual relations posed a potential threat of infection that might result in a man’s separation from his buddies or even the service.” Once begun, this indoctrination continued until either the man received his discharge from the Marine Corps and returned to civilian life or he suffered serious injury or sickness that at least temporarily stripped him of his self-sufficiency and isolated him from the male\n\ngroup. |\n\nRecognizing, at least subconsciously, that the processes by which\n\ninductees were socialized and indoctrinated were in some ways highly misogynistic, the Marine Corps carefully cultivated a public image intended to reassure the civilian community that the changes being effected on its husbands, sons, or brothers were not as pro-\n\nfound or fundamental as they eventually proved to be. Through several official books and pamphlets published on recruit training, 49 Theweleit, Male Fantasies, 2:170.\n\n50 Men with an active venereal disease were not allowed to ship overseas. One Army inspector general found that some malingerers would pay men with open venereal sores for pus or semen with which to infect themselves in order to avoid shipment to North Africa; Elliot D. Cooke, All but Thee and Me (Washington: Infantry Journal Press, 1946), 92. For more on official policy and education, see United States Army, Medical Department, Preventive Medicine in World War II, vol. 5, Communicable Diseases, Transmitted through Contact or by Un-\n\nknown Means, edited by Ebbe Curtis Hoff (Washington: Office of the Surgeon General, 1960).\n\nCREATING MARINES 67 and with the help of a few quasi-official books written by marines, the Marine Corps drew attention away from the earnestness with which DIs and recruits approached training and instead emphasized the superficial aspects of the training program and trivialized the efforts aimed at redefining moral and behavioral standards.”' With traces of juvenile excitement, for instance, as at the initiation into the secrets of a new club, virtually every account mentions the new vocabulary learned at boot camp, often including a glossary of terms. Families could expect their men to return on leave speaking an esoteric language spiced with nautical terms like “deck,” “head,” and “scuttlebutt.” Of course omitted from mention were expressions familiar to any recruit like “shitbird” (his new nom de guerre), “donkey dick” (for a variety of meats served in the mess halls), or “fuckin’ A” (for emphatic affirmation). Almost with a sense of wonder, recruits in these books discover how well their platoons\n\ncan drill together by the end of training, and all express personal pride in successfully emulating the bearing and spotless appearance of the ideal Marine — their senior DI. Yet training with the bayonet or in hand-to-hand combat only hinted at what lay ahead. Hidden\n\nfrom the recruits’ vision was the knowledge that these episodes were not ends in themselves; the Marine Corps did not expect the new recruits to be able to hold their own as a result of a few drills run against bayonet dummies. These authors were describing, with heavy-handed efforts at humor, the process of being set apart from mainstream civilian life, “being ‘made’ strange.””*\n\nThe inculcation of discipline in all its many forms was only a means to an end. To the recollection of Robert Leckie, every action taken in recruit training focused on discipline:\n\nThere was absolutely no talk of the war; we heard no fiery lectures about killing Japs, such as we were to hear later on. ... Everything but discipline, Marine Corps discipline, was steadfastly mocked and ridiculed, be it holiness or high finance. These drill instructors were dedicated martinets. Like the sensualist who feels that if a thing cannot be eaten, drunk or taken 51 The more significant examples of these generally uninspiring books are Gilbert P. Bailey, Boot (New York: Macmillan, 1944); Jim Lucas, Combat Correspondent (New York: Reynal and Hitchcock, 1944); Rowland Vance, They Made Me a Leatherneck (New York: W. W. Norton, 1943); and Martin L. Myers, Yardbird Myers (Philadelphia: Dorrance, 1944). 52 Myers, for example, writes, “Now that we have gotten a little accustomed to military life, we don’t quite know how to act when thrown in with civilians again” (Yardbird Myers, 220). Similarly innocent reactions also appear in Jack Colegrove’s\n\ncorrespondence with his mother (Jack Colegrove Papers, PPC, MCHC) and in the Robert Graff Papers (PPC, MCHC).\n\n68 AMERICAN SAMURAI to bed, it does not exist, so were these martinets in their outlook. All was discipline.””\n\nWith each move from boot camp to regular garrison and finally into combat, the discipline described by Marine memoirists weakened. The real purpose behind what they describe was subtler, more insidious, and largely beyond the conscious control of the DIs or their charges. Separating men from civilian sensibilities created a common perspective and shared pattern of thought. The institutional shaping of thought made allowances for individuality,\n\nwithin certain limits; it did not matter if a man was religiously devout, introverted, or so on. What counted in this process was that certain ideas were superimposed on all of the variegated per-\n\nsonalities assembled in the Marine Corps, not to the exclusion , of the underlying personalities, but with sufficient intensity to weld them into militarily useful men. In 1942 these fundamental ideas revolved around an almost tangible self-consciousness, an awareness of past traditions juxtaposed to the historical moment, when the war seemed still to hang in the balance. By 1945, these shared ideas had shifted away from a remote imagination toward\n\na pragmatism and technocratic expertise linked directly to the harsh realities of the front lines. In both cases, however, they provided the common ground between men of highly disparate backgrounds and attitudes. Discipline and comportment were eas-\n\nily sloughed off in combat, but the underlying ideas often remained.\n\nFrom the perspective of a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old recruit, gender issues did not involve an abstract appreciation for the battle of the sexes. A book published in 1943 entitled When Your Son Goes to War serves as an example of where and how the\n\nline separating the boy-recruit from the man-marine was drawn.\n\nAs a military wife and mother of a draft-age son, the author, Clella Reeves Collins, accepts as her due male expressions of sympathy: “ ‘[W]e feel sorry for you mothers. We know eighteen seems awfully young, and you’re full of fears for what may happen\n\nto Johnny when he gets where you can’t remind him to put on his overshoes, drink his milk, and get in early!’ ” To Reeves the snatching of a generation of sons, however just and necessary, 1s “a clarion challenge” to all women to defend their civilization: 53 Leckie, Helmet for My Pillow, 10-11. Manchester “yearned for stern discipline” to find legitimation of his manliness (Goodbye, Darkness, 123). Sledge makes clear\n\nthat his DI was “neither cruel nor sadistic.” As a disciplinarian he toughened Sledge for the ordeal he would face in combat (With the Old Breed, 158).\n\nCREATING MARINES 69 “The mother instinct for preservation of the race is being evoked as never before in the history of humanity.”** The Marine Corps promised not just an escape from cloying maternal instincts and\n\nreminders to drink milk; it provided an alternative model of civilization to that the crusading “mother instinct” envisioned. It\n\nwas also a celebration of release and exaltation of an abstract masculine ideal. The image of war as an escape from female-dominated society, common among the eighteen- and nineteen-year-old marines who\n\nmade up the bulk of the line companies, has many parallels. It is a recurrent theme in American literature, whether with Huck Finn wanting to “light out for the Territory” or Willa Cather’s Claude Wheeler fleeing domestic stagnation to the trenches of France. In\n\nattracting men who sought adventure and escape, the Marine Corps, like the French Foreign Legion, preferred men who were somewhat “dysfunctional” or at least unsatisfied with civilian soci-\n\nety.” The oft-mentioned influence of the Eton playing fields on the battle of Waterloo also had parallels for the marines during the Second World War: the camaraderie, the competition, the role playing that many boys had experienced on the high school football fields — often only a few weeks before arriving at training — were. not simply mirrored but magnified upon initiation into the mysteries of the Marine Corps. Social group pressures, often distinctly adolescent, exerted a strong influence on marines thrust into unfamiliar and frequently dangerous situations. In every marine memoir there is at least one great celebration, typically tinged with juvenile exuberance, of release from societal\n\nstrictures. For Robert Leckie, this began as he and his new acquaintances started to “revel in the hardship of the train ride” down\n\nto Parris Island. He ascribes this to the “intangible mystique” of the Marines, but a subsequent observation, reminiscent of Theodore Roosevelt, is more revealing: “We were having it rough, which\n\nis exactly what we expected and what we signed up for.... The man who has had it roughest is the man to be most admired. Conversely, he who has had it the easiest is the least praiseworthy.””°\n\nRussell Davis remembered ten days spent on “anti-submarine watch” as the most idyllic of the war. On a remote “island paradise”\n\nwith his immediate friends, all that was unpleasant — and often 54 Clella Reeves Collins, When Your Son Goes to War (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1943), xvi—xvii. 55 Porch, Foreign Legion, 426. 56 Leckie, Helmet for My Pillow, 6. His comment also bears upon the earlier discussion regarding men’s acceptance of growing abuses in recruit training.\n\n70 AMERICAN SAMURAI associated with women — diminished to the point of leaving these men blissfully oblivious of the war and its vileness, allowing them to act out what was, in essence, a boyhood fantasy.*’ The celebration of manhood had many elements entwined with the notion that the war was an adventure. For many, the war rep-\n\nresented the first time they had left the narrow social and geographical boundaries of their childhood that were linked to nurturing, clinging, puritanical, or indifferent women. It became both a literal and a symbolic journey into adulthood. One obvious aspect of this journey for many of these young men was their sexual\n\ninitiation. Given the pressures of training and the relative scarcity of available women in the presence of so many servicemen, the nature of this initiation often contributed significantly to the objectification of women.” For others, the war allowed them to act out male fantasies. The military in general attracted a variety of “swashbucklers” and “gunslingers,” men who dressed and swaggered about like movie-house renegades, carrying knives or pistols, and posturing at least as much for their own benefit as for those around them.” The war seemed to offer these men a return to the American frontier days; it created new opportunities to prove one’s worth, demonstrate self-reliance, and restore a “proper” balance between the sexes.” By the time a marine had embarked for his overseas adventure, women had in one sense become little more than part of the scenic backdrop to war. The tropical islands were at first evocative of a Dorothy Lamour movie for many. After taking a stroll into the\n\njungle on Pavuvu, Second Lieutenant Richard C. Kennard described the scene in a letter home: “The noises of the birds and parrots in the high trees filled with vines made the whole place remind me of the Tarzan jungle pictures.”°' Even the less innocent 57 Davis, Marine at War, 134-49. 58 In Tijuana, while his friend and a girl went behind a curtain, Marbrey, for a dollar, had intercourse with the girl’s mother on the floor (Nolan V.

Manchester wrote (Goodbye, Darkness, 146), “I wanted to be a man,\n\nand an essential step in the process... was the forfeiture of my own virginity.” The next twelve pages, tracing Manchester’s two failed efforts to achieve his goal in wartime San Diego, fully support Cynthia Enloe’s conclusions concerning the militarization of women as sexual objects in Does Khaki Become You? (Boston:\n\nPandora Press, 1983). 59 James Jones, The Thin Red Line (New York: Charies Scribner's Sons, 1962), 6—\n\n22. A recurring theme throughout the novel is the notion of men seeking, in essence, an external symbol of manhood, and Jones takes sixteen pages at the beginning of the book to describe one “gunslinger” pfc’s successful effort to steal a pistol for this purpose. 60 This was an attitude actively exploited by the Marine leadership; see below, 117-18. 61 Kennard, letter dated 31 May 1944, Richard C. Kennard Papers, PPC, MCHC.\n\nCREATING MARINES 71 observations and comparisons contained an almost equally naive quality. Upon his arrival in Samoa a few months before the Guadalcanal landings, a lieutenant in the 7th Marines confided in his diary, “I must, in all fairness, mention the local breasts. They are, true to narrative, wondrous to behold in their unrestrained nearly\n\nnatural state. They would, aside from their color, make many | American women green with envy.””’ Noting how marines eagerly\n\napproached native “maidens,” who, “though dark brown, were comely and friendly,” one chaplain worried about fighting “some pitched battles with the devil” to protect their pure white souls. Yet he need not have worried so much; the marines’ encounters with native women seldom received much more attention than the coconut trees and simply added to the already exotic allure of overseas\n\nservice. These bare-breasted women, like those captured in the photographs of various marines’ scrapbooks, were not regarded with obsessive prurient interest by the young men headed into battle for the first time; they were a curiosity, intriguing and even attractive, but virtually part of the island scenery.°” On Samoa this tropical landscape was relatively benign, but on Guadalcanal and in subsequent campaigns, where the island scenery took on more sinister and hostile meanings, associations with women became likewise more ugly and threatening.\n\nIn their descriptions of the jungles on Guadalcanal and New Britain, marines used metaphors that explicitly identified them with\n\nwomen. The tremendous fecundity of the jungle shocked the Americans. Observing the “black, circling funnels” of flies that swarmed out of several Japanese corpses, Leckie noted with horror\n\nand disgust that “the tropics had won; her minions were everywhere. ...”°* T. Grady Gallant echoed this revulsion: the “savagery of Nature” in disposing of the dead was represented by the armies of huge ants sent “to penetrate the liquefying mass and disappear on a mission that revolted the imagination.””’ The stench of rotting This was also Sledge’s short-lived first impression of Pavuvu as viewed from the ship’s rail (With the Old Breed, 34). 62 Joseph H. Griffith, diary entry, dated 6 June 1942, Joseph H. Griffith Papers, PPC, MCHC. 63 This was also the result in part of quick preventive measures taken by chaplains, the provost, and the Samoans to ensure the marines did not get out of control. Quoted observations from H. H. Tower, Fighting the Devil with the Marines (Philadelphia: Dorrance, 1945), 123; he also insisted that the “boys” wanted only companionship rather than sex (150). Such specific issues are never broached directly in the official history; United States Navy Department, Bureau of Naval Personnel, The History of the Chaplain Corps, United States Navy, 2 vols. (Washing-\n\nton: GPO, n.d.). 64 Leckie, Helmet for My Pillow, 88. 65 T.
