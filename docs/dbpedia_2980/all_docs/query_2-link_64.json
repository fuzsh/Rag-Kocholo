They range from seemingly quotidian things such as fish-hooks and baskets to great sculptures of divinities, architectural forms and canoes. These collections constitute a remarkable resource for understanding history and society across Oceania, cross-cultural encounters since the voyages of Captain Cook, and the colonial transformations that have taken place since. They are also collections of profound importance for Islanders today, who have varied responses to their displaced heritage, and renewed interest in ancestral forms and practices. This two-volume book enlarges understandings of Oceanic art and enables new reflection upon museums and ways of working in and around them. In dialogue with Islanders' perspectives, It exemplifies a growing commitment on the part of scholars and curators to work collaboratively and responsively. Volume II illustrates the sheer variety of Pacific artefacts and histories in museums, and similarly the heterogeneity of the issues and opportunities that they raise. Over thirty essays explore materialities, collection histories, legacies of empire, and contemporary projects.\n\nHundreds of thousands of works of art and artefacts from many parts of the Pacific are dispersed across European museums.

This often resulted in conflicts with the Indigenous population, but also among European agents themselves. Crimes committed by Europeans in the Pacific led to punishment by their parent country in order to protect the Indigenous population. At the same time, crimes committed by Pacific Islanders against Europeans also resulted in punitive action, with European nations sending warships to protect their citizens and their interests. Attempts were made to control the recruitment of Pacific Islanders for labour and to restrict the sale of guns by traders to the Indigenous population. These factors among others built up pressures for the acquisition and control of the various island groups by European countries. HMS Royalist is part of this history. Over a three-year period the Australian station third class cruiser sailed around the Western Pacific attempting to remove guns sold to Pacific Islanders, enforce law and order within both the Indigenous and European populations living in the region, and declare some islands British protectorates."
