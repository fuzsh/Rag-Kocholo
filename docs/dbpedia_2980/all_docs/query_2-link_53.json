View Original DTHSArchivesOnline.\n\nThey include as many items as I could find by searching on the names of the suburbs Doncaster (and therefore Doncaster East), Templestowe, Donvale and Bulleen.\n\nIn addition to Family Notices listings (births, engagements, marriages, deaths, funerals, in memoriam notices) I have added items from news and social pages of the newspapers (reports of engagements, weddings, wedding anniversaries, divorces, sudden deaths, inquests, wills & estates).\n\nSome tips for searching:\n\nThe transcriptions on Trove are meant to be an exact rendition of the newspaper item. Names may have been misspelled in the newspaper or by the transcriber. Try a few alternatives before you give up.\n\nNote that names beginning with Mc were often shown in the early newspapers beginning with M’ - hence M’Kay, rather than McKay.\n\nIf a marriage or death does not appear in the decade in which you know it should be try later decades.\n\nSometimes a later In Memoriam notices appears when there was no original death notice.\n\nSometimes a later Wedding Anniversary notice appears when the original wedding was not announced in the press.\n\nAny notes that I have added to the text are shown thus: [There is a line missing at this point as the paper was creased before it was scanned.]\n\n[sic] - indicates that the misspelling is what appeared in the original newspaper.\n\nWhere the scan of the newspaper is unclear it will be indicated thus: [?], [??], [189?] or [home?] – the latter being the best guess at what the word may have been.\n\nIf the name of the suburb did not appear in the original newspaper announcement then I am unlikely to have found it.\n\nTrove is an excellent resource for your family history search. New material is being added there from time to time. I highly recommend that you continue your own search there.\n\nKay Mack Templestowe 6 July 2011\n\n1939 - Accidentally Shot\n\nRay Hughes, aged 13 years, of Foot street, Templestowe, is in the Children's Hospital as a result of a shooting accident yesterday afternoon.\n\nThe police who investigated the accident, learned that Hughes and two companions went on a shooting excursion, one of the boys having an air-rifle, and the other a small-bore rifle.\n\nHughes was jumping over a fence when the rifle was accidentally discharged. He was treated by a district doctor before being taken to hospital.\n\n1939 'ACCIDENTALLY SHOT', The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957), 1 September, p. 2. , viewed 26 Jul 2021, http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11235764\n\nThe Courier-Mail, Brisbane, Tuesday 12 September 1939 Memories of Drought, War, and Floods\n\nSTORIES of long ago, when experiencing the ravages of drought, and later of flood, on both of which occasions they lost everything they had, are told by 84-year-old Mrs. S. J. Thrupp of Broadmarsh, Surat, who is at present in Brisbane.\n\nMrs. Thrupp drove the 300 miles from her home to Brisbane by car, and has just returned from a long holiday in Victoria, where she visited her old home at Sutton Grange, to which she went as a bride.\n\nBorn in the North of Ireland, Mrs. Thrupp came to Australia at the age of six, and lived in Victoria until she came to Queensland 56 years ago. She settled in the Surat district and has lived there ever since. Recalling memories of drought, Mrs. Thrupp told of how, when all fodder failed, wearing men's attire, she rode with them to cut prickly pear for the cows.\n\nDuring the 1890 flood she awoke to find the water in her room level with the bed, so a ladder was hastily put up, and a boat rowed into the room to transfer her to a safer place. Her husband, who was away buying sheep, was forced to take refuge in a tree, where he stayed for a week, living on a pumpkin which happened to float by, and from which he scraped his daily rations. All his sheep were lost.\n\nMany Interests\n\nMemories of work done for the Red Cross during the last war are recalled by this wonderful old lady, who was then visiting Redcliffe.\n\nNow Mrs. Thrupp's interests are centred in her district branch of the Country Women's Association, of which she has been a member since its inception. She does a great deal of work for charity, having made five Afghan quilts, one of which realised £25 for the C.W.A. Although she has lost the use of one eye, she still does a lot of fine needle- work, and is able to thread the finest needle.\n\nA love of young people has led her to take an interest in the school children in her district, whom she has accompanied as far as Roma for tennis matches. Each year she gives them a fancy dress dance in the Shire Hall when as many as 100 children attend. Mrs. Thrupp's latest interest is her great-grandson, born on August 13 to Mr. and Mrs. William Denhert, of Grosvenor Downs (Surat). This month-old baby can claim the distinction of having four great grandparents, three grandparents, and a great-great-uncle, Mr. Reginald Denhert, of Doncaster (Victoria), who is 102 years of age.\n\nWith her daughter, Mrs. R. C. Denhert, and her grand-daughter, Mrs. A. Vinecombe, of Ballan (Victoria), Mrs. Thrupp will return to Surat during the week.\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Wednesday 20 September 1939\n\nIn Memoriam – Roll of Honour – On Active Service\n\nWILLIAMSON. - In memory of our dearly loved son and brother, Archie, killed in action September 20, 1917; also his loved cousin and comrade Stanley Williamson.

The usual toasts were honoured. Many congratulatory telegrams and messages were received. The gifts were numerous.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Broussard later left for Victoria, travelling by car to Devonport.

They had a family of 13 children - three daughters and 10 sons. Two died in infancy and one was killed in the Great War.\n\nMrs. Chivers was born at [?], December 18, 1852, and came to Australia in 1853, when she lived at Doncaster. Mr. Chivers, who was born at Templestowe on September 29, 1844, has lived in that district all his life. He has some of the original saws used to cut timber for the first bridges there. He has always been interested in sport, and was one of the first to start a cricket club in Templestowe. There are 51 grandchildren and 35 great-grandchildren.\n\n[Mrs Chivers' birthplace cannot be read in this copy. According to records held in the Doncaster Templestowe Historical Society archive the couple were Thomas Chivers and Emily Jane (nee Trott) and Emily was born in Bristol, England.]\n\nExaminer, Launceston, Tas., Saturday 24 February 1940\n\nWED 70 YEARS Victorian Couple. Celebrate MELBOURNE, Friday.\n\nMr. and Mrs. T. R. Chivers, of Templestowe, celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary to-day. The husband is in his 96th year, and the wife in her 89th. Last night, in Templestowe Memorial Hall, 250 residents gave them a complimentary social and dance. About 190 relatives, including most of their 10 children, 51 grandchildren, and 35 great-grandchildren will attend a party to-morrow night. On Sunday Mr. and Mrs. Chivers will go to Chelsea for a holiday. Seventy years after their marriage they still have that technique of mutual chaff and banter which is generally associated with the very young in spirit.\n\nThe Advertiser, Adelaide, Monday 26 February 1940\n\nIn Other Cities - Melbourne Gossip From Our Special Correspondent - MELBOURNE, February 25. - 70th Wedding Anniversary\n\nIt is not given to every man and wife to have the happiness of celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary, but such is the good fortune of Mr. and Mrs. T. R. Chivers, of Templestowe, who had their celebration on Friday.\n\nMr. Chivers is in his 96th year, and his wife is in her 89th. About 190 relatives, including most of their 10 children, 51 grandchildren and 35 great-grand-children, attended a party on Saturday night, and today Mr. and Mrs. Chivers left for a holiday at the seaside.\n\nMr. Chivers's father came to Australia in 1840. In 1851 he went to an auction, at which 156 acres of land at Templestowe were knocked down to him at £1 an acre. When he died the land was divided among his four sons, and Mr. Chivers's share has since been divided among his sons. When the family settled at Templestowe the bush was so dense that it took a day to blaze a track to the Yarra, a mile away. When Mr. Chivers was 10 his father decided that he must be christened. The family set out in style by bullock dray to the ceremony, which took place in a bark hut near Doncaster.\n\nIt took a whole day in those days to get a load of timber to Melbourne. Bullocks were the only draught animals which could withstand the rigors of travelling, and hay for them might cost as much as £30 or £40 a ton. Freight to Bendigo was consequently £200 a ton.\n\nMr. Chivers met his wife at a church tea meeting at Doncaster. She was nearly eight years his junior, and he confesses that he has never been able to catch up a second on her.\n\nThe Argus, Melbourne, Saturday 9 March 1940\n\nDeaths\n\nKNEE. - On the 8th March, at his residence, Woodhouse road, Doncaster East, George, beloved husband of Alice, also loving father of George, Emily (deceased), Harry, Nellie, Rose (Mrs. O.
