        "text": "Carlton and St Kilda gathered at the Shrine of Remembrance on Thursday to acknowledge 100 days until the ANZAC Day Centenary clash in Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nThe Round Four AFL match on Saturday, April 25 will honour two past players killed on the first day of the Gallipoli battle – Fenley McDonald (Carlton) and Claude Crowl (St Kilda).\n\nBoth men are believed to have died on April 25, 1915 when the ANZACs first stormed the beach at Gallipoli. Their bodies were never found.\n\nSpeaking to SEN, Carlton CEO Steven Trigg said the attachment that football has to ANZAC Day has left him \"speechless\".\n\n\"With the myriad of other stories that surround football's involvement with the conflict…it's such a humbling thing for us to be involved in (on) that day,\" said Trigg.\n\n\"I think it's just wonderful for our Club, (and) for our tribe to be involved in.\"\n\nWith just six weeks remaining until the Blues' kick off their AFL NAB Challenge campaign against West Coast, Trigg so far said Carlton's pre-season has been successful."
