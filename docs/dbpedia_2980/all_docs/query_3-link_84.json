endeavouring to convey to students the signiﬁcance and complexities of a conﬂict fought on such a vast scale as the Great War, the author can adopt two potential approaches – either chronological or thematic. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. The chronological approach requires students to make the appropriate connections, and it can become little more than a narrative heavily biased towards military and political events. The thematic approach is generally more analytical and, consequently, more rewarding, but it requires students to have some grasp of the chronology. The analytical approach is consciously chosen for this volume in the knowledge that there are a number of chronological narratives available, but all too few thematic analyses. Moreover, of the latter, none treat the war in sufﬁcient depth or at sufﬁcient length to reveal the wider political, diplomatic, social, economic, military and cultural contexts. It is also intended to introduce students to the enormous amount of new research, which has so greatly expanded academic knowledge of the war and taken the ‘new military history’ into so many new and exciting areas. Consequently, the footnotes are designed to be as comprehensive as possible. It is hoped that the true global signiﬁcance of a war that shaped the twentieth century will emerge from this volume and that, at the same time, it will go some way to demythologising the popular memory of a war which is widely misunderstood. It is that popular memory which ﬁrst aroused my own interest in the war since, although my father and his generation had so recently fought in the Second World War, it was the earlier conﬂict that seemingly held more signiﬁcance for so many of those among whom I grew up. I never knew my maternal grandfather. A regular soldier in the Royal Artillery, he arrived in France with the 85th Battery, 11th Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, attached to the Third Indian (Lahore) Division, in October 1914 and saw service at Festubert, Aubers Ridge and Loos in 1915, on the Somme in 1916, at Arras in 1917, and again on the Somme in 1918. He\n\nPREFCE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\ndied as a result of his war injuries in 1938. My maternal grandmother was employed on war work, as was her sister, and I remember vividly my great uncle’s account of being aboard HMS Aboukir when it was torpedoed in September 1914. Subsequently, he served with the Dover Patrol and in the monitor, HMS Lord Clive, which, among other duties, bombarded German coastal batteries in support of the raids on Zeebrugge and Ostend in April 1918. There were many men in the village in which I was born – Whitchurch in Buckinghamshire – who had seen service with the Royal Bucks Hussars at Gallipoli and in Palestine or with the Bucks Battalions of the Territorial Force in France and Italy. The names of families still well represented within the village appeared on the war memorial in the church. Since turning professionally to the subject of the Great War over twenty years ago, I have beneﬁted enormously from the expertise of many friends and colleagues. There has also been the challenge of teaching students brought up on the received ‘myth’ of the war as well as testing out arguments before the knowledgeable audiences at branch meetings of the Western Front Association. A series of lectures to schools delivered in Sydney and Newcastle (Australia) at the invitation of Alf Pickard and the New South Wales History Teachers Association in 1998 was also a valuable opportunity to try out various theories. I was lucky that colleagues at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, included such distinguished historians of the war as John Keegan, Christopher Duffy, Paddy Grifﬁth, Richard Holmes, Keith Simpson and, later, Gary Shefﬁeld, Stephen Badsey and Paul Harris. That ‘lost company’ may exist now only in memory, but fortunately its members and many other friends are frequently to be found at meetings of the British Commission for Military History and the military history seminars run at the Institute of Historical Research by Brian Bond and Michael Dockrill of the Department of War Studies at King’s College, London. My thoughts on the interconnection between strategy and war aims were greatly assisted by my visiting period in the Department of Strategy at the US Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island in 1992–93, in the company of scholars such as Douglas Porch, George Baer, David Kaiser, William Fuller and John Maurer. It is difﬁcult to include everyone who has done so much to help me towards an understanding of the war over the years, but mention should be made of Jim Beach, John Bourne, Lisa Budreau, Mark Connelly, David French, John Gooch, Toby Graham, Keith Grieves, Matthew Hughes, Keith Jeffery, John Lee, Chris McCarthy, Alf Peacock, Nick Perry, Bill Philpott, Peter Scott, Matthew\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nPREFCE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nSeligmann, Peter Simkins, Sally Sokoloff, Edward Spiers, Hew Strachan, Rod Suddaby, Tim Travers, Jay Winter and David Woodward. I have also beneﬁted from the work of my former postgraduate students, Tim Bowman, Mike Senior, Bill Mitchinson Jim McDermott, Chris Northcott and Denise Poynter. This is, I hope, a better book for the insights of all these. None, of course, is responsible for the failings that remain. For the ﬁrst edition, I was grateful to the series editor, Bruce Collins, and successive Longman editors, Andrew MacLennan, Hilary Shaw and Heather McCallum, and ﬁnally the project editor, Jill Birch for their great patience. For this second edition, my thanks also go to Christina WipfPerry, Mary-Clare Connellan, Hetty Reid and Casey Mein at Pearson, and Karen Mclaren and Linda Dhondy for their even greater patience. Almost as soon as the ﬁrst edition of this book was published, new work was already appearing and there has been an extraordinary growth of Great War studies over the past ﬁve years. To give but one example, at the time of original publication only one article had appeared in what was to become a lively debate on the true nature of the Schlieffen Plan. Much more has been done since 2001 on German occupation policies, neutrals, on more distant belligerents such as Japan and China, on cultural aspects of the war, and so on. The gratifying response to the ﬁrst edition, therefore, has encouraged me to revise and update it in the light of this new work. I am grateful to the various readers and reviewers who commented upon the original edition, enabling me not only to correct some errors but also to expand coverage in areas where it was felt the ﬁrst edition deﬁcient, and to take up suggestions for improving the user-friendliness of the volume as a whole. Thus, for example, there is now more on naval operations and upon the experiences of prisoners of war. There is also a chronology and a full bibliography, supplementing the detailed footnotes of the original edition. Note: Place names are rendered in the form most familiar to English readers. Where they have changed substantially, the modern name is given in parentheses. Until February 1918, Russia used the Old Style or Julian calendar, which, at the time of the Great War, was thirteen days behind the western, New Style, or Gregorian calendar. All dates are given according to the Gregorian calendar. In the case of some particularly signiﬁcant dates in 1917, however, the Julian date is given in parentheses. Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916, Greece in 1924, and Turkey in 1927. Ian F. W.

There are men and women alive today who experienced it as children, and a very few still living who participated in it as young adults. While wartime events clearly shaped the twentieth century, however, it is too often forgotten that those who experienced the events continued themselves to guide the political destinies of the former belligerents sometimes up to over ﬁfty years later. Winston Churchill, both Cabinet minister and front-line soldier between 1914 and 1918, did not retire from ofﬁce as British prime minister until 1955 and both his successors, Anthony Eden (1955–57) and Harold Macmillan (1957–63), had served in the trenches of the Western Front. Macmillan may have been the ‘last Edwardian’ in Downing Street, but President Charles de Gaulle, wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans at Verdun in March 1916, continued in power in France until 1969. United States president Dwight D. Eisenhower (1952–60) had been a West Point cadet and had not seen active service, but his predecessor, Harry S. Truman (1945–52), had been an artillery ofﬁcer on the Western Front in 1918. The veteran politician and former president of Turkey, serving a third term as prime minister between 1961 and 1965, Mustaf Ismet Pasha (known as Inönü), had been an exceptionally young divisional commander during the war. David Ben Gurion, prime minister of Israel from 1949 to 1953 and from 1955 to 1963, served with Britain’s Jewish Legion in Palestine, while Moshe Shertok (later Sharett), who held the post from 1954 to 1955, had served with the Ottoman army in Macedonia and Palestine. Idris, King of Libya from 1951 to 1969, had fought the Italians as a leader of the Senussi during the war. On the\n\n2\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\npolitical left, Nikita Khrushchev, who had played a minor role in the Russian Revolution and then fought in the Russian Civil War (1917–21), was not ousted from power in the Soviet Union until 1964. Ho Chi Minh, who had tried unsuccessfully to plead the Vietnamese nationalist cause at the Paris peace conference in 1919, led North Vietnam from 1954 until his death in 1969. A veteran of the Spartacist rising in Berlin in 1918, Walter Ulbricht remained at the helm of the German Democratic Republic as ﬁrst general secretary of the Communist Party from 1946 until 1971. Norman Manley, left-wing prime minister of Jamaica from 1955 to 1962, won the Military Medal serving with the Royal Artillery. Josip Broz, better known from his Second World War pseudonym of Tito (The Hammer), was ﬁrst exposed to communism as an Austro-Hungarian conscript in a Russian prisoner of war camp. He was to be president of Yugoslavia, itself a creation of the Great War, from 1946 until his death in 1980. Whatever the obvious consequences of the Second World War for Europe and the wider world, the political arena in which these men operated owed as much, if not more, to the twentieth century’s ﬁrst global ‘total’ conﬂict. It was the Great War that destroyed four empires – those of Imperial Germany, Austria-Hungary, Tsarist Russia and Ottoman Turkey. The consequences were profound, not least in the Middle East, whose politics remain conditioned by events between 1914 and 1918 and the post-war settlement effected by Britain and France. Rather similarly, the Great War had a profound impact upon Ireland, with consequences that have contributed materially to contemporary divisions. The war gravely weakened Europe’s inﬂuence generally, even if the United States chose to wield its new-found power in ﬁnancial rather than military or diplomatic terms. Without the Great War, communism would arguably not have triumphed in Russia, nor fascism been given its opportunity in Germany and Italy. Indeed, Churchill was not alone in choosing to regard the two world wars as a second Thirty Years’ War, echoing the conﬂict that had consumed much of Europe from 1618 to 1648.1 In another sense the Great War is also still in the visual memory in that not only photographs but also early moving images on ﬁlm survive. Malcolm Smith has made the important point that, prior to the expansion of cheap photography in the early years of the twentieth century, only a few adults with a wealthy background ‘had any clear idea of what they looked like as children, or what their parents looked like when they were younger, and probably only the dimmest recollection of what their grandparents had looked like at all’. Thus, the Great War just falls within what\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nSmith has called ‘a more dependable popular memory’.2 Apart from the rituals of annual remembrance and the physical evidence of war cemeteries and remains of trenches in France, Flanders and elsewhere, there are other reminders of the Great War, at least in Britain. Until recently, there were licensing laws which had endured since 1914, while British Summer Time remains a legacy of 1916. Popular linguistic usage in Britain reﬂects soldiers’ slang, such as Blighty, conchie, Jerry and so on. There is, too, an enduring literary and artistic legacy with which many are familiar through the medium of a handful of well-known, but hardly representative, poets such as Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. Some historians would claim that this cultural legacy, which has endured in the work of contemporary writers such as Pat Barker, represents a ‘modern memory’.3 Certainly, the collective British popular memory embraces persistent myths. Indeed, it might be argued that the Great War was refashioned at the time of its ﬁftieth anniversary through popular histories of the time such as Leon Wolff’s In Flanders Fields or Alan Clark’s The Donkeys, and the musical play and ﬁlm, Oh! What A Lovely War. Interestingly, when, in 1964, John Terraine, Correlli Barnett and others sought in the scripts of the landmark BBC television series The Great War, to counter what they regarded as the pervasive misinterpretation of the war, audience research reports showed that the visual content had reinforced the popular concept of the war’s futility for a mass audience estimated at 8 million per episode.4 As recently as 1998, tabloid headlines in the Daily Express demanded the removal of Field Marshal Earl Haig’s statue from Whitehall on the grounds that his wasting of his men’s lives rendered him no better than a war criminal. Surveying much Great War popular historiography, one is reminded of the newspaper editor’s refrain in John Ford’s classic western, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance: ‘when legend becomes fact, print the legend’.5 The capacity for myth-making derives largely from the fact that, despite those genuine historical echoes around us, we are now as distanced from 1914 as those who fought it were from the Great Reform Act of 1832. The past, to echo L. P. Hartley’s novel of the Edwardian era, The Go Between, is a ‘foreign country’ when it stretches beyond immediate memory. In 1967, Geoffrey Barraclough wrote that, ‘on a purely practical level of daily life, a person living today who was suddenly put back into the world of 1900 would ﬁnd himself on familiar ground, whereas if he returned to 1870, even in industrialised Britain, the differences would be more striking than the similarities’.6 It was in this sense, therefore, that Barraclough characterised the 1890s as the beginning of ‘contemporary\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nhistory’. Certainly, the Great War has become regarded as a great catalyst of change, a ‘total’ war fought on such a scale seemingly to demonstrate irrefutably Leon Trotsky’s dictum that war is the ‘locomotive of history’. In the 1960s and 1970s, historians such as Arthur Marwick began to construct models of the inter-relationship between total war and social change, emphasising that, even where change might have been attributable to longer-term evolutionary trends, war fought on a global scale was likely to accelerate the pace of changes already taking place. In essence, therefore, Marwick’s interpretation of the Great War was as an event marking a discontinuity with the past.7 The issues of change and continuity are central to much historical debate, therefore it is not altogether surprising that this should be reﬂected in much of the continuing debate on the Great War, the thrust of recent contributions being to emphasise continuity rather than change.8\n\nIndustrialisation and the state Any attempt to measure the impact of the Great War on Europe and the wider world must perforce begin with an examination of the nature of the world of 1914. Certainly, as indicated by Barraclough’s observation, there had been considerable change in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century as the technological, scientiﬁc and material explosion of social effort that had been earlier known only to Britain reached the continent. In 1870, there were perhaps as many as seventy European cities with a population of over 100,000, but Paris and London alone exceeded 1 million, the majority of Europe’s approximately 300 million people living on the land or in small towns. Industrialisation and its attendant urbanisation allowed European societies to sustain growing populations through the increase in productive wealth, advances in preventative medicine and the beginnings of a global economy. This last resulted in more, better and cheaper foodstuffs becoming available from extra-European sources. By 1900, therefore, over two hundred European cities exceeded a population of 100,000, and Berlin, Moscow, St Petersburg, Vienna, Constantinople and Glasgow had all matched Paris and London as urban conurbations of over 1 million inhabitants.9 Europe’s population had grown rapidly to some 400 million in barely thirty years. It was a population with not only a longer life expectancy than ever before, but also far more educated, since industrialisation demanded a more skilled labour force. In 1850, half of Europe’s people\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nhad been illiterate, but this was to fall steadily to about 10 per cent by 1930. In part, Imperial Germany’s rapid industrial rise can be explained in terms of a sophisticated state educational system, particularly in scientiﬁc and technical subjects, but Prussia had pioneered universal primary education before 1870. By 1880, the example had been emulated by Belgium, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Educational progress naturally varied, however, from state to state. It was suggested, for example, that, whereas 1 out of every 1,000 conscripts entering the German army would be illiterate, the proportion would rise to 68 out of every 1,000 in the French army, 220 in the Austro-Hungarian army, and to 330 in the Italian army.10 Moreover, while emphasis has been placed on the consequences of urbanisation and industrialisation, this was not experienced by European society as a whole, for it was only Britain and Imperial Germany that had a higher percentage of their labour forces engaged in industry than agriculture. Indeed, whereas 34.6 per cent of the British population and 21.0 per cent of the German was urban-based in 1913, this was true of only 14.8 per cent of the French population, 11.6 per cent of the Italian, 8.8 per cent of the Austro-Hungarian and 7.0 per cent of the Russian population.11 The rapid pace of change wrought by industrialisation in western Europe sharpened the contrast with most of the states of central, southern and eastern Europe. These remained in effect peasant societies, for all that the agricultural depression of the 1870s to 1890s had accelerated the movement of the rural population towards towns and, in the case of southern Europe, to the United States. In fact, some of the more rapid increases in population were measured among the predominantly peasant societies of eastern Europe, the rural population of Tsarist Russia increasing by some 25 per cent between 1877 and 1897 and by the same factor again between 1897 and 1917. The Italian population also increased by some 4 million between 1880 and 1900.12 Mechanisation had entered agriculture, but it was still labour intensive and life in much of Europe remained governed by the unchanging pattern of the agricultural year, and by the speed of man and of horse. Railways had spread signiﬁcantly across Europe since the 1840s and even the transSiberian railway had been completed by 1902, but it should be borne in mind that Marconi had transmitted the ﬁrst wireless message across the Atlantic only in 1901, and both aircraft and motor vehicles were still in their infancy. The Wright brothers ﬂew for the ﬁrst time in 1903, and the ﬁrst mass production motor vehicle, Henry Ford’s Model T, was only announced in 1909.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nWhile there was increasing primary education, it was also the case that the majority of children in Europe did not progress to secondary education and, both in rural and urban areas, many lived in abject poverty. Charles Booth’s Life and Labour of the People of London, published in 1902, and Seebhom Rowntree’s study of York, Poverty: A Study of Town Life, published in the same year and intended to challenge the preoccupation of earlier social researchers with London, came up with broadly similar results. Booth calculated 30.7 per cent of London’s population living below what he regarded as the poverty line and Rowntree 27.84 per cent in York.13 As the growth of population indicated, many diseases had been arrested by the advance of science. Immunisation against typhoid was available from 1896 and against diphtheria from 1913, while the bacillus responsible for tuberculosis had been identiﬁed in 1882 and that for both tetanus and the plague by 1900. Aspirin had been introduced in 1899, vitamins discovered in 1902, and the ﬁrst antibiotic, Salvarsan, brought out in 1909. Yet, as Jay Winter has pointed out, despite the advances, 200 out of every 1,000 infants still failed to survive the ﬁrst year of life in areas like Birmingham, Blackburn, Salford, Shefﬁeld and Wolverhampton. Thus, although the average life expectancy of English males in 1910–12 was now greater than before, at 51.5 years, it was about the same as that of Ecuadorian males in 1961–63 and Iraqi males in 1970–75. As Winter puts it, therefore, in large parts of working-class Britain, ‘there were before 1914 conditions of poverty and ill health which today we associate with countries of the Third World’.14 If such conditions pertained in Britain, then it is not a feat of great imagination to envisage the conditions routinely endured by those Europeans in less advanced states. There was especially serious poverty in southern Italy, with life expectancy among Italian males rising only from an average of 35 years in 1874 to 44 years by 1905. Tsarist Russia was the most rapidly industrialising state in Europe by 1914, quadrupling its coal production between 1890 and 1914, increasing steel production tenfold since 1880 and expanding its rail mileage by one-quarter. But industrial progress existed alongside rural poverty exacerbated by the export of grain to sustain industrial expansion, harvest failures, and, in 1891–92, famine.15 Those who went to war in 1914 were not only more intimately acquainted than ourselves with hard labour, long hours and, at best, subsistence wages but, again to quote Winter, they ‘knew untimely death more frequently and experienced bereavement perhaps with a greater\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\ndegree of fatalism than we do today’.16 In a very real sense, therefore, the peoples of Europe were conditioned by their ordinary expectations to endure the kind of ordeal that was to soon to confront them. Such conditioning was enhanced by the growth in the power of the state. The majority of European states witnessed the gradual emergence of mass politics, representative legislatures and more responsible governments. The corollary was increasing state interference in various aspects of industrial and social life, enhanced state educational and welfare provision being but one spur to the growth in the size of state bureaucracies.17 Prior to 1870, only Belgium, Britain and France had any form of representative government but, in 1871, both France and Imperial Germany introduced universal male suffrage for national elections. Switzerland followed suit in 1874; Belgium, Norway and Spain in the 1890s; and Portugal, Sweden and Austria (though not Hungary) by 1914. During the same period the electorates of Britain, Italy and the Netherlands were enlarged, while even Tsarist Russia and Ottoman Turkey secured elected assemblies for the ﬁrst time in 1905 and 1908, respectively. Between 1907 and 1913, Denmark, Finland and Norway all introduced measures of female suffrage, New Zealand having done so in 1893 and Australia in 1902. In each state in which the franchise was widened, working class political organisations emerged such as the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD; German Social Democratic Party), founded in Imperial Germany in 1875, and the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in Britain in 1893. Meanwhile, mass trade unions for the unskilled rather than narrowly based craft unions became common in Austria-Hungary, Britain, France, Germany and Spain.18 Yet, despite scientiﬁc progress, education, democratisation and reform, as Ferro puts it, ‘The mass of . . . men were outside public affairs. They were prisoners in a universe whose mechanism was a mystery’.19 Europe remained overwhelmingly monarchical and aristocratic, its ruling royal families closely linked by blood. King Edward VII was uncle to both Tsar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II, while the grandchildren of Queen Victoria also ruled Greece, Spain, Romania, Sweden and a host of German states and principalities. Below the hereditary monarchies, absent only from France among the major powers, and Switzerland and (from 1910) Portugal among the lesser powers, traditional aristocratic and landed elites remained effectively in control of the main structures of government in much of Europe.20\n\n7\n\n8\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nIt should be said that most leading politicians did not see themselves as representatives of a class interest. Moreover, most administrations had to work with more than one social group in order to carry on the business of government, reconciling conﬂicting interests in an increasingly complex domestic political context. Generally, however, political elites were consistently successful in cultivating sufﬁcient consensual support to maintain and consolidate their power. This reﬂected not only the largely successful adaptation of the capitalist methods of the middle classes or bourgeoisie by the landed elite as in Britain, France and Austria-Hungary, but also the readiness of the middle classes themselves to accept assimilation rather than undermine that elite.21 Indeed, in the case of Germany, it has been argued by Michael Gordon that, despite its industrial growth, social structures remained largely pre-industrial. According to Jürgen Kocka, industrial wealth conferred less social mobility than elsewhere while the Mittelstand (middle class), equating to a lower middle class of white-collar workers, artisans and shopkeepers, was easily mobilised by the traditional landed elite in defence of the status quo. By contrast, historians such as Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn have argued that the German bourgeoisie was as inﬂuential in the social and economic spheres as was the traditional elite. They acknowledge, however, that any social and economic power was not reﬂected in political inﬂuence. It is clear, therefore, that Imperial Germany was a state in which political, economic and social life was in ﬂux despite apparent economic and military power and, in some respect, even a mood of optimism among its economic elite. In much of eastern and southern Europe, including Tsarist Russia and Italy, there was hardly a signiﬁcant middle class at all. It should also be noted that, in many states of central and eastern Europe, differentiation of class could actually be one of nationality.22 The concept of class is a difﬁcult one and there were many strata between and within various social groups, but the working class was often deferential in its attitudes to traditional elites and conservative in nature. Gerard De Groot, in pondering the response of working-class British soldiers to the trials of trench warfare, has turned round the apocryphal phrase attributed to Colonel Max Hoffman, that the British army was one of ‘lions led by donkeys’, to the suggestion that it was actually a case of donkeys led by lions. Similarly, de Groot suggests the rejection after the war by British ex-servicemen of radical veterans’ organisations in favour of the ofﬁcially sponsored British Legion proves their ‘sheep-like’ qualities.23\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nIdeology and the nation-state The growing incidence of industrial unrest in pre-war Europe might suggest that the industrial labour force was far from deferential and presents a ready contrast with the apparent readiness of the European working class to sacriﬁce itself for the state in the war itself. In 1913, France experienced over 1,000 strikes, Britain over 1,400, Germany over 2,100 and Russia over 2,400. There had been general strikes in Italy in 1904, in Spain in 1905 and in Portugal in 1912, while the revolution in Russia in 1905, in the wake of defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, was the most signiﬁcant revolutionary experience in Europe since the Paris Commune of 1871.24 The emergence of mass politics, however, while seemingly offering a widening of the democratic process, was in reality a spur to a nationalism which aristocratic governments invariably found ways to manipulate to their advantage. Thus, where the ideal of the nation-state was a reality rather than an aspiration, nationalism reinforced and buttressed the state. In new constructs such as Imperial Germany and Italy after 1871, the state assiduously cultivated the ideal of national unity, although without ever entirely overcoming the parochial nature of much of European society. Nevertheless, the expansion of education was a powerful tool in establishing national identities, with images of the Franco-Prussian War and the loss of the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine being ﬁrmly planted in the minds of French schoolchildren, the Germans teaching of their traditional role as a bulwark against the Slavs, and so on.25 Conscription for military service, too, contributed to the process. Originally, universal military service had been envisaged by some as a catalyst of social and political change, in which the army would become a school of the nation and service in it a route to the franchise. By the late nineteenth century, the rhetoric of the nation in arms was not to be taken so literally in political terms, and the social and political implications of military service were to be seen in the context of the moulding of the individual by the state. To Niccola Marselli, the new Italian army after 1871 was to be the ‘great crucible in which all provincial elements come to merge in Italian unity’. The French army would similarly turn peasants into Frenchmen, while the German High Command consciously attempted to effect a permanent eradication of SPD inﬂuence over its recruits through such means as political instruction classes and even retraining in agricultural skills. The imperial army of Austria-Hungary,\n\n9\n\nPlate 1 Symbolic of the old world, European monarchs photographed at Windsor on 20 May 1910 while visiting for the funeral of King Edward VII.

(Imperial War Museum Q81794)\n\n10 THE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nwith its loyalty ﬁrmly focused on the emperor, was a particularly important supranational institution in an empire in which less than 24 per cent of the population was German.26 A comparison of the maps of Europe in 1848, 1871 and 1914 forcefully illustrates the power of nationalism. Before 1850, only Greece, in 1827, and Belgium, in 1831, had joined long-established nation-states such as France, Portugal and Spain. Imperial Germany and Italy were uniﬁed after a fashion in 1871. New states were carved out of the crumbling Ottoman Empire such as Romania in 1877, Bulgaria and Serbia in 1878, and Albania in 1912. Norway also split from Sweden in 1905. European nationalism as a whole was also intimately connected with imperial expansion in the last two decades of the nineteenth century as the powers rushed to partition Africa and to divide the decaying Manchu Empire in China into exclusive spheres of inﬂuence.27 Indeed, only Liberia and Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in Africa were not ruled by Europeans and, in Asia, only Afghanistan, Siam (Thailand), Tibet and Japan were independent of European control. Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Portugal all had overseas possessions. The United States, too, had begun to extend its inﬂuence overseas as a consequence of the Spanish–American War of 1898. By contrast, Tsarist Russia and AustriaHungary were great continental empires, while Germany’s failure to secure what many Germans regarded as an overseas empire commensurate with her European status fed imperial aspirations not only overseas but within Europe itself. This was perhaps epitomised by the ﬁrst words of the imperial anthem, Deutschland über Alles: ‘Von der Maas dis an die Memel, von der Etsch bis an den Belt’ (From the Meuse to the Niemen, from the Adige to the Belt). Of these rivers, only the Niemen was within German territory and only for its last few miles. National sentiment was stimulated by national celebration such as that for the centenary of the defeat of Napoleon in Russia in 1912, the centenary of the battle of Leipzig in Germany in 1913, and the 700th anniversary of the battle of Bouvines in France in June 1914. In some respects, nationalism had still to run its course and could therefore threaten the identity of the state, principally in the form of local separatism, as in the case of Ireland within the British Empire and in parts of the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire. Some states maintained irredentist claims to others, not least in the Balkans. Tsarist Russia was also beset by the problem of what might be termed internal nationalism, proclaiming pan-slavism abroad while practising ‘russiﬁcation’ at home,\n\n11\n\n12\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\naffecting such peoples as the Finns, Latvians, Armenians, Georgians, Estonians, Ukrainians and Belorussians. In Russia in particular, but elsewhere in Europe, internal nationalism was similarly evident in the increase in anti-semitism in the 1880s and 1890s fed by crudely racial theories such as those of Joseph-Arthur Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. The Dreyfus affair in France was one manifestation of the intensity which issues of national identity could evoke, again pointing to the capacity of European peoples for the kind of hatred which could be manipulated to sustain national war efforts. What, therefore, might be termed defensive nationalism would prove just as powerful as aggressive nationalism and imperialism in stimulating national sacriﬁce. In Germany, Ostjuden or eastern Jews bore the brunt of the popular view that they were Schnorrer und Verschwörer (cadgers and conspirators). Austria-Hungary, and especially Vienna, was rife with anti-semitism although, in the case of Hungary, anti-semitic political parties did not attract much support. More serious were the periodic pogroms of Russia’s 5 million Jews, conﬁned to the ‘Pale of Settlement’ in Poland and other parts of western Russia. Many Jews emigrated to Britain or the United States. Another potential solution, attuned to the wider ideals of the nation-state, was the concept of a Jewish national home, as espoused by Theodor Herzl’s polemic The Jewish State, published in 1896, and his foundation of the Zionist Congress at Basle in Switzerland in the following year.28 Nationalism was equally stirring among indigenous subjects of the European imperial powers. In India, a Hindu-based Indian National Congress had been formed as early as 1885 and major concessions were initiated by the British authorities in the Morley–Minto reforms of 1908. In the case of the white dominions of the British Empire, effective independence had been granted to Canada in 1867, Australia in 1901, New Zealand in 1907 and South Africa in 1910. Indeed, such was the independence of spirit evinced by the Canadian delegation at the 1911 Imperial Conference that the British government began to fear that the Canadians could not be relied upon to support Britain in any European conﬂict.29 Nationalism and imperialism enabled ruling elites to continue to exercise power through the manipulation of their popular appeal but, to the occasional uncertainties manifested in nationalism, might be added the threat which ruling elites still perceived in those political parties and interest groups attempting to exploit wider franchises and growing press freedom. Literacy, social awareness and urbanisation exposed the population to manipulation through the oral and written word by opposition, both\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nparliamentary and extra-parliamentary, as well as by government. In this process, the evolution of a mass circulation press was of some signiﬁcance. Lord Northcliffe’s Daily Mail, launched in Britain in May 1896, for example, reached a circulation of close to 2 million by 1908. On the continent, the Berliner Margenpost had a circulation of half a million by 1900 and Le Petit Parisien some 1.5 million. There were over 800 daily newspapers in Russia and over 3,000 in France. It is a matter of debate how far the press moulded rather than followed popular opinion. One radical contemporary, J. A. Hobson, believed the press one means by which public opinion and public policy were moulded by the ‘industrial and ﬁnancial forces of Imperialism’. Another, Norman Angell, who feared the impact of any war on the global economy, believed that vested interests could not create public sentiment, but merely exploit existing sentiment.30 In any case, as yet, the inﬂuence of political ideologies other than nationalism was weak in Europe so that there was no coherent challenge to the power of the state. Socialism, communism, anarchism and fascism all had their roots in the mid-nineteenth century. They were notably unsuccessful in political terms, however, prior to 1914. Violent anarchism had certainly had an impact in Russia, Italy and Spain. A number of prominent individuals had fallen victim to assassination (though this was not always the work of anarchists), including Tsar Alexander II in 1881, the Spanish prime minister Canovas del Castillo in 1897, Empress Elizabeth of Austria-Hungary in 1898, King Humbert I of Italy in 1900, and the chairman of the Council of Ministers in Russia, Pyotr Arcadievich Stolypin, in 1911. In Russia, revolutionary violence resulted in 9,000 casualties between 1905 and 1907 and in 17,000 over the period from 1905 to 1910. Yet, the existing European political order remained strong and development of the European labour movement had occurred primarily in the economic sense. Outside of Scandinavia, social democratic parties had achieved relatively little, although the extension of the franchise ensured that socialist parties were rapidly growing in electoral strength. In April 1914, the socialist, René Viviani, formed a government after the French national elections, while the German SPD had become the largest party in the Reichstag by securing 34.7 per cent of the vote in the 1912 elections. However, the SPD was effectively neutralised by the electoral system pertaining in Imperial Germany’s constituent states, which had narrower franchises and which held the real power. Certainly, there was a sense of international solidarity between socialist movements in different European states but, like much else, the\n\n13\n\n14\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nsupposed solidarity of the Second International, the Workingmen’s Association established by socialists in Paris in 1889 following the collapse of the ﬁrst in 1876, was to be swept away by the appeal of patriotism in 1914. Indeed, even the powerful French anarcho-syndicalist trade union movement, the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT; General Labour Confederation), which had an unambiguously paciﬁst outlook, succumbed to the appeal for national political and social unity expressed by the Union Sacrée (Sacred Union), much as the German trade unions succumbed to the appeal of the similar Burgfrieden (fortress truce). Indeed, Marx had approved of ‘progressive’ wars and both German and Russian socialists were to see war against the other in just such a light. The British labour movement was largely indifferent to international affairs. Like the ILP leader Keir Hardie, the French socialist leader Jean Jaurès had always believed that international socialism could only succeed in preventing a war through strike action in a pre-war diplomatic crisis. In the event, Jaurès indicated his general support for the French government in the July Crisis, although he was still assassinated by a nationalist on 31 July 1914.31 There is a natural tendency to see the appeal of militarism rather more strongly than that of internationalism in the pre-war world and, certainly, many European societies were militarised to a greater or lesser degree. In Britain, the pressure for continental-style conscription increased as Britain’s political isolation became more apparent and as her position in relation to the other major powers came under threat. By 1900, Britain had already been outstripped by both Germany and the United States in terms of industrial production in areas such as coal, pig-iron and steel. Britain’s claim to economic superiority rested more on ﬁnancial capital, shipping and primary products than upon manufactured goods, new technology or new industries such as petrochemicals and precision engineering. Moreover, Europe generally, despite its overall increasing industrial production and the development of new industries such as chemicals in Germany, was still losing economic ground to the United States. Thus, in 1913, energy consumption in the United States, as measured in millions of tonnes of coal equivalent, was approximately equal to that of Britain, Germany, France, Russia and Austria-Hungary together.32 Europe retained primacy in investment overseas, amounting to £350 million a year between 1900 and 1913. In terms of ﬁnancial primacy, Britain was still the most signiﬁcant of the great powers, with over 43 per cent of the world’s foreign investments in 1913. Yet, British ﬁnancial primacy and the Empire could not compensate for long-term decline and\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nBritain could no longer out-build naval opponents with her former ease or realistically match continental states where numbers secured by conscription were the yardstick of military power. In 1902, the journalist W. T. Stead, who was to be lost with the Titanic, published a popular polemic, The Americanisation of the World, predicting the future global power of the United States. With more precision, the geographer, Sir Halford Mackinder, in a lecture to the Royal Geographical Society on 25 January 1904, announced the dawning of a new era. According to Mackinder, a correlation between ‘the larger geographical and the larger historical generalisations’ would result in the decline of maritime power and the emergence of a Eurasian strategic pivot or ‘heartland’ based on size and numbers as the determinant of international development.33 The shock of early defeats in the South African War resulted in an increasing concern in Britain with the physical and moral condition of the nation. This fuelled such movements as the National Social Purity Crusade and the National Service League, which campaigned for conscription. Concerns with eugenics and ‘national efﬁciency’ coincided with the social investigations of Booth and Rowntree mentioned earlier, the latter in particular equating poverty in York with diminished physical efﬁciency. The same essentially military concept of poverty was also adopted by A. L. Bowley when he surveyed urban poverty in Reading, Northampton, Warrington, Stanley and Bolton between 1912 and 1914. The trend towards the quasi-military organisation of British youth was continued with the creation of the Boy Scouts in 1907, while military drill was widely accepted as the most appropriate form of physical education in schools. Beyond the schoolroom and adolescence, popular writers such as G. A. Henty and H. Rider Haggard, the popular press, popular entertainment such as the music hall and the infant cinema all did similar service in transmitting nationalist themes. As in the rest of Europe, popular culture was redolent with the assumptions of Social Darwinism as popularised by Benjamin Kidd’s Social Evolution, published in 1893. Yet, militarism in Britain existed, to quote Michael Howard, only in ‘mild solution’.34 While the fact that war did break out in Europe in 1914 against such a background cannot be ignored, those factors which suggest that war was not inevitable should not be readily dismissed. There was a paciﬁst movement in Britain as elsewhere, albeit it in fragmented state. While arguably aimed more at a German audience than a British, Norman Angell’s paciﬁst tract The Great Illusion, published in 1910, was just as popular\n\n15\n\n16\n\nTHE GREAT WAR 1914–1918\n\nwith the British reading public as G. F. Wyatt’s militaristic God’s Test by War, published in 1912. In Germany, membership of radical nationalist groups such as the Army and Navy Leagues was not extensive and the SPD had won the 1912 elections largely on a platform of opposing increased military expenditure.35 International co-operation and international organisations characterised banking, transportation and communication. As John Keegan has pointed out, European, if not international, tourism was also well established among the wealthier classes. International conferences on the limitation of war held at The Hague in 1901 and 1907 had not resulted in much tangible progress, an international court of arbitration being established, but it was used by governments only when it suited them to do so. On the other hand, the Olympic Games had been revived by Baron Pierre de Coubertin in 1896, although even they soon took on the guise of national rivalries rather than peaceful sporting occasions promoting international harmony. Other sports were also taking on an international aspect. The Fédération Internationale de Football Associations (FIFA), for example, was founded in Paris in May 1904: curiously, Glasgow Celtic played Burnley before a crowd of 20,000 in an exhibition match in Budapest in May 1914.36 Religious belief, too, remained strong in much of Europe, especially in rural areas, despite the enforced separation of Church and state in Italy after uniﬁcation and in France in 1905, and the state-sponsored anti-clericalism represented by the Kulturkampf (cultural struggle) initiated by the German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in Imperial Germany in the 1870s. Indeed, religious conﬂict between Catholic and Protestant remained a signiﬁcant and volatile factor in German politics.37 Europe in 1914, therefore, presents a number of contrasts between the effects of industrialisation and urbanisation on the one hand, and the persistence of an older economic system on the other. Increasing wealth existed alongside abject poverty. Similarly, the apparent emergence of mass democracy contrasted, in most cases, with the realities of continuing governance by traditional power elites. A general fatalism arising from the conditions of everyday existence, together with the ability of those elites to manipulate much of the population through the appeal of nationalism, when coupled with the growth of the power of the nation-state itself, meant that Europe and its peoples were largely conditioned in advance to sustain even a war that would be waged on an unimaginable scale. Even given the undoubted acceptance of, or at least acquiescence in, war in 1914 by Europe’s peoples, it should be remembered that, while a\n\nANOTHER COUNTRY?\n\nstate could not wage war without a degree of popular support, the crucial decisions in every belligerent state in 1914 were taken by very small groups of policy-makers: effectively four in Russia, ﬁve in Germany, six in Austria-Hungary and, arguably, only three in Britain.38 If anything, these men revelled in their detachment from the inﬂuence of ‘the people’. In Britain, politicians regularly professed to recognise the signiﬁcance of public opinion, not least in matters of war and peace. Yet, the Foreign Secretary between 1906 and 1916, Sir Edward Grey, felt little need to cultivate press or public, later writing that many of the shortcomings of democratic government were ‘due to the fact that public opinion is not necessarily a great statesman at all’.39 What James Joll has characterised as the underlying ‘unspoken assumptions’ of 1914 will need to be addressed again but, in turning to the causes of the war, the irony should be borne in mind that the handful of largely patrician and self-consciously detached policy-makers whose views mattered in July and August 1914 considered themselves in no way bound by their perceptions of the prevailing public opinion they had so often manipulated.\n\nNotes and references 1 Winston S.

Assisted by an increasing guilt on the part of the Entente and by the conclusions of the American revisionists Harry Barnes and Sidney Fay, who believed US interests had not been served by entry to the war, a consensus emerged by the late 1930s that, in the words of David Lloyd George, all the great powers had ‘slithered over the brink into the boiling cauldron of war’.3 The new revisionism was challenged by others such as Pierre Renouvin, Bernadotte Schmitt and, especially, Luigi Albertini, whose work became available in English translation in the 1950s.4 Yet, surprisingly, the concept of equal responsibility and miscalculation even survived the German role in beginning a Second World War.
