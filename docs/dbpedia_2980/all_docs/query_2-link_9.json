        "text": "Australian rules footballer\n\nAustralian rules footballer\n\nJoseph Rupert Balfe (9 March 1890 – 25 April 1915) was an Australian rules footballer and soldier who was killed during the landing at Anzac Cove.[1][note 1]\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe son of Matthew Balfe (later mayor of Brunswick) and Sarah Knott, Rupert Balfe was born in Brunswick in 1890. Balfe attended Princes Hill State School before earning a scholarship to attend Thomas Palmer's University High School, in Grattan Street, Carlton.[2]\n\nAfter completing his secondary education in 1908, he studied medicine at the University of Melbourne and was in his final year when he enlisted to serve in World War I.[3]\n\nThe true athlete\n\n[edit]\n\nBalfe played football for Brunswick whilst starring in athletics at University High. He played in the 1908 VFA Grand Final for Brunswick against Footscray, along with his two brothers, Harold (whose arm was broken) and Stan. When at Melbourne University, he played for the VFL side University, but due to his studies he played a limited number of games. He played one game in the 1909 season and 6 more games during the 1911 season.\n\nBalfe was a notable athlete, especially in field athletics. He was a state High School champion in athletics, winning the 100, 200 and 440 yards, long jump, high jump and 120 yards hurdles. In 1913 he was runner-up in the long jump at the Victorian athletic championships.[4]\n\nWorld War I\n\n[edit]\n\nBalfe enlisted on 2 September 1914 as a Second Lieutenant with the 6th Battalion in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). He was killed by a bursting shell whilst landing at Gallipoli, Ottoman Turkey, at the age of 25.[5] He was one of many players from the VFL during World War I who lost their lives.[6]\n\nFriendship with Menzies\n\n[edit]\n\nBalfe had a strong friendship with Robert Menzies, who was studying law at Melbourne University. Menzies went on to become the Prime Minister of Australia from 1939 to 1941, 1949–1966. Menzies wrote a poem for the late Balfe which appeared in several local newspapers on 16 July 1915.\n\nIn Memoriam Lieut. J. R. Balfe, Killed in Action, Gallipoli, July 1915[7]\n\nHis was the call that came from far away –\n\nAn Empire's message flashing o'er the sea –\n\nThe call to arms! The blood of chivalry\n\nPulsed quicker in his veins; he could not stay!\n\nLet others wait; for him the glorious day\n\nOf tyrants humbled and a world set free\n\nHad dawned in clouds and thunder; with a glee\n\nBorn not of insensate madness for the fray,\n\nBut rather of a spirit noble, brave,\n\nAnd kindled by a heart that wept at wrong,\n\nHe went. The storms of battle round him rave\n\nAnd screaming fury o'er him chants its song,\n\nSleep, gallant soul! Though gone thy living breath,\n\nThou liv'st for aye, for thou has conquered death!\"\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Australian military personnel killed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915\n\nList of Victorian Football League players who died on active service\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
