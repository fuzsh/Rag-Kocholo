        "text": "Carlton and St Kilda will honour the spirit of the ANZACs when they battle it out in a Round 4 clash in Wellington on Saturday.\n\nA special tribute will be paid to past players Fen McDonald and Claude Crowl, with the player judged best on ground in Saturday’s match to be awarded the Crowl McDonald medal. The award will be judged by members of the media.\n\nMcDonald and Crowl share a unique bond. In Round 15, 1911 they both ran out for the first time at Princes Park, making their VFL debut against each other when Carlton took on St Kilda.\n\nMcDonald went on to play 10 games for Carlton, and later a solitary match for Melbourne, while Crowl ran out three times for the Saints.\n\nLater both men, McDonald then aged 23 and Crowl 22, would set out for Turkey, where they lost their lives in the Gallipoli landings on 25 April, 1915. They’re among 17 VFL players to have been killed in the Gallipoli campaign, six of them on ANZAC Day.\n\nThe Round 4 clash between Carlton and St Kilda in Wellington is the first of four AFL matches to be played this ANZAC Day. It will mark 100 years to the day since McDonald and Crowl made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, with their spirit, courage and bravery to be remembered through the Crowl McDonald medal. Lest we forget."
