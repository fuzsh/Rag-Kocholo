Here for the taking are tales of high adventure and low intrigue from masters of the genre like John Buchan and Robert Louis Stevenson, classics of crime and detection from veteran thriller writers like Edgar Wallace and Arthur Conan Doyle, spine-chillers from the pens of Ambrose Bierce and other purveyors of suspense and horror, and true accounts of courage and survival from heroic and intrepid individuals caught up in the rigours and insanity of war or battling against the elements on gruelling expeditions of discovery and exploration. Between the covers of this crowded volume, Wordsworth Editions has assembled from the work of famous, less well-known and totally unsung writers a treasure trove of rattling good yarns to fire the imagination, chill the blood and perhaps awaken (or reawaken) the spirit of adventure in any reader who dares to plunge in!\n\nseverance\n\nGuns & Lingerie\n\nPosts: 287\n\nPost by severance on\n\nThanks for inputting Gripping Yarns, Dem, it's one I've got but, due to it weighing a bloody ton, haven't managed to pick it off the floor since I bought it\n\nI'll do the honours for you for the equally impressive, and weighty, Wordsworth Book of Horror Stories then:\n\n* Aylmer Vance and the Vampire by A. and C.
