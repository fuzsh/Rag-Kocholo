Plot summary

A brilliant research psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Venner, is driven out of Budapest by another researcher who has taken false credit for Venner's work. After going to London, Dr. Venner is offered a job in a Scottish sanitarium where he can continue his research on dementia precox, a disease from which his father had suffered.

Mary Murray, a pretty young doctor, becomes his laboratory assistant. They fall in love, though she has plans to go to China to engage in medical missionary work in a year's time. Paul convinces her to remain with him, and the two become betrothed. A fire breaks out in the lab and Mary tragically dies in an effort to salvage Paul's valuable records. The deeply distressed doctor turns down several posts at prestigious universities in order to realize Mary's dream of helping the sick in China.
