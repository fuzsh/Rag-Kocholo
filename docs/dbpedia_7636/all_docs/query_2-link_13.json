Country United States Language English IMDb profile\n\nShining Victory (known as Winged Victory in the U.S.) is a 1941 film based on the play, Jupiter Laughs, by A. J. Cronin. It stars James Stephenson, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Donald Crisp, and Barbara O'Neil, and it was the first film directed by Irving Rapper. Bette Davis makes a brief appearance as a nurse in the film.\n\nPlot summary\n\nA brilliant research psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Venner, is driven out of Budapest by another researcher who has taken false credit for Venner's work. After going to London, Dr. Venner is offered a job in a Scottish sanitarium where he can continue his research on dementia precox, a disease from which his father had suffered.\n\nMary Murray, a pretty young doctor, becomes his laboratory assistant. They fall in love, though she has plans to go to China to engage in medical missionary work in a year's time. Paul convinces her to remain with him, and the two become betrothed. A fire breaks out in the lab and Mary tragically dies in an effort to salvage Paul's valuable records. The deeply distressed doctor turns down several posts at prestigious universities in order to realize Mary's dream of helping the sick in China.\n\nCast\n\nJames Stephenson as Dr. Paul Venner\n\nGeraldine Fitzgerald as Dr. Mary Murray\n\nDonald Crisp as Dr. Drewett\n\nBarbara O'Neil as Miss Leeming\n\nMontagu Love as Dr. Blake\n\nSig Ruman as Professor Herman Von Reiter\n\nGeorge Huntley, Jr. as Dr. Thornton\n\nRichard Ainley as Dr. Hale\n\nBruce Lester as Dr. Bentley\n\nLeonard Mudie as Mr. Foster\n\nDoris Lloyd as Mrs. Foster\n\nFrank Reicher as Dr. Esterhazy\n\nHermine Sterler as Miss Hoffman\n\nBilly Bevan as Chivers\n\nClare Verdera as Miss Dennis\n\nCrauford Kent as Dr. Corliss\n\nAlec Craig as the jeweler\n\nLouise Brien as a nurse\n\nBette Davis as a nurse"
