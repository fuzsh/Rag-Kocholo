        "text": "The Aspen Indigenous Foundation (AIF) hosted the Fifth Annual Shining Mountains Film Festival (SMFF) at the Wheeler Opera House in December. To reach more downvalley viewers, three select films will screen at 6:30pm on April 3 at The Arts Campus at Willits (TACAW).\n\n“The mission of the foundation is to increase the awareness in the Roaring Fork Valley of the Indigenous presence, history and wisdom through cultural programs and community education,” Deanne Vitrac-Kessler, the founder and executive director of AIF, told The Sopris Sun.\n\nAIF gives back what it can to address the severe lack of resources on reservations. In fact, some of the proceeds from the event at TACAW will help fund a Victory Ride — a four day ride on horseback where youth of the Lakota Nation will follow in the footsteps of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull to the battlefield of the Little Bighorn.\n\nThe full-length feature film of the evening, “Aitamaako’tamisskapi Natosi: Before the Sun,” is about a young Blackfoot woman, Logan Red Crow, who competes in a thrilling and dangerous bareback horse race. She is one of only a few women to participate.\n\nRed Crow plans to join via Zoom following the film for a Q&A.\n\n“Mylo,” one of the two short films, was shot on the Navajo (Dine)\n\nReservation. Mylo Fowler is a Navajo man and photographer “who goes in the wild and takes beautiful films of the natural beauty and scenery and wild horses,” summarized Vitrac-Kessler.\n\n‘Healing of the Dragonfly’\n\nVitrac-Kessler helped produce the other short film, “Healing of the Dragonfly,” about an Oglala Lakota man named Joe Pulliam, a ledger artist and a warrior. The Sopris Sun had the chance to speak with Pulliam ahead of the screenings at TACAW, which he plans to attend.\n\nHe currently lives in Rapid City, South Dakota but spent most of his life on the Pine Ridge Reservation. However, until 10-years-old, he lived in St. Paul, Minnesota, as his parents were relocated as a result of the Bureau of Indian Affairs’ 1956 American Indian Urban Relocation program.\n\nHe joined the army at 18 and then went to art school before returning to the reservation to work as a graphic designer. At some point, he became addicted to alcohol, which took a heavy toll. This year, he will be seven years sober.\n\n“It’s my sobriety that has really opened doors for me and given me a second chance at life, and also in reclaiming my culture and reclaiming my language,” Pulliam stated.\n\nHe explained the origins of ledger art.\n\n“Ledger art originated with the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers who fought the United States army at Julesburg, Colorado in 1862. They captured the army’s ledger book … Over the years, 13 different Dog Soldier warrior artists did 100 drawings in that ledger book depicting combat scenes and other societal events and ceremonies.”\n\nSitting Bull himself was commissioned to draw ledger art, several pieces of which are in the Smithsonian today. “This medium was very integral in preserving a lot of our history and culture,” Pulliam stated.\n\nHe continues the tradition, documenting current and historical events, and often will use documents associated with mining or railroad companies that are at war with the earth.\n\nHe spoke to the struggle of Native Americans in preserving their culture after centuries of forced assimilation. Growing up, his parents were punished for speaking their language and he was highly discouraged. The reservations were created as prisoner of war camps, he pointed out. “They were never intended to develop economies or house healthy lifestyles or livelihoods.”\n\nStill, “We all have higher hopes for our society to develop an economy, to develop an infrastructure and to develop a quality of life, so that we can partake in the American dream.”\n\n“We’re using ledger art to bring awareness to social issues and historical injustices … It’s like the warrior’s new weapon in this ongoing battle, in this gigantic war.”\n\nWhen asked if there was anything else he would like to add, Pulliam simply stated, “That I am Ogalala Lakota, from the Pine Ridge Reservation and my Lakota name is Akicita Tokahe [The Leading Warrior into Battle].”\n\n“I want to use art to help heal my people,” he concluded."
