        "text": "In our latest episode of Weekend Watchlist, we summarized the buzziest upcoming summer blockbusters, such as MaXXXine and Twisters. But Watchlist This! is for a slightly different crowd, one that looks out for the independent hidden gems that may not have a Furiosa-sized budget. For the new recruits to our monthly column, the gist is this: our team scours Letterboxd reviews and film festivals to outline their favorite bubbling-under films, helping to give them a leg up to your watchlists.\n\nMay’s edition includes a handful of Western-set stories, spanning from a group of young rappers in Texas to a darkly comic diner crime in Arizona to a transformative horror story in Oregon. From the Pacific Northwest, we head east to New Jersey for a peek into a real-life secondhand record store, then even farther to Lithuania for an acclaimed romantic drama revolving around the underexplored topic of asexual intimacy.\n\nThis month’s picks come from John Forde, Leo Koziol, Jack Moulton, Katie Rife and Mia Lee Vicino. Enjoy!\n\nThe Last Stop in Yuma County\n\nWhat can a meek knife salesman, two bank robbers on the run, a nosy elderly couple and a pair of young outlaws have in common? That’s right. They all ran outta gas passing through Arizona miles from nowhere, and the next fuel truck won’t be stopping by for another hour. That’s the setup for Francis Galluppi’s darkly comic debut feature, The Last Stop in Yuma County, a tense (mostly) one-location thriller set in (mostly) real-time, which brings this eclectic group to convene in a remote diner before all hell breaks loose. And for what? As Fargo’s Marge Gunderson would ask—all for a little bit of money?\n\nDripping with cinematic atmosphere from Mac Fisken’s stylish cinematography and Matthew Compton’s score, the film is both “a fine argument for electric cars” and a classic calling card that’s already netted Galluppi a Hollywood gig for the Evil Dead franchise. Rob admits that the film “doesn’t reinvent the wheel for crime-thriller-black-comedy hybrids and wears its influences on its sleeve, but [it’s] just so damn assured of itself and what it’s trying to do.” No matter how familiar its Americana beats are (complete with mentions of Badlands and Psycho), the film stays engaging and light on its feet, patiently setting up a dozen Chekhov’s guns all synchronized to blast. Ain’t nobody safe.\n\nThe true delight of the film is its taste in character actors (Gene Jones and Robin Bartlett feel like they just dropped in from their iconic Coen brothers roles), from the terrifying aura of Richard Brake to the steely confidence of Jocelin Donahue to the nervous energy of Letterboxd’s own power-user Jim Cummings. It was the traditional nature of Galluppi’s Hitchcockian script that sold Cummings on a leading role opportunity where he gets to freak out and break bad, as well as a bonding session with the director all about South Park. “I think cinephiles are really gonna love [The Last Stop in Yuma County] because it’s definitely in the tradition of many lovable neo-noir and neo-Western movies,” Cummings tells us. That’s desert power. JM\n\nFlipside\n\nIn 2000, filmmaker Chris Wilcha scored a hit with The Target Shoots First, a subversive documentary about life inside Columbia House Records. Quickly earning comparisons to Michael Moore, the director seemed poised to be the new voice of Generation X, ready to skewer corporate America.\n\nWilcha’s latest film, Flipside, is both a tribute and an epitaph to his youthful angst. Drawing from a trove of home videos, he chronicles working with Judd Apatow and a three-year stint directing cult radio series This American Life before moving into TV commercials. As the years pass, he realizes he’s sold out to the corporate machine, with a shelf-load of unfinished documentaries to prove it.\n\nNarratives like Wilcha’s can often feel like self-indulgent exercises in white male privilege. Happily, he sidesteps his own ego by revisiting the subjects of his discarded projects, viewing them through older (and possibly wiser) eyes. His chief focus is Flip-Side Records & Tapes, a secondhand vinyl store in his New Jersey hometown. Once the epicenter of grunge cool, the store is a deserted junkyard when Wilcha finds it, and customers flock to the shiny new hipster boutique down the road.\n\nIs it better to hang onto old treasures, or accept the passage of time and move on? Wilcha explores this idea via interviews with NYPD Blue and Deadwood creator David Milch and the great jazz photographer Herman Leonard—87 at the time of filming and preparing a final gallery show before his death. “There will always be circumstances,” Leonard says, that frustrate artistic fulfillment. Flipside demonstrates both the importance of seizing the day and the wisdom of accepting the imperfect life you have.\n\nRobert compares Flipside to “a perfect, wondrous B-side collection… filled with the ideas you wished had become singles,” while Bhangatk calls it “a sweet and honest little meditation on the wonder and challenges of a passionate and creative life.” JF\n\nNew Life\n\nNew Life, which we covered in our 2023 Best of Fantasia International Film Festival piece, is a film that benefits from knowing as little as possible going in, so let’s just set the scene. Jessica (Hayley Erin) is traveling across the Pacific Northwest on foot, staying out of sight on her way to the Canadian border. She’s got a black eye and an engagement ring on her finger; as a result, a series of kind strangers assume she’s fleeing an abusive relationship, but Jessica is hiding—and in denial of—a much deeper secret. That’s where Elsa (Sonya Walger), a “fixer” for a shadowy agency, comes in.\n\nThe cat-and-mouse game implied by that premise does indeed play out. But then this “contemplative but tight thriller,” as Halstead describes it, “goes genre in the back half in ways that should have been obvious but never were.” New Life transforms from one type of movie into another—and that’s all we’ll say, except that it finds a fresh angle on a subgenre that’s been done to death (pun intended). “It was a [definite] surprise and a pretty genius way to do one of these movies,” LEATH3RFACE notes, and the blend of character-driven drama and goopy body horror produces “genre cinema at its most timely, intimate and emotionally intelligent,” according to Andrew.\n\nSlow\n\nMore than a year after winning the 2023 Sundance award for Best Directing in the World Cinema—Dramatic category (and earning a spot in our Best of Sundance 2023 Journal roundup), Marija Kavtaradzė’s Slow is finally releasing in US theaters. The first Lithuanian feature to be shot on 16mm in approximately a decade, this textured romantic drama charts the budding relationship between Dovydas (Kęstutis Cicėnas), an asexual sign language interpreter, and Elena (Greta Grinevičiūtė), a dancer prone to casual hookups.\n\nTheir story is told through body language: the signing of hands, the flailing of limbs, the lacunae of silences and stares. Elena and Dovydas negotiate the terms of their sex lives (or lack thereof) with varying degrees of success. Can true intimacy transcend the carnal? For Dovydas, absolutely. For Elena, maybe not. Therein lies the rub.\n\nPaul attests that Slow “captures intimacy in its barest form. The result is something almost dreamlike. I was mesmerized by this couple and how they communicated their love for each other.” Meanwhile, Juan raves in a 4.5-star review that he “hadn’t felt this seen in the movies since Aftersun. I love how I can watch people talk for two hours, and listening to the things they say makes me cry, not because they make me sad, but because they make me feel understood.”\n\nCityGirl appreciates how Kavtaradzė’s sophomore film represents “two different rhythms, clashing together and trying to figure out how to compromise to beat as one,” as well as how it’s “very Lithuanian, in the best way possible. I have never felt this way about any Lithuanian film ever in my life. It evokes, for me, the brand-new possibility of what’s possible to create in my own country.” MLV\n\nLost Soulz\n\nKatherine Propper is an exciting new voice in indie cinema, and her feature directorial debut Lost Soulz has arrived to let the world know. The LA-born-and-raised Propper relocated to Austin for inspiration and education in the “Texas school” of filmmaking, and Lost Soulz merges both fictional and non-fictional worlds. Fictitious rapper Sol (Sauve Siddle) leaves everything behind and embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery, music and friendship with a very real collective of massively talented creatives. Propper first worked with Siddle on her debut short film Street Flame and brought together five more diverse young talents to form the fictional rap group that are at the heart of this road trip journey.\n\nNot your usual rise-up rap culture fable, the film mostly shies away from heavy dramatic themes (or consequences) allowing the audience to go along for the ride. Though the denouement finds Sol having to face his past and what he left behind, the heart of the story is the bright shining talent of its main character and the rap group—this is what will bring audiences to the noise."
