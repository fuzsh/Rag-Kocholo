After receiving cryptic fortunes at a Chinese restaurant, the two wake up the next day to discover that they have somehow switched bodies. Unable to switch back, they are forced to masquerade as one another until a solution can be found. In the process, they develop a new sense of respect and understanding for one another.\n\nAll seats $2. Tickets available at the door.\n\nView Event →\n\nNine and Numb Improv Auditions\n\nNine and Numb: Grand Forks will be holding auditions for our improv comedy troupe on Wednesday, August 28th at 7pm. Come dressed to move and play!\n\nIn almost two and a half decades, Nine and Numb has seen, by last count, over 135 players come and go. An amazing number when compared to our humble beginnings back in 2000 when nine college students got together and formed a comedy troupe in Grand Forks, ND in a tiny, one room bar in a building on the dark side of town that doesn't even exist anymore!\n\nIt started small with a handful of friends coming to cheer them on and over the weeks and months, word got out and the crowds grew so large that they had to move their now infamous Tuesday night show to the Scott Hansen's Comedy Gallery next door. In 2002, Nine and Numb moved to another venue, Sensations Nightclub, after the Westward Ho Entertainment Complex closed it's doors. There, the troupe experienced its first personnel turnover that led to the birth of the second generation of the team with six new players coming aboard. In 2004, Nine and Numb expanded to create its first satellite team 70 miles away in Fargo, ND that played at Courtney's Comedy Club and thus, for the first time, Nine and Numb was a multi-city phenomenon dominating the comedy scene up and down the North Dakota/Minnesota border for years to come.\n\n​\n\nIn 2005, Nine and Numb moved its base of operations to Tampa, FL and in 2008, with the dissolution of the Fargo and Grand Forks troupes, Nine and Numb took an extended break that would end up lasting for three long years.\n\n​\n\nIn March of 2011, Nine and Numb reformed at Carrollwood Players Theatre in Tampa and began the fourth generation of the troupe with an all new cast at its first show in May of that year. The troupe played a semi monthly show there for the next four years on the mainstage and in the theatre's Black Box space.\n\nIn October of 2014, Nine and Numb held auditions for an all new troupe in its hometown of Grand Forks, ND. For the first time in over a decade, Nine and Numb had returned to the city of its birth, playing at the Fire Hall Theatre for a monthly gig. The troupe's fifth generation had begun.\n\nIn March of 2016, the main troupe in Florida moved their show from Carrollwood Players to Dreamhouse Theatre, where it performed to regular sold out crowds and in the spring of 2024, Nine and Numb once again returned to Grand Forks with an all new team at the Empire Arts Center. For nearly 25 years, Nine and Numb has entertained audiences around the country and has played for thousands and thousands of people. Whether it's in a 2,000 seat auditorium, a 20,000 seat arena (Yup. We've done it!) or even an intimate, five table bar on a snowy night in the middle of nowhere, Nine and Numb has continued to bring Uncommon Comedy at the speed of thought!\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Empire Presents TBD - Live Music in the Black Box\n\nJoin Us for an Evening of Acoustic Harmony with TBD!\n\nHailing from Fargo, North Dakota, TBD is a talented trio featuring Tony, Bailey, and David.

There will be a reception with complimentary hors d’oeuvres and a cash bar.\n\nWhy is this project important? In 1980, The Arc of North Dakota and six brave families sued the State of North Dakota over the conditions at the state institutions and the care provided to their loved ones with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). As we approach the 45th anniversary of the Arc of North Dakota Lawsuit in 2025, we want to highlight the work done to better the lives of people with IDD, which paved the way for the systems and services that exist throughout our state today. By creating the special collection, The Arc will help educate and empower future generations to continue the work of advancing the rights of people with disabilities in our state.\n\nClick the button below to reserve your seat before September 1st.

Showcasing beautiful harmonies, multiple lead singers and virtuosic soloists, this 5th album from the folk/country cult favorites shows the band stepping out of their Marxist bluegrass band box to create poignant songs of personal and collective loss – many of which were written just a few blocks from where Minneapolis Police Department’s 3rd Precinct station was burned and abandoned following the murder of George Floyd.\n\nLiving just a few blocks from the 3rd Precinct, frontman Sumanth Gopinath (vocals, guitar) and his partner Beth Hartman (vocals, percussion) were filled with a particular anxiety and dread. “We went through a lot during the uprising itself, but we also feared repeat occurrences of violence at various points – like the November 2020 election, January 6, the inauguration and the Chauvin trial,” Gopinath says. “Moreover, family and friends died or nearly died from COVID-19. My retired colleague David Bernstein passed in March 2020, my aunt died in June 2020, and my uncle was in the hospital for months.”\n\nAlthough The Gated Community started tracking some of the album in 2019 and early 2020, an electrical failure (caused by the 2020 unrest) fried the studio’s primary and backup hard drives. Left with only a few tracks and a whole new whirlwind of emotions stirred up by the pandemic, George Floyd’s murder, subsequent protests and the rise of fascism in America, the band reworked old songs and arranged new ones written by Gopinath during the pandemic. “Not being able to make music with the other five band members during 2020, I began composing classical music again for the first time in 25 years,” Gopinath says. “I also continued to write songs for the band until we were finally able to do some very distanced outdoor rehearsals in fall of that year.”\n\nWith various health concerns among band members, they worked safely and slowly, rehearsing and recording the new tracks with John Miller at Future Condo Studio in Minneapolis. Mastered by Bruce Templeton at Microphonic Mastering, the album was finally done in 2022. Their most ambitious yet, it includes 13 originals with powerful lyrics and thoughtful arrangements. Although still marked by the playfulness that have won them such a loyal following, these songs have less punk urgency and more of the laid-back folk and country vibes of some of their songwriting heroes – from the Ralph Stanley-inspired a capella song “To the Sea Once More” (written for Kobe Dimock-Heisler, a young man of color on the autism spectrum who had just been murdered by police in Brooklyn Center, MN on Aug. 31, 2019) to the Terry Allen-esque “Mariia” (about the alleged Russian spy and current politician Maria Butina) to the Townes Van Zandt-sounding “Another Fire” (written following the nightly fires that erupted in South Minneapolis after George Floyd’s murder) to the beautiful simplicity of Gillian Welch exhibited in “The Life from My Eyes” (about domestic violence towards women). The album also features the heartfelt playing of the band’s recently retired fiddler Teresa Gowan.\n\nOnce thought of as a niche novelty outfit, The Gated Community show their evolution into a sophisticated band that mixes social commentary with emotionally rich songwriting. They are incredibly proud to bring this album into the world after the collective traumas of the past three years and are finding solace in playing together once more.\n\nTicket pricing: $15\n\nDoors open one hour prior to the show.\n\nNo refunds, exchanges or weather cancellations.\n\nWe are not affiliated with any secondary ticket markets.\n\nView Event →\n\nNine & Numb Improv\n\nUncommon comedy is back at the Empire!\n\nJoin Nine & Numb Grand Forks for an evening of improv comedy.

At the intersection of science, humor, and psychedelics comes \"A Better Trip,\" the latest work from Shane Mauss.\n\nOriginally a residency at AREA15 in Las Vegas–this hilariously heady event highlights Shane’s personal psychedelic experiences and examines the history, science, and culture of psychedelics. Accompanied by a vivid display of mind-blowing visuals and custom animations that back the entire performance, this one-of-a-kind show articulates the psychedelic experience.\n\nA bout Shane Mauss\n\nStand-up credits include: Kimmel, Showtime, Netflix, multiple Comedy Central appearances and five appearances on Conan. Noteable podcast appearances include : Duncan Trussell's Family Hour, WTF, Bertcast, Whiskey Ginger, and You Made it Weird, etc.\n\nA ward-winning comedian, science podcaster, and mental health advocate Shane Mauss relentlessly integrates his life, interests, and imagination into creating shows that go far beyond traditional stand-up.\n\nKnown for his uncanny description of psychedelic experiences, Shane’s Comedy Central \"Tales From The Trip\" videos have millions of views and his last SOLD-OUT tour (\"A Good Trip\") inspired the documentary \"Psychonautics: A Comic's Exploration of Psychedelics.\"\n\nA bout The Visuals\n\nMICHAEL STRAUSS is a VJ, digital artist, and event producer. Providing live visuals for legends in the psychedelic space, including Shpongle, Alex Grey, Desert Dwellers; Michael has crafted psychedelic audiovisual experiences and immersive environments for nearly 20 years.\n\nThe Vibe\n\nPart trip report, part Ted Talk, all comedy show… this 90 minute performance is a celebration of the psychedelic renaissance.\n\nFAQ\n\nIs prior experience with psychedelics necessary to enjoy the show?\n\nNo experience necessary! You don’t need to try psychedelics to enjoy the music and art that’s inspired by them. It does tend to work well as a primer for people who are curious about various psychedelics and how they work.\n\nWill you be on drugs while performing?\n\nNo. Although I come up with much of this material during experiences, there is nothing appealing about performing while tripping. Why do psychedelics and go to work? What a waste of psychedelics.\n\nAre you going to pass out psychedelics to everybody?\n\nUmm NO. Obviously. But if you come and support this kind of message, meet like-minded people at the show, and help keep the conversation going; maybe one day these outrageous drug laws will change.\n\nShould I come tripping?\n\nI’m not going to tell you how to live your life, but it’s not what the show was designed for. It’s not a Pink Floyd laser light show in a planetarium. Stand-up comedy generally requires more of an attention span and this show is much smarter and more informative than typical stand-up.\n\nWhat's your favorite part about the show?\n\nThe audience. Psychedelic audiences are always the best combination of friendly, smart, attentive, enthusiastic, and fun. And sometimes I get to see like-minded strangers make new friends at my shows. It’s a great community.\n\nView Event →\n\nTimebomb Pro Wrestling\n\nTimebomb Pro Wrestling returns to Grand Forks for Live Pro Wrestling at the Empire Arts Center on Thursday, June 20th!\n\nHigh flying and hard hitting action from all your favorite Timebomb Pro Superstars!\n\nThis event is All Ages - Doors open at 6PM.
