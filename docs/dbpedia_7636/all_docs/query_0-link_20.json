It follows two couples from Kibbutz Netzer Sirani, whose lives take dramatic turns post-war. At the heart is Neta Agmon, whose acting career takes off just as her husband comes back from the war, forever changed. While Neta’s star rises, she faces a personal battle at home, trying to reconnect with the man she once knew. Amidst a nation celebrating, they navigate the unseen aftermath of war and the challenge of keeping love alive. This story blends personal struggle with the vibrancy of a musical, offering a fresh and engaging take on the impact of war, the price of fame, and the power of love."
