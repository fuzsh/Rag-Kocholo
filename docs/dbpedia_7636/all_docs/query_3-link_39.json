        "text": "Liminal spaces. Those unsettling hallways of forgotten buildings, the echoing emptiness of abandoned amusement parks, the sterile perfection of deserted suburbs — these in-between places evoke a strange mix of nostalgia, loneliness, and unease.\n\nFilmmakers have harnessed this power for decades, using liminal spaces to create a chilling atmosphere, heighten suspense, and explore deeper themes. Let’s delve deeper into some iconic examples and how they utilize this unsettling concept.\n\nThe Overlook Hotel: A Labyrinth of Isolation in The Shining\n\nStanley Kubrick’s The Shining is a masterclass in using liminal spaces to create a chilling atmosphere. The Overlook Hotel, a once-grand establishment now succumbing to a slow decay, becomes a labyrinth of emptiness. Stretching hallways with high ceilings dwarf the characters, their patterned carpets and wallpaper becoming hypnotic and unsettling under the cold, artificial light.\n\nThe Gold Room: Imagine a grand ballroom frozen in time. Overturned furniture, remnants of a joyous celebration that abruptly ended. The echoing silence amplifies the emptiness, leaving the audience to imagine the horror that transpired in this once lively space. The Gold Room becomes a symbol of the hotel’s decaying past, a chilling reminder of the isolation that permeates the entire building.\n\nThe Overlook Hotel Hallways: These endless corridors, devoid of windows and natural light, create a suffocating sense of confinement. The characters navigate this maze-like structure, dwarfed by its immensity. The lack of escape routes visually emphasizes their isolation, contributing to the film’s overall sense of paranoia and dread.\n\nThe Hedge Maze: A quintessential liminal space, the hedge maze in The Shining embodies the concept of being lost in a seemingly endless labyrinth. Towering hedges block any sense of direction, disorienting both the characters and the audience. Jack Torrance’s pursuit of his son Danny through the maze becomes a metaphor for his own descent into madness — a desperate search for meaning within the confines of a world with no clear exit.\n\nVivarium: A Manufactured Nightmare\n\nThe unsettling premise of Vivarium is inherently liminal. A young couple finds themselves inexplicably trapped in a seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood. Identical houses with manicured lawns stretch into the distance, the artificiality of it all creating a profound sense of unease.\n\nThe Neighborhood: This fabricated community exists between the dream of a perfect suburban life and the harsh reality of the couple’s entrapment. The lack of people and the silence heighten the feeling of isolation, leaving them adrift in a world that feels both familiar and utterly alien.\n\nThe Houses: Step inside one of these identical houses and you’ll find sterile interiors, devoid of any personal touch. They become a symbol of conformity and control, a reminder of the manufactured nature of this world. There’s a feeling that everything is staged, nothing is real, and escape seems impossible.\n\nThe Endless Loop: As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the neighborhood loops in on itself. No matter which direction they go, the couple always ends up back at their starting point — number 9. This cyclical aspect reinforces the liminality of the space, emphasizing their powerlessness and hopelessness within this manufactured nightmare.\n\nThe Truman Show\n\nThe world Truman Burbank lives in takes the concept of a liminal space to the extreme. His idyllic town of Seahaven exists on a giant soundstage, completely fabricated for the Truman Show, a reality TV program. While the set design creates a familiar and comforting world, there’s always a nagging sense that something isn’t quite right.\n\nSeahaven: This meticulously crafted town is a liminal space in the truest sense. The bright colors, perfect weather, and friendly townsfolk all contribute to the artificiality. It’s a world designed to feel familiar, yet inherently fake.\n\nThe False Horizon: Look beyond the charming facades of Seahaven and you’ll see the painted sky — a constant reminder of the world’s constructed nature. It creates a barrier between Truman’s reality and the unknown truth that lies beyond.\n\nThe Edge of the Set: The edge of the dome surrounding Seahaven is another powerful liminal space. It represents the boundary between Truman’s manufactured world and the unknown truth that lies beyond. As Truman approaches this edge, the film’s suspense builds, leaving the audience to wonder if he will choose to confront the unknown and step out of his manufactured reality.\n\nKiller Klowns from Outer Space (1988)\n\nThis cult classic takes the familiar funhouse mirror maze, a quintessential liminal space, and injects it with an alien invasion twist. The distorted reflections and disorienting pathways become a terrifying trap for the characters.\n\nThe Carnival Setting: Carnival grounds themselves are inherently liminal spaces, existing between everyday life and a world of fantasy. Killer Klowns takes this up a notch by making the carnival a frightening place where the clowns are not friendly but rather hostile aliens.\n\nThe Funhouse Maze: This classic liminal space becomes even more unsettling with its distorted mirrors, dead ends, and creepy clown decorations. The characters lose their sense of direction and are vulnerable to the lurking alien clowns.\n\nDon’t Worry Darling (2022)\n\nThe idyllic town of Victory Project in Don’t Worry Darling is a liminal space. The perfectly designed houses, manicured lawns, and seemingly perfect residents create a sense of unease beneath the surface. It feels too good to be true, trapping the characters in a world that is both familiar and strangely unsettling.\n\nThe Planned Community: The Victory Project itself is a liminal space, a manufactured utopia devoid of individuality and spontaneity. The lack of imperfections and the eerily cheerful residents create a sense of something sinister lurking beneath the surface.\n\nThe Absence of Outsiders: The town’s isolation and lack of outsiders contribute to the liminality. The characters are trapped within the confines of Victory Project, with nowhere else to go and no one to question the strangeness of their world.\n\nBarbarian (2022)\n\nThis 2022 horror flick has a pretty much dark and sinister premise overall with darker colors and dull settings dominating the screen. However, with a sudden shift to a flashback scene, the color scheme of the shots completely transforms into oversaturated bright colors like the grass, the roofs on houses being a bright red, and each car a different pastel shade. While bright colors are usually supposed to lighten up the mood, in the context of the movie it feels almost unsettling. These colors coupled with the 50s style liminal white picket fence houses that all look alike, placed so close together and the neighbors being overjoyed for no apparent reason make the liminality of this particular scene from the movie quite creepy. No spoilers, but what is about to happen next gives even more context to the bright colors hiding something sinister.\n\nLiminal spaces have been used in film for decades, but these were just some of my favorites. What are yours?"
