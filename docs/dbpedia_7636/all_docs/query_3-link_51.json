        "text": "2012\n\nCity Locations\n\nIceland, Portree (Scotland), Wadi Rum Village (Jordan)\n\nLocation Types\n\nRiverside, Film Studio\n\nLocation Styles\n\nMountain Huts, Desert, Futuristic, Rustic\n\nAbout Prometheus\n\nPrometheus, a film launched in 2012 and directed by Ridley Scott, is an impressive entry in this category. The movie boasts a gifted ensemble of actors such as Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Logan Marshall-Green, and Idris Elba. The narrative revolves around the characters Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who traverse the cosmos on the spaceship Prometheus, seeking to uncover the genesis of human existence on Earth. Upon arriving at their destination, the crew of Prometheus discovers a series of awe-inspiring structures which contain a dark secret that could have grave consequences for all humanity. With the fate of humanity on the line, our heroes must choose between survival and sacrifice as they attempt to unravel this ancient mystery. The first thirty minutes of Prometheus serve as a shining beacon of contemporary science fiction. Its enigmatic opening sets the stage for the plot, with outstanding production values and thought-provoking concepts integrated into a narrative that encapsulates the spirit of discovery, making it easy to get completely absorbed in the enthralling proceedings. Prometheus garnered significant success, attaining both commercial victory and critical recognition. Its mesmerizing visual effects, along with the remarkable performances of its ensemble cast, were met with extensive acclaim. The film received numerous accolades, including nominations for Best Visual Effects at the Academy Awards.\n\nPrometheus Locations\n\nThe Prometheus production process took place in four locations worldwide, Iceland, Jordan, England, and Spain, to create visually stunning cinematic backdrops. In particular, Iceland provided the backdrop for most scenes, such as Dettifoss Waterfall and Mount Hekla. Dettifoss is a breathtakingly beautiful waterfall in the VatnajÃ¶kull National Park, while Mount Hekla is an active volcano with its unique scenery. Wadi Rum in Jordan provided a dramatic desert landscape. A trip to visit these locations would be highly worthwhile if you are a fan of Prometheus or just looking for a memorable experience. From walking through a scorching desert landscape to admiring natural wonders like waterfalls and volcanoes, these areas offer various captivating sights and experiences. Furthermore, many of these places also have history and culture attached to them, from Vikings residing near Dettifoss Waterfall to Lawrence of Arabia springing to life in Aqaba, making it even more rewarding to explore their surroundings.\n\nThe opening scene of The Engineer was a compelling start to the movie. As the camera pans over Iceland's breathtaking landscape, we eventually reach Dettifoss Waterfall, where a humanoid creature drinks from a mysterious black liquid and disintegrates into it. This moment stands out as one of the most iconic scenes in Prometheus and sets up the rest of the film. The Dettifoss waterfall in Northern Iceland, within VatnajÃ¶kull National Park, provided the backdrop for this scene. One of Europe's largest waterfalls by volume, Dettifoss has a width of 100 meters and an impressive 45-meter drop that creates a dramatic misty spray. It is an awe-inspiring sight and makes for an ideal film location for such a memorable scene. Suppose you're looking to explore this part of Iceland for yourself. In that case, there is a 20-mile hiking trail from Asbyrgi to Dettifoss, which follows along rocky coastlines, sandy beaches, and through forests and valleys before ending up at the waterfall. There is also a campsite in Vesturdalur, a few miles north of Dettifoss. However, be aware that some roads may be closed during winter months or bad weather conditions.\n\nIn the mesmerizing year 2089, amidst the enchanting Isle of Skye in Scotland, two daring archaeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), stumble upon an extraordinary revelation. Not only are they skilled professionals in their field, but they also share a deep romantic connection. They uncover a captivating star map within the depths of a mysterious cavern. This map is amidst the remnants of various disparate ancient societies. They construe this discovery as a beckoning from the precursors of human civilization. While filming on Earth, Elizabeth and Charlie unexpectedly uncover a breathtaking revelation beneath the mysterious Old Man of Storr rock formation on the Isle of Skye. The Old Man of Storr is a magnet for rock climbers, attracting thousands of visitors annually with its steep hike and captivating jagged rock formations. Perched on the Storr ridge, these cliffs tower over the glistening waters of Loch Leathan, creating a breathtaking sight that leaves a lasting impression. Visitors can get to this location by taking a ferry to Skye from Portree (the closest mainland port) or driving over from Glenelg via a causeway connecting Skye to the mainland. Once in Portree, take a car or public transportation to reach the Old Man of Storr. Tour companies also offer guided trips around areas like Storr Trail.\n\nThe spacecraft Prometheus navigates through the planet's atmosphere, experiencing disturbance that subsides once it penetrates the cloud layer, gaining surface visibility. The spaceship touches down close to an alien formation resembling a grand pyramid or temple. A crew comprising Shaw (Noomi Rapace), Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), and David (Michael Fassbender) sets out to investigate it, while Vickers and Captain Janek (Idris Elba) stay back on the ship, keeping tabs on their exploration. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the mission director, instructs them to avoid direct interaction and retreat if they encounter extraterrestrials. The expansive landscapes of the planet they find themselves on are Wadi Rum, also known as the Valley of the Moon, a valley carved into the sandstone and granite rock approximately 40 miles east of Aqaba in southern Jordan. Intriguingly, Wadi Rum served as the backdrop for the desert sequences in David Lean's 1962 masterpiece, Lawrence Of Arabia, the film David repeatedly watches as the crew slumbers through their extended voyage. Getting to Wadi Rum can be done by car or tour bus from Amman or Aqaba Airport in Jordan. There are plenty of guided tours available that will allow you to explore this fantastic landscape firsthand.\n\nThe harsh environment and its towering rock formations give it an eerie atmosphere. As they approach their destination, the explorers come upon a mysterious pyramid-shaped structure, which gives off an ancient energy that draws them towards it. Within this pyramid, they encounter a zone containing air fit for respiration. In a moist, dark room that David (Michael Fassbender) manages to open, they stumble upon hundreds of cylindrical relics, a colossal stone statue depicting a humanoid face, and the beheaded remains of a massive extraterrestrial being believed to be an Engineer. Additional corpses are discovered later within the structure, leading to the assumption that the species is likely extinct. Mount Hekla in Iceland, a famously active volcano in the south of the country, was the backdrop for the scene. The exterior shots feature this unique location with its volcanic wasteland surrounded by towering rock formations. At the same time, any more extravagant elements, such as âthe mysterious hollow pyramid,â were added digitally during post-production. To get to Mount Hekla in Iceland, get there quickly from Reykjavik or other major cities within Iceland. By car, the drive should take around 3 hours, depending on traffic. While public transport is a viable option, it often involves numerous transfers.\n\nPrometheus (2012) is an ambitious film that fuses elements of science fiction, horror, and existential questions. The visuals are stunning, and the idea of two mysterious DNA twins raises a fascinating puzzle about the origin of human life. The actors all gave great performances that helped bring the story to life. As David, the robotic crewmember, Michael Fassbender gives a particularly standout performance, imbuing his character with a complex mix of innocence and menace. The script is well-crafted and contains many deft touches. It does lean towards spectacle over terror at times, but it still manages to be engaging and thought-provoking. Overall, Prometheus is a memorable movie experience that will leave viewers with plenty to ponder long afterward. Prometheus helped revive interest in classic sci-fi through its intense visuals and complex storytelling. Its success encouraged other blockbuster filmmakers such as Christopher Nolan to explore more fantastical ideas on screen, laying the groundwork for films such as Interstellar (2014). In conclusion, Prometheus is worth watching for its excellent production values, powerful performances from the cast members, thought-provoking ideas about human existence, and beautiful visuals."
