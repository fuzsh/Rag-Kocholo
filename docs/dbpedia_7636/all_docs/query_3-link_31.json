        "text": "War Machine is not a good movie. That in itself is not a great offense to the order of the world. But as what is allegedly an opening shot in Netflix's attempt to offer the equivalent of mid-budget, star-driven and slightly prestigious Hollywood fare that the major studios have mostly stopped making, it is a fascinating miss. Not only is a bad movie, but it is a bad movie because it is a painfully uncinematic film. It is, concerning how it is constructed and how much it cost, the kind of film that would be a financial disaster in cinemas. That it ended up on Netflix is arguably a case of the streaming giant doing the theaters a favor.\n\nThe picture, directed by David Mich√¥d (Animal Kingdom), is loosely based on Michael Hastings's nonfiction book (The Operators) about the downfall of General Stanley McChrystal. For those who don't remember, he was fired in 2010 after Hastings' Rolling Stone feature story offered several choice quotes of McChrystal and his men badmouthing the Obama administration. The film is technically fiction, a choice made so that the filmmakers had more artistic freedom in telling their story, but a number of real folks and real incidents are discussed. But more disconcerting is that the big-budget picture is stunningly stagebound, offering two hours that mostly amount to men (almost all men) sitting in chairs having conversations with each other about how the Afghanistan occupation can be brought to an honorable and/or dignified end.\n\nThe film feels less like a movie than (at best) a glorified stage play and (at worst) a glorified audiobook of The Operators. There are moments of thoughtfulness and insight, but 90% of the interesting nuggets of wisdom are doled out by constant voice-over narration provided by Scoot McNairy's Sean Cullen, revealed in the flesh at the halfway point to be the film's stand-in for the late Hastings. The cast (Pitt, Michael Anthony Hall, Alan Ruck, Tilda Swinton, etc.) is polished and there are a few choice moments of scathing commentary. Pitt has a few choice moments (including explaining how killing insurgents leads to more insurgents), Ruck has a great monologue explaining why there won't be a victory parade at the end and Swinton's one-scene cameo involves a piercing bit of actual journalism.\n\nWatch On Forbes:\n\nBut War Machine ironically feels less like a full-blown theatrical movie and more like the stereotypical TV movie. For a motion picture, it barely moves. It's a talking head documentary acted out by a big cast, complete with an oddly hammy star turn from a usually solid Brad Pitt who seems to think he was in a Coen Brothers comedy.\n\nYes, it's a little anticlimactic that this film comes out now, 16 years after the start of the post-9/11 Middle East overseas adventures and six months after America more or less made their choice to ignore or forget the lessons of the George W. Bush era. It feels like the kind of film produced under the impression that it would be a piece of art to move a policy debate as President Hillary Clinton decided how to proceed with our current military campaigns. But in this timeline, under this president, I don't think there's much anyone can do short of an electoral revolution to move the needle away from \"never-ending faraway war against ever-changing enemies.\"\n\nThat in itself is not a fatal flaw or the fault of the movie itself. I felt the same way about Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk but still found that Ang Lee drama to be a fascinating piece of experimental cinema. Yet War Machine exists not as a shining example of Netflix stealing Hollywood's thunder but as an example of the kind of movie that would never have been a smart commercial play. It's not a good movie, it has no business being in theaters, and it was so expensive ($60 million) that it serves as an example of the sort of thing that almost killed adult cinema in the late 2000s.\n\nI'm speaking of that period when films like (the excellent) State of Play and (the splendid) Duplicity were failing to justify their $60 million-$70 million budgets and were being held up as evidence that the adult movie was dead. Sure, those films had big stars, adult-skewing stories and high production values, but they were priced to a point where they had to basically become glorified blockbusters to break even. When the likes of 3:10 to Yuma, Body of Lies or The Lovely Bones made $70m-$100m worldwide on $60m-$70m budgets, the blame didn't go to their budgets but rather the very idea that adult dramas and adult-skewing major studio fare were an endangered species.\n\nFortunately, things got a little better when the costs came down. Hollywood eventually got the message. Starting in late 2010, we began seeing Ben Affleck's The Town costing $40 million, Looper costing $30m, and (among others) the Oscar-nominated American Hustle earning $250m on a $40m budget. From around late 2010 to the end of 2014 (ish), we did see a reasonable return of the \"real\" movie from the studios. Sure, some of this was thanks to newbie distributors like Open Road Films, but we started seeing responsibly-budgeted pictures that didn't go crazy but made enough to justify their place in multiplexes alongside the tentpole/franchise offerings.\n\nGood or bad, you were just as likely to find The Social Network, Source Code, Savages, The Counselor, The Fault in Our Stars or The Hundred-Foot Journey at a theater near you as Tron: Legacy, Battle Los Angeles, The Amazing Spider-Man, Edge of Tomorrow or Expendables 3. The reason a lot of these films did well/made money was because they were budgeted at a level that didn't require blockbuster business. So The Counselor could be a modest hit earning $71 million on a $25m budget. And The Grey could be a winner at $77m on a $25m budget. For a few years, it looked like Hollywood as a whole might have dug itself out of its post-Harry Potter/Spider-Man/Pirates of the Caribbean-induced tentpole fever.\n\nI think that the blowout success of The Avengers (through no fault of Walt Disney or Joss Whedon or any of the participants) in the summer of 2012 did cause not a little bit of harm. Its $1.5 billion worldwide gross sent every studio chasing the multi-part/interconnected cinematic universe alongside their current franchise fare. And that coincided with the lightning-fast rise of streaming services like Netflix and cable TV offering a deluge of high-quality and water-cooler-friendly episodic fare that filled in the gap for moderately budgeted, star-driven, adult-focused comedy and drama.\n\nTelevision has been of a high quality (as art) for at least the last 25 years (The X-Files, The Simpsons, Homicide: Life on the Street, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, etc.). But the upswing in production values and spectacle alongside long-form storytelling and nuanced character development has left us with a TV landscape that can probably approximate 90% of all available theatrical feature content. So now, in the middle of 2017, the major studios are trying to figure out how to keep the money coming with old/rebooted franchises since it's so hard to get folks to come out to the theaters for anything new or non-tentpole-ish.\n\nIn such an environment, spending $60 million on a film like War Machine would be insane, and I don't remotely blame the interested parties who wanted to cut costs. Even during late 2011, an acclaimed and Oscar-nominated film like Moneyball made just $110m on a $50m budget. War Machine is an ambitious and well-intentioned picture that can't decide if it's Burn After Reading or Syriana, which would be an interesting quirk if the film weren't told so lifelessly and with so little cinematic flair.\n\nHad the picture been produced and distributed as-is by Warner Bros. or Sony, it would struggle to make anything approaching the $150 million-$200 million necessary to break even and would instead spur another round of \"Adult dramas are doomed!\" At Netflix, if it were good, it would merely be a victory for existing. But the movie as it plays more like an old-school TV movie. Netflix's first big foray into \"What Hollywood won't do anymore\" is a most ironic miss. It is not only not a good movie, but it's an exorbitantly overbudgeted movie that fails both as a piece of art and even as a piece of theater-worthy cinema.\n\nI agree with pretty much everything War Machine has to say. But there is little cinematic value in how it chooses to say it. And keeping it out of theaters and as a streaming offering helps, rather than hurts, the concept of a big-studio theatrical movie."
