        "text": "Black history is American history, but that fact hasn't always been celebrated in Hollywood. The history of film in America is equally as uncomfortable to study as the history of the United States. Historians point to American performer Thomas Dartmouth Rice's 1820s minstrel show \"Jump Jim Crow\" as one of the first native forms of American entertainment. Prior to Jim Crow being used in reference to segregation laws, Thomas, who was white, depicted the fictional Jim Crow as a disabled Black man. Thomas was one of the first performers to use blackface, a harmful practice in which white performers painted their faces black to dehumanize African Americans. Coming into the 20th century, racist entertainment was still front and center in American culture. The 1915 film Birth of a Nation, a blockbuster hit of the silent-film era, glorified the Ku Klux Klan and distorted the truth about the Reconstruction Era.\n\nWith the foundation of modern cinema being dependent on negative images of Blackness and Black people, harmful tropes and stereotypes continue to be popular in film. In 2015, the viral hashtag sparked conversations about the ongoing lack of representation in Hollywood and how far we still have yet to go as a nation. Despite challenges and setbacks, these 20 Black directors and filmmakers have found beauty in pain and have been able to use art to shift narratives and tell beautiful, nuanced stories. From Melvin Van Peebles to Spike Lee to Ava DuVernay, these Black leaders in the movie industry have and continue to make history."
