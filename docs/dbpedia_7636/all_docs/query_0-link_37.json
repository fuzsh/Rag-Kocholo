        "text": "Welcome to the official Film/Art Gallery collection of original Irving Rapper vintage movie posters from his critically acclaimed catalog of timeless cinematic contributions.\n\nRapper, Irving was an English-born film director. He was employed by Warner Bros as a dialogue coach and as an assistant director. He was extremely useful in translating and mediating for non-native English speaking directors. He was one of the hottest directors on the Warner Bros. lot.\n\nHis directorial debut was Shining Victory in 1941, a drama film based on the 1940 play The Jupiter Laughs by A.J Cronin. He followed the film with Now, Voyager in 1942, The Corn is Green in 1945, Deception in 1946, and Another Man's Poison in 1952, in which these 4 films starred Bette Davis.\n\nIn 1941, Rapper's movie One Foot in Heaven was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. His other film The Brave One in 1956 earned Dalton Trumbo an Oscar for his original screenplay, although it was a box office failure.\n\nRapper directed The Voice of the Turtle in 1947, a romantic comedy, The Glass Menagerie in 1950, an American drama film, Marjorie Morningstar in 1958, a melodrama romance film based on Herman Wouk Novel in 1995, and The Miracle, a remake of the film Miracle in 1912.\n\nHe also directed biographical films: The Adventures of Mark Twain in 1944, was nominated for 3 Academy Awards; Rhapsody in Blue in 1945, was nominated 2 Academy Awards, Music and and Best Sound and also nominated for the Grand Prize at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival; he co-directed Pontius Pilate in 1962; The Christine Jorgensen Story in 1970; and Born Again in 1978.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery's collection of original Irving Rapper movie posters include a First French (post-WW2) release poster for the classic 1942 Bette Davis film Now Voyager. Also included in the Irving Rapper poster collection is a 1 Sheet (27x41) of the campy biopic of the celebrated transsexual movie The Christine Jorgensen Story.\n\nFilm/Art Gallery movie posters are original prints and film poster collectibles. These are original movie posters. We do not carry any movie poster reproductions or reprints of any kind."
