        "text": "When one thinks of holiday movies, the first thing that springs to mind is most likely Christmas. With new releases every year at both the box office and on streaming services, as well as all those classic favorites we know and love, there’s no shortage of Christmas movies to add to your watch list.\n\nBut amid all that Yuletide cheer, other major holidays such as Thanksgiving shouldn’t be forgotten—and there are quite a few movies that align with “Turkey Day,” many of which can be an enjoyable addition to seasonal traditions.\n\nStacker looked at data from IMDb to rank the highest-rated Thanksgiving films of all time as of November 2023. To determine which movies would qualify, Stacker surveyed the history of film, comprehensive film databases, and legitimate editorial compilations of Thanksgiving movies.\n\nOnly feature films were considered (sorry, “A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving”), and each film had to have at least 2,500 IMDb user votes. Films are ranked by IMDb user ratings, with ties broken by the number of IMDb user votes.\n\nIt is important to recognize that genre is meant to help describe and communicate the vibe of a film, not to serve as a limiting factor on what films can and cannot be. There are no hard-and-fast rules that define a Thanksgiving movie, and leaning into more open interpretations of what fits in certain fringe genres is the best practice for developing a pool of films that represent all possible expressions of a particular subgenre. As a result, any movie that takes place over Thanksgiving or involves significant Thanksgiving scenes was taken into consideration to be part of this “best of” list.\n\nKeep reading to see if any of your favorite Thanksgiving-themed films made the list.\n\n#25. The Humans (2021)\n\n– Director: Stephen Karam\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.1\n\n– Metascore: 78\n\n– Runtime: 108 minutes\n\nStephen Karam adapted his own Tony-winning one-act play for this film, a psychological drama that centers around three family generations from Philadelphia meeting to celebrate Thanksgiving in the youngest daughter’s New York apartment—only to find, as the night draws on, that something strange might be happening in the apartment building. As the characters become more spooked and tensions build, each of them inches closer to desperation amid this strange and creepy atmosphere, leading them to reveal their biggest fears and secret elements of their personal lives to one another.\n\nWith a remarkable cast that includes Amy Schumer, Richard Jenkins, Steven Yeun, Beanie Feldstein, Jayne Houdyshell, and June Squibb, the film ended up on various critics’ top 10 lists from 2021.\n\n#24. Alice’s Restaurant (1969)\n\n– Director: Arthur Penn\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.2\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 111 minutes\n\nIn this adaptation of the 1967 folk song “Alice’s Restaurant Massacree” written by Arlo Guthrie, Guthrie plays himself—a drifter who connects with friends for Thanksgiving. Things go sideways when they all decide to take a load of trash to the dump, only to find the dump closed. They toss the trash off a cliff, which leads to police involvement, criminal records, and a host of other problems. Combining both comedic and more solemn moments, the movie touches on relationships between friends and family, as well as the impact of the 1960s counterculture on society at large.\n\n#23. For Your Consideration (2006)\n\n– Director: Christopher Guest\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.3\n\n– Metascore: 68\n\n– Runtime: 86 minutes\n\nOne of Christopher Guest’s famed mockumentaries, “For Your Consideration” is the story of a group of actors just finishing production on a movie called “Home for Purim.” They find out the movie is generating some Oscar buzz, which, in their excitement, leads to some over-the-top behavior. Studio executives get involved as well, renaming the movie “Home for Thanksgiving” because the original title is deemed “too Jewish.” Of course, it all comes to nothing when only one of the actors is even nominated, and they must all return to their normal lives.\n\n#22. The House of Yes (1997)\n\n– Director: Mark Waters\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n– Metascore: 54\n\n– Runtime: 85 minutes\n\nThis dark comedy tells of a young man bringing his new girlfriend (Tori Spelling) home to meet his family for Thanksgiving, not anticipating that his twin sister (Parker Posey), who lives with a mental illness, might not be too thrilled about it. Financed by Spelling’s father’s company, Spelling Entertainment, the film debuted to mediocre reviews and failed to make back its modest $1.5 million budget. But it did go on to have a bit of a cult following, and Parker Posey garnered Special Jury Recognition at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n#21. Home for the Holidays (1995)\n\n– Director: Jodie Foster\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.5\n\n– Metascore: 56\n\n– Runtime: 103 minutes\n\nBased on a short story by Chris Radant and directed by Jodie Foster, this movie showcases the often hilarious reality of family dynamics during the holidays, when a woman decides to spend Thanksgiving with her dysfunctional family. While the movie wasn’t considered a commercial success, Foster was praised for her directorial work, and actress Claire Danes received a Young Artist Award nomination for her performance.\n\n#20. Mistress America (2015)\n\n– Director: Noah Baumbach\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: 75\n\n– Runtime: 84 minutes\n\nCollege student Tracy (Lola Kirke) is alone and lonely in New York City, so she seeks out her soon-to-be stepsister, Brooke (Greta Gerwig). The two become friends and try to gain financing for a restaurant Brooke wants to open, which ultimately leads to a falling out and betrayal. When Tracy finds herself alone again on Thanksgiving, she ends up reconnecting with Brooke, and the two spend the holiday together, discovering a tenuous bond they didn’t know existed.\n\n#19. The New World (2005)\n\n– Director: Terrence Malick\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: 69\n\n– Runtime: 135 minutes\n\nTerrence Malick’s “The New World” stars Colin Farrell as John Smith, an English captain who becomes romantically involved with Pocahontas (Q’orianka Kilcher), the daughter of the Powhatan chief, in the early days of the Jamestown settlement in Virginia in 1607.\n\nThough the film does not depict a Thanksgiving gathering—and most Americans tend to think of the first Thanksgiving as the feast held in New England in 1621—the Jamestown colonists apparently held their own Thanksgiving festivities in 1619. Plus, much like the first Thanksgiving story, the film depicts some of the earliest historical encounters between European settlers and Native Americans. The film received an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, and Kilcher received extensive recognition for her breakthrough film performance.\n\n#18. You’ve Got Mail (1998)\n\n– Director: Nora Ephron\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.7\n\n– Metascore: 57\n\n– Runtime: 119 minutes\n\nWhile the focus of “You’ve Got Mail” isn’t centered directly around Thanksgiving, the story does take place during the holiday and has become a much-loved classic. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan star as two people involved in an online romance; not knowing each other’s true identities as business rivals, they end up falling in love. Upon opening in December 1998, the film grossed more than $250 million worldwide.\n\n#17. What’s Cooking? (2000)\n\n– Director: Gurinder Chadha\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: 57\n\n– Runtime: 109 minutes\n\nThis British-American dramedy tells of four diverse families celebrating Thanksgiving in their own ways, with stories that are all somehow intertwined. As each family prepares its meal, combining traditional American turkey with specific cultural dishes, the families also contend with generational gaps, sibling squabbles, and unexpected guests.\n\n#16. Addams Family Values (1993)\n\n– Director: Barry Sonnenfeld\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.8\n\n– Metascore: 61\n\n– Runtime: 94 minutes\n\nIn this sequel to the 1991 movie, “The Addams Family” all the beloved characters return as Uncle Fester (Christopher Lloyd) weds crazy nanny Debbie (Joan Cusack), who plots to kill Fester and take his fortune. The film debuted in late November 1993, just in time for the holiday. To top it all off, the portrayal of Pocahontas by Wednesday Addams (Christina Ricci) in her camp’s Thanksgiving play sets the tone for the perfect, albeit twisted, seasonal movie.\n\n#15. The War at Home (1996)\n\n– Director: Emilio Estevez\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.9\n\n– Metascore: data not available\n\n– Runtime: 123 minutes\n\nWhen a Vietnam war hero named Jeremy comes home, he finds it difficult to return to his family and a “normal” small-town life. Played by Emilio Estevez, who also directed the film, Jeremy deals with PTSD and long-held resentment toward his father (Martin Sheen, Estevez’s real-life father) for not helping him evade the draft. It culminates at Thanksgiving dinner when Jeremy appears in his uniform and ends up pulling a gun on his father in anger. Playing off themes of estrangement during the Vietnam War era, the movie also focuses on the similarities between family conflict and the struggles of war.\n\n#14. One True Thing (1998)\n\n– Director: Carl Franklin\n\n– IMDb user rating: 6.9\n\n– Metascore: 63\n\n– Runtime: 127 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Anna Quindlen, and loosely based on her own life experiences, “One True Thing” is a movie about a young woman (played by Renée Zellweger) who comes home to care for her terminally ill mother, all while trying to navigate their fractured relationship during what will be their last Thanksgiving and Christmas together. Meryl Streep, who plays Zellweger’s mother, was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe for her role in the film.\n\n#13. The Daytrippers (1996)\n\n– Director: Greg Mottola\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.0\n\n– Metascore: 73\n\n– Runtime: 87 minutes\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving, a woman named Eliza (Hope Davis) finds what she thinks is a love note to her husband while cleaning her house. She shows it to her mother, setting off a crazy chain of events in which her entire family decides to drive to New York to confront the husband and find out the truth. Along the way, they discover some equally surprising truths about their relationships with each other and meet some interesting characters during their hunt for Eliza’s husband.\n\n#12. Pieces of April (2003)\n\n– Director: Peter Hedges\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.0\n\n– Metascore: 70\n\n– Runtime: 80 minutes\n\nKatie Holmes shows off her acting chops in this funny and charming offbeat movie about a young woman trying to make her first Thanksgiving dinner for her estranged family, as they all deal with her mother’s cancer diagnosis. Holmes’ hard-edged character earnestly tries to prepare a turkey, seeking out her less-than-enthusiastic neighbors for help when her oven quits working. While the meal doesn’t go exactly as planned, the family all ends up around the table together, finding a thread of connection despite their differences.\n\n#11. Grumpy Old Men (1993)\n\n– Director: Donald Petrie\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.0\n\n– Metascore: 53\n\n– Runtime: 103 minutes\n\nActing greats Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau shine in this holiday comedy about feuding friends who both become romantically interested in their new neighbor, played by Ann-Margret. Things only get worse when their love interest spends Thanksgiving with another man, and the other two men take rivalry to new heights as they try to impress the neighbor. The movie was a surprise hit, earning more than $70 million, and generated a sequel, “Grumpier Old Men,” in 1995.\n\n#10. Krisha (2015)\n\n– Director: Trey Edward Shults\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.1\n\n– Metascore: 86\n\n– Runtime: 83 minutes\n\nStarring writer-director Trey Edward Shults’ real-life aunt, Krisha Fairchild, “Krisha” is the story of a woman struggling with addiction, who attempts to reconnect with her family by preparing Thanksgiving dinner for them. The movie was adapted from a short film Shults also wrote and directed, and debuted in 2015 at the South by Southwest Film Festival. For the film, Shults received various awards recognizing his achievement as a first-time feature director.\n\n#9.

While the story centers around the death of a loved one, it is also a heartwarming reminder about how sometimes the family we have is the one we create. The film was nominated for three Oscars—Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Glenn Close, and Best Original Screenplay—and won the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1983.\n\n#8.

The family can’t seem to connect, which culminates on Thanksgiving when their Uncle Gabriel (played by Lou Jacobi) arrives late for dinner to find they’ve started without him. His outrage (“You cut the turkey without me?”) leads to more drama, estrangement, and loss. “Avalon” was critically acclaimed and was nominated for Oscars in four categories, including Best Original Screenplay.\n\n#7. Nobody’s Fool (1994)\n\n– Director: Robert Benton\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.3\n\n– Metascore: 86\n\n– Runtime: 110 minutes\n\nPaul Newman plays an aging hustler living in a small town who tries to navigate love and relationships as he comes to terms with where his life has ended up. The movie takes place over the holidays, starting with Thanksgiving, and highlights the loneliness of both Newman’s character and those around him. The film received Oscar nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Newman’s performance.\n\n#6.

Starring Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Christina Ricci, Joan Allen, Tobey Maguire, and Elijah Wood, the movie was nominated for several awards, and Weaver won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n#5. Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987)\n\n– Director: John Hughes\n\n– IMDb user rating: 7.6\n\n– Metascore: 72\n\n– Runtime: 93 minutes\n\nProbably one of the most well-known Thanksgiving movies to date, “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” takes Steve Martin and John Candy on a wild comedic ride as Martin’s character tries to get home for Thanksgiving, while Candy’s well-intentioned attempts to help bring nothing but disaster.

Avildsen\n\n– IMDb user rating: 8.1\n\n– Metascore: 70\n\n– Runtime: 120 minutes\n\nWhile “Rocky” might not be considered a quintessential Thanksgiving tale, the conflict that takes place at the Thanksgiving table during the film is a reminder of the difficulties of family gatherings.
