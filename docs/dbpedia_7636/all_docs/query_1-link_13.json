        "text": "The action genre is characterized by fast pacing, high energy, and large budgets to accommodate stunts, costumes, and props. Protagonists engage in frequent violence and close combat fights. The general plot involves a hero battling a villain and ultimately emerging victorious. Subgenres include action comedy, action drama, action adventure, and action horror. The action genre originated in 1920s Westerns and expanded through cowboy and spy films. Iconic action films include the James Bond series from the 1960s and martial arts films from the 1970s. Common conventions are a hero, villain, explosions, dramatic music, abductions or killings, weapons, missions, chases, disasters, and moments where the hero's success seems unlikely"
