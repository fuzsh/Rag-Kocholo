        "text": "Director Park Beom-su made Victory so that viewers could have another film to turn to in difficult times.\n\n“An old friend once said something like this, ‘I have a movie I watch whenever I'm going through tough times,” said Park. “That statement left a deep impression on me. A movie that you turn to during difficult times—it's such a meaningful idea. I hope Victory can become that kind of movie for someone.”\n\nVictory is just that kind of shake-off-the-blues movie, a sunny film with likable characters that fight for their goals and inspire others along the way. Lee Hye-ri plays Pil-sun, who dreams of becoming a dancer. Her teachers consider her a troublemaker because she stands up for what she believes in. Her punishment for getting into a fight costs her the use of the school’s dance practice room. She and best friend Mi-na, played by Park Se-wan, come up with a plan. They convince the school to form a cheerleading team so they can have a designated practice space. Lee describes Pil-sun as having admirable, girl crush qualities.\n\n“It was a role I had always wanted to try if the opportunity arose,” said Lee. “The director said, 'I hope Pil-sun gives off a cool older sister vibe that your friends would want to emulate,' and I really liked that aspect. Pil-sun is resilient. She knows how to speak her mind confidently anywhere and is loyal, knowing when to protect the weak. I think this makes her a character that audiences can easily empathize with.”\n\nThe actress describes Pil-sun as someone with clear dreams.\n\n“She knows exactly what she wants and is ambitious, consistently pursuing her goals,” said Lee. “It felt admirable that she had a clear dream and goal of becoming a dancer.”\n\nPil-sun and Mi-na form the team with the help of a transfer student who was a cheerleader at her previous high school. Their plan seems to be working perfectly until they realize they will actually have to learn cheerleading skills, which is not the same skill set they’ve been using to dance. They are also not fond of training at dawn. Like her character Lee completed months of intense training. The actress, who performed with the k-pop group Girls Day, is a talented dancer, but dance moves don’t necessarily translate to cheerleading moves.\n\n“In cheerleading, it's important to perform movements with 'up' energy and precise timing,” said Lee. “While hip-hop dance focuses on groovy rhythms. You can think of them as complete opposites. That's why it wasn't easy to practice both genres of dance at the same time. Cheerleading is a genre where the synchronization of all members is crucial. Even if the timing or lines are slightly off or the formation is just a bit out of place, it becomes very noticeable, so it was important for everyone to synchronize together.”\n\nThree girls don’t make a cheerleading squad so the film’s heroines stage auditions. Some prospective cheerleaders are too dramatic, some too tame, others too awkward, but somehow they manage to assemble a team.\n\n“Real auditions were more challenging than those portrayed in the movie,” said Park Beom-su. “We had to find the most perfect person with unique looks, skills, dancing, acting, etc., and ultimately succeeded in finding them.”\n\nNone of the actresses playing the rest of the cheerleading squad were originally dancers.\n\n“They had to practice tirelessly for months,” said Park Beom-su. “With the actors' passion, we were able to shoot all scenes without any stunt doubles.”\n\nPark, who is known for his 2014 debut Red Carpet and recent romantic comedy Single In Seoul, has long wanted to make a cheerleading movie and he’s a fan of Bring It On, the 2000 Kristen Dunst comedy about a cheerleading squad.\n\n“Even before Victory, I had an interest in cheerleading,” said Park. “Watching singing and dancing always gave me a lot of positive energy. Bring It On is a movie I really cherish.”\n\nVictory gave Lee a chance to learn cheerleading skills and also to wear a high school uniform again. She hasn’t had many chances to wear a uniform when acting in dramas.\n\n“The last time I wore a school uniform was for a flashback scene in My Roommate is a Gumiho,” she said. “Surprisingly, I haven't played many characters who wear school uniforms in my projects. So, I once mentioned that I wanted to act in a school uniform someday, and I'm glad that Victory gave me that opportunity.\n\nBut more importantly the film introduced her to a character she won’t easily forget\n\n“I feel like that character has had an impact on me,” said Lee. “There were moments when Pil-sun's confidence and passion stimulated me, and thinking back on the filming, it felt reminiscent of a scene from my childhood. She's a character who is truly precious to me.”\n\nWhen viewers first meet Pil-sun and Mi-na, they are obviously not aiming to be A students. Yet their cheerleading performance helps the school’s soccer team rally and lifts the entire school’s morale. The film seems to say that everyone has something to offer.\n\n“We are all protagonists in our own lives,” said Park Beom-su. “Each of us has moments where we shine brightly, and we continue to shine even now.”\n\nLee will receive the Rising Star Asia Award on July 12 when Victory has its world premiere at the New York Asian Film Festival. Lee, director Park and co-star Park will attend the premiere and a post-screening Q&A. The Rising Star Asia Award recognizes emerging talent from Asian cinema. Previous recipients include Japan’s Masami Nagasawa and Ryohei Suzuki, Korea’s Kim Go-eun and Thailand’s Yaya Sperbund.\n\nLee aka Hyeri is known for her roles in the Korean drama series Reply 1988, Moonshine, May I Help You and My Roommate Is A Gumiho. She also appeared in the films Monstrum, and My Punch-Drunk Boxer, and can currently be seen in the unscripted series Agents of Mystery. Co-star Park Se-wan is known for the film Life Is Beautiful and dramas Doona and One Day Off, while co-star Lee Jung-ha appeared in the hit Disney+ series Moving. Victory was produced by Seoul-based Annapurna Films, headed by Lee Anna, the producer of 2011 box-office hit Sunny. For director Park Beom-su, Victory delivers a positive message.\n\n“The message that the movie aims to convey is cheer for others and you will also receive cheers yourself,” said Park. “While making the movie, we also supported each other a lot and felt supported in return. Every moment was enjoyable.”\n\nThe film opens in Korea in August."
