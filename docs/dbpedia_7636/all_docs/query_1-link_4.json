        "text": "Narrative subgenre of drama with psychological fiction\n\nPsychological dramaInfluences\n\nPsychological fiction\n\nArthouse film\n\nIndependent film\n\nMelodrama\n\nSlice of life\n\nPsychological drama, or psychodrama,[1] is a subgenre of drama and psychological fiction literatures, generally focuses upon the emotional, mental, and psychological development of the protagonists and other characters within the narrative, which is highlighted in a dramatic work.[2][3][4] Widely known one of the main subgenres of psychological fiction, the subgenre is commonly used for films and television series.\n\nDiscussion of the subgenre\n\n[edit]\n\nThe roots of the subgenre can be traced back to the early 20th century, emerging from a rich tapestry of literature that focused on the inner workings of the mind. As cinema evolved, filmmakers began to see the potential for the medium to explore complex psychological themes and narratives.[5]\n\nCharacteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nSimilar with these psychological genres, but rather than using imagery to provoke fear, suspense or terror, they utilize dramatic settings to elicit a strong, emotional value from audiences. Psychological dramas commonly deal directly with the psychological state and mental health, emphasize on emotional conflicts and often serve as a portrait of introspective personal struggle.[3]\n\nIt can be also characterized as primary character-driven, in which attention will be particularly paid to the psychology of the characters, to their intimate problems more than to the storyline context.[6] The characters are confronted with doubts, dilemmas or inner personality conflicts. The challenges they encounter will often force them to react, making them go through a whole psychological process during the film, even a metamorphosis.[7]\n\nRelated with genres\n\n[edit]\n\nIt often overlaps with other genres such as crime, fantasy, dark comedy, mystery and science fiction, and it is closely related with the psychological horror and psychological thriller genres. Psychological dramas use these genres' tropes to focus on the human condition and psychological effects, usually in a mature and serious tone, nearly similar to melodrama.\n\nThe difference between \"drama\" and \"psychological drama\" that places emphasis is that in the latter scenario, the focus is more on the psychological character of the characters and on existentialism in general, and not on the context of the narrative itself. So, the end is not necessarily tragic: the main character can doubt himself and sometimes overcome his intimate problems. Psychological drama can be very clearly distinguished from dramedy, as there is no to minimal humor in it like Good Will Hunting (1997) and The Truman Show (1998) but since the subgenre is rather devoid of humor.\n\nTechniques\n\n[edit]\n\nEach films utilize a range of techniques to mirror the psychological landscape of their characters. Close-ups and subjective camera angles invite viewers into the character’s personal space, while disjointed editing and surreal imagery can reflect fragmented states of mind. The use of symbolism is also prevalent, with objects, settings, and colors imbued with psychological significance. Music and sound design play crucial roles, often used to heighten the emotional intensity and draw audiences deeper into the psychological experience.[5]\n\nThemes\n\n[edit]\n\nThese primary themes in the subgenre related to depiction of mental illness, psychological trauma, and society, but not limited to; other themes like alienation, self-doubt, and the quest for identity are common, with narratives often blurring the lines between reality and illusion to reflect the turmoil within the characters’ minds.[5]\n\nIt can be explore thematic elements include: denialism, depression, disability, distorted sequences, dysfunctional relationships, existential crisis, human sexuality, identity crisis, mass hysteria, mood swings, odd behaviors, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological abuse, psychedelic art, and social issues.[8]\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nPsychological drama films have generally rooted with traditional drama genre in the earliest years of 20th century, with these examples cited The Whispering Chorus (1918)[10] and Greed (1924).[11] Additionally, early examples of popular subgenre films in 1930s to 1950s include La vuelta al nido (1938),[12] Death of a Salesman (1951),[13] Johnny Belinda (1948),[14] A Place in the Sun (1951),[15] and The Snake Pit (1948)[16]\n\nSeveral films generally used the subgenre have employed controversially social issues and/or psychosexual themes, most notably Stanley Kubrick's Lolita (1962),[17] A Clockwork Orange (1971), and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).[18] Other acclaimed films with similar themes including Last Tango in Paris (1972),[19] One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),[20][21] The Ninth Configuration (1980),[22] Pink Floyd - The Wall,[23] Sophie's Choice (both 1982)[24] Heavenly Creatures (1994),[25] Breaking the Waves (1996),[26] I Stand Alone (1998), Magnolia (1999), Requiem for a Dream (2000),[27] The Piano Teacher (2001), Elephant (2003),[24] Enter the Void (2009),[28] Biutiful (2010),[29] Shame (2011),[30] Jagten[31] and The Master (both 2012),[32] Nymphomaniac (2013),[26] Whiplash (2014),[33][24] The Power of the Dog (2021),[34][35][36] and Blonde and The Whale (both 2022).[37]\n\nFilms have some thematically-linked franchises or trilogies to focus on aspects of human condition and psychological elements, notably Iñárritu's Death trilogy (consists Amores perros (2000), 21 Grams (2003) and Babel (2006)) and Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours trilogy.\n\nAsian films have contributed the subgenre, often employs several psychological and social elements.
