It is their main mode of transportation and acts as a Operations base and support vessel.\n\nDesign:[]\n\nThe ship itself is a built from scratch via some old drawings from War Thoughts Inc., remodeled to fit their needs, and it is a marvel to itself. With the main body of an Atlesian battlecruiser, it acts as the baseplate for the rest of it. With the additions of multiple hangars, a large cargo bay door in the rear of the vessel, and a large command bridge\n\nArmaments:[]\n\nThe ship itself is a well armed powerhouse, with multiple broadside cannon batteries, missile batteries for both air combat and ground bombardment.\n\nIts main weapon is its forward mounted Railgun, able to fire 800mm shells at a ridiculous 4,500 mph. speed, and has been known to pierce even the heaviest of Grimm and Airship armor. The railgun itself has been copied to create a large anti-airship network, created after the Battle of Beacon showed Atlas that they need Airship defense.\n\nDefenses:[]\n\nIts main defense is its point defense systems, including interceptor missiles, smoke deployment, flares, and a powerful shield system.\n\nTrivia:[]"
