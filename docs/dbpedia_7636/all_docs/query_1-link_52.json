        "text": "Amazon Prime Video hasn't had a very interesting year with its slate of original movies, especially of late, but what has come to Prime Video this year has been solid, including the 2024 Oscar winner American Fiction, which earned the Best Adapted Screenplay award along with four other nominations including Best Picture. But it's not just the prestige stuff here — Amazon's also got plenty of pulpier fare, like the Jake Gyllenhaal-starring remake of Road House, and Emerald Fennel's Saltburn.\n\nJust to let you know how we put this list together: In order to keep the list as relevant as possible, we're putting the most importance on new releases, Prime Video originals, and critics' favorites. But we're also adding our own personal spin on the list, with underrated gems we're recommending to our friends, classic favorites, and important selections that highlight diverse voices. We'll be updating the list regularly.\n\nLast updated on July 26; the most recent additions are at the top.\n\nDisclaimer: When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nFor fans of: Stories that break the fourth wall, quirky comedies with something to say, things that are good\n\nDirector: Cord Jefferson\n\nStars: Jeffrey Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Erika Alexander, John Ortiz, Sterling K. Brown, Issa Rae\n\nGenre: Comedy, drama, satire\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 81\n\nAmerican Fiction isn't the easiest movie to try to sum up in a blurb, but we'll do our best. Jeffrey Wright stars as a well-to-do Black author who attempts to satirize what he sees as stereotypcally acceptable \"Black\" literature, only for everybody to treat the result as a serious and sincere work that earns tons of acclaim — and from there, it gets weird. American Fiction plays like if Spike Lee's Bamboozled was given a Charlie Kaufman-esque, fourth-wall-breaking makeover, and it's impossible not to be enthralled by this flick. -Phil Owen [Trailer]\n\nThe Idea of You\n\nFor fans of: Swoony rom-coms with heart, Anne Hathaway mothering\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nStars: Anne Hathaway, Nicholas Galitzine\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 68\n\nYou may have first heard of The Idea of You because of its male lead Hayes Campbell's (Nicholas Galitzine) uncanny resemblance to Harry Styles. Hayes sings in a wildly popular boy band, just like Styles did, and he too has a penchant for dating older women. But the film, based on Robinne Lee's book of the same name, deserves to be recognized apart from that comparison. To start, the chemistry between Galitzine's Hayes and Anne Hathaway's Solène Marchand is undeniable. Solène is a 40-year-old single mom who never imagined attending Coachella but finds herself in the VIP lounge for a meet-and-greet with August Moon — Hayes' group —thanks to her teenage daughter. And after she serendipitously walks into the 24-year-old lead singer's trailer, the two begin a whirlwind romance. The Idea of You is a weightier film than some others in the genre because of how it dives into issues like the age-gap double standard and the obstacles to women in their 30s and 40s finding happiness. But for the most part, it feels like a light, breezy walk on the beach. -Kat Moon [Trailer]\n\nRoad House\n\nFor fans of: Fist fights, Jake Gyllenhaal, highly kinetic action sequences\n\nDirector: Doug Liman\n\nStars: Jake Gyllenhaal, Daniela Melchior, Billy Magnusson, Joaquim de Almeida, Post Malone, Conor McGregor\n\nGenre: Action\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 57\n\nThe original Road House (starring Patrick Swayze and also included with Prime Video) became a cult classic after circulating on cable for years — it did OK at the box office and not so OK with critics when it was released in theaters in 1989. So it's not really that big of a concern that the new Road House, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, only got mixed reviews. Like that original film leaned on Swayze's charm to function, the new Road House is a delightful little action flick that leans heavily on Gyllenhaal's immense charisma, and ole Jakey G. is just as much fun as he always is. And while Conor McGregor isn't quite on Gyllenhaal's level in terms of his acting chops, he's got the exact right amount of screen presence and general menace to pretty much rule as a bad guy enforcer. This movie just works, even if we might wish they'd cooled it on the CGI a little bit. -Phil Owen [Trailer]\n\nBottoms\n\nFor fans of: Fight clubs, high schools\n\nDirector: Emma Seligman\n\nStars: Ayo Edebiri, Rachel Sennott, Ruby Cruz, Havana Rose Liu, Nicholas Galitzine\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 74\n\nThis indie film came out in theaters last August, but unless you are a subscriber to MGM+, which you are not, it hasn't been available on your streaming subscriptions until recently. The premise — a high school sex comedy mixed with... Fight Club!?!? — is truly deranged, but it somehow works as two teenage lesbians start a brutal women's self-defense club to give them the tools to beat up the football team. It satirizes as it pulverizes, challenging stereotypes while saying something meaningful between delivering haymakers. Bodies Bodies Bodies' Rachel Sennott and The Bear's Ayo Edebiri star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nFast X\n\nFor fans of: Action, cars, #family\n\nDirector: Louis Leterrier\n\nStars: Vin Diesel, Jason Momoa, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sung Kang, Nathalie Emmanuel\n\nGenre: Action\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 56\n\nThe Fast & Furious movies have been a pop culture mainstay for two decades, but all good things must come to an end. And Fast X is the beginning of the end for this franchise, starting us down the home stretch that will presumably end with Vin Diesel riding off into the sunset to meet up with Paul Walker in car heaven at the end of the next movie. We're not there yet, though, and we're grateful for that, because Jason Momoa's man-child of a villain is the most fun baddie this franchise has ever had. -Phil Owen [Trailer]\n\nSaltburn\n\nFor fans of: Lifestyles of the rich and eccentric\n\nDirector: Emerald Fennell\n\nStars: Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, Jacob Elordi, Richard E. Grant\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 61\n\nIf you saw Promising Young Woman, Emerald Fennell's polarizing (and, nevertheless, Oscar-winning) 2020 directorial debut, you already know that she's the kind of director who really likes making people talk. She's done it again, and to an even greater degree, with Saltburn, her Talented Mr. Ripley-esque salute to the aughts. Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver Quick, a poor Oxford student who gets drawn into the alluring world of the wealthy when he buddies up to Felix (Jacob Elordi), a classmate from an aristocratic family who takes pity on his less fortunate friend by inviting Oliver to spend the summer at his eccentric family's estate. Or is Oliver less fortunate? Come to find out the answer to that question, stay for a deliciously clueless performance from Rosamund Pike. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nAsteroid City\n\nFor fans of: Well-framed shots, A-listers dressed oddly\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nStars: Jason Schwartzman, Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie, Steve Carell\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 75\n\nEvery time Wes Anderson directs a new film, at least one critic inevitably calls it \"the most Wes Anderson movie Wes Anderson has ever made.\" That might actually be true of Asteroid City, his latest. Anderson's quirky, dollhouse style is at an all-time high in this story that depicts the fateful events of a teen astronomy convention in a retrofuturistic version of 1955. The sprawling cast features perfectly droll performances from Jason Schwartzman, Tom Hanks, Margot Robbie, Steve Carell, and more, while the meta narrative (Asteroid City is also the name of a televised play within the movie) adds zany texture. It often plays like a live-action cartoon, as Anderson's best movies tend to. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nPolite Society\n\nFor fans of: Martial arts movies, sisters\n\nDirector: Nida Manzoor\n\nStars: Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 75\n\nThere's no movie that can't be punched up with a little martial arts aided by wires and pulleys, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon style, right? This action comedy from We Are Lady Parts creator Nida Manzoor follows a young British-Pakistani woman who dreams of being a stuntwoman and has a sneaking suspicion that her sister's impending marriage to a hunk might mask her future in-laws' secretly terrible motives. Naturally, this leads to some Shaolin fight sequences, a plot that veers way off course yet still stays on brand with the nuttiness, and a delightful central story about the love between two sisters. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTotally Killer\n\nFor fans of: The '80s, time travel, maniacal masked murderers\n\nDirector: Nahnatchka Khan\n\nStars: Kiernan Shipka, Olivia Holt, Julie Bowen\n\nGenre: Horror, Comedy, Sci-Fi\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 63\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina's Kiernan Shipka sticks with humorous horror in this original film from the reliable Nahnatchka Khan, the creator of Don't Trust the B---- in Apt. 23, Always Be My Maybe, and Fresh Off the Boat. Shipka's Jamie is a young woman who time travels back to 1987, right around the time her mom's friends were stalked and murdered by a mask-wearing maniac. So what does she do? She tries — with the help of the teenage version of her mom (Olivia Holt) — to stop the murders, despite any potential Back to the Future erasure of her existence that may happen. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSitting in Bars with Cake (2023)\n\nFor fans of: Tragi-friend-coms, bawling\n\nDirector: Trish Sie\n\nStars: Odessa A'zion, Yara Shahidi, Ron Livingston, Bette Midler, and Martha Kelly\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy, Romance\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 66\n\nA pair of friends (A'zion and Shahadi) take cakes into bars as a way to get out in the world and break the ice with strangers, but their lives change when one gets a tragic diagnosis. This one's based on a true story and is being called a Beaches for today's kids, so you know what to expect: female friendship, some romance, and a lot of crying. This is for a specific audience; you know who you are! -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)\n\nFor fans of: Rooting for the creepy doll, satires on commercialism, Child's Play but better\n\nDirector: John Francis Daley and Jonathan M. Goldstein\n\nStars: Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Hugh Grant, Justice Smith, Regé-Jean Page, Sophia Lillis\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Comedy, Action\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 72\n\nExpecting a good time while watching the famous tabletop role-playing game come to life is hardly a roll of the dice. This movie is always entertaining, moving forward with a combination of adventure, action, humor, and decent special effects. Chris Pine plays a rogue on the run looking for some nerdy object (a magical helm, a tablet that can bring back the dead, some stuff like that, it doesn't matter), and he's accompanied by other D&D classes, like Michelle Rodriguez's barbarian, Justice Smith's sorcerer, Sophia Lillis' shapeshifting druid, and Regé-Jean Page's paladin. Its focus on fun means anyone can enjoy it, even those who don't know what a gelatinous cube is. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nM3GAN (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Rooting for the creepy doll, satires on commercialism, Child's Play but better\n\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\n\nStars: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Ronny Chieng, Jenna Davis, Amie Donald\n\nGenre: Science-fiction, Horror\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 72\n\nAI will kill us all! But first it will be our best friend. On premise alone — M3GAN is about a lifelike toy doll prototype that goes to extreme lengths to protect its child owner — this 2022 film seems like stinky garbage, but the Blumhouse film wisely leans into the goofiness to become a sharp satire of technology and consumerism. The PG-13 rating also means it's good for young teens and older tweens, but there's an unrated version available if you want a little more blood. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nCreed III (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Boxing beefcakes\n\nDirector: Michael B. Jordan\n\nStars: Michael B. Jordan, Jonathan Majors, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 73\n\nMichael B. Jordan stars in and directs the third movie to rise from the ashes of the Rocky franchise, this time following Adonis Creed (Jordan) as he prepares to fight his former childhood friend, Damian Anderson (Majors), years after an event changed both of their lives. Though not as acclaimed as the first two movies, it's still wildly entertaining, with bruising boxing sequences and a blistering performance from Jordan. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTár (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Acting!\n\nDirector: Todd Field\n\nStars: Cate Blanchett\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: NR\n\nMetacritic score: 92\n\nCate Blanchett's powerhouse performance and Todd Field's script and keen direction launched Tár into the discussions for best film of 2022, with many major prestigious film critics associations naming it their favorite. It was nominated for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and more at the Oscars (but didn't win any), further establishing it as a cinephile's favorite. As for what it's about, Blanchett plays an internationally renowned orchestra conductor whose career is disrupted by accusations of misconduct. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nShe Said (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Journalism, #MeToo stories\n\nDirector: Maria Schrader\n\nStars: Zoe Kazan, Carey Mulligan, Patricia Clarkson, Andre Braugher\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: NR\n\nMetacritic score: 74\n\nThe two reporters — Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey — behind the New York Times investigation into the sexual abuse committed by film producer Harvey Weinstein are at the center of this award-winning drama based on the 2019 book of the same name. Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan star as Kantor and Twohey, who exposed one of the biggest names in Hollywood, caused a sea change in the entertainment industry, and ushered in one of the biggest social movements in history as #MeToo helped women come together against sexism and abuse. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nAir (2023)\n\nFor fans of: Sneakers, business deals, Michael Jordan's mom\n\nDirector: Ben Affleck\n\nStars: Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Viola Davis, Jason Bateman, Chris Tucker, Chris Messina\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 73\n\nBen Affleck's film about Nike's seismic business decision to build a basketball shoe brand around some guy named Michael Jordan is a sharp look at the start of sports marketing and risky business endeavors that paid off. It's also kind of a Nike ad. But with a solid screenplay, some great acting by a tremendous cast, and Affleck's ability to blend comedy into corporate affairs, it's a... slam dunk. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nJudy Blume Forever (2023)\n\nFor fans of: Superfudge, free speech\n\nDirector: Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok\n\nStars: Judy Blume\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRating: NR\n\nMetacritic score: 79\n\nBeloved author Judy Blume is the star and focus of this documentary about her life as one of the most popular young adult fiction writers ever. Speaking with fans like Molly Ringwald, Samantha Bee, and Lena Dunham, Judy Blume Forever explores the impact she had on young women's lives and the closed-minded controversy surrounding her openness in writing about teenage sexuality. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nBros (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Rom-coms updated for today\n\nDirector: Nicholas Stoller\n\nStars: Billy Eichner, Luke Macfarlane, Bowen Yang, Debra Messing\n\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 72\n\nBilly Eichner wrote and plays the romantic lead of this well-reviewed gay rom-com, which sees a podcast host (Eichner) about to launch an LGBTQ+ museum in New York City when his already busy life is disrupted by another single gay man (Luke Macfarlane). Though both are wary of commitment, they are drawn together anyway. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTop Gun: Maverick (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Speed, old people looking younger than you\n\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\n\nStars: Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, and Tom Cruise\n\nGenre: Action, Drama\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 78\n\nYou've seen Top Gun: Maverick on the big screen, but have you seen it on your phone!?!? Relive all the intense IMAX action and dripping masculinity on your six-inch screen now that it's on Prime Video. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nShotgun Wedding (2023)\n\nFor fans of: J-Lo, J-Du, J-Cool\n\nDirector: Jason Moore\n\nStars: Jennifer Jopez, Josh Duhamel, Jennifer Coolidge\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 42\n\nWhat makes a good movie anyway? Rave reviews from critics? Meaningful contributions to society? A talking dog? The Prime Video original movie Shotgun Wedding has none of that, but it does have Jennifer Lopez and the newest fan-favorite Jenny from the block, Jennifer Coolidge. And it has Jennifer Lopez fighting off pirates after they invade her wedding, leading to double crosses and comical violence. This isn't a good movie, but it is a Jennifer Lopez movie that can't be found anywhere else, so it's on the list. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nWildcat (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Tough guys and cute kittens, weeping\n\nDirector: Melissa Lesh and Trevor Frost\n\nStars: Harry Turner, Samantha Zwicker, an ocelot\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 71\n\nI don't have a bunch of tattoos, and I've never been to war, but I do love cats, which is enough for me to relate to this documentary about an Afghanistan War veteran whose PTSD drives him to the jungles of South America. There, he meets a nature conservationist running a wildlife refuge, where he bonds with an ocelot kitten. The young purr box helps him heal as he finds himself teaching it how to hunt, protecting it from humans threatening the environment, and finding something that doesn't judge him. This is for anyone who's ever had a furry friend. BRING A HANKIE! -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nNanny (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Horror, the melting pot\n\nDirector: Nikyatu Jusu\n\nStars: Anna Diop, Michelle Monaghan, Morgan Spector\n\nGenre: Horror\n\nRating: NR\n\nMetacritic score: 72\n\nThanks to new voices in Hollywood, we've become introduced a fresh, thrilling subgenre of film: immigrant horror stories. Most of them have been pretty good (Netflix's His House and No One Gets Out Alive use their unique perspective well), and that continues with Nanny, the debut film from writer/director Nikyatu Jusu about an undocumented West African nanny caring for a New York couple's child and preparing for the arrival of her own child, whom she left behind. The horror comes when a strange presence threatens her reality. It's a visually impressive debut about family, societal issues, and gender. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nYour Christmas or Mine? (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Shlocky holiday films, wacky in-laws\n\nDirector: Jim O'Hanlon\n\nStars: Asa Butterfield, Cora Kirk, Daniel Mays, David Bradley\n\nGenre: Rom-com, Christmas\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: n/a\n\nNeed some Christmas jolly? But also want some relationship folly? Try this British holiday film about a young man (Asa Butterfield) who can't bear to be apart from his girlfriend on Christmas, so he decides to surprise her at her family's house. Alas, she decided to do the same thing, so they end up spending the holiday with each other's families. It's not a Christmas classic, but it will do the trick if you're looking for a little tug of the heart. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nGood Night Oppy (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Human accomplishments, human connections, robots\n\nDirector: Ryan White\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRating: PG\n\nMetacritic score: 65\n\nThe closest thing we have to a real-life Wall-E is the Mars rover Opportunity, which landed on the Red Planet in 2004 for a 90-day mission but ended up operating for almost 15 years. This documentary film tells its story and the bond that the NASA operators formed with it, and will leave you wondering why you're crying over a robot throughout its wondrous 105 minutes. It's already won the Critics Choice Documentary Award for best feature, and it's got a real shot at an Oscar nomination at the 2023 Academy Awards. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nMy Policeman (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Harry Styles\n\nDirector: Michael Grandage\n\nStars: Harry Styles, Emma Corrin, David Dawson, Linus Roache, Gina McKee, Rupert Everett\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 49\n\nThe British film My Policeman is getting a wide range of reviews from critics and audience members alike, but don't let that stop you from rummaging through this period romance for clues about Harry Styles' relationship with Olivia Wilde and who maybe spat on whom at the Don't Worry Darling movie premiere. Styles plays a British cop who is the pointy end in a love triangle that features his to-be wife (Emma Corrin) and a museum curator (David Dawson), with their messy love stuff played out over two timelines as they try to mend the past much later in life (with different actors). According to critics, the clandestine homosexual relationship in a time where we were far from progressive should be the fuel for this movie's engine, but the actors and woeful mood make this less enjoyable than your average sad love story. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nTorn Hearts (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Country music, mind games\n\nDirector: Brea Grant\n\nStars: Katey Sagal, Abby Quinn, and Alexxis Lemire\n\nGenre: Horror, Thriller\n\nRating: Not Rated\n\nMetacritic score: 59\n\nBrea Grant follows up her well-received 2022 black comedy horror 12 Hour Shift with this winky thriller about two aspiring female country music artists who see an opportunity to advance their careers with a visit to a reclusive music legend (Sagal). But what looks like a perfect match to record a new song turns into a series of mental and physical games that test just how far the two are willing to go for fame. Yep, a shotgun is involved. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Northman (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Drinking the blood of your enemies out of their skulls\n\nDirector: Robert Eggers\n\nStars: Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Claes Bang\n\nGenre: Drama, Action\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 82\n\nRobert Eggers' delightfully violent film set in Viking society was previously only streaming on Peacock, but whatever deals that were needed to bring it to Prime Video were dealt, and that's good news for you because The Northman is totally radical. Modern-day Viking Alexander Skarsgård stars as a prince out to avenge the death of his father, and he does so with both incredible patience and brutality. Eggers is one of the best filmmakers working today, and The Northman is another fine addition to his collection. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nCatherine Called Birdy (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Medieval teen dramedies, House Mormont\n\nDirector: Lena Dunham\n\nStars: Bella Ramsey, Andrew Scott, Billie Piper\n\nGenre: YA Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 75\n\nDid you get word from the raven? Period pieces no longer have to be stuffy, boring slogs, and can now feature today's pop hits and Gen Z lingo while still putting their main characters in elaborate gowns and powdered wigs. Lena Dunham takes her turn unstuffing the old times with this film about a young lady (Game of Thrones' Bella Ramsey) in 1290 England whose parents wish to marry her off in order to regain some medieval clout, so she schemes to sabotage their plans. She's precocious, see? Billie Piper and Andrew Scott, both always delightful, also star. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nDog (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Channing Tatum, dogs\n\nDirector: Channing Tatum and Reid Carolin\n\nStars: Channing Tatum and a Belgian Malinois\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 61\n\nPutting Channing Tatum and a dog together in a road trip movie is all some people need to know to want to watch this movie, but it has the added surprise of sensitivity as it tells the story of an Army vet (Tatum) racing to his fallen friend's funeral with his friend's dog in tow. It's not a must-see, but it's an easy watch that will get your emotions going without taxing your brain too much. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nSamaritan (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Superheroes, Sylvester Stallone beating up Robocop-type street crooks\n\nDirector: Julius Avery\n\nStars: Sylvester Stallone, Javon \"Wanna\" Walton, Dascha Polanco, Pilou Asbæk\n\nGenre: Superhero, Action\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 45\n\nThis dark superhero movie was supposed to save the day in 2020, but a series of delays pushed it back to 2022 and onto Amazon Prime Video instead of theaters. Sylvester Stallone stars as a superhero named Samaritan who goes into hiding for 20 years until a young boy figures out who he is and encourages him to clean up the streets once again. Reviews are... not that great, but it's Stallone, you know? -Tim Surette [Trailer | Review]\n\nThe Lost City (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Romancing the Stone, sweaty A-listers\n\nDirector: Aaron Nee and Adam Nee\n\nStars: Channing Tatum, Sandra Bullock, Daniel Radcliffe, Brad Pitt\n\nGenre: Adventure, Romance, Comedy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 60\n\nThis throwback adventure stars Sandra Bullock as a romance novelist who gets kidnapped by an evil billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) who hopes she'll lead him to a secret treasure described in one her books. The vapid male model (Channing Tatum) who posed for her book covers decides to come to her rescue, and you can probably guess what happens next. It's a fun film for when you have two hours and a pint of ice cream to kill. Also, Patti Harrison is in it! -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThirteen Lives (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Ron Howard drama, real-life heroism, confined spaces\n\nDirector: Ron Howard\n\nStars: Viggo Mortenson, Collin Farrell, Joel Edgerton\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 66\n\nRon Howard directs this thriller film about the 2018 Tham Luang Thai cave rescue of a boys soccer team and its coach by an international group of cave divers. It's one of three projects about the rescue, including National Geographic's already released (and excellent) documentary The Rescue, which focused on the divers and the rescue efforts and is on Disney+, and Netflix's upcoming limited series Tham Luang, which focuses on the rescuees. This film covers the whole shebang, with Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton playing the heroes. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nLicorice Pizza (2021)\n\nFor fans of: The '70s, first loves\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nStars: Cooper Hoffman, Alana Haim, Sean Penn, Bradley Cooper\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 90\n\nOne of 2021's most cherished films is Paul Thomas Anderson's teen romance, which was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. Set in 1973 in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, it follows a 15-year-old actor (Cooper Hoffman) and his budding relationship with an early-20s photographer's assistant (Alana Haim). -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nAnything's Possible (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Queer teen romance, coming-of-age stories\n\nDirector: Billy Porter\n\nStars: Eva Reign, Abubakr Ali, Renée Elise Goldsberry,\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 65\n\nThe ridiculously talented Billy Porter makes his feature film directorial debut with this sweet high school coming-of-age story about a trans girl (Eva Reign) and the boy (Abubkar Ali) who musters up the courage to ask her out, even though he knows the drama it will cause at school. Important casting note: The inimitable Renée Elise Goldsberry is in this. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nDon't Make Me Go (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Father-daughter tearjerkers, internet boyfriend John Cho\n\nDirector: Hannah Marks\n\nStars: John Cho, Mia Isaac, Kaya Scodelario, Jemaine Clement\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 60\n\nIf you have a condition that doesn't allow you to cry, this John Cho film may be the cure. Cho stars as a single dad who, after discovering he has a terminal illness (but not a terminal list), embarks on a road trip from California to New Orleans with his teenage daughter to attend his 20-year college reunion. Road trip movies are like totally metaphors, man. This one's about getting to the end and growing up. But be warned: A controversial twist ending has many beating their heads against the wall. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nHouse of Gucci (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Glamour, excess, Lady Gaga\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nStars: Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Jared Leto, Jeremy Irons, Jack Huston, Salma Hayek, Al Pacino\n\nGenre: Drama, Crime\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 59\n\nHouse of Gucci, the extravagant crime drama that strutted through theaters late last year, is now on Prime Video. The movie, which tells the tragicomic story of how the Gucci family lost ownership of the fashion brand, is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Lady Gaga, Adam Driver, Al Pacino, and Jared Leto doing the Jared Leto thing of being unrecognizable under layers of prosthetics. If you didn't venture out to see it in theaters, you can now watch it for free at home, where you can imitate Lady Gaga's Italian accent without offending anyone. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]\n\nMarry Me (2022)\n\nFor fans of: J. Lo, Owen Wilson's whole thing, Instagram Live\n\nDirector: Kat Coiro\n\nStars: Jennifer Lopez, Owen Wilson, Sarah Silverman, Maluma, Michelle Buteau\n\nGenre: Comedy, Romance, Music\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 51\n\nThere's no help for people who don't see the joy in Marry Me. It's a classic Jennifer Lopez rom-com, with J. Lo essentially playing herself — uh, sorry, playing Kat Valdez, a famous pop star who gets stood up by her fiancé (played by Maluma) on the night of their livestreamed hybrid concert/wedding (normal!) and picks a random regular Brooklyn dad (Owen Wilson) out of the audience to marry instead. And wouldn't you know it, they fall in love for real. But they live in two different worlds! Listen, I didn't say it broke the mold, I just said I had a good time watching it. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nNo Time to Die (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Bond... James Bond\n\nDirector: Cary Fukunaga\n\nStars: Daniel Craig, Rami Malek, Léa Seydoux, Ana de Armas, Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Lashana Lynch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Thriller\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 68\n\nNo Time to Die is neither the best nor the worst Daniel Craig Bond movie, but it does mark his final appearance as the character, which makes it significant. It's a lengthy, stylish, occasionally inexplicable film that picks up after Bond has left active service with MI6 and is just trying to enjoy living a quiet life as a normal, extraordinarily handsome man. But you can't make a Bond movie about that, so it's all very quickly disrupted when the CIA recruits him to hunt down a mysterious and dangerous villain (Rami Malek). -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nEmergency (2022)\n\nDirector: Carey Williams\n\nStars: Sabrina Carpenter, Donald Elise Watkins, RJ Cyler\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 75\n\nThis Amazon film will likely get lost in the noise of the high-profile releases, but do not let it slip by if you're a fan of party comedies. The indie film follows a pair of young Black college seniors (RJ Cyler and Donald Elise Watkins) ready to let loose in a string of parties before spring break when they discover an unconscious white girl in their apartment, with no idea how she got there. Realizing the bad optics of the situation, they (and their Latino roommate) set out to return her to safety without their good intentions being misinterpreted. The movie got great reviews when it did the festival circuit earlier this year. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nAll the Old Knives (2022)\n\nDirector: Janus Metz Pederson\n\nStars: Thandiwe Newton, Chris Pine, Jonathan Pryce, Laurence Fishburne\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 63\n\nAll the Old Knives sounds like a Knives Out sequel set in a nursing home (that's a free idea for Rian Johnson), but it's actually a thriller starring Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton as spies who are also ex-lovers. I have no complaints about that concept. Based on the novel of the same name by Olen Steinhauer, who wrote the film's screenplay, the movie follows Pine's Henry Pelham as his investigation into a CIA mole becomes entangled in his history with Newton's Celia. Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Pryce also star. Pine promoted this one in a series of to-die-for outfits. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nMaster (2022)\n\nDirector: Mariama Diallo\n\nStars: Regina Hall, Amber Gray, Zoe Renee\n\nGenre: Drama/Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 67\n\nRegina Hall gives one of the best performances of her career in this horror movie about racism in the vein of Get Out. She plays a professor at a prestigious, predominately white New England university with a historical connection to the Salem Witch Trials and a legacy of racism that continues into the present. She, a Black first-year student (Zoe Renee), and another Black faculty member (Amber Gray) experience racism at the school as a literal haunting. It's an assured debut film from writer-director Mariama Diallo (a Yale graduate) that's adept at scares and social commentary. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]\n\nLucy and Desi (2022)\n\nDirector: Amy Poehler (yes, that Amy Poehler)\n\nStars: Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRating: NR\n\nMetacritic score: 75\n\nSure, Nicole Kidman played a great Lucille Ball in Aaron Sorkin's biopic Being the Ricardos (also on Amazon), but have you seen Lucille Ball play Lucille Ball? Amy Poehler directs this documentary looking at the lives of I Love Lucy's stars, both on set and at home. (Not to be confused with Lucy and Desi: A Home Movie, a 1993 documentary directed by Lucy and Desi's daughter, Lucie Arnaz, that is also on Amazon.) -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Protégé (2021)\n\nDirector: Martin Campbell\n\nStars: Maggie Q, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson\n\nGenre: Action, Thriller, Crime\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 48\n\nLook, if you tell me Maggie Q is starring in an action movie, I'm pretty much already on board. Here, she stars as a contract killer who vows to get brutal, bloody revenge on the people who killed her mentor (Samuel L. Jackson). Along the way, she becomes entangled in a game of cat and mouse with another ruthless criminal (Michael Keaton), and the two of them have such effortless chemistry it'll make you forget about the movie's shortcomings. The Protégé received middling reviews when it was released in theaters, but the fight scenes are well choreographed spectacles that make it the ideal watch when you want to turn your brain off. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nBook of Love (2022)\n\nDirector: Analeine Cal y Mayor\n\nStars: Sam Claflin, Verónica Echegui\n\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\n\nMetacritic score: 44\n\nIn this silly, sweet romantic comedy, Sam Claflin plays the kind of character Hugh Grant would've played back in the '90s: an uptight British romance author who learns that his latest (and not very good) novel has become a huge hit in Mexico, spurring him to travel there for a book tour. He only realizes after he arrives that the Spanish version of his book has actually been rewritten into a much spicier story that's way more interesting than his original story, all thanks to Maria (Verónica Echegui), the woman who translated it. This is the kind of classic rom-com premise that I can't help being utterly endeared by. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nI Want You Back (2022)\n\nFor fans of: Jenny Slate, Charlie Day, ill-advised schemes\n\nDirector: Jason Orley\n\nStars: Charlie Day, Jenny Slate, Gina Rodriguez, Manny Jacinto, Scott Eastwood\n\nGenre: Comedy, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 62\n\nIt's a Jenny Slate rom-com; it's a Charlie Day rom-com; it's a combination Jenny Slate-Charlie Day rom-com! And that means it's actually funny. I Want You Back pairs up two of Hollywood's most reliable chaos agents as a pair of strangers who bond over being recently dumped, then team up to win back their exes by destroying their new relationships. It's a solid romantic comedy that actually feels fresh, and who doesn't love a messy scheme? -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nA Hero (2021)\n\nFor fans of: International films, twisty morality tales\n\nDirector: Asghar Farhadi\n\nStars: Amir Jadidi, Mohsen Tanabandeh, Sahar Goldoost\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 82\n\nThe latest movie from Iranian filmmaker and two-time Oscar-winner Asghar Farhadi is this tense morality tale that's getting rave reviews from critics. It follows a man (Amir Jadidi) whose debt has landed him in jail, but a chance discovery of some gold coins while on furlough turns him into a national hero when he decides to return the bag of coins to its rightful owner. But beneath this seeming act of altruism lie questions of the man's true intentions. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nBeing the Ricardos (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Aaron Sorkin, backstage drama\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nStars: Nicole Kidman, Javier Bardem, J.K. Simmons, Nina Arianda, Tony Hale, Alia Shawkat\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, History\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 60\n\nEver want to see Aaron Sorkin stuff the mouths of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz with his wordy monologues? Sorkin wrote and directed Being the Ricardos, a biopic following I Love Lucy's Ball and Arnaz during a critical moment in their careers when Ball was accused of being a communist and the gossip rags wondered if their relationship was on the fritz. Early reviews are middling, but the draw here is watching Nicole Kidman as Ball and Javier Bardem as Arnaz, accompanied by J.K. Simmons, Tony Hale, Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development reunion!), and Nina Arianda. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nEncounter (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Aliens, bugs, aliens that look like bugs\n\nDirector: Michael Pearce\n\nStars: Riz Ahmed, Octavia Spencer, Rory Cochrane, Janina Gavankar\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi, Thriller\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 57\n\nRiz Ahmed follows up his Oscar-nominated turn in last year's The Sound of Metal with this paranoid sci-fi thriller that looks like a mix of Take Shelter and War of the Worlds. Ahmed plays Malik Khan, a decorated Marine who takes his two sons and goes AWOL to protect them from an alien threat – and military operatives who are trying to make sure the secret of that threat doesn't get out. It comes from writer-director Michael Pearce, who made the excellent 2017 psychological thriller Beast, so you can bet there will be some gut-punching twists and some meaty material for Ahmed to work with. The supporting cast includes Octavia Spencer, Janina Gavankar, and Rory Cochrane. -Liam Mathews [Trailer]\n\nThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Benedict Cumberbatch, cats\n\nDirector: Will Sharpe\n\nStars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Claire Foy, Andrea Riseborough, Toby Jones\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, History\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 63\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch plays the eccentric late 19th and early 20th century artist Louis Wain, known for his cat portraits, who falls for his sisters' governess (Claire Foy), in this fanciful biographical drama. Reviews for the film have been polite but rarely glowing — which is to be expected from a film created and directed by the dark and whimsical Will Sharpe (Flowers) — but it's got Benedict Cumberbatch and cats, so there are a lot of very online people who will certainly love it. Plus, Olivia Colman narrates. -Kelly Connolly [Trailer]\n\nEverybody's Talking About Jamie (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Musicals, sweet coming-of-age stories\n\nDirectors: Dan Gillespie Sells, Jonathan Butterell, and Tom MacRae\n\nStars: Max Harwood, Lauren Patel, Sarah Lancashire, Richard E. Grant, Ralph Ineson, Sharon Horgan\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, Comedy, Musical\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 62\n\nThis stage-to-screen musical film is destined to set your heart aflame -- provided you aren't a hateful malcontent -- as it tells the story of a 16-year-old high schooler's journey against bullying and toward realizing his dream to become a drag queen. It's been reviewed positively with critics likening it to Billy Elliott, and is exactly the feel-good salve you're desiring. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Big Sick (2017)\n\nFor fans of: Pre-Marvel Kumail Nanjiani, heartfelt rom-coms\n\nDirector: Michael Showalter\n\nStars: Kumail Nanjiani, Zoe Kazan, Ray Romano, Holly Hunter\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy, Romance\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 86\n\nThis romantic comedy is based on the actual love story between Kumail Nanjiani and his wife, Emily V. Gordon. Nanjiani plays the fictionalized version of himself while Zoe Kazan plays the fictionalized version of Emily, whose sudden diagnosis with adult-onset Still's disease — and the coma she falls into — throws a major wrench into their burgeoning relationship. While Kumail and Emily's story is undoubtedly the thing that drives The Big Sick, Ray Romano and Holly Hunter, who play Emily's parents, are the movie's grounding forces. You'll probably walk away from this mostly wishing they could adopt you. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nCinderella (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Pop songs, using the phrase \"so bad it's good\"\n\nDirector: Kay Cannon\n\nStars: Camila Cabello, Idina Menzel, Billy Porter, Minnie Driver, Nicholas Galitzine, Pierce Brosnan\n\nGenre: Fantasy, Comedy, Romance, Family, Musical\n\nRating: PG\n\nMetacritic score: 41\n\nDid we need another Cinderella re-telling? Probably not, but here's this movie anyway. In this latest version, Camila Cabello plays the fairy tale heroine, now going by simply \"Ella,\" as an aspiring fashion designer with big dreams the traditional society she lives in just isn't ready for. She gets help from her fairy godparent (Billy Porter), pushes back against her evil stepmother (Idina Menzel), and belts out a lot of classic pop tunes you already know, because this confounding movie is also a jukebox musical. If all of that doesn't turn you off, you're definitely ready for Cinderella, girlboss edition. It's not \"good,\" per se, but the baffling choices will certainly make you laugh. This could be a new camp classic in the making. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nAnnette (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Adam Driver, creepy puppet babies, A Star Is Born\n\nDirector: Leos Carax\n\nStars: Adam Driver, Marion Cotillard, Simon Helberg, Devyn McDowell\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance, Musical\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 67\n\nIf you care at all about film festivals, you've probably already heard of Annette, but if you haven't, listen carefully: This is a musical where Adam Driver, speaking in an even lower register than usual, plays Henry, a stand-up comedian who falls in love with Marion Cotillard's Ann, an opera singer. Their relationship declines after the birth of their mysteriously prodigious daughter Annette (who is played, confoundingly, by a puppet), and from there it becomes A Star Is Born by way of Marriage Story, but with a touch of surrealism. It's a fast-paced, hallucinatory rollercoaster that is certainly not for everyone, but will definitely have you walk away reeling. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Sequels, the way Borat says \"my wiiiiife\"\n\nDirector: Jason Woliner\n\nStars: Sacha Baron Cohen, Maria Bakalova\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 68\n\nIt's hard not to be wary when a beloved character is resurrected for a second go-around years later, but Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (full title Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan) is the rare sequel that works. Sacha Baron Cohen returns as Kazakh journalist Borat, and the international fame he's racked up since the first film has hurt more than helped his home country. In an attempt to redeem Kazakhstan, he returns back to America with the hopes of delivering a gift to former President Donald Trump (this movie was released right before the 2020 election, which does admittedly give some of the jokes a ten-second expiration date), but more compelling than all of that is Borat's legitimately sweet relationship with his daughter, Tutar (Maria Bakalova, who absolutely earned the Oscar nomination she received for her performance), who accompanies him on his mission, much to his chagrin. Honestly, the Rudy Giuliani stuff is the least interesting thing about this movie. It's good! Wa wa wee wa indeed. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nGet Duked! (2019)\n\nFor fans of: Trainspotting, psychedelics\n\nDirector: Ninian Doff\n\nStars: Eddie Izzard, Kate Dickie, Samuel Bottomley, Viraj Juneja, Rian Gordon, Lewis Gribben\n\nGenre: Action, Horror, Comedy, Music\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 69\n\nThis 2019 British black comedy film will easily remind you of Danny Boyle's bonkers classic Trainspotting, and it should: three Scottish teens with a knack for partying and doing drugs get into trouble. In Get Duked!, they're joined by a do-gooder and wander the Highlands to win the Duke of Edinborough Award, a survival challenge that turns boys into men, but they get stuck in the middle of a hunt-or-be-hunted situation with Eddie Izzard playing a psycho with a sniper rifle. Believe it or not, it gets weirder from there. Hilarious, ridiculous, and packed with social commentary, this would be regular viewing in weed smoke-filled dorm rooms of the late-'90s. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nThe Handmaiden (2016)\n\nFor fans of: Deception, but in a sexy way\n\nDirector: Chan-wook Park\n\nStars: Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri, Ha Jung-woo, Cho Jin-woong\n\nGenre: Drama, Thriller, Romance\n\nRating: Not rated\n\nMetacritic score: 84\n\nThe Handmaiden is one of those movies where every character is scamming another character, resulting in an exciting, dramatic thriller. It starts out as a film about a Korean con man (Ha Jung-woo) who devises a pan to seduce a Japanese heiress (Kim Min-hee) out of her inheritance. He enlists the help of a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) to act as the heiress' maid and confidant, tasking her with encouraging marriage between the two. Things begin to get more dangerous as deeper relationships develop in the messy, intertwined trio, which is all I want to say without actually spoiling the plot's genius twists. What you should know going in is that this movie was directed by Park Chan-wook, who gave us the brutal, bloody Oldboy, so you should expect some gruesome imagery. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nJolt (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Kate Beckinsale violently brutalizing goons\n\nDirector: Tanya Wexler\n\nStars: Kate Beckinsale, Bobby Cannavale, Laverne Cox, Stanley Tucci, Jai Courtney\n\nGenre: Action, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 48\n\nKate Beckinsale could have coasted in her career and played a lonely single mom who gets wooed by a hunk in various rom-coms, but thank god she's decided to be a butt-kicking action hero instead. In Jolt, she plays a woman with a unique condition that you'll only find in movies: If she doesn't electroshock herself with a custom-made harness, she loses her temper and starts to beat the sh-- out of everyone. Let's just say she doesn't always get the jolt she needs in time... a lot. There's also a scene in which she throws babies, and there are many swift kicks to the groin. Dumb fun, good time. -Tim Surette [Trailer]\n\nLate Night (2019)\n\nFor fans of: Comedies about going to work, Emma Thompson wearing suits\n\nDirector: Nisha Ganatra\n\nStars: Emma Thompson, Mindy Kaling, Max Casella, Hugh Dancy\n\nGenre: Comedy, Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 70\n\nMindy Kaling and Emma Thompson star in this extremely sweet-hearted movie, written by Kaling, about a talk show host (played by Thompson) whose popularity is waning as she ages. To help freshen up her writers' room and stop the network from replacing her, she hires a new, inexperienced writer (Kaling). Some of the jokes and job responsibilities admittedly delve a little too far into the inside baseball territory — a lot of importance is placed on Kaling's character becoming co-monologue writer, for example — but overall, Late Night is a fun movie about the lengths women have to go to in order to be taken seriously in their careers. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nOne Child Nation (2019)\n\nFor fans of: Learning about history without opening a book\n\nDirectors: Nanfu Wang, Zhang Lynn\n\nGenre: History, Documentary\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 85\n\nThis award-winning documentary will teach you all about a painful chapter in China's history via the one-child policy, which lasted from 1979 to 2015. Real people who lived through such a devastating period speak on their experiences, and the film delves into the damaging effects of government propaganda. Interestingly, One Child Nation is given a personal touch by co-director Nanfu Wang, who weaves stories of her own experience as a new mother in with the documentary's overall narrative. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nOne Night in Miami... (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Historical figures, monologues\n\nDirector: Regina King\n\nStars: Kingsley Ben-Adir, Eli Goree, Aldis Hodge, Leslie Odom Jr.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 83\n\nDirected by Regina King and based on a play by Kemp Powers, One Night in Miami... tells a dramatized account of a 1964 meeting between Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Muhammad Ali (Eli Goree), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.), and Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge). They spend the night in a Miami hotel room together and end up arguing for a good portion of it, about X's belief that Cooke has sold out by pandering to white audience with his music, and Ali's, referred to in the film as Cassius Clay, decision to convert to Islam and change his name. It's an interesting movie that succeeds in peeling back the curtain on four pretty untouchable cultural icons, revealing more about their anxieties, inner lives, and ambitions than the average biopic would. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nPink: All I Know So Far (2021)\n\nFor fans of: P!nk, acrobatics, good music\n\nDirector: Michael Gracey\n\nGenre: Biography, Music, Documentary\n\nRating: Not rated\n\nMetacritic score: 60\n\nWhat do you know about Pink? (Or, sorry, P!nk, as she apparently prefers to be addressed.) You're probably aware she has the voice of an angel, and that she really, really loves singing while performing aerial tricks, but you might not know much beyond that. This documentary is a highly personal look into her life as a mother. Expect a lot of very sweet scenes of her carting her young children around on tour, some emotional behind the scenes interviews, and to be blown away by her sheer vocal range. It's a fun watch for Pink devotees and new fans alike. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nSmall Axe (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Social justice stories, period pieces\n\nDirector: Steve McQueen\n\nStars: John Boyega, Letitia Wright, Michael Ward, Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn, Sheyi Cole, Kenyah Sandy\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic scores: 90, 95, 84, 77, 87\n\nSmall Axe is peak prestige television in that it's not actually television at all, but instead it's an anthology collection of five films directed by Steve McQueen. Every installment focuses on London's West Indian community in the years between 1969 and 1982, and each stars a great group of actors that includes John Boyega, Letitia Wright, Jack Lowden, and more. The stories don't overlap, but they all do a beautiful job of building out the world, and deal with issues and themes that impact the community, like police brutality, education, and what it means to be part of British society as a person of West Indian descent. On one hand, yes, five films is a lot to ask of viewers, but on the other, it just so happens that McQueen is an incredible director with a strong vision and every one is worth your time. If you only want to try one, give \"Lovers Rock,\" a romance centered around a reggae house party, a spin. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nSound of Metal (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Heavy metal band t-shirts, being emotional\n\nDirector: Darius Marder\n\nStars: Riz Ahmed, Olivia Cooke, Paul Raci\n\nGenre: Drama, Music\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 82\n\nI am of the opinion that Riz Ahmed gave the best performance of 2020 as a heavy metal drummer losing his hearing in Sound of Metal, and he very correctly earned an Oscar nomination for it. As Ruben, he explores the emotional trauma of sudden deafness — literally, as it plays out in the film, one minute he can hear perfectly, and the next everything is muffled — and the importance of finding community as he goes to live in a rural home for deaf recovering addicts in order, run by Joe (Paul Raci, also rightfully Oscar-nominated for his work). The way the film utilizes sound design is nothing short of incredible, and most notably, director Darius Marder cast many actual Deaf actors who help bring the story to life. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nSuspiria (2018)\n\nFor fans of: Witches, dancers, witchy dancers, Tilda Swinton\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nStars: Dakota Johnson, Tilda Swinton, Mia Goth\n\nGenre: Mystery, Thriller, Fantasy, Horror\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 64\n\nLuca Guadagnino directs this remake of the 1977 Dario Argento horror classic. Dakota Johnson stars as Susie, a seemingly fresh-faced dancer who travels from Ohio to Berlin to study at an elite dance academy and is quickly named head dancer. As Suspiria unfolds, and as more students and teachers are found dead or go missing entirely, and it becomes increasingly clear that something very sinister and supernatural is going on underneath the surface. Also, Tilda Swinton plays three roles, and for one of them she gets to dress up as an old man. It's kooky, it's campy, and it's also very, very scary. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nSylvie's Love (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Tessa Thompson, period romance\n\nDirector: Eugene Ashe\n\nStars: Tessa Thompson, Nnamdi Asomugha\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance, Music\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 74\n\nIf sweeping romance is your thing, Sylvie's Love should be your next watch. Set in New York City in 1962, Tessa Thompson stars as Sylvie, an aspiring TV producer who strikes up a summer romance with a saxophonist (Nnamdi Asomugha) who works at her father's record store. Life eventually drags them apart, and they both go on without each other for a while, only to reunite years later to find that their connection remains just as strong. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nThe Tomorrow War (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Independence Day, action broken up with passable humor\n\nDirector: Chris McKay\n\nStars: Chris Pratt, Yvonne Strahovski, J. K. Simmons, Betty Gilpin, Sam Richardson\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Drama, Thriller, War\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 45\n\nA muscly and brainy Chris Pratt stars as a scientist who, along with thousands of others, is zapped 30 years into the future to help future soldiers fight an alien invasion and save the human race. Yeah, if that insane logline doesn't turn you off then you should enjoy this popcorn flick that doesn't take itself too seriously — as evidenced by the many one-liners from comedians Sam Richardson, Mike Mitchell, and Mary Lynn Rajskub — but doesn't skimp on hours of soldiers unloading clips into grotesque aliens. It'll remind you of Starship Troopers without that sharp commentary. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nUncle Frank (2020)\n\nFor fans of: Road trips, Paul Bettany's American accent\n\nDirector: Alan Ball\n\nStars: Paul Bettany, Sophia Lillis, Peter Macdissi, Judy Greer, Steve Zahn\n\nGenre: Drama, Comedy\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 58\n\nThis movie is a little bit like if someone tried to update Little Miss Sunshine and focus primarily on Steve Carell's character, but in a good way. Beth (Sophia Lillis) moves from her small North Carolina hometown to good ol' New York City, and immediately crashes into her favorite uncle's life. She finds out that Frank (Paul Bettany) is gay and has been living with his boyfriend Wally (Peter Macdissi) for years, while successfully keeping it a secret from the rest of their family. And because this is a movie, the secret is of course put in jeopardy when Frank's father dies and he, Beth, and Wally embark on a road trip to attend the funeral. Uncle Frank balances its comedic and dramatic moments well, and your heart will ache during the flashbacks to Frank's adolescence, where he was first confronted with his family's homophobia. Plus, an always perfect Judy Greer co-stars. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nVal (2021)\n\nFor fans of: Intimate portraits of '80s icons\n\nDirectors: Leo Scott, Ting Poo\n\nGenre: Documentary\n\nRating: R\n\nMetacritic score: 73\n\nVal Kilmer gets the autobiographical treatment in this intimate documentary about his life and career. Kilmer lends his own home movies he's taken over the years to the film — which includes videos from the set of Batman Forever, and footage of younger versions of Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon just hanging out — and provides a look at his struggle with throat cancer, from which he's still recovering and has left him using a prosthesis in order to speak. It's more revealing than the standard celebrity doc. -Allison Picurro [Trailer]\n\nThe Vast of Night (2019)\n\nFor fans of: That '80s and '90s sci-fi feel, first-time directors making a huge splash\n\nDirector: Andrew Patterson\n\nStars: Sierra McCormick, Jake Horowitz\n\nGenre: Sci-Fi, Drama, Mystery, Thriller, Fantasy\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nMetacritic score: 84"
