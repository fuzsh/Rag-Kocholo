        "text": "Date and Time (Central): 11/17/2022, 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM\n\nThis webinar will look at the Adam Matthew content available Rice University. These databases of primary sources can be used in humanities subjects covering disciplines from ethnomusicology to Indigenous journalism to the history of medicine in warfare. We'll also be looking in depth at Research Methods Primary Sources, the new online learning tool for primary source literacy that can be used in classroom-based and online teaching, as well as for independent study. The database includes how-to guides, video interviews and over 140 case studies that demonstrate how to analyse, approach and interact with primary source material.\n\nWe'll be walking everyone through the different tools available, as well as some different user pathways through the material in practical use.\n\nThere will be a chance to ask questions towards the end, where we can discuss specific questions about the collections, or about research and teaching."
