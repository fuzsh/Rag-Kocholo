        "text": "Other Notes All Wynn (of Gwydir) Papers are numbered in sequence. However, the material included in this resource is made up of two collections namely, the Panton Group comprising 19 volumes, and the Sir John Williams Group comprising 8 volumes. As an example Panton Group N.L.W MS. 9051 E. contains items 1-170 (with gaps) covering the period 1515 -1596. These gaps are filled by items to be found in the Sir John Williams Group N.L.W. ADD. MS. 464 E. covering the period 1519-1603. T. The Calendar of Wynn Papers, 1515-1690 will also provide assistance to researchers to locate particular items. The Calendar of Wynn Papers, 1515-1690 includes 2891 documents. Of these, 2806 are in the National Library, and 58 at Cardiff. Those which belong to Sir John Williamsâ€™s collection are distinguished by having the shelf number attached, for example, Add. MS. 466E. When the entry is made from a printed or other source, the references are to the present owner, or to the printed volume in which the document appears. All the others belong to the Panton group; the sequence numbers indicate their place in the National Library."
