        "text": "“Creative and poignant.” “Compulsively readable.” “I was hooked.”\n\n“Wow, wow, wow,” one judge wrote. “I loved this so much.”\n\nThose were just some of the glowing comments from judges of the fourth annual Nonprofit News Awards, or INNYs, run by the Institute for Nonprofit News to honor excellence in journalism, leadership and community service.\n\nINN will announce the winners of the awards — which are open to the more than 450 newsrooms in the INN Network — at a celebration in Atlanta on Sept. 18.\n\nNonprofit newsrooms regularly produce impactful journalism and earn the accolades to prove it — as seen with the 2024 Pulitzer Prize winners. But what sets the INNYs apart is that they reflect the broad spectrum of nonprofit news organizations, from small startups to well-established outlets with multi-million-dollar budgets. The INNYs go beyond traditional award categories like “best investigative journalism” to recognize what differentiates nonprofit news — values like collaboration, innovation and impact.\n\nThis year, the finalists’ work competed among the largest-ever pool of entries: 626, up nearly 40% from 2023. A total of 75 judges from a variety of news organizations — 25 percent more than last year — selected the finalists.\n\nEven in this more competitive context, some news outlets stood out, becoming finalists for multiple awards — or even, as in the case of the California-based bilingual news magazine Voices of Monterey Bay having two finalist entries in the same category (Best Investigative Journalism, Micro Division).\n\nJudges praised many of the entries for powerful narrative storytelling, compelling graphics, and nuanced reporting.\n\n“A tremendous amount of reporting went into this project,” one judge wrote, “and it’s such a fine example of why we need high quality nonprofit journalism!”\n\nFinalists in the Journalism categories\n\nBest Investigative Journalism Award\n\nHonors a single story or series that uncovered significant and impactful news based on the reporters’ own investigation and which advances and serves the public interest.\n\nMicro Division\n\nTucson Sentinel, Pima Sheriff’s Dep’t failed to notify family of dead inmate for 2.5 months, Natalie Robbins and Dylan Smith\n\nVoices of Monterey Bay, Pain, death and secrets at the Monterey County Jail, Royal Calkins\n\nVoices of Monterey Bay, Suspicious King City traffic death was never truly investigated, Royal Calkins\n\nSmall Division\n\nInvestigateWest, The Cruelest Lie: How Idaho allows rape, abuse and cruelty to flourish inside the state’s youth residential facilities, Wilson Criscione\n\nThe Appeal, Locked In, Priced Out, Elizabeth Weill-Greenberg and Ethan Corey\n\nThe Garrison Project, Baltimore police unit under fire for deadly shootings, questionable stops, Brandon Soderberg\n\nThe Journal, What happened inside Wichita’s emergency winter homeless shelter, Stefania Lugli\n\nThe Lund Report, University of Oregon Catalyst Journalism Project, Oregon Public Broadcasting, Unsupported: Addiction prevention in Oregon classrooms, Emily Green, Elizabeth Yost and Lillian Mongeau Hughes\n\nMedium Division\n\nInjustice Watch, Exploited Elders, David Jackson\n\nNew Bedford Light, Blue Harvest stories\n\nThe Connecticut Mirror, How the battle for absentee ballots defined the Bridgeport election, Andrew Brown, José Luis Martínez, Katy Golvala and Dave Altimari\n\nType Investigations, WWNO, Louisiana Law Gives Judges a Financial Incentive to Set High Bail and Secure Convictions, Garrett Hazelwood\n\nLarge Division\n\nCalMatters, California’s Risky Bet on Rehab, Byrhonda Lyons\n\nReveal, Associated Press, Hidden Confessions of the Mormon Church, Michael Rezendes and Jason Dearen\n\nThe Marshall Project, The New York Times, How New York’s Abusive Guards Keep Their Jobs, Joseph Neff, Alysia Santo, Tom Meagher and Ilica Mahajan\n\nThe Texas Tribune, Open Campus, Turmoil at Texas A&M University System, Kate McGee and James Barragán\n\nThe Trace, Shot by a Civilian Wielding a Police Gun, Champe Barton, Alain Stephens, Chris Hacker, Stephen Stock, Amy Corral and Nicole Vap\n\nInsight Award for Explanatory Journalism\n\nHonors a single story or a series of explanatory reporting that provides insight and understanding of a significant and complex subject.\n\nMicro Division\n\nBoulder Reporting Lab, Hidden hazard: Boulder’s million-ton coal ash problem has no local watchdog\n\nCalifornia Health Report, Families caring for children with disabilities, Claudia Boyd-Barrett and Hannah Hough\n\nConecta Arizona, Voto extranjero — Mexicanos se preparan para una elección histórica en Arizona, Maritza L.
