        "text": "Archiving in a post-custodial world: an audiovisual perspective\n\nAbstract\n\nProjects such as the Society of American Archivists’ (SAA) The Liberated Archive signal “that perhaps the mainstream profession is turning away from the notion of archives and archivists as unequivocal custodians, authority figures, and de facto gatekeepers of the historical record and moving toward an archival praxis that is collaborative, empathetic, and more fully self-aware of its limitations and strengths” (Becerra-Licha, 2017). Nevertheless, ‘archive’ as a word is still generally not very popular, even less so as a concept. Researchers may complain of archivists as gatekeepers who have created red tape and laborious processes that may appear at best slow, at worst obstructive. Others may imagine dark and cold basements with locked down shelves of books, manuscripts, papers, photographs, and maps. This is arguably especially so in the field of sound archives. In our contemporary world, recorded sound is part of our daily life. Over the past 140 years, since the invention of sound recording technology, Recorded sound is ubiquitous, having become easier and more affordable to make and consume digital sound recordings. The recording industry was very quick to move into the digital era, creating digital spaces that listeners readily inhabit, where they expect to be able to listen to what they want, when they want (and preferably for free). This paper draws on experiences in the British Library’s Sound Archive, primarily in the World and Traditional Music Collection and with reference to the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive, to consider methods and best practice in progressing such ‘postcustodial’ archival imperatives.\n\nIntroduction\n\n…perhaps the mainstream profession is turning away from the notion of archives and archivists as unequivocal custodians, authority figures, and de facto gatekeepers of the historical record and moving toward an archival praxis that is collaborative, empathetic, and more fully self-aware of its limitations and strengths. (Becerra-Licha, 2017)\n\nAnthony Seeger and Shubha Chaudhuri in their paper ‘The contributions of reconfigured audiovisual archives to sustaining traditions’ (2015) talk of ‘misconceptions about archives and some of their shortcomings’ (p21) namely ‘that they are buildings, that they are inaccessible, that they are possessive about their collections and that they are about the past’ (p23). It is not only audiovisual archives that are tarred with these brushes. As Sofia Becerra-Licha (2017:90) points out:\n\n‘When archivists are asked about some of the primary stereotypes they encounter in daily interactions and media coverage, “dusty boxes,” materials waiting to be “discovered,” and “repositories for the old, the obsolete, and the analog” are often cited’ (ibid.).[1]\n\nAs if that were not enough, Becerra-Licha further refers to the ‘reductive notion that archives and archivists are passive, reactive, and static’ [my emphasis] (ibid.), while Seeger and Chaudhuri encouragingly foresee that ‘in the hands of motivated and innovative people capable of collaborating with one another, archival collections can contribute to sustaining performing arts in multiple important ways’ (my emphasis) (2015:22). Both these comments suggest that it is people who can, who need to, and, to an extent as we shall see in this paper, who are, helping to turn the profession ‘toward an archival praxis that is collaborative, empathetic and more fully self-aware’.\n\nTechnology is key. Not only can items be digitally preserved using new technology, but they can also be more easily returned to the originating communities and, where appropriate, disseminated very broadly. It does require human beings to make the most of the opportunities technology offers, however. Archives are thus more than institutions with items that need taking care of on shelves or in digital stores with the help of technology. They are also groups of people – archivists, curators - who decide what to acquire, how to document, what to digitally preserve, what and how to disseminate, and so forth. These groups of people do not work in isolation – original donors, original recorded communities, researchers and other users, internal institutional imperatives, external social, political and economic influences all play a part - and these people do not all have to be in a single institution or location. As Seeger and Chaudhuri point out, the archival functions (acquisition, organization, preservation, dissemination) can be ‘decentralised’ (2015:22). A collaborative, empathetic, self-aware archival praxis requires a professional culture change, not just a technological one.\n\nIn a digital world where vast swathes of populations worldwide expect to be able to access audio, especially music, easily, quickly, for free, from anywhere and on the latest state of the art mobile technologies, we can see how the aforementioned popular misconceptions are particularly detrimental to archives of audiovisual content.\n\nIt is worth noting that, as with many professions, audiovisual archiving responds and reacts to consumer imperatives. The formats we have used for recording and archiving, for example, have largely been dictated by the audio publishing industry and the public that consumes the output. As the global online community realises the potential of technology for their own means - whether it is discovering rare recordings on YouTube or making recordings/taking photographs on their phones to share via social media to create personal collections – the word ‘archive’ as both a noun and a verb appears to be entering common parlance. This imperative clashes with real-life experience of professional archives and perhaps creates the requirement for the profession to keep up, to remain relevant in this emerging context.[2]\n\nWhile available technology for digital preservation and dissemination represents one of the great audiovisual archival ‘strengths’, certainly copyright restrictions represent major ‘limitations’. Through collaboratively-minded and empathetic individuals leading initial research that ends with deposited materials – the ethnomusicologists, anthropologists and other ethnographers – and leading archiving activities, whether large and far from the field or small and local to it, a postcustodial approach to archiving begins to seem possible.\n\nThe Society of American Archivists’ (SAA) 2017 annual meeting focussed on ‘The Liberated Archive’ offering ‘a forum for envisioning and implementing a community-based approach to archives’.[2] This was a practical ‘hands-on’ event that aimed to go ‘beyond good intentions to explore how archivists might partner with the public to repurpose the archive as a site of social transformation and radical inclusion’. Along with the necessary sessions on ‘MARC for Archival Description’ (Kathy Wisser), ‘Tool Integrations; From Pre-SIP to DIP’ (Max Eckard) and educational papers on ‘Navigating the digital maze of visual material description and access’(moderated by Deborah Rice) , much of the content revolved around ethics and sensitivities, serving community needs, social media and reuse. This evidences a change in approach and assumptions within the archiving profession.[3]\n\nIndeed, in the context of postmodernism and the rapid emergence of the so-called Information Age, traditional archival practice has undergone – is undergoing – basic change in some of its ideas and methods. Postmodernism offers the opportunity to broaden our thinking to make space for diverse voices and for self-referential approaches, challenging assumptions of institutional authority – assumptions held often on the part of the archive and of the public/community. At the same time, technology provides opportunities to reach out, not only to provide broader access, but for interactivity and inclusivity – to gather and share community knowledge in an equal, participatory and collaborative way. The world we inhabit today thus requires this paradigm shift, which is being characterised within the archives profession as a shift towards a ‘postcustodial’ approach.\n\nFor similar reasons we see this shift in the discipline of ethnomusicology as well. For present purposes I argue that the shift is being advanced, for example, through so-called Applied Ethnomusicology ‘within growing tendencies, across the social sciences, arts and humanities, towards the usefulness of academic work’, [4] through Jeff Todd Titon’s ‘Sustainable Music’[5] theories and debates and through the emergence of ‘music and development’ fields of study. [6] This paper explores what a postcustodial approach looks like for the audiovisual archives profession within an ethnomusicological context in the 21st century. It draws on experiences in the British Library’s Sound Archive, primarily in the World and Traditional Music Collection, and references the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive, to consider methods and best practice to capitalise on strengths and overcome limitations in archiving in a postcustodial world.\n\nWhat do we mean by postcustodial?\n\nAccording to Terry Cook (Cook 1997)[7], since the mid-20th Century, Australian archives theorist, Peter Scott, in reinterpreting the archival concept of provenance through a focus on description, ‘revolutionised’ changes to ‘archival theory generally’ by developing an approach\n\nfor describing multiple interrelationships between numerous creators and numerous series of records… In effect, Scott shifted the entire archival description enterprise from a static cataloguing mode to a dynamic system of multiple interrelationships….. Scott’s essential contribution was to break through…the whole mindset of “physicality” of archives…. In this way, as is finally being acknowledged, Peter Scott is the founder of the “postcustodial” revolution in world archival thinking. Although he worked in a paper world, his insights are now especially relevant for archivists facing electronic records, where… the physicality of the record has little importance compared to its multi-relational contexts of creation and contemporary use. (Ibid.)\n\nFor Cook\n\n[t]his new paradigm for archives replaces the profession's traditional intellectual focus on the physical record - that thing which is under our actual physical custody in archives - with a renewed focus on the context, purpose, intent, interrelationships, functionality, and accountability of the record, its creator, and its creation processes, wherever these occur. (Ibid.)\n\nSome 25-30 years later, Gerald Ham’s article entitled ‘Archival Strategies for the post-custodial era’ (1981)[8] is, with hindsight, a remarkable piece that further develops Scott’s ‘revolution’. This may be the first use of the term postcustodial: Ham talks of a ‘new period in archival history, a period I call the post-custodial era’ (p207).\n\nDuring the custodial era, the mass of records we contended with was relatively small; the technology of records creation, storage, and retrieval was fairly simple; and we assumed a passive role in shaping the documentary record. Concern with the uniqueness of the material in our care, and the normal expectations of our custodial role, tended to make us uncommonly introspective, preoccupied with our own gardens, and too little aware of the larger historical and social landscape that surrounded us. Our introspective proclivity has isolated us from one another and fragmented our work, obscuring the advantages of cooperation and shared ideas. Our ethos also has made us excessively proprietary toward our holdings, and though the technology for resource sharing has long been available, this attitude has hindered our enjoyment of its benefits. (p207)\n\nAlthough the technology Ham refers to is, by today’s standards, rudimentary – referring to ‘linking the computer to long-distance telephone to form an on-line, interactive telecommunications network’ and the potential for using ‘facsimile document transmission for traditional material such as letters photographs, and maps’ – Ham’s insight into the possibilities such technology offered for ‘cooperation and shared ideas’ is progressive. We can see how, with the right ‘mindset’, technology can assist in focussing ‘on the context, purpose, intent, interrelationships, functionality, and accountability of the record, its creator, and its creation processes, wherever these occur’. Of course in 2019, technology has moved on unimaginably, yet, nearly 40 years after Ham’s writing, perhaps the ‘ethos’ of our profession has not.\n\nThe SAA’s glossary suggests that a postcustodial theory of archives is ‘the idea that archivists will no longer physically acquire and maintain records, but that they will provide management oversight for records that will remain in the custody of the record creators’, and notes that ‘[t]he postcustodial theory shifts the role of the archivists from a custodian of inactive records in a centralized repository to the role of a manager of records that are distributed in the offices where the records are created and used’.[9]\n\nThis raises a number of discussion points that this paper will seek to address. In this section the discussion points are introduced in a general way. The next section interrogates the issues for how they relate to audiovisual archives and ethnomusicology.\n\nCommunity-based / public-facing\n\nJarrett Drake suggests a postcustodial approach means seeing archiving as a ‘social endeavour’ in which [‘w]e should think about options for less emphasis on research needs and more on community-driven and public-facing needs’. [10]This points to more than community engagement and user-focussed activities such as events, exhibitions and access: it potentially points also to community management of records and their contents – even be they digital files: their storage, their descriptive metadata and the permitted uses of the contents, as this responsibility is redistributed from a central repository.\n\nThe question of provenance\n\nAs a foundational aspect of archives, the principle of provenance provides a useful example of how the paradigm shift might play out. The SAA definition of provenance is ‘the origin or source of something or information regarding the origins, custody and ownership of an item or collection’. [11] The principle requires ‘that records of different origins (provenance) be kept separate to preserve their context’ – that is the context of the creation of the records. What about the context of the creation of the content, however?\n\nAn equitable model\n\nA postcustodial approach challenges established power relations, intentional and unintentional, between the archive and the communities represented in archived materials. In this equitable model, physical items remain in their home locations and the archival partner forms capacity-building partnerships to fund and train for digitisation, cataloguing, access activities. A surrogate of the preserved collection could be incorporated into the archive who could be given permission to disseminate online. In such a way, part of an archive’s role might be to connect to content rather than to collect it.\n\nThe ‘equitable model’ may also be characterised as a shift from ‘custody to collaboration’ that ‘departs from the traditional theory and practice of acquisition based on physical custody of records and recognizes that information is not always contingent on its original physical form‘.[12]\n\nThis more equitable archiving approach is attractive on many levels. It has some practical challenges however: on a project by project basis aspects of the approach may be achievable, but funding normally is short-term, many home location institutions are unstable in terms of long-term funding and there often is a high turnover of staff. All this makes makes it difficult to establish long-term relationships, remembering that in archival terms, long-term means in perpetuity. ‘Equitable partnerships, especially given a national history of betrayal and exploitation, depend on trust built through long-term, personal relationships’ (Alpert-Abrams, 2018).[13] This issue of trust-building through ‘long-term, personal relationships’ is, of course, core to the ethnomusicological method, in a postmodern and postcolonial theoretical context.\n\nFrom custodian to steward\n\n‘The post-custodial paradigm of archives re-positions archivists from institutional custodians of archival records to stewards of records in their places of creation or use’ thereby ‘disaggregat[ing] archives praxis from physical custody of records and (re)locat[ing] the work of the archivist to be neither only the institutional repository nor the site of records creation, but rather a third space that crosses borders between the two and can function in both but belongs wholly to neither’.[14]\n\nThe distinction between custodianship and stewardship is perhaps blurred. ‘Custody’, according to the SAA glossary, means ‘care and control, especially for security and preservation, guardianship’. A note is added to the effect that ‘custody does not necessarily imply legal title to the materials’. The glossary has no entry for stewardship. A more general google search, however, reveals (on yourdictionary.com) that it refers to the ‘taking care of something like a large household, the arrangements for a group or the resources of a community’. The same source provides an example of stewardship, namely, ‘the act of making wise use of the natural resources provided by the earth’.[15] This brings to mind Jeff Todd Titon’s work on ‘music as a sustainable biocultural resource’ in which he employs the language of\n\neconomic development and energy conservation’ [and the] ‘commonsense response … to manage the resources wisely, bringing individuals and institutions together out of a sense that squandering resources diminishes the quality of life in the present and impoverishes it in the future’. (Titon 2009:5)\n\nOf course archives are about conservation and preservation, but the postcustodial approach invites us to explore these acts in relation to content rather than physical artefact, and in relation to sustainability of knowledge in/of the content.\n\nRecords Continuum Model\n\nJust as Jarrett Drake describes archiving as a social endeavour, so the Records Continuum Model, expounded by Frank Upward, Sue McKemmish and Livia Lacovino in the 1990s, declares that ‘a record (as well as records, collections and archives) are … part of a larger social, cultural, political, legal and archival process’ and that ‘it is these contexts that are vital to understanding the role, value and evidential qualities of records in and across spacetime (past, present and potential future).’[16] Indeed it is these contexts that offer sustainability of the content held in archival records, that allow for successful stewardship by ‘making wise use of the [musical] resources provided by the [earth’s peoples]’.\n\nThe postcustodial challenge for audiovisual archives and ethnomusicology\n\nOwnership, proprietary rights and provenance\n\nWe are challenged to consider issues of proprietary rights and ownership as we review a paradigm shift within the ethnomusicology audiovisual archiving profession to a postcustodial one. An institution such as UCLA’s Ethnomusicology Archive, founded in 1960 ‘[t]o acquire significant collections in the field of ethnomusicology’ and ‘[t]o preserve sound and audiovisual recordings in the field of ethnomusicology for future generations’[17] offers a useful example to explore this issue. One of the Archive’s core purposes is ‘[to] serve as the official repository for UCLA Department of Ethnomusicology audiovisual materials’. This includes archiving materials produced as part of faculty research activities as well as ‘over 50 years’ worth of audio and video recordings of the department’s famed concerts and also of lectures by legendary scholars and performers….’ .[18] So recordings by Mantle Hood in Indonesia in 1957-8 are included, as are those by Timothy Rice made during his fieldwork in Bulgaria from the 1970s to early 2000s. It makes sense for UCLA to archive these, and to own them, at least the physical structures (tapes or digital files): these collections document the department’s history and scholarly activity – the Archive documents UCLA just as much as it documents Indonesian or Bulgarian music performances.\n\nIt also makes sense to organise the collections according to traditional archival views of provenance, at least it makes sense from the archivists’ point of view. This way we can trace more easily how the items came to the archive so that the donation conditions can be upheld over time.\n\nThis basic principle of provenance is upheld, in my experience, in most ethnomusicology audiovisual archives. We see at the British Library, for example, the Klaus Wachsmann Collection, the Ken Gourlay Collection and the Peter Cooke Collection as separate entities, with separate shelfmarks, leading to separation on catalogues, separation in access and sometimes elaborate taxonomies and ontologies developed within the context of the individual collections. What if we were to consider the origin, the provenance, of the item to be the original community and not the recordist/researcher who made the recording and then decided to deposit it in an archive? One might then consider the provenance being a culture group so that, for example, all the Karamajong recordings in the three Ugandan collections mentioned above are of the same provenance. This might better preserve the cultural context of the content.\n\nThe traditional use of provenance in archives makes little sense for the user, who may simply be looking for recordings of a particular genre or instrument or by a particular performer, of a particular community, in a particular location. This user may not care whether it was Mantle Hood, Klaus Wachsmann or Ken Gourlay that recorded the performance. Indeed in a modern online community, they may not care whether the item is at UCLA Ethnomusicology or the British Library or anywhere else. In this case it is the content that is important and the context of the content, not the physical structure and the context of its storage. The user requires the archive to be less ‘introspective [and] preoccupied with our own gardens’ and to look outwards towards the needs of users whether they are of the 21st Century online community and/or the originating communities of the content itself.\n\nIn order that users, whoever they are, can find content, catalogues need to be available, accurate and meaningful. The best sources of accurate information are the members of the communities whose performances and traditions are represented in the content - the cultural heritage communities (Barwick 2004 in Landau and Topp Fargion 2012:126) - and it is they who can best describe the meaning and contexts. Taking archival materials out and reconnecting cultural heritage communities with them is thus hugely impactful in obtaining accurate and meaningful descriptive metadata. The archive does not have to own the responsibility of creating descriptions: in a postcustodial model, this can be ‘decentralised’.\n\nIncorporating such information into online catalogues and access platforms, naturally with attributions, helps to surface locally held knowledge on a global level. Often expertise or funding is not available at local community level and the institutional archive is responsible for making the descriptions and the content itself available. The collaboration between archives and cultural heritage communities to create descriptions and to make these available in partnership is a step in the right direction in terms of addressing power imbalances. A step in the direction of an equitable archiving model.\n\nWhilst the archive might own the physical structure then, they do not own the knowledge of the content. Nor do they own the intellectual property. Research through reconnecting content with communities opens up channels of communication between the repository and the owners of the content through which due diligence can be done and permitted uses established. In partnership with the community their content and their knowledge can be made available in public-facing activities (online, events, exhibitions, publications) – the responsibility for legal and ethical use of the archival content becomes a collaborative one.\n\nFurthermore, connecting with cultural heritage communities opens up the possibility for the content itself to be housed within closer reach. This is especially important where the internet may not yet be reliable or fast enough for effective audiovisual access. Recordings can thus be used in local educational and/or creative activities and the knowledge of them can circulate and recirculate ‘in and across spacetime’.\n\nFurther still, in partnerships with communities the archives are more easily able to disseminate content in what I like to call inhabited spaces, meaning, generally, online spaces where users expect to be able to find relevant content. For music content this might be YouTube or Spotify. The UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive, for example, has a presence on the Internet Archive.[19] With their mission to ‘provide Universal Access to All Knowledge’[20], the Internet Archive, I would argue, is one of those inhabited spaces. If dissemination to such spaces is acceptable to the communities, and it comes with knowledge provided by the community itself, the activity of such wide dissemination can be very powerful in preserving knowledge and giving voice to sometimes politically inaudible groups of people.\n\nParticipatory archiving and research\n\nAccording to Kate Theimer in her presentation ‘The Future of Archives is Participatory: A New Mission for Archives’ (2014)[21] the definition of a participatory archive is ‘an organization, site or collection in which people other than the archives professionals contribute knowledge or resources resulting in increased understanding about archival materials, usually in an online environment’. This might be through use of technologies and concepts such as crowdsourcing and social media but it could equally be offline through ethnomusicological research projects, some of which are described above. I would argue that the sorts of approaches to archiving described above as ‘postcustodial’ fit the participatory model.\n\nIt strikes me that Theimer’s definition could work as a definition for ethnomusicology itself, in which ‘a research project in which people other than the research professionals contribute knowledge or resources resulting in increased understanding about music’. When we as ethnomusicologists conduct the research ‘for [our] own research purposes’ (Topp Fargion 2009:75-94) the knowledge contributed by ‘people other than the research professional’ remains locked within the limited scope of the research outputs. When we consider our work in a participatory way, and then work with an archive in a participatory way, our research becomes participatory research set to bring about change and the postcustodial archiving approach becomes attainable. Indeed we are all archivists now (Landau and Topp Fargion 2012).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ethnomusicology archivists’ role in the postcustodial model is, therefore, in a community-driven, equitable collaboration with communities, often via researching ethnomusicologists, to act as steward of their content, their biocultural resources, for their safeguarding into the future. The postcustodial model challenges us as archivists to actively look outwards, to not always claim proprietary rights to holdings and knowledge about them, to accept that contents and knowledge can be shared collaboratively with other institutions and community groups or organisations.\n\nThe postcustodial model challenges the very definition of the archival imperative to preserve, for knowledge is arguably best preserved through being kept alive and relevant ‘in and across spacetime’. Through participatory research and archiving, wide distribution using appropriate available technologies, and active reconnection of communities with their archived content, I argue that this can be best achieved. A variety of activities beyond taking care of stuff on shelves in dark basements present themselves for the postcustodial ethnomusicological archivist.\n\nReferences\n\n[1]Becerra-Licha, Sofía. 2017. ‘Participatory and Post-Custodial Archives as Community Practice’.
