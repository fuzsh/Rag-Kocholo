An independent company, SAGE has principal offices in Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.\n\nAdam Matthew will continue to operate under its existing management from its offices in Marlborough, Wiltshire, and Chicago, Ill. SAGE sales representatives will work closely with the Adam Matthew team to bring the portfolio to an even wider international audience, building on the experience gained working as the Adam Matthew agent in the Middle East since January 2012."
