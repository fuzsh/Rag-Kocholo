        "text": "Tulane Libraries recently gained perpetual access to all pre-2016 digital collections offered by the venerable publisher Adam Matthew. This includes 77 collections, containing more than 12 million pages of content, valued at more than $3.4 million. The access came through a group-purchase arrangement negotiated with the publisher by the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL), of which Tulane is a member.\n\nWe already owned a number of these collections from previous purchases over the past dozen years or so, since these are very high-quality collections. However, the ASERL group purchase still provides Tulane students and faculty with a large number of new collections, and fills some gaps with later additions.\n\nThe Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL) is a membership organization serving 38 research libraries in 11 southeastern US states, created to develop innovative partnerships, exchange information about best practices and emerging issues, and improve services to the students, faculty, and communities they serve.\n\nAdam Matthew is an academic publisher based in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has been an independent subsidiary of Sage Publications since 2012. The company specializes in online primary source databases and curated collections for the humanities and social sciences.\n\nA full list of Adam Matthew digital collections included in the group purchase is provided below. See the libraryâ€™s Databases list for links to these and our other Adam Matthew digital collections. Those links are upgraded for off-campus access."
