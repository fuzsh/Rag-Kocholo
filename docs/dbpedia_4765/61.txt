Abstract

It is known that using larger byte--sizes to access memory usually results in faster computations of checksum algorithms. This paper proposes two different ways to use larger byte--sizes to improve the performance of the OSI checksum. First, an algorithm is presented that computes the 8--bit checksum using 16-bit integers. It is shown that this algorithm yields a 5 to 20 percent performance improvement on many architectures. Second, the benefits of expanding the basic computation unit of the OSI checksum algorithm to 16--bits integers is considered. This change can yield an additional performance improvement of up to 50% and greatly extended error detection properties, although it is incompatible with the current standard. The measurements of these algorithms are compared with some taken of checksums in common use, such as IP and XNS&dagger;.

When the CRC and TCP checksum disagree

Traces of Internet packets from the past two years show that between 1 packet in 1,100 and 1 packet in 32,000 fails the TCP checksum, even on links where link-level CRCs should catch all but 1 in 4 billion errors. For certain situations, the rate of ...
