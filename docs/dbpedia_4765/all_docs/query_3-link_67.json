        "text": "Manager: Checksum feature is enabled\n\nThis setting enables (check box selected) or disables (check box deselected) the Checksum Support features throughout DIVArchive. The default setting is enabled (selected).\n\nManager: Default Checksum Type\n\nThere are several checksum algorithms supported by the system including MD2, MD5, SHA, SHA1, MDC2, and RIPEMD160. DIVArchive uses MD5 as the default checksum.\n\nEach checksum type is associated with an ID Number. you use the menu list to change the default type and select the type of checksum desired.\n\nThe ID Number identifies the Checksum Type requested in the configuration as follows:\n\nMD2 is ID Number 1\n\nMD5 is ID Number 2\n\nSHA is ID Number 3\n\nSHA-1 is ID Number 4\n\nMDC2 is ID Number 5\n\nRIPEMD160 is ID Number 6\n\nManager: Number of retries following failed checksum\n\nThis parameter sets the number of times the system will retry the operation after a failed checksum. The default setting is one retry. Enter the number of retries allowable for your data and system in the Manager: Number of retries following failed checksum field. Oracle recommends leaving this setting at the default value.\n\nManager: Select different drive per retry on failed checksum\n\nThis parameter distinguishes whether the retry (after a failed checksum) is attempted on the same drive (check box deselected), or if the system should attempt the operation using a different drive (check box selected). The default setting for this parameter uses the same drive (check box deselected).\n\nExternal Checksum Source\n\nYou must use the External Checksum Source (Yes option) for the system to read the Checksum from the external source providing the file. This initiates an immediate checksum calculation to compare the checksums and verify the initial transfer. Selecting the No option disables Genuine Checksum support from external sources.\n\nChecksum Type\n\nYou use the menu list to select the Checksum Type. All supported checksum types are listed. The Checksum Type and GC Mode (see the following description) must match the settings implemented at the Source.\n\nThe Genuine Checksum is only used for the first verification. Therefore, the checksum type selected is only used once and then discarded. Beyond the initial use of the selected checksum type (after this transfer), the default type is used.\n\nGC Mode\n\nYou use the menu list to select the Genuine Checksum Mode. This notifies the Actor of the format of the files that contain the checksum data.\n\nVerify Following Archive (VFA)\n\nWhen Verify Following Archive (VFA) is turned on (check box selected), performing the initial transfer from the source results in a read-back operation. Therefore, the data is read twice for verification. After the data is read twice, the two checksums are compared. If they are the same then verification is complete. If they are not identical then verification has failed.\n\nVerify Following Archive is not compatible with Genuine Checksum (GC) or complex objects. There is no need to use VFA when GC is being used because the checksum is already verified. The Genuine Checksum must be turned off to gain access to the VFA check box. If GC is turned on, the check box will be grayed out and not selectable.\n\nVerify Following Restore (VFR)\n\nWhen Verify Following Restore (VFR) is turned on (check box selected), performing the final transfer to the destination results in a read-back operation. Therefore, the data is read twice for verification. After the data is read twice, the two checksums are compared. If they are the same then verification is complete. If they are not identical then verification has failed. The setting of GC has no bearing on the VFR setting.\n\nVerify Following Restore is not compatible with complex objects or the -axf option.Verify Following Restore was designed to read back the restored content from a video server to confirm that it is not corrupt. Using the -axf option does not create a checksum verifiable restore. It creates an object export that is encompassed in an AXF wrapper. The VFR and -axf options are mutually exclusive and should not be part of the same workflow."
