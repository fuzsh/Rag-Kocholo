        "text": "I doubt there's an industry standard hash function for ISBNs. The industry standards have to do with the 978 prefix and other prefixes, and with how ISBNs get allocated to different publishers. In my own ISBN-based application, I use a bog-standard hash function intended for use with strings. I take no advantage of the fact that the ISBN is limited to decimal digits (or in the case of the check digit, decimal or X), and I go ahead and hash the check digit even though it's redundant. It's so fast to hash a 10- or 13-digit string that doing special-case stuff might actually slow things down.\n\nPopular hash functions for C programmers include the Jenkins hash functions; also Hsieh, Torek, SuperFastHash, and murmurhash. I'm sure there are others; you can search for them. Also you'll find a collection at http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html."
