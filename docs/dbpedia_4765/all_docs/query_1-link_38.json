In addition, such sensitive information passed in URLs and cookies is also likely to be collected by other trackers on your pages and all the servers/routers in transit. Better to audit and route out PII regularly. This reference guide describes our methodology.\n\nPII Audit Method & Dimensions\n\nWe integrate with smart AI technology from Google to identify suspected personal data. All processing is done within the EU. When PII is suspected and flagged in an audit, the match item is hashed during processing and labelled as “scrubbed”. That is, Verified Data does NOT store any personal data found – the issue remains isolated for you to investigate and fix.\n\nThe DATA Inspector audits the following Google Analytics dimensions for suspected of PII:\n\nPage URLs*\n\nReferral Page URLs*\n\nEvent Parameters\n\nCampaign Parameters\n\nCustom Dimensions\n\nE-commerce Affiliation\n\n*Google Analytics collects page URLs by default – and in vast quantities. To ensure the best chance of detection, we pre-filter URLs for any reference of “@”. That is, the haystack size is dramatically reduced if we assume PII within a URL is highly likely to contain at least an email address. Note: the other dimensions are not pre-filtered.\n\nList of Specific PII Checks\n\nThe Global Default dimensions are always checked for PII and these cannot be disabled. You can also check specific fields such as tax IDs, social security numbers etc from our list of 39 countries:"
