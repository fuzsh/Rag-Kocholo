        "text": "Electronic cards are trending in the present scenario for carrying out secure and cashless transactions.There is a need to understand different sources of threat which can result in inappropriate use of Electronic cards by using forge Access Credentials.One can easily store all the relevant details of cards just by Swiping them into a Point of Sales(POS) transaction device,later the details of the card such as CVV and four digit pin can be stored into the buffer which can be used to create a Similar Credit Card and Withdraw as much money as possible.Similarly IMEI is a Key Parameter of Every Electronic gadget to be specific to Mobile Phones,the primary purpose of IMEI is to uniquely identify each and every mobile phones. The present paper attempts to define a method which can be used to validate a given IMEI number on whether if it is valid or not,the same method can be used to validate most of the Credit Card and Debit Cards as well,this will result in a secure mean in dealing with mobile phones as well as secure plastic card for digital transactions based its authenticity.\n\nIntensive research has been carried out and is still taking place in the field of detection of counterfeit money. This area of research plays a vital role in the maintenance of consistency in economy and also crime -free society by detecting counterfeit money.In this paper we have proposed a system for automatic detection of counterfeit notes. This paper is based on the fact that all notes are printed with unique serial number. Every person who is currently using the note for transaction has to register the serial number of the note in his account along with his unique identity number. This serial number is used for validating the notes and data base transactions.\n\nThe problem of fake products by counterfeiters and unregistered manufacturers is real and constitutes a major threat to the health and safety of the Nigerian population. A descriptive study was carried out on the present means of identifying authentic products and fake ones by the members of the society in this work. The sources of information for this work include online journals, NAFDAC sites and face to face interviews with members of the society both student in the University of Ibadan and consumers in Ibadan and its environ. All the respondents agreed that there is a fake and counterfeit drug problem in Nigeria, and many considered this a major problem. The respondents commonly used visual security techniques before drug purchasing. These were: Seals/embossments, character of print, and mobile authentication system. The respondents’ most likely action after a counterfeit drug encounter was to return the drug back to the supplier. The study showed that consumers should be giving...\n\nThis paper evaluates the reliability of the information system for identifying mobile devices by the IMEI code (International Mobile Equipment Identifier). A system for identifying mobile devices by IMEI code is presented, which includes a database that is accessible both locally and remotely. The system allows collecting, storing, and processing information about all devices imported into the country and used in the country. Indicators for calculating the reliability of the information system are selected. Only server hardware with software is considered, and communication lines or other devices connected to the server are not considered. The situation is considered when the database of IMEI-codes and the software part are located on the same equipment, additional redundancy or duplication of nodes, elements, modules are not provided. A method for calculating the reliability of the “server - software” complex is proposed and analytical expressions for calculating the reliability ar...\n\nThe advancements in VLSI design technologies, economy of scale, mass production, reduced prices of mobile devices and aggressive competition in the market have made mobile phones affordable to common man and it helps him to stay connected with his near and dear ones at anytime and anywhere. The IMEI for GSM/UMTS/LTE phones and ESN for CDMA phones is the unique identity of any mobile device. After November 2008, ESN has been replaced by MEID in CDMA mobile devices. But along with the genuine mobile devices, rogue and sub-standard mobile devices are being sold in the markets which are either having illegal IMEI or cloned IMEI. Also, Internet is flooded with hardware flashers devices and software tools which are being used by the malicious persons for tampering and cloning the IMEIs of mobile devices [1]. These tampered mobile devices are then used for frauds, illegal acts, and anti- national activities and thereby cause a serious threat to security. The Law Enforcement Agencies and Te...\n\nIn the world global market today, there is an increasing threat that product are not what consumer's and end users think they are, industries, manufacturing Companies as well as commercial Companies which run on a web based platform-face the challenges of faking their products, therefore causing downstream in sales and quality of products in the market. The aim of this research is to design and develop an intelligent agent for monitoring and detecting counterfeit products. In this project, Barcode technology was used to develop a web based intelligent agent for monitoring and detecting counterfeit products, Qualitative and quantitative research methodology was adopted in this research in which questionnaire was used to determine the impact of counterfeit products on consumers and business and also to ascertain the ability of the consumers to identify counterfeit products. Based on the findings from this research, it is shown that the application of this system in t he global market can help minimize and if possible eradicate counterfeit products from the global markets.\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/credit-card-counterfeit-recognition-with-location-based-tracking-system https://www.ijert.org/research/credit-card-counterfeit-recognition-with-location-based-tracking-system-IJERTV3IS20880.pdf Mobile networks are driven by the need to provide more advanced services to mobile or nomadic computing devices like security services requiring remote client authentication. The user's location might be used as authentication factor, in addition to the typical authentication factors. The location information itself is subject to forging attacks, additional mechanisms must be used to certify its integrity. Location Remote Authentication Protocol which is a novel protocol combining several authentication factors to securely authenticate a mobile user where the user's location can be determined and its correctness is certified by a third trusted party called Local Element. Location based verification scheme is implemented by comparing the user's credit card location with the user's mobile location through Global Positioning System which intimates to user mobile with automated specific key Short Message Service. It is very effective to identify the real user and resist the involvement of unauthorized attacks by fake user."
