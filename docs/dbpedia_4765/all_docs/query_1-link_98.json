        "text": "0-9\n\n802.1X\n\nAlso known as dot1X, 802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based network access control. Per this standard, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) protocol is used for communication between the client and the authenticator (switches, wireless access points).\n\n802.1X-REV\n\n802.1X-REV is a revision of the 802.1X standard that contains security encryption and secure key exchange, allowing secure communication between authenticated and authorized devices. The 802.1X-REV feature includes the 802.1AE MAC Security (MACSec) encryption as well as 802.1af MACSec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol.\n\nA\n\nAAA\n\nCombined authentication, authorization, and accounting processes that are found in a management framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the information that is necessary to bill for services. These three processes are considered essential for effective network management and security. Typically, a server-based system in IP-based networking, AAA controls what computer resources users have access to, and manages and audits the activity of users over a network.\n\nAAA client IP address\n\nAn IP address of the AAA client, used to configure the AAA client in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) to interact with the network device. To represent multiple network devices, specify multiple IP addresses. Separate each IP address by pressing the Enter key.\n\nAAA server\n\nA server program that manages user requests for access to computer resources and, for an enterprise, provides authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. The AAA server typically interacts with network access and gateway servers, as well as with databases and directories that contain user information. The current standard by which devices or applications communicate with a AAA server is the RADIUS.\n\naccess\n\nThe capability to get to what you need. Data access is being able to get to (usually having permission to use) particular data on a computer.\n\naccess control\n\nEnsures that resources are only granted to those users who are entitled to them.\n\naccess control list (ACL)\n\nA mechanism that implements access control for a system resource by listing the identities of the system entities that are permitted to access the resource.\n\naccess control service\n\nA security service that provides protection of system resources against unauthorized access. The two basic mechanisms for implementing this service are ACLs and tickets.\n\naccess control system (ACS)\n\nAn AAA server that performs authentication, authorization, and accounting to manage devices in a network.\n\naccess policies\n\nThe policies that limit access to the Cisco ISE web interface by IP address, TCP port range, and Secure Socket Layer (SSL).\n\naccounting\n\nThe capability of ISE to record user sessions in a log file.\n\nActive Directory\n\nActive Directory is a Microsoft implementation of LDAP directory services for use in Windows-based environments. Active Directory provides administrators with the means for assigning network wide policies, deploying programs to many computer systems concurrently, and applying critical updates to an entire organization. Active Directory stores information and settings related to an organization in a centralized and accessible database.\n\nAdministration Persona\n\nAdministrative service running on ISE that allows you to administer and maintain ISE.\n\nadministrative operations\n\nA set of operations that you must perform to effectively deploy and manage the ISE servers in your network.\n\nADR\n\nAccessibility design requirements.

The specific methodology by which a programmer writing an application program may make requests of the operating system or another application.\n\napplet\n\nJava programs; an application program that uses the client web browser to provide a user interface.\n\nARP\n\nAddress resolution protocol. A protocol for mapping an IP address to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network. A table, usually called the ARP cache, is used to maintain a correlation between each MAC address and its corresponding IP address. ARP provides the protocol rules for making this correlation and providing address conversion in both directions.\n\nARPANET\n\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency Network. A pioneer packet-switched network that was built in the early 1970s under contract with the US government. It led to the development of the modern Internet, and was decommissioned in June 1990.\n\nAsymmetric Key Exchange\n\nAsymmetric or public key cryptography is based on the concept of a key pair. Each half of the pair (one key) can encrypt information so that only the other half (the other key) can decrypt it. One part of the key pair, the private key, is known only by the designated owner; the other part, the public key, is published widely but is still associated with the owner.\n\nattribute (LDAP)\n\nThe data in an entry is contained in attribute-value pairs. Each attribute has a name (and sometimes a short form of the name) and belongs to an objectClass. The attributes characteristics are fully described by an ASN.1 definition. One or more objectClasses may be included in a Schema. Depending on the ASN.1 definition of the attribute, there can be more that one attribute-value pair of the same named attribute in an entry. One (or more) attribute (or attributes), the naming attribute, or RDN will always uniquely identify an entry.\n\nauditing\n\nThe information gathering and analysis of assets to ensure such things as policy compliance and security from vulnerabilities.\n\nauthenticated (LDAP)\n\nA session is described as authenticated if a user distinguished name and secret are supplied when initiating the session (sending the bind).\n\nauthentication\n\nThe process of confirming the correctness of the claimed identity.\n\nAuthenticator (AT)\n\nA device that is already part of a trusted network.\n\nauthenticity\n\nThe validity and conformance of the original information.\n\nauthorization\n\nThe approval, permission, or empowerment for someone or something to do something.\n\nauthorization profile\n\nThe basic \"permissions container\" for a RADIUS-based network access service. The authorization profile is where you define all permissions to be granted for a network access request. VLANs, ACLs, URL redirects, session timeout or reauthorization timers, or any other RADIUS attributes to be returned in a response are defined in the authorization profile.\n\nAuthorization Server (AS)\n\nAAA server, such as Cisco ISE that provides authentication and authorization services.\n\nC\n\nCA\n\nCertificate authority. An authority in a network that issues and manages security credentials and public keys for message encryption and decryption. As part of a public key infrastructure (PKI), a CA checks with a registration authority (RA) to verify information that is provided by the requestor of a digital certificate. If the RA verifies the information of the requestor, the CA can then issue a certificate.\n\nCA signature\n\nA digital code that vouches for the authenticity of a digital certificate. The CA signature is provided by the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate.\n\ncache\n\nA special high-speed storage mechanism. It can be either a reserved section of main memory or an independent high-speed storage device. Two types of caching are commonly used in personal computers: memory caching and disk caching.\n\ncertificate\n\nDigital representation of user or device attributes, including a public key, which is signed with an authoritative private key.\n\ncertificate authentication profile\n\nCertificate authentication profiles are identity sources that are used in certificate-based authentications to verify the authenticity of users.\n\ncertificate-based authentication\n\nThe use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and certificates to authenticate and encrypt HTTP traffic.\n\nCGI\n\nCommon gateway interface. This mechanism is used by HTTP servers (web servers) to pass parameters to executable scripts in order to generate responses dynamically.\n\nCHAP\n\nChallenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol. A protocol that uses a challenge-response authentication mechanism where the response varies every challenge to prevent replay attacks.\n\nCHAP is an authentication technique where after a link is established, a server sends a challenge to the requestor. The requestor responds with a value that is obtained by using a one-way hash function. The server checks the response by comparing it its own calculation of the expected hash value. If the values match, the authentication is acknowledged; otherwise, the connection is usually terminated.\n\nchallenge-response\n\nA common authentication technique whereby an individual is prompted (the challenge) to provide some private information (the response). Most security systems that rely on smart cards are based on challenge-response. A user is given a code (the challenge) which he or she enters into the smart card. The smart card then displays a new code (the response) that the user can present to log in.\n\nchecksum\n\nA value that is computed by a function that is dependent on the contents of a data object and is stored or transmitted together with the object, for the purpose of detecting changes in the data.\n\ncipher\n\nA cryptographic algorithm for encryption and decryption. The method is used to transform a readable message (called plaintext or cleartext) into an unreadable, scrambled, or hidden message (called ciphertext).\n\nciphertext\n\nThe encrypted form of the message being sent. Ciphertext is data that has been encrypted. It is the output of the encryption process and can be transformed back into a readable form (plaintext) with the appropriate decryption key.\n\nclient\n\nA system entity that requests and uses a service that is provided by another system entity, called a server. In some cases, the server may itself be a client of some other server.\n\nclient/server\n\nDescribes the relationship between two computer programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request from another program, the server, which fulfills the request. Although the client/server idea can be used by programs within a single computer, it is a more important idea in a network. In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across different locations.\n\nCN\n\nCommon name is one of the attributes listed in an LDAP directory entry.\n\nCoA\n\nRADIUS Change of Authorization provides a mechanism to change the attributes of a session after it is authenticated. When there is a change in policy for a user or user group in AAA, you can send the RADIUS CoA packets from the AAA server such as Cisco ISE to reinitialize authentication and apply the new policies.\n\ncollision\n\nOccurs when multiple systems transmit simultaneously on the same wire.\n\ncommunity string\n\nA character string that is used to identify valid sources for Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests, and to limit the scope of accessible information. Ravlin units use a community string, such as a password, allowing only a limited set of management stations to access its MIB.\n\ncomputer network\n\nA collection of host computers together with the subnetwork or internetwork through which they can exchange data.\n\nconfidentiality\n\nThe need to ensure that information is disclosed only to those who are authorized to view it.\n\nconfiguration management\n\nThe process of establishing a known baseline condition and managing it.\n\ncookie\n\nData exchanged between an HTTP server and a browser (a client of the server) to store state information on the client side and retrieve it later for server use. An HTTP server, when sending data to a client, may send along a cookie, which the client retains after the HTTP connection closes. A server can use this mechanism to maintain persistent client-side state information for HTTP-based applications, retrieving the state information in later connections.\n\ncorruption\n\nA threat action that undesirably alters system operation by adversely modifying system functions or data.\n\nCoS\n\nClass of service. A way of managing traffic in a network by grouping similar types of traffic (for example, email, streaming video, voice, large document file transfer) and treating each type as a class with its own level of service priority.\n\ncountermeasure\n\nReactive methods that is used to prevent an exploit from successfully occurring once a threat has been detected. Intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) commonly employ countermeasures to prevent intruders form gaining further access to a computer network. Other countermeasures are patches, access control lists and malware filters.\n\ncovert channels\n\nThe means by which information can be communicated between two parties in a covert fashion by using normal system operations. For example, by changing the amount of hard-drive space that is available on a file server can be used to communicate information.\n\nCRC\n\nCyclic redundancy check. Sometimes called cyclic redundancy code. A type of checksum algorithm that is not a cryptographic hash, but is used to implement data integrity service where accidental changes to data are expected.\n\nCRL\n\nCertificate revocation list. A list of certificates (more accurately: their serial numbers) that have been revoked and are no longer valid, and should not be relied upon by any system user.\n\nCRUD\n\nCreate, read, update, and delete. The basic management operations that are performed on managed data.\n\ncryptanalysis\n\nThe mathematical science that deals with analysis of a cryptographic system in order to gain knowledge that is needed to break or circumvent the protection that the system is designed to provide. In other words, to convert the cipher text to plaintext without knowing the key.\n\ncryptographic algorithm or hash\n\nAn algorithm that employs the science of cryptography, including encryption algorithms, cryptographic algorithm or hash, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and key agreement algorithms.\n\ncryptography\n\nGarbles a message in such a way that anyone who intercepts the message cannot understand it.\n\nCSS\n\nCascading style sheet. A web page that is derived from multiple sources with a defined order of precedence where the definitions of any style element conflict.\n\nCSV\n\nComma-separated value. This file format is a delimited data format that has fields separated by the comma character and records separated by new lines.\n\nCUE\n\nCommon user experience\n\ncut-through\n\nA method of switching where only the header of a packet is read before it is forwarded to its destination.\n\nD\n\ndaemon\n\nA program that is often started at the time when the system boots and runs continuously without intervention from any of the users on the system. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. Daemons are supported by many operating systems, even if the original UNIX term is not. Windows, for example, refers to daemons as system agents and services.\n\ndashlet\n\nA subwindow on the Cisco ISE dashboard that contains unique, independent functions, and displays information using widgets, or small components that access data from outside the application.\n\ndatagram\n\nRequest for Comment 1594 says, \"a self-contained, independent entity of data carrying sufficient information to be routed from the source to the destination computer without reliance on earlier exchanges between this source and destination computer and the transporting network.\" The term has been generally replaced by the term \"packet.\" Datagrams or packets are the message units that the IP processes with and that the Internet transports. A datagram or packet needs to be self-contained without reliance on earlier exchanges because there is no connection of fixed duration between the two communicating points as there is, for example, in most voice telephone conversations. (This kind of protocol is referred to as connectionless.)\n\ndecapsulation\n\nThe process of stripping off the headers of one layer and passing the rest of the packet up to the next, higher layer on the protocol stack.\n\ndecryption\n\nThe process of transforming an encrypted message into its original plaintext.\n\ndeep-drill\n\nThe ability to click a sparkline on the Cisco ISE dashboard to automatically display a granular report of that data.\n\ndenial of service\n\nThe prevention of authorized access to a system resource, or the delaying of system operations and functions.\n\nDES\n\nData Encryption Standard. A widely used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key. There are 72,000,000,000,000,000 (72 quadrillion) or more possible encryption keys that can be used. For each given message, the key is chosen at random from among this enormous number of keys. Like other private key cryptographic methods, both the sender and the receiver must know and use the same private key.\n\ndevice administration\n\nCapability to control and audit the administration operations that are performed on network devices. The network device administrator role has full access to perform the administrative operations on network devices.\n\ndictionaries\n\nA store to configure attributes of the RADIUS protocol, internal users, and internal hosts.\n\ndictionary attack\n\nAn attack that tries all of the phrases or words in a dictionary, trying to crack a password or key. A dictionary attack uses a predefined list of words, compared to a brute force attack that tries all possible combinations.\n\nDiffie-Hellman\n\nA key agreement algorithm that was published in 1976 by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. Diffie-Hellman does key establishment, not encryption. However, the key that it produces may be used for encryption, for further key management operations, or for any other cryptography.\n\nDigest Authentication\n\nAllows a web client to compute MD5 hashes of the password to prove it has the password.\n\ndigital certificate\n\nAn electronic \"credit card\" that establishes your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the web. It is issued by a certification authority. It contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the public key of the certificate holder (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real.\n\ndigital envelope\n\nAn encrypted message with the encrypted session key.\n\ndigital signature\n\nA hash of a message that uniquely identifies the sender of the message and proves the message has not changed since transmission.\n\ndisassembly\n\nThe process of taking a binary program and deriving the source code from it.\n\ndisruption\n\nA circumstance or event that interrupts or prevents the correct operation of system services and functions.\n\nDIT\n\nDirectory information tree (also known as the naming context). The hierarchy of objects that make up the local directory structure. More than one DIT may be supported by an LDAP server. The Root DSE will provide this information.\n\nDLL\n\nDynamic link library. A collection of small programs, any of which can be called when needed by a larger program that is running in the computer. The small program that lets the larger program communicate with a specific device such as a printer or scanner is often packaged as a DLL program (usually referred to as a DLL file).\n\nDN\n\nDistinguished name. A DN is composed of a series of RDNs that uniquely describe the naming attributes on the path up the DIT from the required entry to the directory root. A DN is written left to right.\n\nDNS\n\nDomain Name System. The way that Internet domain names are located and translated into IP addresses. A domain name is a meaningful and easy-to-remember \"handle\" for an Internet address.\n\ndomain\n\nA sphere of knowledge, or a collection of facts about some program entities or a number of network points or addresses, identified by a name. On the Internet, a domain consists of a set of network addresses. In the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet, a domain is a name with which name server records are associated that describe subdomains or host. In Windows NT and Windows 2000, a domain is a set of network resources (applications, printers, and so on) for a group of users. The user only needs to log into the domain to gain access to the resources, which may be located on many different servers in the network.\n\ndomain name\n\nLocates an organization or other entity on the Internet. For example, the domain name \"www.sans.org\" locates an Internet address for \"sans.org\" at Internet point 199.0.0.2 and a particular host server named \"www.\" The \"org\" part of the domain name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity (in this example, \"organization\") and is called the top-level domain name. The \"sans\" part of the domain name defines the organization or entity and, together with the top-level name, is called the second-level domain name.\n\nDSA\n\nDigital Signature Algorithm. An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that produces a digital signature in the form of a pair of large numbers. The signature is computed using rules and parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the signed data can be verified.\n\nDSA Directory System Agent\n\nX.500 term for any DAP- or LDAP-enabled directory service; for example, an LDAP server.\n\nDSE DSA Specific Entry\n\nAn entry in a local directory server.\n\nDSS\n\nDigital Signature Standard. The U.S. government standard that specifies the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), which involves asymmetric cryptography.\n\ndue diligence\n\nThe requirement that organizations must develop and deploy a protection plan to prevent fraud and abuse, and a means to detect them if they occur.\n\ndumpsec\n\nA security tool that dumps various information about the users, file system, registry, permissions, password policy, and services of a system.\n\nE\n\nEAP\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol. A protocol for wireless networks that expands on Authentication methods used by the PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol), a protocol often used when connecting a computer to the Internet. EAP can support multiple authentication mechanisms, such as token cards, smart cards, certificates, one-time passwords, and Public Key Encryption authentication.\n\nEAP-FAST\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol-Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling. EAP-FAST is compliant with IEEE 802.1X and IEEE 802.11i. Like all EAP types, EAP-FAST can be used with WPA and WPA2 networks.\n\nEAP-MD5\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol-Message Digest 5. An EAP security algorithm developed by RSA Security that uses a 128-bit generated number string, or hash, to verify the authenticity of a data communication.\n\nEAP-TLS\n\nExtensible Authentication Protocol-Translation Layer Security. A high-security version of EAP that requires authentication from both the client and the server. If one of them fails to offer the appropriate authenticator, the connection is terminated. Used to create a secured connection for 802.1X by preinstalling a digital certificate on the client computer. EAP-TLS is the protocol that serves for mutual authentication and integrity-protected cipher suite negotiation and key exchange between a client and server. Both the client and the server use X.509 certificates to verify their identities to each other.\n\neavesdropping\n\nListening to a private conversation which may reveal information which can provide access to a facility or network.\n\nEditorAdmin\n\nA user role with privileges to edit all parts of the Cisco ISE user interface, with the exception of delete privileges for network resources.\n\negress\n\nEgress is the point at which a data packet leaves a trusted network, where the security group tag (SGT) is removed from the packet and the egress policy is applied.\n\negress filtering\n\nFiltering outbound traffic.\n\nencapsulation\n\nThe inclusion of one data structure within another structure so that the first data structure is hidden for the time being.\n\nencryption\n\nCryptographic transformation of data (called \"plaintext\") into a form (called \"cipher text\") that conceals the data's original meaning to prevent it from being known or used.\n\nendpoint\n\nAn endpoint is a network capable device connecting to your enterprise network that can use the resources on your network.\n\nentry (LDAP)\n\nThe name given to a stored object in a LDAP enabled directory. Each entry has one parent entry (object) and zero or more child entries (objects). The data content of an entry consist of one or more attributes one (or more) of which is (are) used as the naming attribute (more correctly the RDN) to uniquely identify this object in the DIT.\n\nequality (LDAP)\n\nEquality defines the comparison rule of an attribute when used in a search filter that contains no wildcards, and both the content and length must be exactly the same. When wildcards are used, this is called a substring and the SUBSTR rule is used.\n\nEthernet\n\nThe most widely-installed LAN technology. Specified in a standard, IEEE 802.3, an Ethernet LAN typically uses coaxial cable or special grades of twisted pair wires. Devices are connected to the cable and compete for access using a CSMA/CD protocol.\n\nevent\n\nAn observable occurrence in a system or network.\n\nexception action\n\nA single configurable action triggered if a set of conditions do not match.\n\nExponential Backoff Algorithm\n\nUsed to adjust TCP timeout values on the fly so that network devices don't continue to timeout sending data over saturated links.\n\nexposure\n\nA threat action whereby sensitive data is directly released to an unauthorized entity.\n\nexpression builder\n\nA pop-up dialog that simplifies creating expressions by allowing you to make selections from menus and other pop-up dialogs.\n\nextended ACLs\n\nA more powerful form of standard ACLs on Cisco routers. They can make filtering decisions based on IP addresses (source or destination), Ports (source or destination), protocols, and whether a session is established.\n\nexternal identity source\n\nExternal databases that ISE accesses to perform credential and authentication validations for internal and external users (as defined by you within a policy).\n\nexternal user\n\nA user defined in an external identity source.\n\nH\n\nhash functions\n\nUsed to generate a one way \"check sum\" for a larger text, which is not trivially reversed. The result of this hash function can be used to validate if a larger file has been altered, without having to compare the larger files to each other. Frequently used hash functions are MD5 and SHA1.\n\nheader\n\nThe extra information in a packet that is needed for the protocol stack to process the packet.\n\nHelpDeskAdmin\n\nA user role with privileges for read-only the Cisco ISE Dashboard, as well as Alarms within Monitor and Report.\n\nhost\n\nAny computer that has full two-way access to other computers on the Internet. Or a computer with a web server that serves the pages for one or more Web sites.\n\nHost-Based ID\n\nHost-based intrusion detection systems use information from the operating system audit records to watch all operations occurring on the host that the intrusion detection software has been installed upon. These operations are then compared with a pre-defined security policy. This analysis of the audit trail imposes potentially significant overhead requirements on the system because of the increased amount of processing power which must be utilized by the intrusion detection system. Depending on the size of the audit trail and the processing ability of the system, the review of audit data could result in the loss of a real-time analysis capability.\n\nHTML\n\nHypertext Markup Language. The set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page.\n\nHTTP\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol. The protocol in the Internet Protocol (IP) family used to transport hypertext documents across an internet.\n\nHTTPS\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer, or HTTP over SSL. HTTPS is a Web protocol developed by Netscape and built into its browser that encrypts and decrypts user page requests as well as the pages that are returned by the Web server. When used in the first part of a URL (the part that precedes the colon and specifies an access scheme or protocol), this term specifies the use of HTTP enhanced by a security mechanism, which is usually SSL. HTTPS uses port 443 instead of HTTP port 80 in its interactions with the lower layer, TCP/IP and an additional encryption/authentication layer between HTTP and TCP.\n\nhub\n\nA network device that operates by repeating data that it receives on one port to all the other ports. As a result, data transmitted by one host is retransmitted to all other hosts on the hub. The central device in a star network, whether wired or wireless. Wireless access points act as hubs in wireless networks.\n\nhybrid attack\n\nBuilds on the dictionary attack method by adding numerals and symbols to dictionary words.\n\nhybrid encryption\n\nAn application of cryptography that combines two or more encryption algorithms, particularly a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\nI\n\nI18N\n\nInternationalization and localization are means of adapting software for non-native environments, especially other nations and cultures. Internationalization is the adaptation of products for potential use virtually everywhere, while localization is the addition of special features for use in a specific locale.\n\nidentity\n\nWhom someone or what something is, for example, the name by which something is known.\n\nIdentityAdmin\n\nA user role with privileges to add, update, and delete entries in the internal ISE identity stores, including internal users and hosts.\n\nidentity groups\n\nA logical entity that is associated with all types of users and hosts.\n\nidentity source\n\nA database such as internal users, AD, LDAP, and so on that Cisco ISE uses to obtain user information for authentication.\n\nidentity source sequence\n\nAn object that contains a set of identity sources that Cisco ISE will look up for user information for authentication.

An IDS gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or a network to identify possible security breaches, which include both intrusions (attacks from outside the organization) and misuse (attacks from within the organization).\n\nIP\n\nInternet Protocol. The method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Each computer (known as a host) on the Internet has at least one IP address that uniquely identifies it from all other computers on the Internet.\n\nIP address\n\nA computer's inter-network address that is assigned for use by the Internet Protocol and other protocols. An IP version 4 address is written as a series of four 8-bit numbers separated by periods.\n\nIP flood\n\nA denial of service attack that sends a host more echo request (\"ping\") packets than the protocol implementation can handle.\n\nIP forwarding\n\nAn Operating System option that allows a host to act as a router. A system that has more than 1 network interface card must have IP forwarding turned on in order for the system to be able to act as a router.\n\nIP poofing\n\nThe technique of supplying a false IP address.\n\nIPsec\n\nInternet Protocol Security. A developing standard for security at the network or packet processing layer of network communication.\n\nISO\n\nInternational Organization for Standardization, a voluntary, non-treaty, non-government organization, established in 1947, with voting members that are designated standards bodies of participating nations and non-voting observer organizations.\n\nISP\n\nInternet Service Provider. A business or organization that provides to consumers access to the Internet and related services. In the past, most ISPs were run by the phone companies.\n\nP\n\nPAP (Password Authentication Protocol.)\n\nPAP is a simple authentication protocol used to authenticate a user to a remote access server or Internet service provider (ISP).\n\nPasswordAdmin\n\nA user role with privileges to change the password for internal users, and is intended for administrators who manage administrator accounts. An administrator with these privileges can change the password for other administrators.\n\nPolicy Service Persona\n\nPolicy Service is the runtime service running on ISE that evaluates requests and processes them.\n\nPI (Programmatic Interface)\n\nThe ISE PI is a programmatic interface that provides external applications the ability to communicate with ISE to configure and operate ISE. PI allows for performing the following operations on ISE objects: create, update, delete, and read.\n\npolicy condition\n\nRule-based single conditions that are based on policies, which are sets of rules used to evaluate an access request and return a decision.\n\npolicy element\n\nGlobal, shared object that defines policy conditions (for example, time and date, or custom conditions based on user-selected attributes) and permissions (for example, authorization profiles). Policy elements are referenced when you create policy rules.\n\nport setting\n\nYou can configure ISE to authenticate using different LDAP servers, or different databases on the same LDAP server, by creating more than one LDAP instance with different IP addresses or port settings.\n\nposture\n\nChecking a host that accesses a protected network resource for compliance.\n\nPPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)\n\nPPP is a protocol for communication between two computers using a serial interface, typically a personal computer connected by phone line to a server. For example, your Internet server provider may provide you with a PPP connection so that the provider's server can respond to your requests, pass them on to the Internet, and forward your requested Internet responses back to you. PPP uses the Internet Protocol (IP) and is designed to handle others. It is sometimes considered a member of the TCP/IP suite of protocols. Relative to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, PPP provides layer 2 (data-link layer) service. Essentially, it packages your computer's TCP/IP packets and forwards them to the server where they can actually be put on the Internet.\n\nPRA\n\nPeriodic Reassessment is reporting to the Cisco ISE server by periodically checking hosts for compliance.\n\nprofiling\n\nYou can match identities like endpoints for the purpose of classifying them based on a set of conditions.\n\nprotocol\n\nA protocol is the special set of rules that end points in a telecommunication connection use when they communicate. Protocols exist at several levels in a telecommunication connection. For example, there are protocols for the data interchange at the hardware device level and protocols for data interchange at the application program level. In the standard model known as Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), there are one or more protocols at each layer in the telecommunication exchange that both ends of the exchange must recognize and observe. Protocols are often described in an industry or international standard.\n\nPublic Key\n\nIn Cryptography a publicKey is a value provided by some designated authority as an Encryption Key that, combined with a private key derived from the public key, can be used to effectively encrypt messages andDigital Signatures.\n\nThe use of combined public and private keys is known as asymmetric cryptography. A system for using public keys is called a public key infrastructure (PKI).\n\nPublic Key Infrastructure (PKI)\n\nA PKI enables users of a basically unsecure public network such as the Internet to securely and privately exchange data and money through the use of a public and a private cryptographic key pair that is obtained and shared through a trusted authority. The Public Key infrastructure provides for a Digital Certificate that can identify an individual or an organization and directory services that can store and, when necessary, revoke the certificates. Although the components of a PKI are generally understood, a number of different vendor approaches and services are emerging. Meanwhile, an Internet standard for PKI is being worked on.\n\nR\n\nRADIUS Servers\n\nAny third-party server that supports the RADIUS interface.\n\nRDN (LDAP)\n\nThe Relative Distinguished Name (frequently but incorrectly written as Relatively Distinguished Name) is an X.500 terminology. The name given to an attribute(s) that is unique at its level in the hierarchy. RDNs may be single valued or multi-valued in which case two or more attributes are combined using '+' (plus) to create the RDN e.g. cn+uid. The term RDN is only meaningful when used as part of a DN to uniquely describe the attributes on the path UP the DIT from a selected entry (or search start location) to the directory root (or more correctly the Root DSE).\n\nreferral (LDAP)\n\nAn operation in which the LDAP server returns to an LDAP client the name (typically in the form of an LDAP URL) of another LDAP server that might be able to provide the information requested by the LDAP client.\n\nRemote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)\n\nRADIUS is a client/server protocol and software that enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server to authenticate dial-in users and authorize their access to the requested system or service. RADIUS allows a company to maintain user profiles in a central database that all remote servers can share. It provides better security, allowing a company to set up a policy that can be applied at a single administered network point. Having a central service also means that it's easier to track usage for billing and for keeping network statistics.\n\nRemediation\n\nAn operation that a host undergoes to get authenticated to access a protected network.\n\nReportAdmin\n\nA user role with privileges for generating and viewing reports and monitoring data, with read-only access to logs.\n\nRFC (Request for Comments)\n\nA series of memoranda that encompass new research, innovations, and methodologies applicable to Internet technologies.\n\nRole\n\nA set of typical administrator tasks, each with an associated set of permissions. An administrator can have more than one predefined role, and a role can apply to multiple administrators.\n\nroot (LDAP)\n\nThe root entry (a.k.a base, suffix) is one of many terms used to describe the topmost entry in a DIT. The Root DSE is a a kind of super root.\n\nRoot DSE (LDAP)\n\nConceptually the top most entry in a LDAP hierarchy - think of it as a super root and normally invisible i.e. not accessed in normal operations. Sometimes confused with root or base or suffix. DSE stands for DSA Specific Entry and DSA in turn stands for Directory System Agent (any directory enabled service providing DAP or LDAP access). Information about the rootDSE may be obtained in OpenLDAP by querying the OpenLDAProoDSE classobject and will provide information about protocol versions supported, services supported and the naming-context(s) or DIT(s) supported.\n\nrootdn (LDAP)\n\nThe rootdn is a confusingly named directive in the slapd.conf file which defines a superuser which can bypass normal directory access rules.\n\nRPM (RedHat Package Manager)\n\nAn RPM is a downloadable software package that is installable on Linux distributions that use RPM as their package management format."
