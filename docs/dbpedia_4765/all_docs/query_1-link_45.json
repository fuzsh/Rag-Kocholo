        "text": "DOI is an acronym for \"digital object identifier\", meaning a \"digital identifier of an object\" rather than an \"identifier of a digital object\". The DOI system was initiated by the International DOI Foundation in 1998, and initially developed with the collaboration of some participants in ISO/TC46/SC9. Due to its application in the fields of information and documentation and previous collaboration with some ISO/TC46/SC9 participants, it was introduced as a possible work item in 2004 and further developed from 2006 to 2010.\n\nThe DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address, other identifiers and descriptive metadata.\n\nThe DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions. Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial and non-commercial transactions.\n\nThe content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability between DOI applications.\n\nThe scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content (format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications, for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.\n\nGTIN describes a family of GS1 (EAN.UCC) global data structures that employ 14 digits and can be encoded into various types of data carriers.\n\nCurrently, GTIN is used exclusively within bar codes, but it could also be used in other data carriers such as radio frequency identification (RFID). The GTIN is only a term and does not impact any existing standards, nor does it place any additional requirements on scanning hardware.\n\nFor North American companies, the UPC is an existing form of the GTIN.\n\nSince 2005, EAN International and American UCC merged to GS1 and also EAN and UPC is now named GTIN.\n\nThe EAN/UCC-13 code is now officially called GTIN-13 (Global Trade Identifier Number). Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into EAN/UCC-13 code by simply adding a preceeding zero.\n\nAs of January 1, 2007, the former ISBN numbers have been integrated into the EAN/UCC-13 code. For each old ISBN-10 code, there exists a proper translation into EAN/UCC-13 by adding \"978\" as prefix.\n\nThe family of data structures comprising GTIN include\n\nGTIN-8 (EAN/UCC-8): this is an 8-digit number\n\nGTIN-12 (UPC-A): this is a 12-digit number\n\nGTIN-13 (EAN/UCC-13): this is a 13-digit number\n\nGTIN-14 (EAN/UCC-14 or ITF-14): this is a 14-digit number\n\nSee GTIN info\n\nThe International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) is a unique identifier for audiovisual works and related versions, similar to ISBN for books.\n\nIt was developed within an ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) TC46/SC9 working group. ISAN is managed and run by ISAN-IA.\n\nThe ISAN standard (ISO standard 15706:2002 and ISO 15706-2) is recommended or required as the audiovisual identifier of choice for producers, studios, broadcasters, Internet media providers and video games publishers who need to encode, track, and distribute video in a variety of formats.\n\nIt provides a unique, internationally recognized and permanent reference number for each audiovisual work and related versions registered in the ISAN system.\n\nISAN identifies works throughout their entire life cycle from conception, to production, to distribution and consumption.\n\nISANs can be incorporated in both digital and physical media, such as theatrical release prints, DVDs, publications, advertising, marketing materials and packaging, as well as licensing contracts to uniquely identify works.\n\nThe ISAN identifier is incorporated in many draft and final standards such as AACS, DCI, MPEG, DVB, and ATSC.\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique eight-digit number used to identify a print or electronic periodical publication. The ISSN system was adopted as international standard ISO 3297 in 1975. The ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for the standard.\n\nThe ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-digit number which identifies periodical publications as such, including electronic serials.\n\nThe ISSN is a numeric code which is used as an identifier: it has no signification in itself and does not contain in itself any information referring to the origin or contents of the publication.\n\nThe ISSN takes the form of the acronym ISSN followed by two groups of four digits, separated by a hyphen. The eighth character is a control digit calculated according to a modulo 11 algorithm on the basis of the 7 preceding digits; this eighth control character may be an \"X\" if the result of the computing is equal to \"10\", in order to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nThe ISSN is linked to a standardized form of the title of the identified serial, known as the \"key title\", which repeats the title of the publication, qualifying it with additional elements in order to distinguish it from other publications having identical titles.\n\nIf the title of the publication changes in any significant way, a new ISSN must be assigned in order to correspond to this new form of title and avoid any confusion. A serial publication whose title is modified several times in the course of its existence will be assigned each time a new ISSN, thus allowing precise identification of each form of the title : in fact it is then considered that they are different publications even if there is a logical link between them.\n\nContrary to other types of publications, the world of serial publications is particularly changeable and complex : the lifetime of a title may be extremely short; many publications may be part of a complex set of relationships, etc. These particularities themselves necessitated the introduction of the ISSN.\n\nSee All about ISSN:\n\nThe Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology (i.e., a specific type of barcode) that is widely used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and in other countries for tracking trade items in stores. Its most common form, the UPC-A, consists of 12 numerical digits, which are uniquely assigned to each trade item.\n\nAlong with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications.\n\nUPC data structures are a component of GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers).\n\nAll of these data structures follow the global GS1 specification which bases on international standards."
