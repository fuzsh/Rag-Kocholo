        "text": "Glossary\n\nAccess Point Name\n\nA gateway between a GSM, GPRS, 3G, or 4G mobile network and another computer network, usually the public Internet. The APN needs to be configured on the device. For emnify, it's em or emnify.\n\nA unique identification key used to authenticate emnify's APIs. Also used when authenticating the OpenVPN service.\n\nApplication-to-Peer SMS\n\nThe SMS sent and received between an application and a device (or vice versa).\n\nSIM that has been assigned to a device.\n\nGives information about the registration status and access technology of the serving cell.\n\nAuthentication Center\n\nA part of GSM infrastructure, validates any SIM card attempting network connection when a phone has a live network signal.\n\nBatch Identification Code\n\nA unique code for ordered SIM cards used to register the SIM cards in the SIM Inventory.\n\nBase station\n\nA fixed transceiver that acts as the primary hub for communication with one or more wireless mobile devices. It serves as the central point for wireless devices to connect and communicate within its coverage area.\n\nA satellite base station is a variant that extends this functionality through satellite links, enabling it to transmit and receive signals to and from orbiting satellites. Unlike standard base stations, these connect with satellite ground stations and other communication networks through the ground core network, providing service in remote areas where terrestrial connectivity is limited or unavailable.\n\nURL that will be called by a service to send and receive data related to an event that caused this action.\n\nA network that doesn't limit or prefer any specific network in a country and establishes a connection over any network that's transparent to the device.\n\nA checksum appended to identification data (for example, IMEI, EID, or ICCID) representing the preceding digits and calculated using an algorithm.\n\nCheck digits are used to validate the identifier, verify data integrity, and help prevent errors in equipment databases.\n\nThis is the connectivity status of a device. It can be set to:\n\nOnline: Device is transmitting or can transmit data through a data tunnel.\n\nAttached: Device is attached to a network but hasn't established a data tunnel.\n\nOffline: Device isn’t attached to a network.\n\nBlocked\n\nReferred to as Tariff Profile in the API\n\nA policy that defines which networks or countries SIM should operate in.\n\nCustomer success manager\n\nA member of emnify's team dedicated to helping you grow and achieve your goals. For a full explanation of the role, see Support.\n\nData received by the device.\n\nA session between opening and closing a data connection to the network.\n\nData transmitted by the device.\n\nThe data that has been used by a device, both transmitted and received.\n\nDistributed Denial of Service Attack\n\nAn attack where the attacker sends multiple requests to a web resource with the aim of exceeding the website’s capacity to handle multiple requests and prevent the website from functioning correctly.\n\nThe Workspace you log into when you visit the emnify Portal.

The number, always an integer, ranges from 0 to 65535. It helps determine the exact carrier frequency used for uplink (sending data from mobile devices to the network) and downlink (sending data from the network to mobile devices). The EARFCN is independent of the channel bandwidth, simplifying frequency selection to enhance device connectivity without interference.\n\nExtended Discontinuous Reception\n\nA device configuration that specifies the periodicity in which the device listens for incoming data on the radio. Instead of using a periodicity of 2.56 ms (DRX) it can be increased up to 40 minutes, thus reducing power consumption.\n\neUICC Identifier\n\nThe eUICC Identifier (EID) provides a unique global serial number for an eUICC. It has a fixed length of 32 digits, as indicated in the following diagram:\n\nUnlike the ICCID, the EID remains the same throughout the life of the eSIM. Therefore, you can use it as a permanent identifier to keep track of your SIM cards.\n\nA representation of the device which has a SIM installed. Often used as a legacy term for a device, particularly in the REST API.\n\nEmbedded SIM\n\nBecause of the \"e\" (for embedded) in its name, eSIM is sometimes incorrectly used for referring to the MFF2 physical form factor of an eUICC chip that's designed to be permanently surface-mounted inside a device. Within the IoT industry, eSIM refers to the entire solution that's comprised of an eUICC-equipped SIM along with the software platform for OTA provisioning. Although eSIMs can be embedded directly in a device, they're also manufactured as pluggable SIM cards. The emnify eSIM has capabilities not available with other eSIMs.\n\nEmbedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card\n\nThe embedded universal integrated circuit card (eUICC) is a component of a SIM card. It allows consumers and IoT manufacturers to provision the SIM with a new mobile network operator (MNO) profile over-the-air.\n\nA log that stores all device events.\n\nThe form factor of a SIM card represents the SIM card format.

Satellites in this circular orbit synchronize with the Earth's rotational period, appearing stationary in the sky from any fixed point on the ground. This characteristic makes GEO especially valuable for telecommunications satellites, as they consistently cover the same area on the planet's surface. This facilitates continuous communication without the need for tracking movement across the sky.\n\nGateway GPRS Support Node\n\nPart of the GSM infrastructure, the GGSN is responsible for the interworkings between the GPRS network and external packet switched networks.\n\nCloud infrastructure that's distributed globally, with several local breakout points for better traffic handling.\n\nGlobal navigation satellite systems\n\nComprises several satellite constellations, including GPS (United States), GLONASS (Russia), Galileo (European Union), BeiDou (China), and QZSS (Japan).
