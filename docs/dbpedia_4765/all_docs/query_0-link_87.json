This code is completed with leading zeros if necessary.\n\nD is the code checksum (verification key) 1 character\n\nThe algorithm for implementing an ISBN 10 checksum is // Pseudo-code\n\nfunction calculateISBN10Checksum(ISBN) {\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n\ntotal += ISBN[i] * (10 - i)\n\n}\n\nchecksum = (11 - (total % 11)) % 11;\n\nif (checksum == 10) checksum = \"X\"\n\nreturn checksum\n\n}\n\nThe algorithm for implementing an ISBN 13 checksum is // Pseudo-code\n\nfunction calculateISBN13Checksum(ISBN) {\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor (i = 0; i < 12; i+=2) {\n\ntotal += ISBN[i] + (ISBN[i+1] * 3)\n\n}\n\nchecksum = (10 - total % 10) % 10\n\nreturn checksum\n\n}\n\nThe presence of an X at the end of an ISBN code is due to the method of calculating the checksum. For ISBN 10, the last digit is the check digit, it is calculated using a formula which involves a weighted sum of the first nine digits of the ISBN modulo 11. When this sum is equal to 10, instead of representing this number by the 2 digits 10, it was decided to use X to remain at 10 characters in the ISBN."
