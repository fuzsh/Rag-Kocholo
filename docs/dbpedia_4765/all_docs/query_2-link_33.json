Failover occurs within minutes or hours, following a disaster. Daily data synchronization usually occurs between the primary and hot site, resulting in minimum or no data loss. Offsite data backup tapes might be obtained and delivered to the hot site to help restore operations. Backup tapes should be regularly tested to detect data corruption, malicious code and environmental damage. A hot site is the most expensive option. * Warm site. It contains partially redundant hardware and software, with telecommunications, telephone and utility connectivity to continue some, but not all primary site operations. Failover occurs within hours or days, following a disaster. Daily or weekly data synchronization usually occurs between the primary and warm site, resulting in minimum data loss. Offsite data backup tapes must be obtained and delivered to the warm site to restore operations. A warm site is the second most expensive option. * Cold site. Hardware is ordered, shipped and installed, and software is loaded. Basic telecommunications, telephone and utility connectivity might need turning on to continue some, but not all primary site operations. Relocation occurs within weeks or longer, depending on hardware arrival time, following a disaster.

An HTTP server, when sending data to a client, may send along a cookie, which the client retains after the HTTP connection closes. A server can use this mechanism to maintain persistent client-side state information for HTTP-based applications, retrieving the state information in later connections.\n\nCorruption\n\nA threat action that undesirably alters system operation by adversely modifying system functions or data.\n\nCost Benefit Analysis\n\nA cost benefit analysis compares the cost of implementing countermeasures with the value of the reduced risk.\n\nCountermeasure\n\nReactive methods used to prevent an exploit from successfully occurring once a threat has been detected. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) commonly employ countermeasures to prevent intruders form gaining further access to a computer network. Other counter measures are patches, access control lists and malware filters.\n\nCovert Channels\n\nCovert Channels are the means by which information can be communicated between two parties in a covert fashion using normal system operations.

The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. The term daemon is a Unix term, though many other operating systems provide support for daemons, though they're sometimes called other names. Windows, for example, refers to daemons and System Agents and services.\n\nData Aggregation\n\nData Aggregation is the ability to get a more complete picture of the information by analyzing several different types of records at once.\n\nData Custodian\n\nA Data Custodian is the entity currently using or manipulating the data, and therefore, temporarily taking responsibility for the data.\n\nData Encryption Standard (DES)\n\nA widely-used method of data encryption using a private (secret) key.

Datagrams or packets are the message units that the Internet Protocol deals with and that the Internet transports. A datagram or packet needs to be self-contained without reliance on earlier exchanges because there is no connection of fixed duration between the two communicating points as there is, for example, in most voice telephone conversations. (This kind of protocol is referred to as connectionless.)\n\nDay Zero\n\nThe \"Day Zero\" or \"Zero Day\" is the day a new vulnerability is made known.

Diffie-Hellman does key establishment, not encryption. However, the key that it produces may be used for encryption, for further key management operations, or for any other cryptography.\n\nDigest Authentication\n\nDigest Authentication allows a web client to compute MD5 hashes of the password to prove it has the password.\n\nDigital Certificate\n\nA digital certificate is an electronic \"credit card\" that establishes your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the Web. It is issued by a certification authority. It contains your name, a serial number, expiration dates, a copy of the certificate holder's public key (used for encrypting messages and digital signatures), and the digital signature of the certificate-issuing authority so that a recipient can verify that the certificate is real.\n\nDigital Envelope\n\nA digital envelope is an encrypted message with the encrypted session key.\n\nDigital Signature\n\nA digital signature is a hash of a message that uniquely identifies the sender of the message and proves the message hasn't changed since transmission.\n\nDigital Signature Algorithm (DSA)\n\nAn asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that produces a digital signature in the form of a pair of large numbers. The signature is computed using rules and parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the signed data can be verified.\n\nDigital Signature Standard (DSS)\n\nThe US Government standard that specifies the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), which involves asymmetric cryptography.\n\nDisassembly\n\nThe process of taking a binary program and deriving the source code from it.\n\nDisaster Recovery Plan (DRP)\n\nA Disaster Recovery Plan is the process of recovery of IT systems in the event of a disruption or disaster.\n\nDiscretionary Access Control (DAC)\n\nDiscretionary Access Control consists of something the user can manage, such as a document password.\n\nDisruption\n\nA circumstance or event that interrupts or prevents the correct operation of system services and functions.\n\nDistance Vector\n\nDistance vectors measure the cost of routes to determine the best route to all known networks.\n\nDistributed Scans\n\nDistributed Scans are scans that use multiple source addresses to gather information.\n\nDomain\n\nA sphere of knowledge, or a collection of facts about some program entities or a number of network points or addresses, identified by a name.

In Windows NT and Windows 2000, a domain is a set of network resources (applications, printers, and so forth) for a group of users. The user need only to log in to the domain to gain access to the resources, which may be located on a number of different servers in the network.\n\nDomain Hijacking\n\nDomain hijacking is an attack by which an attacker takes over a domain by first blocking access to the domain's DNS server and then putting his own server up in its place.\n\nDomain Name\n\nA domain name locates an organization or other entity on the Internet. For example, the domain name \"www.sans.org\" locates an Internet address for \"sans.org\" at Internet point 199.0.0.2 and a particular host server named \"www\". The \"org\" part of the domain name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity (in this example, \"organization\") and is called the top-level domain name. The \"sans\" part of the domain name defines the organization or entity and together with the top-level is called the second-level domain name.\n\nDomain Name System (DNS)\n\nThe domain name system (DNS) is the way that Internet domain names are located and translated into Internet Protocol addresses.

The small program that lets the larger program communicate with a specific device such as a printer or scanner is often packaged as a DLL program (usually referred to as a DLL file).\n\nDynamic Routing Protocol\n\nAllows network devices to learn routes. Ex. RIP, EIGRP Dynamic routing occurs when routers talk to adjacent routers, informing each other of what networks each router is currently connected to. The routers must communicate using a routing protocol, of which there are many to choose from. The process on the router that is running the routing protocol, communicating with its neighbor routers, is usually called a routing daemon. The routing daemon updates the kernel's routing table with information it receives from neighbor routers.\n\nEavesdropping\n\nEavesdropping is simply listening to a private conversation which may reveal information which can provide access to a facility or network.\n\nEcho Reply\n\nAn echo reply is the response a machine that has received an echo request sends over ICMP.\n\nEcho Request\n\nAn echo request is an ICMP message sent to a machine to determine if it is online and how long traffic takes to get to it.\n\nEgress Filtering\n\nFiltering outbound traffic.\n\nEmanations Analysis\n\nGaining direct knowledge of communicated data by monitoring and resolving a signal that is emitted by a system and that contains the data but is not intended to communicate the data.\n\nEncapsulation\n\nThe inclusion of one data structure within another structure so that the first data structure is hidden for the time being.\n\nEncryption\n\nCryptographic transformation of data (called \"plaintext\") into a form (called \"cipher text\") that conceals the data's original meaning to prevent it from being known or used.\n\nEphemeral Port\n\nAlso called a transient port or a temporary port.

It can be used in sniffers to determine which packets get displayed, or by firewalls to determine which packets get blocked.\n\nFiltering Router\n\nAn inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.\n\nFinger\n\nA protocol to lookup user information on a given host. A Unix program that takes an e-mail address as input and returns information about the user who owns that e-mail address. On some systems, finger only reports whether the user is currently logged on. Other systems return additional information, such as the user's full name, address, and telephone number. Of course, the user must first enter this information into the system.

The hosts are assigned private IP addresses, which are then \"translated\" into one of the publicly routed IP addresses. Typically home or small business networks use NAT to share a single DLS or Cable modem IP address. However, in some cases NAT is used for servers as an additional layer of protection.\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, a unit of the US Commerce Department.

This is generally accomplished by placing the network interface card in promiscuous mode to capture all network traffic that crosses its network segment. Network traffic on other segments, and traffic on other means of communication (like phone lines) can't be monitored. Network-based IDS involves looking at the packets on the network as they pass by some sensor. The sensor can only see the packets that happen to be carried on the network segment it's attached to. Packets are considered to be of interest if they match a signature.Network-based intrusion detection passively monitors network activity for indications of attacks. Network monitoring offers several advantages over traditional host-based intrusion detection systems. Because many intrusions occur over networks at some point, and because networks are increasingly becoming the targets of attack, these techniques are an excellent method of detecting many attacks which may be missed by host-based intrusion detection mechanisms.\n\nNon-Printable Character\n\nA character that doesn't have a corresponding character letter to its corresponding ASCII code. Examples would be the Linefeed, which is ASCII character code 10 decimal, the Carriage Return, which is 13 decimal, or the bell sound, which is decimal 7.

Its purpose is to guide product implementers so that their products will consistently work with other products. The reference model defines seven layers of functions that take place at each end of a communication. Although OSI is not always strictly adhered to in terms of keeping related functions together in a well-defined layer, many if not most products involved in telecommunication make an attempt to describe themselves in relation to the OSI model. It is also valuable as a single reference view of communication that furnishes everyone a common ground for education and discussion.\n\nOSI layers\n\nThe main idea in OSI is that the process of communication between two end points in a telecommunication network can be divided into layers, with each layer adding its own set of special, related functions. Each communicating user or program is at a computer equipped with these seven layers of function. So, in a given message between users, there will be a flow of data through each layer at one end down through the layers in that computer and, at the other end, when the message arrives, another flow of data up through the layers in the receiving computer and ultimately to the end user or program. The actual programming and hardware that furnishes these seven layers of function is usually a combination of the computer operating system, applications (such as your Web browser), TCP/IP or alternative transport and network protocols, and the software and hardware that enable you to put a signal on one of the lines attached to your computer. OSI divides telecommunication into seven layers. The layers are in two groups. The upper four layers are used whenever a message passes from or to a user. The lower three layers (up to the network layer) are used when any message passes through the host computer or router. Messages intended for this computer pass to the upper layers. Messages destined for some other host are not passed up to the upper layers but are forwarded to another host. The seven layers are: Layer 7: The application layer...This is the layer at which communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. (This layer is not the application itself, although some applications may perform application layer functions.) Layer 6: The presentation layer...This is a layer, usually part of an operating system, that converts incoming and outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from a text stream into a popup window with the newly arrived text). Sometimes called the syntax layer. Layer 5: The session layer...This layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogs between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination. Layer 4: The transport layer...This layer manages the end-to-end control (for example, determining whether all packets have arrived) and error-checking. It ensures complete data transfer. Layer 3: The network layer...This layer handles the routing of the data (sending it in the right direction to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). The network layer does routing and forwarding. Layer 2: The data-link layer...This layer provides synchronization for the physical level and does bit-stuffing for strings of 1's in excess of 5. It furnishes transmission protocol knowledge and management. Layer 1: The physical layer...This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier.\n\nOverload\n\nHindrance of system operation by placing excess burden on the performance capabilities of a system component.\n\nPacket\n\nA piece of a message transmitted over a packet-switching network.

A userâs session is redirected to a masquerading website. This can be achieved by corrupting a DNS server on the Internet and pointing a URL to the masquerading websiteâs IP. Almost all users use a URL like www.worldbank.com instead of the real IP (192.86.99.140) of the website. Changing the pointers on a DNS server, the URL can be redirected to send traffic to the IP of the pseudo website. At the pseudo website, transactions can be mimicked and information like login credentials can be gathered. With this the attacker can access the real www.worldbank.com site and conduct transactions using the credentials of a valid user on that website.\n\nPhishing\n\nThe use of e-mails that appear to originate from a trusted source to trick a user into entering valid credentials at a fake website.

A preamble defines a specific series of transmission pulses that is understood by communicating systems to mean \"someone is about to transmit data\". This ensures that systems receiving the information correctly interpret when the data transmission starts. The actual pulses used as a preamble vary depending on the network communication technology in use.\n\nPretty Good Privacy (PGP)TM\n\nTrademark of Network Associates, Inc., referring to a computer program (and related protocols) that uses cryptography to provide data security for electronic mail and other applications on the Internet.\n\nPrivate Addressing\n\nIANA has set aside three address ranges for use by private or non-Internet connected networks.

If the fragment size is made small enough to force some of a TCP packet's TCP header fields into the second fragment, filter rules that specify patterns for those fields will not match. If the filtering implementation does not enforce a minimum fragment size, a disallowed packet might be passed because it didn't hit a match in the filter. STD 5, RFC 791 states: Every Internet module must be able to forward a datagram of 68 octets without further fragmentation. This is because an Internet header may be up to 60 octets, and the minimum fragment is 8 octets.\n\nToken Ring\n\nA token ring network is a local area network in which all computers are connected in a ring or star topology and a binary digit or token-passing scheme is used in order to prevent the collision of data between two computers that want to send messages at the same time.\n\nToken-Based Access Control\n\nToken based access control associates a list of objects and their privileges with each user.

Note 2: The common types of network topology are illustrated\n\nTraceroute (tracert.exe)\n\nTraceroute is a tool the maps the route a packet takes from the local machine to a remote destination.\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nA set of rules (protocol) used along with the Internet Protocol to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. While IP takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, TCP takes care of keeping track of the individual units of data (called packets) that a message is divided into for efficient routing through the Internet. Whereas the IP protocol deals only with packets, TCP enables two hosts to establish a connection and exchange streams of data. TCP guarantees delivery of data and also guarantees that packets will be delivered in the same order in which they were sent.\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS)\n\nA protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their users on the Internet. When a server and client communicate, TLS ensures that no third party may eavesdrop or tamper with any message. TLS is the successor to the Secure Sockets Layer.\n\nTriple DES\n\nA block cipher, based on DES, that transforms each 64-bit plaintext block by applying the Data Encryption Algorithm three successive times, using either two or three different keys, for an effective key length of 112 or 168 bits.\n\nTriple-Wrapped\n\nS/MIME usage: data that has been signed with a digital signature, and then encrypted, and then signed again.\n\nTrojan Horse\n\nA computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes the program.\n\nTrunking\n\nTrunking is connecting switched together so that they can share VLAN information between them.\n\nTrust\n\nTrust determine which permissions and what actions other systems or users can perform on remote machines.\n\nTrusted Ports\n\nTrusted ports are ports below number 1024 usually allowed to be opened by the root user.\n\nTunnel\n\nA communication channel created in a computer network by encapsulating a communication protocol's data packets in (on top of) a second protocol that normally would be carried above, or at the same layer as, the first one. Most often, a tunnel is a logical point-to-point link - i.e., an OSI layer 2 connection - created by encapsulating the layer 2 protocol in a transport protocol (such as TCP), in a network or inter-network layer protocol (such as IP), or in another link layer protocol. Tunneling can move data between computers that use a protocol not supported by the network connecting them.\n\nUDP Scan\n\nUDP scans perform scans to determine which UDP ports are open.\n\nUnicast\n\nBroadcasting from host to host.\n\nUniform Resource Identifier (URI)\n\nThe generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the World Wide Web.\n\nUniform Resource Locator (URL)\n\nThe global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.

Unlike TCP/IP, UDP/IP provides very few error recovery services, offering instead a direct way to send and receive datagrams over an IP network. It's used primarily for broadcasting messages over a network. UDP uses the Internet Protocol to get a datagram from one computer to another but does not divide a message into packets (datagrams) and reassemble it at the other end. Specifically, UDP doesn't provide sequencing of the packets that the data arrives in.\n\nVirtual Private Network (VPN)\n\nA restricted-use, logical (i.e., artificial or simulated) computer network that is constructed from the system resources of a relatively public, physical (i.e., real) network (such as the Internet), often by using encryption (located at hosts or gateways), and often by tunneling links of the virtual network across the real network. For example, if a corporation has LANs at several different sites, each connected to the Internet by a firewall, the corporation could create a VPN by (a) using encrypted tunnels to connect from firewall to firewall across the Internet and (b) not allowing any other traffic through the firewalls. A VPN is generally less expensive to build and operate than a dedicated real network, because the virtual network shares the cost of system resources with other users of the real network.\n\nVirus\n\nA hidden, self-replicating section of computer software, usually malicious logic, that propagates by infecting - i.e., inserting a copy of itself into and becoming part of - another program.

In a computer that has a graphical user interface (GUI), you may want to use a number of applications at the same time (this is called task). Using a separate window for each application, you can interact with each application and go from one application to another without having to reinitiate it. Having different information or activities in multiple windows may also make it easier for you to do your work. A windowing system uses a window manager to keep track of where each window is located on the display screen and its size and status. A windowing system doesn't just manage the windows but also other forms of graphical user interface entities.\n\nWindump\n\nWindump is a freeware tool for Windows that is a protocol analyzer that can monitor network traffic on a wire.\n\nWired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)\n\nA security protocol for wireless local area networks defined in the standard IEEE 802.11b.\n\nWireless Application Protocol\n\nA specification for a set of communication protocols to standardize the way that wireless devices, such as cellular telephones and radio transceivers, can be used for Internet access, including e-mail, the World Wide Web, newsgroups, and Internet Relay Chat.\n\nWiretapping\n\nMonitoring and recording data that is flowing between two points in a communication system.\n\nWorld Wide Web (\"the Web\", WWW, W3)\n\nThe global, hypermedia-based collection of information and services that is available on Internet servers and is accessed by browsers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol and other information retrieval mechanisms.\n\nWorm\n\nA computer program that can run independently, can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, and may consume computer resources destructively.\n\nZero Day\n\nThe \"Day Zero\" or \"Zero Day\" is the day a new vulnerability is made known. In some cases, a \"zero day\" exploit is referred to an exploit for which no patch is available yet. (\"day one\" - day at which the patch is made available).\n\nZero-day attack\n\nA zero-day (or zero-hour or day zero) attack or threat is a computer threat that tries to exploit computer application vulnerabilities that are unknown to others or undisclosed to the software developer. Zero-day exploits (actual code that can use a security hole to carry out an attack) are used or shared by attackers before the software developer knows about the vulnerability.\n\nZombies\n\nA zombie computer (often shortened as zombie) is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, a computer virus, or a trojan horse. Generally, a compromised machine is only one of many in a botnet, and will be used to perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies."
