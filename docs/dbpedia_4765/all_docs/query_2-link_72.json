The production identifier shall be used for the file names and for the content of the dc:Identifier element of the OPF, see section 3.5.3.1 for the dc:Identifier requirements.\n\n3.1.2 File Names\n\nAll alphabetic characters shall be in lower case.\n\nThe file names of the DTB shall be the production identifier followed by the appropriate file extension required by ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 or as specified below.\n\n3.1.2.1 Audio File Names\n\nAll audio files, with the exception of the headings file and resource audio file, shall have a sequence indicator consisting of a hyphen and four digits appended to the production identifier in the file name (including any leading zeroes needed to meet the four-digit requirement). The range of sequence indicators shall begin with -0001 and the sequence shall be continuous. The sequence indicator shall equal the sequence indicator of the corresponding master (primary) WAV file.\n\n3.1.2.2 SMIL File Names\n\nWhen a DTB contains more than one SMIL file those files shall have a sequence indicator consisting of a hyphen and four digits appended to the production identifier in the file name (including any leading zeroes needed to meet the four-digit requirement). The range of sequence indicators shall begin with -0001 and the sequence shall be continuous.\n\n3.1.2.3 Headings File Name\n\nThe file name of the headings file shall be the production identifier concatenated with the suffix “hdgs”.\n\n3.1.2.4 Checksum File Name\n\nThe name of the file containing MD5 checksums shall be the production identifier concatenated with the suffix “dtb.md5”.\n\n3.1.3 File Limits\n\nThe complete DTB shall contain no more than 250 files.\n\n3.1.4 XML File Character Encoding\n\nThe character set encoding of all XML files shall be UTF-8. All XML files shall include an XML declaration with the encoding attribute equaling “UTF-8” Non-ASCII characters in all <metadata> element content shall be represented as numeric character references or as UTF-8 multi-byte sequences.\n\n3.2 Audio Files\n\n3.2.1 Source for Compressed Primary Audio Files\n\nThe source for each compressed audio file shall be identical to the primary WAV audio file.\n\n3.2.2 Source for Compressed Headings File\n\nThe source for the compressed headings file shall be identical to the headings WAV file.\n\n3.2.3 Compression\n\nAll DTB audio files shall be compressed with an audio encoder conforming to the following requirements, and shall be encoded monaurally at a constant bitrate.\n\n3.2.3.1 Audio Encoder\n\nThe encoder used to compress the audio files for the DTB shall be fully compliant with the standard for Extended Adaptive Multi-Rate-Wideband (AMR-WB+), ETSI TS 126 290 release 6.\n\n3.2.3.2 Audio Encoder Parameters\n\nThe encoder parameters shall generate AMR-WB+ with a frame type of 23 and an ISF index of 8, as described in Section 8.1 of the above standard.\n\n3.2.3.3 Audio File Format\n\nThe 3GP file format shall be used to store the compressed AMR-WB+ frames. The 3GP files shall be fully compliant with ETSI TS 126 244 release 7 with the following restrictions:\n\nChecksum Keyword\n\nThe 3GP file shall contain a User Data (udta) box within the Movie (moov) box. The “udta” box shall contain a Keyword sub-box that shall contain the keyword “md5sum.cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc,” where cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc is the ASCII hexadecimal representation of the 16 byte MD5 checksum of the entire source WAV file.\n\nSample-Size Box Format\n\nThe Sample-Size box (stsz) contained within the Sample Table (stbl) box of the sound track’s Media Information (minf) box shall contain only the elements “sample_size” and “sample_count.” “sample_size” shall be the size of, and “sample_count” the number of, AMR-WB+ superframes contained within the track.\n\n3.2.4 Sound Quality\n\nCompressed audio files shall be of acceptable subjective sound quality when compared to the WAV files.\n\n3.2.5 Time Offset\n\nIt is anticipated that there will be a time offset of 50 to 80 milliseconds (ms) between the uncompressed and compressed/decompressed audio files. The timing references for all clipBegin and clipEnd attributes on audio elements in the SMIL, NCX, Distinfo and resource files, are to be relative to the WAV file. In determining the correct times for the start and end of audio clips, producers should assume that the time offset will be compensated for by the player, but these times can have an uncertainty of plus or minus 30 milliseconds when played.\n\n3.3 SMIL Synchronization File\n\nThe SMIL file(s) shall conform to the normative requirements of section 7 of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002.\n\n3.3.1 SMIL Validity\n\nThe SMIL file(s) shall be well-formed and valid to the DTB-specific SMIL document type definition (DTD) of Appendix 2 of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002.\n\n3.3.2 SMIL Metadata\n\nSMIL metadata shall conform to the requirements of section 7.5 of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002, and the element “dtb:generator” shall be completed by the producer.

Quality Assurance Provisions\n\n5.1 Responsibility for Inspections\n\nThe producer is responsible for the inspection of all files for compliance with the requirements of this specification. NLS reserves the right to perform inspections when deemed necessary to ensure that products conform to the prescribed requirements.\n\n5.2 Quality Assurance Procedures (QAP)\n\nThe producers shall prepare written documentation that describes the quality-assurance procedures used to achieve the requirements of the specification. The producer shall submit this documentation to the NLS Content Quality Assurance Section at the beginning of each new contract or at any time required by NLS. NLS reserves the right to require the producer to improve quality-assurance procedures. These shall be provided at no cost to NLS.\n\n5.3 Reporting of Inspection Results\n\nThe producer shall maintain complete records (in English) of all inspection results for the duration of the contract, including the warranty period. NLS reserves the right to request copies, for review, of any documentation related to this specification. These shall be provided at no cost to NLS.\n\n5.4 Test Equipment and Inspection Facilities\n\nThe producer shall ensure that test and inspection facilities of sufficient accuracy, quality, and quantity are established and maintained to permit performance of required inspections. Test equipment shall be calibrated annually. NLS reserves the right to request copies, for review, of any documentation related to this specification. These shall be provided at no cost to NLS.\n\n5.5 Responsibility for Compliance\n\nThe requirements set forth in this specification shall become a part of the producer’s overall inspection system or quality program. The absence of any inspection requirements in the specification shall not relieve the producer of the responsibility of assuring that all products submitted to NLS comply with all requirements. Sampling in quality conformance does not authorize the submission of known defective material, either indicated or actual, nor does it commit NLS to the acceptance of defective material. Should NLS determine that a significant fault or faults are found in production materials, within the warranty period, then correction of the fault or faults and inspections or controls for prevention shall be instituted without additional charge to NLS.\n\n5.6 Parser\n\nThe parser used to validate the OPF, NCX, SMIL, distInfo, resource, and textual content files shall be a validating XML parser compliant with the applicable standard referenced by ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002. The XML parser to be used and its version shall be identified; if requested, a copy shall be submitted.\n\nAny other software or tools used to validate DTB content shall be capable of detecting deviations from the requirements of ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2002 and NLS Specifications 1202, 1208, 1205, and 1206.\n\n5.8 Production Change Report\n\nA production change report shall be issued by the producer to notify NLS QAS of any changes to materials, manufacturing/production process, or software used to produce DTBs.\n\n5.9 Incoming Inspection\n\nIncoming inspection shall be performed by the producer on source materials provided by NLS including the audio source files, the OPF metadata, and textual content file validity.\n\n5.10 Producer’s Acceptance Inspection\n\nAcceptance inspection shall be performed by the producer on 100% of every DTB. All files, and the content of those files, shall be examined for compliance with the requirements of specification.\n\n5.11 Warranty\n\nThe producer shall agree to unconditionally warrant that the audio recording conforms to the requirements set forth in this specification for a period of two (2) years from the date the DTB is approved by the NLS Content Quality Assurance Section.\n\n5.12 DTB Correction\n\nShould NLS determine that a noncompliance with the specifications exists on a DTB during the warranty period; then correction of the noncompliance and production inspections or controls for prevention shall be instituted at no cost to NLS.\n\n5.13 NLS Testing\n\nThe right is reserved by the NLS, Library of Congress, to inspect any process or tests being performed. The library representative shall have the authority, without advance notice, to select at random a sample at any time during the course of the contract for testing to the specified requirements. The right is reserved by NLS to reject any DTB that does not meet specifications.\n\n5.14 Facility Inspection\n\nNLS reserves the right to inspect plant facilities or recording processes at any reasonable time. An NLS representative shall have the authority, without advance notice, to select at random a sample of the DTB productions at any time during the course of the contract for testing to the specified requirements.\n\nNLS shall in some cases provide tools, information, and materials to assist in the production of DTBs. Use of these items does not release the producer from their obligation to produce DTBs that meet the specifications. NLS reserves the right to update or discontinue supplied items at any time.\n\nAppendices\n\nA. Book Structure and Class-Attribute Relations\n\nIn the table below, book structures with the item “preliminary” will be rendered by the NLS hardware player as “front matter” and book structures with the item “concluding” will be rendered as “back matter” by the NLS player. Book structures that have a blank item field will be rendered by the NLS hardware player as described in the Class Attribute column (e.g., the book structure “sonnet” will be rendered as “poem”).\n\nCare must be taken to avoid the use of a preliminary item when the book structure is at the end of the book or a concluding item when the book structure is at the beginning of a book.\n\nUpon approval from NLS Content Quality Assurance Section a resource file may be used when creating navigation with a term not found in the table below. See the NLS Document QA201801 Instructions for Applying Navigation Markers for requirements when applying resource files in a DTB.\n\nFinal authority regarding proper use of class attributes rests with the NLS Content Quality Assurance Section.\n\nB. OPF Element nls:toneLevel\n\nB.1 Description\n\nThe digital talking-book player provided by NLS to patrons annunciates with a beep the crossing of specific navigational level boundaries when in rewind or fast-forward mode. By default, the navigation level (beep level) used for this function is the highest level, with navPoints having the class attribute equal to “chapter.” If there are no levels with a class attribute having this value, the topmost level is used.\n\nIn some circumstances it may be necessary to explicitly set the beep level. This can be accomplished by defining and setting the “nls:toneLevel” element in the OPF file.\n\nFigure 1 shows a typical NCX file with the nested structure of navPoints located within the navMap element. navPoints in blue font represent level 1, green font level 2, and red font level 3. The default behavior of the player would be to annunciate the crossing of level 2 navPoints, as this level is the highest with navPoints having a class attribute equal to “chapter.”\n\nFigure 1 – Typical NCX navPoint Structure\n\nIf it would be more appropriate in this book to have the player indicate the “story” navigation points, then add the x-metatdata element:\n\n<meta name=\"nls:toneLevel\" content=\"3\"/>\n\nB.2 Practical Example\n\nOne example where nls:toneLevel could be used to improve the user experience would be DB68777, the “Scourby Bible.” In this DTB the navPoint with class attribute “Chapters” is located at level 3. When reading the “Scourby Bible” with a standard NLS player, the default behavior will result in every chapter of every book of the Bible being announced by “beep” when navigating by book structure. Making use of nls:toneLevel set to level 2 would allow the user to navigate by books of the Bible, skipping the individual chapters. This change will result in a much less time-consuming method of navigation.\n\nC. Magazine Requirements\n\nA DTB magazine created for NLS must be compliant with the requirements of this specification (above) and the following magazine specific requirements and exceptions:\n\nC.1 NCX docTitle\n\nThe docTitle shall contain an audio element pointing to an audio clip of the magazine title and the issue date, and a text element containing the magazine title and issue date. The audio clip shall be contained in the compressed audio headings.\n\nC.2 NCX docAuthor\n\nThe docAuthor element is not required for magazines.\n\nC.3 NCX navMap\n\nThe DTB shall include a navPoint for the beginning of the magazine. Its navLabel shall contain the title and issue date of the magazine. The class attribute shall be “title/author”.\n\nC.3.2 Table of Contents\n\nThe DTB shall include a navPoint for the table of contents. If no heading is found in the print magazine for the table of contents, the navLabel “Contents” shall be inserted. The class attribute shall be “contents”.\n\nC.3.3 Ending Announcement\n\nThe contractor shall include a navPoint for the ending announcements, with the navLabel content being \"End of (magazine title and issue date)\". The class attribute shall be “close”.\n\nC.3.4 Absence of Print Headings\n\nFor divisions in the magazine that are to be made navigable via the NCX but which lack a heading in the print edition, the producer shall contact NLS for guidance on how to proceed.\n\nC.4 OPF Dublin Core Metadata Elements and Content\n\nAll Dublin Core metadata elements required in section 3.5.2 are required for magazine DTB production with the following modifications and/or exceptions."
