        "text": "Periodicals are identified using an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). An ISSN consists of two blocks of four digits. The last digit in the second block is a check digit. This check digit is determined by the congruence \\(d_{8}\\) : \\(3 d_{1}+4 d_{2}+5 d_{3}+6 d_{4}+7 d_{5}+8 d_{6}+9 d_{7}(\\bmod 11) .\\) When \\(d_{8}=10\\) (mod 11), we use the letter \\(\\mathrm{X}\\) to represent \\(d_{8}\\) in the code. Does the check digit of an ISSN detect every error where two consecutive digits are accidentally interchanged? Justify your answer with either a proof or a counterexample.\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nYes, the check digit detects most errors from interchanging two consecutive digits.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\n- Understand the Check Digit Formula\n\nThe check digit ( d_{8} ) is calculated using the formula: 3 d_{1} + 4 d_{2} + 5 d_{3} + 6 d_{4} + 7 d_{5} + 8 d_{6} + 9 d_{7} (mod 11). If the result is 10, it is represented by the letter X .\n\n02\n\n- Identify Interchange of Two Digits\n\nIf two consecutive digits, d_{i} and d_{i+1} , are interchanged, the formula for d_{8} would be affected. Analyze the effect on the formula when two digits are swapped.\n\n03\n\n- Calculate Effect of Interchanging Digits\n\nDetermine the impact on the checksum formula if d_{i} and d_{i+1} (where i ranges from 1 to 6) are swapped. The new sum will be: 3 d_{1} + 4 d_{2} + ... + (k+1) d_{i} + k d_{i+1} + ... + 9 d_{7} .\n\n04\n\n- Analyze the Difference in the Checksum\n\nThe difference between the new and original checksum is given by: (k + 1) d_{i} + k d_{i+1} - k d_{i} - (k + 1) d_{i+1} = d_{i} - d_{i+1}. This difference will affect the modulo 11 calculation.\n\n05\n\n- Check Modulo Operation\n\nFor the checksum to remain valid, d_{i} - d_{i+1} must be divisible by 11, which is usually not the case unless d_{i} equals d_{i+1} . Thus, most errors from consecutive digit interchange will be detectable.\n\n06\n\n- Conclusion\n\nGiven the difference d_{i} - d_{i+1} will generally not be zero or a multiple of 11, interchanging two consecutive digits will typically result in a detected error.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nInternational Standard Serial Number\n\nThe International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an eight-digit code used to uniquely identify periodicals and serial publications. It consists of two blocks of four digits each. The ISSN helps libraries, bookstores, and publishers manage and organize serial publications efficiently. The last digit of the second block is special; it's called the check digit. This check digit is crucial for ensuring the ISSN's accuracy and is calculated using a specific formula.\n\nCheck Digit Formula\n\nThe check digit, denoted as \\( d_8 \\), is determined by a weighted sum of the preceding digits of the ISSN. The formula is as follows: \\[ d_8 = (3d_1 + 4d_2 + 5d_3 + 6d_4 + 7d_5 + 8d_6 + 9d_7) \\mod 11 \\]. If the result is 10, it is represented by the letter 'X' instead of a numerical digit. This formula ensures that the check digit contributes to error detection, adding a layer of validity to the ISSN.\n\nModulo Arithmetic\n\nModulo arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain value—called the modulus. In the context of the ISSN check digit, we use modulo 11 arithmetic. This means we take the remainder of the division of the weighted sum by 11. If our sum is, for example, 22, then \\( 22 \\mod 11 = 0 \\). This property allows us to keep the check digit within a manageable range of 0 to 10, where 10 is represented as 'X'.\n\nError Detection\n\nThe primary purpose of the check digit in an ISSN is to detect errors, especially those involving the misplacement or mistyping of digits. When a mistake occurs, the checksum calculation using the check digit formula will often yield a different result, indicating an inconsistency. For example, interchanging two consecutive digits usually disrupts the weighted sum enough that the result mod 11 is no longer accurate. This discrepancy helps identify and correct errors in the ISSN.\n\nSwapping Digits\n\nSwapping digits, particularly two consecutive ones, is a common error when dealing with numerical codes. In an ISSN, if we interchange two digits \\( d_i \\) and \\( d_{i+1} \\), we need to recalculate the checksum to see the effect. The new sum becomes \\[ 3d_1 + 4d_2 + ... + (k+1)d_i + kd_{i+1} + ... + 9d_7 \\]. The difference between the original and new sums will be \\( d_i - d_{i+1} \\), affecting the modulo 11 outcome. Generally, since most differences are not multiples of 11, the check digit will reveal the error, highlighting the import of precise data entry."
