AIM/AIDC (Association for Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technology), ISO (International Standards Organization) and similar bodies publish Barcode standards. ClearImage Barcode Products implement the features as specified in the Barcode Symbologies.\n\nApplication Standards are developed by specific industry associations or governmental groups, and describe how to use particular symbologies in their applications. For each supported barcode application they specify how industry-specified data fields are encoded into the barcode and they impose rules about barcode length for symbologies with variable length. Sometimes they might specify their own checksum algorithm, to be added to the application data before it is encoded in the barcode. Examples include: Bookland ISBN, EAN-13 Israel, EAN-13 Special, HRI, ISSN, ITF-14, ITF-14 Israel, ITF-14 Old Style, NDC, ODETTE, Spanish Pharma CCP & SCP, UPC-A+UCC-128 (Coupons). The features of such Application Standards are typically interpreted and implemented by the customer applications.\n\nProprietary Designations are purchase or business process specifications, which are adopted by various companies, especially large transportation and retail companies, such as Panasonic Video or MS-7 (Marks & Spencer). They use these terms to define specific barcodes, size, appearance, location on boxes or documents, and data formats that they want their business partners to utilize in order to transact business with them. It is impractical to keep track of the myriad of such names. Their significance affects primarily the printing step, because the appearance of the codes must adhere to these proprietary specifications. However, ClearImage Barcode Products can correctly recognize virtually all of them.\n\nBarcode's features"
