        "text": "Glossary\n\nAccess Point Name\n\nA gateway between a GSM, GPRS, 3G, or 4G mobile network and another computer network, usually the public Internet. The APN needs to be configured on the device. For emnify, it's em or emnify.\n\nA unique identification key used to authenticate emnify's APIs. Also used when authenticating the OpenVPN service.\n\nApplication-to-Peer SMS\n\nThe SMS sent and received between an application and a device (or vice versa).\n\nSIM that has been assigned to a device.\n\nGives information about the registration status and access technology of the serving cell.\n\nAuthentication Center\n\nA part of GSM infrastructure, validates any SIM card attempting network connection when a phone has a live network signal.\n\nBatch Identification Code\n\nA unique code for ordered SIM cards used to register the SIM cards in the SIM Inventory.\n\nBase station\n\nA fixed transceiver that acts as the primary hub for communication with one or more wireless mobile devices. It serves as the central point for wireless devices to connect and communicate within its coverage area.\n\nA satellite base station is a variant that extends this functionality through satellite links, enabling it to transmit and receive signals to and from orbiting satellites. Unlike standard base stations, these connect with satellite ground stations and other communication networks through the ground core network, providing service in remote areas where terrestrial connectivity is limited or unavailable.\n\nURL that will be called by a service to send and receive data related to an event that caused this action.\n\nA network that doesn't limit or prefer any specific network in a country and establishes a connection over any network that's transparent to the device.\n\nA checksum appended to identification data (for example, IMEI, EID, or ICCID) representing the preceding digits and calculated using an algorithm.\n\nCheck digits are used to validate the identifier, verify data integrity, and help prevent errors in equipment databases.\n\nThis is the connectivity status of a device. It can be set to:\n\nOnline: Device is transmitting or can transmit data through a data tunnel.\n\nAttached: Device is attached to a network but hasn't established a data tunnel.\n\nOffline: Device isnâ€™t attached to a network.\n\nBlocked\n\nReferred to as Tariff Profile in the API\n\nA policy that defines which networks or countries SIM should operate in.\n\nCustomer success manager\n\nA member of emnify's team dedicated to helping you grow and achieve your goals. For a full explanation of the role, see Support.\n\nData received by the device."
