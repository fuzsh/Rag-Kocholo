A capability level profile represents an organization’s progress toward achieving its targeted practice group level for each in-scope PA.\n\nCapability Maturity Model (CMM)\n\nA model that contains the essential elements of effective processes for one or more disciplines. It also describes an evolutionary improvement path from ad hoc, immature processes to disciplined, mature processes with improved quality and effectiveness.\n\nA model, from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), used by many enterprises to identify best practices useful in helping them assess and increase the maturity of their software development processes.\n\nScope Notes: CMM ranks software development enterprises according to a hierarchy of five process maturity levels. Each level ranks the development environment according to its capability of producing quality software. A set of standards is associated with each of the five levels. The standards for level one describe the most immature or chaotic processes, and the standards for level five describe the most mature or quality processes. This maturity model indicates the degree of reliability or dependency a business can place on a process to achieve its desired goals or objectives. It is also a collection of instructions that an enterprise can follow to gain better control over its software development process.\n\nCapability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)\n\nAn integrated model of best practices that enable businesses to improve performance by improving their processes.

The process variation is within set specification limits.\n\nSee Stable process\n\nCapacity stress testing\n\nA test for testing an application with large quantities of data to evaluate its performance during peak periods. This is also called volume testing.\n\nCapital expenditure/expense (CAPEX)\n\nAn expenditure that is recorded as an asset because it is expected to benefit more than the current period. The asset is then depreciated or amortized over the expected useful life of the asset.\n\nCard swipe\n\nA physical control technique that uses a secured card or ID to gain access to a highly sensitive location\n\nScope Notes: If built correctly, card swipes act as a preventive control over physical access to sensitive locations. After a card has been swiped, the application attached to the physical card swipe device logs all card users who try to access the secured location. In this way, the card swipe device prevents unauthorized access and logs all attempts to enter the secured location.\n\nCartel attack\n\nAn attack that involves a group of stakers with a large amount of staked tokens in a blockchain manipulating the blockchain in their favor. Alternatively, it is a type of 51% attack on PoS blockchain.\n\nCategory\n\nLogical groups or types of views of related capability areas that address common problems encountered by businesses when producing or delivering solutions\n\nCathode ray tube (CRT)\n\nA vacuum tube that displays data by means of an electron beam striking the screen.

The time gap between two updates is critical and poses a risk in digital certificate verification.\n\nCertification practice statement (CPS)\n\nA detailed set of rules governing the certificate authority's (CA) operations. It provides an understanding of the value and trustworthiness of certificates issued by a given CA.\n\nScope Notes: In terms of the controls an enterprise observes, this is the method used to validate the authenticity of certificate applicants and the CA's expectations of how its certificates may be used.\n\nCertified CMMI High Maturity Lead Appraiser (CHMLA)\n\nThe ISACA designation for a person who leads high-maturity appraisal activities and has satisfied the qualification criteria for experience, knowledge and skills defined by the Appraisal Method Definition Document. This person also has an active certification for conducting high-maturity appraisals\n\nSee Appraisal team leader\n\nChain of custody\n\nThe process of evidence handling (from collection to presentation) that is necessary to maintain the validity and integrity of evidence\n\nScope Notes: Includes documentation of who had access to the evidence and when and the ability to identify that the evidence is the exact item that was recovered or tested. Lack of control over evidence can lead to it being discredited. Chain of custody depends on verifying that evidence could not have been tampered with. This is accomplished by sealing off the evidence so it cannot be changed and providing a documentary record of custody to prove that the evidence was, at all times, under strict control and not subject to tampering.\n\nChallenge/response token\n\nA method of user authentication carried out through use of the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)\n\nScope Notes: When a user tries to log into the server using CHAP, the server sends the user a \"challenge,\" which is a random value. The user enters a password, which is used as an encryption key to encrypt the \"challenge\" and return it to the server. The server is aware of the password. It, therefore, encrypts the \"challenge\" value and compares it with the value received from the user. If the values match, the user is authenticated. The challenge/response activity continues throughout the session, protecting it from password-sniffing attacks. In addition, CHAP is not vulnerable to \"man-in-the-middle\" attacks because the challenge value is a random value that changes on each access attempt.\n\nChange\n\nA holistic and proactive approach to managing the transition from a current to a desired organizational state, focusing specifically on the critical human, or \"soft\" elements of change (ISACA)\n\nScope Notes: Includes activities such as culture change (values, beliefs and attitudes), development of reward systems (measures and appropriate incentives), organizational design, stakeholder management, human resources policies and procedures, executive coaching, change leadership training, team building and communication planning and execution.\n\nA methodical approach for controlling and implementing changes in a planned and structured manner (CMMI)\n\nChange control\n\nThe processes, authorities and procedures used for all changes made to a computerized system and/or the system data.

This is also known as plaintext.\n\nClient-server\n\nA term used to broadly describe the relationship between the receiver and provider of a service. Generally, the client-server describes a networked system where front-end applications, like the client, make service requests to another networked system. Client-server relationships are defined primarily by software. In a local area network (LAN), the workstation is the client, and the file server is the server. However, client-server systems are inherently more complex than file-server systems. Two disparate programs must work in tandem, and there are many more decisions to make about separating data and processing between the client workstations and the database server. The database server encapsulates database files and indexes, restricts access, enforces security and provides applications with a consistent interface to data via a data dictionary.\n\nClipping\n\nA technique for handling outliers. Specifically, clipping includes reducing feature values that are greater than a set maximum value down to that maximum value. It also involves increasing feature values that are less than a specific minimum value up to that minimum value.\n\nCloud access security brokers (CASBs)\n\nSoftware or appliances that are positioned between an enterprise technology infrastructure and a cloud service provider (CSP)\n\nCloud computing\n\nConvenient, scalable on-demand network access to a shared pool of resources that can be provisioned rapidly and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction\n\nCluster controller\n\nA communication terminal control hardware unit that controls a number of computer terminals\n\nScope Notes: All messages are buffered by the controller and then transmitted to the receiver.\n\nClustering\n\nAn algorithm for dividing data instances into groups—not a predetermined set of groups, but groups identified by the execution of the algorithm because of similarities found among the instances. The center of each cluster is known as the \"centroid.\"\n\nCMMI product suite\n\nThe integrated set of components that comprise CMMI. The product suite components include the model, appraisal method, training and certification, adoption guidance and systems and tools.\n\nCo-adaptation\n\nA process by which neurons predict patterns in training data by relying almost exclusively on outputs of other specific neurons instead of the network's behavior as a whole\n\nCoaxial cable\n\nA cable composed of an insulated wire that runs through the middle of each cable, a second wire that surrounds the insulation of the inner wire like a sheath and the outer insulation that wraps the second wire\n\nScope Notes: Has a greater transmission capacity than standard twisted-pair cables but has a limited range of effective distance\n\nCOBIT\n\nCOBIT 2019: The current iteration of COBIT, which builds on and integrates more than 25 years of developments in the field of enterprise governance of information and technology (I&T). It not only incorporates new insights from science but also operationalizes these insights as practices. COBIT is a broad and comprehensive I&T governance and management framework that continues to establish itself as a generally accepted framework for I&T governance.\n\nScope Notes: Earlier versions of COBIT focused on information and technology (IT), whereas COBIT 2019 focuses on information and technology aimed at the whole enterprise, recognizing that I&T has become crucial in the support, sustainability and growth of enterprises. (See www.isaca.org/cobit for more information.)\n\nCOBIT 5: A complete, internationally accepted framework for governing and managing enterprise information and technology (IT) that supports enterprise executives and management in their definition and achievement of business and related IT goals. Formerly known as Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT), with this iteration used only as the acronym. COBIT describes five principles and seven enablers that support enterprises in the development, implementation and continuous improvement and monitoring of good IT-related governance and management practices.\n\nScope Notes: Earlier versions of COBIT focused on control objectives related to IT processes, management and control of IT processes and governance aspects. Adoption and use of the COBIT framework are supported by guidance from a growing family of supporting products.\n\nCOBIT 4.1 and earlier: A complete, internationally accepted process framework for IT that supports business and IT executives and management in their definition and achievement of business and related IT goals by providing a comprehensive IT governance, management, control and assurance model. Formally known as Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT). COBIT describes IT processes and associated control objectives, management guidelines (activities, accountabilities, responsibilities and performance metrics) and maturity models. COBIT supports enterprise management in the development, implementation, continuous improvement and monitoring of good IT-related practices.\n\nScope Notes: Adoption and use of the COBIT framework are supported by guidance for executives and management (Board Briefing on IT Governance, 2nd Edition), IT governance implementers (COBIT Quickstart, 2nd Edition; IT Governance Implementation Guide: Using COBIT and Val IT, 2nd Edition; and COBIT Control Practices: Guidance to Achieve Control Objectives for Successful IT Governance) and IT assurance and audit professionals (IT Assurance Guide Using COBIT). Guidance also exists to support its applicability for certain legislative and regulatory requirements (e.g., IT Control Objectives for Sarbanes-Oxley, IT Control Objectives for Basel II) and its relevance to information security (COBIT Security Baseline). COBIT is mapped to other frameworks and standards to illustrate complete coverage of the IT management life cycle and support its use in enterprises using multiple IT-related frameworks and standards.\n\nCOBOL\n\nA high-level programming language used for solving problems in business data processing (stands for Common Business Oriented Language).\n\nCoCo\n\nA framework published by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1995 (stands for Criteria of Control)\n\nCode audit\n\nAn independent review of source code by a person, team or tool to verify compliance with software design documentation and programming standards.

These are provided by the programming language, naming, formatting and documentation requirements, which prevent programming errors, control complexity and promote the understandability of the source code. They are synonymous with development and programming standards.\n\nCoefficient\n\nA number or algebraic symbol prefixed as a multiplier to a variable or unknown quantity (e.g., x in x(y + z), 6 in 6ab)\n\nCoevolving\n\nOriginally a biological term, the way two or more ecologically interdependent species become intertwined over time\n\nScope Notes: As species adapt to their environment, they also adapt to one another. Today’s multibusiness companies need to take their cue from biology to survive. They should assume that links among businesses are temporary and that the number of connections (not just content) matters. Rather than plan a collaborative strategy from the top, as traditional companies do, corporate executives in coevolving companies should simply set the context and let collaboration (and competition) emerge from business units.\n\nCoherence\n\nA term that refers to establishing a potent binding force and sense of direction and purpose for an enterprise; relating different parts of an enterprise to each other and the whole to act as a seemingly unique entity\n\nCohesion\n\nThe extent to which a system unit (subroutine, program, module, component, subsystem) performs a single dedicated function\n\nScope Notes: Generally, the more cohesive the unit, the easier it is to maintain and enhance a system because it is easier to determine where and how to apply a change.\n\nCold site\n\nAn IS backup facility that has the necessary electrical and physical components of a computer facility but does not have the computer equipment in place\n\nScope Notes: The site is ready to receive the necessary replacement computer equipment in the event that the users have to move from the main computing location to the alternative computer facility.\n\nCollaborative filtering\n\nA technique for making predictions about the interests of one user based on the interests of many other users.
