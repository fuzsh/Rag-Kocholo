Animals are generally grouped into six types of animals. The system for animal classifications is called taxonomy.\n\nThe Animal Kingdom\n\nAll animals belong to a biological kingdom called kingdom Animalia. This kingdom is then broken down into over 30 groups, or phyla (plural form of phylum). About 75% of all species on Earth are animals. Animals are then broken down into two types: vertebrates and invertebrates.\n\nAnimals with a backbone are vertebrates.\n\nVertebrates belong to the phylum called Phylum Chordata.\n\nVertebrates are further broken down into five classes: amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles.\n\nAnimals without a backbone are invertebrates.\n\nMost invertebrates are in the phylum Arthropoda.\n\nAll About Amphibians\n\nAll amphibians are vertebrates, and they need moist environments or water to survive.\n\nThey are cold-blooded.\n\nThey absorb water and breathe through their thin skin.\n\nThey have at least one special skin gland used for defense.\n\nMost follow the life cycle of egg-larva-adult.\n\nExamples of Amphibians\n\nYou can find examples of amphibians all around the world. In some cases, examples of amphibians seem like the same animals, but they can be quite different like a frog and a toad.\n\nfrogs\n\nnewts\n\nsalamanders\n\ntoads\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nexamples of amphibians\n\nSOURCE\n\nTop Vectors / iStock / Getty Images Plus, ONYXprj / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAll About Birds\n\nBirds are a type of warm-blooded vertebrate that are adapted to fly.\n\nNot all birds can fly, but they do all have wings.\n\nBirds have beaks that help them catch and swallow food.\n\nThe digestive system of a bird allows it to eat whenever it can and digest the food later.\n\nBirds lay eggs to reproduce.\n\nThey are endothermic, meaning they maintain their own constant body temperature.\n\nThey are bipedal, which means they have two legs.\n\nThey have hollow bones and their bodies are covered in feathers.\n\nBirds belong to the class called Aves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamples of Birds\n\nBirds are some of the most recognizable animals, and you probably see different types of birds every day.\n\nalbatrosses\n\nchickens\n\nhummingbirds\n\nfalcons\n\nflamingoes\n\nostriches\n\nowls\n\nparrots\n\npenguins\n\npigeons\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nexample of birds\n\nSOURCE\n\nEkaterina_P / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAll About Fish\n\nFish are also vertebrates, and they are considered the oldest-known vertebrates.\n\nThey are ectothermic, or cold-blooded, which means they rely on their surroundings to regulate their body temperature.\n\nFish have fins.\n\nMost, but not all, fish have bodies covered in scales and breathe through gills.\n\nFish live underwater.\n\nExamples of Fish\n\nThere are over 30,000 species of fish alive today, more than all other vertebrate groups combined.\n\neels\n\nhagfish\n\nlampreys\n\nminnows\n\nrays\n\nsalmon\n\nseahorses\n\nsharks\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nexample of fish\n\nSOURCE\n\nEkaterina_P / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAll About Mammals\n\nMammals are another type of vertebrate that belong to the class Mammalia.\n\nYoung mammals get nourishment from milk produced by their mothers.\n\nMost mammals have hair.\n\nTheir jaw is hinged directly to their skull, unlike all other vertebrates.\n\nAlmost all mammals give birth to live babies.\n\nThey are endothermic, or warm-blooded.\n\nExamples of Mammals\n\nThere are over 5,500 living species of mammals all over the world.\n\naardvarks\n\nbats\n\nelephants\n\nhamsters\n\nhumans\n\nrabbits\n\nrhinoceroses\n\nwhales\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nexamples of mammals\n\nSOURCE\n\nEkaterina_P / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAll About Reptiles\n\nReptiles are thought to be the first vertebrates to live completely on land. But, not all reptiles live only on land today.\n\nThey are cold-blooded, or ectothermic.\n\nThey lay eggs to reproduce.\n\nThey have four legs or are descended from animals with four legs.\n\nThey breathe through lungs.\n\nTheir bodies are covered in scales or scutes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExample of Reptiles\n\nDifferent species of reptiles can be tiny or huge.\n\ncrocodiles\n\ngeckos\n\nlizards\n\nsea turtles\n\nsnakes\n\ntortoises\n\nturtles\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nExamples of reptiles\n\nSOURCE\n\nEkaterina_P / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAll About Invertebrates\n\nApproximately 95% of all animals are invertebrates. Invertebrates do not have a backbone. There are different types of invertebrates, but they all share a few characteristics.\n\nThey are made up of many cells that work together or are multicellular.\n\nMost, but not all, have tissues, cells that work together in a more complex way.\n\nMost, but not all, can move.\n\nThere are over 35 phyla of invertebrates.\n\nThey generally have soft bodies.\n\nTypes of Invertebrates\n\nThere are eight phyla of invertebrates that are alive today.\n\nannelida - have a segmented body and primitive brain\n\narthropoda - have jointed appendages and an exoskeleton\n\ncnidaria - have tissues and an incomplete digestive system\n\nechinodermata - have some type of spiny structure on their outside\n\nmollusca - generally have soft bodies and a hard exoskeleton\n\nnematoda - unsegmented with worm-shaped bodies\n\nplatyhelminthes - soft, ribbon-like worms with no respiratory system\n\nporifera - multicellular organisms living in water with no organs or tissues\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExamples of Invertebrates\n\nMost invertebrates are insects, but there are over one million species of invertebrates in the world.\n\nanemone (cnidaria)\n\nclams (mollusca)\n\ncoral (cnidaria)\n\ncrabs (arthropoda)\n\nearthworms (annelida)\n\nflatworms (platyhelminthes)\n\ninsects (arthropoda)\n\njellyfish (cnidaria)\n\nleeches (annelida)\n\nroundworms (nematoda)\n\nsea urchins (echinodermata)\n\nsnails (mollusca)\n\nspiders (arthropoda)\n\nsponges (porifera)\n\nsquid (mollusca)\n\nstarfish (echinodermata)\n\ntapeworms (platyhelminthes)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nexamples of invertebrates\n\nSOURCE\n\nEkaterina_P / iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nAmazing Animals\n\nWhile all animals have a few things in common, they are a very diverse group of living things. You can learn more about animals by exploring things like names for groups of animals or even the names of animals in Spanish. You can learn about other living things by checking out the different types of plants in the world."
