        "text": "There are over one hundred species of bottom-dwelling moray eels (Muraenidae). The largest of these is Thyrsoidea macrurus, the giant moray eel. Like other eels, moray eels belong to the class of bony fish.\n\nThe moray eel has no scales. Instead, a slippery mucous covers its smooth skin for protection. The coloration of the skin also provides this bottom dwelling animal with camouflage. Although some moray eels blend into the rocky bottom, others are brightly colored. They have small fins used for thrust when swimming or slithering along the ocean floor. Moray eels have a single pair of gill slits. Unlike the gills of other fish, the slits of moray eels are circular. By keeping its mouth open, the moray eel can increase circulation through its gills to provide oxygen even when still.\n\nMoray eels have a pair of strong jaws with long pointed teeth. The shape and angle of these teeth prevent prey from escaping once trapped in the moray eelâ€™s mouth. The giant morays can grow to be ten feet long. Most of the other morays are smaller than that, but can still average two to three feet in length.\n\nThe moray eel generally hunts at night and hides during the day. Although they are rumored to attack humans, most moray eels are shy of divers and only attack if provoked. Instead, these fish prefer to feed on fish and mollusks. Moray eels usually have a den or rocky hole in which to conceal themselves while hunting. Often only their heads protrude from these holes while they lie in wait for prey.\n\nSince most moray eels have poor eyesight, they rely heavily on their sense of smell to hunt. Many of the larger moray eels will prey upon octopi much larger then their own size. Since both eels and octopi like to live in small rocky holes, these two species are often in conflict. Morays often solve this conflict by eating the offending octopus, one tentacle at a time. moray eels are found in the tropical waters of the Indian, Pacific, and western Atlantic Oceans. They prefer coral reefs or rocky-bottomed shallow waters.\n\nLike all fish, moray eels lay eggs to produce offspring. These eggs hatch into a tiny, leaf shaped planktonic larva called a leptocephalus. This three-inch juvenile eel rides the currents for at least eight months. Many leptocephalus are consumed by the filter feeders of the tropical ocean. The survivors mature into adult eels and settle to the ocean floor or reef surface to search for a lair."
