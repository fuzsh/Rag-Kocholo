        "text": "Animal group names\n\nThe collective nouns for groups of some animals are well known – a pride of lions or a herd of buffalo for example. Here I’ve started with my personal favourite top 5 and then below that I’ve listed in alphabetical order the definitive list of animal group names.\n\nI’m pleased to announce a new range of limited edition great ape prints including orangutans, mountain gorillas and chimpanzees as part of a fundraising project in partnership with The Orangutan Foundation UK, Jane Goodall Institute and Gorilla Doctors. To date we’ve donated £9000 from this project to these three NGO’s and we can send prints to anywhere on our lovely planet. Full info is here.\n\nA shrewdness of apes or band of gorillas- I took this photo in Uganda on one of my mountain gorilla tours.\n\n2) A skulk of bat eared foxes – taken in Ndutu, Tanzania\n\n3) A squadron of manta rays – below is a short video of hundred’s of these incredible animals I filmed at a mass gathering in Hanifaru bay\n\n4) A buffoonery of orangutans\n\nPeople often ask me what the collective noun for a group of orangutans is. Some say the answer is a buffoonery of orangutans but the correct reply really is that there is no name. In the wild, orangutans are one of the most solitary species of animals. Apart from mother’s with offspring and for brief mating periods they will virtually avoid all contact with each other. The exception is in Tanjung Puting where I run my Borneo orangutan holidays as here there are just so many orangutans that you will almost certainly see a buffoonery !\n\n5) A dazzle of zebras- Serengeti\n\nBelow is the alphabetical list of animal group names"
