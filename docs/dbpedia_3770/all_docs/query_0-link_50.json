        "text": "327 Fish Diversity Lab\n\nStation 1: Pre-Vertebrates\n\nPikaia\n\nCephalochordate (~ 5cm)\n\nPikaia gracilens, known only from the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale lagerstatte of British Columbia, is a small species that is likely important for understanding the features of early chordates.\n\nStructures:\n\nMyomeres\n\nNotochord\n\nHaikouella lanceolata\n\nStructures:\n\nNotochord\n\nPaired fin-folds\n\nWell developed brain and eyes\n\nLarge, laterally compressed body\n\nElongate branchial region with six gill arches, with gill rays lateral to the arches (possibly external)\n\nMyomeres (not chevron-shaped)\n\nNo cranium\n\n1. Name two examples of fossil forms that serve as early models of prevertebrates\n\n2. What characteristic(s) are missing that suggest that these are still transitional forms, but not quite Vertebrata yet?\n\nStation 2: Agnathans\n\nEarly Agnathans\n\nThe earliest undisputed vertebrate remains are represented by isolated dermal bone fragments from the base of the Horn Valley Siltstone, and probably also from the top of the Pacoota Sandstone, of the Amadeus Basin in central Australia. They are dated as Early Ordovician and referred to a group of armored jawless vertebrates, the Arandaspida. All other earlier fossils referred to the vertebrates remain more or less heatedly debated with the exception – to date – of Myllokunmingia and Haikouichthys, from the Lower Cambrian of Chengjiang, China.\n\nStructures:\n\nJawless\n\nCranium with sensory structures\n\nW shape myomeres\n\nNo evidence of bone or mineralized scales\n\nHaikouichthys\n\nMyllokunmingia\n\nText adapted from Ph.

Name four characteristics that characterize vertebrates, distinguishing them from other animals.\n\n2. What does Agnathan mean?\n\n3. Which fossil forms are considered the earliest vertebrates and what are some of their characteristics?\n\n4. Why is it becoming difficult to classify the beginning of the subphylum Vertebrata?\n\n5. What distinguishes hagfish from all other vertebrates?\n\n6. How do lamprey make their living? Are they found locally?\n\n7. Examine the lamprey cross sections and skeleton and identify chordate characteristics and gill arches.\n\n8. See if you can get an idea of the form of the vertebrae in the lamprey.\n\nStation 3: Placodermi and Acanthodi\n\nGnathostomes\n\nGnathostomes (“jaw-mouths”) are vertebrates that possess jaws, hinged structures attached to the cranium that allow an animal to grasp and tear its food. Early gnathostomes were jawed fishes that possessed two sets of paired fins, which increased their ability to maneuver accurately. These paired fins were pectoral fins, located on the anterior body, and pelvic fins, on the posterior. The evolution of these traits allowed gnathostomes to expand from the sedentary suspension feeding of jawless fishes and become mobile predators. This ability to exploit new nutrient sources led to their evolutionary success during the Devonian period.\n\nTwo early groups of gnathostomes were the acanthodians and placoderms, which arose in the late Silurian period and are now extinct. Most modern gnathostomes belong to the clades Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes. Gnathostomes later evolved into all tetrapods (animals with four limbs) including amphibians, birds, and mammals.\n\nClass Placodermi\n\nPlacoderms: Armored Fishes (“plate-skinned”)\n\nStructures:\n\nHead and thorax covered by armored plates\n\nJaws likely evolved from the first of their gill arches, in most species consisted of a single bone\n\nTrue teeth\n\nPelvic fins\n\nClass Acanthodi\n\nAcanthodians\n\nSpiny Sharks\n\nStructures:\n\nEpidermis covered with tiny rhomboid platelets\n\nCartilaginous skeleton\n\nFins with wide, bony base, reinforced on anterior margin with a dentine spine\n\nStation 4: Chondrichthyes\n\nSubclass Elasmobranchi\n\nSuperorder Squalea\n\nSqualeid Sharks represent a broad range of body plans within Elasmobranchs\n\n11 orders of sharks and other fishes\n\nMany bottom dwelling forms (flattened body plan, mouth and gill slits on bottom, eyes and spiricles on top of head)\n\nAngel sharks: intermediate between squaliform sharks and rays\n\nSawfishes have external teeth attached to snout, slash through fish schools\n\nSubclass Elasmobranchi\n\nSuperorder Squalea\n\nBatoidea: Skates and Rays\n\nBatoidea (Skates and Rays) found within the Squalea\n\nTaxonomy in dispute (6 orders or 1 order?)\n\nCharacterized by enlarged pectoral fins attached to side of head, ventral gill openings, blunt crushing teeth\n\nSkates are closely related to guitar fishes\n\nNo natural biological difference between skates and rays (terms often used interchangably)\n\nStation 4 (continued): Chondrichthyes\n\nSubclass Holocephali Ratfish or Chimera\n\nLong, independent evolutionary history from Elasmobranchs\n\nNote long slender tail\n\nNote clasper on head in males, used for reproduction\n\nAbout 30 species\n\nBottom dwelling in deep water\n\nNote gill flap over gill slits (atypical for chodrichthyes)\n\nSubclass Elasmobranchi\n\nSuperorder Galea\n\nGaleid Sharks are part of the Elasmobranchs\n\nTypically have classic “shark” shape\n\nMostly large pelagic forms with blade-like teeth\n\nContain largest fish, the whale shark (up to18m long)\n\nExamples of other galeid sharks include white shark, tiger shark, thresher shark, leopard shark, basking shark, hammerhead shark\n\nCartilaginous Skeleton\n\n*Locate the jaws of the shark\n\nNote how the jaws are only loosely associated with remainder of cranium\n\nThe jaws look like specially adapted gill arches (and are)\n\nJaws and gill arches are derived from different tissues than the rest of the skull\n\n*Find the Meckel’s Cartilage, Hyomandibula, Gill Arches, and Palatoquadrate\n\n* Note the difference between the trunk vertebrae and the tail vertebrae\n\n*Note the simple limb structure (four basics components)\n\nGirdle – Basal – Radial – fin rays -find the Radials and the Ceratotrichia in the fins -what bones make up the girdle and the basal structures in the pelvic and pubic regions? -what difference do you notice between the association of the axial skeleton and the pubic girdle vs. pelvic girdle?\n\n1.

What does the term Osteichthyes mean?\n\n2. What are the two major groups within Osteichthyes?\n\n3. What typically characterizes the Sarcopterygian fishes from other fishes?\n\n4. Which group of Sarcopterygians are freshwater fish and which are marine bottom dwellers?\n\n5. Which of these is the direct ancestor to tetrapods?\n\n6. Although Bichers, upon close examination, retain the features of a primitive Actinopterygian, why have some confused them with Sarcopterygians?"
