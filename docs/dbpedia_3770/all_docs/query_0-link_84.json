        "text": "Actinopterygii: Ray-Finned Fishes\n\nThe ray-finned fishes are named thusly because of their expandable fin rays. Sharks and rays have ceratotrichia, which give them an immovable fin. In contrast, ray-finned fishes have lepidotrichia, which are bony fin rays that allow them to open and close their fins. This can be observed in fishes that raise or lower their dorsal fins, or provide thrust with their pectoral and pelvic fins. However, the Sarcopterygians do have lepidotrichia, but they get their name from the lobe character of the fins. These fish reproduce externally by spawning, although there are some exceptions. This class makes up the majority of vertebrates.\n\nSWIM BLADDER: This subject is a particular favorite of mine! I have done research on the subject of swim bladders during my time at Cornell. The swim bladder actually evolved as lungs, because it is easier to breathe air than it is water. These lungs developed in the common ancestor of Actinopterygians and Sarcopterygians, but were adapted into swimbladders for buoyancy purposes. The swim bladder maintains neutral buoyancy, allowing a fish to maintain its position in the water column without expending energy.\n\nPHYSOSTOMOUS: The physostomous, or open, condition is found in basal Actinopterygians. Physostomes have a connection between their swim bladder and their gut tube, which allows them to \"inhale\" air from the surface into their bladder to inflate it and \"burp\" the air out of their bladder to deflate it. This condition mirrors that of lungs, because both are connected to the digestive system in one form or another. Some Actinopterygians still use their bladder for respiration. The connecting tube is known as the ductus pneumaticus.\n\nPHYSOCLISTOUS: The physoclistous, or closed, condition is found in derived Actinopterygians. The swim bladder is not connected to the gut in any way; it is \"closed\" from the gut. So how does the fish inflate/deflate their organ? There is a network of capillaries attached to the bladder, known as the rete mirable. There are specialized cells connected to the bladder that produce lactic acid, which causes oxygen to dissociate from the red blood cells. This causes the pressure of oxygen in the capillaries to drastically increase, becoming higher than the pressure within the bladder. Oxygen will eventually diffuse into the bladder, a system which works even when the fish is found at high pressures. Pressure is released through a window known as the ovale. Because these fish do not need to go to the surface to fill their swim bladder, they are able to reach much deeper depths than physostomes, who are limited by their proximity to the surface."
