        "text": "Hagfish and lampreys are jawless fishes (Agnathans) that are closely related to jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). They are regarded as the examples of primitive vertebrates. These two fishes are the sole survivor and representative of the jawless fishes. Let us differentiate between the two jawless fishes, in the table below.\n\nWhat is Hagfish?\n\nHagfish, also known as slime eel or slime hags are characterised by the amount of slimes they produce. They are marine vertebrates (primitive) that belong to the superclass of Agnatha (the Agnathans are a superclass or subphylum of jawless fishes).\n\nThe classification of a hagfish is as follows:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nSuperclass: Agnatha\n\nClass: Myxini\n\nOrder: Myxiniformes\n\nFamily: Myxinidae\n\nKnown species of the eel include Eptatretus goliath, Myxine kuoi, and Myxine glutinosa.\n\nPhysically, hagfishes look like an eel, with scaleless bodies. They are soft skinned and have three pairs of barbels (whisker-like sensory organs projecting near the mouth). They can grow up to 40 inches long, and do not contain jaws or bones. They are cartilaginous, with a notochord running through their body. Their notochord does not develop into a vertebral column like a true vertebrate.\n\nThough many animals secrete slime, hagfishes have multiple slime glands, and hence can produce up to 5 gallons of slime. The hagfishes act as nocturnal predators on small invertebrates, however they are better known for their scavenging abilities by consuming dead fishes. They can sometimes also eat the carcasses from inside out.\n\nHagfishes can be found in temperate and cold temperate regions worldwide, in ocean floors that are more than 30m deep. They are common in the diets of sea lions and seals. Commercially, their skin is used in the making of purses, wallets and briefcases.\n\nThe hagfishes produce slime as a response to stress. However, producing so much slime can sometimes be lethal for their own ventilation. To avoid drowning in their slime they form a knot in their tail that passes on to their head until the slime is wiped off. Additionally, the mucus helps in getting rid from the grip of predators.\n\nWhat is Lamprey?\n\nLamprey is a jawless fish-like vertebrate placed in the superclass Agnatha. Rather than having true vertebrae, it shows arcualia over the notochord.\n\nTheir classification is as follows:\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nSuperclass: Agnatha\n\nClass: Hyperoartia\n\nOrder: Petromyzontiformes\n\nFamily: Petromyzontidae\n\nWell-known genera of lampreys include Ichthyomyzon, Petromyzon, Lampetra and Lethenteron.\n\nThey are found in temperate regions worldwide except in coastal and fresh waters in Africa. They look like eels and have a scaleless body. They can grow up to 40 inches long. They are cartilaginous, without any bones or jaws present in their body.\n\nLampreys undergo metamorphosis where they develop from a burrowing freshwater larvae to parasitic adults. The lampreys begin their life after hatching from the eggs and forming a larvae called ammocoetes. They live in burrows in silt or mud in freshwater, and feed on microorganisms. At this stage they have underdeveloped eyes.\n\nThe larva then undergoes metamorphosis to migrate to the sea (the phenomenon of fish migration from fresh water to sea is called anadromy). They live a parasitic life in the sea where they attach themselves to a fish for nutritional requirements.\n\nThe lampreys however return to freshwater for reproduction. They build their nest, spawn (the process of laying eggs) and then die. However, some lampreys are non-parasitic, and do not migrate to the sea. They live in freshwaters for their whole life, reproduce and die. Example: Petromyzon marinus.\n\nHagfish vs Lamprey\n\nHagfish\n\nLamprey\n\nDescription\n\nHagfish are slime producing eels that live in marine environments.\n\nLampreys are eels that are found both in freshwater as well as marine environments.\n\nAlternate Name\n\nSlime eel\n\nNo such alternate name.\n\nOccurrence\n\nIt is found in marine environments.\n\nIt is found in both freshwater and seawater.\n\nParasitism\n\nHagfishes are parasitic in nature.\n\nSome lampreys are parasitic while some are not.\n\nScavengers\n\nHagfishes feed on dead fishes.\n\nNo such practice is found in lampreys.\n\nSlime Producing Capability\n\nHagfish produce a lot of slime, and it is a characteristic of the organism.\n\nLamprey does not produce slime.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe development of hagfish is direct.\n\nLampreys undergo metamorphosis where they develop from a larva to an adult.\n\nKnown Genera\n\nEptatretus\n\nMyxine\n\nIchthyomyzon\n\nPetromyzon\n\nLampetra\n\nLethenteron\n\nImportance\n\nHagfishes are common in the diet of sea lions and seals.\n\nTheir skins are used to make wallets, purses and briefcases.\n\nNo such importance was reported.\n\nExplore BYJU’S Biology for more interesting topics.\n\nAlso Read:"
