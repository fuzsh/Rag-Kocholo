In comparisons of streams with and without P. grandis, densities of sculpins were 21X higher in streams without pikeminnow (White and Harvey 2001). P070Morro BayEcological ImpactPredation Predation by Ptychocheilus grandis was considered a major threat to a population of anadromous Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss in Chorro Creek, a Morro Bay tributary. A removal program was conducted to reduce the Pikeminnow population (Halligan and Otte 2011). Predation by the Sacramento Pikeminnow may have also led to the extinction of the Tidewater Goby in Morro Bay (Lafferty et al. 1999).
