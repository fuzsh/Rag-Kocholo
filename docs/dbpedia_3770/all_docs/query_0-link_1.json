        "text": "It is thought freshwater eels were originally marine fish which adapted to live most of their lives in fresh water, and that the present distribution of the 18 species of freshwater eel is largely a result of continental drift.\n\nAnguilliformes are the order of fish that contain eels. Eels are distributed worldwide, and there are 720 species of 'true eels', or Anguilliformes. Almost all of these species are marine: for example, there are over 130 species of conger eels, 170 of moray eels, and 250 of worm (or snake) eels.\n\nAnguillidae is the family of fish that contains the majority of the freshwater eels. There are currently 18 recognised freshwater eels (Anguilla) species/subspecies worldwide, distributed in both tropical (around the equator) and temperate (between the tropics and polar circles) zones, with some species overlapping between these two zones.\n\nRecent studies indicate that tropical eels make much shorter migrations (100's of km) to spawn in areas near their freshwater habitats, compared to the long distances travelled by temperate eels (1000's of km).\n\nTable: Geographic ranges of freshwater eel species from around the world.\n\nReferences and further reading\n\nAoyama, J.
