        "text": "Physical description A snake-like boneless body with a cartilage “skeleton,” open gill holes, a jawless sucking disc mouth, and no fin rays. Color ranges from dark blue to brown. Adults average about 1 lb. and 30” long. A snake-like body with bones, a small pointed head, covered gill slits, weak jaws, many small teeth, and rayed fins. They are brown on the top and yellow on the bottom. Adults average about 4 lbs. and females: 5’, males: 3’ long. Reproduction and life history Anadromous, like salmon. Adults lay as many as 200,000 pinhead-sized eggs in streambed nests, then die. After 2-3 weeks, tiny (as small as 3/16”), blind ammocoetes emerge and burrow into the muddy stream bottom to feed for 4-7 years. During a two-month metamorphosis, they develop eyes and a sucking disc; the 4-7” juveniles then migrate to the ocean where they feed and mature for 2-3 years before returning to freshwater to spawn. Catadromous. Adults lay up to four million buoyant eggs that float on the ocean surface, then die. After 9-10 weeks, transparent eel larvae (called glass eels) hatch and drift with ocean currents, taking about a year to reach the Atlantic coast where they enter freshwater rivers and streams. Once in freshwater, they develop pigment and are called elvers. They feed and mature in freshwater for 10-14 years before returning to the ocean to spawn. They sometimes even cross wet grasslands on this migration."
