        "text": "Consumers\n\nSome zooplankton including copepods, rotifers, and larval stages of some fish and invertebrates are grazers and drift through the water grazing on phytoplankton. Larger animals, including some marine snails, fish, reptiles, and mammals, graze on algae. Filter feeders strain their food (plankton and detritus) directly from the water. Filter feeding animals include animals like bivalves, tube worms, sponges, and even large animals like baleen whales and manta rays.\n\nPredators more actively feed on other animals. There are many kinds of predators that feed on many kinds of prey. Pursuit predators like sharks, box jellyfish, sunflower sea stars, and many fish like herring, cod, and tuna hunt for their prey. Ambush predators like mantis shrimp, some octopuses, some eels, and scorpionfish, capture their prey by hiding and suddenly attacking. Animals that have few or no predators of their own are called top predators. These include killer whales, leopard seals, large sharks, sunflower sea stars, marlin, and other highly migratory species.\n\nHi everyone, I'm Sarah Hensley! This summer I got the incredible opportunity to complete the internship portion of my Ernest F. Hollings Undergraduate Scholarship. I worked with an amazing group of scientists at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center in the Cetacean Health and Life History Program in La Jolla, California. My project was largely based around learning how the diet of common dolphins (Delphinus spp) has been changing over time, as well as how it has been influenced by sea surface temperature.\n\nScavengers\n\nBut what happens when something dies without being eaten? The uneaten organisms and animal parts that are not consumed during feeding sink to the bottom, where they may be eaten by bottom-dwelling scavengers, like many crabs and lobsters. Organic material that remains is decomposed by bacteria and the resulting waste becomes nutrients usable by producers. When a whale dies, an entire ecosystem pops up to consume the sudden food source.\n\nOpportunistic feeders\n\nMany consumers are opportunistic feeders, meaning they may eat anywhere within the food web and may be a combination of any of the types described here. Sometimes they even eat each other.\n\nStudents across the nation in all 50 states looked up at their class projector screen this year and witnessed what some describe as “alien-like life decked out in discoware grooving across the dance floor!” They observed shimmery symmetrical diatoms, clear-bodied oozing shapes that morph before your very eyes, and a larval sea star that looks nothing like a star.\n\nEcosystem effects\n\nComplex food webs support diverse ecosystems. If one type of prey becomes scarce, a predator might switch to consuming more of another species it eats. However, changes in one part of the food web may cause a trophic cascade that affects organisms across multiple trophic levels. For instance, removing a top predator may cause its prey to become more abundant, as fewer individuals are eaten. But with more prey around, the organisms that it eats may become scarcer. Seemingly simple changes can have complex effects, with direct and indirect interactions rippling throughout entire ecosystems.\n\nHumans and aquatic food webs\n\nHumans play an important role as one of the top predators in these food webs. It is our responsibility to ensure that our fisheries are sustainable and that we are not polluting the ocean with toxins that bioaccumulate in food webs.\n\nEDUCATION CONNECTION\n\nEducation plays an important role in the health of our aquatic food webs. Whether students live inland or on the coasts, their actions affect the health of one of our major food sources. This collection contains a variety of multimedia, lesson plans, data, activities, and information to help students better understand the interconnectedness of food webs and the role of humans in that web."
