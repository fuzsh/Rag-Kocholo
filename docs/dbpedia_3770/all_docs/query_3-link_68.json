        "text": "Physical description\n\nLampreys have a long eel-like body, though they are only very distantly related to eels. In addition to not having jaws, lamprey lack a few other physical characteristics that many other fish share. They don’t have bones, scales, paired fins, or a swim bladder. Instead, their skeleton is made of cartilage and they only have two dorsal fins on their back and a caudal or tail fin. They breathe through seven gill pores or pouches on either side of their body.\n\nSize range\n\nAdults: 13–33 inches in length and up to 1 pound — the largest of Washington’s three native lampreys.\n\nEcology and life history\n\nPacific Lamprey are an important food resource in both the freshwater and saltwater environments. Many species of birds, mammals, and fish have been documented feeding on lamprey. They have a high fat content and are very calorically dense, containing 3–5 times more calories by weight than salmonids. Since Pacific Lamprey are such a desirably food resource for many species, they act as an important predation buffer for native salmonids. Larvae and juveniles reduce predation pressure on out migrating salmon smolts as lamprey are eaten by the same fish species as well as shore birds that prey on smolts. Returning adults are preyed on by marine mammals, such as sealions and harbor seals as well as river otters and minks in freshwater and can take the predation pressure off returning adult salmonids.\n\nPacific Lamprey also deliver important marine derived nutrients that increase the health of the freshwater systems. After the adult lamprey spawn and die, the nutrients in their bodies are broken down and recycled into the stream food chain. The nutrients support the growth of the next generation of lampreys as well as salmon and other native species.\n\nLampreys provide essential ecosystem services throughout their entire lifecycle. As larvae in the streambed, lampreys make habitats more suitable for other species by burrowing in the sediment and making the streambed softer, much like how earthworms do on land. They also breakdown and bring nutrients from the water column to the streambed through filter feeding, again improving the habitat for other species. When Pacific Lamprey return to freshwater as adults and build their nests, they create lower velocity habitat for salmonids and other freshwater species to utilize. They also increase food availability during nest construction by moving rocks and dislodging invertebrates and algae, and when they spawn they release many eggs, some of which provide food to other species. Lampreys are an integral part of both freshwater and marine ecosystems and we have a lot more to learn about these interconnected communities.\n\nSpawning\n\nBoth female and male Pacific Lamprey work together to build nests where they lay their eggs. They use their sucker mouths to move gravels and small cobbles to clear an area suitable to deposit the eggs. Most commonly they create roughly a circle shaped depression 1–2 ft in diameter in the substrate. Sometimes the nest can be much larger, and many individuals will work on moving the rocks to make depressions for the eggs. Females may lay up to 200,000 eggs. Eggs incubate for 3–4 weeks depending on stream temperatures before the larvae emerge and disperse downstream to nearby fine sediments. Spawning timing is also temperature dependent. Where water temperatures are warmer, Pacific Lamprey may spawn as early as February and where temperatures are colder Pacific Lamprey may spawn as late as August. Most spawning in Washington occurs from April–July.\n\nRearing\n\nImage\n\nPhoto by Joe Skalicky, USFWS\n\nLarval lamprey (also known as ammocoetes) are eyeless and burrow in fine sediments where they live for up to 10 years. Larval lamprey are filter feeders; they stick their heads out of their burrows and consume drifting detritus and algae that is in the water column. Through filter feeding, larval lamprey play an important role in making nutrients accessible to other species in the stream food web. They also act like an aquatic earthworm by burrowing into the streambed and make the habitat a healthier place for other species. During this freshwater stage, larval lamprey may move downstream volitionally at night to find better feeding habitat or they may be washed downstream during high flow events. Densities of larval lampreys can exceed 100 fish per square yard in optimal habitats.\n\nAfter years rearing in the stream environment, larval lamprey transforming into juveniles, readying themselves to feed in salt water. At this stage, the lamprey temporarily stops feeding and spends all its energy on transformation, which includes developing eyes and teeth. The teeth are part of their characteristic oral disc that will allow the lamprey to attach and suction on to their hosts in the ocean.\n\nAfter the transformation is complete, juvenile lamprey migrate downstream to the ocean and latch on to a host species to begin feeding. Once attached to their host, they extract blood and body fluids but do not consume flesh. Through fishing and stock assessment data gathering, numerous fish species have been identified as the hosts for juvenile Pacific Lamprey, such as Pacific salmon, flatfish, rockfish, Walleye Pollock, and Pacific Hake. Rarely, Pacific Lamprey have been observed feeding on whales, too. Though not a lot is known about this life stage of Pacific Lamprey, the healed scars on host fish show that many individual hosts survive having a lamprey attached. It is not known how many hosts a single lamprey will attach to or how often they change hosts, but Pacific Lamprey feed in the ocean for 1–6 years. After this time spent growing the ocean, Pacific Lamprey stop feeding and return to freshwater, becoming adults. Unlike salmonids, lamprey do not return to their natal (original) stream, but instead follow scents in the water to spawning grounds. These scents include the smell of pheromones that are released by larval lamprey and signal there is good rearing habitat nearby. Some adults enter freshwater in summer and fall and then overwinter (“stream-maturing”), holding in deep pools and under logs and rocks, before spawning in spring or early summer. Other adults will enter freshwater in the spring (“ocean-maturing”) and will spawn shortly after entering the freshwater.\n\nGeographic range\n\nPacific Lamprey are native to the North Pacific and can be found from California to Alaska and across the Bering Sea to Russia and Japan. This range is similar to that of Pacific salmonids like steelhead, Coho, and Chinook. Also, like Pacific salmonids, Pacific Lamprey are anadromous, they rear in freshwater before migrating to the ocean to grow and then return to freshwater to spawn. Pacific Lamprey can travel hundreds of miles inland to find quality spawning and rearing habitat. Historically, Pacific Lamprey inhabited large to medium streams across this range. Today, they can be found in a significantly smaller portion of the previously inhabited area due to the construction of dams and other fish passage barriers that that block migration to and from the ocean."
