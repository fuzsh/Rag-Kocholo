        "text": "I’m writing up a list of misconceptions that people (particularly high schoolers) have about classifying animals. I would love to hear what animals you think people often confuse or misplace (e.g., “A dolphin is a fish!”). Give me your best confusing organisms! (Plants are good too).\n\nHere is my list so far. Please correct me if you see any mistakes, and I would love to hear any additions!\n\nInvertebrates:\n\nJellyfish: this is a cnidarian. Most students think it is a fish because it contains the word “fish.” Remind students that fish are way more complex. Fish have a head, brain, bilateral symmetry, digestive system, blood, endoskeleton, and vertebra. A jellyfish has none of these things.\n\nStarfish: this is an echinoderm. Most students think it is a fish.\n\nScorpion: this is an arachnid. Some students think it is a reptile, because it lives in the desert with lizards and snakes.\n\nHarvestmen: this is an arachnid. Students often call it a “Daddy long legs,” but it is not to be confused with spiders, which are a different category of arachnids.\n\nVertebrates:\n\nSeahorse: this is a fish, and most students understand this. A few students think that it is in a different category than “fish” because of it’s unusual appearance.\n\nShark: this is a fish, and most students understand this. A few think it is a mammal because it is similar to a dolphin. This is a good way to bring up convergent evolution and analogous structures.\n\nSalamander and newts: these are amphibians. A newt is a type of salamander. Many people think there are separate categories, but a newt is a subcategory of a salamander. People often think salamanders and newts are reptiles because of their lizard-like appearance. However, they are amphibians because they lay soft-shelled eggs in the water, go through metamorphosis, are cold-blooded, and do not have claws.\n\nFrogs vs toads: these are amphibians. Many people think they are separate taxonomical categories, but actually a toad is a subcategory of frog. Toads tend to have drier skin and shorter legs than other types of frogs.\n\nTurtles and tortoises: this is an aquatic reptile. Many students classify it as an amphibian because it is sometimes green and it lives in the water. They also forget that turtles have scales, and they think it has smooth skin like a frog.\n\nStudents may also not know the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. Many people think they are separate categories, but a tortoise is actually a subcategory of turtle. “Turtles” are an order, while “tortoises” are a family belonging to that order.\n\nThe order of turtles have a defining characteristic of a shell, which forms from its ribs. Other reptiles do not have a shell.\n\nA tortoise is a type of turtle that only lives on land. Typically, tortoise shells are rounder than other species of turtles. Other turtles typically have flatter shells that streamline it for swimming**.**\n\nIchthyosaurs: this is an unusual category of extinct marine reptile. When students see it, they often think it is a fish (like a shark) or a mammal (like a dolphin). It is confusing since they gave live birth (like a mammal) and they have flippers (like a fish). It is not a fish because it did not have gills—instead, it came up to the surface to breathe, like reptiles or mammals. It is not a mammal because there was no fur, hair, or mammary glands present.\n\nCrocodile and alligators: this is a reptile (specifically, an archosaur with a gizzard and 4-chambered heart, which are traits that make it a little more complex than turtles and lizards). Some students would accidentally classify it as an amphibian because they see it both in the water and on land. Sometimes they classify it as a mammal because of its large size.\n\nPterodactyl: this is a flying reptile (specifically, an archosaur). Many students classify this as a bird because it flies.\n\nStudents sometimes think that birds evolved from pterodactyls, but birds would’ve evolved from theropods (which includes T-Rex, velociraptor, oviraptor, etc.) Wings start a good discussion on convergent evolution and analogous structures.\n\nT-Rex: this is a reptile (specifically, an archosaur). Because dinosaurs are extinct, students often don’t put them in the same schema or mental category as living creatures. They might say, “Dinosaurs are extinct and in their own category, they don’t belong to reptiles.”\n\nBecause some students have heard that birds evolved from dinosaurs, some students would put T-Rex into a “bird” category. However, a bird would be a subcategory of dinosaur, but a dinosaur would not be a subcategory of bird.\n\nManatee: This is a mammal. Many students have never heard of a manatee, sea cow, or dugong. It’s a good idea to include a picture of a manatee when discussing it. Because it is aquatic, some students are tempted to classify it as a type of large fish.\n\nDolphin: this is a mammal, which most students understand. A few would classify this as a fish, similar to sharks.\n\nI guess it depends how in-depth you want to go! The more you look at different types of organisms, the more you start finding out weird things about what is and isn’t related. And I guess it also depends how in-depth you want to go. Here are just a few examples that I can think of:\n\nThe slow worm, sometimes called a deaf adder or a blind worm, is neither a worm nor a snake, but a type of legless lizard. But snakes themselves are actually a type of legless lizard as well! The extinct mosasaurs were also a specialised type of lizard, but New Zealand’s tuatara is not a lizard at all despite looking very much like one.\n\nThe killer whale is a species of dolphin, but all dolphins are themselves a type of whale, so that one’s not really a big deal.\n\nThe sawshark is a type of shark, but the very similar sawfish is instead a ray despite looking very much like a shark.\n\nTermites look very much like ants and are sometimes called ‘white ants’, but they are not closely related, and in fact termites are a type of cockroach, whereas ants (and bees as well) are a type of wasp! Similarly, aphids are sometimes called ‘greenflies’, but they are not a type of fly at all - and neither are dragonflies, butterflies, sawflies, or mayflies. And oddly enough, insects themselves are actually a type of crustacean! Within crustaceans there are many crazy things that don’t make sense - e.g. hermit crabs are not actually a type of true crab, and mantis shrimp are definitely not shrimp!\n\nCaecilians look rather like large earthworms, or perhaps an odd snake, but they are actually amphibians. Blind snakes are also often mistaken for worms, but they are indeed snakes as the name suggests.\n\nSome animals, like corals or sponges, may be mistaken for plants or for each other, but of course they are animals and they are not very closely-related to each other either.\n\nEels and sea snakes may easily be confused for each other, and there are many different types of fish that have taken on an eel-like body but are not closely related.\n\nAs well as harvestmen like you mentioned, there are also many different arachnid groups that might be mistaken for spiders and scorpions - vinegaroons, amblypygids, solifuges, schizomids, and even non-arachnids like sea spiders, bat flies, some crabs, and mimics like the spiny leaf insect.\n\nJellyfish, comb jellies, and salps look very similar to each other, but none of them are closely-related at all.\n\nEagles, hawks, and kites are all closely-related, but falcons are completely different, as are owls and their unrelated lookalikes, frogmouths.\n\nWorms are probably the worst of them all! Earthworms, tapeworms, ribbon worms, peanut worms, nematode worms, acorn worms, ship worms, penis worms (yes really!), acoel worms, tongue worms, thorny-headed worms, horsehair worms, horseshoe worms, slow worms, jaw worms, arrow worms, and velvet worms are all in completely different phyla, so they are about as distantly-related as it is possible to get within the animal kingdom!"
