        "text": "There are over 28,000 different species of fish in the world, several hundred of which are present in British waters. There are many different ways of classifying fish, and anyone doing any research into the types of fish which are found around Britain will soon come across numerous terms which are used to divide fish into different groups and categories. most anglers simply divide fish into broad groups such as flatfish, roundfish, skates and ray, shark species etc. However, looking deeper into this subject reveals that the official scientific system of classifying fish (and indeed all living animals) takes a much more complex form. All living life can be places into the following hierarchy of biological classification.\n\nBony Fish\n\nThe vast majority of fish found in British waters fall into the class of Osteichthyes or bony fish, so called because their body is based around a skeleton made up of lots of small bones. Anyone gutting a cod, haddock or similar fish will see how many bones are present in this type of fish. Other characteristics which bony fish possess include one gill slit on either side of the body and one or more sets of paired fins. All bony fish also have scales on their body – even so-called scaleless fish such as fish such as rockling actually have tiny scales which are embedded into the skin and are not visible, but they are present. Bony fish are the most common type of fish not just around Britain and Ireland but around the world – of the 28,000 species of fish found worldwide approximately 27,000 are classed as bony fish. Bony fish are sub-divided into two categories: ray finned fish and lobe finned fish.\n\nRay Finned Fish: Bony fish which have fins made up of spines (rays) with skin stretched between them fall into the classification of Actinopterygii (ray finned fish). The majority of fish species caught by anglers around the UK fall into this classification. Bony fish can be further divided into flatfish and roundfish – but they are all ray finned bony fishes.\n\nExamples in British Waters: Cod, haddock, flounder, plaice, rockling, hake, dab, John Dory, sprat, mackerel, king of herrings, pouting, sunfish, coalfish, pollock, bass, mullet and many others.\n\nLobe Finned Fish: The other type of bony fish are in the class Sarcopterygii and are known as lobe finned fish. These fish do not have fins made up of rays with skin stretched across the, but instead have fins made up of lobes – fleshy appendages which are attached to the body. Lobe finned fish have been around for hundreds of millions of years and are important evidence of evolution as the lobes developed to help fish get out of the sea and move across land – a key step in animal life moving from the sea and to the land. While there were many species of lobe finned fish around millions of years ago the vast majority are now extinct.\n\nExamples in British Waters: None. Most lobe finned fish are now extinct. The several species of freshwater lungfish are examples of lobe finned fish which survive to this day, as are the two species of coelacanth which live in Indian and African waters.\n\nCartilaginous Fish – Sharks, Rays and Skate\n\nCartilage is connective tissue, found in many animals including humans (for example in the nose), it is more flexible and less brittle than bone, while also being strong and durable. Shark and ray species have a skeleton made out of cartilage, rather than bone (as well as several other physiological differences) which puts them into the Chondrichthyes class. Out of the 28,000 species of fish in the world around 970 are in this class. In British and Irish waters the main cartilaginous fish species are sharks, rays and skates.\n\nSharks: Shark species have many differences to bony fish. As well as the cartilaginous skeleton all shark species fins which are all one section and are not divided into segmented sections with spiny-rays like in bony fish. Sharks also have multiple gill slits (usually four to six on each side of the body), whereas fish only have one on each side. Another feature of sharks is that they do not have scaly skin like bony fish, but have skin made of dermal denticles (translation: little teeth) which makes all shark species rough to the touch. Sharks also lack a swim bladder, meaning they have to keep swimming or they will sink and have paired nases (nostrils). This way of classifying sharks explains how the humble lesser-spotted dogfish and the great white shark are classed together: both have cartilage skeletons, paired nases, non-ray fins, rough scaleless skin and multiple gill slits. Any angler catching a dogfish really is telling the truth when they say they have caught a shark!\n\nExamples in British Waters: Common shark species such as lesser-spotted dogfish, bull huss, spurdog, smooth-hound, tope and the large shark species which are found around the UK such as blue shark, thresher shark, basking shark and the shortfin mako.\n\nSkates and Rays: Read anything about skates and rays and it will often say that they are related to sharks. This is because they also feature skeletons made out of cartilage and do not have ray-fins. Like sharks rays and skates also lack a swim bladder, meaning they can only move up through the water column with swimming power, and also have paired nases. Despite their very different appearance to sharks both skates, rays and sharks may all come from a common ancestor many hundreds of millions of years ago. However, since cartilage does not remain preserved in the same way bone does it is very difficult for scientists to trace the history of these creatures through fossils in the same way they can with fish.\n\nExamples in British Waters: All ray species (thornback, blonde, small eyed etc.) and the common skate.\n\nOther Cartilaginous Fish: A rare example of another type of cartilaginous fish in the waters of the British Isles is the range of rabbit fish species. This is a species of fish which lives in very deep water (1000 – 3000m) and is never encountered by rod and line anglers. Rabbit fish species have a cartiligious skeleton and non-ray fins which puts them into the same Chondrichthyes class as sharks. However, rabbit fish are placed in the Chimaeriformes order as they are thought to have broke away from sharks in evolutionary terms several hundred million years ago and have remained a separate order ever since. Lampreys also have a skeleton made out of cartilage but defy easy classification (see below).\n\nOther Types of Fish"
