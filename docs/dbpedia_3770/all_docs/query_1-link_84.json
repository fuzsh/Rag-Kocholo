        "text": "You may have heard of a few ways of generating electricity. Things like wind turbines and batteries. But did you know that some living things can also generate electricity?\n\nCan you think of any animals that could do this? If you thought of electric eels, you’d be right!\n\nDid you know?\n\nAn electric eel isn’t a type of eel. It’s actually a type of knifefish.\n\nElectric eels are probably the best known electrogenic animals. Electrogenic animals can generate their own electricity. There are also animals that can detect electricity. They’re called electroreceptive.\n\nMost electrogenic animals are also electroreceptive. But there are many electroreceptive animals that are not electrogenic. Some electroreceptive animals are echidnas, platypuses, bees, spiders, dolphins, sharks and rays. Some types of bacteria, yeast and fish are also electrogenic.\n\nElectric Fish\n\nAlmost 350 species of fish can generate and detect electrical signals. Why so many fish? It can be very dark underwater. Fish can use electricity to communicate and move around in the dark. They can also use it to attack prey.\n\nScientists classify electric fish into two groups. Weakly electric and strongly electric.\n\nWeakly Electric Fish\n\nWeakly electric fish have electric organs in their tails. This structure can generate up to one volt of electricity. An AA battery generates 1.5 volts of electricity. The electric field produced by electric organs travels about 1 metre around the fish.\n\nWeakly electric fish also have special cells in their skin. Electroreceptor cells help the fish sense changes in its own electric field. The fish can sense the size, shape and location of objects through changes in its electric field. It can also sense if there are other, similar fish nearby. This ability is called electrolocation.\n\nWeakly electric fish don’t make enough electricity to attack prey.\n\nThe elephantnose fish is an example of a weakly electric fish.\n\nStrongly Electric Fish\n\nOnly a few types of fish are strongly electric. These include electric eels, electric catfishes and electric rays.\n\nDid you know?\n\nStrongly electric fish were once used in medical treatments. Electric stimulation was used to treat pain, headaches and gout.\n\nThe elephantnose fish only has one electric organ. But electric eels have three pairs of electric organs! Together these organs make up four-fifths of the eel’s body.\n\nEels generate low-voltage pulses for electrolocation. But they generate high-voltage pulses for hunting and self-defence. These pulses can be up to 860 volts. Electric eels are the most powerful electric fish. Shocks from them can be deadly to humans.\n\nHow do these fish generate electricity?\n\nThe fish’s electric organ is filled with disc-shaped cells. These are called electrocytes. Electrocytes are positively charged on the outside. They are negatively charged on the inside.\n\nBut sometimes the fish sends a message from its brain. This signal travels through its nervous system to its electric organ. There, it changes the pattern of electrical charges in the cells. One side of each stack becomes positive. The other side becomes negative.\n\nThis alternating pattern of charges creates an electrical current. This turns the electrocytes into a living battery! The signals reach the cells at exactly the same time. This turns stacks of electrocytes into a series of batteries. This increases their total voltage.\n\nSo why don’t these fish zap themselves?"
