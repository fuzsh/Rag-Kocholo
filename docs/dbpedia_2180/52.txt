Based in Prague, Acid Row have newly released their Afterglow LP, and next month, the Czechia-based outfit will team up with Linz, Austria’s Swanmay for an 11-date tour starting in Acid Row‘s hometown and moving toward (and through) home-base for Swanmay as they hit stops along the way. Swanmay are looking to issue their second long-player, Frantic Feel, later in 2022 as the follow-up to 2017’s Stoner Circus. As that album is apparently in the can, it wouldn’t be a surprise in the slightest if they threw a couple new songs into the set. Seems only proper.

There are two open slots, and I like to think that we live in a world where I might post a tour with open slots and someone might see that they’re open and say, “hey, I live near wherever they were the night before or are going the night after, and I like cool shows. I think I’ll put one on.” And then do that. And maybe it’s someone who’s put on shows before, and maybe not. Maybe someone tries something new, decides it’s awesome and keeps doing it. Then there’s more places to play for bands, and fewer open slots on tours. And everyone gets paid and fed and, while we’re at it, universal healthcare. That’d be great.

Point is help out if you can. From the PR wire:

SWANMAY & ACID ROW Tour

Swanmay is a Doom inspired Stoner/Grunge trio from Austria, founded in 2014. With amp-walls, aluminum guitars and an arsenal of fuzz pedals they were able to manifest their distinctive heavy stoner sound and play dozens of shows all over Europe as a support for Kadavar, Truckfighters, Brant Bjork, The Atomic Bitchwax, Elder, Ufommamut and many more.

The three Fuzzgeeks have now recorded their second full length album „Frantic Feel” and are more than ready to play live again. LP#2 will be released later in 2022.

If Robert Johnson would have reached the days of electric guitars and amps, he might have considered jamming with Czech stoner lunatics from Acid Row. A three-piece from Prague combining different genres and subgenres related mainly to stoner rock with tendencies and attitude of punk, echoes of doom metal, hazed with elements of psychedelic rock, poignant noise rock or 90’s grunge.
