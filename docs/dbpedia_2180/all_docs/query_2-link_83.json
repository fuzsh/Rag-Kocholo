        "text": "Often the same sensory stimulus can trigger different behavioral responses within a single organism. For example, appetitive odorants that are attractive while hungry may not drive the same behavioral response after feeding to satiety (Vogt et al., 2021). How neural circuits process sensory stimuli to flexibly drive varying outcomes is not fully understood. It is hypothesized that different neuromodulators should be involved in mediating state-dependent changes in neural and behavioral responses (Lizbinski and Dacks, 2017; Sayin et al., 2018). However, whether neuromodulation globally changes responses to sensory cues (i.e., nonspecific increases or decreases) or mediates selective alterations in sensory input-driven behavior, and how this is achieved, is not clear (Anton and Rössler, 2021).\n\nIn insects, serotonin (5HT) is a key neuromodulator that is linked with the regulation of many behaviors, including feeding (Tierney, 2020), socialization (Ries et al., 2017; Rogers et al., 2004; Anstey et al., 2009), aggression (Rillich and Stevenson, 2018; Dierick and Greenspan, 2007), and mating (Chen et al., 2022; Pooryasin and Fiala, 2015). Food intake is known to be highly dependent on the serotonin levels in the brain of an organism. Elevated levels of serotonin have been shown to decrease the time spent feeding and the amount of consumed food in blowflies and flesh flies (Dacks et al., 2003; Long and Murdock, 1983). In Drosophila larvae and adults, inhibition of neural serotonin synthesis or global increase of serotonin levels increases or suppresses food intake, respectively (Neckameyer, 2010; Eriksson et al., 2017; Majeed et al., 2016). In locusts, serotonin is linked to triggering phenotypical plasticity. A spike in serotonin levels in the locust brain is highly correlated with the solitary stage (Guo et al., 2013), whereas high levels of serotonin in the locust thoracic ganglion are known to trigger the transformation of solitary animals into gregarious ones (Rogers et al., 2004; Anstey et al., 2009). Serotonin modulation has also been linked with increased activity and aggression in crickets and flies (Dierick and Greenspan, 2007, de Boer et al., 2016), as well as a reduction in courtship behaviors, like male wing extension toward females and mating in flies (Pooryasin and Fiala, 2015).\n\nHow serotonin alters sensory processing to drive these behavioral changes is yet to be completely resolved. In olfaction, serotonin is known to modify the processing of odor-driven neural signals right from the periphery. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, the serotonergic release is known to reduce olfactory sensory neuron output to the following circuit through presynaptic GABAergic inhibition (Gaudry, 2018; Petzold et al., 2009; Lv et al., 2023). In contrast, exogenous serotonin is known to increase the odor-evoked responses of second-order neurons in the insect antennal lobe and vertebrate olfactory bulb (Gaudry, 2018; Brill et al., 2016). The serotonin-mediated increase in odor-evoked responses has been reported to be odor-specific and hypothesized to enhance the sensitivity to odorants in a state-dependent manner (Dacks et al., 2009).\n\nHow are odor-evoked neural responses modulated to produce flexible, odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes? In this study, we examined this question in the locust olfactory system. We show that serotonin can increase or decrease innate appetitive behavioral responses in an odor-specific manner. In contrast, exogenous serotonin increased the strength of odor-evoked neural responses for all odorants without altering the temporal processing features or the ensemble response fidelity. We present a simple model to map the serotonin-mediated amplification of neural responses onto odor-specific changes in behavioral outcomes. Finally, we examine the relevance of these findings for modulating hunger-state-dependent modulation of appetitive responses in locusts. In sum, our results provide a more systems-level view of how a specific neuromodulator (serotonin) alters neural circuits to produce flexible behavioral outcomes.\n\nWe examined how serotonin modulates odor-evoked neural and behavioral responses in locusts to a small but diverse panel of odorants. Our behavioral results revealed that serotonin increased innate appetitive responses to a subset of odorants (HEX and BZA). In contrast, responses to aversive or neutral odorants like LOOL (Beier et al., 2014) or AMN (Delventhal et al., 2017) decreased or had no significant change in their response levels. Consistent with the behavioral result, we found that the strength of the stimulus-driven responses increased in several PNs in the antennal lobe. However, the overall combination of neurons activated, and their temporal patterns of activation (ON vs. OFF responses), remained consistent. As a direct consequence, the identity of the odorant could be robustly maintained after exogenous serotonin introduction. Finally, fed locusts injected with serotonin generated similar appetitive PORs to odorants as observed in starved locusts.\n\nPrior results from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate models have shown similar changes in odor-evoked neural responses in the antennal lobe (Gaudry, 2018; Dacks et al., 2009; Kloppenburg and Hildebrand, 1995; Kloppenburg et al., 1999; Dacks et al., 2008). The increase in the spiking activity of second-order neurons seems inconsistent with the serotonergic gating of sensory input through presynaptic inhibition (Petzold et al., 2009; Lv et al., 2023). Our results indicate that serotonin also modified the overall excitability of individual PNs and made them fire action potentials in bursts. Hence, it is possible that the increased neural sensitivity could compensate for the decreased input from sensory neurons. The change in input–output mapping as a result of serotonin introduction resulted in an increase in the behavioral response to different concentrations of HEX and BZA.\n\nIn contrast to the changes in the response strength, our results indicate that the timing of odor-evoked spiking activity was robustly maintained. As a result, the combination of neurons activated during and immediately after the presentation of the odorant remained similar before and after the introduction of serotonin. Hence, serotonergic modulation altered sensitivity to some odorants without altering the identity of the odorant. These results are consistent with prior imaging studies in flies that reported odor-specific changes in glomerular activity (Dacks et al., 2009). Further, this interpretation of our physiological results is consistent with the behavioral observation that serotonin altered response levels in an odor-specific manner.\n\nHowever, behavioral responses could both increase or decrease depending on the odor identity. In contrast, our neural data indicated an enhancement for all odorants examined. This apparent mismatch between neural and behavioral responses could be resolved using a very simple linear regression model. In the model, a subset of neurons that were activated strongly by odorants with stronger PORs received positive weights. In contrast, the subset of neurons that responded to odorants that evoked fewer PORs received negative weights. Notably, the segregation of neural subsets based on the behavioral relevance and the opposing weights assigned to them was sufficient to produce odor-specific increase or decrease in behavioral PORs as observed during serotonergic modulation.\n\nThe model used for mapping neural responses onto behavior only required that odorants that evoke or suppress PORs activate distinct sets of neurons. It is worth noting that such segregation of neural responses could happen at any neural circuit along the olfactory pathway. Our extracellular recording data (Figure 6E) indicate that hexanol (high PORs) and linalool (low PORs) do indeed activate highly nonoverlapping sets of PNs in the antennal lobe. Hence, our results suggest that the segregation of neural activity based on behavioral relevance begins very early along the olfactory pathway.\n\nWhile serotonin is implicated in a range of behaviors, the modulation of feeding behavior is widely conserved across invertebrates and vertebrates. Hence, we finally explored whether this role is conserved in locusts as well. We found that the appetitive response evoked by a food-related odorant (HEX; green-leaf volatile; Bertrand et al., 2021) was reduced in animals that were fed. Notably, we found that serotonin application in locusts that were fed recovered back their appetitive response to HEX. Earlier studies have shown that serotonergic neurons could mediate a hunger-state-dependent switch in behavioral response preference (attraction vs. repulsion) to the same food-related odorant in fruit fly larvae (Vogt et al., 2021). Our studies complement these findings and show how serotonin could modulate behavioral responses to different odorants in a stimulus-specific manner."
