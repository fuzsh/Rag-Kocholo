        "text": "Zote is a traveller from outside Hallownest who came to the Kingdom to fulfill a promise. This is ultimately revealed to be a promise of glory for himself. He named his nail \"Life Ender\" because names supposedly have power. Unfortunately, because it is made of shellwood, it cannot deal damage. While he claims to be the strongest warrior in the land, he is found trapped by weak enemies or claiming the glory of another bug's deeds. He regards the Knight as beneath him and accuses them of constantly getting in his way.\n\nFound along the path leading to Greenpath. He is held in the mandibles of a Vengefly King, and the Knight has the choice to either save him or leave him. If saved, he complains that the Knight got in the way between him and his \"prey\", he introduces himself and boasts about his supposed mighty deeds.\n\nIf he is not saved before acquiring the Mantis Claw, he dies in this location, with his nail and shell remaining. Hitting his shell here grants the Neglect achievement.\n\nIf he is saved in Greenpath, Zote shows up in Dirtmouth, where he once again talks to the Knight in an arrogant fashion.\n\nZote can be found in a corridor leading back to the storerooms of the City of Tears. He has forgotten the Knight and introduces himself again.\n\nFound stuck in spider webs, presumably having been captured by the beasts of Deepnest. Once again the Knight has the choice to either save him or leave him, though this time leaving him does not result in his death. If saved, he once again complains about the Knight meddling in his supposed heroics.\n\nIf the Knight saves him both times, he is captured and can be found in the resting area of the Colosseum of Fools, where he brags about his skills and how his capture was part of his plan. He then becomes the final boss of the first trial. As a boss, he deals no damage due to his nail being made of shellwood. He simply has to be attacked until the fight is over. He is quite inept in combat and regularly messes up his jumps. Beating him grants the Rivalry achievement.\n\nThese bindings about me, I've chosen to erect. There is some shame I feel from my own part in the deed, and this method guarantees it cease.\n\n– White Lady\n\nThe White Lady is an NPC in Hollow Knight. She gifts one half of the Kingsoul to the Knight in the Queen's Gardens.\n\nLore\n\nThe White Lady is a root higher being[2] who used to be the Queen of Hallownest[3][4] and the wife of the Pale King. During Hallownest’s prime, the Queen's Gardens were her well-guarded retreat.[5] This area used to belong to the Mosskin, but the White Lady claimed it to create her gardens.[6]\n\nThe White Lady is the mother of the Vessels.[7][8] Out of shame for her part in their creation, she bound herself in the Queen's Gardens to stop herself from having more offspring.[9] Dryya, one of the Five Great Knights, stood guard over her, although Dryya died after defeating numerous Mantis Traitors. The White Lady is not aware of her death.[10]\n\nOver time, the White Lady's vision worsened and she could not see much anymore.[11] She did sense within her roots the weakening of the Hollow Knight, prompting her to await a visit from a Vessel to give them her part of the Kingsoul.[12][13]\n\nIn-game events\n\nThe White Lady is found in the northwest part of the Queen's Gardens inside a cocoon-like dwelling. Outside this structure is the corpse of Dryya.\n\nWhen the Knight first meets her, she gifts her half of the Kingsoul to them. She then asks the Knight to defeat the Hollow Knight and take their place in sealing the Radiance.[14]\n\nAfter the Knight has obtained the completed Kingsoul, she comments on their strength and dedication, wondering if they could be more than simply a Vessel.[15] She tells the Knight to visit their birthplace in the Abyss to find out what is at the heart of the Kingsoul.[15]\n\nThe White Lady can be offered a Delicate Flower but she refuses it, explaining that the flower originates from outside Hallownest and holds rare power.\n\nShe makes an appearance in Godhome in the Pantheon of Hallownest, with the Godseeker commenting on her lore and backstory. In this form the White Lady seems to be unbound and without constraints. The Godseeker mentions that the White Lady hides from their attunement, and wonders if she diminishes herself by choice.[1]\n\nDialogue\n\nGeneral\n\nFirst Encounter Oh! One arrives. Far it walks to find me. Did it seek my aid? Or did the path carry it by chance to so pertinant sic a place?\n\nIt is true. True, that you were awaited. No. Perhaps that is inaccurate. True one like you was awaited.\n\nI have a gift, held long for one of your kind. Half of a whole. When united, great power is granted, and on the path ahead, great power it will need.\n\nAfter picking up the White Fragment Within my roots, the weakening of the Vessel I plainly feel. Only two obvious outcomes there are from such a thing.\n\nThe first is inevitable on current course, regression, all minds relinquished to that pernicious plague.\n\nThe second I find preferable, and would seek your aid in its occurance, sic replacement.\n\nI implore you, usurp the Vessel. Its supposed strength was ill-judged. It was tarnished by an idea instilled. But you. You are free of such blemishes. You could contain that thing inside.\n\nListening again I'll offer fair warning. The Vessel may itself be weak, but it is much empowered by that force within.\n\nTo claim its role requires strength of some magnitude. Prepare yourself well before attempting the task.\n\nExhausted dialogue Prepare well, but don't dally. Were the Vessel to break prematurely, that plague would unleash with rage and power built of ages chained. Listening after returning Do I seem prisoner here? If so, it's not by any choice but my own. These bindings about me, I've chosen to erect.\n\nThere is some shame I feel from my own part in the deed and this method guarantees it cease.\n\nI still feel that urge you see. I always will. A voracious desire to spread seeds upon the land, to propogate sic myself, to breed.\n\nListening after acquiring the King's Brand It faced the Gendered Child? She's a fierce foe, strong in mind and body, striking reflection of her mother, though the two were permitted little time together.\n\nI never begrudged the Wyrm's dalliance as bargain. In fact, I feel some affection for the creature birthed.\n\nIf your paths were ever to align, I imagine you might gain yourself a powerful ally.\n\nDream Nailed So it can access a mind? Then the seals shall break before its blade.\n\nReacting to Charms\n\nListening after acquiring Kingsoul Ahh! So it bears our once-fractured soul, now complete. Such strength, such resolve, such dedication! Is it more than simply a Vessel? I almost feel like I'm once again in the presence of my beloved Wyrm.\n\nThe Kingsoul... What is at the heart of it I wonder? If its curiosity wills it, it should seek out that place. That place where it was born, where it died, where it began...\n\nListening after acquiring Void Heart That pulsing emptiness... Truly, it has been transformed by the revelations it found.\n\nDoes it... feel anything? Triumph? Or hate? If it does, I cannot sense it.\n\nThe fate of our Kingdom, our Hallownest... that future belongs to you now.\n\nListening while wearing Defender's Crest ...That scent. Does another travel with you? Is that you Ogrim, my mighty Knight?\n\nI cannot see you, but then time has clouded my eyes and I cannot see much. Even your booming voice falls silent upon me.\n\nOnly this small one I register, if maybe because it shares some piece of myself. This one stands clear upon a misted world.\n\nAh.... But my my, that potent smell does recall such joyous memory. Only a short moment we had together, compared to ruin now endured, but what shining times they were.\n\nI am grateful you would visit, even if to see me in somewhat faded form.\n\nListening again wearing Defender's Crest Dear Ogrim, I'm sure you saw Dryya on the way in? She's stood guard over me for so long.\n\nDespite her hard front, she's always been a caring type. I'm sure she'll much enjoy a Knights' reunion.\n\nThe Grimm Troupe\n\nListening while wearing Grimmchild or Carefree Melody Ahh, that creature beside. It would be naive to claim it friend, though you two share a... similarity? It is a distant link, one words would strain to convey.\n\nFor it to cling to you now... You've been consumed in the Ritual of that scarlet clan.\n\nIn what poor moment they descend upon our ruin. Aid their propagation, if you so choose, but do not renege on the larger task this kingdom implores.\n\nListening while wearing Grimmchild in its final phase Your companion's eyes burn with a familiar flame... Success then for the scarlet heart, and irony, to use my spawn to grow its own.\n\nI know you creature, and the form time shall bring. You may be all and one, clan and master, but this land shall never bear so foreign a king.\n\nDelicate Flower\n\nAfter giving Delicate Flower Ah, what precious gift it offers, though alas I shan't accept.\n\nNot of me that flower, nor of this kingdom. Far it travelled to reach this place, brought by one beloved, fair knight of lands serene.\n\nThere is rare power hidden in those frail petals.\n\nTo hold it so close, one must surely be unaware of its nature...\n\nLocation\n\nThe White Lady can be found in the northwest part of the Queen's Gardens. This requires defeating the Traitor Lord first.\n\nHornet is the mysterious princess-protector of Hallownest’s ruins, a major character in Hollow Knight and the playable protagonist of Hollow Knight: Silksong. She wields a Needle and thread with deadly prowess.\n\nHornet is captured by outsider bugs and brought to their kingdom, Pharloom, but she escapes her cage before arriving at their destination. She then must battle foes and solve mysteries to ascend on a deadly pilgrimage to this kingdom's peak.\n\nHealth is represented as Masks, shown in the upper-left corner of the screen. Hornet starts the game with 5 Masks and can obtain more. Health is lost by taking damage, either from enemies or from environmental hazards. Health can be regained by the use of the Bind ability consuming a full Silk spool.\n\nLifeblood Masks, granted by Lifeblood needles, are temporary masks.\n\nSilk is represented as a spool below the health indicator. Thread is consumed when using special abilities, including a form of Focus named Bind. Striking enemies with the Needle fills the spool by two laces. When the spool is full, the symbol representing the side of the spool left to the health indicator is filled.\n\nThe Needle is Hornet's main weapon. Not only can she use it to slash or block attacks against enemies, but also to dash forward, stab, and bounce up above them. She can also use it alongside her abilities to deal greater damage or as a grappling hook.\n\nTools are special items classed by categories, equipped on a Crest with limited slots. They can be used as throwing weapons or defensive aids without costing Silk. Crests and Tools can be changed when sitting on a Bench similar to Charms.\n\nAbilities consume Silk thread to use them.\n\nHornet can collect and keep various items throughout her journey, which are stored in her inventory. They can be related to specific quests.\n\nThe following areas have no confirmed name, although the names used were mentioned in the official announcement. Other mentioned names include \"Bonebottom\", \"Moss Temple\", and \"Soaring Warlord's Tower\": \"Coral Forest\", \"Gilded City\", and \"Lake of Fire/Bone Forest\".\n\nGarmond and Zaza are two NPCs first revealed in the Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement trailer. They are on a quest to find a new home. Garmond appears to be the rider, while Zaza appears to be mount.\n\nGarmond and Zaza only appear once in the announcement trailer; they are seen during the \"New Quests\" segment. Within a dark, murky hallway with a visible curved lattice pattern in the background, Hornet is shown leaping over the two as they charge forward through a small group of enemies, while Garmond makes a loud vocalization.\n\nThey were later revealed in a blog post, which states that the two are on a quest to find a new home. Garmond is described as being rambunctious and chatty, while Zaza is noted to possibly be \"the brains\" of the two.\n\nElder Hu was a travelling sage who sought to purify the borderlands of Hallownest from the Infection. He reached the Mantis Village, but his own Infected mind made him see the Mantis Lords and the Tribe as afflicted by the plague. The Mantises killed him after he attacked them. A memorial was erected in his name above the gates to the City of Tears, his tunic and bead necklace resting on top of it.\n\nThe spirit of Elder Hu can be fought at his memorial after acquiring the Dream Nail. Still deluded in his experience with the Mantis Tribe, he warns the Knight. After his defeat, the spirit becomes aware of his madness-driven mistake. He realizes his own death before shattering into 100 Essence to be collected by the Dream Nail.\n\nElder Hu has two attacks in addition to being able to teleport:\n\nRing Slam: Elder Hu summons a row of rings in midair, interspersed with several safe gaps, before quickly slamming them all down onto the ground simultaneously.\n\nRing Curtain: Elder Hu summons pairs of rings that slam down on the ground, beginning from the edges of the arena and moving towards the centre.\n\nTeleport: Elder Hu warps from one area to another to avoid attacks or set up his own.\n\nThe ring attacks require very precise movements to dodge as they come out quickly. The Shade Cloak is highly recommended, although not completely necessary. Elder Hu remains in place during the attacks, and his floating pattern is low enough to the ground, where attacking with the Nail is possible. Dodge the rings and get in some hits in between. Eventually, the rhythm of the attacks is easy to follow and the Knight should have no problem timing dashes and attacks.\n\nAlternatively, the Knight can use Shade Cloak to dodge the Ring Slam attack and use Howling Wraiths/Abyss Shriek along with a Spell build (such as Shaman Stone, Spell Twister, Soul Catcher, and Soul Eater) to quickly finish him off.\n\nHornet is the mysterious princess-protector of Hallownest’s ruins, a major character in Hollow Knight and the playable protagonist of Hollow Knight: Silksong.

He realizes his own death before shattering into 100 Essence to be collected by the Dream Nail.\n\nElder Hu has two attacks in addition to being able to teleport:\n\nRing Slam: Elder Hu summons a row of rings in midair, interspersed with several safe gaps, before quickly slamming them all down onto the ground simultaneously.\n\nRing Curtain: Elder Hu summons pairs of rings that slam down on the ground, beginning from the edges of the arena and moving towards the centre.\n\nTeleport: Elder Hu warps from one area to another to avoid attacks or set up his own.\n\nThe ring attacks require very precise movements to dodge as they come out quickly. The Shade Cloak is highly recommended, although not completely necessary. Elder Hu remains in place during the attacks, and his floating pattern is low enough to the ground, where attacking with the Nail is possible. Dodge the rings and get in some hits in between. Eventually, the rhythm of the attacks is easy to follow and the Knight should have no problem timing dashes and attacks.\n\nAlternatively, the Knight can use Shade Cloak to dodge the Ring Slam attack and use Howling Wraiths/Abyss Shriek along with a Spell build (such as Shaman Stone, Spell Twister, Soul Catcher, and Soul Eater) to quickly finish him off.\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nFor the White Lady's dialogue where she talks about Hornet, the game still checks whether the King's Brand has been acquired before this dialogue is triggered, even though it is not possible to reach the White Lady without it.\n\nThe White Lady is one of the few NPCs who is able to detect when they are being Dream Nailed. However, instead of reacting negatively, she responds with what seems to be hope.\n\nWhen using any Spell on the White Lady, a Seal appears over her.\n\nIn an early version of the game, the Gruz Mother fight area contained three statues: one showing the Pale King, the second showing the White Lady, and the third, a broken one, potentially representing the Hollow Knight. These statues can also be seen in the top left corner of one of the early maps.\n\nA sketch of the White Lady's cocoon depicts it with her head on the front. The in-game cocoon still has this same design including her roots, except the White Lady's face was replaced by the entrance.[2]\n\nHornet is the mysterious princess-protector of Hallownest’s ruins, a major character in Hollow Knight and the playable protagonist of Hollow Knight: Silksong. She wields a Needle and thread with deadly prowess.\n\nHornet is captured by outsider bugs and brought to their kingdom, Pharloom, but she escapes her cage before arriving at their destination. She then must battle foes and solve mysteries to ascend on a deadly pilgrimage to this kingdom's peak.\n\nHealth is represented as Masks, shown in the upper-left corner of the screen. Hornet starts the game with 5 Masks and can obtain more. Health is lost by taking damage, either from enemies or from environmental hazards. Health can be regained by the use of the Bind ability consuming a full Silk spool.\n\nLifeblood Masks, granted by Lifeblood needles, are temporary masks.\n\nSilk is represented as a spool below the health indicator. Thread is consumed when using special abilities, including a form of Focus named Bind. Striking enemies with the Needle fills the spool by two laces. When the spool is full, the symbol representing the side of the spool left to the health indicator is filled.\n\nThe Needle is Hornet's main weapon. Not only can she use it to slash or block attacks against enemies, but also to dash forward, stab, and bounce up above them. She can also use it alongside her abilities to deal greater damage or as a grappling hook.\n\nTools are special items classed by categories, equipped on a Crest with limited slots. They can be used as throwing weapons or defensive aids without costing Silk. Crests and Tools can be changed when sitting on a Bench similar to Charms.\n\nAbilities consume Silk thread to use them.\n\nHornet can collect and keep various items throughout her journey, which are stored in her inventory. They can be related to specific quests.\n\nThe following areas have no confirmed name, although the names used were mentioned in the official announcement. Other mentioned names include \"Bonebottom\", \"Moss Temple\", and \"Soaring Warlord's Tower\": \"Coral Forest\", \"Gilded City\", and \"Lake of Fire/Bone Forest\".\n\nGarmond and Zaza are two NPCs first revealed in the Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement trailer. They are on a quest to find a new home. Garmond appears to be the rider, while Zaza appears to be mount.\n\nGarmond and Zaza only appear once in the announcement trailer; they are seen during the \"New Quests\" segment. Within a dark, murky hallway with a visible curved lattice pattern in the background, Hornet is shown leaping over the two as they charge forward through a small group of enemies, while Garmond makes a loud vocalization.\n\nThey were later revealed in a blog post, which states that the two are on a quest to find a new home. Garmond is described as being rambunctious and chatty, while Zaza is noted to possibly be \"the brains\" of the two.\n\nElder Hu was a travelling sage who sought to purify the borderlands of Hallownest from the Infection. He reached the Mantis Village, but his own Infected mind made him see the Mantis Lords and the Tribe as afflicted by the plague. The Mantises killed him after he attacked them. A memorial was erected in his name above the gates to the City of Tears, his tunic and bead necklace resting on top of it.\n\nThe spirit of Elder Hu can be fought at his memorial after acquiring the Dream Nail.
