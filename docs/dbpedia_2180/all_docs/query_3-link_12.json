        "text": "BigQuery is a fully managed, AI-ready data platform that helps you manage and analyze your data with built-in features like machine learning, search, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence. BigQuery's serverless architecture lets you use languages like SQL and Python to answer your organization's biggest questions with zero infrastructure management.\n\nBigQuery provides a uniform way to work with both structured and unstructured data and supports open table formats like Apache Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi. BigQuery streaming supports continuous data ingestion and analysis while BigQuery's scalable, distributed analysis engine lets you query terabytes in seconds and petabytes in minutes.\n\nBigQuery's architecture consists of two parts: a storage layer that ingests, stores, and optimizes data and a compute layer that provides analytics capabilities. These compute and storage layers efficiently operate independently of each other thanks to Google's petabit-scale network that enables the necessary communication between them.\n\nLegacy databases usually have to share resources between read and write operations and analytical operations. This can result in resource conflicts and can slow queries while data is written to or read from storage. Shared resource pools can become further strained when resources are required for database management tasks such as assigning or revoking permissions. BigQuery's separation of compute and storage layers lets each layer dynamically allocate resources without impacting the performance or availability of the other.\n\nThis separation principle lets BigQuery innovate faster because storage and compute improvements can be deployed independently, without downtime or negative impact on system performance. It is also essential to offering a fully managed serverless data warehouse in which the BigQuery engineering team handles updates and maintenance. The result is that you don't need to provision or manually scale resources, leaving you free to focus on delivering value instead of traditional database management tasks.\n\nBigQuery interfaces include Google Cloud console interface and the BigQuery command-line tool. Developers and data scientists can use client libraries with familiar programming including Python, Java, JavaScript, and Go, as well as BigQuery's REST API and RPC API to transform and manage data. ODBC and JDBC drivers provide interaction with existing applications including third-party tools and utilities.\n\nAs a data analyst, data engineer, data warehouse administrator, or data scientist, BigQuery helps you load, process, and analyze data to inform critical business decisions.\n\nGet started with BigQuery\n\nYou can start exploring BigQuery in minutes. Take advantage of BigQuery's free usage tier or no-cost sandbox to start loading and querying data.\n\nBigQuery's sandbox: Get started in the BigQuery sandbox, risk-free and at no cost.\n\nGoogle Cloud console quickstart: Familiarize yourself with the power of the BigQuery Console.\n\nPublic datasets: Experience BigQuery's performance by exploring large, real-world data from the Public Datasets Program.\n\nExplore BigQuery\n\nBigQuery's serverless infrastructure lets you focus on your data instead of resource management. BigQuery combines a cloud-based data warehouse and powerful analytic tools.\n\nBigQuery storage\n\nBigQuery stores data using a columnar storage format that is optimized for analytical queries. BigQuery presents data in tables, rows, and columns and provides full support for database transaction semantics (ACID). BigQuery storage is automatically replicated across multiple locations to provide high availability.\n\nLearn about common patterns to organize BigQuery resources in the data warehouse and data marts.\n\nLearn about datasets, BigQuery's top-level container of tables and views.\n\nLoad data into BigQuery using:\n\nStream data with the Storage Write API.\n\nBatch-load data from local files or Cloud Storage using formats that include: Avro, Parquet, ORC, CSV, JSON, Datastore, and Firestore formats.\n\nBigQuery Data Transfer Service automates data ingestion.\n\nFor more information, see Overview of BigQuery storage.\n\nBigQuery analytics\n\nDescriptive and prescriptive analysis uses include business intelligence, ad hoc analysis, geospatial analytics, and machine learning. You can query data stored in BigQuery or run queries on data where it lives using external tables or federated queries including Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Spanner, or Google Sheets stored in Google Drive.\n\nANSI-standard SQL queries (SQL:2011 support) including support for joins, nested and repeated fields, analytic and aggregation functions, multi-statement queries, and a variety of spatial functions with geospatial analytics - Geographic Information Systems.\n\nCreate views to share your analysis.\n\nBusiness intelligence tool support including BI Engine with Looker Studio, Looker, Google Sheets, and 3rd party tools like Tableau and Power BI.\n\nBigQuery ML provides machine learning and predictive analytics.\n\nBigQuery Studio offers features such as Python notebooks, and version control for both notebooks and saved queries. These features make it easier for you to complete your data analysis and machine learning (ML) workflows in BigQuery.\n\nQuery data outside of BigQuery with external tables and federated queries.\n\nFor more information, see Overview of BigQuery analytics.\n\nBigQuery administration\n\nBigQuery provides centralized management of data and compute resources while Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you secure those resources with the access model that's used throughout Google Cloud. Google Cloud security best practices provide a solid yet flexible approach that can include traditional perimeter security or more complex and granular defense-in-depth approach.\n\nIntro to data security and governance helps you understand data governance, and what controls you might need to secure BigQuery resources.\n\nJobs are actions that BigQuery runs on your behalf to load, export, query, or copy data.\n\nReservations let you switch between on-demand pricing and capacity-based pricing.\n\nFor more information, see Introduction to BigQuery administration.\n\nBigQuery resources\n\nExplore BigQuery resources:\n\nRelease notes provide change logs of features, changes, and deprecations.\n\nPricing for analysis and storage. See also: BigQuery ML, BI Engine, and Data Transfer Service pricing.\n\nLocations define where you create and store datasets (regional and multi-region locations).\n\nStack Overflow hosts an engaged community of developers and analysts working with BigQuery.\n\nBigQuery Support provides help with BigQuery.\n\nGoogle BigQuery: The Definitive Guide: Data Warehousing, Analytics, and Machine Learning at Scale by Valliappa Lakshmanan and Jordan Tigani, explains how BigQuery works and provides an end-to-end walkthrough on how to use the service.\n\nReference materials for BigQuery developers and analysts:\n\nSQL query syntax for details about using GoogleSQL.\n\nBigQuery API and client libraries present overviews of BigQuery's features and their use.\n\nBigQuery code samples provide hundreds of snippets for client libraries in C#, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby.
