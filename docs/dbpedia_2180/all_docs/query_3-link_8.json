More specifically, I really just need the data located within this title attributes:\n\n</td>, <td><a href=\"/wiki/West_Coast_jazz\" title=\"West Coast jazz\">West Coast jazz</a>\n\nI have been wracking my brain on how to extract this information. I have looked at other posts on here but can't quite get there. Thank you."
