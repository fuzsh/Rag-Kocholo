The feature has been built such that transactions can be used by any storage format that can determine how updates or deletes apply to base records (basically, that has an explicit or implicit row id), but so far the integration work has only been done for ORC.\n\nORC doesnt have anything special except columnar storage, zipped file format - which makes it fast over text files. Theoretically doable.\n\nThis feature came in 2014 for version 0.13. After that, they have improved the functionality but not for other file formats. Which means, there may not be enough demand or complex for other file format or they have to rewrite everything for other file formats."
