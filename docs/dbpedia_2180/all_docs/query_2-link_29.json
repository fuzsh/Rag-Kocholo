        "text": "Lenti í því sama þegar ég tók þennan áfanga... En þetta á ég frá kennaranum:\n\nSetting\n\nBassindale, England\n\nPlot\n\nAcid Row is the nickname for a housing project, known as Bassindale Estates, in a small suburb of London. The population consists mostly of single mothers with small children; elderly pensioners, alone, afraid, and waiting to die; and the drug dealers who have made this conclave a very dangerous place.\n\nThe novel tells two different stories that are loosely connected. On one hand there is the story of a riot on the estate, which breaks out when people find out that there is a paedophile living there. The main characters here are Sophie, a young doctor taken as a hostage by the father of the paedophile; Melanie, a feisty young woman trying desperately to keep her small family together; and Jimmy, a brave young man who transcends his criminal background to become a hero. On the other hand, there is the story of a missing 10-year-old girl, Amy Biddulph and her rather mixed-up family. The missing girl is at some point believed to be held hostage in the paeodophile’s house.\n\nCharacters\n\nPeople on the estate\n\nJimmy James, Melanie’s boyfriend, father to her unborn child\n\nMelanie Patterson (19), pregnant w. 3rd child\n\nGaynor Patterson, Melanie’s mother\n\nColin Patterson (14), Melanie’s brother\n\nRosie (4) and Ben (2) Patterson, Melanie’s children\n\nWesley Barber, Colin’s mate, drug addict\n\nKevin Charteris, Colin’s mate\n\nNicholas Hollis (Milosz Zelowski), paedophile\n\nFranek, father of Nicholas, keeps Sophie captured\n\nEileen Hinkley, old lady who helps Jimmy\n\nMrs Carthew, owns a house they let people through\n\nLisa Shaw (14), helps Gaynor get people away from the street\n\nClara Frensham, opens her house to help Jimmy and Sophie\n\nPeople at the Health Centre\n\nSophie Morrison, doctor\n\nJenny Monroe, receptionist\n\nHarry Bonfield, senior doctor\n\nFay Baldwin, health visitor\n\nAmy’s ‘family’\n\nLaura Biddulph\n\nAmy Rogerson/Biddulph (10), Laura’s daughter\n\nMartin Rogerson, Amy’s father, Laura’s ex-husband\n\nEdward/Eddy Townsend, Laura’s ex-boyfriend\n\nFranny Gough (18), Eddy’s girlfriend on holiday in Majorca\n\nMrs Gough, Franny’s mother\n\nGregory Logan, lives with Laura\n\nKimberley (15) and Barry (13), Gregory’s children\n\nPolice\n\nDCI Tyler, inspector in charge of Amy investigation\n\nDS Gary Butler, working on Amy case\n\nWPC Hanson, policewoman who is injured on the estate\n\nPC Ken Hewitt, working on estate riot\n\nOthers\n\nBob Scudamore, Sophie’s fiancé\n\nMelanie Patterson\n\nFacts\n\nAt the time the book happens Melanie is 19 years old and pregnant. She already had two children, the first one she had when she was 14 years old and the second one when she was 16, and she only had a vague idea of who the fathers were. Jimmy James was the father of her unborn child, and he was a troublemaker, just got out of prison for robbery among other things.\n\nShe was alike her mother, they both smoked and drunk often, even though the kids saw them. She had a brother named Colin who was 14, and other younger brothers and sisters (who were not specially mentioned). Fay Baldwin, who worked at the Health clinic and was the one who blabbed to Melanie about the peadophile, did not think a lot of Melanie and thought she was unfit as a mother and believed she sold herself. But it is not likely that she did even though she slept around.\n\nShe was a small blonde, and was careless about her looks, she did not try to cover her pregnant belly.\n\nCharacter\n\nShe was rather careless person, and the fact she did not know who the fathers of her children were is a good point. Although she was careless she could get feisty when she needed too.\n\nWhat she did\n\nFay Baldwin told Melanie and her mother, Gaynor, that a peadophile was living next to them (accidentally missed it out because she was so angry Melanie did let her kids run around and play like they wanted), and that they could possibly take Rosie. For that reasons Melanie and her mother organized a protest march to attract the government’s attention to the poor situations in their neighborhood (the neighborhood was full of children and women). So they spread the word about the molesters.\n\nWhen the protest day arrived, she took the children outside with her, but when she realized that the protest would get out of control, she took them back inside.\n\nVona að þetta hjálpi þér eitthvað oggupogg ;)"
