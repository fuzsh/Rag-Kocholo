        "text": "The bent-over row is a compound exercise that primarily works out the Latissimus Dorsi, Rhomboids, Spinal Erectors, and Trapezius muscles. Depending on the grip, some indirect muscles that will be exercised are the biceps, forearms, hamstrings, glutes, and rear deltoids.\n\nThis exercise also stabilizes the shoulders and midline, which prevents training injuries. Furthermore, by building more lean muscle in your upper body, you increase your metabolic rate. Increased metabolism means you’ll burn more calories throughout the day, which will help you lose fat.\n\nTo ensure you are using the correct form when performing this compound lift, you should focus on pulling your elbows behind your back to activate your lats. Also, pause at the top of each rep and squeeze your shoulder blades together to ensure correct posture, and maintain your grip strength.\n\nThe six main types of bent-over row techniques are as follows.\n\nThe Pendlay Row\n\nThe Yates Row\n\nThe Dumbell Row\n\nThe Barbell Corner Row (T-Bar Row)\n\nThe Helms Row\n\nThe Barbell Dead Row\n\nThe most common mistakes people run into when performing bent-over rows have to do with posture and technique. Some people do not keep their knees at the proper 15 to 20-degree angle, while others don’t keep their lower back straight. Meanwhile, some people stand up when they pull up the bar instead of keeping bent.\n\nFurthermore, although bent-over rows are a common exercise, many people complain of lower back pain when they do them. If you feel a lot of pain in your back when doing bent-over rows, it means you are not performing them correctly, or you’re using too much weight. You should keep the proper form to prevent this type of injury.\n\nHow to Perform Bent-Over Row With Proper Form?\n\nProper form is how you prevent injuries from occurring. Your form is how you position your body when you do an exercise. When researching exercises, you will see the proper form explained in steps.\n\nThe steps to correctly perform the bent-over row are as follows.\n\nBend over and grab your barbell with an overhand grip. An overhand grip means that your palms are holding the barbell from the top instead of the bottom. A barbell is a type of weight with a long metal pole connecting two circular weights. You should place your hands slightly farther apart than your shoulders.\n\nBend your legs slightly and keep your back straight while bending your upper body until it’s almost perpendicular to the floor.\n\nPull the barbell directly up towards the lower part of your chest.\n\nPause for a moment\n\nLower the barbell while keeping your back in the same position.\n\nTo perform barbell bent-over rows without injuring your back, you need to push your hips back instead of leaning over when bending in step two. This form will make sure your back stays in a neutral position.\n\nAlso, make sure you bring the barbell straight up towards your lower chest instead of pushing outwards. Pushing outwards will mean you are primarily exercising your shoulders instead of your lats. The Barbell Bent-over Row is an effective exercise and one of the best back workouts to include in a routine.\n\nWhat are the Stages of Conventional Bent-Over Row?\n\nYou need to understand the stages of the conventional bent-over row to make sure you are using the proper form and technique. Foregoing correct form and technique can cause injury or cause you to work the wrong muscles.\n\nThe bent-over row is a weight training exercise that bodybuilders and powerlifters often use to increase strength and size. It is mainly achieved by bending over while lifting weights on each side of the body. Here are the steps to follow.\n\nSlightly Bend in Your Knees\n\nLean Forward at Your Hips\n\nBrace Your Core by Tightening the Muscles\n\nKeep Your Elbows and Arms Close to the Ribs\n\nLower the Weight and Repeat\n\nThe necessary stages may vary depending on the type of bent-over row you are doing, such as Pendlay rows, but these stages will help in most situations.\n\n1. Slightly Bend in Your Knees\n\nWhen performing bent-over rows, you should bend your knees to about a 15-20 degree angle. If you bend your knees too much, you will find it challenging to maintain your body position, meaning you won’t be able to do as many reps, your chances of hurting yourself increases, and you won’t be working the right muscles.\n\nConversely, if you don’t bend far enough, you are at a greater chance of hurting your lower back, and you won’t be able to hold as much weight.\n\n2. Lean Forward at Your Hips\n\nFor bent over rows, you should think of bending at your hips instead of leaning forward to ensure your spine stays in a neutral position. If your back is curved, you are putting too much pressure on your spine, which can throw your weight off and cause an injury.\n\n3. Brace Your Core by Tightening the Muscles\n\nBracing your core is a common step in many exercises to prevent damage to the nervous system.\n\nTo brace your core, you should tighten the muscles around your spine so that your midsection is rigid. Doing so prevents movements that can cause injury during bent over row.\n\n4. Keep Your Elbows and Upper Arms Close to your Ribs\n\nKeeping your elbows and upper arms close to your ribs will ensure that you are performing rows instead of curls.\n\nIn a bent-over row, you want the exercise to focus on your lats, not your biceps. So, if you start to feel a lot of strain in your biceps, you should focus on keeping the arms close to your body.\n\nYou should make sure you move up and down, not forward, and without bending your wrists. These steps ensure that you are performing the correct exercise.\n\n5. Lower the Weight and Repeat\n\nYou have to repeat repetitions when you lift weights with barbell bent-over rows because for you to build muscle, you need to create slight damage to your muscles. When you lift weights, you slightly damage the muscle, and as the cells go to repair the muscle fibers, they add more, making the muscles stronger.\n\nNote: Too much damage to the muscle, like an injury, can permanently damage the muscle. Use caution when strength training.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes people make when they do strength training is using too much weight at once. Too much weight can cause too much muscle strain, which can damage muscles.\n\nWhat are the Mistakes for Bent-Over Row Form?\n\nSome of the most common that cause people to fail at good bent-over row mistakes form are the following.\n\nNot keeping the back straight\n\nPushing the arms out forwards instead of up and down near the ribs\n\nFailure to brace the core muscles around the spine\n\nSquatting too much\n\nLocking the knees\n\nStanding up when you pull the barbell up instead of staying bent.\n\nFailing to pause when you lift the barbell\n\nTo perform with conventional bent-over row form, you need to ensure that your posture is as near perfect as possible.\n\nHow to Determine Proper Weight for Bent-Over Row?\n\nOverall, the amount of weight you’ll need to perform the bent-over row depends on your body, the number of reps you are doing, and your goals. For the most part, you want to choose a challenging weight, but not so difficult that you can’t finish your reps or you end up breaking form.\n\nIf you’re into CrossFit, you want to think about what exercises you are doing before you perform the bent-over row. You will not be able to lift as much if you have already done several strength exercises. Yet, you still want to try to choose a challenging weight so that you don’t just breeze right through your workout.\n\nBodybuilders will want to think about their goals when choosing weights for the bent-over row. If your primary goal is to get as strong as possible, you want a heavier weight and fewer reps. If you want to get big, choose a slightly lighter weight and a medium range of reps.\n\nIf your primary goal is to get lean, then choose weights that make the last two to three reps challenging but not impossible without breaking form. This method builds muscles which, in turn, burns fat.\n\nTo determine how many reps you should do, you should think of your goals and the amount of weight you are lifting. If your primary goal is strength, one to six reps at a high weight range are ideal. If you want big muscles, then think about eight to 12 reps as a medium weight range. Finally, for muscle endurance, go for 15 reps at a lower weight range.\n\nJust remember that the amount of weight and the number of reps you’ll do go hand-in-hand. If you can’t finish your reps without breaking form or overstraining, choose a lower weight. On the other hand, if you breeze through your reps, then try a higher weight.\n\nWhat is the Importance of Grip for Bent-Over Row?\n\nGrip strength or hold the barbell when performing the bent-over row is crucial because it changes which muscles you use.\n\nIf you go for the overhand (palms on top of barbell facing downwards) method, then your elbows will naturally bow out a little more. This technique works your upper back, rhomboids, and traps.\n\nThe underhanded (palms on bottom of barbell facing upwards) strategy primarily works the lats.\n\nWhich Muscles are Involved While Performing Bent-Over Row?\n\nBent-over rows work the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, rhomboids, and biceps.\n\nLatissimus dorsi: The latissimus dorsi (also called lats) is a big, flat muscle covering the middle and lower back. This muscle connects the upper arm bone to the spine and hip. The lats are one of the main muscles that you’ll strengthen when performing bent-over rows.\n\nTrapezius: The trapezius muscles (also called traps) are a group of three muscles that run from the base of your skull to about the middle of your spine. Bent-over rows work the middle and lower traps because you are retracting and depressing your shoulder blades.\n\nRhomboids: The rhomboids are two muscles in the upper back and neck that connect the spine to the shoulder blades. Bent-over rows primarily work the rhomboid majors in the upper back when you pull up on the barbell.\n\nBiceps: The biceps are at the front of your upper arm and attach to your shoulder and your elbow. Bent-over rows work your biceps because you are using these muscles when you lift the barbell. However, the biceps aren’t one of the primary muscles you work when you perform this exercise. If you feel a lot of burn in your biceps, pull your arms closer to your ribs and make sure you’re lifting up and down.\n\nWhat are the Bent-Over Row Form Tips?\n\nTo master the bent-over row, you need to focus on your technique and form. Follow these seven steps for success.\n\nWait at the Top\n\nRealize the Level of Your Elbows\n\nKeep Squeezing the Muscle\n\nFeel the Anterior Deltoids\n\nKeep the Bent-Over Row Straight\n\nIgnore Your Ego\n\nWork on the Grip\n\n1. Wait at the Top\n\nWhen performing bent rows, you should pause at the top of each rep. Taking a moment to pause ensures that you are working your lats.\n\nAlso, waiting ensures that you are using the correct weights. If you cannot pause at the top of each rep, then your weights are too heavy.\n\nWhen pausing at the top of the rep, you should have the barbell pulled up enough so that it’s touching your sternum. You should also squeeze your shoulder blades together to ensure you work out all of your back muscles.\n\n2. Realize the Level of Elbows\n\nKeeping your elbows in the proper position is critical to ensure that you are performing a bent-over row and not curls or any other exercise.\n\nWhen you pull up on the bar, you should keep your elbows tucked near your ribs and raise them straight upwards behind your back. This technique ensures you are working your lats.\n\nYou should follow the same rules if you are doing the Yates Row, which is a bent-over row with an underhanded grip. Keeping your elbows tucked is an even more important step to remember in the Yates Row because the elbows will want to bend outwards more when using an underhand grip.\n\n3. Keep Squeezing the Muscle\n\nWhen performing barbell bent-over rows or any other strength exercise, you should squeeze the muscles you are working out to ensure you are getting the most out of your training. Your muscle fibers need tension to grow, so squeezing the muscles helps them to grow stronger.\n\nYou should focus on squeezing the shoulder blades in barbell bent-over rows because these are the muscles you want to work.\n\n4. Feel the Anterior Deltoids\n\nYour anterior deltoids are the muscles at the front of your shoulder.\n\nWhen performing bent-over rows, make sure that you stretch the front of your shoulders outwards while you squeeze your shoulder blades together. Ensuring that you stretch your anterior deltoids ensures that you are squeezing your shoulder blades as you should.\n\n5. Keep Bent-Over Row Straight\n\nOne of the most dangerous things you can do when doing barbell bent-over rows is rounding your back. Not keeping the back straight puts your spine in a position to get hurt.\n\nFocus on keeping your back in a neutral position. Flexing your core muscles can help you keep your back straight.\n\n6. Ignore Your Ego\n\nLearning to handle your ego is one of the most important things you need to learn before heading to the gym. Letting your pride get in the way can cause you to lift too much weight and sacrifice form, leading to serious injury.\n\n7. Work on the Grip\n\nThe way that you grip the barbell when performing bent-over rows determines the muscles you are working out. A supinated grip (underhand) works your lats and lower back, while an overhand grip focuses more on the upper back.\n\nAlso, the width in which you grip the bar will change the muscles that you work. A wide grip works the traps and rear deltoids, while a narrow grip primarily focuses on the lats.\n\nYou will also improve your grip strength when performing bent-over rows because you are working your biceps.\n\nWhat are the Bent-Over Row Challenges?\n\nBent-over row challenges are ways that an athlete can test their strength and proficiency at the exercise.\n\nThese challenges allow you to see how much progress you have made on your strength training journey.\n\nBent-Over Row and EMOM\n\nBent-Over Row and GVT\n\nTest the 1RM with Bent-Over Row\n\n1. Bent-Over Row and EMOM\n\nEMOM stands for Every Minute On the Minute. You need to finish a particular amount of reps in a minute and then use the rest of that minute to rest.\n\nFor example, you may complete ten bent-over rows in a minute coupled with other workouts where you also complete ten reps in a minute.\n\nEMOM exercise routines help you to build your stamina and track progress. For instance, you may start with ten reps in a minute and then work your way up to fifteen.\n\n2. Bent-Over Row and GVT\n\nGVT stands for German Volume Training. The method comes from German National Weight Lifting Coach Rolf Feser, who invented the procedure in the 1970s. GVT focuses on a ten-set approach which leads to you working out the same muscle over and over.\n\nIf you are doing the bent-over row in the GVT style, you will perform ten sets of the exercise.\n\nGVT is a bodybuilding technique that helps people gain a lot of muscle fast.\n\n3. Test the 1RM with Bent-Over Row\n\n1RM stands for 1 Rep Maximum. Under this method, the athlete uses as much weight as possible to do one rep while maintaining the correct form.\n\nUsing the 1RM method with the bent-over row helps you to see the maximum amount of weight you can lift at once while performing the exercise. You can also try 1RM with a bent over row machine.\n\n1RM not only helps to increase muscle but also lets you see the progress you have made. As you exercise more, you will be able to lift more weight on one rep.\n\nWhat are the Bent-Over Row Variations?\n\nThe bent-over row has a couple of variations, but each bent-over row ultimately works out the same muscle groups. The main variations of Bent-Over Row that you’ll find have to do with how you grip your weights and the type of weights used. These factors will determine whether you are performing the barbell, kettlebell, or hammer bent over row.\n\nOverhand Grip Barbell Bent-Over Rows\n\nUnderhand Grip Barbell Bent-Over Rows\n\nPendlay Rows\n\nBent-Over Dumbbell\n\nKettlebell Rows\n\n1. Overhand Grip Barbell Bent-Over Rows\n\nThe overhand grip barbell bent-over back row is one of the most common ways to perform the bent-over row. You will complete this exercise with your hands in the overhand position on top of the barbell.\n\nTo complete this exercise properly, keep your feet shoulder-width apart and grip the barbell overhand with your hands slightly farther apart than your shoulders. Bend your knees slightly, and lean your torso forward while keeping your back straight. Pull the barbell straight up to your lower chest and retract your shoulder blades. Hold for a moment, lower the barbell, and repeat.\n\nWhen performing the overhand bent-over back row, the most common mistakes are forgetting to bend the knees, keeping too much tension in the neck and spine when lifting, and failing to contract the core.\n\nFor this variation, you will only need a barbell.\n\nThe overhand bent-over back row primarily targets the upper back muscles such as the mid and upper traps and rhomboids. These targeted muscles are in contrast to the middle back range that the underhand bent-over row targets.\n\n2. Underhand Grip Barbell Bent-Over Rows\n\nThe underhand grip bent-over row is similar to the overhand version of this exercise. In this version, you will lift the barbell underhand with your hands under the bar.\n\nThe proper form for this position is the same as the overhand row, except your hands will be under the barbell this time. You also need to pay closer attention to keeping your elbows close to your body since they’ll want to bow outwards more when you’re underhanded.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes during the underhand bent-over barbell bent-over row is that athletes have to bounce their bodies to complete the row. When doing rows, your body should be kept stationary except for your arms, which move the barbell.\n\nFor this exercise, you will only require a barbell.\n\nThe underhanded bent-over row will work your arms, back, and shoulders, but it will primarily target your lats as long as you keep proper form.\n\n3. Pendlay Rows\n\nThe Pendlay row is a more challenging variation of the classic bent-over row. Glen Pendlay, a weightlifting coach, created the row because he felt that more bend in the hips and more lifting would create a better outcome.\n\nTo complete this row correctly, you need to start by bending forward until your back is parallel to the ground. Grab the barbell with an overhand grip and hands placed slightly farther apart than your shoulders. Brace your core and lift the barbell to your abdomen while squeezing your shoulder blades together. Lower the bar all the way to the floor and repeat.\n\nOne of the most common mistakes people make when performing the Pendlay row is not bending their hips enough. If your back is not parallel to the floor, then you need to bend more.\n\nOther mistakes common to the Pendlay row are lifting with your arms instead of your back and rounding the back. You should keep your back straight while lifting and lift with your back muscles by squeezing your shoulder blades.\n\nYou will only need a barbell for this exercise, but since Pendlays are more complicated, use a lighter weight than you would for a traditional bent-over row.\n\nWhen performing this exercise, you will primarily work your lats and rhomboids. You also work your glutes, biceps, forearms, abs, legs, traps, and delts to a lesser degree.\n\n4. Bent-Over Dumbbell\n\nIn the bent-over dumbbell row, you will use two dumbbells instead of a barbell, but the mechanics are similar.\n\nTo perform this row, you start with a dumbbell in each hand, standing with your legs shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. You should hold your dumbbells shoulder-width apart with your palms facing each other. Bend to a 45-degree angle and pull the dumbbells straight up towards your chest—lower the weights and repeat.\n\nFor this variation, you should ensure that your upper arms don’t go any higher than parallel with your shoulders when you lift. You should also keep your wrists still, and you should remain bent throughout the exercise.\n\nWith this row, like other row variations, the most common mistake is arching the back. Your back should be straight in a neutral position throughout the exercise to prevent injury. Additionally, you should keep your neck in line with your spine to avoid hyperextension.\n\nSince this technique is a wide dumbbell row, you will need two wide dumbbells.\n\nDuring the dumbbell row, you will work out your lats, erector spinae, traps, rhomboids, and biceps.\n\nThe dumbbell row is similar to the overhand and underhand barbell bent-over rows, but the main difference is usually down to the amount of weight used. Barbells allow a person to lift more weight while dumbbells stop at a certain weight level. Therefore, bodybuilders typically prefer to do bent-over rows.\n\n5. Kettlebell Rows\n\nKettlebell rows are a bent over rowing technique where the athlete uses kettlebells and typically uses one arm at a time.\n\nYou want to start your kettlebell row by placing your right foot forward with your left leg bent, similar to a lunge stance. You should put your weight primarily on the ball of your left leg. You can then rest your right hand or forearm on your right knee for stability.\n\nWhile keeping your back straight, grab the kettlebell with a neutral grip with your left hand. Then, pull the kettlebell straight up towards your stomach. Your elbow should move behind you when you lift. Lower and then repeat.\n\nThe main mistake made when doing kettlebell rows is that people pull their elbow up too high because they feel like the exercise has a limited range. However, your elbow should only come up just to your side. There is no need to go higher.\n\nFor this exercise, you will only need a kettlebell of the appropriate weight for your body and the number of reps you are doing.\n\nThe kettlebell row primarily works out your lats, trapezius, and rhomboids. To a lesser extent, you also work out your core and biceps.\n\nKettlebell rows are practically the same as dumbbell rows. Personal preference will mostly dictate which one you perform.\n\nWhat are the Necessary Equipments for Bent-Over Row?\n\nThe only equipment that you’ll need for a bent-over row is your weights. There are a few different types of weights you can use.\n\nBarbell – a barbell has a long metal pole that attaches two circular weights.\n\nDumbbell – a dumbbell has a short bar in the middle that attaches two weights to its sides.\n\nKettlebell – a kettlebell has a small handle that attaches to a round weight at its bottom.\n\nWhat are the World Records for Bent-Over Rows?\n\nThe amount of weight that a person can lift in a minute or hour is how institutions measure bent-over row world records. They multiply the weight of the barbell or dumbbell by the number of reps performed. A record is broken when someone achieves a higher number than the previous record-holder.\n\nGuinness World Records record most world records, but other weight lifting organizations record records, including the International Weightlifting Federation.\n\nWomen Bent-Over Row Records: Currently, there are no world records listed for women in either Guinness World Records or the International Weightlifting Federation.\n\nOverall, women are in the 95th percentile if they can row a 173 pounds barbell. More than 200 pounds will place a woman in the top percentiles.\n\nMen Bent-Over Row Records: The most weight ever lifted while doing barbell bent-over rows in a minute is 4,700 kg or 10,362 lbs. Irishman Eamonn Keane made this record in 2012 when he performed 47 lifts of a 100kg barbell in a minute.\n\nKeane also holds the record for the most weight lifted doing barbell bent-over rows in an hour. In 2012, he lifted 126,720 kg or 279,369 lbs in an hour. He lifted a 120 kg barbell 1,056 times.\n\nThe most weight lifted doing dumbbell rows in an hour goes to UK resident Sipos Ede Daniel who lifted 35,899 kg or 79,145 lbs in an hour. Using a 16.4 kg dumbbell, he managed 1,095 reps in 2017.\n\nWhat is the Origin of the Bent-Over Row?\n\nThe origin of the bent-over row is not known, but the row has gone through changes over the years.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy was the Pendlay row, invented by Glenn Pendlay, an American weightlifting coach. He began using this technique in the 1970s because he wanted to make his back stronger.\n\nDorian Yates, who won the Mr. Olympia title six times in the 1990s, invented the Yates row. In Yates rows, the athlete bends their back to a 45-degree angle.\n\nWho Named the Bent-Over Row?\n\nUnfortunately, it is unknown who came up with bent-over back rows or who gave it its name. The move has been a staple of bodybuilding for decades, thanks to Pendlay and Yates.\n\nWhich Muscles Can be Affected More from Bent-Over Row?\n\nThe primary muscles affected by the bent over back rows are the following.\n\nLatissimus dorsi\n\nRhomboids\n\nTrapezius\n\nBiceps\n\nFor the most part, the lats are the muscle group that is primarily toned when performing bent-over rows. Since bent-over rows mainly use the muscles in the back like the lats, traps, and rhomboids, these are the muscles that are broken down and rebuilt by this exercise. Thus, the back muscles become stronger through performing back rows.\n\nYour biceps are also worked to some degree when performing this exercise.\n\nWhat are the Back Muscle Exercises with Bent-Over Row?\n\nOverall, if you are looking for a bent-over row for the best back exercises, any bent-over row variations will work your back muscles, no matter the grip or weights used.\n\nBent-over row variations for the back include the following.\n\nOverhand barbell bent over row\n\nUnderhand barbell bent over row\n\nYates Row\n\nDumbbell Row\n\nKettlebell Row\n\nHelm Row\n\nPendlay Row\n\nWhat is the Leg Muscle Exercises with Bent-Over Row?\n\nIf you want a bent-over row that will work out your legs, you should refer to the single leg bent-over row.\n\nTo perform this bent-over row for legs, stand on one leg with a dumbbell in your other hand. Then, lower yourself until your back is parallel with the floor. Ensure you pull your shoulder blades back and that your spine is straight. Next, pull the weight up towards your body by pulling your shoulder blades back. Lower and repeat.\n\nWhat is the Effectiveness of Bent-Over Row for Muscle Growth when Compared to Squat?\n\nA bent-over press allows the muscles to grow because when you exercise your back, your body recruits more motor units to that area, making the nervous system more efficient and eventually increasing muscle size.\n\nMuscle size increases as the strain from the exercise slightly damage your muscles so that they can repair themselves with more muscle fibers. For instance, when performing bent-over rows, you will work your lats.
