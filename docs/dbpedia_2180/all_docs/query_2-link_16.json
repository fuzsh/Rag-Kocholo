        "text": "SWANMAY(müssen leider ABSAGEN!)\n\nSwanmay is a Doom inspired Stoner/Grunge trio from Austria, founded in 2014. With amp-walls, aluminium guitars and an arsenal of fuzz pedals they were able to manifest their distinctive heavy stoner sound and play dozens of shows all over Europe as a support for Kadavar, Truckfighters, Brant Bjork, The Atomic Bitchwax, Elder, Ufommamut and many more.\n\nThe three Fuzzgeeks have now recorded their second full length album and are more than ready to play live again.\n\nhttps://swanmay.bandcamp.com/releases\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Swanmay\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SwanmayStoner/videos\n\nACID ROW\n\nIf Robert Johnson would have reached the days of electric guitars and amps, he might have considered jamming with Czech stoner lunatics from Acid Row. A three-piece from Prague combining different genres and subgenres related mainly to stoner rock with tendencies and attitude of punk, echoes of doom metal, hazed with elements of psychedelic rock, poignant noise rock or 90’s grunge.\n\nhttps://acidrow.bandcamp.com/track/get-life\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/acidroww\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCepCYroUmgnLs89bm18Nq4Q"
