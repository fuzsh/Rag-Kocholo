They were done with the permission of the parents and locked away so the girls wouldn't be embarrassed. All child nudity being pornography is anachronism. There were plenty of child nudes being painted at the time. The camera was an interesting novelty at the time, seen sort of like shitty painting. Lewis Carrol idolized children for their purity and simplicity, and so did many of his contemporaries. This is often called the \"cult of innocence.\" Sexualizing children would be heinous to Carrol, it would foul them. Look to the Alice books, they're about a little girl navigating an absurd, defamiliarized version of adulthood with simple politeness and pleasentness.\n\nReally look into it and don't pay attention to the BBC et al with their sensationalized view of them.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nSomebody said that JD Salinger was because of \"A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\" I never finished reading that though, so can't confirm\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>7259368\n\nI call bullshit.

It all depends of the education that they receive. Out there are lovely kids, with more common sense than lots of adults. Kids that respect you if you treat them with the same respect they deserve. But what do you expect when you expose them 24/7 to political correctness, Disney serials, and the contempt of adults who fear to hurt their underage \"property\"...?\n\nKids aren't stupid, as many people believe. They're just less experienced (they have had less obstacles in their lifes). And despite of this, they have their own criterion.

The trauma from consensual relationships with children comes from the stigma attached to it; children are taught that if they have that experience that it's wrong and they've been used, regardless how they felt about it at the time. It's entirely possible that a child could have a consensual relationship with an adult man, but it would have to be one with mutual affection and trust on the child's part. I wouldn't advocate using a child for sexual gratification. I am only interested in having a romantic-sexual relationship with a little girl. But I realize that is unlikely, and most likely pure fantasy.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>7260434\n\n>Believe me when I say that kids under 10 have sexual interests. It's in our nature.

Of course they understand things like back stabbing. They can do that, they can lie... It's related to what I said before about education. If their parents lie and cheat, that's what they learn.

The evidence suggests that sexual abuse is an important problem with serious long-term sequelae; but the specific effects of sexual abuse, independent of force, threat of force, or such family variables as parental psychopathology, are still to be clarified. Adult women with a history of childhood sexual abuse show greater evidence of sexual disturbance or dysfunction, homosexual experiences in adolescence or adulthood, depression, and are more likely than nonabused women to be revictimized. Anxiety, fear, and suicidal ideas and behavior have also been associated with a history of childhood sexual abuse but force and threat of force may be a necessary concomitant. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to confirm a relation between a history of childhood sexual abuse and a postsexual abuse syndrome and multiple or borderline personality disorder. Male victims of child sexual abuse show disturbed adult sexual functioning. The relation between age of onset of abuse and outcome is still equivocal. Greater long-term harm is associated with abuse involving a father or stepfather and abuse involving penetration. Longer duration is associated with greater impact, and the use of force or threat of force is associated with greater harm.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014521349290011F\n\nStop fucking pretending that children aren't hurt by this shit you fucking moron.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>7260744\n\n>telling rape victims to blow their brains out because rape victims you're friends with are important\n\n>on a literature board\n\n>while getting the quote chain wrong\n\nnow i think you're three kinds of dangerous idiot. the one that's relevant is that you think any of this opinion piece is about books. hell, i've been raped and i can still tell you're not here to talk about literature, maybe it didn't scramble my brains enough for this to be a fair exchange. not getting raped obviously did you some damage\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nIt is pretty interesting though, is it not, pedophilia.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>7260617\n\nYou can tho.

You're assuming that pedos can't tell he's an unreliable narrator, when that's what they rely on people to treat children as. Lolita doesn't end well it would be hard to see it as not a \"chasing the dragon of the first high\" book even within the opening and the tragedy implicit in that. You're not a competent enough reader to get that it's not being cited as pornography but literary itt, and that literary works are supposed to be emotionally manipulative. You're not going to convince me through your accusing others that you understood the unreliable narrator in Lolita or you could get over your hang ups to see his more reliable narrator in The Enchanter ends as most moral tales would have him end. You're throwing out flames like you could hold a discussion of this literature any other way, and you patently can't. We get it, you'd like to tell pedo's they're wrong. The problem is that is not what this board or thread is for, and no matter how much you cry for the opportunity to flaunt you basic normality, it's not going to make that literature. Take it from someone who doesn't believe fucking kids is a good thing either, you're actually just someone who likes to tell people to kill themselves, not someone who likes literature or is especially moral.
