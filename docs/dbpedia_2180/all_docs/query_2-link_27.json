        "text": "Acids and bases are an important part of organic chemistry. One of the most applicable theories is the Lewis acid/base motif that extends beyond the Brønsted-Lowry definition described in the previous section.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory is still used extensively, but it is very restrictive as it focuses primarily on acids and bases acting as proton donors and acceptors. Sometimes conditions arise where the theory doesn’t necessarily fit, such as in solids and gases. In 1923, G.N. Lewis from UC Berkeley proposed an alternate theory to describe acids and bases. His theory gave a generalized explanation of acids and bases based on structure and bonding. Through the use of the Lewis definition of acids and bases, chemists are now able to predict a wider variety of acid-base reactions. Lewis’ theory used electrons instead of proton transfer and specifically stated that an acid is a species that accepts an electron pair while a base donates an electron pair.\n\nThe reaction of a Lewis acid and a Lewis base will produce a coordinate covalent bond, as shown in Figure 1 above. A coordinate covalent bond is just a type of covalent bond in which one reactant gives it electron pair to another reactant. In this case the Lewis base donates its electrons to the Lewis acid. When they do react this way the resulting product is called an adduct.\n\nLewis acid: a species that accepts an electron pair (i.e., an electrophile) and will have vacant orbitals\n\nLewis base: a species that donates an electron pair (i.e., a nucleophile) and will have lone-pair electrons\n\nLewis acids\n\nLewis acids accept an electron pair. Lewis acids are electrophilic meaning that they are electron attracting. When bonding with a base the acid uses its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or LUMO (see figure).\n\nVarious species can act as Lewis acids. All cations are Lewis acids since they are able to accept electrons. (e.g., Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+)\n\nAn atom, ion, or molecule with an incomplete octet of electrons can act as an Lewis acid (e.g., BF3, AlF3).\n\nMolecules where the central atom can have more than 8 valence shell electrons can be electron acceptors, and thus are classified as Lewis acids (e.g., SiBr4, PF5).\n\nMolecules that have multiple bonds between two atoms of different electronegativities (e.g., CO2, SO2)\n\nLewis bases\n\nLewis bases donate an electron pair. Lewis bases are nucleophilic meaning that they “attack” a positive charge with their lone pair. They utilize the highest occupied molecular orbital or HOMO (Figure 2). An atom, ion, or molecule with a lone-pair of electrons can thus be a Lewis base. Each of the following anions can “give up” their electrons to an acid, e.g., [latex] OH^- [/latex], [latex] CN^- [/latex], [latex] CH_3COO^- [/latex], [latex] :NH_3 [/latex], [latex] H_2O: [/latex], [latex] CO: [/latex]. The Lewis base’s HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) interacts with the Lewis acid’s LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) to create bonded molecular orbitals. Both Lewis acids and bases contain HOMO and LUMOs but only the HOMO is considered for bases and only the LUMO is considered for acids (see figure).\n\nAmphoterism\n\nAs of now you should know that acids and bases are distinguished as two separate things however some substances can be both an acid and a base. You may have noticed this with water, which can act as both an acid or a base. This ability of water to do this makes it an amphoteric molecule. Water can act as an acid by donating its proton to the base and thus becoming its conjugate acid, OH-. However, water can also act as a base by accepting a proton from an acid to become its conjugate base, H3O+.\n\nWater acting as an acid:\n\n\\[H_2O + NH_3 \\rightarrow NH_4^+ + OH^- \\label{3}\\]\n\nWater acting as a base:\n\n\\[H_2O + HCl \\rightarrow Cl^- + H_3O^+ \\label{4}\\]\n\nYou may have noticed that the degree to which a molecule acts depends on the medium in which the molecule has been placed in. Water does not act as an acid in an acid medium and does not act as a base in a basic medium. Thus, the medium which a molecule is placed in has an effect on the properties of that molecule. Other molecules can also act as either an acid or a base.\n\nThe interaction between a magnesium cation (Mg2+) and a carbonyl oxygen is a common example of a Lewis acid-base reaction in enzyme-catalyzed biological reactions. The carbonyl oxygen (the Lewis base) donates a pair of electrons to the magnesium cation (the Lewis acid).\n\nReferences\n\nCycloaddition on Ge(100) of the Lewis Acid AlCl3.
