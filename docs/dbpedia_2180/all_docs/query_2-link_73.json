        "text": "The odor of fish is due primarily to amines, especially methylamine \\(\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{NH}_{2}\\right) .\\) Fish is often served with a wedge of lemon, which contains citric acid. The amine and the acid react forming a product with no odor, thereby making the less-than-fresh fish more appetizing. Using data from Appendix \\(D\\), calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction of citric acid with methylamine, if only the first proton of the citric acid \\(\\left(K_{a 1}\\right)\\) is important in the neutralization reaction.\n\nShort Answer\n\nExpert verified\n\nThe equilibrium constant for the reaction between citric acid and methylamine, considering only the first proton of the citric acid, can be calculated using the given equilibrium constants: \\(K_{a 1} (H_3C_6H_5O_7) = 7.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(K_{b} (CH_3NH_2) = 4.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\). The overall equilibrium constant (\\(K\\)) for the reaction can be found using the equation \\(K = \\frac{K_{a 1} \\times K_b}{K_w}\\), where \\(K_w\\) is the ion product of water. Plugging in the values, we obtain an equilibrium constant (\\(K\\)) of approximately 32.56 for the reaction.\n\nStep by step solution\n\n01\n\nWrite the chemical equation for the reaction\n\nFirst, let's write the chemical equation for the reaction between citric acid (H3C6H5O7) and methylamine (CH3NH2): \\(H_3C_6H_5O_7 (aq) + CH_3NH_2 (aq) \\rightleftharpoons H_2C_6H_5O_7^- (aq) + CH_3NH_3^+ (aq)\\) In the reaction, one of the three protons of citric acid reacts with the lone pair of electrons in the nitrogen atom of methylamine to form a product with no smell.\n\n02\n\nFind the relevant equilibrium constants\n\nGiven that only the first proton from the citric acid is important in the neutralization reaction, we need to find the equilibrium constants for citric acid, which are given as (\\(K_{a 1}\\), \\(K_{a 2}\\), and \\(K_{a 3}\\)), and the equilibrium constant for the reaction of methylamine, which can be represented as Kb. Since only the first proton of citric acid is important, we will only concern ourselves with the \\(K_{a 1}\\) value for citric acid. According to the given data (Appendix D), we have: \\(K_{a 1} (H_3C_6H_5O_7) = 7.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\) and \\(K_{b} (CH_3NH_2) = 4.4 \\times 10^{-4}\\)\n\n03\n\nCalculate the overall equilibrium constant\n\nNow that we have the equilibrium constants for both citric acid (\\(K_{a 1}\\)) and methylamine (\\(K_{b}\\)), we can calculate the overall equilibrium constant for the reaction (\\(K\\)): We know that the relationship between Ka and Kb is given by the following equation: \\(K_w = K_a \\times K_b\\) Where \\(K_w\\) is the ion product of water, which is equal to \\(1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\) at 25°C. Using this equation, we can express the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction as follows: \\(K = \\frac{K_{a 1} \\times K_b}{K_w}\\) Now, let's plug the values of \\(K_{a 1}\\), \\(K_{b}\\), and \\(K_w\\) into the equation to find the overall equilibrium constant: \\(K = \\frac{(7.4 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (4.4 \\times 10^{-4})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-14})}\\) \\(K = 32.56\\) Thus, the equilibrium constant for the reaction between citric acid and methylamine with only the first proton of the citric acid considered is approximately 32.56.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nThese are the key concepts you need to understand to accurately answer the question.\n\nEquilibrium Constant\n\nUnderstanding the equilibrium constant is crucial for predicting the direction and extent of chemical reactions. In a reaction where substances A and B react to form C and D, the equilibrium constant (\\( K_{eq} \\) is a numerical value that expresses the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations at equilibrium, each raised to the power of their respective coefficients in the balanced equation.\n\nFor example, for a general reaction: \\(A + B \\rightleftharpoons C +D \\), the equilibrium constant would be given by: \\(K_{eq} = \\frac{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}} \\), where the square brackets indicate concentration, and a, b, c, and d are the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products, respectively.In the case of acid-base reactions such as the neutralization of methylamine by citric acid, the equilibrium constant helps us to understand the preference of the reaction to proceed towards products or reactants. A large equilibrium constant, as calculated in our exercise, indicates that the reaction strongly favors the formation of products, hence effectively reducing the unpleasant odor of amines in fish.\n\nChemical Reactions\n\nChemical reactions involve the transformation of substances through the breaking of old bonds and the formation of new ones. The reaction between an amine and an acid is a typical acid-base reaction where a proton (\\( H^+ \\) is transferred from the acid to the base. This process can be visualized as:\\(Acid + Base \\rightleftharpoons Acid^- + Base^+ \\)\n\nSuch reactions can reach a state of equilibrium wherein the rate of the forward reaction, which produces the products, equals the rate of the reverse reaction, which regenerates the reactants. The balance between these two processes determines the composition of the reaction mixture at equilibrium, which can be quantified using the equilibrium constant previously discussed. Understanding how to write the balanced chemical equation and determine the relevant constants is essential for predicting the outcome of the reaction.\n\nAmines\n\nAmines are organic compounds derived from ammonia (\\( NH_3 \\) by replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. These compounds are characterized by the presence of a nitrogen atom with a lone pair of electrons, making them nucleophiles capable of reacting with acids.In the context of our exercise, methylamine (\\( CH_3NH_2 \\) is a simple amine where the nitrogen atom's lone pair accepts a proton from citric acid, leading to the formation of the methylammonium ion (\\( CH_3NH_3^+ \\). Amines often have fishy odors, so understanding their chemical behavior when reacting with acids provides practical benefits, such as improving the sensory appeal of food, as seen when fish is served with lemon juice.\n\nCitric Acid\n\nCitric acid (\\( C_6H_8O_7 \\) is a weak organic tricarboxylic acid commonly found in citrus fruits, such as lemons and limes. Its structure allows it to donate up to three protons, one at a time, as it has three carboxylic acid groups. When we talk about the equilibrium constant involving citric acid in our exercise, we focus only on the first dissociation, which contributes to the neutralization of the amine odor.\n\nCitric acid's first dissociation constant, \\( K_{a1} \\) is used in calculating the overall equilibrium constant for its reaction with methylamine. This constant is a measure of how readily the first hydrogen ion separates from the citric acid molecule in an aqueous solution and is critical for understanding the acid's contribution to the equilibrium state of the reaction system discussed."
