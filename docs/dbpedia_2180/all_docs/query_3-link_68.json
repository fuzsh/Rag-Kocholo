        "text": "American rapper (born 1971)\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. ( BROH-dis; born October 20, 1971), also known by his stage name Snoop Dogg (previously Snoop Doggy Dogg),[note 1] is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, media personality, and actor. His initial fame dates back to 1992 following his guest appearance on Dr. Dre's debut solo single, \"Deep Cover\", and later on Dre's debut album, The Chronic that same year. Broadus has since sold over 23 million albums in the United States, and 35 million albums worldwide.[5][6] His accolades include an American Music Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and 17 Grammy Award nominations.\n\nProduced entirely by Dr. Dre, Broadus's debut studio album, Doggystyle (1993) was released by Death Row Records and debuted atop the Billboard 200. Selling 800,000 copies in its first week, the album received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) the following year and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top ten singles \"What's My Name?\" and \"Gin and Juice\". He was the lead performer on Death Row's soundtrack album for the 1994 short film Murder Was the Case, wherein Broadus made his acting debut. His second album, Tha Doggfather (1996), likewise debuted atop the chart and received double platinum certification. In 1998, he parted ways with Death Row in favor of Master P's No Limit Records, through which he saw largely continued success with his albums Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998), No Limit Top Dogg (1999), and Tha Last Meal (2000). He then signed with Priority, Capitol, and EMI Records to release his sixth album Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002), which was further commercially oriented. This effectively continued upon him signing with Geffen Records to release his next three albums: R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004), Tha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006), and Ego Trippin' (2008); the former spawned the single \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" (featuring Pharrell), which became his first to peak atop the Billboard Hot 100. He then returned to Priority and Capitol—upon his hiring as chairman of the former label—to release his tenth and eleventh albums, Malice 'n Wonderland (2009) and Doggumentary (2011), both of which saw mild critical and commercial response.[7]\n\nDuring this time, Broadus starred in films and hosted several television shows, including Doggy Fizzle Televizzle, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood, and Dogg After Dark. In 2012, following a trip to Jamaica, Snoop converted to Rastafari and adopted the alias Snoop Lion, under which he released a reggae album, Reincarnated (2013), and a namesake documentary film about his Jamaican experience. His thirteenth studio album, Bush (2015), was produced entirely by frequent collaborator Pharrell, while his fourteenth studio album, Coolaid (2016), was released the same year as his induction into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame.[8] In 2018, Broadus became \"a born-again Christian\" and released his first gospel album, Bible of Love in March of that year.[9] In November of that year, Broadus was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[10] In 2022, Broadus acquired Death Row Records from MNRK Music Group (formerly known as eOne Music), and released his nineteenth studio album, BODR (2022)—preceded by the independently-released I Wanna Thank Me (2019) and From tha Streets 2 tha Suites (2021).[11]\n\nEarly life\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. was born on October 20, 1971, in Long Beach, California, to Beverly Tate (1951-2021) and Vernell Varnado.[12][13] Varnado, who was a Vietnam War veteran, singer, and mail carrier, left the family only three months after Broadus's birth, and thus the baby was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. (1948–1984).[14] His biological father remained largely absent from his life. As a boy, his mother nicknamed him \"Snoopy\" due to his love and likeness of the cartoon character from Peanuts.[15] He was the second of his mother's three sons. His mother and stepfather divorced in 1975.[12]\n\nBroadus was raised Baptist and began singing and playing piano at Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church when he was very young.[16][17] His mother, a member of the church choir, was one of his \"prime musical influences\" growing up and introduced him to old-school R&B music.[18] In his youth, Broadus sold candy, delivered newspapers, and bagged groceries. Broadus was described as having been a dedicated student and enthusiastic churchgoer, active in choir and football.[19]\n\nIn sixth grade, Broadus began rapping.[16] He would frequently rap in school, as he recalled: \"When I rapped in the hallways at school I would draw such a big crowd that the principal would think there was a fight going on. It made me begin to realize that I had a gift. I could tell that my raps interested people and that made me interested in myself\".[19]\n\nIn his teenage years, Broadus began engaging in unlawful activities and joining gangs, despite his mother's preventive efforts.[19] He was a member of the Rollin' 20s Crips gang in the Eastside neighborhood of Long Beach;[20] in 1993, however, he denied the frequent police and media reports by saying that he never joined a gang.[16] Shortly after graduating from Long Beach Polytechnic High School in 1989, he was arrested for possession of cocaine, and for the next three years was frequently incarcerated, including at Wayside Jail.[14] With his two cousins, Nate Dogg and Lil' ½ Dead, and friend Warren G, he recorded homemade tapes; the four called their group 213 after the area code of their native Long Beach at that time. One of Snoop's early solo freestyles over \"Hold On\" by En Vogue was on a mixtape that fortuitously wound up with Dr. Dre; the influential producer was so impressed by the sample that he called Snoop to audition in 1991 for his label Death Row Records (then known as Future Shock). Former N.W.A affiliate, American rapper Tracy Lynn Curry, better known as The D.O.C., taught him to structure his lyrics and separate the themes into verses, hooks, and choruses.[21]\n\nMusic career\n\n1991–1997: Death Row, Doggystyle, and Tha Doggfather\n\nWhen he began recording, Broadus took the stage name Snoop Doggy Dogg. He was introduced to Dr. Dre by Warren G, who gave him Broadus's cassette tape. Broadus then signed with Dre's label, Future Shock Records (which later became known as Death Row Records).[22] Dr. Dre began working with him, first on the theme song of the 1992 film Deep Cover, and then on Dr. Dre's debut solo album The Chronic, along with the other members of his former starting group, Tha Dogg Pound. This intense exposure played a considerable part in making Snoop Dogg's debut album, Doggystyle, the critical and commercial success that it was.[14]\n\nFueling the ascendance of West Coast G-funk hip hop, the singles \"Who Am I (What's My Name)?\" and \"Gin and Juice\" reached the top ten most-played songs in the United States, and the album stayed on the Billboard charts for several months.[14] Gangsta rap became the center of arguments about censorship and labeling, with Snoop Dogg often used as an example of violent and misogynistic musicians.[23] Unlike many of the harder-edged gangsta rap artists, Snoop Dogg seemed to show his softer side, according to music journalist Chuck Philips. Rolling Stone music critic Touré asserted that Snoop had a relatively soft vocal delivery compared to other rappers: \"Snoop's vocal style is part of what distinguishes him: where many rappers scream, figuratively and literally, he speaks softly\".[16] Doggystyle, much like The Chronic, featured a host of rappers signed to or affiliated with the Death Row label including Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and others.\n\nIn 1993, Broadus was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting of a member of a rival gang, who was actually killed by Broadus’s bodyguard.[24] Broadus was acquitted on February 20, 1996. According to Broadus, after he was acquitted he did not want to continue living the \"gangsta\" lifestyle, because he felt that continuing his behavior would result in his assassination or a prison term.[25] A short film about Snoop Dogg's murder trial, Murder Was the Case, was released in 1994, along with an accompanying soundtrack. On July 6, 1995, Doggy Style Records, Inc., a record label founded by Snoop Dogg, was registered with the California Secretary of State as business entity number C1923139.[26]\n\nAfter his acquittal, Snoop and the mother of his son, along with their kennel of 20 pit bulls, moved into a 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) home in the hills of Claremont, California and by August 1996 Doggy Style Records, a subsidiary of Death Row Records, signed the Gap Band Charlie Wilson as one of its first artists.[27] He collaborated with fellow rap artist Tupac Shakur on the 1996 single \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\". This was one of Shakur's last songs released while alive; he was shot on September 7, 1996, in Las Vegas, dying six days later.\n\nBy the time Snoop Dogg's second album, Tha Doggfather, was released in November 1996, the price of appearing to be a gang member \"living the gangsta life\" had become very evident. Among the many notable hip hop industry deaths and convictions were the death of Snoop Dogg's friend and labelmate Tupac Shakur and the racketeering indictment of Death Row co-founder Suge Knight.[14] Dr. Dre had left Death Row earlier in 1996 because of a contract dispute, so Snoop Dogg co-produced Tha Doggfather with Daz Dillinger and DJ Pooh.\n\nThis album featured a distinct change of style from Doggystyle, and the leadoff single, \"Snoop's Upside Ya Head\", featured a collaboration with Charlie Wilson. The album sold reasonably well but was not as successful as its predecessor. Tha Doggfather had a somewhat softer approach to the G-funk style. Snoop was scheduled to release an EP titled Doggumentary on July 8, 1997, but the album had been cancelled.[28] Despite this, a music video was released for its projected first single, Midnight Love.[28] Snoop realized that he was subject to an ironclad time-based contract (i.e., that Death Row practically owned anything he produced for a number of years), and refused to produce any more tracks for Suge Knight other than the insulting \"Fuck Death Row\" until his contract expired.[20] In an interview with Neil Strauss in 1998, Snoop Dogg said that though he had been given lavish gifts by his former label, they had withheld his royalty payments.[29]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that after Tha Doggfather, Snoop Dogg began \"moving away from his gangsta roots toward a calmer lyrical aesthetic\":[14] for instance, Snoop participated in the 1997 Lollapalooza concert tour, which featured mainly alternative rock music. Troy J. Augusto of Variety noted that Snoop's set at Lollapalooza attracted \"much dancing, and, strangely, even a small mosh pit\" in the audience.[30]\n\n1998–2006: Signing with No Limit and continued success\n\nSnoop signed with Master P's No Limit Records (distributed by Priority/EMI Records) in March 1998 and debuted on the label with Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told later that year. He said at the time that \"Snoop Dogg is universal so he can fit into any camp-especially a camp that knows how to handmake shit[;] [a]nd, No Limit hand makes material. They make material fittin' to the artist and they know what type of shit Snoop Dogg is supposed to be on. That's why it's so tight\". [sic][31] His other albums on No Limit were No Limit Top Dogg in 1999 (selling over 1,510,000 copies) and Tha Last Meal in 2000 (selling over 2,100,000).[14] In 1999, his autobiography, Tha Doggfather, was published.\n\nIn 2002, he released the album Paid tha Cost to Be da Bo$$, on Priority/Capitol/EMI, selling over 1,310,000 copies. The album featured the hit singles \"From tha Chuuuch to da Palace\" and \"Beautiful\", featuring guest vocals by Pharrell. In the same year, he featured in the remix of Welcome to Atlanta by Jermaine Dupri. By this stage in his career, Snoop Dogg had left behind his \"gangster\" image and embraced a \"pimp\" image.\n\nIn June 2004, Snoop signed to Geffen Records/Star Trak Entertainment, both distributed by Interscope Records; Star Trak is headed by producer duo the Neptunes,[32] which produced several tracks for Snoop's 2004 release R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece. \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" (featuring Pharrell), the first single released from the album, was a hit and became Snoop Dogg's first single to reach number one. His third release was \"Signs\", featuring Justin Timberlake and Charlie Wilson, which entered the UK chart at No. 2. This was his highest entry ever in the UK chart. The album sold 1,730,000 copies in the U.S. alone, and most of its singles were heavily played on radio and television. Snoop Dogg joined Warren G and Nate Dogg to form the group 213 and released The Hard Way in 2004. Debuting at No.4 on the Billboard 200 and No.1 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, it included the single \"Groupie Luv\". Snoop Dogg appeared in the music video for Korn's \"Twisted Transistor\" along with fellow rappers Lil Jon, Xzibit, and David Banner.\n\nSnoop Dogg appeared on two tracks from Ice Cube's 2006 album Laugh Now, Cry Later, including \"Go to Church\", and on several tracks on Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active the same year. His song \"Real Talk\" was leaked on the Internet in the summer of 2006 and a video was later released on the Internet. \"Real Talk\" was dedicated to former Crips leader Stanley \"Tookie\" Williams and a diss to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California. Two other singles on which Snoop made a guest performance were \"Keep Bouncing\" by Too $hort (also with will.i.am of the Black Eyed Peas) and \"Gangsta Walk\" by Coolio.\n\nSnoop's 2006 album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment debuted on the Billboard 200 at No.5 and sold over 850,000 copies. The album and the second single \"That's That Shit\" featuring R. Kelly were well received by critics. In the album, he collaborated in a video with E-40 and other West Coast rappers on the single \"Candy (Drippin' Like Water)\".\n\n2007–2012: Ego Trippin', Malice n Wonderland and Doggumentary\n\nIn July 2007, Snoop Dogg made history by becoming the first artist to release a track as a ringtone before its release as a single, \"It's the D.O.G\". On July 7, 2007, Snoop Dogg performed at the Live Earth concert, Hamburg.[33] Snoop Dogg ventured into singing for Bollywood with his first ever rap for an Indian movie, Singh Is Kinng; the song title is also \"Singh is Kinng\". He appears in the movie as himself.[34] The album featuring the song was released on June 8, 2008, on Junglee Music Records.[35] He released his ninth studio album, Ego Trippin' (selling 400,000 copies in the U.S.), along with the first single, \"Sexual Eruption\". The single peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 100, featuring Snoop using autotune. The album featured production from QDT (Quik-Dogg-Teddy).\n\nSnoop was appointed an executive position at Priority Records. His tenth studio album, Malice n Wonderland, was released on December 8, 2009. The first single from the album, \"Gangsta Luv\", featuring The-Dream, peaked at No.35 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album debuted at No.23 on the Billboard 200, selling 61,000 copies its first week, making it his lowest charting album. His third single, \"I Wanna Rock\", peaked at No.41 on the Billboard Hot 100. The fourth single from Malice n Wonderland, titled \"Pronto\", featuring Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, was released on iTunes on December 1, 2009. Snoop re-released the album under the name More Malice.\n\nSnoop collaborated with Katy Perry on \"California Gurls\", the first single from her album Teenage Dream, which was released on May 7, 2010.[36] Snoop can also be heard on the track \"Flashing\" by Dr. Dre and on Curren$y's song \"Seat Change\". He was also featured on a new single from Australian singer Jessica Mauboy, titled \"Get 'em Girls\" (released September 2010). Snoop's latest effort was backing American recording artist, Emii, on her second single entitled \"Mr. Romeo\" (released October 26, 2010, as a follow-up to \"Magic\"). Snoop also collaborated with American comedy troupe the Lonely Island in their song \"Turtleneck & Chain\", in their 2011 album Turtleneck & Chain.\n\nSnoop Dogg's eleventh studio album was Doggumentary. The album went through several tentative titles including Doggystyle 2: Tha Doggumentary and Doggumentary Music: 0020 before being released under the final title Doggumentary on March 29, 2011.[37] Snoop was featured on Gorillaz' album Plastic Beach on the track \"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\" with the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble. He also completed another track with them entitled \"Sumthing Like This Night\" which was later released on Doggumentary. He also appears on the 2011 Tech N9ne album All 6's and 7's on the track \"Pornographic\", which also features E-40 and Krizz Kaliko.\n\n2012–2013: Reincarnated and 7 Days of Funk\n\nOn February 4, 2012, Snoop Dogg announced a documentary, Reincarnated, alongside his new upcoming studio album entitled Reincarnated. The film was released March 21, 2013, with the album slated for release April 23, 2013. On July 20, 2012, Snoop Dogg released a new reggae single, \"La La La\" under the pseudonym Snoop Lion.[38] Three other songs were also announced to be on the album: \"No Guns Allowed\", \"Ashtrays and Heartbreaks\", and \"Harder Times\".[39]\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Snoop introduced a new stage name, Snoop Lion. He told reporters that he was rechristened Snoop Lion by a Rastafari priest in Jamaica.[40] In response to Frank Ocean coming out, Snoop said hip hop was ready to accept a gay rapper.[41] Snoop recorded an original song for the 2012 fighting game Tekken Tag Tournament 2, titled \"Knocc 'Em Down\"; and makes a special appearance as a non-playable character in \"The Snoop Dogg Stage\" arena.[42][43]\n\nIn September of the same year, Snoop released a compilation of electronic music entitled Loose Joints under the moniker DJ Snoopadelic, stating the influence of George Clinton's Funkadelic.[44] In an interview with The Fader magazine, Snoop stated \"Snoop Lion, Snoop Dogg, DJ Snoopadelic—they only know one thing: make music that's timeless and bangs\".[44] In December 2012, Snoop released his second single from Reincarnated, \"Here Comes the King\". It was also announced that Snoop worked a deal with RCA Records to release Reincarnated in early 2013.[45] Also in December 2012, Snoop Dogg released a That's My Work a collaboration rap mixtape with Tha Dogg Pound.[46]\n\nIn an interview with Hip Hop Weekly on June 17, producer Symbolyc One (S1) announced that Snoop was working on his final album under his rap moniker Snoop Dogg; \"I've been working with Snoop, he's actually working on his last solo album as Snoop Dogg\".[47] In September 2013, Snoop released a collaboration album with his sons as Tha Broadus Boyz titled Royal Fam.[48] On October 28, 2013, Snoop Dogg released another mixtape entitled That's My Work 2 hosted by DJ Drama.[49] Snoop formed a funk duo with musician Dâm-Funk called 7 Days of Funk and released their eponymous debut album on December 10, 2013.\n\n2014–2017: Bush, Coolaid, and Neva Left\n\nIn August 2014, a clip surfaced online featuring a sneak preview of a song Snoop had recorded for Pharrell.[50] Snoop's Pharrell Williams-produced album Bush was released on May 12, 2015,[51] with the first single \"Peaches N Cream\" having been released on March 10, 2015.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, Snoop Dogg announced the release date for his album Coolaid, which was released on July 1, 2016.[52] He headlined a \"unity party\" for donors at Philly's Electric Factory on July 28, 2016, the last day of the Democratic National Convention.[53] Released March 1, 2017, through his own Doggy Style Records, \"Promise You This\" precedes the release of his upcoming Coolaid film based on the album of the same name.

So I'll be voting for Mrs. Clinton\".[229]\n\nFollowing the deadly shooting of five police officers in Dallas on July 7, 2016, Snoop Dogg and The Game organized and led a peaceful march to the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters.[230][231] The subsequent private meeting with the mayor Eric Garcetti and police chief Charlie Beck, and news conference was, according to Broadus, \"[…] to get some dialogue and the communication going […]\".[232] The march and conference were part of an initiative called \"Operation H.U.N.T.\", serving as a police brutality protest in response to the police shooting and killing of two black men, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling,[233] whose killing prompted nationwide protests including those that led to the Dallas killing of police officers. Broadus stated that \"We are tired of what is going on and it's communication that is lacking\".[232] Reports of attendance range between 50 and 100 people.[230][232][231][234]\n\nSnoop Dogg advocates for the defunding of police departments, saying: \"We need to start taking that money out of their pocket and put it back into our communities where we can police ourselves\".[235]\n\nSnoop has consistently expressed his support for tighter gun control.

You've got to put some restrictions or ramifications on it. I can go outside right now and buy a gun. Easy. Just like that\".[236] Additionally, he released a song called \"No Guns Allowed\" feat. Drake and Cori B in 2013.[237]\n\nIn 2020, Snoop endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for President of the United States.[238] In contrast, in 2024, Snoop said that he had \"nothing but love and respect for Donald Trump\".[239][240][241]\n\nCannabis use\n\nSince the start of his career, Snoop has been an avowed cannabis smoker, making it one of the trademarks of his image. In 2002, he announced he was giving up cannabis for good;[242] this did not last long (a situation famously referenced in the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates) and in 2013, he claimed to be smoking approximately 80 cannabis blunts a day.[243] He has been certified for medical cannabis in California to treat migraines since at least 2007.[244][245][246] In 2023, he announced via social media that he was \"giving up smoke\" after much consideration, but later revealed that it was an ad to promote a smokeless fire pit called SoloStove.[247][248][249]\n\nAnimal rights\n\nSnoop Dogg regularly appears in real fur garments, especially large coats, for which he attracts criticism from animal welfare charities and younger audiences. In a video podcast in 2012, the rapper asked, \"Why doesn't PETA throw paint on a pimp's fur coat\".[250] In 2014, Snoop Dogg claimed to have become a vegan; however, he has since opted against a complete vegan diet.[251] In June 2018, he performed at the Environmental Media Association (EMA) Honors Gala. While he was performing, the logo for vegan brand Beyond Meat was displayed on the screens behind him.[252] In 2020, Snoop Dogg invested in vegan food company Original Foods, which makes Pigless Pork Rinds, which he has said are a favorite.[253] He is an ambassador for Beyond Meat and lent his name and image as well as financial support for Beyond Meat's Feed a Million+ campaign to provide a million frontline workers with Beyond Meat burgers.[254][255]\n\nWorld record for largest paradise cocktail\n\nAt the BottleRock Napa Valley music festival on May 26, 2018, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Kendall Coleman, Kim Kaechele, and Michael Voltaggio set the Guinness World Record for the largest paradise cocktail. Measuring 550 liters (150 U.S. gal), the \"Gin and Juice\" drink was mixed from 180 1.75-liter (0.46 U.S. gal) bottles of gin, 156 1-liter (0.26 U.S. gal) bottles of apricot brandy and 28 1-U.S.-gallon (3.8 L) jugs of orange juice.[256][257][258][259][260][261]\n\nLegal issues\n\nCriminal\n\n1989–1990: Felony possession of drugs and three-year prison sentence\n\nShortly after graduating from high school in 1989, Broadus was arrested for possession of cocaine and for the following three years was frequently in and out of prison.[14] In 1990, he was convicted of felony possession of drugs and possession for sale.[262]\n\n1993–1997: Traffic violation, gun possession and guilty plea\n\nIn July 1993, Broadus was stopped for a traffic violation, and a firearm was found by police during a search of his car. In February 1997, he pled guilty to possession of a handgun and was ordered to record three public service announcements, perform 800 hours of community service, pay a $1,000 fine and serve three years' probation.[263][264][265]\n\n1993–1996: Murder trial and acquittal\n\nWhile recording Doggystyle in August 1993, Broadus was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of Philip Woldermariam, a member of a rival gang, who was actually killed by Broadus's bodyguard, McKinley Lee, aka Malik.[24] Broadus had been temporarily living in an apartment complex in the Palms neighborhood in the West Los Angeles region, in the intersection of Vinton Avenue and Woodbine Street—the location of the shooting. Both men were charged with murder, as Broadus was purportedly driving the vehicle from which the gun was fired. Johnnie Cochran defended them.[266] Both Broadus and his bodyguard were acquitted on February 20, 1996.[267]\n\n1998–2010: Misdemeanor marijuana charges\n\nBroadus has also been arrested and fined three times for misdemeanor possession of marijuana: in Los Angeles in 1998;[268] Cleveland, Ohio in 2001;[269] and Sierra Blanca, Texas, in 2010.[270]\n\n2006–2007: Airport arrests and convictions\n\nOn April 26, 2006, Broadus and members of his entourage were arrested after being turned away from British Airways' first class lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. Broadus and his party were denied entry to the lounge due to some members flying in economy class. After being escorted outside, the group got in a fight with the police and vandalized a duty-free shop.[271] Seven police officers were injured during the incident. After a night in jail, Broadus and the other men were released on bail the next day but he was unable to perform a scheduled concert in Johannesburg.[272]\n\nIn September 2006, Broadus was detained at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, by airport security after airport screeners found a collapsible police baton in his carry-on bag. Donald Etra, Broadus's lawyer, told deputies the baton was a prop for a musical sketch. Broadus was sentenced to three years' probation and 160 hours of community service for the incident, starting in September 2007.[273] He was arrested again in October 2006 at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank after being stopped for a traffic infraction; he was arrested for possession of a firearm and for suspicion of transporting an unspecified amount of marijuana, according to a police statement.[274] The following month, after taping an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he was arrested again for possession of marijuana, cocaine and a firearm. Two members of his entourage, according to the Burbank police statement, were admitted members of the Rollin' 20s Crips gang and were arrested on separate charges.[275] In April 2007, he was given a three-year suspended sentence, five years' probation and 800 hours of community service after pleading no contest to two felony charges of drug and gun possession by a convicted felon. He was also prohibited from hiring anyone with a criminal record or gang affiliation as a security guard, talent manager or driver.[262]\n\n2015: Sweden arrest for illegal drug possession\n\nSnoop Dogg, after performing for a concert in Uppsala, Sweden, on July 25, 2015, was pulled over and detained by Swedish police for allegedly using illegal drugs, violating a Swedish law enacted in 1988 which criminalized the recreational use of such substances – therefore making even being under the influence of any illegal/controlled substance a crime itself without possession. During the detention he was taken to the police station to perform a drug test and was released shortly afterwards. The rapid test was positive for traces of narcotics and he was potentially subject to fines depending on the results of more detailed analysis.[276][277] Although final results \"strongly\" indicated drug use the charges were ultimately dropped because it could not be proven that he was in Sweden when he consumed the substances.[278] The rapper uploaded several videos on the social networking site Instagram criticizing the police for alleged racial profiling; police spokesman Daniel Nilsson responded to the accusations, saying: \"we don't work like that in Sweden\". He declared in the videos, \"Niggas got me in the back of police car right now in Sweden, cuz,\" and \"Pulled a nigga over for nothing, taking us to the station where I've got to go pee in a cup for nothin'. I ain't done nothin'. All I did was came to the country and did a concert and now I've got to go to the police station. For nothin'!\" He announced to his Swedish fanbase that he would no longer go on tour in the country due to the incident.[279][280][281]\n\nCivil\n\n2005: Alleged assault of a fan and lawsuit\n\nBroadus, Compton rapper Jayceon \"The Game\" Taylor and group Tha Dogg Pound, were sued for assaulting a fan on stage at a May 2005 concert at the White River Amphitheatre in Auburn, Washington. The accuser, Richard Monroe Jr., claimed he was beaten by the artists' entourage while mounting the stage. He alleged that he reacted to an \"open invite\" to come on stage. Before he could, Broadus's bodyguards grabbed him and beaten him into unconsciousness.[282] He claimed attack by crew members; Broadus and Taylor were included in the suit for not intervening, but both parties denied ever having any involvement.[283][284][285] The lawsuit focused on a pecuniary claim of $22 million in punitive and compensatory damages, battery, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.[286] The concerned parties appeared in court in April 2009; Broadus was cleared of the lawsuit in May.[287]\n\n2016: Death Row bankruptcy case and compensation loss\n\nIn May 2016, through the Death Row Records bankruptcy case, Snoop Dogg lost $2 million.[288]\n\n2022: Sexual assault lawsuit\n\nIn February 2022, a woman sued Snoop Dogg for $10 million, alleging that he sexually assaulted her in May 2013 following a concert in Anaheim, California.[289][290] Only a few months after its filing, the suit was withdrawn, then reintroduced in July.[291] In May 2023, court documents revealed that the case had been dismissed.[292] Snoop Dogg was also sued for sexual assault in 2005.[293]\n\nRegional or international banishments\n\n2006–2010: United Kingdom\n\nOn May 15, 2006, after his arrest on vandalism charges in London, the region's Home Office decided that Broadus would be denied entry to the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future and his British visa was denied the following year.[294][295][296] As of March 2010, however, Broadus was allowed back into the UK.[297] The entire group was banned from British Airways \"for the foreseeable future\".[298] According to Broadus, Queen Elizabeth II overturned the ban, saying: \"This man has done nothing in our country. He can come\".[299][300][301][302]\n\n2007–2008: Australia\n\nIn April 2007, the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship banned Broadus from entering the country on character grounds, citing his prior criminal convictions.[303] He had been scheduled to appear at the MTV Australia Video Music Awards on April 29, 2007.[304] The Australian DIAC lifted the ban in September 2008 and had granted him a visa to tour Australia. The DIAC said: \"In making this decision, the department weighed his criminal convictions against his previous behaviour while in Australia, recent conduct – including charity work – and any likely risk to the Australian community … We took into account all relevant factors and, on balance, the department decided to grant the visa\".[305]\n\n2012–2014: Norway\n\nBroadus was banned from entering Norway for two years in July 2012 after entering the country the month before in possession of 8 grams (0.3 oz) of marijuana and an undeclared 227,000 kr in cash, or about US$29,400 in 2022 terms.[306][307][308]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Snoop Dogg discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nDoggystyle (1993)\n\nTha Doggfather (1996)\n\nDa Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told (1998)\n\nNo Limit Top Dogg (1999)\n\nTha Last Meal (2000)\n\nPaid tha Cost to Be da Boss (2002)\n\nR&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece (2004)\n\nTha Blue Carpet Treatment (2006)\n\nEgo Trippin' (2008)\n\nMalice n Wonderland (2009)\n\nDoggumentary (2011)\n\nReincarnated (2013)\n\nBush (2015)\n\nCoolaid (2016)\n\nNeva Left (2017)\n\nBible of Love (2018)\n\nI Wanna Thank Me (2019)\n\nFrom tha Streets 2 tha Suites (2021)\n\nBODR (2022)\n\nMissionary (2024)[72]\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nTha Eastsidaz (with Tha Eastsidaz) (2000)\n\nDuces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way (with Tha Eastsidaz) (2001)\n\nThe Hard Way (with 213) (2004)\n\nMac & Devin Go to High School (with Wiz Khalifa) (2011)\n\n7 Days of Funk (with 7 Days of Funk) (2013)\n\nRoyal Fam (with Tha Broadus Boyz) (2013)[48]\n\nCuzznz (with Daz Dillinger) (2016)\n\nSnoop Cube 40 $hort (with Mount Westmore) (2022)\n\nFilmography\n\nMain article: Snoop Dogg filmography\n\nAwards and legacy\n\nThe Washington Post, Billboard, and NME have called him a \"West Coast icon\";[309][310][311] and Press-Telegram, \"an icon of gangsta rap\".[312] In 2006, Vibe magazine called him \"The King of the West Coast\".[313] ABC News journalist Paul Donoughue, cited him among the 1990s acts that took hip-hop into the pop music charts.[314] Broadus received the BMI Icon Award in 2011.[315] In 2023, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.[316]\n\nBroadus popularized the use of -izzle speak particularly in the pop and hip-hop music industry.[317] A type of infix, it first found popularity when used by Frankie Smith in his 1981 hit song \"Double Dutch Bus\". [318] The Guardian's Rob Fitzpatrick has credited his album Doggystyle for proving that rappers \"could reinvent themselves\", expanding rap's vocabulary, changing hip-hop fashions, and helping introduce a hip-hop genre called G-funk to a new generation.[319] The album has been cited as an influence by rapper Kendrick Lamar,[320] while fellow rappers ScHoolboy Q and Maxo Kream have also cited him as an influence.[321][322]\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n\nList of celebrities who own cannabis businesses\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSnoop Dogg (1999).
