        "text": "List of deleted Wikipedia pages with peculiar titles\n\nStrange titles are rarely added to Wikipedia under the guise of real encyclopedia articles. Occasionally, Wikipedians lose their minds (especially on April Fool's Day) and if their posts are good they wind up here. Silliness can come in the form of creativity, insanity, or just boredom. As with other \"silly things\", often it seems a shame to delete the best of this humor which has been submitted to us.\n\nUnlike bad jokes and other deleted nonsense, however, some of these article names were made for good reasons, on real topics that the writers thought might be useful for Wikipedia. That doesn't always mean that – out of context – the title will be any the less ridiculous-sounding.\n\nIf you find an article with a strange title up for deletion at WP:AFD, consider this page. If you do add it to the list, simply put it in its correct alphabetical place. Please don't link it – it'll only encourage them.\n\nAs to this page's title, consider it a mild addition to the collection of \"freaky\" titles – the real reason for it was just so that it abbreviates to DAFT. Bewildering titles, bizarre titles, and surreal titles – all are equally fair game.\n\nSee also:\n\nWikipedia:Silly Things\n\nWikipedia:Unusual requests that have been posted to the village pump\n\nWikipedia:List of really, really, really stupid article ideas that you really, really, really should not create\n\nWikipedia:Unusual articles for those \"freaky titles\" that are legitimate articles.\n\nA small note of explanation is OK, but please do not sign it – this isn't a talk page.\n\nThis is for articles or redirects that really existed on Wikipedia which have been deleted – provide proof of the deletion if you can, generally in the form of an XFD discussion page (AFD debates can be quite humorous themselves) or deletion log entry (for articles deleted before December 2004; see also the Wikipedia:Deletion log).\n\nDon't stuff beans up your nose. Do not wikilink article titles.\n\nDon't glorify vandalism. If an article title was clearly and unquestionably the work of a vandal, or was speedy deleted as a G3, G5, or G10, it's better off forgotten.\n\nDon't notify police on the crimes you commit. In other words, making something that would be DAFT, then getting it deleted, then reporting it here, is hands-down idiotic. We're assuming an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters are out there making article names with the hopes that, if one of them is DAFT enough, a user will find it and put it here. Let the chips fall where they may; don't dump them on the floor.\n\n©™® [1]\n\nÃ‡â€¹Â¬Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¨Â§ÂÃ¨Â§Â£ and Ãƒâ€¡Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ§Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¹ÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â§Ã‚ÂÃƒÂ¨Ã‚Â§Ã‚Â£[1]\n\nThe result of repeatedly encoding \"Ç‹¬ç‰¹è§è§£\" in UTF-8 and then decoding it as Windows-1252.\n\nÇ‹¬ç‰¹è§è§£[1]\n\nThe only plausible correction of this mojibake is from UTF-8 to x-mac-thai \"ร์โ«นยฌรงโ«ฐยนรจยงรจยงยฃ\", which is semantically meaningless in Thai, and at any rate is still somewhat mojibaked when converted from the then-Wikipedian ISO-8859-1 into the also-meaningless \"ว<ฌ็?น่ง่งฃ\".\n\n☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼ [2]\n\nWas a redirect to Sun.\n\nÕŕªņģę [3]\n\nA redirect to orange.\n\n🎈 release [4]\n\nA redirect to balloon release.\n\nویکیپیڈیا:Your first article [5]\n\nThe Urdu text says \"Wikipedia\".\n\nꜛꜜ‿ [6]\n\n￼￼ [7]\n\nTitle was two object replacement characters, which has zero width.\n\n(?)
