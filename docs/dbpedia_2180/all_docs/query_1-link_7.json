        "text": "Proper nouns used as modifiers, as e.g. in the Watergate scandal, a London theatre, the Ghana problem, another Hillary phone call, are a relatively new and productive phenomenon in English (see Biber and Gray 2011, Rosenbach 2007). There are only a few studies on the phenomenon in English (Rosenbach 2007, 2010) and a few on similar constructions in other Germanic languages (Schlücker 2013 on German and Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2013 on Swedish), which rather than fully explaining the phenomenon, in fact identify a variety of issues for further study. These issues fall within different traditional areas of linguistics, morpho-syntax, semantics and pragmatics, phonetics, sociolinguistics, etc. We believe that only by investigating these issues 'in dialogue' can we fully understand this new use of proper nouns in English. The aim of this workshop is then to bring together experts from different areas around the topic of proper noun modifiers. The workshop is seen as a stepping stone towards a special journal issue, in which the contributors can work with and benefit from the findings of their co-contributors, in order to reach a fuller level of understanding of this new phenomenon as well as, more generally, of the interplay of different fields of linguistics.\n\nA major semantic distinction obtaining in phrases and clauses is that between modifiers and arguments. While arguments are inherent to the meaning of the head of the phrase or clause, modifiers merely supplement the head with additional information. Typical examples of argument-taking heads are verbs and adpositions, but also relational nouns such as kinship terms and body part terms. Typical examples of modifier-taking heads are non-relational nouns, such as those denoting concrete, inanimate objects, like ‘pot’ or ‘pen’. This dissertation investigates to what extent the modifier/argument opposition constrains the morphosyntactic expression of possessive NPs, adpositional phrases and verbal main clauses. Using data of 64 different languages from all over the world, it is shown that the modifier/argument distinction strongly correlates with four typological parameters: locus of marking, the referentiality of person marking, the formal bondedness of person marking, and identity of marking. The first three parameters apply to possessive NPs: it is shown that possessive modifiers, as functionally optional enrichments of the head, are more likely to be the locus of morphosyntactic marking than possessive arguments. Also, possessive modifiers tend to be expressed by more referential and more formally independent person markers than possessive arguments. The final parameter applies beyond the domain of the NP: it is shown that if a language uses the same morphosyntactic form to mark modifiers in phrases and arguments in clauses, it also uses this form to mark arguments in phrases. Together, these findings demonstrate the typological relevance of the semantic opposition between modifiers and arguments, in the possessive NP and beyond.\n\nThis article argues that adnominal modifiers in a layered model of the noun phrase can be divided into two major subcategories: descriptive modifiers and discourse-referential modifiers. Whereas descriptive modifiers can be subdivided into classifying, qualifying, quantifying and localizing modifiers (Section 2), discourse-referential modifiers in the noun phrase are concerned with the status of entities as referents in the world of discourse (Section 3). I will pay particular attention to three issues: (i) formal reflections of the layered, semantic structure of the noun phrase (Section 4), (ii) the special relationship between localizing and discourse-referential modifiers (Section 5), and (iii) semantic and morphosyntactic parallels between modifier categories in the noun phrase and the clause (Section 6). In addition this sample-based typological study shows (contra Hawkins’s Universal 20’) that there are languages with the adjective before and the demonstrative or numeral after the head noun. These word order patterns provide additional support for the layered model of the noun phrase defended here in that it can now be shown for the first time that all patterns that iconically reflect the layered structure of the simple noun phrase are actually attested in the languages of the world.\n\nThis article discusses two classes of so-called ‘weak definites’, arguing that their (definite) form is misleading as to their (non-definite) semantics, and outlining a diachronic explanation for why each of these classes (observable in sentences such as Let’s go to the pub and He came to the bank of a river) should exhibit this particular form – function mismatch. For examples such as the pub the loss of an obligatorily definite interpretation is argued to be the result of a semantic reanalysis such that reference is no longer to a specific entity but to the activity conventionally associated with that entity. For examples such as the bank of a river the mismatch is argued to be a consequence of an incompatibility between the semantics of indefiniteness marking and the semantics of relational nouns, which arises when definiteness marking becomes obligatory in a language."
