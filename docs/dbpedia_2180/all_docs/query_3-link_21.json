        "text": "7-keto-dehydroepiandrosterone (7-keto-DHEA), also called 7-oxo-DHEA, is a metabolite of the steroid hormone precursor DHEA.[1] DHEA, in the form of its sulfate conjugate (DHEA-S), is the most abundant steroid present in human blood and has generated interest as a potential therapeutic agent in age-related and other health conditions based on studies in preclinical models.[2][3] However, DHEA is converted to androgens and estrogens, including testosterone and estradiol, and can result in sex steroid-associated side effects, such as polycystic ovaries and signs of masculinization in females.[2][3][4] Thus, 7-keto-DHEA has arisen as a promising alternative to DHEA because metabolites of DHEA, including 7-keto-DHEA, may mediate some the biological functions and physiological and clinical benefits of DHEA.[5] Importantly, unlike DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA is not converted into testosterone or estradiol.[2][6]\n\nLike DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA is produced endogenously in the adrenal glands, gonads, brain, liver, and skin.[5][7] Physiological (serum) levels of 7-keto-DHEA vary widely among individuals; however, they appear to be similar among men and women.[8] In a 2007 study of 215 individuals without endocrine disorders (91 males and 124 females; aged 5-71 years), no significant differences in 7-keto-DHEA levels were observed between males and females.[8] The overall mean (±SD) and median of 7-keto-DHEA levels were 0.280 (±0.39) nmol/L and 0.239 nmol/L, respectively.[8]\n\nAt puberty, the level of 7-keto-DHEA rapidly increases and plateaus until approximately 35 years of age; it then decreases with increasing age.[8][9] Because the level of 7-keto-DHEA is directly related to the level of DHEA, decreasing 7-keto-DHEA levels are likely a reflection of decreasing DHEA levels, which are also known to decrease with age.[10] Therefore, it is believed that DHEA and 7-keto-DHEA supplementation may help the body maintain a more youthful state and may be beneficial to individuals with low levels of DHEA or 7-keto-DHEA.[6]\n\n7-keto-DHEA is typically administered orally as an acetyl ester of 7-oxo-DHEA (3β-acetyl-7-oxo-DHEA or 7-oxo-dehydroepiandrosterone-3 acetate[11] ); this form (also often referred to as 7-keto-DHEA) is less susceptible to oxidation than 7-keto-DHEA during manufacturing and storage.[3][12][13] After administration, the 7-oxo-DHEA acetyl ester is rapidly converted to 7-oxo-DHEA-sulfate (7-keto-DHEA-S) in a concentration proportional to the administered dose.[6][14]\n\n7-keto-DHEA has been shown to promote weight loss and increase resting metabolic rate in people who are overweight.[15][16][17] In two placebo-controlled double-blind trials, participants who received 7-keto-DHEA acetyl ester lost significantly more weight than those who received placebo (2000 study: mean, -2.88 kg vs -0.97 kg, respectively; P=.01[15] and 2002 study: mean, -2.15 kg vs -0.72 kg, respectively; P=.038[16]).\n\nAnother placebo-controlled double-blind study with a 3-way cross-over design evaluated the effect of 7-keto-DHEA on resting metabolic rate in adults who were overweight.[17] Participants received the 7-keto-DHEA acetyl ester (50 mg twice daily), HUM5007 (another 7-keto-DHEA acetyl ester containing supplement; 50 mg twice daily), or placebo in conjunction with a calorie-restricted diet for 7 days (each study period was followed by a 7-day washout period).[17]"
