        "text": "LAKE SOLITUDE, NEWBURY, N.H. -- Silently and steadily, a new menace falling from the sky threatens to poison lakes and rivers, the soil, and possibly man.\n\nCalled acid rain, this killer of biological life has been drenching a vast area of the United States and Canada, sparking controversy that is certain to grow.Environmentalists are up in arms about the threat that they fear will spread worldwide with the advance of civilization.\n\nOther experts dispute the dangers of contaminated rainfall, blamed primarily on emissions from towering smokestacks, which prompts vigorous dissents from industrialists hard-pressed by government regulations and worried about monumental costs of more restrictions.\n\nWhat acid rain could mean to mankind in the long term is not known.\n\nWhat is known is that an estimated 30 million tons of sulphur oxides are blown into the air from smokestacks of U.S. utility plants and smelters fired by coal. Once in the atmosphere, a lot of it comes back to earth to kill.\n\nSome scientists believe acid rain is a forerunner of a worsening chain of events that could eventually affect the health of people living in impacted areas.\n\nThe predominant theory among atmospheric scientists is that acid rain -- some produced locally, some thrown into the sky by fossil-fuel burning plants hundreds of miles away -- falls on thousands of lakes in eastern Canada, across the U.S. Northeast and as far south as Georgia.\n\n'Sulphur, nitrogen, oxidize, acidity, alkalinity and the pH factor' are the buzz words in this latest environmental row.\n\nStudies by various air and water specialists indicate acid rain occurs when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combine with cloud moisture to form mild solutions of sulphuric and nitric acids. Once in the air, the particles are transported by strong prevailing winds in the upper atmosphere and ultimately fall to Earth as acid-laden precipitation.\n\nAt New Hampshire's Lake Solitude, the few game fish that have survived years of acid rain swim this winter under ice. They have won a reprieve until spring when the snow will melt and dissolve into the lake. Then, the accumulated acid may poison the lake and further threaten its existence as an environment for living things.\n\nThe irony is Lake Solitude still looks like the perfect fishing place. It is small and secluded and lies atop 2,743-foot-high Mount Sunapee like a teardrop from Zeus' eye.\n\nIn winter, the silence on the mountain is profound.\n\nTufts of ice coat the trees surrounding the lake. Snow cushions the steps of the occasional jackrabbit. Unseen by the human eye, steady deposits of acid accumulate in this tranquil setting on the frozen lake. In summer, the acid shower goes directly into the water.\n\nOnce there, aided according to scientists by a rock bottom, the killer goes to work on the plant life -- lily pads, weeds, plankton. When plant life dies, fish die.\n\nFish do not die suddenly. Rather, they develop chronic reproductive failures such as the inability to release fertilized eggs. Other effects on fish are spinal deformities caused by increased mobilization of mercury due to acid deposition.\n\nFrequently, areas that produce acid rain are not affected by it, either because the fallout takes place far away or local lakes and soils are well-buffered with bottoms composed of alkaline bedrock or neutralizing compounds.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 ordered plants to raise smokestack heights to carry pollution away from the local site. The theory was that increasing height would aid in the dispersal of particles.\n\nSome stacks rose from 200 feet in 1970 to above 1,000 feet in 1982.\n\nUtility owners and some scientists, however, dispute the theory that coal-burning plants cause acid rain and claim the problem is not as severe as reported.\n\n'There's been no change in the acid content of rain over the past several decades,' said Richard G. Semonin, assistant chief of the Illinois State Water Survey and a professor of meteorology at the University of Illinois.\n\nIn fact, he said, there is evidence that acid rain has been around for centuries and there is no indication it is getting worse."
