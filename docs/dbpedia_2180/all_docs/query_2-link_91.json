        "text": "SAP HANAÂ (High-performance ANalytic Appliance) isÂ a multi-model database that stores data in its memory instead of keeping it on a disk. The column-oriented in-memory database design allows you to run advanced analytics alongside high-speed transactions â in a single system.Â Why is this so important?Â Because it lets companies process massive amounts of data with near-zero latency, query data in an instant, and become truly data-driven. By storing data in column-based tables in main memory and bringing online analytical processing (OLAP) and online transactional processing (OLTP) together,Â SAP HANA is uniqueÂ â and significantly faster than other database management systems (DBMS) on the market today.\n\nÂ\n\nLaunched in 2010, SAP HANAÂ is a modern and mature solution used by tens of thousands of customers around the world. ButÂ SAP HANA is much more than a database.Â In addition to acting as a database server, storing and retrieving data requested by applications, SAP HANA offers advanced search, analytics, and data integration capabilities for all types of data â structured and unstructured. It also functions as an application server and helps companies build smart, insight-driven applications based on real-time data, in-memory computing, and machine learning technology.Â These capabilities are available both in the cloud, and on-premise.\n\nÂ\n\nBy combining multiple data management capabilities â and making all types of data instantly available from a single system âÂ SAP HANA simplifies IT, helps businesses innovate, and knocks down barriers to digital transformation.\n\nAn in-memory database (IMDB) isÂ a type of database that stores data in a computerâs main memory (RAM) instead of on traditional disks or solid-state drives (SSD). While most databases today have added more in-memory capabilities, they are still a disk-based storage database first. SAP HANA was built from the ground up to work with data in-memory first and leverage other storage mechanisms as necessary to balance performance and cost. Retrieval from memory is much faster than from a disk or SSD, resulting in split-second response times.\n\nÂ\n\nIn-memory databases are often used for applications that require top speed and the ability to handle large spikes in traffic â such as telecommunications networks and banking systems. In the last 10 years or so, mainly due to advancements in multi-core processors and less expensive RAM, companies have started to use in-memory databases for a wider range of applications, including real-time analytics and predictive modeling, customer experience management, logistics, and much more.Â\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the co-founder of SAP, Hasso Plattner, was on a mission. He wanted to develop a database that could process transactional and analytical data â and answer any business question â in real-time. 2010, SAP HANA was born and now 31,000+ direct customers run on SAP HANA today.\n\nÂ\n\n2010 - SAP HANA was announced and a pre-release version was shipped to select customers in November of that year. The first official version, SAP HANA 1.0, attained the first ten go-live customers.\n\nÂ\n\n2012 - SAP started announcing products for cloud computing with the SAP HANA Cloud PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service). SAP HANA became the fastest-growing product in SAP history with 345 customers.\n\nÂ\n\n2013 - The SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC) service was announced, an Infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS) tool, that provided customers with a managed private cloud offering for SAP HANA. Now 3,000 customers and 520K+ end-users strong.\n\nÂ\n\n2014 - SAP sets the Guinness Worldâs record for largest data warehouse at 12.1 petabytes (PB). That amount could store the entire printed content of all academic research libraries (2 Petabytes) 6 times over.\n\nÂ\n\n2015 - Recognized as a leader by Forrester in The Forrester Waveâ¢: In-Memory Database Platforms, Q3 2015. SAP HANA 2.0 and SAP S/4HANA ERP system written specifically for the SAP HANA are released, and introduce a whole new set of users to the database.\n\nÂ\n\n2016 - SAP HANA 2.0 general availability and launched SAP BW/4HANA data warehouse solution.\n\nÂ\n\n2017 - Recognized as the #1 leader in the new Forrester Waveâ¢: Translytical Data Platforms, Q4 2017 - SAP HANA is a unified and integrated data platform that simultaneously supports many types of workloads including transactional, operational, and analytical in real-time.\n\nÂ\n\n2018 - Through co-innovation, SAP becomes the first major database optimized for IntelÂ® Optaneâ¢ persistent memory\n\nÂ\n\n2019 - SAP HANA Cloud was announced, as SAPâs next-generation Data Platform as a Service (DPaaS). SAP HANA runs on all SAPâs hyperscaler partnersâ platforms.\n\nÂ\n\n2020 - SAP HANA turned 10 and launched SAP HANA Cloud to deliver the next generation of innovation of SAP HANA.\n\nÂ"
