        "text": "3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of neuraminidase treatment on the infection of tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) by IBV\n\nAfter having shown recently that sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant for IBV on cultured cells, we were interested to find out whether this type of sugar is also important for an infection in vivo. To address this question we chose TOCs as a model for the upper respiratory epithelium. The trachea of chicken embryos was cut into pieces about 1 mm thick. Tracheal rings chosen for this analysis showed ciliary activity along the whole contact area of the epithelium with the lumen of the trachea, i.e. 360° of the tracheal ring. Infection of TOCs by IBV results in ciliostasis that can easily be detected microscopically. As shown in , infection by IBV-Beaudette reduced the portion of the epithelium with ciliary activity. At 2 days post infection (d.p.i.), complete ciliostasis was observed at this experimental setting. To analyze the importance of sialic acids we treated TOCs with neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens, which releases the sialic acids from the cell surface. As a result desialylated TOCs were less sensitive to the ciliostatic effect of the IBV infection. At 5 d.p.i., about 25% of the epithelium still showed ciliary activity. This effect is accounted for by the neuraminidase itself rather than by a contaminant enzyme, because in the presence of a neuraminidase inhibitor the enzyme was unable to protect the tracheal epithelium from the ciliostatic effect of the IBV infection ( ).\n\nThe infection of cultured cells by IBV was found to be dependent on α2,3-linked sialic acid. To find out whether there is also a linkage specificity in the infection of the tracheal epithelium, TOCs were treated with neuraminidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which has a high preference for cleaving α2,3-linked sialic acid. As shown in , incubation with this enzyme protected the epithelial cells from the ciliostatic effect of the IBV infection in the same way as was observed with the neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens ( ). From this result we conclude that α2,3-linked sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant for the infection of avian tracheal epithelial cells by the Beaudette strain of IBV.\n\n3.2. Strain-dependent differences\n\nThe Beaudette strain of IBV has been adapted to grow in cultured cells of non-avian origin, such as Vero cells. To demonstrate that the sialic acid-dependent infection of tracheal epithelial cells is a general feature of IBV, we included two other strains. The M41 strain causes respiratory disease, whereas the B1648 strain has a nephropathogenic potential [8]. After application of an infectious dose of 104 pfu per tracheal ring, the IBV strains caused ciliostasis by day 3 (M41), 4 (B1648) or 5 (Beaudette) after infection ( A–C). Strain M41 was more pathogenic than the other two strains resulting in a loss of ciliary activity at 2 d.p.i. on 80% of the epithelium in the microscopic field ( C). A comparable reduction was observed with the two other strains only 3 days following infection of TOCs ( A and B). For all three strains, a protective effect of neuraminidase treatment was found. In the case of M41, ciliostasis was delayed for 1 day; in the case of the other two strains, the ciliary activity was retained in about 60% of the desialylated epithelium even on day 5 following infection. Ciliostasis was also found after infection by Avian metapneumovirus. However, in contrast to IBV infection, neuraminidase treatment did not prevent the ciliostatic effect of the metapneumovirus infection. This result confirms that the sialic acid dependence of the TOC infection is a characteristic feature of IBV.\n\nIn the experiments described above, the ciliary activity was used to monitor the course of infection. To determine the effect of neuraminidase treatment on virus production, the amount of infectious virus released from the epithelial cells was measured. Groups of five TOC rings were treated with neuraminidase prior to infection by either of the IBV strains, Beaudette and M41. In parallel, TOC were infected that had been incubated in the absence of neuraminidase. At 24 h p.i. the supernatants were collected and titrated on primary chicken kidney cells. With both virus strains, desialylation resulted in a decrease of the virus titer by about 60% ( ). There was a clear difference in the amount of virus released from infected TOCs. For the Beaudette strain, the titer of infectious virus in the supernatant was 50–100 fold higher than that determined for strain M41.\n\n3.3. Infection of different cell types in the chicken tracheal epithelium\n\nThe respiratory epithelium is the primary target for an IBV infection. Cryosections of TOC were prepared and ciliated cells were visualized by staining with antibodies directed against β-tubulin. Mucus-producing goblet cells were stained with an antibody recognizing MUC5AC. As shown in (top two rows), both ciliated and mucus-producing cells are infected by IBV. Cryosections were also stained for sialic acid expression using the lectin MAA which binds to α2,3-linked sialic acids and SNA which recognizes α2,6-linked sialic acids. The epithelial cell layer lining the surface of the trachea shows bright fluorescence after staining with MAA, indicating that these cells abundantly express α2,3-linked sialic acid. They colocalize with IBV-infected cells ( , third row). This result is consistent with a role of α2,3-linked sialic acid as a receptor determinant for IBV. Staining with SNA indicates that basal cell layers of the tracheal epithelium express α2,6-linked sialic acid. These cells are not infected by IBV ( , bottom row).\n\n3.4. Effect of neuraminidase treatment on the staining by the lectin MAA\n\nTo visualize the effect of neuraminidase treatment, we prepared cryosections of neuraminidase-treated tracheal rings and stained the sections with the MAA lectin. As shown in , neuraminidase treatment resulted in a reduced reactivity of MAA with the apical membrane of the epithelial cells. The residual fluorescent signal indicates that the neuraminidase did not release all sialic acids from the epithelial cells.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe binding to receptors on the cell surface is an important determinant of cell tropism and viral pathogenesis. Recently we demonstrated that α2,3-linked sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant for IBV on cultured cells [7]. This binding activity of IBV has been shown for strains that only grow in avian cells as well as for the Beaudette strain that has been adapted to grow also in cultured cells of mammalian origin. For the latter strain it has been recently reported that it also recognizes glycosaminoglycans of the heparan sulfate type [9]. The acquisition of this additional binding activity may have allowed the adaptation to new host cells as has been shown for other viruses, e.g. foot and mouth disease virus [10] and tick-borne encephalitis virus [11]. By contrast, the sialic acid binding activity has been detected on all IBV strains analyzed including respiratory and nephropathogenic variants. Here we have demonstrated that this also holds true for epithelial cells of the trachea, which are among the primary target cells for this virus.\n\nThe importance of sialic acid for IBV infection was evident from the delayed appearance of ciliostasis on desialylated TOCs. For the M41 strain, the ciliostatic effect was delayed only by 1 day, whereas for the two other strains analyzed, some ciliary activity was retained even 5 days after infection. This difference in the protective effect of neuraminidase treatment is probably accounted for by the difference in the cytopathogenicity of these viruses. This may also explain the larger amount of virus that is released from TOCs infected by IBV-Beaudette compared to M41-infected tracheal rings. Despite these differences, the relative effect of desialylation was similar, i.e. the amount of released virus was reduced by about 60%. The partial protection of TOCs from IBV infection may be attributable to the difficulties in removing all sialic acid residues from the cell surface of the tracheal epithelium. Staining by MAA revealed that some sialic acids are still present on the apical membrane of the epithelial cells after neuraminidase treatment. Whether this low level of sialic acid by itself is sufficient for a low level of infection is not known. An alternative explanation is that binding to surface-bound sialic acids is only a first attachment step in the infection cycle that precedes the binding to a second receptor, though such a receptor has not been identified for IBV so far. In favor of the latter explanation is the fact that IBV recognizes sialic acid with lower affinity when compared to influenza virus and Sendai virus [7]. Because of the higher affinity for sialic acids, a second receptor may be dispensable for influenza viruses; however, it may require the presence of a neuraminidase (receptor-destroying enzyme) to allow passage through the mucus layer covering the respiratory epithelium [12] and to enable virus release from infected cells [13]. On the other hand, a receptor-destroying enzyme may be dispensable for IBV because of the lower affinity for sialic acids.\n\nSo far, two groups of coronaviruses with sialic acid binding activity have been described. On one hand, there is bovine coronavirus and related viruses that resemble influenza C virus, because they recognize N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid and contain an acetylesterase that acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme comparable to the neuraminidase of influenza A and B viruses [14], [15]. These viruses depend on sialic acid for infection of cells. On the other hand, there is transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a porcine coronavirus. This virus uses aminopeptidase N as a cellular receptor and it does not require sialic acid for successful infection of cultured cells. However, binding to sialylated surface components may increase the efficiency of infection, because mutants lacking the sialic acid binding activity have lost the enteropathogenicity [16], [17]. IBV takes an intermediate position; sialic acid is important for infection of cultured cells but it lacks a receptor-destroying enzyme. As mentioned above, IBV may—in addition to sialylated surface molecules—bind to a specific receptor similar to the interaction of TGEV with aminopeptidase N. Though it has been suggested that feline aminopeptidase N may be used by IBV to infect cells [18], recently it has been shown that aminopeptidase N does not serve as a receptor for IBV [19].\n\nOur analysis of TOC revealed that both ciliated and mucus-producing cells are susceptible to infection. From this result we conclude that in vivo both cell types can act as primary target cells for IBV. The expression of α2,3-linked sialic acids and the absence of α2,6-linked sialic acids is consistent with the preference of IBV for the former linkage type ([7] and this report). In this respect IBV appears to have developed a similar strategy to avian influenza viruses which also use α2,3-linked sialic on the cell surface to initiate an infection. However, there are also major differences between avian influenza and avian coronaviruses. A major determinant of the pathogenicity of influenza viruses is the proteolytic cleavage of the hemagglutinin. The hemagglutinins of highly pathogenic viruses have a multibasic cleavage site that is susceptible to furin-like enzymes present in many cell types. Viruses of low pathogenicity become fusion-active by a protease that is secreted by respiratory cells. The S protein of all IBV strains has a multibasic cleavage site and is cleaved in all cell types into the subunits S1 and S2. Therefore, proteolytical activation of S is not a major determinant of the pathogenicity of IBV. Why some IBV strains are predominantly respiratory pathogens whereas others affect other organs to cause disease, e.g. the renal system or the reproductive tract, is not known. If there exists a second receptor for this virus as discussed above, such a protein may be responsible for the host specificity as well as the tissue or organ tropism of IBV. Future work should clarify whether a second receptor exists. Furthermore, the sialoglyconjugates used for primary attachment should be analyzed. The available lectins and neuraminidases only allow a differentiation between α2,3- and α2,6-linked sialic acids. Different oligosaccharides exist that contain α2,3-linked sialic acid, and the sialoglycoconjugates recognized by IBV may be different from those that are preferred by avian influenza viruses. Such differences may also contribute to a different course of infection. Expression of α2,3-linked sialic acid on epithelial cells in chickens has been analyzed for the trachea and the intestine [20], [21]. As far as other target organs of IBV are concerned, e.g. kidney and the reproductive system, α2,3-linked sialic acid has been shown to be present on primary kidney cells [7]. It will be interesting in the future to find out whether infection of the reproductive system is also mediated by sialic acid."
