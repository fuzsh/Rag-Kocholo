        "text": "Pink Floyd legend, David Gilmour, will release his new album, Luck And Strange, on September 6 via Sony Music.\n\nSafe to say that Gilmour - especially considering his work alongside Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright - has helped create some of rock music's most ambitious and timeless compositions, reports Gold Radio. None greater could be said, than Pink Floyd's lauded concept album, The Dark Side Of The Moon, which raised the bar for what artists could conceive in the studio and later on the stage.\n\nNow in an interview with Prog magazine, Gilmour has claimed Luck And Strange is \"the best album I've made\" since Pink Floyd's landmark 1973 album.\n\nTalking about his forthcoming record, Gilmour stated: \"It’s over fifty years now since The Dark Side Of The Moon. My feeling is that this album is the best album I’ve made in all those years since 1973 when The Dark Side Of The Moon came out.\"\n\nThat's certainly no faint praise, given that Pink Floyd released some of their finest work after that album such as 1975's ruminative masterpiece Wish You Were Here, 1977's Orwellian-inspired Animals, and the dramatic rock opera The Wall in 1979. If his fans weren't eagerly awaiting new music from Gilmour, they certainly would be now.\n\nThough as he revealed during the same interview, it might not be much longer before he releases a follow-up to Luck And Strange. \"Our plan is just to get this one out and run it and then do another one straight away. I will be working with all these people again,\" he added.\n\nLuck And Strange was recorded over five months in Brighton and London and is Gilmour’s first album of new material in nine years. The record was produced by David and Charlie Andrew, best known for his work with ALT-J and Marika Hackman.\n\nOf this new working relationship, David says, “We invited Charlie to the house, so he came and listened to some demos, and said things like, 'Well, why does there have to be a guitar solo there?' and 'Do they all fade out? Can’t some of them just end?' He has a wonderful lack of knowledge or respect for this past of mine. He’s very direct and not in any way overawed, and I love that. That is just so good for me because the last thing you want is people just deferring to you.”\n\nThe majority of the album’s lyrics have been composed by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s co-writer and collaborator for the past thirty years.\n\nSamson says of the lyrical themes covered on Luck And Strange, “It’s written from the point of view of being older; mortality is the constant.” Gilmour elaborates, “We spent a load of time during and after lockdown talking about and thinking about those kind of things.” Polly has also found the experience of working with Charlie Andrew liberating, “He wants to know what the songs are about, he wants everyone who’s playing on them to have the ideas that are in the lyric informing their playing. I have particularly loved it for that reason.”\n\nThe album features eight new tracks along with a beautiful reworking of The Montgolfier Brothers’ \"Between Two Points\" and has artwork and photography by the renowned artist Anton Corbijn.\n\nMusicians contributing to the record include Guy Pratt & Tom Herbert on bass, Adam Betts, Steve Gadd and Steve DiStanislao on drums, Rob Gentry & Roger Eno on keyboards with string and choral arrangements by Will Gardner. The title track also features the late Pink Floyd keyboard player Richard Wright, recorded in 2007 at a jam in a barn at David’s house.\n\nSome contributions emerged from the live streams that Gilmour and family performed to a global audience during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021; Romany Gilmour sings, plays the harp and appears on lead vocals on \"Between Two Points\". Gabriel Gilmour also sings backing vocals.\n\nThe album’s cover image, photographed and designed by Anton Corbijn, is inspired by a lyric written by Charlie Gilmour for the album’s final song \"Scattered\".\n\nOf working with his family on Luck And Strange, David says, “Polly and I have been writing together for over thirty years and the Von Trapped live streams showed the great blend of Romany’s voice and harp-playing and that led us into a feeling of discarding some of the past that I’d felt bound to and that I could throw those rules out and do whatever I felt like doing, and that has been such a joy.”\n\nPre-order the album here.\n\nLuck And Strange tracklistings:\n\nVinyl: Black vinyl, gatefold sleeve and booklet with photography and design by Anton Corbijn\n\nSide One:\n\n\"Black Cat\"*\n\n\"Luck And Strange\"\n\n\"The Piper’s Call\"\n\n\"A Single Spark\"\n\n\"Vita Brevis\"*\n\n\"Between Two Points\"** - with Romany Gilmour\n\nSide Two:\n\n\"Dark and Velvet Nights\"\n\n\"Sings\"\n\n\"Scattered\"***\n\nCD: Album plus two bonus tracks.
