        "text": "Various songs appear and are mentioned throughout The Hunger Games trilogy. Music, in general, holds importance for many characters: Katniss Everdeen's father was renowned for his singing voice and taught many songs to his daughter; Rue described music as her favorite thing in the world, and music often plays a part in celebrations or important events throughout Panem.\n\nMusic is prominent in the prequel novel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, in which the character Lucy Gray Baird is a member of a performing group known as the Covey. She performs a number of songs throughout the novel.\n\nFeatured songs in the trilogy\n\n\"Deep in the Meadow\"\n\n\"Deep in the Meadow\" (also known as \"Rue's Lullaby\") is a song sung by Katniss to Rue as the latter was nearing death (Marvel had speared her in the stomach)[1]. Because of her love of music[2], Rue's last request was to hear Katniss sing. At first, Katniss did not know what to sing, but then remembered a lullaby she would sing to her sister Prim when she was ill. The words are easy, soothing, and calming.[1]\n\nKatniss also found herself musing on the words of this song many years later as she watched her own children play in the Meadow in District 12.[3]\n\nIn The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Lucy Gray Baird sings this song to Maude Ivory, having sung it to her in the past when she had croup. Coriolanus Snow also listens to the song and finds it soothing, until mockingjays pick up the melody, as he finds them disturbing.[4]\n\nLyrics\n\nDeep in the meadow, under the willow\n\nA bed of grass, a soft green pillow\n\nLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes\n\nAnd when again they open, the sun will rise.\n\nHere it's safe, here it's warm\n\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm\n\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true\n\nHere is the place where I love you.\n\nDeep in the meadow, hidden far away\n\nA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray\n\nForget your woes and let your troubles lay\n\nAnd when again it's morning, they'll wash away.\n\nHere it's safe, here it's warm\n\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm\n\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true\n\nHere is the place where I love you.\n\nMedia\n\nAn official version of \"Deep in the Meadow\" was recorded for The Hunger Games film by English musician Sting. Jennifer Lawrence, who portrayed Katniss in the film series, recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2.\n\n\"The Hanging Tree\"\n\n\"The Hanging Tree\" was a song Katniss learned from her father when she was young, but Mrs. Everdeen forbid them from singing it because of the song's morbid and rebellious lyrics. Katniss would not sing the song again for another ten years, when she sang it for Pollux.[5]\n\nIn The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, the song was surreptitiously recorded for a propo, and Plutarch Heavensbee had the the words changed from \"necklace of rope\" to \"necklace of hope\". After the propo aired, rebels took it up as a protest song as they lew up hydroelectric dam, causing a massive power outage in the Capitol that allowed rebel forces to carry out a rescue mission.[6]\n\nOrigin\n\n\"The Hanging Tree\" has a brief backstory in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. It was one of many songs composed by Lucy Gray Baird, and it was written about the execution of Arlo Chance at the real hanging tree.[7][8] The song was banned by Commander Hoff, who considered it rebellious.[9] Soon after, Hoff was replaced by a new commander who banned all musical performances at the Hob because music caused trouble.[10]\n\nLyrics\n\nMedia\n\nMentioned songs\n\n\"Anthem\"\n\nThe national song of Panem at the time of the 74th Hunger Games. It often accompanies Capitol propaganda media and is played at the end of each day in the Hunger Games arena.\n\n\"Rue's four-note song\"\n\nThis simple melody was developed by Rue as a signal to the District 11 agricultural workers that the working day had ended. She whistled the tune to a group of mockingjays, who then carried it across the fields and orchards.[2] Rue and Katniss later used this tune to signal each in the arena.[11]\n\n\"Mouse song\"\n\nIn the 75th Hunger Games, Wiress sang a children's song about a mouse and a clock.[12] The Catching Fire film interpreted this as the classic folk song \"Hickory Dickory Dock\".[13]\n\n\"District 4 wedding song\"\n\nMusic features prominently in the wedding of Finnick Odair and Annie Cresta; the traditional wedding song of District 4 compares marriage to a long sea voyage, and at the celebration following the ceremony, the refugees from District 12 show off their traditional music and dancing.[14]\n\nFeatured songs in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes\n\n\"Gem of Panem\"\n\n\"Gem of Panem\" is the anthem of Panem during the Dark Days, and it remained so during the time of the 10th Hunger Games as well. It is a favorite song of the Grandma'am, the grandmother of Coriolanus Snow, and he is talented at singing it as well due to having heard her sing it many times.\n\nLyrics\n\nGem of Panem\n\nMighty city\n\nThrough the ages you shine anew\n\nWe humbly kneel\n\nTo your ideal\n\nAnd pledge our love to you\n\nGem of Panem\n\nHeart of Justice\n\nWisdom crowns your marble brow\n\nYou give us light\n\nYou reunite\n\nTo you we make our vow\n\nGem of Panem\n\nSeat of power\n\nStrength in peacetime, shield in strife\n\nProtect our land\n\nWith armored hand\n\nOur Capitol\n\nOur life\n\nMedia\n\n\"Nothing You Can Take From Me\"\n\nThis song was performed by Lucy Gray Baird at her reaping. It was the first song that Coriolanus Snow ever heard her perform. As it was broadcast nationally throughout Panem and to the Capitol, it made her an instant sensation, catching the attention of those who would be sponsors even before the sponsorship program was conceived of. The first lines of the song were actually sung by members of the Covey within the audience in District 12; Lucy Gray Baird then picked up the song and continued it.[15]\n\nLyrics\n\nYou can't take my past.\n\nYou can't take my history.\n\nYou could take my pa,\n\nBut his name's a mystery.\n\nNothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping.\n\nYou can't take my charm.\n\nYou can't take my humor.\n\nYou can't take my wealth,\n\n'Cause it's just a rumor.\n\nNothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping.\n\nThinking you're so fine.\n\nThinking you can have mine.\n\nThinking you're in control.\n\nThinking you'll change me, maybe rearrange me.\n\nThink again, if that's your goal,\n\n'Cause...\n\nYou can't take my sass.\n\nYou can't take my talking.\n\nYou can kiss my ass\n\nAnd then keep on walking.\n\nNothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping.\n\nNo, sir,\n\nNothing you can take me from me is worth dirt.\n\nTake it, 'cause I'd give it free. It won't hurt.\n\nNothing you can take from me was ever worth keeping!\n\nMedia\n\n\"The Ballad of Lucy Gray Baird\"\n\nThis song is performed by Lucy Gray Baird during her interview before the Games. Coriolanus Snow considered it a dark, moving and far too personal account of Lucy Gray's life, and found himself jealous.[16] Lucy Gray later explained to Snow that the last line specifically refers to Billy Taupe Clade, in that he bet that he could have the affections of both her and Mayor Lipp's daughter, Mayfair.[4] In author Suzanne Collins's acknowledgements for The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, she states that is an entirely original song and is meant to be sung to a variation of a traditional ballad tune that has long accompanied tales of the unfortunate ends of rakes, bards, soldiers, cowboys, and the like. The title of the song is provided in these acknowledgements.[17]\n\nLyrics\n\nWhen I was a babe I fell down in the holler.\n\nWhen I was a girl I fell into your arms.\n\nWe fell on hard times and we lost our bright color.\n\nYou went to the dogs and I lived by my charms.\n\nI danced for my dinner, spread kisses like honey.\n\nYou stole and you gambled and I said you should.\n\nWe sang for our suppers, we drank up our money.\n\nThen one day you left, saying I was no good.\n\nWell, all right, I'm bad, but then, you're no prize either.\n\nAll right, I'm bad, but then, that's nothing new.\n\nYou say you won't love me, I won't love you neither.\n\nJust let me remind you who I am to you.\n\n'Cause I am the one who looks out when you're leaping.\n\nI am the one who knows how you were brave.\n\nAnd I am the one who heard what you said sleeping.\n\nI'll take that and more when I go to my grave.\n\nIt's sooner than later that I'm six feet under.\n\nIt's sooner than later that you'll be alone.\n\nSo who will you turn to tomorrow, I wonder?\n\nFor when the bell rings, lover, you're on your own.\n\nAnd I am the one who you let see you weeping.\n\nI know the soul that you struggle to save.\n\nToo bad I'm the bet that you lost in the reaping.\n\nNow what will you do when I go to my grave?\n\nMedia\n\n\"The Old Therebefore\"\n\nThis was another song performed by Lucy Gray Baird. She sang it after Dr. Volumnia Gaul loosed snake muttations into the Capitol Arena. The snakes were completely mesmerized by her and after completing it, Lucy Gray began a soft humming to keep them docile.[18]\n\nLyrics\n\n(La, la, la, la,\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la,\n\nLa, la, la, la, la, la. . .)\n\nYou're headed for heaven,\n\nThe sweet old hereafter,\n\nAnd I've got one foot in the door.\n\nBut before I can fly up,\n\nI've loose ends to tie up,\n\nRight here in The old therebefore.\n\nI'll be along\n\nWhen I've finished my song,\n\nWhen I've shut down the band,\n\nWhen I've played out my hand,\n\nWhen I've paid all my debts,\n\nWhen I have no regrets,\n\nRight here in\n\nThe old therebefore,\n\nWhen nothing\n\nIs left anymore.\n\nI'll catch you up\n\nWhen I've emptied my cup,\n\nWhen I've worn out my friends,\n\nWhen I've burned out both ends,\n\nWhen I've cried all my tears,\n\nWhen I've conquered my fears,\n\nRight here in\n\nThe old therebefore,\n\nWhen nothing\n\nIs left anymore.\n\nI'll bring the news\n\nWhen I've danced off my shoes,\n\nWhen my body's closed down,\n\nWhen my boat's run aground,\n\nWhen I've tallied the score,\n\nAnd I'm flat on the floor,\n\nRight here in\n\nThe old therebefore,\n\nWhen nothing\n\nIs left anymore\n\nWhen I'm pure like a dove,\n\nWhen I've learned how to love,\n\nRight here in\n\nThe old therebefore,\n\nWhen nothing\n\nIs left anymore.\n\nMedia\n\n\"That Thing I Love With\"\n\nThis song is performed by Lucy Gray Baird and the Covey at the Hob. It is the first song that she performs upon her return to District 12 after winning the 10th Hunger Games, and it is the first song that Coriolanus Snow hears her perform in District 12. It has a bright and upbeat musical accompaniment.[19]\n\nLyrics\n\nMy heart's stupid and that's not maybe.\n\nCan't blame Cupid, he's just a baby.\n\nShoot it, boot it, execute it,\n\nStill comes a-crawling to you-hoo.\n\nHeart's gone funny, it won't hear reason.\n\nYou're like honey, you bring the bees in.\n\nSting it, wring it, give it a fling, it\n\nStill comes a-crawling to you.\n\nI wish it mattered that\n\nYou chose to smash it up.\n\nHow come you shattered that\n\nThing I love with?\n\nDid you feel flattered that\n\nYou could just trash it up?\n\nThat's why you battered that\n\nThing I love with.\n\nTrapped my ticker but haven't freed it.\n\nPeople snicker at how you treat it.\n\nSnare it, tear it, strip it bare, it\n\nStill comes a-crawling to you-hoo.\n\nHeart's been jumping just like a rabbit.\n\nBlood keeps pumping but that's just habit.\n\nDrain it, pain it, I'm insane, it\n\nStill comes a-crawling to you.\n\nBurn it, spurn it, don't return it,\n\nBreak it, bake it, overtake it,\n\nWreck it, deck it, what the heck, it\n\nStill comes a-crawling to you.\n\n\"Lucy Gray\"\n\nThis was the song from which Lucy Gray Baird got her name. Maude Ivory performed it for Snow during a day trip to the lake in the wilderness, a couple of hours from District 12. The song was about a girl who was sent out into a snowstorm and apparently ended up becoming a ghost girl. Snow disliked the song, as he both did not understand it entirely and thought it ridiculous.[20]\n\n\"Lucy Gray\" is actually originally a poem written by William Wordsworth in 1799. The poem, due to its age, is in the public domain. The lyrics featured in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes are slightly tweaked by author Suzanne Collins to fit the Covey.[17]\n\nLyrics\n\nOft I had heard of Lucy Gray:\n\nAnd, when I crossed the wild,\n\nI chanced to see at break of day\n\nThe solitary child.\n\nNo mate, no comrade Lucy knew;\n\nShe dwelt where none abide\n\n—The sweetest thing that ever grew\n\nUpon the mountainside!\n\nYou yet may spy the fawn at play\n\nThe hare among the green;\n\nBut the sweet face of Lucy Gray\n\nWill never more be seen.\n\n“To-night will be a stormy night—\n\nYou to the town must go;\n\nAnd take a lantern, Child, to light\n\nYour mother through the snow.”\n\n“That, Father! Will I gladly do:\n\n'Tis scarcely afternoon —\n\nThe village clock has just struck two,\n\nAnd yonder is the moon!”\n\nAt this the Father turned his hook,\n\nTo kindling for the day;\n\nHe plied his work; — and Lucy took\n\nThe lantern on her way.\n\nAs carefree as a mountain doe:\n\nA fresh, new path she broke\n\nHer feet dispersed the powdery snow,\n\nThat rose up just like smoke.\n\nThe storm came on before its time:\n\nShe wandered up and down;\n\nAnd many a hill did Lucy climb:\n\nBut never reached the town.\n\nThe wretched parents all that night\n\nWent shouting far and wide;\n\nBut there was neither sound nor sight\n\nTo serve them as a guide.\n\nAt daybreak on a hill they stood\n\nThat overlooked the scene;\n\nAnd thence they saw the bridge of wood,\n\nThat spanned a deep ravine.\n\nThey wept — and, turning homeward, cried,\n\n\"In Heaven we all shall meet!\";\n\n— When in the snow the mother spied\n\nThe print of Lucy's feet.\n\nThen downwards from the steep hill's edge\n\nThey tracked the footmarks small;\n\nAnd through the broken hawthorn hedge,\n\nAnd by the long stone-wall;\n\nAnd then an open field they crossed:\n\nThe marks were still the same;\n\nThey tracked them on, not ever lost;\n\nAnd to the bridge they came.\n\nThey followed from the snowy bank\n\nThose footmarks, one by one,\n\nInto the middle of the plank;\n\nAnd further there were none!\n\n— Yet some maintain that to this day\n\nShe is a living child;\n\nThat you may see sweet Lucy Gray\n\nUpon the lonesome wild.\n\nO'er rough and smooth she trips along,\n\nAnd never looks behind;\n\nAnd sings a solitary song\n\nThat whistles in the wind.\n\nMedia\n\n\"I'll Sell You For a Song\"\n\nLucy Gray Baird sings this song, described as a downbeat number with a \"mournful\" musical accompaniment by the rest of the Covey. Coriolanus Snow disliked it, as he thought that it might be inspired by Lucy Gray's spurned lover, Billy Taupe.[21]\n\nLyrics\n\nYou come home late,\n\nFall on your cot.\n\nYou smell like something that money bought.\n\nWe don't have cash, or so you say.\n\nSo where did you get it and how'd you pay?\n\nThe sun don't rise and set for you.\n\nYou think so, but you're wrong.\n\nYou tell me lies, I can't stay true—\n\nI'll sell you for a song.\n\nYou get up late,\n\nWon't say a word.\n\nYou been with her, that's what I've heard.\n\nI don't own you, so I've been told..\n\nBut what do I do when the nights get cold?\n\nThe moon don't wax and wane for you.\n\nYou think so, but you're wrong.\n\nYou cause me pain, you make me blue—\n\nI'll sell you for a song.\n\nYou're here, you're not.\n\nIt's more than me,\n\nIt's more than you, it's more like we.\n\nThey're young and soft, they worry so.\n\nYou coming or going, they need to know.\n\nThe stars don't shine and shoot for you.\n\nYou think so, but you're wrong..\n\nYou mess with mine, I'll hurt you, too—\n\nI'll sell you for a song.\n\n\"Pure As The Driven Snow\"\n\nThis was another song by Lucy Gray Baird. Coriolanus Snow believed she had written it for him.[22]\n\nLyrics\n\nEveryone's born as clean as a whistle—\n\nAs fresh as a daisy\n\nAnd not a bit crazy.\n\nStaying that way's a hard row for hoeing—\n\nAs rough as a briar,\n\nLike walking through fire.\n\nThis world, it's dark,\n\nAnd this world, it's scary.\n\nI've taken some hits, so\n\nNo wonder I'm wary.\n\nIt's why I\n\nNeed you—\n\nYou're pure as the driven snow.\n\nEveryone wants to be a hero—\n\nThe cake with the cream, or\n\nThe doer not dreamer.\n\nDoing's hard work, It takes some to change things—\n\nLike goat's milk to butter,\n\nLike ice blocks to water.\n\nThis world goes blind\n\nWhen children are dying.\n\nI turn to dust, but\n\nYou never stop trying.\n\nIt's why I\n\nLove you—\n\nYou're pure as the driven snow.\n\nCold and clean,\n\nSwirling over my skin,\n\nYou cloak me.\n\nYou soak right in,\n\nDown to my heart.\n\nEveryone thinks they know all about me.\n\nThey slap me with labels.\n\nThey spit out their fables.\n\nYou came along, you knew it was lying.\n\nYou saw the ideal me,\n\nAnd yes, that's the real me.\n\nThis world, it's cruel,\n\nWith troubles aplenty.\n\nYou asked for a reason—\n\nI've got three and twenty\n\nFor why I\n\nTrust you—\n\nYou're pure as the driven snow.\n\nThat's why I\n\nTrust you—\n\nYou're pure as the driven snow.\n\nMedia\n\n\"The Valley Song\"\n\nLucy Gray Baird sang a slightly modified version of \"Down in the Valley,\" a traditional American folk song, in the monkey cage at the Capitol zoo,[23] and later to Snow in District 12.[19] This may also be the same song Peeta Mellark remembers hearing Katniss sing at school when they were children.[24]\n\nLyrics\n\nDown in the valley, valley so low,\n\nLate in the evening, hear the train blow.\n\nThe train, love, hear the train blow.\n\nLate in the evening, hear the train blow.\n\nGo build me a mansion, build it so high,\n\nSo I can see my true love go by.\n\nSee him go by, love, see him go by.\n\nSo I can see my true love go by.\n\nGo write a letter, send it by mail.\n\nBake it and stamp it to the Capitol jail.\n\nCapitol jail, love, to the Capitol jail.\n\nBake it and stamp it to the Capitol jail.\n\nRoses are red, love; violets are blue.\n\nBirds in the heavens know I love you.\n\nKnow I love you, oh, know I love you,\n\nBirds in the heavens know I love you.\n\nOther minor songs\n\nMockingjays and jabberjays echoed people's screams at the hanging tree in District 12, gradually devolving from recognizable human speech into \"a string of notes that mirrored the inflection of [one's] voice\".[19]\n\nMaude Ivory sang a version of a traditional American folk ballad, \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\".[19][17]\n\nCoriolanus described something Lucy Gray once sung about a man thought to have frozen to death. After an attempt at cremation, \"he only thawed out and was fine. Sam Somebody.\"[20] This is likely \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\", a 1907 poem by Robert W. Service.\n\nThe Covey also sang a birthday song to Commander Hoff.[22]\n\nThe Covey performed a version of \"Keep on the Sunny Side\", originally written by Ada Blenkhorn and J. Howard Entwhistle.[21][17]\n\nTrivia\n\nIn The Hunger Games film, Katniss sings the first verse of \"Deep in the Meadow\" to Prim to calm her down from a nightmare, just before she leaves to go hunting on the morning of the Reaping.[25]\n\nDuring training for the 75th Hunger Games, Beetee mentions to Katniss that he has created a music chip small enough to be concealed in a flake of glitter, but that can hold hours of songs[26].\n\nWhile confined in the Training Center following her assassination of President Coin, Katniss finds herself singing all the songs she had learned from her father, \"Hour after hour of ballads, love songs, mountain airs.\"[27]\n\nJennifer Lawrence was allegedly \"horrified to sing\" the Hanging Tree song. It was reported that she \"cried a little bit in the morning before\" the scene was shot. She was very insecure about her voice.[28] Fortunately, she did an amazing job and the song went to Number 1 worldwide on the iTunes Sales chart.[29]"
