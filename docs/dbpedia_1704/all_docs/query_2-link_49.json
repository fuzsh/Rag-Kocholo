        "text": "Trevor Jackson may be twenty years into his entertainment career, but the actor and musician feels like he’s just getting started, even though his list of accomplishments already runs longer than most. He was only eight years old when he made his debut on the national tour of The Lion King as Young Simba. At 15, he signed to Atlantic Records, releasing his first single, “Like We Grown” a year later. That same year, he stole tween hearts in Disney’s 2012 hip-hop movie musical Let It Shine (alongside Abbott Elementary star Tyler James Williams and R&B star Coco Jones).\n\nJackson’s biggest role to date has been as the romantic interest on the long-running Freeform sitcom Grown-ish, which ended this May. Now, the 27-year-old is diving headfirst into music with his sophomore album It’s Complicated. Through a blend of R&B, Afrobeats, and hip-hop, he tackles the messier aspects of love and relationships, oscillating between emotional devastation and nonchalance. GQ spoke with the R&B artist via Zoom about his renewed focus on music, being the guy on the side, and that viral cover of Tyla's “Water.\"\n\nGQ: What about It's Complicated are you most proud of?\n\nTrevor Jackson: I'm most excited about the perspective. I don't think we've heard a body of work that came from this type of love story. This guy's in love with somebody who's in a relationship. And in this day and age, it's very hard to date, so I like giving the perspective of the guy on the side. I'm excited for people to hear that side and the vulnerability, and just the growth too. For me, as a songwriter, I've grown a lot.\n\nThe album tells a story that you began teasing on your previous EPs He Don't Know and Heads Up. What was it like crafting a narrative that you had to build up to?\n\nI think when you start with Heads Up, people listen to that project, and they [understand that we’re] in a very toxic love triangle [story] here. And then when the album comes, you get a little more of the other side of it, the player. You're also getting, “Hey, don't sell me a love that you know I cannot buy when I'm just a guy on the side. Don't show me false dreams.” It starts off a little bit guarded, and then by the time the album comes out, the veil has been lifted up and the heart is more on the outside of the chest.\n\nWhat's your favorite song on the album?\n\nMan, it's probably between “Happy Home,” “Heads Up,” and “Guy on the Side.” I like “Guy on the Side” because it almost feels a little punk-rocky, the feel, the tone of my voice. I wrote that song really fast because I was just being real. And then “Happy Home” is just an absolute vibe. “Heads Up” I love a lot because it’s reminiscent of the late '90s, early 2000s. Even in the video, I wanted to [recreate]that storytelling of how it was back then. And that was actually one of the realest songs. I was at the studio, we were about to make a record, and I was inviting people to come hang out and vibe. And the person I was on the phone with was like, \"Hold on, I can't come. I'm at my man's house right now.\" And then they hung up. I was like, \"Oh, we gotta make that a song.\" That's how it came to me.\n\nOh my gosh. Well, you said the album was based on your personal experiences.\n\nYeah, for sure. I'm definitely dating, I'm moving around. There was a real funny thing my dad told me. He was like, \"Yo, every woman has a maintenance man.\"\n\nIn some experiences, people have things that they're used to and comfortable with. Even if it doesn't work for them in a relationship, even if there's no future in it, people like to feel safe and comfy. When you develop love or rapport with someone, it's hard to move on or hard to change that because you guys maybe met at a certain time, you maybe helped each other through something, so you're still holding on.\n\n“Jog Your Memory,” for instance, is one where you're away from somebody for so long, but then you guys run into each other and it's electric. It's the pheromones. You're like, \"Wow, I remember being with you every single day of my life. I know I never see you, but when we're together, my memory's jogged. I remember how it was.\"\n\nFor your next album, are you interested in exploring this perspective more? What are you hoping to expand on in your artistry? Any new sounds?\n\nI already have the next album written and finished and done. It's the prequel to It's Complicated. Before we started doing this deceitful kind of love that we have, we were real lovers, but something happened. The next album is the prequel to show how we got to this place, how we got into this complicated little murky-water area.\n\nHow do you think your sound and your approach to songwriting has evolved since your last album?\n\nI think it's a little more honest. There's a few songs on this album that I made right after a situation had happened to me. Whether that's me hearing a story someone said or I was going through some things personally, I literally just dove directly into the music and didn't overthink it. I think what I have done in the past is trying to make the best music in the world, and now I'm just trying to make the realest music in the world, the most honest music for me. I think that's the difference.\n\nWho were some musical influences for you when writing this album? Of course, there's a lot of Afrobeats and you recently covered Tyla's “Water,” so I know you've got an Afrobeats thing going on, but who are some artists you were thinking of while making the album?\n\nThis whole It's Complicated rollout, I wanted to go back to the days when I was growing up and I was watching Jodeci, I was watching Boyz II Men, and a lot of these amazing, R&B vocalists. I wanted to have that little nostalgic feeling too. When you hear songs like “Remember the Time” or “Heads Up,” those are reminiscent of that. I'd say I'm most inspired by Brian McKnight or Usher.\n\nAnd then you did make that connection with “Water.” When I did that, I picked a bunch of songs. That happened to be one that everybody loved, but I definitely was like, “Hey, maybe I should put an Afrobeats song on the album because that did so well and people received it so well.” I'm constantly trying to take inspiration—whether it's from nature, music, TV, movies—and turn it into something beautiful.\n\nI don't know if you saw Tyla’s reaction to your cover. She was really feeling it. She said that it was a 12 out of 10. Is she someone that you'd want to work with someday?\n\nA hundred percent. I'm waiting on her to hit me up. Let's go. I think she's a dope artist. And there's a difference between being beautiful and being talented, being a star. I think she's an absolute star. I would love to work with her. And we'd make some magic, honestly.\n\nI want to talk a little bit about T-Mix Tuesdays, your covers series on TikTok. How did you come up with that idea?\n\nMy brother and my mom were pressing me to do those, and I didn't want to because I look at music like anybody looks at their profession. I'm putting a lot of work in. I want to get paid for my time. I didn't want to give music away for free. But then my brother was like, \"Dude, do you think that you making these songs will stop you from making good songs in the future?\" He's like, \"Dude, you're limitless. You're a boundless creative creature— show them what the F you can do.\"\n\nAnd he was right. It definitely showed people that music isn't just a hobby. It's my actual life. And they got to see my writing abilities, my arrangements. And we also wanted to do that to get featured and show artists, like, \"Hey, I sound good on this. Can you put me on it?\"\n\nYou mentioned your brother being the one to push you to start your T-Mix videos. I'm really interested in your relationship with your family. You've been in the industry for a long time, so what was that like having your family behind you through the years?\n\nI wouldn't be alive, to be honest, without my family. They keep me sane, they keep me together, and they're also my business partners. My mother and my brother, we're a family business. That's the best thing because I never have to worry about trust with them. I just always know that we're all here for the same reason. We want to win. I didn't get to play basketball with my brother growing up on a team, but now I get to run a business with him alongside my mom.\n\nIt's really, really dope, man. It's a different dynamic. Most people don't do that, but for me it's worked out. And I'm just happy—whether I have music or not—to have a family that loves me and supports me and sees me for who I am. It's the biggest gift.\n\nHow have your interests evolved since you were a young star?\n\nI've evolved a lot. I think acting-wise, I’m just a little more still. I still got a lot of energy, but not as much as I had. I'm just being more honest and open with myself, with the world. And I think that's the way we can really help, is to share your story and not preaching to anybody or pointing to anybody, but just sharing what you've been through, where you're at.\n\nAnd also, I've become a businessman, and taken the reins of my career when it comes to money, business, meetings, and stuff. Just trying to be more present and more on top of things.\n\nTell me about your decision to stay an independent artist. Why is that important to you?\n\nIt's my vision. It's mine. And I don't owe anybody any money. But the other side of it is I'm spending all the money. It's a little Catch-22. But the best part is, like I said, the vision is so honest. The vision is so me. I don't have to compromise.\n\nI feel like a lot of artists get into a building and, because they want to be pushed and because they want to have a team around them that's going to work for them, they feel like whatever they say is bond. \"If they want me to wear this and do this, they're paying for the video, so I have to do it.\" And for me, I get to do what I want and I just get to tell my story.\n\nWhat made you make the switch from being signed to a label?\n\nIt just wasn't mine. It wasn't my vision. And a lot of people would maybe tell me what to wear, what kind of songs to sing. It's not as authentic. I just didn't want to live my life and look back and be like, \"Man, I wasn't true to myself,\" or, \"I didn't do the music I wanted to do, the videos I wanted to make.\"\n\nI want to talk a little bit about your mentors. I know Eric Bellinger has been a mentor to you. You recently toured with him. Tell me a little bit about your relationship with him and any other people you've met along the way.\n\nEric Bellinger wrote on my first project. He called me before we went on tour, and he was like, \"Yo, this shit is dope. You want to go on tour with me?\" I was like, \"Yeah, dude. Heck yeah.\" And to be honest, you can get a little discouraged in life.\n\nAnd when Eric Bellinger told me that my shit was dope, I was like, \"Okay, I'm good. I'm good at music.\" Because he's one of my favorite songwriters, and he has multiple number ones. So that gave me a little boost of confidence and helped me out a lot when I was moving on to my next project. Just the confidence in the studio, writing, believing in myself. Shout out to him for that.\n\nMike Jay is also another amazing songwriter artist that I've worked with since I was young. When I was 15, he wrote my first record, “Like We Grown.” We're still writing together now. I think he's got four on It's Complicated. I keep those people close to me.\n\nGrown-ish just ended after six seasons. What is the next step for you in your acting career? Or are you planning to focus on music for a little bit?\n\nGrown-ish was amazing. It was an honor to be a part of that show, and it'll be in my heart forever. I'm focused on the album right now, but I'm definitely always auditioning. I'm always producing. There's always something around the corner. As of right now, I'm not exactly sure, but acting is always going to be a part of my life. And if it rolls right, if the timing is right, I'm always open to that.\n\nYou had so much time to spend with Aaron. I feel like that character resonated with a lot of people. What was it like saying goodbye to a character that you developed and lived with for such a long time?\n\nIt was sad. It was really sad, but I'm also very proud of that. Aaron inspired me, just the relentlessness, the ambition. It was an honor to be a part of that show. I think it was the culture. I think it pushed the culture. So many people came up to me and talked about how they were helped by my character or the show. You always want to be a part of projects like that."
