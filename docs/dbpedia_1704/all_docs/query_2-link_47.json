        "text": "I found a very simple solution. Open the iTunes Store, press search at the bottom and search for the song you want to redownload. Then purchase it again, and a little pop up will appear saying you already own the song and you can download it again for free. Hope this helped\n\nI was having the same problem and just figured it out. Just like a lot of you, the fixes listed here didn't work for me. This is what I did:\n\n1.) Open iTunes Store app\n\n2.) Scroll to the bottom of the Music tab to your Apple ID\n\n3.) Tap your Apple ID and select \"View Apple ID\"\n\n4.) It will take you to your Account Settings and you'll scroll down to and select \"Hidden Purchases\"\n\n5.) Select \"Music\" and it should all be there\n\n6.) Select \"Unhide\" and it should automatically start downloading the songs.\n\nHope that helps!\n\nThe same exact thing is happening to me and I'm so aggravated by it. I removed the album from my downloads and phone because I thought it gave my phone a virus for some reason. The album isn't in my downloads or purchases but when I search the album it says purchased and I can't do anything further than that.\n\nThis is an even worse issue, now. Apple simply does not care whether itunes is usable or not, just subscribe to their sub-par music service, give them your money and shut up. I too, have given up. I will never buy another song or movie from itunes as long as I live. If I didn't have so much invested in Apple software, i would switch to Windows.\n\nI have a answer for you all. Please follow following steps\n\n1) Go to iTunes on computer\n\n2) Go to iTunes store and \"Sign in\"\n\n3) On the right hand side by \" Qick Links \" under that and click \" Account \" and sign in again.\n\n4) You will your account information.\n\n5) Go down you'll see \" iTunes in iCloud\" and click \" Hidden Purchase\" and go to \" Manager\" to \"Unhidden\"\n\nNow you can able download whatever you miss on your purchased history on your iTunes ! Hope that help.\n\nGo to your account in iTunes. Find the iTunes in the Cloud section under your Apple ID Summary section. Find Hidden Purchases: Unhide any hidden, redownloadable Purchases and click Manage. The next page will show all your hidden albums you didn't intend hiding. ***! Click the \"unhide\" button and voila! You can then go back to Purchases not on my device and click the cloud arrow next to the previously \"hidden\" album. Who is the sadistic programmer at Apple configured this confounding puzzle and why?\n\nSame problem here. What I did to get my 2 albums that mistakenly deleted. It said purchased but I couldn't re download. So I went on my laptop. Went into iTunes. I clicked on \"Store\". Then on the right side of screen clicked on \"Account\". Then you log in. Scroll down a bit. Can remember exactly what it said but you can see where it says to manage unhide purchases or something like that. Click on \"Manage\". Then I saw the 2 albums the I previously couldn't download. Underneath the each album was a button to \"Unhide\". I clicked both albums. Then shortly after doing so. I looked on iTunes Store on my iPhone under purchases and there they were. I re downloaded and I was happy. Good Day, Sir.\n\nThis is the stupid easy way to get rid of this problem:\n\n1. Go into Itunes on your phone\n\n2. Find the album or song in question\n\n3. Play the preview for it\n\n4. Let it play for a few seconds, and then go back to Music and find the little extras bar in the top right corner\n\n5. It will show up as previewed with the song price. Click on song price and sign in as prompted or just click on price\n\n6. After this, it will say that the song has already been purchased and will ask if you want to download it again for free. Click yes\n\n7. Bam, all of this other stuff has been bypassed. You now have your songs back!\n\nIf the problem is only that the track (or tracks) isn't showing up in the \"Purchased\" playlist, simply find the track (or tracks) in the iTunes library and drag-n-drop them to the playlist.\n\nFYI you are looking in the iTunes Store for your purchased songs; they cannot be re-downloaded from there. You must re-download music from your purchase history. See this Apple KB article: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2519. If a track is already in your iTunes library you will not be able to re-download it until you delete it from the library.\n\nI had the same problem but figured out a way around it and it worked for me. I searched for the specific song then I added the song to my wish list. Then in my wish list it had a button for the purchase price. I tapped on it. It asked if I wanted to pay for it. I said yes, it asked for my finger print or if you don't have that set up, it'll be your Apple ID password, then as it began to download a message box popped up that said to download for free tap here, (since I had already purchased it prior, of course) I tapped it, and it downloaded without additional charge."
