In the live and studio versions of the song \"Vera,\" it's referenced directly (\"Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn? / Remember how she said that we would meet again some sunny day?\"). The Vera Lynn song The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot is the first song in the movie.\n\n\"Empty Spaces\" begins with a secret message recorded backwards:\n\nRoger Waters: \"Congratulations, You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answers to 'Old Pink', Care of 'The Funny Farm', Chalfonte...\" [interrupted by James Guthrie who says] \"Roger, Carolyne's on the phone...\"\n\n\"Waiting For The Worms\": Near the end of the track, Roger (as Pink) barks out instructions and directions in street names (most of the words are inaudible):\n\nWe're (waiting to succeed) and going to convene outside Brixton Town Hall where we're going to be… WAITING…to cut out the deadwood… The Worms will convene outside Brixton Bus Station. We'll be moving along at about 12 o'clock down Stockwell Road… (Abbot's Road)… twelve minutes to three we'll be moving along Lambeth Road towards Vauxhall Bridge. Now when we get to the other side of Vauxhall Bridge we're in Westminster (Borough) area. It's quite possible we may encounter…\n\nBrixton Town Hall and Stockwell Road are both in South London, and in areas with large black populations. It also mentions Lambeth Road, Vauxhall Bridge and Westminster, which fit, if we move north from Brixton, crossing the Thames at Vauxhall Bridge. What was implied is unclear.\n\nThe beginning and end of the album features a continuity; perhaps the most famous tape loop.\n\n\"Outside The Wall\": \"Isn't this where…\"\n\n\"In The Flesh?\": \"…we came in?\""
