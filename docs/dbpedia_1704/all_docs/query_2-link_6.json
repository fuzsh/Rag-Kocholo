        "text": "Recorded: August 22, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added Aug 23, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 4-track 2d Generation\n\nMono-mixed: 23 Aug 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 13 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – 6-string Fender Bass VI, background vocal\n\nPaul McCartney – lead vocal, lead guitar, piano, drums, background vocal\n\nGeorge Harrison – Fender Jazz bass, background vocal\n\nNotes: This song was written while on Meditation by Paul with help from Mike Love of the Beach Boys. It is a parody of Beach Boys songs such as “Surfin’ USA.” The mention of “Ukraine girls” and “Georgia” was thought by many to be sympathetic to Communism and was denounced. The plane sound effects differ in mono and stereo. Mono has louder piano, a yell after the opening plane sound, and drumbeats under the closing plane sound. Stereo has extra guitar chords at the start of the solo and shouts and piano during the guitar solo.\n\nRecorded: September 11, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added September 12, 13, 16 and October 10, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 8-track\n\nStereo-mixed: 10 Oct 1968\n\nMono-mixed: 10 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – double-tracked lead vocal, acoustic guitar\n\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, piano, flute\n\nGeorge Harrison – lead guitar\n\nRingo Starr – drums, tambourine\n\nSession Musicians – orchestra\n\nNotes: Much like “I Am The Walrus”, “Glass Onion” was written by John as a sort of joke for people who analyzed Beatles songs looking for meanings. The song is filled with nonsense lyrics and wild images. The title “Glass Onion” came from the name that John wanted The Iveys, a new band on the Apple label, to use. They later used “Badfinger”. The stereo version has slightly more treble and fades to a lower volume at the end.\n\nRecorded: July 3, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added July 4-5, 1968, a remake July 8, 1968 and more overdubbing July 11, 1968 and July 15, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 4-track 3d Generation\n\nStereo-mixed: 12 Oct 1968\n\nMono-mixed: 12 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – maraccas, background vocal\n\nPaul McCartney – lead vocal, bass guitar, piano\n\nGeorge Harrison – acoustic guitar, background vocal\n\nRingo Starr – drums\n\nSession Musicians – brass\n\nNotes: The phrase “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” is from the Yoruba tribe (Nigerian) and it means “life goes on”, a phrase used frequently by conga player Jimmy Scott, whom Paul had met. After Paul used the phrase Scott wanted a royalty, however, Paul insisted that it was a common phrase. “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” is cited as the first white reggae; involving Jamaican people and genre. During the recording sessions, the Beatles went through numerous takes with several different sounds until John, who hated the song, to begin with, just went up to the piano and banged out the opening notes, which they kept for the master. Paul wanted to use the song as a single, but when John refused the song was re-recorded by the band Marmalade and became a British hit. A derivative of “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” was used in the theme song to the 1980s television show “Life Goes On”. The stereo version is lacking Paul’s added vocal “oh yeah” at the end of the break. The mono-mix unearthed for “Anthology 3” has various sound effects, of which only the whistle after “fool on the hill” was used in the standard mix. This edit adds the end orchestral piece. The orchestra was added on Oct 10 and used for the standard versions.\n\nRecorded: August 20, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England\n\nMaster tape: 4-track\n\nMono-mixed: 20 Aug 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 13 Oct 1968\n\nPaul McCartney – vocals, bass guitar, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, drums\n\nNotes: “Bungalow Bill” was actually an American named Richard Cooke, III, who had met the Beatles and was on a tiger hunt with his mother three hours away from Rishikesh, where the Beatles were meditating. Cooke shot a tiger on the hunt when it jumped at him and his mother. When she started talking about the kill to the Maharishi and some of his followers, the Maharishi became visibly disturbed. It was then that Cooke began to think that maybe it wasn’t such a good idea. Maharishi asked, “You had the desire Rik and now you no longer have the desire?” to which John asked, “Don’t you call that slightly life destructive?” Cooke replied, “Well, John, it was either the tiger or us. The tiger was jumping right where we were.” Those words became, “If looks could kill it would’ve been us instead of him”. Of the two vocal tracks, one is louder in stereo, the other in mono.\n\nRecorded: July 25, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England, remade August 16, 1968 with overdubs Sept 3, 1968, and remade again September 5, 1968 with overdubs September 6, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 8 track\n\nMono-mixed: 14 Oct 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 14 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon> – acoustic guitar, organ, harmony vocal\n\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, piano, harmony vocal\n\nGeorge Harrison – double-tracked lead vocal, acoustic guitar, lead guitar\n\nRingo Starr – drums, castanets, tambourine\n\nEric Clapton – Gibson Les Paul lead guitar\n\nNotes: George was reading the Chinese book I Ching (the book of changes) when he decided that his songwriting would start to be written based on chance. He took a book off the shelf intending to write a song based on the first words he read, which were “gently weeps”. This is the first 8 track recording (by anyone) at EMI Abbey Road. The Clapton guitar remains loud in mono after the solo break, not in stereo. Near the end of the fadeout, only the stereo has “yeah yeah yeah”, even though it is a few seconds shorter than the mono mix.\n\nRecorded: September 23-24, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added Sept 25, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 8-track 2d Generation\n\nMono-mixed: 26 Sep 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 15 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – lead vocal, lead guitar, tambourine, background vocal\n\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar, background vocal\n\nGeorge Harrison – lead guitar, background vocal\n\nRingo Starr – drums\n\nNotes: The 2d generation master is an edit of (copies of) two takes with more material overdubbed. Mono has tapping (organ) on the beat from the start until the drums come in, but it is soft and mixed out 4 beats earlier in stereo. In the “I need a fix” section in stereo, by error, although the first line was mixed out, the last “down” is just audible. Mono has louder bass in the “I need a fix” section. Mono has laughter near the very end, just before the last drumbeat, not heard in stereo. “No, it’s not about heroin. A gun magazine was sitting there with a smoking gun on the cover and an article that I never read inside called “Happiness Is a Warm Gun.” I took it right from there. I took it as the terrible idea of just having shot some animal…it was at the beginning of my relationship with Yoko and I was very sexually oriented then. When we weren’t in the studio, we were in bed…I call Yoko Mother or Madam just in an offhand way. The rest doesn’t mean anything. It’s just images of her.” – John Lennon, Playboy, 1980\n\nRecorded: June 5, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added June 6, 1968 and July 12, 1968 and an edit piece (tinkling piano intro) recorded July 22, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 4-track 3d Generation\n\nMono-mixed: 11 Oct 1968 edited\n\nStereo-mixed: 11 Oct 1968 edited (Remixed in 1996 for the “Anthology 3″ CD)\n\nJohn Lennon – acoustic guitar, tambourine\n\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar\n\nGeorge Harrison – lead guitar\n\nRingo Starr – lead vocal, drums, piano\n\nJack Fallon – violin\n\nNotes: The Mono version runs faster, and it has more fiddle throughout the song, and different fiddle at the end. The fiddle at the end of stereo seems to a repeat of a bit of the chorus. The edit added the intro.\n\nRecorded: August 13, 1968, at Abbey Road, London, England with overdubs added August 14, 1968, and the ‘counted intro’ added August 20, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 4-track 2d generation\n\nMono-mixed: 14,20 Aug 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 20 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – lead vocal, lead guitar\n\nPaul McCartney – bass guitar\n\nGeorge Harrison – lead guitar\n\nRingo Starr – drums\n\nNotes: The 2d generation tape is an edit of two takes, each of the two tapes being itself a mixdown from the original 4-track. The edit causes an abrupt transition at the end of the guitar solos. In stereo, traces of other vocal and guitar parts can be heard throughout the song in the left channel, including something shouted over parts of the vocal and what sounds like another different guitar solo. After the edit, the trace lead vocal suggests we are hearing the first part of the song from the other take. The edit in the mixes added the countdown intro, which is louder in mono. Mono is also 11 seconds longer, long fade.\n\nRecorded: Sept 9, 1968 at Abbey Road, London, England with an overdub added Sept 10, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 8-track\n\nMono-mixed: 17 Sep 1968\n\nStereo-mixed: 12 Oct 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – bass guitar, lead guitar, saxophone, background vocal\n\nPaul McCartney – lead vocal, bass guitar, lead guitar\n\nGeorge Harrison – rhythm guitar, background vocal\n\nRingo Starr – drums\n\nMal Evans – trumpet\n\nNotes: The basic song runs about 3:10 to a pause shortly after Paul’s distorted vocal, too close to the microphone. Mono then is edited into more of the same take, with sound effects noises, and fades at 3:36. Stereo is edited instead to a different part of the take, fading out and then back in again, with another edit, ending finally at 4:29 after Ringo shouts “I’ve got blisters on my fingers!”.\n\nIs the distorted vocal “Can you hear me speaking– woo!” or “My baby is sleeping, ooh!, dreaming”?\n\nRecorded: May 30, 1968, at Abbey Road, London, England with effects added June 6, 10, 11, 20 and 21, 1968\n\nMaster tape: 4-track\n\nStereo-mixed: 21, 25 Jun 1968\n\nMono-mixed: mono-mixed from the stereo mix in 1968\n\nJohn Lennon – voice, tape loops\n\nPaul McCartney – piano (at the beginning)\n\nGeorge Harrison – voice\n\nRingo Starr – voice\n\nNotes: Tape loops prepared on June 6-11 were fed into the master on Jun 20-25. The basic track was the end of Revolution 1 (see above). Editing shortened the piece by almost a minute. Although the mono was made from the stereo, the opening lines are more clear in mono: “I would’ve gotten claret for you but I’ve realized I’ve forgotten all about it, George, I’m sorry. Will you forgive me?” This is evidently a separate piece of tape added during mixing."
