        "text": "Dear listeners,\n\nIt would be difficult for me to pick a favorite moment on the Pixies’ bizarro 1989 masterpiece “Doolittle” — a consistent favorite album of mine since I first heard it as a 15-year-old who had very recently learned what “Un Chien Andalou” was. But if you insist, I’ll zoom into the album’s dead center, in the middle of Track 7, when the lead singer Black Francis issues a command from the eye of the storm, intoning like his life depended on it, “Rock me, Joe.” On cue, the band’s guitarist Joey Santiago then lets out a brief but thoroughly face-melting solo.\n\nThis is the Pixies’ take on one of my favorite little rock ’n’ roll traditions: A lead singer saying something cool to a guitarist in order to cue up a solo. Today’s playlist is a celebration of this time-honored custom, containing nine variations on this theme."
