The Animal World is a 1956 natural history documentary written, directed, and produced by American filmmaker Irwin Allen. It featured visual effects from stop-motion animation legends Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien.

Overview[]

Although the film tells the story of life on Earth through the majority use of live-action footage, it is most memorable for a 10-minute sequence at the beginning which depicts the age of the dinosaurs. The sequence features both battles between various dinosaurs and a scene where a volcano erupts, drastically affecting the local fauna.

Behind the Scenes[]

The dinosaur sequence was created by special effects pioneers Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien, with the latter designing the set pieces and models, and the former performing the actual animation.

Footage from The Animal World were later incorporated into the 1977 British horror film Trog, as well as an episode of Rod Serling's dark thriller anthology series Night Gallery, while stills from the film have been included in children's View-Master sets for many years.
