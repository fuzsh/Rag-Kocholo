        "text": "''Do you know a good dentist?'' Red Buttons grimaced through his artificial buck teeth as he hopped back to the set. Mr. Buttons plays the White Rabbit in a lavish new television production of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' now being filmed at M-G-M Studios, and he is virtually unrecognizable in his bunny ears, whiskers and puff tail.\n\nMr. Buttons is not the only member of the company affecting a new image. Irwin Allen, the producer once known as the Master of Disaster, seems to be breaking out of that mold. Best-known for producing such disaster films as ''The Poseidon Adventure,'' ''The Towering Inferno,'' and, for television, ''Flood,'' ''Fire'' and ''The Night the Bridge Fell Down,'' Mr. Allen has taken on his first musical fantasy. The $14 million, four- hour mini-series, which combines material from Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Through the Looking-Glass,'' is scheduled to be shown as a special, most likely for Christmas on CBS.\n\nAlthough Carroll's whimsical tale is his first musical fantasy, Mr. Allen said he approached it much like his other films. He assembled the usual ingredients: elaborate special effects, sets and costumes, and an all- star supporting cast. (Forty-two stars will appear in cameo roles.)\n\nA Monster to Terrorize Alice\n\nMr. Allen also suggested that, without knowing it, Lewis Carroll had written the scenario for a disaster movie. ''Fairy tales are the most horrific of all stories,'' Mr. Allen asserted. ''Carroll's book has fire, flood, earthquake, nightmares, goblins, ghosts. It is the kind of story I understand best.'' In the production Mr. Allen has also expanded on Carroll's brief mention of a fire-breathing demon called the Jabberwocky and has built a 12-foot monster to terrorize Alice at regular intervals.\n\nMr. Allen conducted a lengthy search to find his Alice. His first choice for the part was Drew Barrymore, but by the time the film was ready, he explained, ''she had turned into a young lady and was really too big.'' He said he and his casting director interviewed 432 other girls in London, New York and Chicago before finding 9-year-old Natalie Gregory in Orange County, Calif. Carol Channing was picked to play the White Queen.\n\nUnder child labor laws, Miss Gregory is allowed to work only four hours a day, but she works every one of the film's scheduled 60 days of shooting. Robert Morley, who plays the King of Hearts, observed sardonically, ''I think it took tremendous courage to gamble that a 9-year-old girl would be there every day and would not come down with chicken pox.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
