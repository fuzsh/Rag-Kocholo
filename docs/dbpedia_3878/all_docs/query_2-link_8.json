        "text": "Irwin Allen (June 12, 1916 – November 2, 1991) was an American television, documentary and film director and producer with a varied career who became known as the \"Master of Disaster\" for his work in the disaster film genre. He was also notable for creating a number of science fiction television series.\n\nLIFE & CAREER[]\n\nAllen was born in New York City. His film credits include the 3-D film Dangerous Mission (1954), The Animal World (1956), The Story of Mankind (1957), The Big Circus (1959), The Lost World (1960), Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961) (later the basis of his TV series of the same name), and Five Weeks in a Balloon (1962). In the 1970s, he produced popular disaster films including The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974).\n\nIn the 1960s, Allen moved into television as \"the most successful science-fiction producer of the decade\",[2] and was responsible for series such as:\n\n◾Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1964–68)\n\n◾Lost in Space (1965–68)\n\n◾The Time Tunnel (1966–67)\n\n◾Land of the Giants (1968–70)\n\n◾The Swiss Family Robinson (1975–76)\n\n◾Code Red (1981–82).\n\nAllen also produced several TV movies, such as City Beneath the Sea, which recycled many props and models from Voyage, Lost in Space, and Man From The 25th Century. Both were intended as pilots for new TV series projects, but his small-screen success from the 1960s largely eluded him in the 1970s. Allen's science-fiction series had earned a reputation for using nonsensical science and for catering to juvenile audiences.[citation needed] Lost in Space's Bill Mumy said of Allen that, while he was very good at writing television pilots that sold, his unwillingness to spend money hurt his shows' quality once on the air. A monster costume that appeared on one of his shows, for example, would appear on another a few weeks later with new paint.[2] In his book Irwin Allen Television Productions, 1964–1970 (McFarland & Co., 2006), writer Jon Abbott described Allen as paradoxical. \"Here was a man who, when told the cost of a spaceship for a Lost in Space alien, snapped, 'Let him walk!' ... and then let the show be canceled rather than take a cut in the budget.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, Allen returned to cinema screens and was the most popular producer associated with the decade's fad for the disaster film genre. Allen produced the successful The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974), which he also co-directed. He produced several made-for-TV disaster movies: Flood! (1976), Fire! (1977), Hanging by a Thread (1979), The Night the Bridge Fell Down (1979), and Cave-In! (1979). For theatrical release, he produced and directed The Swarm (1978) as well as Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979) and produced When Time Ran Out (1980). Despite this success, the rise of new filmmakers like George Lucas took him off guard; the success of Star Wars reportedly bewildered him at how a film with apparently no stars or love story could enrapture audiences so fervently.\n\nIn the late 1970s and mid-1980s, Allen sporadically returned to TV with miniseries efforts such as The Return of Captain Nemo/The Amazing Captain Nemo (1978) and a star-studded version of Alice in Wonderland (1985). He was planning on making a star-studded musical of Pinocchio, but a decline in health caused retirement in 1986.\n\nAllen died from a heart attack on November 2, 1991.\n\nAwards[]\n\nIn 1952, he won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for The Sea Around Us, which was based on Rachel Carson's best-selling book of the same name. Carson was so disappointed with Allen's final version of the script that she never again sold film rights to her work.[6] Three decades later Allen won the third Worst Career Achievement Golden Raspberry Award (1985).\n\nLEGACY:[]\n\nThe \"Irwin Allen rock-and-roll\" is when the camera is rocked as the on-screen cast rushes from side to side on the set, simulating a ship being tossed around. It is employed in many episodes of Lost in Space and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. This camera technique was employed in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode \"First Spaceship on Venus\". Here the camera tilts to simulate the spacecraft being hit. During this scene, Joel shouts out \"Irwin Allen presents...\".\n\nAllen's career in film and TV was the subject of a 1995 documentary, The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen, produced and directed by Kevin Burns, co-founder of Foxstar Productions, originally set up as the production unit responsible for creating a series of \"Alien Nation\" movies for television. Numerous cast members and associates from various Irwin Allen projects appeared in the film, lending recollections of their time working with him.\n\nIn 1994, while Senior VP of Foxstar, Burns founded Van Ness Films, a non-fiction and documentary production unit. That same year, he met Jon Jashni, a Fox film executive who shared Burns' interest in Allen's works.\n\nIn 1998, the two collaborated on a TV retrospective special, Lost in Space Forever. Hosted by John Laroquette, it chronicled the series' creation and run on TV in the 1960s and beyond, and featured appearances by Bill Mumy, Jonathan Harris, June Lockhart, Angela Cartwright, Mark Goddard and Marta Kristen, as well as film footage of vintage interviews with Guy Williams. Also appearing were Bob May, who donned the Robot suit, and Dick Tufeld, who supplied the character's voice. The flight deck set of the Jupiter 2 spacecraft from the series was recreated as the backdrop for parts of the special.\n\nIt also was used as a vehicle to promote the 1998 Lost in Space movie version of the original television series, starring William Hurt, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, Lacey Chabert, Mimi Rogers and Heather Graham.\n\nBurns and Jashni later formed Synthesis Entertainment and began developing and producing remakes of, and sequels to, several Allen properties, including a 2002 Fox Television pilot for an updated version of The Time Tunnel, which didn't sell, and remakes of films including Poseidon (2006) and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. The 2002 TV pilot was included as a bonus feature on Volume 2 of Fox's 2006 DVD release of the 30-episode Time Tunnel (1966–67) TV series.\n\nPartial filmography[]\n\nYear Film Director Producer Writer Notes 1953 The Sea Around Us Yes Yes Yes Documentary\n\nAcademy Award for Best Documentary Feature\n\n1954 Dangerous Mission Yes 1956 The Animal World Yes Yes Yes Documentary 1957 The Story of Mankind Yes Yes Yes 1960 The Big Circus Yes Yes The Lost World Yes Yes Yes 1961 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea Yes Yes Yes 1962 Five Weeks in a Balloon Yes Yes Yes 1972 The Poseidon Adventure Yes Yes Directed action sequences only\n\nNominated—Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama 1974 The Towering Inferno Yes Nominated—Academy Award for Best Picture 1978 The Swarm Yes Yes 1979 Beyond the Poseidon Adventure Yes Yes 1980 When Time Ran Out Yes 1983 Cave-In! Yes\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nKilldozer's 1989 song \"Man vs. Nature\" referred to Allen, calling him \"the Master of Realism.\" The song's three verses mention three prominent disaster films of the 1970s, including The Poseidon Adventure, Earthquake (which has nothing to do with Allen, in spite of the song's misattribution), and The Towering Inferno.\n\nIn the film Ocean's Thirteen, \"Irwin Allen\" is a nickname for a con where the mark is manipulated by using the threat of a large natural disaster.\n\nOn January 3, 2008, BBC Four showed a night of Allen's work which included the 1995 documentary The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen along with episodes of Lost in Space, Land of the Giants and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.\n\nEpisode 57 of the Disney TV series Duck Tales screened December 8, 1987, titled \"The Uncrashable Hindentanic\" features a character called \"Irwin Mallard\" who films the destruction of Scrooge McDuck's airship called the Hindentanic in the disaster movie style of Irwin Allen.[9]\n\n\"The Irwin Allen Show\" was a skit on SCTV. The Irwin Allen Show was a Johnny Carson-style talk show with Irwin Allen as the host. The guests were stars in Irwin Allen's movies, and they were each individually victims of an Irwin Allen-style disaster while a guest on the talk show (e.g. Red Buttons was attacked by a swarm of bees)\n\nIn Season 1, Episode 18 of the CBS sitcom Alice (\"The Hex,\" first broadcast February 5, 1977), Flo (Polly Holliday) and Alice (Linda Lavin) are discussing Alice's blind date the previous evening. Flo: \"You mean the whole night was a disaster?\" Alice: \"Disaster? Irwin Allen could have made three pictures out of it!\""
