        "text": "This documentary film comprised of stop motion animation of Dinosaurs and film clips of all kinds of animals from all over the world is ahead of its time with the possible exception of Walt Disney who had been making these kinds of films for some time by 1956.\n\nThe Warner Archive restoration is quite impressive with clear vivid imagery and colors. The photography is well done and the shots are quite clear. Compare it to the similar \"Animals Are Beautiful People\" of almost 20 years later where the script is humorous but looking at the blurry action shots in that film for more than 10 minutes at a time will give you a headache and a tremendous case of eyestrain.\n\nThe film begins talking about the evolution of animal life on planet earth, being careful to avoid actually saying the word evolution - this is where the stop motion dinosaur footage comes in. The reason that the film gives for the end of dinosaurs on earth involves a cataclysmic change in the earth's climate of unknown origin rather than the meteor that landed in the Gulf of Mexico as is thought to be the reason for their end today. Then it goes on to discuss the new life that populates the earth afterwards starting from life in the sea to the arrival of man. Again, being a 50's film and still under the production code, you'll see many more Biblical references than you'd find in any modern film on animal life.\n\nNext the film shifts to talking about ecology - how current animal life is in perfect balance and how each animal contributes to the planet's existence. If the film has any fault at all it is this - after talking a bit about ecological balance the film shifts to entertaining and often humorous individual pieces about various animals in action without any kind of overriding narrative. Still, I'd highly recommend it."
