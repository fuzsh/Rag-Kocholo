        "text": "Irwin Allen, producer of big-budget disaster epics including \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Poseidon Adventure,\" died Saturday at the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Malibu.\n\nHe died of a heart attack, said a hospital spokeswoman, Grace Cheng.\n\nMr. Allen, who had been semi-retired for the past year, earned the nickname \"Master of Disaster\" because of his 1970's hits about high-rise fires, sunken cruise ships and killer bees.\n\nHe also wrote, directed or produced hundreds of other films, TV episodes and movies of the week. Documentary to Blockbuster\n\nOne of Mr. Allen's earliest films, an environmental picture called \"The Sea Around Us,\" won the 1952 Academy Award for best documentary feature.\n\n\"The Poseidon Adventure,\" in 1972, won an Academy Award for the song \"The Morning After\" and was nominated for the awards for music, photography and best supporting actress (Shelley Winters).\n\n\"The Towering Inferno,\" in 1974, won Academy Awards for photography and the song \"We May Never Love Like This Again.\" It was nominated for best picture, for John Williams's score and for Fred Astaire's performance in a supporting role.\n\n\"No, I'm not going to run out of disasters,\" Mr. Allen said in a 1977 interview. \"Pick up the daily newspaper, which is my best source for crisis stories, and you'll find 10 or 15 every day.\" A Debt to Human Nature\n\nHe cited human nature for the success of his films. \"People chase fire engines, flock to car crashes,\" he said. \"People thrive on tragedy. It's unfortunate, but in my case, it's fortunate. The bigger the tragedy, the bigger the audience.\"\n\nMr. Allen was also noted for science fiction and fantasy works, like the film and television series \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" and the television series \"Lost in Space,\" \"Time Tunnel\" and \"Land of the Giants.\"\n\nOne of his last works was a non-animated version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" for television.\n\nBorn in New York City, Mr. Allen attended City College of New York and took advertising and journalism classes at Columbia University before the Depression forced him to leave school, said Al Gail, a cousin.\n\nIn the late 1930's, Mr. Allen went to Hollywood to make his fortune. He was a radio news commentator, syndicated newspaper columnist and TV quiz show host before getting into motion pictures.\n\nMr. Allen is survived by his wife, Sheila."
