        "text": "IRWIN ALLEN\n\n(June 12, 1916 Â– November 2, 1991)\n\nToday, November 2nd, marks the anniversary of the death of Irwin Allen, director, writer and producer of such TV landmarks as \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\", \"Lost In Space\", \"Land of the Giants\" and \"The Time Tunnel\" - and who is fondly known to his fans worldwide as \"The Master of Disaster\".\n\nBorn on June 12th, 1916, in New York, NY, Allen was a graduate of New York's Columbia School of Journalism, became a magazine editor, the producer/director of a radio show, talent agent and the owner of an advertising agency before entering film production in the 1950s.\n\nAllen's first taste of celluloid success came in the form of an Oscar for his tyro documentary \"The Sea Around Us\"(1953). His penchant for grandiose subject matter was realized in films such as \"The Animal World\" (1956), \"The Story of Mankind\" (1957), \"The Big Circus\"(1959), and \"The Lost World\" (1960) before he achieved commercial success with \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" (1961), a well-remembered sci- fi extravaganza. Its all-star cast, elaborate special effects, and apocalyptic menace foreshadowed the producer's later works.\n\nHe adapted the film into a weekly TV series that ran from 1964 through 1967; during the same period he also produced \"Lost in Space\", \"The Time Tunnel\" and \"Land of the Giants.\" Returning to feature-film production, Allen hit the box-office jackpot with \"The Poseidon Adventure\" (1972), which singlehandedly spawned the popular disaster genre of the 1970s. His special-effects crews also had a field day with the Oscar-nominated \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), but by the end of the decade, tired rehashes like \"The Swarm\" (1978) and the inevitable \"Beyond the Poseidon Adventure\"(1979) were no longer attracting big audiences. One of Allen's final forays into the disaster genre was appropriately titled \"EB>\" (1980).\n\nAnother of Allen's sci-fi series he produced in the 1960's which a pilot was produced for, but failed to be sold to the studios, was \"The Man From The 25th Century\", starring James Darren.\n\nHis wife, actress Sheila Matthews, had small roles in a number of his films and also on his TV shows, namely \"Lost In Space\" and \"Land of the Giants\".\n\nAllen became famous in Hollywood for quotes such as, \"Me, if I can blow up the world in the first ten seconds, the show is a flop.\"\n\nIrwin Allen passed away in Santa Monica California on November 2nd, 1991 at the age of 75 years old, following a heart attack."
