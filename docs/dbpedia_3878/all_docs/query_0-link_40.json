        "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Funeral services were scheduled Wednesday for movie producer Irwin Allen, whose penchant for big-screen spectacles created a new film genre with such blockbuster disaster films as 'The Poseidon Adventure' and 'The Towering Inferno.'\n\nAllen died Saturday of a heart attack at the age of 75.\n\nHe was brought to Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center at 6:53 a.m. after suffering a heart attack at his Malibu home, hospital spokeswoman Grace Cheng said. The producer died at 7:17 a.m., she said.\n\n'He was one of a kind and he contributed a great deal to the industry with his talents and creativity,' said his wife, Sheila, 'and he will be greatly missed by those who loved him.'\n\nAllen won an Academy Award in 1953 for writing and producing 'The Sea Around Us,' a film based on the non-fiction book by environmentalist Rachel Carson.\n\nAmong the most prolific producer-directors of his era, Allen also was the creator of the the highly popular 1960s fantasy-adventure television series 'Lost in Space' and 'Land of the Giants.'\n\nBut he was best-known for his epic disaster movies. As a film producer, he raided the daily headlines for stories, filming 1970s hits about high-rise fires, sunken cruise ships and other natural and man- made disasters.\n\nAllen produced the high-budget blockbusters 'The Poseidon Adventure' in 1972 and 'The Towering Inferno' in 1974. He was also behind the 1978 adventure 'The Swarm,' a tale of an invasion of killer bees.\n\nHis credits also included the film and telvision series 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.'\n\nBorn June 12, 1916, Allen worked as a magazine editor, radio show director and owned an advertising agency before turning to film production in the early 1950s.\n\nHe initially specialized in quasi-documentaries and nature films, producing, writing and directing 'The Animal World' in 1956 and 'The Story of Mankind' in 1957.\n\nBy the 1960s, Allen had turned his attention to television and science-fiction adventure, creating 'Lost in Space.' The unlikely sitcom about a family sent to the far-ends of the universe accompanied by a friendly robot and a malevolent but bumbling scientist-villan became one of the most popular TV series of all time.\n\nHowever, Allen was best known for creating in the 1970s a new genre in film with the big-budget action-packed disaster movies loaded with innovative special effects and star-studded casts.\n\nHis first disaster adventure was 'The Poseidon Adventure' in 1972, which he produced. He followed up with 'The Towering Inferno' in 1974, which he produced and directed the action sequences. Both films, which were nominated for Academy Awards for their special effects, were among the top grossing films in the 1970s.\n\nHe directed and produced 'The Swarm' in 1974, directed the sequel 'Beyond the Poseidon Adventure' in 1979 and produced 'The Day the World Ended,' also in 1979.\n\nAllen also was known in Hollywood for being a soft-spoken perfectionist who was loyal to his actors. He once told an interviewer: 'I suffer along with them. We have many story conferences. As a writer- director-producer, I have triple agonies. I'm bucking to be known as the most sympathetic producer in town.'\n\nFuneral services were scheduled for Wednesday."
