        "text": "Walt Disney began a series of documentaries that came to be known as the True-Life Adventures in the late 1940s, starting with two-reel Technicolor shorts such as “Seal Island” and “Nature’s Half Acre.” They proved to be quite popular with moviegoers and with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (winning five Oscars), so much so that ***CONJECTURE ALERT*** it’s probable that Irwin Allen, nascent producer, decided to try to cash in with his own Technicolor documentaries about animals, but he’d do Walt Disney one better—he’d make features. But just to hedge his bets and make sure that he was taken seriously, he bought the rights to Rachel Carson’s The Sea Around Us, a popular novel that had been serialized in The New Yorker magazine. He then gathered footage from all over the place, watched it all, sequenced it, wrote narration for it, and pulled it into a feature. The Sea Around Us ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for 1952. Due to its success, ***CONJECTURE ALERT*** Walt Disney decided to start making feature-length True-Life Adventures himself, starting with The Living Desert (which won the Best Documentary Oscar in 1953) and The Vanishing Prairie (which won the same award in 1954).\n\nSince the whole “nature documentary” thing had worked out for him and was working out for Disney, Irwin Allen decided to do a follow-up film, The Animal World. In it, Allen tries to cram pretty much the entirety of the history of life on our planet into an 82-minute run time. He found footage of one-celled animals, and fish, and lions and tigers and bears oh my, but one thing that he (or anyone else on Earth, for that matter) could not obtain was actual footage of live dinosaurs. So, Allen turned to Willis O’Brien, who had brought King Kong to life over two decades earlier, and his young protégé Ray Harryhausen, who went on to make such fantasy classics as Jason and the Argonauts and The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad. Together they crafted several minutes of dinosaur footage, which was the first color stop-motion animation done for a feature film, from what I can gather. The footage consists mostly of dinosaurs eating leaves, dinosaurs fighting, and dinosaurs eating leaves, then fighting (and losing, mostly, to the meat-eating dinosaurs—vegetarians, take note!).\n\nThe Animal World pretty much takes one of two tacks in presenting various animals: it either shows two or more species of animals in some sort of struggle (octopus vs. moray eel, both of whom are run off by a school of fish; ants vs. termites—draw; ferret vs. cobra—match undecided; Ice Age vs. walruses—walruses win; T-rex vs. triceratops vs. volcano—molten lava wins), or it focuses on one type of animal and tells how unusual and/or deadly and/or cute it is. (For the record, baby starfish are super-cute, but you probably wouldn’t want to get a couple dozen of them in your bathing suit—just saying.) Remarkably, the film stays away from showing any real harm coming to any of the animals (with the notable, unfortunate exceptions of showing a whale hunt and a bullfight), unlike most of the National Geographic specials that followed in its wake. I’ve read that Irwin Allen took pains to excise a lot of violence from the footage so that it wouldn’t upset the kids that would undoubtedly be in the audience. Allen even apparently found the dinosaur footage to be too gory, so he cut down on the amount of footage showing those rubber-and-metal puppets leaking red paint.\n\nAlso, it’s taken me over seven years, but I’ve finally figured out why Michael Weldon included Americathon in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film. If you’ll recall from that film’s discussion (and you DO recall that discussion, don’t you?), I wondered whether its inclusion might have been due to John Carradine having shot scenes for the film that were later dropped from the final cut. Well, after watching The Animal World, I have pretty conclusive evidence as to why Americathon is in the book—it features a few seconds of some of the dinosaur footage from The Animal World. Willis O’Brien and Ray Harryhausen—not John Carradine—are why it’s in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia. Just call me Sherlock.\n\nAlthough the film would probably be completely forgotten today if it weren’t for the dinosaur footage (in contrast to its current state of being almost-completely forgotten), it’s a painless way to spend 82 minutes. It’s fast-moving and never boring…but then again, it covers millions of years in under an hour and a half. You can even watch it with the kids—just send them to the kitchen to fetch more snacks during the whale-hunting and bullfighting segments.\n\nAlas and alack, after several entries with loads of links, I can’t find much of anything online for The Animal World. There are some poor-quality videos on YouTube (such as this one) featuring scenes from the film being recorded while it’s playing on a TV, but there’s no full feature or trailer, as far as I can tell. If you’re jonesing to see it, you may just have to do like I did and buy it from the Warner Archive.\n\nUp next: Mum’s the word for depravity!"
