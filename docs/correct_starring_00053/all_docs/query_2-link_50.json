        "text": "Y​ou need to bear in mind here that my favourite genre of movie is romcom. I love Richard Curtis and Danny Boyle plus anything to do with time travel or alternative realities. You all know I Love The Beatles so obviously this film is right up my street. I wont dwell on the basic story, I think we all know it's a Love Story with a twist. Jack Malik doesn't realise that his manager and childhood friend Ellie is in love with him despite the fact that she manages his unsuccessful musical career with great enthusiasm.\n\nA strange worldwide power outage happens simultaneously with a bike accident in which Jack is hit by a bus then when he comes to, gradually realises he's the only person in the world who remembers The Beatles. He begins to play their songs to friends, family, then in pubs. He appears on the local radio station in Lowestoft where he performed In My life. It just so happens that Ed Sheeran is listening, calls him up and asks him to be the support act for his next tour. It's all very far-fetched but really enjoyable. He achieves worldwide fame but is haunted by the fact that he didn't write the songs himself and when he is outed by two mysterious people, one from Liverpool and one from Russia he is almost relieved. It turns out they're Beatles fans too, and like him still remember them and are delighted that he's keeping their music alive. They give him a piece of paper and he sets off on a journey to a secluded seaside home, knocks on the door and comes face to face with 78 year old John Lennon played by Robert Carlyle. This moment in the film is really bittersweet. Little twists of fate in this new universe means John Lennon became a sailor and not a musician. He travels the world , has a happy life and still alive and content in 2018. Alternative John's words of wisdom give Jack a new outlook on life and eventually he comes clean about the music tells Ellie he loves her and like any good Richard Curtis film The all live happily ever after. It wasn't particularly the story I wanted to write about but the little hints throughout. For non Beatles fans it's an enjoyable comedy. Casual Beatle fans will enjoy the music but for Beatle nerds such as many of the people I know you'll enjoy spotting little references and this is my take on some of them.\n\nAfter seeing the movie three times my main observation is that Jack channels Paul McCartney.\n\nThe name Jack is a derivative of both John and James (Paul's first name)\n\nJack's accident is very similar to one Paul had when he came off his moped and broke his front tooth.\n\nAfter Jack is released from hospital and meets his friends on the beach, in the background is a poster welcoming Jack back from the dead maybe a play on the whole Paul is dead thing.\n\nWe also work out that he is 27 years old. 28IF\n\nJack's is actually a teacher as Paul's mother wanted him to be\n\nVery far-fetched but the in very opening scene set on a beach a man dressed as a squirrel runs by. Die hard McCartney fans will know his children's book Wirral the squirrel.\n\nEllie's surname is APPLEton\n\nHis best friend who becomes a Hopeless Road manager is called Rocky (as in Racoon)\n\nIn one of the pub scenes a poster advertises \"George Smith\"\n\nEd Sheeran's tour map highlights Hamburg\n\n​\n\nLove interest is Ellie, as in Eleanor, as in Rigby, her best friend is Lucy as in the Sky\n\nThe American manager is named Deborah HAMMER as in Maxwells Silver\n\nNot really a Beatles reference but the dentist is Mike from The Young Ones...don't think his name is mentioned but I bet its Dr Robert\n\nWhen Jack stares at his reflection in the window it is in half silhouette like With The Beatles album\n\nJack writes all his songs in his attic bedroom just like Paul did at the Ashers home\n\nJack wears at least 3 outfits identical to Paul's\n\nJack's poster/album cover with camera is the same as Paul's selfie\n\nJohn's boat is named \"Imagin\"\n\nKids play on a Helter Skelter\n\nJack and Ellie get married at St Peters Church Woolton where John met Paul, and Kip, the real life vicar is filmed writing a sermon and darning his socks there.\n\nmore to be added...and please comment to add your own\n\n​will also do a blog with Liverpool film locations"
