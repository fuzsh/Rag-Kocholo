        "text": "THE FOLLOWING EVENTS TOOK PLACE ON APRIL 13\n\n1933--Lord Clydesdale makes the first flight over Mount Everest.\n\n1961--The Beatles perform at the Top Ten Club, Reeperbahn, Hamburg, West Germany.\n\n1962--The Beatles begin a seven-week stint at the Star-Club, Hamburg, West Germany. They were required to perform for four hours one night and for three hours the next, alternating back and forth (performing in shifts of one hour on, one hour off). From April 13 through May 31 they had only one night off (April 20, Good Friday). Over a period of 48 nights, they log 172 hours on stage. For two weeks The Beatles shared the bill with Gene Vincent.\n\n1962--The late Stu Sutcliffe's mother arrives in Hamburg to identify her son's body and make arrangements to have it returned to Liverpool for burial.\n\n1963--The Beatles record their first television appearance on the national BBC network, on the TV program \"The 625 Show.\" Recording for the program is in Studio E of Lime Grove Studios, Lime Grove, Shepherd's Bush, London. The Beatles perform three songs: From Me to You, Thank You Girl, and Please Please Me. This recording session prevents The Beatles from making an advertised personal appearance (not performing, just \"showing up\") at a dance in Lancashire. Since they are in London, The Beatles go to a party hosted by Shadows guitarist Bruce Welch, where they meet Cliff Richard.\n\n1964--Filming for \"A Hard Day's Night\" continues, this day with only George Harrison and John Lennon. In the morning, George's solo sequence is filmed, the part where George finds himself with the marketing boss of a clothing company and calls their shirts \"grotty\" and their teen TV star \"a drag.\" In the afternoon, George and John film the \"bathroom\" scene, where John is in the tub playing with toy submarines, singing \"Rule Britannia,\" and then appears to disappear down the drain. Roy Orbison, with whom The Beatles had toured, stops by the film set to say hello.\n\n1964--The title of the new film, A Hard Day's Night, is announced to the press. It comes from a phrase that Ringo Starr used that was based on some wordplay from one of John Lennons short stories. John and Paul then had the job of writing the title song, which they undertook individually and in competition with each other. John won the contest, as A Hard Days Night turned out to be a Lennon song. In fact, the soundtrack for the film was dominated by Johns songs, the most of any Beatles album.\n\n1964--US gold certification is given to The Beatles' Second Album.\n\n1964--Brian Epsteins newly commissioned autobiography is in need of a title, and according to legend, John Lennon cruely suggests Queer Jew. It has also been said that Epstein admits during the ghostwriting of the book, that he had an affair with Lennon, although, of course, no mention of this appeared in the finished text.\n\n1965--The Beatles complete filming for the \"Relativity Cadenza\" scene for their movie \"Help!\"\n\n1965--The Beatles in the recording studio (Studio Two, EMI Studios, London). Having completed a day of filming at Twickenham Film Studios, The Beatles begin the recording of John Lennon's song Help!, the title track for The Beatles' movie-in-progress and the next Beatles album and single. Recorded from beginning to completion in one session (7:00 p.m. to 11:15 p.m.), taping 12 takes and numerous overdubs. John would later refer to Help! as one of the first songs he wrote dealing with his personal feelings. The Help! single would be released on July 23, the album on August 6.\n\n1965--Winners of the seventh annual Grammy Awards are announced. Record of the Year is The Girl from Ipanema by Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto. The Beatles win Best Performance by a Vocal Group for A Hard Days Night and the group is voted Best New Artists.\n\n1966--The Beatles in the recording studio (Studio Three, EMI Studios, London). The Beatles complete the song Love You To, then set about recording their next single. Two takes of the rhythm track for Paperback Writer are recorded, the second take being selected as the basic track to which overdubs will be added later.\n\n1969--An article accusing Allen Klein of illegal activities is published in the Sunday Times Insight column.\n\n1974--Jane Asher, Paul McCartneys former girlfriend, gives birth to a baby girl at the Middlesex Hospital in London.\n\n1980--John Lennon and his personal assistant, Fred Seaman, drive out on Route 110 (on Long Island) to buy Yoko Ono some flowers. During this trip, John hears Paul McCartney's song, Coming Up, for the first time on the car radio.\n\n1987--UK re-release of John Lennon's posthumous album Menlove Avenue on CD (EMI). Same track listing as the vinyl LP.\n\n1999--Fred Seaman, former assistant to John Lennon, is sued by Yoko Ono and Capitol Records over personal effects of the late artist. The suit claims that Seaman launched \"an elaborate scheme\" to \"exploit Lennon's death by stealing priceless personal and sentimental items.\"\n\n2000--Heather Mills wins $316,700 in damages for a 1993 accident that involved a British motorcycle officer. Mills, Paul McCartneys girlfriend, receives the out-of-court-settlement without any admission of guilt for the loss of her left leg.\n\nFor more day-by-day history go to HistoryUnlimited.net"
