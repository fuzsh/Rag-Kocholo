        "text": "John Lennon’s first wife, Cynthia Lennon, passed away in Mallorca, Spain after a short battle with cancer on April 1, 2015. She was 75 years old.\n\n*\n\nNow six years after her death, a short independent film called Cyn has been made. The film is based on her second book about John Lennon called John. The film will cover the period of their relationship when they were both art students in Liverpool in 1960.\n\nCynthia met John Lennon at the Liverpool College of Art in 1958 and they soon began dating. She wrote about their relationship in her book, A Twist of Lennon (1978). She shared intimate details of their time together:\n\n*\n\n“John and I in those early days would just sit opposite each other, hold each other’s hands under the formica table and gaze avidly into each other’s moon-struck eyes,” Cynthia said.\n\nA love letter from John to Cynthia was published in the recent book, The John Lennon Letters. John wrote an 8-page letter to Cynthia at Christmastime in 1958. He was 18 years old and gushing over and over of how much he loved her:\n\n*\n\n“You are wonderful, I adore you, I want you, I love you, I need you, Don’t go, I love you, Happy Xmas, Merry Chrimbo, I love you, I love you, I love you, Cynthia… All I Want For Christmas Is You, Cyn”.\n\n*\n\nA few years later as John was concentrating on his career as a Beatle, he and Cynthia decided to get married when they learned she was pregnant in 1962.\n\n*\n\nJulian Lennon was born on April 8, 1963. The demands of touring during Beatlemania and the temptations from other women resulted in their marriage becoming strained.\n\n*\n\nIn 1968, Cynthia caught John and Yoko together at the house she shared with John. The subsequent split took a toll on the Beatle family with Paul McCartney writing a song of support and encouragement for Julian called “Hey Jude.” John and Cynthia’s divorce became final in November 1968.\n\n*\n\n*\n\nIn 2005, Cynthia published another book about Lennon called John.\n\nShe talked about her marriage to Lennon in this interview promoting the book:\n\n*\n\n*\n\nAfter Cynthia died, Julian Lennon posted a touching tribute for his mother on YouTube:\n\n*\n\n*\n\n“The news of Cynthia’s passing is very sad. She was a lovely lady who I’ve known since our early days together in Liverpool. She was a good mother to Julian and will be missed by us all, but I will always have great memories of our times together.”\n\n– Paul McCartney\n\n*\n\nThe short film Cyn will be shown at film festivals in 2021.
