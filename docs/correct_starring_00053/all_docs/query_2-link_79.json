        "text": "The Beatles: Get Back\n\nTime-Coded and Annotated\n\n.\n\nSome of the characters beyond the Fab Five:\n\n(And yes, it’s five — because in this doc The Beatles become a quintet. 😉)\n\nPeter Jackson — the cinematic master behind this entire production\n\nJabez Olssen — Peter Jackson’s super-skilled right-hand-man editor – never seen on screen, but is a part of every second of footage\n\nGeorge Martin — The Beatles’ Music Producer, one of a handful cited as being “the fifth Beatle,” dapper, suave, smart and cool\n\nMichael Lindsay-Hogg — original 1969 Director – directed The Rolling Stones Rock n Roll Circus the month before, and The Beatles’ Hey Jude and Revolution videos at Twickenham four months earlier – hereinafter referred to as MLH\n\nTony Richmond — original 1969 Director of Photography – also the D.P. on The Rolling Stones Rock n Roll Circus the month before – with the mustache, looks like Freddie Prinze\n\nGlyn Johns — Recording Engineer & Co-Producer – looks like Nicky Hopkins – dresses like Austin Powers (as Peter Jackson joked). The New York Times even did a funny–cool piece about it.\n\nAlan Parsons — credited as Tape Operator (was only at Savile Row, not Twickenham). Seven years after the events of this movie he would go on to write & produce one of the great albums of all time, Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Edgar Allen Poe) which you can hear in its entirety here.\n\nDenis O’Dell — Apple Films Producer – associate producer of A Hard Day’s Night, producer of Magical Mystery Tour, and was producing The Magic Christian with Peter Sellers and Ringo as Get Back gets started — looks like Milos Forman\n\nMal Evans — beloved Road Manager & Assistant to The Beatles – been with them since the Cavern days\n\nKevin Harrington — Beatles Roadie – the ginger-haired kid – looks like Ed Sheeran\n\nNeil Aspinall — Producer / Apple Corps Managing Director – childhood friend of Paul & George, started out as the band’s van driver back in the Pete Best days\n\nPeter Brown — the band’s quasi manager after Brian Epstein died – started as a salesman at Epstein’s NEMS music store in Liverpool\n\nDerek Taylor — The Beatles’ Publicist – originally a journalist, Epstein hired him to work for the band full-time in early 1964\n\nEthan Russell — 23-year-old still photographer in the sessions – had shot the Stones’ Rock n Roll Circus the month before – his portraits of the band members are on the Let It Be album cover – cool short 2020 interview with him here.\n\nChris O’Dell — American-born Apple employee, roof concert guest, rock n roll adventurer, author of a great memoir, and a YouTube storyteller. (No relation to Denis)\n\nRobert Fraser — nicknamed “Groovy Bob” by Terry Southern, he was a leading “Swinging London” art dealer and all ’round bon vivant who put on John’s first Yoko-inspired avant garde art show “You Are Here” at his gallery in July of ’68.\n\nLes Parrott — Camera Operator\n\nPeter Sutton — Sound Recordist 🙂\n\nPaul Bond — Clapper Boy and Additional Camera\n\nDave Harries — Apple Sound Engineer\n\nSally Burgess — from the Apple Press Office, short red-ish haired woman with the big glasses at Savile Row\n\nDebbie Wellum — Apple Receptionist and unsung hero for delaying the cops in the lobby\n\nJimmy Clark — Dapper Doorman\n\nBob Smeaton — thanked in credits — Anthology & Festival Express director\n\n=========================\n\nThe must-see nearly 4-hour Peter Jackson interview:\n\n=========================\n\nThe songs that seem to be directly (or subconsciously) about where the band is at and where they’re heading —\n\n– All Things Must Pass (January 3rd)\n\n– Two Of Us (On Our Way Home) (January 6th)\n\n– Get Back (January 7th)\n\n– Carry That Weight (a long time) (January 9th)\n\n– Let It Be (January 9th)\n\n– Bye Bye Love (Everly Brothers song) (January 25th)\n\n==========================\n\nThe credits run 6½ minutes at the end of each episode. In episode 3, they run concurrent with footage. But in episodes 1 & 2 they run with a black screen — so you can knock 13 minutes off the total run time of 468 minutes = 455 minutes = a 7½ hour documentary.\n\n==========================\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO TURN ON THE CLOSED CAPTIONING — VIA LITTLE BOX IN EXTREME UPPER RIGHT OF DISNEY SCREEN.\n\nEPISODE ONE — Days 1 thru 7 — January 2nd thru 10th, 1969\n\n2 hours & 30 mins (plus 6:50 minutes of credits)\n\nWriting / Rehearsals at Twickenham\n\nThe opening title cards that appear before each episode:\n\n“The ‘Get Back’ project in January 1969 produced over 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio recordings.”\n\n“Numerous editorial choices had to be made during the production of these films.”\n\n“Scenes that contain audio-only material have been supplemented with representative pictures.”\n\n“At all times, the film-makers have attempted to present an accurate portrait of the events depicted and the people involved.”\n\n0:40 – 11:00 — starts with an 11-minute recap of their career.\n\nOpens with audio of The Quarrymen singing the early McCartney/Harrison original In Spite of All The Danger — set to historical footage of Liverpool in the late 1950s.\n\nOther than the minor date / age errors, this is a good basic quick Beatles history narrative set-up to how we got to the sessions and film we’re about to see.\n\nPeter Jackson is a *great* cinematic storyteller.\n\n11:00 — DAY ONE — Thursday, January 2nd, 1969\n\nOf note — the band was last in the recording studio October 17th, 1968 — only 2½ months earlier — finishing recording The White Album.\n\nGreat use of the calendar to show the days — a smart / easy-to-follow story structure.\n\nLove that Mal Evans is the first person we meet as the January journey begins.\n\n11:30 — On The Road To Marrakesh/Child of Nature (later to be Jealous Guy) — John’s singing voice begins the story, just as it did the band.\n\nIt’s so cool to see the Twickenham soundstage completely empty, then begin to get filled in.\n\nBoy — is the editing ever good right outta the gate!! Gawd — this is GREAT filmmaking!\n\nAnd the pictures are so sharp! Wow.\n\n12:05 — George correctly asks, “Where’s the console? The mixer and the 8-tracks and all them.” 🙂\n\n12:15 — John leading George & Ringo through a part of Everybody’s Got Soul – a Lennon song that never got finished.\n\nPeter Jackson’s doing a *great* job with the title cards explaining what’s happening and why. The band must write, perform and record 14 new songs in the next two weeks. (!)\n\n12:35 — Don’t Let Me Down — new John song — first early run-thru.\n\n13:15 — George correctly points out “I don’t think this is a very acoustically good place.”\n\n13:35 — Co-producers of the album Glyn Johns & George Martin first appear.\n\n13:55 — MLH asks the band to turn down their amps because it’s drowning out their conversations, and George asks, “Are you recording our conversations?” 😄\n\n14:20 — I’ve Got A Feeling — Paul teaching it to the band.\n\nJohn & Paul sitting side by side and having fun.\n\nGreat camerawork and editing!\n\n16:20 — the first meeting off to the side. Paul is the only bandmember in it! George Martin mentions how Twickenham is not good acoustically. He wants to do something with a PA, like doing a live performance, because it will “trigger” something. Film Producer Denis O’Dell is in on the conversation, explaining how he’s leased Twickenham until the end of May to film The Magic Christian (with Peter Sellers & Ringo Starr). MLH wants a “spectacular” venue for the performance climax.\n\n17:25 — Johnny B. Goode bit\n\n17:35 — Quinn the Eskimo bit\n\n17:44 — I Shall Be Released bit\n\n18:00 — Yoko in the shiny black (satin?) body suit.\n\n18:30 — Don’t Let Me Down — Paul helping John write it — they’re obviously a team … and writing together.\n\n19:40 — Paul, Glyn, MLH discussing where to play a concert. MLH pushing for the amphitheater in Libya — but Ringo “put his foot down” that he’s not traveling.\n\nPaul to MLH: “I think you’ll find we’re not going abroad.” 😆\n\n21:25 — Two of Us (On Our Way Home) — Paul teaching it to the band, working out lyrics.\n\n23:30 — DAY TWO — Friday, January 3rd\n\n23:35 — Paul on grand piano, Ringo tap dancing.\n\n23:40 — Great shot of the colored lights being turned on, creating the beautiful wash on the floor-to-ceiling scrim behind the band.\n\n23:47 — George reading the latest Beatle fanzine — including about Paul visiting official Beatles biographer Hunter Davies in Portugal.\n\n24:30 — George talking about all the songs he’s written – “and they’re all slowish.”\n\n24:45 — Taking a Trip to Carolina — by Ringo! Then he sings it while playing the grand piano.\n\n25:50 — Paul & George talking about getting 8-track recording equipment and how EMI should be taking care of it.\n\n26:30 — Paul says there are about 100 songs John & he wrote together in the early days that they never recorded.\n\n26:40 — Just Fun (Lennon/McCartney)\n\n26:55 — Because I Know You Love Me So (Lennon/McCartney)\n\n27:40 — Thinking of Linking (Lennon/McCartney)\n\n27:55 — Won’t You Please Say Goodbye (Lennon/McCartney)\n\n28:15 — One After 909 (Lennon/McCartney) – old song that they loved – laughing and having a great time\n\nCool early B&W photos and young John & Paul playing together.\n\n30:00 — goofing on Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da. (Lennon/McCartney)\n\n30:20 — Midnight Special (traditional, Leadbelly)\n\n30:35 — What Do You Want To Make Those Eyes At Me For? (written by Howard Johnson, James V. Monaco, and Joseph McCarthy in 1916, a hit for Emile Ford & the Checkmates in 1959)\n\n30:50 — The Harry Lime Theme aka The Third Man Theme (instrumental, by Anton Karas, 1949 film score)\n\n31:45 — George gets shocked by microphone.\n\n32:30 — working on I’ve Got A Feeling – writing the lyrics / coming up with arrangement.\n\n34:00 — Mal keeping track of the lyrics with pen and paper. 💖\n\n34:45 — They ask Mal to time Don’t Let Me Down cuz John thinks “it’s only about ‘alf a minute long” 🙂 — turns out to be 3 minutes 40 seconds! 😁\n\n34:55 — Don’t Let Me Down – partial\n\n35:35 — Gimme Some Truth !! — jointly composed by John & Paul; would later appear on Imagine as a John song.\n\n37:05 — Lowrey organ carried in.\n\n37:30 — All Things Must Pass — first time playing for band – John on Lowrey organ.\n\nLike Paul’s Get Back — another song that seems subconsciously (or consciously) about where the band is at and going.\n\nThey are all jointly composing/arranging the song.\n\nReally shows yet again their collaborative process.\n\n40:00 — Somebody asks if they want pale ales.\n\nPaul gets a pale ale.\n\nGeorge — white wine.\n\nJohn — “I’ll have a beer.”\n\nRingo nothing.\n\n40:00 — George advocates for their live recording approach as opposed to the overdubs of The White Album etc.\n\nHe also talks about maybe including “some oldies but goldies” in the TV show so the audience can recognize something – but then says it would be okay if the show aired a week after the album was released. So funny how they just take as a fact of life that their fans would know the songs a week after their album was released. 😮\n\nPaul looks high. 😎\n\n41:25 — George recommends bringing back Every Little Thing (Lennon/McCartney) from their 1964 Beatles For Sale album.\n\n41:55 — George talking favorably about Clapton’s leads and improvising, and how George isn’t as good at that.\n\n42:25 — Paul: “It’s jazz, man.”\n\n42:45 — George mentions Ray Charles and Billy Preston! “The best jazz band I saw was Ray Charles’ band. That jazz really moves me in a fantastic way. Billy Preston is too much! I’m sure you’ll dig it when you see it. Billy plays piano with the band. Then he does his own spot where he sings and dances and plays organ solo. Then Ray Charles comes on. He’s better than Ray Charles, really, because he’s, like, too much! Because he plays organ so great. Ray Charles doesn’t bother with the organ now. He’s just, ‘I’ll leave it to the young guy.'”\n\nThe show he’s referring to having seen was the Saturday Sept. 21st 1968 Ray Charles show at the Royal Festival Hall in London, three months prior, which he says in the Anthology book (p. 318) that he attended with Eric Clapton. It has mistakenly entered Beatles lore that George saw Ray (and Billy) during the week he left the band later this month (and then invited Billy to the studio), but that’s not accurate. He saw them in Sept. ’68. And he’s talking about having seen them on January 3rd, before he took his break from the band a week later.\n\n43:22 — I’m So Tired — Paul has red eyes like he just stepped out for a spliff. 🤪\n\nGreat eye-rubbing “tired” footage. 👍 This is the end of their second day back working together after 2½ months.\n\nOf most interesting note: also on this day but not included in the doc was a conversation where George tells Paul about seeing Beat poet Michael McClure’s play The Beard, prompting me to explore that beatific Beat–Beatles confluence and uncover a ton of cool new stuff about that connection that you can read here. 😉\n\n44:30 — DAY 3 — Monday, January 6th\n\n44:30 — Glyn & Paul talking about getting George’s and EMI’s recording equipment into Twickenham. (MLH & Tony Richmond also present.)\n\nGlyn stressing that this filmed show be approached as a live performance.\n\n45:00 — Ringo arrives hungover hazy. “I won’t lie. I’m not too good.” 😁\n\n45:10 — MLH pestering that they should be thinking about the show. Paul responds, “But we are thinking about the show.” 😁 And John goes, “We never stop thinking about it.” 😁\n\nThe band are just waking up, just coming to, and again MLH goes on about it — “Wouldn’t it be nice if we did this show with a big audience?”\n\nGeorge responds: “I think we should forget the whole idea of the show.” 😆\n\nPaul goes: “Yeah, okay, I’ll go along with that. We’re back to square one.”\n\nMLH is SO painfully out of synch with the band (and Glyn).\n\n45:35 — George’s 8-track arrives.\n\n45:55 — Great edit — George H asks, “Is [Magic] Alex going to plug all that up?” And Peter Jackson cuts to George Martin, who gives a classy knowing “Yeah, right” smirk. 😄 Then George M goes on to say that Alex rang him up yesterday and said the band didn’t need an 8-track because Alex was going to build one. (!)\n\nI only know George Martin from various interviews over the decades, but I gotta imagine the lads could read instantly how seriously George Martin took Magic Alex. 🙂\n\n46:00 — Magic Alex footage — he first met John — who made the mistake of trusting/believing in him — like he would soon do with Allen Klein and Phil Spector. 😥\n\n46:50 — You Wear Your Women Out (writing credit to all four)\n\n47:05 — My Imagination — also credited as group-composed – short high-energy jam – nice surreal camerawork / editing.\n\n47:25–56:00 — group writing Don’t Let Me Down\n\n47:25 — Paul, John & George working on the lyrics / arrangement.\n\n48:25 — They start talking about needing a piano player. John: “We need a guy that plays piano all the time.” Paul: “Somebody like Nicky Hopkins.”\n\n49:00 — John mentions “watching that pop show on BBC2. The Move were on.” (Roy Wood’s band) He mentions how their voices were different and “they never joined into a group.”\n\nPaul is very much leading the working out of the arrangement.\n\n50:56 — Hare Krishna guys in Twickenham.\n\n52:35 — Love to see the boys using pens on paper writing the lyrics. 🥰\n\nIt’s very much the three of them — Paul, John & George — who are more or less equally batting around ideas.\n\n53:25 — producer Glyn Johns sits among them also throwing in ideas.\n\nThis is something about The Beatles — that from the very beginning they were open to collaborating — from following Brian Epstein’s advice, to embracing George Martin, to the carte blanche they gave Richard Lester, and all down the line through photographers and tailors and art designers — they were very open to incorporating other artists’ input. 😉\n\n54:24 — Paul counts in John’s song — like John later counts in Paul’s.\n\n55:05 — George says that what they’ve come up with is corny. “I think it’s awful . . . If you had a tape recorder now and recorded that and played it back you’d throw that out straightaway.” 😆\n\nEven though they’re not solidifying the magic at the moment — it’s clear they are three equals working together. (With, of course, Ringo laying down exactly the right backing for what the three frontmen come up with.)\n\n56:15–1:02:14 — group writing Two Of Us\n\nAgain, it’s the three of them bouncing off each other. Paul is definitely in a bit of a quasi-leadership role.\n\n57:30 — The beginning of the “I’ll play whatever pleases you” scene —\n\nSeeing the full lead-in and lead-out from that, unlike in MLH’s Let It Be — you now see it in context.\n\n57:48 — Paul gets up and takes his guitar off. “I can’t do this on camera.”\n\n58:00 — Paul: “I’m scared of me being the boss. And I have been for, like, a couple of years.” Paul to George: “I always feel as though I’m trying to put you down and stop you playing. But I’m not. I’m trying to stop us all playing until we know what we’re playing.”\n\n58:10 — George: “But you’ve got to play in order to find which fits and which doesn’t. That’s all we can do.”\n\n58:40 — Paul: “But doesn’t everyone agree that it’s confused at the moment. So, all I’m trying to say is we’ve only got 12 more days, so we’ve really got to do this methodically.”\n\nGeorge: “I’ll wait until you get all your bits and then work my part out if you like. It’s a matter of working it out with you while you’re working your bit out. You know, have you got your bass bit?”\n\nPaul gets defensive or is frustrated. “I’m not trying to get to you. I really am trying to just say, ‘Look lads, the band, shall we try it like this, you know?’ It’s funny though how it only occurs when the — it’s like, ‘Shall we play guitar all through Hey Jude?’ Well, I don’t think we should.”\n\nGeorge: “Yeah, okay, well, I don’t mind. I’ll play, you know, whatever you want me to play. Or I won’t play at all if you don’t want me to play. Now, whatever it is that will please you, I’ll do it. (pause all around) But I don’t think you really know what that one is.”\n\nAnd that’s the whole thing . . . that has been twisted out of context and blown out of proportion for all these decades.\n\nGeorge is being totally cool and is not annoyed. They’re just working it out.\n\nIt’s almost exactly like the conversation they were having minutes earlier about Don’t Let Me Down.\n\nThis is a TOTALLY normal conversation between guys in a band sitting around jamming ideas on a song.\n\nEven right after this mistaken-for-tense moment, they’re all just carrying on a normal conversation between bandmates.\n\nEven Two Of Us (On Our Way Home) is like a song written to and about the band. (I know it was inspired by he & Linda — but art is filled with creators tapping one vein that echoes another. 😉)\n\nAll Things Must Pass . . . On Our Way Home . . . Get Back . . . all songs addressing where they are as a band and where they’d like to be heading — subconsciously or consciously. Wild.\n\n1:02:30 — DAY 4 — Tuesday, January 7th\n\n1:02:35 — Paul, joking: “Lennon’s late again. Thinking of getting rid of him.” 😁\n\n1:02:48 — George, joking: “You’re playing that bass again,” referring to Paul strapping on his classic Hofner.\n\n1:02:55 — Paul & George asking soundman Peter for better mics.\n\n* * 1:03:10–1:06:40 — Paul starts writing Get Back * * — in a way the song is a hymnal entreaty to the band “to get back to where they once belonged.”\n\nRingo listening intently.\n\nGeorge starts playing along — Ringo starts clapping a beat, then singing harmony!\n\n1:06:15 — Ringo moves to the drums.\n\n1:06:40 — suddenly Lennon’s there on guitar.\n\n1:06:55 — four bandmates & MLH & Glyn Johns talking about the show / concert.\n\nMLH says Denis O’Dell suggested doing it there at Twickenham, but MLH wants to do it somewhere better. “Because you are The Beatles.” . . .\n\nPaul: “The only thing about that is, we don’t want to go away.”\n\nThen MLH goes on about it AGAIN! “Think of the lights on the water. Torch-lit. 2,000 Arabs. Visually it’s fantastic.” 🙂\n\nPaul says again: “But we’re not going away.”\n\nThen MLH goes at it AGAIN: “I will every day say Tripoli.”\n\nThen Paul says: “We should do the show in a place where we’re not allowed to do it. You know, like, we should trespass, go in, set up, and then get moved, and that should be the show.”\n\n1:07:46 — Then he jokes about playing in the main gallery at the Houses of Parliament “and getting forcibly ejected, still trying to play numbers, and the police lifting you,” then mimics getting dragged away singing She Came In Through The Bathroom Window. 🤣\n\nThen MLH becomes a full-on Monty Python character saying, “What about a hospital? But I don’t mean for really sick kids. I mean for kids with broken legs. . . . Or maybe an orphan’s home. What about an orphanage? How does that grab you guys?” 😳\n\nSome say John seems detached. Maybe he’s high, but I see him as simply listening and thinking.\n\n1:09:23 — John: “I’ve decided the whole point of it is communication. And to be on TV is communication. We’ve got a chance to smile at people, like All You Need Is Love. So that’s my incentive for doing it.”\n\nJohn: “The worst that we have is a documentary of us making an LP.”\n\nThe break-up conversation:\n\nPaul: “But we haven’t played together, you see. That’s the fucking thing. But when we do come together to play together, we all just sort of talk about the fucking past! We’re like old age pensioners. ‘Remember the days when we used to rock?’ 😅 But we’re here now, and we can do it, you know? But all I want to see is enthusiasm. See, the thing is also – I get to a bit where I just sort of push all my ideas.”\n\nGeorge: “A lot will come out of it if we could get the enthusiasm.”\n\nPaul: “I mean, why are you here? I’m here because I wanna do a show. But I really don’t feel an awful lot of support.”\n\nGeorge: “We keep coming up against that one, and I keep saying, ‘Yeah well, I’d like to do this, this and that.’ And we end up doing something again that nobody really wants to do.”\n\n* 1:10:35 — Paul: “If this one turns into that, it should definitely be the last for all of us.” (!) “Because there just isn’t any point. It’s stupid. It’s just stupid. The people who are being stupid are the four of us.”\n\n* 1:11:00 — George: “We need to be creative, instead of being in the doldrums, which it always is. The Beatles have been in the doldrums for at least a year. Ever since Mr. Epstein passed away, it’s never been the same.”\n\n[As confirmed in this doc, and also from doing a deep dive into other sources, it was really the unfortunate death of “Mr. Epstein” that started an inevitable domino tumble towards dissolution.]\n\nPaul: “We’ve been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away. And that’s why all of us, in turn, have been sick of the group. It’s discipline we lack. We’ve never had discipline. We had a sort of slight, symbolic discipline. Like Mr. Epstein. You know, and he sort of said, ‘Get suits on,’ and we did. We were always fighting that discipline a bit. (everybody laughs) There really is no one now to say, ‘Do it,’ whereas there always used to be. Daddy’s gone away now, and we’re on our own at the holiday camp. And I think we either go home or we do it. I think we’ve got a bit shy of certain things. I think I’ve gotten a bit shy of certain things. Cuz you know how often, like, on albums we sometimes blow one of your songs [to John] cuz we come in in the wrong mood. And you say, ‘This is how it goes. I’ll be back.’ And we’re all just, ‘Oh, well you … (scat sings)’ So it’s like, if we’re doing the show, then we’re gonna have to work hard. And that means by the time a week from now comes all these songs we’ve got, we gotta know perfectly.”\n\nGeorge: “I don’t wanna do any of my songs on the show (!) because they’ll just turn out shitty.”\n\nPaul: “No, but — thinking it’s not gonna come out great won’t help. If we cancel the show now, we’ll be throwing it away.”\n\nMLH: “But equally, at the moment we haven’t got a show, and so none of us really want to do it.”\n\n* 1:12:35 Paul: “I’ll do it. I’m not interested in spending my fucking days farting around here while everyone makes up their minds whether they want to do it or not. It’s like Mal said last night, ‘If you’re gonna do the show here, you’ve gotta decide today.’ And as far as I can see, there’s only two ways — we’re gonna do it, or we’re not gonna do it. And I want a decision!”\n\n* 1:12:57 — George: “Maybe we should have a divorce.”\n\nPaul: “I said that at the last meeting. But it’s getting nearer, you know.”\n\nJohn: “Who’d have the children?” 🤣 the guy who adds levity to the heavy.\n\nPaul: “Dick James.” 😥 (the guy who’s ripping them off for their royalties)\n\nMLH: “We all need you. And if you can’t get it together, that’s really very sad. I think what we should do now is let you play a little.”\n\nAll agree.\n\n1:13:50–1:17:30 — Maxwell’s Silver Hammer — Paul on grand piano, very upbeat, teaching the song to and working it up with band.\n\nGeorge on the Fender Bass VI.\n\nWhistling – and tongue clucking.\n\nThey’re all very chipper and goofing shortly after their heavy conversation about the band breaking up.\n\n1:15:00 — band goes to lunch (in the Twickenham cafeteria)\n\nPaul says as he’s walking out: “Mal – we should get a hammer. . . . And an anvil.” 😂\n\nMal looks around, like “Huh? . . . Me? . . . . . . An anvil? . . .” 😄\n\n1:15:20 — Mal on the anvil (!) HUGE smile on his face 😍\n\n1:15:35 — full band whistling 😀\n\nFull run-thru of song.\n\n1:17:30–1:20:05 — Across the Universe – playing John’s recording (apparently on an acetate lp!) to teach the band — then the band plays it.\n\nApple’s Peter Brown seen in background.\n\n1:18:01 — band starts to play Across The Universe\n\n* 1:20:05 — Rock and Roll Music by Chuck Berry — Peter Jackson incorporates live Beatles 1966 concert footage — blending with the Twickenham performance! — incredible editing!!!\n\nThis is a hit video single from the movie. 😉\n\n1:22:00 — DAY 5 – Wednesday, January 8th\n\n1:22:10 — George talks about what he watched on BBC2 last night (Out of The Unknown) and then the show Europa that then inspired him to write I Me Mine.\n\nGreat find by Peter Jackson of the printed TV listings for that night.\n\n1:23:30 — I Me Mine — “Do you want to hear the song I wrote last night” 🙂 — George plays it solo on guitar.\n\n1:25:00 — John’s unfortunate: “We’ll see you later. We’re a rock n roll band, you know?” 😥\n\n1:25:45 — Paul face-to-face with John: “Have you written anything else?”\n\nJohn: “No.”\n\nPaul: “We’re gonna be up against a crisis.”\n\nJohn: “When I’m up against the wall, Paul, you’ll find I’m at my best.”\n\nPaul: “Yeah, I know, John, but I wish you’d come up with the goods.”\n\nJohn: “Look, I think I’ve got Sunday off.”\n\nPaul: “Well, I hope you can deliver.”\n\nJohn: “I’m hoping for a little rock n roller.”\n\n1:26:20 — MLH & band & George Martin discussing show ideas — whether to do it at Twickenham a la Hey Jude or somewhere else.\n\n1:27:04 — George Harrison: “I don’t know of anywhere. That’s why we came here.”\n\nGeorge Martin: “I think you might as well do it right here.”\n\nPaul: “But acoustically it’s not very good here, is it?”\n\nGeorge Martin: “It’s not as good as it could be elsewhere.”\n\n1:27:24 — John sings his answer: “I’d like to say that I like the intimate idea, rather than the large one, simply because we should concentrate on the sound.”\n\n1:27:45 — Two Of Us – Paul singing as Elvis impersonation, John & Paul dancing together!\n\n1:28:07 — Don’t Let Me Down snippet\n\n1:28:18 — I’ve Got A Feeling snippet\n\n1:28:40 — Stand By Me – snippet – Paul lead vocal\n\n1:28:58 — George: “Legalize pot.” 😊\n\n1:29:10 — Maxwell’s Silver Hammer\n\n1:29:15 — George’s Les Paul falls over — hadn’t anyone invented guitar stands by 1969?\n\n1:29:30 — You Win Again by Hank Williams – (a song the Dead also covered!) – John vocal, on grand piano, Paul on drums, George on the Fender Bass VI electric bass – an instrument we’ll see frequently in the doc, played at different times by George, John and Billy Preston!\n\n1:30:14 — I Me Mine — John & Yoko waltzing while the other three guys play the song.\n\n1:31:00 — George plays flamenco music, John does a Spanish dance.\n\n1:31:10 — the interminably intolerable MLH wanking on about “staging” each song until John finally tells him to “Just sod off!” and everybody laughs. 😂\n\n1:31:28 — MLH & Denis O’Dell (head of Apple Films, producer of Magical Mystery Tour and The Magic Christian) discussing staging a TV special at Twickenham.\n\n1:31:40 — they show possible staging sketches to Paul — it’s compared to Around the Beatles, their April 1964 ITV hour-long TV special where they played in-the-round.\n\nYou can see the whole show complete with sixties go-go dancers, a young Long John Baldry (Got My Mojo Working), Beatles sister Cilla Black, The Beatles’ only ever live performance of Shout (by the Isley Brothers), and the band playing *to* Ringo instead of him behind them, on YouTube . . .\n\n1:31:55 — Paul tells Denis O’Dell — “Show it to John. John & Yoko know about that. They’re artists.” (!)\n\nJohn: “It’s – Around The Beatles ’69.” 🙂\n\nThey talk about putting plastic transparencies in front of the band. You can hear Paul playing Let It Be in the background.\n\n1:32:35 — MLH talking to Ringo: “Think of a helicopter shot over the amphitheater …”\n\nRingo: “Yes, but that’s the only argument you’re giving me is the helicopter shot, and you’ll see the sea and you’ll be in the theater. And that is for one, two minutes, say, of that shot — and that isn’t worth me going out there, when I really prefer to do it here.” 🙂\n\n1:32:55 — John talking about putting in “blocks of plastic in any shape we wanted. We could move the audience round.”\n\n1:33:10 — back to MLH hectoring Ringo. 🙂 He goes into some weird tangent — “It’s like four years ago. And there’s nothing wrong with four years ago, except we’re all 28 now …” Ringo literally laughs at him. “Well, yes, we are.” This guy’s nutty as a fruitcake, as my mother used to say. 🙂\n\n1:33:35 — back to John & Denis O’Dell, who riffs on John’s plastic box idea, “Like Kubrick would do.” (!) Denis had actually set up a meeting the year before with Kubrick, John & Paul to discuss them making a version of Lord of The Rings. United Artists had approved the idea, John & Paul were all for it, but Kubrick thought it was unfilmable, and Denis said years later that realistically the band could never have devoted the time to it that it would have taken. And now here’s the band and producer 50 years later in a movie directed by the guy who finally got Lord of The Rings made! — and won Best Director and Best Picture Academy Awards for the third installment.\n\n1:34:00 — MLH — “If it is going to be your last TV show ….” (!)\n\nRingo responds: “Yeah, but you’re only surmising that. Just cuz we got a bit grumpy. We’ve been getting grumpy for the last 18 months.”\n\nMLH: “But I don’t want you to be unhappy cuz, like, I love you like I love your three colleagues.”\n\nWhat?!\n\nI reckon the only reason they didn’t just fire this guy who was clearly so out of his league and out of place was because they were already under such pressure to write the new album in two weeks they didn’t want to also deal with finding a new director and getting him up to speed.\n\nIt has certainly crossed my mind more than once — what if they’d asked any number of the very happening late-’60s directors to do this like D.A. Pennebaker, Mike Nichols or Francois Truffaut?\n\n1:34:14 — John with pen in hand drawing a stage plan on the back of the original sheets. (Boy, these’d bring a pretty penny today!)\n\nRingo to MLH: “See, I’d watch an hour of him just playing the piano.” Then he smiles, like, “Sod off with your kooky ideas.” 😄\n\nThen MLH does make the valid observation that he doesn’t want to do it “here on a stage with tubular scaffolding around it.”\n\nFunny / cool editing by Peter Jackson, cutting back & forth between Denis O’Dell talking up the Twickenham shoot, and MLH trying to convince Ringo not to do it there. 🙂\n\nMLH to Ringo, interminably: “If you will take the veto off . . . ” and Ringo just smiles and shrugs, like, “Fat chance.” 😂\n\n1:35:15 — MLH & Tony Richmond join John & Denis.\n\nMLH argues to them that doing it in a studio isn’t the “one in a million” setting he’s going for. (he’s right about this) Then he goes back into his “Can’t you see this at night, torch-lit in the desert” routine. 😮\n\n1:35:27 — Denis asks MLH: “What’s George’s latest reaction to all this?”\n\nMLH: “I don’t know.”\n\nDenis: “Well, you’ve left out a quarter!” 🙂\n\nMLH admits “the documentary is running out of gas.”\n\nDenis responds “It’s really why I’m letting you go on shooting stock — cuz I knew you’d come on the third day and say, ‘What else is there?'”\n\n* People give MLH credit for the original footage — but it was an Apple decision and production and funding.\n\n1:35:50 — MLH to John: “Paul and you are not getting on as well as you did. It’s not as easy. What do you feel about that? It [this show] might make it better again – whatever the wound is.”\n\nJohn: “Yeah. That’s what I was thinking.” (!)\n\n1:36:20 — Everybody moves to a group meeting around the grand piano.\n\nPaul: “An outdoor scene has to be in England.”\n\nDenis: “It’s too bloody cold.”\n\nPaul mentions the super-ornate & gorgeous Tower Ballroom in London. [click on this link and see this room! 😉]\n\nGeorge suggests them doing it as “a nightclub act. Just the smoochy low lights and about ten people.” [they ended up with a seated audience of four on the roof!]\n\nMLH keeps stressing the audience “really ought to be the whole world.”\n\nDenis says they’re now circling back to the Sabratha amphitheater in Libya.\n\nMLH: “I don’t think anything is going to beat a perfect acoustic place by the water out of doors.”\n\nDenis begins advocating for the amphitheater.\n\n1:38:35 — John arrives and joins conversation.\n\nMLH: “We’re off to Africa.”\n\nPaul: “No we’re not.” 🤣\n\nGeorge: “What is the point of doing it abroad? I’d much rather do it here, and then go away.”\n\nJohn seems to like the outdoor amphitheater idea: “It’s like having the most fantastic set on earth.”\n\nRingo: “But how many are going to be looking at the set besides us and him?”\n\nJohn mentions how “Every time we’ve done an album, we’ve said, ‘Why are we stuck in EMI?’ We could be doing it in L.A. We could be in France. And here we are again, building another bloody castle around us.”\n\nPaul: “Well said, John. Well said!”\n\nJohn: “And this time we do it there. I’d be thrilled to do it — timing it so as the sun came up just on the middle eight.”\n\nJohn: “Just give me one reason to stay here.”\n\nRingo: “For the people!”\n\nJohn: “The people? That’s the only reason. Alright, so we take ’em with us.”\n\nPaul: “Look, we were gonna give tickets away at this door here. We’d give out those tickets, but they include a boat ride as well.”\n\nMLH: “We take them with us, and that’s the show.”\n\nGeorge: “It’s just impractical to try and get all these —”\n\nPaul: “But it’s not, you see —”\n\nGeorge: ” — lug all them people there, and try and get all that equipment …”\n\nJohn: “That’s not our problem.”\n\nGeorge: “Of course it’s our problem.” [good for George!]\n\n1:40:15 — WHAT is with MLH and these stupid code names for the bandmembers? NOBODY uses them but him. The guy is so infantile and so off-base so often! For the life of him, he can’t play in the key of the song being played around him.\n\nPaul: “So, like, I’ll come in with you, as long as you can get a couple of boats, like the QE2.”\n\nGeorge: “And then we’re stuck with a bloody big boatload of people for two weeks. 😄 At least you can go home from here. You can get away from it all. I think the idea of the boat is completely insane. It’s very expensive and insane. Who’s gonna cough up for that? They haven’t even made back the money it cost to buy the film for Magical Mystery Tour.” (!) Boy, it sure comes across in the many hours of this doc how absolutely essential George was to this magical alchemy.\n\nJohn: “We should be able to get the boat for the publicity they get from it.”\n\nGeorge: “They won’t even give us a free Fender amp!” 😂\n\nDenis: “You’d love the place.”\n\nGeorge: “I may love the place, but I’d rather do the show here, and then go and love the place.” 😂\n\nRingo rightly asks: “How are you going to get a ship in a couple of days?”\n\nJohn: “We got the American Navy for How I Won The War.”\n\nShows footage from the 1967 Richard Lester film.\n\nRingo: “I was there. Yes, I know. But they were passing by and you only used them for a few hours.”\n\nIt ends with MLH trying to get them to agree to the Libya idea, and bandleader John lays it down – “We’ll mull it over tonight. Leave it in the air and just think about it. We can all say yes now and somebody can decide no tomorrow.” [see, also: tomorrow] 🤣\n\n1:42:15 — DAY SIX — Thursday, January 9th\n\n1:42:20 — Paul brings Linda to Twickenham\n\n1:43:12 — Another Day by Paul & Linda — Paul solo on grand piano\n\n1:43:40 — The Long And Winding Road — Paul running thru it solo on the grand.\n\n1:43:55 — Ringo to MLH: “I went off the boat, actually.”\n\nMLH keeps arguing for the show being for “the world.”\n\nRingo says: “The biggest part of our world is America and England.”\n\n1:44:50 — Paul and Mal discuss locations for the show.\n\nPaul suggests doing it on a farm in Scotland. (where he bought a farm in 1966 and would retreat later this year as the band dissolved)\n\n1:45:20 — Mal asks Paul if he ever saw The Wizard of Oz 🙂 and Paul says No!!\n\n1:45:52 — Mal helping Paul write the lyrics to Long & Winding Road!\n\n1:46:25 — MLH & Linda praising Ringo. Linda: “I feel the most relaxed around Ring.”\n\n1:47:35 — Golden Slumbers — early take – Paul solo on grand piano – with Ringo sitting at his side.\n\n1:47:42 — Linda taking pictures. And Peter Jackson incorporating them! Wow! 😉\n\n1:48:58— George arrives.\n\n1:49:40 — Carry That Weight — Paul’s song for Ringo to sing!\n\nGeorge and Ringo gather around the piano and sing it with Paul.\n\nAnother song about what they were all going through to add to All Things Must Pass, On Our Way Home, Get Back, & Let It Be.\n\n1:50:53 — the beautiful (Grateful Dead-like) The Castle of the King of the Birds (!) (writing credit to all four Beatles) – George on drums! 😮\n\n1:51:25 — For You Blue — George song, on acoustic guitar. Paul on grand piano.\n\n1:53:00 — Get Back again — the version condemning white nationalism.\n\n1:55:00 — Commonwealth (Lennon/McCartney) — the commentary song on British racism — Yoko dancing in her seat! John & Paul laughing together.\n\n1:58:30 — She Came in Through The Bathroom Window — great\n\nJohn on grand piano.\n\nFantastic film editing!\n\n2:01:05 — Mal mentions it was Elvis’s 34th birthday yesterday.\n\nJohn salutes “God bless our gracious king.” 😁\n\n2:01:20 — George talking about locations for the show.\n\nGeorge: “Shall we do some other people’s tunes as well? That’d be nice.”\n\nJohn: “I don’t know any. I can only just bear doing your lot’s songs.” 🤣\n\nGeorge: “Some other people’s songs are much better than ours.”\n\nJohn: “That’s why I don’t learn them.” 😂\n\n[Sure wish George would have mentioned some songwriters or songs he admired!]\n\n2:01:50 — Honey Hush by Big Joe Turner for ten seconds\n\n2:02:05 — For You Blue for a few seconds\n\n2:02:35 — Suzy Parker – Beatles original, composition credited to all four – John lead vocal\n\n2:03:05 — House of the Rising Son for a few seconds\n\n2:03:33 — Mama, You’ve Been On My Mind — 30 touching seconds of George on acoustic guitar singing Dylan\n\n2:04:00 — Across The Universe — goofing version\n\n2:04:25 — Shakin’ In The Sixties — goofing riff\n\n2:04:55 — Let It Be — serious Paul solo on piano run-thru — great version.\n\nLinda taking pictures.\n\n2:06:10 — Linda & Yoko talking.\n\nJohn playing the Fender Bass VI.\n\nGlyn definitely helping with the arrangement (again).\n\nMore great visual editing by Peter Jackson.\n\n2:08:05 — Let It Be take two — vocal harmonies\n\n2:08:40 — Yoko & Linda talking again.\n\n2:09:40 — DAY 7 — Friday, January 10th\n\n2:09:45 — weird awkward scene with music publisher Dick James – reviewing the Northern Songs catalog. Paul doesn’t seem to like/trust him.\n\n2:12:50 — Ringo to George: “Would you like to see what you have half a percent of?” 😢\n\n2:13:20 — George: “Neil [Aspinall] would like us to have a meeting. He was very excited.”\n\nJohn: “Was he? Good news?”\n\nGeorge: “Yes, very.”\n\nJohn: “Oh, alright, I’ll come for good news.” 😁\n\n2:14:13 — Get Back – rockin crazy high-energy version\n\n2:14:30 — Hi-Heel Sneakers (by Tommy Tucker) – John lead vocal\n\n2:15:00–2:21:05 — Get Back\n\n2:15:10 — shots of Glyn Johns’ makeshift recording console room.\n\nJohn & Paul face-to-face, happy, working out the chords.\n\nJamming it / rocking it out / having fun.\n\nIt’s a beautiful thing to see them collectively working together.\n\nPaul writing / working out the arrangement with the band; and then the lyrics.\n\nPaul is being critical of George’s contributions. 😥\n\n2:21:05 — Two Of Us — cool film editing.\n\n2:22:20 — George leaves band — when they break for lunch — ie; early in the day\n\nGeorge to John: “I think I’ll be leaving the band now”\n\nJohn: “When?”\n\nGeorge: “Now.”\n\nGeorge: “Get a replacement. Write into NME and get a few people.”\n\nMal: “I’ll ask George Martin to see about residuals.”\n\n2:22:57 — Film shows George’s diary!! Is this real?!? It presents it as real.\n\nFriday January 10th, 1969:\n\n“Got up, went to Twickenham, rehearsed until lunchtime – left the Beatles – went home.”\n\n2:23:40 — I’ve Got A Feeling / Don’t Let Me Down — just the trio — almost primal scream therapy versions.\n\n2:24:30 — Yoko “singing”\n\n2:25:25 — Paul on drums\n\n2:25:30 — Ringo’s funny faux radio report – “The big sound of 1969.” 😁\n\n2:25:49 — Maxwell’s Silver Hammer\n\n2:25:51 — Paul playing on scaffolding like a monkey-gym.\n\n2:26:06 — MLH still pimping his show while the band is breaking up in front of him (!) I don’t know if I hate this guy or just strongly dislike him.\n\nMLH: “Maybe for the show you could just say George was sick.” 😮\n\nJohn: “No. I mean, if he leaves, he leaves.”\n\n2:26:18 — John: “If he doesn’t come back by Tuesday, we get Clapton.”\n\nYoko at the microphone singing “John John John” (!?)\n\n2:26:45 — Maureen Starkey’s first appearance! (aka Mo) Soon to be a hero of the story. 💓\n\nand Neil Aspinall — Apple Corps Managing Director – two people who were there from the Cavern onwards\n\n— both appear on the scene — undoubtably because of the new band crisis — sitting in the chair circle on the soundstage.\n\n2:26:53 — Neil: “Really, the box that George is in, it’s him versus John & Paul, when it comes to what they’re gonna do and what they’re gonna play. You try doing that for a few months, you’re gonna end up pissed off.”\n\n2:27:08 — George Martin: “They’re our songwriting team, and he’s his own team. And if he’s not working on his own song …”\n\nMLH: “Yes but, John & Paul aren’t writing together much anymore, are they, really?”\n\nGeorge Martin: “Nevertheless, they’re still a team.”\n\n2:27:20 — Paul jokes to Maureen — “A-7 … D-7 … G-7 — get ’em off over the weekend and you’re in.” 🤣\n\nI love the love between Paul and Mo. ❤️‍🩹\n\n2:27:27 — band meeting in chairs on the soundstage – also with George Martin, Neil Aspinall, MLH & Glyn Johns.\n\nJohn approaches — “So, cats and kittens, what we gonna do?” 🙂\n\n2:27:41 — MLH talks about being an actor and working with Orson Welles. (There was an unsubstantiated rumor MLH was Welles’s son.) He talks about Welles quitting a production — but he came back an hour later.\n\nThey sure don’t seem worried about George leaving.\n\n2:28:05 — Paul: “The Mersey Beat Award for Best Couple of The Year goes to John & Yoko.” 🙂\n\n2:28:20 — Paul: “I think we should do the show in The Cavern.” (!)\n\nGeorge Martin: “Location isn’t really a main problem at the moment.”\n\n2:28:35 — George’s song Isn’t It a Pity starts playing over somber-looking faces.\n\n* 2:29:10 — John, Paul & Ringo all huddle and embrace with coats on by the scaffolding.\n\nTitle card:\n\n“John, Paul & Ringo decide to meet with George, hoping to convince him to rejoin the band.”\n\n2:29:29 — Image of Ringo’s beautiful house.\n\nTitle card:\n\n“On Sunday [Jan. 12th], the four Beatles, along with Yoko & Linda, meet at Ringo’s house.”\n\n. . . fade to black . . .\n\n“The meeting does not go well.”\n\n2:29:50 — Credits start — they’re 6 mins 50 secs long.\n\nThe song credits are unique to each episode, and songs are listed in the order they appeared in the episode.\n\nRecording of Isn’t It A Pity by George plays over closing footage and credits.\n\nThen The Castle of the King of the Birds (!) (like the Grateful Dead’s Fire on The Mountain)\n\n==========================\n\nRe: George leaving the band:\n\nPeter Jackson said in that must-see 4-hour discussion about the film (in the YouTube link at the top of this page) that at the time George left the band he was also having a domestic crisis at home, which Jackson didn’t include in the doc, in part because there was probably no audio or video of it, and also he didn’t want to get into those kinds of personal side stories. But Pattie Boyd writes about it in her memoir Wonderful Tonight that at this exact time in early January ’69, George was having an affair with a 20-year-old French girl (Charlotte Martin), and Pattie actually left him over it. Plus his mother was seriously ill up in Liverpool (necessitating George’s trip there mentioned in episode two), so there were serious external pressures in his life besides whatever was going on with the band.\n\n==========================\n\nSome Post-Episode-One Observations, written and posted online before Episode Two was released:\n\nIn interviews, Peter Jackson tells the story of how, back in 2017, 29 seconds of silent unseen Beatles footage was uncovered from when they were filming Help — and how it became a news story all over the world. 😮 Even if you subtract the original film’s entire 81 minutes from this 455 — that still leaves well over six hours of footage of unseen footage! You can catch the 29 seconds here.\n\nGREAT sound editing — including inserting the sound of pages turning when they’re flipping through a magazine (or birds chirping with the photo of Ringo’s house in the next episode) and other such subtleties that help bring the images more to life.\n\nAnd the film editing is just f’ing BRILLIANT.\n\nUpon second viewing I’m choked up / crying in joy. This is SO well made!\n\nI find my mouth hanging open so often when I’m watching this. 🙂 I’m literally jaw-dropped. 😮\n\nThis is the greatest movie ever made! 🙂 or so I think right now. 😄\n\nGlyn Jones is really the album’s producer — George Martin isn’t there very much at Twickenham.\n\nPhil Lesh was a trumpet player — then was enlisted as the bass player.\n\nPaul McCartney was a guitarist — then morphed into being the bass player.\n\n“Liverpool is the capitol of Ireland.” Paul in McCartney 3,2,1.\n\nI know Peter Jackson praises Michael Lindsay-Hogg, but Hogg f’ed up.\n\nHe missed the joy; and he misrepresented what happened.\n\nHe was as misguided in his documentary choices as he was in his insistence of the show being in Libya.\n\nI don’t know how songwriting royalties work on streaming services — but a LOT of songwriters (or their estates or whatever) are gonna get nice paycheques from this.\n\nJohn & Paul are really a creative partnership, no matter who comes up with the song first.\n\nThis has clearly joined Don’t Look Back, Woodstock and The Last Waltz as one of the greatest rock docs ever made — it’s just whatever order ya wanna rank ’em. 😉\n\n.\n\n========================\n\n========================\n\n.\n\nEPISODE TWO — Days 8 thru 16 — January 13th thru 25th, 1969\n\n2 hours & 47 mins (plus 6½minutes of credits)\n\nRehearsing / Recording at Savile Row\n\n0:55 Day 8 — Monday, January 13th, 1969 — still in Twickenham\n\n2:05 — Ringo, Mal, MLH, Tony Richmond & Kevin Harrington talking about the band meeting yesterday with George.\n\nRingo: “It started out fine, then it all sort of fell apart in the end.”\n\n2:35 — MLH on the state of the documentary.\n\n2:57 — Flowers arrive “for Mr. Harrison.” (from the Hare Krishna people)\n\nMLH: “Harry who?” 😂\n\n3:40 — Paul & Linda arrive.\n\n4:30 — Neil Aspinall (Apple’s Managing Director) — frizzy hair — joins. Then Glyn Johns also joins.\n\n4:35 — Sitting in a circle of chairs in Twickenham:\n\nPaul, Linda, Ringo, Tony Richmond, Glyn Johns, MLH, Kevin Harrington, Neil Aspinall.\n\n4:50 — Linda saying that at the George meeting yesterday Yoko was speaking for John and she doesn’t think he (John) “believes any of that.” (!)\n\nPaul says George walked out, saying, “I’ll see ya.”\n\n5:10 — Long riff by Paul about John & Yoko — defends them as a couple. He REALLY doesn’t mind her being there.\n\n5:20 — Paul: “If it came to a push between Yoko and the Beatles, it’s Yoko, you know.”\n\n5:40 — MLH: “When John and I were talking the other day, John said he really didn’t want to not be a Beatle.”\n\n5:50 — MLH asks about Paul & John writing together.\n\nPaul: “We’ve cooled it because we’re not playing together.” … “We used to live together, in the same hotels, get up at the same time every morning …”\n\nPaul: “Musically we can play better than we ever have before.”\n\nPaul: “It’s difficult starting out from scratch with Yoko there. I start writing about white walls cuz I think John & Yoko would like that, but they wouldn’t.”\n\n6:30 — Paul: “She’s great. She really is alright.”\n\nPaul: — “It’s silly for anybody to say, No you can’t do that.”\n\n7:09 — Paul: “For them to be able to compromise, I have to be able to compromise first.”\n\n7:18 — Paul: “We probably do need a central daddy figure to say, you know, ‘Nine o’clock, leave your girls at home, lads.'”\n\n7:30 — Paul: “It’s gonna be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in 50 years time (!) ‘They broke up cuz Yoko sat on an amp.'”\n\nPaul & Ringo start bringing their girlfriends/wives to the studios after John brought Yoko. This is a great thing breaking the old-school world of women being second class citizens, and as reflected in John’s song on Sometime In New York City.\n\n8:25 — MLH and Paul talking about short-term plans.\n\n9:00 — Paul’s news bulletin show idea — and the final bulletin would be “The Beatles have broken up.” (!)\n\n9:35 — “And then there were two.” Paul says, looking sad, teary eyed. [And, ironically, it’s the two who are the only two still living in 2021.]\n\n10:20 — Linda — “We looked at Help the other night, and Hard Day’s Night, and that was them playing …”\n\n10:35 — MLH to Linda — “I’m a bigger fan than you are.” (!) What an incredible jerk this guy is.\n\n11:15 — MLH: “I thought the other day I might leave, but then I thought, they won’t even notice.” That’s one thing he’s got right. 😁\n\n11:40–16:00 — The John & Paul cafeteria scene with the mic in the flowerpot talking about the George problem. SO cool.\n\nIf you think it’s hard to understand now — you should hear the original on bootleg!\n\nJohn: It’s like George said — he didn’t get enough satisfaction anymore, because of the compromise he had to make to be together. It’s a festering wound that we’ve allowed to … and yesterday we allowed it to go even deeper, and we didn’t give him any bandages. And when he is that far in, we have egos.\n\nPaul: The thing is, that’s what I was trying to say to George, you know. Whereas previously I would have said, ‘Take it there with diddle-derddl-diddle-der.’ But I was trying last week to say, ‘Now take it there. Anything you like. Put whatever you…’\n\nJohn: You see, the point is now, we both do that to George this time, and because of the buildup to it.\n\nPaul: Yeah, we treat him a bit like that. See, cuz he knows what we’re on about. But I do think that he’s right. That’s why I think we’ve got the problem now, you know, the four of us. You go one way, George one way, and me another. But I know it’ll apply to all of us, if one day you can all be singing like you sing. George can be really playing, I mean, like he plays, not like I keep trying to make him play.\n\nJohn: Yeah, okay, because you’re afraid that how he’ll play won’t be like you want him to play, and that’s what we do, and that’s what you do to me. And I’m not gonna tell you what to play.\n\nPaul: See, that … that seems to be the trouble, is that if you’d have been able to say that on the occasion, just even to say, ‘Look, I’m not gonna say anything about the song because it’s very difficult, I’m gonna really try and now…’\n\nJohn: You know, I’ve always done the numbers like that. Now, the only regret about the past numbers is when, because I’ve been so frightened, I’ve allowed you to take it somewhere where I didn’t want. And then, that my only chance was to let George take over, or interest George in it. If you give me your suggestions, let me reject them and pinch the ones I like… is where my writing side is. Same goes for the arranging. I don’t want it to… I don’t know.\n\nPaul: I know. I do know. I know what you mean, yeah.\n\nJohn: ’Cause there was a period where none of us could actually say anything about your arrangements ’cause you would reject it all. I’d have to tell George and I would just say, you know, like you do about me. You know, ‘I’m Paul McCartney’, and a lot of the times you were right, and a lot of the times you were wrong. Same as we always are. But I can’t see the answer to that, because you’ve suddenly got it all, you see.\n\nPaul: I really don’t want you…\n\nJohn: Well, all right. I’m just telling you what I think. I don’t The Beatles revolve around the four people.\n\nPaul: You know, but I tell you what. I tell you one thing, what I think. The main thing is this: you have always been boss. Now I’ve been, sort of, secondary boss.\n\nJohn: Not always.\n\nPaul: No, listen. Listen. No, always! Really, I mean, it is gonna be much better if we can actually just stick together and say, ‘Look George, on I’ve Got A Feeling I want you to do it exactly like I play it.’ And he’ll say, ‘I’m not you, and I can’t do it exactly like you do it.’\n\nJohn: But this year, what you’ve been doing, and what everybody’s been doing, I’ve not only felt guilty about the way we’re all guilty about our relationship to each other, cuz we could do more. And look, I’m not putting any blame on you. I’ve suddenly realized this, because that was my game, you know, but goals, they’re still the same. Self-preservation, you know. I know what I like, I’ve let you do what you want and George too, you know.\n\nPaul: Yeah, I know\n\nJohn: If we want him, if we do want him, I can go along with that, because the policy has kept us together.\n\nPaul: Well, I don’t know, you know. See, I’m just assuming he’s coming back. If he isn’t, then he isn’t, then it’s a new problem. And probably when we’re all very old, we’ll all agree with each other, and we’ll all sing together.\n\n16:20 — Loading George’s 8-track recording equipment back into the truck.\n\n16:25 — Ringo: “George has gone to Liverpool. He’s due back Wednesday.” [George’s mother is sick; she would pass away 18 months later. Ringo’s saying this on Monday – so George is not in London for 3 of the 7 days he “quit.”]\n\n16:40 — The three start rehearsing again.\n\n16:55 — Get Back — Mel handwriting the lyrics.\n\nJohn & Paul writing / trading lyric ideas.\n\n18:35 — Paul citing the use of “Tucson Arizona” because that’s where they make the High Chaparral TV show on NBC. 🙂\n\n[Chris O’Dell, from Tucson, was given the job of typing up these lyrics, and she got a pang of fear that they were telling her to leave — to get back to where she once belonged! 🙂 ]\n\n18:40 — taking a crack at Get Back.\n\n19:45 — more show planning with MLH & Paul.\n\n20:25 — Paul shows setlist still taped to his bass from the last U.S. concert tour!\n\n20:30 — DAY 9 — Tuesday January 14th\n\n20:35 — Paul telling Paul Bond (clapper guy / second camera) how all the music ever written is on the piano.\n\n21:15 — Martha My Dear — Paul solo on grand piano.\n\n22:10 — Ringo shows up – Paul: “Good morning, Rich!”\n\nRingo & Paul’s joyous animated duet on grand piano.\n\nIt’s SO great cameras were rolling for this!\n\nGlyn Johns sure seems cool.\n\n23:20 — Paul singing Woman on grand piano — early Beatles song.\n\n25:00 — The Back Seat of My Car — Paul song — on grand piano.\n\n25:20 — Song Of Love — Lennon/McCartney song — goofing in Elvis impersonation.\n\nRingo operating the film camera.\n\n26:25 — sets for The Magic Christian coming onto the soundstage.\n\n26:34 — Paul taking about making a scripted movie. Funny group goofing on roles for different people.\n\nPaul: “Do you want to be a goody then, Glyn?”\n\nRingo: “The roughneck who changes.”\n\nGlyn: “With a bit of sentimentality.”\n\nPaul: “The hard drug-dealing yob.”\n\nRingo: “With a good heart.”\n\nPaul: “Who turned to religion.”\n\nPaul: “Ringo’s the schoolteacher who goes to see him.”\n\nRingo: “Mal’s the policeman who’s gone wrong.”\n\nMal: “They’ll never get anything out of me unless they use a pump.”\n\nPaul: “Tony [Richmond] is in it. He’s the fence — where Glyn gets rid of the drugs.”\n\nMLH: “Can I be in it?”\n\nRingo: “You can be a traffic sign.” 🤣 🤣 🤣\n\n27:45 — Paul goes up on chain pulley into the scaffolding.\n\n28:20 — John, Paul & Ringo sitting in chairs goofing — classic Beatles humor — something both Brian Epstein & George Martin cited as an important reason they first wanted to work with these nobodys.\n\nGlyn and Mal sitting behind.\n\nJohn: “A lot of us started with Rosy.” 🤣\n\n29:00 — John: “I see you’ve given up smoking, Richie.” 😁\n\n29:25 — Peter Sellers shows up. The Beatles were fans of his from The Goon Show days in the late ’50s.\n\nSadly he doesn’t do much but smile.\n\nJohn goofing and being funny. “You’re talking to the ninth-best-dressed pop singer in the world, you know? . . . Look out Tom Jones, I say.” 🤣\n\n31:30 — Peter Sellers leaves.\n\n31:40 — Talking about the documentary and scheduling.\n\n32:10 — John: “I was up late, sorta stoned and high and watching films.”\n\n32:54 — Paul: “We can’t carry on like this indefinitely.”\n\nPaul: “What we need is a serious program of work.”\n\nPaul: “To wander endlessly is very un-swinging. Un-hip.”\n\nPaul: “What we need is a schedule. Achieve something every day.” (!) <— that’s MY working practice in life! 💖\n\nPaul’s drinking white wine pretty early in the day!\n\n33:50 — George Martin shows up and sits with them.\n\nJohn goofing with camera and scat riffing.\n\nJohn on masturbating — “You don’t go blind … but very short-sighted,” he says, squinting through his thick glasses. 🤣\n\n35:40 — Mean Mr. Mustard — John song — audio only, no footage.\n\n* 36:20 — Madmen – unreleased John song – on electric piano!\n\n36:52 — Discussing immediate band plans in the absence of George.\n\n37:01 — Paul: “I think we stop filming now — as a matter of policy. That’s a wrap for you, lads.”\n\n37:08 — audio only — Paul: “George is in Liverpool now [Tuesday], and he’s supposed to come back tomorrow.”\n\nJohn: “So we should go and see him, you think?”\n\nTitle cards:\n\n“Rehearsals are cancelled for tomorrow.”\n\n“John Paul and Ringo will meet with George again.” [at Ringo’s House – “Brookfields” – a 16th century mansion in Elstead, Surrey, that he bought from Peter Sellers]\n\n“The meeting [on Wed. Jan. 15th] is positive and productive.”\n\n“The live TV Special is abandoned.”\n\n“They will relocate to their new Apple Studio, and record the songs there.”\n\n37:55 — Nice Savile Row footage.\n\n38:15 — DAY 10 — Thursday, January 16th\n\nPacking up at Twickenham.\n\n38:40 — Glyn Johns in his little temporary control room at Twickenham.\n\n38:50 — Oh!

Rosemary’s Baby on an Evening Standard poster with the headline: “The Weird Mia Farrow Film That Has The Censor Anxious” 😁\n\n42:20 — Title card:\n\n“On Monday morning Apple Studio is not quite ready. The Beatles will continue to rehearse, and start recording on Tuesday.

It’s got nothing to do with anybody else really.”\n\nTony asks them — “You’ve obviously read in the papers about the possible split of the Beatles.” (!)\n\n“What would you like to see the Beatles do now?”\n\nThe girls answer — “A show. A live show. Any show.”\n\n. . . . then the camera pans up to the roof. 🙂 This is great freakin filmmaking.\n\n44:05 — DAY 12 – Tuesday, January 21st\n\nSavile Row studio recording — green (apple) carpet, white walls, small-ish room.\n\n44:47 — George Martin sashays in like a gunslinger who owns this town.\n\n45:43 — The band seems to be happily reunited.

John lead vocal.\n\n54:42 — Too Bad About Sorrow – Lennon/McCartney original ­– Paul & John sharing lead vocal\n\n56:00 — Dig A Pony – new John song\n\n56:54 — Glyn Johns: “I keep telling you not to, and you won’t listen to what I say.”\n\nPaul: “You’re right.” 😁\n\nThis back-and-forth reflects the cool joking banter that the Beatles themselves exchange — and that George Martin and others have cited as a difference between the three Beatles and Pete Best.\n\nMLH is the Pete Best of this collective. Glyn Johns is Ringo. 😉\n\n56:58 — unboxing the Leslie speaker.\n\n57:55 — My Baby Left Me – by Arthur ‘Big Boy’ Crudup – rockin’ out, John on vocal, Paul on drums.\n\n58:16 — Hi-Heel Sneakers – by Tommy Tucker – John vocal, Paul on drums.\n\nYoko actually seat dancing!\n\n58:40 — Hallelujah I Love Her So – by Ray Charles – John vocals\n\n58:56 — George looking at Beggar’s Banquet album.\n\n59:09 — Article appears — “The End of a Beautiful Friendship” — ie; The Beatles breaking up is WAY in the air.\n\n59:36 — Paul reading from the fucked-up article.

Their lead singer [Peter Green] is great, looks great. And he sings very quiet as well. He’s not a shouter.” Then John mimics the sound, as George leans in, riveted.\n\nPaul: “It’s a bit like Canned Heat.”\n\nJohn: “Yeah, but better than Canned Heat.”\n\nGeorge: “There was only four of them last night, weren’t there?”\n\nJohn: “Yeah. They’re really good, though. It’s just that sweeter, just the guitar hanging.”\n\n1:20:10 — Going Up The Country (Canned Heat) — Paul vocal\n\n1:20:45 — Dig A Pony – full band take (short)\n\n1:21:40 — I’ve Got a Feeling – rough working out\n\nThey’re having SO MUCH fun!\n\n1:23:15 — new goofing take on I’ve Got a Feeling\n\n1:24:15 — John talking about MLK and “I had a dream.”!! “Like a big poem it was.” How he was like a poet – “like Tennyson, he was.”\n\nGeorge – “We should make a collage of our gold records on the wall.”\n\nJohn – “If you can get them off Mimi’s wall.”\n\n1:26:30 — Billy Preston arrives — doesn’t know they need a keyboard player\n\n[the exact half-way point of the episode, to the second!]\n\nHe’s in London to do a couple of TV appearances. According to both Tony Bramwell and Chris O’Dell, Billy’s UK agent Larry Curzon was at William Morris next door to Apple and was always coming by their building. When it became known that Billy was in town, Chris called Larry to arrange a time for him to come by.\n\nBig smiles and happy greetings all around.\n\n1:26:50 — John gives Billy the lay of the land — how they’re playing everything live. “Every number’s got a piano part. And normally we overdub it. But this time we want to do it live. I mean just live to ourselves. Straight off, one number after the other. And that means having somebody in on it. If you’d like to do that, you’re welcome.”\n\n1:27:05 — Billy — big laugh / smile — “Sure. Beautiful! Ha! Are you’re kidding?!?!” and he giddily laughs again.\n\n.\n\nJohn is the leader who asks him to play with them.\n\nNobody else in the band could have done that.\n\n1:27:25 & :31 & :34 — George Martin seen smiling bigger than I’ve ever seen him. 🥰\n\n1:28:23 — kick-ass “I’ve Got a Feeling” — Billy on electric piano – BEAMING away! 🙂\n\nI reckon this is the first song he played with them. And of course he’s locked right in.\n\n1:28:34 — euphoric Paul smiling at what’s happening — ten seconds into the song!!\n\nFantastic camera work & editing throughout all this!\n\n1:29:00 — Yoko seen smiling at the music being played.\n\n1:29:28 — song ends\n\nJohn: “You’re in the group.” 😍 🤣\n\nAnd just like that — The Beatles are a quintet!!! 🤩\n\nIn these 3 minutes, the entire storyline changes.\n\nImagine when Billy got back to wherever he was staying that night and phoned whoever he was closest to at the time. “You’re not gonna believe this, but . . . ” 🤩 🥰\n\n1:29:45 — Don’t Let Me Down – short\n\n1:30:01 — John: “You’re givin us a lift, Bill.” 🙂\n\nWow — they’re really starting to gel!\n\nBilly is just BEAMING ear-to-ear\n\n1:30:15 — Don’t Let Me Down – couple more takes\n\n1:31:15 – Billy takes a rockin’ solo\n\n1:32:10 — Save The Last Dance For Me – the 1960 #1 hit for The Drifters with Ben E. King on lead vocals\n\n1:33:05 — Dig A Pony with Billy\n\n1:34:20 — the band goes to the control room to listen to playback\n\n1:34:40 — Don’t Let Me Down – John flamenco guitar\n\n1:35:35 — MLH again talking about concert plans\n\n* 1:36:10 — John tells MLH how they *have* the documentary — “It’ll be fantastic. With this whole buildup from bits of paper in Twickenham, all that scene, and it’ll be a movie, not a TV show. It’ll be the third Beatles movie. It’s good enough now.”\n\n1:36:40 — Peter Brown Apple exec shows up — talk about Allen Klein 😥\n\nBrian dying and Klein comin in were a one-two death knell to the band.\n\n1:37:30 — DAY 14 — Thursday January 23rd\n\n1:38:00 — Freakout Jam — Yoko screaming — Paul on drums.\n\nBand members filmed from 2nd floor window arriving at 3 Savile Row.\n\n1:38:55 — MLH in a full suit & tie, John, Ringo & George Martin plotting out the recording and show schedule.\n\n1:39:05 — George Martin: “You’re working so well together right now [John “Yes”] let’s keep it going.”\n\n1:39:14 — MLH: “I think we’ll aim for next Thursday.” [which turned out to be the day they indeed did it.]\n\nThey plan to work thru the weekend — for once! 🙂\n\n1:39:45 — Twenty Flight Rock by Eddie Cochran — Billy dances into studio. 🥰\n\nThis is the song Paul played for John (and impressed him) the first day they met (July 6, 1957).\n\n1:40:20 — Paul cites great names of the ’50s – Eddie Cochran, Gene Burks.\n\n1:41:30 — Oh! Darling\n\n1:43:06 — first time we see George playing his custom-made Rosewood Telecaster that he’d later play on the roof concert.\n\nSometime in the next year he gave the guitar to Delaney Bramlett, who ended up lending it to Jerry Garcia to play during an Ian & Sylvia jam in the Festival Express documentary about the infamous 1970 train trip across Canada, finally released in 2003, and directed by Beatles Anthology director Bob Smeaton.\n\n1:43:30 — Get Back — major working out of arrangement, several versions\n\nJohn even counts in the Paul songs.\n\nBoy, they’re having fun!\n\n* 1:54:00 — Hilarious goofing version of Help. Paul loses it laughing. 🥰\n\nThen Please Please Me\n\n* 1:55:00 — Peter Jackson’s hit single video edit of the namesake song of this documentary Get Back — maybe the peak video collage of the film so far — including a rockin’ Billy solo.\n\n1:56:37 — George in the control room during playback saying to John: “It would be nice to put it out as a single. Just do a single of it now.”\n\nJohn: “Okay — let’s knock it off as a single.” 😉\n\nAnd again for anybody who wonders who the bandleader is in The Beatles in January 1969 — it’s John Lennon who puts a new guy in the group, and John Lennon who’s asked to make the decision about the band’s next single. 😉\n\n.\n\n.\n\n1:57:50 — DAY 15 — Friday January 24th\n\nBilly’s not there in the studio — he’s rehearsing for the Lulu show — which aired tomorrow the 25th.\n\n1:57:50 — John to Paul: “Did you hear about the book idea?”\n\nPaul: “Yeah”\n\nJohn: “I think the photos are great, man. Really great. . . . They can have the book and the film out simultaneously.”\n\n1:58:55 — John: “We’ve got Billy a contract. We got him off Capitol. (!) George [Harrison] will produce him.”\n\n1:59:15 — George: “The main thing, Billy is just really so knocked out, so thrilled doing it. And also he sees it’s his great opportunity. . . . We’ll have to decide about paying him. [John: “Yes, right.”] Cuz if we were having Nicky Hopkins we’d have to pay him session musician rates.”\n\nGeorge really does seem like Billy’s ear and representative within the band.\n\n1:59:45 — John: “I mean, I’d just like him in our band, actually.” George enthusiastically nodding yes. “I’d like a fifth Beatle.” (!)\n\n1:59:50 — John: “At Twickenham, suddenly there was three, now there’s four of us, then there’s five!” 🙂\n\nGeorge: “We can do that as well.” [It’s SO too bad they didn’t!]\n\nGeorge: “If I asked Dylan to join the Beatles, and he would, you know. And we get ’em all in here.” 🙂\n\nJohn: “We’ll call it The Beatles & Co. That’ll be our band.” (!) – like The Dead & Company!\n\nGeorge with a smile: “I mean, it’s Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, innit? We could get ’em all.”\n\nPaul: “I just don’t kniw, because it’s bad enough with four.” 🙂 [at least they all laugh]\n\n2:01:00 — John sings – I’m On The Road to Marrakesh (which became Jealous Guy)\n\n2:02:00 — Hail, Hail Rock n Roll by Chuck Berry – (brief) – Mal on tambourine. 💖\n\n2:02:20 — Stand By Me – Ben E. King – (brief)\n\n2:02:44 — John: “We seem to be at a loss without Billy.”\n\n2:03:00 — Two Of Us\n\n2:03:34 — John & Paul on acoustic guitars\n\n2:04:25 — Two of Us – playful\n\nJohn & Paul eye-locked again.\n\n2:05:50 — their comical ordering of lunch — John: “Sparrow on toast.” 🙂 Paul: “Boiled testicle.” 🙂\n\n23-year-old photographer Ethan Russell very present and taking tons of what turned out to be great pics.\n\n2:06:10 — Paul noticing the connections between the songs — Get Back and Two of Us (on our way home) “So there’s a story. And there’s another one — Don’t Let Me Down —> Oh! Darling.”\n\n2:06:30 — George gets his bowties. 🙂\n\n2:07:00 — Two of Us – killer partial take\n\n2:07:30 — control room hang n talk\n\n2:08:30 — Polythene Pam – John singing and on acoustic guitar\n\n2:09:17 — Mal opens the case for the lap steel they call “the Hawaiian”\n\n2:09:37 — Her Majesty – brief – George on the Hawaiian\n\n2:10:01 — Teddy Boy — McCartney song written in India last year. According to Mark Lewisohn this was the first time the song was presented to the band.\n\n2:11:15 — Maggie Mae (traditional) — John & Paul both on acoustics. According to Lewisohn, this was a “traditional Liverpool song about an infamous local lady of the night.”\n\n2:12:00 — Fancy My Chance With You – early Lennon/McCartney song written when they were teenagers.\n\n2:12:45 — Paul to Billy – “Nobody’s asked if you’d mind coming in every day.”\n\nBill: “Oh no, it’s a groove. I had nothing else on.”\n\n2:12:53 — Paul mentions him getting paid.\n\n2:12:55 — Dig It! – John on the Hawaiian\n\n2:13:13 — Pattie Boyd (Harrison) makes her only appearance\n\n2:13:40 — Ringo showing off his Sony home video camera 🙂\n\n2:13:50 — I Feel Fine\n\n2:14:00 — George H asks George Martin about how his studio is going. I think this is AIR Montserrat that became a major studio, recording the Stones, Elton, McCartney, Michael Jackson and scores of others until it was tragicly destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989.\n\n2:14:30 — DAY 16 — Saturday January 25th – no Billy Preston\n\n2:14:30 — Footage from Maharishi’s in India – while Dehra Dun by George Harrison plays\n\n2:14:50 — John mentions to Ringo that he looked at his clothes from India last night “next to me Pepper suit” 😁\n\n2:15:03 — Peter Jackson shows more Maharishi footage set to George’s song Within You, Without You\n\n2:15:20 — Paul talks about watching the footage from India last night. “I’ve got all the film of it.”\n\nHe raves about the opening, and then they show it, with images of Cynthia Lennon, Pattie, Jane Asher (!), Donovan and their whole traveling krewe.\n\nLots more footage of India.\n\n2:17:10 — Paul describes the long shot of John walking with the Maharishi, “And it’s just not you, you know?” 😄\n\nThey talk about John going up in the helicopter — and how he thought the Maharishi might just slip him the answer. 😆\n\n2:19:00 — Why Don’t We Do It In The Road – to two monkeys humping 🙂\n\n2:19:34 — John in India looking for all the world like John Sebastian!\n\n2:19:55 — George talking about the whole purpose of them going was to find themselves. “And if you were really yourself, you wouldn’t be any of who we are now.” (!)\n\n2:20:10 — John says “All Act Naturally now,“ then plays the 1963 Buck Owens hit and Ringo staple on acoustic guitar.\n\n2:20:23 — Glyn: “Is Billy coming today?”\n\nGeorge: “No, he’s doing a TV show all day.” Again, it’s George who knows what Billy is doing.\n\n2:20:30 — Bye Bye Love — John singing the Everly Brothers hit on acoustic guitar, Paul harmonizing.\n\nI don’t want to be accused of reading too much into things, but once again this is a song about saying “bye bye happiness” as the band seems to be winding to a close.\n\nYoko making a calligraphic painting — black Japanese characters on white paper.\n\n2:21:30 — Two of Us – great – playing with it – funny – many variations\n\n2:22:55 — first appearance of Alan Parsons — with title card — close-up, in his orange shirt, although according to Mark Lewisohn he started two days earlier, on Jan. 23rd.\n\n2:23:30 — John does Two Of Us in a Dylan inflection 🙂\n\nGeorge with his funky-cool slipper-boots. 🙂\n\nThey’re all smiling and laughing and enjoying each other’s company.\n\nThen they do the song reggae style. 🙂\n\n2:25:25 — Glyn with the practical advice to get one number down (duh!) . . . and then get another one finished.\n\n2:25:30 — George: “Have we got to have this album recorded by Tuesday then?” (!)\n\nGlyn now says he’s not going to leave until Thursday.\n\n2:25:55 — George asks “Are we still doing the show?”\n\nPaul: “I don’t know, really.”\n\n2:26:15 — George wants the piano to sound like a bad honky-tonk piano.\n\n2:26:20 — George Martin putting newspapers on the grand’s strings so it won’t sound so grand.\n\n2:27:00 — For You Blue — George’s “honky-tonk” song.\n\nJohn playing the lap steel.\n\nAccording to Mark Lewisohn, this song was arranged, rehearsed, recorded, and in-the-can in one day!\n\n2:27:48 — Chris O’Dell with the short blond hair holding clipboard and pen next to Mal.\n\n.\n\n2:28:15 — While George is running through For You Blue, John tells everyone, “Just don’t talk when he’s playing, gang.” — once again looking out for his younger brother.\n\n2:28:30 — take 2 of For You Blue\n\n2:28:50 — 20-year-old Alan Parsons in orange shirt & black tie in control room.\n\n.\n\n2:29:05 — Then John requests they do For You Blue once more so George “can get the guitar like he wants it.”\n\n2:29:10 — they start another take — which becomes the take that appears on the Let It Be album.\n\nJohn on the lap steel.\n\n2:29:52 — George during group playback in the control room — “I think we’re getting a good sound in Apple Studios.”\n\n2:30:16 — John has an idea about the mixing, and Paul says, “That’s a good idea.”\n\nJohn: “Yeah, I’m full of ideas like that. I’m famous for ’em. Literary Beatle, you know.” 😁\n\nGeorge: “Hail to the captain.”\n\nTitle card:\n\n“The Primrose Hill concert is no longer possible.”\n\n2:30:53 — show/concert talk:\n\nMLH points out they don’t have a show planned.\n\nJohn: “I would dig to play onstage, you know?”\n\nPaul: “Yeah.”\n\nJohn: “I mean, if everything was alright, and there was no messing around, and we just play on a stage. That’s why I said yes to the TV show. I didn’t want the hell of doing it, but nobody else wants to go on the stage or do a TV show. Nobody wants to get out there, you know?\n\nThe band loves being in the Apple studio.\n\n2:31:45 — George: “The things that have worked out best ever for us haven’t really been planned any more than this has. . . . You know, whatever it’s going to be, it becomes that, you know?”\n\nJohn talks about how this started out as Paul’s “number” — “but now it’s turned into our number.”\n\n2:32:50 — John asks George “What do you think?” — nice. But George doesn’t answer in the moment.\n\nJohn is really leading the discussion to come up with what they’re going to do.\n\nGeorge on the Apple Studio: “I think this is the nicest place I’ve been in a long time, this studio. Also, this is the most I’ve ever played, by playing every day. I can feel my fingers getting loose. I just wanna play.”\n\nJohn: “That’s what it was about.”\n\n2:34:50 — Paul on the difference between 16mm and 35mm. (The film has all been shot on 16mm so far, but one or two 35mm cameras are seen on the roof.)\n\nShow planning talk that really reveals they all have it in their minds that this is the end.\n\n2:34:57 — John: “Just the still photos would make a UA movie with a soundtrack on it.” [and fulfill the third film requirement of their 1964 3-picture deal with United Artists]\n\n2:35:03 — George: “I think we should blow it up to 35 and if they don’t take it they’re fucking fools because they aren’t going to get anything else, are they?” — again, more group acceptance that there isn’t any more coming for this band. This documentary really makes clear over and over that they knew the band was wrapping up.\n\n2:35:15 — Paul says (correctly) that blowing up 16 to 35 “is a mess.”\n\nMLH claims this will blow up alright — but of course the finished product as seen in theaters and on other formats proved it didn’t.\n\n2:35:30 — Glyn: “It just seems like the last two days have gone so ridiculously well.”\n\nJohn: “He’s right, you know.”\n\n2:35:55 — Paul talking about the final show being “the end of it.”\n\nPaul: “I want to go and have fun with it, rather than just finish off exactly as we started. I’d like to do a (phoosh — grand arm spreading flourish) for the finish.” — again, it’s all talk about this being the end.\n\nPaul: “I mean, just get out in the open, a change of scene, and go and do it somewhere else, do a live show, do it on a stage. You know, I’d like to light a rocket to really sort of take off for the end of it.” (!)\n\n2:36:07 — the first time we see George with his psychedelic Stratocaster that he hand-painted himself in DayGlo colors that could be seen exactly a year earlier, January 1968, in color, on the Magical Mystery Tour TV broadcast. 😍\n\n2:36:50 — I Lost My Little Girl — Paul song sung by John\n\nTitle cards:\n\n“Arranging an alternative concert location within the next couple of days is not possible.”\n\n“However, Michael and Glyn have a suggestion that might give Paul the payoff he’s hoping for.”\n\n“They could stage a performance at a much more convenient location . . .” 😎\n\n* 2:37:35 — GREAT footage of roof scouting — Paul & Ringo & Glyn & MLH & Mal & Kevin & Ethan the photographer, and obviously a cameraman, probably Tony Richmond.\n\n2:39:02 — Paul & George Martin planning logistics including time for getting the other cameras in to shoot on Thursday.\n\nThe lads drinking red wine — and getting pretty loose and goofy.\n\n2:39:17 — Ringo opens the box with his new music stand. 🙂\n\n2:40:00 — Let It Be — many takes\n\nGeorge with his psychedelic painted Stratocaster.\n\n2:40:45 — John playing the Fender Bass VI.\n\n2:42:00 — “Groovy Bob” – Robert Fraser the art dealer shows up 🥳\n\n2:45:19 — George Martin lying on floor reading newspaper. 😁\n\n2:46:35 — Title cards:\n\n“The Beatles decide to stage their rooftop performance on Wednesday.”\n\n“Four days from now.”\n\n2:46:50 — Credits start. They’re 6 mins 25 secs long — again, song credits are unique to each episode, listed in order of appearance.\n\nCool Billy Preston-led “Blues Jam” plays over the credits. This is likely the recording Mark Lewisohn cites as coming from the January 23rd sessions.\n\nThe Walk – a 1958 R&B hit by Jimmy McCrackin with Paul on lead vocals, recorded at Savile Row January 27th.\n\nWithout A Song — cool song from 1929 (!) by Vincent Youmans — Billy singing, and sounds like he’s on the grand piano.\n\nLove Me Do — jamming version with Billy wailing on the electric piano.\n\n=========================\n\nSome observations after 2 episodes / 5½ hours, and just before the climactic episode drops at 3AM (Eastern) . . .\n\nI’m SO glad — as Peter Jackson said, when they were given the 6-hour window by Disney, Peter & his editor very quickly decided, and I quote, “Let’s just make the movie we want,” he said, rubbing his hands together. 😍 And he said he included everything a Beatles fan would want to see, because (something like) “If we don’t put it in, it’s just going to go back in a vault for another 50 years.”\n\nThe fur coat John wears on the roof and is always referred to as Yoko’s was in fact the coat John always wears and carries with him. And according to Deep Beatles aficionado Jan Fennick, the coat was actually his wife Cynthia’s mother’s!\n\nMy 33-year-old neighbor told me how she’s been watching it with her daughter, who has become a huge Beatles fan. I’ve read similar comments online about how people are experiencing this intergenerationally. This is a beautiful thing. How many other rock bands / pop artists would evoke such a response?\n\nJohn & Paul are really a creative partnership. I was as guilty as many who thought they’d pretty much gone their separate ways even by The White Album the year before. But you can see them here looking into each other’s eyes and working up these songs in tandem.\n\nIt was so great to see Paul so strongly defending John bringing Yoko to the rehearsals. I had bought into the easy story that she had caused a fissure — but it’s clear none of his three bandmates are bothered by her at all.\n\nIt’s so nice to see John really on top of it and in control by the time they moved to the Savile Row studio. I love how it’s John who asks Billy Preston to join the band, and that we get to see Billy’s ear-to-ear beaming reaction and blurting out “Are you’re kidding?!?!” 🥰\n\nPeter Jackson has done a masterful job showing the real-life drama that was going on — the pressure of the pending live concert deadline, the near breakup of the band, the desperate need for a keyboard player — and then one just shows up! Whadda story!!\n\nI love how the band becomes a quintet — for both the sound and the energy. John says at one point, “I’d like a fifth Beatle.” To which Paul jokes, “It’s bad enough with four.”\n\nAnd I love how Paul is the big-picture structuralist, noticing the connections between the songs and mapping out a sequence — how Get Back and Two of Us (on our way home) are connected — and Don’t Let Me Down reflects Oh! Darling.\n\nI know it’s been 5½ hours and will soon be nearly 8 — but this is the most intimate portrait ever made of the most influential band ever formed.\n\nThey knew the end was coming. In Part One there was talk of a “divorce” and in Part Two they’re talking about going out with a bang.\n\nIt’s SO bizarre that guitar stands and music stands were not staples of major studios and bands’ gear in January 1969. This is the biggest money-making group in the history of the world . . . and a Les Paul falls over at Twickenham cuz there’s no guitar stand in the joint! Then when they get to Apple, there’s not a one, and they’re always picking them up lying on the ground! Ringo is seen opening the packaging of the cheapest kind of music stand that exists … and he’s got a kid–on–Christmas–morning smile on his face like this is some treasured gift! How the hell does EMI or Apple not have tons of great music stands?!?!\n\nAnd now, the entire rooftop concert — which no layperson has ever seen, ever — is about to be streamed on this blessed Beatles day, minutes away.\n\n============================\n\n============================\n\nEPISODE THREE — Days 17 thru 22 — January 26th thru 31st, 1969\n\n2 hours & 18 mins\n\nRecording, Rehearsing & Rooftop Concert at Savile Row\n\nTitle cards:\n\n“The Beatles have been rehearsing for 16 days for a live album …\n\nand possibly to stage some kind of a show.\n\nThey have to be finished by the end of the month.”\n\n“The latest plan is to perform on the rooftop of their own building.\n\nThree days from now . . .”\n\n1:24 — Beautiful shot of bobbies on horseback riding past 3 Savile Row.\n\nDAY 17 — Sunday, January 26th\n\n1:30 — Octopus’s Garden – Ringo singing his new song on the grand piano — only the second song he’s ever written (!) according to George. Yay Ringo!\n\n1:55 — George Harrison helps him writing it. So nice.\n\n3:28 — George Martin comes over and listens and mouths harmony.\n\n4:03 — John calls Ringo Richie 🙂\n\n4:25 — John plays drums for Ringo on his song.\n\nRed wine or sherry or scotch or something in bottles on table.\n\n4:29 — Paul is the last to arrive — with Linda and Heather.\n\n4:45 — Heather funny kitten / cat talk – John goofs with her about eating them. 😁\n\n5:35 — Let It Be — Billy back in the studio on piano.\n\n6:12 — George Martin on electric piano.\n\n6:42 — Heather on Ringo’s hi-hat.\n\n7:03 — Paul instructing Ringo on lightening up on the drums. At least according to the film editing, Ringo seems none too pleased with the suggestions. 😄\n\n7:48 — Band jamming on something they called I Told You Before (Get Out Of The Door) — songwriting credited to all four — Paul on drums — Billy on the organ — George on guitar — John on the Fender Bass VI — and Yoko on atonal screeching, which 6-year-old Heather starts imitating. Two versions of this song appeared on bootlegs, a 21-minute jam, and this is from the 8-minute version.\n\n8:50 — John merging Twist and Shout and Dig It (!) — part of this performance is on the Let It Be album. Paul on grand piano, Billy on organ.\n\n9:34 — George Martin playing a shaker!\n\nLots of Heather footage. 🙂\n\n9:39 — Mal dancing with Heather. Mal’s got moves! 🙂\n\n10:13 — Photographer Linda and band photographer Ethan Russell seen sitting together.\n\n11:07 — Blue Suede Shoes – the Carl Perkins-penned song was first a hit for Perkins, then for Elvis. John lead vocal.\n\nPaul on the grand, Billy on the organ.\n\n11:50 — Shake Rattle & Roll – the Big Joe Turner hit, also a hit for Bill Haley & the Comets. John & Paul share lead vocals.\n\n12:30 — The Long & Winding Road — several varying takes, Paul giving instructions.\n\nJohn playing the Fender Bass VI.\n\n13:07 — Linda taking photos\n\n13:30 & 14:06 — Chris O’Dell seen sitting on the floor with Linda & Heather lying down. She has a haircut like Goldie Hawn had around this time, but she tells me it was not intentional and was cut by Linda Cavendish in London.\n\nJ&B scotch bottle in background.\n\n14:33 — George Martin working with George Harrison on acoustic guitar.\n\n15:00 — Paul coaching John on Long & Winding Road.\n\n15:34 — Mal & Glyn trying to fix George’s guitar.\n\n16:40 — the Long & Winding Road that appears on the album.\n\nFunny–cool to see George Martin sitting on the floor in the studio.\n\n17:20 — great long scene in the control room talking about the arrangement of Long and Winding Road.\n\n18:15 — Paul: “The only way I’ve ever heard it in my head is like Ray Charles’ band.”\n\nBilly Preston listening in.\n\nThat looks like Maureen Starkey in the green dress sitting on the floor.\n\n19:30 — DAY 18 — Monday, January 27th\n\n19:30 — Shake, Rattle & Roll again – band rockin out — Paul wailing on the grand.\n\n20:18 — Kansas City (George lead vocal) / Miss Ann (Little Richard song – John lead vocal) / Blue Suede Shoes (John lead vocal)\n\n20:19 — John seen jumping around, crunched down, t-shirt over knees. 🙂\n\nAlan Parsons in pinstriped suit jacket in control room.\n\n21:10 — John & Paul dancing together in control room 🙂\n\n21:35 — George wrote a new song – it’s “happy and a rocker” 🙂\n\nTalks about John’s advice “I keep hearing your advice from 10 years ago saying ‘finish ’em straight away, as soon as you start ’em, finish ’em.”\n\n22:35 — Old Brown Shoe — new great George song – plays on grand piano for band – works out song in real time.\n\n22:50 — Paul dancing to it.\n\n23:30 — Hammond organ brought in — to go with the Leslie speaker (which George puts his guitar through, including on the Let It Be single).\n\n23:35 — Paul on drums – using brushes.\n\n23:40 — George on grand piano.\n\n24:00 — Ringo on Fender Rhodes piano.\n\n24:05 — Billy Preston on electric Fender Bass VI!\n\n25:10 — Let It Be\n\nBilly on electric piano.\n\n26:37 — The Long & Winding Road\n\n28:25 — Trying to get the PA and mics right.\n\n30:20 — Oh!
