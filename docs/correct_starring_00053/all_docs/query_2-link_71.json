        "text": "This week in our Incredible Casting Crew segment is a movie called “Some Time In New York City”. This film is all about the last days of John Lennon’s life but there’s an added twist: there’s a love triangle between John (played by Daniel Radcliffe) his wife Yoko Ono (played by Rinko Kikuchi) and John’s assassin Mark Chapman (played by K. Trevor Wilson). Audience members will be enthralled as they discover how a person can love someone too much!\n\nI wonder if a talented screenwriter and director could write, shoot (excuse the pun), and edit this in time for the 40th anniversary of John Lennon’s death? Maybe if I put my copy of The Catcher In The Rye away, I could get this darn script completed!"
