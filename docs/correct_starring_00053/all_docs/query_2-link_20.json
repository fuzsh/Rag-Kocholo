        "text": "It was much more than a weekend. “The Lost Weekend: A Love Story,” at the Jane Pickens Theater April 13, is May Pang’s record-straightening personal account of her 18-month romance with John Lennon in 1974-75 while he was separated from Yoko Ono.\n\nThe film offers a fascinating immersion into mid-1970s culture. Pang, a New York native and music fan, went from working at Apple Records at age 19 to being John and Yoko’s personal assistant. Engaging and seemingly forthright, Pang recounts witnessing the couple’s arguments and Ono’s controlling behavior. According to Pang, Ono instructed her not to forward calls from Lennon’s young son, Julian, who is interviewed in the film. Pang later helped reunite father and son and remained close to both Julian and his mother, Cynthia.\n\nDirected by Eve Brandstein, Richard Kaufman and Stuart Samuels, the documentary expounds on the enduring myth that Ono, knowing Lennon was having affairs with other women, orchestrated the relationship between her husband and Pang. In 1974, when it began, Pang was 22, 10 years younger than Lennon and 17 years younger than Yoko.\n\nPang confirms that Ono wanted her to go out with John, but once they began seeing one another, the connection was genuine and seemingly healthy for both. They later rented an apartment together on East 52nd Street in New York, where they lived through the first months of 1975 and where Julian was a frequent visitor.\n\nBut before returning to Manhattan, Pang and Lennon had a whirlwind romance in Los Angeles, documented in the film by numerous photographs and interviews. The couple hit the town and frequented the famed Troubadour nightclub. Pang recalls Lennon’s hard partying with a gang called the Hollywood Vampires that included Harry Nilsson, Alice Cooper, Bernie Taupin and Mickey Dolenz, among others. Pang didn’t drink or do drugs, so she was Lennon’s chaperone and a credible witness.\n\nIt’s her story and she’s told it many times before, recounted in many television talk show clips with the likes of Geraldo Rivera. May’s memoir, “Loving John,” from 1983, and her book of photographs, “Instamatic Karma,” from 2008, also inform the film, which includes many of Pang’s celebrated photographs of Lennon from their debauched vacation in Santa Barbara.\n\nThere, Lennon and Nilsson decided to stop drinking and finally record an album. While in the recording studio, Pang describes a surprise visit from Paul McCartney with his wife, Linda, that patched a rift between the former Beatles. Their jam on “Stand by Me” was the last time they recorded together. The song is included in Lennon’s 1975 album, “Rock ’n’ Roll.”\n\nThere’s both nostalgia and revelation in the film, though it reinforces the negative image of Ono. She is tellingly not interviewed, although her voice is recreated in animated scenes to dramatize events that playfully echo Lennon’s whimsical drawings.\n\nThe film is often voyeuristic and dishy; when Pang and Lennon attend the opening night of a musical version of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” Ono makes a surprise appearance at the theater. Pang says Lennon told her not to move from her seat, and Ono ended up sitting alone in the rear of the auditorium. Oddly, there is no mention of the 1975 birth of Lennon and Ono’s son, Sean, or how that impacted any of these relationships.\n\nPang’s touching reminiscence of how she found out about Lennon’s murder in 1980 after he’d resumed his marriage to Ono is a heartbreaking moment, even though we’re painfully aware that it’s coming. The film doesn’t present a satisfactory explanation for why Lennon suddenly decided to return to Ono after claiming to be so content with Pang. Perhaps that’s another story for another film. This one is Pang’s and it’s well worth a listen."
