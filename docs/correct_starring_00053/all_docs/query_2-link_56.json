        "text": "Who plays John Lennon in Yesterday?\n\nAlthough it was kept a secret until the film's release (and not revealed in the credits either), Robert Carlyle plays John Lennon in Yesterday.\n\nThe Scottish actor is best known for his roles in Trainspotting (where he first worked with Danny Boyle), The Full Monty, The World is Not Enough and the TV series Once Upon a Time.\n\nHow did the cameo come about?\n\nYesterday (2019) - John Lennon Scene (9/10) | Movieclips\n\nSpeaking at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this year, Danny Boyle said: “This is what movies can do.\"\n\nBoyle explained that his team asked Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono, who thankfully approved of the moving scene.\n\nRead more: John Lennon's tragic death remembered 40 years later: How the world reacted\n\nHimesh Patel also revealed at a BAFTA screening that the director didn’t let him see Carlyle in full makeup until he showed up. As Jack was about to speak with John Lennon, the actor didn’t know just how much it would genuinely feel like actually speaking to John Lennon.\n\nThe biggest challenge was making Carlyle resemble what Lennon would have been like as a 78-year-old man.\n\n“Writing is very rarely magical or surprising,” Curtis told Polygon. \"But we do all know John Lennon pretty well in our hearts and minds. So as I approached the scene, I just wrote, which I always do, a conversation.”\n\n“I found it was quite easy to imagine what John would it have been like. I’m not saying it’s accurate, but we all read lots of interviews with him and his humour is very clear.\n\nRead more: The Story of... 'Imagine' by John Lennon\n\n\"What I did was just write and write. What have you done? What’s it going? How successful are you? Him teasing about Malick’s success and everything like that. It was hard to decide which bits to keep but, oddly enough, not that hard to imagine how John might talk.”\n\nIn the scene, Lennon helps Jack realise what's most important in life, such as love and life.\n\nDespite becoming a superstar, Jack realises that all he truly wants is Ellie (Lily James), family and friends, and it needed Lennon's words of wisdom to guide him there."
