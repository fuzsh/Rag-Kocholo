        "text": "The Beatles were a 1960s British pop/rock group from Liverpool in England, generally considered among the most successful and influential of their generation. They have several mentions in, and connections to, James Bond films, although they never appear on screen.\n\nThe original James Bond was of an older generation to the Beatles, so didn't like them. In later iterations Bond's relationship to the Beatles evolved, especially in regard to the Zeitgeist. However, even though Bond originated in the fifties, both the cinematic Bond and the Beatles rose to fame in the sixties, representing very different poles of British identity, except perhaps when it came to the matter of girls.\n\nFilms[]\n\nIn Goldfinger, Sean Connery's Bond facetiously suggests to Jill Masterson that:\n\nShortly afterwards, Bond is knocked unconscious by Oddjob, and then Jill is covered in gold paint.\n\nIn the original non-Eon Casino Royale film, Inspector Mathis and Evelyn Tremble meet in a Parisian pissoir in the opening sequence, which clearly has \"Les Beatles\" scrawled up on it in chalk. The film's later psychedelic scenes are perhaps more in line with the Beatles' own style of the late sixties.\n\nThe film of Live and Let Die, introduced Roger Moore's Bond, and with it, the first James Bond rock theme - Live and Let Die - which was sung by Paul McCartney & Wings. McCartney was a former member of the Beatles, and one of their two main song writers. This can be seen as trying to put \"clear water\" between the previous James Bond (Connery) and the new one (Moore).\n\nThe Bond girl Strawberry Fields, played by Gemma Arterton, appears in the much later film Quantum of Solace. This is a reference to the title of a John Lennon penned Beatles song (and also a location in Liverpool before that). Strawberry Fields' death is also a callback to Goldfinger which has the original unflattering reference to the band, because she ends up covered in oil, echoing Jill Masterson's death by being covered in gold.\n\nClassic line up[]\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" line up:\n\nJohn Lennon (1940-1980)\n\nPaul McCartney (1942-)\n\nGeorge Harrison (1943-2001)\n\nRingo Starr (1940-)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Beatles' first single, Love Me Do, and James Bond's debut film Dr. No both debuted in 1962, in October and November respectively.\n\nThe Beatles' orchestrator George Martin also worked on the From Russia with Love theme sung by Matt Monro, and the Goldfinger theme sung by Shirley Bassey.\n\nIn the Beatles' first film, A Hard Dayâ€™s Night, which came out a few months before Goldfinger, a scene takes place in the casino seen in Dr. No.\n\nThe Beatles' second film, Help! parodied Bond, with the chase scene from Goldfinger where the Aston Martin DB5 pours oil on the road.\n\nActor Richard Vernon appears in both Goldfinger (as Colonel Smithers) and the Beatles movie A Hard Day's Night.\n\nIn April 1964, Paul McCartney, visits Pinewood Studios to see the Aston Martin DB5 used in Goldfinger and orders one. See 007 franchise timeline.\n\nIn The Spy Who Loved Me, the main Bond girl is Anya Amasova, aka Agent Triple X. She is played by Barbara Bach, who became the wife of the Beatles' drummer Ringo Starr in 1981, after they had worked on a film together.\n\nThe theme song Nobody Does It Better sung by Carly Simon, was produced by Richard Perry who also worked on two of Ringo Starr's albums. The guitar on it was played by Laurence Juber, who later joined Paul McCartney & Wings.\n\nThe script of Never Say Never Again was worked on by writing partnership Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais (uncredited), who were also involved with the 2007 Beatles film, Across the Universe.\n\nThe title of the 18th Bond installment Tomorrow Never Dies was inspired by one of The Beatles' songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", first appeared on their 1966 album Revolver.\n\nEnglish comedian and actor Peter Serafimowicz's BBC TV show parodied Paul McCartney's Bond theme song by having \"alternative\" theme to Goldfinger \"written\" and \"performed\" by Ringo Starr (played by Serafimowicz)\n\nThe documentary The Sound of 007 features clips of the Beatles and Paul McCartney.\n\nSee also[]\n\nStirling Moss\n\nMata Hari\n\nMadonna who appeared in Die Another Day and sang its theme tune.\n\n[]"
