Richard Lester’s 1964 satirical drama starring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison as exaggerated versions of themselves has been digitally restored in 4K Ultra HD. The Beatles‘ A Hard Day’s Night Criterion collection Blu-ray, which presents the film and several hours of bonus content in 4K UHD with Dolby Vision, was released on Tuesday (Jan. 18).

Showcasing the start of Beatlemania in the States, A Hard Day’s Night takes place one month after the Fab Four’s first performance on The Ed Sullivan Show. The film captures just 36 hours in the lives of the British band that became music idols of a generation.

Beatles pop anthems like “Can’t Buy Me Love,” “If I Fell” and the title track are featured in the film, which is available on Blu-ray ($35) and DVD ($14), and as a three-disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack at major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart.

The Lester-approved, digital restoration of A Hard Day’s Night comes with three audio options: a monaural soundtrack, stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes supervised by Giles Martin, sound producer at the famed Abbey Road Studios.
