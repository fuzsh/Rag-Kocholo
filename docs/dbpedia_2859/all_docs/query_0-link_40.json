        "text": "Facts\n\nRonald Rosenberger and other students at the University of Virginia founded a student religious magazine entitled Wide Awake. This was designed to bring together Christians from multicultural backgrounds as well as promoting tolerance for Christian viewpoints by providing philosophical and religious content. Many of the articles actually did not relate directly to religion, instead covering topics such as racism, contemporary literature, and eating disorders. As a registered student organization, Wide Awake could apply for university financial assistance with its printing costs. When it did, however, the university denied its application for funds on the grounds that it was a religious activity.\n\nUnder university policy, UVA withheld funds designated for student organizations from religious or political groups as well as any other activities that would undermine its tax-exempt status. The money for the funds was collected from students each semester through an activities fee. An organization that would be classified as promoting religious activity was defined as a group that primarily promoted a particular set of beliefs. The editors of Wide Awake argued that this was not an appropriate classification for the magazine, but they exhausted their options in internal appeals to no effect. The dean of students ruled that the funds had been properly withheld.\n\nOpinions\n\nMajority\n\nAnthony M. Kennedy (Author)\n\nWilliam Hubbs Rehnquist\n\nSandra Day O'Connor\n\nAntonin Scalia\n\nClarence Thomas\n\nA university or other educational institution can be considered a limited public forum, and viewpoint-based discrimination against speech is unconstitutional in that setting even though the government has more control than in an ordinary environment. While a university can control content on which it expends its own funds, student organizations at a university are not its agents and are not subject to its control or oversight. The majority pointed out that educational institutions are particularly important in stimulating a diversity of viewpoints and exposing young adults to many cultural perspectives. Its definition of what could constitute a religious organization was overly broad because it would encompass content on secular philosophy and literature, or any content connected to them. The Establishment Clause does not go as far as to force the government to infringe on the free speech rights of religious organizations that are participating in government programs. The government may not provide them with special benefits, but it is not required to withhold the same benefits that are granted to secular organizations. Broadly speaking, the student organizations at UVA were neutral because they embraced the full spectrum of viewpoints. The university also could not be held responsible for or associated with the speech, since the organizations were clearly separate from its official organs.\n\nConcurrence\n\nSandra Day O'Connor (Author)\n\nO'Connor was mostly concerned with explaining why giving an equal amount of funds to religious student organizations would not violate the Establishment Clause. She pointed out that there were limits on the use of the funds, which were designated for third-party reimbursements, that the magazine was independent from the university and was clearly not endorsed by the university, and that the university already funded other organizations that could be said to have competing viewpoints. O'Connor also argued that student control over the funding sufficiently separated it from the administration's control.\n\nConcurrence\n\nClarence Thomas (Author)\n\nIntroducing the historical background of the First Amendment, Thomas argued that James Madison and its other drafters did not intend the Establishment Clause as a sweeping ban on any state programs that support religious activity when that support is part of a larger, content-neutral program. Government benefits may be available to religious groups to the same degree that they are available to similarly situated secular parties.\n\nDissent\n\nDavid H. Souter (Author)\n\nJohn Paul Stevens\n\nRuth Bader Ginsburg\n\nStephen G. Breyer\n\nCarefully examining the contents and presentation of the magazine, Souter argued that its design made its religious message clear. He pointed out that even the articles on secular topic approached them from a religious perspective and incorporated Christian teachings. According to Souter, funding this type of publication would depart not only from the Establishment Clause but precedents during the colonial era, when this type of activity was viewed as violating the separation of church and state. He felt that the Clause should be strictly construed to forbid any direct government funding of religious activities.\n\nCase Commentary\n\nThe Establishment Clause cannot be used by an educational institution to shield itself from liability when it tries to subtly control student viewpoints related to religion by denying funding on the basis that providing funding would violate the Clause."
