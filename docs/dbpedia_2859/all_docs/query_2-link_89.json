        "text": "Join SPS or renew your membership at membership.spsnational.org.\n\nFree Membership with two physical science societies\n\nWhen you join SPS as an undergraduate, you get free membership in two of ten other physics societies... all of which are members of the American Institute of Physics (AIP). AIP serves this federation of physical science societies in a common mission to promote physics and allied fields.\n\nSince you can do this for up to three years, you might consider joining different societies each year and trying out acoustics, crystallography, rheology, geophysics, or optics just to see what those societies have to offer. In any case, SPS is eager for you to see the breadth of physics through these societies, so indulge!\n\nACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA (ASA)\n\nPurpose is to increase and diffuse the knowledge of acoustics and to promote its practical applications.\n\nBENEFITS: The Journal of the ASA online, Acoustics Today magazine, discounted registration at ASA meetings, special events for students at meetings.\n\nAMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICISTS IN MEDICINE (AAPM)\n\nSeeks to promote the application of physics to medicine and biology.\n\nBENEFITS: Electing AAPM entitles me to the Medical Physics online journal and I agree to all rules as defined in the online subscriber agreement located at http://www.medphys.org/agreement_text.asp\n\nAMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PHYSICS TEACHERS (AAPT)\n\nPromotes enhancing the understanding and appreciation of physics through teaching.\n\nBENEFITS: Member discounts on AAPT products, access to members-only portion of AAPT homepage, student registration at AAPT meetings, eMentoring from experienced physics teachers, online access to The American Journal of Physics and The Physics Teacher. Also access to local AAPT sections and more. See www.aapt.org/Resources/students.cfm.\n\nAMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY (AAS)\n\nPromotes the advancement of astronomy and closely related branches of science.\n\nBENEFITS: AAS News Digest and e-mail distributions, notices of meetings and grant programs, participation in AAS meetings at Junior (student) member registration rates, member rates on journal subscriptions, listing in AAS membership directories as “Society of Physics Students Member.” Includes eligibility for the Chambliss student poster competition.\n\nAMERICAN CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC ASSOCIATION (ACA)\n\nPromotes the study of the arrangement of the atoms in matter, its causes, its nature, & its consequences, & the tools & methods used in such studies.\n\nBENEFITS: ACA Newsletter (4/year), reduced meeting registration, right to vote in annual elections, International Union of Crystallographers Newsletter, reduced rates on ACA publications.\n\nAMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY (AMS)\n\nPromotes the advancement of the atmospheric and related sciences, technologies, applications, and services for the benefit of society.\n\nBENEFITS: Digital subscription to the Bulletin of the AMS; complimentary access to all AMS journal content online; discounted meeting registration; networking opportunities via the AMS Online Community; eligibility for scholarships, fellowships, and participation in the AMS Student Conference; priority access to job postings and the career advising portal. Learn more here.\n\nAMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETY (APS)\n\nPromotes the advancement and diffusion of the knowledge of physics and all branches of fundamental and applied physics.\n\nBENEFITS: APS News monthly, greatly reduced registration at APS general meetings, in depth career guidance at meetings and online, join up to two free divisions or topical groups for timely information in your field, one free online APS journal subscription, access to the online APS Member Directory and other members-only websites, and all other privileges of full APS membership, including the right to submit papers to meetings, and vote in elections.\n\nAVS: SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY OF MATERIALS, INTERFACES, AND PROCESSING\n\nPromotes communication and disseminates knowledge in vacuum science, technology, and engineering.\n\nBENEFITS: Access to our online Publication Library, Technical Library, MyAVS, the member-only area, AVS Newsletter, as well as discounted symposia and short course registration.\n\nOptica (formerly OSA)\n\nPromotes the generation, application, archiving and dissemination of knowledge in optics and photonics. The Society’s purposes are scientific, technical and educational.\n\nBENEFITS: Optics & Photonics News print subscription; 50 downloads from the Optica Publishing Library, the world’s largest peer-reviewed collection of optics and photonics information; substantial registration discounts to more than 40 conferences and meetings annually; the ability to network with peers and mentors through technical group affiliations; and engagement with more than 350 Optica Student Chapters all over the world.\n\nTHE SOCIETY OF RHEOLOGY (SoR)\n\nPromotes the advancement and applications of rheology, the science of deformation and flow of matter, and its applications.\n\nBENEFITS: Access to the premier Journal of Rheology, published bimonthly; The SOR Bulletin, published semiannually; discounted registration for at the society’s Annual Meetings; personal and profession growth opportunities through discussion forums and networking opportunities.\n\nThe American Institute of Physics\n\nThe American Institute of Physics (AIP) is an organization of scientific societies in the physical sciences, representing scientists, engineers, and educators. AIP offers information, services, and expertise in physics education and student programs, science communication, government relations, career services for science and engineering professionals, statistical research in physics employment and education, industrial outreach, and the history of physics and allied fields. AIP publishes the flagship magazine, Physics Today, and is home to the Society of Physics Students, the physics honor society Sigma Pi Sigma, and the Niels Bohr Library and Archives. AIP owns AIP Publishing LLC, a scholarly publisher in the physical and related sciences. www.aip.org"
