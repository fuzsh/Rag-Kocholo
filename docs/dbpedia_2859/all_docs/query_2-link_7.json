        "text": "The Vacuum Technology Division (VTD) of AVS is an organization that meets to share new ideas and novel concepts to improve vacuum science and technology. VTD spans a broad range of topics that encompasses the science of achieving, maintaining, analyzing, and measuring vacuum across many applications. VTD promotes publications of recommended practices, instructional papers (shop notes), cutting edge research, and measurement science. VTD strives to push the limits of vacuum technology while making it accessible to all.\n\nAt annual AVS International Symposium, common themes at VTD Technical Sessions include:\n\nVacuum Measurement\n\nGas Dynamics and Modeling\n\nVacuum Pumps and Pumping Systems\n\nPartial Pressure and Gas Species Analysis\n\nVacuum Valves, Motion, Load Locks, and components\n\nParticulate Issues in High Vacuum and Ultrahigh Vacuum\n\nUltra-high and Extreme-high vacuum systems and applications\n\nAccelerator and Large Vacuum Systems\n\nMaterial Outgassing\n\nTechnical Meetings: The VTD supports advances in vacuum technology through sessions, tutorials and topical conferences at the annual AVS International Symposium and Exhibition, which is held each fall. VTD also runs an Ask-the-Expert booth at the Symposium which allows scientists with a vacuum specific problem or question to connect with an expert in that particular field.\n\nAwards: VTD is a strong proponent of supporting the next generation of vacuum scientists. Yearly awards are presented to reward the best student posters and presentations. Additionally, we have an Early Career Award that is awarded to someone who recently graduated or new to the field but is already making great strides in vacuum research. Finally, a Note Award is given for the best \"how to\" article published in JVST B.\n\nJoin AVS\n\nAs a member-driven, interdisciplinary organization, AVS supports networking among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in a variety of disciplines—chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering, biology, mathematics, business, sales, etc.—through common interests related to the basic science, technology development, and commercialization of materials, interfaces, and processing.\n\nMembers choose AVS not only because it is important to their professional development, but for the networking opportunities it provides, as well as a high level of camaraderie they enjoy at our meetings and events. The interdisciplinary nature of AVS offers the opportunity for very unique collaborations in many different areas of science and technology. In addition, AVS encourages your participation in Society leadership roles, offering easy entry into our committees, divisions, and technical groups.\n\nIndividuals obtain membership in the local chapter by joining the national AVS organization. On a national level, AVS provides a number of resources to members. Each year, the AVS International Symposium and Exhibition features more than 1,200 technical papers and draws approximately 3,000 scientists from around the world. AVS National also sponsors several topical conferences that provide in-depth investigation into a particular technique or field. AVS offers journals, books, monographs, and short courses."
