        "text": "As a member-driven, interdisciplinary organization, AVS supports networking among academic, industrial, government, and consulting professionals involved in a variety of disciplinesâ€”chemistry, physics, materials science, engineering biology, mathematics, business, sales, etc. through common interests related to the basic science, technology development, and commercialization of materials, interfaces, and processing.\n\nFounded in 1953, AVS is organized into technical divisions and groups that encompass a range of established as well as emerging science and technology areas. There are also regional chapters, international chapters and affiliates, and student chapters that promote communication and networking for professionals and students within a geographical region. AVS is comprised of approximately 4,500 members worldwide and welcomes all member and non-member scientists, technologists, students, and educators to participate in its national and regional events. Drawing members from materials science and vacuum-related industries, equipment suppliers, universities, and national labs, the Northern California Chapter of AVS (NCCAVS) is the Society's largest--supporting all of Northern California and Nevada with activities centered in the heart of Silicon Valley.\n\nThe concentration of semiconductor and magnetics- related industry in Northern California enables the Chapter to aim programs based on its traditional strength in vacuum technology toward exploring processes used in these rapidly growing industries. Through technical symposia and exhibitions, users group meetings, short courses and workshops, and other educational activities, the NCCAVS provides opportunities for scientists and technologists from the diverse fields that depend on controlled environments to interact and exchange ideas.\n\nUser Groups\n\nUser Groups provide a FREE forum for sharing technical knowledge and leading research, the NCCAVS is affiliated with and assists five technical users groups -- Chemical Mechanical Polishing, Junction Technology Group, Plasma Applications, Photovoltaics, and Thin Films. These groups hold regular meetings during which members give technical talks on current developments in the field followed by a group discussion. Membership in each group is FREE and is not limited to AVS members.\n\nCMPUG - Chemical Mechanical Polishing Users Group\n\nChemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) is a technology used for planarization and surface finishing in the manufacture of silicon wafers, integrated circuits (IC's), magnetic heads and micro-electromechanical devices (MEMS). CMP is recognized as the premiere method for achieving ultraflat and ultrasmooth surfaces when they are most critical, thus enabling many of the advanced electronic devices currently in production. At various steps in the process flow, surface bumps or topography from the underlying layers can cause yield-limiting problems for the next process step. CMP was developed specifically to address these issues. Since its mainstream introduction in the mid-1990's, applications have continued to grow rapidly in both volume and complexity. None of the advanced microprocessor or memory circuits manufactured today would be possible in their current form without multiple CMP process steps. Newer technologies, such as 3D packaging and thru-silicon vias, also continue to leverage CMP for its unique planarization capabilities. The CMP Users Group (CMPUG) was formed in October 1995 to explore the issues and challenges associated with this fast growing technology. The CMPUG's main activity is a quarterly meeting with technical presentations on a topic of interest to the CMP community. CMPUG Website\n\nJTG - Junction Technology Group\n\nThe Junction Technology Group (JTG) formed in 1983 as the Silicon Valley Implant Users Group, focuses on the technologies and process issues related to formation of p-n junctions in semiconductor materials, which include ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, CVD growth and related metrologies for applications in transistors, optical sensors, and photo-voltaic materials. The JTG generally holds four topical meetings a year, including a day-long session at Semicon/West in July. JTG Website\n\nPAG - Plasma Applications Group\n\nThe Plasma Applications Group welcomes all those having an interest in plasma processing. Currently, the group holds thematic meetings directed to various topics relating to plasma processing. These meetings cover new scientific and technical developments, areas of application such as semiconductors, nanotechnology, biotechnology, surface treatment, etc., and include tutorials, world market and economics, intellectual property, and other areas. There is a diverse audience (typically about 60-70 attendees) from industry, academia and young startups. The presentations and the lively interaction that follows reflect the diversity and wide range of interests in our Silicon Valley and worldwide community. The Plasma Applications Group has a LinkedIn discussion board at www.linkedin.com/groups (keyword: Plasma Applications Group) where interactive topical discussions and recent information is posted. PAG Website\n\nTFUG - Thin Films Users Group\n\nThe Thin Film Users Group (TFUG) focuses on state-of-art thin-films deposition and applications for semiconductor and related fields, such as nanotechnology, renewable energy, imaging devices, design for manufacturing, and advanced memory research. It is composed of engineers and scientists from device manufactures, semiconductor equipment venders and universities. The TFUG's main activity is a bi-monthly half-day open seminar from researchers and industry technologists with technical presentations on topics of current interests. Bi-monthly technical meetings and membership is open to anyone involved or interested in thin film processes, including those in device or equipment manufacturing, academia and consulting. These meetings provide an excellent opportunity to interact and discuss problems and issues with others in the field. TFUG Website\n\nJoin AVS\n\nIndividuals obtain membership in the local chapter by joining the national AVS organization. On a national level, AVS provides a number of resources to members. Each year, the AVS International Symposium and Exhibition features more than 1,200 technical papers and draws approximately 3,000 scientists from around the world. AVS National also sponsors several topical conferences that provide in-depth investigation into a particular technique or field. AVS offers journals, books, monographs, short courses, and videos.\n\nContact"
