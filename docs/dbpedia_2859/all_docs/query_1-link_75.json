We also help students get involved with research, attend conferences, and get them connected to different groups at YSM and YNHH working on AI applications to medicine.\n\nContacts:\n\nNisarg Shah\n\nJoanna Chen\n\nConrad Safranek\n\nBeatrice Katsnelson\n\nThe Anatomy Teaching Program brings high school students from the Hill Regional Career High School to learn anatomy at the Yale School of Medicine through student teachers and hands-on learning in the anatomy labs.\n\nExamples of Activities: In this year-long program, visiting high school students receive a short presentation every 1-2 weeks about a specific organ system, followed by a trip to the YSM anatomy labs for hands-on learning. At the end of the school year, after completing the major organ systems, students have an anatomy graduation.\n\nHealth professional students both provide the brief lectures and moderate small groups in the anatomy labs. It's a great opportunity to refresh or review anatomy and to accompany the students in what is usually their first time seeing and handling real organs.\n\nContacts:\n\nIsmail Ajjawi\n\nEliza Epstein\n\nJustin Zhu\n\nAshwin Chetty\n\nJaiveer Singh\n\nEsther Tsai\n\nAnesthesia Interest Group is a student interest group sponsored by anesthesia interest mission is to raise strong interest in anesthesia among the newer students, provide connection between faculty/resident mentors, host events to advertise ongoing, active, exciting research in the department, and also hold a anesthesia simulation workshop where you get to learn procedures like endotracheal intubation, IV line placement and A-line placement.\n\nExamples of Activities:\n\nOne event that has the most interest is our anesthesia simulation workshop. This is mainly run by the anesthesia department here with huge thanks to the residents. We get to learn how to practice endotracheal and nasotracheal intubation, listen to lung sounds to make sure the intubation tube is on the correct space, and learn to place IV and central line.\n\nAnother interesting event we held was a career panel offered to second year students, with faculties from various different backgrounds and specialties talking about why they chose anesthesia.\n\nAnd of course, there is the usual research meet and greet! We invite a lot of faculties (~8) who are all very heavily active in field of anesthesia research.\n\nWe welcome everyone with any kind of interest in anesthesia!! Everyone is very kind and welcoming, and we will provide plenty of free food for the event! We also welcome new ideas, so please don't be shy in letting us know your thoughts! Sometimes, grass is ACTUALLY GREENER on the other side.\n\nContacts:\n\nRyan Lee\n\nAugust Allocco\n\nThe Bioethics Interest Group (BIG) is a student-run interest group, serving as a resource for medical students, and students across Yale University, who are interested in the ethical challenges faced by patients and by those who work in healthcare and medical research.
