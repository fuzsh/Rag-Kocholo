        "text": "AVS has conducted a two-day in-service workshop on low-pressure experiments and modeling for high school science teachers from the United States and Canada since 1990. Attendees are sponsored by regional Chapters of the Society with all expenses paid by the sponsoring Chapter. The workshop is accredited for CEU’s and is aligned with thenational science and mathematics standards.\n\nThe workshop is divided into two parts: (1) lectures on the underlying science and the mathematical calculations and (2) hands-on experience in which a group of teachers perform experiments and develop models under the guidance of an instructor team.\n\nWorkbook (PDF)\n\nVideos, Demos and Experiments\n\nView pictures from a previously held workshops:\n\n2023 – Portland, Oregon\n\n2022 – Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\n2016 – Nashville, Tennessee\n\nUpon completion of the workshop, teachers receive at no cost:\n\nA certificate of completion\n\n1.5 Nationally certified CEU‘s or 150 sixty-minute clock hours from the University of Dayton\n\nA vacuum system for their school identical to ones used in the workshop\n\nTo receive a vacuum system, a school must sign a liability release. Information about the equipment grant and release form can be obtained by e-mail at SEW@AVS.ORG.\n\nJanet began her teaching career in California in 1983. She has taught in several states but found her home in Colorado in 2003. Janet has been the Science and STEM educator at High Plains Elementary School since 2006, sharing science with preschoolers through 5th grade. During her tenure at HPE, she was selected as the STEM Coordinator for Academy District 20 as a Teacher on Special Assignment. At the conclusion of the 3 year granted position, she returned to her lab and has been happily teaching science ever since. She is also a founding member of eleSTEMary, Pikes Peak Coalition for Elementary STEM Education in it’s 10th year now. Janet’s passion for STEM education is fueled by one thing- “It’s all about the kids!” She derives great pleasure from connecting with the community to bring outside experts into the lab. Janet continues her own education and makes it a priority to be in the know on all things science and STEM. Janet promotes engineering and problem solving via her annual Hour of Code event as well as Fairy Tale Engineering during Engineer’s Week.\n\nIn her 15th year of teaching science, Alicia Mauer works at Woodland Park High School. She has worked with diverse populations in suburban and rural areas of the front range region of Colorado teaching chemistry, biology, anatomy, and AP environmental science. She holds a Master’s in Curriculum and Instruction from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and is currently working on a Master’s in Biological Sciences at the University of Northern Colorado. She hopes to teach concurrent college level science classes at Woodland Park High School in the near future. She is passionate about all her classes I teach, but especially environmental sciences and building a community of environmental stewardship through high school students.\n\nAlicia has been involved as a leader for Envirothon, a competition-based environmental science team in which students train with field scientists and study to compete against other teams on environmental problems and proposed solutions nationwide. She believes in providing exemplary learning experiences and has taken students to Sand Dunes National Park, power plants, wastewater treatment facilities, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, and the Denver Aquatic Center to learn from professionals in the field. Alicia says, “My career goal is centered on building solutions-oriented environmental education in our community that will enrich the lives of students, their everyday choices, and perhaps expose them to being involved in careers that help make the world a better place for future generations to come.”\n\nBirgit Landin has been providing community water and energy education and outreach services for Colorado Springs Utilities since 2011. She conducts presentations, workshops, community events, school programs and statewide education forums to engage citizens of all ages in water and energy efficiency and protection. She and the direct potable reuse demonstration team were recently recognized nationally by WateReuse Association for Excellence in Education and Outreach. Birgit holds a B.S. in Geology from the University of New Mexico and has worked in municipal, state government and private consulting on environmental cleanup, water supply and water quality issues for 20+ years. Prior to joining Utilities, Birgit served seven years as a City of Colorado Springs Park Interpreter at Garden of the Gods park. She is an avid supporter of our natural resources serving as a Board Member of the Trails and Open Space Coalition and spends her free time hiking local trails with her husband, two adult children and dog."
