Nowadays, a significant number of the ALD processes employed are so-called plasma-assisted or plasma-enhanced ALD processes. In the last decade, this method has faced a real breakthrough in high-volume manufacturing and an extensive set of processes and reactor designs have been demonstrated. Yet the reasons why and when to use plasma-assisted ALD are often not clear as well what kind of plasma configurations to use and which conditions to apply. Also, misconceptions about the implications of using plasmas during ALD exist, for example with respect to plasma damage and limitations of conformality. This webinar will address these aspects starting with the basics of ALD and plasma-based processing and will range up to the applications that can benefit from plasma-assisted ALD.\n\nREGISTER HERE!\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: AVS Online Short Course: Plasma Etching and RIE\n\nLocation: Virtual/Online\n\nContact: Heather Korff\n\nWeb: https://avs.swoogo.com/avsonlinesct_feb\n\nThis one day version of the course will covers plasma-assisted etching phenomena and equipment in a manner that will assist the attendee in understanding and developing plasma etching and RIE processes.

This presentation will focus on holistic approaches for addressing bacterial infections associated with implanted medical devices. Effective prevention and treatment of infections related to implantable medical devices requires the fabrication of surfaces with long lasting antibiotic character, as the lifetime of the device is related to the lifetime of the patient. Towards this goal, the fabrication of polymers with metal-organic framework additives and the ability of these materials to prevent the attachment of bacteria on their surfaces will be presented. Additionally, methods that first detect bacteria in solution and then “turn-on” anti-bacterial activity will be presented. Multifunctional materials that can inhibit bacterial attachment, detect bacteria, and kill bacteria may prove valuable in long-term implantable materials.\n\nMelissa Reynolds, Ph.D., serves as the Associate Dean for Research in the College of Natural Sciences and is a Professor in Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering at Colorado State University. She received a BS in Chemistry from Washington State University and a PhD from the University of Michigan and worked for a translational biomedical device company before joining CSU in 2009. Her research interests are in improving medical device technologies to improve patient outcomes. Her group is highly multidisciplinary and collaborative working in the areas of metal organic frameworks as biocatalysts, antibacterial materials, and biosensors. She has been recognized as an emerging investigator by the Journal of Materials Chemistry, a Webb-Waring Biomedical Research Early Career Award, NSF CAREER Award and Monfort Award. The group’s research on metal organic frameworks received a 2013 TechConnect National Innovation Award. Her research has been funded by NSF, NIH, DOD, Boettcher Foundation, state funding and corporate funding.\n\nPlease contact Necmi Biyikli or Marco Hopstaken for Zoom details.\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: AVS 70th International Symposium & Exhibition\n\nLocation: Tampa Convention Center, Tampa, Florida\n\nContact: Yvonne Towse\n\nWeb: http://www.avs.org/symposium\n\nThe AVS International Symposium and Exhibition has been developed to address cutting-edge issues associated with vacuum science and technology in both the research and manufacturing communities.

Guide for the Perplexed to the Shockley-Queisser Model\n\nLocation: Virtual/Online\n\nContact: Heather Korff\n\nWeb: https://avs.swoogo.com/avs_solarcell\n\nThe Shockley-Queisser model is a landmark in the analysis of light-> electrical energy conversion by the photovoltaic effect, specifically aimed at solar cells. By defining an ideal situation as reference for actual solar cells, upper limits for conversion efficiency are obtained. What is often missed or misunderstood, is that it is a m o d e l , and as such assumptions are made, five of them. If this essential feat of the S&Q work is missed, one gets titles like “breaking the S&Q barrier” which, given that the model is solidly rooted in thermodynamics, should at least raise eyebrows. By devising a system that does not obey one of the five assumptions, one goes outside the realm of the model. One can ask, so what? Well, the mode, does encompass most types of solar cells and all the practical ones (without concentration).\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: AVS Webinar: Area-Selective Deposition\n\nLocation: Virtual/Online\n\nContact: Heather Korff\n\nWeb: https://avs.swoogo.com/webinar_ASDep\n\nArea-selective deposition (ASD) is a technology that is currently gathering momentum as enabler for bottom-up fabrication. Its main promise is the ability to process material in a self-aligned fashion, thereby eliminating alignment errors in semiconductor processing. In addition, ASD has been considered for alternative nanofabrication schemes in catalysis. By using mature thin film techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a starting point, the development of strategies and approaches to ASD primarily focuses on making the growth selective to specific materials or surfaces. This often involves the selective adsorption of reactant species, or as a more general approach, the deactivation of surfaces on which no growth is desired by selective functionalization. While achieving selective deposition is already difficult, maintaining the selectivity is yet another challenge, as there are numerous side-reactions that could lead to loss of selectivity. In this webinar, several aspects of ASD technology will be addressed, ranging from fundamental surface reactions to technological challenges.\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: AVS Hudson Mohawk Chapter - 2021 Fall Meeting\n\nLocation: NFS Auditorium and Rotunda, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, 255 Fuller Road, Albany, New York 12203\n\nContact: Marco Hopstaken\n\nWeb: ~/about-avs/chapters/avs-regional-chapters/hudson-mohawk/meetings/\n\nAbstracts are now being solicited for oral and ‘poster’ presentations on topics of interest within AVS.\n\nParticipation in a local AVS chapter provides an excellent opportunity to interact in a smaller venue compared to the larger national conferences, affording the participants time to focus on presentations of scientific work that is happening in our immediate geographic proximity, along with ample time for professional networking.\n\nThese local chapter meetings are also an ideal setting for students and early career researchers and professionals to present their research.

Both advances can be achieved by modifying the solar spectrum that enters the silicon solar cell by coating it with a quantum cutting material.\n\nQuantum cutting materials convert each ultraviolet (UV) and blue photon absorbed at high energies to two near-infrared photons close to the silicon bandgap energy. This reduces UV exposure and heat generation, two factors that lower the operation life of photovoltaic systems while increasing power conversion efficiencies. Efficiencies exceeding the Shockley-Quessier limit become possible.\n\nThis e-talk will cover the recent progress in physical vapor deposition of quantum cutting halide perovskite thin films.\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: 48th Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Surfaces and Interfaces (PCSI-48) and AVS Quantum Information Science Workshop\n\nLocation: Redondo Beach, California, USA\n\nContact: Chris Palmstrøm\n\nWeb: https://pcsi2023.avs.org/\n\nThe 48th Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Surfaces and Interfaces (PCSI-48) and AVS Quantum Information Science Workshop will be held at Sonesta Redondo Beach & Marina in Redondo Beach, California, USA, from Sunday afternoon, January 15, through Thursday noon, January 19, 2023.\n\nThe annual PCSI conference is devoted to achieving a fundamental understanding of the physical, chemical, biological, structural, optical, magnetic, and electrical properties of surfaces and interfaces.

Nowadays, a significant number of the ALD processes employed are so-called plasma-assisted or plasma-enhanced ALD processes.\n\nThe reasons why and when to use plasma-assisted ALD are often not clear as well what kind of plasma configurations to use and which conditions to apply. This webinar will address these aspects starting with the basics of ALD and plasma-based processing and will range up to the applications that can benefit from plasma-assisted ALD\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: AVS e-Talk: Surface Microscopy and Microanalysis in an Industrial Research Laboratory\n\nLocation: Virtual/Online\n\nContact: Heather Korff\n\nWeb: https://avs.swoogo.com/avs_surfmicro\n\nThe top few nanometers of a sample is defined as the surface. The surface is where most chemical reactions take place. There are many instances where the surface of materials are designed/functionalized in order to optimize properties and improve device performance; there are other instances where the surface becomes compromised and the material/device performance degrades. Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) are the three most common, and commercially available, surface analysis techniques. These techniques provide complimentary information regarding the composition/microstructure of the surface and sub-surface region of a sample. In this presentation, I will introduce AES, XPS, and ToF-SIMS, show typical data, and discuss how the data helped understand mechanisms and/or resolve material problems. I will also introduce techniques which we do not have in-house,but have access to via external collaborations.\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\nEvent: 2024 Frontiers of Characterization and Metrology for Nanoelectronics (FCMN 2024)\n\nLocation: Monterey Marriott, Monterey, California\n\nContact: James Liddle, Alain Diebold\n\nWeb: https://fcmn2024.avs.org/\n\nThe FCMN will bring together scientists and engineers interested in all aspects of the characterization technology needed for nanoelectronic materials and device research, development, integration, and manufacturing.
