        "text": "Engineering Professor Sudipta Seal was invited to deliver the Alpha Sigma Mu award lecture at ASM International’s annual meeting in St. Louis on Sept. 13. He is the first UCF professor to be selected for this honor.\n\nEach year, ASM International chooses one distinguished member of the materials science community to give the Alpha Sigma Mu award lecture. The lectureship is designed to recognize the outstanding professional achievements of the chosen speaker. Seal, who is also the chair of the UCF Department of Materials Science and Engineering, says he’s honored to give the 2021 lecture.\n\n“I am deeply honored for this award, but I was surprised though,” Seal says. “[I’m] certainly [humbled to have my] lifetime work acknowledged by a premier materials organization like ASM International.”\n\nSeal’s lecture, “Innovation Through Design Strategy: A Material’s Journey From Coatings to Biomedical Intervention,” discussed his life’s work in nanotechnology, including how he commercialized his research. He also shared his current and future research projects.\n\nSeal joins a long list of materials scientists and engineers who have been selected to give the Alpha Sigma Mu award lecture. Bill Nix, an engineering professor emeritus at Stanford University; Subra Suresh, the president of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore; and metallurgist and former MIT Institute Professor Morris Cohen have all lectured in the past.\n\nThe Alpha Sigma Mu award lecture is presented to the Alpha Sigma Mu honor society, which is the international professional honor society dedicated to the field of materials science and engineering. The honor society has a long history with ASM International, which is the dedicated society for materials scientists and engineers.\n\nSeal is a fellow of ASM International as well as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Vacuum Society and the American Institute of Medical and Biomedical Engineering, among others. He is also a member of the National Academy of Inventors.\n\nHis most recent research includes the use of nanotechnology to develop cancer treatments as well as the development of a germ-killing material for face masks and personal protective equipment.\n\nStory by Marisa Ramiccio, UCF Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering"
