Our on-campus observatory features a 24-inch reflecting telescope under a 6-meter rotating dome. We also have an active public outreach program. The Cline Observatory is open to the public for viewing every clear Friday night throughout the year.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Teacher Preparation Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder\n\nAssociate in Teacher Preparation\n\nJamestown Campus\n\nGTCC's Teacher Preparation program helps fill the growing need for teachers in North Carolina. These degree programs are designed to prepare students to transfer to four-year universities to pursue bachelor’s degrees and/or NC Teaching Licenses.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Science, AS - College Transfer - General Studies Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder liberal studies\n\nAssociate in Science, AS - College Transfer - General Studies\n\nJamestown Campus, Greensboro Campus, High Point Campus\n\nThe Associate in Science (AS) degree is designed for students who want to pursue a four-year degree in areas of study or professional programs that require strong mathematics and science backgrounds. Upon transfer, students who earn the Associate in Science degree generally major in fields such as biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, or physics.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Science - Computer Science Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder\n\nAssociate in Science - Computer Science\n\nJamestown Campus\n\nToday, society runs on computer technology. Through the Computer Science pathway, Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) offers the opportunity for students to pursue higher education in the field. GTCC offers the first two years of courses leading to an Associate of Science that will allow students to transfer to a four-year institution.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Engineering (AE) – NC A&T State University Co-Admission Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder\n\nAssociate in Engineering (AE) – NC A&T State University Co-Admission\n\nJamestown Campus, Greensboro Campus\n\nThe Associate in Engineering, NC A&T State University Transfer Program is intended for students who plan to transfer to NC A&T and study either civil engineering or mechanical engineering. In this program, students take general education and pre-major electives at Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC) and then complete their bachelor’s degree in civil or mechanical engineering after transferring to NC A&T.\n\nCivil engineers design construction projects and build systems in the public and private sector, including roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment. Mechanical engineers design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain machinery including motorized systems.\n\nAdmission into the engineering programs is highly competitive, and admission is not guaranteed.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Engineering (AE) Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder\n\nAssociate in Engineering (AE)\n\nJamestown Campus, Greensboro Campus, High Point Campus\n\nEngineering is the application of science and math to solve problems to improve the world around us. The Associate in Engineering (AE) degree program is intended for students who plan to transfer to a four-year engineering degree program.\n\nIn this program, students take general education and pre-major electives at GTCC then complete their engineering program of choice, such as chemical, electrical, bio, civil, or mechanical engineering, after transferring to a four-year school. This program is ideal for students interested in any area of engineering and is designed to easily transfer to all five University of North Carolina System schools that offer engineering programs – N.C. State University, University of North Carolina – Charlotte (UNCC), East Carolina University, N.C. A&T University, and Western Carolina. Admission to engineering programs is highly competitive, and admission is not guaranteed.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Arts – Sociology Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder sociology\n\nAssociate in Arts – Sociology\n\nJamestown Campus, Greensboro Campus, High Point Campus\n\nThe Associate in Arts (AA) degree is designed for students who want to pursue a four-year degree in one of the liberal arts disciplines or training at a professional school that requires a strong liberal arts background. Upon transfer, students who earn the Associate in Arts degree generally major in fields such as anthropology, business, communication, economics, English, foreign language, geography, history, humanities, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, religion, and sociology.\n\nIf you break sociology into its root parts (socio/ology), it literally means the study of society. Auguste Comte founded the discipline in 1832 as an attempt to understand better widespread social changes that were affecting Europe as a result of the French Revolution. To think sociologically, you must engage your sociological imagination which is learning to understand events and actions from a larger societal perspective. While this can be challenging, as you may have no experience with this type of interpretation, it is a valuable skill in today's market: Employers appreciate sociologists' ability to think outside the box and hire them for many different types of jobs. For example, our past students can be found in social service occupations, sales and marketing, and public relations in addition to the field of sociology.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nAssociate in Arts – Religion Placeholder Placeholder Placeholder philosophy\n\nAssociate in Arts – Religion\n\nJamestown Campus, Greensboro Campus, High Point Campus\n\nThe Associate in Arts (AA) degree is designed for students who want to pursue a four-year degree in one of the liberal arts disciplines or training at a professional school that requires a strong liberal arts background. Upon transfer, students who earn the Associate in Arts degree generally major in fields such as anthropology, business, communication, economics, English, foreign language, geography, history, humanities, music, philosophy, political science, psychology, religion, and sociology.\n\nStudying religion provides tremendous insight into the root ideas and expressions of cultures from around the world. Grounded in topic rather than academic perspective, religious studies draw on history, the arts, linguistics, philosophy, literature, and the social sciences to allow a better understanding our human quest for meaning.
