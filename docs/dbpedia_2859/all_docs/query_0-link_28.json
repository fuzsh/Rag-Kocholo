After a broad introduction to all of these fields, you will have the opportunity to specialize your program in one or more areas providing you with a strong background that will enhance your job skills.\n\nThe Chemical Process Industries (CPI) are a major part of U.S. manufacturing and represent diverse industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to large-scale processing of gasoline, waste-water treatment, water utilization, power generation and food and beverage. Working in the CPI represents a particular challenge with regard to handling materials, which range from small quantities of specialized products to large quantities of potentially hazardous materials.\n\nProcess Technicians (PTs) team with engineers and other technicians with specialties such as instrumentation, electronics, or maintenance to adjust and optimize conditions for the production of large quantities of products. The quality of the production is dependent on the skill and knowledge of the Process Technician in carrying out the operations of the plant. PTs must be concerned with issues such as personal and co-worker safety, impact of materials on the environment, and process skills that deal with all aspects of controlling processes and maintaining equipment.\n\nThe LATTC Process Technology program is a member of the North American Process Technology Alliance (NAPTA). The NAPTA was founded for the purpose of ensuring that Process Technology instructors and students are on the receiving end of current industry analytical methods, techniques, equipment and standards. The Alliance is also committed to providing a well skilled employee pool for process, chemical and biotechnology industry employment opportunities.\n\nAt the conclusion of this program, students will have the skills necessary for:\n\nWorking in the refinery, biomanufacturing, petrochemical and other process industry, including water treatment and processing plants\n\nMonitoring safety/health and environmental regulations\n\nSampling and handling chemical materials\n\nMeasuring physical properties\n\nOperating and maintaining process instruments and industrial equipment\n\nUnderstanding process operations using process diagrams, P&IDs, loop sheets and associated documents\n\nUtilizing computer simulations to run industrial operations\n\nTroubleshooting process operations\n\nMore Information\n\nBack to the Top\n\nSenior Care Technician\n\nThis program is currently under review and not available.\n\nThe Senior Care Technician certificate is intended to prepare students for a new role in agencies that provide care to elderly at various levels of independence.

The Senior Care Technician will have a skill set to deal with dementia and other difficult behaviors and help develop and transfer these skills to the direct care staff. In conclusion, the Senior Care Technician will have assessment and care skills that are over and above those of Certified Nurse Aids but below those of Licensed Vocational Nurses. They will fill a niche in senior services.\n\nMore Information\n\nBack to the Top\n\nSupply Water and Waste Water Technology\n\nProjected retirements of existing operators and expansion of the industry will fuel the demand for occupations in Supply Water Distribution. The net result of these shifts will be increased openings for personnel in all areas: plant operations, distribution/collection field maintenance, administration, customer service, line supervision, meter readers, engineers, and plant maintenance.\n\nThe Water Systems Technology program at LATTC offers students a choice of two concentrations within water systems industry:\n\nThe Water Systems Technology program at LATTC offers students a choice of two concentrations within water systems industry\n\nWASTEWATER OPTION offers courses focusing on preliminary, primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment systems as well as disinfection methods, solids treatment, and solids and effluent disposal practices.\n\nSUPPLY WATER OPTION offers courses focused on the operation and design of water systems, wells, pumps and meters; water treatment for potable water; and technical phases of automatic controls, including power and code considerations\n\nMore Information\n\nBack to the Top\n\nVisual Communications\n\nThe Visual Communications program at LATTC is the starting point for exciting careers in animation, art direction, digital imaging, graphic design, illustration, multi-media, web design and other related fields. The fast paced two-year program begins with fundamentals: color, design, drawing, prepress and typography. Advanced levels create finished portfolios on a Macintosh computer, utilizing industry standard digital software. Student portfolios demonstrate creativity and discipline, displaying dynamic art sensibilities and creating visual solutions for problems of marketing and publishing. The Visual Communications program focuses on four core areas:\n\nGRAPHIC DESIGN: Beginning levels will study the areas of layout and design, typography, and advertising concepts. Advanced levels will develop logos and corporate identity programs, design brochures with extended text, and create original magazine advertising, which is directed to specific audience demographics. Problem solving, brainstorming and computer training will receive equal emphasis. Graduating student portfolios incorporate a wide variety of projects showcasing the student’s ability to conceptualize, design and use typography as a communication tool.\n\nDRAWING: Beginning levels will study freehand observational drawing, perspective and the principles of light and shade. Black and white mediums will be explored in pencil, markers and ink. Advanced levels create comprehensive layouts in color marker and pencil as preliminary development. Finished designs and illustrations for advertising and on-line usage are then created traditionally or digitally and serve as portfolio samples.\n\nDIGITAL PREPRESS: Thorough study of the preparation of art, graphics, photography, and typography for reproduction in print. Beginning levels concentrate on understanding the mechanics of color separations and print specifications. This knowledge is then applied as students create digital files that utilize specific print requirements. Advanced levels prepare complex graphic computer files for output at commercial printers.\n\nCOMPUTER GRAPHICS: The creation of art and design on the computer requires mechanical know-how and considerable familiarization with the workings of several graphic software applications. The Visual Communications program offers instruction in Adobe Creative Suites: Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Flash, Fireworks, Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop and HTML. Graduating student portfolios demonstrate familiarization with each of these software applications and an ability to manipulate each for specific uses and creative affects.\n\nToday’s commercial marketplace for artists has never been more available. Flash motion graphics and web design have initiated new and creative directions. Traditional artists and conventional designers continue as before but have incorporated digital software within their accomplished collection of talents. This blending of tradition and technology is the primary emphasis within the Visual Communications program.\n\nBy fulfilling the program requirements, students can pursue many different creative careers. While it is advisable for students to continue higher education, many graduates have entered the workplace upon completion of the Visual Communications program alone, realizing creative and financial success. Graduating students acquire visual sensitivities with respect to type, images and graphics; they are trained in the visual software used by industry, and understand marketing as it applies to commercial art. Additionally, graduates market their work appropriately to specific audiences for freelance opportunities.\n\nMore Information\n\nBack to the Top"
