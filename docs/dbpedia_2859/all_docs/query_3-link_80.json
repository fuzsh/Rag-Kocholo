How operators benefit from our ergonomic equipment or how we secure a minimal impact on the environment?\n\nOur annual Industrial Ideas magazine\n\nfeatures stories about how we innovate for a sustainable future and push technology and society forward together with our customers.\n\nSmart team + Smart phone = Smart product\n\nWhat if industrial manufacturers could adjust the speed and energy consumption of their vacuum pumps from remote, depending on their current production flow? Meet two of the innovators behind the DZS VSD+ dry claw vacuum pump that can be controlled by a smartphone app. This market-leading technology brings cost cuttings and environmental benefits, and competitors are scrambling to catch up.\n\nJoint development is the best way forward\n\nAtlas Copco is part of the â€œWallenberg Ecosystem,\" set up to push scientific boundaries. The dividends we generate contribute to a flow where billions of SEK are granted to research and education, resulting in new insights for the benefit of people and industrial development. In this interview, Peter Wallenberg Jr. explains how it all works."
