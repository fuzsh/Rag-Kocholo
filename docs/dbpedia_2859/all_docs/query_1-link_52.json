        "text": "Definition\n\nLearning communities emphasize collaborative partnerships between students, faculty, and staff, and attempt to restructure the university curriculum to address structural barriers to educational excellence.\n\nIn their 1990 publication Learning Communities: Creating Connections Among Students, Faculty, and Disciplines, Faith Gabelnick, Jean MacGregor, Roberta S. Matthews, and Barbara Leigh Smith describe a learning community as “any one of a variety of curricular structures that link together several existing courses – or actually restructure the curricular material entirely – so that students have opportunities for deeper understanding and integration of the material they are learning, and more interaction with one another and their teachers as fellow participants in the learning enterprise” (1990, p. 19). The authors promote the idea that learning communities can “purposefully restructure the curriculum to link together courses or course work so that students find greater coherence in what they are learning as well as increased intellectual interaction with faculty and fellow students” and that they “can address some of the structural features of the modern university that undermine effective teaching and learning” (1990, p.5). As a necessarily collaborative enterprise, learning communities usually incorporate “collaborative and active approaches to learning, some form of team teaching, and interdisciplinary themes” (Gabelnick, et al., 1990, p. 5).\n\nNancy Shapiro and Jodi Levine (1999) cite Alexander Astin’s (1985, p. 161) view of learning communities:\n\nSuch communities can be organized along curricular lines, common career interests, avocational interests, residential living areas, and so on. These can be used to build a sense of group identity, cohesiveness, and uniqueness; to encourage continuity and the integration of diverse curricular and co-curricular experiences; and to counteract the isolation that many students feel.\n\nThey expand on Astin’s definition to assert basic characteristics that learning communities share:\n\nOrganizing students and faculty into smaller groups\n\nEncouraging integration of the curriculum\n\nHelping students establish academic and social support networks\n\nProviding a setting for students to be socialized to the expectations of college\n\nBringing faculty together in more meaningful ways\n\nFocusing faculty and students on learning outcomes\n\nProviding a setting for community-based delivery of academic support programs\n\nOffering a critical lens for examining the first-year experience (Shapiro & Levine, 1999, p. 3).\n\nFinally, Lenning et al. (2013) define a learning community as an “intentionally developed community that exists to promote and maximize the individual and shared learning of its members. There is ongoing interaction, interplay, and collaboration among the community’s members as they strive for specified common learning goals” (Lenning, et al., 2013, p. 7).\n\nMore broadly, Kuh (1996) describes any educationally purposeful activity, such as learning communities, as “undergraduate activities, events, and experiences that are congruent with the institution’s educational purposes and a student’s own educational aspirations.” In a later study he and his co-author describe a learning community as “a formal program where groups of students take two or more classes together, [that] may or may not have a residential component” (Zhao and Kuh, 2004, p. 119). They cite four generic forms of learning communities: curricular, classroom, residential, and student-type (p. 116).\n\nIn the 2008 publication High-Impact Educational Practices: What They Are, Who Has Access to Them, and Why They Matter, George Kuh states the key goals for learning communities are “to encourage integration of learning across courses, and to involve students with ‘big questions’ that matter beyond the classroom. Students take two or more linked courses as a group and work closely with one another and with their professors. Many learning communities explore a common topic and/or common readings through the lens of different disciplines. Some intentionally link ‘liberal arts’ and ‘professional courses’; others feature service learning” (p. 10).\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat makes it a high-impact practice?\n\nHigh-impact educational activities, such as learning communities, share common characteristics that make them especially effective with students. In Adding Value: Learning Communities and Student Engagement, Chun-Mei Zhao and George D. Kuh (2004, p. 124) enumerate the benefits of participating in learning communities in particular. Specifically, participating in learning communities is uniformly and positively linked with:\n\nStudent academic performance\n\nEngagement in educationally fruitful activities (e.g., academic integration, active and collaborative learning, interaction with faculty members)\n\nGains associated with college attendance\n\nOverall satisfaction with the college experience.\n\nPulling from multiple sources, Lenning and Ebbers (1999, p. 51-52) cite the numerous benefits for college students participating in learning communities. Well-designed learning communities emphasizing collaborative learning result in improved GPAs, and higher retention and satisfaction for undergraduate students. In addition, various studies have verified other significant benefits:\n\nA lower number of students on academic probation;\n\nAmount and quality of learning;\n\nValidation of learning;\n\nAcademic skills;\n\nSelf-esteem;\n\nSatisfaction with the institution, involvement in college, and educational experiences;\n\nIncreased opportunity to write and speak;\n\nGreater engagement in learning;\n\nThe ability to meet academic and social needs;\n\nGreater intellectual richness;\n\nIntellectual empowerment;\n\nMore complex thinking, a more complex world view, and a greater openness to ideas different from one’s own;\n\nIncreased quality and quantity of learning;\n\nThe ability to bridge academic and social environments; and\n\nImproved involvement and connectedness within the social and academic realms.\n\nBack to Top\n\nResearch-Informed Practices\n\nIn looking at high-impact educationally purposeful activities, Kuh (2008, p. 19-20) strongly recommends that institutions “make it possible for every student to participate in at least two high-impact activities during his or her undergraduate program, one in the first year, and one taken later in relation to the major field. The obvious choices for incoming students are first-year seminars, learning communities, and service learning… Ideally, institutions would structure the curriculum and other learning opportunities so that one high-impact activity is available to every student every year” (Kuh, 2008, p. 19-20).\n\nSchroeder and Mable (1994, p. 183) offer six specific principles or themes that should be incorporated in the development of learning communities. Themes one through three are characteristic of both residential-group communities and learning communities. Themes four through six apply only to residential learning communities.\n\nLearning communities are generally small, unique, and cohesive units characterized by a common sense of purpose and powerful peer influences.\n\nStudent interaction within learning communities should be characterized by the four I’s – involvement, investment, influence, and identity.\n\nLearning communities involve bounded territory that provides easy access to and control of group space that supports ongoing interaction and social stability.\n\nLearning communities should be primarily student centered, not staff centered, if they are to promote student learning. Staff must assume that students are capable and responsible young adults who are primarily responsible for the quality and extent of their learning.\n\nEffective learning communities should be the result of collaborative partnerships between faculty, students, and residence hall staff. Learning communities should not be created in a vacuum; they are designed to intentionally achieve specific educational outcomes.\n\nLearning communities should exhibit a clear set of values and normative expectations for active participation. The normative peer cultures of learning communities enhance student learning and development in specific ways.\n\nGabelnick, et al. (1990, p. 51) also offers guidelines for how to create learning communities that achieve the best possible results for learners:\n\nBroad support from both faculty and staff is essential — collaboration must be present from the inception of the learning community development process.\n\nStable leadership and an administrative “home” will ensure a greater chance for long-term stability and success.\n\nSelection of an appropriate design and theme to appeal to students’ academic and personal goals is important. Learning communities should utilize required general courses or pre-major courses, such as pre-law, pre-health, and pre-engineering.\n\nChoose a faculty team with complementary skills and roles.\n\nProperly manage enrollment expectations and faculty load.\n\nDevelop effective strategies for recruitment, marketing, and registration.\n\nEnsure appropriate funding, space, and teaching resources.\n\nGolde & Pribbenow (2000) investigated the experiences of faculty members in residential learning communities, from which they formulated recommendations for navigating the sometimes dicey waters that separate faculty from administrative staff. Some of their recommendations included:\n\nFaculty hold a deep concern for undergraduate education, and wish to know students better. However, some were surprised about the desire of students to be more personal than faculty had expected (p. 32, 36).\n\nFaculty were enticed by the idea of participating in interdisciplinary and innovative education (p. 32).\n\nThey were also both excited and concerned with being accepted into the learning community, both by students and veteran faculty members (p. 32, 33)\n\nSome barriers to faculty participation in learning communities included familiar challenges:\n\nTime — faculty reward system must be addressed and taken into account when expecting faculty participation in learning communities (p. 32)\n\nFaculty had little awareness of, and in some cases little respect for, the work of student affairs professionals on their campus. Similarly, student affairs staff held a limited view of how faculty might contribute in a residential setting (p. 35).\n\nGolde and Pribbenow conclude that faculty are the best recruiters of other faculty into learning community participation, and that it is important to both include faculty in planning efforts, but also to give them well-defined roles within the community (p. 37-38).\n\nThe National Resource Center for Learning Communities website, hosted by the Washington Center at The Evergreen State College, identifies three essential components of effective learning communities:\n\n“A strategically-defined cohort of students taking courses together which have been identified through a review of institutional data\n\n“Robust, collaborative partnerships between academic affairs and student affairs\n\n“Explicitly designed opportunities to practice integrative and interdisciplinary learning”\n\nThe National Resource Center also emphasizes that learning communities should be designed with attention to an institution’s unique goals and priorities.\n\nBack to Top\n\nEmbedded and Emerging Questions for Research, Practice, and Theory\n\nIn their exhaustive review of previous learning community assessment studies, Learning Community Research and Assessment: What We Know Now, Taylor et al. (2003) indicated four key future directions for learning community research and assessment:\n\nIdentifying and assessing a broader scope of learning community outcomes – for students, faculty, and institutions;\n\nExploring the specific pedagogical and structural characteristics that lead to positive outcomes;\n\nPursuing longitudinal inquiry to examine the long-term impact of learning communities – for students, faculty, and institutions; and\n\nImproving presentations and publications about learning community research. Taylor et al. (2003, pp. 65-66) note that studies should describe the learning communities program, its institutional context, and its participants; identify inquiry questions and methods; clearly communicate results and corresponding recommendations; exhibit critical self-reflection; and be accessible to readers.\n\nLenning & Ebbers (1999, p. 88) offer ideas about further areas of study, given that evidence at the time suggested some learning communities are more effective than others, but existing studies were not clear cut in their evidence and were not intended as comparative studies:\n\nWhich student learning communities and combinations thereof are most effective?\n\nHow do we optimize the performance and effectiveness of student learning communities of different kinds?\n\nHow do we motivate faculty to participate fully in student learning communities?\n\nWhat do we know about the characteristics of students who do not participate, and how to motivate them?\n\nThe allocation of resources also raises concerns for the success of learning communities on campus, if universities continue to be evaluated on the kinds of students they admit, rather than the kinds of leaders they graduate. The current definition of quality in higher education preferences schools that accept excellent high school students with excellent ratings. However, there is no value placed on what happens during college. A school could accept excellent high school students and teach them nothing and receive high ratings, while another school may accept mediocre students and teach them a great deal. In the current valuation system, a campus that wants to increase its prestige shifts resources to competitive admissions, not practices to improve learning. These criteria of excellence do little to encourage schools to create supportive learning environments for the diverse groups now in college (Greater Expectations, 2002, p. 17).\n\nBack to Top\n\nKey Scholarship\n\nBack to Top\n\nModel Programs\n\nElon University Living-Learning Communities\n\nEvergreen State College Learning Communities\n\nIndiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis Themes Learning Communities\n\nLaGuardia Community College Liberal Arts Clusters\n\nSeattle Central College Learning Communities\n\nUniversity of Missouri – Columbia Research Learning Communities and Freshmen Interest Groups\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin First-Year Interest Groups and TIP Scholars\n\nUniversity of Washington First-Year Interest Groups\n\nUS News & World Report College Ranking Lists>Learning communities\n\nBack to Top\n\nRelated Blog Posts\n\nView All Related Blog Posts\n\nBack to Top\n\nFeatured Resources\n\nBack to Top\n\nReferences\n\nAssociation of American Colleges & Universities. 2002.
