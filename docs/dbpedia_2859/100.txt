AVS is a membership organization that fosters networking among professionals in the materials, interfaces, and processing communities. This symposium is an international meeting point for them. More than 3,000 attendees and 200 exhibitors gathered together to exchange the latest breakthroughs in science and technology this year. Between main topics were Graphene, nanostructured materials for solar-based applications, atomic layer deposition or properties and application of variety of thin films. The Ruhr-Universität Bochum and its Research Department “Plasmas with Complex Interactions” has been represented by Jun.-Prof. Jan Benedikt, who gave a talk with the title “Deposition of SiOx films by means of atmospheric pressure microplasma jet: the study of deposition mechanism”. The results generated within the project C1 of the Research Group 1123 “Physics of Microplasmas” (FOR 1123) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) were presented and discussed.
