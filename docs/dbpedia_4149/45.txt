“Hiranyakashipu studied the form of the Lord, trying to decide who the form of Nrisimhadeva standing before him was. The Lord’s form was extremely fearsome because of His angry eyes, which resembled molten gold; His shining mane, which expanded the dimensions of His fearful face; His deadly teeth; and His razor-sharp tongue, which moved about like a dueling sword. His ears were erect and motionless, and His nostrils and gaping mouth appeared like caves of a mountain. His jaws parted fearfully, and His entire body touched the sky. His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on His body as white as the rays of the moon. His arms, which resembled flanks of soldiers, spread in all directions as He killed the demons, rogues and atheists with His conchshell, disc, club, lotus and other natural weapons.” (Bhag.7.8.19-22)

Sri Nrisimha Maha-mantra

ugram viram maha-vishnum

jvalantam sarvato mukham

nrisimham bhishanam bhadram

mrityur mrityum namamy aham

“I bow down to Lord Narasimha who is ferocious and heroic like Lord Vishnu. He is burning from every side. He is terrific, auspicious and the death of death personified.”

It is stated in Shastra that this mantra is the essence of all kavacha mantras, or mantras meant for wearing in a kavacha (capsule). The mantra is often written on a small piece of bark, such as from the botch tree. Then it is sealed in the capsule with a tulasi leaf or even flower petals that have been offered to the deity of Lord Narasimha. After worshipping the deity of Lord Narasimha with sixteen upacharas or items of worship, the pujari or priest performs a ritual called prana-pratistha: he calls the Lord to reside in the kavacha. He then worships the kavacha. Then it has full protective power. Men wear the kavacha around the neck or on the upper right arm, while women wear it around the neck or on the upper left arm. The Kavacha may be worn in all circumstances, at any time, or in any place.

30. Lord Narasimha roars loudly and causes others to roar. With His multitudes of arms He tears the demons asunder and kills them in this way. He is always seeking out and tormenting the demonic descendants of Diti, both on this earth planet and in the higher planets, and He throws them down and scatters them. He cries with great anger as He destroys the demons in all directions, yet with His unlimited hands He sustains, protects, and nourishes the cosmic manifestation. I offer my respectful obeisances to the Lord, who has assumed the form of a transcendental lion.

iti shri brahmanda-purane prahladoktam

Thus ends the Narasimha-kavacha as it is described by Prahlada Maharaja in the Brahmanda Purana.

Five Prayers to Lord Narasimha

by Bhaktivinoda Thakura

Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has written five beautiful prayers in “Sri Navadvipa Bhava Taranga” for receiving the mercy of Lord Narasimha. These prayers are certainly assurance to all sincere devotees that the worship of Lord Narasimha is purely in the line of aspiring love and devotion to Sri Sri Radha and Krsna. Those prayers are as follows.

e dusta hrdaye kama adi ripu chaya

kutinati pratisthasa sathya sada raya

hrdaya-sodhana ara krsnera vasana

nrsimha-carane mora ei to’ kamana

Within my sinful heart the six enemies headed by lust perpetually reside, as well as duplicity, the desire for fame, plus sheer cunning. At the lotus feet of Lord Narasimha, I hope that He will mercifully purify my heart and give me the desire to serve Lord Krsna.

kandiya nrsimha-pade magibo kakhana

nirapade navadvipe jugala-bhajana

bhaya bhaya paya yan’ra darsane se hari

prasanna hoibo kabe more daya kari

Weeping, I will beg at the lotus-feet of Lord Narasimha for the benediction of worshipping Radha and Krsna in Navadvipa, perfectly safe and free from all difficulties. When will this Lord Hari, Whose terrible form strikes fear into fear itself, ever become pleased and show me His mercy?

yadyapi bhisana murti dusta-jiva-prati

prahladadi krsna-bhakta-jane bhadra ati

kabe va prasanna ho’ye sa krpa-vacane

nirbhaya karibe ei mudha akincane

Even though Lord Narasimha is terrifying toward the sinful souls, He offers great auspiciousness unto the devotees of Lord Krsna headed by Prahlada Maharaja. When will He be pleased to speak words of compassion unto me, a worthless fool, and thereby make me fearless?

svacchande baiso he vatsa sri-gauranga-dhame

jugala-bhajana hau rati hau name

mama bhakta-krpa-bale vighna jabe dura

suddha cite bhajo radha-krsna-rasa-pura

He will say, “Dear child! Sit sown freely and live happily here in Sri Gauranga-dhama. May you nicely worship the Divine Couple, and may you develop loving attachment for Their Holy Names. By the mercy of My devotees, all obstacles are cast far away. With a purified heart, just perform the worship of Radha and Krsna, for such worship overflows with sweet nectar.”

ei boli’ kabe mora mastaka-upara

sviya sri-carana harse dharibe isvara

amani jugala-preme sattvika vikare

dharaya lutibo ami sri-nrsimha-dvare

Saying this, will that Lord delightedly place His own divine lotus-feet upon my head? I will experience sublime love for the Divine Couple Radha-Krsna and undergo the ecstatic transformations called sattvika. Falling on the ground, I will roll about at the door of Sri Narasimha’s temple.

“May the wide-spread and auspicious nails of the lion-faced God, Narasimha, Who is in the company of His consort Laxmi, protect us. His nails are like thunderbolts and are highly skilled in tearing asunder the lofty mountain-like heads of the herds of strong and intoxicated elephants in the form of demons; the foes of Indradev. His nails are also meditated upon by the groups of devas with their broad minds which are concentrated upon Him and from which the darkness of ignorance is driven away to a great distance and the internal enemies of lust, anger, etc., are torn in twain.”

“Oh consort of Laxmi! Although I’ve made an all round study of the shastras, I don’t find anything equal to You, Who are my master! The thing thought superior to You is therefore flung far and is similar to the 8th tuste (it does not exist). Brahma, Shiva, Indra and their hosts are reduced to ashes by the sparks of fire resembling sparking glowworms and issuing from the curved edge of Your right eye which is filled with masses of wrath.”

(from the Introduction of Sri Hari Vayuh Stuti of Trivikram Panditacarya)

Sri Narasimha Stuti

This is a powerful prayer to Lord Narasimha for one’s protection from the dark elements and demons within this material world. It was written by Pandit Trivikramacharya, a leading disciple of Sri Madhvacharya.

Lord, Your form is all beautiful because you are the master of the goddess of fortune. You reside in the ocean of milk, and You carry the Sudarshana disc in Your hand. Your all-auspicious form is made even more resplendent by the jewel-like body of Anantadeva, the king of serpents upon whom You rest. You are the eternal deliverer from the ocean of birth and death for all those who seek Your shelter and You are the master of all mystics.

I have been bitten by the tens of millions of terrible sharp fangs of the snake of material existence.

Iti sri nrisimha ashtakam sampurnam

Thus ends the Nrisimha ashtakam.

Sri Shanishchara-krita Sri Narasimha Stuti

Everyone is afraid of the malefic planet Shani (Saturn) because generally he is associated with extreme sorrow and suffering. However, Shanideva himself has devised a way of solving this problem by obtaining the blessings of Lord Nrsimha.

Shani made an agreement with the Lord that he would never trouble those who recite his Nrsimha Stuti when they are facing troubles related to dvädasa-añstama-païcama (a situation where Sani-käta lasts for 7 1/2 births)

If one recites with devotion Sani’s Sri Nrsimha Stuti, especially on Sanivära (Saturdays) and when Sani graha comes to 12-8-5 Janma Rsi or 10th AL, one will please the Lord who is the Supersoul of Shanaishchara and the Lord will remove all obstacles and suffering and bless His devotee.

These prayers were offered to Lord Nrsimhadeva by Shanideva, who is the presiding personality of the planet Saturn. The astrological effects of the planet Saturn are generally unfavorable and afflict persons with suffering and misfortune. By reciting this prayer offered by the lord of Saturn to Lord Nrsimha, one is relieved from misfortune and suffering, and one is blessed with remembrance, devotion, and gratitude towards our spiritual refuge and shelter, Lord Nrsimhadeva.

Sri Krishna told Dharmaraja, “Whoever listens to or recites this conversation between Shanideva and Lord Nrsimha in the form of this prayer of devotion will definitely have all desires fulfilled and will always rejoice.”

Lord Nrsimàhadeva is easily accessible to the devotees and punishes those who are evil-minded. He is the saviour for those who are helpless who desire to seek refuge in Him. When the demigods of innumerable planets bow down to His lotus feet, the bright jewels from their crowns are reflected on His toenails which gives the impression that lamps are being waved in front of them. Unto His lotus feet, Sanideva prostrated and prayed (in the court of Brahmä).

Sri Sanir-uväca –

O Lord Nrsimha, please bestow upon me Your merciful side-long glance.

By the word of His devotee named Prahläda, Lord Hari, who is generous and kind, appeared from a pillar and by placing Hiranyakasipu on His thighs split open his stomach with His nails. O Lord Nrsimha, please bestow upon me Your merciful side-long glance.

On listening to the heartfelt prayer composed by Sanideva in the assembly of Lord Brahmä, Lord Hari who is ever compassionate to His devotees, spoke to Sanideva as follows.

Sri nrsimha uväca –

sarva-loka hitävaham ||11||

Sri Nrsimha said – O Sani, I am pleased with your devotion. What ever you desire that will benefit the world, ask for that kind of boon and I will grant it.

SrI Sanideva replied – O Lord Nrsimha, O reservoir of compassion, please be kind to me. O Lord of all gods, let my week-day (Saturday) be Your favorite day. O Purifier of all the worlds, may You fulfill the desires of all those who listen to or read this great prayer to You composed by me.”

Sri nrsimha uväca –

Sri Nrsimha said – O Sani, let it be so! By virtue of My being the universal protector (raksobhuvana), I fulfill the desires of all My devotees. Please listen to My words – let there be no fear of the twelfth and eighth birth positions (and implicitly any unfavorable birth positions) and consequent troubles from you for any one who reads or listens to this prayer to Me composed by you.

Then Sanideva replied to Lord Narahari that he would follow the Lord’s instructions. Then the joyful saints and sages present there (in Brahma’s assembly) responded with cries of, ‘jaya, jaya!’”.
