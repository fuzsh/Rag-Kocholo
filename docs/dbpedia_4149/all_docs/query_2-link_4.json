        "text": "Glossary\n\nशब्दकॊश\n\nAadheenam: ஆதீனம் “Ownership, possession, dependence; institution, premises; Śaiva monastery.” A Śaivite Hindu monastery-temple complex in the South Indian, Śaiva Siddhānta tradition. The aadheenam head, or pontiff, is called the guru mahāsannidhānam or aadheenakartar, who traditionally empowers the scepter of the mahārāja through sacred ceremony. See: Hinduism, Śaiva Siddhānta, sannidhānam. §\n\nAbrahamic religions: The three religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which descend from the lineage of Abraham, originating in the Middle East. They are all based in the Biblical tradition, which holds that God and man are eternally separate.§\n\nacquiesce: To agree or consent quietly without protest.§\n\nactinic: Spiritual, creating light. From the Greek aktis, meaning “ray.” Of or pertaining to consciousness in its pure, unadulterated state. §\n\nadroitly: Skillfully doing something in a physical or mental way; cleverly; expertly.§\n\nadvent: A coming or arrival.§\n\nAfrican Dogon: The native people of Mali. Their metaphysical system is more abstract than that of most other African religions. The high point of their religious life is in a ceremony called sigui, which occurs every sixty years. The ceremony is based on the belief that 3,000 years ago, amphibious beings visited the Dogons from other planets.§\n\nĀgama: आगम “That which has come down.” An enormous collection of Sanskṛit scriptures which, along with the Vedas, are revered as śruti (revealed scripture). Dating is uncertain. They were part of an oral tradition of unknown antiquity which some experts consider as ancient as the earliest Vedas, 5000 to 6000 BCE. The Āgamas are the primary source and authority for ritual, yoga and temple construction. Each of the major denominations—Śaivism, Vaishṇavism and Śāktism—has its unique Āgama texts. Smārtas recognize the Āgamas, but don’t necessarily adhere to them and rely mainly on the smṛiti texts.§\n\nājñā chakra: आज्ञाचक्र “Command wheel.” The third-eye center. See: chakra, inner eye.§\n\nākāśa: आकाश “Space.” The sky. Free, open space. Ether, the fifth and most subtle of the five elements—earth, air, fire, water and ether. Empirically, the rarified space or ethereal fluid plasma that pervades the universes, inner and outer. Esoterically, mind, the superconscious strata holding all that exists and all that potentially exists, wherein all happenings are recorded and can be read by clairvoyants. It is through psychic entry into this transcendental ākāśa that cosmic knowledge is gathered, and the entire circle of time—past, present and future—can be known. See: mind.§\n\nākāśic records: Inner etheric area within the Second and Third Worlds where all events, thoughts and impressions are indelibly recorded. Seers in the First World can read the ākāśic records as one reads from a library. It was in this manner that Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami read the Lemurian Scrolls and supplementary texts and dictated them to a scribe. See: Lemurian and Dravidian Śāstras.§\n\nākāśic wind: Generally, the force or vibration of the guru in the monastery—a sublime yet all-powerful energy which permeates and harmonizes all the other winds. Also names the condition within the monastery force field after the guru has been in residence for thirty-nine days without a break of more than nine days. His vibration then becomes so dominant that, following the rules within this text, he assumes many of the functions of the Senior Minority Group and personally begins to oversee the overall running of the monastery in a dynamic way. See: winds§\n\naloofness: Condition of being distant physically or emotionally; reserved and remote.§\n\nambrosia: The food of the Gods. Anything that tastes or smells good.§\n\nanarchy: Without leadership. The absence of government; chaos, disorder.§\n\nāṇava mala: आणवमल “Impurity of smallness; finitizing principle.” The individualizing veil of duality that enshrouds the soul. It is the source of finitude and ignorance, the most basic of the three bonds (āṇava, karma, māyā) which temporarily limit the soul. The presence of āṇava mala is what causes the misapprehension about the nature of God, soul and world, the notion of being separate and distinct from God and the universe. Āṇava obscures the natural wisdom, light, unity and humility of the soul and allows spiritual ignorance, darkness, egoity and pride to manifest. See: mala, pāśa.§\n\nandrogynous: Being neither masculine nor feminine, or having both female and male characteristics.§\n\nanimal sacrifice: The ceremonial process of killing an animal for religious purposes. Used in Dravidian times to release souls from animal bodies into human reincarnation cycles. §\n\nAntarloka: अन्तर्लिक “Inner or in-between world.” The astral plane. The Second World where souls live in their astral body during sleep and between births. The Antarloka includes: 1) the higher astral plane, Mahārloka, “plane of balance;” 2) mid-astral plane, Svarloka, “celestial plane;” 3) lower astral plane, Bhuvarloka, “plane of atmosphere,” a counterpart or subtle duplicate of the physical plane (consisting of the Pitṛiloka and Pretaloka); and 4) the sub-astral plane, Naraka, consisting of seven hellish realms corresponding to the seven chakras below the base of the spine. See: Antarloka, three worlds.§\n\nartisan: A highly skilled, trained leader or teacher of apprentices. See: south wind.§\n\nartisan-apprentice system: The system of training and organization employed in the south wind groups of the monastery. Each group has one artisan, who works closely with the guru and oversees the work of those in training under him. See: winds§\n\nAryan: A member of the people who spoke the parent language of the Indo-European languages. §\n\nāśrama sādhana: आश्रम साधन The discipline of cleaning the monastery, in order to maintain purity. It also has the effect of cleansing the subconscious mind.§\n\nāśrama: आश्रम “Place of striving.” From śram, “to exert energy.” Hermitage; order of the life. Holy sanctuary; the residence and teaching center of a sādhu, saint, swāmī, ascetic or guru; often includes lodging for students. An āśrama is a meeting place where devotees gather with their guru to learn and practice spiritual disciplines, including the many yogas. Today there are two primary types of āśramas, the coed āśrama, more properly labeled a commune, where the permanent resident facilities provide for both men and women, and the more traditional āśrama, where permanent residents are either strictly men or strictly women. For centuries, Asian tradition has said there is wisdom for unmarried men and women to live separately, and even when the two genders gather to eat, sit and meditate they do so in distinct groups. Women sit on the left when facing their guru and men on the right. A traditional āśrama differs from a coed āśrama, in that the two genders do not freely intermingle. Āśrama also names life’s four stages: student, householder, elder advisor and religious solitaire. See: commune, cult, monastery, monk.§\n\nassimilation: The absorption of nutrients from food into the body.§\n\nashṭāṅga yoga: अष्टाङ्गयोग See: rāja yoga.§\n\nastral body: The subtle, nonphysical body (sūkshma śarīra) in which the soul functions in the astral plane, the inner world also called Antarloka. The astral body includes the prāṇic sheath (prāṇamaya kośa), the instinctive-intellectual sheath (manomaya kośa) and the cognitive sheath (vijñānamaya kośa)—with the prāṇic sheath dropping off at the death of the physical body. See: soul.§\n\nastral plane: The subtle world, or Antarloka, spanning the spectrum of consciousness from the viśuddha chakra in the throat to the pātāla chakra in the soles of the feet. In the astral plane, the soul is enshrouded in the astral body, called sūkshma śarīra. See: astral body, Antarloka, Devaloka, Second World, three worlds.§\n\nastral: Of the subtle, nonphysical sphere (astral plane) which exists between the physical and causal planes. §\n\nastrology: Science of celestial influences. See: jyotisha.§\n\nasura: असुर “Evil spirit; demon.” (Opposite of sura: “deva; God.”) A being of the lower astral plane, Naraka. Asuras can and do interact with the physical plane, causing major and minor problems in people’s lives. Asuras do evolve and are not permanently in this state. See: astral plane.§\n\nattachments: That which one holds onto or clings to with the energy of possessiveness (odic force), which is a natural function of the inner and outer ego of an individual. As one unfolds through the chakras, the force of attachment naturally diminishes through sādhana, tapas and the grace of the guru.§\n\nattunement: The act of coming into harmony with something.§\n\naura: The luminous colorful field of subtle energy radiating within and around the human body, extending out from three to seven feet. The colors of the aura change constantly according to the ebb and flow of one’s state of consciousness, thoughts, moods and emotions. Higher, benevolent feelings create bright pastels; base, negative feelings are darker in color. In Sanskṛit, the aura is called prabhāmaṇḍala, “luminous circle,” or dīptachakra, “wheel of light.” See: mind.§\n\nauspicious: Favorable, of good omen, foreboding well. Maṅgala. One of the central concepts in Hindu life. Astrology defines a method for determining times that are favorable for various human endeavors.§\n\nausterity: The quality or condition of showing strict self-discipline and self-denial; an austere habit or practice.§\n\nAustralian Aborigine: The indigenous people of Australia and Tasmania. In the 18th century, at the time of European invasion, their population was believed to be 300,000 divided into 500 tribes. They believe in reincarnation and spirits.§\n\nautocracy: Absolute authority. Government by one ruler’s force. §\n\navail: To be of use or advantage in completing an end.§\n\navaricious: Greedy for riches; overly desirous of material things.§\n\nāyurveda: आयुर्वेद “Science of life.” A holistic system of medicine and health native to ancient India. The aims of āyurveda are āyus, “long life,” and ārogya, “diseaselessness,” which facilitate progress toward ultimate spiritual goals. Health is achieved by balancing energies (especially the doshas, bodily humors) at all levels of being.§\n\nBabylonian: Of or relating to Babylonia or Babylon or their people, culture or language. Characterized by a luxurious, pleasure-seeking and often immoral way of life. §\n\nBala Muruga: பால முருகன் “Young Muruga.” The form of Muruga as a child.§\n\nBantu peoples: Speakers of the Bantu subgroup of the Niger-Congo family of languages who occupy nearly all of the southern portion of the African continent. This linguistic classification covers approximately 60,000,000 people with extremely diverse cultural, religious, economic, social and political patterns.§\n\nbce: Abbreviation (equivalent to BC) for “before common era,” referring to dating prior to the year zero in the Western, or Gregorian calendar, system.§\n\nbedeck: To cover with decorations; adorn.§\n\nbeholden: Obliged to feel grateful; owing thanks; indebted.§\n\nbhakti yoga: भक्तियोग “Union through devotion.” Bhakti yoga is the practice of devotional disciplines, worship, prayer, chanting and singing with the aim of awakening love in the heart and opening oneself to God’s grace. From the beginning practice of bhakti to advanced devotion, called prapatti, self-effacement is an intricate part of Hindu, even all Indian, culture. §\n\nBhūloka: भूलोक “Earth world.” The physical plane. See: First World, three worlds.§\n\nBon: Indigenous religion of Tibet which, when absorbed in the 8th century by the Buddhist traditions introduced from India, gave Tibetan Buddhism much of its distinctive character. (Pronounced Pern.)§\n\nBrahmā: ब्रह्मा The name of God in His aspect of Creator. Śaivites consider Brahmā, Vishṇu and Rudra to be three of five aspects of Śiva. Smārtas group Brahmā, Vishṇu and Śiva as a holy trinity in which Śiva is the destroyer. Brahmā the Creator is not to be confused with 1) Brahman, the Transcendent Supreme of the Upanishads; 2) Brāhmaṇa, Vedic texts; 3) brāhmaṇa, the Hindu priest caste (also spelled brāhmin). See: Hinduism.§\n\nbrahmacharya: ब्रह्मचर्य Sexual purity—restraint of lust and the instinctive nature. The practice of celibacy accompanied by the performance of sādhana and adherence to dharma. The process of unfoldment through the chakras which is sustained through regulated living in a monastery under the guidance of the guru.§\n\nbrahmachārī: ब्रह्मचारी An unmarried male spiritual aspirant who practices continence, observes religious disciplines, including sādhana, devotion and service and who may be under simple vows. Often used in this text to designate those monastics who are not naishṭika.§\n\nbrāhmin (brāhmaṇa): ब्राह्मण “Mature or evolved soul.” The class of pious souls of exceptional learning. From Brāhman, “growth, expansion, evolution, development, swelling of the spirit or soul.” The mature soul is the exemplar of wisdom, tolerance, forbearance and humility.§\n\nbrāhmin: ब्राह्मण In Lemurian Scrolls, refers to monastics who have never mated, virgins. See: naishṭika.§\n\nBuddha: बुद्ध “The enlightened.” Usually refers to Siddhārtha Gautama (CA 624–544 BCE), a prince born of the Śākya clan—a Śaivite Hindu tribe that lived in eastern India on the Nepalese border. He renounced the world and became a monk. After his enlightenment he preached the doctrines upon which followers later founded Buddhism. §\n\nBuddhism: The religion based on the teachings of Siddhārtha Gautama, known as the Buddha (CA 624–544 BCE). He refuted the idea of man’s having an immortal soul and did not preach of any Supreme Deity. Instead he taught that man should seek to overcome greed, hatred and delusion and attain enlightenment through realizing the Four Noble Truths and following the Eightfold Path. Prominent among its holy books is the Dhammapada. Buddhism arose out of Hinduism as an inspired reform movement which rejected the caste system and the sanctity of the Vedas. It is thus classed as nāstika, “unbeliever,” and is not part of Hinduism. Buddhism eventually migrated out of India, the country of its origin, and now enjoys a following of over 350 million, mostly in Asia. See: Hinduism.§\n\nCarbonaceous chondrite: A stony meteorite containing material associated with life, possible microfossils, amino acids, etc. Some researchers believe this to be evidence of extraterrestrial biological origin.§\n\nce: Abbreviation for “common era.” Equivalent to the abbreviation AD. Following a date, it indicates that the year comes after the year zero in the Western, or Gregorian calendar, system.§\n\ncelestial: “Of the sky or heavens.” Of or relating to the heavenly regions or beings. Highly refined, divine.§\n\nCentral Sun: The center that each galaxy revolves around which emits life-giving rays and contains an opposite force to each sun within each solar system. Scientific evidence indicates that at our galactic center is a massive black hole, an “object” that sucks matter into it and has a mass two to four million times greater than our sun. Because of the center’s strong gravitational pull, all matter in the galaxy is caused to move in a circular orbit around it. At the same time, science has discovered, the galactic nucleus is emitting a bright radio source, infrared radiation and x-rays, which Vedic knowledge tells us are indications of the energy rays that sustain and nurture all life and intelligence. Around the nucleus is a large “bulge” of intense light, caused by a dense cluster of stars held in a spherical shape near this black hole, giving the dark galactic center the appearance which is likened to a brilliant sun. The Central Sun is presently obscured from optical wavelengths by a thick screen of intervening dust composed of more than 50 different molecules, including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde. Lemurian Scrolls explain that the obscuration or release of the life-giving rays emitted from the Central Sun, as our Milky Way Galaxy moves around its center, causes the four yugas to be experienced by our solar system. Our galaxy is estimated by scientists to span a diameter of 75,000 light years, containing 400 billion suns. An estimated 1.3 billion of these suns are thought to have planets revolving around them, comprising solar systems. From our solar system, the Central Sun is approximately 30,000 light years away, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. See: Cosmic Sun.§\n\ncessation: A stopping for some time.§\n\nchakra: चक्र “Wheel.” Any of the nerve plexes or centers of force and consciousness located within the inner bodies of man. In the physical body there are corresponding nerve plexuses, ganglia and glands. The seven principal chakras can be seen psychically as colorful, multi-petaled wheels or lotuses. They are situated along the spinal cord from the base to the cranial chamber. Additionally, seven chakras, barely visible, exist below the spine. They are seats of instinctive consciousness, the origin of jealousy, hatred, envy, guilt, sorrow, etc. They constitute the lower or hellish world, called Naraka or pātala. Thus, there are 14 major chakras in all. The seven upper chakras, from lowest to highest, are: 1) mūlādhāra (base of spine): memory, time and space; 2) svādhishṭhāna (below navel): reason; 3) maṇipūra (solar plexus): willpower; 4) anāhata (heart center): direct cognition; 5) viśuddha (throat): divine love; 6) ājñā (third eye): divine sight; 7) sahasrāra (crown of head): illumination, Godliness. The seven lower chakras, from highest to lowest, are 1) atala (hips): fear and lust; 2) vitala (thighs): raging anger; 3) sutala (knees): retaliatory jealousy; 4) talātala (calves): prolonged mental confusion; 5) rasātala (ankles): selfishness; 6) mahātala (feet): absence of conscience; 7) pātala (located in the soles of the feet): murder and malice.§\n\nchakram: A magnetic center or source of spiritual power. In this text, a group of people working together and concentrating on the darshan so persistently that their bones became a channel for the Deity and His devas to send forth cosmic energy. See: cosmic energy, darshan.§\n\ncharyā pāda: चर्यापाद “Conduct stage.” Stage of service and character building. See: pāda, Śaiva Siddhānta, Śaivism.§\n\nchaturyuga: Cycle of the four yugas: Sat, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, making a total of 4.32 million years. See: cosmic cycle, yuga.§\n\ncircle: One year, the circle of the Earth around the sun.§\n\ncitation: A quoted passage.§\n\nclairaudience: “Clear-hearing.” Psychic or divine hearing, divyaśravana. The ability to hear the inner currents of the nervous system, the Aum and other mystic tones. Hearing in one’s mind the words of inner-plane beings or earthly beings not physically present. See: psychic.§\n\nclairvoyance: “Clear-seeing.” Psychic or divine seeing; the ability to have visions. Seeing inner-plane beings, or earthly beings not physically present. See: psychic.§\n\nclamor: A loud outcry usually expressing discontent or protest.§\n\nclan: A group of people with common interests; family.§\n\ncleave: To split; separate. As used in this text, to separate from the whole.§\n\ncohabitation: Living together and having sexual relations outside of wedlock, often known as commonlaw marriage. §\n\ncommune: To communicate closely, sharing thoughts, feelings or prayers in an intimate way. To be in close rapport. Also a community of people living together and sharing in work, earning, etc. In modern-day practice, communes, which are often called āśramas, have become places where seekers strive to balance the male and female energies by mingling together, residing in the same or adjoining rooms. Unlike āśrama residents, commune inmates sit at random while learning, singing and eating. Members are not necessarily celibate, and may form temporary or long term relationships with other members. Marriages are often open to freedom in intimate relationship with others. Residents are generally of various faiths and religious backgrounds, whereas a traditional āśrama is Hindu based. See: āśrama, cult, monastery, monk.§\n\ncomprehensive: Including a large scope of things; showing extensive understanding.§\n\nconclave: A secret or confidential meeting.§\n\nconglomerate: A group of things.§\n\nconscious mind: The external, everyday state of consciousness. See: mind.§\n\nconsciousness: Chitta or chaitanya. 1) A synonym for mind-stuff, chitta; or 2) the condition or power of perception, awareness, apprehension. There are myriad gradations of consciousness, from the simple sentience of inanimate matter to the consciousness of basic life forms, to the higher consciousness of human embodiment, to omniscient states of superconsciousness, leading to immersion in the One universal consciousness, Parāśakti. See: mind.§\n\nconsensualocracy: Government by intelligent cooperation, based on a shared vision and adherence to dharma. Ahiṁsā, nonhurtfulness—spiritually, physically, emotionally and mentally—is the keynote of this tribal/family system of rule. §\n\ncontinuum: A continuous whole, quantity, or series; thing whose parts cannot be separated or separately discerned.§\n\ncorporacracy: Modern corporate government wherein multi-national conglomerates influence governments by the power of business, legal and monetary might. §\n\ncosmic cycle: One of the infinitely recurring periods of the universe. These cycles are measured in periods of progressive ages. The smaller cycles, called yugas, are known as the Sat (also Satya or Kṛita), Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, which repeat themselves in that order, with the Sat Yuga being the longest and the Kali Yuga the shortest. The comparison is often made of these ages with the cycles of the day: Sat Yuga being morning until noon, the period of greatest light or enlightenment, Tretā Yuga afternoon, Dvāpara evening, and Kali Yuga the darkest part of the night. Four yugas equal one chaturyuga. Theories vary, but by traditional astronomical calculation, a chaturyuga equals 4,320,000 solar years (or 12,000 “divine years;” one divine year is 360 solar years)—with the Sat Yuga lasting 1,728,000 years, Tretā Yuga 1,296,000 years, Dvāpara Yuga 864,000 years, and Kali Yuga 432,000 years. By current, traditional dating, mankind is now experiencing the Kali Yuga, which began at midnight, February 18, 3102 BCE (year one on the Hindu calendar) and will end in approximately 427,000 years. According to Lemurian Scrolls, we are actually in the Sat Yuga, which began when man learned to light the night by his own devices, marked by the inventions of Thomas Edison in 1879. A partial dissolution, called laya, occurs at the end of each manvantara, when the physical world is destroyed by flood and fire. Each destructive period is followed by the succession of creation (sṛishṭi), evolution or preservation (sthiti) and dissolution (laya). A summary of the periods in the cosmic cycles: one chaturyuga = 4,320,000 years (four yugas); 71 chaturyugas = one manvantara or manu; 14 manvantaras = one kalpa or day of Brahmā; two kalpas = one ahoratra or day and night of Brahmā; 360 ahoratras = one year of Brahmā; 100 Brahmā years = 309,173,760,000,000 years (one “lifetime” of Brahmā, or the universe). By traditional Hindu reckoning, chanted by priests daily the world over at the start of any pūjā, we are in the 28th chatur-yuga of the seventh manvantara of the 51st year of Brahmā. Lemurian Scrolls, by our study as detailed in the Timeline, numbers time’s cycles back only to mankind’s arrival on Earth, indicating that we have just entered the first Sat Yuga of the fourth manvantara. There are smaller cycles of yugas spoken of by Sri Yukteswar, the guru of Swami Paramahansa Yogananda. In the introduction to his sūtras in The Holy Science, Sri Yukteswar explains a cycle of the four yugas that totals only 24,000 years, which puts us in a period of the early Dvāpara Yuga. This cycle, he says, is caused by our solar system’s revolving around another “fixed star” as they both revolve around the galactic center, similar to the moon circling the Earth as it goes around the Sun. When our solar system is on the side of the star closest to the Central Sun, we experience the Sat Yuga. As we revolve to the farthest position from the Central Sun (which takes 12,000 years), we gradually descend into the Kali Yuga. Then we slowly revolve back again to the closest side of the orbit, experiencing the yugas in reverse (from Kali to Dvāpara, Tretā, Sat) for another 12,000 years. Sri Yukteswar mistakenly attributed this 24,000 year orbit as the cause of the precession of the equinoxes, which today science knows is caused by the earth’s wobble on its axis and calculates to be a 25,900 year cycle. ¶Hindu wisdom tells us that at the end of every kalpa or day of Brahmā, a greater dissolution, called pralaya (or kalpanta, “end of an eon”), occurs when both the physical and subtle worlds are absorbed into the causal world, where souls rest until the next kalpa begins. This state of withdrawal or “night of Brahmā,” continues for the length of an entire kalpa until creation again issues forth. After 36,000 of these dissolutions and creations there is a total, universal annihilation, mahāpralaya, when all three worlds, all time, form and space, are withdrawn into God Śiva. After a period of total withdrawal a new universe or lifespan of Brahmā begins. This entire cycle repeats infinitely. This view of cosmic time is recorded in the Purāṇas and the Dharma Śāstras. See: yuga, chaturyuga, manvantara. §\n\ncosmic rays: Rays from the Central Sun.§\n\nCosmic Sun: The Cosmic Sun is the ever-present, one spiritual Sun and source of life-giving rays that emanate out of each galactic Central Sun and which are also all-pervasive and within everything. The Cosmic Sun, also called the Universal Sun, exists at the most subtle level of creation at the core of existence, on the brink of the Absolute. The Cosmic Sun is also the timeless, causeless, spaceless, formless power, existence and nonexistence that sustains all form, is detached from it but because of its existence within everything—atom, molecule and quantum—is present everywhere at all points of time and space as the sustainer of the causes of the changing forms within it. This mystery has to be realized to be known—Absolute reality versus the relatively real. That is the mystery. See: Central Sun.§\n\nculminate: To reach the highest point; climax.§\n\ncult: From cultus meaning care, cultivation. A system of worship or ritual. A religious sect or group. The word cult is used freely within the broad base of Sanātana Dharma as the name of a sub-sect of one of its many denominations. The modern news media chose this word to describe certain communes that began to arise in the US in the early 1960s led by charismatic and often autocratic leaders. It has become a buzz word to degradate groups, claiming their leaders demand blind obedience and brainwash their followers, often against their will or better judgment. Certain of such cults are truly harmful. Cult has been humorously and more accurately defined as “a small religious group one doesn’t like.” The common definition of cult would apply equally to the Catholic Church, the Army, Navy, Marines and the Boy and Girl Scouts. This is directly opposed to the educated original meaning of cult, which implies a familial group whose leader requires intelligent cooperation and group acceptance as they move forward in their worship and service. See: āśrama, monastery, maṭha, commune.§\n\ncycle: In Lemurian Scrolls, three years, or three circles of the Earth around the sun.§\n\nDarshan (darśana): दर्शन “Vision, sight.” Seeing the Divine. Beholding, with inner or outer vision, a temple image, Deity, holy person or place, with the desire to inwardly contact and receive the grace and blessings of the venerated being or beings. Also: “point of view,” doctrine or philosophy. Darshan is also the feeling of the emotions of a holy person, the intellect, the spiritual qualities that he has attained, and most importantly the śakti, the power, that has changed him and is there constantly to change others. Darshan encompasses the entirety of the being of a person of spiritual attainment. Darshan is the emanating rays from the depth of an enlightened soul’s being. These rays pervade the room in which he is, penetrating the aura of the devotees and enlivening the kuṇḍalinī, the white, fiery, vapor-like substance that is actually the heat of the physical body in its natural state. ¶Hindus consider that when you are in the presence of the guru that his seeing of you and therefore knowing you and your karmas is another grace. So, darshan is a two-edged sword, a two-way street. It is a process of seeing and being seen. The devotee is seeing and in that instant drawing forth the blessings of the satguru, the swāmī or the sadhu. In turn, they are seeing the devotee and his divine place in the universe. The sense of separation is transcended, so there is a oneness between seer and seen. Darshan is physical, mental, emotional, spiritual perception. Hindus believe that the darshan from a guru who has realized the Self can clear the subconscious mind of a devotee in minutes, alleviating all reaction to past actions and alter his perspective from an outer to an inner one. Seeing is such a powerful dimension of life, and it affects us in so many ways, inside and out. Darshan, in the true meaning of this mystical, complex and most esoteric word, conveys all of this. See: Disseminating the darshan, Hinduism. §\n\nDarwin’s theory: Theory of evolution developed by Charles Darwin (1809–1882) stating that plant and animal species develop or evolve from earlier forms due to hereditary transmission of variations that enhance the organism’s adaptability and chances of survival. See: evolution of the soul.§\n\ndeem: To have as an opinion; judge.§\n\ndeified: To be made into a God.§\n\nDeity: “God.” Can refer to the image or mūrti installed in a temple or to the Mahādeva the mūrti represents.

Essentially, dharma is the orderly fulfillment of an inherent nature or destiny. Relating to the soul, it is the mode of conduct most conducive to spiritual advancement, the right and righteous path.§\n\ndictate: A guiding principle or command; to command or give with authority.§\n\ndictatorship: Government by a ruler with absolute authority, generally implemented with military force. §\n\ndīkshā: दीक्षा “Initiation.” Action or process by which one is entered into a new realm of spiritual knowledge and practice by a teacher or preceptor through the transmission of blessings. Denotes initial or deepened connection with the teacher and his lineage and is usually accompanied by ceremony. Initiation, revered as a moment of awakening, may be bestowed by a touch, a word, a look or a thought. Most Hindu schools, and especially Śaivism, teach that only with initiation from a satguru is enlightenment attainable. Sought after by all Hindus is the dīkshā called śaktipāta, “descent of grace,” which, often coming unbidden, stirs and arouses the mystic kuṇḍalinī force. See: Hinduism.§\n\ndiminution: A lessening or reduction.

In modern times it refers to the various Caucasoid peoples of southern India and northern Sri Lanka. From the Sanskṛit Drāviḍa, of which it is believed the original form was Dramid (or Dramil), which meant “sweet” or “good natured,” and is the source of the word Tamil, naming the Dravidian people of South India and Sri Lanka and their language.§\n\ndual: Having or composed of two parts or kinds. —duality: A state or condition of being dual. —realm of duality: The phenomenal world, where each thing exists along with its opposite: joy and sorrow, etc.§\n\nDvāpara Yuga: द्वापरयुग “The age of two” or era of duality; third of the four yugas, or eras, consisting of 864,000 years, during which the light of the Central Sun is reduced by one-half. The era of impending darkness prior to the Kali Yuga. It is compared to the afternoon and evening of a day. See: yuga, cosmic cycle.§\n\ndwindle: To become gradually less and less until little is left; decrease.§\n\nEast wind: The group within a monastery who give forth the teachings as their primary duty. The particular vibration of this realm of human activity.§\n\nego: The external personality or sense of “I” and “mine.” Broadly, individual identity.

Enlightenment is the experience-nonexperience resulting in the realization of one’s transcendent Self—Paraśiva—which exists beyond time, form and space. Each tradition has its own understanding of enlightenment, often indicated by unique terms. See: enstasy, kuṇḍalinī, nirvikalpa samādhi, Paraśiva, samādhi, Self Realization.§\n\nenstasy: A term coined in 1969 by Mircea Eliade to contrast the Eastern view of bliss as “standing inside oneself” (enstasy) with the Western view as ecstasy, “standing outside oneself.” A word chosen as the English equivalent of samādhi. See: enlightenment, nirvikalpa samādhi, samādhi, Self Realization.§\n\nentanglements: See: psychic tubes.§\n\nenthrone: To give the highest place to; exalt.§\n\nentourage: A group of accompanying attendants, associates or assistants.§\n\neon: An indefinitely long period of time; an age.

See: fibrous body, original body.§\n\nevoke: To call forth; summon.§\n\nevolution: A process of change, development or unfoldment. See: evolution of the soul, karma, Darwin’s theory.§\n\nevolution of the soul: Adhyātma prasāra. In monistic Śaiva Siddhānta, Advaita Īśvaravāda philosopy, the soul’s evolution is a progressive unfoldment, growth and maturing toward its inherent, divine destiny, which is complete merger with Śiva (viśvagrāsa). In its essence, each soul is ever perfect. But as an individual soul body emanated by God Śiva, it is like a small seed yet to develop. As an acorn needs to be planted in the dark underground to grow into a mighty oak tree, so must the soul unfold out of the darkness of the malas to full maturity and realization of its innate oneness with God. The soul is not created at the moment of conception of a physical body. Rather, it is created in the Śivaloka. It evolves by taking on denser and denser sheaths—cognitive, instinctive-intellectual and prāṇic—until finally it takes birth in physical form in the Bhūloka. Then it experiences many lives, maturing through the reincarnation process. Thus, from birth to birth, souls learn and mature. See: liberation, mala, reincarnation, Śaiva Siddhānta, soul, viśvagrāsa.§\n\nexternalized: Preoccupation; awareness temporarily cut off from superconsciousness. A condition monastics seek to avoid through their sādhana and tapas; allowing awareness to become involved in outer life to the exclusion of one’s inner life and goals, spiritual unfoldment, purification, transmutation, obedience to the guru and worship of the Deities. §\n\nextraterrestrial: Existing, taking place, or coming from outside the limits of Earth. §\n\nexude: To discharge or emit gradually. To show in abundance.§\n\nFacilitate: To make easy or easier; help; guide. §\n\nfaring: Condition or status, as in, “He fared well during the journey.”§\n\nfibrous body: The first physical bodies that souls lived in after first arriving on Earth. In these bodies, produced out of the kuṇḍalinī force and the intake of herbal essence, fruits and flowers, souls were able to fly in the atmosphere. These original bodies had a high oil content, were very pliable, neither male nor female. Nor did they sleep or experience heat, cold or fear. See: etheric body, original body.§\n\nFirst World: The physical universe, called Bhūloka, of gross or material substance in which phenomena are perceived by the five senses. See: Bhūloka, three worlds.§\n\nforbearance: Self-control; responding with patience and compassion, especially under provocation. Endurance; tolerance.§\n\nforce field: The cumulative energy surrounding a monastery, sannidhanam in Tamil; a spiritual shield which protects the monastery and its residents from astral and physical intrusion. Built up through worship, invoking of the Deities, sādhana, tapas and disciplined living.§\n\nfortitude: The strength to bear misfortune, pain, etc., calmly and patiently; courage.§\n\nGaṇeśa: गणेश “Lord of Categories.” (From gaṇ, “to count or reckon,” and Īśa, “lord.”) Or: “Lord of attendants (gaṇa),” synonymous with Gaṇapati. Gaṇeśa is a Mahādeva, the beloved elephant-faced Deity honored by Hindus of every sect, first son of Śiva and brother of Kārttikeya. He is the Lord of Obstacles (Vighneśvara), revered for His great wisdom and invoked first before any undertaking, for He knows all intricacies of each soul’s karma and the perfect path of dharma that makes action successful. He sits on the mūlādhāra chakra and is easy of access. See: Hinduism, Mahādeva.§\n\nGenesis: The first book of the Bible, giving the Abrahamic account of creation and a history of the patriarchs.§\n\nglacierous: Of or relating to glaciers, huge masses of flowing ice; in the area of glaciers.§\n\nGods: Mahādevas, “great beings of light.” The plural form of God refers to extremely advanced beings existing in their self-effulgent soul bodies in the causal plane. The meaning of Gods is best seen in the phrase, “God and the Gods,” referring to the Supreme God—Śiva—and the Mahādevas who are His creation. See: Mahādeva.§\n\ngrace: “Benevolence, love, giving,” from the Latin gratus, “beloved, agreeable.” God’s power of revealment, anugraha śakti (“kindness, showing favor”), by which souls are awakened to their true, Divine nature. Grace in the unripe stages of the spiritual journey is experienced by the devotee as receiving gifts or boons, often unbidden, from God. The mature soul finds himself surrounded by grace. He sees all of God’s actions as grace, whether they be seemingly pleasant and helpful or not.§\n\nguru: गुरु “Weighty one,” indicating a being of great knowledge or skill. A term used to describe a teacher or guide in any subject, such as music, dance, sculpture, but especially religion. For clarity, the term is often preceded by a qualifying prefix. Hence, terms such as kulaguru (family teacher), vīṇāguru (vīṇā teacher) and satguru (spiritual preceptor). According to the Advayatāraka Upanishad (14–18), guru means “dispeller (gu) of darkness (ru).” He who Knows and can guide the spiritual aspirant to that Knowing. See: satguru.§\n\nguru tapas: गुरुतपस् The discipline of working directly under the guidance of the guru in intelligent cooperation, by which inner teachings are conveyed and monastics learn to merge their mind with that of their preceptor.§\n\nHairsplitting: The making of unreasonably or extremely fine distinctions.§\n\nHanumān: हनुमान् In this text, the member of the senior minority group, second in resident seniority, whose main duty is to convey messages to groups.

Also called Sanātana Dharma, “eternal religion” and Vaidika Dharma, “religion of the Vedas.” Hinduism is the world’s most ancient religion and encompasses a broad spectrum of philosophies ranging from pluralistic theism to absolute monism. It is a family of myriad faiths with four primary denominations: Śaivism, Vaishṇavism, Śāktism and Smārtism. These four hold such divergent beliefs that each is a complete and independent religion. Yet, they share a vast heritage of culture and belief—karma, dharma, reincarnation, all-pervasive Divinity, temple worship, sacraments, manifold Deities, the guru-śishya tradition and a reliance on the Vedas as scriptural authority. From the rich soil of Hinduism long ago sprang various other traditions. Among these were Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism, which rejected the Vedas and thus emerged as completely distinct religions, disassociated from Hinduism, while still sharing many philosophical insights and cultural values with their parent faith. See: Sanātana Dharma.§\n\nHomo sapiens: The Latin name of the species which is modern man.§\n\nHyperborean: One of a mythical people known to the ancient Greeks from earliest times, living in a perpetually warm and sunny land near the North Pole.§\n\nImminent: Likely to happen without delay; impending. §\n\nimpart: To give a share or portion of; give; reveal.§\n\nimperceptive: Not able to see or perceive.§\n\nimpregnate: To saturate or fill; permeate.§\n\nincantation: Recitation of verbal charms or spells to produce a magic effect.§\n\nincarnate: To take bodily form.§\n\nincarnation: From incarnate, “to be made flesh.” The soul’s taking on a human body. —divine incarnation: The concept of avatāra. The Supreme Being’s (or other Mahādeva’s) taking of human birth, generally to reestablish dharma. This doctrine is important to several Hindu sects, notably Vaishṇavism, but not held by most Śaivites. See: reincarnation.§\n\nincognito: Without being recognized; keeping one’s identity unrevealed or disguised. Refers in this text to the protocol followed by monks traveling alone from one monastery to another or to rendezvous with other monks on pilgrimage. §\n\nindigenous: Native born; originating in a particular country or region.§\n\nindwell: To exist as a divine inner spirit or guiding force.§\n\ninfiniverse: An word coined by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami as an appropriate alternative to universe or universes, because there are realms within realms within realms within known existence, deeper and deepening even now as quantums are found, their energies released from one sphere to another. Infiniverse, in fact, describes the Unfathomable that humans have been and are constantly endeavoring to fathom, even unto this very day. While the word universe seeks to reduce existence to a one place, infiniverse acknowledges the vastly complex possibilities of the Great What Is. See: microcosm-macrocosm, quantum.§\n\ninflux: A mass arrival or collection.§\n\ninherent (to inhere): Existing in someone or something as a natural and inseparable quality, characteristic or right.§\n\ninitiate: A person who has had or is about to have an initiation.§\n\ninitiation (to initiate): To enter into; to admit as a member. In Hinduism, initiation from a qualified preceptor is considered invaluable for spiritual progress. See: dīkshā, Hinduism.§\n\ninner ether: Another name for the ākāśa.§\n\ninner eye: The third eye. See: ājñā chakra; third eye.§\n\ninner plane: Referring to the inner worlds, usually the Second World, or Antarloka.§\n\ninnovation: Something newly introduced; a change.§\n\ninstinctive: “Natural or innate.” From the Latin instinctus, “to impel, instigate.” The drives and impulses that order the animal world and the physical and lower astral aspects of humans—for example, self-preservation, procreation, hunger and thirst, as well as the emotions of greed, hatred, anger, fear, lust and jealousy. See: mind.§\n\ninstinctive mind: Manas chitta. The lower mind, the controller of basic faculties of perception, movement, ordinary thought and emotion. Manas chitta is of the manomaya kośa. See: astral body, mind.§\n\ninterrelate: To establish or demonstrate a connection between.§\n\nintersperse: Scatter, or randomly distribute among other things.§\n\nintrovert: To turn within, directing one’s interest, mind or attention upon oneself.§\n\nintuit: To know or sense without the use of rational processes.§\n\nIslam: The religion founded by Prophet Muhammed in Arabia about 625 CE, the youngest of the three Abrahamic faiths. Adherents, known as Muslims, follow the “five pillars” found in their scripture, the Koran: faith in Allah (God), praying five times daily facing Mecca, giving of alms, fasting during the month of Ramadan, and pilgrimage. One of the fastest growing religions, Islam has over one billion followers, mostly in the Middle East, Pakistan, Africa, China, Indochina, Russia and neighboring countries.§\n\nJainism: (Jaina) जैन An ancient non-Vedic religion of India made prominent by the teachings of Mahāvīra (“great hero”), CA 500 BCE. The Jain Āgamas teach reverence for all life, vegetarianism and strict renunciation for ascetics. Jains focus great emphasis on the fact that all souls may attain liberation, each by his own effort. Their worship is directed toward their great historic saints, called Tīrthaṅkaras (“ford-crossers”), of whom Mahāvīra was the 24th and last. Jains number about six million today, living mostly in India. §\n\njñāna pāda: ज्ञानपाद “Stage of wisdom.” According to the Śaiva Siddhānta ṛishis, jñāna is the last of the four successive pādas (stages) of spiritual unfoldment. It is the culmination of the third stage, the yoga pāda. Also names the knowledge section of each Āgama. See: Āgama, pāda.§\n\nJudaism: The religion of over 12 million adherents worldwide (over half in the United States), first of the Abrahamic faiths, founded about 3,700 years ago in Egypt-Canaan, now Israel, by Abraham, who started the lineage, and Moses, who emancipated the enslaved Jewish tribes from Egypt. Its major scripture is The Torah (the first five books of the Old Testament and the Talmud).§\n\njyotisha: ज्योतिष From jyoti, “light.” “The science of the lights (or stars).” Hindu astrology, the knowledge and practice of analyzing events and circumstances, delineating character and determining auspicious moments, according to the positions and movements of heavenly bodies. In calculating horoscopes, jyotisha uses the sidereal (fixed-star) system, while Western astrology uses the tropical (fixed-date) method. §\n\nKabbala: Oral tradition of esoteric Jewish mysticism which appeared in the 12th and following centuries. Kabbala claims secret knowledge of the unwritten Torah, the “divine revelation” communicated by God to Moses and Adam. While observance of the Law of Moses remains the basic tenet of Judaism, Kabbala provides a means of approaching God directly.§\n\nKali Yuga: कलियुग “Dark Age.” Kali means “strife, discord, contention: a die marked with one dot, the loosing die.” It is the last age of 432,000 years in the repetitive cycle of four phases, a period when only one-fourth of the Central Sun’s rays reach Earth. It is comparable to the darkest part of the night, as the forces of ignorance are in full power and many of the subtle faculties of the soul are obscured. See: yuga, Central Sun.§\n\nkammaba: Shūm language term for the feeling, the pressure, the weight of all actions, duties and responsibilities. The karma of another person that is temporarily carried by someone trying to help them, such as when in the midst of solving a problem. See: karma, Shūm.§\n\nkarma: कर्म “Action, deed.” One of the most important principles in Hindu thought, karma refers to 1) any act or deed; 2) the principle of cause and effect; 3) a consequence or “fruit of action” (karmaphala) or “after effect” (uttaraphala), which sooner or later returns upon the doer. What we sow, we shall reap in this or future lives. Selfish, hateful acts (pāpakarma or kukarma) will bring suffering. Benevolent actions (puṇyakarma or sukarma) will bring loving reactions. Karma is a neutral, self-perpetuating law of the inner cosmos.§\n\nKārttikeya: कार्त्तिकेय Child of the Pleiades, from Kṛittikā, “Pleiades.” Second son of Śiva, brother of Gaṇeśa. A great Mahādeva worshiped in all parts of India and the world. Also known as Muruga, Kumāra, Skanda, Shaṇmukhanātha, Subramaṇya and more, He is the God who guides that part of evolution which is religion, the transformation of the instinctive into a divine wisdom through the practice of yoga. In the Hindu Āgamas and Purāṇas appears a story in which Śiva emanates six sparks from His third eye that develop into six beautiful youths that are taken by the six Kṛittikās, or maidens, of the Pleiades and nurtured, hence the name Kārttikeya. These six then merge into one youth with six heads, giving another name: Shaṇmukha. Kārttikeya also appears in much earlier texts of the Atharva Veda under the name Skanda, found in the Skanda Yaga section of the Parisistas, in which He is referred to as the Son of Śiva, Agni and the Pleiades. Lord Kārttikeya’s “birth on Earth” is celebrated near the full-moon day when the Sun is in line with the Pleiades in the month of May/June, the kind of planetary alignment mentioned in Lemurian Scrolls for souls to migrate from that star system to Earth. See: Muruga, Skanda, Subramaṇya, Pleiades, Vedas.§\n\nKṛita Yuga: कृतयुग् “Age of accomplishment.” Kṛita also means “good, cultivated, kind action” and names the die of four dots. The first in the repetitive cycle of yugas, commonly known as Sat Yuga. See: yuga.§\n\nkriyā pāda: क्रियापाद “Stage of religious action; worship.” The stage of worship and devotion, second of four progressive stages of maturation on the Śaiva Siddhānta path of attainment. See: pāda, Śaiva Siddhānta, Śaivism.§\n\nkuṇḍalinī: कुण्डलिनी “She who is coiled; serpent power.” The primordial cosmic energy in every individual which, at first, lies coiled like a serpent at the base of the spine and eventually, through the practice of yoga, rises up the sushumṇā nāḍī. As it rises, the kuṇḍalinī awakens each successive chakra. Nirvikalpa samādhi, enlightenment, comes as it pierces through the door of Brahman at the core of the sahasrāra and enters! See: enlightenment, evolution of the soul, nāḍī.§\n\nLaboratory: A room, building or place where scientific experiments are performed. In this text it refers to the places where the first human, flesh bodies were created and perfected.§\n\nLemuria: An ancient continent described in Lemurian Scrolls as the first continent on Earth to be inhabited by humans (Lemurians). Lemuria has been revealed by scripture and explained and made popular by numerous clairvoyants and mystics over the past hundred years as a highly advanced civilization with amazing technologies, maintaining the love of nature and appreciating its many gifts. The accounts of various authors closely resemble descriptions found in this text. According to texts read along with Lemurian Scrolls, Lemuria once formed a land mass that stretched from the Rocky Mountains in the United States west to South Africa. According to another source, it is an ancient continent thought to have formed a massive connection between India, Madagascar and South Africa. Still another theory places it in the South Pacific between North America and Australasia. §\n\nLemurian and Dravidian Śāstras: The original name for these Lemurian Scrolls, revealed from ākāśic records in two parts to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami’s astral vision in 1973 by Lord Subramaniam’s inner-plane librarian. See: śāstra.§\n\nLemurian prasādam: Ambrosia made from fruit and cow or goat milk with nuts, seeds and honey that was offered to the Deities and enjoyed as daily nourishment by the Lemurians. At my monasteries, Lemurian Prasādam has become, over the years, a special treat, taken at lunchtime now and then. It is also prepared for days when a sattvic diet is needed (such as on pradosha days), or as a transition diet when preparing for a fast or ending one. The monks take great joy in making this healthful and simple meal. I have asked them to give a typical recipe for a single, hungry-person serving: One ripe banana and one papaya or the equivalent in other neutral fruits, such as apples, berries, peaches, mangos or pears, cut in bite-size pieces. (Acid fruits, such as oranges, lemons and pineapples, are always taken separately and do not mix well with this meal.) A small handful of raisins, dates and seeds, such as sunflower or sesame, are always added, along with two ounces of nuts, such as almonds, pecans, walnuts or cashews. A special meal can include an ounce of dried figs or currants. Mix all of the above together with one cup of yogurt and add up to one tablespoon of nature’s most natural sweetener, honey, as desired. See: prasādam. §\n\nLemurians: The term used by the souls in the original bodies that came to this planet in the last Sat Yuga and Tretā Yuga to refer to those souls who were the first to inhabit human bodies that came up from the animal kingdom during the Tretā Yuga.§\n\nlevitation: The power or ability to float in the air or to cause objects to do so at will.§\n\nliberation: Moksha, release from the bonds of pāśa, after which the soul is liberated from saṁsāra (the round of births and deaths), which occurs after karma has been resolved and nirvikalpa samādhi—realization of the Self, Paraśiva—has been attained. In Śaiva Siddhānta, pāśa is the three-fold bondage of āṇava, karma and māyā, which limit and confine the soul to the reincarnational cycle so that it may evolve. Moksha is freedom from the fettering power of these bonds, which do not cease to exist, but no longer have the power to fetter or bind the soul. Same as mukti. See: kuṇḍalinī, Paraśiva, Śaiva Siddhānta.§\n\nlo: An exclamation to attract attention or to show surprise.§\n\nLord Subramaniam Śāstras: The three-volume set of inner-plane writings containing the Lemurian, Dravidian and Śaivite Śāstras.§\n\nMagic: Use of charms, spells and rituals in seeking or pretending to cause or control events, or govern certain natural or supernatural forces. Also, wondrous; producing extraordinary results.§\n\nmahā: महा A prefix meaning “great.”§\n\nMahādeva: महादेव “Great shining one; God.” Referring either to God Śiva or any of the highly evolved beings who live in the Śivaloka in their natural, effulgent soul bodies. God Śiva in His perfection as Primal Soul is one of the Mahādevas, yet He is unique and incomparable in that He alone is uncreated, the Father-Mother and Destiny of all other Mahādevas. He is called Parameśvara, “Supreme God.” He is the Primal Soul, whereas the other Gods are individual souls. See: Śivaloka, three worlds.§\n\nmahā tapas: महातपास् State of introspection and intensive striving and purification catalyzed by the grace of the guru and the disciplines of monastic life. A culmination of sādhana well-performed; an opportunity to break through inner congestion which has become apparent to the guru’s inner vision. During mahā tapas, which is given by the guru, often without explanation, a monastic may be relieved of some or all of his regular duties.§\n\nmala: मल “Impurity.” An important term in Śaivism referring to three bonds, called pāśa—āṇava, karma, and māyā—which limit the soul, preventing it from knowing its true, divine nature. See: liberation, pāśa.§\n\nmalcontent: Not happy with current conditions or circumstances; not satisfied. A person who is not content.§\n\nmantra: मन्त्र “Mystic formula.” A sound, syllable, word or phrase endowed with special power, usually drawn from scripture. Mantras are chanted loudly during pūjā to invoke the Gods and establish a force field. Certain mantras are used for worshipful incantation, called japa. To be truly effective, such mantras must be given by the preceptor through initiation. See: dīkshā, pūjā.§\n\nManu Dharma Śāstra: मनुधर्मशास्त्र “Sage Manu’s law book.” An encyclopedic treatise of 2,685 verses on Hindu law assembled as early as 600 BCE. Despite its caste-based restrictions, which determine one’s life unrelentingly from birth to death, it remains the source of much of modern Hindu culture and law. §\n\nmanvantara: Cycle of 71 chaturyugas. See: cosmic cycle, chaturyuga, yuga.§\n\nmaṭha: मट “Monastery.” See: monastery.§\n\nmaṭhavāsi: मठवासि “Monastic; monastery dweller.” See: monk.§\n\nmauna tapas: मौनतपस् The discipline of being silent.§\n\nmāyā: माया “She who measures;” or “mirific energy.” The substance emanated from Śiva through which the world of form is manifested. Hence all creation is also termed māyā. It is the cosmic creative force, the principle of manifestation, ever in the process of creation, preservation and dissolution. In Śaivism it is one of the three bonds (pāśa) that limit the soul and thereby facilitate its evolution. For Śaivites and most other nondualists, it is understood not as illusion but as relative reality, in contrast to the unchanging Absolute Reality. See: mala, pāśa.§\n\nMayans: An advanced civilization that thrived over 3,000 years ago in southern Mexico, Guatemala and northern Belize. The Mayans were adept in astrology, mathematics and agriculture. They built great cities and temples out of stone and believed in many nature Gods.§\n\nmeditation: The result of successful concentration; uninterrupted thought on a subject, leading to intuitive discovery. “Dhyāna,” the seventh of the eight limbs of ashṭāṅga yoga.

See: monk.§\n\nmesmerism: Causing illusions, a form of hypnotism. §\n\nmicrocosm-macrocosm: “Little world” or “miniature universe” as compared with “great world.” Microcosm refers to the internal source of something larger or more external (macrocosm). In Hindu cosmology, the outer world is a macrocosm of the inner world, which is its microcosm and is mystically larger and more complex than the physical universe and functions at a higher rate of vibration and even a different rate of time. The microcosm precedes the macrocosm. Thus, the guiding principle of the Bhūloka comes from the Antarloka and Śivaloka. Consciousness precedes physical form. In the tantric tradition, the body of man is viewed as a microcosm of the entire divine creation. “Microcosm-macrocosm” is embodied in the terms piṇḍa and aṇda. See: universe, universes§\n\nmind: In the most profound sense, mind is the sum of all things, all energies and manifestations, all forms, subtle and gross, sacred and mundane. It is the inner and outer cosmos. Mind is māyā. It is the material matrix. It is everything but That, the Self within, Paraśiva. ¶In the individual being, mind, or consciousness, is understood in three parts: 1) instinctive mind: the seat of desire and governor of sensory and motor organs; 2) intellectual mind: the faculty of thought and intelligence; 3) superconscious mind: the strata of intuition, benevolence and spiritual sustenance. Its most refined essence is Parāśakti, or Satchidānanda, all-knowing, omnipresent consciousness, the One transcendental, self-luminous, divine mind common to all souls. See: Parāśakti, Paraśiva, Satchidānanda.§\n\nmingle: To mix together, usually without loss of individual characteristics.§\n\nmohan: Often “mohan artisan;” a senior swāmī who serves and teaches mainly inside the monastery walls. See: artisan.§\n\nmoksha: मोक्ष See: liberation.§\n\nmonarchy: Rulership by royalty, generally a hereditary head of state, a king or queen. §\n\nmonastery: “Place of solitariness.” Maṭha. The age-old tradition, carried forward from Lemurian times into the Hindu culture of India, a sacred place where those of the same gender go through their birth karmas together toward realization of the Self. Living under strict vows, they thrive. Most monasteries are cloisters for men, though monasteries for women, headed by female ascetics, also exist in the Hindu tradition. Male and female monasteries are traditionally situated several miles or more from one another. Monasteries, in the correct sense of the word, are for individuals on the path of enlightenment who have arrived at a certain subsuperconscious state and wish to stay there. Therefore, they release various interactions with the world, physically and emotionally, and seek to remain poised in a contemplative monastic lifestyle. The intention of monastic life is to put oneself in a self-imposed intensity where unfoldment of the spirit can be catalyzed more quickly and more fully than in family life, or in a commune or coed āśramā situations where the two genders live together. In monasteries, dedicated to transmutation of the sexual energies, celibacy is strictly upheld and there is no fraternizing with the opposite sex. The karmas of males living together and females living among their own gender are worked though faster than in communes, as they do not distract each other, nor do they offer temptations for additional karmas to be pursued. Such a separation offers safety for sincere seekers, assurance that nothing unseemly will happen as spiritual life is pursued. The purpose of the monastery is to create an environment in which the individual can balance the male and female energies (piṅgalā and iḍā) within himself so that he lives in the spiritual, or sushumṇā, energy, which cannot be done when close association with the opposite sex is also occurring. The monastic, whether a monk or a nun, is in a sense neither male nor female, but a pure soul being. By contrast, in communes or āśramas in which men and women live together, the men reside mainly in the masculine (piṅgalā) current, and the women in the feminine (iḍā) current. The goal of the monastic, whether male or female, is to live in the depth of his own being, treating all equally, abandoning preferences. He finds points of agreement, forsaking contention and difference. No man is his enemy. No man is his friend. All men are his teachers. Some teach him what to do; others teach him what not to do. He finds security in his own being rather than by attaching himself to outward manifestations of security, warmth and companionship. A Śaiva monastery is a laboratory dedicated to the realization of the Self, an environment in which the sushumṇā can come into full power so that the kuṇḍalinī can rise to the top of the head and beyond into the fullness of timeless, formless, spaceless Self, Paraśiva. See: āśrama, cult, monastery, monk, nāḍī.§\n\nmonastic: See: monk.§\n\nmonk: A celibate man wholly dedicated to religious life, either cenobitic (residing with others in a monastery) or anchoritic (living alone, as a hermit or mendicant). Literally, “one who lives alone” (from the Greek monos, “alone”). Through the practice of yoga, the control and transmutation of the masculine and feminine forces within himself, the monk is a complete being, free to follow the contemplative and mystic life toward realization of the Self within. Benevolent and strong, courageous, fearless, not entangled in the thoughts and feelings of others, monks are affectionately detached from society, defenders of the faith, kind, loving and ever-flowing with timely wisdom. A synonym for monastic. See: sannyāsa.§\n\nmoon: In this text, month; one complete cycle of the moon around the Earth.§\n\nmorass: A place of difficulty or trouble; a swamp, bog or marsh.§\n\nmundane: Commonplace, ordinary.§\n\nmūrti: मूर्ति “Form; manifestation, embodiment, personification.” An image or icon of God or a God used during worship.

These interconnect the chakras. The three main nāḍīs are named iḍā, piṅgalā and sushumṇā. —iḍā: Also known as chandra (“moon”) nāḍī, it is pink in color and flows downward, ending on the left side of the body. This current is feminine in nature and is the channel of physical-emotional energy. —piṅgaḷā: Also known as sūrya (“sun”) nāḍī, it is blue in color and flows upward, ending on the right side of the body. This current is masculine in nature and is the channel of intellectual-mental energy. —sushumṇā: The major nerve current which passes through the spinal column from the mūlādhāra chakra at the base to the sahasrāra at the crown of the head. It is the channel of kuṇḍalinī. Through yoga, the kuṇḍalinī energy lying dormant in the mūlādhāra is awakened and made to rise up this channel through each chakra to the sahasrāra chakra. See: chakra, kuṇḍalinī, rāja yoga.§\n\nnaishṭika: नैष्टिक Virgin from birth. In this text, a monastic or pre-monastic who has maintained the subtle connections with the inner worlds which are closed off or obscured when a connection with a member of the opposite sex is created through sexual intercourse. See: psychic tubes. §\n\nNātha: नाथ “Master, lord; adept.” Names an ancient Himālayan tradition of Śaiva-yoga mysticism, whose first historically known exponent was Nandikeśvara (CA 250 BCE). Nātha—Self-Realized adept—refers to the extraordinary ascetic masters of this school. Nātha also refers to any follower of the Nātha tradition. The Nāthas are considered the source of haṭha as well as rāja yoga. Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami is of the Nandinātha tradition, one of the two major Nātha streams, of which the second is the Gorakshnātha Sampradāya.§\n\nnirvikalpa samādhi: निर्विकल्पसमाधि “Enstasy (samādhi) without form or seed.” The realization of the Self, Paraśiva, a state of oneness beyond all change or diversity; beyond time, form and space. Vi means “to change, make different.” Kalpa means “order, arrangement; a period of time.” Thus vikalpa means “diversity, thought; difference of perception, distinction.” Nir means “without.” See: enlightenment, enstasy, Paraśiva, rāja yoga, samādhi.§\n\nnorth wind: The group within the monastery which provides for and takes care of the monastics, from preparing food to performing the pūjās to overseeing the teachings.

A newcomer to a monastic or religious community, on probation, before taking final vows.§\n\nnullify: To make invalid or useless.§\n\nOdic: Magnetic—of or pertaining to consciousness within aśuddha māyā, the realm of the physical and lower astral planes. Odic force in its rarified state is prakṛiti, the primary gross energy of nature, manifesting in the three guṇas: sattva, rajas and tamas. It is the force of attraction and repulsion between people, people and their things, and manifests as masculine (aggressive) and feminine (passive), arising from the piṅgalā and iḍā currents. These two currents (nāḍī) are found within the spine of the subtle body. Odic force is a magnetic, sticky, binding substance that people seek to develop when they want to bind themselves together, such as in partnerships, marriage, guru-śishya relationships and friendships. See: māyā, nāḍī.§\n\nodic tubes: See: psychic tubes.§\n\nold soul: One who has reincarnated many times, learned the lessons from life’s experiences, matured the soul body through spiritual disciplines and is therefore farther along the path. Old souls may be recognized by their qualities of compassion, self-effacement and wisdom. See: soul.§\n\noligarchy: Rulership by a few.

According to Śaiva Siddhānta, there are four pādas, which are successive and cumulative; i.e. in accomplishing each one the soul prepares itself for the next. —charyā pāda: “Good conduct stage.” The first stage where one learns to live righteously, serve selflessly, performing karma yoga. It is also known as dāsa mārga, “path of the slave,” a time when the aspirant relates to God as a servant to a master. Traditional acts of charyā include cleaning the temple, lighting lamps and collecting flowers for worship. Worship at this stage is mostly external. —kriyā pāda: “Religious action; worship stage.” Stage of bhakti yoga, of cultivating devotion through performing pūjā and regular daily sādhana. It is also known as the satputra mārga, “true son’s way,” as the soul now relates to God as a son to his father. A central practice of the kriyā pāda is performing daily pūjā. —yoga pāda: Having matured in the charyā and kriyā pādas, the soul now turns to internalized worship and rāja yoga under the guidance of a satguru. It is a time of sādhana and serious striving when realization of the Self is the goal. It is the sakhā mārga, “way of the friend,” for now God is looked upon as an intimate friend. —jñāna pāda: “Stage of wisdom.” Once the soul has attained Realization, it is henceforth a wise one, who lives out the life of the body, shedding blessings on mankind. This stage is also called the San Mārga, “true path,” on which God is our dearest beloved. See: Āgama, Śaiva Siddhānta, Śaivism.§\n\npagoda: A temple in the form of a pyramidal tower of several stories.§\n\nparamount: Ranking higher than any other, as in power or importance.§\n\nParāśakti: पराशक्ति “Supreme power; primal energy.” God Śiva’s second perfection, which is impersonal, immanent, and with form—the all-pervasive, Pure Consciousness and Primal Substance of all that exists. There are many other descriptive names for Parāśakti—Satchidānanda (“existence-consciousness-bliss”), light, silence, divine mind, superconsciousness and more. See: rāja yoga, Satchidānanda.§\n\nParaśiva: परशिव “Transcendent Śiva.” The Self God, Śiva in His first perfection, Absolute Reality. God Śiva as That which is beyond the grasp of consciousness, transcends time, form and space and defies description. To merge with Him in mystic union is the goal of all incarnated souls, the reason for their living on this planet, and the deepest meaning of their experiences. Attainment of this is called Self Realization or nirvikalpa samādhi. See: nirvikalpa samādhi, samādhi, Śiva.§\n\npāśa: पाश “Tether; noose.” The whole of existence, manifest and unmanifest. That which binds or limits the soul and keeps it (for a time) from manifesting its full potential. Pāśa refers to the soul’s three-fold bondage of āṇava, karma and māyā.

The Pleiades are referred to in stories from religions and cultures the world over. In the Hindu scriptures appears a story in which Lord Kārttikeya is nurtured by the six maidens of the Pleiades, known as the Kṛittikās. This story is paralleled in Greek mythology where the “Seven Sisters” are believed to have been turned into stars by Zeus. Referred to in the poet-astronomer Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat as “beginning all things,” the Pleiades were simultaneously known in ancient Peruvian legend as “the arbiters of human destiny.” The Koran, the holy book of Islam, tells of Najm, the Pleiades, from which a spirit (the angel Gabriel) came to tell the Prophet Muhammed the laws of the Muslims. The Pleiades are also well known to the Chinese, the Freemasons, and are one of the few star clusters mentioned in the Bible.

The eight stages are: yama (restraints), niyama (observances), āsana (posture), prāṇāyāma (breath control) pratyāhara (withdrawal), dhāraṇa (concentration), dhyāna (meditation) and samādhi (enstasy, mystic oneness). See: nirvikalpa samādhi, samādhi.§\n\nramification: Effect, consequence, result.§\n\nreincarnation: “Re-entering the flesh.” Punarjanma; metempsychosis. The process wherein souls take on a physical body through the birth process. The cycle of reincarnation ends when karma has been resolved and the Self God (Paraśiva) has been realized. This condition of release is called moksha. Then the soul continues to evolve and mature, but without the need to return to physical existence. See: evolution of the soul, karma, Paraśiva, soul.§\n\nremorse: Mental state of feeling sorry or regretful for one’s past actions.§\n\nrequisite: Required; essential.§\n\nresplendence: Radiance; brilliance.§\n\nretrospect: A looking back on; thinking about the past.§\n\nrevelation: The act of revealing or disclosing something; a vision or understanding.§\n\nṚig Veda: ऋग्वेद “Veda of verse (ṛik).” The first and oldest of the four Veda compendia of revealed scriptures (śruti), including a hymn collection (Saṁhitā), priestly explanatory manuals (Brāhmaṇas), forest treatises (Āraṇyakas) elaborating on the Vedic rites, and philosophical dialogs (Upanishads). The Ṛig Veda Saṁhitā, which in length equals Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey combined, is the most important hymn collection, for it lends a large number of its hymns to the other three Veda Saṁhitās (the Sāma, Yajur and Atharva). Chronologically, after the Saṁhitās came the Brāhmaṇas, followed by the Āraṇyakas, and finally the Upanishads, also called the Vedānta, meaning “Veda’s end.” See: Vedas.§\n\nṛishi: ॠषि “Seer.” A term for an enlightened being, emphasizing psychic perception and visionary wisdom. In the Vedic age, ṛishis lived in forest or mountain retreats, either alone or with disciples. These ṛishis were great souls who were the inspired conveyers of the Vedas. Seven particular ṛishis (the sapta-ṛishis) mentioned in the Ṛig Veda are said to still guide mankind from the inner worlds. See: Hinduism.§\n\nSacrifice: Yajña. 1) Giving offerings to a Deity as an expression of homage and devotion. 2) Giving up something, often one’s own possession, advantage or preference, to serve a higher purpose. The literal meaning of sacrifice is “to make sacred,” implying an act of worship. It is the most common translation of the term yajña, from the verb yuj, “to worship.” In Hinduism, all of life is a sacrifice—called jīvayajña, a giving of oneself—through which comes true spiritual fulfillment. §\n\nsādhaka: साधक “Accomplished one; a devotee who performs sādhana.” A serious aspirant who has undertaken spiritual disciplines, is usually celibate and under the guidance of a guru. He wears white and may be under vows, but is not a sannyāsin.§\n\nsādhaka monastery: A monastery in which most of the senior members are sādhakas dressed in white.§\n\nsādhana: साधन “Effective means of attainment.” Religious or spiritual disciplines, such as pūjā, yoga, meditation, japa, fasting and austerity. The effect of sādhana is the building of willpower, faith and confidence in oneself and in God, Gods and guru. Sādhana harnesses and transmutes the instinctive-intellectual nature, allowing progressive spiritual unfoldment into the superconscious realizations and innate abilities of the soul. See: pūjā, spiritual unfoldment.§\n\nŚaivite Śāstras: The inner-plane prophecy that has guided Śaiva Siddhānta Church since Sivaya Subramuniyaswami read it from the ākāśa in 1973. The Śaivite Śāstras were written for the Śaiva Siddhānta Yoga Order by a group of devas in the Second World, in English. Their purpose is to bring forward the applicable patterns of the Lemurian and Dravidian monasteries, molding the monastics into the culture and ideals expressed therein, including relationships with the guru, attitudes and guidelines for monastic life.§\n\nŚaiva Siddhānta: शैवसिद्धान्त “Final conclusions of Śaivism.” The most widespread and influential Śaivite school today, predominant especially among the Tamil people in Sri Lanka and South India. It is the formalized theology of the divine revelations contained in the twenty-eight Śaiva Āgamas. For Śaiva Siddhāntins, Śiva is the totality of all, understood in three perfections: Parameśvara (the Personal Creator Lord), Parāśakti (the substratum of form) and Paraśiva (Absolute Reality which transcends all). Souls and world are identical in essence with Śiva, yet also differ in that they are evolving. See: Hinduism, Śaivism.§\n\nŚaivism (Śaiva): शैव The religion followed by those who worship Śiva as supreme God. Oldest of the four sects of Hinduism. The earliest historical evidence of Śaivism is from the 8,000-year-old Indus Valley civilization in the form of the famous seal of Śiva as Lord Paśupati, seated in a yogic pose. See: Hinduism.§\n\nsamādhi: समाधि “Enstasy,” which means “standing within one’s Self.” From verb-root dhā with prepositional prefixes sam and ā, “to hold together completely.” Sameness; contemplation; union, wholeness; completion, accomplishment. Samādhi is the state of true yoga, in which the meditator and the object of meditation are one. Samādhi is of two levels. The first is savikalpa samādhi (“enstasy with form or seed”), identification or oneness with the essence of an object. Its highest form is the realization of the primal substratum or pure consciousness, Satchidānanda. The second is nirvikalpa samādhi (“enstasy without form or seed”), identification with the Self, in which all modes of consciousness are transcended and Absolute Reality, Paraśiva, beyond time, form and space, is experienced. This brings in its aftermath a complete transformation of consciousness. See: enstasy, nirvikalpa samādhi, Paraśiva, Satchidānanda.§\n\nSanātana Dharma: सनातनधर्म “Eternal religion” or “everlasting path,” based on two supremely divine bodies of revealed scripture, śruti (that which is heard from God), the Vedas (Ṛig, Sāma, Yajur and Atharva) and the Āgamas. Sanātana Dharma is a traditional name for the Hindu religion and one still used in India. See: Hinduism. §\n\nsanction: Authoritative permission or approval.§\n\nsandhyā: संध्या Twilight, end of an era (yuga, chaturyuga, manvantara, etc.) the transitional period as one era ends and a new one begins.

See: monastic, monk.§\n\nSarasvatī: सरस्वती “The flowing one.” Śakti, the Universal Mother; Goddess of the arts and learning, mythological consort of the God Brahmā. Sarasvatī, the river Goddess, is usually depicted wearing a white sārī and holding a vīṇā, sitting upon a swan or lotus flower. Prayers are offered to her for refinements of art, culture and learning. §\n\nśāstra: शास्त्र “Sacred text; teaching.” Any religious or philosophical treatise, or body of writings. Also a department of knowledge, a science; e.g., the Artha Śāstras on politics.§\n\nSatchidānanda: सत्चिदानन्द “Existence-consciousness-bliss.” A synonym for Parāśakti. Lord Śiva’s Divine Mind and simultaneously the pure superconscious mind of each individual soul. It is perfect love and omniscient, omnipotent consciousness, the fountainhead of all existence, yet containing and permeating all existence. It is also called pure consciousness, pure form, substratum of existence. See: Parāśakti.§\n\nsatguru (sadguru): सद्गुरु “True weighty one.” A spiritual preceptor of the highest attainment—one who has realized the ultimate Truth, Paraśiva, through nirvikalpa samādhi—a jīvanmukta able to lead others securely along the spiritual path. He is always a sannyāsin, an unmarried renunciate. All Hindu denominations teach that the grace and guidance of a living satguru is a necessity for Self Realization. He is recognized and revered as the embodiment of God, Sadāśiva, the source of grace and of liberation. See: guru, Hinduism, Paraśiva.§\n\nSat Śiva Yuga: सत् शिवयुग Another name for the next Sat Yuga. See: Sat Yuga.§\n\nSat Yuga: सत् युग (Also Satya) “age of Truth,” also called Kṛita, “accomplished, good, cultivated, kind action; the winning die of four dots.” The first in the repetitive cycle of yugas, lasting 1,728,000 years, representing the brightest time, when the full light of the Central Sun permeates Earth. See: yuga, Central Sun, cosmic cycle.§\n\nscripture (scriptural): “A writing.” A sacred text or holy book having authority for a given sect or religion. See: śāstra.§\n\nSecond World: The astral or subtle plane. Here the soul continues its activities in the astral body during sleep and after the physical body dies. The Second World exists “within” the First World or physical plane. See: Antarloka, astral plane, Devaloka.§\n\nSelf: See: Paraśiva, Self Realization.§\n\nSelf Realization: Direct knowing of the Self God, Paraśiva. Self Realization is known in Sanskṛit as nirvikalpa samādhi; “enstasy without form or seed;” the ultimate spiritual attainment (also called asamprajñata samādhi). Esoterically, this state is attained when the mystic kuṇḍalinī force pierces through the sahasrāra chakra at the crown of the head.

See: Hinduism, Śaiva Siddhānta.§\n\nsiddhi: सिद्धि “Power, accomplishment; perfection.” Extraordinary powers of the soul, developed through consistent meditation and deliberate, grueling, often uncomfortable tapas, or awakened naturally through spiritual maturity and yogic sādhana. Through the repeated experience of Self Realization, siddhis naturally unfold according to the needs of the individual. Before Self Realization, the use or development of siddhis is among the greatest obstacles on the path because it cultivates ahaṁkāra, I-ness, and militates against the attainment of prapatti, complete submission to the will of God, Gods and guru.§\n\nSikhism: “Disciple.” Religion of nine million members founded in India about 500 years ago by the saint Guru Nānak. A reformist faith which rejects idolatry and the caste system, its holy book is the Ādi Granth, and main holy center is the Golden Temple of Amritsar. See: Hinduism.§\n\nŚiva: शिव “The auspicious, gracious or kindly one.” Supreme Being of the Śaivite religion. God Śiva is All and in all, simultaneously the creator and the creation, both immanent and transcendent. As personal Deity, He is creator, preserver and destroyer.

This essence was never created, does not change or evolve and is eternally identical with God Śiva’s perfections of Parāśakti and Paraśiva. —soul body: ānandamaya kośa (“sheath of bliss”), also referred to as the “causal body” (kāraṇa śarīra), “innermost sheath” and “body of light.” Body of the soul, or soul body, names the soul’s manifest nature as an individual being—an effulgent, human-like form composed of light (quantums). See: evolution of the soul, reincarnation, Parāśakti, Paraśiva.§\n\nsouth wind: The group within the monastery who are the craftsmen, the builders, maintenance men, printers and publishers. See: artisan, winds.§\n\nspiritual unfoldment: The unfoldment of the spirit, the inherent, divine soul of man. The gradual expansion of consciousness as kuṇḍalinī śakti slowly rises through the sushumṇā nāḍī.

See: kuṇḍalinī, nāḍī, sushumṇā nāḍī.§\n\nŚrīmad Bhāgavatam: श्रीमद् भागवतम् Also known as Bhāgavata Purāṇa, a work of 18,000 stanzas. A major Purāṇa and primary Vaishṇava scripture, from oral tradition, written down CA 800. It provides the stories of all incarnations of Vishṇu, filled with the bhakti, inner current of devotion. It falls in the category of secondary scripture, smṛiti, “that which is remembered,” along with the Mahābhārata, Rāmāyaṇa, the Bhāgavad Gitā, the Tirukural and countless other works by man, as opposed to sṛuti, “that which is heard,” wisdom revealed by God—a category reserved for the four sacred Vedas, the Āgamas and few rare texts throughout history that rise to this level of superconscious receptivity between our First World and the realm of the Gods. See: Purāṇa.§\n\nstabilizing the force field: Consciously working to quiet the instinctive forces and thus permit the influx of superconsciousness into the monastery.

See: Kārttikeya, Muruga, Skanda.§\n\nSubramuniya: சுப்பிரமுனிய Tamil spelling of the Sanskṛit Śubhramunya (not to be confused with Subramaṇya). It is formed from śubhra meaning “light; intuition,” and muni, “silent sage.” Ya means “restraint; religious meditation.” Thus, Subramuniya means a self-restrained soul who remains silent or, when he speaks, speaks out from intuition. Name of the author of Lemurian Scrolls, current and 162nd satguru (1927–) of the Nandinātha Sampradāya’s Kailāsa Paramparā. §\n\nsubsuperconscious mind: Anukāraṇa chitta. The superconscious mind working through the conscious and subconscious states, which brings forth intuition, clarity and insight. §\n\nsubtle body: Sūkshma śarīra, the nonphysical, astral body or vehicle in which the soul encases itself to function in the Antarloka, or subtle world. The subtle body includes the vijñānamaya kośa (mental, cognitive-intuitive sheath), manomaya kośa (instinctive-intellectual sheath) and the prāṇamaya kośa (life-energy sheath) if the soul is physically embodied. It consists of only manomaya and vijñānamaya after death, when prāṇamaya kośa disintegrates. And it consists of only vijñānamaya kośa when manomaya kośa is dropped off just before rebirth or when higher evolutionary planes are entered. Also part of the subtle body are the antaḥkaraṇa (mental faculty: intellect, instinct and ego—buddhi, manas and ahaṁkāra), the five jñānendriyas (agents of perception: hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell); and the five karmendriyas (agents of action: speech, grasping, movement, excretion and generation).

A state of humble submission to the divine forces and surrender to the processes of inner purification which occur almost automatically at certain stages. In the monastery tapas is administered and guided by the guru. Denotes religious austerity, severe meditation, penance, bodily mortification, special observances; connotes spiritual purification and transformation as a “fiery process” which “burns up” impurities, ego, illusions and past karmas that obstruct God-Realization. See: mahā tapas, mauna tapas.§\n\ntapas monastery: A monastery where most senior members are in yellow, on tapas.§\n\ntattva: तत्त्व “That-ness” or “essential nature.” Tattvas are the primary principles, elements, states or categories of existence, the building blocks of the universe. Lord Śiva constantly creates, sustains the form of and absorbs back into Himself His creations. Ṛishis describe this emanational process as the unfoldment of tattvas, stages or evolutes of manifestation, descending from subtle to gross. At mahāpralaya, cosmic dissolution, they enfold into their respective sources, with only the first two tattvas surviving the great dissolution. The first and subtlest form—the pure consciousness and source of all other evolutes of manifestation—is called Śiva tattva, or Parāśakti-nāda. But beyond Śiva tattva lies Paraśiva—the utterly"
