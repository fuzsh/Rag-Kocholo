Srividhya, as a ditched wife, rises up her kid Rakesh (Venkatesh) with well behavior, manner and makes him a good lawyer to do justice to the fellow woman who are cheated brutally by their husbands. How Rakesh takes the revenge on his father for the injustice that he had done to his mother is the crux of the film.",

        "text": "Product Availability\n\nPlease note that a product being listed on our website does not necessarily mean it is in stock and readily available for order. Our catalog is built as a reference for our customers, while we do our best to sync our in-stock items on our website. The items that are not released yet, or not out on DVD / Blu-ray are indeed unavailable, and that is what we would tell our customers if the requests ever come in.\n\nOur aim is to build a comprehensive listing of movies and TV shows available to date.\n\nSince, we do not take payments online at this time, there is 0% risk in placing order for movies you like on our website. Our representative will get in touch with the customer with the availability of the items when an order is placed.\n\nNotice and Takedown policy\n\nAs a professional and reputable online store, DVD Planet Store is fully committed to the twin issues of copyright and trademarks. Please read our notice and takedown policy by clicking here.\n\nBest Effort Policy\n\nShould an item be unavailable, we would inform you if it was possible to provide an on-Demand DVD-R version of the requested item, but we offer no guarantees. Many DVD stores now offer MOD service, and so do we to keep a competitive edge. We would not make any profit out of such sale. The price of the items would only cover the operational / raw material / shipping costs; and would be sold for personal use only.\n\nProcessing\n\nOur processing time is 1-2 days for in-stock items for domestic orders. For MOD requests, processing time could be up to 1 week on average. We do our best to fulfill orders as quickly as we can."
