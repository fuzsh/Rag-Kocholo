        "text": "#newdaynewchapter “Though Saraswati is regarded as the Goddess of Learning, can Goddess Matangi be regarded as the Goddess of Learning?” Sri Matangi is one of the ten forms of the Goddess called Dasa-Mahavidya. The ten forms of the Goddess represent the 9 celestial bodies which form part of the astrological influences in one's life with the tenth representing the Ascendant at birth (the portion of the Zodiac rising in the East with reference to Lat-Long of place of birth). Sri Matangi represents the Sun and the medical sign Leo and three “mansions of the stars”- the constellations Kritika, Uttara, Phalguni and Uttarashadha. The worship of Goddess Matangi is for enlightenment, enhanced presence (hence political/royalty recognition) and be a leader with adequate skills and power base for a fair and productive success. Gayatri is represented with the following five elements of Divine Nature. 1. Prithvi-Bhuta: Solid Matter/Element. 2 Apa-Bhuta: Water Element. 3. Agni-Bhuta: Fire Element. 4. Vayu-Bhuta: Air Element. 5. Akash-Bhuta: Divine Energy. She is also represented by ten arms, hands, and instruments. These ten instruments represent ten directions of the light of the Sun. She is also called Savitri, the consort of Savitur, the Sun-God. Hence, Gayatri Mantra is also in praise of Sun-God, the presiding deity of our Solar system. Fortunately, there is a connection between Goddess Saraswati in Goddess Gayatri. There are 3 forms of Goddess Gayatri. 1. Brahmani Gayatri: The chanting of Gayatri Mantra at 6 am facing east is dedicated to Goddess Brahmani Gayatri, the consort of Lord Brahma. Hence, she represents Goddess Saraswati. 2. Vaishnavi Gayatri: The chanting of Gayatri Mantra at noon facing north is dedicated to Goddess Vaishnavi, the consort of Lord Vishnu. This aspect can be related to Goddess Lakshmi. 3. Rudrani Gayatri: The chanting of Gayatri Mantra facing west is dedicated to Goddess Rudrani, the consort of Lord Shiva (Rudra). This aspect can be related to Goddess Parvati. Jay Ma Saraswati:\n\n#newdaynewchapter Eko hi Rudro na dwiteeyay,,,,,, This Shloka is all over Vedas in many parts of it, and certain verses which Uniquely declares that Rudra is only one greatest mightiest the final God there is no second to him, nothing beyond or above only he is self created the final God. Shiva Puran says, the sound of all scriptures is heard till Shiva Puran is not sounded. Once The Roar of Shiva Puran is hurled all sounds of all other scriptures are made quiet, Because In Shiva Linga and Devi Puran only you will find many things so similar and agreeable to modern science that is also very unique feature of shiva devi based Purans Tantra and Vedas they are quite verifiable by modern quantum mechanics Shiva Lingas signs are found in Outer space they do same function, Only Shiva is verifiable God as per Science too. Black Hole and quasars were actually the Shiva Lingas sprouted between Vishnu and Bramha and they do all the said functions as depicted in Shastra. Anyways glories and highest power of shiva linga puran is inexplicable, they destory all sins any sins and Shivas devotees who do his sadhna even if there ishta is some one else, those too get what they want material or spiritual, Your devotion is important, Shiva is infamous for giving anything to anybodywithout thinking twice , well thinking is for weak, the one who makes universes and designs things who is trikalagya why he needs to think, So Shiva is famous and infamous of hos ruthless offerings to any one who worships him devotedly, even those who worship him without devotion or even with fear or force are blessed and given great punyas. What is the difference here but the real part is start reading it in Pavitra Awastha, (after taking bath at least) worship him, this was the map and mahatmya in very human limited way, the real thing is to hear Shiva Katha from right person who wears Tripundra, because shiva puran has rule the one who doesn't wear Tripundra can not recite it ,this is very first rule now a days broken than how can that katha be true when kathakar has not read the Puran well enough, as these days on u tube, they talk worldly things, some music or praising there own personal god not Shiva, Such kathas are false from base, the audience and sayer both are false. So listen from the right guy who wears Tripundra at least and read it also. Jay Shri Ganesh\n\n🙏🌷 *YOG SADHANA* 🌷🙏 *Rajyog Niyam-* With the actions or Karm done, binds Jeeva in cycle of Dualities of many types. It makes us to live under the influence of Illusion which keeps us in darkness of ignorance & binds us in the cycle of Karm, its direct effects, micro effects, sanskar, further instincts & desires arising out of these Sanskar & again doing Karm. This creates re-binding to churn the Self in this Karmik cycle, births together. It is nicely explained through a verse from Geeta, as- अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्य शाखा गुणप्रवृद्धा विषयप्रवाला:| अधश्च मूलान्यनुसन्ततानि कर्मानुबन्धीनि मनुष्यलोके|| 15.2|| Earlier verse to this tells that this the universe is just like a Upside down tree, where Roots are above & the spread of material as well as spiritual world is below. This verse tells that- the branches of this tree are spread everywhere, upwards & downwards. The branches are nourished by Triguna- Pious, Passionate & Demonic (Satwa, Rajas, Tamas), alongwith objects of material world as their buds. The roots keep humans growing for doing Karm & creates bondages. They bind the humans by bondages formed due to different Karm (Karmanu-Bandhini). This bondage creates instinct to do Karm, due to its potential difference between dualities & acts as a force that moves the world. One way it creates Bondage but at the same times, it is the basis of all Movements (Gati). Thus, going back, we started with Happiness & Pleasures vs Sorrows. How these dualities creates Bondage, immerse us in Illusion & Ignorance. This all happens as Soul gets covered by Ahamkar or I-ness to manifest in the form of Jeeva. Due to all these, soul goes into deep slumber & feels the experience of material life as Jeeva, due to Illusion (Bhranti). Bhagwan Shrikrushna gave example of Ashwatth tree (Ficus Religiosa), if turned upside down. Over the period, this tree develops large canopy & very deep roots, as if this material world having a small deep roots above, while the large canopy below, depicts spread of world & universe. Let us study more characteristics of it & cross this ocean of material life, by the solution as given in next verse. न रूपमस्येह तथोपलभ्यते नान्तो न चादिर्न च सम्प्रतिष्ठा| अश्वत्थमेनं सुविरूढमूल मसङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्त्वा||15.3|| Though we see this tree, but really it can't be perceived. Its form, its beginning, end, nor its Datum or Base, as it is deep rooted, nothing can be perceived though felt. This is supposed to be spread of illusory universe. This can be cut or removed by the Axe of Detachment with material world with strong Determination. Really, the involvement in life, its processes, every second experiences all are so deep as Jeeva feels it complete Reality & gets totally Attached with all these. We saw this earlier also, how the process of Detachment is to be followed, which is prescribed here in the verse. Let us see some more details from next verse in further write up. *||Om Shanti Shanti Shanti||*\n\n#newdaynewchapter It is said Hanumanji is the only avatar still roaming on earth. He is easy to be pleased. He is very dear and close to Shri Rama. So to meet Shri Rama it is always better to please hanuman. The story behind Hanuman Chalisa goes like this. Goswami Tulsidas was known as a very good astrologer before he wrote Ramayana. He gave a negative prediction for the Mughal king Akbar. The predictions came true and Akbar wanted Tulsidas to shift to his darbar which he refused. Akbar jailed Tulsidas. It was in jail Tulsidas started praying to hanuman and in the process he wrote Hanuman Chalisa. Chute bandi maha sukh hoi. Tulsidas ji was released within few days as Akbar realized his mistake. In all the stotra, Hanuman Chalisa the boon or Ashirwad which the related deity give always come in the end where as in Hanuman Chalisa it comes in the beginning. Bal buddhi vidya dehu mohi harau klaish vikar. Tulsidas knew the power and reliability of chalisa so he mentioned the benefits right in the beginning. Last but not the least hanuman is an avatar of Shiva. Prahalad the Chakravarti of kingdom of Bhaktas has told 9 types of Bhakthi towards the lord. Among them are the following two : Shravanam - Listening to the Lord’s stories, great deeds, and his divine qualities. Keertanam - Singing the Lord’s names all day long without wasting even a moment Both are equally good. Which is better depends on the person. Some like to listen while some like to sing. Follow your heart and choose. However, people may have different experiences and interpretations of the effects of religious or spiritual practices. It's important to remember that the impact of such practices can vary from person to person, and there's no universal rule. Although one thing is for sure, it makes you strong , your heart strong , if that is what you see as being emotionless, then maybe the answer to this is Yes! Jai Seeta Ram! Shri Hanuman Maharaj ki Jay.\n\n#newdaynewchapter According to Akhand Sutra, Savitur is the Sun-God. Gayatri is the dynamic female form of the formless Brahman (Paramatma). Savitur and Gayatri are not the same. Goddess Gayatri is not the consort of Savitur. Let us first explore, enumerate, and explain the fundamental concept of Gayatri. Chandogya Upanishad (3.12.1), “Gayantam Trayate iti Gayatri” means that the person, who chants (Gayantam) Gayatri Mantra, is protected (Trayate) by Gayatri. “Tat, Savitur Varenyam, Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi, Dhio Yonah Prachodayat!” The meaning of the three sets of three words (nine words) of this mantra is as follows. Tat: It represents the Ultimate, Formless, Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and all-pervasive Universal Consciousness called Nirakar-Nirgun-Brahman (God-Nature-Paramatma), the source of everything in the universe. Nirakar-Brahman manifests as Sakar-Brahman, the core united male (Shakta) Trinity (Trimurti) form of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. This form is popularly called Sri Dattatreya. Nirakar-Brahman also manifests as the female dynamic form (Shakti) with the five heads, which represent the five elements (Panch-Bhutas), namely, 1. Prithvi-Bhuta: The solid form of Earth-Bhu-Bhumi-Bhur. 2. Apa-Bhuta: The fluid water form. It also represents Saraswati, Goddess of Knowledge. 3. Agni-Bhuta: The fire-heat-burning form. It represents Lakshmi, Goddess of Wealth. 4. Vayu-Bhuta: The air form (atmosphere-Bhuva). It represents Parvati, Goddess of Moksha. 5. Akash-Bhuta: The plasmatic quintessence form. It represents the enlightening heaven (Suvah). This manifested form of the unmanifested Brahman is called Goddess Gayatri. The three heads of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva form the core male form (Shakta). The five heads of Goddess Gayatri form the dynamic female form (Shakti). Goddess Gayatri with five heads represents the Universal Consciousness of Maha-Brahmand. Savitur: Savitur means the Sun. The second focus of Gayatri Mantra is the Sun-God, the presiding deity of our Solar system, and the energizer of the living beings on the earth. Our Solar system is called Brahmand, an egg-shaped system. It is the microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic universe (Maha-Brahmand). Varenyam: It means brilliant effulgence or light of Sun, the life-giving force. Bhargo: It means splendor of the seven beautiful colors, namely, violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red (VIBGYOR) of the Sun-light. Devasya: It means divine. The higher world of the Solar system is called Brahmand. Dhimahi: It means self-surrender to the higher divine kingdom of Nature. Dhio: It means seeking or asking for blessings, grace, and illumination. Yonah: It means the specific wish of enlightenment. Prachodayat: It means given, graced or blessed by three forms of Goddess Gayatri. Shri Gayatri Mataji ki Jay\n\n#newdaynewchapter Sarvam Vishnnuhu - Everything is Vishnu (Universe) This means that the entire world is filled with Vishnu. The whole world is pervaded by Lord Vishnu- Bhaja govindam series. Imagine yourself watching a cinema in theater. It is common that you sit facing the screen and then feel impatient that the pictures are not appearing on the screen. After some time, pictures begin to appear on the screen and you feel happy. These pictures on the screen are continually changing. They do not remain permanently on the screen. The pictures that appear on the screen are Mithya. They are not permanent, but the screen is permanent. In this context, we should understand that the screen is real and the pictures are an illusion. The screen can be compared to Brahman. The permanent and all-pervasive Vishnu, and the impermanence of the world explain the true meaning of “Sarvam Vishnu Mayam Jagat.” Vishnu Purana says ‘Jyoteemshi Vishnuh – all bright objects are Vishnu in character’. Swami Chinmayananda quotes the following verse – “Jale vishnuh sthale vishnuh vishnur_Akasam uchyate | sthavaram jangamam vishnuh sarvam vishnu-mayam jagat Meaning: “Water is Vishnu, every place is Vishnu, the sky is Vishnu. Every movable or immovable object is Vishnu. In short everything in the world is nothing but Vishnu.” Ultimately, we call the higher power which sustains this universe Vishnu and he is everywhere, because he is everything. उत्पत्तिं प्रलयं चैव भूतानामागतिं गतिम् | वेत्तिं विद्यामविद्यां च स वाच्यो भगवानिति || He who understands the creation and dissolution, the appearance and disappearance of beings, the wisdom and ignorance, should be called Bhagavan. — (Vishnu Purana, VI.5.78) Bhagavan means the Almighty God who is the controller of all opulences, power, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation. He is the protector of His pure devotees. Although God is equally disposed to everyone, He is especially inclined to His devotees. The word Bhagwan has symbolic meaning too. The word encompasses Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space – the five elements. Thus the term Bhagavan translates as the manifestation of the physical form of universe. In the word भगवान (Bhagavan) – ‘भ’ stands for Bhoomi or Earth 'ग' stands for Gagan or Space ‘व’ stands for Vayu or Air ‘आ’ stands for Agni or Fire ‘न’ stands for Neer or Water Bhaga means “opulence” or “assets,” and van means “one who possesses.” Because God owns everything, He is called Bhagavan. The Vedic sage Parashar has defined Bhagavan as the one who possesses in full these assets: beauty, wealth, fame, strength, knowledge, and renunciation. The Learned Know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance Bramha, Paramatma or Bhagavan. Om Namo Narayana\n\nStarting trouble, continuity issues, facing obstacles after obstacles or feeling stagnant - In these moments it pays to understand the concept of 𝗚𝗮𝗻𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗮 to unlock what life has in store for us. Our ancients were wise enough to know that though every human is to be treated equally, their level of understanding life is unquestionably different. Indic Wisdom gives us a plethora of simple yet effective options to connect with the higher source. One of the easiest ways is through name and form i.e. worship of a chosen deity with appropriate processes for the same. Second, whether it is science or common sense, we understand that the World that we see with our naked eyes is made up of 5 elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. Thus, whatever is manifested, is made up of these 5 elements and that’s the reason we use the word ‘Prapancha’ to denote the Universe. Pra-pancha literally means, that which has come to light using 5 elements. Our tradition has mapped each of these elements (& corresponding senses) to the concept of Ādhāra i.e. support centers. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿 ‘𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗰𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿’ 𝗶𝘀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗿𝗮. Out of all these elements, the grossest is Earth. That center is called Moolādhāra: moola + ādhara i.e. root + support, commonly referred to as as Root / Earth Chakra, Among the many deities present to manage the function of this 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗸𝗿𝗮, the ancient Tantra texts mention 𝗚𝗮𝗻𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗮 as one amongst them. This is precisely why at the auspicious events we do not even wait for the idol or image of Ganesha but 𝗮 𝗹𝘂𝗺𝗽 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘆 𝗼𝗿 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗰 𝗶𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵 𝘁𝗼 𝗶𝗻𝘃𝗼𝗸𝗲 𝗛𝗶𝗺. Now, for those of us who are house-holders, irrespective of the stage of inner evolution we may be in, the living traditions extol us to invoke the Divine in name and form. Among the forms, Ganesha is given the primary importance. Even great renunciates such as the Gurus that decorate the venerated Sringeri and Kanchi Monasteries, make it a point to invoke the blessings of Ganesha. Some of the reasons why our tradition asks us to invoke Ganesha are: 1. 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗱𝗹𝗲𝘀 that might a. Have stopped us from the completing the undertaken tasks b. Hinder our progress in new tasks. 2. Developing 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 and 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗹𝗱-𝗹𝗶𝗸𝗲 𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 3. Making 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 in a calm way 4. Exhibiting 𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗺𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 and being practical 5. (secret) to relaxation and 𝗱𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝘀𝗹𝗲𝗲𝗽 This is the reason we are asked to go to bed soon, so that it not only allows the internal organs to function properly but enables us to wake up before Sunrise, the ideal time to start the day. In future, expect more on this subject, that satisfies scientific temper as well as uncompromising on esoteric insights. #Sleep #DecisionMaking\n\n#newdaynewchapter Ever wondered why is it that we worship Lord Ganesh first! According to the Ganapati Upanishad, he appeared even before the creation of nature (prakriti) and consciousness (purusha). This is an important link as to why he's is worshiped before beginning any task. According to the yogic perspective, anything we do has to fall under one of the two categories: material or spiritual. It's believed that Lord Ganesh rules the 'Muladhara chakra' of our body. 'Muladhara' is the interface between the material and the spiritual worlds. He controls both these worlds. He gives us material enjoyments in this world and liberates us from endless cycle of birth and death. According to yogic principles, our material life and spiritual journey starts from the 'Muladhara' chakra which is controlled by him. The head of Lord Ganesh symbolizes the atma or soul, which is considered the ultimate reality of humanity and his human body symbolizes Maya, the trappings of earthly existence. Gana’ means category. Everything we perceive through our senses or mind can be expressed in terms of category. The principle from which all these have manifested themselves is Ganapati, the Lord of categories. In effect, it means origin of whole creation, God Himself. Sanskrit word to denote elephant is ‘Gaja’. Hence the name Gajanan or Gajamukha for Ganapati. But the word ‘Gaja’ has a deeper connotation. ‘Ga’ indicates ‘Gati’, the final goal towards which the entire creation is moving. ‘Ja’ stands for ‘Janma’ or birth or origin. Hence ‘Gaja’ signifies God from whom the worlds have come out and towards whom they are progressing, to be ultimately dissolved in Him. The elephant head is thus purely symbolical and points to this truth. The elephant-human form of Ganapati is iconographical representation of great Vedantic dictum, ‘tat-twam-asi'(which means you the apparently limited individual are in essence the Cosmic Truth, the Absolute).Elephant stands for the cosmic, human stands for individual. It's believed that sage Vyasa requested Lord Ganesh to write Mahabharata as he recited it. He decided to do it after Vyasa agreed to recite it without any interruptions and Vyasa, in turn, made him promise he would understand what was being said before he wrote it. His popularity isn’t restricted to Hinduism.He appears as Buddhist God Vinayaka in Mahayana Buddhism too and is often seen dancing. He has distinct regional characteristics in Tibet, China,Japan.Earliest stone statue of Elephant God in China dates back to as AD 531. Indonesia prints Lord Ganesh on its 20,000 Rupiah note. Indonesia has strong cultural ties with India and Hinduism. Hinduism is practiced by 1.7% of total population, and 83.5% in Bali as of 2010 census. It is one of the dix official religions of Indonesia. Jay Sari Ganesh"
