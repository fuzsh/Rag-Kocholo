        "text": "Vishnu Sahasranamam\n\n(Meanings: based upon the commentary of Shankaracharya)\n\nMeanings: Courtesy: http://www.mypurohith.com\n\nSanskrit script courtesy: Shri. N. Krishnamachari: http://home.attbi.com/~chinnamma/\n\nVishnu Sahasranama means the Thousand Names of Vishnu. This narrative is based upon the commentary of Shankaracharya. Acharya sankara reached the feet of his Guru, Sri Govindapaachaarya, and on the bank of Narmada, the Nambootiri-boy from kaaladi got initiated into the secrets of the Mahaavaakyas. At the end of his short but intense study, sankara, the inspired missionary, wanting to fulfill his glorious work, craved from the blessings of his teacher. Govindapa Acharya tested sankara by ordering him to write an exhaustive commentary (Bhaashya) upon the Vishnu Sahasranaama. He accomplished his great task and the very first work of the Upanishadic commentator, sankara, the greatst Hindu missionary of the 7 th century, thus came to see the light of the day.\n\nGovindaacharya, satisfied with the proficiency of the student blessed him and set him on the road of service and action. Earning the grace of the teacher and the blessings of the Lord Vishnu, Sri sankara inaugurated an incomparable revival movement of the decadent culture of the 7th century Hinduism. We shall here follow closely Sankaras commentary and also draw our material from the Puranic literature that has an endless store of appeal to the hearts of all devotees.\n\nThe Vishnu Sahasranaama was composed by Sri Veda Vyaasa, the author of the Puraanas, and we meet this great chant in his classical work, the Mahaabaarata, Prince Yudhisthira, the eldest of the pandavas, at the end of the war approached Bheeshma Pitaamaha, when the mighty grandsire of the Kuru family was lying on the bed of arrows, unconquered and in conquerable, awaiting the scared hour of his departure to the feet of the lord. Yudhishthira, the righteous, asked six questions, Bheeshma, the constant devotee of Krishna, the gigantic Man of Action, calmly answered them all. This is how we find the Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu introduced in the immortal classic of the Hindus, the Mahaabaarata.\n\nFor the eradication of all obstructions, I meditate (\"dhyayeth\") on Vishnu, who is wearing (\"dharam\") a white (\"shukla\") cloth (\"ambara\"), who is of the color (\"varnam\") of the moon (\"sashi\"), who has four (\"chatur\") arms (\"bhujam\"), and who has a placid expression (\"prasanna\") on His face (\"vadanam\").\n\nShree Vaisham pãyana uvacha:\n\nShruthvã dharmãna séshéna pãvananicha sarvashahaYudhishtara shanthanavam punarévãbya bashatha\n\nVaisampayana, the narrator to Dhritrastra says: Yudhishthira, as a righteous man (\"dharamana\") of spiritual inclination, with the mortal integrity (\"paavanaani\") of a careful mortal, asks (\"bhaashatha\") Bhishma (\"shaantanavam\") quite an interesting set of questions which are typical queries which the heart of seekers will always ask.\n\nYudhishtira uvachaKimékam daivatham loke kim vápyekam parãyanam\n\nSthuvantha kam kamarchanda prapnuyur mãnavã shubam\n\nWho (\"kim\") is the greatest (\"ekam\") Lord (\"daivatam\") in the world (\"loke\")?\n\nWho is the one (\"ekam\") refuge (\"paraayanam\") for all?\n\nBy glorifying (\"sthuvantah\") whom (\"kam\") can man (\"manavah\") reach the Auspiciousness (\"shubam\") (peace and prosperity)?\n\nBy worshipping (\"archantah\") whom can a man reach auspiciousness (peace and prosperity)?\n\nKo dharma sarva dharmãnam bhavatha paramo mathaha\n\nKim japan muchyathé janthur janma samsãra bandhanãth\n\nWhat (\"ko\") is, in thy opinion, the Greatest Dharma?\n\nBy (\"kim\") doing japa of what can creatures (jantu) go beyond (\"mutchyate\") the bonds (\"bandhanaath\") of samsara?\n\nShree Bheeshmã UvachaJagath prabhum deva devam antham purushothamamSthuvan nãma sahasréna purusha saththo thithaha\n\nThe supreme (\"uttamam\") Purusha, who is ever up and working for the welfare of all, the Lord (\"prabhum\") of the world (\"jagat\") the endless (\"anantam\")  Sri Maha Vishnu.\n\nThameva chãr chayanth nithyam bhakthya purusha mavyayamDhayãyan sthuvan namasyamsha yajamãnas thamevacha 10\n\nBy meditating upon (\"sthuvan naama\"), by (\"cha\") worshipping (\"archayan\") and by prostrating at the same Purusha, man can reach true Auspiciousness.\n\nAnãdhinidhanam vishnum sarva lokamahesvaramLokãdhyaksham sthuvan nithyam sarva dhukkã thigo bhavéth\n\nThe greatest Dharma is the one Vishnu, who has neither a beginning (Aadi) nor an end (Nidhanam), the supreme Lord (\"maheshwaram\") of the world.

All creatures can go beyond the bonds of samsar, and he goes beyond all sorrows who daily (\"nityam\") chants (\"stuvan\") the sahasranaamas and within glorifies the knower of the world (Lokaadhyaksha).\n\nThe supreme is described as that from which the whole world of names and forms had risen in the beginning of the creation, that in which the world continues to exit, that into which alone the world can merge back during the Dissolution (Pralaya); this supreme is VISHNU.\n\nAfter thus answering all questions, His thousand Name, said Bheeshma, I shall now advise you. Please listen to them with all attention. This is how the Sacred Hymn, called as The thousand names of Lord Vishnu, is introduced in the Mahaabhaarata.\n\n------------------------------------------------------END: Meanings of the Dialogue------------------------------------------------\n\nExtra Comments: The Supreme cannot be defined and since He is the very substratum of all qualities, He cannot be denominated by any name, or indicated by any term, or defined in any language, or ever expressed, even vaguely, in any literary form. He is beyond both the Known and the Unknown. He is the very illumining Principle of Consciousness that illuminates all experiences.\n\nAnd yet He has many manifestations and, therefore, He can have infinite names in terms of His manifestations. Definitions should directly describe the thing defined, and here we have a thousand indirect definitions with which the Real, the Infinite is being indicated in terms of the unreal and the finite. These Thousand names of the Lord have been coined and given out by the Rishis. They were collected and strung together into a joyous Hymn to Vishnu, a garland of devotion and reverence, by the poet-seer Vyaasa.\n\nSince each of them is thus an indicative definition of the unknown in terms of the known, each term here is believed to rocket-us up into the realms of the divine experience, only when we have lifted our minds towards it through contemplation. Thus the Vishnu Sahasranaama is employed not only by the devotees, in the sweet attitude of sporting with the Lord, but these are also employed by the contemplative students of philosophy, as gliders to roam in the realms of inspired Higher Consciousness.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore commentary: In the Kali-Santarana Upanishad, which is one of the minor Upanishads, we find the great devotee Naarada approaching Brahmaaji to enquire what is the way out for man to evolve in these hard days of extrovertedness, which is quite natural and unavoidable in the Iron-age (Kaliyuga).Repetition of the names of Naaraayana is sufficient enough, was the reply given.\n\nIt is to be carefully noted here that in the sixth question the enquiry was how can creatures realise the Highest. Jantu means that which is born (Janana-dharman). So all living creatures are fit for this easy path. Creatures could even include the animal kingdom as it is described in the Puraanas in their own poetic language. In the Trikutaachala lake, the elephant that was caught by the crocodile is described as having been saved by the Lord (Gajendra Moksha). The story of Jadabharata is yet another example.\n\nSankara in his commentary describes here Japa as comprehensive of all the three types. (A) That which can be heard by others; (B) That which is heard by ourselves; (C) That which is mental.\n\nVishnu Sahasranaama can be employed in performing Japa of all these three kinds.\n\nIn the following Thousand Names, we meet with, though rarely, some repetitions. Exactly 90 names have been repeated in this Great Hymn; and of them, 74 are repeated twice, 14 are repeated thrice, and again 2 of them are found to have been repeated four times. Sometimes, the terms are repeated as such Vishnu- Vishnu, Siva-Siva etc. and sometimes different words with the same meaning are also employed (Sreepati- Maadhava; Pushkaraaksha- Kamalaaksha). These need not be considered as a defect, since this Hymn is a chant of His Glory .In a chant of glory (stuti) repetitions are acceptable-it is but a style of the emotional heart to repeat its declarations of love.\n\nThere are exactly 1,031 single Names of the Lord in the 1000-Name-Chant (Sahasranaama). The extra 31 Names are to be considered each as an adjective qualifying (Viseshana) the immediately following noun. When one makes Archanaa to the Lord the correct dative case is to be used. There are 20 double-names in the first 500 Names and 11 double-names in the second half of the chant. There is one indeclinable (Avyaya) word used, and it (896th) should be used in the dative for Archanaa as Sanaat Namah; so too the 929th Name in the chant, being a plural noun, should be used in Archanaa as Sadbhyo Namah.\n\nIt will also be found, as we study the significances of these Divine names, that Vyaasa has employed sometimes masculine gender, on other occasions feminine gender and some other times even neuter gender. Wherever it is masculine. , it denotes Vishnu, the Lord of Lakshmi. and when it is feminine it is indicative of His Might. Glory or power (devataa) that is manifest everywhere, and when the term is in neuter gender, it means Pure Brahman, the infinite Reality.\n\nThis Archanaa is generally performed by devotees daily; if this is not convenient they perform this worship at least on their own birth-days, on eclipse days and on the day on which the Sun moves from one zodiac to another (the Samkraanti-day). This performance has been prescribed by the Sastra for warding off troubles arising from the position of planets, anger of the rulers, incurable diseases and ruthless enemies. The highest effect is for purifying the mind and thus gaining more and more inner-poise for the Saadhaka in meditation.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nINSTALLATION OF THE LORD\n\nAll ritualisms start in Hinduism with a beautiful function-the installation of the Lord in the devotees own physical form. This is technically called as Anga-Nyaasa and Kara-Nyaasa. The Installation in the Limbs, and the Installation in the Palm. This is a method by which the seeker with wilful thoughts and deliberate physical signs sanctifies himself to be a Divine Temple and installs various sacred deities in himself.\n\nThis helps the student to realise that though he is worshipping the Lord as a Goal (or an Ideal) other than himself (bheda or anya), in fact, he is to seek his identity with no traces of differentiation (Abheda or Ananya), between himself and the Lord. The final realization is a perfect identity indicated in the Mahaavaakya. I am Brahman. (Aham Brahmaasmi).\n\nNeither in the Northern texts nor in the original Mahaabhaarata do we find this subjective installation ceremony (Anga-Nyaasa) prescribed. However, pundits of ritualism in the South employ the Anga-Nyaasa; and it being such a beautiful act, so very helpful to the seekers, we give here below the most popular one practised widely in the South.\n\nThis Installation Ceremony declares to the devotees that the enchanting form of Vishnu is to be ultimately realised as One Infinite Reality without names or forms-in which the recognition of even the distinction of the meditator-meditated- meditation is to cease. Beside this deep significance, even though it be only for the time being, the student is also given a sense of purity and sanctity in himself. Just as a devotee feels highly inspired in the divine atmosphere of a sacred temple, so too, after the Anga-Nyaasa, however shattered we might have been, before we entered the Pooja-room, we can artificially work ourselves up into a divine mood of peace and purity.\n\nThe body itself is rendered as the temple of the Lord, wherein the various limbs become the altars upon which, with a heart of love and faith, the devotee invokes and installs various deities. In this process, in order to bring the full blast of the sacred suggestions to him, the repetition of each of these mantras is emphasised by a corresponding physical sign. The idea is only, as we have already explained, to establish the correct mood for devoted contemplation.\n\nA. asya Vishnu-sahasranaama-stotrasya veda-vyaasa Rishih\n\nFor this sacred chant, the Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu, Sri Veda Vyaasa is the divine Rishi.\n\nGreat mantras of deep spiritual significance and sublime Vedic dignity are not mere poetic compositions by mortal fallible intellects. When a. mastermind through meditation transcends the lower levels of his personality and soars into the higher mental altitudes, through his contemplation, there he receives certain revelations that are faithfully repeated by them to the world. Such heard statements (Srutam) alone have the power to stand against the onslaught of the intellect, the ravages of time, the forces of criticism etc.\n\nSuch statements when contemplated upon by lesser seekers, they too, in the spiritual cadence of these mantras, get unconsciously uplifted into realms unknown, and there they come to live a world of experiences unfrequented by the ordinary multitudes. The author of the mantra is thus termed in our Vedas as the Seer (Mantra- Drashtaa). Such Rishis themselves admit that they did not manufacture, compose or create the mantra, but they had a revelation or vision (Darsanam) of the mantra.\n\nThe Mantra- Drashtaa, the Rishi, is the guru of the seeker, who is seeking his path with the help of that particular mantra. The Rishi of a mantra is installed at the roof of the head and the seeker, in his seat of Vishnu-Sahasranaama-chanting,\n\nSymbolism: ... chants this mantra in his mind, and, with his right-hand thumb, middle-finger and ring-finger touches the top of his head.\n\nB. Anushtup Chandah\n\nThe metre (\"chandah\") in which the revealed mantra comes to the teacher is also mentioned because it orders the discipline that should be followed while chanting the mantra. Anushtup is the name of the particular metre in which this thousand-name- chant on Vishnu is sung. The chant is to come out through the mouth, and therefore, the altar of the metre can be only the mouth.\n\nSymbolism: The fingers that were touching the roof of the head now come down to touch the lips, when the mantra B is repeated in the mind by the seeker.\n\nC. Sri Vishvaroopo Mahaavishnur-Devataa\n\nLord Vishnu of the form of the entire universe of variegated names and forms (Vishva-roopah) is the deity of the mantra. Vishnu is the theme of the chant. The Lord of Vaikuntha is the altar at which the devotee is preparing to offer himself in humble dedication and utter surrender.\n\nSymbolism: Since Lord Vishnu is, to the devotee, the Lord of his heart, the very centre of his personality, while chanting mentally the mantra 'C' the student, installs the Lord in his heart, bringing the fingers from the lips down to touch his bosom.\n\nD. Devakee-nandanah srashteti Saktih\n\nEvery deity is a manifestation of the mighty Omnipotency of the Supreme. The creator and sustainer (Srashtaa) of Dharma, the son of Devaki (Devakeenandana), is the manifested power (\"shaktih\") of the Almighty.\n\nSymbolism: This creative power of righteous-ness and peace is installed at the navel (naabhi) point, and, therefore, the fingers come down from the heart region to the navel.\n\nE. Sankha-bhrit nandakee chakree iti Keelakam\n\nThe mighty Creative Power invoked and established on the navel region cannot be as such conceived by the mind. Therefore, to nail it down (Keelakam) and establish it in our comprehension, this mantra conceives (\"udbavah\") the Power as the Lord, who bears the Conch (\"shanka\"), the Sword, named Nandaka, and the Discus (\"chakra\"). This is only to show how the total cosmic Power, expressed in terms of our present understanding as creation, sustenance, and destruction, is but a manifestation of the Lord. The conch (Sankha) represents the call of the Reality, the Lords own declarations stated in the scriptures. Nandaka, the sword that punishes to bring joy (Nandana) into the community and the destruction, without which evolution is impossible, is represented by the concept of the Discus (Chakra).\n\nHere it is also to be noted that the blowing or the conch represents speech; wielding the sword represents action and the discus that takes off from Him at His will, represents his thoughts. Thus this great Power installed at the navel expresses itself in the world through speech, action and thought.\n\nSymbolism: To conceive fully this form is to hold firmly the Lords own feet, and, therefore, when this mantra is mentally chanted, the fingers move away from the navel, and with both hands the seeker touches his own feet.\n\nHere it is to be carefully noted how:\n\nthe Guru is kept at the roof of the head,\n\nthe Veda (metre) in the mouth,\n\nthe Lord in the heart,\n\nthe Power in the navel and, thereby, the seeker himself becomes so sacred that he prostrates unto himself by holding his own feet.\n\nF. Saarnga-dhanvaa-gadaa-dhara iti Astram\n\nWhenever there is a large wealth in a box it becomes a treasure and it is locked and safely protected; when this divine installation has taken place, and therefore, the body has become the Temple of the Almighty, and therefore, it has become a scared treasure house to be protected. But the seeker himself has no power to protect, and so, he invokes the very weapon (Astra) of Vishnu, the protector of the world, to stand by for the defence of the sanctified bosom. Saarga is the name of the Bow (Dhanus) of Vishnu and the Mace (Gadaa) is another of his weapons. These two form the artillery of defence; which are manned by the Lord himself.\n\nSymbolism: At this moment when this mantra is mentally chanted, it is significant that the student lifts the palm away from the feet, and with the stretched out index and middle fingers of the right palm snaps them on the open left palm.\n\nG. Rathaangapaanir-akshobhya iti Netram\n\nLord Vishnu as Lord Krishna played the part of the charioteer and gained the name Rein-handed (Ratha-anga-paani). A charioteer has to guide every step of every horse in order that the chariot be safe, and the travel be pleasant. Of the sense organs, the eyes (\"netram\") are the most powerful and once they are well guided, all others also follow their heels. When Lord Vishnu, the charioteer, Himself is installed in the eyes (\"netram\"), the individual is safe (\"rakshobya\") in his spiritual pilgrimage.\n\nSymbolism: Therefore, invoking the Divine Driver, with reins in his hand (Rathaangapaani), He is installed in the pair of eyes, and at the moment of mentally chanting this, both the eyes are touched by the tip of the fingers.\n\nH. Trisaamaa saamagah saameti Kavacham\n\nHe (Tri-Saamaa) who is glorified by all the three (\"tri\") types, of Saama songs (Deva-Vrata-Prokta), He who is the very theme that is glorified by the Saama songs (Saamagah), He whose glory itself is the manifested Sama Veda (Saama), He is none other than the Supreme This great Lord is installed a, an armour (\"kavacham\") to wear for self-protection.\n\nSymbolism: While chanting this in the mind the seeker first touches with the tip of his finger, of each arm, the same shoulders, and afterwards crosses the arm, in front of him making fingers of each palm touch the other shoulder-as if he is actually wrapping himself and wearing the divine armour.\n\nI. Anandam brahmeti Yonih\n\nThe Supreme (\"para\") Brahman, the Infinite Bliss (\"anandam\") is (\"eti\") the very womb (Yonih) from which the universe has emerged out. The procreated world of endless variety has only one Eternal Father, and this source is immaculate Bliss. When this is chanted the seeker installs the Bliss Infinite at the very place of procreation in himself. It is a spot in this great divine temple of the body, wherein is the one source, from which the world has emerged out, manifesting itself as the power of procreation (Taittireeya).\n\nJ. Visvaroopa iti Dhyaanam\n\nThe entire band of experience gained through the instruments of the body, mind and intellect in terms of perceptions, emotions and thoughts together is indicated by the term Visva. He, who has manifested to be the total world of experiences (Visva), must therefore be Visvaroopah. The cosmic form of the Lord (Visvaroopa) is the total universe. Thus to meditate (Dhyaanam) upon Him as the whole universe, is a method of installing Him in our intellect.\n\nSymbolism: At this moment the student locks his fingers and sits in meditation.\n\nK. Ritam sundarasnah kaala iti Dikbandhah\n\nTruth (Ritam), the lord, and his weapon, the discus, called Sudarsana, and his annihilating power, Time (Kaala)-these three are the mighty forces that guard this scared temple of life in the seeker at the outer frontier of his world of influence (Dik-Bandhah). To be truthful and ever to seek the great Reality (Ritam), to discriminate and see the play of the Lord in all situations (Su-Darsanam), and to control the very instrument of the time (Kaala), which is intellect in the seeker, is to guard the frontiers of ones spiritual world, against the hoards of inimical forces.\n\nSymbolism: At this moment the student snaps his middle finger with the help of his thumb and runs his palm around his head.\n\nL. Sree-mahaa-vishnu-preetyarthe jape Viniyogah\n\nHaving thus installed through sankalpa the Lord in himself and having come under the protecting wings of the mighty lord, here is the declaration how he is going to employ himself in it. He is going to engage himself (Viniyoga) in japa (jape) of the Thousand Names of Lord (\"sahasra-naama\"). Now the question is: with what motive should be undertake this chanting? The answer is in the very statement that it is only for the grace (Preetyarthe) of Sree Maha Vishnu.\n\nSymbolism: After chanting this declaration in the mind, the saadhaka, takes a spoon of water (Teertham) in his right palm and pours it on the floor in front of him.\n\nA true seeker is not desire-ridden for material satisfaction, and, therefore, he can have only one intention-the grace of lord, which will manifest in him as contemplative power.\n\nThese twelve slogans are chanted for invoking and installing these refreshing and spiritually benign ideas on the limbs of the devotee himself. At this juncture this makes him inspired sufficiently for higher meditation upon the truth as indicated and directed by the thousand terms in Sahasranaama.\n\nThis beautiful subjective ritual is known as Installation on the limbs (Anga-nyaasa). Not only that the student temporarily discovers a new surge of inspiration, but even beginners feel highly relieved, at least temporarily, from the load of his senses of sins. When this is properly performed with a right attitude and devotion, the student gains identification (saaroopya) with the Lord of his heart, at the outer levels of his personality.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE MEDITATION STANZA\n\nsaantaakaaram bhujaga-sayanam\n\npadmanaabham suresam\n\nWe meditate (\"vande\") upon the master (\"naatham\") of the universe (\"sarva-lokaika\"), lord Vishnu, who is ever peaceful (\"shaanta-aakaaram\"), who lies on the great serpent-bed (\"bhujaga-shayanam\"), from whose navel (\"nabhi\") springs the lotus (\"padma\") of the creative power, who is the controller (\"eesham\") of the gods (\"sura\").\n\nvisvaadhaaram gagana-sadrisam\n\nmegha-varnam subha-angam\n\n... whose form (\"aakaaram\") is the entire universe (\"vishwa\"), and who is the foundation (\"aadhaaram\") for the universe. who is all pervading (\"sadrusham\") as the sky(\"gagana\"), of the hue (\"varnam\") of the cloud (\"megha\"), of fascinating beauty (\"shuba-angam\"),\n\nLaksmikantam Kamalanayanam\n\nYogibhir-dhyaana-gamyam\n\n... the lord (\"kaantam\") of Laksmi, the lotus (\"kamala\") eyed (\"nayanam\"), he who dwells in the hearts (\"bhir\") of the yogis and who can be approached (\"gamyam\") and perceived through meditation (\"dhyaana\"),\n\nvande vishnum bhava-bhaya-haram\n\nsarva-lokaika-naatham.\n\nWe pray to (\"vande\") to Lord Vishnu, he who is the destroyer (\"haram\") of the fear (\"bhaya\") of samsara (\"bhava\") and the Lord of all (\"sarva\") the worlds (\"loka\").\n\nThis is the meditation upon the form of the lord, visualising Him thus in His, all-Comprehensive nature, and meditating upon Him, the seeker starts the vishnu-sahasranaama chanting.\n\n(Approximate meanings:\n\nWhose body is of the dark (\"shyamam\") like the clouds (\"megha\").\n\nHe lives (\"vaasam\") in the pure ocean of milk (\"peeta-kousheya\").\n\nHe has Lakshmi (\"sri\") in his chest (\"vatsangam\"). )\n\n[\"shanka\" = conch, \"chakram\" = discus; \"kireeta\" = crown; \"kundalam\" = ear-rings,\n\n\"peeta\" = yellow, \"vastram\" = clothes; \"saraseeruha-ekshanam\" = lotus-like eyes;\n\n\"sahaara\" = wide; \"vakshasthala\" = chest; \"kaustubha\" = gem stone;\n\n\"namaami\" = i pray; \"sirasaa\" = bow down with my head; \"chatur-bhujam\" = to the four-handed one;\n\n\"chandra-aananam\" = moon-faced; \"baahum\" = hands ]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStanza 1\n\nOm visvam vishnur- vashatkaarobhoota-bhavya-bhavat-prabhuh\n\nbhoota-krit bhoota-bhith bhaavobhootaatmaa bhoota-bhaavanah\n\n(1) Visvam - He whose manifestation is the whole universe of forms: the Viraat-Purusha. The cause is always present in the effects and as such That Form from which the whole universe has emerged out can only be its own manifestation. The whole cosmos of gross forms is His own expression, and therefore, He is called as Viraatpurusha. Sa eva Sarva- Bhootaatmaa Visvaroopo Yato-Avyayah. The Sanskrit term Visvam comes from the root Vis, to enter: Thus it means He who has created and entered into the entire universe, as the All-Pervading Reality. It can also mean, That into which the entire universe has entered to remain therein established. In the Upanishads also we have assertions of similar ideas. It is only when intellectually, we view the Lord that we come to recognise Him as the cause for the universe. When viewed through contemplation, since the effect is nothing other than the cause, there can be no world other than Him. In fact, there is nothing other than the Supreme. In the Mandukya Upanishad we read Omkaara Evedam Sarvam. In Geeta OM ltyekaaksharam Brahma.\n\n(2) Vishnuh -The term Vishnu is dissolved as Veveshti Vyaapnoti iti Vishnuh-That which pervades everywhere is Vishnu. That which has the nature of pervasiveness is Vishnu. He is the one who pervades all and nothing ever pervades Him. Eesaavaasyam Idam Sarvam-All this is indwelt, pervaded by the Lord. This very same idea is described in the typical style of the Puranas, in the incarnation of the Lord as Vaamana, the short-boy (Vamana), who, with His three feet, measured the entire universe. Because of this act, the Lord got the name Vishnu, says Mahaabhaarata. Vishnu Purana (3-1) says: The root Vis means to enter. The entire world of things and beings is pervaded by Him and the Upanishad emphatically insists in its mantra whatever that is there is the world of change. Hence it means that He is not limited by space (Desa), time (Kaala) or substance (Vastu).\n\n(3) Vashatkaarah - ln the ritualistic portion of the Vedas we find many mantras ending with vashat and they are used in pouring devoted and dedicated oblations. Thus the term Vashatkaara means: He who is invoked, and for propitiating whom, the oblations are poured in Vedic ritualism, using mantras ending with vashat.\n\nAlso Vashatkaara can mean yajna in its association and thus the term in its suggestion can signify He who is of the form of the Yajna. In the Upanishads also we find this meaning endorsed when the Upanishad mantra says: Yajno vai Vishnuh - Yajna itself is Vishnu.\n\n(4) Bhoota-bhavya-bhavat-prabhuh - He who is the Lord (Prabhu) of the Past (Bhooita), the Future (Bhavya) and the Present (Bhavat). Time is the concept of the intellect; it expresses itself in the interval between experiences. Experiences are registered as thoughts and thoughts are ever changing. This very change is known and experienced by us. The knower of the change must be something other than the change. Thus, He who is the Illuminator of all changes, meaning the Consciousness (Aatman) is the Lord Vishnu. He is the One who is not conditioned by time.\n\n(5) Bhoota-krit -The Creator (Krit) of all creatures (Bhoota). This word can be dissolved in two ways:\n\n(a) One who creates the creatures (Bhootaani Karoti iti Bhoota- Krit) or\n\n(b) One who annihilates all creatures (Bhootaani Krindati iti Bhoota-krit).\n\nIn both these cases, Brahman, the Supreme is the One Reality that seems to function as the Creator, Sustainer or Destroyer, when He functions through different gunas in the Total-Mind. Functioning through a preponderance in Rajoguna, He becomes the Creator; through Sattvaguna the Sustainer, and through Tamoguna, He Himself expresses as the Destroyer.\n\nExtra comments: Subjectively, the Atman functioning through my own mind and intellect is I, the individuality. My personality entirely depends upon the quality and texture of my own thoughts. I myself become according to the moods of my mind the creator, sustainer and annihilator of my world of experiences. He who manifests and functions, in these three aspects, is the Supreme Vishnu.\n\n(6) Bhoota-bhrit -One who nurtures (\"brith\") and nourishes all beings (living creatures: \"bhoota\") in all their attitudes is this Great Reality and, therefore, He is called as the Bhoota Bhrit. In Geeta there is an elaborate description of this idea in the l5th Chapter where the Lord points out how, He, as the light in the sun, fertility in the earth, growth in the plants, nourishment in food, heat in fire, -becomes Himself the eater, and, therefore, how He Himself presides over all the functions of the body and mind, and apparently nurtures and nourishes the creatures, who are in fact nothing other than Himself.\n\n(7) Bhaavah -One who becomes (Bhavati iti Bhaavah) Himself into the movable and the Immovable beings and things in the world. He is the Pure Existence in all the sentient organisms and the insentient objects in the universe. Hence He is indicated by the term Bhaavah.\n\n(8) Bhootaatmaa -He is the Aatman (soul) of all the beings (\"bhoota\"): The very Be in the living beings. Just as the same universal space manifests in all rooms as the room-space, so the Infinite Life manifesting through any given vehicle is called the Aatman of the vehicle. It is well known that space everywhere is one and the same; so too, the One Reality sports as though different Aatmans. This One Universal Soul is called in Vedanta the Supreme Brahman (Para-Brahman) .In Bhaagavata, the Lord is addressed as You are the One Self in all living creatures ever illumining all their experiences. In Kathopanishad: The One enchanting Truth that revels in every form manifesting in plurality.\n\n(9) Bhoota-bhaavanah -One who creates and multiplies the creatures; meaning the One, who is the cause for the birth and who is responsible for the growth of all living creatures.\n\nStanza 2\n\npootaatmaa paramaatmaa chamuktaanaam paramaa gatih\n\navyayah purushah saaksheekshetrajno akshara eva cha.\n\n10) Poota-atmaa -One with an extremely Pure (Pootam) Essence; One who is not affected the least by the impurities of Maayaa. The Self is beyond all vaasanaas and, therefore, He cannot be affected by anyone of the manifestations of Maayaa such as thoughts of the intellect, emotions of the mind or the perceptions of the body. Immaculate is ever the Self, and so He is termed as the Pure Self (Poota-Aatmaa).\n\n(11) Parama-atmaa -The Supreme, meaning that which transcends all limitations and imperfections of matter: in short, the Transcendental Reality. The Spirit is other than matter, and that in its presence, the vestures of matter, borrowing their dynamism from Him, play their parts rhythmically at all times. This has been the assertion found chorusly repeated in all the Upanishads and in the entire Vedantic literature. Sankara in Aatma Bodha points out that the Self is other than the three bodies and that He functions in the microcosm as a king in the nation. It was also said therein that matter borrows its energy from the Spirit and continues its activity as the world from the Sun.\n\nKathopanishad and the Geeta guide us from the outer levels of our personality, stage by stage, into the inner-most sanctum, and there, the teachers declare, is He the Infinite, transcending all, reigning in His own glory. In short, that which remains other than the cause and effect-Maayaa and matter-is He, the Parama Aatman. In Vishnu Purana this Supreme is glorified as Maha Vishnu (Paramaatmaa)-Vishnu Purana 6.4.10...\n\n(12) Muktaanaam paramaa gatih -He who is the final Goal (\"parama gathi\"), that is reached by all the liberated souls (\"mukta\"). The limitations and bondages lived through by man are in fact the destiny of the matter vestures. Through delusion of non-understanding, we identify with them and come to suffer the consequent sense of imperfections. To liberate ourselves from the thraldom of matter is to realize the Self. Hence the Truth is defined as the Supreme Goal of the emancipated.\n\nThis Goal to be attained is called as Gati in Sanskrit, The Supreme Goal (Paramaa Gatih) would necessarily be then that Goal, having reached which, there is no return:\n\nThere where having gone, men never return, That sacred place is My seat-Geeta Ch. 15. St. 6. In Geeta. (Ch. 8. St. 6)\n\neven more explicitly the same idea has been asserted by Sri Krishna when He says:\n\nO Son of Kunti, having reached Me, there shall be no more any re-birth.\n\nAgain, He defines the final Goal as That having reached no return again  Geeta Ch. 15, st.4.\n\n(13) Avyaah Vyaya means destruction; destruction cannot be without change; therefore, that which is without destruction (Avyayah) is the changeless. The Indestructible, and therefore, changeless, can never have any modifications (Parinaama). For, modification is but the death of a previous condition and the birth of a new condition. The Eternal and the Immutable (Avyayah) is the Supreme Sat-chit- aananda, and every other thing and being come under the hammer or change. The medium in which all these changes are sustained is Brahman, the Immutable. The Upanishads glorify Him as Ajaro Amaro Avyayah-without old age, death or change.\n\n(14) Purushah -One who dwells in the Fort-city (Puri sete iti Purushah). Herein metaphorically the Rishis conceive our body as a fortress with nine gate-ways-Nava Dvaarc Pure Dehee-(Geeta Ch. 5, St. 13) -and declare the One who rules within it, like a king, is the Self.\n\nThis term can also be dissolved in two more different ways giving more and more suggestions to the nature of the Self. Thus, Purusha can mean That which was before all creatures -Puraa Aaseet iti Purushah or it can be\n\nOne who completes and fulfils the Existence everywhere, meaning, without whom Existence is impossible (Poorayati iti Purushah).\n\nThis Aatman remains in the bodies of living creatures as their individuality (Jeeva) and in all the activities, physical, mental and intellectual, Aatman is not in fact involved but He is therein only an observer of all that is happening. This will become clear in the following discussion.\n\n(15) Saakshee -Witness. In every day life he is a witness who without any mental reservation or personal interest observes and watches what is happening in a given field of experience. Saakshaad Drashtari Saakshee syaad-Amarakosa. The Knower in every bosom is the same Supreme Self, says Lord Krishna (Geeta Ch. 13, St. 3). Though thus Consciousness illumines everything, It is only a Witness, as It knows no change. Just as the sun illumines every thing in the world and yet the Sun is not affected by the condition of the things it is illumining, so too Vishnu, the Supreme, illumines all, without Itself undergoing any change.\n\nAccording to Paanini Sutras the word Saakshee is derived from Sa +akshi, meaning direct perceiver.\n\n(16) Kshetrajnah -One who knows the body and all the experiences from within the body, is the Knower-of-the- field, Kshetrajnah. As Brahmapurana would put it: Bodies are fields and the Atman illumines them all without an effort, and therefore, is called Knower-of-the-field, Kshetrajnah.\n\n(17) Aksharah -lndestructible: things which are finite are necessarily conditioned by time and space; the Infinite is unconditioned, and so It is Aksharah. Since It is Indestructible, It cannot come under the methods of universal destruction arising from nature or through the wilful actions of man. It cannot be cleaved by instruments of destruction, nor can fire burn It, nor water drench It, nor air dry It-(Geeta Ch. 2, St. 23). It is also indicated that the Supreme Brahman is the Akshara-Aksharam Brahma Paramam -(Geeta Ch. 8, St. 3).\n\nPlease note that in the stanza there is the extra word only (Eva) used, indicating that Kshetrajnah is the Aksharah; there is no difference between them both: the Knower-of-the-field and the field.\n\nStanza 3\n\nyogoh yoga-vidaam netaapradhaana-purushesvarah\n\nnaarasimha- vapuhsreemaan kesavah purushottamah.\n\n(18) Yogah -The one who is to be known or realized through yoga. By withdrawing the sense organs from their objects of preoccupation, when the mind of the seeker becomes quietened, he is lifted to a higher plane-of-consciousness, wherein he attains yoga, meaning wherein he realizes the Reality. At such moments of equanimity and mental quiet yoga is gained: Samatvam yoga uchyate- (Geeta Ch. 2, St. 48).\n\nSince He is experienced through Yoga He is known as Yogah.\n\n(19) Yoga-vidaam netaa One who guides (\"neta\") all the activities of all men who knows yoga (Yogaviti) .To all men of realization, He who is the Ideal, is the Supreme Lord. Just as our activities are today ordered by our selfishness and individuality, the Ideal that commands and orders all activities in the bosom of a Man of Realization is his God-Consciousness. This realm of experience is Mahaa Vishnu. In the Geeta also we find the same idea expressed, in the language of emotion, when the Lord says: Those who contemplate upon Me with total dedication, their daily welfare and spiritual progress I shall bear.\n\n(20) Pradhaana-purusha-eesvarah -Lord of both Pradhaana and Parusha.\n\nThe term Pradhaana means maayaa-the total cause for the entire universe of forms.\n\nThe term Purusha indicates the individuality in each one of us-the Jeeva.\n\nLord Eesvara means the Master (Eeshte iti Eesvarah).\n\nThe Lord of Maayaa and Jeeva means the one who makes both these possible to exist and function. The One Infinite Reality which Itself manifests as Maayaa, Jeeva and Eesvara is the Essence in Vishnu.\n\n(21) Naarasimha-vapuh -One whose form (\"vapuh\") is half human (\"nara\") and half lion (\"simha\").This is the famous fourth incarnation of Lord Vishnu which He took in order to destroy the atheistic tyrant Hiranyakasipu and bless his devotee, Prahlaada.\n\n(22) Sreemaan -One who is always with (\"maan\") Sree. Mother Sree is Mother Lakshmi. In the Puranic terminology Lakshmi stands for all powers, all faculties. The total manifested power potential in the Omnipotent is Lakshmi. These powers are ever in Him and therefore, He is the Sreemaan.\n\n(23) Keshavah -He who has beautiful and graceful (Va) locks of hair (Kesa) is familiar as in Lord Krishnas form. Or, it can also mean, one who destroyed (\"vah\") the demon Kesin who was sent to destroy the child-Krishna by his uncle Kamsa This interpretation is endorsed by the Vishnu Purana, 5.16.23.\n\n(24) Purushottamah -The constitution of the individuality, Jeeva, when analysed, we find that it is made up of both the perishable-matter and the Imperishable-Spirit. The Spirit expressing through matter is the individuality, Jeeva. Reflected moon is the moon of the heavens dancing on the surface of water. Just as the moon is something different from its reflections and the water surfaces, so too the Self is, in its transcendental nature, something different from both matter, the perishable, and Spirit, the Imperishable, ever playing in matter. This Transcendental Truth is indicated by the term the Supreme Purusha (Purusha-uttama).\n\nStanza 4\n\nsarvas-sharvas-sivah sthaanurbhootaadir nidhir-avyayah\n\nsambhavo bhaavano bhartaaprabhavah prabhur-eesvarah.\n\n(25) Sarvah -He who is the all. He being the One cause from which have sprung forth all things and beings. He himself is the all. In Mahabharata Udyoga Parva (70-12) we read: As He is the origin and end of all, whether existent or otherwise, and as He, at all times, cognises all, He is called Sarva. All waves rise from the same ocean and, therefore, the ocean is the very essence in all waves.\n\n(26) Sharvah - The Auspicious One: meaning, the One who gives auspiciousness to those who hear of Him, to those who have a vision of Him, and to those who meditate upon Him.\n\n(27) Sivah -The One who is Eternally Pure. In Him can never be any contamination of the imperfection of Rajas and Tamas. Non-apprehension of Reality is Tamas and misapprehensions of Reality constitute the Rajas. In the Reality Itself there can be neither of them He is Brahman; He is Siva, so the Upanishad declares of the Absolute Oneness, which is Vishnu.\n\n(28) Sthaanuh: -Generally this term Sthaanuh is used for the permanent pillars that mark the frontiers of a country. They are permanent, immovable, fixed. The Truth, that remains thus firm and motionless, without movement, permanently established in Its own Realm of Purity, is called by the term Sthaanuh-the Pillar. Eternal, All-Pervading, the Pillar, Motionless (is) this Ancient One, so says Geeta Ch. 2, 24.\n\n(29) Bhootaadih - The very cause (\"aadi\") for the five great elements: Space, Air, Fire, Water and Earth.\n\n(30) Avyayah Nidhih -The Imperishable treasure. The term Nidhi means that in which precious things are stored away or preserved secretly: (Nidheeyate Asmin iti Nidhih). Therefore, He who is the substratum-container-for the entire universe is the Nidhi. During the dissolution (sleep) the One into Whom all things go to lie merged therein temporarily, till the next projection or creation (waking), as this Immutable Treasure Chest-the Vishnu. Here unchangeable (Avyaya) is qualifying Nidhi.\n\n(31) Sambhavah -One who takes up by his own free will various incarnations for the glory of the world is Sambhavah. In fact, He alone is the source of all that is created. In Harivamsa we read the assertion: I am the Narayana, the Source from which all creatures and things spring forth.To uphold Dharma I shall manifest again and again, declares the Lord in His Geeta:\n\n(32) Bhaavanah -To do Bhaavana is to give: One who gives everything to His devotees is Bhaavanah. The Lord is One who gives both joy and sorrow to each one according to his deserts. In the case of humanity it is He again who destroys the evil and blesses the good.\n\n(33) Bhartaa -The One who Governs the entire living world. Governing includes protecting the world from all harms and serving it positively with progress and joy. One who does these to all creatures at all times is Vishnu-the great Bhartaa.\n\n(34) Prabhavah - The One who is the very womb of all the Five Great Elements. It is That from which even the very concepts of time and space have sprung from.\n\n(35) Prabhuh -The Almighty Lord. He who is the All-Powerful. He who has the supreme freedom to do (Kartum), not to do (Akartum), or to do quite differently from what He had already done (Anyathaa Kartum) is considered as the Prabhuh.\n\n(36) Eesvarah -One who has the ability to do anything without the help of other beings or things is called Eesvara.\n\nStanza 5\n\nsvayambhooh sambhur aadityah pushkaraaksho mahaasvanah\n\nanaadi-nidhano dhaataa vidhaataa dhaaturuttamah.\n\n(37) Svayambhooh -The one who manifests Himself from Himself is considered as self-made. Everything born or produced must have a cause. The Supreme is the cause from which all effects arise, and Itself has no cause. This un- caused Cause-of-all, this Ultimate Cause, with reference to which every thing else is considered as effects is in itself the Absolute Cause. This idea is indicated by the term Self-made (Svayambhooh).\n\n(38) Shambhuh -He who brings Auspiciousness- both inner goodness and outer prosperity to His devotees. Sambhuh is one of the famous names of Lord Siva. By using this term in invoking Vishnu, by its suggestion, it declares that Vishnu and Siva are not two Divine Entities, but they are both manifestations of the One Essential Reality.\n\n(39) Aadityah-The Truth (Purusha) that glows with a golden splendour in the solar system is called Aadityah. There are twelve Aadityas and of them One is called Vishnu.\n\nKrishna Himself declares, I am Vishnu among the Aadityas -Aadityaanaam Aham Vishnuh- (Geeta Ch. 10, St. 21).\n\nThe word Aaditya can mean Son of Aditi-signifying the one who was born as the son of Aditi in His Vaamana incarnation.\n\nThe term Aadityah can also mean in Sanskrit One who is like the sun. The Sun is the one who illumines all, and every living creature draws its nurture and nourishment directly or indirectly always from the sun alone. In the same way Brahman is the one Sun in the universe of living creatures illumining all experiences of all creatures.\n\n(40) Pushkaraakshah -One who has eyes (\"akshah\") like the lotus (\"pushkara\"). Joy and Peace in the bosom of an individual are expressed in the world outside at no other point so vividly as in the eyes. The One, whose inner peace and joy, beaming out through His eyes, bring into the devoted hearts all the aesthetic beauty and romantic thrills of seeing a lotus dancing in the breeze, In short, the term indicates the Lord who with His beautiful looks, magically lifts all the sorrows in the devotees heart and fills it with Peace, Joy and Perfection.\n\n(41) Mahaasvanah- One who possesses thundering (\"mahaa\") voice of compulsion: \"Svana\" means sound. One whose call is thundered in all hearts, familiarly known as the compelling whisper of the Higher.\n\nOr, Svanam can also mean breath; and so, the term can mean, He whose great breath is the very Vedas. Thus, O Maitreyee, this has been breathed forth from this great Being what we have as Rigveda. Yajurveda -Brihadaaranyaka Upanishad (4.4.10). In the Spiritual literature of India we often read Vedas described as His breath; He breathed out the Vedas (Nih-svasitam).\n\n(42) Anaadi-nidhanah One who has neither (\"an\") birth (Aadi) nor death (Nidhanum). Thus One who is changeless is Anaadi-Nidhanam; for, any change should include the death of an old condition and the birth of newer condition. To the Immortal and the Immutable, change is impossible.\n\n(43) Dhaataa- One who is the Substratum for the world of names and forms. And who supports all fields of experiences in all. He who is the screen for the cinema of empirical experiences (Visvam).\n\n(44) Vidhaataa -The One who is the Dispenser of all fruits-of-actions. In the Karma-kaanda portion of the Vedas, Eesvara is described as the Dispenser of fruit (Karma- phala-daataa Eesvarah). He is the Lord who is behind this universe of scientific truths and rhythm. He is the One who has not only ordered the laws of the nature, but he is the one afraid of whom, the phenomena dare not disobey his laws anywhere at any time. The light of the sun, the heart is the fire, the sweetness in the sugar, the pains in the sin and the joy s in goodness, are all their nature and none dare ever disobey these laws. The one who is thus the unquestionable law behind the entire universe of laws is Vidhaata.\n\n(45) Dhaatur-uttamah the fundamentals (\"dhaatu\") that form the reinforcement on any existent thing are called Dhaatu. In science of life, as explored by the Rishis, all corporal forms have risen form and exist as composed of some definite elemental factor called the Dhaatus. Of the end less varieties of Dhaatus available in existence, the subtlest Dhaatu, without which no existence, is ever possible, is the chit Dhaatu, and this is the Dhaatu-ruttamah.\n\nThough very rarely, we do find some commentators splitting this word into two as Dhaatu and uttama. But in the majority of the cases we find it taken to form one term and explained as the subtlest of the Dhaatus.\n\nStanza 6\n\naprameyo hrisheekesah padmanaabho-a- maraprabhuh\n\nvisvakarmaa manustvashtaa sthavishthah sthaviro dhruvah.\n\n(46) Aprameyah  He, who cannot be defined and explained in terms of any logical term of reference with other things should necessarily be inexpressible. A thing that can be directly perceived (Pratyaksha) can be desired, certain other things, which we may not directly perceive, but can be infer (anumaama) them from data available. And there are yet things which can be brought home to the listener by describing them in terms of similar other objects (Upamaa). Since the infinite has no Properties. It cannot be perceived, nor can It be understood through inference. Nor even explained in terms of similar or dissimilar things. Hence the supreme Reality, Vishnu, is called as Aprameyah. We can experience him only by ending all sense of separativeness and becoming one with Him.\n\n(47) Hrisheekesah In the Puranic literature the meaning of the term is close-cropped or One who has coiled up his locks of hair (Hrissheeka+Eesa).\n\nThe term Hrisheeka is an absolute one now, and it means the sense organs. The Aatman, the self as Consciousness is the one who gives light to all sense organs and, therefore, it is the lord of all sense organs. This lord is Vishnu.\n\nThe obsolete word Hrisheeka also means the rays or that which gives the joy. Thus the term Hrisheekas can mean the Lord of the rays: the sun and moon. This way interpreted, commentators point out that the term Hrisheekesah means He who has Himself becomes the Sun and the Moon.\n\nIn His manifestation as the Sun and the Moon, the Lord Himself whips the world to wakeful activities and sends the world to sleep and rest. Thus Hrisheekesa in its deeper significance, is, to all contemplative hearts, the Lord, who becomes Himself the world, exhausts Himself in His activities, and ultimately packs His toys and goes to rest at the time of dissolution.\n\n(48) Padmanaabhah  One from whose navel (\"nabhi\") springs the Lotus (\"padma\"), which is the seat of the four-faced Creator, Brahmaaji.\n\nLotus in Hinduism represents Truth or any of Its manifested powers. The creative faculties in man flow from the navel area (center: naabhi), and manifests as the four-faced inner equipment (Antahkarana) constituted of the mind, intellect, Chit and ego.\n\nIn the Yoga-sastras, we find a lot of details regarding this concept. According to them every idea springs from Him (Paraa), and then at the navel area, each of them comes to be perceived (Pasyantee).\n\nThereafter they play in the bosom as thoughts (Madhayamaa), and at last they are expressed (Vaikharee) in the outer fields-of activity.\n\nIn this discussion-upon the evolutionary stages through which every idea becomes an action  we gather a clearer insight into the meaning of the symbolism of the Creator seated on the lotus, which springs forth from the navel of the Lord, the Supreme Vishnu.\n\n(49) Amaraprabhuh -The Lord (\"prabhu\") of the Immortals (\"a-mara\"), the Devas. The Denizens of the Heavens, including all the office bearers therein (Dikpaalakas etc.) along with Indra, are called Devas, and they enjoy in their heavenly state a relative immortality.\n\nThe devas live and continue functioning till the great dissolution-the Sleep of the Creator. Compared with the short span of the existence of man on this globe, the aeons through which the Devas live can be considered as end- less or immortal.\n\nOne who serves them with His might, giving protection and security to all creatures, is called, therefore, Amaraprabhuh.\n\n(50) Visvakarmaa -The very creator-of the world-of-objects, of all equipments-of-experiences, and of all experiences in all bosom-is called the Visva-Karmaa. Herein the Infinite Lord is but a Witness of all that is happening and though the experienced world is sustained in Him, He is not involved in the imperfections or mortality, that are happening all around at all times in the Visvam. They are in Me, I am not in them-Geeta.\n\n(51) Manuh -The term means One who has the ability to reflect upon the Higher (Mananaseelah Manuh). Manu also means mantra and so, as applied to the Lord, it can mean as the One who has manifested Himself in the form of the Vedic mantras.\n\n(52) Tvashtaa -One who makes gross things of huge dimensions into minutest particles. At the time of the worlds dissolution, the entire gross-world folds back into its subtler elements until at last pure objectless space alone comes to remain.\n\n(53) Sthavishthah -lt is the superlative degree of gross (sthoola) and thus the Supremely gross is the subtlest Reality. The contradiction that it contains is itself its vigour and beauty. The Infinite as the subtlest is All-Pervading in Its own nature. It is this Maha- Vishnu who has Himself become the entire universe of gross things and beings. Just as all waves are the ocean, the total world of gross things is itself the form of Vishnu.\n\nIn His cosmic form, Narayana had manifested to Arjuna in he Geeta. There the words of Arjunas chant will clearly bring home to us that the entire gross world is ever His own Divine form.\n\n(54) Sthaviro Dhruvah -The Ancient (Sthavirah) and the Motionless or firm (Dhruvah). He is called the Ancient because the very first unit of time itself had risen from Him. He was the progenitor of the very concept of Time in us. Therefore, Time cannot condition Him. Thus He becomes the most Ancient. He is the Firm Truth; nothing that happens in the phenomenal world can affect Him at any time.\n\nStanza 7\n\nagraahyah saasvatah krishno lohitaakshah pratardanah\n\nprabhootah trikakub-dhaama pavitram mangalam param.\n\n(55) Agraahyah -That which cannot (\"a\") be perceived (\"graahyah\") through the play of the sense organs; in short, that which is not an object of perception, but which is the very subject-who is the Perceiver in all that is perceived.\n\nThe subject can never become the object, and hence Truth is something that the sense organs cannot apprehend, as they do any other sense-objects. He is the one subject ever-perceiving all objects, through all sense-organs of all living creatures, everywhere, at all times.\n\nThe Lord is the subject, not only in the sense organs, but He is the feeler in the mind and the thinker in the intellect.\n\nAnd thus the sense organs cannot perceive It, nor the mind feel It, nor the intellect apprehend It; says the Upanishad, That from which words retire unapproached along with the mind is the Supreme. Hence He is Agraahya-Imperceptible and Incomprehensible.\n\nKenopanishad is very clear and emphatic: That which the eyes cannot perceive, but because of which eyes are perceiving, understand That to be Brahman (Maha Vishnu) and not that which you here worship.\n\n(56) Saasvatah -That which remains at all times the same is the Permanent, That which is permanent, should remain Changeless in all the three periods of time. In short, He is unconditioned by time. The Supreme Consciousness Itself is the very Illumminator of Time, and the Illuminator can never be affected by what It illumines. This changeless reality is Vishnu.\n\n(57) Krishnah -The word Krishna means in Sanskrit the dark. The Truth that is intellectually appreciated, but spiritually not apprehended, is considered as veiled behind some darkness.\n\nThe root Krish means Existence (Sattaa) and na means Bliss (Aananda). So says Vyasa in Mahabharata, Udyoga Parva 70, 5. Therefore Krishna (Krish+na) means Existence- Bliss (Sattaa-Aananda). Thus, the very name divine, Krishna, represents the Supreme Paramaatman.\n\nOr, because of His dark-blue complexion He is called as Krishna. Mahabharata Santi Parva 343 says, As My colour is dark-blue, I am called Krishna, O Arjuna.\n\nIn Mahabharata, we find Krishna explaining Himself to Arjuna when the earth becomes shelled in by its hard crux I shall turn myself into an iron plough-share and shall plough the earth.\n\nApart from the above meaning Krishna also means the Enchanter of all His devotees (Aakarshana). Truth is One which irresistibly attracts everybody towards Itself. Commentators have interpreted this significance in a more attractive context. They conclude that Krishna means One who sweeps away the sins in the heart of those who meditate upon Him.\n\nTruth has got a magnetism to attract to Itself all the ego and ego-centric passions of the individual. In this sense viewed, we need not consider Krishna as a deity of the farmyard in the agricultural estates. The Lord ploughs the hard stupidities in us and prepares the heart-field, weeding out all the poisonous growths of sin, and cultivates therein-pure Bliss which is of the nature of Reality.\n\n(58) Lohitaakshah -Red-eyed. Very often we find descriptions in the Puranas, where the Lord is explained as having eyes like the red-lotus (Hibiscus). Generally the ruddy eyes represent anger and the incarnations are taken for the purpose of destroying the evil and so His anger is towards the evil-minded materialists who live ignoring the higher values of life.\n\n(59) Pra-tarda-nah - The root Tarda means destruction and with the prefix Pro the root (Pra-tarda) means supreme destruction. One who does this total destruction (Pratardanah) is the Lord in the form of Rudra at the time of the great dissolution (Pralaya).\n\n(60) Prabhootah -The term means born full or ever-full. He is ever-full and perfect in His Essential Nature, as the Transcendental Reality, or even when He manifests in the form of His various incarnations. Especially in His chief and glorious incarnation as Lord Krishna, He proved Himself to be ever full with His Omnipotency and Omnisciency.\n\n(61) Tri-kakub-dhaama -One who is the very foundation or support (Dhaama) of the three (\"tri\") quarters (Kakubh). We find this is generally commented upon and described as all quarters, in the three realms above, below and middle. Viewing this from the platform of Vedanta, He must be considered by us as the three Planes-of -Consciousness-the waking (Jaagrat), the dream (Svapna) and the deep-sleep (Sushupti) conditions. The fourth Plane-of-Consciousness (Tureeya) is the Substratum for all the other three planes.\n\n(62) Pavitram One who gives purity to the heart. To the seekers who are meditating upon Him, He gives inner purity, and hence He is known as Pavitram.\n\nOr, the term Pavi means; the weapon vajra (thunderbolt). One who saves (\"tram\") his devotees from the thunderbolt of lndra is Pavitram. This can also be interpreted as the \"giridhara\" episode where the lord saves his devotees from Indra's wrath.\n\nThe thunderbolt is described as an instrument made out of the bone of sage Dadheechi. Indra is the Lord of the lndriyas. In Vedanta Indra signifies the mind. Minds cross purposes, confusions, intellectual compromises and the consequent self- cancellation of our mental powers (Sankalpa-Vikalpa) can be the great thunderbolt of the mind with which Indra (mind) can destroy in no time all the acquired tapas of the saadhaka. Deep devotion, ardent meditation and firm faith in the Lord Vishnu save the saadhaka from all such mental storms and, therefore, the Lord acquires the significant name Pavitram\n\n(63) Param Mangalam -Mangalam is that which not only removes the dark pains of evil, but brings the bright joys of merit. Param Mangalam is Supreme Mangalam, and It can be none other than He, by whose mere remembrance all inauspiciousness gets lifted up and all Auspiciousness comes to flood our hearts The Upanishad declares. May That Brahman-who removes all inauspiciousness in man and gives man all auspiciousness, by a mere remembrance of Him -give us all auspiciousness.\n\nStanza 8\n\neesaanah praanadah praano jyeshthah sreshthah prajaapatih\n\nhiranya-garbho bhoo-garbho maodharo madhu-soodanah.\n\n(64) Eesaanah The Controller of all the five Great Elements. When this term is used, Eesvara becomes the Administrator of His own Law in the phenomenal world of plurality. The executive function of His Infinite Will, when manifested through Him, the Lord. Eesvara, is said to function as Eesaanah. Or, the term can also mean One who is the Supreme Eesvara-the Paramesvara.\n\n(65) Praanadah -One who gives (Dadaati) the Praanas to all. The term Praanas used in philosophy indicated all manifestations of Life in a living body. The Source of Life from which all dynamic activities in the living organisms of the world flow out, meaning, That from which all activities emerge out is Praanadah.\n\nTaittireeya Upanishad (2- 7) exclaims: Who could then live. who could breath if He be not every- where.\n\n(66) Praanah -That which sustains is Praana and that which has got Praana functioning in it is called a Praanee. Since the Lord is termed as this very same Praana, it means by its suggestion that He is One who ever lives. The Immortal and the Eternal is Praanah.\n\nThe term can also mean that which gives Life-impulse even to the air; the capacity to sustain life in the atmosphere flows from Him alone.\n\nIn the Kenopanishad we read the Supreme Defined as the Praana of Praanas (Praanasya Praanah).\n\n(67) Jyeshthah -Older than all. The Infinite is That which was even before the very concept of space (Aakaasa) came into existence. The term is the superlative degree of the Aged. In short, the import of this term is the same as the more familiar term used in our sastras, the Ancient (Sanaatanah).\n\n(68) Sreshthah -The most Glorious One: Here again it is the superlative degree of glorious, Sreyah.\n\n(69) Prajaapatih -The Lord (Pati) of all living creatures (Prajaah) .The term Prajas means Children. Therefore Prajaapati means the Great Father, to whom all beings in the living kingdom are His own children, In this sense, the term connotes One, who, as the Creator, creates all creatures.\n\n(70) Hiranyagarbhah -One who dwells in the womb (garbha) of the world (Hiranya). The Upanishad declares: All these are in-dwelt by the Lord. The Golden Universe is an idiom in Sanskrit where gold means objects of fulfilment and joy. One who dwells in them all is Hiranyagarbhah. The term can also mean as He who, having become first the Creator, has come to he considered as the womb of all objects.\n\n(71) Bhoogarbhah -One who is the very womb of the world (Bhooh) The One from whom the world has emerged out. In the Cosmic Form of the Lord, this world occupies an insignificant though sacred portion, just as the foetus in the womb, constantly and lovingly nurtured and nourished by the very Essence in the mother. Or, Bhooh = the earth: the divine consort of Hari: Garbha = Protector.\n\n(72) Maadhavah -The Lord of Maayaa, Spouse of Mahaalakshmee. Or, the term can signify the One who is ultimately experienced through a diligent practice of Madhu technique: the very famous Madhu Vidyaa of the Chandogya Upanishad. The term Maadhavah can also mean One who is the Silent (Mauni); who is ever the Non-interfering Observer, the Silent Witness of the physical, mental and intellectual activities in the realm of change. To put it in one word, He is the One whom the seeker experiences when he has stilled his mind which has been purified by Yoga practices.\n\n(73) Madhusoodanah -One who destroyed the great demon Madhu. The story of Vishnu destroying these two demons, Madhu and Kaitabha, is a story of secret suggestions in Mahabharata. Madhu also means in Veda (Madhu=honey) as the fruits of actions (Karma-phala). Actions leave impressions and these sensuous Vaasanaas are destroyed by meditations on the Reality and so the Supreme gathers to Itself the name Madhusoodanah: the Destroyer of Vaasanaas.\n\nStanza 9\n\neesvaro vikramee dhanvee medhaavee vikramah kramah\n\nanuttamo duraadharshah kritajnah kritir-aatmavaan.\n\n(74) Eesvarah -One who is Omnipotent, and so has all powers in Him to the full. The manifested powers of Life express themselves in every intelligent man as the power of action in the body (Kriyaa Sakti), the power of desire in the mind (Icchaa Sakti) and the power of knowledge in the intellect (Jnaana Sakti). All these three powers are manifestations of Him, and since He is the One everywhere, He is the total mighty power-the Great Vishnu.\n\n(75) Vikramee -One full of prowess (Vikrama), courage, daring. Or, it can be One who has Special foot steps. This term commemorates how the Lord, as Vamana, measured with His tiny three steps all the three worlds.\n\n(76) Dhanvee -Lord Vishnus Divine Bow is called Saarnga and it is described as the mightiest among the weapons. One who is having this Mighty Bow at all times is Dhanvee. It can also remind us of His incarnation as Sree Ramachandraji, when, in order to protect the world from the mighty Raakshasas of Lanka, He had to dedicate a substantial part of His life almost constantly wielding his bow: hence Sri Rama came to be known as Dhanushpaani; in His attitude of protection He is known as Kodandaraama. Thus, the term Dhanvee, the Wielder of the bow, is quite appropriate for Vishnu. I am Sri Rama among the Wielders of the bow Geeta Ch.l0, St. 31.\n\n(77) Medhaavee -Supremely intelligent; One who is capable of understanding everything. One who has the capacity to comprehend intellectually all that is happening around is called Medhaavee. Since Consciousness is the One Light in all living creatures, which illumines all intellects, and since Vishnu is this Infinite Consciousness, He is the One Knower, knowing all things, at all times, at once. Hence Sarasvati, the Goddess of Learning and Knowledge is described as the very tongue of Vishnu.\n\n(78) Vikramah -While describing the term Vikramee (75) we had already explained the meaning contents of Vikrama, and thus Vikrama is an appellation that had come to Vishnu as a result of His Supernatural Act of measuring the universe with three steps.\n\nAlso, Vi means the king-of-birds, the white-necked eagle; Krama means steps and, therefore, movement or travel. In this sense Vikrama can mean: One who rides on the white- eagle (mind) is Vishnu-who is described as having Garuda for His vehicle (Vaahanam).\n\n(79) Kramah -He who is All-Pervading is Kramah. Because of His All-Pervasiveness, the Infinite is called as Vishnu. That which goes beyond the frontiers of the known is the Supreme, and, therefore, in the description of Him, who has manifested as the Cosmos, we have in Purushasookta an indication that He not only pervades all that is known but extends even beyond by ten digits (Atyatishthat Dasaangulam).\n\n(80) Anuttamah -One who is incomparably Great in glory-Anuttamah. In the Sanskrit construction of the word, it means something more than what we have said; it means: He is one, beyond whom there exists none who is greater than He (unexcelled). The Upanishad itself describes Him: In Geeta (XI-43) we read: For Thy equal exists not, whence another superior to Thee? In Sri Narayana Upanishad (12) we again read, There is nothing above or below, equal to Him.\n\n(81) Duraadharshah -One who cannot be attacked, stormed or beleaguered successfully. In short, He is All-Powerful. In the Puranas, we find Daityas and Asuras and others, mighty and powerful ones, become themselves helpless victims of His Power and come under His sway. To one who has realized the Infinite, the lower nature of the mind (Daityas) and the enchantments of the senses (Raakshasas) , are all helpless to overwhelm Him. Rasopyasya Param Drishtvaa Nivartate -Geeta Ch. 2, St. 59.\n\n(82) Kritajnah -He who knows all that is done by all: the One Knower who knows all physical activities, all emotional feelings, and all intellectual thoughts and motives. He illumines them all, in all, at all times. Hence He is called Kritajna. Vishnu is the One who knows clearly the exact depth of sincerity, the true ardency of devotion, the real amount of purity in the bosom of all his devotees, and, accordingly, brings joy and bliss to their hearts.\n\n(83) Kritih -The One, who is the very dynamism behind all activities. He is the Inevitability behind the result of actions. He is called Kritih because it is He who visits to bless the good and to punish the evil; in short; He is the One who rewards all our actions.\n\n(84) Aatmavaan -One who is the Self in all beings. In the Chandogya Upanishad (7.24.1) when the disciple asks, Where does the Lord, the Infinite, stand established? the Sruti answers, In Its own glory established ever is the Self-(Sve Mahimni Pratishthitah).\n\nStanza 10\n\nsuresah saranam sarma visva-retaah prajaa-bhavah\n\nahah samvatsaro vyaalah pratyayah sarvadarsanah.\n\n(85) Suresah -The denizens of the Heavens are called in the Puranas as Suras. Eesa means the Lord; Suresa, therefore, indicates the God of gods, the Lord of the Suras. The gods are called as Suras because they are capable of blessing their devotees with a fulfilment of their desires. Therefore, Suresah means One who is the best among those who fulfil all the demands of their devotees (Suras). In short, He is the One who gives the Supreme State of Beatitude and the consequent total liberation from all desires of the ego.\n\n(86) Saranam -The Refuge for all who are suffering from the thraldom of imperfection in life. According to the Sanskrit Lexicon (Amarakosa), the term Saranam means Protector and also home. Since the Lord is the Ultimate Goal, Saranam, He is also the Destination, the Harbour. The One Who realizes Him comes to live in Him.\n\nHe is the home to which the prodigal son (jeeva) ultimately returns. Not only for the men of Realization is He the Home, but for all creatures, movables and immovables, He is the Home, to which they all disappear to rest and to revive during Pralaya (Sleep).\n\n(87) Sarma -One who is Himself the Infinite Bliss. Transcending the mind lie the shores of Bliss, beyond the waters of agitations. The Infinite is described in our Upanishads as the Sacchidaananda, ever of the same nature-Saantam Sivam Sundaram.\n\n(88) Visvaretaah -Retas means seed; the term connotes that He is the seed from which the tree of life has sprung forth. He who is the very cause for the entire play of experience in the world of pluralistic objects (Sarva- Prapancha-Kaaranabhootah) is called Visvaretaah.\n\n(89) Prajaabhavah -He from whom all living creatures (Prajaa) spring forth (Bhava) is known as Prajaabhavah.\n\n(90) Ahah -Ahan has got two meanings: the 24-hour-day or the 12-hour day-time. He is of the nature of day-time means He is the One, ever effulgent and bright; as bright as the daylight that illumines all objects around. In case we accept the other meaning, the 24-hour-day, then, a day being a unit of time, the term Ahan can also mean, One who is of the nature of Time itself. Also He is one who does not (a) ever destroy (han) the devotees who have surrendered themselves to Him.\n\n(91) Samvatsarah -One who is of the nature of year-meaning One who is the Lord of Time; He, from whom the very concept of Time rises.\n\n(92) Vyaalah -One who is unapproachable. Vyaala also means Serpent; to those who have no devotion or understanding, God or Truth is as horrible and terrible as a serpent. Moreover, it is so difficult to grasp in our understanding that It is like a serpent: ever eluding, always slippery.\n\n(93) Pratyayah -One whose very nature is Knowledge. That the Supreme is Knowledge Absolute is very well known. It is in the light of Consciousness that all know- ledges are possible. Knowledge of a thing is the Awareness of its nature. Awareness is Knowledge. Since the Supreme is the One Awareness everywhere, all Knowledges spring from the Self. Hence, He is called the Pure Knowledge. Consciousness is Brahman is one of the Mahaavaakyas.\n\n(94) Sarvadarsanah -This term, All-seeing is very appropriate in as much as the Supreme Consciousness has been defined and indicated in the Kenopanishad as, That which the eyes cannot see, but because of which the eyes see. It is the Seer in the eyes, the Hearer in the ears, the Speaker, the Feeler and the Thinker. And since this Principle of Consciousness is One everywhere, as expressed through the equipments, It is indeed the One Seer in all seeing, by everyone, everywhere. The Upanishad says: and the Geeta indicates Him as One who has eyes and heads everywhere.\n\nStanza 11\n\najah sarvesvarah siddhah siddhih sarvaadir achyutah\n\nvrishaakapir ameyaatmaa sarva-yoga- vinissritah.\n\n(95) Ajah -Unborn. Birth implies a modification; birth cannot be without the death of its previous condition. Since the Eternal and the Infinite, is ever Changeless there can be in It neither birth nor death. That which is born must necessarily die: -(Geeta Ch. 2, St. 27) and so, that which is unborn should be deathless (Amritah).\n\nRig Veda (1-81-5): He was neither born nor is He going to be born.\n\n(96) Sarvesvarah -God of all gods or the Supreme Controller of all. In a sense it means the Almighty, the All-powerful. He is the Lord of all, says Brihad Upanishad (6-4-2).\n\n(97) Siddhah -One who has achieved all that has to be achieved, as He Himself is the Final Goal for all. Or the term can also mean the most famous.\n\n(98) Siddhih -He who is available for recognition (Siddha) everywhere at all points in His nature as Pure Consciousness. Again, Siddhi also means the fruit of action, and in the context here this would-mean, He who gives the Infinite fruit of Kaivalya, Moksha. All other karmas can acquire for us only relative joys of the heavens, but in realizing the Self the seeker gains an Infinite State from which there is no return, so describes Geeta.\n\n(99) Sarvaadih -One who is the very beginning (Aadi) of all; one who was in existence earlier than everything else. Even before effects arise, the Cause. The Infinite which was before creation and from which the created beings had emerged out, as an effect, is naturally the Primary Cause (Moola-Kaarana).\n\n(100) Achyutah -Chyutah= Fallen; Achy utah: One who has never fallen: the Ever-Pure Reality which is never fallen into the misconceptions of Samsar: the Pure Knowledge in which ignorance has never come to pollute Its purity. Lord Himself says in Bhagavata, I have never ever before fallen from my Real Nature; therefore, I am Achyutah.\n\n(101) Vrishaakapih -There is a lot of controversy among pundits upon the exact meaning of this term. But all controversies become meaningless when we read Bhagavans own words, Since Kapi has a meaning the boar, and since vrisha has the meaning of Dharma the great Kasyapa Prajapati says I am Vrishaakapih.\n\nIn Sanskrit the term Kapi has a meaning: that which saves one from drowning. Lord in the form of the Great Boar, (Varaaha) in that incarnation, had lifted the world from the waters at the end of the deluge; the term vrisha means Dharma. One who thus lifts the world drowned in Adharma to the sunny fields of Dharma is vrishaakapih\n\n(102) Ameyaatmaa -One who has His manifestations (Aatmaa) in Infinite varieties, almost unaccountable (Ameya), The Viraat Purusha of the Form of All-Lord of the Cosmic Form is suggested here. As all forms have risen from Him, exist in Him, and dissolve into Him alone, all forms are His own different forms.\n\n(103) Sarva-yoga-vinissritah -Yoga is from Yuj to join; to attach, One who is totally free (vinissritah) from all contacts or attachments. Attachment to a thing is possible only when the object-of-attachment is other than the subject, In the One Infinite Reality there cannot be any attachment with anything, mainly because there is nothing here that is not the Infinite Itself. The Infinite is a Mass of Love; there is no attachment in It; for, attachment is Love with possessiveness and desire for gratification, This Purusha is, indeed, unattached, roars Brihad Upanishad (6-3-15), Lastly, the term, Sarva- Yoga- Vinissritah can also mean that He is beyond the reach of the various systems of Yogas taught in the Sastras. These systems are to quieten the mind, to end the misapprehensions-of- Truth, to annihilate the Maayaa, What is there left over in the seekers bosom is the Self-the Great Vishnu,\n\nStanza 12\n\nvasur-vasumanaah satyah samaatmaa sammitah samah\n\namoghah pundareekaaksho vrishakarmaa vrishaakritih.\n\n(104) Vasuh -The One who is the very support of all elements, and the One who Himself is the very Essence of the elements, This is something like the dream made up of our own mind; and the very same dream-world plays itself out, all the time sustained in the very same mind. Similarly, the Self indwells all and all dwell in the Self. In the Geeta we are told by the Lord, I am among the Vasus the Paavakah-(Geeta. Ch. 10, St. 23). Therefore, the Self exists like air-allowing everything to remain in it and sustaining everything by it.\n\n(105) Vasumanaah -One who has a mind which is Supremely Pure; meaning a mind that has none of the sins of passions and pains; none of the storms of desires and jealousies; none of the quakes of likes and dislikes.\n\n(106) Satyah -He is the Real. The term Satyam used in philosophy has a special connotation. That which remains the same in all the three periods of time is called Satyam. That which seemingly exists, but which never was nor shall ever be, is considered as a false delusion, A-satya. He who remains the same, before the creation, during the existence and even after the dissolution, is the Infinite Truth, Satyah. The Taittireeya Upanishad thunders that the Eternal Truth is Truth, Knowledge, Bliss: Satyam, Jnaanam, Anantam Brahma - Taittireeya Upanishad: 2-1.\n\nWe may here mention a couple of other meanings that are generally given to this term The best among good people is Satyam. Again, the word Satyam is made up of three sounds -Sat-ti-yam -and, herein, according to the Upanishad itself, Sat means praana, ti means food, Yam means sun; therefore, Sat yam is the Law which orders the food to sustain the praana when both are blessed by the sources of all gross energies in the cosmos, the Sun.\n\n(107) Samaatmaa -He wbo is equally in all. In Kathopanishad we read the declaration of Lord Death to Nachiketas how the same Truth has come to express itself differently from form to form. To visualize the Paramesvara who revels equally ill all, among the perishables and imperishables, is the Vision Divine. Kauseshika Upanishad (3-9) says, One should understand that the Self is the same-in-all. In the Geeta also is the declaration I am the Seer in all the fields-of-experiences everywhere -Geeta Ch. 13, St. 3).\n\n(108) Sammitah -The term Sammatam means acceptable. The One. Truth, which has been proved and accepted by the Rishis In the Upanishads through subtle logic and philosophical reasoning, is called Sammatah. This is the most direct and very appealing meaning. But there are some who would interpret this portion of the Thousand Names of Lord Vishnu by combining Samaatmaa (107) and Sammitah (108) to form together a single Name, wherein the compound word would read Samaatma-asammitah. Here the term Asammitah then would come to mean One who is incomparable, Inimitable (Atulya) who has none to equal Him.\n\n(109) Samah -Equal; the same. Truth remains the same. One Infinite Reality plays the game of plurality. As has been said in the Kathopanishad, The One Principle of Fire having entered this world burns itself out differently according to the equipments upon which it is manifested, so the One Truth manifests as the many Jeevas. Hence He is called the Samah. Also it can mean as One who is ever united, with (Sa) Lakshmi (Maa).\n\n(110) Amoghah -Moghah means useless fellow (Nishphalah), a disappointing power. Amogha is the opposite of it: Ever Useful, Ever the Fulfiller of all the wishes and demands of His devotees. Chandogya Upanishad (8-1-5) declares: Truthful is His wish, and Truth is His resolve.\n\n(111) Pundareekaakshah -One who can be contacted and fully experienced in the Heart Space (Pundareekam). In the Narayana Upanishad (10) we find the same term employed: In the core of the body, in the Heart Space, dwells the Supreme. In the Heart, the meditator can experience the Reality more readily and very clearly, and so the All- Pervading Reality is described as dwelling in the Heart-cave.\n\n(112) Vrishakarmaa -Vrisha means Dharma. One whose every activity is righteous and who acts only to establish righteousness. For the sake of establishing Dharma, I am born in every age, says Lord -(Geeta Ch. 4, St. 8).\n\n(113) Vrishaakritih -One who is of the form (Aakriti) of Dharma (Vrisha). It is not only that His actions are righteous but He is Himself Righteousness. It can also mean as One who takes different forms during His Divine Incarnations-all for maintaining the Rule of Dharma in the world.\n\nStanza 13\n\nRudro bahu-siraa babhrur visvayonis-suchi-sravaah-\n\namritah saasvatah-sthaanur- varaaroho mahaatapaah.\n\n(114) Rudrah -One who makes all people weep, At the time of death or during the total dissolution, the One who makes all weep is Rudrah. From a devotees standpoint the same term is interpreted as the One who liquidated all sorrows is Rudrah. Bhagavan declares Himself to be Among the Rudras, I am Sankara (Geeta Ch. 10, St. 23). According to the Vedic terminology there are 11 Rudras; this eleventh Rudra is called as Sankara: Sam-karoti-iti = Sankarah - One who blesses all with Auspiciousness (Sam).\n\n(115) Bahusiraah -One who has many heads. The Purushasooktam of the Rig Veda describes the Cosmic Form of the Lord with a narration, The Purusha of thousand heads, thousand eyes and thousand feet . In Geeta a similar description of the Universal Form of the Lord is found in Chapter XI. Again in the Geeta Chapter XIII when the Lord was describing the Infinite Goal to be known (Jneyam), He describes It as Everywhere legs, everywhere hands, every- where eyes, everywhere His face.\n\nThus, He whose personal manifestations constitute the universe is known as One who has many heads.\n\n(116) Babhruh -One who rules over the worlds. Like a King -Atmabodham gives this analogy .He in whose presence all the instruments of perception, feeling and knowing continue their coordinated activity is the Self, the Atman, who is Great Lord Vishnu.\n\n(117) Visvayonih -One who is the Total Cause from which alone the entire world of experiences (visvam) has emerged out. The womb (yoni) from which thoughts and actions had risen is called Visvayonih.\n\n(118) Suchisravaah-One who has beautiful and efficient ears (Sravas): Everywhere are His ears-(Geeta Ch. 13, St. 13) meaning thereby He is the Hearer in all ears. The term Sravas not only means ears, but it also means names -so Suchisravas can mean One who has Divine and Sacred names. Thus, the devotee can invoke Him with thousands of His names when He can readily listen in and rightly understand the exact purity and the real depth of devotion in the devotee. Also the term can be used to indicate the One whose names are worthy of being heard by seekers.\n\n(119) Amritah -One who is Immortal and Immutable. Mritam = dead. The Infinite is Ajarah, Amarah and Avyayah. It can also mean as One who is of the nature of Nectar (Amritam) -a sure cure for those who are suffering from malady of ignorance. Amritah also means Moksha; and thus it is indicated, He is the ever-liberated-the Pure State of Being.\n\n(120) Saasvata-sthaanuh -One who is both permanent (Saasvatah) and irremovable (Sthaanuh). He is the One who remains Changeless, because Immortal; who remains the same in all periods of time, because permanent (Saasvatah); and who remains changeless in His nature or Consciousness (Sthaanuh). This is a single term (Saasvata-sthaanuh) and, therefore, we must add the meanings together- Permanent and Changeless; Permanently Changeless Factor in lire is Vishnu.\n\n(121) Vararohah - He who is the most Glorious (Vara) Destination (Aaroha). The Seat of the Self is the most Glorious because the imperfections of the world-of-matter (Prakriti) are not there in the Spirit (Purusha). Liberation from the thraldom of matter is the arrival of the Infinitude of the Self. He never returns, thunders the Chandogya Upanishad (8-15-1) three times in one and the same breath, assuring us that one who has reached the Seat of Vishnu, beyond the frontiers of the intellect, there is for him no more any return ever into the ego-centric life of tensions of sorrows.\n\n(122) Mahaatapaah -One of great Tapas. The term tapas in Sanskrit has three meanings: Knowledge (Jnaana), Prosperity (Aisvarya) and also Might (Prataapa). It is in the presence of Consciousness that we come to know all our experiences. Conscious of a thing or an idea is the Knowledge of the thing or the idea. That about which I am not conscious of, I have really no knowledge of it. All knowledges, of all bosoms, in all living creatures, everywhere, at all times, cannot be without the play of Consciousness upon the respective objects of knowledge, and hence this Consciousness is indicated in the Upanishads as Pure Knowledge, in the light of which alone all knowledges are possible. All achievements and prosperity (Aisvarya), all might and power of the living creatures can express themselves through them only when they are alive. This great truth is Maha Vishnu. Whose Tapas is of the nature of Knowledge (Mundaka- Upanishad. 1-1-9).\n\nStanza 14\n\nsarvagah sarvavid-bhaanuh- vishvak-sena janaardanah\n\nveda vedavid-avyango vedaanga vedavit kavih.\n\n(123) Sarvagah He who has gone everywhere, meaning One who pervades everything. The cause pervades its effect: gold in all ornaments; ocean in all waves; cotton in all cloth. The Infinite Consciousness Itself expresses as both world-of-matter (Kshetra) and the Knower-of-the-field (Kshetrajna). Vishnu, the Infinite is beyond these two (Uttamah Purushah) in whom there is no expression of matter and, there- fore, no Knower-hood. He is the All-Pervading Self, Maha Vishnu.\n\n(124) Sarvavid-bhaanuh -One who is All- Knowing (Sarvavit) and Effulgent (Bhaanuh) .The Light of Consciousness is the Light that illumines all lights and it is again Consciousness that illumines even darkness -Geeta Ch.13, St.17. In the Mundaka Upanishad (4.10) also we read: By its Light alone it illumines all other experiences. Sarvavit-Bhaanuh is one term: meaning that all Knowing Effulgent Consciousness.\n\n(125) Vishvaksenah -He, while facing whom, even the mighty army of the gods retreat and scatter away, is called as Vishvaksenah. He is the Almighty and All-Powerful, and no army can stand against Him.\n\n(126) Janaardanah -The term Ardayati is a verb meaning both giving sorrow or giving joy. Thus, One who gives sorrow and disaster to the vicious, and who blesses with joy and peace to the good people is called Janaardanah.\n\n(127) Vedah The term Veda comes from the root vid: to know. Since Veda gives knowledge, the Lord is termed as Vedah, in the sense, that He is the One who gives the Knowledge of the Reality, because He is the very Reality. In Mahabharata, Vyasa says: Krishna alone is All-vedas, All-sciences, All-techniques and All-dedicated Actions. In the Bhagavad Geeta (Ch. 10, St.2) Lord says: Out of mere compassion for them, I, abiding in their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance, by the luminous lamp of wisdom.\n\n(128) Vedavit One who knows the veda. The Lord alone is the One Experience without which the Vedas cannot be fully realized. The surest and the most exhaustive commentary of the Vedas is to be found only in a stilled mind, which is in communion with Vishnu, the Supreme Reality. Geeta (Ch. 15, St. 15) says, I am the author of the Vedanta, as well as the Knower of the Vedas.\n\n(129) Avyangah -He who has no imperfections (Vyanga) anywhere in him- The All-Perfect. The term Vyanga also means person, and so A vyanga means One who cannot be known by anyone in any personal-form. Geeta plainly says This great Reality is Imperceptible, Unthinkable, without any modifications. -Geeta. Ch. 2, St. 25\n\n(130) Vedaangah One whose very limbs are the vedas. In Kenopanishad in the closing stanzas, the teacher insists that all knowledges are Its limbs.\n\n(131) Vedavit One who contemplates upon the Veda is Vedavit: (Vedam Vichaarayati=Vedavit). Mere word meaning cannot give us the true concept of the subtle theme discussed in the Vedas. Continuous reflection upon their declarations alone can reach us to the peaks of their imports. In the Geeta, Bhagavan Himself declares that He is not only the very Revealer of Vedas but He is at once the Knower of the Veda -Geeta Ch. 15, St. 15.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary that the student of the Vedas should try to understand the meaning of their declaration. To repeat the mantras parrot-like is not of any consequence: He who has studied the Vedas but has not understood the meaning, but carries a load, as the road-rest on the roadside. Thus He who constantly reflects upon the Veda, and naturally lives up to it, is the Great Lord.\n\n(132) Kavih -The term Kavi in the Vedas means the Seer. One who experiences something more than the ordinary is called a Kavi. In the Isavasyopanishad (8) we read: -The Seer, the Intelligent.... In the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (5-7-23) we read: There is no Seer except Him.\n\nIn the Glory of the Lord, He confesses, in the Geeta, among the Poets, I am Usanas, Sukra-Aachaarya.\n\nStanza 15\n\nlokaadhyakshah suraadhyaksho dharmaadhyakshah krita-akritah\n\nchaturaatmaa chaturvyoohas-chatur-damshtras-chatur-bhujah.\n\n(133) Lokaadhyakshah One who presides over all fields of experiences -all lokas. President is one who is responsible for the conduct of the assembly; he guides the discussion in a disciplined manner, and ultimately at the end of it all, he dissolves the meeting. All through the discussions he never interferes with the freedom of speech and action of the members, if they act within the agenda of the day. Similarly, the Lord presides over all the fields of activities, never interfering with the freedom of the individuals to act. The Supreme Purusha in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the great Lord, and the Supreme Self. From the Puranic standpoint the Lord in His Vaamana manifestation was installed as the king of the three worlds and, therefore, this name, say the Pauraanikas.\n\n(134) Suraadhyakshah -The President of the Heavens to whom the Devas run for protection when they are threatened by their constant enemies -the Daityas and the Asuras. When in the Heaven of our bosom, the thought-angels are threatened by the negative tendencies and criminal purposes, He to whom the good in us surrender totally for sure protection and safety is Vishnu, the President within the bosom.\n\n(135) Dharmaadhyakshah -Presiding over the activities of the living organisms, Consciousness revels, illumining both the good and the evil therein. The One Sacred factor that constantly thus illumines all the nature and functions (Dharma) of the body, mind and intellect is the Dharmaa- dhyakshah, Lord Vishnu.\n\n(136) Kritaakritah -Kritam = that which is done = that which is manifested or created Akritam, therefore, is that which has not manifested or become. The former (Kritam) indicates all the effects manifested out of the Creators activities, and the latter (Akritam) is the cause from which no manifestation has yet emerged -it is still unmanifest. The Self, the Atman, is the Post -in the ghost-in-the-post example -upon which the cause and the effect, the unmanifest and the manifest, like the ghost apparently come to play (Kritam = Vyaktam, A-Kritam = A-Vyaktam).\n\n(137) Chaturaatmaa -The Self is described as four-fold when we consider the Atman as the Glory (Vibhooti) of the Self. Thus, the Essential factors, with which alone the endless play of creation, sustenance and destruction can continue, are the glories of the Self (Aatma-Vibhooti). In Vishnu Purana, four distinct vibhooties of the Lord -when He functions as the creator, sustainer and destroyer -are found enumerated. From the standpoint of a Vedantic student, since in the Non-dual Reality there cannot be anything other than It- self, all the plays of the gross, the subtle and causal bodies, in the microcosm and in the macrocosm, are the glories (vibhooties) of the One Self. In the Absolute, in the Eternal, all these are transcended; these- the water, dreamer, deep-sleeper, the Tureeya -are all Its Glories. The Possessor of these Glories is the One that transcends even Tureeya; He is called as the Tureeyaateetah.\n\n(138) Chaturvyoohah -One who manifests into the four mighty powers (Vyooha). The Truth, that plays thus Himself in these four levels having apparently created the world of experiences, is Vishnu, the All-Pervading. According to the Vaishnava literature, for the purpose of creation, Maha Vishnu Himself became four mighty powers (Vyooha) and they were called Vaasudeva, Samkarshana, Pradyumna and Aniruddha. One who has Himself these four mighty powers, necessary for the conduct of plurality, is the Great Self, Maha Vishnu.\n\n(139) Chatur-Damshtrah -The canine teeth fully developed in the upper and the lower rows, as in the case of carnivorous animals, are called in Sanskrit as Damshtraa. This is reminiscent of the Powerful Damshtraa of the Lord when He took the form of Nara-Simha to protect Prahlaada.\n\nAlso in the Puranas we find that the Great white Elephant of Indra,  Airaavata, has four tusks -He whose glory is the four-tusked Airaavata is Maha- Vishnu. To the student of the Upanishad, it is indeed very clear that these four tusks or teeth are nothing other than the four paadas which Mandukya thunders -Chatushpaada. The manifestation of the Might and Glory of the Supreme are the play of the waking, dream and deep-sleep conditions. With reference to these three, transcending them all, is the fourth plane-of-consciousness the Springboard for all these three. He, whose Glory are all these four grinding, crushing, fearful experiences of duality, is the One Non-dual Self, the Great Maha Vishnu.\n\n(140) Chaturbhujah One who has four hands"
