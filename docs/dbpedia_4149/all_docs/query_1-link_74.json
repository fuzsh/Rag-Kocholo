        "text": "The chakra contains 24 equally spaced spokes. According to the Hindu religion, 24 Rishis wielded the whole power of the Gayatri mantra containing 24 letters. All the 24 spokes of the Dharma chakra are the representation of the 24 rishis of the Himalayas in which Vishvamitra is first and Yajnavalkya the last. The Ashoka chakra is also known as Samay chakra in which the 24 spokes represent 24 hours of the day and is the symbol of the movement of the time. The Ashoka Chakra is rendered in navy blue on a white background replacing the symbol of the charkha of the pre-independence version of the flag. The chakra signifies that there is life in movement and death in stagnation. It represents the dynamism of a peaceful change. India should not resist the change. It must move and go forward. Happy Independence day. Jai Hind!\n\nInner Voice comprises contributions from our readers. The views expressed are personal."
