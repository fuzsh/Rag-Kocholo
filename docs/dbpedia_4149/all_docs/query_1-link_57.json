        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe flag consists of saffron, white and green with the Ashoka Chakra - a 24-spoke wheel in navy blue, resting at its centre.\n\nIn just a few days from now, India will celebrate its 75th Independence Day on August 15. So it's only fair to revisit historical moments and understand the significant elements that represent India.\n\nFor instance, the national flag of India, colloquially called the Tricolour, signifies the country's status as an independent nation while celebrating its freedom. Did you know that use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence Day and the Republic Day is prohibited by law?\n\nHere's more on Tricolour, which was adopted in its present form during a meeting of the Constituent Assembly on July 22, 1947, just twenty days before India's Independence. On August 15, 1947, it became the official flag of the country. The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India.\n\nThe horizontal rectangular Tricolour flag consists of saffron, white and green with the Ashoka Chakra - a 24-spoke wheel in navy blue, resting at its centre.\n\nThe Ashoka Chakra is a depiction of the Dharmachakra - a wheel represented with 24 spokes. The Ashoka Chakra on the Indian flag is rendered in a navy blue colour on a white background, replacing the symbol of charkha (spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions.\n\nJust a few days before the country became independent, a modified version of the Swaraj flag was chosen; the tricolour remained the same saffron, white and green. However, the charkha was replaced by the Ashoka Chakra representing the eternal wheel of law.\n\nAnd here’s what the three colours in India’s national flag mean: Saffron signifies the strength and courage of the country, while the white colour represents peace and truth. Whereas the green colour indicates fertility, growth and auspiciousness of the land.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nStanding at a Janus moment, what’s shaping IndiGo’s future\n\nWhy investing in Nifty 500 Equal Weighted Index could be a good diversification strategy\n\nOnce derided, startups are now market darlings marching to Nifty 50\n\nSeven factors driving the warehouse boom in India\n\nTata Consumer Products needs a Starbucks ‘shot’ to increase its market value exponentially\n\nThe challenges dotting India’s push for 6G leadership\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
