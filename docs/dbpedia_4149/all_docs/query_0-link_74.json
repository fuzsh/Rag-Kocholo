        "text": "Lord Naarayana or Lord Vishnu is the only original and the first living being existing even before the existence of this cosmos or the first created being Lord Brahma! He is the original spirit soul and you know that the spirit soul is an eternal particle and anything other than it is material or perishable, even if it is Lord Brahma who has the supreme life span, he is also afraid of death and is subject to the laws of material universe even though he is in the highest abode of the 14 planetary systems or Satyaloka.\n\nMaterial universe is a pair of opposites or a dual substance as you can say and it is always in a relative realm. Only the spiritual universe or Vaikuntas, the abode of Lord Vishnu/Lord Naarayana is an absolute realm with no concepts of duality in time or space and is the place of fully realised surrendered souls under the constant and mutual service of Lord Naarayana.\n\nThe vivid descriptions of Vaikunta is described here and these are the topics of worthy discussion:Description of the Kingdom of God.\n\nJaya and Vijaya are the doorkeepers of Lord Vishnu and as such they are sinless souls, as you would expect them to be since they are in the Vaikuntha.\n\nThey are ordained to be cursed by the mother earth or Goddess Lakshmi Herself for the pastimes of Lord Naarayanaa for incarnating Himself as Varaaha (Lord Boar) and Lord Narasimha (Man-Lion) and further as Lord Ramachandra and Lord Shri Krishna, enacted through the mind-born sons of Lord Brahma Sanaka, Sanandha, Sanatana and Sanatkumara.\n\nThe details are all there in the 3rd Canto Chapters 12-19 of Srimad Bhagavatham.\n\nAs such, asuras are a class of living beings who are extremely passionate or in rajas mode, created during the evening twilight hours by Lord Brahma (the entire creation process is explained in Canto 2 and Canto 3 of Srimad Bhagavatham) which is considered inauspicious for doing anything other than auspicious religious activities because of the pre-dominance of Lord Rudra (Bhoothanaath) and his disciples, ghosts and hobgloblins during that time(that‚Äôs why, the concept of tri-kala sandhyavandhana worship of the sun and veda-maatha Gayatri during this period to counteract this influence and pacify Lord Rudra is prescribed) as even time is governed by the mode of material nature and appropriate acts are to be performed only at the appropriate time!\n\nAsuras were existing at all points in the yuga cycle along with other created beings. Matsya or fish incarnation was before Varaha and Lord Vishnu as Matsya killed the asura or demon Hayagriva to restore the Vedas that this demon stole from Lord Brahma while the process of pralaya was taking place and Lord Brahma was worried about the next creation process after he lost the Vedas to this asura!\n\nAsuras are as such a class of beings with predominance of the base modes of material nature ‚Äì rajas and tamas. They have no discrimination of right/wrong or knowledge of reality, practising atheism/pseudo religion principles, they have strong sense of the bodily concepts of life ‚Äì I/mine/material possessions there of ‚Äì predomination of the mode of false ego deludes their mind.\n\nThey actually need not have powerful bodily features and physical dominance as described about their characteristics in the Puranas/Ithihasas. The strong passion to lord it over material nature with a strong sense of duality, superiority, cunningness and crookedness in exploiting any living creature to one‚Äôs own advantage is enough to classify one as a asura or demon!\n\nYou may note the significance of the word Kripanah in these regard as i depicted these class of beings:\n\nConversation 005: Krpanah\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nConversation 025 ‚Äì Demoniac Nature\n\nHarsh Speech\n\nThis conversation is inspired from my post titled Magnificence of Srimad Bhagavatham with an amazing seeker that I have ever come across in my infinitesimal spiritual journey so far.\n\nThe topic of discussion is primarily on Canto 5: Chapter 23 ‚Äì The ≈öi≈õumƒÅra Planetary Systems of Srimad Bhagavatham.\n\nThis has opened both of us to reveal our latent understandings of this magnificent scripture.\n\nHere it is:\n\nSeeker 1: Bhagavatham is one of the grand keys to open the Pandora of Puranas. Have you really read/gone through the scripture? Just curious. Because, the chapters on. Sisumara chakra (tortoise back), Kapila and Devahuti discussions, Vidura and Maitreya discussions, etc are filled with many interesting points. In fact, the metamorphosis of Life from Mineral, Plant and human kingdoms is very secretively given in this Purana. The Darwin‚Äôs theory of material evolution forms a subset of our grand theory of evolution of soul. Also, can you give me the sources of your knowledge that will give me a hint as to what line of thought influenced your writings? It helps me to tailor my comments in best way possible, if I am aware of that source of course! Anyway, I will be reading other articles of yours.\n\nSeeker 2: Thank you very much for this valuable insight. Bhagavatham is the key to my life since 2011 üôÇ it continues to inspire for lifetimes of learning. Sisumara chakra is dolphin. The symmetrical arrangements of 27 stars on both sides, the arrangement of various other planets and luminaries‚Ä¶\n\nTortoise or kurma avatar comes in the 8th canto during churning of ocean by demigods and demons for nectar‚Ä¶\n\nThere are so many topics in Bhagavatham that are so subtle‚Ä¶\n\nfor example Hiranyakashipu‚Äôs sermon to his mother Diti and Hiranyaksha‚Äôs wife Kayadhu on the nature of the soul when they were lamenting for Hiranyaksha‚Äôs death at the hands of Lord Varaha,\n\nthe story of the king of Ushinara kingdom and Lord Yama in the form of small boy instructing on the illusions about death and material relationships,\n\nthe Hamsa Guhya prayers by Prajapathi Daksha for creating progeny through the womb of his wife PƒÅ√±cajanƒ´,\n\nthe story of King Chitraketu and his small son teaching the philosophy of the soul through the dhristi of sage narada and angira after re-entering the dead body,\n\nthe story of King Anga and King Vena,\n\nthe most important story told to prachinabaari on puranjana by sage narada on transmigration of soul,\n\nsong sung by lord shiva to the prachetas,\n\nthe narayana kavacha for killing vritrasura,\n\nthe story of jada bharath,\n\nthe enigmatic comparisons meted out to son of Daksha ‚Äì Harya≈õvas and SavalƒÅ≈õvas by narada for their renunciation from material life,\n\nthe bhumi gita, the uddhava gita, the aila gita (part of Uddhava Gita),\n\nthe gopi gita on the prayers of their separation with lord krishna,\n\nthe story of various incarnations,\n\nthe teachings of the sages at kurukshetra,\n\nthe chatur sloki bhagavatham on the absolute truth,\n\nthe concept of absolute time,\n\nthe dimensions of universe,\n\nthe concepts of creation, annihilation and dissolutions,\n\nthe three modes of material nature,\n\nthe various types of Mayas of the supreme lord,\n\nthe prayers by vidura, akrura, chitaketu and the demigods at several times and several situations,\n\ninstructions by nine yogendras to king nimi,\n\nthe lilas of krishna in 10th canto. etc.\n\nI just mention whatever that comes straight out of my mind. there is much much more direct as well as subtler aspects. I mean Bhagavatham is more than everything to me‚Ä¶and it is the driving force in my life üôÇ\n\nSeeker 1: Sisumara is Tortoise and kurma is turtle (both have a difference), just a humble correction. I can see your immersive joy in Bhagavatam. This is the intended purpose of outcome of Bhagavatam by Vyasa. You are blessed. A continuous effort on knowing and being with something is called Dharanaa and this reveals many secrets that cannot be understood by normal read. Since 2011 implies your deep constant connection with it and so the unfoldment of wisdom like a lotus flower.\n\nSeeker 2: Thank you so much‚Ä¶I would do more exhaustive study on Srimad Bhagavatham than anything else for the rest of my life if given a chance üôÇ\n\nhttps://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/5/23/4/ ‚Äì The Sisumara Planetary Systems ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis great machine, consisting of the stars and planets, resembles the form of a ≈õi≈õumƒÅra [dolphin] in the water. It is sometimes considered an incarnation of K·πõ·π£·πáa, VƒÅsudeva. Great yogƒ´s meditate upon VƒÅsudeva in this form because it is actually visible.‚Äù\n\nThe form could also be interpreted as a tortoise as you have been mentioning.as mentioned in this link:\n\nhttps://dictionary.babylon-software.com/sisumara/ ‚Äì ‚Äúa group of stars and constellations said to resemble a dolphin, porpoise, or tortoise; held to be a form of Vishnu, and often considered as a representation of the great circle of time. As an imaginary belt, a symbolic representation of the celestial sphere, or a theoretical revolving zone or belt within which move the celestial bodies ‚Äî which are the bodies of spiritual entities.‚Äù\n\nMore information here: http://www.decodinghinduism.com/search/label/sisumara%20planetary%20system\n\nThis is another link ‚Äì http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/details/bhagvatpurana24.html ‚Äì (not related to ISKCON üôÇ ) ‚Äì Sisumara Planetary System.\n\n‚Äì ‚ÄúSome 13,00,000 yojanas ( 10,400,000 miles) above the ‚ÄòGreat Bear‚Äô shines high the Pole Star and the‚ÄòSisumara System‚Äô or the Great Machine, comprising the Stars and Planets, resembling a Dolphin in water.‚Äù\n\nAnyways it‚Äôs an aquatic with the arrangement of the various celestial bodies at various places and varied interpretations through various sources always results in ambiguity üò¶ but what we require is the right conclusion and the form doesn‚Äôt matter üôÇ\n\nI hope this provides some clarification.\n\nSeeker 1: There is a difference between exoteric and esoteric approach of Scriptures. A symbol is unique and very special association of spiritual and mundane aspects. I respect the links and info you sent. But, the truth of it lies in ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù of the reasoning. The form is important, for it encompasses the subtle aspects that cannot be grasped on first sight. A dolphin is no symbol for Sisumara because, it‚Äôs back is smooth. The Tortoise back has divisions and a symmetry of arrangement of scales. This symmetry is mapped to the upper dome of visible skies (mahaakaasa) and inner dome of psychic skies (chittaakaasa). Also, the reference point from where all the measurements given in Bhagavatam are made, is not our solar system or our galaxy, but a far of star, in which is one of the 7 evolved solar systems (out of 12 ‚Äì hint: Dvaadasa Aadityas).\n\nBut one should ask, why speak of these magnitudes in a scripture whose sole goal was divine romance? One of reasons is the internal mapping of external Universe ‚Äì called ‚ÄúYay Pinde Tat Brahmaande ‚Äì As above so below‚Äù. Without this, one is left with mere glamour of vastness of scripture without applicability. And for this reason, turtle is used to suggest the role of Vishnu in preserving the secrets of Visible and invisible cosmos.\n\nAnother point is, the exoteric astrologists and astronomers think that the zodiac we are given the names of Ram, Bull, etc., for the shapes they resemble. This is absurd. The same reasoning I saw in above links when they said ‚Äúresemble dolphin‚Äù. No group of stars or constellation resemble any living being. It is the effects produced that resulted in their esoteric symbolical name. For example, if you refer to T.Subbarow‚Äôs essay on Zodiac, you will know how the constellation Leo or Simha got its name. Simha does not mean lion, bit in one of its derivative forms implies lion, in Sanskrit. Same with Aswa. So, unless the effects are perceived, it‚Äôs futile to understand visible arrangement as particular being. I hope you understand the roots off the approach. Exoteric helps you up to certain extent. But true esoteric intuition from within tales you and helps you cross the ocean of mysticism.\n\nSeeker 2: I can clearly observe your analytical brain to put forth logical arguments at the drop of a hat. Tortoise is used to a great effect in Bhagavad Gita‚Äôs second chapter as well as to how to withdraw our senses and keep it under control. Vishnu or Rishikesha is master of senses and sense control and so it is for a big reason to specify tortoise and give so much importance to it.\n\nBhagavatham says there are millions and millions of universes floating in the causal ocean and virata rupa is associated with each one of them‚Ä¶Lord Brahma is associated with each one of them‚Ä¶the arrangement of 14 planetary systems is associated with each of them‚Ä¶and so on‚Ä¶\n\nLikewise each living organism itself is a universe with a microcosmic arrangement with the equivalent arrangement of planetary systems. the part from the waist is considered asoucha or impure and it is where the lower 7 planetary systems starting from atala to patala are situated‚Ä¶and then similarly we move upwards from bhur loka towards the top of the head which is satyaloka where the supreme consciousness and the control system or brain centre is located.\n\nThis body is a temple and the heart is the altar where the deity of supreme God resides. When we abuse the body mind and soul with impure food impure thoughts and impure actions the entire universe (our body) is polluted and similarly the entire physical universe is polluted in that way as we try to dominate the material nature rampantly! Material Universe has its own process to circulate itself in the form of eternal time through yuga cycles but this material body decays and the soul just keep transmigrating from body to body having failed to realise the ultimate purpose of life.\n\nSeeker 1üôÇ Let‚Äôs reserve this for our later topic ‚Äì conversation: ‚ÄúThe mysteries of multiverse and monoverse in scripture‚Äù. The comment section will be bloated with incoherent comments (when we look back in future).\n\nSeeker 2: To conclude for now :), my last comment is in connection with the virata rupa or the universal form of the Supreme Lord floating in the waters causal ocean ‚Äì the concept of Nara ‚Äì Naarayaana ‚Äì in a particular shape equating In the form of an aquatic organism like dolphin or tortoise or porpoise (or whale (dolphin is an evolved sub-species of whale) etc.) existing in the real world for us to perceive the universal form of the Lord and the various entities in the universe situated at various points in the body to initiate us in our spiritual realisation/meditation process to conclude that there is nothing beyond this in the material world. This is just to summarise the entire universal process. It is the first stage of God realisations as we look at things externally. Then we start to look at the Paramaatma or the Super soul residing internally in our own heart as the first intuitive spiritual guru. The final stage is the realization of the Absolute Truth as the Bhagawan or The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Shri Krishna as a reservoir of the 64 transcendental qualities in full opulence. (https://mykrishnaourkrishna.blogspot.com/2016/11/krishnas-transcendental-qualities.html). This transcedental realisation enables us to be in full communion or in union with the Supreme!\n\nSeeker 2: Good morning. How are you doing today?\n\nSeeker 1: I don‚Äôt know what is happening with me. These days are not normal for me. How about you???\n\nSeeker 2: Going on as usual üôÇ\n\nSeeker 2: This is the morning puja that I attended in the nearby temple today. Satyanarayana Puja done by a very old couple (above 75 years) so nicely and with so much dedication. They do it during the full moons. Please take a look at the photo closely. Surely it should bring you some peace. I am at peace for sure for being a part of this puja. Surely Lord Naaraayanaa will protect me and anyone who see this.\n\nSeeker 2: Take a closer look at that lamp that is glowing so beautifully and radiantly. There is also a big snake hill where this is present that makes this more auspicious.\n\nSeeker 1: Thank you!\n\nSeeker 2: I have often been ridiculed enough by people around me for my inability to earn enough money etc. So I find this is the only thing that is satisfying. I stopped talking to people much because that only frustrates my original intentions.\n\nSeeker 2: I am spending a lot of time daily in spiritual pursuits and sleep less than 5 hours a day, but this is hardly affecting me in anything.\n\nSeeker 1: It‚Äôs okay. Please go ahead with what you are doing since it gives you much needed peace of mind.\n\nSeeker 2: Thank you.\n\nSeeker 2: The great Nikola Tesla just slept 2 hrs a day all his life and lived upto 87 years üôÇ\n\nSeeker 2: I also listen to lot of divine music because that totally keeps me away from gossip and all the nonsense happening around me.\n\nSeeker 2: It is only our own self-improvement that we can improve because we cannot improve anyone else‚Ä¶this is the bitter reality and experience all my life. I am sure you also have the same opinion. If people gossip I can only understand the shallowness they have built in themselves.\n\nSeeker 1: Yes, I totally agree to this!\n\nSeeker 2: I am learning to take everything and everyone and everyday as same üôÇ\n\nSeeker 1: No I don‚Äôt think you should do this.\n\nSeeker 1: Don‚Äôt do this!\n\nSeeker 1: Try to change it!\n\nSeeker 2: Feeling everyone and everything incompatible with me I have to think like this only. Not able to lead a pretending life.\n\nSeeker 2: You will come to realize this at some point. Hopefully you don‚Äôt have to get that far in your life üôÇ\n\nSeeker 2: I do hope you get lots of understanding people in future. This is a world where everyone wants to happily ride on others back without actually attempting to do anything on their own.\n\nSeeker 2: Frankly I don‚Äôt want to earn a living like this‚Ä¶and I also lost the intention to go to office to work‚Ä¶sometime I think for whose sake I am working for‚Ä¶when everyone is indifferent and only want to suck my blood‚Ä¶everyone is too materialistic‚Ä¶all they judge is the earning power. Once that goes even family members treat you like dirt‚Ä¶when you lose the trust with someone who can be as close. What else is there in life?\n\nSeeker 2: I mean by creating some relationship that is binding for life?\n\nSeeker 2: I mean that can be the last thing you don‚Äôt want in your life!\n\nSeeker 2: ‚ÄúSharp arrows which pierce one‚Äôs chest and reach the heart do not cause as much suffering as the arrows of harsh, insulting words that become lodged within the heart when spoken by uncivilized men. (/women)‚Äù Srimad Bhagavatham ‚Äì 11.23.3\n\nSeeker 2: It just doesn‚Äôt go away for the rest of the life‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just like living in a cage where there is no escape‚Ä¶\n\nSeeker 2: I mean when you live around people who don‚Äôt have any higher value of life and all they want is money, assets, relationships and the so called superfluous enjoyment that goes with it‚Ä¶\n\nSeeker 2: I don‚Äôt think anyone will get into a conversation with me if I talk like this‚Ä¶they would only think I am too pessimistic and don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù life üôÇ\n\nSeeker 2: But according to whatever I have read human life is not for enjoyment‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a gift to realize what has been going on all the time and it is only possible for a human life to break away from this ever continuing birth and death.\n\nSeeker 2: I mean God has given this opportunity to at least make someone like you understand the real fact about life and not live in illusion created by the reflective or reverse energy called Maya created by Lord Krishna that deludes everyone to create an attachment for impermanent things and transmigrate from species to species‚Ä¶body to body‚Ä¶life after life undergoing the same struggle for existence in whatever lifeless body that the soul finds refuge.\n\nSeeker 2: It is so sad that no one take these facts with any level of seriousness and I am not even able to find the environment to explain these things to people living with me all the time!\n\nSeeker 2: Such is the power of this Maya!\n\nSeeker 2: ‚ÄúMaterial enjoyment is indeed the cause of all unhappiness, but one cannot give it up unless one has personally experienced how much suffering it is. Therefore one should be allowed to remain in so-called material enjoyment while simultaneously advancing in knowledge to experience the misery of this false material happiness. Then, without help from others, one will find material enjoyment detestful. Those whose minds are changed by others do not become as renounced as those who have personal experience. Although I live in household life with my wife and children, I honestly follow the Vedic injunctions by engaging in fruitive activities to enjoy life without sinful reactions.‚Äù ‚Äì Srimad Bhagavatham 6.5.41 ‚Äì 42.\n\nSeeker 2: So, no matter how much I tell you it‚Äôs not possible for you to get to the deepest truths to go through, unless it is assimilated by personal experience combining with the knowledge from scriptures.\n\nIt‚Äôs very well known that a man‚Äôs life is extremely incomplete without a woman/women. He owes his very existence to a woman who bears in her womb for a period of at least nine months, undergoing all sorts of pain and discomfort. A man cannot even simply imagine the pain, strain and agony that a woman undergoes during her time of giving birth to a child. As a mother, a woman plays a critical role in nurturing the infant and is the first teacher. As a child grows up, various women plays different roles accordingly. From a teacher, mentor, peer, friend, colleague to a loving wife.\n\nAll of us know this. Nothing new!\n\nBut our Vedas and scriptures attach much more significance and more responsibilities to the fairer sex than that what I have mentioned above. I had just mentioned the tip of the ice berg!\n\nThe subtle but significant aspects of human life has been stressed throughout our Vedas and Upanishads and expressed more clearly as corollaries in the form of Ithihasas (Ramayana and Mahabharata) and Puranas (Srimad Bhagavatham, Vishnu, Garuda, Padma, Shiva, Skanda etc.).\n\nA typical example is Panchakanya or five ideal women (Ahalya, Draupadi, Kunti / Sita , Tara and Mandodari)\n\nAhalyƒÅ draupadƒ´ kunti tƒÅrƒÅ mandodarƒ´ tathƒÅ ‡•§\n\npa√±cakanyƒÅ·∏• smarennitya·πÉ mahƒÅpƒÅtakanƒÅ≈õinƒ´·∏• ‡••\n\nEnglish translation\n\nAhalya, Draupadi, Kunti, Tara and Mandodari\n\nOne should forever remember the panchakanya who are the destroyers of great sins\n\nA variant replaces Sita with Kunti:\n\nahalyƒÅ draupadƒ´ sƒ´tƒÅ tƒÅrƒÅ mandodarƒ´ tathƒÅ ‡•§\n\npa√±cakanyƒÅ·∏• smarennitya·πÉ mahƒÅpƒÅtakanƒÅ≈õinƒ´m ‡••\n\nPeople practicing Sanatana Dharma, especially married ladies, remember the Panchakanya in this daily Morning Prayer.\n\nTheir names are extolled and the prayer is pratah smaraniya, prescribed to be recited in the early hours of the morning.\n\nThe panchakanya literally means five kanyas. Kanya may be translated as girl, daughter, maiden or virgin.\n\nBy the Vedic injunctions, the wife is accepted as the better half of a man‚Äôs body because she is assigned the responsibilities of discharging half of the duties of the husband. For a grihastha (for those in the married order of life), the wife is considered to be the source of liberation because she offers her service to the husband for his ultimate liberation. Marriage is actually a duty performed in mutual cooperation for spiritual advancement.\n\nThe critical role of a woman as a wife in a man‚Äôs life is mentioned directly in Srimad Bhagavatham:\n\n‚ÄúO hero [Vidura], Diti, being thus afflicted by the contamination of lust, and therefore poor and talkative, was pacified by the son of Marƒ´ci in suitable words. O afflicted one, I shall forthwith gratify whatever desire is dear to you, for who else but you is the source of the three perfections of liberation? As one can cross over the ocean with seagoing vessels, one can cross the dangerous situation of the material ocean by living with a wife. O respectful one, a wife is so helpful that she is called the better half of a man‚Äôs body because of her sharing in all auspicious activities. A man can move without anxiety entrusting all responsibilities to his wife. As a fort commander very easily conquers invading plunderers, by taking shelter of a wife one can conquer the senses, which are unconquerable in the other social orders. O queen of the home, we are not able to act like you, nor could we repay you for what you have done, even if we worked for our entire life or even after death. To repay you is not possible, even for those who are admirers of personal qualities. Even though it is not possible to repay you, I shall satisfy your sex desire immediately for the sake of begetting children. But you must wait for only a few seconds so that others may not reproach me.‚Äù\n\nSrimad Bhagavatham: Canto 3 ‚Äì Chapter 14: Pregnancy of Diti in the evening ‚Äì Verses 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 & 22.\n\nThis clearly sums up the phenomenon of material existence in this universe. Human beings gets conditioned by Maya, the illusory energy of the Supreme Lord to transact its activities for existence but gets entangled when they forget the very purpose of life by getting fully absorbed only in the four material activities: eating, sleeping, mating and defending.\n\nHere is an example of an henpecked husband lured by the extreme beauty of the female body and involved in extreme glorification of his wife (though this glorification about one‚Äôs wife is an undeniable fact) but he is doing at the wrong time of the day when he should have restrained her ‚Äì the twilight hours are considered to be period to perform Vedic rites/devotional service and nothing else. Moreover, he is a Rishi and was involved in austere activities at the time. But he was powerless to stop the lusty advances of his wife. Thus by giving vain reasons that would obviously be unacceptable to her in her situation that time, he tries to post pone the act but miserably fails!\n\n‚ÄúDiti was thus informed by her husband, but she was pressed by Cupid for sexual satisfaction. She caught hold of the clothing of the great brƒÅhma·πáa sage, just like a shameless public prostitute. Understanding his wife‚Äôs purpose, he was obliged to perform the forbidden act, and thus after offering his obeisances unto worshipable fate, he lay with her in a secluded place.‚Äù\n\nSrimad Bhagavatham: Canto 3 ‚Äì Chapter 14: Pregnancy of Diti in the evening ‚Äì Verses 30 ‚Äì 31.\n\n‚ÄúThe learned Ka≈õyapa said: Because of your mind‚Äôs being polluted, because of defilement of the particular time, because of your negligence of my directions, and because of your being apathetic to the demigods, everything was inauspicious. O haughty one, you will have two contemptuous sons born of your condemned womb. Unlucky woman, they will cause constant lamentation to all the three worlds! They will kill poor, faultless living entities, torture women and enrage the great souls.‚Äú\n\nSrimad Bhagavatham: Canto 3 ‚Äì Chapter 14: Pregnancy of Diti in the evening ‚Äì Verses 38 , 39 & 40.\n\nThus the two most vicious demons Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu were born because of performing the act at an inappropriate time and not according to scriptural injunctions. The effect of this act is also mentioned in Bhagavad Gita:\n\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 1 ‚Äì Observing the Armies on the Battlefield of Kuruksetra ‚Äì Verse 40\n\n‚ÄúWhen there is deliberate negligence of the regulative principles of religious life, the women as a class become polluted, and as a result there are unwanted children. When irreligion is prominent in the family, O Krsna, the women of the family become corrupt, and from the degradation of womanhood, O descendant of Vrsni, comes unwanted progeny.‚Äù\n\nHence, moderation and restraint in any activity is essential to lead a sane and ideal life.\n\nBhagavad Gita: Chapter 6 ‚Äì Sankhya Yoga ‚Äì Verse 16\n\n‚ÄúThere is no possibility of one‚Äôs becoming a yogi, O Arjuna, if one eats too much, or eats too little, sleeps too much or does not sleep enough.‚Äù\n\nRelated posts:\n\nConversation 015 ‚Äì Women in the material world\n\nConversation 008: Sacred Seven Steps during marriage and its relevance in modern days"
