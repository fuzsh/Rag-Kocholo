Giovanni in Fiore, 24 – 00178 Roma Tel. 067180832 www.istitutocintamani.org [email protected]\n\n1\n\nWHAT IS IN THIS BOOK Everybody in this world wants to be happy. But while attempting to be so he usually suffers. Why? Because he does not know the Art of Living and the Art of Dying! What is the Art of Living & the Art of Dying which make him happy? Swami Govindananda Bharati, otherwise know as the Sri Shivapuri Baba, tells us the Law of Truth. This Law of Truth consists of the Right Living with its 3 DISCIPLINES Physical, Mental/Moral and Spiritual. The First Discipline gives him a sound Body and an efficient Intellect. He becomes healthy and a successful man and becomes fit to enjoy this material world. He then attains happiness (Sukha). But the drawback in this is that this happiness is temporary only because when he dies his happiness “dies” too”! The Second Discipline makes his Mind stable, steady and tranquil by freeing him from Anxieties & Worries. As a result he become immune to the “illegal” Desires (Iccha), Likes (Rag) and Dislikes (Dweshas). This makes him a strong man so that he becomes capable of commanding & controlling the whole world by his Psychic or Yogic Powers. Needless to say that he becomes happy too because he gets great Contentment (Santosh). But this also is perishable after death. The Third Discipline, on the contrary, takes him beyond these two and removes his Ignorance totally and makes him know what is what of everything and Beyond. He then attains Peace (Shanti), Total Freedom, the Highest Power and 100% Satisfaction. In other words he attains and virtually becomes the Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute (Satchidananda) Itself. In this way he fulfils the purpose of his life. His Father God then allows him to enter His Kingdom, Heaven (as the Bible says), or His Abode of No Return (as the Gita says). Nothing is left for him to enjoy or to know or to achieve for he is Bliss itself, Knowledge itself and Achievement itself personified!\n\n2\n\nRIGHT LIVING\n\nBeing the Teachings of Sri Govindananda Bharati.

But, needless to say, these Teachings have their universal value and therefore are of great use to other people like me who are interested in the search for the Truth or the Right Life. When some like-minded and close friends came to know about this document they urged me to publish this in the form of a small book. I have divided this book into five parts, .the special feature being the INTERVIEWS which I took, in the course of Satsang, since about 25 years, of some Nepali devotees, who more or less visited the Shivapuri Baba almost for the same period. I culled these nectars from them as a bee does from numberless flowers. I am a humble collector only. These interviews have inspired and helped me very much. I am however especially grateful to the late Thakurlal Manandhar, Prof. Renulal Singh and Karkat Man Tuladhar from whom I learnt a great deal. May their souls remain in peace! To all those living devotees also who inspired me and so graciously given their valuable time, I must express my gratefulness. It is entirely their cooperation and patience which have materialized in the form of this book. I am also grateful to Giridharlal Manandhar and Govindalal Singh, able sons of Thakurlal Manandhar and Prof. Renulal Singh respectively, who have kindly given permission to include the materials concerned with their deceased fathers. Like a student of Chemistry who uses his Guide Book in his laboratory for conducting his experiments,, so also a student of Right Life, must use this document as a Practical Guide in the laboratory of Life, for the quest of God or Truth or the Ultimate. There may be some errors in this book. These will be removed later on if I come know them. I also humbly request the readers to kindly help me by their valuable suggestions. Lastly, my humble felicitations to the holy feet of the Shivapuri Baba. YBS\n\n8\n\nPREFACE To the Second Edition WHO (World Health Organisation) has defined Health as “physical, mental and social well-being of man and not only the mere absence of diseases”. But, according to the Shivapuri Baba, this definition is not correct because this fails to consider man’s most important health, i.e., Spiritual Health. He says further that unless man attains his Total Health, he cannot be free from all diseases. Therefore he must suffer the agony of sordid existence and its results again and again. HOW? By living the Right Life. WHAT are those diseases which man must suffer unless he lives the Right Life, Well, they are the Three Ills, the so called Tribidha Tapas, viz. Physical (Adhibhautic), Mental & Phenomenal (Adhidaivic) and Spiritual (Adhyatmic) Sufferings. Stated differently, this means that man can very well become physically healthy, materially prosperous, intellectually dexterous and socially well. He can therefore become successful in all his works or assignments. Naturally then he achieves happiness (Sukha). Again, by becoming free from Likes and Dislikes and unlawful Desires, he can make his mind stable and tranquil so that no Anxieties and Worries can “touch” him! In this way, he attains Contentment (Santosh). And finally, he insures himself against Temptations, Fears and Ignorance (The three powerful attributes of MAYA-God’s Power): as a result of this, he attains Peace (Shanti) and thus achieves the Spiritual Health. In this way he comes to know what is what of everything, the purpose of Life in general and Human Life in particular. When he attains all these three - Happiness, Contentment and Peace - he said to have attained the Highest or Holistic Health. Now, after coming to know this Truth, how can a sincere doctor of Medicine, whose job is to remove the illnesses, satisfy himself professionally simply by attending to the physical, mental and social ills of his clients? If he limits himself in these illnesses only, he may be said to be merely “scratching the side of the barrel” and therefore not doing his duty properly! One may argue that it is sufficient for him to know all about them. But knowing them alone does not mean attaining the Spiritual Health. So that he is nowhere near the Goal, the Total Health! Therefore he or for that matter his patients, must find a better doctor than himself, an Enlightened doctor. This particular Doctor therefore must be in a position to know all about the diseases from which man is suffering: he must also have “seen” the Truth, the Whole Truth, a true “Seer” in the highest sense of the word and practically a Lighthouse who can show the Right Path to the wayward or suffering mankind. However such a person is very rarely found in this world! As for myself, I am fully convinced that the Shivapuri Baba is such a man or a Healer. That was the reason why, I believe, this great man and his Teachings, like a strong magnet, pulled me, a mere iron piece, towards him with such a great 9\n\nforce that I became sufficiently motivated to devote enough time - not only days and months but many years - to learn his “secret!” And, I am glad to admit that this has proved extremely fruitful for me as well as my patients. Gradually, a strange truth revealed itself to me: I found myself to be not a doctor but a patient himself, suffering from the same diseases as my patients! I then realized the truth of saying, “Physician, heal thyself first! Know thyself first!” You may then ask me, “What is so special about SB’s Teachings? Well, SB Teachings are very simple, straightforward, practicable and applicable to every person in this world - from the dullest to the most intelligent—and most important of all, free from the prejudice of colors, creeds, dogmas, rituals and so on. His Teachings take us straight to the root of the problem, viz., Life Itself. Contrary to this, other so-called religions, like so many political parties, deal with the problems of this Life only, or prune only the “branches of the tree!” so that the “tree” keeps on growing more and more! Therefore they, at their best, are in à position to offer only palliative treatment whereas SB gives curative treatment to all of his patients. With this fact constantly in my mind therefore, I, like a bee, have tried to collect the nectar and put in a container in the form of this book. I have tasted this nectar and found it good, in fact the very best to me, so far! Let others interested too taste it! Regarding this publication: I have revised this Edition thoroughly, removed the errors as far as practicable and added some details in the INTERVIEWS, included a new part - SATSANG - and also an APPENDIX. I consider them as parts of the Applied Truth, which are very important to understand the Principles of Right Life, the Pure Truth. Lastly, I thank all my friends and seniors who help me to prepare this book in so many ways.

I was in a fix as they say. I had to start my life afresh from a new place and a new environment and there was nobody to guide me. And I remembered the saying, “God is the only refuge of the helpless”. So I became spiritually inclined, probably as an escape mechanism. It was during this time I met Prof. Nil Bir Singh Kansakar, who talked about the Sri Shivapuri Baba and his Right Life. His talk with SB ran as follows: NBSK: Sir, what is RL? SB: It is, in short, a life based on the Three Principles of Sheel, Samadhi and Pragya. NBSK: So that Buddha’s Teachings and yours are the same? SB: Buddha came to realize, after his Realization, that the path which he took for Enlightenment was difficult and a steep one which only a few can negotiate. So it could be taken only by exceptionally brilliant and strong people. People in general are therefore not fit to go that way. He therefore preached a Middle Path, which was relatively easier and practicable, for the greatest good of the greatest number. This was similar to the RL. In this the spiritual seeker does not need to undergo extreme hardship nor renounce the world, but can reach the Goal of Enlightenment by following a life of Discipline and Meditation. He therefore formulated Eight-fold path based on the above three ingredients. Prof. NBS Kansakar was a Buddhist by birth and SB tried to tell him about RL in the Buddhist way. Nevertheless, when SB said that Man’s unhappiness was entirely due to his own wrong living, away from the Three Disciplines, as propounded by him, my heart gave a faint echo of remembrance of the spiritual knowledge and practice I voluntarily underwent in my school days. But they were largely due to the General Teachings I learnt from the books I had studied then. They had implored me to “be good and do good” sort of things only. I therefore had no chance of learning the Specific Teachings which could be available from a real Guru alone. For this I was not spiritually mature at that time. Because, if I had matured, I would not have postponed my visit to Shivapuri Baba after reaching the gate of his hermitage or Ashram then! However, being already quite conversant with the traditional lores of Hindu scriptures, I was familiar with the professor’s exchange of thoughts. And it touched a chord in my heart. I said to myself that Arjuna had his crisis, the phase of Bishaad Yoga, or Depression of spirit from loss of hope, courage or confidence as described in the Gita, from which his friend, Krishna saved him. In my case, I felt, Shivapuri Baba was the one who could save me! Some time later, in the early 1968 AD my friend, Dr. K. N. Vaidya, kindly took me to the Samadhi of the Baba, because SB had already left the body by the end of January 1963! We went to the Ashram by crossing a rivulet, Tilganga, climbed a small hillock, went through a small gate in the barbed wire fence, and finally entered the Samadhi Mandir: it was a room in the centre of which was a 12\n\nplatform with a stone image of Shiva installed on its top, the body of the Baba being buried underneath. There was an epitaph quoting Bhartrihari in Sanskrit singing the glory of a Mendicant who slept like a king on the bare earth with his arms as a pillow, sun and moon as his lamps, Vairagya as his “wife”, although bereft of all desires. Then in Nepali: Here lies the Samadhi of Sri Shivapuri Baba (Srimat Paramhamsa Govindananda Bharati) And then in English:\n\n1826-1963 A. D. “RIGHT LIFE” Devotion And Discrimination (Spiritual, Moral and Physical Disciplines) Time of Samadhi 6 A.M. Magh 15, 2019 BS, or 28 January 1963 A.D. I felt as if I entered an air-conditioned room. A strong electric current instantly flowed inside me from nowhere and spread all over my body, from my head to feet. The tension in my muscles disappeared, my heart beats slowed down, my previous discomfiture and uneasiness evaporated and I felt peace, tranquillity and inner happiness which I had not experienced any time before in my life! With thrill in every bit of my body, tears started flowing from my eyes spontaneously and I felt guilty to myself for the injustice done to myself by myself by not visiting the place previously and for not paying due respect to the Baba when I returned from his Ashram door in my school days. I had missed the bus as they say, for which I have only myself to blame, and therefore I must therefore suffer for the mistake. I then slowly understood the significance of a picture I noticed long time ago of a hermit who was sitting under a tree of his Ashram with animals of opposite temperaments such as a tiger and a deer, a snake and a mongoose, a monkey and a dog; and amongst men, noble men and dacoits sitting peacefully on the ground, not at all with fear but with the expression of a great happiness in their faces! In other words, there was no sign of negative feelings in them and the hermit was showering love, kindness and blessings from every pore of his body. The Mandir was kept clean and fragrant with the pleasant smell of the incense. Some photographs of SB were displayed on the walls, one such photo being taken when SB was 112 years “young,” printed in the cover page of the book Long Pilgrimage. On going round the Ashram later I found some devotees, viz. TL, KM, etc. whom I happened to know already.\n\n13\n\nThe Ashram: The Ashram has about 30 ropanees of land encircled by a barbed wire-fence. On the south there stood a wooden cottage in which SB used to sleep, two one storied buildings, meant for a guard (chowkidar) and a servant in the East, and another one built by KD for the seekers who wanted to stay there for their spiritual pursuits. From 1952 AD onwards two guards were deputed by His Majesty’s Government for the care of the Ashram. A gate stood in the north through which one could go to Pashupati or Guheswari temples or the Military camp and the Airport in the east, the south section being the continuation of the forest. Rest of the Ashram had trees everywhere. The entire place was vibrating with the peace and tranquillity, a wonderful place for a spiritual retreat, charged with a current indescribable; holier place than this, I felt, could rarely be found elsewhere. The symphony of music mixed intermittently with the pleasant chirpings of other birds pervaded the whole Ashram area. I therefore made up my mind to return there for my quest, which I had so foolishly ignored till then. Incidentally, after SB’s demise, King Mahendra had prepared a plan to make an appropriate Gurukul out of the Ashram. But, in view of the lack of a full-time devotee, well versed in SB’s thought and action, this had to be shelved. What were the routine activities of the Ashram? Well, this was the question asked by one Mahamandaleswar when he visited the Ashram some years ago. I was present then. Thakurlal answered him as follows: “We do not practice any Sadhana or Samadhi in particular. We do not have any organization nor any-organized meetings nor Bhajan nor Kirtan, etc. in this Ashram. We do not follow any Marga nor any Yoga. We have been told by our Guru that they lead to Siddhis rather than to God. “Discipline your, Mind, keep your body fit and your Soul turned towards Him”, he said, and we try to practice them as much as we can - that is all!” When SB was very ill his devotees had asked him what one should do after he is gone. SB had replied, “You four or five people should come here every weekend, or, if possible, even daily, to discuss amongst yourselves your defects and find out the solution in the light of RL I have taught you. One who has the defects should acknowledge them with humility: while seriously discussing, one may even come to blows, if necessary, but with no heat, no ill feeling, and thus try to improve oneself... If you can do that, you may even command the world itself.” In this way I came into contact with the local devotees of SB. To derive as much benefit as I can, I started interviewing almost all of them, as a part of my Satsang, one by one and, in the process, I learnt a great deal of the Teachings of SB. To Thakurlal and Renulal especially I am grateful for enlightening me in details as and when necessary. I went to Thakurlal about twice a week for at least 2 decades and to Renulal for at least one decade; and whenever I visited them they gave enough of their time to me. Whatever I have come to know about RL today is mostly due to their kindness. Renulal also lent me the voluminous notes he had taken in the course of his association with SB and permitted me to use them as I thought proper.\n\n14\n\nWHAT is the RIGHT LIFE? The best answer this question can be understood if we quote Prof. Renulal Singh, mentioned as a Hindu Visitor in the book Long Pilgrimage. The conversation ran as follows. Q. Sir, why are we so unhappy? A. Because you don’t live the Right Life. Q. What is the Right Life? A. It is the life with some definite aim. It is a planned and disciplined life, with duties necessary and helpful for achieving the aim in the shortest possible time. Q. What is the greatest aim of life? A. To see the Truth. Q. Why should we want to see the Truth? A. Because before that we cannot be omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. Q. What are the chief elements of the Right Life? A. Discrimination and Devotion. Q. Please explain them. A. You see for maintaining your body, you have to discharge certain duties towards nature, towards family, towards society, towards government and towards profession. All these should be planned and done with dexterity. Then for making your mind strong, you have to cultivate virtues, charity, self-control, fearlessness and patience, together with the rest of the 26 virtues described in the 16th chapter of the Gita. This is Discrimination. The rest of the time you should devote to thinking of Truth in various ways without feeling monotonous. This is Devotion. The most important thing is to see that you do not waste your time on any other work. SB said this to a Buddhist (viz. Mandas Tuladhar) in another way: “Sheel, Samadhi, Pragya and Astaanga Maarga of Buddhism is Swadharma or RL”. MD: What is the difference between RL and other religions? SB: RL is Viswadharma, i.e., Universal Religion. It is more ancient that Vedic Dharma also. Only this Dharma or Religion should remain; all others should go. Q. Why RL is so special? A. Because all religions are there to solve the problems of life. RL alone considers life itself as a problem viz: Why are we born at all? Likewise, SB, talked to the Christians as follows: Q. Why RL is superior to Christianity? A. Because RL is universal and it is Natural Life. Take, for example, the breathing. Can you say, “I won’t breathe?” So with eating, etc. Regulate them. This reminds me of the three monkeys, each one covering his eyes, ears, and mouth 15\n\nrespectively, indicating thereby not to see, hear or speak what is not needed more than necessary and also to avoid non-duties with their resultant commission and omission. Details of RL and the THREE DISCIPLINES As mentioned already, if Man wants to live life happily, one must live RL. And in order to live RL, you need to plan everything ahead and live accordingly. Thus he has to perform his Duties only (Karma) and should not do any NonDuties, i.e. useless (Akarma) and harmful works (Vikarma). This will make him avoid Commission and Omission: this is the Physical Discipline. During the performance of one’s duties, he should not have any unlawful desires nor any liking and disliking, under the sway of his Mind: this is the Moral Discipline. He should then try to cultivate virtues. (the 26 Virtues as mentioned in the 16th Chapter of the Gita) and meditate on God: this is the Spiritual Discipline. The Duties, useless and Harmful activities described above is SB’s interpretation of Karma, Akarma, & Vikarma, in the light of RL which is what the Gita says in his opinion. So that this should not be interpreted otherwise as when people take Akarma as no Karma and so on. SB says that if you live the First Discipline wrongly, you will face Failures in life, because of the defect in your Intellect. Likewise if you live the Moral Discipline wrongly, you will face Anxieties, because of the defect of your Mind. And again, if you live Spiritual Discipline wrongly, you will face Fears, because of the defect in your Soul. These three results are the so called Threefold Miseries, the Tribidha Taapa. Take Your Choice: While living RL you have a choice: if you want Pleasure (Sukha) only, you should live the First Discipline rightly. If you want Serenity (Santosh), you should live the Second Discipline rightly. Thus the fast two disciplines will give you a Bliss which is impermanent and recurrent cycles of births & deaths. Whereas the Third Discipline will take you to Beyond, i.e. God or the Ultimate, characterized by Satchidananda, i.e. Existence-Knowledge-Bliss Absolute. Let Us Try To Elaborate This: Why Physical Discipline? To avoid the chain-reaction of commission and omission, to decrease the result of past Misdeeds (Prarabdha), to cut short the long chain of rounds of births and deaths, to shorten your journey to your Destiny - the immediate result being Bliss or Happiness (Sukha). Why Moral Discipline? For the same purpose as above - the immediate result being Serenity (Santosh). Why Spiritual Discipline? To remove Ignorance for all time, this being the precursor of all troubles, the threefold miseries of existence - the immediate result being Peace (Shanti).\n\n16\n\nStated Differently: First: SB: used to say, “For a mistake in the Intellect today, there will be Failures tomorrow; for the mistake in Morality, there will be Anxieties to-morrow; and for the mistake in Soul today there will be Fears to-morrow”. Second: The importance of RL lies in this: this RL respects Maya and her laws while living our daily life and also tries to peep beyond, if so desired. That is to say, RL does not negate Pleasure (Bhog) nor completely accept renunciation (Tyag) but tries to balance both with a constant aim for the Ultimate. Third: In this context let me quote Thakurlal from his “Right Life: an interpretation”: “If you are in RL without love of God (or Devotion), you may get into indulgence of the worldly or evoluted aspect of life, which means that your enjoyment will be like that of a king or emperor in the first stage, where physical or intellectual discipline takes the predominant part. If you are in RL without love of God (or Devotion) in the second stage, where moral discipline is predominant, you get powers like Siddhi (or the different Siddhis as they are called). If you get in RL without love of God (or Devotion) in the third stage, you get the bliss of Samadhi. If longing for God (or Devotion) is taken up as the common factor from the very beginning, you will not get involved in such indulgences as described, because the fact of meditation (or Devotion) implies the perfect retention in all the three stages of what the SB has called Discrimination and Devotion, which the Gita calls for “Non-attachment.” In other words, there is no liability to a confusion between the means and the end, which is God at any of the three stages”. This RL has come into being with the creation of man. God Himself has formulated this when He created man. He gave him the choice - the choice for this worldly life or choice for Beyond. This RL is called Sacrifice in the Gita; it was in this spirit I would say Lord Krishna said to Arjun in IV, Verses 1-3: “This immutable Yoga I imparted to the sun (Vivasan) who declared it to Manu. Manu proclaimed it to Iksvaku. Royal sages have known this Yoga thus traditionally transmitted. O Valiant prince! Due to lapse of long time, this Yoga has perished in this world. The same ancient Yoga has now been proclaimed to you by Me; for, you are a devotee and My comrade. Knowledge of this Yoga, indeed, is the highest mystery”. In other words, this Yoga or RL was imparted to Man when he was created by God. It was lost in course of time, only to be salvaged by Him, and again transmitted for Man’s benefit. Again, Krishna said to his friend “Bringing forth creatures together with sacrifice, the Lord of creatures said of old: Multiply by means of sacrifice, let it yield whatever you seek. By means of this sacrifice, nourish the Devas; let the Devas nourish you. Mutually nourishing, may you win the supreme good. 17\n\n“The Devas, nourished by sacrifices, will give you the enjoyments you seek. Verily he is a thief who enjoys without giving back to the Devas (a share of) the gifts given by them. Good men who take part of what remains after offering sacrifices are liberated from all sins, whereas the sinners who cook for their own sake live on their sins”. In other words, when God created Man, He also created the rules how to make best of life, as well as the way to get back to Him. Again: “Living beings are born of food; food is produced by rain. Rain is due to sacrifice. Sacrifice is the offspring of work. Know that this work is born of the Vedas, and that the Vedas are born of the imperishable Reality. Therefore, the all-pervading Veda is eternally rooted in sacrificial work. He who fails to conform to the cycle of functions thus established is, Arjun, a sinner, he revels in the sphere of sense-life; he lives in vain”. And later: “Therefore, unattached, always do the work that has to be done; for, doing work with detachment, man attains the Supreme”. Peculiarity of RL: RL varies from person to person; it is personal and private. Therefore it is Swadharma. So that RL may appear to the contradictory in the life of the same person at different setting. That was why, as will be evident from the Interviews printed later, SB prescribed differently to different devotees for Swadharma or RL is different for different person. Therefore one must Brick to one’s own Duty or Swadharma, even though it appears defective to other people. For example, SB prescribed the Name to the housewives who asked for his guidance whereas he scolded a Kirtan Group led by a certain well-educated Sanyasi. To him He said. “Being already a Sanyasi you should have become an adept in Enquiry now. You are demeaning yourself and therefore unworthy of the ochre robe you are wearing!” What was Duty or Dharma for the housewives here in this instance was not Duty or Dharma for the Sanyasi as mentioned above! And when one knows one’s own Swadharma one must stick to it. The Gita went so far as to suggest that it is better to die while performing one’s Dharma than ape another’s. Krishna said to his friend, Arjun, as follows: “Superior is the law of one’s own nature, though lacking in merits, to that of another even though well observed. Death in working out the law of one’s own nature is superior; but an alien law is fraught with risk”. Economics & Engineering of RL: RL is a great economy. For example, while performing the Physical Discipline one is advised to perform one’s duties only and nothing else. Similarly while living Moral Discipline one must not have unlawful desire nor like or dislike which happen to cross your path and while living Spiritual Discipline one must develop the Virtues and strain for God and nothing else.\n\n18\n\nWe then come to understand why such advice was given as “see least, hear least, speak least, Brahmacharya and so on? To conserve our energy. What for? Why? To direct this energy as a continuum, (Tailadharabat), like the flow of oil, into a series of smaller and smaller sized “pipe system of descending order” so to say, to create a tremendous force, while meditating, which becomes capable to open the floodgates of Maya with the sole objective of reaching God, man’s Ultimate Destiny, at a great speed. I remember how, in order to tap Hydro-Electricity, a dam is constructed to collect river water, (eg. Sundarijal Power Station), how the floodgates are opened, to allow certain amount of water to escape from the source, through a big channel of a metallic pipe which delivers water to a smaller sized pipesystem and so on till it reaches the dynamo which rotates, by the force of this water, at great speed, and thus generates electricity. Similarly, the conservation of life energy followed by its channeling through a “narrow pipe system” of Dharana & Dhyana and ultimately through the narrowest one of Enquiry produces “Electricity” of Enlightenment or God-Vision or Truth: That is the main purpose of RL or Disciplined Life, which harnesses Intellect, Mind and Soul simultaneously for God–Realization. Commanding & Controlling Powers: Here it may be opportune to mention the talk of GD and SB which ran as follows: GD: Sir, why at all we should perform the first two disciplines? SB: Firstly because, without doing them, our body will not be healthy. The diseased Body may not be capable of taking you forward in the path of your RL. Secondly, if your Intellect goes wrong, your work too goes wrong. This will give you Failures and therefore retards your journey to the Truth. GD: But a healthy Body is not very necessary for living RL, as you said sometime ago, if I am not mistaken? SB: Yes, it is so in certain cases. But generally speaking, for ordinary mortals, the disadvantages of diseases are pain, disability, lack of energy, lack of concentration, etc. They are such that the mind gets engaged with the physical part for most of the time, making them forget the main objective. Therefore they will tend to stop where they are and stagnate. GD: But why should I not deviate from the routine life now and then? SB: Because, if you do that, you would not be able to develop your Commanding & Controlling Powers. These Powers will come under you only when you fulfill your Fixed and Forced Duties unswervingly. Mind you, you should not care even if death comes to you while performing these duties! GD: Please elaborate. SB: Gandhi, Napoleon, etc. for example, were great because they had acquired their Commanding Powers; but they would have become greater if they had Controlling Powers also. For example, Ravan too had a great Commanding Power. He could order the world of men and even nature to a certain extent. In fact he once ordered the sun to stop moving when he was doing some special work, and the sun had to obey! As a matter of fact you too can command the Nature: but you must first command yourself. Performance of the fixed and 19\n\nforced duties rightly gives you the Commanding power. Look at the timetable on which railway system runs! If it runs otherwise, only chaos there will be! Of course you can deviate a little sometimes, for example, when you become ill, etc. But actually speaking, this comes under the Forced Duties really! GD: But in spite of the Commanding Power, Ravan had his fall. Why? SB: Because he did not have the Controlling Power! GD: How to develop Controlling Power? SB: By living Moral Discipline. Ravan failed because he did not live a moral life: he could not control himself regarding Sita, wife of Rama; so he had his downfall. Therefore you must develop Virtues and live under strict Moral Discipline to gain the Controlling Power. In this way I came to understand the value of performing my fixed and forced duties, and also the value of the fixed place of worship and of the fixed body and of fixed mind! What are these fixed and forced duties? Well, these are the Sacrifice, charity and Austerities (Yagya. Daana & Tapah) as Thakurlal has mentioned in his “Divine Heights of Shivapuri”. What are the Sacrifices (Yagyas)? (I) The Yagyas: They are 5 in number, namely, Brahma. Rishi, Bhoota, Manusya and Pitri Yagyas. The summary is as follows: 1. Brahma Yagya: Early rising, Bath, God-worship, Study of scriptures, Praying to God. 2. Pitri Yagya: Oblations to deceased parents after bath, bowing to parents and elders, & oblations to the deceased during meals, etc. 3. Bhoota Yagya: Cow-feeding, dog-feeding, etc. 4. Rishi Yagva: Service to the Guru & Satsang 5. Manusya Yagya: Charity or Service to a fellow human being. Comment on Pitri Yagya: This is done to express gratitude to one’s ancestors. Let us try to understand about our deceased parents from whom we have directly descended. Are we their products really? They too were the products of their parents, who again were the product of their parents and so on. Thus, ultimately we reach the Source, from which everything emerged. How to express gratitude to them? Well, for this again a rule was formulated by our ancestors that if you express gratitude to your parents plus their immediately preceding two generations you are practically expressing gratitude to all including the Source. In like manner, the other Yagyas also lead to Him. In fact these and such exercises had been planned by the ancient Seers to guide the people to higher and higher stages of their spiritual development. 20\n\nRegarding the Controlling Power again one needs to perform the above Yagyas mentioned in addition to the Charity & Austerities. Actually these are not separate compartments; they run from one to the other. However, Charity and Lawful Activities are the principal ingredients for developing the Controlling Power. (II) Charity (Daan): this should be done to the poor but meritorious students, cultural or learned persons and spiritual seekers through money, mind, speech and action. (III) Austerity (Tapah): this is sticking to one’s duty, irrespective of any loss or gain or risk. This comes under the Moral or Mental discipline. This leads one to taming of mind which has gone astray through many many lives! Also Man must accept his defects as defects, and try to remove them one by one. One must therefore study Chapter 16 of the Gita, as advised by SB to Thakurlal, Bhavani Shankar et al, and cultivate the 26 Virtues mentioned therein. One should take care however that these need not be practiced separately; but they should be made a part and parcel of one’s life style as one tries to live RL, in increasing proportion, everyday. Vigilance: While engaging himself in self-analysis and self-observation the seeker should be vigilant by keeping himself most impartial. He should also possess the patience of Himalayan Magnitude, I would say, for the simple reason that he may give too high or too low marks for his performance while practicing the Three Disciplines. Thus either way he may lose balance and become too elated or too depressed and thus deteriorate. Only when a Master comes forwards to give succor & guidance he comes to understand that Rome was not built in a day. In this way only he-may be able to keep up his struggle meaningful. Another example: In a tug of war each contesting party tries to win the other by pulling the rope to their side across a fined line on the playground. If one of the parties fords itself being pulled to the opposite side it digs its heels on the grounds sufficiently deeply. By this manoeuvre the pull may be stopped for a while so that, after putting in more resistance, this particular party may win the war! Likewise while practicing the 26 Virtues there is always a tug of war. The seeker should keep himself between the Virtues (Divine or Daivi Sampad) and the Vices (Devil or Asuric Sampad. The virtues may win; but oftentimes the vices may win. Nevertheless he must summon all his courage and keep resisting and pulling the opposite party and ultimately manage to win the game. Now, let us take one virtue e.g. Fearlessness, i.e. Abhaya. This may mean facing a tiger or a mad dog or a dacoit or a snake or walking in pitch darkness irrespective of say a danger of falling into a pit! Or this may mean, in such conditions of danger, even running away in the opposite direction and save oneself! If one does not do that it may turn out to be a fearlessness of a worst variety leading to one’s own destruction. Remember, the seeker will constantly find himself alternating between Fear & Fearlessness till he wins or loses. The same tug of war happens in the practice of other 25 Virtues as well. Likewise, while performing one’s duty one may face opposition or even persecution sometimes. Not with standing this he must 21\n\nfulfill his duty. In this way all the 26 Virtues need to be practiced. One must however take care that these virtues should be practiced as part and parcel of RL and Meditation and not isolatedly, i.e. one after the other. As a result the seeker gains the Controlling Power. Such a man becomes capable of ruling the whole world also; but usually he will not do so. Instead he will prefer to control himself and continue to live RL humbly and dutifully. Devotion and Discrimination: While Living RL a seeker must keep his balance constantly between Devotion and Discrimination. This is for his self-defence or selfpreservation mainly, the principal objective being the Realization of the Truth. As time goes on and as he matures, his life becomes fully disciplined: his Intellect becomes dexterous as shown by his success in all his undertakings; his Mind becomes quiet and peaceful giving way neither to his liking or disliking so that his Meditation comes to be established. He thus automatically develops more and more God-love or Bhakti (Devotion) so that when he retires (Vanaprastha stage) his God-love reaches new heights. Thus he will find himself nearer the Truth. One may ask, “How much nearer?” Well, SB’s answer to this is said to be (if you express this in mathematical terms) as follows: “The progress depends on your percentage of Devotion. If you have 75% have Discrimination and 25% Devotion you will see God after many many lives. And if you spend 50% of your time for each you will see Him after some lives. And if you spend more than 90% of your time in Devotion and the rest 10% in Discrimination, just to keep your Body and Soul together, you may see Him in this very life.” This means that a man of RL comes to this last stage only when he has completed the Three Disciplines in his previous life or does so in the present life. Generally speaking, and keeping the aforesaid condition in the mind, if the RL student is a sincere seeker he is expected to reach the above stage in his early sixties or late fifties. With this objective in view our ancient seers divided human life into 4 stages (Ashrams) and men into 4 Classes or Castes (Varnas). This classification was based on the concept of division of labor as well as on the stage of spiritual development of man. This device was intended to be a living device, flexible and changeable and was therefore a functional and not anatomical. i.e. not fossilized, or fixed or a dead one. In this context we remember the King Viswamitra, a Ksyatriya who became a Brahmana by dint of his great austerities. Meditation: Having lived RL in this aforesaid manner a seeker then finds himself trying to practice meditation. What is meditation? Well, there are countless number of texts regarding Meditation. A student or a seeker of Truth may therefore spend his entire lifetime trying one method of meditation after another, without anyway nearing, or mind you, achieving, the Goal! Pre-requisites for Meditation: 1. Master: During Meditation one can spend many more lives mistaking a milestone as 22\n\na terminus. Therefore, one needs a Guru. And the wise say, amongst the Gurus again, a God - Realized Guru alone can guide you rightly. He, being All-Knowing, knows the defects of the seeker, and also knows when or when not to guide him. The Guru is always prepared to wait till the aspirant matures, for he very well knows that his premature intervention may become fruitless and even preposterous like, say, teaching sex to a child! This leads us to the question: where and how can we get such a Guru? Well, according to SB, we will get one if necessary. When shall we get him then? That depends on the intensity of your search. There are Realized Souls in this world living silently, unknown to the people, but willing to help the genuine seeker. They will help you if you sincerely ask for one to God who will send him to you. “Faith is the only Guide here “SB said,” and even if the Guru is not a Realized one, but if the seeker has unflinching faith on him, God will appear in the form of his Guru, and will take him towards the Goal”. For this the seeker must be a genuine one, mature and also the right one (Adhikari) who has fulfilled the prerequisites by living a disciplined life. 2. Satsang: Another requirement is Satsang or the association with holy or likeminded spiritual aspirants. If one does not get this or gets it only infrequently, in a lukewarm fashion, the intensity of devotion diminishes proportionately, exposing him to the negative forces of Maya which lead him astray! Therefore one must be vigilant and continue to wear the armor of Satsang unceasingly. How To Meditate? The methods usually prescribed for Meditation are Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. SB too advised on them, but there is some variations which will be mentioned later. According to SB, Dharana means thinking of an object Generally and Dhyana means thinking of the same Specifically. Both of them lie in the domain of Sagun Upasana and therefore there will be image/images in such a meditation. To elaborate this: let me quote KPM: “For example, Sri Krishna: has any of us seen Him? Well, we hear about him, we read about him, we think of him, we imagine about him, as to how, for example, Gopis used to abandon everything on hearing his flute-call, how the young damsels took him as their lover, how the old people took him as their own son, how his enemies used to shake with fear at his thought! We think all these, and paint a picture - this is Dharana thinking of Krishna Generally. Then, we may think of him Specifically also: we may think of him in his 3-bends (Tribhangi) posture in which he leans his back on a cow while playing on his flute. We may also imagine his head, his curly crown of hair, the peacock feather upon it, his glowing face, his lotus-like eyes, the sharp nose, his red lips and the flute on them, his fingers playing on their holes, his blowing the flute, and we may even hear the celestial music coming out of it, (which enchanted not only people in general but also the animals and birds of Gokul and Brindavan), his yellow robes, his sky-blue skin and so on. Or we can meditate on his benevolent smile and his eyes only, beholding his Bhaktas with great love, kindness and forgiveness. This is all meditation. “One need not go to the utmost concentration i.e. Samadhi at all”, SB says, “if you dwell in Dharana & Dhyana adequately.” This is 23\n\nlike tying a cow to a post with a rope; when she is tied with a long rope, it is Dharana; when she is tied with a short one it is Dhyana and when she is tied with the shortest one, it becomes Samadhi”. In this context one should remember his warning that if one takes to exclusively Samadhi alone, he may even go mad, or may stray into Nirvikalpa Samadhi and may believe this as the Goal. We should then take to Enquiry. How? To this question of KPM, SB had replied as follows: “Suppose you are walking in complete darkness, you can see nothing: darkness surrounding you everywhere - in front, behind, at the sides, above and below. This is what is called staying in the Avarna. But you have to search Him in this condition! The problem increases more because you know nothing about Him, nor you have got an image of Him as in your Dhyana or Dharana nor you have any idea of him! There is nobody to guide you also! You are all alone, you are helpless: But you have only one positive factor- Faith on your Guru and your Goal and you too have love and also great longing for Him, and above all, He is also your only refuge. Therefore you can do nothing but submit to Him, cry to Him, ask Him to guide you, to reveal Himself, “O Lord, where are You? What is your nature? Who are you? Wherefrom is this Existence? What is it? Who am I? Reveal Thyself, reveal Thyself!”, etc. Long and tedious task it is; one cannot undertake this exercise for a long time. In spite of this, the seeker must struggle in this with utmost patience and loving insistence and continue to penetrate the smoky darkness. One may have to wait for ages. There is no choice, because the Revelation depends entirely on His Grace. Only when He is pleased with you, He will give you the Flash by lifting up the Veil. Then you will see Him face to face, as it were!” Listening to the importance of Enquiry, one devotee of SB decided to leave his routine of worship, scripture reading, telling the beads, meditation (Pooja, Paath, Jap, Dhyana), etc… To this SB warned, “Enquiry is a dry bread, Kanchha! You cannot eat it all the time. Enquiry again is like a single rupee coin, which, you are not in a position to earn at the first go! Instead you must stick to your old routine and thereby try to earn a pice or two every day! Thus, you will find, by the end of 100 days, that you have come to earn one rupee already! You have no other choice! Again, in view of the tiresome effort in Enquiry you need some rest. For this you should come down to Dharana & Dhyana, and after some time, when you become sufficiently strong, you try Enquiry again. In this way, Dharana & Dhyana provide you a resting place where you recoup yourself, and then, try your assault again. Enquiry therefore is a dry bread and Dharana and Dhyana consist of a full meal with rice, pulses, vegetables and so on. “In this way, one should go on - try, rest, wait & try again. This is what Effort (Purushartha) is really; and waiting patiently with loving insistence is Surrender. These should go together”. Thus, if one analyses all this fully, one will notice that SB has not stressed on wiping the mental projection (Vikshep) but on staying in Avarna. The 24\n\nreason is that when one stays in Avarna, the Vikshep automatically recedes to the background. The advantage is that, if one follows this method, one need not go into the details and intricacies of various meditation techniques. This confirms the saying that a good Teacher is one who simplifies the complex subject and makes his student understand it easily and in the shortest possible time. The student therefore receives the pure drink, the froth being already removed by the Teacher! Pitfalls In Meditation: 1. Danger of mistaking a milestone as a terminus: While discussing Meditation one usually talks of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. This has been dealt with elsewhere at some length. Suffice it is therefore to remember here the discussion of a Brahma Yogi with SB, which ran as follows: Q. In Nirvikalpa Samadhi there is union with God, the Ultimate. Is that true? A. Yes. But the seeker does not know that he has reached God. There is Bliss only. Q. But in the night also there is light! A. Yes, there is light. But it does not reveal things. They are revealed only when the Sun shines in the morning! It may be useful to remember what SB told to MD once that, “if at all you have Samadhi, you must have Samadhi with full consciousness (Sachetan Samadhi Chaahiye, Achetan Samadhi Nahin) not the senseless stupor! Furthermore, when you realize God, you must come to possess the principal characteristics of God-Realization such as Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, Bliss and Immortality.” SB also stressed that once you realize the Truth you realize It for ever and also, you become God Himself!” 2.There should be no assertion in Meditation at all: While meditating there should be no assertion of any kind at all. If the seeker, however, takes to assertion of some kind or other, he should remember that he might have borrowed them from somebody or some text, scriptural or otherwise. It will be like wearing a colored glass and therefore finding everything with the same color, which is just not true. SB had also told Renulal in a similar fashion. He said, “Asserting I am not the body - or asserting my present bodily self is my false self or my real self is God” is wrong. “This is also supposition, no truth in it. How do you know that your bodily self is your false self?” Again he had said, “Even the Vedas are the highest ignorance... One must find the Truth oneself.” In meditation therefore one should instead leave every conception behind and go naked to God in complete surrender. Only then God receives you, not otherwise! In this connection, it may be worthwhile to mention the talk of KD with SB, which was as follows: 25\n\nKD: Sir, when one prepares for sleep one should forget one’s learning, one’s belongings, etc, in fact the whole world including one’s wife sleeping beside you, should not one? Then at some stage one should even forget one’s body and just wait for sleep. One thus waits and waits for the sleep to come. Then, suddenly sleep comes from nowhere and one is swept away! In the same way, one must forget everything and wait and wait for God. And God comes in His time and one becomes realized! Is this not true? SB: Yes. It is so. It is so! To recapitulate: Thus one can see that SB considers Meditation as consisting mainly of 3 components, viz, “Dharana, Dhyana and Enquiry. The first two, Dharana & Dhyana combined with RL may be enough to take you to. God”, he once said. However, Enquiry is a must. Ramana Maharshi too emphasised on Enquiry but with a difference. The difference is that he did not prescribe RL as done by SB who says that without undergoing the Disciplines, one simply cannot go to God. By following the first two disciplines he says, your Intellect will-be perfected and your Mind will be tamed. Then only your Soul can meditate properly. Without doing this your Enquiry will not be sustained; as a result of which your meditation will not bear fruit. This is for the general seekers. But there may be a few exceptions although very rare, and which cannot therefore usually be emulated. For example, RM could succeed only because of his intense Distaste of life (Vairagya). This was also present in the Buddha. However, what Krishna prescribed to his friend, Arjun, was this RL, a path created by God when He created Man for, “by performing one’s duty or living RL alone one can reach God, and this RL He prescribed for all people: “Swadharmya Tam Abhyarchya Samsiddhim Labhate Narah”. How To Look At The World? Dr. PT Gorkha, one devotee, kindly gave me his Notes On Talks With Shivapuri Baba in which he mentioned how a RL student should look at the world. The substance runs as follows: When one looks, for example, at a tree, one says, “I am looking at a tree”. In fact, one is looking at an Existence which has no name. (Actually “naming things hides the Truth”, SB said somewhere; “and all knowledge - relative knowledge - is name - imposition only”). The name “tree” is given by us for practical purposes, for convenience only. Likewise the visible phenomenon (or Vyakta) we come across day by day, moment to moment, (SB calls it Differentiated Consciousness) and the invisible phenomenon (Avyakta) or the subtle world (SB calls this Undifferentiated Consciousness) are both Existence. And this Existence is the Body of God. In this context one may mention the talk with SB of an European Professor who argued that “whatever one observes or sees is the Truth and that there is nothing beyond this.” At this, pointing the gate of this Ashram SB replied, “You entered through that gate and came to see me. I did not see you before. “Now, after our meeting you will return through that gate again and will disappear from my sight. Do you mean to say that you will then exist no 26\n\nmore! In fact, after disappearing from that gate, you will walk around Kathmandu, go back to your hotel, return to your country, join your family, your office, do hundreds of work and so on. How then you can say that you exist no more? In the same way, there are many things, though invisible; and on the top of that, there is Something, the Source, from which all these things - visible or invisible - come to exist. That is the Truth.” Again, as Vashistha says in his Yoga Vashistha, this Existence is made of the same substance as God. But we are such that we believe it to be different from the original and give it our own conceptions and names! We therefore mislead ourselves and as a result move away from the Truth. How to know the Truth then? Interestingly this question is also asked by Dr. Gorkha to SB. Let me quote: Q. A.\n\nSir, How to know the Truth? By Realization... Suppose an unknown person comes to you. You ask him two questions:\n\n1) Who are you? And, 2) What for you have come here? Similarly, to know the truth or One’s Self one should ask two questions: 1) Who am I? And, 2) What for have I come here? To know this one must meditate and then attain Realization. “But there is the external world that interferes, for example, hunger, thirst etc. So in order to attain Realization one has got to protect oneself against these interferences. For this, four things are essential — meals, clothes, home and wife or distaste for life or Vairagya. Thus we have to defend ourselves against the Lower world and then fight i.e, think of God and meditate for Realization, viz. defend and Fight!” Q. Then after Realization, is it the end? A. No. That is a mistake. People think that after God-Vision that is the end of everything. Actually, only then, Life begins! It may be useful to talk about Meditation here as to how SB answered to Dr. Gorkha regarding this. This may sound repetitious; but in the Spiritual Science one should understand that repetition is very necessary. Q. Tell me something about Meditation. A. Meditation is Enquiry. During meditation “I” should be preserved till one gets the experience. On the contrary, people think that when you lose the consciousness and get the Bliss - Nirvikalpa Samadhi - you have reached the end. No. You must have the subject, object and predicate viz, “Who am I?”\n\n27\n\nAnd remember, while meditating you should know the following: “There are Body, Mind, Soul, Consciousness and Sleep. Mind should be dismissed. Complete concentration of Soul will automatically bring about forgetfulness of Body. You then fall into a sort of sleep; but this is not sleep. Consciousness should be there - consciousness and concentrated Soulwanted for Meditation. Now, having practiced this, there should be Constant Agitation for seeing God. “When you become established in this and become mature spiritually, He then will give you His Grace by lifting the screen before you. You will thus get the God-Vision! “But mind you, concentration without agitation for God-Vision is for selfhappiness only, because (in this) a balanced equilibrium is alone established; but you do not see God here. For God-Vision, this equilibrium should be broken, i.e., there should be Constant Agitation for God; and there should be also Patient Waiting to see when does He come - like a passenger waiting at the railway platform for the train to come. Without this agitation you lose yourself in the deep meditation only and thus everything is spoilt.” But men do not seek God, they seek the world, and spoil the life which is so kindly given to him by God. Hugh Ripman in his Travel Diary speaks of this, when he talked with SB: HR: Why is it that some men seek God and some do not? SB: Men do not seek GOD because they are drawn by pleasure... The Soul of man is the real “I”. This cannot be explained, it can only be experienced!” Consciousness & Superconsciousness SB: In the normal state of Consciousness we live, like fish, in water. We live inside this “water” of consciousness. But there is Something which is beyond this, Something which lies above the level of this Consciousness. That is God or Superconsciousness. If somehow or other we lift our heads above this “water” we see God. RL is the way to achieve this. Conclusion: Whatever the Teachings, Shivapuri Baba always stressed on the Practice rather than on its Theory. Even the understanding of RL, he says, becomes clear only when you put in practice what you have learnt theoretically. As Hugh Ripman says, it is only when you live out your idea, you understand it properly. What about the scriptures, the Sastras, then? Are not they useful or necessary at all for the seeker? They are, SB answers. But they have their limitations because they are like a road map only. Moreover you must navigate yourself, you must walk the path yourself to reach your destination. However, if you are lucky and have a Guru, this map can be dispensed with. Because then the Guru will act as your map and your guide combined together. If he is a Realized Guru then half the journey is already finished! Such a Guru knows not only how to teach but also when to teach, how much to teach and when not to teach at all! It may sound cruel when he does not teach his pupil! However the fact may be entirely opposite, i.e. the Guru is 28\n\nvery kind, but the pupil may not be ripe for the teaching. In view of the nature of his special circumstance, letting him go on his own for certain time, may actually accelerate his progress! If you interfere him at such a stage he may even undergo retardation: he may stop walking, and he may even take to another path, a wrong one. In other words not only there is a danger of spoon-feeding which stops inner growth of the pupil but also the “young plant” may even die due to too much “manure!” On the other hand, left to himself, he may undergo much suffering which may even break his heart. But the Guru alone knows whether or not his pupil needs this. Importance of Guru: For living RL, SB says, “Only a Guru and a serious Student alone may suffice. The Scriptures may prove hindrance rather than a help. Furthermore the pupil may lose himself in the jungle of words, doubts and uncertainties, pulling or pushing him into opposite directions! This danger accentuates more for a “well-read” pupil than for a relatively ignorant one. In fact, according to SB, it is better to be less read and even ignorant for such a spiritual enterprise provided he has great Faith on his Guru. As a matter of fact Faith is the real or the only Guide when you submit yourself to the Spiritual Discipline. “If you have full Faith on your Guru,” he says, “Even if he is not God-Realized, there is no harm. God, being Allknowing and All-powerful and All-kindness, will come in the form of his Guru and guide him rightly when necessary!” The other important factors which accelerate the progress of the seeker are: 1. Patience of Waiting 2. Effort like that of the proverbial bird who attempted to dry the 3. Determination like that of Dhruva which sustains him in his struggleperiod; no matter how long or how tiresome and difficult it may be! This is what is known as one’s Purushartha really. God is in fact in search of these qualities in the seeker. If He is satisfied with these only, then He considers the possibility, of His Grace. And without this nothing is possible, least of all the God-Vision or the Truth. To earn this Grace the seeker must have extreme Bhakti or God-Love. He must also be in a state of great agitation for His revelation (Darshan), failing which he may be willing to even die at any moment if this is required! SB calls this Loving Insistence. Only when he has developed such an intensity of God-Love, he will be in a suitable position to “penetrate the smoky darkness or Avarna. However, it is God who will decide when He will give His Grace and lift the Veil. Therefore practice of RL is wanted; and this is what the Struggle is really. “God wants you to struggle”, SB says, and this is what a RL student must do as a duty. Whether to pass you or not in your struggle depends entirely upon Him. If He is pleased with you, He can pass you any moment. That is why you must beware of your despondency during your struggle period because this may retard or even bring your downfall. One can therefore see that doing your duty and pining for God is all that you can do. And this act or submission to Him is called Surrender. It is God who will do the needful in the end! 29\n\nPart – II The Right Life As Taught by Sri Shivapuri Baba Man’s original nature is to remain in Bliss, which, in other words, is the joy of life. But owing to wrong living he has degraded and has lost that bliss. When closely analyzed, this joy of life or bliss consists of the three ingredients viz. Peace, Serenity and Pleasure. The discriminative part of the Right Life as taught by the Shivapuri Baba aims at re-establishing man’s position in relation to the three end-points viz. Peace, Serenity and Pleasure (or Sukha, Santosh and Shanti in inverse order). By practicing the Three Disciplines, man can establish himself in his original blissful state. This state is what is carried forward and upward by Dharma, Artha and Kama, according to the Hindu conception. Moksha, which means liberation from this bondage of life, is optional. One may take, remain enjoying this bliss of life as long as he is not satiated with it. But, of course, it is implied that he retains discriminative non-attachment to it. However, if he arrives at a stage when he thinks that this joy of life which he has been enjoying is conditioned and it is still a kind of bondage and if he wants to get completely out of it, he can do that also easily. The capability is there in him, when he is well established in the Three Disciplines. In this case, the Devotional Aspect, of the Right Life as taught by the Shivapuri Baba should be given predominance. This is what is called Vairagya (which means distaste for life and longing for God) in the Hindu terminology. Discrimination (Viveka) as envisaged in the Three Disciplines and Vairagya (love of God) are the two aspects of the Right Life. These two are like the obverse and reverse of the same coin. When one likes to remain enjoying this bliss of life, he is said to have given more emphasis to the Discriminative Aspect of the Right Life and when he wants to get out of the bondage of life, he is said to have given more emphasis to the Devotional Aspect of the Right Life. In either case, both discrimination and devotion as termed by the Shivapuri Baba to give a name to the Right Life (which in Hindu terminology is called Viveka and Vairagya) are there in the practice of the Right Life, the only difference being in the emphasis given to the one or the other, which is subject to one’s choice. Here Krishna and the Buddha may be cited as good examples. Desire for enjoyment in a grosser manner is the root cause of taking to life. Man’s soul, which is called Purusha, according to the Hindu terminology, developed a primal desire to enjoy living with a body. He is then called Kshetrajna (in place of Purusha) in relation to his body (Kshetra). This state is called Pravritti (evolution) and when this Kshetrajna wants to go back to his original state as Soul or Purusha, he is said to have taken to Nivritti (involution) or turning back. So there are two different ways of living viz. Pravritti and Nivritti. In the Right Life, as taught by the Shivapuri Baba, both these ways of living are synchronized or combined, giving full choice for the one or the other to be given predominance, depending on the inherent 30\n\ntendency of the man in question. The three end-points of Peace, Serenity and Pleasure as aforesaid are virtually like antidotes for the three kinds of suffering as described in the Shastras viz. Fear, Worries and Pain, the Tribidha Tap as they are called, the three-fold miseries. The opposite of pain is pleasure, the opposite of worries is serenity and that of fear is peace. The physical or intellectual discipline as taught by the Shivapuri Baba aims at establishing Pleasure as opposed to Pain, the mental or moral discipline at establishing Serenity as opposed to Worries and the spiritual discipline at establishing Peace as opposed to Fear. Buddha is, therefore, sometimes criticized for his commitment that life is suffering. What is life? It is suffering in one sense but also an enjoyment in another sense. A man who is well established in the Three Disciplines enjoys full happiness or bliss in life and to live life, apparently, is enjoyment. Buddha is therefore only partially right in arguing that life is suffering. Buddha’s original teaching was constructed on that hypothesis. Right Life is constructed on a different basis. It does not say whether life is suffering or enjoyment. It is meant for both types of people, viz. thisworldly (Pravritti) and the other-worldly (Nivritti). Both can make use of it. By establishing the Three Disciplines, you may remain enjoying because in that case you will enjoy life (either gross or subtle or most subtle) discriminately with your full knowledge and responsibility whether you are in involution or evolution, which is left to your choice. In other words, you will never come to clash with others’ interests or, for that matter, with any breach of Dharma. The law of life is well maintained. The word Dharma in its general sense implies this maintaining of the law of life. Artha and Kama are corollaries to this Dharma. It therefore follows that Right Life brings to man Dharma, Artha and Kama, all three together. The nature of these three attainments is Peace, Serenity and Pleasure. This stage of Right Life is not godless as the non-understanding might suppose. This stage is called LifeRealization or World-Realization or Self-Realization. Physical or intellectual discipline takes the predominant part in this. The next stage is to refine this enjoyment, which is called Soul-Realization where moral discipline takes a predominant part. The last is called like God-Realization in which our enjoyment gets the maximum refinement. God, the Ultimate Truth, is realized which means God plus cent percent perfection in bliss. In the first stage our enjoyment of Peace. Serenity and Pleasure is gross when compared to the second and the third stages. As we go higher, our enjoyment of the three (viz. Peace, Serenity and Pleasure) gets more and more refined. This is so because in the Right Life as taught by the Shivapuri Baba the Three Disciplines plus Meditation or longing for God is recommended from the very beginning. Right Life is Discrimination and Devotion both combined. So SB sometimes explains Right Life in terms of Discrimination and Devotion. If you are in Right Life without love of God (or devotion), you may get into 31\n\nindulgence of the worldly or evoluted aspect of life, which means that your enjoyment will be like that of a king or emperor in the first stage where physical or intellectual discipline takes the predominant part (Gaddi). If you are in Right Life without love of God (or devotion) in the second stage where moral discipline is predominant, you get powers like Siddhi (or the different Siddhis as they are called) if you are in the Right Life without love of God (or devotion). You get the bliss of Samadhi (Samadhi). If longing for God (or devotion) is taken up as the common factor from the very beginning, you will not get involved in such indulgences as described, because the fact of meditation (or devotion) implies the perfect retention in all the three stages of what the S.B. has called Discrimination and Devotion, which the Gita calls ‘non-attachment’. In other words, there is no liability to confusion between the means and the end, which is God, at any of the three stages. In this interpretation of the Right Life by the Shivapuri Baba, God is immanent in each of the three stages, the only difference being in the proportion of God as we rise up in the sequence. If we may bring a commercial term into such a high discussion, God-percentage increases as we rise into the higher stages from the minimum to the maximum. Let us now summarize Right Life in the SB’s own words: \"The sum and substance of my teaching is this: live the minimum life possible, subjecting body and mind to strict discipline. Again, how a hungry man longs for food, how a man suffering from intense cold longs for heat, so long for God, meditate on Him continuously”. N.B. Those who are interested in a fuller explanation of the Right Life are referred to the book, “Long Pilgrimage” by J.G. Bennett in collaboration with Thakurlal Manandhar, published by Hodder and Stoughton, London.\n\n32\n\nB. From The Divine Heights of Shivapuri A Necessity for a Seeker: 1.\n\nFor A Man Who tries to attain Spiritual Growth, to obtain that complete Happiness and Freedom which liberated souls enjoy, a Special Course of Practice, under a competent guide, is a vital necessity. Without proper guidance, men generally follow the teachings of our ancient Hindu Scriptures, do this and do that, and lose themselves in the midst of contradictory ideas. Thus, a spiritual aspirant has to confront many setbacks, and without an experienced Guru, who is himself a Realized Soul, he cannot hope for an all-round growth, a harmonious blending of his own being, so as to make himself fitted to realize the Ultimate Truth and Knowledge, which can be known and realized by one’s own personal experience. As the saying goes, “Where there is a will, there is a way”, an earnest aspirant naturally gets such a Guru, and he will be liberated in due course.\n\n2.\n\nA Beginner Should, first of all, bring out his latent forces, the human faculties, his own birthright. For, how being a decrepit himself, he can hope to be a candidate for “Divine Heights?” This part of study is primary, but at the same time most vital, and requires proper guidance. When this is completed, he will be a responsible man or a master of himself. According to our Hindu School, a beginner’s activity should be encircled within the austerities (Yama, Niyama) & R.L. (Swadharma) only. In other words, a fixed routine of daily life, with fixed items of duties, is required. That is, a certain code of life, is to be accepted, and he should always abide by the Laws & Principles pertaining thereto, even at the risk of his own life. For an would-be aspirant, the following treatise with every detail, will be most helpful: The Austerities (Yasyan, Daana, & Tapah) Under the above three headings, our activities are to be classified. Yagyans should be daily performed. It is a means to acquire Discriminative Wisdom. Daana (Charity) is for gaining Strength. Wisdom and Strength both should be applied to our activities of life; this comes under Tapasya. This Course of Training is for making ourselves deserve the Higher Spiritual Potentialities. A propaganda is made for gaining all-round and harmonious mixture of our human qualities; a discriminative or equable wisdom, Vyabashatmikaa Buddhi, is gained: the aspirant rises above the relative truths. Footnotes: Our duties can be changed according to our time & our own circumstances. But at the same time they are not changed altogether or replaced. There should be a knack or tactics which can be brought about by three ways or means. If we have the power of endurance, we can follow the duties literally, but at the same time we should not be rash. We should admit our defeat in doing them literally, and try to maintain them by means of the wealth which 33\n\nis at our disposal; or we should use our wisdom to make slight changes in time or in some other way to suit our particular circumstances. In this latter case, one is one’s own master. An equable wisdom is wanted or else he is liable to commit mistakes or breach of faith. 3. Ego & Austerities Ego is like silt deposited by running water in a gutter--it comes with life naturally. To see the hidden surface of the gutter underneath, the silted mud should be daily removed. So, to neutralize the effect of this ego and the true nature of our inner self, we are enjoined to perform the austerities (Yagyan, Daana & Tapasyaa) Owing to this ego, which is like silt-coating, the true nature of our soul is veiled. The effort on our part to remove this ego, i.e. to counteract its relation with our life, is Yagyan, Daana & Tapasyaa. A piece of iron thrown in the weather naturally gets rusted. We should apply a certain wisdom to prevent this. PERFECTION & EGO: There are 3 Schools with their Theories: 1) Adwaitin - In the beginning, we were perfect. We came down and took this life in fancy; and with this life we have this ego, which has kept us in the dark, as to our own real nature. We should try by the way of Yagyan, Daana & Tapasyaa, and in the end, we will get the perfection again. 2) Vishistadwaitin - In the beginning we were as imperfect as at present. Through Yagyan, Daana & Tapasyaa we will get perfection. 3) Dvaitin - As Absolute we were perfect, but as we carne down to- the relative plane, we have become imperfect, and in the end, we again go to the Absolute perfection, through Yagyan. Daana & Tapasyaa. But a wise man will not allow himself to be involved in these controversial statements. He is concerned only with the state of complete freedom & happiness, which is beyond the standard of perfection and imperfection. The common factor, i.e. the practice of Yagyan, Daana & Tapah only, will be counted by him, rejecting all speculative enquiries. And moreover these theories of perfection and imperfection are useless or groundless. P.S. - Perfection in a relative plane can become imperfection in the Absolute sense. For example, our eyes are perfect as long as they maintain themselves, but as compared with sight (their Absolute sense) they are imperfect. Thus the same becomes perfect and imperfect also at one and the same time. Therefore in perfection there is imperfection, and in imperfection there is perfection. The Truth cannot be called as either of these. If it is perfect, imperfection is understood and vice versa. 4. Peace Of Mind - Life. Religion, the object and the work as a whole: Example - Keeping the flowers: Maintaining the flowers is the object in view; the arrangement` or the propaganda made, i.e. spending a fixed amount of money, a fixed labour or effort to be spent in a fixed time, is the religion. The work as a whole is life, a successful one or a failure. 34\n\nAdwaitins - If the object in view comes all right up to our required standard, the religion or our life both come in automatically. So the object only (viz. Peace of mind) is to be kept. Thus much importance is given to the object only. Dwaitins - Religion is the most important, without which the object in view cannot be brought about. Vishistaadwaitins - Both are equally important. With either of them only, the other may not necessarily come all right. But for a wise man, the theories of all the 3 Schools are incorrect. If the object only is kept in view, our propaganda is overlooked; the object cannot be maintained to the required standard. Also if religion or propaganda only is maintained, the object may be absent from required maintenance. Again, if both are maintained, then too, the maintenance up to our satisfaction may be a failure. The 5 causes come in between-Fate or God, Time, Place, Circumstances & Praying to God (Daivabidhi). 5. Pleasures And Pains - attract our attention, and we feel happiness or unhappiness. But this happiness or unhappiness has no real meaning if we pry deep into it. In a Gross Income we do not feel full confidence or stability of mind as in a Net Income. So, in experiencing these pairs of opposite forces, the stability of mind effected in us by a Net Income is wanting. A faint voice, though we cannot heed it, is there inside us, predicting that there are equal pain is lurking underneath. There are no assurances of real happiness. Our mind is only agitated or turmoiled. In the depth of our feelings we feel as though we are stretched like a piece of rubber. A thoughtful man naturally tries to come to a happy settlement, i.e. to maintain a balanced state of his mental attitudes. When we are occupied in our normal duties, if something unusual happens, we at once take to pleasure or pain, love or hatred. P.S. - Nothing is perfect. Everything has got some defect. In short, nothing can give’ us full satisfaction. People are of opinion that perfection is impossible. But, according to wise people, there is perfection. Perfection can be had, if we can maintain always the Universal Law or God. 6. The World Beyond: There is a vast difference, we find, in knowing a thing and in having it. Knowledge of a thing is not necessarily the realization of it. For example, we know there is such a country as England, which is so and so. But this knowledge alone is of no use at all, when we want to realize it. So, for a real aspirant after Truth, the simple knowledge of it alone does no good. For, such a knowledge we can have from the writings of the great thinkers of the world, the Vedas and Upanishads. But, let us assume we have gone through all of them and gained the knowledge of the thing in question, does this mean that we have realized it? We have done what we can for gaining knowledge. Still we cannot get ourselves satisfied. Still we can assume that there is something beyond. Still there is this longing for the beyond. Really, we will create in ourselves an enterprising spirit to launch on the campaign. Leaders of thought there are many, each preaching his own system of procedure. Whom to believe? We become puzzled as to the immediate step. 35\n\nAdwaitins say, “Leave off this love for life and plunge headstrong into the musings with the soul within us, thus emphasising the necessity of complete renunciation of the world outside. But how can that be for all and sundry? We find there is something in this outside surrounding, if not, what is it all? Our life at every moment demands something or other from the outside. It will always be pricking. Something unpleasant there is in this-mode of life. After all, this theory is not at all intelligent with regard to its practicability. Again Dwaitins: they advise quite the opposite: This is all they say - this life and its enjoyments in the material world. “Live and enjoy” is their motto... All right, let us assume, we take to living and enjoying. Does this make us satisfied? The objects we enjoy are not always with us. They come and go - enjoying sometimes, suffering sometimes. No stability is assured of that too. How can we go on and take this mode of life? It is not at all reasonable, we find. Thus there are many schools of thought or reasonableness. Truth they have remodeled in their own pattern. The only exposition of Truth or Knowledge as it is, we can find only in the Vedas. They try to give us some knowledge or understanding of what we see and hear in this world, as lucidly as possible. What is to be admired most is that they do neither forcibly thrust on us like the thinkers aforesaid, any creed or doctrine, nor they ever advise us not to have such a creed also. They simply expose knowledge and allow us to go on as we like. Here, in these Vedic Teachings, we find sufficient reasonableness in as much as we can take any course to suit our personal capacity. But as we are, we are beginners, so to say, and can have only knowledge as set therein and will yet be puzzled. One Spiritual Guide or Guru to reveal to us the real impressions of these teachings is a vital necessity. He will make us fully aware of the real import - a revelation of the Divine Secret. A life in complete consonance with Yagyan, Daana, Tapasyaa is the best and most reasonable also. Our life outside is then well-settled. There will be no more disturbing from life. Then seek for the Beyond, think of the Lord, our Supreme Goal, with a real agitation inside us, with a real yearning’ from the inmost recesses of our hearts... A piece of Iron is drawn towards the magnet. This world and all is tempting us as by a magnet, and if we allow it, we are doomed. But if some orange juice or something is poured over the magnet, its action is neutralised. So also Yagyan, Daana & Tapasyaa is such a thing which will neutralise the effect of this world-temptation. A systematic and definite Course there is for complete 36 years: 12 years for studying Life and knowing one’s own Self; (and then) to maintain it 12 years and Striving after God-Realization. Cultivating the 26 Qualities, both Offensive & Defensive, for 12 years. Life has many different functions. A regular Timetable for each function should be made. Regularity & Punctuality in this daily routine is necessary. Each function is governed by a certain law. A practical application of all the 26 Qualities in each function brings one to the realization of the Law and the Truth. The fixed functions or duties must bind one according to the timetable. No extra duties other than these should steal away one’s energy or 36\n\nvital forces. All the different functions as a whole should work so as to attain the common good. Not one of them should go fruitless or out of the way. By daily observance, one can come to know the functions going out of the way and can improve the efficiency till one comes to a definite standard of life. Then there will be no inferiority in anything. How do you practice? Well, the following outline is suggested Cleanliness - bedding should be neat and clean: No Agitation -nothing should disturb when going to bed. No Speculation; Calmness; Concentration on Om; Burning Incense, etc. for good smelling. Keep secret anything which concerns your own personal freedom, do not tell anyone what you are doing, but at the same time, you must have plan so as to avoid conflict and suspicion from other people (i.e. Crookedness to abide by the Guru’s Will and at the same time Frankness towards’ others) so that they may not suspect you. The utmost secret as well as care is required. Follow Guru’s advice at any rate whenever your personal liberty allows. When a regular Speed is gained in working out the Routine, the 26 Qualities should be taken out for practice along with it, one by one, in order. When the Speed is gained, the first part in the struggle is gained. Obstacles or difficulties may come, but we should never yield, even at the cost of our own life. A tug of war with our mind is there always. When we do not yield we are dragging the mind with greater force; but the mind will not retreat soon. It will be defeated gradually in due course. But we should go on with our duties. The question of time only remains; the day is sure to come. Now, in the beginning, we should take refuge in the Timetable; cling to that at any cost. Then in due course, we will come to discard off all undesirable or useless activities; thereby we will get ourselves refined and achieve a refined wisdom. Then it will be put forth to gain further posts...Our beginning is therefore a Systematic or Scientific Process of refinement of our wisdom. Stick to one’s Principles, never changing Principles For The Whole Life. Remember: We cannot get wisdom directly. Virtue is the stepping-stone. What is Virtue? It consists in a proper practice of our daily routine of duties - fixed and force duties of life (Nitya & Naimittik Karmas) - exactly according to the Law governing them. Virtue in its real sense is a serious and strenuous sticking to duties. Going against the Law, taking light of the duties, or failure to work on the daily functions, is Vice. COMMANDING & CONTROLLING POWERS: All human activities should comprise these 2 forces in order to be termed real. One should have a good command over all the necessary materials. All great men of the world had good Commanding Power in more or less degree, but no Controlling Power to make their actions real. For example, Napoleon, MK Gandhi and other great men of all ages - they had earned the commanding quality to an extraordinary extent, but sorry to say, they failed miserably to control it, i.e. to use it properly in their own particular field of action, in order to gain a real success. One should, according to one’s circumstances in life, possess the commanding power as well as the controlling power, to gain real things. 37\n\nFor our particular case, we should have a real command over the forces within us first; and control them, so as to use them in our particular sphere of activities. These 2 powers are reflected in this manner. Our sticking to our particular daily routine with fixed duties, fixed time and fixed principles, calls forth this commanding power. But, with simply this alone no real success is possible. We should have to control this power to an extent required for our particular ideal, and use it. This controlling power is to be reflected in our case like this. When we have been able to command ourselves with fixed duties, fixed time and fixed principles, this power will be controlled when applied in conjunction with the 26 Qualities, Daivi Sampad. The Controlling Power or the application of these qualities means a Definite Success to attain Reality. THE FURTHER STEP: When The First Step, i.e. adherence to our daily routine of time table, is finally established, one should slowly add further duties, viz. austerities (Yagya, Daana, Tapah). These 3 are vitally necessary as fields of action for an enthusiastic aspirant. (I) Sacrifice (Yagyans) in details These are five: 1) Brahma Yagyan - Snaana, Dhyana, Pooja, Paatha, Brata etc. 1) Study: from Gods, their specific qualities. Bring out the sense of responsibility and Vigilance never failing. 2) Bath (Snaana) as prescribed. 3) Concentration (Dhyana) of a single idea. 4) Worship/ Recitation (Poojaa) of an idol or (Paatha) of any Scriptures. 5) Visit to Holy Places (Teertha) according to (Sattwik) injunctions. 6) Vow. (Brata) - observing fasts periodically. Perform these with a keen sense of responsibility and vigilance, to avoid failures on our part with a Sattwik Temperament Always. With the same mood we should practice daily with the same Hankering After Perfection to a given standard. 2) Rishi Yagyan - Service to Guru (Gurusewaa) & Satsang: In doing this, the qualities expected spring forth automatically by the Grace of Guru. He points out our defects and gives inspiration, ultimately to give rise to a Sattwik temperament. From this activity we bring out and cultivate Virtue - the 26 Qualities in a skillfully harmonized proportion. Real knowledge springs from this. This part of duty is the main incentive to a higher realization of our being. 3) Pitri Yagyan - Gratefulness & Regard. Sacrificing something for our deceased ancestors with the sense of gratefulness for what they had done to us. This part of activity is solely for arousing in us this sense of gratitude. 4) Manushya Yagyan - Sacrificing for our fellow-being. Helping our friends: Hospitality; Daily feeding a relative or a poor man; Helping the needful; “Do unto others what you will others do unto you”. This sort of sacrifice is of immense help for us in this life. Our circumstantial difficulties can be greatly reduced as a return. 5) Bhoota Yagyan - Sacrifice for all living creatures: Feeding a cow or a dog. 38\n\nSympathy and kindness to be shown in our daily dealings with them. Their specific qualities should be appreciated. Lastly, Regard is a qualification to be possessed from the beginning to the end (Sraddhaa & Bhakti). (II) Daana - Charity and Lawful Activity. Daanam - Charity to a spiritualist, to a learned man and to the poor-Charity through Mind, Soul and Action. (III) Tapah - Severe austerity; sticking to our plan of action at any risk or cost. Tapah involves 2 kinds of activities-subtle and gross: 1) Through Mind - checking the mind when it wants to go outside our appointed course of duties, to retain its normal state, i.e. not to be influenced by emotions, agitations, etc. like Kaama, Krodha, Mada, Moha, Lobha, i.e. Lust, Anger, Pride, Infatuation, Greed etc. 2) Through Wisdom - To be aware of the bad wisdom which brings failure; to see which of the Qualities (26) are wanting in the wisdom applied.\n\n1. 2. 3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n\nCONCERNING DIET: A seeker should become vegetarian and should restrict himself with the following diet. Rice (fine) best and easily digestible; rice as Marsi & Tauli give only strength. Daal - Moog, Ratear, Chanaa of which Moong is the best. Maas to be taken only as Baaraa at daytime. Vegetables: Methi & Paalung - best amongst greens; Ramtoriyaa, Teeto Karailaa, Ghiraulaa best. Cucumber, Gourd, Potatoes etc. to be taken only in their proper seasons. For Nepal, in the autumn season, any of then can be taken but in very little quantity (in Aswin & Kartik) Preparation - to be done in cow’s ghee - the best. No oil, no meat. Satwik Preparation. Spices - Jeeraa (not predominant), Mareech (mild), Daalchini, Lwaang (very little), Soontho instead of Aduwaa, Dhaniyan, No chilly. Sindhe Noon (Rock salt) - the best. All cow’s products – ghee, butter, milk, curd - best; Curd to be taken only at daytime (not in the evening); curd and ghee should not be taken together or mixed. Bread - Jilebi only (homemade). Fruits – Lemon, Orange, Plantain (Maalpu), if possible. When the seeker restricts himself to such a satwick diet and lives RL he will be able to open the letter lock. The lock opens the Gate to the Realization of the Highest Reality. For this the Soul, Mind and Intellect, all 3, should be made Satwik. In practice, one or other of them may go wrong; and the Lock, which opens the Gate to the Realization of the Highest Reality- Soul, Mind and Intellectthe mystery of the mysteries -remains unopened. The Soul-Force and the Mind-Force should be made Satwik, and also the Intellect. The knowledge of Karma (avoiding Akarma & Vikarma) will make the Intellect perform the Satwik action. (Vide Gita III).\n\n39\n\nWisdom & Desire God has sent Wisdom with you; wisdom is your friend. This Wisdom plays with Desire and by their unlawful contact, they give birth to Mind, who marries a girl named Restlessness (Clapalataa), giving birth to the 5 Senses. This Mind marries again another wife, called Hope (Aashaa) giving birth to 2 Sons, anger (Krodh) and greed (Lobha). Thus a family is set up; and they make a home-to live in this body (Deha). This unlawful playing of Wisdom & Desire is Avidyaa. In course of time the Mind experiences Fears & Anxieties through the 5 Senses his Sons, becomes distracted and turns back to his Mother, Wisdom, and cries for help. Wisdom then comes to You (the Soul) to consult, who tells her to renounce the family and to remain in communion with you. This communion with Soul is Enlightenment (Bodha). By Wisdom a man sees the one fundamental Unity in all created things (unity in diversity) i.e. going to the essence of things. One who has got this equable frame of mind always has got this Satwik Wisdom. A Satwik Action is doing one’s fixed duties regularly according to Law, without fail, with neither attachment nor hatred to it and without any desire or interest as to the fruit thereto. A man, without attachment to anything-no feeling of pride in his work, with steadfastness of purpose and without being affected in the least by the success or failure arising out of his work, is Satwik. He has a clear view and right discrimination of things and (resolute) self-control. Thus, with a Satwik Wisdom, Satwik Temperament and Satwik Action combined, one should go on with his life’s duties. Naturally, he will cultivate and acquire the necessary Commanding & Controlling Powers both. This going on with life will be as easy as anything to him, as he becomes more and more used to it. He will then see Life, Truth or God, face to face. What is Life? How Can We Come Face to Face with it? Like young boys you are playing with toys. You have not taken your responsibility of a grown-up man. So it is with Life. You have not come face to face with it. You have become so-called “worldly”. You are after worldly pleasures and pursuits, sharing your joys and sorrows out of them. In short, you are so indulged in them that you are completely shut off with regard to Life. Stop your tendency to them for a while and think-you will surely find the Truth therein. Some say, “Life is a mystery”. Verily it is so, if we make idiotic question to it, as to why and how it came into being. Let its existence be granted, and let us see its real aspect. Above all your near and dear ones, your personal hobbies and all others, Life is most important. It is a dear possession, dearer than your wife and children; it has no price. Even priceless jewels amounting to all the wealth of the world cannot compensate for its loss. What is this? - This love for life? It is so important that we cannot stop pouring our heartiest blessings for it. But at the same time, if we look to the other side of it, it is a curse, a wretched thing, a vilest bondage, which we have no power to dispense with... See, what sorts of troubles and turmoil’s we have continually to undergo as obligations to it! - he-ass following a she-ass, with joyful and amorous feelings!, but in return, he gets blows after blows instead, all the time and yet he persists! So we are with 40\n\nLife. Hunger, thirst and all, and above all, our utmost anxiety to retain its possession, are forcibly imposed upon us. Verily, a self-respecting man would not follow in its wake, when he gets blows after blows from it. He thinks why he should care for it at all... Thus, we find inconsistency (in life) with twofold aspects. You Have 3 Lives: 1) Life of Intuition (Aadhyaatmik) 2) Life of Reason (Aadhidaivik) and 3) Life of Instinct (Aadibhautik) How can we face life? By God-worship: The methodology, the technique is the following: 1) Pranayam - Simple in the beginning. 2) Meditation on Mahat with the sense beyond. 3) Recitations - to cultivate real devotion to the Lord with the sense of a son or a servant or a wife etc. etc. 4) Bath 5) A neat room - incense-burning, flower offering, intense devotion, well seated in Sukhaasana. 6) Bhakti, Sraddhaa, Bhaavanaa: Thought or Consciousness Vigilance Sense of responsibility Reverence & Love Sympathy & Love All these make a compact, a solid work, a success. 7) Yama, Niyama & Swadharma - the Code of Life. Sacrifices (YAGYANs) are the business of the Soul - these bring Peace (Shanti). It may be interesting to know something about the creation which involves 3 Modes or Gunas as follows: PROCESS OF CREATION: 1) From Satwa - Sources of Life for the Senses or Indriyas viz. Sun, Moon, Aswini, Vaayu, Indra, Varuna, etc. 2) From Rajas - Mona. China, Buddhi Ahankaara & the 10 Senses or Indriyas. 3) From Tamas - 5 Essentials & 5 Materials, viz. Sound - Ether or Sky (Hearing). Touch - Air (Knowing). Form - Fire or Light (Resolving). Taste - Water (Liking) Smell - Earth (Realising). 41\n\nSupreme Wisdom in the Light of Right Living Whatever we do in this world it is through our Intellect. It is like an instrument (Karana). We are solely guided by this, we are blindly following it. If it is wrong it will lead us to troubles. That is why the necessity arose for us to perform Gayatri daily, meaning thereby to pray this Intellect not to lead us astray. It is a separate entity like mind and the different senses or Indriyas within us. It is to be worshipped like a God. As a barber daily sharpens his razor blade so as to make it well-working, and thus to avoid troubles, so, as an art of sharpening or making fit, this Intellect is a vital necessity for one who wants to avoid every trouble. This Intellect, which we speak of, i"
