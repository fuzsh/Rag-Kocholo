        "text": "Architectural history shows that there has been an inspiration for the architectural marvels in the civilizations like Greek, Roman, Egyptian monuments. Historically, the Greek architecture has followed the Aegeans and later on influenced Roman architecture, the Persian architecture has influenced Indian architecture creating a new category of architecture as Mughal architecture. More so, various styles were developed by taking inspiration from preceding ones from various parts of the world. However, 'Inspiration' in Architecture is not limited to the superficial characteristics but includes much larger arena of factors like the philosophy, theory, concept, spiritual understanding and also ways it is manifested in the architectural form. India and SouthEast Asia has always been a topic of discussion for its resemblance in architectural forms. The paper focuses on how; historically; the architecture of South East Asia has been developed, by taking inspiration from Indian Architecture. This inspiration is much beyond the regular features of the structure and has an impact on the overall thought process of the builders and their creations. An exemplary Angkor Wat temple from Cambodia, which is the largest religious structure in the world and a world heritage site; shows a strong influence of Indian architecture, culture and social systems, which is considered as a marvel constructed from 1112 to 1152 AD, during the Reign of Suryavaraman-II. This paper is an attempt to examine the Indian architectural philosophy which must have inspired the Khmers from Cambodia to construct such unique and perfect piece of Architecture.\n\nLocal traditions govern temple architectural typologies; often, structural styles and building methods were progressively blended depending on congregation of experts and promotion of construction activity. While the texts enumerate many nuances in temple architectural styles, only about twenty-odd types dominate the landscape. Early natural caves and frescoed caverns, inspired by Buddhist prayer halls, evolved to rock-cut caves, which progressively incorporated iconographic objects and sculptures. The form evolved from simple, functional structures to imposing, magnificent buildings, which indicate progression of elaboration of and opulence in ritualsâ€• it reflects complexities in symbolism too. Local materials and influences determined regional preferences for designs, which evidence mutual inductance and overlapping of styles. This paper documents the diverse and numerous Hindu temple architecture styles based on not only the designs and traditions that are more recurrently featured in ancient texts, but also the exemplars and archetypes that are most commonly observed in ancient temple structures.\n\nThe Indian temple architecture depicts clearly their evolution, following the original ancient models, which were derived from religious consideration and this practice is further being followed, since many centuries. These temples are actually, the place of transcendence where man crosses over from world of illusion, to the world of truth. The main style of Hindu temple architecture in India had its modest beginning precisely from the Mauryan rule i.e 3rd century BC. The Indian Silpasastras recognize mainly three categories of the temple style, the Nagara, Dravida and Vesara, but there was also another style very prominent, known as the Kalinga style, which is very distinguished all over the world for their unique characteristics, that existed between 6th century A.D to 16th century A.D in Odisha. The aim of the paper is to describe the Kalinga style of architecture and the basic characteristics of the temples of this style, eventually concluding with interpretation of the plan forms of the temples, to be following a scientific and methodical path of evolution.\n\nHindu temple architecture is known from the earliest time in the world as per Hindu philosophy. Various ancient Hindu texts like Epics, Puranas, Vedas, Mayamata, Brihat Samhita, etc. inculcates the subject called Vastu. The key source for the Hindu temple architecture is derived from the magical geometry i.e. Vastupurusha Mandala. The structure of the temple building acts as a single human body. It is a metaphysical philosophy which deals beyond the reality. The Vastu plays a vital role during construction of temples and building structures. The formation of any ancient Indian structures is possible due to some guidance in terms of units which can be evaluated and fixed easily by the help of traditional system of measurement. The importance of traditional measurement unit is framed rigidly in the paper for understanding the geometry of the structures with better perception. The main objectives of the research paper are (1) to study the architectural geometry from its origin and its measurement unit, (2) to explore the evolution of Vastushastra and its types, (3) to analyse the interlinkages between the Vastupurusha Mandala with temple building and temple with Purusha (human being). Hence this research paper is a unique in its own way for describing the architectural design pattern of Hindu temples in a systematic manner. At last but not least the proposed findings and conclusion of the research paper based on the Vastushastra is that the evolution of the concerned ancient building structures can be easily determined on the basis of traditional measurement system. The magical diagram can be taken into account in various fields from architecture to planning level with sustainable approach. Through achieving the certain objectives help to depict the way of designing, constructing and planning any Hindu temple structures at present scenario in a confined manner."
