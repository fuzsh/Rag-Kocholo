May Lord Nrisimhadeva, roaring for His devotee, Prahlada Maharaja, protect us from all fear of dangers created by stalwart leaders in all directions through poison, weapons, water, fire, air, and so on. May the Lord cover their influence by His own transcendental influence.

You are the friend of all suffering humanity, and for great personalities it is necessary to show mercy to the foolish. Therefore, I think that you will show your causeless mercy to persons like us who engage in Your service.” (Bhag.7.9.42)\n\nom kraum narasimhaya namaha\n\nom ksaum namo bhagavate narasimhaya\n\njvala-maline dipta-damstrayagni-netraya\n\nsarva-raksho-ghnaya sarva-bhuta vinashaya\n\nsarva-jvara-vinashaya daha daha pacha pacha\n\nraksha raksha hum phat\n\n“Obeisances to the Lord Nrisimhaya, burning with His own scorching effulgence which are ablaze and whose eyes pour forth torrents of living fire, matched only by the glow of His glowing teeth.

May that Lord be kind enough to protect me in difficult places like the forest and battlefront.” (Srimad-Bhagavatam, 6.8.14)\n\nUgra-Nrisimha Dhyana\n\n(Meditation on the angry form of Lord Nrisimhadave)\n\nmimamsamanasya samutthito ‘grato\n\nnrisimha-rupas tad alam bhayanakam\n\npratapa-chamikara-chanda-lochanam\n\nsphurat sata-keshara-jrimbhitananam\n\nkarala-damstram karavala-chanchala\n\nkshuranta-jihvam bhrukuti-mukholbanam\n\nstabdhordhva-karnam giri-kandaradbhuta\n\nvyattasya-nasam hanu-bheda-bhishanam\n\ndivi-sprishat kayam adirgha-pivara\n\ngrivoru-vakshah-sthalam alpa-madhyamam\n\nchandramshu-gauraish churitam tanuruhair\n\nvishvag bhujanika-shatam nakhayudham\n\ndurasadam sarva-nijetarayudha-\n\npraveka-vidravita-daitya-danavam\n\n“Hiranyakashipu studied the form of the Lord, trying to decide who the form of Nrisimhadeva standing before him was. The Lord’s form was extremely fearsome because of His angry eyes, which resembled molten gold; His shining mane, which expanded the dimensions of His fearful face; His deadly teeth; and His razor-sharp tongue, which moved about like a dueling sword. His ears were erect and motionless, and His nostrils and gaping mouth appeared like caves of a mountain. His jaws parted fearfully, and His entire body touched the sky. His neck was very short and thick, His chest broad, His waist thin, and the hairs on His body as white as the rays of the moon. His arms, which resembled flanks of soldiers, spread in all directions as He killed the demons, rogues and atheists with His conchshell, disc, club, lotus and other natural weapons.” (Bhag.7.8.19-22)\n\nSri Nrisimha Pranama\n\n(from the Nrisimha Purana, offered by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu to Lord Jagannatha in Jagannatha Puri)\n\nnamas te narasimhaya\n\nprahladahlada-dayine\n\nhiranyakashipor vakshaha\n\nshila-tanka-nakhalaye\n\n“I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, Lord Nrisimhadeva.

Wherever I go Lord Nrisimha is there. He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Nrisimha, the origin of all things and the supreme refuge.”\n\nThe Nrisimha Gayatris\n\nOm Nrisimhaye vidmahe\n\nvajranakhaya dhimahi\n\ntan nah simhah pracodayat\n\n“Om. Let us think well aware of Nrisimha, the lightning-nailed. May the Lion promote our thought.”\n\nvajra nakhaya vidmahe\n\ntikshna damstraya dhimahi\n\ntan no narasimhah prachodayat\n\n“Let us meditate on He who is known as the possessor of nails as hard as thunderbolts and sharp teeth. Let us be enthused by Lord Narasimhadeva.”\n\nSri Nrisimha Maha-mantra\n\nugram viram maha-vishnum\n\njvalantam sarvato mukham\n\nnrisimham bhishanam bhadram\n\nmrityur mrityum namamy aham\n\n“I bow down to Lord Narasimha who is ferocious and heroic like Lord Vishnu. He is burning from every side. He is terrific, auspicious and the death of death personified.”\n\nIt is stated in Shastra that this mantra is the essence of all kavacha mantras, or mantras meant for wearing in a kavacha (capsule). The mantra is often written on a small piece of bark, such as from the botch tree. Then it is sealed in the capsule with a tulasi leaf or even flower petals that have been offered to the deity of Lord Narasimha. After worshipping the deity of Lord Narasimha with sixteen upacharas or items of worship, the pujari or priest performs a ritual called prana-pratistha: he calls the Lord to reside in the kavacha. He then worships the kavacha. Then it has full protective power. Men wear the kavacha around the neck or on the upper right arm, while women wear it around the neck or on the upper left arm. The Kavacha may be worn in all circumstances, at any time, or in any place.\n\nSRI NRISIMHA KAVACHA\n\nof the Trailokya Vijaya in the Samhita of Brahma\n\n1.

Also the demigods in this way became controllers of the different directions.”\n\n5. brahma mantra nayam vakshye\n\nbhutadi vinvakaram\n\nyasya prasadad durvasa\n\ntrailokya vijayi munih\n\npathanad dharanad yasya\n\nshasta cha krodha bhairavaha\n\n“I shall speak this essence of all Vedic mantras, which wards off all kinds of ghosts and hobgoblins.

My obeisances unto the ferocious and powerful, the great Visnu, the fiery one, who’s faces are on all sides, the fearful one, Nrsimha, who causes the death of even death personified, or the one who can overcome death.’ One should place this mantra, composed of thirty two syllables upon his head. It is the king of all mantras. It is like a wish fulfilling tree for the demigods and devotees.”\n\n9. kantham patu dhruvam ksraum hrid\n\nbhagavato chakshusha mama\n\nnarasimhaya cha jvala\n\nmaline patu mastakam\n\n“One should also place ksraum firmly upon his neck for protection. Placing the word bhagavate upon his heart, narasimhaya upon his two eyes, and jvala maline on the top of his head, one meditates upon the different parts of this narasimha mantra protecting the different parts of his body.”\n\n10. dipta-damshtraya cha tatha\n\nagni netraya cha nasikam\n\nsarva-raksho-ghnaya sarva\n\nbhuta-vinashanaya cha\n\n“One should place on his nose the syllables dipta damstraya agni netraya sarva rakso ghnaya sarva bhuta vinasanaya.

The Lord has four arms, and His limbs are very soft. He is decorated with golden earrings. His chest is resplendent like the lotus flower, and His arms are decorated with jewel-studded ornaments.\n\ntapta-kaanchana-sankasham\n\npita-nirmala-vasasam\n\nindradi-sura-maulishthaha\n\nsphuran manikya-diptibhih\n\n5. He is dressed in a spotless yellow garment, which exactly resembles molten gold. He is the original cause of existence, beyond the mundane sphere, for the great demigods headed by Indra.

You reside in the ocean of milk, and You carry the Sudarshana disc in Your hand. Your all-auspicious form is made even more resplendent by the jewel-like body of Anantadeva, the king of serpents upon whom You rest. You are the eternal deliverer from the ocean of birth and death for all those who seek Your shelter and You are the master of all mystics.
