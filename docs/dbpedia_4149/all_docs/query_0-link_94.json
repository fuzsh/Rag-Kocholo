        "text": "Preface\n\nPeople who are not suffering often take the attitude that they are perfectly happy without religion. By such rationalization, many are convinced that religion is a course which those who are thus inclined may follow, and others need not. But we do not know what is coming tomorrow. The possibility of suffering is there. The ordinary human being is not free from that possibility. This is why Sankhya says that we should follow those Divine Laws by which we will be freed permanently from the causes of physical, mental, and spiritual suffering, so there is no possibility of their recurrence.\n\nBut, Vedanta philosophy explains that this is not enough; this is not the whole end of religion. If we experience only the peace of mere absence of pain, sorrow, or excitement, we will eventually say, “knock me on the head to relieve this boredom”. We do not want to be merely peaceful. A person who has had too much of peace, without positive happiness, is willing to accept even sorrow in order to have a little change in his life. Beyond peace is the state of Divine consciousness, ever new bliss that will never grow stale. Religion not only free us from all suffering, but also blinds us to this eternal happiness, to cosmic happiness in God. Religion kills the germs of sorrow, so they cannot infect our happiness. It destroys the roots of suffering, and ensures attainment of positive Bliss.\n\nThe development of bhakti movement in Hindu Religion played a most important part in the evolution of different religious sects which became established in India. The three most widely worshiped deties are Sakthi, Durga and Kali. Sakthi, the mother Goddess, conceived as power both destructive and creative, has also been an object of worship in India from ancient times. There are few references to female deities in the Rigvedha, but the Hymn to the Goddess holds special sanctity among Saktas and Hindus in general for the striking way in which it emphasizes the concept of power and energy and divine grace in the goddess of speech. Well known names of Goddess as Ambika Uma, Durga and Kali do not occur in the Rigvedhic hymns; they are found in the later Aranyakas and Upanishads.\n\nWorship of the Mother Goddess was influenced by pre-Vedic customs, and was present in Vedic Times, though not in a highly developed form. There is also evidence that the goddess was worshiped in her Virgin aspect as the virgin daughter- (Kanya-kumari).\n\nMahamaya the great goddess of illusion, Mahasakthi the goddess of Supreme power, Lalita, Durga, Kali, Uma, Lakshmi, Saraswathi are the few names applied to the female aspect of the Divine. The goddess Durga is worshipped in her terrifying and in her gracious forms. The goddess Lakshmi is symbolizing prosperity and good fortune, has been an object of great veneration to countless generations of Hindus. The Goddess Saraswathi is the goddess of learning and wisdom. The goddess Kali is a different characteristic form, a four-armed goddess kali standing on the prostrate body of Siva, holding in her hands a shield, a sword, the severed head of one of the demons and the fourth hand in the assurance pose, assuring her devotees of her protection.\n\nAn introduction to the worship of maha meru - the celestial abode of goddess sri lalltha explains how the natural phenomena had developed into the worship of Goddess. Also, how the cruel and harmful religious practices such as sacrificing animals and even human beings for appeasing the Mother Goddess Kali by the average men for attainment of some extra ordinary powers have become a big blockade for the attainment of positive bliss, is well explained in this book. It is very much interesting to note Lord Hayagreeva, the god of Learning, gave Sri Lalitha sahasranamam, Trisadi and Lalithapakyanam in praise of Sri Lalitha Thirupurasundari in which it is mentioned Sri Lalithambiga appeared from the ‘Yagna Fire. What are all the necessary steps one should undergo before commencing Sri Vidya worship is well narrated. In Sri Vidya Worship, instead of any Goddess Idol, as Maha Meru (a dimensional form of Sri Chakra) is being preferred for performing Pooja, the nine sub-divisions who are the Gods and Goddesses present in each avarana how and when to reach the nineth avarana, and perform the final pooja and its related to kundalini yoga concerned with seven Atma Chakras are well explained.\n\nAll the Avarnas Thrilokya Mohana Chakram, Sarvasa Paripooraham, Sarva Samchopana, Sarva Sowbagya Dhayakam, Sarvartha Sadaka, Sarva Rakshakara, Sarva Rohakaram, Sarva Siddhi Pradam, and Sarvananda maya are well narrated by rendering detailed description about yoginis. It gives profound joy to know in detail about sixteen Nithya Devis and how to perform to worship and Dhyana for them.\n\nI appreciate the noble efforts taken by M/s. Sri maha meru dhyana nilayam for bringing this valuable book which is an additional tool to make a study of the religion of Hindus, and it is need of the hour to understand the people and culture of India.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSakthi, the Mother Goddess is all pervading and all powerful. She is the poesy of the poets, the victory of valourous; the wisdom of the sages; the Truth of the seeker; the philosophy of the philosophers and the mysticism of the mystics. She is the theism of the thiests the atheism of the atheists and the agnostisism of the agnostics.\n\nShe is the good and she is the evil. It is difficult to comprehend, yet it is true that she is the absolute and she is the relative.\n\nShe is pure consciousness and the essence of consciousness. She is consciousness pure!\n\nShe is eternal and her grace is everlasting. Even in our earthly life, we can perceive that mothers die but Motherhood dies not.\n\nShe is the most beautiful and she is the most gruesome.\n\nWith her, Brahma, Vishnu Rudran, Esan and Sadasivam are - Pancha Brahmas.\n\nWithout her, thery are ‘Pancha Prethas’ (The five corpses)\n\nInfact her seat, according to sastras, is this ‘Pancha Prethas’.\n\nShe is in every being and every non-being at the same time she transcends them too. This simultaneous immanence and transcendence of sakthi has ever been the subject matter of the songs of the immortal ‘satakas’ like Kalidasan, Abhirami Pattar and Bharathiyar.\n\nThe mother does not have name or form. But she can assume any number of forms and any number of names.\n\nAnyone without prejudice and preconceived notion will admit that apart from the pagan religions of the West, which have ceased to be, with the advent of the monotheistic religions, Hinduism alone still proclaims the supremacy of the Mother Goddess and cherishes the everlasting reverance for the sacred feminine.\n\nIn the West and in the Middle east conscious and concentrated efforts were made to subjugate woman to man and the attempt in maintaining male supremacy has attained one hundred present success. But, in India, the Sakthi cult or the worship of Sacred Faminine has been carried on down the ages uninterruptedly and it is sure to be followed with same vigour in the ages to come.\n\nIn the metro of Madras alone, not to speak of other towns and villages where Sakthi is celebrated as principle Deity daily one can find a greater number of Amman koils (Shrines of Sakthi) than the temples dedicated to Male Gods”.\n\nTherefore, it is an imperative necessity to find the ways to worship the cosmic Mother and my bosom friend Sri Tamil Maran has written this book to show us the correct path.\n\nI must here admit that the countless descriptions of the deities, their forms their names and their poojas, are beyond the comprehensions of an ordinary devotee. It is mind boggling.\n\nBut, one should not forget that the Sacred mother is also the secret Mother.\n\nShe is the secret of all secrets. That is why the shastras adore her as ‘Guhyamatha’, ‘Guhyaroopiya’ and ‘Guhyai’.\n\nRevealing the secrets of Mother worship to a commoner is a very difficult job but, what cannot be sufficiently and satisfactorily explained by theologist can easily and intelligibly explained by a poet.\n\nMy friend Tamil Maran a veteran Scholar and worshipper of Mother Divine comes to our rescue and introduces us to the worship of Sri Maha meru the celestial abode of the Sacred Mother. He has Written this treatise in simple and straight forward English without the grandiloquent expressions of psuedo scholars whose only purpose is to show off their scholarship.\n\nThis book is about Maha Meru the dimensional expansion of Sri Chakra. If deals with the nine diversions of the Meru the deities present in each avarana, the pooja methods and the Kundalini yoga, with illustrations and this treatise by my dear friend Sri Tamilmaran contains both Shastras and Sthothras.\n\nSri Tamil Maran also known Sri Krishnan is a multi lingual personality, capable of Profusely quoting from great works in Tamil, Sanskrit and English. His punching remarks and poignant statements are a feast to scholars. He is a very good conversationist. He is never gloomy. He radiates happiness wherever he goes. I always rejoice in his company.\n\nHe is a scholar, poet, lyricist, public relations officer, organiser of literary forums - all rolled into one. In his devotional songs, words ring out with a deep heart - felt sincerity. This book is a fresh laurel to his crown. I wish him every sucess in his endeavours.\n\nHow can we forget the great man Guruji Muruga Bhooshanam, who consecrated a temple in a grand manner for Maha Meru. We owe much to Sri Sivaguru without whose patronship, this book would not have appeared.\n\nWith his sweet words and pleasant countenance Sivaguru is sure to win the hearts of the people. I felicitate him and his family members who have whole heartedly dedicated themselves to the propagation of the ideals of Swamy Muruga Bhooshanam.\n\nWhile reading this book of Maran, we can’t resist the over powering attraction to practise the upasana of Sri Lalithambiga ourselves. Indeed, that is the noble intention of the creation of this splendid work by Sri Tamil Maran and Sri Siva Guru.\n\nLet us install the Maha Meru in the chambers of our heart and make our heart the everlasting abode of the Mother."
