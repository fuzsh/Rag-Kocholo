        "text": "The answer is NO. They do not need one. It is not necessary.\n\nThe concept of Kula deivam or Kula Devata is basically Non Brahmin in origin.\n\nThe Brahmins mode of worship was Panchyathana or worship of five deities for Smarthas. For Vaishnavas it was Narayana or Vishnu.\n\nNon Brahmins did not have this kind of worship. Of course for Saivas it was Shiva and Vaisnavas it was Vishnu. But most of the people staying in villages the worship was of the Village deities. Mariamman, Renuka Devi, Bhairava, Karuppanna swami were some of the deities. These deities were called Kula Devata. The Chettiar community in Tamil Nadu are mainly Bhairava worshipers. Having lived with these communities for hundreds of years some of the Brahmins also adapted the system of Kual Devata. For most Brahmins in Thirunelveli district it was Gomathi Amman in Sankaran koil.\n\nThe concept of Kula Devata is very popular among the Nair community of Kerala. All of them were attached to a particular Deity. Mostly Goddesses/Bhagavathis. Bhagavathi of a particular kavu. They visit these places and offer worship. They considered themselves to be the slaves of the deity. Adimai kavu. Many of the Tamil Brahmins who have settled in Kerala also adapted this practice. My wife's family considered themselves to be Adimais of Manappully kavu in Palghat.\n\nFor a long time Tamil Brahmins were happy with this kind of arrangement with most of them not having a Kula Devata.\n\nBut Astrologers, Cinema, and Politics played a role in increasing the importance of Kula Deivam. This is what has led to a search for Kula Deivam.\n\nI will detail that in my next post.\n\nNow the astrologers are asked to give reasons and pariharams for all the problems.\n\nDecades back the astrologers in Tamil Nadu who were all Brahmins used to advise about the good and bad periods in one's horoscope. If it is a bad period they would ask you to pray to GOD. Not any particular God. For some Dasas some particular god was suggested. For example for Sani Dasa, prayer to Hanuman was suggested.\n\nHomams were suggested but not very often.\n\nThey did not talk about தெய்வ குற்றம் daiva Kurram and pithru sabham. The reason was that almost all Brahmins did some puja and also shraddham.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Astrologers relied on Hindu Astrology and not Prasna.\n\nKerala Astrologers.\n\nThe Kerala Astrologers were mostly Panickers who are not Brahmins. They relied on Prasna Sasthram. These people were dealing mostly with non-Brhamins. People who did not do Puja and who did not perform Shraddam.\n\nLong back the astrologer would always attribute it to some Abhichara Mantra and ask them to do pujas and homams for dealing with it. They would also ask them to wear a rakshai. Most of the Keralites used to wear a rakshai. In general this rakshai consisted of Sudhrshana chakram inscribed in copper which a Pujari would energize.\n\nBecause the Malayalees had their own Kavu and believed in Kula deivam the astrologer would suggest lighting lamps in the Kavu and maintaining it.\n\nThen they were asked to do Samskaras for Pithrus because they were not in the habit of doing it regularly.\n\nGenerally the Malayalam astrologers blamed Deiva Kurram and Pithry sapam for everything. Again this is an offshoot of the mantrika school where gods had limited powers and Mantras could control and overwhelm gods.\n\nDevelopments in the last 30 years.\n\nMany Kerala astrologers have migrated to Tamil Nadu. They have also become famous because of their association with political figures. Ministers and chief ministers consulting Panickers.\n\nThe panicker's formula of Deiva Kurram and pithru sapam has run into problems in Tamil Nadu because many of them do not have Kula deivam. The non-Brahmins run to their village deities. But for Brahmins who have left their village generations back, it poses a problem. Even if you know the village there may be half a dozen temples in the village. Which is the kula deivam?\n\nAgain the astrologers have stepped in and are finding the Kula deivam through Astrology.\n\nThe basic problem is that We the Tamil Brahmins have let Astrologers become religious advisers. Astrlogers have become the authority on our religious practices.\n\nMore about this later.\n\nIf you see the people who are searching for Kula dhaivam, you would find that these are pretty desperate people who are facing insurmountable problems. Loss of Wealth, Loss of job, serious illness and so on.\n\nThese people are looking for some solution. It is like\n\nஎத்தைத் தின்னா பித்தம் தெளியும்?\n\nThey seek help from Astrologers.\n\nAstrologers do not have all the answers. There is an aspect called Divine Grace. We find it lacking in some horoscopes. The other aspects of the horoscope may be good and the person may reap benefits out of that. But then he/she faces a big almost insoluble problem. That is the effect of his/her karmas of previous Jenmas.\n\nDo you expect the Astrologer to tell him that? He can not. He is in a profession which gives hope to a number of people. So he falls back on the belief that GOD can help in overcoming the effect of your past Karma. He asks the person to go to his/her Kula Dhaivam and pray. It will prove successful in mitigating the problem.\n\nBut I have seen from my experience that many of the people who lack God's grace in their horoscope will not even do that sincerely. They only make a pretense of doing it.\n\nPlease go to a good astrologer who has intuition. Not one who inserts the maximum number of advertisements or just because he has been consulted by a V.I.P. You should understand that when a V.I.P consults an astrologer, the astrologer spends a lot of time studying the horoscope, consults books if necessary and then gives an answer. But when you go to him he does not spend much time.\n\nAstrologers who quote a lot about Kula Dhaivam and தெய்வ குற்றம் Dhaiva kurram are many a time people who are not able to diagnose your problem or find a solution. They are like the Doctors who prescribe a wide spectrum anti biotic because they are not able to diagnose the disease.\n\n\"தெய்வ குற்றம்\" என்பது எந்த வேதத்திலும்,புராணத்திலும் இல்லாத ஒரு கோட்பாடாகும். பஞ்சமாபாதகம் என சொல்வார்கள்.அது கூட தெய்வ குற்றம் கிடையாது. பாவத்திலும் பெரும்பாவம்,மன்னிப்பே இல்லாத பாவம் என சொல்லப்படுவது பாகவத அபச்சாரம் தான்.அதாவது பக்தர்களை துன்புறுத்துவது. அதற்கு பகவானால் மனிப்பு தர முடியாதாம். அந்த பக்தர்களாலேயே தர இயலுமாம்.\n\nபகவான் அபச்சாரத்தை கூட பொறுக்கலாம்,பாகவத அபச்சாரத்துக்கு மன்னிப்பில்லை என்பார்கள்.\n\nதெய்வ குற்றம் என்பது சொல்வடை மட்டுமே. நிஜமல்ல.\n\nPlease do not waste your time searching for Kula Dhaivam. Pray to your family deity or favorite deity. That will help mitigate the effect of purva jenma Karmas.\n\nTechnically speaking all of us walk around housing God in ourselves.\n\nThe body itself is a temple for God.... cos Jeevatama is but a reflection of Paramatma.\n\nIn fact only after reading forum I knew that even Brahmins have the concept of Kula Devata which came as a surprise to me.\n\nPreviously I thought a South Brahmin worship either Shiva or Vishnu or both.\n\nI am aware that Non Brahmins take the worship of Kula Devata seriously and they feel every Devata is different from each other and one might get angry if not worshipped.\n\nThey do not really think on lines of Advaita most of the while.\n\nIf we just accept every form of Divinity known to mankind as speck of Brahman..there should be no desire to be hard fast and rigid in any form of worship and even the need for a Kula Devata might not even arise(even though it is up to the individual to decide what is best for him/her).\n\nPeople need to be educated that no Devata is going to get angry with us.\n\nIn Geeta Lord Krishna does say..that no matter what path a devotee follows or worships the prayers ultimately reach Him.\n\nSo for those who want to follow Kula Devata concept let them continue for is just worshiping God in another form cos at least they will have their mind focused on something good.\n\nTechnically speaking all of us walk around housing God in ourselves.\n\nThe body itself is a temple for God.... cos Jeevatama is but a reflection of Paramatma.\n\nIn fact only after reading forum I knew that even Brahmins have the concept of Kula Devata which came as a surprise to me too.\n\nPreviously I thought a South Brahmin worship either Shiva or Vishnu or both.\n\nI am aware that Non Brahmins take the worship of Kula Devata seriously and they feel every Devata is different from each other and one might get angry if not worshipped.\n\nSo if we just accept every form of Divinity known to mankind as speck of Brahman..there should be no desire to be hard fast and rigid in any form of worship.\n\nAfter all in Geeta Lord Krishna does say..that no matter what path a devotee follows or worships the prayers ultimately reach Him.\n\nDr Renu -\n\nMany of the TB families I know (including my own) had the concept of Kula Dhaivam - usually an Amman that is predominantly managed by NBs.\n\nOurs is Siruvachiyoor Kali Amman (and Vaidyanathan Temple in Thanjavoor).\n\nAt the Kali Kovil, in the 70s and 80s the poojaris only did Pooja in Tamil.

Some does a superficial traditions to introduce Karma/Dharma in the mix.\n\nThe ultimate security and fulfillment of desire is to go to some place called heaven. Only that Hindu heaven is not forever\n\nVedanta thinking can only start when the Artha and Karma pursuits are not the significant part in a prayer and a conflict free life style is realized with a natural focus on Dharma. Epics like Ramayana provides a 'container' to discuss Dharma.\n\nBut prayer is driven by fear (need for security) and desires (I want this, also want this etc).\n\nKula Dhaivam helps like all other forms of Isvara.\n\nMany people take their children (I am sure it may have happened to me also) to shed their hair at these places. They may give their first pay check of their earning to Kula Dhaivam etc\n\nfolks - let me add to this.\n\nKula Daivam is a deity that protects our family & clan. These were in the historical past dieties in the Village or a groups of Villages that protects them from any untowards incidents. Hence both B & NBs worship the same deity. why is this manged by NB's ? Because it was the NB's who were mostly warrior communities that protected all of us & they woshipped the Kula Daivam before going for any war in the belief that this God will protect their lives & grant victory !!. so for the Bs this is the deity that protected them in the past & in the future !! Hence they pray to this God !!\n\nTKS - we also worship the Sirivachur Kali Amman. The reason why we Bs worship her is because we are all the descendants of the relatives of Kovalan/Kannagi who worship Kannagi in the form of Srivachur Kali Amman. The belief is that Kannagi only wanted a life with Kovalan & nothing else, which was unfortunately destroyed by the Kings guards, worshipping her will protect our family & prevent any untoward incidents for our families for generations !! Kannagi shadows our families where ever we go & protects us at all times. !! This tradition is more than 1500 + yr old & our ancestors have religiously followed this despite all the migration !!. So if you or I want to trace our history back, we should go to Sirivachur because thats where our ancestors lived at one point of time & then subsequent migration took us to different places !!\n\nthats why for Bs & also for NBs, Kula Daivam takes precedence over all the other Gods when we face issues & problems. And then we worship either Shiva/Ganesha/Murugan or Vishnu/Rama/Krishna (or their Avatars) as the main Gods depending on whether we are Shaivities or Vaishnavites.\n\nso why do we have both these Gods ?. Kula Daivam protects us from all physical & mental harm !! Shiva & Vishnu (and their descendants / Avatars) are the Gods that will lead us to Salvation / Mukthi from this life !!\n\nHence we worship both these Gods !!.\n\nKula Daivam is mostly Amman (except for some Vaishnavites who worship Venkateshwara/Narasimha), because for warrior communities, it is always the Mother that protects the Children !! hence most of the families will have Amman as their family diety !!\n\nPost the Ramayana war, those who aligned with Rama, started worshipping Vishnu & the avatars as the Kula Daivam !!& mostly these are the Vaishnavites !!\n\nfor Shaivites, it is Amman (Goddess Parvathi) who is the family diety in almost all cases !!!!\n\nDear TKS sir,\n\nI was really surprised when I read in Forum that Brahmins too have Kula Devata concept cos I was always under the impression that Brahmins either followed Advaita or Vishisthadvaita concept and usually worshipped Shiva/Vishnu or either Rama/Krishna most of the while as their Ishta Devata.\n\nI am not saying its wrong for anyone to have a Kula Devata concept but what surprised me was that I was always under the impression that Brahmins had a rather broader outlook when it came to worship and were always aiming for a more all encompassing form of worship...in other words a mode of worship which was either heading towards a Supreme form as in Brahman of Advaita or Vishnu of Visisthadvaita.\n\nSo if we go by the fact that both Brahmins and Non Brahmins have the same concept of Kula Devata that goes to show that there is really not much difference in the concept of worship for all types of Hindus.\n\nYour first impression is correct. Most of the Brahmins do not have a Kula Devata.\n\nIn fact even temple worship is not a must for Brahmins. My father was a traditional Brahmin. He did Panchyathana Puja throughout his life. He rarely visited temples except when on Pilgrimages. In my village men hardly ever visited the temples. Women who were denied the right to perform Puja thronged the temples.\n\nAs I said earlier the importance of Kula Deivam has spread through the Kerala Astrologers because the entire Nair community had Kula Deivams.\n\nAs far I have read, the worship of Kula Devata does not have any scriptural reference.\n\nThis thread was started by me just to emphasize the fact that not all Brahmins have Kula Deivam nor do they need one.\n\nFrantic search for Kula Deivam just because an ignorant astrologer said so is futile and uncalled for.\n\nThe Astrologers especially from Kerala are not conversant with the higher aspects of Hinduism. Kerala has its own brand of Hinduism which is in total variance with the Hinduism of rest of the country. Basic rules of Hinduism are flouted.\n\nfolks - let me add to this.\n\nKula Daivam is a deity that protects our family & clan.

These are beliefs which were adapted from the Non_Brahmins who did not perform Puja in their household. These are totally at variance with the concepts a Brahmin should be familiar with.\n\nDear Renu,\n\nI am surprised when you wrote\n\nI thought you should have known about kula Deivam concept. My father's and mother's side have different Amman kovils in\n\nKerala as their kula Deivam. Ram's family has Tirupathi Balaji and our 'sambandhi's have SiruvAchur Madhur KaLi Amman,\n\nwhich actually came as a surprise to me! This is a short description of the temple / Amman. \"Sri Madhura KaLi Amman Temple\n\nis situated in Siruvachur Village off Trichy-Chennai Higway 15 kms. South of Perambalur and 48 kms from Trichy. The temple is\n\nopen during Monday and Friday only as on other days it is beleived that the Goddess guards the village from the hills nearby\n\nalong with her guards - Sri.Selliamman and Sri Karuppanna swamy. The Goddess is known as Sri Madhurambhika.\n\nRenu, only by fear of God / Goddess, people are trying to be good, IMHO! If there is no fear, people may not be so good!! :evil:\n\nDear RR ji,\n\nI am aware of Kula Deivam concept but I was not aware that Brahmins also had the same concept.\n\nThen what is the difference that is spoken about that Brahmin and Non Brahmins when it comes to concept of prayer?\n\nNow I feel all Hindus have the more or less same concept."
