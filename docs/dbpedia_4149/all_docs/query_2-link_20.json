Yet wise are they who worship Nemesis.â â 2:202-3 (Prometheus Bound, 956-7)\n\nâPrometheus. Not yet nor thus is it ordained that fate These things shall compass; but by myriad pangs And tortures bent, so shall I âscape these bonds . . . Chorus. Then who is the helmsman of necessity? Prometheus. The triform Fates and ever-mindful Furies.â â 2:181 (Prometheus Bound, 523-4)"
