        "text": "Bhagawaan Shri Krishna declares of his designated Descent, known as AVATARA of the Absolute Reaqlity in the battle-field of Kurukshetra.\n\nAvatara is purely a Hindu concept.\n\nHow?\n\nHindus believe that God is both transcendent and immanent. God incarnates in the human form, to save the suffering humanity from the great terror of the evil in man,. The Mahabharata war happened to be the deciding factor for the Pandavas and Kauravas, about the parental dispute of their kingdom, for being rightful inheritor of the kingdom of Shantanu, the descendent of Bharata,who was the trust worthy just king of the Arya-Vartta. Lord Krishna played the role of the SAVIOR, as promised in the Bhagwad Gita.\n\nIn the Sanatana Dharma , Avatara is not only a concept, but the acclaimed Truth about the descent of the Divine Being. The same declaration has been made by MAHAMAYA, popularly revered as Shri Durga, in the 8th Manvantara, much before before the Mahabharata war took place.\n\nThe Markandeya Purana,establishes the descent of Shri Durga,for killing the nine Rakshasas--Madhu, Kaitabha,Mahishshasura, Dhumralochana,Chanda-Munda Raktabija,Shumbha and Nishumbha.Thus the Mahamaya is revered as the Nava Durga.\n\nShri Krishna is not only the incarnation of Maha-Vishnu, but he is seen with all the potentials of the Yogiraja., as described in the BHAGVATAM. He is revered as the Lord of Yoga. He was the Great Yogi, who excelled much before the Patanjali’s Yoga system, because Patanjali came much later after Shri Krishna. But Shri Krishna's Yoga was in confirmation to the Yoga, as taught by Rishi Vasishtha to Shri Rama, the Avatara of the Treta Yuga. Yoga Vasishttha is the authoritative scripture on Yoga, in relation to God, man and Universe. Shri Krishna is adored as the Yogiraja , by all the denominations of the Sanatan Dharma, with all reverence and adoration, as the Savior of the Pandavas . Yogiraja means the king of the Yogis, or the Supreme Sovereign Yogi.\n\nThere is no evidence that he underwent any Yogic practice, when he made the miracles of the highest order, when he was merely a new born baby. He showed the Chaturbhuja Narayana Roopa Darshan to his father Vasudeva, which he forgot, after performing his obligation to leave the Baby Krishna at the bed of Yashoda, popularly known as Jasodha Mata/ maiya.\n\nThe moment Lord Krishna was born, at the same moment Mahamaya-Vindhyavasini Durga was born from the womb of Yashoda/Jasodha. When Jasodha felt that she gave birth to the male baby, his own daughter, in the incarnation of Durga,was carried away by Vasudeva in the prison cell. Lord never assumes human form without his Shakti. Therefore, Krishna and Kali are one, according to the Shakta scriptures.Kali is noneelse but the Vindyavasini Durga\n\nHow?\n\nWhen we turn the pages of the Durga Sapta Shatithe highest reverential book on the Shaktivad, we come across the word MAHAMAYA. It should never be taken as great illusion but ‘Sat-Chit- Ananda’ of the Absolute. The Mahamaya/ Krishna is also revered as YOGA- Nidra by Lord Brahma, after he was rescued by VISHNU, from the deadly usurping mouths of Madhu and Kaitabha Rakshasas, when he was just born from the lotus navel of Shri Vishnu.\n\nThe moment Brahma was born, he was about to be killed by two ferocious Rakshasas, namely Madhu and Kaitabha.\n\nIt was unfortunate for Brahma to see Vishnu in great slumber or deep sleep. Brahma never knew at that time that Vishnu/ Lord Krishna was in the Samadhistha Yoga, which is termed as Yoga Nidra in Samadhi . Vishnu was not sleeping at all, or taking any sort of rest, because it was neither day nor night, nothing could be deciphered at that moment. All was in the process of evolution. Vishnu was rather absorbed in his Yoga, after given birth to Brahma. But Brahma for himself could not withstand the wrath of two demons. Therefore, he cried and cried, spontaneous were his words, with tears in his eyes. He uttered the Word SVAHA, SVADHA, VASHATKARA. He did not utter AUM at that time. He cried for \" Nitya Akshara\", which means eternally immutable sound/Shabda Brahman. Svaha is an invocation to the Divine Being, the Lord of sustenance, but Svadha is an oblation for the departed ones. Brahma was not clear in his mind, about the very being of Vishnu. He was too frightened to speak with any definite form or figure.\n\nHe was caught in great AVIDYA, or the whirlpool of anxiety how to recognize his own creator.\n\nSince Brahma’s ‘cry’ was pure in intent, as it was concerning his life, so Vishnu recognized his cry, roused from his Yoga Nidra and appeared before Brahma with his Four arms which has been described by the Veda Vyasa as:-"
