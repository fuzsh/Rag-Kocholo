It is used to make idols/statues and jewellery. Since its less expensive, Most people have a wrong perception, that, “who can not afford gold ornaments or jewellery go for (buy) Pancha loham”,. People buy pancha loham with the belief that it will bring balance to their body and mind. Its widely believed, Wearing a jewellery made of Panchaloha / Panchdhatu brings balance in life, self-confidence, good health, fortune, prosperity and peace of mind. The land and our body we dwell may have imbalance in composition of metals ~ i.e., more or less of a particular metal[s] or a absence of a metal. The secret of wearing jewellery made out of pancha loham is, it provides balance in totality…i.e., balance of life-force (prana sakthi), and thus provides Nutrient and energy to the wearers !!!\n\nIf we use jewellery made out of pancha loham there will be no question on our self-confidence, good health, fortune, prosperity and peace of mind. These are the five metals present in the human body. Studies have revealed many individuals lack some of these metal components in the body. These rings help in filling the absent component to help bring stability and positivity in one’s life. They help people to shrug off the negativity and be inclined towards their career goals and motives. These metals also compliment various gem stones which are used alongside. It is essential for you to use it if you are looking for fresh changes in your dull life.\n\nSHIPPING INFO:\n\nDispatched in a maximum of 20-30 business days. This item is not eligible for return.
