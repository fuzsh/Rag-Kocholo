        "text": "एतद्देश प्रसूतस्य सकाशादग्रजन्मना |\n\nस्वं स्वं चरित्रं शिक्षेरन् पॄथिव्यां सर्वमानवा: ||\n\nA land of rich heritage, India has numerous sacrosanct sages in different eras offer their divine knowledge. Vedic astrology is also an ancient divine science which is helping humans since long. Muhurat (good time) is always being considered before performing any propitious deed or starting any journey so that the same can be accomplished without any hurdle. It would bring positive results.\n\nHora Chakram is a very important and integral part of Vedic astrology. It has been described through the following verse (shlok):\n\n\"यस्य ग्रहस्य वारे यत्किंचित्कर्म प्रकीर्तित:।\n\nतत्तस्य काल होरायां सर्वमेव विधीयते।।\"\n\nIt means that different sages have said that whenever a work has to be accomplished in a specific day, it should be done during that day’s Hora and Nakshatra.\n\nMeaning of Hora\n\nThe word Hora has derived from Ahoratra in which “Aho” means day and “Ratra” means night. In Spanish language, Hora also means time. According to vedic astrology, (a)hora(tra) is the duration between Sunrise to next sunrise. Hora is considered as the important part of astrology. When there is no availability of any auspicious Muhurat for a specific work, the management of Hora Chakra is given in vedic astrology. Hora Shastra has been considered as the infallible medium of work achievement.\n\nHow to Calculate Hora Muhurat?\n\nOut of 7 days a week, every day has its own planetary Lord viz Sun-Sunday, Moon-Monday, Mars-Tuesday, Mercury-Wednesday, Jupiter-Thursday, Venus-Friday and Saturn-Saturday. Each Hora is dedicated to one planet hence, there are total 7 Horas in actual. These are Sun Hora, Venus Hora, Jupiter Hora, Moon Hora, Mercury Hora, Mars Hora and Saturn Hora respectively.\n\nHora is a unit of time. There are 24 Horas in a day that comes around the duration of approx 1 hour. However; this can be changed as the same is dependent upon total period from one Sunrise to another.\n\nThere is day and night in total during sunrise to sunrise. This period is divided in two major parts. Day Horai or Daytime (Din Maan) from Sunrise to Sunset and Night Horai or Night Time (Ratri Maan) from Sunset to next sunrise. There's always some minor change of time of sunrise and sunset, hence duration of Din Maan and Ratri Maan changes accordingly. There are 12 Horas each in a day and night. Hereby, the duration of Day and Night is further divided into 12 equal parts consisting of 12 horas.\n\nFirst Hora of a specific day is of the Day Lord and second hora is of 6th Day Lord from the day itself and so on. Thereafter this cycle would continue till next day until sunrise.\n\nFor example: If today is Sunday, so First Hora will be of Sun, Second hora will be the 6th day lord i.e. Venus, Third Mercury, Fourth Moon, Fifth Saturn, Sixth Jupiter, Seventh will be of Mars and thereafter next Hora will be of Sun and so on. After next day sunrise, first hora of that would begin in the same manner.\n\nImportance of Shubha Horai\n\nHora plays an important and significant role in our day-to-day life and is relevant in performing some specific works. Everyone wishes for accomplishment of their objectives without any hurdle or obstruction to achieve maximum gains. With the support of Hora, we can perform our tasks without any trouble and success in work is almost assured. It is believed that during Hora Muhurat, every work done is successful. Seven Horas of seven planets provide everyone with good or bad chances to fulfill their wishes.\n\nSome horas are considered auspicious for work while some are not, as it depends upon the relationship of Hora with a specific planet. It is advised to segregate your routine works according to hora periods so as to achieve success.\n\nKnow Which Hora Is Suitable For You\n\nLet’s know which Hora is favorable for which specific purpose:-\n\nSun Hora: Sun Hora is good for applying for Government Jobs, bidding or tendering.
