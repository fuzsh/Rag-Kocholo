Particular thanks go to two outside readers for giving the book such careful and helpful evaluations. These readers—one anonymous; the other, Linda Hess—took the book on as if it had been their own, offering detailed suggestions as to how it could be improved. Linda Hess did so in a particularly direct way, by penciling in numerous rewrites, particularly in the prologue. These were invaluable. And the comments received from our contributors were invariably helpful and insightful.\n\nTwo of the chapters in this book were originally published in our earlier volume, The Divine Consort: Radha and the Goddesses of India. For permission to reprint these essays, we are grateful to the original publisher, the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley. For further assistance, very cordially rendered, we are indebted to Lauren Bryant, Martha Gollup, and Rebecca Ver- rill of Beacon Press, which published the paperback edition of The Divine Consort. X number of the illustrations come from museum collections and previous publications of various kinds. We are sincerely grateful to the companies, publishers, and organizations who have granted us permission to reproduce.\n\nWe wish also to thank the institutions with which we are associated: Brown University, Barnard College, and Columbia University. Brown provided funds so that Maya Grosz could explore certain of the publications listed in our bibliography. Kathleen Pappas of the Department of Religious Studies at Brown and Tara Susman of the Religion Department at Barnard were kind-spirited and sometimes long-suffering when asked to help shoulder a variety of burdens. Robert Cessna and his staff at the Southern Asian Institute of Columbia University cheerfully assisted with tasks of duplication and coordination. Paul Arney, of the Religion Department at Columbia, checked a number of references with meticulous care.\n\nFinally, we would express deep gratitude to our colleagues who contributed essays to the book. They have formed an especially genial and enthusiastic group, working patiently through many revisions without having the stimulus of a conference or seminar series to urge them on. We very much look forward to gathering, at last, for a cast party once the book has been born.\n\nJohn Stratton Hawley Donna Marie Wulff\n\nNew York and Providence, May, 1995\n\nA NOTE ON TRANSLITERATION\n\nAND PRONUNCIATION\n\nFor the sake of internal consistency throughout the volume, we have retained the Sanskrit or pan-Indian forms of words wherever it seemed reasonable to do so, and we have followed the standard system of transliterating Sanskrit. Although Sanskrit makes no distinction between upper- and lower-case letters, we have used capitals to indicate proper names and titles (Devi, Mata, Vindhyaksetra, etc.). For the terms from Malayalam and Tamil found in the chapters by Caldwell and Narayanan, respectively, we have adopted the authors’ conventions.\n\nExceptions include terms that have been anglicized in form (Krishna, Pu- ranic) or that have come into English usage (guru, swami, yoga, avatar); these are treated as English words. Further, modern place names are given in their current transliterated forms, but without diacritics. If references to such places are made in a literary context, however, the diacritics have been retained.\n\nThe vowels of Sanskrit and other Indian languages are pronounced much as those of Latin, Italian, or French, with the following exceptions:\n\na is pronounced like the short u in English cup, a is pronounced like the broad a in English father, r (a vowel) is a liquid sound that approximates the flipped r of British very.\n\nAlthough the system of consonants is complex, the English reader can approximate their sounds using the following guidelines:\n\nc is pronounced like the English ch, as in cherry,\n\nh after a consonant (e.g., p) indicates that the consonant is aspirated, i.e., articulated with a puff of air, as in the English hip-hop,\n\ns and 5 are pronounced roughly like the English sh, as in shame.\n\nSites listed include those explicitly mentioned in the text as well as those where one of the goddesses discussed in the following essays is particularly worshiped or thought to be at home.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nThe Goddess in India\n\nJohn Stratton Hawley\n\nOne of the critical developments in the recent history of Western religion has been the effort to make clearer contact with the feminine dimension in religious experience. This has taken a myriad of forms. Women are now ordained ministers and rabbis in a number of communities where a few years ago the idea would have been laughed away. Gender-neutral language is mandated in many hymnals, prayer books, and new translations of the Bible. Much attention has been focused on feminine images for God in the scriptures and elsewhere. Groups of women have labored to rescue the word witch from its infamous past by becoming witches themselves—and demonstrating whose infamy it actually was, when witches were burned at Salem and elsewhere. Finally, there has been a determined assault on the very history of Western religion in an effort to discover at its origins a Goddess who was widely worshiped before the champions of patriarchy suppressed her. Could she not be worshiped again? Indeed, she is.\n\nThe Abrahamic faiths nonetheless place many barriers in the way of seeing the divine as feminine. Those who assert that a coherent culture of the Goddess once prevailed across the Mediterranean world and Europe acknowledge that it has long since been defiled, broken, obscured.¹ In the task of reconstruction—at the scholarly level as well as in the realm of practice—great creativity will be required before Westerners can discover the Goddess again.\n\nNot so for India. All through the archaeological remains of the Indus Valley Civilization, which created a new standard of culture for South Asia in the third and second millennia B.C.E., one finds a distinctive set of female terracotta figurines—thousands of them. We cannot tell exactly what functions they served or what they meant to those who made and kept them, but there seems no question about their ubiquity or importance. Moreover, the styles of modeling they display were carried forward into subsequent ages. Female sculptures from the Mauryan period (fourth to second centuries B.C.E.) and even later often look very much like their Indus prototypes.² By that time one also has much clearer evidence of a religion that projected the divine in both masculine and feminine terms.³ True, the Aryan civilization that became increasingly dominant in North India at the level of high culture from 1000 B.C.E. onward allotted only minor roles to goddesses, but the material evidence shows that the indigenous culture never died out. In fact, one scholar recently suggested that the history of the Hindu tradition can be seen as a reemergence of the feminine.⁴ As the Sanskrit textual tradition developed up through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries C.E., the place of the Goddess in it became ever more firmly established.\n\nThus, in the religious life of Hindus today there is no need to resuscitate the Great Goddess. She is alive and well. She proliferates in ever new forms of herself (many would say, in fact, that she is fundamentally plural rather than singular), and she animates the religious lives of hundreds of millions of people. Her generic name in Sanskrit and the many Indian languages related to it is devi, a word that, like its Latin and Greek cognates dea and thea, means simply goddess. This is a book about Devi, singular and plural, the Goddess and goddesses of India.\n\nIt has a forerunner. A decade ago, Donna Wulff and I published a collection of essays (five of which reappear here, in altered form) under the title The Divine Consort: Radha and the Goddesses of India.⁵ That volume focused on Radha, the consort of the well-known Hindu god Krishna, and had as a primary aim the task of making her better known and understood outside of India. Other goddesses were arrayed around Radha, with the particular desire of illuminating her place in the broader Hindu tradition. The book that emerged was the first collection of essays in English on Hindu goddesses, but because of the intimate relation between Radha and Krishna, it inevitably laid a certain emphasis on goddesses who are understood as wives or consorts.\n\nThis time we intend to shift the balance so that independent goddesses and goddesses who dominate their male partners can take center stage. In part, this reflects the redirection of Western scholarship in the intervening decade, which is in turn partially a response to the vigorous feminist influence in the field of religious studies. But this attempt to readjust the balance in the earlier book also has a logic of its own. However wide-ranging the essays that The Divine Consort comprised, the name of the book quite wrongly suggested that male gods (and perhaps male religion) are the fundamental point of reference in Hinduism. Indian society may be overwhelmingly patriarchal, as is often said, but in the realm of religion the picture is far more complex.\n\nThe entrance of many women scholars into the field of Hindu studies has also facilitated another important change that is reflected in this book. These women have often been able to pursue research into aspects of the living religion of India that their male predecessors could only approach indirectly. In a society where women and men often lead separate lives, women scholars can observe and enter into conversation with Hindu women far more easily than men. Of course, it would be wrong to think that Hindu goddesses are worshiped exclusively or even primarily by women, but female devotees certainly figure importantly in the communities that revere them. Several chapters in the book—those by Cynthia Humes, Donna Wulff, Lindsey Harlan, Kathleen Erndl, Sarah Caldwell, and Rachel McDermott— especially benefit from this new mode of access to the Goddess, and in general the focus on lived religion here is stronger than it was in The Divine Consort, which had a predominantly textual orientation. Because most Indian texts about goddesses, whether consort or free, have been composed by men, this increasing disengagement from the hegemony of the written word is doubly significant.\n\nCritics may well observe that another hurdle is yet to be jumped: most of the authors represented here are not themselves Hindus. Only one has an Indian language as her mother tongue. With the rapid movement of South Asians into a Western diaspora, and with the gradual (if sometimes grudging) acknowledgment in India itself that religion is a respectable field of study, another decade will doubtless not only demand but make possible further changes of perspective in a collection such as this. More Hindu voices will be heard—and particularly, more voices of Hindu women.\n\nONE GODDESS AND MANY, NEW AND OLD\n\nIn 1975 the movie Jai Santoshi Ma emerged from the thriving network of studios that make Bombay one of the major capitals of the international film industry, and within months a new goddess was being worshiped throughout India. The name of the movie can be loosely translated as Hail to the Mother of Satisfaction, and it heralded a divinity—The Mother of Satisfaction, Santosi Ma—who had hitherto remained entirely unknown to most Indians. In fact, although a temple to her existed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, she had evidently not been known very long under that name or in that form even there. Before 1967 the temple now dedicated to her had belonged to a goddess called Lal Sagar kl Mata, The Mother of the Red Lake, near whose banks it stands, and the characteristics of the earlier goddess diverged in important respects from those of Santosi Ma. Most significantly, Lal Sagar kl Mata was a carnivore, to whom goats and other animals were periodically sacrificed, whereas Santosi Ma is a vegetarian, with chickpeas and unrefined sugar at the center of her diet.\n\nMost who saw the movie knew nothing of this previous history, or indeed of Santosi Ma herself, before they walked into cinema halls throughout the subcontinent. Yet the goddess who appeared before them in celluloid form was in many ways familiar. The colors of her clothes and complexion were drawn from a palette standardized by the poster-art industry that dominates the iconographic imaginations of most modern-day Hindus (see figure 1). Her characteristic poses showed her standing or sitting on a lotus, as several other goddesses do. (See especially Vasudha Narayanan’s description of Sri in this collection.) And she shared her most prominent implements, the sword and trident, with the great goddess often named Durga. (See the chapter by Thomas Coburn on Devi and Kathleen Erndl’s essay on Seranvali.)\n\nAs her film brought her to life, however, Santosi Ma quickly became one of the most important and widely worshiped goddesses in India, taking her place in poster-art form in the altar rooms of millions of Hindu homes. People throughout India, especially women, kept (and still keep) a vow of fasting for sixteen consecutive Fridays. On those days they made special offerings to Santosi Ma, hoping to be blessed with a wish fulfilled. Then, and at other times too, they read her story and sang her songs. The annual calendar of Hindu festivals also responded to her advent. In late summer there is a celebration of brother-sister solidarity, rakhior raksabandhana, which the film identified as the moment of and reason for Santosi Ma’s birth. Not unexpectedly, then, her image began to appear on the bright paper medallions that decorate the threads (rakhis) sisters tie onto the wrists of their brothers and other male relatives and friends on that day. Everywhere, Santosi Ma images and shrines were added to temples, and in some cases, as had already happened in Jodhpur, she took over the place of the presiding deity in temples that had previously been dedicated to other goddesses.\n\nHow was all this possible? Obviously the filmmakers had found the right story at the right time. Obviously, they were appealing to a religious culture in which visual access to the divine was understood to be both legitimate and crucial. Moreover, many said, it was devotion that had produced the film: the filmmaker’s wife, after discovering Santosi Ma on a pilgrimage to Jodhpur, had been the one who persuaded her husband to spread the goddess’s message by translating her into a new medium.\n\nYet it is hard to conceive that Santosi Ma could have granted such instant satisfaction to so many people had she not been part of a larger and already well-integrated culture of the Goddess. Her new devotees could immediately recognize many of her characteristic moods and attributes, and feel them deeply, because she shared them with other goddesses long since familiar to them. Some of these divine women were somewhat playfully depicted in the film as struggling spitefully against the growth of the cult of the new goddess—and understandably, for she had stolen their fire. In some sense, she really was Brahmani and Parvati and Laksmi, the goddesses who\n\ndid their best to make life hard for Santosi Ma’s paradigmatic devotee. In some sense, too, she prevailed because of her youth and vigor. In India, as elsewhere, there is something fascinating about the new, and the film’s own plot suggested it was natural that Santosi Ma’s youth should arouse the envy of older goddesses.\n\nBut there was another secret to her success: she was a unitive presence. At least in the context of this film, she was the Great Goddess in a way that Brahman!, Parvati, and Laksmi, as wives to the classic triad of supreme Hindu gods (Brahma, Siva, and Visnu), were not. Although she was depicted as emerging from a divine lineage, she stood on her own. Not only did she incorporate and thus summarize a certain spectrum of preexisting female divinities, but she unified them as well, amalgamating their power for her devotees.\n\nThere is much more to be said about the appeal of this new film goddess, as Stanley Kurtz has attempted to do in his recent book, All the Mothers Are One.⁶ Yet in all of it one can scarcely miss the point that, as his title suggests, Hindu goddesses tend to be seen as close relatives of one another—even possessing a common substance—in a way that is somehow less true of the male side of the Hindu pantheon. The high theology of the Goddess enunciated in two classic Sanskrit texts, the Devi Mahdtmya and the Devi Bhdgavata Purdna, provides a way of understanding why this should be so. For most Hindus, the gods, too, are ultimately understood as a unity: bhagavan ek hi hai (God is one), as the common Hindi phrase has it. Yet this unity is typically conceived to exist at a level distant from everyday life—at the nonqualified (nirguna) level. With goddesses, it is different. As described in the texts just named (on one of which, the Devi Mahdtmya, see the essays by Thomas Coburn and Cynthia Humes), the unity of the Great Goddess incorporates the world as we know it, as well as transcending it. In some sense, Goddess is our world, in a way that God is not. Hence the multiple forms she takes are connected in a way that strikes us as more intimate than those we typically project when we understand the divine as male.\n\nThis is not to deny the variousness of the Goddess. In one of her most prevalent expressions she spreads herself across the landscape of much of India—the southern part especially—such that she becomes specific to each place she touches. Each village has its tutelary divinity, its gramadevatd (village deity), and the personality of each is distinct: no one place is the same as any other. Yet the fact that the divine is ubiquitous in this manner says something generic, and Hindus have overwhelmingly conceptualized that place-specific, divine reality as female. These village deities are almost always understood as goddesses, not gods. In most instances their commonality can be acknowledged by calling each of them Mother, and in many places in South India one can be even more specific. There, village goddesses tend to collect under the common heading of Mariyamman: the Mariyamman of this locale or that, after the fashion of Our Lady of .⁷\n\nIt is important to understand that for Hindus, real differentiations, such as those that obtain among local deities, do not necessarily imply unbridgeable gaps between members of a given set of beings. As Diana Eck has commented about Indian ways of thinking, If something is important, it is important enough to be repeated, duplicated, and seen from many angles.⁸ This is true for gods, and even truer for goddesses. Not so many years ago India’s vast film industry produced a movie, entitled Sarasvat, Laksmi, Parvati, and on billboards the three goddesses were clumped together as a triad—three similar-looking heads emerging as if from a common frame. It is hard to imagine a film taking its title from the names of three gods who would be portrayed in the same fashion.\n\nOf course, Hindu male deities do sometimes share emblems, attributes, and properties. Visnu’s characteristic disc can on occasion be found in the hand of Krishna, who is often conceptualized as his avatar, and Siva’s habit of wearing snakes as garlands is often replicated in his horrific manifestation as Bhairava (The Fearsome One). Yet this sharing of family traits is even more pronounced on the female side of the Hindu pantheon. To begin with, goddesses observe an important ground rule that does not apply to gods: when they appear in sculpted form, as images, they are almost invariably anthropomorphic.⁹ More than that, they share associations: with the auspicious, gentle lotus on the one hand, and with such powerful weapons as the sword and the trident on the other. Similar ties emerge at the level of theological analysis. For example, goddesses are characteristically described as bearing a close relation to power or energy per se (sakti). That energy is abundant in the physical universe we inhabit. Hence, goddesses tend to be strongly associated with the forces of nature (prakrti) and the earth—sometimes in its nurturing, maternal aspect, sometimes in its natural periodicity, sometimes in its uncontrollable, destructive power. The earth itself is typically figured as a goddess: bhu, the earth, is Bhdev. Often, too, the power of a goddess (or the Goddess) is experienced as brilliantly hot—a quality called tejas. Finally, perhaps especially in the eyes of men, this goddess power is felt to be somehow miraculous, to produce illusion (mayaj to delude. And not surprisingly, all but one of the concepts we have just listed are grammatically feminine in Sanskrit and in other Indic languages that distinguish nouns by gender (tejas, the exception, is neuter).\n\nTo a certain degree, these family resemblances carry over into the ritual dimension as well. Both gods and goddesses are worshiped throughout India with a ritual vocabulary whose central elements remain more or less constant. To the accompaniment of music, offerings of praise (puja) are made to the divinity, who is typically present in the form of a clothed image (murti), and certain of the offerings are standard: incense, flowers, lighted candles or flames of burning camphor, and various sorts of food. These, once touched or tasted by the divinity, are returned to the worshipers as ritual leftovers, called prasad. The word means literally grace and signifies that the original giver in this transaction is actually the deity, who is the real author of the materials being offered—and, indeed, of the offerers. A similar thing holds true for the act of visual attention (darsan, seeing or sight) that accompanies these acts of worship. On the one hand, the worshiper sees the divinity, in an imagistic expression. Yet on the other, the worshiper is seen by the deity, the image, for the image has been ritually enlivened and thus has eyes. As with prasad, there is the conviction that in this visual transaction the deity’s act of seeing actually precedes the devotee’s. Ontologically, it has a prior status.\n\nAll this is standard for deities of either sex. It is noteworthy, however, that certain kinds of symbols and rituals are particularly associated with female divinities. For example, goddesses are often represented by pots; the pot overflowing with vegetation is an ancient Indian symbol of fructification. Further, goddesses tend to possess their devotees to the point of total identification, which is much rarer for gods. Possession is not entirely absent in the worship of male divinities, but it is especially characteristic of the worship of goddesses. In a similar way, it would seem likely, although the evidence is far from complete, that women are more frequently possessed by goddesses than are men.¹⁰ Certainly, women figure more prominently in possession performances associated with goddesses than they do as lead actors in the general run of public Hindu rites. Finally, and quite importantly, some goddesses (but emphatically not all) share a taste for blood sacrifice. Sacrificial violence is endemic to the worship of many goddesses, especially the village deities and local guardians mentioned above, so it was no small matter when the carnivorous Lal Sagar ki Mata was converted into the vegetarian Santosi Ma. The elimination (or sublimation) of blood sacrifice in Hindu religion is a long-standing historical trend that applies to both gods and goddesses.¹¹ But it is notable that where real sacrifice persists, a female divinity is apt to be involved.¹²\n\nGiven this pattern of multiplicity and convergence, it is often hard to know how best to refer to Devi in English. Sometimes the singular feels more accurate, sometimes the plural. When we are speaking in the singular, it seems sexist and perhaps even imperialist to stick to English convention and withhold the capital G that we so readily award to a single male divinity. Hence, readers of this book will encounter not only goddesses and goddess, but Goddess—both with and without the definite article. Since Indic languages observe no distinction between capital and lowercase letters, and since they lack the definite article, the g/G and the problems are clearly ours, not India’s. But the quandary as to singular or plural is shared.\n\nIn similar fashion, there is no right way to array the extraordinary range of goddesses who will appear in the pages that follow. The present ordering of chapters reflects only one possible alignment, and even it is the product of several compromises. Readers are invited to imagine other configurations. Given the complicated web of ties that binds these goddesses together—and, equally, the many features that keep them apart—no one arrangement can be definitive.\n\nTHE GODDESS AS SUPREME, THE GODDESS AS CONSORT\n\nIn the first part of this book, we follow one major gradient: the contrast between goddesses who are conceived as supreme, independent, and comprehensive, and those whose character is shaped by relationships—especially the relations they bear to the male gods who are their consorts. Two chapters are devoted to exploring each type, and a transitional chapter links these two sets of two. At the independent end of the spectrum we encounter the generic Devi and her closely related aspect, the locally grounded Vindhyavasini. These goddesses are characterized by their supremacy over all other forms of life, whether animal, human, or divine. At the other end of the spectrum we have Sri (or Laksmi, as she is sometimes called) and Radha, both of whom are defined by their relationships to their mates, although in markedly divergent ways. In between, we meet Kali, a goddess who fits into neither of these sets and in a strange way mediates between the transcendent and the consort goddesses. On the one hand, Kali unquestionably manifests herself as supreme—whether as a mother demanding submission or as uncanny, uncontrollable force—but, on the other hand, her supremacy is paradigmatically measured by the power she exerts over her consort, the great god Siva. As her myths of origin reveal, she is both the same as and different from the Great Goddess.\n\nWith this Great Goddess, then, we begin: Devi, the transcendent and allencompassing. In the book’s opening chapter Thomas Coburn describes the earliest known Hindu text in which, as he puts it, ultimate reality is understood as Goddess: the sixth-century Devi Mdhdtmya (Glorification of the Goddess). Coburn points to the many ways in which the theologian (s) who composed it combined and reshaped earlier formulations to make them serve the cause of a single, supreme Goddess. He retells three of Devi’s most important martial encounters, in which she defeats demons who threaten the stability of the world, to illustrate how she exemplifies the powers of illusion and redemption from it (may a), earthiness and materiality (prakrti), and power or energy (sakti). As we have seen, each of these Sanskrit concepts is feminine, and Coburn shows how they all serve a female-focused vision of both cosmic and earthly reality. At the same time, however, he demonstrates how the Devi Mdhdtmya associates these female properties with the Great Goddess in such a way as to avoid the conclusion that they have male counterparts, as they are assumed to have in other expressions of the Hindu tradition. For the Devi Mdhdtmya, mdyd is not complementary or subordinate to Visnu, as other texts would have it. Nor is prakrti balanced— or superseded—by the principle of maleness, purusa, with which it is so often paired. Nor is sakti paired with, or subsumed in, the male god Siva. In Devi, these qualities stand on their own, constituting reality in a manner that is independently female.\n\nToward the conclusion of his chapter, Coburn takes up the various ways in which this independent theology of the Great Goddess relates to elements of the Hindu tradition that are not so entirely focused on the feminine. As we have already hinted, these include communities devoted to the worship of Siva (the Saivas) or Visnu (the Vaisnavas) or gods such as Krishna who are frequently conceptualized as being avatars of Visnu (Vaisnavas again). Coburn also distinguishes between some of the perspectives of the Devi Mdhdtmya and those that developed later within communities devoted primarily to the Goddess and her many forms, communities broadly referred to as Sakta, a term deriving from the concept of sakti.\n\nIn the chapter that follows, by Cynthia Ann Humes, we have a chance to see what happens to the idea of the Great Goddess when it is taken up by one of these Sakta traditions, as practiced in a particular place. The place is a village called Vindhyachal. It marks the spot at which the Vindhya mountain range, which stretches across the center of India, comes to an end at the banks of the Ganges. As we shall see, the Ganges itself is understood by Hindus to be a goddess—hence the place has unusual power—and the goddess who reigns there is known as Vindhyavasini, ‘The One Who Dwells in the Vindhyas. The tradition of her worship is old. Humes shows, in fact, that it contributed to the general formulation of goddessness\" that is found in the Devi Mdhdtmya. Yet it is also given voice in a text specific to the Vindhya locale itself, the Vindhya Mdhdtmya (Glorification of the Vindhyas). This work praises the Vindhya mountain range and the town that serves as its emblem, while at the same time extolling the goddess Vindhyavasini who enlivens them both and, in a deep sense, is them.\n\nHumes offers a memorable account of what it is like to join the pilgrims who come to worship Vindhyavasini: milling crowds, the sound of temple gongs, blood sacrifices, and the following of ritual diagrams. Here we see— and hear, touch, and smell—what it is to encounter this transcendent goddess in real time and space. We come to sense how Hindus in one specific context taste the affirmation that the Great Goddess’s transcendence must be experienced through her simultaneous immanence in the world we inhabit.\n\nHumes also shows that the meaning of this conflation of transcendent and immanent is undergoing a process of continuous renegotiation. She highlights the manner in which the text describing this particular place, the Vindhya Mdhdtmya, is progressively being displaced by the Devi Mdhdtmya, even in local usage. As they increasingly seek to appeal to pilgrims drawn from far-flung places, the priests and pilgrim guides of Vindhyavasini tend to express her transcendence in a language that implicitly subordinates the here-and-now goddess Vindhyavasini to the more generalized Devi of the Devi Mdhdtmya. For their more cosmopolitan clients in particular, they reorient the old passions of Vindhyavasini in the direction of an emerging pan-Hindu orthodoxy that emphasizes Vedic roots, vegetarian habits, and a universalist theology.\n\nSome of these same transitions can be seen in the worship of Kali (The Black One). Recent field study by Rachel Fell McDermott, some of which she reports in her chapter at the end of this collection, shows that in modern-day Bengal, at least, the Black Goddess is predominantly conceived as a kind and beautiful maternal force.¹³ Yet, as her distinctly nonvegetarian patterns of worship and apparently horrific iconography reveal, there was a time not long ago when Kali was experienced as a terrifying reality. Sarah Caldwell’s description of Kali as she appears in a South Indian locale under the name Bhagavati (The Blessed One) conveys some sense of how this violent Kali feels to present-day worshipers, and David Kinsley’s portrait of her as she appears in several key Sanskrit texts—the third chapter of our book— echoes many of the same themes.\n\nKinsley shows how Devi’s three great aspects—mdyd, prakrti, and sakti— take on a new form when expressed through Kali. Kali provides startling glimpses of what can happen when powers of illusion, natural forces, and energy exist in a pure form, beyond the control of any governing, restraining structure. For example, there is the paradigmatic moment when Kali dances wild on the prone, ithyphallic corpse of her husband Siva. It seems clear that such images of Kali were shaped by men, and male roles are what give structural definition to most segments of Hindu society. Hence it is no surprise that, as Lawrence A. Babb some years ago observed, goddesses bear a seemly, auspicious demeanor when they are subjected to the will of their husbands or consorts—that is, when they serve within the structures that their spouses provide. But they appear dangerous and threatening when they do not.¹⁴\n\nMen know that women possess a power that exceeds the structures they would like to impose, structures that have collectively been called dharma: the way things should be, at least according to the dominant men. As Kinsley demonstrates, one influential account of Kali’s origins gives shape to this knowledge: the gods need her to confront demons they cannot contain, but once they release her from their own beings and allow her to consolidate herself beyond the boundaries that their personalities provide, she becomes uncontrollable. Or, in a parallel tale, once she escapes the control of her aroused mate, Siva (siva means literally the auspicious one), she expands her form and relaxes her behavior to the point where she dances a crazed dance on Siva’s corpse (sava, the most inauspicious of things). In these stories she is, as Kinsley says, blood and death out of place. In confronting her, we are not only horrified but potentially saved. A vision of Kali takes us beyond the constraints through which and within which we live. Kali releases.\n\nIn this paradoxical meeting of affliction and liberation, Kali establishes a paradigm that fits many other goddesses, especially goddesses who express themselves as diseases. There is Sitala, for example, the goddess of pustular diseases who is worshiped all across North India and has counterparts elsewhere, too.¹⁵ In her main incarnation as smallpox, she maims, disfigures, kills. Yet her name means The Cool One, as if she connoted something far more soothing than her diminutive demon-consort Jara (Fever), the burning, delusion-causing reality that every smallpox victim knows. Poems to Sitala demonstrate the paradox that disease is not just curse but release— release from life in its humdrum channels, a journey into levels of sensitivity that seem now illusory, now realer than real. Even death can be a release of this sort—release from life itself—and because death and life are often seen by Hindus as contrasting moments along a single gradient of experience, a single goddess may govern them both. Sitala does this, as both the disease and its cure. And, on a grander scale, so does Kali: her name means not only black but deathly. Sarah Caldwell’s chapter later in the book describes how her affliction and deliverance are dramatized and experienced in one regional setting. Kathleen Erndl’s chapter provides comparative material for Devi; and in Vindhyavasini, too, we encounter a goddess whose independence can sometimes lead to excess.\n\nIn chapters 4 and 5 we turn to a much less frightful, less paradoxical pair of divinities—Sri and Radha. As Babb’s typology of malevolent and benevolent goddesses would predict, these are deities who relate to their mates in more characteristically amenable ways than Kali or Sitala. Both are consorts of Visnu, but in different roles. As Vasudha Narayanan shows, Sri (or Laksmi) is his wife, serving him predictably, eternally. True, she is sometimes shown independent of Visnu, standing on the auspicious lotus, showering benefits on her human devotees, her children. But Sri has another pose that more clearly represents what theologians regard as her ontological (as against so- teriological) status and that serves as background for most devotees’ understanding of the goddess, even when she stands alone. In this second pose, Sri appears as the breast-jewel of Visnu, ever cradled in his arms, nurturing him with her warmth and sharing his essence. According to the Sri Vaisnava community of South India, who especially revere her, it is because of this intimate, submissive association with Visnu, the lord of all reality, that she is able to dispense the benefits she does. Sri is Visnu’s smiling, maternal side, the caring dimension that balances the authority symbolized by his maleness.\n\nOne can, however, take this emphasis too far. Narayanan is very interested in slippages between the reigning theology of the Sri Vaiava community, as represented in what we have just said, and the ways in which certain groups of worshipers celebrate Sri as if she were a force fully coequal to Visnu—on rare occasions, almost independent. Yet there is never any question about the importance of the bond of marriage that ties her to Visnu. That bond, which mandates that a wife be subservient to husband, symbolizes the stability of the relation between the accessible (female) and the transcendent (male) sides of the divine. Sri is Viu’s wife. She is not his only wife: Bhdev, the Earth, in whom we participate directly, is also there.¹⁶ But Sri, the pure principle of cosmic auspiciousness, goes beyond the mixed earthly realm in which we live, and thus shares fully in the divine. Nevertheless, she does so without challenging the hierarchical order that is intrinsic to it. However transcendent, she continues to serve her husband— far more than he serves her.\n\nRadha’s relation to Krishna, who is often interpreted as an avatar of Visnu but whom many of his devotees regard as the ultimate form of divinity, is different. Krishna takes to its logical conclusion the quality of free play (lila) through which Visnu manifests the world. In the paradigmatic form in which most of his devotees worship him, he is no king and no husband. Instead he is a youth. Although inherently powerful, he plays freely, letting his appetites carry him where they will, far beyond any constraints that might be implied by propriety, duty, or what many people conceive as religion. The word dharma means each of these things, and in his playfulness Krishna eternally transcends dharma."
