        "text": "SRI SUDARASHANA CHAKRAM OF LORD RAMA, BHADRACHALAM\n\n76th Sloka from Sri Sudarashan Sathakam:-\n\n76) VAANEE POURAANIKEE YAM PRATHAYATHI MAHITHAM PREYKSHANAM KAITABHAAREYEHEY\n\nSHAKTHIRYASYESHUDAMSHTRAANAKHAPARASHUMUKHAVYAAPINEE THAVIBHOOTHYAAM\n\nKARTHUM YATTHATHVABODHO NA NISHITHAMATHIBHIRNAARADAADYAISHCHA SHAKYAHA\n\nDEIVEEM VO MAANUSHEEM CHA KSHIPATHU SA VIPADAM DUSTHARAAMASRARAAJAHA.\n\nMeaning-This slokam reveals where the 'tejas' and the 'Shakthi' of Sri Sudarashana Chakra Rajan are concentrated.\n\nThe benedictionis-\" SA: ASTHRA RAAJA: VA: DEIVEEM MAANUSHEEM CHA VIPADAAM KSHIPATHU\". (May Sri Sudarashana Chakram , King of weapons chase away the dangers that originate from Devas and human beings!)\n\nScriptures reveal that (Vaanee Pouraanikee Yam Prathayathi) Sri Sudarshana is the sankalpa (resolution) Shakthi of Lord Vasudeva who resides in Vaikuntham (Mahitham Preykshanam Kaitabhaarey:), Sri Sudarshana's power resides during Ramaavataram in His arrows, in His canine teeth during Varaahaavataram, in His nails during Nrusimhaavataaram, in His axe in Parashuraamaavataaram and in the appropriate weapons He chooses for other avatarams. For instance, in Vamanaavataaram His Shakthi entered the 'pavithram' that He was adorning. The true form and inherent nature of Sri Sudarashana is difficult to comprehend fully even by sages like Narada (Yath Thathva Bodha: Karthum Nishithamathibhi: Naradaadyaishcha Na Sakya:) May Sri Sudarashana banish all dangers (Dustharam) that are 'Deivaadeenam' and 'Manushyaadeenam'. (Thank you for the meaning www.sadagopan.org)\n\nThe above 76th slokam of Sri Sudarashana Sathakam was given to me by a senior Archaka in Periya Perumal temple in Srirangam. The slokam not only started with \"Vani\" (indicating Veena), the slokam clearly states that Sri Sudarshana becomes the core of the main accessory used by every avataram. As the embodiment of Shakthi and Tejas, residing in the accessory used by the respective avataram. Sri Sudarashana by connecting Himself through the article/accessory becomes the source of power of the avataram.\n\nTherefore, Veena being the source of power (Shakthi and tajas) for all Veena players, chanting of the above enhances the tejas multifold.\n\nBHAGAVANJI SRI VISWAGURU VIDYARANYA SWAMI, NARASARAOPET, GUNTUR DISTRICT, AP.\n\nAbove are a few of available photos of Bhagavanji during various events.\n\n31) PRAANINAAM NARADEYHOYAM MADANUGRAHA HEYTHUKAHA\n\nMAAMEYVOPAASATHEY NITHYAM VIGNYAAYEDAM VIVEYKINAHA.\n\nMeaning- Living beings attain the birth of a human being due to My Grace.
