        "text": "Contents\n\nForeword\n\nDedication\n\nSriman Nityananda Dvadasakam\n\nThe Divine Pastimes of Sri Nityananda Prabhu\n\nThe Glories of Sri Nityananda Prabhu in the Scriptures\n\nKirtans Glorifying Sri Nityananda Prabhu\n\nSri Sri Nityanandastakam\n\nThe Divine Form of Sri Nityananda Prabhu\n\nForeword\n\nI first of all offer my obeisance to all the Vaisnavas aspiring to serve our beloved Spiritual Master, Om Visnupad Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj. I then offer my obeisance at his lotus feet, holding in my heart the faith that he is Lord Nityananda Prabhu’s nondifferent manifestation mercifully extending his shelter to the wayward souls of this world such as my fallen self.\n\nBy the grace of Sri Nityananda Prabhu and the inspiration of Srila Govinda Maharaj, this year’s Nityananda Trayodasi festival marks the inauguration of the newly constructed Sri Hadai Pandit Padmavati Devi Smrti Kunja of the Sree Chaitanya Saraswata Krishnanushilana Sangha in Birchandrapur, West Bengal, the divine appearance place of Lord Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nAt the request of the devotees organising the festivities, this English edition of Sri Sri Nityananda Mahimamrtam has been compiled for the satisfaction of our Spiritual Master, the Vaisnavas, and all those who aspire for the all-important mercy of Nityananda Prabhu. Expanding upon the Math’s Bengali publication Sri Sri Nityananda Mahimamrtam, I have collected an English representation of its original contents and added a novel compilation of Nityananda Prabhu’s divine glories as they have been expressed by His Divine Grace Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj. Moreover, in an effort to represent the ontological method of understanding Nityananda Prabhu’s transcendental identity and Pastimes as taught by Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, I have structured the compilation so as to draw attention to a particular sequence of conceptualisation beginning with spiritual revelation and culminating in loving dispensation. To further this end, also included is a summary study of the revealed scriptures delineating the essential truths about Nityananda Prabhu according to the progression of thought stressed by Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj in his Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam, and explained by Srila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj. My hope is that the attentive readers will imbibe this progressive, faith-yielding, understanding and thereby be moved to invite Nityananda Prabhu’s profound grace and super-excellent gift further into the core of their hearts.\n\nAs I present this offering I must plainly state that any faults or unbecoming aspects of this presentation should only be attributed to my inevitably flawed efforts in compilation, and need never give rise to disrepute for the expressions of our divine guardians. Furthermore, any and all redeeming quality and dedication-inspiring beauty appreciated herein is to be considered the exclusive property of our divine guardians, and all honour must be offered to their self-revealing lotus feet.\n\nIn closing, I must appeal to His Divine Grace Srila Govinda Maharaj for his mercy, his mercy being the only capacity with which I have the potential to be successful in my heart’s endeavour to please him. Moreover, I invoke the blessings of the Vaisnavas and our revered readers with whose goodwill my prayer for the grace of our Spiritual Master may be enriched and realistically realisable. May all be satisfied with this offering.\n\nHumbly,\n\nKamal Krishna Das\n\nSri Nityananda Trayodasi\n\nFebruary 2009\n\nDedication\n\nAn essential collection of\n\nexpressions by our Sri Guru-varga\n\nin glorification of Sri Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nOffered to the lotus hands of\n\nSrila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj\n\non the occasion of the inauguration\n\nof his new ashram at Sri Ekachakra Dham,\n\nSri Nityananda Trayodasi\n\n8 February 2009\n\nSriman Nityananda Dvadasakam\n\nTwelve Prayers Glorifying Sriman Nityananda Prabhu\n\nby Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj\n\nyo ’nanto ’nanta-vaktrair niravadhi hari-samkirtanam samvidhatte\n\nyo va dhatte dharitrim sirasi niravadhi ksudra-dhuli-kaneva\n\nyah sesas chhatra-sayyasana-vasana-vidhaih sevate te yad arthah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [1]\n\n(1) O my heart! Please eternally serve the lotus feet of that beautiful Sri Nityanandachandra, who gives us Gaura Krishna. It is He—Nityananda Prabhu—who in the form of Anantadev perpetually performs Hari-nam-kirtan with infinite mouths; He perpetually holds on His head the earth planet like an insignificant speck of dust; and He performs the divine service of His all-in-all, Krishna, as Sesadev Ananta, taking the forms of the Lord’s paraphernalia such as umbrella, bed, seat, and clothing.\n\namsair yah ksirasayi sakala bhuvanapah sarva jivantarastho\n\nyo va garbhodasayi dasa-sata-vadano veda-suktair vigitah\n\nbramandasesa garbha prakrti-pati-patir jiva-sanghasrayangah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [2]\n\n(2) O my heart! You please eternally serve Sri Nityanandachandra, who gives us Gaura Krishna. He maintains the entire universe in His expansion of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, residing in the hearts of all living beings; His glories are sung by the Vedic hymns as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu of thousands and thousands of heads—Sahasra-sirsa Purusah; within His womb (garbha) unlimited universes are situated; He is the Master of the Lord of material nature—Karanodakasayi Visnu—in whose womb unlimited universes are situated and by whom the entire multitude of souls are sheltered.\n\nyasyamso vyuha-madhye vilasati paramavyomni samkarsanakhya\n\natanvan suddha-sattvam nikhila-hari-sukham chetanam lilaya cha\n\njivahankara-bhavaspada iti kathitah kutrachij jivavad yah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [3]\n\n(3) O my heart, please eternally render divine service to that gracious giver of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra. In the great transcendental kingdom Paravyoma Vaikuntha He expands into the form of Sankarsan of the first quadruple expansion, in which form He ever expands the ecstasy of the divine Pastimes of Sri Hari in the conscious plane of pure existence (suddha-sattva); within the jivas He presides as the ego, and sometimes He shows His divine Pastimes just like an ordinary jiva.\n\nyas chadi vyuha-madhye prabhavati sagano mula-sankarsanakhyo\n\ndvaravatyam tad-urddhe madhupuri vasati prabhavakhyo vilasah\n\nsarvamsi rama-nama vrajapuri ramate sanujo yah svarupe\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [4]\n\n(4) O heart, please constantly serve the dust of the lotus feet of the gracious bestower of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra. It is He who presides in all His glory in Dvaraka with His transcendental associates, as the original all-attractive personality, Mul Sankarsan; above that plane, in Mathura He enjoys His Pastimes in the form known as prabhava-vilas; and in Vraja Puri, He is known as Balaram, the ultimate source of all incarnations, and He sportively plays with His younger brother, His all-in-all—Sri Krishna.\n\nsri-krsna-premanama parama-sukhamayah ko ’py achintyah padartho\n\nyad gandhat sajjanaugha nigama-bahumatam moksam apy aksipanti\n\nkaivalyaisvarya-seva-prada-gana iti yasyangatah prema-datuh\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [5]\n\n(5) My dear heart, please eternally worship that gracious giver of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra. It is He who bestows upon us pure unalloyed divine love for the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna (Sri Krishna-prema), composed of the most supreme and intense ecstasy. The love that He distributes carries an inconceivable import—it is of such ecstasy that the sadhus who may experience only a hint of its fragrance, hatefully cast away all thought of liberation in the ‘One’ as propounded in the Vedas. Furthermore, His Avatars, who bestow the divine love of service in the transcendental majesty of Vaikuntha, are but expansions of His expansion.\n\nyo balye lilayaikah parama-madhuraya chaikachakranagaryam\n\nmata-pitror janana matha nija-suhrdam hladayams chita-chakram\n\ntirthan vabhrama sarvanupahrta-janako nyasina prarthitas cha\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [6]\n\n(6) O my dear heart! Please serve forever the lotus feet of that glorious giver of Gaura Krishna, who is known as Sri Nityanandachandra. When Lord Nityananda Prabhu was a small boy, He performed supremely sweet and charming Pastimes in the village of Ekachakra invoking the deepest heartfelt happiness in His mother, father, relatives, and close friends; and later after a sannyasi arrived at the house of young Nityananda and prayed to Hadai Pandit for his son, Lord Nityananda was placed in the hands of the travelling sadhu and wandered throughout the length and breadth of India visiting sacred places of pilgrimage.\n\nbhramam bhraman cha tirthan yati-mukuta-mani madhavendra prasangat\n\nlabdhollasah pratiksya prakatita-charitam gaura-dhamajagama\n\nsri-gaurah srinivasadibhir api yamavapalaye nandanasya\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [7]\n\n(7) Dear heart, please eternally serve the lotus feet of that wonderful Sri Nityanandachandra, who is the giver of Gaura Krishna! While wandering throughout the holy places, His heart was taken over with ecstasy by the association of the crown jewel of sannyasis Srila Madhavendra Puri, and He came to Gaura Dham, the holy abode of Sri Gauranga. There He waited at the house of Nandan Acharya for the self-revelation of the golden Lord Gaurasundar’s divine Pastimes with His associates headed by Srivas Thakur.\n\npraptajno gaura-chandrad akhila-jana-ganoddhara-nama-pradane\n\nyah prapya dvau surapau kali-kalusa-hatau bhratarau brahma-daityau\n\ngadha-prema prakasaih krta-rudhira-vapus chapi tav ujjahara\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [8]\n\n(8) My heart, please constantly give thyself to the divine service of that gracious bestower of Gaura Krishna, Sri Nityanandachandra! It was He who received the divine instruction from Gaurachandra to deliver all souls by bestowing divine love through the Holy Name. Showing the extremity of His divine love, He delivered those two fallen wine-drinking brahmans (Jagai and Madhai) ruined by the degraded inauspicious nature of Kali-yuga even after they had attacked Him and blood was oozing from His body.\n\nsaksad gauro gananam sirasi yad avadhutasya kaupina-khandam\n\nsamdhartun chadidesasava-yavana-vadhu-sprsta-drsto ’pi vandyah\n\nbrahmadyanam apiti prabhu-parihrta-kanam api svesta-pitah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [9]\n\n(9) Please worship eternally, dear heart, that gracious bestower of Gaura Krishna, Sri Nityanandachandra. Sri Gauranga Mahaprabhu ordered all His beloved followers to accept with worshipful reverence any small piece of the kaupin (loincloth) of Nityananda Prabhu, the topmost of personalities above all social norms and strictures (avadhut). Even if He is seen to touch an immoral drunken woman or yavani, He is nonetheless worshippable by all the gods headed by Brahma. And He is the beloved leader among those exalted devotees who lovingly captivate the heart of Sri Chaitanyadev.\n\nuddhartum jnana-karmady-apahata-charitan gaura-chandro yad asau\n\nnyasam krtva tu maya mrga-manusrtavan grahayan krsna-nama\n\ntach chayevanvadhavat sthala-jala-gahane yo ’pi tasyesta-chestah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [10]\n\n(10) O my heart, please eternally render divine service unto that bestower of Gaura Krishna, Sri Nityanandachandra. Sri Gaurachandra manifested His sannyas-lila for the purpose of delivering the persons of warped logic deviated by exploitation and renunciation (karma and jnan). He delivered them by making them all chant the Holy Name of Krishna. After Mahaprabhu’s acceptance of sannyas, Nityananda Prabhu followed Him faithfully like a shadow wherever He went—over land, jungle, and swamp. Nityananda Prabhu is the fulfiller of the heart’s wishes of Sri Gaurachandra.\n\nsri-radha-prema-lubdho divasa-nisi-tada svada-mattaika-lilo\n\ngauro yan chadidesa svaparikara-vrtam krsna-nama pradatum\n\ngaude ’badham dadau yah subhaga-gana-dhanam gaura-nama-prakamam\n\nsri nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam [11]\n\n(11) Day and night Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was intoxicated, tasting the sweetest love divine in the deep heart of Srimati Radharani. In that condition, He instructed Nityananda Prabhu and His associates to distribute the Holy Name of Krishna, Sri Krishna-nam. But Sri Nityananda Prabhu then went to Gauda Des and profusely distributed the priceless treasure of the true devotees: the Holy Name of Sri Gaura, Sri Gaura-nam. O my dear heart, please give yourself in service forever unto that gracious bestower of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra.\n\nsri-radha-krsna-lila-rasa-madhura-sudhasvada-suddhaika-murtau\n\ngaure sraddham drdham bho prabhu-parikara-samrat prayachchhadhame ’smin\n\nullanghyanghrim hi yasyakhila-bhajana-katha svapnavach chaiva mithya\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram patita-sarana-dam gaura-dam tam bhaje ’ham [12]\n\n(12) Dear Lord, O Nityananda Prabhu, emperor of the associates of Sriman Mahaprabhu! Graciously grant this fallen soul firm and faithful devotion for Sri Gauranga, the supreme embodiment of the taste of the sweet nectar of the ecstasy of Sri Sri Radha-Krishna’s Pastimes. By neglecting the lotus feet of Nityananda Prabhu all sadhana or bhajan—spiritual practices, services, or worship—become an illusion, just like a dream. I worship and adore with all my heart that gracious giver of Sri Gaura, the benevolent bestower of His shelter to the fallen souls—Sri Nityanandachandra.\n\nThe Divine Pastimes of Sri Nityanandachandra\n\nCompiled from lectures of\n\nHis Divine Grace\n\nSrila Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswami Maharaj\n\nSrila Guru Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj, composed a Sanskrit poem glorifying Sri Nityananda Prabhu called the Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam. Within that composition Srila Guru Maharaj gave his explanation about the transcendental identity of Nityananda Prabhu, and not with one sloka, with four slokas of explanation. Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami glorified Nityananda Prabhu in the beginning of his Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta, and all the slokas he wrote referred to Nityananda Prabhu’s existence above the mundane manifestation in the Paravyoma Dham, the spiritual world. I was surprised that Srila Guru Maharaj began his explanation about Nityananda Prabhu in that way with this sloka:\n\nyo ’nanto ’nanta-vaktrair niravadhi hari-samkirtanam samvidhatte\n\nyo va dhatte dharitrim sirasi niravadhi ksudra-dhuli-kaneva\n\nyah sesas chhatra-sayyasana-vasana-vidhaih sevate te yad arthah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam\n\n(Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam: 1)\n\n“O my heart! Please eternally serve the lotus feet of that beautiful Sri Nityanandachandra, who gives us Gaura Krishna. It is He—Nityananda Prabhu—who in the form of Anantadev perpetually performs Hari-nam-kirtan with infinite mouths; He perpetually holds on His head the earth planet like an insignificant speck of dust; and He performs the divine service of His all-in-all, Krishna, as Sesadev Ananta, taking the forms of the Lord’s paraphernalia such as the umbrella, bed, seat, and clothing.”\n\nSrila Guru Maharaj started with this sloka because he was following the main directives of the previous Acharyas. From Vrndavan Das Thakur to Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, and from Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami to Srila Guru Maharaj, we are seeing the line of progress and the speciality of Srila Guru Maharaj.\n\nHis second sloka is above Brahmaloka:\n\namsair yah ksirasayi sakala-bhuvanapah sarva-jivantarastho\n\nyo va garbhodasayi dasa-sata-vadano veda-suktair vigitah\n\nbramandasesa garbha prakrti-pati-patir jiva-sanghasrayangah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam\n\n(Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam: 2)\n\n“O my heart! You please eternally serve Sri Nityanandachandra, who gives us Gaura Krishna. He maintains the entire universe in His expansion of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, residing in the hearts of all living beings; His glories are sung by the Vedic hymns as the Garbhodakasayi Visnu of thousands and thousands of heads—Sahasra-sirsa-purusah; within His womb (garbha) unlimited universes are situated; He is the Master of the Lord of material nature—Karanodakasayi Visnu—in whose womb unlimited universes are situated and by whom the entire multitude of jiva-souls are sheltered.”\n\nyasyamso vyuha-madhye vilasati paramavyomni samkarsanakhya\n\natanvan suddha-sattvam nikhila-hari-sukham chetanam lilaya cha\n\njivahankara-bhavaspada iti kathitah kutrachij jivavad yah\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam\n\n(Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam: 3)\n\n“O my heart, please eternally render divine service to that gracious giver of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra. In the great transcendental kingdom Paravyoma Vaikuntha, He expands into the form of Sankarsan of the first quadruple expansion, in which form He ever expands the ecstasy of the divine Pastimes of Sri Hari in the conscious plane of pure existence (suddha-sattva); within the jivas He presides as the ego, and sometimes He shows His divine Pastimes just like an ordinary jiva.”\n\nThis kind of presentation we see in the style of Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami. Kaviraj Goswami composed five slokas in Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta about Nityananda Prabhu’s identity and divine manifestation as Mulsankarsan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead’s second expansion. And why is it? Because he had felt the divine form of Nityananda Prabhu! He and Vrndavan Das Thakur have tried to give us feelings, transcendental feelings, about Nityananda Prabhu’s super-position. Before we hear about Nityananda Prabhu’s activities we shouldn’t feel anything mundane about Nityananda Prabhu. His character is composed within Goloka Vrndavan of Paravyoma Dham, within the highest aspect of the spiritual world. He is actually the Origin, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, coming down, down, down all the way to the form of Ksirodakasayi Visnu, the Supreme Soul living inside of everything in the material universe. But Nityananda Prabhu is a nondifferent form of Sri Balaram of Goloka Vrndavan and Mulsankarsan of Vaikuntha. Srila Guru Maharaj and the Acharyas want to give this consciousness to the conditioned souls to protect them from making any atmosphere of mundanity.\n\nThen Srila Guru Maharaj continued,\n\nsri-krsna-premanama parama-sukhamayah ko ’py achintyah padartho\n\nyad gandhat sajjanaugha nigama-bahumatam moksam apy aksipanti\n\nkaivalyaisvarya-seva-prada-gana iti yasyangatah prema-datuh\n\nsri-nityananda-chandram bhaja bhaja satatam gaura-krsna-pradam tam\n\n(Sriman Nityananda Dvadasakam: 5)\n\n“My dear heart, please eternally worship that gracious giver of Gaura Krishna—Sri Nityanandachandra. It is He who bestows upon us pure unalloyed divine love for the Supreme Lord Sri Krishna (Sri Krishna-prema), composed of the most supreme and intense ecstasy. The love that He distributes carries an inconceivable import—it is of such ecstasy that the sadhus who may experience only a hint of its fragrance, hatefully cast away all thought of liberation in the ‘One’ as propounded in the Vedas. Furthermore, His Avatars, who bestow the divine love of service in the transcendental majesty of Vaikuntha, are but expansions of His expansion.”\n\nBy the mercy of that Nityananda Prabhu we can very easily get that Krishna-prema which gives us all transcendental happiness, joyfulness, ecstasy, everything! Wherever there is a little bit of that Krishna-prema, all the wealth of the transcendental world appears.\n\nTwo Prabhus and one Mahaprabhu\n\nIn the scriptures it is written:\n\neka mahaprabhu, ara prabhu dui-jana\n\ndui prabhu seve mahaprabhura charana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 7.14)\n\nThere is one ‘Mahaprabhu’. He is the famous Sri Gaurangasundar of Sri Nabadwip Dham, who later became known as Sri Krishna Chaitanya. Advaita Prabhu and Nityananda Prabhu, both are ‘Prabhu’ (Master), but Mahaprabhu is ‘Maha-Prabhu’ (the Supreme Master). Both Advaita Acharya and Nityananda Prabhu very happily served Mahaprabhu and spread His conception of Krishna consciousness throughout the universe during Their divine Pastimes. Advaita Prabhu prayed constantly with tears, Ganges water, and tulasi leaves for Lord Krishna to appear and rescue the fallen souls of Kali-yuga, and Mahaprabhu appeared in answer to His prayer. So Mahaprabhu appeared by the grace of Advaita Prabhu. But before Mahaprabhu appeared, Nityananda Prabhu also appeared and made all the arrangements for rescuing the souls of this world.\n\nYoung Nityananda\n\nNityananda Prabhu was born in Radha Des near Burdwan in the Birbhum district of Bengal in the village of Ekachakra. Later that village became known as Garbhavas and at present is very famously known as Birchandrapur. Virachandra Prabhu was the son of Nityananda Prabhu, and to honour his name the village is famous as Birchandrapur. Gauranga Mahaprabhu also went there, so everyone worships that place. There Nityananda Prabhu took birth as the only son of His mother, Padmavati Devi, and His father, Hadai Pandit Ojha. After Nityananda Prabhu had taken birth, all auspiciousness came to Radha Des. It was enriched so much with Krishna-bhakti. He grew up there with the children of the village, and His Pastimes were all very miraculous. All the children of Ekachakra would play with Nityananda Prabhu, but He would only play Krishna-lila. Just like Balaram played as a child in Vrndavan, Nityananda Prabhu’s childhood very similarly happened in Radha Des as He enacted so many Pastimes of Krishna-lila with the other children of the village. Many wonderful descriptions of that have been given in the scriptures.\n\nTaken by a sannyasi\n\nWhen Nityananda Prabhu was just twelve years old, a sannyasi came to His father’s house. As soon as the sannyasi saw young Nityananda he immediately understood that He was not an ordinary boy and felt he could not leave Nityananda Prabhu’s association. The sannyasi fainted to see Nityananda Prabhu and finally asked His father, Hadai Pandit, “I am going to many pilgrimage places, and it is my prayer that you give this boy to me as an associate servitor.” Hearing this was like a thunderbolt to Hadai Pandit. Hadai Pandit was beside himself to hear this, and he fainted. Nityananda Prabhu was the very joy of his life. At that time religion was very strong within the mind of everyone. It was the custom that if any sannyasi, especially any Vaisnava sannyasi, wants anything, one’s son or even one’s life, the people give it to him. They may give everything to a sannyasi. Nityananda Prabhu was more than life to Hadai Pandit, but that was the custom. Hadai Pandit felt he could never leave his only son Nityananda, but he also felt he could not say, “No, I cannot leave Nityananda.” So finally he considered, “The sannyasi has prayed, and we must fulfil his desire.” He could not deny the sannyasi’s demand, and finally he gave Nityananda Prabhu to that sannyasi.\n\nAfter giving away Nityananda, Hadai Pandit was like a crazy man (loke bale, “Hado Ojha haila pagala” (Cb: Madhya, 3.98).). He became half-mad in separation, and Mother Padmavati fainted, but still they gave away Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nIn this way Nityananda Prabhu left His house when He was twelve years old. His Pastimes were miraculous, and He was an avadhut from childhood. He went with that sannyasi and toured the whole of India. Some say that sannyasi was Madhavendra Puri, and some say he was another sannyasi, but it is certain that later Nityananda met Madhavendra Puri in the pilgrimage places. It is not clear who the sannyasi was, but no doubt he was a great personality, and Nityananda Prabhu served him. Later we know that Nityananda Prabhu and Madhavendra Puri could understand each other easily, and Madhavendra Puri accepted Nityananda Prabhu, by divine will, as his disciple.\n\nWhere is Krishna?\n\nMeeting Madhavendra Puri was a turning point in Nityananda Prabhu’s life, and after that He went to so many pilgrimage places. He saw all the pilgrimage places in the ecstasy of Krishna-prema. Everywhere He went, He gave Krishna-prema, but He Himself was hiding. Nityananda Prabhu was perhaps one year senior in age to Mahaprabhu, and before joining in Mahaprabhu’s Pastimes, Nityananda Prabhu did not reveal much of His actual nature. But He was always thinking Himself to be Balaram, and His activities were like that. He was not hiding that. Finally He went to Vrndavan, where He searched, “Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna?” He asked the Vraja-vasis where He could find Krishna, and Krishna Himself in the form of a human came to Him and said, “I am not here. I have now appeared in a household in Nabadwip.” Then, clearly the feeling manifested within the heart of Nityananda Prabhu: “Now My time has come to join Chaitanyadev—Nimai Pandit—in Nabadwip Dham.” He knew that Nimai Pandit was really Krishna Himself.\n\nThe Avadhut\n\nWhen Sripad Nityananda Prabhu first came to Nabadwip Dham, no one could understand who He was or where He had come from. No one could say whether He was a brahmachari, a grhastha, a vanaprastha, or a sannyasi. People saw all these forms in Him. At that time many people came to criticise Nityananda Prabhu’s divine character because He lived under no rules or regulations. Actually Nityananda Prabhu’s nature was to be an avadhut. The ordinary idea of an avadhut has been given in the Vaisnava-tantra,\n\nantah saktah bahih saivah sabhayam vaisnavo matah\n\nnana vesa-dhara kola vicharanti mahi-tale\n\n“He appears to be internally like a sakta, a worshipper of material energy. Externally he appears like a follower of Lord Siva, but He still participates in the assemblies of Vaisnavas and seems to appreciate Vaisnava thought. He does not care for any particular dress or follow any rules or regulations as He wanders throughout the world.”\n\nBut Nityananda Prabhu was fully transcendental and should never be confused with anyone mundane. His nature as an avadhut can be understood in this way, “In His heart (antah) is playing Radha-Krishna (suddha-saktah), and His form externally (bahih) is like Lord Siva (saivah). When He joins an assembly, His mentality is fully that of a Vaisnava. When He is travelling, sometimes He wears cloth, sometimes He wears no cloth, sometimes He wears many gold ornaments, jewels, and rich garments, and sometimes He wears sannyasi dress.”\n\nReally, avadhut means one who is self-controlled, who is not controlled by scriptural rules or regulations. Whatever He does, that is always right and perfect. He will do anything and everything and is never to be considered wrong. If He is seen to be wrong externally in the eyes of others, then that is also right. Nityananda Prabhu became known by everyone as Avadhut. Everyone called Him Avadhut. The people even forgot that His name was Nityananda. They would say, “Oh, Avadhut is coming.”\n\nWaiting for Nityananda\n\nNityananda Prabhu appeared to the common people as if He were a mad avadhut as He came to Nabadwip. At that time, Mahaprabhu had also come back from Gaya Dham. Mahaprabhu started performing sankirtan every night in Srivas Pandit’s house and showed His Krishna-prema to the devotees’ assembly. Advaita Prabhu declared that Mahaprabhu was Bhagavan. Srivas Pandit, Gadadhar Pandit, and all the devotees everywhere declared that Mahaprabhu was Bhagavan, and Mahaprabhu also showed them that. When the devotees understood the divine form of Mahaprabhu, they were very happy, and they understood that the Lord Himself had appeared for bestowing His mercy to the world through Hari-nam-sankirtan. But Mahaprabhu was not showing His full manifestation as the giver of Krishna-prema. Nobody knew why Mahaprabhu wasn’t widely starting His sankirtan movement, but when Nityananda came they understood the cause of Mahaprabhu’s behaviour. Mahaprabhu had been waiting for Nityananda.\n\nMahaprabhu’s dream\n\nNityananda Prabhu came to Nabadwip searching, “Where is Nimai Pandit? Where is Nimai Pandit?” When He understood that Mahaprabhu was living in Jagannath Misra’s house, He hid Himself in Mayapur to wait and see if Mahaprabhu would discover Him. He went to the house of Mahaprabhu’s dear devotee Nandan Acharya and hid Himself, telling Nandan Acharya, “Do not tell anyone anything. I want to see what Krishna will do.” That morning Mahaprabhu told His devotees,\n\ntala-dhvaja eka ratha—samsarera sara\n\nasiya rahila ratha—amara duyara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Madhya-lila, 3.142)\n\n“Last night I saw in My dream a chariot marked with the flag of a palm tree. It was the chariot of Baladev Himself. Within the chariot there was one Mahapurus, great personage, and He was searching for My house. That chariot came in front of My house, and I saw that Mahapurus. I now think that Baladev Himself has taken the form of a Mahapurus and come to Nabadwip. Go and find out where He is! He must be somewhere in Nabadwip. He has appeared here, and I want to see if He will discover Me.” The devotees searched everywhere, but they could not find Nityananda Prabhu. They were thinking it was simply Mahaprabhu’s dream, and they came back and told Mahaprabhu, “We could not find Him anywhere.” Mahaprabhu said, “It is not only a dream. It is a true dream. Nityananda is very powerful, and He is hiding Himself. It is a very hidden matter, so I shall go to find Him.”\n\nEcstatic embrace\n\nThen Mahaprabhu went directly to Nandan Acharya’s home, and there Mahaprabhu and His devotees saw Nityananda Prabhu seated on the veranda of the house. Nityananda had seen Mahaprabhu come and could not move because His heart was so full of ecstasy and the joy of Krishna-prema. When Mahaprabhu saw Nityananda, His heart was also filled with the joy of Krishna-prema, and He felt very intoxicated. They both fainted. Then Mahaprabhu came forward and embraced Nityananda, and They both fainted again. After some time They regained their senses, and They cried in the name of Krishna. Nityananda Prabhu said, “I went to Vrndavan, but Krishna was not there. Then someone told Me You were here in Nabadwip, so I have come. Now I beg You, ‘Please save Me.’”\n\nNityananda Prabhu surrendered to Mahaprabhu, and Mahaprabhu embraced Nityananda Prabhu with full love, affection, and honour—everything.\n\nBoth Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu took Their divine forms, and the devotees understood that Nityananda Prabhu was not an ordinary sannyasi or ordinary brahmachari. They did not know Nityananda Prabhu at the time, but they saw Mahaprabhu’s expression and Nityananda Prabhu’s expression, and they immediately understood that They had both appeared from the divine abode. In many places in the scriptures it is said that Mahaprabhu is nondifferent from Krishna (abhinna-svarup), and they also considered Nityananda Prabhu in that way.\n\nMahasankirtan\n\nThat was the first day that Nityananda Prabhu joined Mahaprabhu’s party, and up to His last days Nityananda Prabhu preached Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s glories. From that day Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu started mahasankirtan. Mahaprabhu appeared to inaugurate sankirtan-yajna, sacrifice in the form of sankirtan (congregational chanting), as described in the Srimad Bhagavatam:\n\nkrsna-varnam tvisakrsnam sangopangastra-parsadam\n\nyajnaih sankirtana-prayair yajanti hi su-medhasah\n\n(11.5.32)\n\n“In the Age of Kali, persons of fine theistic intellect perform the sacrifice of congregational chanting (sankirtan-yajna) to worship the form of the Lord who constantly sings nothing but the Names of Krishna and describes His glories with great pleasure. He is Krishna Himself appearing in a molten gold complexion born from supreme divine emotion. With His personal beauty, Divine Name, all-merciful nature, and benevolent associates, He destroys the darkness of ignorance in the mundane world.”\n\nMahaprabhu Himself gave the gist of the nature of Hari-nam-sankirtan:\n\ncheto-darpana-marjanam bhava-maha-davagni-nirvapanam\n\nsreyah-kairava-chandrika-vitaranam vidya-vadhu-jivanam\n\nanandambudhi-vardhanam prati-padam purnamrtasvadanam\n\nsarvatma-snapanam param vijayate sri-krsna-sankirtanam\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Antya-lila, 20.12)\n\n[“Sri Krishna-sankirtan cleanses the mirror of consciousness, extinguishes the raging forest fire of material existence, shines moonlight on the evening lotus of good fortune, is the life of the potency of divine knowledge, expands the ocean of ecstasy, is the taste of full nectar at every moment, and soothes the entire self. May Sri Krishna-sankirtan be supremely victorious!”]\n\nThat param vijayate Sri Krsna-sankirtanam, that supremely victorious sankirtan of Mahaprabhu, started with Nityananda Prabhu’s arrival, and in such a glorious way continued day by day in Sri Nabadwip Dham.\n\nMahaprabhu’s preaching party\n\nAlready Advaita Acharya had joined Mahaprabhu. Even before Mahaprabhu, Haridas Thakur very beautifully and intensely preached Krishna consciousness and the Hare Krishna mahamantra. Previously, Haridas Thakur had many tests in his preaching, but ultimately even the Muslim governor came under his influence. Yet when Haridas Thakur saw Mahaprabhu reveal His divine form of a religious preacher, Haridas Thakur joined Mahaprabhu’s mission. Then when Nityananda Prabhu joined in the party of Mahaprabhu, the party of Mahaprabhu took full form. Nityananda Prabhu was always intoxicated with Krishna-prema, with the treasure of Mahaprabhu’s unique gift of divine love. When Nityananda Prabhu joined, Mahaprabhu wanted to publicly preach Krishna consciousness. Haridas Thakur and Nityananda Prabhu were very dear friends, bosom friends. Both were intoxicated with Hari-nam-sankirtan, and Mahaprabhu chose Nityananda Prabhu and Haridas Thakur to begin His preaching programme. He selected them to be like military generals because they could widely, wholeheartedly, and affectionately preach Krishna consciousness in a lovely way.\n\nMahaprabhu’s sacred order\n\nMahaprabhu gave them His preaching line:\n\njagatera pita—krsna, ye na bhaje bapa\n\npitr-drohi patakira janma-janma tapa\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Madhya-lila, 1.202)\n\n“Krishna is the father of the entire universe. Anyone who does not respect his father is rebellious and sinful, and therefore subjected to miseries birth after birth.”\n\nbala krsna, bhaja krsna, laha krsna-nama\n\nkrsna mata, krsna pita, krsna dhana-prana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Madhya-khanda, 13.83)\n\n“Chant Krishna, worship Krishna, and sing the glories of Krishna. Krishna is your mother, Krishna is your father, Krishna is the wealth of your life.”\n\n“suna suna nityananda! suna haridasa!\n\nsarvatra amara ajna karaha prakasa\n\nprati ghare ghare giya kara ei bhiksa\n\n‘bala krsna, bhaja krsna, kara krsna siksa’\n\niha vai ara na baliba balaiba\n\ndina avasane asi amare kahiba\n\ntomara karile biksa, yei, na baliba\n\ntabe ami chakra-haste sabare katiba”\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Madhya-khanda, 13.8–11)\n\n“Listen, listen, Nityananda! Listen, Haridas! Go door to door and tell everyone to practise Krishna consciousness! Tell them, ‘Krishna consciousness is the supreme goal of life,’ tell them, ‘Bala Krishna, bhaja Krishna, kara Krishna siksa: chant the Hare Krishna mahamantra, serve Lord Krishna, and learn the teachings of Sri Krishna.’ You will come back to Me daily in the evening. Nothing else is necessary for you to do. Whoever will take this advice with a clean heart, I shall be their slave, and whoever will be ‘anti’, I shall punish them.” In this way Mahaprabhu gave orders to Nityananda Prabhu and Haridas Thakur, and started His preaching programme.\n\nNityananda Prabhu’s benevolent nature\n\nAt first Nityananda Prabhu and Haridas Thakur started preaching to gentle families without any problems, but then they saw Jagai and Madhai in the road. Jagai and Madhai were prestigious in the city as local administrators of the government, but they were men of very bad character. They were always drinking, eating meat, and doing many wrong things. That day they were drinking in the road in front of everyone. Nityananda Prabhu had a desperate mood, and when He saw Jagai and Madhai seated in the road drinking wine, Nityananda Prabhu told Haridas, “These are the perfect persons to purify with Hari-nam-sankirtan.”\n\nHaridas Thakur was a wise man. He said, “Don’t go there! The whole world is open for You. Why are You going to them? You can preach Mahaprabhu’s conception to everyone. Leave them. They are very bad.”\n\nNityananda Prabhu said, “They are a perfect target. I must rescue them. Then Mahaprabhu’s glory will be more exalted all over the world.”\n\nHaridas was also a little aged. He said, “You can go, but I won’t go. If they will chastise You, You may be able to run away, but I cannot run. So it will be dangerous for me. It is not necessary to go there.” He was testing the mind of Nityananda Prabhu, but Nityananda Prabhu said, “No, this is a first class opportunity for showing the quality of Mahaprabhu’s mercy. You must go with Me.”\n\nThen they went to Jagai and Madhai and said, “O Jagai! O Madhai! You are doing so many things, but if you chant the Hare Krishna mahamantra, you will be rescued.”\n\nJagai and Madhai were drunk. They threatened Nityananda and Haridas, “Oh, You are sannyasis, and You have come here to teach us? We shall teach You! Get out of here. You are nonsense persons. Otherwise we will kill You!” Nityananda again approached them, but they came to beat Nityananda and Haridas. Haridas Thakur couldn’t run away, but he tried. The drunken Jagai and Madhai were unable to run properly, so Nityananda and Haridas got away by some means. Nityananda and Haridas came back, and Haridas reported to Mahaprabhu, “Today somehow I saved my life, but I will not go out again with that pagal (crazy) Nityananda!” Mahaprabhu smiled to hear their report knowing what was to come.\n\nNityananda Prabhu’s determination\n\nThe next day Nityananda Prabhu settled, “I must give Krishna-prema to them.” Nityananda again targeted Jagai and Madhai. Haridas was behind, what could he do? Mahaprabhu had ordered he and Nityananda to preach together. That day they went and again found Jagai and Madhai drinking wine. Nityananda Prabhu said, “Jagai and Madhai, you can do anything, but chant ‘Hare Krishna!’ It is the order of Mahaprabhu.”\n\nWhen Nityananda spoke to them, Madhai was more drunk and said, “Oh, the order of Mahaprabhu! You ran away yesterday, but today again You have come? I’m going to show You!” There was a clay wine pot nearby, and Madhai threw it at the head of Nityananda. The pot cut Him, and with blood falling from His head Nityananda Prabhu said, “This is more of Mahaprabhu’s mercy upon Me”, and He again told them, “You can beat Me more and more, it is okay. It is not a problem. You have hit Me, but I shall excuse that. I forgive you. But you chant ‘Hare Krishna!’ It is the order of Mahaprabhu. Without a doubt you will be rescued. Mahaprabhu said, ‘Bala Krishna, bhaja Krishna, kara Krishna siksa.’ You please take this religion of Mahaprabhu.”\n\nMadhai said, “Now again You are coming to me! You are so energetic. I am going to show You! I shall teach You!” Then again Madhai took a clay wine pot and went to throw it at Nityananda Prabhu, but his brother Jagai took his hand and told him, “Nonsense! Why are you chastising this pagal sadhu? He is a sannyasi. It is not necessary to hit Him again. Why you are behaving like this? It is nonsense. Leave Him alone!” In this wa Jagai made some good comments and stopped him.\n\nMahaprabhu’s anger\n\nIn the meantime Haridas had gone back and given news to Mahaprabhu about what had happened: that Nityananda Prabhu had been hit and that He did not want to come back as He was determined to give Hari-nam and Krishna-prema to Jagai and Madhai. Mahaprabhu went there with His full battalion, and He saw the blood on Nityananda Prabhu’s head. Mahaprabhu was very angry. He forgot His mundane appearance, and He called for His Sudarsan chakra (‘Chakra, chakra, chakra’—Prabhu dake ghane ghane’ (Cb: Madhya, 13.185)): “Chakra! Chakra! Chakra!” He called out again and again. He wanted to cut off the heads of Jagai and Madhai. Everyone saw the chakra following behind Mahaprabhu as He chastised Jagai and Madhai, “I shall kill you! You have dealt wrongly with Nityananda Prabhu.”\n\nNityananda Prabhu grasp the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu and said, “What are You doing? This is not Dvapar-yuga. It is Kali-yuga. Here tolerance and humility are necessary. If You want to bestow Your mercy upon others, through tolerance and humility You can do that. You cannot use the chakra in this Avatar. This Avatar is not for that.”\n\nMahaprabhu said, “I cannot tolerate this type of activity of the demons.”\n\nNityananda replied, “But both of them are not offenders. Madhai is an offender; he hit Me. But Jagai rescued Me from him. One saved Me from the other’s stupidity.”\n\nMahaprabhu’s sympathy\n\nAfter hearing that Jagai saved Nityananda, Mahaprabhu excused Jagai. Jagai took the Hare Krishna mahamantra and bowed down, thinking of his previous karma. He grasped the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu and said, “Mahaprabhu, please forgive my offences. There is no other way for me.” Mahaprabhu embraced Jagai, and Jagai received Krishna-prema.\n\nThe circumstances were very heavy, but Madhai also became a little conscious by seeing Jagai’s activities. Madhai said, “I have done so much sinful work, and Jagai has got relief from all his sins. Why not me?” Nityananda Prabhu said, “Mahaprabhu, please forgive their offences.” Then Madhai grasped the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu, but Mahaprabhu said, “I cannot do the same for you as I did for Jagai. You go to Nityananda Prabhu. If He will give you forgiveness, then you will get My embrace. Otherwise, it is impossible for Me to accept you. If Nityananda Prabhu will give you forgiveness, you will get that result of the Hare Krishna mahamantra.”\n\nThen Madhai took Nityananda Prabhu’s lotus feet. Nityananda Prabhu embraced Madhai, and then Mahaprabhu embraced Madhai and his sins were cleared. Jagai and Madhai became pure devotees, and they cried so much, “We have done so much wrong” and so on. Jagai and Madhai then chanted ‘Hare Krishna’ and danced with Krishna-prema.\n\nPatit Pavan Nityananda\n\nTo see Mahaprabhu’s Pastimes as the rescuer of the conditioned souls, the general people were very astonished, and they glorified Mahaprabhu so much. Mahaprabhu said to Jagai and Madhai,\n\nprabhu bale,—“tora ara na karis papa”\n\njagai madhai bale,—“ara nare vapa”\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Madhya-khanda, 13.225)\n\n“Jagai and Madhai, if you do not do this again, and you leave behind the activities you did before, I can forgive your offences forever. From this day you try to practise Krishna consciousness, and you will be so glorious. Now chant ‘Hare Krishna!’”\n\nJagai and Madhai said, “Ara nare vapa: we will never do that again. You have excused us. We will follow what You say as our duty.” Jagai and Madhai then asked Mahaprabhu, “Please give some service to us and accept us as Your servitors.” Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu said, “You chant ‘Hare Krishna’, give this Hare Krishna mahamantra to everyone, and do Vaisnava-seva by sweeping the pathway by the Ganges and keeping it clean. Then with a clean heart you can proceed. You will have no need to fear Yamaraj.” Jagai and Madhai did that every day, and the place where they swept is still known as Madhai Ghat. Our parikrama party crosses the Ganges at that place. All the demigods danced to see the rescue of Jagai and Madhai. All the Pastimes of Nityananda Prabhu and Mahaprabhu are for rescuing the conditioned souls, and in Their Pastime of rescuing Jagai and Madhai we can see that Nityananda Prabhu is more merciful than even Mahaprabhu.\n\nThe ever-worshippable Nityananda\n\nNityananda Prabhu’s character was like that of an intoxicated madman. He was physically very strong like Lord Balaram. If He saw a bull in the road, He would charge the bull and jump over him or hop on his back and ride him. He would jump in and swim with crocodiles in the Ganges even after He’d seen crocodiles swimming there. Sometimes He would visit the house of Srivas Pandit and take breast milk from his wife. Nityananda Prabhu had so many miraculous characteristics! Sometimes Nityananda Prabhu would come to Sachi Mata’s house unaware that He was naked. It happened many days, and like a child He would call, “Where is Krishna? Where is Krishna?” On one occasion Mahaprabhu said, “Oh! You have no cloth! Why are You naked?” Nityananda Prabhu said, “Oh! I did not know I was naked!”\n\nAt that time Mahaprabhu was talking with Visnu Priya Devi and many devotees who were present, and they were very surprised to see Nityananda Prabhu’s naked form. Mahaprabhu gave some cloth to Nityananda Prabhu and then divided His kaupin (undergarment) into many pieces. Mahaprabhu then distributed the pieces to all His devotees and told them, “Worship this piece of underwear every day because by Nityananda Prabhu’s connection you will be rescued from everything. You will have no fear of illusion. You can do anything, but if you chant the Holy Name of ‘Nityananda’, you will get relief from all disturbances.” Mahaprabhu Himself then further glorified Nityananda Prabhu with this sloka,\n\nmadira yavani yadi nityananda dhare\n\ntathapi brahmara vandya kahila tomare\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Antya-khanda, 6.123)\n\n“Nityananda Prabhu can do anything and everything. Even if you see Nityananda Prabhu mixing with very bad society, if you see Him intoxicated with a drunken woman in one arm and a bottle of wine in His other arm, know that He has divine character. If Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe, sees Him at that time, he falls down and pays full dandavat pranams with his four heads to the lotus feet of Nityananda Prabhu.” This is Nityananda Prabhu’s inconceivable divine character. He was the protector of the society of Mahaprabhu Chaitanyadev. He was all-in-all.\n\nMahaprabhu took sannyas\n\nEvery day sankirtan continued with the Pancha Tattva and Haridas Thakur in Sri Nabadwip Dham. The Pancha Tattva means,\n\nsri-krsna-chaitanya prabhu-nityananda\n\nsri-advaita gadadhara srivasadi-gaura-bhakta-vrnda\n\n(Sri Pancha Tattva mahamantra)\n\nEvery day Mahaprabhu, Nityananda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, Gadadhar Pandit, Srivas Thakur, and all the other devotees of Mahaprabhu led thousands of people in Hari-nam-sankirtan, and the Pancha Tattva distributed the Hari-nam mahamantra in this mundane world. Chad Kazi was delivered, and so many things happened in Nabadwip. At one function Mahaprabhu gave permission for Nityananda Prabhu to hold a Vyasa Puja ceremony. Nityananda Prabhu did that puja, but He gave the final garland to Mahaprabhu, thereby showing Mahaprabhu’s glories. Mahaprabhu chanted the Holy Name of Lord Krishna: Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. This was Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s preaching, but more than that, He was the nondifferent form of the Hare Krishna mahamantra—He was the nondifferent form of Sri Sri Radha-Krishna.\n\nSri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu bestowed His mercy upon the general people, and He wanted to rescue the souls all over the world. To do this He decided, “I shall take sannyas.” Nityananda Prabhu is the main pillar of Mahaprabhu’s preaching of Krishna consciousness, and when Mahaprabhu took sannyas, Nityananda Prabhu accompanied Him. Mahaprabhu circled Radha Des for three days, and Nityananda Prabhu eventually brought Him to Advaita Acharya’s house. Sachi Mata, Advaita Acharya, and the other devotees gave their overflowing Krishna-prema to the people. Then Mahaprabhu went to Puri. Nityananda Prabhu stayed with Mahaprabhu like a guardian. Nityananda Prabhu had travelled before, and He recited the glories of Saksi Gopal for Mahaprabhu as They travelled to Puri.\n\nWhy do You need a danda?\n\nJust before entering Puri Dham, Mahaprabhu bathed in the river at Atharanala. While He was bathing, Nityananda Prabhu broke Mahaprabhu’s sannyas danda. It was an eka-danda. Nityananda Prabhu broke it into three pieces and threw it in the river. Mahaprabhu had taken sannyas, and He showed in His Pastimes great care in following the rules and regulations of a sannyasi very strictly. He showed His anger to Nityananda Prabhu and said, “I have only one possession, My sannyas danda, and You have broken that and thrown it away!” Nityananda Prabhu did not care about anything. He said, “Why do You need to carry a danda? You are Krishna Himself. What need do You have for a danda?” Mahaprabhu said, “I do not want to travel with you all. I shall go alone. Will you all go first, or I shall go first?” They replied, “You go first, and we shall go behind.” Then Mahaprabhu very quickly ran to Lord Jagannath and fainted in Jagannath’s Temple. Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya took His body to his home. Nityananda Prabhu immediately assessed the situation and understood that Mahaprabhu was at Sarvabhauma Bhattacharya’s house. He went to Sarvabhauma’s house, met with Mahaprabhu, and later He went to see Lord Jagannath. In this way Mahaprabhu started preaching in Puri Dham with Nityananda Prabhu and others.\n\nNityananda Prabhu: The merciful Lord of all souls\n\nNityananda Prabhu accepted everyone, but Mahaprabhu would chastise those who were offensive. Mahaprabhu showed some caution in distributing Krishna-nam and Krishna-prema. Mahaprabhu followed the rules and regulations of sannyas life very strictly, and because of this Mahaprabhu could not give shelter to offenders. When Mahaprabhu went to South India He took Kaliya Krishnadas with Him. In Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta he is referred to as Kala Krishnadas. On their tour, Kaliya Krishnadas suffered some disturbance with some women, and Mahaprabhu rescued him from that. Later when they returned to Jagannath Puri, Mahaprabhu said, “I want to leave this boy Kaliya Krishnadas. He was irresponsible and greatly disturbed our mission. I don’t want to keep him with Me. I don’t want to be responsible for him.” Kaliya Krishnadas, as an eternal parsad devotee (of Sri Nityananda Prabhu), played this role in the Lord’s drama. At that time Nityananda Prabhu did not leave him. He told Mahaprabhu, “If You do not want to keep him, it is no problem, I will take him. I will send him to Nabadwip to give news to Sachi Mata and the other devotees that You have come back from South India.”\n\nIn this way Nityananda Prabhu showed His extreme mercy, and Kaliya Krishnadas spent the rest of his life with Nityananda Prabhu. So even when Mahaprabhu is angry, Nityananda Prabhu keeps devotees at His lotus feet. The conditioned souls can have much hope when they see the very deep and merciful character of Sri Nityananda Prabhu.\n\n“Liberate Bengal!”\n\nMahaprabhu lived in Puri Dham with a limited group of His exclusive devotees. Mahaprabhu had so many devotees, but they would come to visit Puri for a few months every year. One year Nityananda Prabhu came to Puri Dham with so many of His followers, the dvadas-gopals, the avatars of the twelve cowherd boys of Vrndavan. They had all been preaching in Bengal, and after their visit Mahaprabhu ordered Nityananda Prabhu, “Go to Radha Des and preach there. I have sent Rupa-Sanatan to Upper India. I shall see to South India. You look after East India. This is our preaching strategy. You are not to come back here to Puri Dham. I will be with You everywhere. Whenever You remember Me, I shall appear wherever You are. So it is not necessary for You to come here every year. Please go to Radha Des and preach.” Then Nityananda Prabhu went back to Bengal with all His followers, first to Santipur, then to Nabadwip, and from there to other places. He preached all over Bengal.\n\nNityananda Prabhu: the highest distributer of Gaura-prema!\n\nBoth Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu were born in brahman families. Mahaprabhu maintained the rules and regulations of sannyas life and preached Krishna consciousness. He distributed the Hare Krishna mahamantra to everyone and revealed Radha-Krishna-prema in this world. Mahaprabhu always wanted to give Krishna-prema to the fallen souls who were not offensive. But Nityananda Prabhu’s preaching was different. He did not care for external formality.\n\npreme matta nityananda krpa-avatara\n\nuttama, adhama, kichhu na kare vichara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.208)\n\nNityananda Prabhu was always intoxicated with Gaura-prema, intoxicated with the Name of Sriman Mahaprabhu. He knew only Mahaprabhu, and He distributed Mahaprabhu in an intoxicated mood of devotion. If anyone would take shelter of Nityananda Prabhu, He would be very merciful to him. Nityananda Prabhu would not look at who was a good man or who was a bad man. If anyone wanted to take shelter in the shade of His lotus feet, He would immediately shelter them and send them to Gauranga Mahaprabhu. He would engage them in the service of Mahaprabhu. If anyone would once chant “Jay Sachi Nandan! Jay Gaurahari!”, Nityananda Prabhu would think, “I am his slave. I will give him everything.” Who was fallen, who was not fallen, who was bad, who was good—He made no consideration. Many times Mahaprabhu gave many conditions, but Nityananda Prabhu had no conditions. He only begged, “Surrender to Chaitanyadev, surrender to Gaurangadev, surrender to Nimai Visvambhar, and you will be rescued!”\n\nNityananda Prabhu looked at a person’s faith. Anywhere He saw the light of faith within someone He would bestow His mercy. Faith is the very foundation and gist of spiritual life. There was only difficulty for faithless persons, but Nityananda Prabhu is so merciful that when He found persons without faith, He would supply faith to them. He would give them true spiritual property. In this way Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy truly goes everywhere! Even where sunlight does not go, there also Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy goes. In this way He gave something even more than Mahaprabhu! That is Nityananda Prabhu’s divine character and supreme gift.\n\nNityananda Prabhu’s preaching was actually Gaura consciousness. His preaching was the glorification of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Nityananda Prabhu distributed Mahaprabhu Himself. Nityananda Prabhu’s mantram and preaching style was:\n\nbhaja gauranga kaha gauranga laha gaurangera nama\n\nye jana gauranga bhaje sei haya amara prana\n\n“Chant the Divine Name of Gauranga Mahaprabhu! Whoever worships Lord Gauranga is My life and soul. Whoever practises Krishna consciousness under the guidance of Gauranga Mahaprabhu is My life and soul.”\n\nIn this way Nityananda Prabhu preached, and His preaching was so successful. Nityananda Prabhu was very merciful to whoever took shelter of Mahaprabhu—He would give them all the wealth of Gaura-prema. This was the character of Nityananda Prabhu. Thousands and thousands of people came to the lotus feet of Nityananda, and He made them all the devotees of Gauranga Mahaprabhu. All over the world people are chanting Mahaprabhu’s Name and Krishna’s Name. It is only by the blessings of Nityananda Prabhu that this has happened. Without His mercy it would not be possible.\n\nNityananda’s indispensable mercy\n\nWithout the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, no one will get Krishna-prema. Without the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, one will not proceed even one inch in their spiritual life. There are so many examples in the scriptures that illustrate this. A prominent example of Nityananda Prabhu’s all-important mercy is Srila Raghunath Das Goswami. Raghunath Das Goswami was a young prince married to a beautiful young girl, and he was incredibly wealthy. But Raghunath Das had an extremely renounced mentality although he had so much property. Both his father and his uncle wanted to give all their riches and property to him for his benefit, but he did not want any of it. He only wanted the mercy of Mahaprabhu and Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nMany times Raghunath Das tried to leave his family life to join Mahaprabhu’s group, but he was always unsuccessful. His father was determined to prevent him from leaving and used all his strength and influence to do this. Security guards and accomplished fighters were employed to keep him at home, so he was unable to leave. He wanted nothing but to go to the lotus feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and he wanted to leave everything, but he was forcefully restrained.\n\nThen one day Nityananda Prabhu came to Panihati. Raghunath Das Goswami’s father’s house was perhaps only seven miles or so from there, and seeing this opportunity he told his father, “My dear father, Nityananda Prabhu has come nearby, and I want to go and worship Him.” His father said, “Yes, that is not a difficulty. If you will not run away from home, then you can go.” So Raghunath Das went to Nityananda Prabhu, and Nityananda Prabhu saw him from afar and in a joking mood said, “I shall punish you today.” Then Raghunath Das Goswami asked, “Yes Prabhu, what is Your punishment? Please give it to me. I shall accept it happily.” Nityananda Prabhu blessed him, saying, “Yes, now you have come to Me, and now you will get relief. I will arrange for you to leave your mundane condition. But before that I have one condition. With Me are a thousand devotees. Feed make a feast here and feed them today. I want to see that. If the devotees are satisfied, then I will give My blessings to you.”\n\nChida Dadhi Mahotsav\n\nRaghunath Das Goswami was very happy. Raghunath Das was rich, and he immediately arranged dadhi (yoghurt), chida (flat rice), milk, ksir, sandes, rasagullas, mangos, bananas, and so many other foods. Everyone honoured all of these in clay pots. Raghunath Das arranged so much prasadam for thousands and thousands of Nityananda Prabhu’s followers. He fed all the devotees there very nicely. So many people were gathered on the banks of the Ganges, and the place was so full, that some people were even standing in the Ganges while they ate.\n\nNityananda Prabhu personally invited Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and Mahaprabhu came there in His subtle form and accepted prasadam with Nityananda Prabhu and His devotees. Raghunath Das fed all the devotees there, and not only that, he gave pranami to them all in the form of gold coins. According to their positions all the devotees were given pranami. Nityananda Prabhu was given the largest quantity of gold coins, then Raghava Pandit, and then the general devotees. Everyone got some money from Raghunath Das. That festival became very famous. It is known as the Chida Dadhi Mahotsav, the yoghurt and chipped rice festival, which enabled Raghunath Das to enter into Chaitanya-lila.\n\nNityananda Prabhu was so happy that He put His lotus feet on the head of Raghunath Das Goswami, and blessed him: “Now your samsara will be dissolved. You will be clean and free from your family life. I am giving you entrance. You will get Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Now go back to your house. All of your bondage is now gone, and you will soon come to the lotus feet of Chaitanyadev.”\n\nNityananda’s fruitful blessing\n\nRaghunath Das went back to his house, but from then onwards he did not enter the third zone of the house. In those days, in rich people’s homes, there were three zones. The women lived in the third zone. In the second zone lived the masters’ rank, and in the first zone lived all others. After receiving Nityananda Prabhu’s blessing, Raghunath Das stayed only in the first zone of his father’s house. But still his father kept twelve guards around him. Then one day, by the grace of Nityananda Prabhu, he got an opportunity, and he escaped. From his home it took Raghunath Das twelve days to reach Mahaprabhu in Puri Dham, and almost the whole time, day and night, he ran to reach there. That is another history. The point is that by the grace of Nityananda Prabhu, Raghunath Das Goswami got relief from family life and attained the service of Sri Chaitanyadev.\n\nBefore he met Nityananda Prabhu he could not leave his samsara, but by the blessing of Nityananda Prabhu he attained Mahaprabhu’s lotus feet. And even more than that, Mahaprabhu accepted him as His exclusive servitor and gave him the position as one of the pillars of His conception. He became the Prayojan-tattva-acharya, the exemplary distributor of the topmost perfection of Mahaprabhu’s highest service ideal. He showed the world the ultimate destination, the very summum bonum of life.\n\nDivine fortune\n\nRaghunath Das Goswami expressed his feelings of divine fortune,\n\nnama-srestham manum api sachi-putram atra svarupam\n\nrupam tasyagrajam uru-purim mathurim gostha-vatim\n\nradha-kundam giri-varam aho radhika-madhavasam\n\nprapto yasya prathita-krpaya sri-gurum tam nato ’smi\n\n(Sri Mukta-charitam: 2)\n\n“I bow down to the lotus feet of Sri Guru, by whose causeless mercy I have attained the highest conception of the Holy Name and the divine mantra. I have come to the service of the great saviour, Sri Sachi Nandan, who is like a golden mountain standing to show the direction of Krishna-lila, and the association of His most intimate servitor Srila Svarup Damodar. I gained the association of Srila Rupa Goswami, who was personally ordered by Mahaprabhu Himself to distribute the rasa of spontaneous devotion, and Sanatan Goswami, who revealed to the world perfect sambandha-jnan, proper acquaintance with the environment. I have been given the divine abode of Mathura Vrndavan with Radha Kunda and Govardhan Hill. And finally I have been given the hope and aspiration that one day I may be welcomed into the service plane where Sri Sri Radhika-Madhava are in Their glory, sitting and playing.”\n\nTaking a stand\n\nThis sloka of Srila Raghunath Das Goswami is also the expression of Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami. He also felt, “Nityananda Prabhu has so mercifully given me the dust of His lotus feet, and so I have become Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami. I am a very fallen soul, but, by the grace of Nityananda Prabhu, I have got everything. Now I am truly a rich man because Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunath have given me their mercy, and they have accepted me as their servitor.” In this way Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami described his real wealth. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami also prayed to Nityananda Prabhu just as Raghunath Das did.\n\nKrishnadas Kaviraj Goswami lived with his brother’s family in Jhamatpur near Katwa in Bengal. One night there was a successful sankirtan festival happening at their home, and his brother was very happy. One of Nityananda Prabhu’s leading disciples, Minaketan Ramdas, came to the sankirtan, and his brother did not give proper honour to him. His brother did not have full faith in Nityananda Prabhu, and by failing to honour Minaketan Ram Das, he made some offence to Nityananda Prabhu. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami became very angry with his brother and chastised him: “You are giving honour to Chaitanyadev, but not to Nityananda Prabhu? You do not have faith in Nityananda Prabhu? You have done wrong! Your spiritual life will be spoiled by this! You are very offensive, and I do not want to stay here with you anymore!” Kaviraj Goswami said many things in glorification of Nityananda Prabhu, and Minaketan Ram Das left angrily from Kaviraj Goswami’s house.\n\nKaviraj Goswami received Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy because he tried to satisfy His servitor Minaketan Ram Das.\n\nNityananda appears in a dream\n\nNityananda Prabhu was so happy with Kaviraj Goswami, and that night, very close to early morning, Nityananda Prabhu appeared before Krishnadas in his dream. Kaviraj Goswami expertly expressed his vision of Nityananda Prabhu’s divine form in his Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta. Nityananda Prabhu mercifully gave His blessings to Kaviraj Goswami and told him,\n\nare are krsnadasa, na karaha bhaya\n\nvrndavane yaha,—taha sarva labhya haya\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.195)\n\n“I am very happy with you. You have nothing to fear. It is My blessing to you that you will leave this house and family life and go to Vrndavan. There you will attain everything by My grace. You will get the exclusive service of Radha-Krishna in Vrndavan.”\n\n“I have received everything!”\n\nIn the morning Kaviraj Goswami immediately left his house and ran to Vrndavan. In Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta he glorified the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu so much: “Nityananda Prabhu has given me everything! By the grace of Nityananda Prabhu, I have received Vrndavan Dham. He ordered me, ‘Go to Vrndavan, and there you will receive your super benefit.’ When I came to Vrndavan, I received the lotus feet of Radha–Madan Mohan, Radha-Govinda, and Radha-Gopinath. And all the Vaisnavas, those who were alive and those who were no longer alive, I received mercy from them all! And the supermost devotees of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu—Srila Rupa Goswami, Srila Sanatan Goswami, Srila Jiva Goswami, and Srila Raghunath Das Goswami—I have received the foot-dust and mercy of all the goswamis. Very exclusively they have embraced me, and particularly I have the mercy of Srila Raghunath Das Goswami and Srila Rupa Goswami.”\n\nHumility attracts mercy\n\nWhen Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami composed Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta he concluded every chapter with the idea,\n\nsri-rupa-raghunatha-pade yara asa\n\nchaitanya-charitamrta kahe krsna-dasa\n\nWithout the mercy of Sri Rupa and Sri Raghunath, we cannot understand Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and without the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, we cannot enter into Chaitanya-lila or Vrndavan-lila. Nitaiyer koruna habe, Vraje Radha-Krishna pabe: if you will receive the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, then simultaneously you will get the mercy of all the Vaisnavas and Mahaprabhu Sri Chaitanyadev. Everything is depending upon the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu. Really it is the truth that Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami is the most worshippable master in the Sri Chaitanya sampradaya. Kaviraj Goswami was a very high standard Vaisnava, but still he was very humble and tolerant. In his Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta he said,\n\njagai madhai haite muni se papistha\n\npurisera kita haite muni se laghistha\n\nmora nama sune yei tara punya ksaya\n\nmora nama laya yei tara papa haya\n\nemana nirghrna more keba krpa kare\n\neka nityananda vinu jagat bhitare\n\npreme matta nityananda krpa-avatara\n\nuttama, adhama, kichhu na kare vichara\n\nye age padaye, tare karaye nistara\n\nataeva nistarila mo-hena durachara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.205–209)\n\n“I am more sinful than Jagai and Madhai and even lower than worms in stool. Anyone who hears my name loses the benefit of his pious activities. Anyone who utters my name becomes sinful. Who in this world but Nityananda Prabhu could show His mercy to such an abominable person as me? Although I am without a doubt the most fallen and abominable, I have taken shelter of Nityananda Prabhu’s lotus feet, and He has embraced me, and given all spiritual wealth to me. Preme matta Nityananda: He is always intoxicated with Krishna-prema and Gaura-prema, and He is not considering who is good or who is bad. If anyone will fall down before His lotus feet, He will give His full mercy to him, and he will receive Krishna-prema. That is the style of Nityananda.”\n\nExalted by mercy\n\nWhen Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami came to Vrndavan, he found the association of hundreds of Vaisnavas following the line of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. All the Vaisnavas requested Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami to narrate the Pastimes of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Previously many Vaisnavas had written about Mahaprabhu’s character and teachings, but when they heard from Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami, all the Vaisnavas in Vrndavan received very, very new light. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami gave completely unique meanings of slokas from Srimad Bhagavatam and new light about Mahaprabhu’s divine feelings in His final Pastimes which no one before him could express. When the Vaisnavas of Vrndavan heard such exclusive description of Mahaprabhu’s character, they were astonished. By the grace of Nityananda Prabhu and by the mercy of Rupa Goswami, Raghunath Das Goswami, and Sanatan Goswami, Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami was so exalted in Vrndavan at that time.\n\nKrishnadas Kaviraj Goswami had heard from Raghunath Das Goswami about the final Pastimes of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In Puri Dham, Raghunath Das Goswami stayed with Mahaprabhu and observed everything about the character of Sri Chaitanyadev. Srila Rupa Goswami also stayed with Mahaprabhu in Puri for some time and was fully empowered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Raghunath Das later came and stayed with Srila Rupa Goswami in Vrndavan and heard from him. When Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami heard from Raghunath Das Goswami, he received everything about Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, especially the final Pastimes of the Lord.\n\nNityananda’s last disciple\n\nStill, the whole society of Sri Chaitanyadev’s followers, the six goswamis, and all the Vaisnavas in Vrndavan, were already extremely satisfied with Vrndavan Das Thakur’s Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. Vrndavan Das Thakur presented unlimited glorification of Sri Chaitanyadev’s Pastimes in his Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami expressed the final Pastimes of Chaitanya-lila in his Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta, but he never crossed the prestige of Vrndavan Das Thakur. He gave full honour to Vrndavan Das Thakur. Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami wrote many times in Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta:\n\nchaitanya-lilara vyasa—vrndavana-dasa\n\n(Adi-lila, 8.34)\n\n“I am not Vyasa. Vrndavan Das Thakur is the avatar of Vedavyas in Chaitanya-lila.”\n\nVrndavan Das Thakur was the last direct disciple of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. Vrndavan Das Thakur lived in Mamagachhi and later by the order of Nityananda Prabhu went to Denur, where he spent his final days composing the Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. There he revealed the Pastimes of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. He was greatly attached to the Pastimes of Nityananda Prabhu though, and he first glorified Nityananda Prabhu so much. In an intoxicated mood of devotion he described Nityananda Prabhu’s Pastimes very widely. We are surprised to hear it, and we feel it to be a miracle. He is revealing Mahaprabhu’s Pastimes, but he is glorifying Nityananda Prabhu so greatly. It is a miracle, and we feel his book could also be called Nityananda-bhagavat. We are so happy when we are reading the Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. We cannot believe how sweet it is. Srila Prabhupad Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur wrote in his Gaudiya-bhasya,\n\nsri-chaitanya-bhagavata grantha suddha-bhakti-mata\n\nkahe sada sri-bhaktivinoda\n\nnirantara patha-phale kubuddhi yaibe cha’le\n\nkrsna-preme labhibe pramoda\n\n“Bhakti Vinod Thakur has taught that Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat is a suddha-bhakti grantha [a treatise on pure devotion]. It is like the Ganges flowing from above to below, and nothing—no misconception or unfortunate influence—can stand in its way. By regularly reading Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat one will attain the joy of Krishna-prema.”\n\nNityananda Prabhu’s exclusive follower\n\nBy the grace of Vrndavan Das Thakur we can understand the Pastimes of both Nityananda Prabhu and Mahaprabhu. But there are always a few who are not attracted by Vrndavan Das Thakur’s Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. He has glorified Nityananda Prabhu in such an intoxicated mood, and he cannot tolerate those who have no faith in Lord Nityananda. Sometimes he appears very intolerant:\n\neta parihare o ye papi ninda kare\n\ntabe lathi maro ta’ra sirera upare\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.225, 17.158)\n\n“If any sinful person disregards the glories of Lord Nityananda and dares criticise Him, I will kick his head with my left foot!”\n\nPrabhupad Srila Saraswati Thakur has explained that by this expression Vrndavan Das Thakur is giving unfavourable persons a new chance to come to the lotus feet of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. If someone is apparently mistreated by the Lord’s devotee, that will attract the special mercy of the Lord to them. Vrndavan Das Thakur fought with the demonic brahman society, and externally his Pastimes appear very hard. From different corners he met many obstacles, but he crossed over everything through his devotional activity, his devotional mood, and the special mercy of Nityananda Prabhu. Sometimes Nityananda Prabhu even appeared personally in the body of Vrndavan Das Thakur and bestowed mercy upon the conditioned souls.\n\nVyas of Chaitanya-lila\n\nVrndavan Das Thakur glorified the Pastimes of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu greatly, but he also mentioned that in the future they would be more fully revealed. In many places in Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat Vrndavan Das Thakur mentioned, “What I am expressing, it will be fully expressed in the future when Vedavyas appears. I am not Vedavyas. Vedavyas will come, and he will give you the Pastimes of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.” But in Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami said, “No. Vrndavan Das Thakur really is Vedavyas. He has truly revealed Chaitanya-lila. What he has willingly left unexpressed, the final Pastimes of Mahaprabhu, that I am describing here in Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta.” So Vrndavan Das Thakur said, “Vyas will come in the future”, and Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami said, “Vrndavan Das Thakur is Vedavyas”. We also see that Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami became Vyasdev. He revealed the final Pastimes of Mahaprabhu and fulfilled Vrndavan Das Thakur’s prediction.\n\nBy the mercy of Srila Guru Maharaj we have got some light from these expressions, and come to the realisation that both are Vedavyas. First is Vrndavan Das Thakur, who was mentioned by Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami as the Vyas of Chaitanya-lila. And second is Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami because he also expanded Chaitanya-lila and very scrutinisingly and finely gave us the revelation of the final portion of Chaitanya-lila. Vrndavan Das Thakur’s style was overflooded with enthusiasm, and Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami’s style was very fine and authentic. I composed two slokas about the two Vyasas—Srila Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami and Vrndavan Das Thakur—when we published Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta.\n\ndasa-vrndavanam vande krsna-dasa-prabhum tatha\n\nchhannavatara-chaitanya-lila-vistara-karinau\n\ndvau nityanandapadabja-karunarenu-bhusitau\n\nvyakta-chhannau budhachintyau vavande vyasa-rupinau\n\n“I bow to Vrndavan Das Thakur and Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami. They have revealed the hidden Pastimes of Lord Krishna.” Krishna is known as Tri-yuga in Srimad Bhagavatam because He only appears openly in three ages, and He is covered in the Kali-yuga (chhannah kalau yad abhavas Tri-yugo ’tha sa tvam (SB: 7.9.38)). In Kali-yuga He appears in a hidden way (chhanna) as His own devotee, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Chhanna-avatar [hidden Avatar]. So Chaitanya-lila is the hidden Pastimes of Lord Krishna. And when the Lord appears in a hidden way as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the Vedavyas of His lila may also appear in that way: hidden (chhanna).\n\nSo first, “I bow down to Vrndavan Das Thakur and then to Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami because they both appeared as Vedavyas. Vrndavan Das Thakur was the open (vyakta) Vedavyas, and Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami was the hidden (chhanna) Vyas. Together they have revealed Chaitanya-lila. Both are extremely blessed by Nityananda Prabhu! They are decorated with the dust of Nityananda Prabhu’s all-merciful lotus feet (dvau Nityanandapadabja-karunarenu-bhusitau).” Vrndavan Das Thakur was Nityananda Prabhu’s disciple, and Krishnadas Kaviraj Goswami received merciful blessings from Nityananda Prabhu. They were both enriched with the blessings of Nityananda Prabhu. If Nityananda Prabhu had not appeared, no one could understand Mahaprabhu, and no one would have Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta or Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat. Nowhere would there be Mahaprabhu’s life history, Mahaprabhu’s preaching programme, Mahaprabhu’s glorification, and so on. We have everything only by the grace of Nityananda Prabhu!\n\nIn this way Vrndavan Das Thakur and Srila Kaviraj Goswami blessed me. By their mercy we can understand a little bit of their glories. Vrndavan Das Thakur was very much intoxicated with the Pastimes of Nityananda Prabhu and Mahaprabhu, but he had unlimited love for Nityananda Prabhu, who gave us our real property in Krishna consciousness.\n\nNityananda’s legacy\n\nNityananda Prabhu lived in Radha Des and preached Krishna consciousness. When Nityananda Prabhu went to Gauri Das Pandit’s house in Kalna, He met with Gauri Das Pandit and his brother Surya Das Sarkhel. They knew Nityananda Prabhu and were very happy to serve Him. Nityananda Prabhu later saw that Surya Das had two daughters and said, “Please make an arrangement. I want to marry them.” Surya Das was very happy that Nityananda Prabhu Himself wanted to marry his daughters, Vasudha Devi and Jahnava Devi.\n\nAfter Nityananda Prabhu’s Pastimes Jahnava Devi took a leading part in the sampradaya of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. She became a Guru and travelled like a queen. Everyone respected her as a spiritual representation of Nityananda Prabhu, and she initiated many devotees. She was the guest of honour at Narottam Das Thakur’s grand festival in Kheturi Dham. Vasudha Devi had one son named Virachandra. He was initiated by Jahnava Devi, and he came to control the whole society of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu’s sampradaya. He glorified Nityananda Prabhu and Mahaprabhu in a very grand way. He spread Their glories more widely than They did. His preaching was extremely liberal, and He was even more merciful than Nityananda Prabhu Himself. He did not look at any faults of anyone and always bestowed His mercy upon all. During His time in Bengal there were many Buddhist monks, and Virachandra transformed them into devotees of Gauranga Mahaprabhu. He brought thousands and thousands of people to the lotus feet of Mahaprabhu during His Pastimes.\n\nTake the lotus feet of Nityananda Prabhu! He bestows His mercy not only on His own generation, but He bestows even more divine mercy through His followers, like His son Virachandra Prabhu.\n\nThe lotus feet of Nitai\n\nNarottam Das Thakur also received Nityananda Prabhu’s full mercy, and he distributed that widely. Narottam Das Thakur was a prince in Bengal who became a servitor of his Guru Lokanath Das Goswami in Vrndavan. Narottam Das Thakur left everything to take shelter of the Lord. His expression was, “By Nityananda Prabhu’s blessings it is possible to leave all mundane attachments.” Narottam Das Thakur took the rudder of the ship of Nityananda Prabhu along with Virachandra Prabhu. His preaching was so glorious. Still we are seeing that by the preaching of Narottam Das Thakur everyone in Manipur and Assam sings the glories of Nityananda Prabhu and Mahaprabhu. All of Bengal was influenced by his preaching, and by Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy so many people became Vaisnavas and chanted the Holy Name of the Lord, the Hare Krishna mahamantra.\n\nNarottam Das Thakur, Lochan Das Thakur, and other devotees composed many songs about Nityananda Prabhu. Narottam Das Thakur’s song Nitai-pada-kamala is a very general but is a very beautiful song. It is short and very simply expressed, but it is very palatable and gives us our main conception about Nityananda Prabhu. If you read and try to understand the meaning, you will understand the truth about Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nA king-maker\n\nWe have also seen the influence of Sri Nityananda Prabhu in the life of our Srila Guru Maharaj, Srila Bhakti Raksak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj. Without Nityananda Prabhu’s blessings upon him we would not have received the mercy of Srila Guru Maharaj. After Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur there was quarrel in the Gaudiya Math. Srila Guru Maharaj tried to cooperate with his good friend Vasudev Prabhu, who became the head of the Mission, and Kunja Babu, the secretary of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur, who he respected so much.\n\nFinally many of the leading devotees of Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur withdrew from the missionary activities of the Gaudiya Math, and Srila Guru Maharaj was the last to leave. But Srila Guru Maharaj did not want to take any disciples. He had two reasons. One was that Vasudev Prabhu was his very close friend. And second, he preached very widely and successfully in the time of his Guru Maharaj, Srila Saraswati Thakur, and he wanted to spend the last portion of his life practising Krishna consciousness, reading Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta and Srimad Bhagavatam. He wanted to stay alone. He had no enthusiasm to make disciples for himself. Srila Guru Maharaj lived in a rented room near the banks of the Ganges. He would spend his days bathing in the Ganges, doing Tulasi-seva, maintaining a garden for the worship of his Govardhan-sila, reading, writing, and chanting.\n\nAll of his godbrothers were searching for him for maybe one or two years until finally someone saw him bathing in the Ganges. They all came and forcefully requested Srila Guru Maharaj, “We need your association. We will make another institution, and you will be the head.” Srila Guru Maharaj said, “No, I won’t take disciples. If I take disciples others will think I am very enthusiastic to take disciples. I came away from the Gaudiya Math, and I do not want to preach again. I want to spend my last life alone.”\n\nSrila Guru Maharaj had resolved not to take disciples, like Lokanath Das Goswami. He simply wanted to practise for the rest of his life. They pressured Srila Guru Maharaj so much, and finally he told them, “I do not want to be a king in society. I will not be a king, but I can make a king. I can serve in the capacity of a ‘king-maker’.” He gave sannyas to many of his godbrothers, and they accepted disciples and started Missions under his guidance. But Srila Guru Maharaj lived with a few brahmacharis and from time to time would visit the auspicious birthplaces of the eternal associates of Sriman Mahaprabhu.\n\nThe order of Nityananda Prabhu\n\nThen one day Srila Guru Maharaj went to Ekachakra Dham, the birthplace of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. Srila Guru Maharaj said he went to Ekachakra to take the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu. He offered his full dandavat pranam at the lotus feet of Nityananda Prabhu and prayed, “O Nityananda Prabhu, please give Your mercy to me.” Then Srila Guru Maharaj heard, “You have the wealth of the mercy of Mahaprabhu in your heart. You have so much spiritual property, but you do not want to give that to others. That is not good! Why are you asking for My mercy? If you want the wealth of My blessings, then distribute your wealth to others. Then you can take more from Me.”\n\nSrila Guru Maharaj was surprised and thought, “Yes, there is no doubt that I have received some wealth from Srila Bhakti Siddhanta Saraswati Thakur.” Srila Guru Maharaj reflected deeply on this and then decided he would now very cautiously accept a few disciples to fulfil his debt to his Guru Maharaj and Nityananda Prabhu. Actually, this is why there are not so many disciples of Srila Guru Maharaj. He accepted those who approached him just to satisfy Nityananda Prabhu by acting on His order.\n\n“Dayal Nitai! Dayal Nitai!”\n\nWe have seen Srila Guru Maharaj show us that he is always depending on the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu. Up to his last days when Srila Guru Maharaj was in his zone, upstairs in his room or on his veranda, he was always chanting, “Dayal Nitai! Dayal Nitai!” Always his consciousness was under Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy, and he was always thinking of Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nHe forgot his position, everything. He was only asking for the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, chanting, “Dayal Nitai! Dayal Nitai! Dayal Nitai!”\n\nWhen Srila Guru Maharaj would show sickness, his servant Gaura Krishna Prabhu would try to give Srila Guru Maharaj some relief. He thought only Hari-nam could help and would offer Srila Guru Maharaj his japa-mala. He would ask, “Shall I give you your chanting beads? You will get some relief.”\n\nGuru Maharaj replied, “No, no, no. Give these chanting beads to Govinda Maharaj. My only hope is Dayal Nitai!” It was very clear. He was always calling “Dayal Nitai! Dayal Nitai!” Lastly Guru Maharaj was completely attached to Nityananda Prabhu’s merciful glance. This was a miracle for me. Prabhupad Saraswati Thakur gave Srila Guru Maharaj exclusive charge of the Rupanuga line, but Srila Guru Maharaj said that without Nityananda Prabhu you will not be able to enter that line. After entering you can get everything, but you will not gain entrance without Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy.\n\nThe power to rescue\n\nSrila Bhakti Vinod Thakur expressed in one song,\n\n‘dayal nitai chaitanya’ bale’ nach re amar mana\n\nnach re amar mana, nach re amar mana\n\naparadha dure jabe, pabe prema-dhana\n\n(aparadhera-vichara to nai re)\n\n(Gitavali: Sri Nama-kirtana, 2.1–2)\n\n[“O my mind, dance! O my mind, dance! O my mind, dance, chanting, ‘Dayal Nitai Chaitanya!’ Then you will become offenceless and attain the treasure of divine love. In the Names of Chaitanya and Nitai there is no consideration of offences!”]\n\nI once asked Srila Guru Maharaj, “How is it possible that there is no consideration of offences in the Names of Chaitanya and Nitai?” Srila Guru Maharaj answered, “To some extent it depends on our realisation, but satapatra vedhah nyaya, a needle can pierce through one hundred leaves within a second. The Names of Nitai and Chaitanya have the power to rescue us so quickly that the time it takes for us to be actually rescued is not countable.” In this way Srila Guru Maharaj explained.\n\nNityananda Prabhu: Sri Gurudev\n\nEverything is coming by the grace of Sri Nityananda Prabhu. Because our Guru Maharaj has shown such deep attachment to Nityananda Prabhu’s lotus feet we feel that, and we are feeling Srila Guru Maharaj to be an Avatar of Nityananda Prabhu. Many things about Nityananda Prabhu’s Pastimes are written in the books and in the hearts of the devotees. The scripture confirms that Gurudev is always nondifferent from Nityananda Prabhu, that Nityananda-tattva is Guru-tattva. Even when Guru is Radharani, there also we can see Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy coming for others. Nitaiyera karuna habe, Vraje Radha-Krishna pabe, dhara Nitaiyera charana du’ khani. Nityananda Prabhu is a nondifferent form of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, and without the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu, no one will get the mercy of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. And without Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, no one will get entrance into Sri Sri Radha-Krishna’s Pastimes. If you want to serve Krishna under the guidance of Radharani, then you must surrender to Nityananda Prabhu. By the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu you will receive liberation, and not only liberation, prema-bhakti. Nityananda Prabhu will give you entrance into Vrndavan, a visa to Vraja Dham. Only then will you be able to enter. If you want that, then you must be surrendered to Nityananda Prabhu, and then in the very easiest way it will come to you. This is the easiest and only procedure to get the mercy of Lord Krishna.\n\nWe are very fortunate souls because we heard the divine Name of Nityananda Prabhu, and we are following, as possible by us, Nityananda Prabhu’s line. That is most clean and clear for the conditioned souls. We will get everything by the grace of Nityananda Prabhu and His associates. I must say to everyone: take shelter of the lotus feet of Nityananda Prabhu and you will have no fear from anywhere. We are all fallen souls, and our only hope is the mercy of Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nsamsarera para ha-i’ bhaktira sagare\n\nye dubibe, se bhajuka nitai-chadere\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 1.77)\n\n“If anyone wants to leave their mundane attachment and defeat maya, if anyone wants Krishna-prema and Krishna-bhakti, then they must worship Nityananda Prabhu’s lotus feet.”\n\nNityananda Prabhu is more merciful than Mahaprabhu. Mahaprabhu’s conception was spread mainly by Nityananda Prabhu. He has given everything—full-fledged Krishna consciousness—to everyone. Actually Nityananda Prabhu’s full mercy is within sankirtan. The whole world is chanting the Holy Name—the Divine Name of Lord Krishna, the transcendental sound vibration form of the Lord, the Hare Krishna mahamantra—by His grace.\n\nHere is one thing to understand: depending on your own position you will feel if you have Nityananda Prabhu’s mercy or not. If you will feel that within you, then you will be fully satisfied. By the grace of Nityananda Prabhu, you will get everything. I pray to Srila Guru Maharaj that he will mercifully give us the shelter of His lotus feet. What can I say more!\n\nThe Glories of Sri Nityananda Prabhu in the Scriptures\n\nvande ’nantadbhutaisvaryam sri-nityanandam isvaram\n\nyasyechchhaya tat-svarupam ajnenapi nirupyate\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.1)\n\nI offer obeisance unto the Lord, Sri Nityananda, whose opulences are wonderful and infinite.

The stem from the lotus navel of His part’s part, Garbhodaksayi Visnu, contains the universe’s planets and is the birthplace of Brahma.\n\nyasyamsamsamsah paratmakhilanam\n\nposta visnur bhati dugdhabdhi-sayi\n\nksauni-bharta yat-kala so ’py anantas\n\ntam sri-nityananda-ramam prapadye\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 1.11)\n\nI surrender unto Sri Nityananda-Balaram. His part’s part’s part, Ksirodaksayi Visnu, is the maintainer and Soul of all souls, and Ksirodaksayi Visnu’s sub-part, Ananta Ses, is the upholder of the Earth.\n\ne-saba pramane jani nityananda-tattva-sima\n\ntahake ‘ananta’ kahi, ki tara mahima\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.126)\n\nThrough this evidence we understand Nityananda in full. Some call Him ’Ananta’ (‘unlimited’). Is this His greatness?\n\nei-rupe nityananda ‘ananta’-prakasa\n\nsei-bhave—kahe muni chaitanyera dasa\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.134)\n\nNityananda has unlimited forms, and in all of them He declares, “I am Sri Chaitanya’s servant.”\n\nsei krsna—navadvipe sri-chaitanya-chandra\n\nsei balarama—sange sri-nityananda\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.6)\n\nKrishna appeared in Nabadwip as Sri Chaitanyachandra. Balaram appeared with Him as Sri Nityananda.\n\napane karena krsna-lilara sahaya\n\nsrsti-lila-karya kare dhari’ chari kaya\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.9)\n\nBalaram personally assists in Krishna’s Pastimes. Assuming four other forms, He performs the work of creation.\n\nsrsty-adika seva,—tara ajnara palana\n\n‘sesa’-rupe kare krsnera vividha sevana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.10)\n\nFollowing His orders, three of these forms perform the service of creating, maintaining, and destroying the material world. In the form of Ananta Ses, He serves Krishna in various ways.\n\nsarva-rupe asvadaye krsna-sevananda\n\nsei balarama—gaura-sange nityananda\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.11)\n\nIn all these forms He relishes the joy of Krishna’s service. In the company of Sri Gauranga, Balaram is Nityananda.\n\nchaitanya-krpaya haya nityanande rati\n\nnityanande janile apad nahi kati\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.220)\n\nOne becomes attached to Nityananda by Chaitanya’s mercy, and if one knows Nityananda, then one never undergoes misfortune.\n\nsamsarera para ha-i’ bhaktira sagare\n\nye dubibe se bhajuka nitaichadere\n\namara prabhura prabhu sri gaurasundara\n\ne bada bharasa chitte dhari nirantara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 17.152–153)\n\nTo cross over material existence and swim in the ocean of devotion, serve Sri Nitaichad. My Master’s Master is Sri Gaurasundar. I hold this great hope in my heart forever.\n\nkiba yati nityananda, kiba bhakta jnani\n\nya’ra yena mata ichchha, na bolaye keni\n\nye-se kene chaitanyera nityananda nahe\n\ntabu sei pada-padma rahuka hrdaye\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.223-224)\n\nSome consider Nityananda a sannyasi, some consider Him a devotee, and some consider Him a scholar. People may say whatever they like. May Nityananda’s lotus feet remain in heart, even if He is nothing to Sri Chaitanya.\n\neta parihareo ye papi ninda kare\n\ntabe lathi maro tara sirera upare\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.225, 17.158)\n\nNityananda is most benevolent. I kick the head of any sinner who criticies Him.\n\nmadira yavani yadi nityananda dhare\n\ntathapi brahmara vandya kahila tomare\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Antya-khanda, 6.123)\n\nThis I tell to you: even if He takes hold of some wine and an outcaste girl, Nityananda is worshippable to Brahma.\n\ndui bhai eka-tanu—samana-prakasa\n\nnityananda na mana, tomara habe sarva-nasa\n\nekete visvasa, anye na kara sammana\n\n“ardha-kukkuti-nyaya” tomara pramana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.175-176)\n\nThe two brothers, Chaitanya and Nityananda, are one body. They are equal. If you do not accept Nityananda, then you will be ruined. If you have faith in one, but do not respect the other, then your standpoint is ‘half-hen logic’.\n\nkona chaitanyera loka nityananda-prati\n\n‘manda’ bole, hena dekha,—se kevala ‘stuti’\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.226)\n\nIf any follower of Sri Chaitanya says Nityananda is bad, then see that such statements are in fact praise.\n\nnityananda-svarupe se ninda na laoyaya\n\nta’na pathe thakile se gaurachandra paya\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.229)\n\nIf one does not believe in any criticism towards Nityananda and follows His path, then one attains Gaurachandra.\n\nsarva-bhave svami yena haya nityananda\n\nta’ra haiya bhaji yena prabhu-gaurachandra\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.231)\n\nNityanada in my master in all respects, and being His, I serve Gaurachandra Prabhu.\n\nnityananda avadhuta sabate agala\n\nchaitanyera dasya-preme ha-ila pagala\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 6.47)\n\nThe avadhut Nityananda, who is foremost within the society of Sri Chaitanya’s devotees, madly engaged in loving service to Sri Chaitanya.\n\npreme matta nityananda krpa-avatara\n\nuttama, adhama, kichhu na kare vichara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.208)\n\nMad with divine love, Nityananda, the embodiment of mercy, does not consider who is high and who is low.\n\nprema-pracharana ara pasanda-dalana\n\ndui-karye avadhuta karena bhramana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Antya-lila, 3.149)\n\nAs an Avadhut, He wanders distributing divine love and subduing the wicked.\n\njaya jaya avadhuta-chandra nityananda\n\njagat badhila yeha diya prema-phada\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Antya-lila, 8.3)\n\nAll glory to Avadhutchandra, who bound the world with a knot of divine love!\n\nnityanandam aham naumi sarvananda-karam param\n\nhari-nama-pradam devam avadhuta-siromanim\n\nI bow down to the crown-jewel of mendicants, the origin of the greatest joy, the giver of the Lord’s Name, Sri Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nsaksatei dekha sabe ei tribhuvane\n\nnityananda-dvare pailena prema-dhane\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-bhagavat: Adi-khanda, 9.216)\n\nSee directly that everyone in the three worlds has received the wealth of divine love through Nityananda Prabhu.\n\nbhaja gauranga kaha gauranga laha gaurangera nama\n\nye jana gauranga bhaje sei haya amara prana\n\nNityananda Prabhu calls out: “Serve Gauranga, speak about Gauranga, and chant Gauranga’s Name! One who serves Gauranga is My very life.”\n\nnache matoyara nitai godrumera mathe\n\njagat mataya nitai premera malasate\n\npalaya duranta kali padiya bibhrate\n\nki sukhe bhasila jiva gorachadera nate\n\ndekhiya suniya pasandira buka phate\n\n(Gitavali: Nagar-kirtan, 8.5–7)\n\nNitai dances madly in fields of Godrumadwip. He maddens the world with a wrestler’s challenge of divine love, and the wicked Kali panics and flees. What sort of joy have the souls been immersed in by Nitai and Gorachad’s dancing?! Seeing and hearing of it, the sinners’ courage shatters.\n\njaya nityananda-chandra jaya chaitanyera prana\n\ntomara charanaravinde bhakti deha’ dana\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Antya-lila, 11.6)\n\nAll glory to Nityanandachandra, the life of Sri Chaitanya!

By Nityananda’s mercy, I recognise the Vaisnavas. By Nityananda’s mercy, one’s offences dissolve. By Nityananda’s mercy, one attains devotion to Visnu.\n\nnityananda-mahima-sindhu ananta, apara\n\neka kana sparsi matra,—se krpa tahara\n\n(Sri Chaitanya-charitamrta: Adi-lila, 5.157)\n\nThe ocean of Nityananda’s glory is eternal and infinite. I touch upon one drop of it, by His mercy.\n\nha ha prabhu nityananda premananda sukhi\n\nkrpavalokana kara ami bada duhkhi\n\n(Prarthana: 40. 3)\n\nO Nityananda! You are overjoyed with divine love.

When will He give me the shade of His feet and grant me a place in the marketplace of the Name?\n\nKirtans Glorifying Sri Nityananda Prabhu\n\nnitai-pada-kamala koti-chandra-susitala\n\nye chhayaya jagata judaya\n\nhena nitai vine bhai radha-krsna paite nai\n\ndrdha kari’ dhara nitaira paya [1]\n\nCooling like ten million moons, Nitai’s lotus feet soothe the world with their shade.

Such an animal is very wicked. What will learning (aristocratic birth) do for one who was immersed in worldly pleasures and never called aloud, “Nitai”?\n\nahankare matta haina nitai-pada pasariya\n\nasatyere satya kari’ mani\n\nnitaiyer karuna habe vraje radha-krsna pabe\n\ndhara nitaiyer charan du’khani [3]\n\nMad with pride, forgetting Nitai’s feet, I accept untruth as truth.
